If the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis, the length of the major axis is one of the options given. Alright, let&#39;s try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that when a plane intersects a right circular cylinder, the cross-section can be an ellipse, a circle, or other shapes depending on the angle of the intersection. Since the problem mentions it forms an ellipse, that means the plane isn&#39;t parallel to the base or the side of the cylinder. A circle would be if the plane is parallel to the base, right? So here, it&#39;s tilted.The cylinder has a radius of 1, so the diameter is 2. If the plane were perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, the cross-section would be a circle with diameter 2. But since it&#39;s an ellipse, the plane is inclined at some angle.Now, the ellipse has a major axis and a minor axis. The minor axis is the shorter one, and the major axis is the longer one. The problem states that the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis. Let&#39;s denote the minor axis as &#39;2b&#39; and the major axis as &#39;2a&#39;, so according to the problem, 2a = 1.5 * 2b, which simplifies to a = 1.5b. But maybe we can just work with the lengths directly. Let me think.Wait, actually, in an ellipse, the standard form is (x^2/a^2) + (y^2/b^2) = 1, where 2a is the major axis and 2b is the minor axis. But here, the problem says major axis is 50% longer than minor axis. So if minor axis is length L, then major axis is L + 0.5L = 1.5L. So major is 1.5 times minor. So 2a = 1.5 * 2b, so again, a = 1.5b.But how does the angle of the plane relate to the axes of the ellipse?I remember that when a plane cuts a cylinder at an angle θ with respect to the axis, the minor axis of the ellipse is the same as the diameter of the cylinder, so 2r, which in this case is 2*1=2. Wait, is that correct? Wait, maybe not. Let me recall.If the cylinder is right circular, and the plane is inclined at an angle θ to the axis, then the minor axis is along the axis of the cylinder. The length of the minor axis would be equal to the diameter of the cylinder, which is 2. But wait, no, that might not be right.Wait, actually, when you tilt the plane, the cross-section becomes an ellipse where the minor axis is the diameter of the cylinder, and the major axis is stretched by a factor depending on the angle. Let me think again.Suppose the cylinder is aligned along the z-axis, with radius 1. The equation of the cylinder is x² + y² = 1. If a plane intersects this cylinder, the intersection curve is an ellipse when the plane is not parallel to the generators (lines) of the cylinder.Suppose the plane is given by z = m y + c or something. Wait, maybe a more general plane. Let me parametrize the intersection.Alternatively, think about slicing the cylinder with a plane. The intersection will be an ellipse. The minor axis of the ellipse is the same as the diameter of the cylinder when the plane is inclined. Wait, perhaps not. Let me recall the parametrization.If we take a cylinder x² + y² = 1, and intersect it with a plane z = m y + c. Let&#39;s suppose the plane is not vertical. Then substituting z into the cylinder equation? Wait, no. The cylinder equation is x² + y² = 1, and z can be anything. If the plane is given by, say, ax + by + cz = d. Then the intersection curve is the set of points (x, y, z) satisfying both equations.But maybe it&#39;s easier to parameterize the cylinder. Let&#39;s parameterize the cylinder using an angle θ. So any point on the cylinder can be written as (cos θ, sin θ, z), where θ is from 0 to 2π, and z is any real number.Now, if we substitute this into the plane equation ax + by + cz = d, we get a cos θ + b sin θ + c z = d. Then we can solve for z in terms of θ: z = (d - a cos θ - b sin θ)/c. Then, the parametric equations for the intersection curve would be x = cos θ, y = sin θ, z = (d - a cos θ - b sin θ)/c.But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a simpler way. Let me think about the standard result for the intersection of a plane and a cylinder.Alternatively, I remember that the eccentricity of the ellipse formed by the intersection depends on the angle of the plane relative to the axis. If the plane is inclined at an angle θ, then the major axis of the ellipse is the diameter of the cylinder divided by cos θ, and the minor axis remains the diameter. Wait, is that right?So if the original circle has diameter 2 (radius 1), then if you tilt the plane by angle θ, the projection along the direction of the tilt would stretch the axis by 1/cos θ. Hence, the major axis becomes 2 / cos θ, and the minor axis remains 2. Therefore, in this case, the major axis is (2 / cos θ), and the minor axis is 2. Then according to the problem, the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis. So (2 / cos θ) = 1.5 * 2, which simplifies to 1 / cos θ = 1.5, so cos θ = 2/3. Then θ = arccos(2/3). But then the major axis length would be 2 / (2/3) = 3. Therefore, the major axis is 3. So is the answer E) 3?Wait, but let&#39;s check this reasoning again. If the plane is inclined at angle θ, then the length of the major axis is 2 / cos θ. But why is that the case? Let me think of the cylinder as a circle in the cross-section, and when you slice it at an angle, the ellipse&#39;s major axis is the diameter divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis. So if the plane is tilted by θ from the axis, then the major axis is 2 / cos θ. The minor axis remains 2, which is the diameter of the cylinder.But in that case, if the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis, then major axis = 1.5 * minor axis. Since minor axis is 2, then major axis should be 3, which is 1.5 * 2. So according to this, the major axis is 3. So the answer is E) 3. That seems straightforward. But let me verify.Alternatively, consider the cylinder x² + y² = 1. Let’s take a plane that is tilted with respect to the z-axis. For simplicity, let&#39;s take a plane such as z = m y. Then substituting into the cylinder equation, x² + y² = 1. So points on the intersection satisfy both equations. To find the ellipse equation, let&#39;s express it in terms of y.But perhaps a better way is to consider the parametric equations. Let me parameterize the cylinder as x = cos θ, y = sin θ, z = z. Then the plane equation z = m y becomes z = m sin θ. So the parametric equations for the intersection curve are x = cos θ, y = sin θ, z = m sin θ. To find the projection onto, say, the x-y plane or another plane to see the ellipse?Alternatively, let&#39;s eliminate the parameter θ. From x = cos θ and y = sin θ, we have x² + y² = 1. Then z = m y. So if we look at the curve in 3D space, but perhaps we can express the ellipse in terms of coordinates.Wait, maybe we need to find the equation of the ellipse in the plane. Let&#39;s consider coordinates in the plane. Let me perform a coordinate transformation. Suppose the plane is given by z = m y. Then in this plane, coordinates can be represented by (x, y, m y). So points on the plane can be parameterized by x and y. But when intersected with the cylinder x² + y² = 1, the intersection is the set of points (x, y, m y) where x² + y² = 1. But how does this look in the plane?Alternatively, we can consider a coordinate system within the plane. Let me define coordinates (u, v) in the plane z = m y. Let u be along the x-axis, and v be along the line where x=0 in the plane. Then, in the plane, a point (u, v) corresponds to (u, v, m v). So substituting into the cylinder equation, u² + v² = 1. But in the plane&#39;s coordinates, this is u² + v² = 1, which is a circle. Wait, that can&#39;t be right. Wait, but the intersection should be an ellipse unless the plane is perpendicular.Wait, maybe I&#39;m making a mistake here. Let&#39;s think again. The cylinder is x² + y² =1. The plane is z = m y. The intersection is all points (x, y, m y) where x² + y² =1. If we consider this in 3D space, projecting onto the plane, but how do we see the ellipse?Alternatively, let&#39;s look at the parametric equations. Let θ parameterize the cylinder as (cos θ, sin θ, z). Then, the plane equation z = m y becomes z = m sin θ. Therefore, the parametric equations for the intersection curve are:x = cos θy = sin θz = m sin θIf we consider this curve, we can see that in the plane z = m y, the coordinates can be represented as (x, y) where x = cos θ and y = sin θ. But since z is dependent on y, maybe the ellipse is in the x and y directions?Wait, perhaps another approach. Let&#39;s consider that in the plane z = m y, the intersection with the cylinder is an ellipse. The ellipse can be represented in terms of coordinates within that plane. To find the major and minor axes, we might need to perform a rotation or scaling.Alternatively, think of the cylinder as being extended along the z-axis, radius 1. When you slice it with a plane that&#39;s not perpendicular to the z-axis, the intersection is an ellipse. The minor axis of this ellipse is equal to the diameter of the cylinder, which is 2. The major axis depends on the angle of the slice. Specifically, if the plane is inclined at an angle θ from the horizontal (i.e., the angle between the plane and the axis of the cylinder is θ), then the major axis length is 2 / cos θ. So if the angle θ is such that the major axis is 1.5 times the minor axis, then:Major axis = 1.5 * minor axisBut the minor axis is 2, so major axis is 3. Therefore, 3 = 2 / cos θ ⇒ cos θ = 2/3 ⇒ θ = arccos(2/3). So the major axis length is 3. So the answer is E) 3.But let me verify this with another method. Let&#39;s use the standard parametrization of the ellipse formed by cutting a cylinder with a plane.Suppose the cylinder has equation x² + y² = 1. Let the plane be given by z = m y. The intersection curve will satisfy both equations. Let&#39;s parametrize θ such that x = cos θ, y = sin θ, then z = m sin θ. So the parametric equations for the ellipse are:x = cos θy = sin θz = m sin θIf we project this curve onto the x-y plane, we get the circle x² + y² =1, but in the plane z = m y, the curve is an ellipse. To find the major and minor axes, we can consider two points in the plane. Alternatively, we can use the fact that the intersection of a plane and a cylinder is an ellipse, and compute its axes.Alternatively, consider the parametric equations in the plane. Let’s consider coordinates in the cutting plane. Let’s set up coordinates u and v in the plane z = m y. Let’s define u as the x-coordinate, and v as the coordinate along the line where x=0 in the plane z = m y. So when x=0, z = m y, which is a line in the y-z plane. So in the plane z = m y, coordinates can be represented as (u, v) where u corresponds to x and v corresponds to some direction in the plane.But maybe this is complicating things. Alternatively, note that the intersection curve can be parameterized as (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). To find the shape of this curve in 3D space, we can compute its projection onto a plane or find its actual shape.Alternatively, think of the plane z = m y as a shearing transformation. If we shear the cylinder along the y-axis with a factor of m, the cross-section becomes an ellipse. The major axis of this ellipse is determined by the shear factor.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute the distance between two points on the ellipse. The points on the ellipse are (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). Let&#39;s find the maximum distance between two points on this ellipse, which would be the major axis.Alternatively, compute the length of the major axis by finding the maximum distance in the direction of the major axis. The major axis would be along the direction where the plane is most inclined relative to the cylinder.Alternatively, think in terms of the angle of the plane. The angle θ between the cutting plane and the axis of the cylinder (z-axis) can be found using the normal vector of the plane. The plane z = m y can be written as -m y + z = 0. The normal vector is (0, -m, 1). The angle between this normal vector and the z-axis (which is the cylinder&#39;s axis) is given by the dot product:cos φ = (normal vector) • (z-axis unit vector) / |normal vector| = (0*0 + (-m)*0 + 1*1)/sqrt(0² + (-m)² + 1²) = 1 / sqrt(m² + 1)Therefore, the angle φ between the normal vector and the z-axis is arccos(1 / sqrt(m² + 1)). The angle θ between the plane and the z-axis is complementary to φ, so θ = 90° - φ. Therefore, sin θ = 1 / sqrt(m² + 1). Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. The angle between the plane and the z-axis is θ, which is the angle between the plane and the axis. This is equal to the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the normal vector of the horizontal plane (which is the z-axis). Hmm, perhaps not.Wait, actually, the angle between two planes is defined as the angle between their normal vectors. The original cylinder&#39;s axis is along the z-axis, so a horizontal plane (perpendicular to the z-axis) has a normal vector along the z-axis. The cutting plane has a normal vector (0, -m, 1). The angle between the cutting plane and the horizontal plane is the angle between their normal vectors, which is φ = arccos( (0*0 + 0*(-m) + 1*1) / (sqrt(0² + 0² + 1²) * sqrt(0² + m² + 1²)) ) ) = arccos(1 / sqrt(m² + 1)). Therefore, the angle between the cutting plane and the horizontal plane is φ = arccos(1 / sqrt(m² + 1)). Therefore, the angle θ between the cutting plane and the z-axis is 90° - φ. So sin θ = sin(90° - φ) = cos φ = 1 / sqrt(m² + 1). Therefore, θ = arcsin(1 / sqrt(m² + 1)).But how does this relate to the major and minor axes?Alternatively, in the case where a plane intersects a cylinder to form an ellipse, the ratio between the major and minor axes can be related to the angle θ at which the plane is inclined relative to the axis of the cylinder. If the angle between the cutting plane and the axis is θ, then the major axis length is 2 / sin θ, and the minor axis remains 2. Wait, maybe I confused sine and cosine earlier.Wait, let&#39;s think of it this way: when the cutting plane is inclined at an angle θ to the axis of the cylinder, the length of the major axis is determined by how much the plane &quot;stretches&quot; the circle. If you imagine looking at the cylinder along the direction of the plane, the ellipse&#39;s major axis corresponds to the diameter of the original circle divided by the sine of θ. Because the angle θ is between the plane and the axis, the projection of the circle onto the plane would stretch the axis by 1/sin θ. Let me visualize this.Suppose θ is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis. If θ is 90 degrees, the plane is perpendicular, and the cross-section is a circle with diameter 2. As θ decreases, the plane becomes more inclined, stretching the cross-section into an ellipse with a longer major axis. The relationship between the axes lengths and the angle can be derived using trigonometry.Imagine a right triangle where one leg is the diameter of the cylinder (2), and the hypotenuse is the major axis of the ellipse. The angle opposite the diameter leg is θ. Therefore, sin θ = 2 / major axis. Hence, major axis = 2 / sin θ. The minor axis remains 2, as it is perpendicular to the direction of inclination.Given that major axis is 1.5 times the minor axis, so 2 / sin θ = 1.5 * 2 ⇒ 1 / sin θ = 1.5 ⇒ sin θ = 2/3. Therefore, θ = arcsin(2/3). Then, the major axis is 2 / (2/3) = 3. Therefore, the major axis is 3. So answer E) 3.Wait, so this contradicts my previous reasoning where I thought it was 2 / cos θ. Hmm. Which one is correct? Let me think again.If θ is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis of the cylinder, then when θ is 90 degrees, the plane is perpendicular, cross-section is a circle (major = minor = 2). When θ is 0 degrees, the plane is parallel to the axis, which would make the cross-section a rectangle if the plane is tangent, but in our case, since the plane is intersecting, it&#39;s a degenerate ellipse (a line) only if it&#39;s parallel. But in reality, planes parallel to the axis would intersect the cylinder along a pair of lines.But since the problem states that the intersection is an ellipse, θ must be between 0 and 90 degrees, exclusive.Wait, maybe my confusion comes from different definitions of the angle. Let&#39;s clarify.Let me refer to standard results. When a right circular cylinder is cut by a plane at an angle θ with the axis, the resulting ellipse has major axis length 2a = 2 / sin θ and minor axis length 2b = 2. Therefore, the ratio of major to minor is (2 / sin θ) / 2 = 1 / sin θ. So if major is 1.5 times minor, then 1 / sin θ = 1.5 ⇒ sin θ = 2/3. Therefore, major axis is 2 / sin θ = 3. Therefore, the answer is 3, which is option E.Alternatively, another way to derive this is by considering the parametric equations of the ellipse. Let&#39;s take the cylinder x² + y² = 1 and a plane z = m y. The intersection curve is parametrized by (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). Let&#39;s consider the projection of this curve onto the x-z plane to see the ellipse.Wait, in the x-z plane, the projection would have coordinates (cos θ, m sin θ). So parametric equations x = cos θ, z = m sin θ. This is an ellipse with semi-axes 1 and m. Therefore, the major axis is 2*max(1, m) and minor axis is 2*min(1, m). Wait, but this is only the projection. The actual ellipse in the cutting plane might have different axes.Wait, but perhaps we can calculate the actual major and minor axes of the ellipse formed by the intersection. Let&#39;s use the parametrization (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). To find the axes of the ellipse, we need to compute the maximum and minimum distances from the center, or use eigenvalues.Alternatively, consider that the ellipse lies in the plane z = m y. Let&#39;s express this ellipse in terms of coordinates in that plane. Let’s set up coordinates in the plane z = m y. Let’s take two orthogonal vectors in this plane. One vector can be along the x-axis, which is (1, 0, 0), since x is independent. Another vector can be along the direction where x=0, so in the plane z = m y, that direction is (0, y, m y). Let&#39;s take y=1, so the vector is (0, 1, m). These two vectors form a basis for the plane.So any point in the plane can be written as u*(1, 0, 0) + v*(0, 1, m). So coordinates (u, v) in the plane correspond to (u, v, m v). The intersection with the cylinder x² + y² =1 gives u² + v² =1. So in terms of the coordinates (u, v) in the plane, the equation is u² + v² =1. Wait, that&#39;s a circle? But that can&#39;t be, since the intersection should be an ellipse. What&#39;s going on here?Ah, perhaps the metric in the plane is different due to the scaling from the third coordinate. Wait, no, in the plane&#39;s own coordinate system, distances are Euclidean. Wait, but when we have coordinates (u, v) in the plane, and they correspond to (u, v, m v), then the actual 3D coordinates are (u, v, m v). Therefore, the distance between two points in the plane is not just sqrt((du)^2 + (dv)^2), but sqrt((du)^2 + (dv)^2 + (m dv)^2). Therefore, the plane has a different metric, but the equation u² + v² =1 would still represent a circle in the local coordinates, but when embedded in 3D, it&#39;s an ellipse.Wait, maybe this is confusing. Let&#39;s instead compute the metric tensor. The coordinates in the plane are (u, v), and the corresponding 3D coordinates are (u, v, m v). The differentials are dx = du, dy = dv, dz = m dv. Therefore, the arc length in 3D is ds² = du² + dv² + (m dv)^2 = du² + (1 + m²) dv². Therefore, the equation u² + v² =1 in these coordinates corresponds to an ellipse in 3D space with metric ds² = du² + (1 + m²) dv². To find the principal axes of this ellipse, we can diagonalize the metric or use a coordinate transformation.Alternatively, if we parameterize the curve as u = cos θ, v = sin θ, then in 3D coordinates, this is (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). The question is, what is the shape of this curve in the plane z = m y? Since u and v are coordinates in the plane, the equation u² + v² =1 is a circle in the plane&#39;s coordinates, but due to the non-Euclidean metric in 3D, it&#39;s an ellipse when viewed from 3D space.But perhaps another approach: The intersection curve is an ellipse. The parametric equations are (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). To find the major and minor axes, we can compute the maximum and minimum distances from the center (0,0,0) in the plane.Wait, the center of the ellipse is at the origin (0,0,0). The points on the ellipse are (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). The distance from the center in the plane would be sqrt(cos² θ + sin² θ + (m sin θ)^2) = sqrt(1 + m² sin² θ). But this is not necessary the major/minor axes.Alternatively, the major and minor axes are the extrema of the distance in specific directions. Maybe we can find the lengths by finding the maximum and minimum distances along the principal axes.Alternatively, consider that in the plane z = m y, the ellipse can be expressed parametrically as (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ). Let&#39;s project this onto two perpendicular directions in the plane. For example, one direction along (1, 0, 0) and another along (0, 1, m).The length along the (1, 0, 0) direction is 2 (from -1 to 1 in x), which is the minor axis. The length along the (0, 1, m) direction would be the maximum extent in that direction. Let&#39;s compute the maximum value of the component in that direction.A point (cos θ, sin θ, m sin θ) in the direction (0, 1, m) is given by the dot product with the unit vector in that direction. The vector (0,1,m) has length sqrt(1 + m²). The dot product is (0*cos θ + 1*sin θ + m*(m sin θ)) = sin θ + m² sin θ = sin θ (1 + m²). To find the maximum value of this, since sin θ ranges from -1 to 1, the maximum is (1 + m²). Therefore, the maximum extent in the (0,1,m) direction is (1 + m²)/sqrt(1 + m²)) = sqrt(1 + m²). Therefore, the length of the major axis in that direction is 2*sqrt(1 + m²). But wait, how does this relate to the major axis?Wait, perhaps not. The dot product gives the projection along that direction, but the maximum value of the projection is sqrt(1 + m²) times the maximum value of sin θ. Wait, sin θ ranges from -1 to 1, so the maximum projection is (1 + m²) * 1 / sqrt(1 + m²) ) = sqrt(1 + m²). Therefore, the length from the center to the endpoint in that direction is sqrt(1 + m²). Therefore, the major axis length would be 2*sqrt(1 + m²). But earlier, we had that the major axis is 3. So if 2*sqrt(1 + m²) = 3, then sqrt(1 + m²) = 3/2 ⇒ 1 + m² = 9/4 ⇒ m² = 5/4 ⇒ m = sqrt(5)/2. But how does that relate to the original problem?Wait, but in this case, we found that the major axis length is 2*sqrt(1 + m²), and the minor axis is 2. If the major is 1.5 times the minor, then 2*sqrt(1 + m²) = 1.5*2 ⇒ sqrt(1 + m²) = 1.5 ⇒ 1 + m² = 2.25 ⇒ m² = 1.25 ⇒ m = sqrt(5)/2 ≈ 1.118. But how does this relate to the angle?Alternatively, maybe this approach is getting too involved. Let&#39;s go back to the first principles.Consider the cylinder x² + y² =1. A plane intersects it, forming an ellipse. The minor axis of the ellipse corresponds to the diameter of the cylinder, which is 2, since even when you tilt the plane, the shortest distance across the ellipse should still be the diameter of the cylinder. The major axis is longer, depending on the tilt angle.If the major axis is 1.5 times the minor axis, then major axis is 3. Hence, answer E) 3.Alternatively, to confirm this, think about the fact that when you slice a cylinder at an angle θ, the length of the major axis is 2 / cos θ. If the minor axis is 2 (diameter), then 2 / cos θ = 3 ⇒ cos θ = 2/3. Therefore, the angle θ between the cutting plane and the axis is arccos(2/3), which is valid. Hence, the major axis length is 3.Therefore, after going through multiple methods and verifying the result, I believe the answer is E) 3.Final Answerboxed{E}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the length of the major axis when a plane intersects a right circular cylinder of radius 1 to form an ellipse, we start by noting that the minor axis of the ellipse is the diameter of the cylinder, which is 2. The problem states that the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis.1. Understanding the Ellipse Axes:   - The minor axis (2b) is the diameter of the cylinder, which is 2. Therefore, the minor axis is 2.   - The major axis (2a) is 50% longer than the minor axis. Thus, the major axis is (1.5 times 2 = 3).2. Verification Using Trigonometry:   - When a plane intersects a cylinder at an angle, the major axis of the resulting ellipse is stretched by a factor dependent on the angle of intersection. The minor axis remains the diameter of the cylinder.   - The major axis length is given by ( frac{2}{cos theta} ) where ( theta ) is the angle between the plane and the axis of the cylinder. Given the major axis is 3, we solve ( frac{2}{cos theta} = 3 ), leading to ( cos theta = frac{2}{3} ).3. Conclusion:   - The major axis length is confirmed to be 3, which is 50% longer than the minor axis of 2.Thus, the length of the major axis is (boxed{E}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here: A plane intersects a right circular cylinder of radius 1 to form an ellipse. If the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis, what is the length of the major axis? The options are given as (A) 1, (B) 3/2, (C) 2, (D) 9/4, (E) 3.Hmm, right. Let me think. I remember that when a plane intersects a cylinder, the cross-section can be an ellipse, a circle, or other shapes like a parabola or hyperbola if the plane is parallel to the side, but since it&#39;s a right circular cylinder, the cross-section here is an ellipse. The problem states it&#39;s an ellipse, so that&#39;s confirmed.First, let me recall some properties. A right circular cylinder has a circular base, and if you slice it with a plane that&#39;s not parallel to the base or the side, you get an ellipse. The minor axis of this ellipse should correspond to the diameter of the base of the cylinder because if the plane were perpendicular to the cylinder&#39;s axis, the cross-section would be a circle with diameter 2 (since the radius is 1). But when the plane is tilted, the minor axis remains the same as the diameter of the base, and the major axis becomes elongated. Wait, is that correct?Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. If the plane is tilted, then the minor axis might actually be shorter? Or maybe the other way around. Hmm. Let me visualize this. Imagine looking at a cylinder from the side. If I slice it straight on, perpendicular to the axis, I get a circle. If I tilt the slicing plane, the cross-section becomes an ellipse. The major axis of the ellipse would be the direction in which the plane is tilted, so the length of the major axis depends on the angle of the tilt.Alternatively, perhaps the minor axis is related to the diameter of the cylinder, and the major axis is stretched by the secant of the angle of the plane with respect to the axis. Let me check.Suppose the cylinder has equation x² + y² = 1 (assuming it&#39;s aligned along the z-axis). If the plane is not parallel to the z-axis, then its intersection with the cylinder will be an ellipse. Let me parametrize the plane.Suppose the plane is given by z = m y + c, but maybe a more straightforward way is to consider the angle of the plane relative to the cylinder&#39;s axis. Let’s assume the plane is inclined at an angle θ with respect to the horizontal (i.e., the plane&#39;s normal vector makes an angle θ with the vertical axis). Then, the intersection of this plane with the cylinder will create an ellipse where the minor axis is the diameter of the cylinder (2) and the major axis is 2 / cos θ. Is that right?Wait, let&#39;s derive it properly. Let me set up coordinates. Let’s consider the cylinder x² + y² = 1. Suppose the plane is given by z = m y. Wait, if the plane is inclined, maybe parametrize it differently. Alternatively, suppose the plane cuts the cylinder at an angle θ. So the intersection curve can be parametrized as follows.Alternatively, think of the cylinder as generated by lines parallel to the z-axis. If we slice it with a plane that is not perpendicular to the z-axis, then the ellipse formed will have major and minor axes dependent on the angle of the slice.The key point is that the minor axis of the ellipse is equal to the diameter of the cylinder when the plane is perpendicular. But when the plane is tilted, the major axis becomes longer. The relationship between the angle of the plane and the axes of the ellipse can be found using trigonometric relationships.Alternatively, use the formula for the axes of the ellipse formed by the intersection. For a right circular cylinder of radius r, if a plane intersects the cylinder at an angle θ with respect to the axis, then the minor axis of the ellipse is 2r and the major axis is 2r / sin θ. Wait, no, maybe the other way around.Wait, perhaps I need to recall that the eccentricity of the ellipse depends on the angle. Let me try to parametrize the intersection.Suppose the plane is given by z = m y. Let me substitute this into the cylinder equation x² + y² = 1.So any point on the intersection satisfies x² + y² = 1 and z = m y. If we look at the projection onto the x-y plane, it&#39;s just the circle x² + y² = 1. But the plane z = m y tilts the circle into the z-direction. Wait, but how does this form an ellipse?Alternatively, maybe parametrize the cylinder as (cos θ, sin θ, z), where θ is the angular parameter and z is the height. Then the plane equation would relate θ and z.Suppose the plane is given by a x + b y + c z = d. Since the cylinder is x² + y² =1, we can parametrize points on the cylinder as (cos θ, sin θ, z). Substituting into the plane equation: a cos θ + b sin θ + c z = d. But this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, consider that the intersection of a plane with a cylinder can be found by solving the two equations simultaneously. Let me assume the plane is given by z = m y + c. If I substitute z into the cylinder equation, we still have x² + y² =1. But how does this help?Wait, perhaps another approach. The intersection of a plane with a cylinder is an ellipse if the plane is neither parallel to the side nor perpendicular to the axis. The cylinder can be considered as a surface generated by a line moving parallel to the axis along a circle.The intersection with a plane will result in an ellipse where the angle of the plane affects the eccentricity. The major and minor axes can be computed based on the angle between the plane and the axis.In standard references, when a right circular cylinder is cut by a plane at an angle θ with the axis, the resulting ellipse has a major axis of 2r / sin θ and minor axis of 2r. Wait, if θ is the angle between the plane and the axis, then the major axis length would be 2r / sin θ. But this might be depending on how θ is defined.Alternatively, if the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the axis of the cylinder is φ, then maybe the relationship is different. Let me try to derive it.Consider the cylinder x² + y² =1. Let the plane be given by z = m y. Then, substituting into the cylinder equation, we still have x² + y² =1, but z is determined by y. If we consider the intersection curve, it&#39;s parametrized by x = cos θ, y = sin θ, z = m sin θ. So in terms of θ, the parametric equations are x = cos θ, y = sin θ, z = m sin θ.If we project this curve onto the plane, but perhaps consider it in 3D space. Alternatively, if we look at the curve in the plane z = m y, we can express it in terms of coordinates in that plane.Alternatively, to find the equation of the ellipse in the plane z = m y, we can use a coordinate transformation.Let me set up coordinates in the plane. Let’s define a coordinate system (u, v) in the plane z = m y. Let u be along the direction of the cylinder&#39;s axis (which is the z-axis in original coordinates), and v be perpendicular to u in the plane. Wait, maybe this is getting complicated.Alternatively, consider that in the plane z = m y, we can express y in terms of z: y = z / m. Then substitute into the cylinder equation x² + y² =1: x² + (z/m)^2 =1. But this is the equation of an ellipse in the x-z plane, with semi-axes 1 and m. Wait, so if we rewrite this as x² + (z^2)/(m^2) =1, then the semi-axes are 1 in the x-direction and m in the z-direction. But the original cylinder&#39;s radius is 1, so if the plane is z = m y, then the intersection is x² + (z^2)/(m^2) =1. So in the plane&#39;s coordinate system, this is an ellipse with semi-major axis max(1, m) and semi-minor axis min(1, m). But since the problem states that the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis, we need to see for which m, the major axis is 1.5 times the minor axis.Wait, but in this case, if m &gt;1, then the semi-major axis is m, semi-minor axis is 1. Then major axis is 2m, minor axis is 2. So 2m = 1.5 * 2 =&gt; 2m = 3 =&gt; m=1.5. Then major axis would be 3. But this is option (E) 3. However, the cylinder has radius 1, so m is the slope of the plane. Wait, but if the plane is z = m y, then m is the tangent of the angle between the plane and the horizontal.But perhaps there is a different interpretation. Wait, perhaps the plane is inclined at an angle θ with respect to the horizontal. Then, the relationship between the axes of the ellipse would involve trigonometric functions of θ.Alternatively, from the parametrization we had earlier, when you slice the cylinder at an angle, the major axis of the ellipse is equal to the diameter divided by sin θ, where θ is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis. Wait, no, maybe cos θ?Let me think of another way. When you slice the cylinder at an angle θ with respect to the horizontal plane (the plane perpendicular to the cylinder&#39;s axis), the length of the major axis will be the diameter divided by cos θ. Because the projection of the major axis onto the horizontal plane is the diameter, so the actual major axis is longer by a factor of 1/cos θ.Wait, yes, that might make sense. If you imagine tilting the cutting plane by an angle θ, then the original circle is foreshortened along the direction of the tilt. The minor axis remains the diameter (2), and the major axis is 2 / cos θ. Therefore, the ratio of major axis to minor axis is 1 / cos θ. The problem states that the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis, so (major)/(minor) = 3/2. Therefore, 1 / cos θ = 3/2 =&gt; cos θ = 2/3. Therefore, the major axis is 2 / cos θ = 2 / (2/3) = 3. Therefore, the major axis is 3, which is option (E). But wait, the answer options include 2, 3/2, etc. Let me check again.Wait, if the ratio is major/minor = 3/2, then 1/cos θ = 3/2. Hence, cos θ = 2/3, so the major axis is 2 / cos θ = 2 / (2/3) = 3. That would make the major axis 3, which is option (E). However, the answer choices include (C) 2 as well. Let me verify this with another approach.Alternatively, consider the parametrization of the ellipse. Let&#39;s take the cylinder x² + y² =1. Suppose the plane is given by z = m y. Then, substituting into the cylinder equation, we get x² + y² =1. But in the plane z = m y, the coordinates can be represented as (x, y, m y). To express this ellipse in the plane, we can use two coordinates. Let’s set u = x and v = z = m y. Then, since x² + y² =1, we have x² + (v/m)^2 =1. So, u² + (v^2)/(m^2) =1. This is the equation of an ellipse with semi-axes lengths 1 and m. Therefore, the major axis is 2*max(1, m) and minor axis is 2*min(1, m). If the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis, then 2*max(1, m) = 1.5 * 2*min(1, m). Therefore, max(1, m) = 1.5 * min(1, m). There are two cases:Case 1: m &gt;1. Then max(1, m) = m, min(1, m) =1. Therefore, m =1.5 *1 =&gt; m=1.5. Then major axis is 2*m=3. Case 2: m ≤1. Then max(1, m)=1, min(1, m)=m. Then 1=1.5*m =&gt; m=2/3. Then major axis would be 2*1=2, minor axis=2*(2/3)=4/3. But in this case, the major axis is 2, which is 1.5 times 4/3 (which is 2 = 1.5*(4/3)=2). Wait, that actually works. So depending on the slope of the plane, you can have two possibilities. If the plane is inclined such that m &gt;1, then the major axis is 3. If m &lt;1, then the major axis is 2. But the problem states that the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis. So, if major is 3, minor is 2, then 3 is 1.5*2, which is correct. Alternatively, if major is 2, minor is 4/3, then 2 is 1.5*(4/3)=2, which is also correct. So there are two possible solutions? But the answer choices include both 2 and 3. Wait, but in the problem statement, the cylinder has radius 1, so the minor axis in the case where the plane is more horizontal (m &lt;1) would be 2*(2/3)=4/3 ≈1.333, which is shorter than the original diameter. But when you slice a cylinder with a plane, the minor axis is always the diameter of the cylinder only when the plane is perpendicular. If you slice it at a different angle, depending on the orientation, the minor axis could be shorter. Wait, but that seems conflicting with my previous reasoning.Wait, perhaps my confusion arises from different definitions of major and minor axes depending on the orientation. Let me check again.When you slice the cylinder with a plane, the intersection is an ellipse. The axes of the ellipse depend on the angle of the plane. The major axis corresponds to the direction where the plane is &quot;stretched&quot; due to the angle, and the minor axis corresponds to the perpendicular direction. If the plane is inclined with respect to the cylinder&#39;s axis, the minor axis should still be the diameter of the cylinder, since that&#39;s the shortest cross-section. Wait, but according to the parametrization above, if the plane is inclined, the minor axis can actually be smaller. But that contradicts intuition. Let me think again.Wait, maybe my mistake comes from the coordinate system. Let me think in terms of projection. If the plane is inclined at an angle θ with respect to the horizontal, then the ellipse formed is a stretched version of the circle. The minor axis remains perpendicular to the direction of the tilt, so it&#39;s the same as the original diameter. The major axis is stretched by a factor of 1/cos θ. So, the major axis would be 2 / cos θ, and minor axis is 2. Then, the ratio is 1/cos θ. If the major axis is 50% longer, then 1/cos θ = 3/2, so cos θ = 2/3, hence θ = arccos(2/3). Then the major axis is 2 / (2/3) = 3. Therefore, the answer is (E) 3.But wait, according to the parametrization earlier, if the plane is z = m y, then the ellipse equation in that plane is x² + (z/m)^2 =1, so semi-axes 1 and m. If m &gt;1, the major axis is along z, length 2m, minor axis 2. If m &lt;1, major axis is 2, minor axis 2m. Therefore, if we take m=1.5, then major axis is 3. If m=2/3, major axis is 2. So both cases satisfy major = 1.5 * minor. Therefore, there are two possible planes: one steeply inclined (m=1.5) leading to major axis 3, and one shallowly inclined (m=2/3) leading to major axis 2. But in the problem statement, it&#39;s just stated that the intersection is an ellipse with major axis 50% longer than minor. So both are possible. However, the answer choices include both 2 and 3. Wait, but the answer should be unique. The problem must have a unique solution, so perhaps my reasoning is missing something.Wait, let me check again. The cylinder has radius 1. The minor axis of the ellipse is 2 (the diameter) when the plane is perpendicular. If the plane is tilted, the minor axis remains 2, and the major axis becomes longer. But according to the previous parametrization with z = m y, if m &gt;1, the major axis is 2m, minor axis 2, which would be ratio m. If m=1.5, ratio is 1.5, so major is 3. But in the other case, when m &lt;1, then the major axis is 2 and the minor is 2m. If the ratio is 1.5, then 2 / (2m) =1.5 =&gt; 1/m =1.5 =&gt; m=2/3. Therefore, major axis is 2, minor axis is 4/3. But in this case, the major axis is 2, which is 1.5 times 4/3. So both solutions exist. But how can that be?Wait, perhaps the confusion is about which axis is major and which is minor. If the plane is only slightly tilted, the ellipse would have a major axis equal to the original diameter (2), but then how is the minor axis smaller? Wait, but the intersection of a plane with a cylinder, when the plane is almost parallel to the cylinder&#39;s axis, would create an ellipse where the major axis is longer, but in this case, if the plane is z = m y with m small, then the ellipse in the plane would have x semi-axis 1 and z semi-axis m. But if m is small, then the major axis is 2 (along x), minor is 2m. So if the plane is nearly horizontal, the minor axis becomes very small. However, if the plane is more vertical, then the major axis is along z. So the key is whether the plane&#39;s intersection is more along the axis or more across.But the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify the orientation of the plane, just that it&#39;s forming an ellipse with major axis 50% longer than minor. So both possibilities exist. But the answer options include both 2 and 3. So the problem must have an unique answer. Therefore, maybe my previous reasoning is missing some geometric constraint.Alternatively, perhaps the minor axis is always the diameter of the cylinder. Wait, but when the plane is tilted, the projection along the axis would compress one axis, making it the minor axis. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the angle between the plane and the axis.Let me recall that the standard result for the intersection of a plane and a cylinder: when a plane intersects a right circular cylinder at an angle θ with the axis, the resulting ellipse has major axis length of 2r / sin θ and minor axis 2r. But this seems different from my previous reasoning.Wait, let&#39;s check with θ as the angle between the plane and the axis. If θ is 90 degrees, the plane is perpendicular, giving a circle with diameter 2r=2. If θ is less than 90 degrees, then the major axis is 2r / sin θ, minor axis 2r. So in this case, if the major axis is 1.5 times the minor axis, then 2r / sin θ =1.5 * 2r. Therefore, 1 / sin θ =1.5, so sin θ=2/3. Therefore, θ=arcsin(2/3). Then the major axis is 2 / sin θ=2/(2/3)=3. Therefore, answer is (E) 3.But here, θ is the angle between the plane and the axis. So if θ is arcsin(2/3), then the plane is inclined at arcsin(2/3) with respect to the axis. Then, the major axis is 3, which matches the calculation. Therefore, this seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 3.But then in the earlier parametrization, when the plane is z = m y with m=1.5, which corresponds to a certain angle, the major axis is 3, which matches. However, the other case where m=2/3 gives major axis 2, which would correspond to a different angle. But according to the standard result, if θ is the angle between the plane and the axis, then major axis is 2r / sin θ. Therefore, if major axis is 3, sin θ=2/3. If the major axis was 2, then sin θ=1, which would mean θ=90 degrees, but that&#39;s when the plane is perpendicular, resulting in a circle. That seems contradictory.Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the definition of θ. Let me verify the standard result. When a plane intersects a cylinder at an angle θ (with 0 &lt; θ &lt; 90 degrees), then the major axis is 2r / sin θ, and the minor axis is 2r. Therefore, the ratio major/minor is 1 / sin θ. So in this problem, the ratio is 3/2. Therefore, 1 / sin θ=3/2, so sin θ=2/3. Then major axis is 2 / (2/3)=3. Therefore, the answer is (E) 3. That must be correct.Therefore, the earlier case where the major axis was 2 must be incorrect, or perhaps corresponds to a different definition. Wait, in the parametrization where the plane is z = m y, when m=2/3, the ellipse has major axis 2 and minor axis 4/3. But according to the standard result, the minor axis should be 2r=2. Therefore, there must be a conflict here. So perhaps my parametrization is flawed.Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the parametrization z = m y, the coordinate system in the plane is not aligned with the major and minor axes of the ellipse. Therefore, the equation x² + (z/m)^2=1 is in the plane&#39;s coordinate system, but if the plane is tilted, the actual major and minor axes might not align with the coordinate axes, so we need to diagonalize the equation or rotate the coordinate system.Ah, right! That must be it. In my previous parametrization, I assumed the ellipse is aligned with the coordinate axes in the plane, but that might not be the case. So perhaps the equation x² + (z/m)^2=1 is actually not the standard form of the ellipse because the plane&#39;s coordinates are not aligned with the principal axes.Therefore, I need to perform a rotation to find the actual major and minor axes. Let me try that.Suppose the plane is given by z = m y. In this plane, we can use coordinates (x, z), where y = z/m. The equation of the cylinder is x² + y² =1, which becomes x² + (z/m)^2=1. This is indeed an ellipse, but the major and minor axes depend on the value of m. However, if m ≠1, the axes of the ellipse are along the x and z directions. If m &gt;1, then the semi-major axis is m along the z-axis, semi-minor axis is 1 along the x-axis. If m &lt;1, then semi-major axis is 1 along x, semi-minor axis is m along z. Therefore, in the plane&#39;s coordinate system, the major and minor axes are along the coordinate axes. Therefore, the previous reasoning holds.But according to the standard result, the minor axis should be 2, but in this case, if m &lt;1, the minor axis is 2m. Therefore, there must be a conflict. Therefore, my mistake must be in the parametrization. Wait, perhaps in the standard result, the angle θ is the angle between the plane and the axis, but in this parametrization, m is the slope of the plane, which relates to a different angle.Let me compute the angle θ between the plane z = m y and the horizontal plane. The normal vector to the plane z = m y is (0, -m, 1). The angle between this normal vector and the vertical axis (0,0,1) is given by the dot product: cos φ = (0*0 + (-m)*0 +1*1)/ (sqrt(0^2 + m^2 +1^2)*sqrt(0^2 +0^2 +1^2)) )= 1 / sqrt(m² +1). Therefore, φ = arccos(1 / sqrt(m² +1)). The angle θ between the plane and the horizontal plane is complementary to φ, so θ = 90° - φ. Then, sin θ = sin(90° - φ) = cos φ =1 / sqrt(m² +1). Therefore, according to the standard result, major axis is 2 / sin θ=2*sqrt(m² +1). The minor axis is 2. Therefore, according to this, the major axis is 2*sqrt(m² +1). The problem states major is 1.5 times minor, so 2*sqrt(m² +1)=1.5*2 =&gt; sqrt(m² +1)=1.5 =&gt; m² +1=2.25 =&gt; m²=1.25 =&gt; m=√(5)/2≈1.118. Therefore, major axis is 3, which matches the standard result. Therefore, in the previous parametrization where we have z = m y, the major axis is not simply 2m or 2, but rather 2*sqrt(m² +1). Therefore, I must have made a mistake earlier when interpreting the ellipse&#39;s axes.Wait, wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me go step by step.First, standard result: When a plane intersects a cylinder at angle θ with the axis, major axis is 2r / sin θ, minor axis is 2r. So with r=1, major axis is 2 / sin θ, minor axis is 2. Then, given that major is 1.5 minor, so 2 / sin θ =1.5*2 =&gt; sin θ=2/3. Therefore, major axis is 3. So answer is (E).But in the parametrization with z = m y, let&#39;s compute the major axis using the standard result. The angle θ between the plane and the axis is θ=arcsin(2/3). Then, the relation to the slope m: The plane z = m y has normal vector (0, -m,1). The angle between the plane and the axis is θ, so the angle between the normal vector and the vertical axis is φ=90° - θ. Then, cos φ=1 / sqrt(m² +1)=sin θ=2/3. Therefore, 1 / sqrt(m² +1)=2/3 =&gt; sqrt(m² +1)=3/2 =&gt; m² +1=9/4 =&gt; m²=5/4 =&gt; m=√5 /2 ≈1.118. Then, in the plane z = m y, the ellipse equation in that plane is x² + (z/m)^2=1. But according to the standard result, the major axis is 3, but according to this equation, the semi-axes are 1 and m=√5 /2≈1.118, so major axis is 2*1.118≈2.236, which is not 3. Contradiction.Therefore, my mistake must be that the equation x² + (z/m)^2=1 is not accounting for the true major and minor axes. Therefore, the ellipse is actually rotated with respect to the coordinate system in the plane, so we need to perform a rotation to find the principal axes.Let me clarify. If the plane is tilted, the ellipse formed is not aligned with the coordinate system we set up in the plane. Therefore, even though we have an equation x² + (z/m)^2=1, this is in terms of coordinates (x, z) in the tilted plane, but the actual major and minor axes might be rotated with respect to these coordinates.Therefore, to find the true major and minor axes, we need to diagonalize the quadratic form.Given the equation in the plane: x² + (z/m)^2=1. Wait, but in the plane z = m y, if we use coordinates (x, z), then y = z/m. So x² + (z/m)^2=1 is indeed the equation. This is already an ellipse aligned with the x and z axes in the plane. Therefore, if m &gt;1, the major axis is along z with length 2m, minor axis along x with length 2. If m &lt;1, major axis is along x with length 2, minor axis along z with length 2m.But according to the standard result, the major axis should be 3 when the ratio is 1.5. Therefore, the confusion arises because the standard result uses θ as the angle between the plane and the axis, but in this parametrization, the major axis can be along z or x depending on m.Wait, perhaps the standard result assumes that the plane is not only tilted but also that the direction of tilt is such that the major axis is in the direction of the tilt. However, in our parametrization with z = m y, the major axis (if m &gt;1) is along the z-axis, which is the direction of the cylinder&#39;s axis. That doesn&#39;t seem right. If you tilt the plane along the y-z plane, the major axis should be in the direction of the tilt, which would be along the line of intersection of the plane and the horizontal.Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let&#39;s approach it using vectors.The cylinder x² + y² =1 can be parametrized as (cos θ, sin θ, z). A plane can be represented as a x + b y + c z =d. The intersection of the plane and cylinder is the set of points (cos θ, sin θ, z) that satisfy a cos θ + b sin θ + c z =d.To find the ellipse equation, we can express z in terms of θ: z=(d - a cos θ - b sin θ)/c. Then, substituting back into the parametrization, we have the coordinates (cos θ, sin θ, (d - a cos θ - b sin θ)/c). To express this in terms of the plane&#39;s coordinates, we need to choose a coordinate system on the plane.Alternatively, consider that the intersection curve lies on both the cylinder and the plane. The cylinder has a circular cross-section, and the plane cuts it at an angle, resulting in an ellipse. The major axis of the ellipse is the longest possible chord in the ellipse, which occurs in the direction of the intersection line of the plane and the cylinder&#39;s horizontal plane. The length of the major axis can be calculated by considering the maximum distance between two points on the intersection curve.Alternatively, use the formula for the length of the major axis of an ellipse formed by cutting a cylinder with a plane inclined at an angle θ. The formula is major axis length = 2r / sin θ, as per standard geometrical results. Given that the ratio major/minor = 3/2, and minor axis =2r=2, then major axis=3, so answer is (E).Given the standard result is 2r/sin θ, and given that ratio is 3/2, then this leads to major axis=3. Therefore, answer is (E).But why in the parametrization with z = m y, do we get a different result? Because in that case, if the major axis is along z with length 2m, then according to that parametrization, if major axis is 3, m=1.5. But according to the standard result, the slope m relates to the angle θ. Let&#39;s compute the angle θ in that case.If the plane is z =1.5 y, the normal vector is (0, -1.5,1). The angle φ between the normal vector and the vertical (0,0,1) is given by cos φ=1 / sqrt(0 + (1.5)^2 +1^2)=1/sqrt(2.25 +1)=1/sqrt(3.25)=2/sqrt(13). Therefore, φ=arccos(2/sqrt(13)). Then, the angle θ between the plane and the horizontal is 90° - φ. sin θ=sin(90° - φ)=cos φ=2/sqrt(13). Then according to the standard result, major axis=2/sin θ=2/(2/sqrt(13))=sqrt(13)≈3.605, which contradicts the previous result of major axis=3.This inconsistency suggests that either the standard result is incorrect or my parametrization is flawed.Wait, let me check with another source. According to the standard geometric result, when a right circular cylinder is cut by a plane inclined at an angle θ to the axis, the major axis of the resulting ellipse is 2r / sin θ and the minor axis is 2r. The derivation of this can be found in geometry textbooks.Let me confirm this. Imagine a cylinder viewed from the side where the cutting plane is inclined. The intersection appears as an ellipse. The minor axis is the diameter of the cylinder, as it is perpendicular to the direction of the tilt. The major axis is determined by the &quot;stretch&quot; due to the angle. If you look at the cylinder along the direction of the cutting plane, the ellipse&#39;s major axis is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the diameter of the cylinder, and the angle opposite is θ. Therefore, the major axis length is diameter / sin θ. Since the diameter is 2r, major axis is 2r / sin θ. Therefore, if the ratio major/minor is 3/2, then (2r / sin θ)/ (2r)=1 / sin θ=3/2 =&gt; sin θ=2/3. Therefore, θ=arcsin(2/3). Then, major axis=2 / sin θ=3. Therefore, answer is (E) 3.This seems to be a consistent result. Therefore, my previous parametrization must have been incorrect because it did not account for the true orientation of the ellipse&#39;s axes. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 3.But let me think again why the parametrization with z = m y led to a different conclusion. In that case, the major axis was along the z-axis with length 2m, but according to the standard result, the major axis is 3. If m=1.5, then 2m=3, which matches. However, when we calculated the angle θ from the normal vector, the result was sqrt(13)/2, leading to a different major axis. But this must be due to a different definition of θ. In the standard result, θ is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis, but in the parametrization with z = m y, the angle θ (arcsin(2/3)) is different from the angle φ calculated from the normal vector.Actually, θ in the standard result is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis, which is the complement of the angle between the normal vector and the axis. Therefore, if the normal vector makes an angle φ with the vertical, then θ=90° - φ. Therefore, sin θ=cos φ. In the case of the plane z =1.5 y, we had cos φ=2/sqrt(13). Therefore, sin θ=2/sqrt(13). Then major axis=2/sin θ=sqrt(13)/1≈3.605, which contradicts the standard result. Therefore, there is an inconsistency.Wait, this suggests that my understanding is incorrect. Perhaps the standard result is not applicable here, or the parametrization is different.Alternatively, let me calculate using the parametrization.For the plane z = m y, the intersection with the cylinder x² + y²=1 is the set of points (x, y, m y) where x² + y²=1. To find the major and minor axes of this ellipse, we can consider the projection onto the plane.But since the plane is z = m y, we can use coordinates (x, z) in the plane, with y = z/m. The equation becomes x² + (z/m)^2=1. This is an ellipse with semi-axes a=1 and b=m. If m &gt;1, then the major axis is 2m, if m &lt;1, it&#39;s 2. Therefore, if the major axis is 1.5 times the minor axis, we have two cases:Case 1: m &gt;1, major axis=2m, minor=2. Then 2m=1.5*2 ⇒ m=1.5. So major axis=3. This matches the standard result.Case 2: m &lt;1, major axis=2, minor=2m. Then 2=1.5*2m ⇒ m=2/3. So major axis=2.However, according to the standard result, the major axis is always 2 / sin θ, where θ is the angle between the plane and the axis. If we have two possible solutions, this contradicts the standard result. Therefore, I must reconcile this.Wait, perhaps in Case 2, the angle θ is different. If m=2/3, then the plane&#39;s normal vector is (0, -2/3,1), and angle φ=arccos(1 / sqrt((2/3)^2 +1))=arccos(1 / sqrt(13/9))=arccos(3/sqrt(13)). Therefore, θ=90° - φ=arcsin(3/sqrt(13)). Then sin θ=3/sqrt(13). Therefore, major axis=2/sin θ=2*sqrt(13)/3≈2.403, which doesn&#39;t match the 2 from the parametrization.Therefore, the parametrization suggests two possible solutions, but the standard result gives a unique solution. Therefore, the discrepancy must be because in the parametrization, when m &lt;1, the major axis is not along the direction of the intersection line between the plane and the horizontal plane, but along the x-axis. However, the standard result assumes that the major axis is along the direction of the intersection line.Therefore, the parametrization&#39;s major axis when m &lt;1 is actually the minor axis in reality, and vice versa. But that contradicts the definition of major and minor axes. Hence, the confusion arises from the coordinate system in the plane.Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the standard result where the major axis is determined by the angle θ between the plane and the axis, leading to a unique solution of 3. Hence, the answer is (E) 3.Thus, after resolving the confusion, I think the correct answer is boxed{E}.Final Answerboxed{E}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the major axis of the ellipse formed by the intersection of a plane with a right circular cylinder of radius 1, given that the major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis.1. Understanding the Intersection:   - The intersection of a plane with a right circular cylinder can form an ellipse if the plane is not parallel to the base or the side of the cylinder.   - The minor axis of the ellipse is the diameter of the cylinder&#39;s base, which is 2 (since the radius is 1).2. Key Relationships:   - The major axis is 50% longer than the minor axis. Let the minor axis be (2) (the diameter of the cylinder). Therefore, the major axis should be (1.5 times 2 = 3).3. Verification Using Standard Results:   - When a plane intersects a cylinder at an angle (theta) with the axis, the major axis of the resulting ellipse is given by ( frac{2r}{sin theta} ) and the minor axis is (2r) (where (r) is the radius of the cylinder).   - Given (r = 1), the minor axis is (2). For the major axis to be 50% longer than the minor axis, we have:     [     frac{2}{sin theta} = 1.5 times 2 implies sin theta = frac{2}{3}     ]   - Substituting (sin theta = frac{2}{3}) into the formula for the major axis:     [     text{Major axis} = frac{2}{sin theta} = frac{2}{frac{2}{3}} = 3     ]4. Conclusion:   - The length of the major axis is (3), which corresponds to option (E).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{E}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-39a2a286></div><p class="review-content" data-v-39a2a286><span class="icon" data-v-39a2a286>🔑:</span>18E18.

It seems a bit complex with all the fractions and overlapping categories, but I&#39;ll take it step by step. First, let me parse the information given. The athletes can be in three categories: cheerful (C), trained (T), or beginners (B). Each athlete is in at least one category. There are some overlapping ratios and some specific numbers given. The goal is to find the total number of athletes, which is no more than 150.Let me note down all the given information:1. Every sixteenth cheerful athlete is a beginner. So, if C is the number of cheerful athletes, then the number of athletes who are both cheerful and beginners (C ∩ B) is C/16.2. One-fifth of the beginners are cheerful. So, if B is the number of beginners, then C ∩ B = B/5.3. One-fifth of the trained athletes are cheerful. If T is the number of trained athletes, then T ∩ C = T/5.4. Only one-tenth of the cheerful athletes are trained. So, T ∩ C = C/10.5. One-fifth of the beginners are trained. So, T ∩ B = B/5.6. One-eighth of the trained athletes are beginners. So, T ∩ B = T/8.7. Only three participants are trained, cheerful beginners simultaneously. So, the intersection of all three categories (T ∩ C ∩ B) is 3.Also, the total number of athletes is no more than 150.Hmm. This looks like a problem that involves overlapping sets and using Venn diagrams with given ratios. Let me try to model this using set theory equations.Let me denote:- C: number of cheerful athletes- T: number of trained athletes- B: number of beginner athletesWe need to find C ∪ T ∪ B, which is the total number of athletes. But since every athlete is in at least one category, the total is simply the union of all three sets. However, because of overlaps, we need to use inclusion-exclusion:Total = C + T + B - (C ∩ T + C ∩ B + T ∩ B) + (C ∩ T ∩ B)But since we have ratios between the intersections and the individual sets, maybe we can express all intersections in terms of C, T, or B, and then solve for those variables.Given that there are overlaps, but also given specific ratios. Let&#39;s see.From the problem:1. C ∩ B = C / 16 (every sixteenth cheerful is a beginner)2. C ∩ B = B / 5 (one-fifth of beginners are cheerful)So, from 1 and 2: C / 16 = B / 5. Therefore, 5C = 16B =&gt; C = (16/5)B.Similarly, from the next pair:3. T ∩ C = T / 5 (one-fifth of trained are cheerful)4. T ∩ C = C / 10 (one-tenth of cheerful are trained)Therefore, T / 5 = C / 10 =&gt; T = (C / 10)*5 =&gt; T = C / 2. So, T = C/2.Another pair:5. T ∩ B = B / 5 (one-fifth of beginners are trained)6. T ∩ B = T / 8 (one-eighth of trained are beginners)So, B / 5 = T / 8 =&gt; B = (5/8)T.But earlier we have T = C / 2. So substituting into B:B = (5/8)(C / 2) = (5/16)C.But earlier from C = (16/5)B, substituting B = (5/16)C into that:C = (16/5)*(5/16)C =&gt; C = C. That checks out, so consistent.So, let&#39;s summarize the relationships so far:From 1 and 2: C = (16/5)BFrom 3 and 4: T = C/2From 5 and 6: B = (5/16)CBut wait, substituting T = C/2 into B = (5/8)T gives B = (5/8)*(C/2) = (5/16)C, which matches B = (5/16)C. So all the relationships are consistent.So, all variables can be expressed in terms of C. Let me note that:T = C / 2B = (5 / 16) CSo, if we can find C, we can find T and B.Additionally, we know that the intersection of all three categories (T ∩ C ∩ B) is 3. Let&#39;s denote this as x = 3.In inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of athletes is:Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + (C∩T∩B)But we need to be careful here. The intersections like C∩T, C∩B, T∩B include the triple intersection. So, when we subtract the pairwise intersections, we have subtracted the triple intersection three times. Then, we add it back once. So, the formula is:Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + (C∩T∩B)But in our case, we have:C∩T = number of athletes who are both cheerful and trained. However, this includes those who are also beginners. Similarly for the other intersections.But according to the given information:From points 3 and 4: T ∩ C = T/5 = C/10Similarly, from points 1 and 2: C ∩ B = C/16 = B/5From points 5 and 6: T ∩ B = B/5 = T/8But these intersections (C∩T, C∩B, T∩B) include those who are in all three categories. So, for example, C∩T includes those who are in C, T, and B. Therefore, the intersection C∩T is equal to (C∩T∩B) + (C∩T not B). Similarly for others.But given that we know the triple overlap is 3, maybe we can express the pairwise intersections in terms of the triple overlap. Wait, but from the given ratios, the intersections C∩T, C∩B, T∩B are given as total intersections, including the triple overlap. For example, T ∩ C is T/5, which is equal to C/10, and this includes those who are also in B.So, if we denote:C∩T = T/5 = C/10C∩B = C/16 = B/5T∩B = B/5 = T/8But each of these intersections includes the triple overlap. So, if we let x = C∩T∩B = 3, then:C∩T = x + (C∩T not B)But according to the given ratios, C∩T is T/5, which is equal to C/10. So, if we can express T and C in terms of C, as we did before, then maybe we can find the necessary overlaps.Wait, perhaps the key is that we have the triple overlap x = 3, and the pairwise overlaps (C∩T, C∩B, T∩B) can be expressed in terms of C, T, or B, but we need to check if these pairwise overlaps include the triple overlap or not.But according to the problem statements:- Every sixteenth cheerful athlete is a beginner. So, of all cheerful athletes (C), 1/16 are also beginners. This would include those who are also trained. So, C∩B = C/16, which includes the triple overlap.Similarly, one-fifth of the beginners are cheerful, so B∩C = B/5, which again includes the triple overlap.Same with the other intersections. So, all these ratios given are for the total pairwise intersections, including those who are in all three categories.Therefore, the pairwise intersections (C∩T, C∩B, T∩B) are known as:C∩T = T/5 = C/10C∩B = C/16 = B/5T∩B = B/5 = T/8But each of these includes the triple overlap x = 3.Wait, but if that&#39;s the case, then:For example, C∩T = T/5. But C∩T includes those who are only in C and T, plus those in all three. So, if we denote the number of people only in C and T as (C∩T) - x, then:(C∩T) = (number of only C∩T) + xBut according to given, (C∩T) = T/5, so:T/5 = (number of only C∩T) + 3But maybe we don&#39;t need that for the total. Let me see.Alternatively, since the total number of athletes is given by inclusion-exclusion:Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + (C∩T∩B)We can plug in all the values.We have expressions for C∩T, C∩B, T∩B in terms of C, T, or B. Let&#39;s note that:From previous relations:C = (16/5)BT = C/2 = (16/5)B / 2 = (8/5)BTherefore, all variables can be expressed in terms of B.Wait, let&#39;s see:If we let B be a variable, then:C = (16/5)BT = (8/5)BAlso, from the intersection relations:C∩T = T/5 = (8/5)B / 5 = (8/25)BSimilarly, C∩B = C/16 = (16/5)B /16 = (16/5)B * 1/16 = (1/5)BT∩B = B/5And C∩T∩B = 3So, substituting all into inclusion-exclusion:Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + (C∩T∩B)Plugging in:Total = (16/5)B + (8/5)B + B - [(8/25)B + (1/5)B + (1/5)B] + 3Let me compute each part step by step.First, C + T + B:= (16/5)B + (8/5)B + BConvert B to fifths: B = 5/5 BTotal = (16 + 8 + 5)/5 B = 29/5 BThen, subtract the intersections:C∩T + C∩B + T∩B = (8/25)B + (1/5)B + (1/5)BConvert to 25 denominators:= (8/25)B + (5/25)B + (5/25)B = (8 + 5 + 5)/25 B = 18/25 BSo, subtract 18/25 B:Total so far: 29/5 B - 18/25 BConvert 29/5 to 145/25:145/25 B - 18/25 B = 127/25 BThen, add the triple intersection:Total = 127/25 B + 3So, Total = (127/25)B + 3But we also know that Total ≤ 150.But we need another equation to relate B to the triple intersection. Wait, do we have any other information?Wait, the problem states that three participants are in all three categories. But we already used that in the inclusion-exclusion formula.Wait, but is there a relation between the triple intersection and the pairwise intersections?Wait, in a standard Venn diagram for three sets, the number of elements in all three sets is subtracted three times and added back once. But in our inclusion-exclusion formula, we already accounted for that by adding it back at the end.But maybe we need to ensure that the triple intersection is consistent with the pairwise intersections.For example, in C∩T, which is 8/25 B, this includes the triple overlap of 3. Similarly, C∩B is 1/5 B, which also includes the 3, and T∩B is 1/5 B, which includes the 3.Therefore, the number of people in exactly two categories would be:For exactly C and T: (C∩T) - x = (8/25 B) - 3Exactly C and B: (C∩B) - x = (1/5 B) - 3Exactly T and B: (T∩B) - x = (1/5 B) - 3But we need these numbers to be non-negative, since you can&#39;t have a negative number of people. So:(8/25 B) - 3 ≥ 0 =&gt; 8/25 B ≥ 3 =&gt; B ≥ (3 * 25)/8 = 75/8 = 9.375Similarly, (1/5 B) - 3 ≥ 0 =&gt; B ≥ 15So, the more restrictive condition is B ≥ 15.But since B must be an integer (number of people), B must be at least 15.Also, since all the intersections must result in integer numbers. For example, C∩T = 8/25 B must be an integer because you can&#39;t have a fraction of a person. Similarly, C∩B = 1/5 B must be an integer, and T∩B = 1/5 B must be an integer. Also, the triple intersection is 3, so all these must hold.Therefore:1/5 B must be integer =&gt; B must be a multiple of 5.8/25 B must be integer =&gt; since 8 and 25 are coprime, B must be a multiple of 25.So, B must be a multiple of 25 (LCM of 5 and 25 is 25). Therefore, B is a multiple of 25.Also, since B ≥ 15, the smallest possible B is 25.But let&#39;s check with the other condition. From the triple overlap in exactly C and T: 8/25 B - 3 must be non-negative. If B=25:8/25 *25 -3 = 8 -3 =5 ≥0. Okay.Similarly, 1/5 *25 -3 =5 -3=2 ≥0. Okay.So, B must be multiples of 25. So possible B values: 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150. But since Total = (127/25)B +3 must be ≤150, let&#39;s check.For B=25:Total = (127/25)*25 +3 =127 +3=130. 130 ≤150. Okay.B=50:Total= (127/25)*50 +3= 127*2 +3=254 +3=257 &gt;150. Not allowed.Therefore, B=25 is the only possible value.Wait, but B=25 is okay? Let&#39;s check if all the counts are integers.Given B=25:C = (16/5)*25=80T= (8/5)*25=40So, C=80, T=40, B=25.Check the intersections:C∩T= T/5=40/5=8. Which should also be C/10=80/10=8. Correct.C∩B= C/16=80/16=5. Which is B/5=25/5=5. Correct.T∩B= T/8=40/8=5. Which is B/5=25/5=5. Correct.Triple intersection x=3.Therefore, the number of people in exactly two categories:Exactly C and T: 8 -3=5Exactly C and B:5 -3=2Exactly T and B:5 -3=2Number of people only in C: C - (exactly C and T) - (exactly C and B) - x =80 -5 -2 -3=70Only T: T - (exactly C and T) - (exactly T and B) -x=40 -5 -2 -3=30Only B: B - (exactly C and B) - (exactly T and B) -x=25 -2 -2 -3=18So total athletes:Only C + Only T + Only B + Exactly two categories + All three70 +30 +18 + (5+2+2) +3= 70+30=100; 100+18=118; 118+5=123; 123+2=125; 125+2=127; 127+3=130. Which matches the earlier total of 130.But the problem states that the numbers given were no more than 150. 130 is ≤150, so that works.But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another possible B. The next multiple of 25 is 50, which would make Total=257, which is over 150, so invalid. Therefore, B=25, Total=130.But wait, the problem says &quot;they were given no more than 150 numbers,&quot; so the total number of athletes is 130. But let me double-check if this is correct.Wait, in the problem statement, it says &quot;only three participants in the marathon are trained, cheerful beginners simultaneously.&quot; So, the triple overlap is 3. In our calculation, that&#39;s accounted for, and the total comes out to 130. So, 130 is ≤150, so that&#39;s a possible answer.Is there a smaller B? The next possible multiple of 25 is 25, then 50, etc. If B=25 gives total=130. If B=0, but that&#39;s impossible since there are participants. So 25 is the minimum. Therefore, the answer is 130.But let me check once again for errors.Given C=80, T=40, B=25.C∩T=8, C∩B=5, T∩B=5, triple=3.Only C: 80 -8 -5 +3=70 (Wait, inclusion-exclusion for only C is C - (C∩T + C∩B - C∩T∩B)). Wait, no. The formula for only C is C - (C∩T + C∩B - C∩T∩B). Wait, let me recall.The number of elements only in C is:C - (number in C∩T + number in C∩B - number in C∩T∩B)Wait, but actually, if you subtract C∩T and C∩B from C, you have subtracted the triple overlap twice. So, you need to add it back once.Therefore:Only C = C - (C∩T + C∩B - C∩T∩B)Similarly,Only T = T - (C∩T + T∩B - C∩T∩B)Only B = B - (C∩B + T∩B - C∩T∩B)Therefore:Only C = 80 - (8 +5 -3)=80 -10=70Only T=40 - (8 +5 -3)=40 -10=30Only B=25 - (5 +5 -3)=25 -7=18Exactly two categories:C∩T only=8 -3=5C∩B only=5 -3=2T∩B only=5 -3=2Triple=3Total=70+30+18 +5+2+2 +3=70+30=100; 100+18=118; 118+5=123; 123+2=125; 125+2=127; 127+3=130. Correct.So, all numbers check out, and 130 is ≤150. Therefore, the total number of athletes is 130.Wait, but let me just verify with another approach to ensure.Given that Total = (127/25)B +3.If B=25, then Total=127 +3=130. If B=50, Total=254 +3=257&gt;150, which is invalid.So, the only possible value is 130. Therefore, the answer is 130.Final AnswerThe number of athletes who started the race is boxed{130}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of athletes in the marathon, categorized into cheerful (C), trained (T), and beginners (B), with the following conditions:1. Every sixteenth cheerful athlete is a beginner: ( C cap B = frac{C}{16} )2. One-fifth of the beginners are cheerful: ( C cap B = frac{B}{5} )3. One-fifth of the trained athletes are cheerful: ( T cap C = frac{T}{5} )4. One-tenth of the cheerful athletes are trained: ( T cap C = frac{C}{10} )5. One-fifth of the beginners are trained: ( T cap B = frac{B}{5} )6. One-eighth of the trained athletes are beginners: ( T cap B = frac{T}{8} )7. Three participants are trained, cheerful, and beginners simultaneously: ( T cap C cap B = 3 )We derive the relationships between the sets:- From conditions 1 and 2: ( frac{C}{16} = frac{B}{5} implies 5C = 16B implies C = frac{16}{5}B )- From conditions 3 and 4: ( frac{T}{5} = frac{C}{10} implies T = frac{C}{2} )- From conditions 5 and 6: ( frac{B}{5} = frac{T}{8} implies B = frac{5}{8}T )Expressing T and B in terms of C:- ( T = frac{C}{2} )- ( B = frac{5}{16}C )Using the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the total number of athletes:[text{Total} = C + T + B - (C cap T + C cap B + T cap B) + (C cap T cap B)]Substituting the values:- ( C = frac{16}{5}B )- ( T = frac{8}{5}B )- ( C cap T = frac{8}{25}B )- ( C cap B = frac{1}{5}B )- ( T cap B = frac{1}{5}B )- ( C cap T cap B = 3 )Calculating the total:[text{Total} = frac{16}{5}B + frac{8}{5}B + B - left( frac{8}{25}B + frac{1}{5}B + frac{1}{5}B right) + 3][= frac{29}{5}B - frac{18}{25}B + 3][= frac{127}{25}B + 3]Since the total number of athletes must be an integer and no more than 150, we find ( B ) must be a multiple of 25. Testing ( B = 25 ):- ( C = 80 )- ( T = 40 )- Total = ( frac{127}{25} times 25 + 3 = 130 )Thus, the number of athletes who started the race is (boxed{130}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to tackle this marathon athlete problem. It seems a bit complex with all these fractions and overlapping categories, but I&#39;ll take it step by step. First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the given information.We have athletes categorized into at least one of three categories: cheerful (C), trained (T), or beginners (B). So, each athlete is in at least one category, but could be in two or all three.The problem gives several relationships:1. Every sixteenth cheerful athlete is a beginner. So, the number of athletes who are both cheerful and beginners (C ∩ B) is 1/16 of the total number of cheerful athletes (C). So, (C ∩ B) = C / 16.2. One-fifth of the beginners are cheerful. So, (C ∩ B) = B / 5.3. One-fifth of the trained athletes are cheerful. So, (C ∩ T) = T / 5.4. Only one-tenth of the cheerful athletes are trained. So, (C ∩ T) = C / 10.5. One-fifth of the beginners are trained. So, (T ∩ B) = B / 5.6. One-eighth of the trained athletes are beginners. So, (T ∩ B) = T / 8.Additionally, there are three participants who are in all three categories: trained, cheerful, and beginners (C ∩ T ∩ B) = 3.We need to find the total number of athletes, given that the numbers were no more than 150.Okay, let&#39;s start writing down these relationships with variables. Maybe using set theory and Venn diagrams would help here. Since there are three overlapping categories, a three-circle Venn diagram would represent all possible overlaps.Let me denote:- C: number of cheerful athletes- T: number of trained athletes- B: number of beginner athletesWe also have overlaps:- CB = C ∩ B (but not T)- CT = C ∩ T (but not B)- TB = T ∩ B (but not C)- CTB = C ∩ T ∩ B = 3So, the total number of athletes would be C + T + B - (CB + CT + TB) + CTB. Wait, no, actually, the inclusion-exclusion principle says:Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + (C∩T∩B).But since each athlete is in at least one category, there are no athletes outside these three categories. So, Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + (C∩T∩B).But let me check again. For three sets, inclusion-exclusion formula is:|C ∪ T ∪ B| = |C| + |T| + |B| - |C∩T| - |C∩B| - |T∩B| + |C∩T∩B|.Since all athletes are in at least one category, the total number is equal to |C ∪ T ∪ B|, which is the sum above.So, Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + 3.But the problem mentions that each athlete is in at least one category, so that&#39;s our total. Now, we need to relate these overlaps with the given fractions.First, let&#39;s note the given relationships:1. Every sixteenth cheerful athlete is a beginner. So, the number of cheerful athletes who are also beginners is C / 16. But wait, that would be C∩B, right? However, C∩B includes those who are only in C and B, and those who are also in T. So, C∩B = CB + CTB. Similarly, the total number of cheerful athletes is C = (only C) + CB + CT + CTB. Similarly for others.But maybe instead of breaking it down into the individual regions (only C, only T, etc.), we can use the overlaps and express the given fractions accordingly.Let me think. Let&#39;s try to write equations based on the given information.From the problem:1. Every sixteenth cheerful athlete is a beginner: So, C∩B = C / 16. But C∩B includes those who are in both C and B, including those also in T. So, C∩B = (CB + CTB) = C / 16.But CB is the number of athletes who are only in C and B, not T, and CTB is the ones in all three. Similarly, the total C is (only C) + CB + CT + CTB.But maybe instead of dealing with the individual regions, we can express the overlaps in terms of C, T, B. Let me see.Given that C∩B = C / 16. But C∩B is also equal to B / 5 (from the second point: one-fifth of the beginners are cheerful). So, we have:C∩B = C / 16 = B / 5.Similarly, from point 3 and 4:C∩T = T / 5 = C / 10.From points 5 and 6:T∩B = B / 5 = T / 8.Additionally, the intersection of all three categories is 3: C∩T∩B = 3.So, let&#39;s note these equations:1. C∩B = C / 16 = B / 5. Therefore, C / 16 = B / 5 ⇒ 5C = 16B ⇒ C = (16/5)B.2. C∩T = T / 5 = C / 10. So, T / 5 = C / 10 ⇒ 10T = 5C ⇒ 2T = C ⇒ C = 2T.3. T∩B = B / 5 = T / 8. So, B / 5 = T / 8 ⇒ 8B = 5T ⇒ T = (8/5)B.Additionally, we have C∩T∩B = 3.Wait, so we have several relationships here. Let&#39;s see if we can express all variables in terms of B and then find B.From equation 1: C = (16/5)B.From equation 3: T = (8/5)B.Also, from equation 2: C = 2T. Let&#39;s check if this is consistent with C = (16/5)B and T = (8/5)B.Yes, because 2T = 2*(8/5)B = (16/5)B = C. So that&#39;s consistent. Good.So, we can express C and T in terms of B.So, C = (16/5)B, T = (8/5)B.Now, let&#39;s handle the overlaps.From equation 1 and 2: C∩B = C / 16 = (16/5)B /16 = (16/5)/16 * B = (1/5)B. Which matches the second part of point 1: one-fifth of the beginners are cheerful. So, C∩B = B / 5. Which is (1/5)B. So, that&#39;s consistent.Similarly, C∩T = T / 5 = (8/5)B /5 = (8/25)B. Also, C∩T = C /10 = (16/5)B /10 = (16/50)B = (8/25)B. So, that&#39;s consistent as well.Similarly, T∩B = B /5 = T /8. Let&#39;s check T /8 = (8/5)B /8 = (8/5)/8 * B = (1/5)B. So, T∩B = (1/5)B, which matches B /5. So, all these equations are consistent.Now, we also know that the intersection of all three categories is 3. So, C∩T∩B = 3.But in our earlier expressions, C∩B = B /5, which includes those who are only in C and B plus those in all three. Similarly, C∩T = T /5, which includes those only in C and T plus all three. Similarly, T∩B = T /8 = B /5, which includes those only in T and B plus all three.So, for example, C∩B = (CB) + CTB = B/5.Similarly, C∩T = (CT) + CTB = T/5.Similarly, T∩B = (TB) + CTB = T/8.But we know that CTB = 3. Therefore, we can solve for CB, CT, TB.Let me write:CB = C∩B - CTB = (B/5) - 3.CT = C∩T - CTB = (T/5) - 3.TB = T∩B - CTB = (T/8) - 3.But since we have C, T in terms of B, maybe we can substitute T = (8/5)B into these equations.So, T = (8/5)B.Therefore,CT = (T/5) - 3 = ((8/5)B)/5 - 3 = (8/25)B - 3.Similarly,TB = (T/8) - 3 = ((8/5)B)/8 - 3 = (1/5)B - 3.CB remains (B/5) - 3.Now, we need to find the total number of athletes. The total number is:Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + CTB.Which, substituting our variables:Total = C + T + B - [ (C∩T) + (C∩B) + (T∩B) ] + 3.But C∩T = T/5, C∩B = B/5, T∩B = T/8.So, Total = C + T + B - (T/5 + B/5 + T/8) + 3.But let&#39;s substitute C and T in terms of B:C = (16/5)BT = (8/5)BSo,Total = (16/5)B + (8/5)B + B - [ ( (8/5)B )/5 + B/5 + ( (8/5)B )/8 ] + 3Let&#39;s compute each part step by step.First, C + T + B:(16/5)B + (8/5)B + B = (16/5 + 8/5 + 5/5)B = (29/5)BNext, subtract [ T/5 + B/5 + T/8 ]:First, T/5 = (8/5)B /5 = (8/25)BB/5 = (1/5)BT/8 = (8/5)B /8 = (1/5)BSo, adding them up:(8/25)B + (1/5)B + (1/5)B = (8/25 + 5/25 + 5/25)B = (18/25)BSo, subtracting that from the previous total:(29/5)B - (18/25)B = (145/25 - 18/25)B = (127/25)BThen, add 3:Total = (127/25)B + 3.So, Total = (127/25)B + 3.But we need to find the value of B such that Total is an integer (since the number of athletes must be a whole number) and Total ≤ 150.Additionally, the overlaps CB, CT, TB must be non-negative since you can&#39;t have a negative number of athletes. So, let&#39;s check that.From earlier:CB = (B/5) - 3 ≥ 0 ⇒ B/5 ≥ 3 ⇒ B ≥ 15CT = (8/25)B - 3 ≥ 0 ⇒ (8/25)B ≥ 3 ⇒ B ≥ (3 * 25)/8 = 75/8 = 9.375 ⇒ Since B must be an integer, B ≥ 10. But since CB requires B ≥15, that&#39;s the stricter condition.Similarly, TB = (1/5)B - 3 ≥ 0 ⇒ B/5 ≥3 ⇒ B ≥15, same as CB.So, B must be at least 15.Also, since C = (16/5)B, T = (8/5)B, these must be integers as well because the number of athletes in each category must be whole numbers. So:C = (16/5)B must be integer ⇒ 16B must be divisible by 5 ⇒ B must be divisible by 5.Similarly, T = (8/5)B must be integer ⇒ 8B must be divisible by 5 ⇒ B must be divisible by 5.Therefore, B must be a multiple of 5.So, possible values for B are 15, 20, 25, ..., up to such that Total = (127/25)B + 3 ≤150.Let&#39;s find the maximum B such that Total ≤150.(127/25)B +3 ≤150(127/25)B ≤147Multiply both sides by 25:127B ≤ 3675B ≤ 3675 /127 ≈28.937Since B must be a multiple of 5 and at least 15, possible B values are 15, 20, 25.But let&#39;s check which of these makes C and T integers.Since B must be divisible by 5, let&#39;s take B =15:C = (16/5)*15 = 48T = (8/5)*15 =24Check if CT, CB, TB are integers:CB = (15/5) -3 = 3 -3 =0CT = (8/25)*15 -3 = (120/25) -3 = 4.8 -3 =1.8 → Not integer. So, invalid.Therefore, B=15 is invalid because CT is 1.8, which is not an integer. So, B=15 is out.Next, B=20:C=(16/5)*20=64T=(8/5)*20=32CB= (20/5)-3=4-3=1CT= (8/25)*20 -3= (160/25) -3=6.4 -3=3.4 → Not integer. So invalid.B=20 is invalid.Next, B=25:C=(16/5)*25=80T=(8/5)*25=40CB=25/5 -3=5 -3=2CT=(8/25)*25 -3=8 -3=5TB=(1/5)*25 -3=5 -3=2All these overlaps are integers. Good.Check if Total = (127/25)*25 +3 =127 +3=130.Which is ≤150. So that&#39;s valid.Let&#39;s check if there are higher B&#39;s. Next would be B=30, but 127/25*30 +3= (127*30)/25 +3= (3810)/25 +3=152.4 +3=155.4&gt;150, which exceeds the limit. So B=25 is the maximum possible.Thus, Total=130 athletes.But wait, let me confirm with the overlaps and ensure that all numbers are consistent.Given B=25, C=80, T=40.Compute the regions:C∩B = B/5 =25/5=5. But C∩B includes CB + CTB=5. Since CTB=3, then CB=5-3=2. Which matches our earlier calculation.Similarly, C∩T= T/5=40/5=8. Which is CT + CTB=8. So, CT=8-3=5. Which matches.T∩B= T/8=40/8=5. Which is TB + CTB=5. So TB=5-3=2. Which matches.Now, let&#39;s compute the total number of athletes using inclusion-exclusion.Total = C + T + B - (C∩T + C∩B + T∩B) + C∩T∩BTotal =80 +40 +25 - (8 +5 +5) +3Compute:80 +40 +25 =1458 +5 +5=18145 -18=127127 +3=130So, total is 130. Which is ≤150, so that&#39;s acceptable.Additionally, check that all individual regions are non-negative and integers:Only C: C - (CB + CT + CTB) =80 - (2 +5 +3)=80 -10=70Only T: T - (CT + TB + CTB)=40 - (5 +2 +3)=40 -10=30Only B: B - (CB + TB + CTB)=25 - (2 +2 +3)=25 -7=18Only CB:2, only CT:5, only TB:2, and CTB:3.So, all regions are non-negative integers.Thus, the total number is 130. Therefore, the answer is 130.Final AnswerThe number of athletes who started the race is boxed{130}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem of categorizing marathon athletes into cheerful (C), trained (T), and beginners (B), we need to determine the total number of athletes with the given conditions and a maximum of 150 participants. Key relationships:1. Every sixteenth cheerful athlete is a beginner: ( C cap B = frac{C}{16} )2. One-fifth of the beginners are cheerful: ( C cap B = frac{B}{5} )3. One-fifth of the trained athletes are cheerful: ( C cap T = frac{T}{5} )4. One-tenth of the cheerful athletes are trained: ( C cap T = frac{C}{10} )5. One-fifth of the beginners are trained: ( T cap B = frac{B}{5} )6. One-eighth of the trained athletes are beginners: ( T cap B = frac{T}{8} )7. Three participants are in all three categories: ( C cap T cap B = 3 )From these relationships, we derive:1. ( frac{C}{16} = frac{B}{5} ) implies ( 5C = 16B ) or ( C = frac{16}{5}B )2. ( frac{T}{5} = frac{C}{10} ) implies ( 2T = C ) or ( C = 2T )3. ( frac{B}{5} = frac{T}{8} ) implies ( 8B = 5T ) or ( T = frac{8}{5}B )Expressing ( C ) and ( T ) in terms of ( B ):- ( C = frac{16}{5}B )- ( T = frac{8}{5}B )Checking intersections:- ( C cap B = frac{B}{5} )- ( C cap T = frac{T}{5} )- ( T cap B = frac{T}{8} )Inclusion-Exclusion Principle for total athletes:[ text{Total} = C + T + B - (C cap T + C cap B + T cap B) + C cap T cap B ]Substituting values:- ( C = frac{16}{5}B )- ( T = frac{8}{5}B )- ( C cap T = frac{8}{25}B )- ( C cap B = frac{B}{5} )- ( T cap B = frac{B}{5} )- ( C cap T cap B = 3 )Calculating total:[ text{Total} = frac{16}{5}B + frac{8}{5}B + B - left( frac{8}{25}B + frac{B}{5} + frac{B}{5} right) + 3 ][ text{Total} = frac{29}{5}B - frac{18}{25}B + 3 ][ text{Total} = frac{127}{25}B + 3 ]Finding ( B ) such that Total ≤ 150 and ( B ) is a multiple of 5:- ( B = 25 ) gives Total = 130Verifying intersections and regions:- All regions are non-negative integers.Thus, the total number of athletes is boxed{130}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-39a2a286></div><p class="review-content" data-v-39a2a286><span class="icon" data-v-39a2a286>🔑:</span>Answer: 130 athletes.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-2b4e9ccb data-v-39a2a286><div class="review" data-v-39a2a286><div class="review-title" data-v-39a2a286><span class="icon" data-v-39a2a286>❓:</span>In some year, a certain number was not a Sunday in any month.

The problem says &quot;In some year, a certain number was not a Sunday in any month. Determine this number.&quot; Hmm. Let me think.First, the key here is that there&#39;s a specific day of the month (the number) that never lands on a Sunday throughout the entire year. So, for example, if the number was 13, we need to check if the 13th of every month in that year wasn&#39;t a Sunday. The answer would be whichever date (like 1st, 2nd, up to 31st) doesn&#39;t have any Sunday in any month of that year.But wait, how does this happen? Well, each month has 28 to 31 days. The first day of the month determines the days of the week for the rest of the month. For example, if January 1st is a Monday, then February 1st would be... well, depending on how many days January has. January has 31 days, which is 3 days more than 28 (4 weeks). So February 1st would be 3 days later in the week, so Thursday. Hmm, right. So each month&#39;s first day shifts by the number of days in the previous month modulo 7.But to find a date that doesn&#39;t occur on a Sunday in any month, we need to check all months and see if there&#39;s a date that&#39;s never a Sunday. Wait, but different months have different lengths. So for example, the 31st can only occur in months that have 31 days, like January, March, May, July, August, October, December. So maybe the 31st is a candidate? Because in months with 30 or fewer days, the 31st doesn&#39;t exist. But the problem says &quot;a certain number was not a Sunday in any month&quot;, so maybe the 31st could be a Sunday in some months but not others. But if the number in question is 31, but in some months it doesn&#39;t exist, but in the months where it does exist, it&#39;s never Sunday. So maybe 31 is possible?Alternatively, maybe a lower number like 30th. Let&#39;s see. February might have 28 or 29 days, so the 30th doesn&#39;t exist there. But in months with 30 or 31 days, the 30th exists. Hmm. But maybe the 30th is never a Sunday in any month of that year. But how?Alternatively, maybe the number is something like the 7th, 14th, 21st, or 28th? But those days would depend on the starting day of the month.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the year, so maybe this is a general problem? Wait, no, the problem says &quot;in some year&quot;. So there exists a year where, for example, the 31st is never a Sunday in any month. So the answer must be a specific number (date) that in some particular year, that date didn&#39;t fall on Sunday in any month. So we need to find which date that is.Alternatively, maybe the answer is 31, because in months where the 31st exists, in a certain year, none of them were Sundays. Or maybe a lower number. Let&#39;s think about how the days shift.Wait, let me consider a year where the first days of each month are arranged such that a particular date never falls on Sunday. For example, if in each month, the 1st is a Monday, then the 7th would be Sunday. Wait, but if the 1st is a different day each month, then the Sundays would be on different dates each month.But maybe in some year, due to the distribution of the starting days of the months, a particular date (like the 31st) never ends up being a Sunday in any of the months where it exists.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 31. Because in order for the 31st to be a Sunday, the first day of the month must be a certain day. Let&#39;s see. If the month has 31 days, then the first day is x, then day 31 would be x + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so the 31st is x + 2 days. So if the 31st is a Sunday, then the first day of the month must be Sunday - 2 days = Friday. So the first day of the month must be Friday. So if in a year, none of the 31-day months started on a Friday, then the 31st would never be a Sunday in that year. Similarly for other dates.Wait, so for a given date, say the nth, in a month with m days, the nth will be a Sunday if the first day of the month is (Sunday - (n-1) mod 7). So if the first day is (7 - (n-1) mod 7) days ahead of Sunday. Wait, maybe better to think in terms of the first day&#39;s weekday.Let me formalize this. Let&#39;s denote that for a given month, if the first day is a certain weekday, then the nth day is (first_day + n - 1) mod 7. To be Sunday, that expression must be 0 (assuming Sunday is 0). So first_day + n - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Therefore, first_day ≡ (1 - n) mod 7. So for the nth day to be a Sunday, the first day of the month must be (1 - n) mod 7.So for each date n, if in a given year, none of the months start on (1 - n) mod 7, then that date n is never a Sunday in any month of that year. So the problem reduces to finding a number n (from 1 to 31) such that there exists a year where none of the months start on (1 - n) mod 7. Then that n is the answer.Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking: is there a number n such that in some year, none of the 12 months began on the weekday (1 - n) mod 7? If yes, then that n is the answer.So we need to check if there exists a year where one of the weekdays (0 to 6) is not used as the first day of any month. Then the corresponding n would be 1 - (that weekday) mod 7, converted to a date.Wait, for example, if in a certain year, none of the months started on a Friday (which is, say, weekday 5), then for n such that (1 - n) mod 7 = 5, n would be 1 - 5 mod 7 = 1 -5 = -4 mod 7 = 3. So n=3. Therefore, the 3rd of each month would not be a Sunday in that year. Wait, no, because the first day is (1 - n) mod 7. If none of the first days are 5 (Friday), then 1 - n ≡ 5 mod 7 ⇒ n ≡ 1 -5 ≡ -4 ≡ 3 mod 7. So n=3, 10, 17, 24, 31. But n can only be up to 31. Wait, but if n=3, then if a month starts on Friday (5), then the 3rd would be Sunday. But if no month starts on Friday, then the 3rd would never be a Sunday. So the date 3 would not be a Sunday in any month. Similarly, dates 10, 17, 24, 31 would also depend on the starting day.Wait, but n=31 is a special case because only certain months have 31 days. So even if a month starts on a certain day that would make the 31st a Sunday, if that month doesn&#39;t have 31 days, then the 31st doesn&#39;t exist. So, for example, if a year has no 31-day months starting on Friday, then the 31st would never be a Sunday. But if other months (non-31-day months) could have the 31st, but they don&#39;t exist. So the key here is that for the 31st to be a Sunday in a month, the month must have 31 days and start on Friday. Therefore, if none of the 31-day months in a year start on Friday, then the 31st is never a Sunday. Similarly for other dates.So, perhaps 31 is a possible answer. Because if in a year, all the months with 31 days don&#39;t start on Friday, then the 31st would never be a Sunday. So the question is: does there exist a year where none of the 31-day months start on Friday?Similarly, maybe another date like 30th. For the 30th to be a Sunday, the first day must be (1 - 30) mod 7 = (1 - 30) = -29 mod 7. Let&#39;s compute that: 30 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 2. So -29 mod 7 is (-28 -1) mod 7 = (-1) mod 7 = 6. So first_day ≡ 6 mod 7, which is Saturday. So if the first day is Saturday, then the 30th is Sunday. So if none of the months that have 30 or 31 days start on Saturday, then the 30th would never be a Sunday. But months with 30 days are April, June, September, November. So if none of these start on Saturday, and none of the 31-day months start on Friday (as that would affect the 31st), then maybe 30th or 31st are candidates.But the problem is not specifying the year, so we need to find a number that in some year, it&#39;s never a Sunday. So the answer could be 31, if such a year exists where all 31-day months don&#39;t start on Friday.Alternatively, maybe a lower number. Let&#39;s think. For example, the 1st. For the 1st to be a Sunday, the first day of the month must be Sunday. So if in a year, no month starts on Sunday, then the 1st is never a Sunday. But is there a year where no months start on Sunday? Probably not, because there are 12 months, and the starting days cycle through the weekdays. So with 12 months, it&#39;s likely that each weekday is used at least once. Wait, but 12 months, 7 weekdays. 12 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 5. So in any given year, there must be at least 12 - 7 = 5 weekdays that are used at least twice, but it&#39;s possible that two weekdays are not used. Wait, no. Let me think again. The first days of the months depend on the lengths of the months. So the number of different weekdays used as first days could vary.But in reality, in a non-leap year, the number of days is 365, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So each date shifts by one weekday each year. For example, if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2024 would be a Monday. But in a leap year, it shifts by two days. So the distribution of the first days of the months can vary each year.But regardless, the key is whether there exists a year where one of the weekdays is not used as the first day of any month. If such a year exists, then the corresponding date (which maps to that weekday) would never be a Sunday in that year.So for example, suppose in a certain year, no month starts on a Thursday. Then for date n, which satisfies (1 - n) ≡ Thursday mod 7. Let&#39;s say Thursday is 4 (if Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, ..., Saturday is 6). Then (1 - n) ≡ 4 mod 7 ⇒ n ≡ 1 -4 ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod 7. So n=4, 11, 18, 25. So those dates (4th, 11th, 18th, 25th) would never be Sundays in that year.But the problem is asking for a specific number, not multiple. So maybe the answer is 31, because it&#39;s possible that in some year, all the 31-day months don&#39;t start on the required day (Friday). But how?Wait, the 31st can only be a Sunday if the month has 31 days and starts on Friday. So if in a particular year, none of the 31-day months start on Friday, then the 31st is never a Sunday. So the question is, does such a year exist?To check that, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s consider a year where January 1st is, say, a Saturday. Then let&#39;s compute the first days of each month.Wait, maybe it&#39;s easier to look for an example. Let&#39;s take a specific year and check.For example, let&#39;s take the year 2021. Let&#39;s check if in 2021, the 31st was ever a Sunday.Wait, January 31, 2021: January 1, 2021 was a Friday. So January 1 is Friday. Then January 31 is Friday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so 30 days later is Friday + 2 = Sunday. Wait, so January 31, 2021 was a Sunday. So in this case, 31 is a Sunday in January. So not a good example.Let&#39;s take another year. For example, 2023.January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So January 31 is Sunday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2. So Sunday + 2 = Tuesday. So January 31, 2023 was a Tuesday. Then March 1, 2023: January has 31 days, February 2023 is 28 days. So from January 1 to March 1: 31 + 28 = 59 days. 59 mod 7 is 3. So March 1 is Sunday + 3 = Wednesday. Then March 31: March 1 is Wednesday, so March 31 is Wednesday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 = 2, so Wednesday + 2 = Friday. So March 31 is Friday. May 1: March has 31 days, April has 30. So from March 1 to May 1: 31 + 30 = 61 days. 61 mod 7 is 5. So May 1 is Wednesday + 5 = Monday. May 31: Monday + 30 days = Monday + 2 = Wednesday. July 1: May has 31 days, June has 30. 31 + 30 = 61 days. 61 mod 7 = 5. So July 1 is Monday + 5 = Saturday. July 31: Saturday + 30 days = Saturday + 2 = Monday. August 1 is Tuesday (July has 31 days, so July 1 to August 1 is 31 days. 31 mod 7 = 3. So Saturday + 3 = Tuesday). August 31: Tuesday + 30 days = Tuesday + 2 = Thursday. October 1: August has 31 days, September has 30. 31 + 30 = 61, mod 7 = 5. So October 1 is Tuesday + 5 = Sunday. October 31: Sunday + 30 days = Sunday + 2 = Tuesday. December 1: October has 31, November has 30. 31 + 30 = 61 mod 7 =5. So December 1 is Sunday +5 = Friday. December 31: Friday + 30 days = Friday + 2 = Sunday. So in 2023, December 31 is a Sunday. So 31 is a Sunday in December 2023. So that&#39;s another example where 31 is a Sunday. Hmm.Wait, so maybe 31 can sometimes be a Sunday. But is there a year where none of the 31-day months start on Friday? Let&#39;s check.Suppose we pick a year where January 1 is a Wednesday. Then let&#39;s compute the first days of each month.January 1: Wednesday.February 1: January has 31 days, so 31 mod 7 = 3. Wednesday + 3 = Saturday.March 1: February has 28 days. Saturday + 0 = Saturday.April 1: March has 31 days, 31 mod 7 = 3. Saturday + 3 = Tuesday.May 1: April has 30 days, 30 mod 7 = 2. Tuesday + 2 = Thursday.June 1: May has 31 days, 31 mod 7 = 3. Thursday + 3 = Sunday.July 1: June has 30 days, 30 mod 7 = 2. Sunday + 2 = Tuesday.August 1: July has 31 days, 31 mod 7 =3. Tuesday + 3 = Friday.September 1: August has 31 days, 31 mod 7=3. Friday +3=Monday.October 1: September has 30 days, 30 mod7=2. Monday +2=Wednesday.November 1: October has 31 days, 31 mod7=3. Wednesday +3=Saturday.December 1: November has 30 days, 30 mod7=2. Saturday +2=Monday.Now, the 31-day months are January, March, May, July, August, October, December. Let&#39;s check their first days:January 1: Wednesday.March 1: Saturday (but March is a 31-day month? Wait, March has 31 days, but March 1 is Saturday. So March 31 would be Saturday + 30 days. 30 mod7=2. Saturday + 2 = Monday. So March 31 is Monday. Not Sunday.Wait, but the starting day of March is Saturday. For March 31 to be a Sunday, the starting day must be Friday. Because starting day + 30 days ≡ Sunday. So starting day = Sunday -30 mod7. 30 mod7=2, so starting day= Sunday -2=Friday. So in this case, March 1 is Saturday, so March 31 is Monday.So March 31 isn&#39;t Sunday. Similarly, let&#39;s check May 1: Thursday. May 31 would be Thursday +30 days=Thursday +2=Saturday. July 1: Tuesday. July 31 is Tuesday +30=Thursday. August 1: Friday. August 31: Friday +30=Sunday. Oh! August 31 is Sunday. So in this case, August 31 is Sunday. So the 31st is a Sunday here.But wait, in this hypothetical year where January 1 is Wednesday, August 31 is a Sunday. So 31 is a Sunday. Therefore, the answer can&#39;t be 31. Unless there exists a year where none of the 31-day months start on Friday. Wait, in this example, August 1 is Friday. August is a 31-day month. August 1 is Friday, so August 31 is Friday +30=Friday +2=Sunday. So yes, August 31 is Sunday. So if August 1 is Friday, then August 31 is Sunday. So if we can find a year where none of the 31-day months start on Friday, then the 31st would never be a Sunday.Is there such a year?Let me try constructing a year where none of the 31-day months start on Friday.Let me try picking a starting day where the 31-day months don&#39;t start on Friday.Let&#39;s assume January 1 is a Sunday.Then:January 1: SundayFebruary 1: Sunday +31 days mod7=3. Sunday +3=WednesdayMarch 1: Wednesday +28 days=Wednesday (since 2020 is a leap year, but wait, if we&#39;re considering a non-leap year, February has 28 days. So if January 1 is Sunday in a non-leap year, then February 1 is Sunday +31 mod7=3. Sunday +3=Wednesday.March 1: Wednesday +28=Wednesday. March has 31 days.April 1: Wednesday +31=Wednesday +3=Saturday.May 1: Saturday +30=Saturday +2=Monday.June 1: Monday +31=Monday +3=Thursday.July 1: Thursday +30=Thursday +2=Saturday.August 1: Saturday +31=Saturday +3=Tuesday.September 1: Tuesday +31=Tuesday +3=Friday.October 1: Friday +30=Friday +2=Sunday.November 1: Sunday +31=Sunday +3=Wednesday.December 1: Wednesday +30=Wednesday +2=Friday.Now, the 31-day months are January, March, May, July, August, October, December.Their starting days:January: SundayMarch: WednesdayMay: MondayJuly: SaturdayAugust: TuesdayOctober: SundayDecember: FridaySo none of these start on Friday except December. Wait, December 1 is Friday. December is a 31-day month. So December 31 would be Friday +30 days=Friday +2=Sunday. So December 31 is Sunday. So in this year, December 31 is a Sunday. Also, December 1 is Friday, which is a 31-day month starting on Friday. Therefore, December 31 is a Sunday. So 31 is a Sunday here.So in this year, 31 is a Sunday in December. So that&#39;s bad. So in this case, even if some 31-day months don&#39;t start on Friday, if even one does, then 31 is a Sunday.So maybe it&#39;s difficult to find a year where no 31-day month starts on Friday. Let&#39;s try another starting day.Let&#39;s try January 1 is a Monday (non-leap year).January 1: MondayFebruary 1: Monday +31=Monday +3=ThursdayMarch 1: Thursday +28=ThursdayApril 1: Thursday +31=Thursday +3=SundayMay 1: Sunday +30=Sunday +2=TuesdayJune 1: Tuesday +31=Tuesday +3=FridayJuly 1: Friday +30=Friday +2=SundayAugust 1: Sunday +31=Sunday +3=WednesdaySeptember 1: Wednesday +31=Wednesday +3=SaturdayOctober 1: Saturday +30=Saturday +2=MondayNovember 1: Monday +31=Monday +3=ThursdayDecember 1: Thursday +30=Thursday +2=SaturdayNow, 31-day months: January, March, May, July, August, October, December.Starting days:January: MondayMarch: ThursdayMay: TuesdayJuly: SundayAugust: WednesdayOctober: MondayDecember: SaturdayNone of these are Friday. Wait, December is a 31-day month starting on Saturday. So December 31 is Saturday +30=Saturday +2=Monday. So no 31st is a Sunday. January 31: Monday +30=Monday +2=Wednesday. March 31: Thursday +30=Thursday +2=Saturday. May 31: Tuesday +30=Tuesday +2=Thursday. July 31: Sunday +30=Sunday +2=Tuesday. August 31: Wednesday +30=Wednesday +2=Friday. October 31: Monday +30=Monday +2=Wednesday. December 31: Saturday +30=Saturday +2=Monday.So in this year, none of the 31st days are Sundays. So in this year (where January 1 is Monday in a non-leap year), none of the 31st days are Sundays. Therefore, the answer is 31.But wait, let&#39;s confirm.In this year, January starts on Monday, so January 31 is Monday +30 days = Monday + 2 = Wednesday.March starts on Thursday, March 31 is Thursday +30 = Thursday +2 = Saturday.May starts on Tuesday, May 31 is Tuesday +30 = Tuesday +2 = Thursday.July starts on Sunday, July 31 is Sunday +30 = Sunday +2 = Tuesday.August starts on Wednesday, August 31 is Wednesday +30 = Wednesday +2 = Friday.October starts on Monday, October 31 is Monday +30 = Monday +2 = Wednesday.December starts on Saturday, December 31 is Saturday +30 = Saturday +2 = Monday.So none of the 31sts are Sundays. So yes, in this year, the 31st is never a Sunday. Therefore, the number is 31.But let me check if this is correct. Wait, in this setup, January 1 is Monday. Let&#39;s confirm the starting days.January 1: MondayFebruary 1: January has 31 days, so 31 mod7=3. Monday +3=Thursday.March 1: February has 28 days. Thursday +0=Thursday.April 1: March has 31 days. Thursday +3=Sunday.May 1: April has 30 days. Sunday +2=Tuesday.June 1: May has 31 days. Tuesday +3=Friday.July 1: June has 30 days. Friday +2=Sunday.August 1: July has 31 days. Sunday +3=Wednesday.September 1: August has 31 days. Wednesday +3=Saturday.October 1: September has 30 days. Saturday +2=Monday.November 1: October has 31 days. Monday +3=Thursday.December 1: November has 30 days. Thursday +2=Saturday.So yeah, all correct. And as computed, none of the 31-day months start on Friday. Therefore, their 31st days are not Sundays. Therefore, in this year, the number 31 is not a Sunday in any month.Therefore, the answer is 31.&lt;/think&gt;To determine which date was not a Sunday in any month of a certain year, we analyze how the starting day of each month affects the days of the week for subsequent dates. A date ( n ) is a Sunday in a month if the first day of that month is congruent to ( (1 - n) mod 7 ). For the 31st to be a Sunday, the first day of the month must be a Friday. If a year exists where none of the 31-day months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) start on a Friday, then the 31st will never be a Sunday.Considering a non-leap year where January 1 is a Monday:- January 1: Monday- February 1: Monday + 31 days ≡ Thursday- March 1: Thursday + 28 days ≡ Thursday- April 1: Thursday + 31 days ≡ Sunday- May 1: Sunday + 30 days ≡ Tuesday- June 1: Tuesday + 31 days ≡ Friday- July 1: Friday + 30 days ≡ Sunday- August 1: Sunday + 31 days ≡ Wednesday- September 1: Wednesday + 31 days ≡ Saturday- October 1: Saturday + 30 days ≡ Monday- November 1: Monday + 31 days ≡ Thursday- December 1: Thursday + 30 days ≡ SaturdayNone of the 31-day months start on a Friday. Checking their 31st days:- January 31: Monday + 30 days ≡ Wednesday- March 31: Thursday + 30 days ≡ Saturday- May 31: Tuesday + 30 days ≡ Thursday- July 31: Sunday + 30 days ≡ Tuesday- August 31: Wednesday + 30 days ≡ Friday- October 31: Monday + 30 days ≡ Wednesday- December 31: Saturday + 30 days ≡ MondayThus, in this year, the 31st is never a Sunday. Therefore, the number is:boxed{31},&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem. The question says that in some year, a certain number (which I assume is a date, like the 1st, 2nd, up to the 31st) was not a Sunday in any month. We need to determine which number that is. Hmm, interesting.First, I need to understand the problem correctly. So, there exists a year where, for example, the 13th never fell on a Sunday in any month of that year. And we have to find such a date number. Or maybe it&#39;s the other way around: there&#39;s a date number that in a particular year, none of the months had that date as a Sunday. Either way, the key is that the date never occurs on a Sunday in that entire year.I think the key here is to consider how the days of the week shift each month. Since months have different numbers of days, the day of the week for a given date will shift by a certain number of days each month. For example, if January has 31 days, then the next month&#39;s same date will be 31 mod 7 = 3 days later in the week. So if January 1st is a Sunday, February 1st would be a Wednesday (since 31 days later is 3 days later in the week).But this depends on the year, right? Because leap years affect February&#39;s length. So maybe the problem is referring to a non-leap year or a leap year? Wait, the problem says &quot;in some year,&quot; so it could be either. But the answer should be a number that in that specific year (whether leap or not) doesn&#39;t have any Sunday on that date.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for a date that can never be a Sunday in any month of a particular year, regardless of the year. But that seems unlikely because the day distributions vary depending on the year.Wait, perhaps the question is looking for a date that doesn&#39;t fall on a Sunday in any month of a certain year. So, for example, in the year 2023, maybe the 31st never falls on a Sunday. Then 31 would be the answer. But since the problem says &quot;in some year,&quot; not necessarily every year, we have to find a number/date that in at least one year, never was a Sunday in any month.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a specific date that, due to the way the days shift, can never be a Sunday in any month of a particular year. Let me think.First, let&#39;s recall that each month has either 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. So the number of days modulo 7 will determine how the days shift. For example:- January has 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3. So if a certain date in January is a Sunday, then the same date in February (if February had that date) would be 3 days later, i.e., Wednesday.- February in a non-leap year has 28 days, which is 0 mod 7. So the next month&#39;s same date (March 1st) would be the same day of the week as February 1st. In a leap year, February has 29 days, so March 1st would be one day later.- March has 31 days (3 mod 7), April has 30 days (2 mod 7), May 31 (3), June 30 (2), July 31 (3), August 31 (3), September 30 (2), October 31 (3), November 30 (2), December 31 (3).So each month, the day of the week shifts by 3, 0 or 2 days depending on the month&#39;s length. So if we know the starting day of the year, we can compute each month&#39;s starting day.But since the problem is about &quot;some year,&quot; maybe we can choose a year where the starting day is such that a particular date never falls on Sunday. But how?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a date that only occurs in certain months (like 31st only occurs in 7 months: Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec). So if the 31st is to be a Sunday in any of those months, the 1st of those months must be a certain day. For example, if January 1st is a Friday, then January 31st is Sunday (since 31 days later is 3 days later in the week). Wait, 31 days is 3 weeks and 3 days, so adding 3 days. So if January 1 is Friday, then January 31 is Friday + 3 days = Monday. Wait, that&#39;s not right. Wait, no, 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so 3 days ahead. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then January 29 is Sunday, 30 is Monday, 31 is Tuesday. So January 31 would be Tuesday. Then February 1 would be Wednesday (if non-leap year). But in a leap year, February 1 would be Thursday.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s better to model an example. Let&#39;s take a specific year and check. Let&#39;s take 2023, which is a non-leap year. Let&#39;s see what days certain dates fell on.In 2023, January 1 was a Sunday. So January 1: Sunday. Then January 31 would be 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 30 days later is Tuesday. So January 31 is Tuesday. Then February 1 is Wednesday. February has 28 days, so March 1 is also Wednesday. March 31 is 30 days later: 30 mod 7 is 2, so March 31 is Wednesday + 2 = Friday. April 1 is Saturday. April 30 is 29 days later: 29 mod 7 is 1, so April 30 is Saturday + 1 = Sunday. Wait, so April 30, 2023, was a Sunday? Let me check a calendar. Wait, actually, in 2023, April 30 was indeed a Sunday. Hmm, so in 2023, the 30th of April was a Sunday. So the 30th does occur as a Sunday in April. So 30 is not the answer.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another date that in this year never fell on a Sunday. Let&#39;s check. For example, in 2023, let&#39;s check each month&#39;s Sundays:January: Sundays on 1, 8, 15, 22, 29February: 5, 12, 19, 26March: 5, 12, 19, 26April: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30May: 7, 14, 21, 28June: 4, 11, 18, 25July: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30August: 6, 13, 20, 27September: 3, 10, 17, 24October: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29November: 5, 12, 19, 26December: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31Looking at all these, the Sundays in 2023 fell on the following dates:1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.Wait, in 2023, every date from 1 to 31 except some was a Sunday? Wait, looking at the list:Wait, let&#39;s check each date:1: Jan 1, Oct 12: Apr 2, Jul 23: Sep 3, Dec 35: Feb 5, Mar 5, Nov 56: Aug 67: May 78: Jan 8, Oct 89: Apr 9, Jul 910: Sep 10, Dec 1011: Jun 1112: Feb 12, Mar 12, Nov 1213: Aug 1314: May 1415: Jan 15, Oct 1516: Apr 16, Jul 1617: Sep 17, Dec 1718: Jun 1819: Feb 19, Mar 19, Nov 1920: Aug 2021: May 2122: Jan 22, Oct 2223: Apr 23, Jul 2324: Sep 24, Dec 2425: Jun 2526: Feb 26, Mar 26, Nov 2627: Aug 2728: May 2829: Jan 29, Oct 2930: Apr 30, Jul 3031: Dec 31Wait, so in 2023, the only dates not appearing as Sundays are... Let&#39;s check from 1 to 31:Missing: 4,  ... Let&#39;s see:Looking at the list:Sundays in 2023 were on: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31.Wait, missing dates: 4, 30 and 31 are present. Wait, April 30 is Sunday. December 31 is Sunday. So the missing dates are 4 and maybe others? Wait, let&#39;s check each date from 1 to 31:1: Yes2: Yes3: Yes4: No Sunday on 4th5: Yes6: Yes7: Yes8: Yes9: Yes10: Yes11: Yes12: Yes13: Yes14: Yes15: Yes16: Yes17: Yes18: Yes19: Yes20: Yes21: Yes22: Yes23: Yes24: Yes25: Yes26: Yes27: Yes28: Yes29: Yes30: Yes (April and July)31: Yes (December)So in 2023, the 4th of the month never fell on a Sunday. Wait, but let&#39;s check the Sundays:Looking back, the Sundays in 2023:January: 1,8,15,22,29February: 5,12,19,26March:5,12,19,26April:2,9,16,23,30May:7,14,21,28June:4,11,18,25 – wait, June 4th is a Sunday! So June 4, 2023 was a Sunday. Therefore, the 4th does occur. Wait, so in June, 4th is Sunday. Then why did my previous list miss that?Wait, in the initial breakdown, for June: 4, 11, 18, 25. So June 4 is a Sunday. Therefore, the 4th is present. Wait, then why did my cross-check miss that? Because when I listed all the Sundays, I included 4th in June. So, perhaps in 2023, all dates from 1 to 31 except for none? Because 4 is covered. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my cross-check.Wait, the problem says &quot;a certain number was not a Sunday in any month&quot;. But in 2023, every date from 1 to 31 was a Sunday in at least one month. For example, the 4th was a Sunday in June. So in 2023, all dates are covered. So maybe 2023 is not such a year. Then, maybe we need to look for another year where some date is never a Sunday.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is a date that only occurs in certain months, like the 31st. The 31st occurs in 7 months. If in a particular year, none of those 7 months have the 31st on a Sunday, then 31 would be the answer.Alternatively, maybe the 30th. The 30th occurs in all months except February. If in some year, none of the months April, June, September, November (which have 30 days) have the 30th on a Sunday, then 30 would be the answer.But how can we check that? Let&#39;s try to find a year where, for example, the 31st never falls on a Sunday.Let&#39;s take another year. Let&#39;s pick 2024, which is a leap year. Let&#39;s see.2024: January 1, 2024 is a Monday (since 2023 was a non-leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day, so 2024 starts one day later).So January 1, 2024: Monday. Then January 31 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Monday + 2 = Wednesday. So January 31, 2024 is Wednesday. Then February 1 is Thursday. February 2024 is a leap month, so 29 days. March 1 is Friday (29 days later: 29 mod 7 is 1, so Thursday +1 = Friday). March 31 is 30 days later: Friday + 2 (since 30 mod 7=2) = Sunday. So March 31, 2024 is Sunday. So the 31st is a Sunday in March. Hence, 31 is not the answer.Hmm. Let&#39;s try 2025. 2024 is a leap year, so 366 days, so 2025 starts 2 days later. So 2024 ends on Tuesday, so 2025 starts on Wednesday.January 1, 2025: Wednesday. January 31 is Wednesday + 30 days. 30 mod 7=2, so Friday. January 31 is Friday. February 1 is Saturday. February 2025 is non-leap, 28 days. March 1 is Saturday. March 31 is Saturday + 31 days. 31 mod 7=3, so Saturday +3 = Tuesday. April 1 is Wednesday. April 30 is Wednesday +29 days. 29 mod 7=1, so Thursday. May 1 is Friday. May 31 is Friday +30 days. 30 mod 7=2, so Sunday. May 31, 2025 is Sunday. So 31 is again a Sunday. So 31 is out.Hmm, seems like 31st is often a Sunday in some month. Let&#39;s check another year. Let&#39;s try 2026. 2025 is a non-leap year, 365 days, so 2026 starts on 2025 + 365 days, which is 365 mod 7=1 day. So 2026 starts on Thursday.January 1, 2026: Thursday. January 31 is Thursday +30 days=Thursday + 2= Saturday. February 1 is Sunday. March 1 is Sunday +28 days (non-leap)=Sunday +0=Sunday. March 31 is Sunday +30 days=Sunday +2=Tuesday. April 1 is Wednesday. April 30 is Wednesday +29 days=Wednesday +1=Thursday. May 1 is Friday. May 31 is Friday +30 days=Friday +2=Sunday. May 31, 2026 is Sunday. Again, 31 is a Sunday. Hmm.Wait, maybe the 31st is often a Sunday. Let&#39;s check 2027. 2026 is 365 days, so 2027 starts on Thursday +1=Friday.January 1, 2027: Friday. January 31 is Friday +30=Sunday. So January 31, 2027 is a Sunday. So again, 31 is a Sunday. So 31 is appearing as Sunday in multiple years. So maybe 31 isn&#39;t the answer.Wait, maybe the answer is a date that can only occur in February. But February only goes up to 28 or 29. So if the date is 30th or 31st, they never occur in February. But the problem says &quot;a certain number was not a Sunday in any month,&quot; so if the number is 30, then in months that have 30th, like April, June, September, November, the 30th could be Sunday. So the answer must be a date that exists in all months, but in some year, none of those dates fell on Sunday.Wait, but all months have 1st to 28th. February has up to 28 or 29. So dates like 30 and 31 don&#39;t exist in some months, but the problem says &quot;in any month&quot;. Wait, the problem states &quot;a certain number was not a Sunday in any month&quot;. So does that mean that in every month of the year, that number was not a Sunday? But if the number is, say, 31, then in months that don&#39;t have 31 days, it&#39;s irrelevant. So maybe the problem means that the number exists in at least one month, but in none of the months where it exists was it a Sunday. But the way the problem is phrased is ambiguous.Wait, the original problem says: &quot;In some year, a certain number was not a Sunday in any month. Determine this number.&quot;So perhaps it&#39;s a number (date) that, in that year, in every month, when that date exists, it was not a Sunday. So for example, if the number is 31, then in each month that has a 31st, the 31st was not a Sunday. Similarly, if the number is 30, then in each month that has a 30th, the 30th was not a Sunday. If the number is 29, then in February (if leap year) and other months with 29 days (which is all months, but February only has 29 in leap years), but actually, no, other months have at least 29 days. Wait, no, all months have at least 28 days, with February having 28 or 29. So 29th exists in all months except February in non-leap years.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.The problem is: There exists a year where a certain date (number) does not fall on a Sunday in any month. So, for that year, in every month where that date exists, it&#39;s not a Sunday.So, we need to find a number (from 1 to 31) such that there exists a year where, in every month that includes that date, the date is not a Sunday.So, for example, if the date is 31, then in the 7 months that have 31 days, none of them have the 31st on a Sunday. Similarly, if the date is 30, then in the 11 months that have 30 days (all except February), none have the 30th on a Sunday. Wait, no, April, June, September, November have 30 days. So the 30th exists in 4 months. Wait, no: April has 30, June has 30, September has 30, November has 30. So 4 months have 30 days. Wait, no, 30th exists in 11 months? No. Wait, only months with 30 days are April, June, September, November. So 4 months. The other months have 31 or 28/29. So the 30th exists in 4 months. So if the date is 30, then in those 4 months, the 30th isn&#39;t a Sunday. Similarly, the 31st exists in 7 months.So, the problem is to find a date (from 1 to 31) such that there exists a year where in every month that contains that date, the date is not a Sunday.So, for example, maybe in some year, the 31st is never a Sunday in the 7 months that have 31st. Similarly, maybe in some year, the 30th is never a Sunday in the 4 months. Or maybe a lower date like the 1st or 2nd, which exist in all months, so we need a year where, say, the 2nd is never a Sunday in any month. But that would require that in every month, the 2nd is not a Sunday, which is difficult because there are 12 months. So the 2nd would have to shift such that in each month&#39;s 2nd is not a Sunday.But the problem says &quot;in some year&quot;, so maybe there exists a year where the 2nd is never a Sunday. How likely is that?Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 31, because it only occurs in 7 months, and maybe there&#39;s a year where in those 7 months, the 31st isn&#39;t a Sunday.But how to check that.Alternatively, maybe the answer is 31, but in the example of 2023, December 31 is a Sunday, as we saw. So in 2023, 31 is a Sunday in December. So 2023 is not such a year. But maybe another year.Wait, let&#39;s consider a year where January 1 is a Monday. Then, January 31 is Monday + 30 days = Monday + 2 = Wednesday. Then February 1 is Thursday. If it&#39;s a non-leap year, February has 28 days, so March 1 is Thursday. March 31 is Thursday + 30 days = Thursday + 2 = Saturday. April 1 is Sunday. April 30 is Sunday + 29 days = Sunday + 1 = Monday. May 1 is Tuesday. May 31 is Tuesday + 30 days = Tuesday + 2 = Thursday. June 1 is Friday. June 30 is Friday + 29 days = Friday + 1 = Saturday. July 1 is Sunday. July 31 is Sunday + 30 days = Sunday + 2 = Tuesday. August 1 is Wednesday. August 31 is Wednesday + 30 days = Wednesday + 2 = Friday. September 1 is Saturday. September 30 is Saturday + 29 days = Saturday + 1 = Sunday. October 1 is Monday. October 31 is Monday + 30 days = Monday + 2 = Wednesday. November 1 is Thursday. November 30 is Thursday + 29 days = Thursday + 1 = Friday. December 1 is Saturday. December 31 is Saturday + 30 days = Saturday + 2 = Monday.In this hypothetical year starting on Monday (non-leap year), let&#39;s check the 31sts:January 31: WednesdayMarch 31: SaturdayMay 31: ThursdayJuly 31: TuesdayAugust 31: FridayOctober 31: WednesdayDecember 31: MondayNone of these are Sundays. So in this year, the 31st is never a Sunday in any month. So the number would be 31.Wait, that seems possible. Let&#39;s verify the calculations:Start with January 1 as Monday (non-leap year).January has 31 days: 31 mod 7 = 3. So January 31 is Monday + 3*1 week + 3 days = Monday + 3 days = Thursday? Wait, wait, no. Wait, how to calculate the day after n days.Wait, if January 1 is a Monday, then January 8 is Monday, January 15 Monday, January 22 Monday, January 29 Monday. January 30 is Tuesday, January 31 is Wednesday. So January 31 is Wednesday. Then February 1 is Thursday. Since it&#39;s a non-leap year, February has 28 days. February 28 is Thursday. March 1 is Friday (not Thursday as I previously thought). Wait, so there&#39;s a mistake in my earlier calculation.Wait, if January 1 is Monday, then January 31 is Wednesday. February 1 is Thursday. February 28 is Thursday + 27 days = Thursday + 27 mod 7 = 6 days. So February 28 is Thursday + 6 = Wednesday. Wait, but that can&#39;t be. Wait, no, if February 1 is Thursday, then February 8 is Thursday, 15th Thursday, 22nd Thursday, and 28th is Wednesday. Wait, but February has 28 days, so February 28 is the last day. Then March 1 is Thursday + 28 days = Thursday + 0 = Thursday. Wait, no. Wait, if February 1 is Thursday, then adding 28 days (4 weeks) would bring us back to Thursday. So March 1 is Thursday. So my earlier calculation was wrong. Then March 31 is Thursday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Thursday + 2 = Saturday. April 1 is Sunday. April 30 is Sunday + 29 days. 29 mod 7 is 1, so Sunday +1 = Monday. May 1 is Tuesday. May 31 is Tuesday +30 days = Tuesday +2 = Thursday. June 1 is Friday. June 30 is Friday +29 days = Friday +1 = Saturday. July 1 is Sunday. July 31 is Sunday +30 days = Sunday +2 = Tuesday. August 1 is Wednesday. August 31 is Wednesday +30 days = Wednesday +2 = Friday. September 1 is Saturday. September 30 is Saturday +29 days = Saturday +1 = Sunday. October 1 is Monday. October 31 is Monday +30 days = Monday +2 = Wednesday. November 1 is Thursday. November 30 is Thursday +29 days = Thursday +1 = Friday. December 1 is Saturday. December 31 is Saturday +30 days = Saturday +2 = Monday.So in this year where January 1 is Monday (non-leap year), the 31st dates are:Jan 31: WednesdayMar 31: SaturdayMay 31: ThursdayJul 31: TuesdayAug 31: FridayOct 31: WednesdayDec 31: MondayNone of these are Sundays. So in this year, the 31st never falls on a Sunday. Therefore, the answer is 31.But wait, does such a year exist? For example, was there a non-leap year where January 1 was a Monday?Yes. For example, 2018 was a non-leap year where January 1 was a Monday. Let&#39;s check if in 2018, the 31st was ever a Sunday.January 31, 2018: Wednesday (as calculated)March 31, 2018: SaturdayMay 31, 2018: ThursdayJuly 31, 2018: TuesdayAugust 31, 2018: FridayOctober 31, 2018: WednesdayDecember 31, 2018: MondaySo yes, none of the 31sts in 2018 were Sundays. Therefore, in 2018, the number 31 was not a Sunday in any month. Therefore, the answer is 31.Alternatively, let&#39;s check another year. Take 2018:January 1, 2018: Monday.January 31: 30 days later. 30 mod 7=2, so Monday + 30 days = Monday + 2 = Wednesday.February 1: Thursday. February 28: Wednesday (as 28 days later is Thursday + 27 days = Thursday + 6 = Wednesday). March 1: Thursday.March 31: Thursday + 30 days = Thursday + 2 = Saturday.April 1: Sunday. April 30: Sunday + 29 days = Monday.May 1: Tuesday. May 31: Tuesday + 30 days = Thursday.June 1: Friday. June 30: Friday + 29 days = Saturday.July 1: Sunday. July 31: Sunday + 30 days = Tuesday.August 1: Wednesday. August 31: Wednesday + 30 days = Friday.September 1: Saturday. September 30: Saturday + 29 days = Sunday.October 1: Monday. October 31: Monday + 30 days = Wednesday.November 1: Thursday. November 30: Thursday + 29 days = Friday.December 1: Saturday. December 31: Saturday + 30 days = Monday.Indeed, none of the 31sts are Sundays. So in 2018, the 31st was never a Sunday. Therefore, the answer is 31.But wait, let&#39;s confirm this with actual calendar data. Let me check July 31, 2018. According to online calendars, July 31, 2018 was a Tuesday. Correct. October 31, 2018 was a Wednesday. December 31, 2018 was a Monday. Correct. So yes, none of the 31sts were Sundays. Therefore, the number is 31.&lt;/think&gt;The number in question is 31. In a non-leap year where January 1st falls on a Monday (e.g., 2018), the 31st day of each month never lands on a Sunday. Here&#39;s the breakdown:- January 31: Wednesday  - March 31: Saturday  - May 31: Thursday  - July 31: Tuesday  - August 31: Friday  - October 31: Wednesday  - December 31: Monday  Since none of the 31sts in these months are Sundays, the number 31 is the answer.boxed{31}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-39a2a286></div><p class="review-content" data-v-39a2a286><span class="icon" data-v-39a2a286>🔑:</span>Let&#39;s assign numbers from 0 to 6 to the days of the week.

I need to find the equation of the directrix and the distance from point A to the focus. Hmm, let me think step by step.First, I remember that the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is y² = 4ax. But here the equation is y² = 2px. Maybe that&#39;s a different way of writing it. Let me check. If I compare y² = 2px with y² = 4ax, then 4a should be equal to 2p, which would mean that a = p/2. So in this case, the focus of the parabola would be at (a, 0) which would be (p/2, 0), and the directrix would be the line x = -a, which is x = -p/2. So that&#39;s how the parameters relate here.Now, the parabola passes through the point A(4,4). That means when x is 4 and y is 4, the equation should hold. Let me plug those values into the equation to find p. So substituting x=4 and y=4 into y² = 2px:4² = 2p*416 = 8pDivide both sides by 8: p = 16/8 = 2.Okay, so p is 2. Therefore, the value of a, which we saw earlier is p/2, would be 2/2 = 1. So the focus is at (a, 0) = (1, 0), and the directrix is the line x = -a = -1.Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm. If the standard parabola equation is y² = 4ax, then in this case, the equation given is y² = 2px. So comparing the two, 4a = 2p, so indeed a = p/2. Therefore, if p is 2, then a is 1. So the focus is at (a, 0) = (1, 0) and the directrix is x = -a = -1. That seems right.So the equation of the directrix is x = -1.Now, the problem also asks for the distance from point A(4,4) to the focus. The focus is at (1, 0). So the distance between (4,4) and (1,0) can be found using the distance formula.The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]. Plugging in the points (4,4) and (1,0):Distance = sqrt[(4 - 1)² + (4 - 0)²] = sqrt[3² + 4²] = sqrt[9 + 16] = sqrt[25] = 5.So the distance from point A to the focus is 5 units.Wait, just to double-check, let me verify if I did everything correctly. The parabola equation was y² = 2px. Plugging in (4,4) gives 16 = 8p, so p=2. Then since the directrix is x = -p/2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in my initial thought, I compared y²=2px with the standard form y²=4ax, which gives a = p/2. Therefore, the directrix is x = -a = -p/2. But if p=2, then directrix is x = -1, which is correct. And the focus is at (a, 0) = (p/2, 0) = (1, 0). So that seems correct. Then the distance from (4,4) to (1,0) is indeed 5. That all checks out.But just to be thorough, let me recall that for a parabola, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from that point to the directrix. Let&#39;s see if that holds here.Point A is (4,4). The distance to the focus (1,0) is 5, as calculated. The distance to the directrix x = -1 is the horizontal distance from x=4 to x=-1, which is |4 - (-1)| = 5. So that&#39;s consistent with the definition of a parabola. Therefore, both distances are 5, which matches. So that makes me more confident that my answer is correct.Therefore, the equation of the directrix is x = -1, and the distance from A to the focus is 5.Final AnswerThe equation of the directrix is boxed{x = -1} and the distance from point A to the focus is boxed{5}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the parabola ( y^2 = 2px ) that passes through the point ( A(4, 4) ), we need to find the equation of the directrix and the distance from point ( A ) to the focus.First, we substitute the coordinates of point ( A(4, 4) ) into the equation ( y^2 = 2px ):[4^2 = 2p cdot 4][16 = 8p][p = 2]With ( p = 2 ), we compare the given equation ( y^2 = 2px ) with the standard form ( y^2 = 4ax ). This gives ( 4a = 2p ), so ( a = frac{p}{2} = frac{2}{2} = 1 ).The focus of the parabola is at ( (a, 0) = (1, 0) ) and the directrix is the line ( x = -a = -1 ).Next, we calculate the distance from point ( A(4, 4) ) to the focus ( (1, 0) ) using the distance formula:[text{Distance} = sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5]Thus, the equation of the directrix is (boxed{x = -1}) and the distance from point ( A ) to the focus is (boxed{5}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to figure out the equation of the directrix and the distance from point A(4, 4) to the focus of the parabola given by y² = 2px. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some basic properties of parabolas. First, the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is y² = 4ax, where the vertex is at the origin (0,0), the focus is at (a, 0), and the directrix is the vertical line x = -a. Wait, but the equation given here is y² = 2px. Maybe that&#39;s similar but with a different coefficient. Let me compare the two equations.If I take the standard form y² = 4ax and compare it to the given equation y² = 2px, then 2p must equal 4a, so p = 2a. Therefore, maybe in this case, the focus would be at (p/2, 0) and the directrix at x = -p/2. Let me check that. If 4a = 2p, then a = p/2. So yes, the focus is at (a, 0) which is (p/2, 0), and the directrix is x = -a which is x = -p/2. That seems right.But wait, maybe different sources use different notations. Let me confirm. For example, some textbooks might use y² = 4px, where the focus is at (p, 0) and directrix x = -p. So perhaps in this problem, the equation is given as y² = 2px, which would be a variation where the coefficient is 2p instead of 4p. So if I compare it to the standard form y² = 4ax, then 4a = 2p, so a = p/2. Hence, the focus is at (a, 0) = (p/2, 0), and the directrix is x = -a = -p/2. So that must be the case here.But to be thorough, let&#39;s see. The given equation is y² = 2px. If I want to find p, I can use the point A(4, 4) that lies on the parabola. Since A(4,4) is on the parabola, plugging in x=4 and y=4 into the equation should satisfy it. Let me do that.Plugging into y² = 2px: 4² = 2p*4 =&gt; 16 = 8p =&gt; p = 16/8 = 2. So p = 2. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is y² = 2*2x =&gt; y² = 4x. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So if p = 2, then the equation becomes y² = 4x, which is the standard form I was talking about earlier. So in this case, comparing to y² = 4ax, we have 4a = 4x, so a = 1. Therefore, the focus is at (a, 0) = (1, 0), and the directrix is x = -a = -1. Wait, but hold on, in the original problem, they use the form y² = 2px, which became y² = 4x here. So perhaps in their notation, 2p is equivalent to 4a, so a = p/2. Therefore, if p = 2, then a = 1. So focus is (a, 0) = (1, 0), directrix x = -a = -1. Therefore, the directrix equation is x = -1, and the focus is at (1, 0).But let me confirm once again to avoid confusion. Maybe in some references, the standard form is y² = 4px, so the focus is at (p, 0) and directrix x = -p. In that case, if the equation is y² = 4x, then p = 1, so focus at (1, 0), directrix x = -1. So that&#39;s consistent. Therefore, since in our problem, they gave the equation as y² = 2px, but after plugging in the point, we found p = 2, so the equation is y² = 4x, which corresponds to the standard form y² = 4px where p = 1. So maybe here in the problem, the parameter p is different. Wait, that&#39;s a bit confusing.Let me clarify. The given equation is y² = 2px. When we plugged in (4,4), we found p = 2, so the equation becomes y² = 4x. Now, in the standard form y² = 4ax, a is the focal length (distance from vertex to focus). Comparing y² = 4x to y² = 4ax, we have 4a = 4, so a = 1. Therefore, the focus is at (a, 0) = (1, 0), directrix x = -a = -1. So in this case, even though the original equation was written as y² = 2px with p = 2, the focal length a is 1, so the focus is at (1, 0) and directrix x = -1.But let&#39;s make sure that this parameter p in the original equation is not the focal length. In other words, in the given equation y² = 2px, how is p related to the focus? If the standard form is y² = 4ax, then 2p = 4a, so a = p/2. Therefore, in the given equation, the focal length is a = p/2. Therefore, if we have p = 2, then a = 1. Therefore, focus at (a, 0) = (1, 0), directrix x = -1. So that seems correct.Therefore, the directrix is x = -1, and the focus is at (1, 0). Now, the second part of the problem is to find the distance from point A(4,4) to the focus. So we need to compute the distance between (4,4) and (1, 0). Let&#39;s do that. The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So plugging in the points (4,4) and (1,0):Distance = sqrt[(1 - 4)^2 + (0 - 4)^2] = sqrt[(-3)^2 + (-4)^2] = sqrt[9 + 16] = sqrt[25] = 5.Therefore, the distance from point A to the focus is 5 units.Let me recap to ensure I haven&#39;t made any mistakes. The parabola equation is given as y² = 2px. Point A(4,4) is on this parabola, so substituting x=4 and y=4, we solve for p:4² = 2p*4 =&gt; 16 = 8p =&gt; p = 2.Therefore, the equation is y² = 4x, which is equivalent to the standard form y² = 4ax where a = 1. Hence, the focus is at (a, 0) = (1, 0), and the directrix is x = -1. The distance from A(4,4) to the focus (1,0) is calculated using the distance formula, resulting in 5. Just to double-check, maybe I can verify the directrix. For a parabola, the definition is that the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from that point to the directrix. Let&#39;s check this with point A(4,4). The distance to the focus is 5, as calculated. The distance to the directrix x = -1 is the horizontal distance from x=4 to x=-1, which is |4 - (-1)| = 5. So both distances are 5, which satisfies the definition of a parabola. That checks out. Therefore, the calculations are correct.Therefore, the equation of the directrix is x = -1, and the distance from A to the focus is 5.Final AnswerThe equation of the directrix is boxed{x = -1} and the distance from point A to the focus is boxed{5}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the parabola ( y^2 = 2px ) that passes through the point ( A(4, 4) ), we need to find the equation of the directrix and the distance from point ( A ) to the focus.1. Determine the value of ( p ):   Since the point ( A(4, 4) ) lies on the parabola, substitute ( x = 4 ) and ( y = 4 ) into the equation:   [   4^2 = 2p cdot 4 implies 16 = 8p implies p = 2   ]   Thus, the equation of the parabola is ( y^2 = 4x ).2. Find the focus and directrix:   For the standard form of a parabola ( y^2 = 4ax ), the focus is at ( (a, 0) ) and the directrix is ( x = -a ). Here, ( 4a = 4 ) implies ( a = 1 ). Therefore, the focus is at ( (1, 0) ) and the directrix is ( x = -1 ).3. Calculate the distance from point ( A ) to the focus:   Using the distance formula between points ( (4, 4) ) and ( (1, 0) ):   [   text{Distance} = sqrt{(1 - 4)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-4)^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5   ]Thus, the equation of the directrix is (boxed{x = -1}) and the distance from point ( A ) to the focus is (boxed{5}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-39a2a286></div><p class="review-content" data-v-39a2a286><span class="icon" data-v-39a2a286>🔑:</span>Since the parabola y^2 = 2px passes through point A(4, 4),we have 4^2 = 2p times 4, solving for p gives p=2.

I need to solve this problem about a geometric sequence. The problem says: In a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2, if a₁a₃ = 6a₂, then a₄ equals which of the options given. The choices are A: 4, B: 8, C: 12, D: 24.Alright, first, let&#39;s recall what a geometric sequence is. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 2. So each term is double the previous one.Let me write down the general form of a geometric sequence. The nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as:aₙ = a₁ * r^(n-1)where a₁ is the first term and r is the common ratio. Here, r is given as 2. So, for this specific sequence:a₂ = a₁ * 2^(2-1) = a₁ * 2a₃ = a₁ * 2^(3-1) = a₁ * 4a₄ = a₁ * 2^(4-1) = a₁ * 8So, each subsequent term is just doubling the previous one. That makes sense.Now, the problem states that a₁a₃ = 6a₂. Let me parse that. It means the product of the first term and the third term is equal to six times the second term. Let me write that equation out using the expressions I just found.Given:a₁ * a₃ = 6 * a₂Substituting the expressions in terms of a₁:a₁ * (a₁ * 4) = 6 * (a₁ * 2)Let me compute each side step by step.Left side: a₁ * a₃ = a₁ * (a₁ * 4) = a₁² * 4Right side: 6 * a₂ = 6 * (a₁ * 2) = 6 * 2 * a₁ = 12a₁So the equation becomes:4a₁² = 12a₁Hmm, okay. Let me write that down clearly:4a₁² = 12a₁Now, to solve for a₁, I can divide both sides by 4a₁, assuming a₁ ≠ 0. Let&#39;s check if a₁ can be zero. If a₁ were zero, then all terms in the sequence would be zero, but then the equation 0*0 = 6*0 would hold, which is 0=0. However, in a geometric sequence, typically the first term is non-zero because if a₁ is zero, all terms are zero and it&#39;s considered a trivial sequence. Since the problem is asking for a₄, which would be zero in that case, but none of the answer choices is zero, so we can safely assume a₁ ≠ 0. Therefore, dividing both sides by 4a₁ is valid.So dividing both sides by 4a₁:(4a₁²)/(4a₁) = (12a₁)/(4a₁)Simplify:a₁ = 3Okay, so the first term a₁ is 3.Now, we need to find a₄. As we wrote earlier, a₄ = a₁ * 8. Since a₁ is 3, that means:a₄ = 3 * 8 = 24So, a₄ is 24. Let me check the answer choices: D is 24. So the answer should be D.Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting from the beginning: common ratio 2, so terms are a₁, 2a₁, 4a₁, 8a₁, etc.Given a₁*a₃ = 6a₂.Substituting:a₁*(4a₁) = 6*(2a₁)Left side: 4a₁²Right side: 12a₁Equation: 4a₁² = 12a₁Divide both sides by 4a₁ (a₁ ≠ 0):a₁ = 3Therefore, a₄ = 8a₁ = 24. That seems correct.But let me verify by plugging the values back into the original equation to ensure that it holds.Given a₁ = 3, then:a₂ = 3*2 = 6a₃ = 3*4 = 12So, a₁*a₃ = 3*12 = 366a₂ = 6*6 = 36Yes, 36 = 36. So the equation holds. Therefore, a₁ = 3 is correct, and a₄ = 3*8 = 24. So answer D is correct.Therefore, the answer is D: 24.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2, we need to find the value of (a_4) given that (a_1a_3 = 6a_2).First, recall the general form of the terms in a geometric sequence:- The (n)-th term is given by (a_n = a_1 cdot r^{n-1}) where (r) is the common ratio.- Here, (r = 2), so the terms are:  - (a_1 = a_1)  - (a_2 = a_1 cdot 2)  - (a_3 = a_1 cdot 2^2 = a_1 cdot 4)  - (a_4 = a_1 cdot 2^3 = a_1 cdot 8)Given the equation (a_1a_3 = 6a_2), substitute the expressions for (a_3) and (a_2):[a_1 cdot (a_1 cdot 4) = 6 cdot (a_1 cdot 2)]Simplify both sides:[4a_1^2 = 12a_1]Divide both sides by (4a_1) (assuming (a_1 neq 0)):[a_1 = 3]Now, calculate (a_4):[a_4 = a_1 cdot 8 = 3 cdot 8 = 24]Verify the solution by substituting (a_1 = 3) back into the original equation:- (a_1 = 3), (a_2 = 6), (a_3 = 12)- Check (a_1a_3 = 3 cdot 12 = 36) and (6a_2 = 6 cdot 6 = 36), which holds true.Thus, the value of (a_4) is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. So the problem is about a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. They give me that a₁ times a₃ equals 6 times a₂, and I need to find what a₄ is. The options are A: 4, B: 8, C: 12, D: 24. Hmm.First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. Here, the common ratio is given as 2. So, that means each term is double the previous one.So, let me denote the first term as a₁. Then, the second term a₂ would be a₁ multiplied by 2, right? So, a₂ = a₁ * 2. Similarly, the third term a₃ is a₂ * 2, which is a₁ * 2^2. And the fourth term a₄ would be a₃ * 2 = a₁ * 2^3. So, in general, the nth term of a geometric sequence is a₁ * r^(n-1), where r is the common ratio. Here, r is 2, so each term is a₁ multiplied by 2^(n-1).Now, the problem states that a₁ * a₃ = 6 * a₂. Let me write that equation out using the expressions in terms of a₁.First, a₁ is just a₁. Then, a₃ is a₁ * 2^(3-1) = a₁ * 2² = a₁ * 4. So, a₃ = 4a₁. Similarly, a₂ is a₁ * 2^(2-1) = a₁ * 2. So, a₂ = 2a₁.Putting those into the equation: a₁ * a₃ = 6 * a₂ becomes:a₁ * (4a₁) = 6 * (2a₁)Let me compute both sides. Left side: 4a₁ * a₁ = 4a₁². Right side: 6 * 2a₁ = 12a₁.So, the equation simplifies to 4a₁² = 12a₁. Hmm. Let&#39;s solve for a₁.First, I can subtract 12a₁ from both sides to get 4a₁² - 12a₁ = 0. Then, factor out 4a₁: 4a₁(a₁ - 3) = 0. So, either 4a₁ = 0 or a₁ - 3 = 0. If 4a₁ = 0, then a₁ = 0. But if the first term is 0, then all terms in the geometric sequence would be 0. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s a valid solution here. If a₁ = 0, then a₁ * a₃ = 0 * 0 = 0, and 6a₂ = 6 * 0 = 0. So, technically, 0 = 0, which is true. But in a geometric sequence, having the first term as 0 is trivial because all terms are zero. However, in some contexts, geometric sequences are considered to have a non-zero common ratio and non-zero terms. So, maybe the problem expects a non-trivial solution. So, the other possibility is a₁ - 3 = 0, which gives a₁ = 3. So, a₁ is 3. Let&#39;s verify this.If a₁ = 3, then a₂ = 3 * 2 = 6, a₃ = 6 * 2 = 12, and a₄ = 12 * 2 = 24. Let&#39;s check the original equation: a₁ * a₃ = 3 * 12 = 36. 6 * a₂ = 6 * 6 = 36. So, 36 = 36, which works. So, that&#39;s valid. So, a₁ is 3. Then, a₄ would be 24, which is option D. But hold on, let me check the answer options again. The options are A:4, B:8, C:12, D:24. So, 24 is option D.But wait, let me make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in solving the equation. Let me go through the steps again.Original equation: a₁ * a₃ = 6a₂Expressed in terms of a₁:a₁ * (a₁ * 2²) = 6 * (a₁ * 2)That is, a₁ * 4a₁ = 6 * 2a₁Left side: 4a₁²Right side: 12a₁So, 4a₁² = 12a₁Divide both sides by 4: a₁² = 3a₁Bring all terms to one side: a₁² - 3a₁ = 0Factor: a₁(a₁ - 3) = 0Solutions: a₁ = 0 or a₁ = 3As discussed, a₁ = 0 is trivial. So, a₁ = 3 is the non-trivial solution. Then, a₄ is a₁ * 2^(4-1) = 3 * 2³ = 3 * 8 = 24. So, that&#39;s D. So, the answer should be D:24.But let me check if perhaps the problem meant something different. Wait, in some cases, maybe the problem is using a different notation? For example, sometimes a₃ is the third term, which in this case, we did take as 4a₁. Let&#39;s confirm that.If the first term is a₁, then:a₁ = a₁a₂ = a₁ * r = a₁ * 2a₃ = a₂ * r = a₁ * 2² = 4a₁a₄ = a₃ * r = 8a₁Yes, so that&#39;s correct. So, with a₁ = 3, a₄ = 8 * 3 = 24. So, that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is presented differently. Let&#39;s think again. If the common ratio is 2, then each term is multiplied by 2. So, starting from a₁, the sequence is a₁, 2a₁, 4a₁, 8a₁, etc. So, a₁, a₂=2a₁, a₃=4a₁, a₄=8a₁. So, the equation given is a₁ * a₃ = 6a₂. That is, a₁ * 4a₁ = 6 * 2a₁. So, 4a₁² = 12a₁. Then, same as before, leading to a₁=3, so a₄=24. So, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the answer should be D:24.Wait, but why is the option C:12 there? Let&#39;s see. If someone miscalculates, maybe they think a₄ is a₃*2=12*2=24. Hmm, no, that&#39;s correct. Maybe if someone thought the common ratio is 2, but the terms are a₁, a₁+2, etc., but no, that&#39;s an arithmetic sequence. Here it&#39;s geometric, so multiplicative.Alternatively, maybe miscalculating the exponent? Let&#39;s see. a₄ is a₁ * 2^(4-1) = a₁ * 8. If a₁=3, then 3*8=24, which is correct. So, yeah, that&#39;s right.Wait, let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says &quot;a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2&quot;. So, the common ratio is 2, so each term is multiplied by 2. So, a₂ = a₁ * 2, a₃ = a₂ * 2 = a₁ * 4, a₄ = a₃ * 2 = a₁ * 8. So, that&#39;s all correct.So, with a₁=3, a₄=24. So, D:24 is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2, we need to find the fourth term (a_4) given that (a_1a_3 = 6a_2).1. Express the terms in terms of (a_1):   - The first term (a_1) is (a_1).   - The second term (a_2 = a_1 times 2).   - The third term (a_3 = a_2 times 2 = a_1 times 2^2 = 4a_1).   - The fourth term (a_4 = a_3 times 2 = a_1 times 2^3 = 8a_1).2. Set up the given equation:   - The equation (a_1a_3 = 6a_2) translates to:     [     a_1 times 4a_1 = 6 times 2a_1     ]   - Simplifying both sides:     [     4a_1^2 = 12a_1     ]3. Solve for (a_1):   - Rearrange the equation:     [     4a_1^2 - 12a_1 = 0     ]   - Factor out (4a_1):     [     4a_1(a_1 - 3) = 0     ]   - This gives two solutions: (a_1 = 0) or (a_1 = 3). Since a geometric sequence with a non-zero common ratio must have a non-zero first term, we use (a_1 = 3).4. Calculate (a_4):   - Substitute (a_1 = 3) into the expression for (a_4):     [     a_4 = 8a_1 = 8 times 3 = 24     ]Thus, the fourth term (a_4) is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-39a2a286></div><p class="review-content" data-v-39a2a286><span class="icon" data-v-39a2a286>🔑:</span>AnalysisThis problem tests the basic operations and properties of a geometric sequence.

Let me break this down step by step. First, let&#39;s understand what each set represents.Set A is defined as all real numbers x such that x² - 2x - 3 ≤ 0. To figure out the interval for A, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. Similarly, set B is all real numbers x such that x² - 5x ≥ 0. I also need to solve this inequality to find the interval(s) for B. Once I have both A and B, the complement of B (denoted as complement_ℝ B) would be all real numbers not in B. Then, finally, I need to find the overlap between A and this complement of B.Starting with set A: x² - 2x - 3 ≤ 0. Let me solve the quadratic equation first to find the critical points. The quadratic equation is x² - 2x - 3 = 0. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, let&#39;s see... 1 and -3? Yes, 1 * (-3) = -3 and 1 + (-3) = -2. So, factoring gives (x + 1)(x - 3) = 0. Therefore, the roots are x = -1 and x = 3.Since the quadratic opens upwards (the coefficient of x² is positive), the graph is a parabola opening upwards with vertex between -1 and 3. The inequality x² - 2x - 3 ≤ 0 corresponds to the region where the parabola is below or equal to zero, which is between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the closed interval [-1, 3]. So, set A = [-1, 3].Now moving on to set B: x² - 5x ≥ 0. Let me solve this inequality as well. First, solve the equation x² - 5x = 0. Factor out an x: x(x - 5) = 0. Therefore, the roots are x = 0 and x = 5.Again, this is a quadratic opening upwards. The inequality x² - 5x ≥ 0 corresponds to the regions where the parabola is above or equal to zero. Since it&#39;s opening upwards, these regions are to the left of the smaller root (x ≤ 0) and to the right of the larger root (x ≥ 5). Therefore, set B is (-∞, 0] ∪ [5, ∞).Now, the complement of B in ℝ would be all real numbers not in B. Since B is (-∞, 0] ∪ [5, ∞), the complement would be the interval between 0 and 5, excluding the endpoints. So, complement_ℝ B = (0, 5).Wait, hold on. Let me confirm that. If B is the union of (-∞, 0] and [5, ∞), then the complement is everything that&#39;s not in those intervals. Which would be the numbers greater than 0 and less than 5. Since B includes 0 and 5, their complement excludes those points. So yes, complement_ℝ B is (0, 5).Therefore, now I need to find the intersection of set A, which is [-1, 3], and the complement of B, which is (0, 5). The intersection of these two intervals would be the overlap between [-1, 3] and (0, 5).Visualizing this on the number line: [-1, 3] starts at -1 and goes up to 3, while (0, 5) starts just above 0 and goes up to just below 5. The overlap between these two intervals would start at 0 (but not including 0) and end at 3 (including 3, since 3 is in set A and the upper bound of A is closed). Wait, but set A includes up to 3, and the complement of B is up to 5, so the upper bound of the intersection is 3. The lower bound is 0, but since complement of B is open at 0, the intersection is (0, 3].Let me check that again. A is [-1, 3], which includes all numbers from -1 to 3, including both endpoints. The complement of B is (0, 5), which is all numbers greater than 0 and less than 5. The intersection of these two would be numbers that are greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3. So, from 0 (exclusive) to 3 (inclusive). Therefore, the interval is (0, 3].But let me verify this step by step. The intersection of [-1, 3] and (0, 5) is the set of all x such that x is in both intervals. For x to be in both intervals, x must be ≥ -1 and ≤ 3 (from A) and also x must be &gt; 0 and &lt; 5 (from complement of B). Combining these inequalities: x must be &gt; 0 and ≤ 3. Therefore, (0, 3].So, the final answer should be the interval from 0 to 3, not including 0 but including 3. In interval notation, that&#39;s (0, 3].But let me double-check. Let&#39;s confirm each step.First, solving A: quadratic inequality x² - 2x - 3 ≤ 0.Factored as (x + 1)(x - 3) ≤ 0. The roots are at -1 and 3. Testing intervals:- For x &lt; -1, say x = -2: (-2 + 1)(-2 - 3) = (-1)(-5) = 5 &gt; 0.- Between -1 and 3, x = 0: (0 + 1)(0 - 3) = (1)(-3) = -3 &lt; 0.- For x &gt; 3, x = 4: (4 + 1)(4 - 3) = (5)(1) = 5 &gt; 0.Since we need ≤ 0, the solution is where the product is negative or zero, which is between -1 and 3, inclusive. So yes, A = [-1, 3].Set B: x² - 5x ≥ 0.Factored as x(x - 5) ≥ 0. The critical points are 0 and 5. Testing intervals:- x &lt; 0: Let x = -1: (-1)(-1 - 5) = (-1)(-6) = 6 ≥ 0.- Between 0 and 5: x = 2: 2(2 - 5) = 2(-3) = -6 &lt; 0.- x &gt; 5: x = 6: 6(6 - 5) = 6(1) = 6 ≥ 0.So, the inequality holds when x ≤ 0 or x ≥ 5. Therefore, B = (-∞, 0] ∪ [5, ∞). Therefore, complement of B is ℝ  B = (0, 5), since those are the points not in B. Since B includes 0 and 5, the complement does not include them, hence open intervals.Therefore, complement of B is (0, 5).Now, A is [-1, 3], and complement of B is (0, 5). The intersection is the set of all x such that x is in both intervals. So, x must be ≥ -1 and ≤ 3 (from A) and also x must be &gt; 0 and &lt; 5 (from complement of B). Combining these, x must be &gt; 0 and ≤ 3. So, the intersection is (0, 3].Therefore, the answer is (0, 3].But hold on, I want to make sure that the endpoints are correct. Since 3 is included in set A (because A is closed at 3) and 3 is less than 5, so 3 is in the complement of B? Wait, complement of B is (0, 5). 3 is within (0, 5), so yes, 3 is included in the complement of B? Wait, no. Wait, complement of B is (0,5), which is open interval. Wait, no. Wait, complement of B is ℝ  B, which is the set of real numbers not in (-∞,0] ∪ [5, ∞). Therefore, numbers greater than 0 and less than 5. So, (0,5). So 3 is in (0,5). Wait, (0,5) is open, so 5 is excluded, but 3 is included. Wait, no. Wait, open interval (0,5) includes all numbers greater than 0 and less than 5. So 3 is included because 0 &lt; 3 &lt; 5. So, the complement of B is (0,5). Then A is [-1,3]. So the intersection is all numbers that are in both sets. So numbers greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3, since A includes up to 3. So (0,3].Therefore, the final answer is (0,3]. So in boxed notation, that&#39;s boxed{(0, 3]}.But let me check if the problem expects a different notation. For example, sometimes in some contexts, the complement might be considered as closed intervals, but in this case, since B is (-∞,0] ∪ [5, ∞), complement is indeed (0,5). So the intersection with A [-1,3] is (0,3].Just to be thorough, let me pick a number in (0,3], say 2. Is 2 in A? A is [-1,3], so yes. Is 2 in complement of B? complement of B is (0,5), so yes. Therefore, 2 is in the intersection.How about 0? 0 is not in complement of B (since complement is (0,5)), so 0 is excluded. How about 3? 3 is in A and in complement of B? Wait, complement of B is (0,5). 3 is between 0 and 5, so yes, 3 is in complement of B. Wait, but complement of B is (0,5), open at 5, but 3 is less than 5, so 3 is included. Therefore, 3 is in complement of B. Therefore, since 3 is in both A and complement of B, it is included in the intersection.Similarly, 0.5 is in (0,3], so it&#39;s in the intersection. 0.5 is in A and in complement of B.How about a number just above 0, like 0.1? 0.1 is in A (since -1 ≤ 0.1 ≤ 3) and in complement of B (since 0 &lt; 0.1 &lt;5). So included.A number like 4 is in complement of B (since 0 &lt;4 &lt;5), but 4 is not in A (since 4 &gt;3). So not in the intersection.Similarly, a number like -0.5 is in A (since -1 ≤ -0.5 ≤3) but not in complement of B (since -0.5 ≤0), so excluded.Therefore, the intersection is indeed (0,3].I think that&#39;s correct. So, the final answer is boxed{(0, 3]}.Final Answerboxed{(0, 3]}&lt;/think&gt;To find ( A cap (complement_{mathbb{R}} B) ), we start by determining the intervals for sets ( A ) and ( B ).1. Set ( A ):   - The inequality ( x^2 - 2x - 3 leq 0 ) is solved by factoring the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 ).   - Factoring gives ( (x + 1)(x - 3) = 0 ), with roots ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 3 ).   - The quadratic opens upwards, so the solution to the inequality is the interval ([-1, 3]). Thus, ( A = [-1, 3] ).2. Set ( B ):   - The inequality ( x^2 - 5x geq 0 ) is solved by factoring the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 5x = 0 ).   - Factoring gives ( x(x - 5) = 0 ), with roots ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 5 ).   - The quadratic opens upwards, so the solution to the inequality is the union of intervals ((-infty, 0] cup [5, infty)). Thus, ( B = (-infty, 0] cup [5, infty) ).3. Complement of ( B ):   - The complement of ( B ) in (mathbb{R}) is the interval not included in ( B ), which is ( (0, 5) ).4. Intersection ( A cap (complement_{mathbb{R}} B) ):   - We need the overlap between ( A = [-1, 3] ) and ( complement_{mathbb{R}} B = (0, 5) ).   - The intersection of ([-1, 3]) and ((0, 5)) is the interval from (0) (exclusive) to (3) (inclusive), which is ((0, 3]).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{(0, 3]}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have two sets, A and B. Set A is all real numbers x such that x squared minus 2x minus 3 is less than or equal to zero. And set B is all real numbers x such that x squared minus 5x is greater than or equal to zero. Then we need to find the intersection of A and the complement of B in the real numbers. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what sets A and B actually look like. Since they&#39;re defined by quadratic inequalities, maybe solving those inequalities will give me intervals for each set, and then I can find their intersection and complements accordingly.Starting with set A: A = {x | x² - 2x - 3 ≤ 0}. To solve this inequality, I can factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first. The quadratic is x² - 2x - 3. Let&#39;s see, I need two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Hmm, maybe 1 and -3? Because 1 * (-3) = -3 and 1 + (-3) = -2. Yes, that works. So, factoring gives (x + 1)(x - 3) ≤ 0. Now, to find the solution to the inequality (x + 1)(x - 3) ≤ 0, I can consider the critical points where each factor is zero, which are x = -1 and x = 3. These points divide the real number line into three intervals: (-∞, -1), (-1, 3), and (3, ∞). To determine where the product is less than or equal to zero, I can test a value from each interval.For interval (-∞, -1), let&#39;s pick x = -2. Plugging in, we get (-2 + 1)(-2 - 3) = (-1)(-5) = 5, which is positive. So this interval is not part of the solution.For interval (-1, 3), let&#39;s choose x = 0. Then (0 + 1)(0 - 3) = (1)(-3) = -3, which is negative. So this interval is part of the solution.For interval (3, ∞), let&#39;s take x = 4. (4 + 1)(4 - 3) = (5)(1) = 5, which is positive again. So this interval is not part of the solution.Additionally, we need to check the endpoints x = -1 and x = 3. At x = -1, the expression is (0)(-4) = 0, which satisfies the inequality. Similarly, at x = 3, the expression is (4)(0) = 0, which also satisfies the inequality. Therefore, the solution to set A is the closed interval [-1, 3].Okay, got set A sorted out. Now moving on to set B: B = {x | x² - 5x ≥ 0}. Let&#39;s tackle this inequality. Again, maybe factoring is the way to go. The quadratic is x² - 5x. Factor out an x to get x(x - 5) ≥ 0.So, the critical points here are x = 0 and x = 5. These divide the real line into three intervals: (-∞, 0), (0, 5), and (5, ∞). Let&#39;s test each interval.For (-∞, 0), let&#39;s pick x = -1. Then (-1)(-1 - 5) = (-1)(-6) = 6, which is positive. So this interval is part of the solution.For (0, 5), let&#39;s choose x = 1. Then (1)(1 - 5) = (1)(-4) = -4, which is negative. So this interval is not part of the solution.For (5, ∞), let&#39;s take x = 6. Then (6)(6 - 5) = (6)(1) = 6, which is positive. So this interval is part of the solution.Checking the endpoints: at x = 0, the expression is 0*(0 - 5) = 0, which is equal to zero, so it&#39;s included. Similarly, at x = 5, the expression is 5*(5 - 5) = 5*0 = 0, which is also included. Therefore, the solution for set B is (-∞, 0] ∪ [5, ∞).Now, the problem asks for A ∩ (complement of B). The complement of B in ℝ would be all real numbers not in B, which is the interval (0, 5) because B was (-∞, 0] ∪ [5, ∞). So complement of B is ℝ  B = (0, 5). Wait, but we need to check if the endpoints are included. Since B includes 0 and 5, the complement does not include them. Therefore, complement of B is (0, 5).Therefore, A ∩ (complement of B) is the intersection of [-1, 3] and (0, 5). Let&#39;s visualize this. Set A is from -1 to 3, including both endpoints. The complement of B is from 0 to 5, not including 0 and 5. The intersection of these two would be the overlap between [-1, 3] and (0, 5). The overlapping interval is from 0 to 3. However, since the complement of B doesn&#39;t include 0, the interval will be (0, 3]. Wait, but set A includes 3, and the complement of B doesn&#39;t include 5, but since 3 is less than 5, 3 is included in the complement of B&#39;s interval? Wait, no. The complement of B is (0, 5). So 3 is within (0, 5), so 3 is included in the complement of B&#39;s complement? Wait, no. Wait, complement of B is (0,5). So 3 is in (0,5). Therefore, the intersection of A and complement of B is the set of all x such that x is in A and x is in complement of B. So x must be between -1 and 3, inclusive, and also between 0 and 5, not inclusive. So the overlap is between 0 and 3. Since 3 is included in A, but complement of B is up to 5, which is open at 5. However, 3 is less than 5, so 3 is included in the complement of B. Wait, but complement of B is (0,5), which is open at 5 but since 3 is less than 5, 3 is still included. Wait, no. (0,5) means all numbers greater than 0 and less than 5. So 3 is less than 5, so 3 is included. Wait, but 3 is included in set A. So the intersection is [0,3]. Wait, but complement of B is (0,5), so the intersection is (0,3], because A includes 3, but complement of B includes up to 5, not including 5, but 3 is included since 3 &lt;5. Wait, actually, in the complement of B, (0,5), all points between 0 and 5, not including 0 and 5. So 3 is included in complement of B. So the intersection of [-1,3] and (0,5) is (0,3]. Because:- From A, we have [-1,3].- From complement of B, we have (0,5).- The overlap is where both are true: x must be greater than 0 (since complement of B starts at 0, not inclusive) and less than or equal to 3 (since A ends at 3, inclusive). Therefore, (0,3].Wait, but let me double-check. If complement of B is (0,5), then in the overlap with A, which is [-1,3], the lower bound is 0 (exclusive) and upper bound is 3 (inclusive). So yes, the interval (0,3].But wait, does 3 actually belong to the complement of B? Let&#39;s check. The complement of B is all x where x² -5x &lt;0. Let&#39;s plug in x=3. x² -5x = 9 -15 = -6 &lt;0. So yes, 3 is in the complement of B. So 3 is included. But since complement of B is (0,5), which is an open interval, but the inequality x² -5x &lt;0 is true for x in (0,5). So if x=3, which is in (0,5), satisfies the inequality. So yes, x=3 is included in the complement of B. Therefore, the intersection is (0,3], since in A, 3 is included, and in complement of B, 3 is included. Wait, but complement of B is (0,5), which is open at 0 and 5. So x=3 is in (0,5). So x=3 is included in the complement of B. Therefore, the intersection is (0,3], since the lower bound is 0 (exclusive) and upper bound 3 (inclusive). Wait, but if complement of B is (0,5), and A is [-1,3], then the intersection is (0,3], right?Yes, because the overlap between [-1,3] and (0,5) is from 0 to 3. Since 0 is excluded by complement of B, but 3 is included by A. But complement of B includes up to 5, but 3 is within that. So the upper bound is 3, inclusive. Therefore, the intersection is (0,3].But let me confirm once again. Let&#39;s take a number just above 0, say 0.5. Is 0.5 in both A and complement of B? Yes, because 0.5 is in [-1,3] and in (0,5). Similarly, take 3. 3 is in A and in complement of B? Since complement of B is (0,5), 3 is in there. So yes, 3 is included. So the interval is (0,3].But hold on, complement of B is (0,5). So when we take the intersection with A, which is up to 3, inclusive. So from 0 to 3, with 0 excluded and 3 included. Hence, (0,3].Alternatively, if I write it in interval notation, that&#39;s correct. So the answer should be (0,3]. But let me check again with the original inequalities.Set A is x such that x² -2x -3 ≤0, which is [-1,3].Set B is x such that x² -5x ≥0, which is (-∞,0] ∪ [5, ∞). Therefore, the complement of B is (0,5).So A ∩ complement of B is all x such that x is in [-1,3] and x is in (0,5). So the intersection is (0,3]. Because:- x must be greater than 0 (from complement of B) and less than or equal to 3 (from A). So yes, (0,3].Therefore, the final answer should be (0,3], which in boxed form is boxed{(0, 3]}.But wait, in some conventions, the interval notation might use parentheses for open and brackets for closed. So (0,3] is correct here. However, maybe the problem expects the answer in a different form. Let me just make sure.Alternatively, if the problem is given in terms of sets defined with inequalities, perhaps writing the answer in inequality form. But I think interval notation is acceptable here.Alternatively, double-check the endpoints.At x=0: is x in A? A is [-1,3], so 0 is in A. But complement of B is (0,5), so 0 is not in complement of B. Therefore, 0 is excluded. At x=3: 3 is in A and 3 is in complement of B (since 3 is in (0,5)), so 3 is included. Therefore, the interval is (0,3].Yes, that seems correct.Final Answerboxed{(0, 3]}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to find the intersection of set (A) and the complement of set (B) in (mathbb{R}).1. Determine set (A):   - The inequality for set (A) is (x^2 - 2x - 3 leq 0).   - Factoring the quadratic: ((x + 1)(x - 3) leq 0).   - The critical points are (x = -1) and (x = 3). Testing intervals around these points, we find the solution is ([-1, 3]).2. Determine set (B):   - The inequality for set (B) is (x^2 - 5x geq 0).   - Factoring the quadratic: (x(x - 5) geq 0).   - The critical points are (x = 0) and (x = 5). Testing intervals around these points, we find the solution is ((-infty, 0] cup [5, infty)).3. Find the complement of (B):   - The complement of (B) in (mathbb{R}) is the interval ((0, 5)).4. Find the intersection (A cap (complement_{mathbb{R}} B)):   - Set (A) is ([-1, 3]).   - The complement of (B) is ((0, 5)).   - The intersection of ([-1, 3]) and ((0, 5)) is the interval ((0, 3]).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{(0, 3]}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-39a2a286></div><p class="review-content" data-v-39a2a286><span class="icon" data-v-39a2a286>🔑:</span>From the given, B={x|x^2-5xgeq0}={x|xleq0 text{ or } xgeq5}, hence complement_{mathbb{R}}B={x|0&lt;x&lt;5}.Also, the set A={x|x^2-2x-3leq0}={x|-1leq xleq3}.Therefore, Acap(complement_{mathbb{R}}B)=(0,3].So, the answer is boxed{(0,3]}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-2b4e9ccb><span data-v-2b4e9ccb>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
