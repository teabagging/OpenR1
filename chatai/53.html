data-v-b2c58cb1><span class="icon" data-v-b2c58cb1>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which group of data has the smallest range. The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me remember that the range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. So, for each group, I should find the highest number and the lowest number, subtract them, and see which one gives the smallest result.Let me start with option A: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The maximum here is 4, and the minimum is 0. So the range is 4 - 0 = 4. That seems straightforward.Next is option B: -2, -1, -2, 3. Let me check the numbers again. The highest number here is 3, and the lowest is -2. So the range would be 3 - (-2). Wait, subtracting a negative is like adding the positive. So 3 + 2 = 5. So the range for B is 5. Hmm, that&#39;s larger than A&#39;s 4.Moving on to option C: 110, 111, 112, 110, 109. Let me identify the max and min here. The numbers are 109, 110, 110, 111, 112. So the maximum is 112, and the minimum is 109. The range is 112 - 109 = 3. Oh, that&#39;s smaller than A&#39;s 4. So C currently has the smallest range.Now option D: -100, -200, -300, -400. The maximum here is -100, and the minimum is -400. So the range is (-100) - (-400) = (-100) + 400 = 300. That&#39;s a huge range compared to the others.So summarizing:- A&#39;s range is 4- B&#39;s range is 5- C&#39;s range is 3- D&#39;s range is 300Therefore, the smallest range is in option C with a range of 3. Let me just double-check each calculation to be sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.For A: 4 - 0 = 4. Correct.For B: 3 - (-2) = 5. Right.For C: 112 - 109 = 3. Yes.For D: -100 - (-400) = 300. Yep.No mistakes noticed. So the answer should be option C.&lt;/think&gt;The range of each group is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value:- A: (4 - 0 = 4)- B: (3 - (-2) = 5)- C: (112 - 109 = 3)- D: (-100 - (-400) = 300)Among these, the smallest range is 3 from group C.boxed{C},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given groups A, B, C, or D has the smallest range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset, right? Let me start by recalling the formula for range: Range = Maximum value - Minimum value. That makes sense. So for each group, I should identify the maximum and minimum numbers and subtract them to find the range. Then compare all the ranges to see which is the smallest. Let&#39;s tackle each group one by one.Starting with Group A: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The numbers here are from 0 to 4. Let me check the maximum and minimum. The highest number is 4, and the lowest is 0. So the range would be 4 - 0 = 4. That seems straightforward.Moving on to Group B: -2, -1, -2, 3. Hmm, here there are both negative and positive numbers. Let me list them again: -2, -1, -2, 3. The maximum value here is 3, right? And the minimum value is -2. So the range would be 3 - (-2). Wait, subtracting a negative is like adding the positive. So 3 + 2 = 5. So the range for Group B is 5. That&#39;s bigger than Group A&#39;s range of 4 so far.Next is Group C: 110, 111, 112, 110, 109. Let me see. These numbers are all around 109 to 112. Let me confirm the max and min. The highest is 112, and the lowest is 109. So the range is 112 - 109 = 3. Oh, that&#39;s a smaller range than Group A. So Group C has a range of 3. That&#39;s the smallest so far.Lastly, Group D: -100, -200, -300, -400. All negative numbers here. The maximum value would be -100 because that&#39;s the closest to zero, and the minimum is -400. So the range is -100 - (-400). Again, subtracting a negative is adding the positive. So -100 + 400 = 300. That&#39;s a really large range. Definitely bigger than the others.So summarizing:- Group A: 4- Group B: 5- Group C: 3- Group D: 300Therefore, the smallest range is in Group C with a range of 3. Wait, let me double-check each calculation to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Group A: Max 4, Min 0. 4 - 0 = 4. Correct.Group B: Max 3, Min -2. 3 - (-2) = 5. Correct.Group C: Max 112, Min 109. 112 - 109 = 3. Correct.Group D: Max -100, Min -400. -100 - (-400) = 300. Correct.Yes, all calculations seem right. So the answer should be option C. Let me just check the problem statement again to make sure I didn&#39;t misread anything. The question says &quot;the one with the smallest range,&quot; and the options are A, B, C, D. Yep, Group C has the smallest range of 3. So I think that&#39;s the correct answer.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which group has the smallest range, we calculate the range for each group by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values.- Group A: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4    - Maximum value: 4    - Minimum value: 0    - Range: (4 - 0 = 4)- Group B: -2, -1, -2, 3    - Maximum value: 3    - Minimum value: -2    - Range: (3 - (-2) = 3 + 2 = 5)- Group C: 110, 111, 112, 110, 109    - Maximum value: 112    - Minimum value: 109    - Range: (112 - 109 = 3)- Group D: -100, -200, -300, -400    - Maximum value: -100    - Minimum value: -400    - Range: (-100 - (-400) = -100 + 400 = 300)Comparing the ranges: 4 (A), 5 (B), 3 (C), and 300 (D).

So the problem is about probability with different colored balls in a bag. The colors are red, white, and black. We need to find out how many black balls there are. The given information includes the probability of drawing a red ball is 0.42, the probability of drawing a white ball is 0.28, and there are 21 red balls. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, probabilities. If we have probabilities for red and white, then maybe the probability for black can be found by subtracting the sum of red and white probabilities from 1, since total probability should be 1, right? Let me check. So, P(red) = 0.42, P(white) = 0.28. Then, P(black) = 1 - 0.42 - 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 minus 0.42 is 0.58, and then minus 0.28 would be 0.30. So, P(black) = 0.30. Okay, that seems straightforward.Now, they tell us there are 21 red balls. Since probability is the number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes, we can use that to find the total number of balls. Let&#39;s denote the total number of balls as N. Then, the probability of drawing a red ball is number of red balls over total balls. So, 21/N = 0.42. To find N, we can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by N: 21 = 0.42 * N. Then divide both sides by 0.42: N = 21 / 0.42. Let me compute that. 21 divided by 0.42. Hmm, 0.42 goes into 21 how many times? Let me think. Since 0.42 * 50 is 21, because 0.42 * 10 = 4.2, so 4.2 * 5 = 21, so 10 * 5 = 50. Therefore, N = 50. So, total balls are 50.Now, if there are 50 total balls, and 21 are red, then the number of white and black balls combined is 50 - 21 = 29. But we can find each separately. Since we know the probability of white is 0.28, which would be number of white balls over total balls. So, number of white balls is 0.28 * N. N is 50, so 0.28 * 50. Let&#39;s compute that. 0.28 * 50. 0.28 * 10 is 2.8, so 2.8 * 5 = 14. So, there are 14 white balls.Then, number of black balls would be total balls minus red minus white. So, 50 - 21 - 14. Let&#39;s calculate that. 21 + 14 is 35, so 50 - 35 is 15. Therefore, there are 15 black balls.Wait, let me verify this another way. Since the probability of black is 0.30, then number of black balls should be 0.30 * 50 = 15. Yep, that matches. So that seems consistent.So, all steps check out. First, find total number of balls using red probability and number of red balls. Then, compute white balls using its probability, subtract both red and white from total to get black balls. Alternatively, using the probability of black directly also gives the same answer. So, that&#39;s solid.I think that&#39;s it. The answer should be 15 black balls.Final AnswerThe number of black balls is boxed{15}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find the number of black balls in a bag containing red, white, and black balls. The probabilities of drawing a red ball and a white ball are 0.42 and 0.28, respectively, and there are 21 red balls.First, we calculate the total number of balls, ( N ), using the probability of drawing a red ball:[frac{21}{N} = 0.42]Solving for ( N ):[N = frac{21}{0.42} = 50]Next, we use the probability of drawing a white ball to find the number of white balls:[text{Number of white balls} = 0.28 times 50 = 14]The number of black balls is then found by subtracting the number of red and white balls from the total number of balls:[text{Number of black balls} = 50 - 21 - 14 = 15]We verify this by using the probability of drawing a black ball, which is:[1 - 0.42 - 0.28 = 0.30]Calculating the number of black balls using this probability:[text{Number of black balls} = 0.30 times 50 = 15]Both methods confirm that the number of black balls is boxed{15}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. There&#39;s a problem about balls in a bag: red, white, and black. The probability of drawing a red ball is 0.42, and white is 0.28. They tell us there are 21 red balls, and we need to find the number of black balls. Hmm, okay.So, probability is the number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes. So, if the probability of red is 0.42, that should be the number of red balls over the total number of balls. Similarly, probability of white is 0.28, so that&#39;s white balls over total. Then the rest should be black balls, right?They give the number of red balls as 21. So, if I let the total number of balls be N, then 21/N = 0.42. Then I can solve for N. Let me write that down.Let N be the total number of balls. Then:Number of red balls / Total = Probability of red21 / N = 0.42So, solving for N:N = 21 / 0.42Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 0.42. Hmm, 0.42 times 50 is 21, right? Because 0.42 * 50 = 21. So N = 50. So there are 50 balls in total.Then, probability of white is 0.28, so number of white balls is 0.28 * N. Which would be 0.28 * 50. Let&#39;s compute that. 0.28 * 50. 0.28 * 100 is 28, so half of that is 14. So 14 white balls.So total red and white balls are 21 + 14 = 35. Therefore, the remaining balls are black. So total black balls = 50 - 35 = 15. So there are 15 black balls.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. If there are 21 red balls, total is 50, so probability red is 21/50, which is 0.42. Then white is 14/50, which is 0.28. Then black would be 15/50, which is 0.3. So 0.42 + 0.28 + 0.3 = 1.0, which checks out. So seems correct.But let me think again. The problem didn&#39;t mention anything about the probability of black, but since all probabilities must add up to 1, the probability of black would be 1 - 0.42 - 0.28 = 0.3. Then number of black balls is 0.3 * N. Which would be 0.3 * 50 = 15. So same answer.Alternatively, maybe the problem is tricking me, but I don&#39;t see how. The balls are red, white, black, so all three categories. They told me the number of red balls, so with that I found total, then white, subtract both from total to get black. Seems solid.Wait, another way: if there are 21 red balls with probability 0.42, that&#39;s 21 is 42% of total. So 1% is 21/42 = 0.5, so 100% is 50. Yeah, same answer. Then 28% would be 0.5 *28=14 white. Then 100% -42% -28% =30%, so 15 black. Yep.So I think the answer is 15.Final AnswerThe number of black balls is boxed{15}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find the number of black balls in a bag containing red, white, and black balls. The probability of drawing a red ball is 0.42, the probability of drawing a white ball is 0.28, and there are 21 red balls.First, we determine the total number of balls, ( N ), using the probability of drawing a red ball:[frac{21}{N} = 0.42]Solving for ( N ):[N = frac{21}{0.42} = 50]Next, we calculate the number of white balls using the given probability:[text{Number of white balls} = 0.28 times 50 = 14]The total number of red and white balls is:[21 + 14 = 35]Subtracting this from the total number of balls gives the number of black balls:[50 - 35 = 15]Thus, the number of black balls is (boxed{15}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b2c58cb1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b2c58cb1><span class="icon" data-v-b2c58cb1>🔑:</span>Analysis of the Problem:When drawing balls from the bag, the events of drawing a red ball, a black ball, or a white ball are mutually exclusive.

In a square of grid paper containing an integer number of cells, a hole in the shape of a square, also consisting of an integer number of cells, was cut out. How many cells did the large square contain if 209 cells remained after the cutout?</div><div class="divider" data-v-b2c58cb1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b2c58cb1><span class="icon" data-v-b2c58cb1>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. So the problem is about a big square grid paper where a smaller square hole was cut out, and after cutting out, there are 209 cells remaining. We need to find out how many cells the original large square had. Hmm, alright, let&#39;s break this down.First, both the large square and the hole are made up of integer numbers of cells. That means their sides must be integer lengths because each cell is a unit square. Let&#39;s denote the side length of the large square as ( N ) and the side length of the hole as ( n ). Then, the number of cells in the large square is ( N^2 ), and the number of cells in the hole is ( n^2 ). The remaining cells after the hole is cut out would be ( N^2 - n^2 = 209 ).So, the equation we need to solve is ( N^2 - n^2 = 209 ). Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares. Remember, ( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) ). So, we can factor the left side as ( (N - n)(N + n) = 209 ).Now, since ( N ) and ( n ) are positive integers with ( N &gt; n ), both ( N - n ) and ( N + n ) must also be positive integers. Moreover, ( N - n ) and ( N + n ) are factors of 209. So, we need to find pairs of factors of 209 such that when we multiply them, we get 209, and also satisfy that ( N - n ) and ( N + n ) have the same parity (since ( N ) and ( n ) are integers, their sum and difference must both be even or both be odd).Let me check the factors of 209. First, prime factors. Let&#39;s see: 209 divided by 11 is 19, because 11*19=209. And 19 is prime. So the prime factors are 11 and 19. Therefore, the positive divisors of 209 are 1, 11, 19, and 209.So, the possible pairs of factors (d, e) such that d*e = 209 are (1, 209) and (11, 19). Let&#39;s check these pairs.First pair: (1, 209). So, ( N - n = 1 ) and ( N + n = 209 ). If we add these two equations: ( (N - n) + (N + n) = 1 + 209 ) =&gt; ( 2N = 210 ) =&gt; ( N = 105 ). Then, substituting back, ( 105 - n = 1 ) =&gt; ( n = 104 ). But wait, if the hole is of side length 104 and the original square is 105, that&#39;s possible? The hole would be just one cell smaller on each side? Wait, but cutting out a square hole from a grid paper. If the hole is a square, does the position matter? Hmm, maybe. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify where the hole is, just that it&#39;s cut out. But if the hole is 104x104, then the remaining area would be 105^2 - 104^2 = (105 - 104)(105 + 104) = 1*209 = 209, which matches. So technically, this is a valid solution. But intuitively, having a hole almost as big as the original square seems odd, but mathematically, it&#39;s possible. Let&#39;s note this solution.Second pair: (11, 19). So, ( N - n = 11 ) and ( N + n = 19 ). Adding these: ( 2N = 30 ) =&gt; ( N = 15 ). Then, substituting back, ( 15 - n = 11 ) =&gt; ( n = 4 ). So the original square is 15x15, and the hole is 4x4. Then, 15^2 - 4^2 = 225 - 16 = 209, which is correct. So this is another valid solution.So, there are two possible solutions? Wait, the problem says &quot;the large square&quot; which implies there&#39;s a unique answer. Hmm. Maybe there&#39;s some constraints we missed. Let&#39;s check the problem again: &quot;a hole in the shape of a square, also consisting of an integer number of cells, was cut out.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify where the hole is located. However, in grid paper, if you have a square hole cut out, depending on the size of the hole, you might need the original square to be large enough to actually have such a hole. For example, if the original square is 15x15, and the hole is 4x4, you can have the hole somewhere inside. Similarly, if the original square is 105x105, the hole is 104x104. But where would you place a 104x104 hole in a 105x105 grid? It would have to be adjacent to one side, leaving a border of 1 cell on three sides and 1 cell on the fourth. But is that possible? Technically, yes. So both solutions might be valid.But the problem is probably expecting the smaller solution, since 105x105 seems excessively large. But the problem doesn&#39;t give any other constraints. So maybe both are possible? Wait, the problem is translated from Chinese, maybe in the original problem, there was an implication that the hole is smaller than the square in a way that it&#39;s surrounded by borders on all sides. But since it&#39;s not specified here, we can&#39;t assume that.Wait, but let&#39;s check if the problem says &quot;containing an integer number of cells&quot; for both the original square and the hole. So, the original square has N^2 cells, hole has n^2 cells. So the equation is N^2 - n^2 = 209, which factors into (N - n)(N + n) = 209. Since 209 factors into 11*19, which are both primes, so the factor pairs are (1, 209) and (11, 19). Therefore, possible N and n are (105, 104) and (15,4). Therefore, the problem might have two solutions. But the question asks &quot;How many cells did the large square contain...&quot; which implies a unique answer. So maybe the problem assumes that the hole is non-trivial, not just a border of 1 cell. But unless specified, both solutions are possible.But the original problem in Chinese might have had more context, but here we have to go with what&#39;s given. Since the problem states that after the hole is cut out, 209 cells remain. So both possibilities exist. But maybe 209 is such that only one of the factor pairs leads to a valid grid. Wait, but how? Let me think.Alternatively, maybe when you cut out a square hole from a grid paper, the hole must be at least 1x1, but there&#39;s no upper limit as long as it&#39;s smaller than the original square. So both solutions are valid. However, the problem says &quot;a square of grid paper containing an integer number of cells, a hole in the shape of a square, also consisting of an integer number of cells, was cut out.&quot; So both the original and the hole have integer number of cells, so N^2 and n^2. Therefore, both solutions are possible. Hence, the problem might be expecting both answers? But the way the question is phrased, &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, suggests that there&#39;s a unique answer. Hmm.Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the hole is cut out from the interior, so the remaining figure is still a single piece? But with grid squares, if you have a square hole of size 104x104 in a 105x105 square, the remaining cells would form a border of 1 cell around the hole. That would actually be a ring of width 1, which is connected, right? Because all the cells on the perimeter of the original square and the perimeter of the hole would form a connected ring. Similarly, a 4x4 hole in a 15x15 square would leave a larger border. So both are connected. So, perhaps both are acceptable.But maybe the problem is from an Olympiad where only one answer is expected. Let&#39;s check 209. The problem says &quot;if 209 cells remained after the cutout&quot;. So the original square had 209 + n^2 cells. So, possible original squares are 209 + 16 = 225, which is 15^2, or 209 + 104^2 = 209 + 10816 = 11025, which is 105^2. So, 225 or 11025. Both are perfect squares. But unless there&#39;s a constraint in the problem that&#39;s not translated, perhaps we need to consider that the hole must be at least 1x1 and smaller than the original square, which both satisfy. So, perhaps both answers are possible, but the problem is expecting both? But in the instructions, it says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot; which usually indicates a single answer. Hmm.Wait, let me check the factorization again. 209 = 11*19. So the factor pairs are (1, 209) and (11, 19). So the solutions would be N=(1+209)/2=105, n=(209-1)/2=104, and N=(11+19)/2=15, n=(19-11)/2=4. So both solutions are valid. But perhaps in the context of the problem, the answer is 225 (15x15), since 105x105 is too large. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify any constraints on the size. Maybe it&#39;s a trick question where you have to list both? But in Chinese math problems, sometimes they expect all possible answers. But in the translation here, it&#39;s stated as &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, which is singular. Hmm. Maybe in the original problem, there was an image or some other constraint. But given the information here, both 225 and 11025 are possible.Wait, but 209 is the remaining cells, which is given. Let me check if there are other factor pairs. Since 209 is 11*19, which are primes, the only positive integer factor pairs are (1, 209) and (11, 19). So, only two possibilities. So both 15 and 105 are possible. Therefore, the answer could be either 225 or 11025. But the problem is likely expecting the smaller one, as 105x105 is huge and maybe beyond typical problem ranges. But without more constraints, I can&#39;t be sure. However, in math competitions, often such problems expect the minimal solution unless stated otherwise. So maybe 225 is the answer intended. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that both answers are acceptable. Wait, but since the problem says &quot;the large square&quot;, perhaps the 105x105 is the large square, but then the hole is also large. But both original squares are larger than the hole. Hmm.Wait, maybe the term &quot;large square&quot; is just referring to the original square, regardless of its size. So both are possible. However, the problem might have a unique answer, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the equations again.So N^2 - n^2 = 209. Which factors into (N - n)(N + n) = 209. Since 209 = 11*19, and 11 and 19 are both primes. So the factor pairs are (1, 209) and (11, 19). Then solving for N and n:For (1, 209):N - n = 1N + n = 209Adding: 2N = 210 =&gt; N = 105Then n = 105 - 1 = 104For (11, 19):N - n = 11N + n = 19Adding: 2N = 30 =&gt; N = 15Then n = 15 - 11 = 4So both solutions are valid. Therefore, the original square could have been 105x105 or 15x15. Since the problem is asking &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, and there are two possible answers, but in the problem statement, maybe &quot;the large square&quot; is in comparison to the hole, but both original squares are larger than their respective holes. So perhaps both answers are acceptable.But given the problem is presented as having a unique answer, and since 15x15 is a more reasonable size, maybe that&#39;s the expected answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem comes from a source where only the smaller solution is considered. In many math problems, especially those that are Olympiad-style, often the smaller solution is expected unless there&#39;s a specific reason to consider larger ones. For example, if the hole must be at least 2x2 or something, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that. Since 1x1 hole is possible, but in that case, 105x105 with 104x104 hole is equivalent to a 1-cell wide border, which is valid.But perhaps the problem is translated in a way that &quot;a hole&quot; implies a non-trivial hole, not just removing a single row or column. But a 104x104 hole is a huge hole, but still a hole. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a competition where the answer is unique, so perhaps I missed something.Wait, another thought. When you cut out a square hole from a square grid, the remaining figure must still be a connected region. If you have a 105x105 square and cut out a 104x104 hole, the remaining cells would be a 1-cell wide border around the hole. But is this connected? Yes, because all the cells on the outer edge are connected, and they form a loop around the hole. So it&#39;s a single connected region. Similarly, cutting a 4x4 hole from a 15x15 square, the remaining area is a 11-cell wide border around the hole, which is also connected. So both are acceptable.Hmm. So since both solutions are possible, but the problem asks for &quot;the large square&quot;, implying maybe the larger one? Wait, no. The problem says &quot;the large square&quot; to differentiate it from the hole, which is a smaller square. So &quot;the large square&quot; refers to the original, regardless of its size. Therefore, there are two possible answers.But the problem is presented in a way that expects a single answer. Maybe the original problem in Chinese had more constraints, like the hole is at least 1x1, but here, since it&#39;s translated without those constraints, we might need to list both. However, in the format here, the user says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which typically is for a single answer. Maybe the problem assumes that the hole is smaller than the original square by at least 2 in each direction? But that&#39;s an assumption. Alternatively, maybe only one factor pair results in both N and n being integers. Wait, but both solutions have integer N and n.Wait, let me check N and n for both cases.First solution: N=105, n=104. Both integers. Second solution: N=15, n=4. Also integers. So both are valid.Therefore, the answer is that the original square had either 225 or 11025 cells. But since the problem asks &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, maybe both answers are acceptable. But given that in many math problems, especially if it&#39;s from an Olympiad, they might expect all solutions. But since the user hasn&#39;t specified, and the instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually expects one answer, maybe the intended answer is 225, considering 15x15 as the more reasonable size. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that both answers are possible, but I need to check.Wait, but 209 is the number of remaining cells. Let me verify both solutions:First, 15x15 = 225. Minus 4x4=16, so 225 - 16 = 209. Correct.Second, 105x105=11025. Minus 104x104=10816, 11025 - 10816=209. Correct.So both are correct. Therefore, the problem might have two solutions. However, the question is translated as &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, which is a single question. If it&#39;s from a competition where answers are single numbers, maybe both 225 and 11025 are acceptable. But since the user is asking for the answer in boxed notation, which is usually for a single answer, maybe the problem expects both answers. But how to represent that?Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific source that only accepts 225 as the answer. But given that we don&#39;t have more context, we can&#39;t be sure. So, perhaps the answer is 225, as the smaller and more reasonable one. Alternatively, the problem may have a unique solution if we assume that the hole cannot be of size N-1, because you can&#39;t have a hole that leaves a 1-cell border, but that&#39;s an assumption not stated in the problem.Wait, another thought. If you cut out a square hole from a square grid, you have to remove the entire smaller square. If the hole is 104x104 in a 105x105 grid, you can do that by removing all but the outermost layer. However, in some contexts, a &quot;hole&quot; might mean that it&#39;s surrounded by the remaining cells on all sides. If the hole is 104x104, then it&#39;s adjacent to the edge, so it&#39;s not surrounded on all sides. Wait, no. If the hole is 104x104, placed in the corner, then three sides of the hole are adjacent to the remaining border, but one side is along the edge of the original square. Wait, no. If the original square is 105x105, and you remove a 104x104 square from it, you have to remove a block of 104x104 cells. If you remove it starting from, say, the top-left corner, then the remaining cells would be the rightmost column and the bottom row, but that&#39;s only a 1x105 column and a 1x105 row, overlapping at the bottom-right corner. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I&#39;m confusing how the hole is positioned.Wait, actually, if you have a 105x105 grid and you cut out a 104x104 hole, you need to remove 104x104 cells. If you remove a contiguous block of 104x104 cells from the grid, you can&#39;t have that block extending beyond the original square. So the hole must be entirely within the original square. Therefore, to remove a 104x104 hole from a 105x105 square, the hole must be placed such that it is adjacent to one side, leaving a 1-cell wide strip on the opposite side. For example, if the hole starts at the first row and first column, occupying rows 1 to 104 and columns 1 to 104, then the remaining cells would be the 105th row and 105th column, but that&#39;s only 105 + 105 -1 = 209 cells. Wait, hold on, rows are 1 to 105, columns 1 to 105. If the hole is rows 1-104 and columns 1-104, then the remaining cells are row 105 (columns 1-105) and column 105 (rows 1-104). But row 105 has 105 cells, column 105 has 104 cells, but the cell at (105, 105) is counted in both, so total remaining cells are 105 + 104 = 209. Yes, that works. So the remaining cells are the last row and the last column, overlapping at the last cell. So it&#39;s a sort of &quot;L&quot; shape, not a square. Wait, but the problem states that after cutting out the hole, 209 cells remained. It doesn&#39;t say that the remaining cells form a square. So even though the remaining cells form an &quot;L&quot; shape, it&#39;s still 209 cells. So that&#39;s acceptable. Therefore, this is a valid configuration.Similarly, cutting out a 4x4 hole from a 15x15 grid, the remaining cells would form a 15x15 square with a 4x4 square removed, which could be in the center, leaving a border around it. That would be a more conventional hole. So both configurations are valid, even though the shapes of the remaining cells are different.Therefore, both 225 and 11025 are valid answers. But since the problem asks for &quot;the large square&quot;, maybe both are acceptable, but in the absence of more information, we might have to list both. However, given the standard practice in such problems, and that the problem is presented in a way expecting a single answer, perhaps the intended answer is 225. But I need to check if there&#39;s a way the problem ensures a unique solution.Wait, another angle: maybe the problem is in the way the hole is cut. If the hole is cut out such that the remaining figure is still a square. Wait, but if you remove a square from a square, the remaining figure is not a square unless the hole is at the center and symmetrical. But even then, removing a central square would leave a square ring, which is not a full square. So the remaining figure is not a square. Therefore, the problem doesn&#39;t state that the remaining figure is a square, just that the original and the hole were squares. So the remaining cells don&#39;t have to form a square. So both solutions are valid.Therefore, given that both solutions are possible, but the problem is presented as having a unique answer, maybe the answer is 225. But why? Maybe in the problem statement in Chinese, it was specified that the hole is at the center, making the remaining figure an annulus (square ring), which would require that the original square has odd side length and the hole also has odd side length, so that it&#39;s centered. Let&#39;s check:In the 15x15 square, if you cut out a 4x4 hole, to center it, the hole would have to be placed from (6,6) to (9,9), assuming 1-based indexing. Then the remaining cells would form a square ring. However, 15-4=11, so the border would be 5 cells on each side. Wait, 15-4=11, so (15 - 4)/2=5.5, which is not integer. So actually, you can&#39;t center a 4x4 hole in a 15x15 square because 15 - 4 = 11, which is odd, so you can&#39;t split it evenly. Therefore, the hole would be off-center. Whereas, for the 105x105 square with a 104x104 hole, the remaining cells form a 1-cell wide border, which is effectively along one edge, making an L-shape as previously thought.Alternatively, if the original square has an even dimension, and the hole has an even dimension, you could center it. But 15 is odd, 4 is even. 105 is odd, 104 is even. So neither case allows for a perfectly centered hole. Therefore, perhaps the problem doesn&#39;t require the hole to be centered. So both solutions are acceptable.Therefore, unless there&#39;s a mistranslation or missing constraint in the problem, both 225 and 11025 are valid answers. Since the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, and given that the problem likely expects the smaller answer, I think the intended answer is 225. However, strictly speaking, both are possible. But since the problem is from a past competition, perhaps the answer is unique. Let me check 209.Wait, 209. The number 209 is the key here. When factoring 209 as (N - n)(N + n), and since N and n are positive integers, the factors must be both odd or both even. Since 209 is odd, both factors must be odd. Which they are in both pairs (1, 209) and (11, 19). So both are valid. Therefore, both solutions are possible.In conclusion, the problem has two solutions: 225 and 11025. However, given the problem&#39;s context and typical problem structures, the answer is likely 225. Therefore, I will go with that.Final AnswerThe large square contained boxed{225} cells.&lt;/think&gt;Given a square grid paper with an integer number of cells, a square hole with an integer number of cells was cut out, leaving 209 cells remaining. We need to determine the number of cells in the original large square.1. Let ( N ) be the side length of the large square and ( n ) be the side length of the hole. The remaining cells are given by ( N^2 - n^2 = 209 ).2. This equation can be factored using the difference of squares: ( (N - n)(N + n) = 209 ).3. The factors of 209 are 1, 11, 19, and 209. The pairs of factors are (1, 209) and (11, 19).4. For the pair (1, 209):   - Solving ( N - n = 1 ) and ( N + n = 209 ):     - Adding these equations: ( 2N = 210 ) gives ( N = 105 ).     - Subtracting these equations: ( 2n = 208 ) gives ( n = 104 ).   - The original square has ( 105^2 = 11025 ) cells.5. For the pair (11, 19):   - Solving ( N - n = 11 ) and ( N + n = 19 ):     - Adding these equations: ( 2N = 30 ) gives ( N = 15 ).     - Subtracting these equations: ( 2n = 8 ) gives ( n = 4 ).   - The original square has ( 15^2 = 225 ) cells.Both solutions are mathematically valid. However, considering typical problem constraints and the context of the problem, the more reasonable and likely intended answer is the smaller solution.[boxed{225}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here where there&#39;s a big square made of grid paper, right? And then they cut out a smaller square hole from it, which also has an integer number of cells. After cutting out that hole, there are 209 cells left. The question is asking how many cells the original large square had. Hmm, let&#39;s see how I can approach this.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a large square, so the number of cells in it would be some integer squared, like n² where n is the length of the square in cells. Then, a smaller square hole is cut out, which would be m² cells, where m is the length of the smaller square. The remaining cells are 209, so the equation here would be n² - m² = 209. And we need to find n², the original number of cells.Okay, so the equation is n² - m² = 209. Hmm, I remember that n² - m² can be factored as (n - m)(n + m). So, that gives us (n - m)(n + m) = 209. Now, 209 is the product of these two factors, (n - m) and (n + m). Since n and m are integers, both (n - m) and (n + m) must also be integers. Moreover, since n &gt; m (because we&#39;re cutting out a hole from the larger square), both (n - m) and (n + m) are positive integers. Also, (n - m) &lt; (n + m), right?So, the problem reduces to finding two positive integers such that their product is 209, and one is larger than the other. Then, from those two integers, we can find n and m. Let me see. So, first, I need to factorize 209 into two factors. Let&#39;s do that.209 divided by 11 is 19, because 11 times 19 is 209. Let me check: 11*18 is 198, plus 11 is 209. Yes, so 209 = 11 * 19. Are there any other factors? Let&#39;s check. 209 divided by 2 is 104.5, which is not integer. Divided by 3: 3*69 = 207, so remainder 2. Divided by 5: ends with 9, so not divisible by 5. 7: 7*29 is 203, remainder 6. So, no, 11 and 19 are the only prime factors. Therefore, the possible pairs of factors are 1 and 209, 11 and 19.But since (n - m) and (n + m) are both positive integers and (n - m) &lt; (n + m), then the possible factor pairs are (1, 209) and (11, 19). Let me consider each case.First case: (n - m) = 1 and (n + m) = 209.If I solve these two equations:n - m = 1n + m = 209Adding them together: 2n = 210 =&gt; n = 105. Then, substituting back, m = n - 1 = 104. So, n = 105, m = 104. Therefore, the original square had 105² cells. Let me compute 105²: 100² is 10,000; 5² is 25; 2*100*5 is 1,000. So, 10,000 + 1,000 + 25 = 11,025. Then, the hole is 104². Let me check 104²: 100² + 2*100*4 + 4² = 10,000 + 800 + 16 = 10,816. Then, subtracting those: 11,025 - 10,816 = 209. Yes, that works. So, that&#39;s one possible solution.Second case: (n - m) = 11 and (n + m) = 19.So solving these two equations:n - m = 11n + m = 19Adding them: 2n = 30 =&gt; n = 15. Then, m = n - 11 = 15 - 11 = 4. So, n = 15, m = 4. Let&#39;s check: 15² is 225, 4² is 16. Then, 225 - 16 = 209. That also works. So, that&#39;s another possible solution.Wait, so there are two possible solutions here? The original square could have been 11,025 cells or 225 cells? But the problem says &quot;the large square&quot; and &quot;the hole&quot;. Hmm. So, in the first case, the original square is 105x105, and the hole is 104x104. But wait, if you cut out a 104x104 hole from a 105x105 square, is that possible? Because the hole is almost as big as the original square. Is there a stipulation that the hole has to be smaller such that it doesn&#39;t touch the edges? Or is the hole allowed to be anywhere? Hmm. The problem doesn&#39;t specify the position of the hole, just that it&#39;s a square with integer number of cells. So, as long as the hole is a square, regardless of its position, as long as the remaining cells are 209.But in reality, if you have a 105x105 square and you cut out a 104x104 square, you can&#39;t really do that without overlapping the edges. Because the hole is only 1 cell smaller on each side. So, the hole would have to be placed in such a way that it&#39;s adjacent to one corner, but then the remaining cells would be a border of 1 cell around the hole. Wait, but 105x105 minus 104x104 is 209, which is the remaining cells.But let me visualize it. Suppose the original square is 105x105. If you remove a 104x104 square from one corner, the remaining part would be a 1-cell border on two sides. Wait, but how does that add up? The area removed would be 104x104, but the remaining area would be 105x105 - 104x104 = (105 - 104)(105 + 104) = 1*209 = 209. So yes, that works. But in reality, removing a 104x104 square from a 105x105 square would leave an L-shaped region with 209 cells. But is that possible? Let me think. The original square is 105x105. If you take a 104x104 square, you can place it such that it&#39;s shifted by 1 cell in both x and y directions. Then, the remaining cells would be the first row and the first column, forming an L-shape. The first row has 105 cells, the first column has 105 cells, but they overlap at the first cell. So total remaining cells would be 105 + 105 - 1 = 109. Wait, that&#39;s not 209. So, something&#39;s wrong here. Wait, maybe my visualization is incorrect.Wait, actually, if you have a 105x105 square and you remove a 104x104 square from one side, not the corner. For example, if you remove a 104x104 square from the bottom, then the remaining part is a 1x105 strip on top. But that would only be 105 cells, which is not 209. So that can&#39;t be. Alternatively, if you remove a square from the center? But how?Wait, perhaps the hole isn&#39;t aligned with the edges. But the problem states that the hole is a square consisting of an integer number of cells, but it doesn&#39;t say it has to be aligned with the grid. However, typically, when we talk about grid squares, we assume axis-aligned. Otherwise, it&#39;s complicated. Because if the hole is rotated, then the number of cells it covers isn&#39;t straightforward. So, maybe the problem assumes that both the original square and the hole are axis-aligned. Then, the hole must be a contiguous square of cells aligned with the grid.In that case, how can removing a 104x104 hole from a 105x105 grid leave 209 cells? Let me think. If the hole is placed in such a way that it&#39;s offset by 1 cell on all sides. Wait, like a 1-cell border around the hole. But the hole is 104x104, so if you have a 105x105 square, if you remove the inner 104x104 square, you are left with the perimeter. The perimeter of a square is 4*(n) - 4, where n is the length. So for 105x105, the perimeter cells would be 4*105 - 4 = 416 cells. But that&#39;s way more than 209. So that&#39;s not matching.Wait, maybe I&#39;m confusing the concepts here. Wait, if you have a 105x105 square, the number of cells is 11,025. If you remove 104x104 = 10,816 cells, then the remaining is 209. But how can you remove 10,816 cells? That&#39;s almost the entire square. So, unless the hole is almost the entire square except for a thin border. But as I thought earlier, if you remove the inner 104x104 square, you&#39;d have a 1-cell thick border. Wait, let me compute that. For a square of size n, the border cells (i.e., the cells on the edge) would be 4n - 4. For n=105, that&#39;s 4*105 -4 = 416, which is way more than 209. So that&#39;s not matching.Wait, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. If we have a 105x105 square and a 104x104 hole, how exactly is the hole positioned? If it&#39;s aligned such that it&#39;s not centered, then maybe... Wait, but in any case, the hole is a square of 104x104. So if the original square is 105x105, the hole has to be placed in such a way that it occupies 104 rows and 104 columns. But how?Wait, perhaps the hole is placed along one edge. For example, if you have a 105x105 square, and you remove a 104x104 square starting from the top-left corner, then the remaining cells would be the last row and the last column. So, the last row has 105 cells, the last column has 105 cells, but they overlap at the last cell (bottom-right corner). So total remaining cells would be 105 + 105 - 1 = 209. Oh! That makes sense. So if you remove a 104x104 square from the top-left corner of a 105x105 square, you&#39;re left with the last row (row 105) and the last column (column 105), which overlap at the cell (105, 105). So the total remaining cells would be 105 + 105 - 1 = 209. Ah, so that works. So that is a valid configuration. So, even though the hole is very large, if placed in the corner, the remaining cells form a sort of &quot;L&quot; shape with 209 cells. So, that&#39;s possible.Similarly, in the other case where the original square is 15x15, and the hole is 4x4. Then, removing a 4x4 square from a 15x15 grid. Let&#39;s see how that works. If you remove a 4x4 square from, say, the top-left corner, the remaining cells would be 15² - 4² = 225 - 16 = 209. So, yes, that&#39;s 209. So in that case, the remaining cells are the entire grid except for a 4x4 square in the corner.But the problem states that &quot;a hole in the shape of a square, also consisting of an integer number of cells, was cut out&quot;. So, as long as the hole is a square with integer sides, regardless of its position. Therefore, both solutions are possible. But the question is asking &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;. So, the answer could be either 225 or 11,025? But the problem says &quot;the large square&quot;. Wait, in the problem statement, it&#39;s written as &quot;In a square of grid paper containing an integer number of cells, a hole in the shape of a square, also consisting of an integer number of cells, was cut out.&quot; So, the hole is a square with integer number of cells, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the size of the hole. Therefore, both solutions are possible?But maybe there&#39;s a constraint that the hole must be smaller than the original square, but not necessarily non-overlapping when placed in a corner. Wait, but even if the hole is 104x104 in a 105x105 square, it&#39;s still a valid hole as long as it&#39;s placed in such a way that the remaining cells are 209. So, both 15x15 and 105x105 are possible. But the problem is phrased as &quot;how many cells did the large square contain if 209 cells remained after the cutout?&quot; So, the answer might be multiple possibilities? But the problem is in the past tense, implying a specific answer. So, maybe I need to check if both solutions are valid, or if there&#39;s a reason to prefer one over the other.Wait, maybe the problem is translated from another language, so &quot;the large square&quot; might refer to the original square, which is larger than the hole. So both original squares (15x15 and 105x105) are larger than their respective holes (4x4 and 104x104). So both are valid. But since the problem is presented in a math competition style, usually, such problems expect all solutions. But the way the problem is phrased is &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, implying a unique answer. So, maybe I missed something.Wait, let&#39;s check if the problem says &quot;the hole&quot; as in a single hole. If you have a 105x105 square with a 104x104 hole, the remaining cells are 209, which is correct. Similarly, 15x15 minus 4x4 is 209. Both are correct. So, the problem might have two solutions. But the problem is translated, perhaps from Russian, since it&#39;s problem 2, which is similar to the style of some Olympiad problems. In some cases, problems might have multiple solutions, but the answer might expect the sum or the number of solutions. But here, the question is asking &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, so maybe both 225 and 11,025 are possible. But in the context of a competition problem, perhaps the answer is the smaller one? But I need to check.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a constraint that the hole has to be at least 1x1. But both holes are 4x4 and 104x104, which are valid. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the minimal original square, but that&#39;s not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that there is a unique solution. Wait, let me check the factorization again.We have 209 = 11 * 19, and also 1 * 209. But since n and m are positive integers, and n &gt; m, both factor pairs are valid. So, both solutions are possible. Therefore, the answer could be either 225 or 11,025. However, in most math problems like this, unless specified, they usually expect all possible solutions. But the problem says &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, which might imply that there is a unique solution. Wait, maybe the problem is in English, and the original problem in Russian might have specific constraints. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the factorization.Wait, 209 is the product of 11 and 19, which are both primes. So, the factor pairs are (1, 209) and (11, 19). Therefore, leading to two possible solutions. So, the answer should be both. But let me check if the problem is from a specific competition where maybe the answer is unique. Wait, in the original problem statement, does it specify that the hole is non-trivial, or something? The problem here is stated as: &quot;In a square of grid paper containing an integer number of cells, a hole in the shape of a square, also consisting of an integer number of cells, was cut out. How many cells did the large square contain if 209 cells remained after the cutout?&quot;There&#39;s no additional information. So, according to the given information, both solutions are valid. Therefore, the answer is that the large square could have contained either 225 or 11,025 cells. But the problem asks &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, in the past tense, implying that there is a specific answer. So, perhaps I need to check again if both are valid.Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed for a specific answer, and I need to check if both solutions are possible in reality. Let&#39;s think about the first case: 15x15 square with a 4x4 hole. That&#39;s feasible. You can cut out a 4x4 hole from a 15x15 grid, leaving 209 cells. Similarly, a 105x105 grid with a 104x104 hole also leaves 209 cells. Both are possible. Therefore, unless there is a constraint in the problem that I missed, both answers should be valid.But in the context of an Olympiad problem, sometimes they expect all possible answers. However, since the user hasn&#39;t specified whether multiple answers are possible, and given that the problem is presented as having a single answer, perhaps there&#39;s something else. Wait, maybe the problem is in the way the hole is cut. If the hole is required to be entirely within the square, not overlapping the edges, then the maximum size of the hole would be (n - 1)x(n - 1). Wait, but even in that case, in the first scenario, the hole is 104x104 in a 105x105 square, which is allowed because it&#39;s (n - 1)x(n - 1). But in the second case, the hole is 4x4 in a 15x15 square, which is also allowed. So, both are entirely within the square. Therefore, both are valid.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be presented as all possible solutions. In some competitions, you might have to list all possible answers. But given that the user is asking for the final answer boxed, perhaps they expect both answers. But since it&#39;s a single answer box, maybe I need to check the problem again.Wait, looking back at the problem: &quot;How many cells did the large square contain if 209 cells remained after the cutout?&quot; So, if there are two possible sizes for the large square, then the answer would be both. However, in typical mathematical problems, unless specified otherwise, they usually expect all possible solutions. But the way the problem is phrased, using &quot;the large square&quot;, might imply a unique answer, but given that there are two possibilities, perhaps both are acceptable.Alternatively, maybe there is a constraint that the hole must be smaller than the original square by at least some amount. But since both holes are smaller, 4x4 and 104x104, both are smaller than their respective original squares.Wait, unless in the case of 105x105 and 104x104, the hole is only 1 cell less on each side. But in grid terms, that&#39;s still a valid hole. For example, if you have a 2x2 square, you can have a 1x1 hole, leaving 3 cells. Similarly, here, a 105x105 square can have a 104x104 hole, leaving 209 cells.So, given that both solutions are mathematically valid, and there&#39;s no additional constraint in the problem, I think the correct answer is that there are two possible solutions: 225 and 11,025. However, in the context of a problem that might expect a single answer, maybe I need to reconsider.Wait, maybe in the problem statement, the square is a &quot;square of grid paper&quot;, which is then cut with a square hole. If the original square is grid paper, perhaps it&#39;s a single sheet, so the hole can&#39;t be larger than the sheet. But both cases are with the hole smaller than the original. So, both are acceptable.Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that you have to consider that the minimal square is 15x15, so that&#39;s the answer. But unless the problem specifies that it&#39;s the minimal possible, which it doesn&#39;t, both are acceptable.Given that the problem is presented in a way that expects a single answer (with a box around it), but in reality, there are two solutions, perhaps the user expects both. However, since the user interface here is a single answer box, maybe I need to check if there&#39;s a standard answer.Wait, looking up similar problems: the equation n² - m² = (n - m)(n + m) = 209, where 209 factors into 11*19 and 1*209. So, the possible n are (11 + 19)/2 = 15 and (1 + 209)/2 = 105. Therefore, the original squares are 15²=225 and 105²=11025. Hence, two possible answers.But if the problem is from a competition, sometimes they might consider only the non-trivial solution. For example, the 105x105 with a 104x104 hole is kind of a trivial solution where the hole is almost the entire square. But in mathematical terms, it&#39;s still a valid solution. So, depending on the problem&#39;s context, both could be acceptable.Given that the problem says &quot;a hole in the shape of a square&quot;, without any restrictions, both solutions are valid. Therefore, the answer is that the large square contained either 225 or 11,025 cells. But since the problem asks &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, and both are possible, the answer should include both.But I need to check if the problem is from a specific source, perhaps expecting a unique answer. Since the user hasn&#39;t provided additional context, I must assume that both solutions are valid. However, in some cases, problems might consider only factors where both (n - m) and (n + m) are of the same parity, because n and m must be integers. Let&#39;s check that.In the first case: (n - m) = 1, (n + m) = 209. Adding them: 2n = 210 =&gt; n = 105, which is integer. Subtracting them: 2m = 208 =&gt; m = 104. Both integers.Second case: (n - m) = 11, (n + m) = 19. Adding them: 2n = 30 =&gt; n = 15. Subtracting them: 2m = 8 =&gt; m = 4. Both integers. So both solutions are valid. Therefore, the problem has two solutions.But the problem is presented in a way that might expect a single numerical answer. Maybe in the original problem, the answer is 225, considering that 105x105 is too large, but without more context, it&#39;s hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed for the smaller solution. But in the absence of additional constraints, both are correct.However, given that the problem is problem 2, perhaps from an Olympiad, and Olympiad problems often have a unique answer, maybe there&#39;s something I missed. Let me check the factorization again. 209 = 11 * 19. Both primes. So, the only factor pairs are (1, 209) and (11, 19). Therefore, two solutions.Alternatively, maybe the problem requires the largest possible original square. But that&#39;s 105x105. However, the problem asks &quot;how many cells did the large square contain&quot;, not the largest possible. So, both are large squares, just different sizes. Therefore, both are correct.Given that, perhaps the answer should be both 225 and 11,025. But since the answer needs to be in a box, maybe they expect both answers separated by a comma. However, in standard math competitions, sometimes problems accept multiple answers, but the user here might expect the possible answers. But since the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually expects a single answer.Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the hole is at least 1x1, which both are, and there&#39;s no further restriction, so both answers are possible. However, if the problem is intended for a specific level, say middle school, maybe 15x15 is the expected answer, as 105x105 is quite large. But without knowing the context, it&#39;s hard to tell.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s an error in considering the cases. Let me re-examine the equations.We have (n - m)(n + m) = 209.209 factors into 1 * 209 and 11 * 19. Therefore, the two possibilities are:1) n - m = 1, n + m = 209. Solving gives n = (1 + 209)/2 = 105, m = 209 - 105 = 104.2) n - m = 11, n + m = 19. Solving gives n = (11 + 19)/2 = 15, m = 19 - 15 = 4.Therefore, the original square can be 105x105 or 15x15. Both are valid.But since the problem says &quot;the large square&quot;, maybe implying the larger one, but both are large depending on perspective. Alternatively, it&#39;s called &quot;the large square&quot; to differentiate from the hole, which is also a square, but smaller. So both original squares are large compared to their respective holes. Therefore, both are acceptable.But since the user expects one answer, and the problem may have multiple, perhaps the answer is both. However, in Chinese or Russian problems, sometimes they write &quot;the number of cells&quot; as a single answer, but if there are multiple solutions, you need to state both.But given the format here, with boxed{}, which is typically for a single answer, I&#39;m conflicted. However, given that in mathematical problems, especially Olympiad style, if multiple solutions exist, they should all be mentioned. So, maybe the answer is two possible numbers: 225 and 11025. But how to present them in a box? Maybe boxed{225} and boxed{11025}. But the user might expect both. Alternatively, if only one is expected, maybe 225.Wait, let me check with the calculation. If we assume that the original square is 15x15=225, and the hole is 4x4=16, then 225 - 16 = 209. That works. If the original square is 105x105=11025, hole is 104x104=10816, 11025 - 10816 = 209. That also works. So both are correct.Therefore, the answer is both 225 and 11,025. Since the problem is in English and presented without specific constraints, I think both answers are valid. However, given that the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually is for a single answer, but maybe here we need to write both boxed numbers.But in standard practice, if there are multiple solutions, they should be both stated. However, in the context of the problem being maybe translated, perhaps the intended answer is 225. But without more context, it&#39;s hard to be certain.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer to be expressed as the two possible numbers. In some cases, answers are written separated by commas in the box. For example, boxed{225} and boxed{11025}. But I need to check if that&#39;s acceptable.Given the ambiguity, but since both solutions are mathematically valid, I will present both answers.Final AnswerThe large square could have contained either boxed{225} or boxed{11025} cells.&lt;/think&gt;Given a square of grid paper with an integer number of cells, a square hole with an integer number of cells was cut out, leaving 209 cells. We need to determine how many cells the original large square contained.We start with the equation ( n^2 - m^2 = 209 ), where ( n ) is the side length of the large square and ( m ) is the side length of the hole. This equation can be factored as ( (n - m)(n + m) = 209 ).The prime factorization of 209 is ( 11 times 19 ). We consider the factor pairs of 209:1. ( (1, 209) )2. ( (11, 19) )For each factor pair, we solve for ( n ) and ( m ):1. Factor pair (1, 209):   [   begin{cases}   n - m = 1    n + m = 209   end{cases}   ]   Adding these equations: ( 2n = 210 Rightarrow n = 105 ).   Subtracting the first from the second: ( 2m = 208 Rightarrow m = 104 ).   The original large square has ( 105^2 = 11025 ) cells.2. Factor pair (11, 19):   [   begin{cases}   n - m = 11    n + m = 19   end{cases}   ]   Adding these equations: ( 2n = 30 Rightarrow n = 15 ).   Subtracting the first from the second: ( 2m = 8 Rightarrow m = 4 ).   The original large square has ( 15^2 = 225 ) cells.Both solutions are valid as they satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the original large square could have contained either (boxed{225}) or (boxed{11025}) cells.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b2c58cb1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b2c58cb1><span class="icon" data-v-b2c58cb1>🔑:</span>Answer: 225 cellsSolution.

So, there are three natural numbers, right? Let&#39;s call them a, b, and c. The problem says that the product of the first and second is 24, so that means a * b = 24. Then, the product of the second and third is 32, so b * c = 32. Finally, the product of the first and third is 48, so a * c = 48. Hmm, okay. So, we have three equations here:1. a * b = 242. b * c = 323. a * c = 48I need to find natural numbers a, b, c that satisfy all three equations. Let&#39;s think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of another using one equation and substitute into the others. Let&#39;s start with the first equation: a * b = 24. So, if I solve for a, I get a = 24 / b. Then, maybe substitute this into the third equation, which is a * c = 48. Substituting a gives (24 / b) * c = 48. Let&#39;s write that out:(24 / b) * c = 48Multiply both sides by b to get rid of the denominator:24 * c = 48 * bDivide both sides by 24:c = (48 / 24) * bSimplify:c = 2 * bOkay, so c is twice b. That&#39;s helpful. Now, let&#39;s look at the second equation: b * c = 32. But since we know c = 2b, substitute that in:b * (2b) = 32Which simplifies to:2b² = 32Divide both sides by 2:b² = 16Take the square root:b = 4 or b = -4But since the numbers are natural numbers, b has to be positive. So, b = 4.Now that we have b = 4, we can find a from the first equation:a = 24 / b = 24 / 4 = 6So, a = 6.And then c is twice b, so c = 2 * 4 = 8.Let&#39;s check if these values satisfy all three equations:1. a * b = 6 * 4 = 24 ✔️2. b * c = 4 * 8 = 32 ✔️3. a * c = 6 * 8 = 48 ✔️Looks like they all check out. So the numbers are 6, 4, and 8. Let me just make sure there are no other possible solutions. Since we derived b from the equation and found it to be 4, which is the only positive square root, and the rest of the variables are dependent on b, there shouldn&#39;t be any other natural number solutions. Another way to approach this could be to multiply all three equations together. Let&#39;s try that:(a * b) * (b * c) * (a * c) = 24 * 32 * 48Left side is a² * b² * c². So:(a * b * c)² = 24 * 32 * 48Calculate the right side:24 * 32 = 768768 * 48. Let&#39;s compute that:768 * 48 = (700 * 48) + (68 * 48)700 * 48 = 33,60068 * 48 = 3,264Adding them together: 33,600 + 3,264 = 36,864So, (a * b * c)² = 36,864Taking the square root:a * b * c = √36,864Let me compute that. 36,864 divided by 64 is 576. So √36,864 = √(64 * 576) = 8 * 24 = 192So, a * b * c = 192But we already found a = 6, b = 4, c = 8. Let&#39;s check: 6 * 4 * 8 = 192 ✔️So that confirms it. Alternatively, if we didn&#39;t already have the values, we could use this product to find each variable. For example, since a * b * c = 192, and we have a * b = 24, then c = 192 / 24 = 8. Similarly, b * c = 32, so a = 192 / 32 = 6. And a * c = 48, so b = 192 / 48 = 4. Yep, same results. So this cross-check also works.Therefore, the numbers must be 6, 4, and 8. There&#39;s no ambiguity here because all steps led to unique natural numbers, and no other factors would satisfy all three product conditions simultaneously. For instance, if we tried different factors for a * b = 24, like a = 3, b = 8, then c would be 32 / 8 = 4, but then a * c = 3 * 4 = 12, which is not 48. Similarly, a = 12, b = 2 would lead to c = 16, but a * c = 12 * 16 = 192, which is way off. So indeed, only 6, 4, 8 work.Final AnswerThe three numbers are boxed{6}, boxed{4}, and boxed{8}.&lt;/think&gt;Let the three natural numbers be (a), (b), and (c). We are given the following equations:1. (a cdot b = 24)2. (b cdot c = 32)3. (a cdot c = 48)First, solve for (a) from the first equation: (a = frac{24}{b}). Substitute this into the third equation:[left(frac{24}{b}right) cdot c = 48]Multiply both sides by (b):[24 cdot c = 48 cdot b]Divide both sides by 24:[c = 2b]Substitute (c = 2b) into the second equation:[b cdot (2b) = 32]Simplify:[2b^2 = 32]Divide by 2:[b^2 = 16]Take the square root:[b = 4 quad (text{since } b text{ is a natural number})]Now, substitute (b = 4) back into the first equation to find (a):[a = frac{24}{4} = 6]And substitute (b = 4) into (c = 2b) to find (c):[c = 2 cdot 4 = 8]Verify the solutions with all three equations:1. (6 cdot 4 = 24)2. (4 cdot 8 = 32)3. (6 cdot 8 = 48)All equations are satisfied. Therefore, the three numbers are (boxed{6}), (boxed{4}), and (boxed{8}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out these three numbers. The problem says that the product of the first and second is 24, the product of the second and third is 32, and the product of the first and third is 48. Hmm, so we have three equations here with three variables. Let&#39;s denote the three numbers as a, b, and c. So:1. a * b = 242. b * c = 323. a * c = 48I need to find natural numbers a, b, and c that satisfy all three equations. Since they&#39;re natural numbers, they have to be positive integers. Let me see how to approach this.One way is to express each variable in terms of another and substitute. For example, from the first equation, a = 24 / b. From the second equation, c = 32 / b. Then, substitute these into the third equation: (24 / b) * (32 / b) = 48. Let&#39;s check that.So, (24 * 32) / (b^2) = 48. Calculating 24*32, which is 768. So 768 / b² = 48. Then, multiplying both sides by b² gives 768 = 48b². Then, divide both sides by 48: 768 / 48 = b². Let me calculate that: 768 ÷ 48. 48*16 is 768, right? Because 48*10=480, 48*6=288; 480+288=768. So 16 = b². Therefore, b = 4, since it&#39;s a natural number.Then, substitute back into the first equation: a = 24 / b = 24 / 4 = 6. Then, c = 32 / b = 32 / 4 = 8. Let me verify with the third equation: a*c = 6*8 = 48. Yes, that works. So the numbers are 6, 4, and 8.Wait, let me check again. a=6, b=4, c=8.First product: 6*4=24 ✔️Second product: 4*8=32 ✔️Third product: 6*8=48 ✔️All check out. But let me see if there could be another solution. Since when solving for b²=16, b could be -4 as well, but since we are dealing with natural numbers, negatives are excluded. So 4 is the only possible value for b. Then a and c are uniquely determined. So the only solution is 6, 4, 8.Alternatively, another approach could be to multiply all three equations together. Let&#39;s see:(a*b)*(b*c)*(a*c) = 24*32*48Left side: a²*b²*c² = (a*b*c)^2Right side: 24*32*48. Let&#39;s compute that. 24*32 is 768, and 768*48. Let&#39;s compute 768*40=30,720 and 768*8=6,144. So total is 30,720 + 6,144 = 36,864. Therefore, (a*b*c)^2 = 36,864. Taking square roots, a*b*c = √36,864. Let&#39;s compute that. √36,864. Since 180²=32,400 and 190²=36,100, 192²=36,864. Because 192*192: 200*200=40,000, subtract 8*200 + 8*200 - 8*8= 40,000 - 1,600 -1,600 +64= 40,000 - 3,200 +64= 36,864. So √36,864=192. Therefore, a*b*c=192.Now, since a*b*c=192, and we know a*b=24, then c=192 / 24=8. Similarly, from b*c=32, then a=192 /32=6. From a*c=48, then b=192 /48=4. So same results. So c=8, a=6, b=4. Therefore, numbers are 6,4,8.Alternatively, maybe factor each product into prime factors and see the common factors.First product: 24. Prime factors: 2^3 * 3.Second product: 32. Prime factors: 2^5.Third product: 48. Prime factors: 2^4 * 3.Let’s denote the numbers a, b, c with their prime factors. Let’s assume they are all composed of 2 and 3, since the products are.Let a = 2^x * 3^yb = 2^m * 3^nc = 2^p * 3^qThen, from a*b=24=2^3*3^1, so exponents for 2: x + m =3, exponents for 3: y + n=1.From b*c=32=2^5, so exponents for 2: m + p=5, exponents for 3: n + q=0. Since n and q are non-negative integers, n=0 and q=0.From a*c=48=2^4*3^1, exponents for 2: x + p=4, exponents for 3: y + q=1. But we already found q=0, so y=1.So summarizing:From b*c: n=0, q=0. So b has 3^n=3^0=1, so b is a power of 2. Similarly, c is a power of 2 since q=0. However, a has y=1, so a includes a 3^1.From a*b=24: a has 3^1, and since b has n=0 (no 3s), so the 3 in a is the only one in the product a*b=24. Therefore, a must have exactly one 3, and b has none.Similarly, for the exponents of 2:From a*b=24: x + m =3.From b*c=32: m + p=5.From a*c=48: x + p=4.We have three equations:1. x + m =32. m + p =53. x + p =4Let’s solve these equations.From equation 1: x =3 -m.From equation 2: p=5 -m.Plug into equation 3: (3 -m) + (5 -m)=4 → 8 -2m=4 → -2m= -4 → m=2.Then x=3 -2=1, p=5 -2=3.Therefore, exponents of 2 in a, b, c are 1,2,3 respectively.Therefore, a=2^1 *3^1=2*3=6.b=2^2=4.c=2^3=8.Same answer as before. So all methods converge to a=6, b=4, c=8.So the three numbers are 6, 4, 8.Final AnswerThe three natural numbers are boxed{6}, boxed{4}, and boxed{8}.&lt;/think&gt;Given three natural numbers (a), (b), and (c) such that:1. (a times b = 24)2. (b times c = 32)3. (a times c = 48)We start by expressing (a) and (c) in terms of (b):From the first equation: (a = frac{24}{b})From the second equation: (c = frac{32}{b})Substituting these into the third equation:[left(frac{24}{b}right) times left(frac{32}{b}right) = 48]Simplifying this, we get:[frac{768}{b^2} = 48]Solving for (b^2):[b^2 = frac{768}{48} = 16 implies b = 4]Substituting (b = 4) back into the expressions for (a) and (c):[a = frac{24}{4} = 6][c = frac{32}{4} = 8]Verifying the third equation:[a times c = 6 times 8 = 48]All equations are satisfied. Therefore, the three natural numbers are (boxed{6}), (boxed{4}), and (boxed{8}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b2c58cb1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b2c58cb1><span class="icon" data-v-b2c58cb1>🔑:</span>The product of 48 of the first and third number is twice the product of 24 of the first and second number.

On the table, there are 100 weights of different masses. A weight is called successful if its mass is equal to the sum of the masses of some two other weights on the table. What is the smallest number of successful weights that would allow us to assert with certainty that the masses of some two weights differ by at least a factor of three?</div><div class="divider" data-v-b2c58cb1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b2c58cb1><span class="icon" data-v-b2c58cb1>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so there&#39;s this problem about 100 weights with different masses. A weight is called &quot;successful&quot; if its mass equals the sum of two other weights. We need to find the smallest number of successful weights that guarantees that at least two weights differ by a factor of three. Hmm, let&#39;s unpack this step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have 100 distinct weights. A successful weight is one that can be expressed as the sum of two others. The question is, what&#39;s the minimum number of successful weights needed so that we can be certain there are at least two weights where one is at least three times the other. Got it.So, the key here is to find the smallest number of successful weights that forces such a pair. The challenge is figuring out how to arrange the weights in such a way that as many as possible are successful without having any two weights differing by a factor of three. Then, the smallest number that makes this impossible would be our answer.Let me think. If we want to avoid having two weights differing by a factor of three, we need all weights to be such that each subsequent weight is less than three times the previous one. So, maybe arranging the weights in increasing order and ensuring that each weight is less than three times the previous one. If we can do that, then no two weights would differ by a factor of three or more. However, if the number of successful weights is too large, such an arrangement becomes impossible, thus guaranteeing that two weights must differ by at least a factor of three.So, our strategy is to construct a set of weights where each weight is less than three times the previous one, and as many weights as possible are successful. The maximum number of successful weights in such a set would be the threshold. Once we exceed that number, we can&#39;t have all weights in such a sequence, so there must be two weights differing by a factor of three.To formalize this, let&#39;s denote the weights in increasing order: w₁, w₂, ..., w₁₀₀. To prevent any two weights from differing by a factor of three, we need w_{i+1} &lt; 3w_i for all i. If this condition holds for all consecutive weights, then for any i &lt; j, w_j &lt; 3^{j-i} w_i. Since 3^{j-i} grows exponentially, but we need to ensure that even for non-consecutive weights, the ratio is less than three. Wait, no, actually, if each consecutive pair is less than three times the previous, then the maximum ratio between any two weights is 3^{99}, but that&#39;s way larger than three. So actually, maybe my initial thought is wrong.Wait, no. If we have each weight less than three times the previous one, then the ratio between any two weights w_j and w_i where j &gt; i is w_j / w_i &lt; 3^{j - i}. But we want to prevent any pair from having a ratio of three or more. Therefore, even for non-consecutive pairs, we need that w_j / w_i &lt; 3. So, actually, this approach might not work because even if each consecutive pair is less than three, the ratio between non-consecutive pairs could still exceed three. For example, if w_{i+1} &lt; 3w_i, then w_{i+2} &lt; 3w_{i+1} &lt; 9w_i, which is more than three times w_i. So this approach would allow ratios up to 3^{n} between weights n apart, which is not acceptable.So, maybe another approach. Instead of ensuring each consecutive weight is less than three times the previous, perhaps arrange the weights such that every weight is at least a third of the next one. Wait, but that would mean each weight is at least (1/3) of the next, so the next is at most three times the previous. But that&#39;s similar to before, but in the reverse direction. Hmm, maybe this is not the way.Alternatively, maybe group the weights into different &quot;chains&quot; where within each chain, each weight is less than three times the previous. Then, the number of chains needed would relate to the total number of weights. But I&#39;m not sure how this connects to the successful weights.Alternatively, think of the weights in terms of their representations in base 3. If we can represent each weight as a power of 3, maybe we can avoid having any two weights differing by a factor of three. But this might not be directly applicable.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. If we have a set of numbers where no two numbers differ by a factor of three or more, then all numbers lie in an interval [a, 3a) for some a. But since there are 100 numbers, they can&#39;t all lie in such an interval unless they are arranged in multiple such intervals. Wait, actually, to cover 100 numbers without any two differing by a factor of three, we need to arrange them in overlapping intervals where each subsequent number is less than three times the previous. But this is getting a bit vague.Alternatively, consider that if we have a set S of numbers where every number is at least three times the previous one, then the maximum number of elements in S would be log base 3 of the ratio of the maximum to minimum element. However, we don&#39;t know the maximum or minimum here.Wait, maybe we need to use the pigeonhole principle. If we divide the weights into &quot;bins&quot; where each bin corresponds to a range of masses such that each bin is a factor of three apart. For example, bin 1: [1, 3), bin 2: [3, 9), bin 3: [9, 27), etc. Then, any two weights in the same bin are within a factor of three of each other. If two weights are in different bins, their ratio is at least three. Therefore, to avoid having two weights differing by a factor of three, all weights must be in the same bin. But since our weights are distinct, we can&#39;t have 100 distinct weights in [1,3) because the next weight would have to be at least 1 + ε, but with 100 distinct weights, the maximum would be approaching 3. Wait, but this is possible if the weights are spaced very closely. For example, 1, 1.01, 1.02, ..., up to nearly 3. But in reality, they can be any distinct real numbers. However, the problem is that if all weights are within [a, 3a), then any two weights cannot differ by a factor of three. So, if all 100 weights are in such an interval, then the answer is that you need zero successful weights, which contradicts. Wait, but the problem says &quot;the smallest number of successful weights that would allow us to assert with certainty that the masses of some two weights differ by at least a factor of three.&quot; So, if even with zero successful weights, we can&#39;t assert that, because it&#39;s possible all weights are in [a,3a). Then, the answer is more than zero.Wait, but the problem is about the minimal number of successful weights such that no matter how the weights are arranged (with that number of successful ones), there must exist two weights differing by a factor of three. So, we need to find the smallest k such that any configuration with at least k successful weights must have two weights differing by a factor of three.Therefore, to find the minimal k where it&#39;s impossible to have a set of 100 weights with k successful weights and all pairs differing by less than three.So, our approach is: construct a set of 100 weights with as many successful weights as possible, while keeping all weights within a factor of three of each other. The maximum such number of successful weights plus one would be the minimal k needed.Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of successful weights possible in a set of 100 distinct weights where all weights are in [a, 3a) for some a. Then, the answer is that maximum plus one.So, how can we maximize the number of successful weights in such a set?First, note that a successful weight is the sum of two others. In order to maximize the number of such weights, we need as many weights as possible to be expressible as the sum of two smaller weights.But since all weights are less than 3a, and greater than or equal to a, the smallest possible weight is a, the next one must be at least a + ε, and so on. However, the largest weight is less than 3a.But if all weights are in [a, 3a), then the sum of any two weights is in [2a, 6a). However, since the maximum weight in the set is less than 3a, only the sums in [2a, 3a) can be successful weights. Because sums above 3a would not be present in the set.Therefore, the successful weights must lie in [2a, 3a). Each successful weight is the sum of two smaller weights, which are in [a, 3a). So, for a weight w in [2a, 3a), there must exist two weights x and y such that x + y = w, with x, y &lt; w.But since x and y are in [a, 3a), and w is at least 2a, so x and y must be at least a, and their sum is at least 2a. So, possible.Therefore, to maximize the number of successful weights, we need as many weights as possible in [2a, 3a), each of which is the sum of two smaller weights in [a, 3a).But we need to structure the set such that all weights are in [a, 3a), all are distinct, and as many as possible in [2a, 3a) are sums of two smaller weights.So, the minimal weight is a. Let&#39;s set a = 1 for simplicity, so all weights are in [1, 3). Then, the successful weights are those in [2, 3). Each of these must be the sum of two smaller weights in [1, 3).But how many such weights can we have?Suppose we have a set S where S contains numbers in [1, 2) and [2, 3). The numbers in [2, 3) must be sums of two numbers from [1, 2). Let&#39;s denote the lower part as L = [1, 2) and the upper part U = [2, 3). Then, each element in U must be the sum of two elements from L ∪ U. But since elements in U are already in [2, 3), adding any two elements from U would give a sum of at least 4, which is outside our set. Therefore, elements in U must be sums of two elements from L.But elements in L are in [1, 2), so their sum is in [2, 4). But since our set only goes up to 3, the sums that fall into [2, 3) can be included in U.Therefore, each element in U is a sum of two elements from L. So, the number of elements in U is limited by the number of distinct sums that can be formed by pairs of elements in L.To maximize the size of U, we need to maximize the number of distinct sums generated by pairs in L. So, how can we choose elements in L such that their pairwise sums are all distinct and lie in [2, 3)?This is similar to a problem in additive combinatorics where we want a set with many distinct sums. The classic result is that if you have a set of n real numbers, the number of distinct sums is at least n(n-1)/2 + 1, but that&#39;s for integers. For real numbers, the number of distinct sums can be as high as n(n+1)/2, but since we are restricted to sums in [2, 3), we need to arrange L such that as many of these sums as possible fall into [2, 3).Alternatively, if L is a set of numbers such that all pairs sum to distinct values in [2, 3), then the maximum size of U is C(|L|, 2). Therefore, to maximize |U|, we need to maximize C(|L|, 2), given that |L| + |U| = 100.So, let’s denote |L| = m, then |U| = 100 - m. We need 100 - m ≤ m(m - 1)/2. Solving for m:m(m - 1)/2 ≥ 100 - mMultiply both sides by 2:m(m - 1) ≥ 200 - 2mm² - m + 2m - 200 ≥ 0m² + m - 200 ≥ 0Solving the quadratic equation m² + m - 200 = 0:Discriminant D = 1 + 800 = 801m = [-1 ± sqrt(801)] / 2sqrt(801) ≈ 28.3, so m ≈ (-1 + 28.3)/2 ≈ 13.65So, m must be at least 14. Therefore, when m = 14, the left side is 14*13/2 = 91, and 100 - 14 = 86. But 91 ≥ 86, which holds. So, if we have |L| = 14, then |U| = 86, and the number of possible sums is 91, which is more than 86. Therefore, in theory, we can have 86 elements in U, each being a unique sum of two elements from L.But wait, in reality, can we have 14 elements in L such that all their pairwise sums are unique and lie in [2, 3)? That requires careful construction. For real numbers, if we choose elements in L such that all pairwise sums are distinct, which is possible by selecting elements with sufficient spacing. For example, choosing elements in L as 1 + ε_i where ε_i are sufficiently small and distinct such that all sums 2 + ε_i + ε_j are distinct and less than 3. This seems feasible.Therefore, in this case, with |L| = 14, we can have |U| = 86. So, the total number of successful weights would be 86, since all weights in U are successful. However, we need to check if the elements in L can be such that none of them are sums of two other weights. Since all elements in L are less than 2, and the sums of two weights are at least 2 (since each weight is at least 1), so elements in L cannot be expressed as the sum of two other weights. Therefore, in this construction, the successful weights are exactly those in U, so 86 successful weights.Therefore, if we can have a set with 86 successful weights where all weights are within a factor of three (since the maximum is less than 3 and the minimum is 1), then the maximum number of successful weights without having two weights differing by a factor of three is 86. Hence, the minimal number required to guarantee that such a pair exists would be 87.But wait, hold on. Let me verify this again. If we have |L| = 14 and |U| = 86, then total weights are 100. All weights in U are successful because they&#39;re sums of two from L. The weights in L are not successful because you can&#39;t express them as the sum of two smaller weights (since all weights are at least 1, and L is in [1, 2), so the sum of two would be at least 2). Therefore, the number of successful weights is 86.Therefore, if such a construction is possible, then 86 successful weights can exist without any two weights differing by a factor of three. Therefore, the minimal number needed to force a pair with a factor of three difference is 87. So, the answer would be 87.But wait, the problem states &quot;the smallest number of successful weights that would allow us to assert with certainty that the masses of some two weights differ by at least a factor of three.&quot; So, if 86 is possible without such a pair, then 87 is the minimal number where it&#39;s impossible, hence the answer is 87.But let me check if this is correct. Let&#39;s think again. The key idea is that if we can partition the 100 weights into a lower set L and an upper set U, where U is entirely made up of sums of two elements from L, then all elements in U are successful, and if L is small enough such that the number of possible sums is large enough to accommodate U. The calculation we did suggests that with |L|=14, |U|=86 is possible. Therefore, the maximum number of successful weights without a factor of three difference is 86. Therefore, 87 is the minimal number that forces a factor of three difference.However, there might be a mistake here. Let&#39;s see. The assumption is that with |L|=14, we can have 86 elements in U, each being a unique sum of two elements from L. But the number of unique sums possible from 14 elements is C(14, 2) = 91. Therefore, we can have up to 91 elements in U, but we only need 86. So, this is feasible. Therefore, 86 successful weights can exist without any two weights differing by a factor of three.Therefore, the answer is 87.But let me check if there&#39;s a different approach that gives a different answer. For example, maybe considering sequences where each weight is just under three times the previous one, but then considering which weights can be expressed as sums.Alternatively, think recursively: if you have a set where each weight is less than three times the previous, then the number of successful weights is limited because the sums would eventually exceed the next weight. But this might not directly apply.Alternatively, consider that if all weights are within a factor of three, then the entire set is contained in an interval [a, 3a). Then, the number of successful weights is the number of weights in [2a, 3a), since those can be formed by the sum of two weights in [a, 2a). The number of weights in [a, 2a) would need to be sufficient to generate all the weights in [2a, 3a) via their sums. So, similar to the earlier approach.Thus, the key is that the number of weights in the upper half [2a, 3a) is limited by the number of pairs in the lower half [a, 2a). If we denote m as the number in the lower half, then the upper half can have up to m(m - 1)/2. So, m(m - 1)/2 + m = total number of weights. Wait, but total is 100. Wait, no: m is the size of the lower half, and the upper half is up to m(m - 1)/2. Therefore, m + m(m - 1)/2 ≥ 100. Wait, but in our previous calculation, we set |U| = 100 - m, so 100 - m ≤ m(m - 1)/2. So, this is the same as before. Therefore, solving 100 - m ≤ m(m - 1)/2 gives m ≥ 14. So, the maximum |U| is 100 - 14 = 86.Therefore, this suggests that 86 is possible. Therefore, 87 is the minimal number to guarantee the existence of two weights differing by threefold.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{87}.Final Answerboxed{87}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the smallest number of successful weights that guarantees at least two weights differ by a factor of three, we consider the following reasoning:1. Understanding Successful Weights: A weight is successful if it is the sum of two other weights. We need to find the minimum number of successful weights such that it is impossible to avoid having two weights with a ratio of at least three.2. Constructing the Set: We need to construct a set of 100 weights where each weight is less than three times the previous one. This ensures no two weights differ by a factor of three. The key is to maximize the number of successful weights in such a set.3. Partitioning the Weights: We divide the weights into two intervals: the lower interval ([a, 2a)) and the upper interval ([2a, 3a)). Weights in the upper interval must be sums of two weights from the lower interval.4. Maximizing Successful Weights: Let (m) be the number of weights in the lower interval ([a, 2a)). The number of possible sums (successful weights) in the upper interval ([2a, 3a)) is given by (binom{m}{2}). We need to solve for (m) such that the total number of weights is 100.5. Solving the Equation: We set up the equation (m + binom{m}{2} geq 100). Solving this quadratic equation, we find (m geq 14). This means the lower interval can have 14 weights, and the upper interval can have (100 - 14 = 86) weights.6. Conclusion: With 14 weights in the lower interval, we can have 86 successful weights in the upper interval. Therefore, the smallest number of successful weights that guarantees a factor of three difference is 87.[boxed{87}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have 100 weights, all with different masses. A weight is called &quot;successful&quot; if its mass is equal to the sum of two other weights. The question is asking: What&#39;s the smallest number of successful weights needed so that we can be sure that there are at least two weights whose masses differ by a factor of three or more?Hmm. So, we need to find the minimal number of successful weights such that no matter how the weights are arranged, having that many successful ones forces there to be two weights with a ratio of at least 3:1. Got it.First, let me rephrase the problem in my own words. We have 100 distinct weights. A successful weight is one that can be expressed as the sum of two others. We need to determine the smallest number of successful weights required to guarantee that among all these weights, there must exist two weights where one is at least three times the other.So, the key here is to figure out the threshold number of successful weights beyond which it&#39;s impossible to avoid having a pair differing by a factor of three. If we can find such a number, that&#39;s our answer.I think this problem relates to the pigeonhole principle. If we can divide the weights into groups where within each group, no two weights differ by a factor of three, then the number of such groups would be the maximum number of weights you could have without having such a pair. If the number of successful weights exceeds this maximum, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one group must contain two successful weights, leading to a contradiction. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps we need to construct a scenario where we maximize the number of successful weights without having any two differing by a factor of three. Then, the minimal number needed to guarantee the existence would be one more than that maximum. So, if we can find the maximum number of successful weights possible in a set where no two differ by a factor of three, then adding one more would force there to be a pair with the required ratio.But how do we model the weights and their sums? Since each successful weight is the sum of two others. So, in such a scenario, the weights can be grouped in a way that each weight is either a base weight or a sum of two base weights. However, all weights need to be distinct. Also, we need to prevent any two weights from differing by a factor of three.Wait, maybe we can use a geometric progression here. If we arrange the weights in a geometric progression where each term is just under three times the previous one, then no two weights will differ by a factor of three. But we have to ensure that the sums of any two weights don&#39;t create a new weight that would either exceed the next term in the progression or create a term that&#39;s too large. However, since all weights are distinct, we need to manage the progression such that sums don&#39;t collide or create terms that would require a larger ratio.Alternatively, maybe we can model the weights using powers of 3. If we take weights as 3^k, then the ratio between consecutive weights is 3, but if we use smaller exponents, maybe like 2 or something less than 3. Let me think.Wait, if we set the weights in a geometric progression with a common ratio r, then to prevent any two weights from differing by a factor of three, we need r &lt; 3. But each weight must be the sum of two smaller weights. Hmm, but in a geometric progression, the sum of two smaller terms would be larger than the next term if r &gt;= 2. For example, if we have a progression with ratio 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,... Then, the sum of the two smallest terms (1+2=3) which is not in the progression. So, such a progression wouldn&#39;t work because the sums aren&#39;t part of the sequence. Therefore, to have sums that are part of the sequence, the progression must be such that each term is the sum of two previous terms.Wait, the Fibonacci sequence is a progression where each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but the ratio there approaches the golden ratio, which is about 1.618. So, maybe a Fibonacci-like sequence could be used here. However, in our case, the ratio between terms is less than 3, but even the Fibonacci sequence&#39;s ratio is about 1.618, which is less than 3. However, the problem is that the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, but the ratio between consecutive terms approaches a constant. So, if we have a sequence where each term is the sum of two previous terms, then the ratio between consecutive terms approaches a constant, which is less than 2. So, maybe such a sequence can be constructed where the ratio is less than 3, and all terms are sums of two previous terms.But in our problem, the weights are arbitrary, except that they need to be distinct. So, perhaps the idea is to create a set of weights where each weight is the sum of two smaller weights, but arranged in such a way that the ratio between any two weights is less than 3. Then, the maximum number of such weights would be the maximum possible without having a pair differing by a factor of three, and the minimal number needed to guarantee such a pair would be one more than that.Alternatively, maybe we can structure the weights in a way that each weight is less than three times the previous one, and also can be expressed as the sum of two smaller weights. If we can find the maximum number of such weights, that would be the maximum number of successful weights without having a pair differing by three. Then, the answer would be that maximum plus one.So, to model this, perhaps we can consider building a set S of weights where each weight is the sum of two smaller weights in S, and each weight is less than three times the previous one. Let&#39;s try to build such a set incrementally.Start with the smallest weight. Let&#39;s say the smallest weight is 1. Then the next weight must be greater than 1 but less than 3*1=3. Let&#39;s choose 2. Now, 2 is the second weight. Now, the third weight must be greater than 2 but less than 3*2=6. But also, the third weight should be the sum of two previous weights. The sum of 1 and 2 is 3. So, we can have 3. Then, the fourth weight must be greater than 3 but less than 3*3=9. The sum of existing weights: 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 2+3=5. So, the next weight can be 4, 5, or something up to 8. Let&#39;s pick the smallest possible, which is 4. Then, 4 is the sum of 1 and 3. Now, the fifth weight must be greater than 4 but less than 3*4=12. The possible sums are 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 1+5=6, etc. Wait, but 5 hasn&#39;t been included yet. Wait, our existing weights are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, possible sums:1+2=3 (exists), 1+3=4 (exists), 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+4=7. So, the next weight can be 5, 6, 7, or up to 11. Let&#39;s choose 5. Then, 5 is the sum of 1 and 4. Then, next weight must be greater than 5, less than 15. Possible sums: 1+5=6, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 3+4=7, 3+5=8, 4+5=9, etc. Choose 6. Then 6 is the sum of 2 and 4. Next weight: must be greater than 6, less than 18. Sums: 1+6=7, 2+5=7, 3+4=7, etc. Choose 7. Then 7 is the sum of 3 and 4. Next weight: 8, which is 3+5. Wait, 5 is there. 3+5=8. So, 8. Then next weight up to 24. Wait, but 3*7=21, so next weight must be less than 21. 8 is next. Then 9, which is 4+5. Then 10, which is 1+9, but 9 is there. Wait, but 1+9=10, but 9 is in the set. Wait, no, to get 10, we need two previous weights. 2+8=10, 3+7=10, 4+6=10, 5+5=10 (but duplicates not allowed). So, 10 can be formed. So, 10 is next. Then 11, which can be 1+10, 2+9, etc. Hmm.Wait, but this process seems to generate a set where each new weight is the sum of two previous ones and each weight is less than three times the previous one. However, as we go further, the ratios between consecutive terms might approach 2, since each term is roughly the sum of the two previous terms. For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, each term is the sum of the two previous, which leads to a ratio approaching approximately 1.618. But here, since we have more flexibility (we can choose the next term as any sum, not strictly the sum of the last two), maybe the ratio can be controlled to stay under 3.But the problem is that we need 100 weights. If we can keep constructing such a set where each weight is less than three times the previous one, and each weight is a sum of two previous weights, then we can have 100 weights without any two differing by a factor of three. But that&#39;s probably not possible because the sums would eventually require larger jumps.Wait, let&#39;s think. Suppose we have a set where each term is the sum of two previous terms, but kept under the ratio of 3. Let me try constructing such a set step by step.Start with 1, 2. Then, 3 is 1+2. Then 4 is 1+3. Then 5 is 1+4. Then 6 is 2+4. Then 7 is 3+4. Then 8 is 3+5. Then 9 is 4+5. Then 10 is 5+5, but duplicates aren&#39;t allowed. Wait, 5+5 is invalid. So, 10 could be 2+8, 3+7, 4+6. Let&#39;s take 2+8=10. Then 11 is 1+10, 2+9, 3+8, etc. Let&#39;s take 3+8=11. Then 12 is 4+8, 5+7, etc. 4+8=12. Next, 13 could be 5+8, 6+7. 5+8=13. 14=6+8, 7+7. So 6+8=14. 15=7+8. So 15. Then 16=1+15, but 1+15=16. 16 would be next. Wait, but 16 is 1+15, and since 15 is already in the set, 16 can be formed. However, 16 is less than 3*15=45, so that&#39;s okay. Wait, but 16 is more than three times the previous term, which was 15? Wait, no. The previous term was 15, so 16 is only 1.066... times larger, which is under three. So, that&#39;s okay.Wait, but in this case, the ratio between 1 and 2 is 2, between 2 and 3 is 1.5, between 3 and 4 is 1.333..., and so on. Each subsequent ratio is getting smaller. So, actually, the ratios are decreasing, so the maximum ratio between any two consecutive terms is 2 (between 1 and 2). Therefore, in such a set, the ratio between any two terms is less than 2, so certainly less than 3.But if we can keep building such a set indefinitely, adding new terms as sums of two previous terms, then we could have 100 weights all with ratios less than 2, meaning no two weights differ by a factor of three. However, the problem states that all weights are different, and each successful weight is the sum of two others. But in this case, every weight after the first two is successful, because they are all sums of two previous weights. So, in this construction, starting from 1 and 2, all subsequent weights are successful. Therefore, if we have 100 weights constructed in this way, we would have 98 successful weights (since the first two are not successful). But the problem is asking for the minimal number of successful weights needed to guarantee that two weights differ by a factor of three. If such a construction is possible with 98 successful weights without any two differing by three, then the answer would be 99. But wait, the problem says &quot;the smallest number of successful weights that would allow us to assert with certainty that the masses of some two weights differ by at least a factor of three.&quot;But in this hypothetical set with 100 weights, the first two are not successful, and the remaining 98 are successful, with no two differing by a factor of three. Therefore, in this case, having 98 successful weights does not guarantee the existence of two weights differing by three. Therefore, the minimal number must be higher than 98. But if such a set is possible, then perhaps the answer is 99? But if you have 99 successful weights, then maybe such a set cannot exist? Wait, but if you have 100 weights, two of which are not successful, then the remaining 98 are successful. So, to have 99 successful weights, you can only have one non-successful weight, which would require that the other 99 are all sums of two others. But in our previous construction, the first two weights are not successful. If you have only one non-successful weight, you need to have the rest 99 being sums of two others. Is that possible?Wait, let&#39;s see. If we have only one non-successful weight, that would mean that there&#39;s a single weight which is not the sum of any two others. But the rest 99 are sums. But in order to build the set, you need at least two starting weights. For example, in the Fibonacci-like sequence, you need two starting numbers. If you have only one starting number, you can&#39;t generate any sums because you need two numbers to add. Therefore, in any such set, you need at least two non-successful weights. Therefore, the maximum number of successful weights in such a set would be 98, with two non-successful ones. Therefore, if you have 99 successful weights, it&#39;s impossible to have such a set, meaning that there must be two weights differing by a factor of three. Therefore, the minimal number would be 99.But wait, this seems too straightforward. Let me check again. If we can indeed construct a set of 100 weights with two non-successful (the first two) and 98 successful, where no two differ by a factor of three, then 98 successful weights don&#39;t guarantee the existence. But if we have 99 successful weights, then there must be only one non-successful weight, which is impossible because you need at least two to generate the sums. Therefore, any set with 99 successful weights must have at least two weights differing by three. Therefore, the answer is 99. However, I need to verify this logic.Wait, the key point here is that to have a set where all successful weights are sums of two others, you need at least two &quot;base&quot; weights that are not sums of any others. So, in any such set, there must be at least two non-successful weights. Therefore, the maximum number of successful weights is 98. Therefore, if we have 99 successful weights, it&#39;s impossible, meaning that the set cannot exist, so in any set with 99 successful weights, there must be two weights differing by a factor of three. Hence, the answer is 99.But wait, before I conclude, let me consider if there&#39;s another way to structure the set with only one non-successful weight. Suppose you have a single weight, say x, and then all other weights are sums involving x. But to form the next weight, you need two weights. If you only have x, you can&#39;t form any sum. Therefore, you need at least two base weights. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have a set with only one non-successful weight. Therefore, the maximum number of successful weights is 98. Thus, the minimal number needed to guarantee the existence is 99. Therefore, the answer is 99. But wait, the problem is about 100 weights. So, the answer should be 99? Let me check.But let me think again. Suppose we have two base weights, a and b, with a &lt; b. Then, the next weight is a + b. Then, the next weight could be a + (a + b) = 2a + b, or b + (a + b) = a + 2b. But to keep the ratio under 3, we need each new weight to be less than 3 times the previous one. However, if a and b are chosen such that b &lt; 3a, then the next term a + b &lt; a + 3a = 4a. But the previous term was b, so the ratio between b and a + b would be (a + b)/b = 1 + a/b. Since b &gt; a, this ratio is less than 2. Then, the next term would be, say, 2a + b. The ratio between 2a + b and a + b is (2a + b)/(a + b) = 1 + a/(a + b) &lt; 2. So, each subsequent term&#39;s ratio with the previous term is less than 2, hence all terms are within a factor of 2 of each other, so certainly within a factor of 3. Therefore, such a set can be extended indefinitely with each term being the sum of two previous terms and the ratio between consecutive terms staying below 2.Therefore, in such a set, we can have 100 weights where 98 are successful, and all consecutive ratios are less than 2, so the total ratio between the largest and smallest is 2^99, which is huge, but between any two weights, the ratio is less than 2. Therefore, no two weights differ by a factor of 3 or more. Therefore, having 98 successful weights does not guarantee the existence of two weights differing by a factor of 3. Therefore, the minimal number needed is 99.However, the problem says &quot;the smallest number of successful weights that would allow us to assert with certainty that the masses of some two weights differ by at least a factor of three.&quot;Therefore, if we have 99 successful weights, then there can only be one non-successful weight. But as we saw, you need at least two non-successful weights to generate the sums. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have 99 successful weights without having two weights differing by a factor of three. Wait, why? Because if you have only one non-successful weight, you can&#39;t generate any other weights, since you need two weights to create a sum. Therefore, if there&#39;s only one non-successful weight, all other weights must be sums involving that one weight and another. But if you have only one non-successful weight, say x, then the next weight would have to be x + x = 2x, but duplicates aren&#39;t allowed. Wait, no, all weights are different. So, you can&#39;t have 2x if x is already present. Therefore, you need at least two distinct non-successful weights to start the process.Therefore, with only one non-successful weight, you can&#39;t generate any new weights because you can&#39;t form a sum of two different weights. Therefore, any set with 99 successful weights must have at least two non-successful weights, which contradicts the fact that we have 99 successful ones. Wait, no. Wait, if there are 99 successful weights, there is one non-successful weight. But as we just saw, you can&#39;t form any successful weights with only one non-successful weight. Therefore, such a set cannot exist. Therefore, if we have 99 successful weights, the set must have more than one non-successful weight, but that would require more than 100 total weights, which is impossible. Therefore, in any set of 100 weights with 99 successful ones, there must be two weights differing by a factor of three. Therefore, 99 is the minimal number.Wait, but this seems a bit abstract. Let me formalize it.In any set of weights where each successful weight is the sum of two others, there must be at least two non-successful weights (since you can&#39;t form any sums with fewer than two weights). Therefore, the maximum number of successful weights in a set of 100 weights is 98. Hence, if a set has 99 successful weights, it&#39;s impossible, meaning that our initial assumption that all successful weights are sums of two others and there are no two weights differing by a factor of three must be false. Therefore, in any such set with 99 successful weights, there must be two weights with a ratio of at least three.Therefore, the answer is 99.But wait, let me confirm with another approach.Suppose we try to maximize the number of successful weights without having any two differing by a factor of three. To do this, we can arrange the weights in a sequence where each weight is less than three times the previous one, and each weight after the first two is the sum of two previous weights. As shown earlier, such a sequence can be constructed with a ratio between consecutive terms less than 2, hence avoiding any two weights differing by three. In this case, the number of successful weights is 98 (since the first two are not successful). Therefore, 98 is possible. Hence, 99 is the minimal number that forces the existence of two weights with a ratio of at least three.Therefore, the answer is 99. So, the smallest number of successful weights needed is 99, which would be boxed as boxed{99}.Final Answerboxed{99}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the smallest number of successful weights required to guarantee that the masses of some two weights differ by at least a factor of three, we need to consider the structure of the weights and the implications of having successful weights (those that are the sum of two other weights).1. Key Insight: A successful weight is one that can be expressed as the sum of two other weights. To avoid having two weights differing by a factor of three, we can construct a set of weights where each weight is less than three times the previous one and each subsequent weight is the sum of two previous weights.2. Construction of a Set: We can start with two initial weights and build subsequent weights by summing previous ones. For example, starting with weights 1 and 2, we can generate a sequence where each new weight is the sum of two previous weights. This sequence can be constructed such that the ratio between consecutive terms is less than 2, thus avoiding any ratio of three.3. Maximum Successful Weights Without Factor of Three: In such a sequence, the first two weights are not successful (as they cannot be sums of other weights), and all subsequent weights are successful. For 100 weights, this results in 98 successful weights. This construction shows that it is possible to have 98 successful weights without any two differing by a factor of three.4. Implication of 99 Successful Weights: If we have 99 successful weights, there can only be one non-successful weight. However, to form any successful weight, we need at least two non-successful weights (as a sum requires two weights). Therefore, having 99 successful weights is impossible without violating the condition of having only one non-successful weight. This contradiction implies that there must be two weights differing by a factor of three.Thus, the smallest number of successful weights required to guarantee that some two weights differ by at least a factor of three is (boxed{99}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b2c58cb1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b2c58cb1><span class="icon" data-v-b2c58cb1>🔑:</span>Answer: 87.

Let me break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s understand what the condition means. The four-digit number has digits a (thousands place), b (hundreds place), c (tens place), and d (units place). The product (a - b)(c - d) has to be negative. For a product of two numbers to be negative, one must be positive and the other must be negative. So either:1. (a - b) &gt; 0 and (c - d) &lt; 0, or2. (a - b) &lt; 0 and (c - d) &gt; 0.Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider. Let&#39;s handle each case individually and then sum the results to get the total number of Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers.Case 1: (a - b) &gt; 0 and (c - d) &lt; 0This means that a &gt; b (the thousands digit is greater than the hundreds digit) and c &lt; d (the tens digit is less than the units digit).Case 2: (a - b) &lt; 0 and (c - d) &gt; 0Here, a &lt; b (thousands digit is less than the hundreds digit) and c &gt; d (tens digit is greater than the units digit).So, our problem reduces to calculating the number of four-digit numbers in each case and adding them together.Let&#39;s tackle each case one by one.Case 1: a &gt; b and c &lt; dFirst, note that a is a digit from 1 to 9 (since it&#39;s a four-digit number), b is from 0 to 9 (but since a &gt; b, and a is at least 1, b can be from 0 to a - 1). Similarly, c and d are digits from 0 to 9, with c &lt; d, so d can be from c + 1 to 9.But to compute the number of possibilities, perhaps we can compute the number of possible (a, b) pairs where a &gt; b and the number of possible (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d, then multiply these two quantities together. Since the thousands digit a and the hundreds digit b are independent of the tens and units digits c and d, the total number for this case should be the product of the number of (a, b) pairs and the number of (c, d) pairs.Similarly for Case 2, where a &lt; b and c &gt; d, the total number would be the product of the number of (a, b) pairs with a &lt; b and the number of (c, d) pairs with c &gt; d.Therefore, if we can compute:- For Case 1: N1 = number of (a, b) with a &gt; b           M1 = number of (c, d) with c &lt; d           Total for Case 1: N1 * M1- For Case 2: N2 = number of (a, b) with a &lt; b           M2 = number of (c, d) with c &gt; d           Total for Case 2: N2 * M2Then, total Rainbow Numbers = N1*M1 + N2*M2.So, let&#39;s compute N1, M1, N2, M2.Calculating N1 and N2 (pairs of a and b):First, a is from 1 to 9 (since it&#39;s a four-digit number). b is from 0 to 9, but subject to a &gt; b or a &lt; b.For N1 (a &gt; b):For each a (1-9), the number of possible b is a (since b can be 0 to a-1). Wait, no:Wait, if a is 1, then b can be 0 (1 possibility)If a is 2, b can be 0 or 1 (2 possibilities)...If a is 9, b can be 0-8 (9 possibilities)So, the total number of (a, b) pairs where a &gt; b is the sum from a=1 to 9 of (a). That is:Sum_{a=1}^9 a = (9*10)/2 = 45.Similarly, for N2 (a &lt; b):Here, a is from 1 to 9, and b must be greater than a but at most 9.For each a, the number of b is (9 - a).For example, if a=1, b can be 2-9 (8 possibilities)If a=2, b can be 3-9 (7 possibilities)...If a=8, b can be 9 (1 possibility)If a=9, there are 0 possibilities, since b can&#39;t be 10.So, total N2 is Sum_{a=1}^9 (9 - a) = Sum_{k=0}^8 k = (8*9)/2 = 36.Alternatively, since total possible (a, b) pairs without restriction are 9*10 = 90 (a from 1-9, b from 0-9). Then, number of pairs where a &gt; b is 45, a &lt; b is 36, and a = b is 9 (since a can be 1-9, and b=a). So 45 + 36 + 9 = 90, which checks out.Therefore, N1 = 45, N2 = 36.Calculating M1 and M2 (pairs of c and d):c and d are both digits from 0 to 9. So total possible pairs: 10*10 = 100.For M1 (c &lt; d):This is the number of pairs where the first digit is less than the second. Similarly, M2 is the number of pairs where c &gt; d.Note that for two distinct digits, either c &lt; d or c &gt; d. If c = d, then neither. The number of pairs where c = d is 10 (00, 11, ..., 99). So, the number of pairs where c ≠ d is 100 - 10 = 90. Since in these 90 pairs, exactly half have c &lt; d and half have c &gt; d. Therefore, M1 = M2 = 45.Wait, let me confirm:Alternatively, the number of pairs where c &lt; d is equal to the combination C(10, 2) = 45, since we choose two distinct digits and arrange them in increasing order. Similarly, the number of pairs where c &gt; d is also C(10, 2) = 45.Therefore, M1 = M2 = 45.Therefore, regardless of c and d, since they can be 0-9, the counts for M1 and M2 are both 45.So, returning to our cases:Case 1: N1 * M1 = 45 * 45 = 2025Case 2: N2 * M2 = 36 * 45 = 1620Therefore, total Rainbow Numbers = 2025 + 1620 = 3645.Wait, but hold on. Let me check my logic again.Wait, for M1 and M2, since c and d can be from 0-9, including leading zeros for c (since c is the tens place, which can be 0). But in four-digit numbers, c can indeed be 0, so that&#39;s okay. So, the calculation of M1 and M2 as 45 each is correct.Similarly, for N1 and N2, the counts are 45 and 36 respectively. Hence, multiplying those with M1 and M2 gives the correct totals for each case.Therefore, adding them together gives 45*45 + 36*45 = (45 + 36)*45 = 81*45. Let me compute that:81 * 45: 80*45 = 3600, 1*45 = 45, so 3600 + 45 = 3645.Hence, 3645. But let me verify this with another approach to be safe.Alternative approach:Total four-digit numbers: 9000 (from 1000 to 9999).We can compute how many numbers satisfy (a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0.Note that (a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0 is equivalent to either (a &gt; b and c &lt; d) or (a &lt; b and c &gt; d). So, the total is indeed the sum of these two cases.We can also note that the probability that (a &gt; b) is 45/90 = 0.5 (since in the (a, b) pairs, 45 are a &gt; b out of 90 possible a≠b pairs). Wait, no. Wait, total (a, b) pairs are 9*10=90. The number where a &gt; b is 45, a &lt; b is 36, and a = b is 9. Therefore, if we ignore the a = b cases, the ratio is 45:36. But since we are considering all four-digit numbers, including those where a = b, but in our problem, even if a = b, the product (a - b)(c - d) would be 0, which is not less than 0, so those numbers are excluded. So, our initial calculation is correct.But let&#39;s see if the total numbers calculated (3645) make sense. Since total four-digit numbers are 9000, 3645 is roughly 40.5% of them, which seems plausible.Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of probability.The probability that (a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0 is equal to the probability that (a &gt; b and c &lt; d) plus the probability that (a &lt; b and c &gt; d).Let’s compute each probability:Probability(a &gt; b) = N1 / 90 = 45 / 90 = 0.5Wait, but N1 is 45, but total (a, b) pairs are 9*10=90. So, if we consider all four-digit numbers, the number where a &gt; b is 45*10*10=4500 (since c and d can be anything). Similarly, the number where a &lt; b is 36*10*10=3600, and a = b is 9*10*10=900. So, 4500 + 3600 + 900 = 9000, which checks out.Similarly, for (c, d), in all four-digit numbers, the number of (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d is 45*9*10=45*90=4050? Wait, no.Wait, no. Wait, for each four-digit number, the (c, d) pair is independent. So, the number of four-digit numbers where c &lt; d is 9*10*45 (since a can be 1-9, b can be 0-9, and (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d is 45). So, 9*10*45 = 4050 numbers where c &lt; d.Similarly, numbers where c &gt; d is 9*10*45 = 4050, and c = d is 9*10*10 = 900. So, 4050 + 4050 + 900 = 9000.But in our problem, we need to combine the conditions on (a, b) and (c, d).Therefore, the number of numbers where (a &gt; b and c &lt; d) is N1 * M1 = 45 * 45 = 2025. Similarly, (a &lt; b and c &gt; d) is 36 * 45 = 1620. So total 2025 + 1620 = 3645. Which is the same as before.Therefore, the answer is 3645. But let me check again.Wait, but N1 is 45, which is the number of (a, b) pairs where a &gt; b. But for each such pair, there are 10*10 possibilities for c and d. Wait, no, in our problem, when we calculated N1, we considered all possible (a, b) pairs where a &gt; b, and for each such pair, how many (c, d) pairs satisfy c &lt; d, which is 45. Therefore, the total is 45 * 45. Wait, but N1 is 45? Wait, no, wait.Wait, confusion arises. Wait, let&#39;s clarify:Wait, for the first case, (a &gt; b) and (c &lt; d):How many four-digit numbers satisfy this?First, a can be from 1 to 9. For each a, b can be from 0 to a - 1, so for a given a, there are a choices for b. Then, for c and d, they can be any digits where c &lt; d. The number of (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d is 45.Therefore, the total number of such numbers is Sum_{a=1}^9 [a * 45].Sum_{a=1}^9 a = 45, so total is 45 * 45 = 2025. Similarly, for the second case, (a &lt; b) and (c &gt; d). Here, for each a from 1 to 9, the number of b is (9 - a). Therefore, Sum_{a=1}^9 (9 - a) = 36, so total numbers here are 36 * 45 = 1620. Therefore, total is 2025 + 1620 = 3645.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute it step by step.For the first case (a &gt; b and c &lt; d):For each a from 1 to 9:Number of possible b: 0 to a - 1, which is a values.For each such (a, b), the number of (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d is 45.Therefore, for each a, the count is a * 45.Sum over a from 1 to 9:Sum_{a=1}^9 (a * 45) = 45 * Sum_{a=1}^9 a = 45 * 45 = 2025.Similarly, for the second case (a &lt; b and c &gt; d):For each a from 1 to 9:Number of possible b: a + 1 to 9, which is (9 - a) values.For each such (a, b), the number of (c, d) pairs where c &gt; d is 45.Therefore, for each a, the count is (9 - a) * 45.Sum over a from 1 to 9:Sum_{a=1}^9 ( (9 - a) * 45 ) = 45 * Sum_{a=1}^9 (9 - a) = 45 * Sum_{k=0}^8 k = 45 * 36 = 1620.Hence, 2025 + 1620 = 3645.Therefore, the total number of Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers is 3645.But let me confirm once more with a small example.Take a smaller case, like two-digit numbers where (a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0. Wait, but two-digit numbers only have a and b. Maybe not. Let me think.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if the counts for (c, d) pairs are correct.For (c, d), how many pairs have c &lt; d?If c and d are digits from 0-9, the number is C(10, 2) = 45. Because choosing two distinct digits, and arranging them in increasing order. Similarly, c &gt; d is also 45. So that&#39;s correct.For (a, b) pairs where a &gt; b, a is from 1-9, b from 0-9.Number of pairs where a &gt; b is Sum_{a=1}^9 a = 45, which is correct.Similarly, pairs where a &lt; b is Sum_{a=1}^9 (9 - a) = 36. Correct.Therefore, multiplying the counts and adding them up gives 45*45 + 36*45 = 3645.Hence, I think the answer is 3645.Final AnswerThe number of &quot;Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers&quot; is boxed{3645}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of &quot;Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers&quot; among positive four-digit numbers, we need to consider the condition ((a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0). This condition is satisfied in two cases:1. (a &gt; b) and (c &lt; d)2. (a &lt; b) and (c &gt; d)Case 1: (a &gt; b) and (c &lt; d)- For each thousands digit (a) (1 to 9), the hundreds digit (b) can range from 0 to (a - 1). The number of such pairs ((a, b)) is (sum_{a=1}^9 a = 45).- For each tens digit (c) (0 to 9), the units digit (d) can range from (c + 1) to 9. The number of such pairs ((c, d)) is (binom{10}{2} = 45).- Total numbers for Case 1: (45 times 45 = 2025).Case 2: (a &lt; b) and (c &gt; d)- For each thousands digit (a) (1 to 9), the hundreds digit (b) can range from (a + 1) to 9. The number of such pairs ((a, b)) is (sum_{a=1}^9 (9 - a) = 36).- For each tens digit (c) (0 to 9), the units digit (d) can range from 0 to (c - 1). The number of such pairs ((c, d)) is (binom{10}{2} = 45).- Total numbers for Case 2: (36 times 45 = 1620).Total Rainbow Four-Digit NumbersAdding the results from both cases:[2025 + 1620 = 3645]Thus, the number of &quot;Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers&quot; is (boxed{3645}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to figure out how many four-digit numbers are &quot;Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers&quot; based on the condition that (a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.First, let&#39;s parse the definition. A four-digit number has digits a (thousands place), b (hundreds), c (tens), and d (units). The number is a Rainbow Four-Digit Number if the product (a - b)(c - d) is negative. That means either (a - b) is positive and (c - d) is negative, or vice versa. So, essentially, either a &gt; b and c &lt; d, or a &lt; b and c &gt; d. So, my task is to count all four-digit numbers (from 1000 to 9999) where either:1. The thousands digit is greater than the hundreds digit and the tens digit is less than the units digit, or2. The thousands digit is less than the hundreds digit and the tens digit is greater than the units digit.I need to calculate the number of such numbers and sum them up.Let me break this down into two separate cases: Case 1 where a &gt; b and c &lt; d, and Case 2 where a &lt; b and c &gt; d. Then, add the counts from both cases.First, I need to determine how many possibilities there are for each case.Starting with Case 1: a &gt; b and c &lt; d.For a four-digit number, a can be from 1 to 9 (since it&#39;s a four-digit number, a cannot be 0). Then, b is from 0 to 9, but must be less than a. Similarly, c and d are digits from 0 to 9, with d being greater than c.Similarly, Case 2: a &lt; b and c &gt; d. Here, a is from 1 to 9, b is from 0 to 9 but greater than a, c is from 0 to 9, and d is from 0 to 9 but less than c.However, there&#39;s an overlap where a ≠ b and c ≠ d in both cases, but since we&#39;re dealing with products being negative, the cases are mutually exclusive. Wait, actually, in the definition, the product is negative only when one of the terms is positive and the other is negative. Therefore, these two cases are indeed mutually exclusive because in one case (a - b) is positive and (c - d) is negative, and in the other, (a - b) is negative and (c - d) is positive. Therefore, there&#39;s no overlap between Case 1 and Case 2. Hence, the total number of Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers is the sum of the counts of these two cases.Therefore, I can compute the number of possibilities for each case separately and then add them together.Let me first handle Case 1: a &gt; b and c &lt; d.For a &gt; b:a can range from 1 to 9. For each a, b can range from 0 to a - 1. So, for each a, the number of possible b&#39;s is a. For example, if a is 1, b can only be 0; if a is 2, b can be 0 or 1, etc., up to a = 9, where b can be 0 through 8, which is 9 possibilities.Similarly, for c &lt; d:c and d are digits from 0 to 9. For each c, d can range from c + 1 to 9. So, for each c, the number of possible d&#39;s is 9 - c. For example, if c is 0, d can be 1 to 9 (9 possibilities); if c is 1, d can be 2 to 9 (8 possibilities), etc., down to c = 8, where d can only be 9 (1 possibility), and c = 9, where there are no possible d&#39;s (since d must be greater than c, but d can&#39;t be 10).Therefore, the number of possible (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d is the sum over c from 0 to 8 of (9 - c). Let me calculate that.Sum from c=0 to 8 of (9 - c) is the same as sum from k=1 to 9 of k, which is (9*10)/2 = 45. So, there are 45 possible (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d.Similarly, the number of possible (a, b) pairs where a &gt; b is the sum over a=1 to 9 of a. Because for each a, there are a possible b&#39;s. So, sum from a=1 to 9 of a is (9*10)/2 = 45. Wait, that&#39;s the same as the previous sum. So, 45 possible (a, b) pairs where a &gt; b.Therefore, for Case 1, the total number of four-digit numbers is 45 (for a &gt; b) multiplied by 45 (for c &lt; d), which is 45*45 = 2025.Similarly, for Case 2: a &lt; b and c &gt; d.For a &lt; b:a can be from 1 to 8 (since b must be at least a + 1 and b is a digit up to 9). For each a, b can range from a + 1 to 9. So, the number of possible b&#39;s for each a is 9 - a. For example, if a = 1, b can be 2-9 (8 possibilities); a = 2, b can be 3-9 (7 possibilities), etc., down to a = 8, where b can only be 9 (1 possibility). a = 9 is impossible here because b cannot be greater than 9.Therefore, the number of (a, b) pairs where a &lt; b is sum from a=1 to 8 of (9 - a). Let me compute that.Sum from a=1 to 8 of (9 - a) is the same as sum from k=1 to 8 of k (if we let k = 9 - a, then when a=1, k=8; a=2, k=7; ...; a=8, k=1). So, sum from k=1 to 8 of k is (8*9)/2 = 36. Wait, but let&#39;s check:If a=1, 9 -1=8; a=2,7; a=3,6; a=4,5; a=5,4; a=6,3; a=7,2; a=8,1. So sum is 8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 36. Correct.So, there are 36 possible (a, b) pairs where a &lt; b.For c &gt; d:c and d are digits from 0 to 9. For each c, d can range from 0 to c - 1. So, the number of possible d&#39;s for each c is c. For example, if c=1, d can be 0 (1 possibility); c=2, d can be 0 or 1 (2 possibilities), ..., up to c=9, d can be 0-8 (9 possibilities). c=0 is impossible here since d can&#39;t be less than 0.Therefore, the number of (c, d) pairs where c &gt; d is sum from c=1 to 9 of c. Which is (9*10)/2 = 45. So, 45 possible (c, d) pairs where c &gt; d.Therefore, for Case 2, the total number of four-digit numbers is 36 (for a &lt; b) multiplied by 45 (for c &gt; d), which is 36*45. Let me compute that.36*45: 36*40 = 1440; 36*5 = 180; 1440 + 180 = 1620. So, 1620 numbers.Therefore, total Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers would be 2025 (Case 1) + 1620 (Case 2) = 3645.Wait, but let me check if that&#39;s correct. Because when we calculated for a &gt; b, the number was 45 (a from 1-9, each a contributes a possible b&#39;s). But wait, is this correct? Let me double-check.Wait, in Case 1, when a is from 1 to 9, for each a, the number of b&#39;s is a (since b can be from 0 to a-1). So, sum from a=1 to 9 of a is 1 + 2 + ... + 9 = 45. Correct. And (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d is 45 as well, so 45*45=2025. That seems right.In Case 2, a &lt; b. Since a is from 1 to 8, as for a=9, there&#39;s no b greater than 9. For each a from 1 to 8, the number of b&#39;s is 9 - a. Sum from a=1 to 8 of (9 - a) is 8 + 7 + ... +1 = 36. Then, the number of (c, d) pairs where c &gt; d is 45. So, 36*45=1620. Adding 2025 + 1620 gives 3645.But wait, hold on. Let me verify with a different approach.Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem by considering the possible relations between a and b, and c and d.In any four-digit number, the digits a, b, c, d are such that a ∈ [1,9], b,c,d ∈ [0,9]. The relations between a and b can be:1. a &gt; b2. a = b3. a &lt; bSimilarly, the relations between c and d can be:1. c &gt; d2. c = d3. c &lt; dSo, there are 3x3=9 possible combinations of these relations. The problem asks for the cases where (a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0. Which corresponds to either:- (a &gt; b and c &lt; d) or (a &lt; b and c &gt; d). These are two of the nine possible combinations.So, the total number of four-digit numbers is 9000 (from 1000 to 9999). But we need to count how many of these have either (a &gt; b and c &lt; d) or (a &lt; b and c &gt; d).Therefore, if we can compute the number of numbers where a &gt; b and c &lt; d, and add it to the number where a &lt; b and c &gt; d, we get the answer.Previously, I computed 2025 + 1620 = 3645. Let me check if that&#39;s correct.But let&#39;s see. For a &gt; b, how many (a, b) pairs are there? As we calculated, 45. For each such pair, there are 10*10 possibilities for c and d. But wait, no. Wait, in Case 1, we are restricting to c &lt; d. So, for each (a, b) pair where a &gt; b, we need to multiply by the number of (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d, which is 45. Similarly, for Case 2.Wait, but is 45 the correct number of (c, d) pairs where c &lt; d?Yes, because when considering two digits c and d, the number of ordered pairs where c &lt; d is the same as the number of combinations where c &gt; d. Since for any two distinct digits, either c &lt; d or c &gt; d. The number of pairs where c ≠ d is 10*9 = 90. So, half of them would be c &lt; d and half c &gt; d. But wait, actually, for each combination where c ≠ d, exactly one of c &lt; d or c &gt; d is true. So, the number of pairs where c &lt; d is equal to the number of pairs where c &gt; d, which is 45. Because the total number of ordered pairs with c ≠ d is 90, split equally into 45 each. However, when c and d are equal, there are 10 pairs (c=0,d=0 up to c=9,d=9).Wait, but in our calculation earlier, we found 45 pairs where c &lt; d, which is correct. Because for unordered pairs, the number is C(10,2) = 45. But since we are considering ordered pairs where c &lt; d, it&#39;s the same as the number of combinations, which is 45. Similarly, the ordered pairs where c &gt; d is also 45. The 10 pairs where c = d are separate.So, this confirms that for c and d, there are 45 ordered pairs where c &lt; d, 45 where c &gt; d, and 10 where c = d. Therefore, the same applies to a and b, but with a caveat: a cannot be 0.Wait, but for a and b, a is from 1-9, and b from 0-9. So, the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a &gt; b is different from the number where a &lt; b. Because a can&#39;t be zero. Let&#39;s verify.For (a, b):Total possible pairs: 9*10 = 90 (a from 1-9, b from 0-9).In these 90 pairs, how many have a &gt; b, a = b, or a &lt; b.Let&#39;s compute the number of pairs where a &gt; b.For each a from 1-9, the number of b&#39;s less than a is a. For example, a=1: b=0 (1); a=2: b=0,1 (2); ..., a=9: b=0-8 (9). So, total is 1 + 2 + ... +9 = 45. That&#39;s 45 pairs.Similarly, the number of pairs where a &lt; b.For each a from 1-9, the number of b&#39;s greater than a. For a=1, b=2-9 (8); a=2, b=3-9 (7); ...; a=8, b=9 (1); a=9, none. So, total is 8 +7 + ... +1 = 36.Number of pairs where a = b: For a from 1-9, b=a, so 9 pairs.Total: 45 + 36 +9=90. Correct.Therefore, (a, b) pairs: 45 where a &gt; b, 36 where a &lt; b, 9 where a = b.Similarly, for (c, d) pairs: 45 where c &lt; d, 45 where c &gt; d, 10 where c = d.Therefore, returning to the problem.Case 1: (a &gt; b) and (c &lt; d). Number of such numbers: 45 (a &gt; b) * 45 (c &lt; d) = 2025.Case 2: (a &lt; b) and (c &gt; d). Number of such numbers: 36 (a &lt; b) * 45 (c &gt; d) = 1620.Total: 2025 + 1620 = 3645.So, the answer should be 3645. But let me check if there&#39;s a possibility of miscalculating somewhere.Wait, the critical points here are:1. Correctly calculating the number of (a, b) pairs for each case.2. Correctly calculating the number of (c, d) pairs for each case.3. Multiplying them appropriately.We verified that (a &gt; b) gives 45 pairs, (a &lt; b) gives 36 pairs. For (c, d), each direction gives 45 pairs. So, 45*45 and 36*45. Then, adding them.Alternatively, perhaps there is a different way to compute this.Alternatively, note that the total number of four-digit numbers where (a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0 is equal to the number of four-digit numbers where (a &gt; b and c &lt; d) plus (a &lt; b and c &gt; d).Alternatively, since these are independent pairs (the relation between a and b is independent of c and d), except that they are digits in the number. Wait, but actually, a, b, c, d are all digits in the number, but the choice of a and b doesn&#39;t affect c and d, so they are independent variables. Therefore, the total number is indeed the product of the number of (a, b) pairs satisfying the first condition multiplied by the number of (c, d) pairs satisfying the second condition.Therefore, this approach is valid. Therefore, 45*45 + 36*45 = 45*(45 + 36) = 45*81 = 3645. Correct.Alternatively, 45*81: 40*81=3240, 5*81=405, so 3240+405=3645. Yes.Therefore, I think the answer is 3645.But just to be thorough, let me consider a small example to see if the counts make sense.Take a simple case where we have two-digit numbers instead of four-digit numbers, and apply a similar condition. For example, if we have a number with digits a and b, and we want (a - b) &lt; 0. Then, the number of such two-digit numbers would be the number of (a, b) pairs where a &lt; b. Here, a is from 1-9, b from 0-9. So, similar to our previous calculation, the number of pairs where a &lt; b is 36. Wait, but in two-digit numbers, b can be 0-9, but the total number is 9*10=90. If we count a &lt; b, as 36, then a &gt; b is 45, and a = b is 9, totaling 90. So, that&#39;s correct.But let&#39;s see for a two-digit example, maybe with a smaller range. Suppose a is 1-2, b is 0-2. Then total pairs are 2*3=6. The pairs where a &gt; b: For a=1, b=0 (1); a=2, b=0,1 (2). Total 3. Pairs where a &lt; b: For a=1, b=2; a=2, b= none. Total 1. Pairs where a = b: a=1, b=1; a=2, b=2. Total 2. So, 3 +1 +2=6. So, in this case, (a &gt; b) is 3, (a &lt; b) is 1. So, if we were to compute for a similar condition over two digits, like (a - b)(c - d) &lt;0, but in two-digit numbers, but perhaps the example is not directly applicable. But the point is, the method of calculating pairs where a &gt; b and then multiplying by pairs where c &lt; d works when the digits are independent.Therefore, returning to the original problem, the same logic applies. Since a, b are independent of c, d, the total number is the product of the counts for the respective digit pairs. Therefore, the answer 3645 seems correct.But let me check with an example given in the problem statement. The example is 2012. Let&#39;s parse that.2012: a=2, b=0, c=1, d=2.Compute (a - b)(c - d): (2 - 0)(1 - 2) = 2*(-1) = -2 &lt; 0. Therefore, it is a Rainbow number.According to our calculation, such numbers exist when either (a &gt; b and c &lt; d) or (a &lt; b and c &gt; d). In the case of 2012, a=2 &gt; b=0, and c=1 &lt; d=2. Therefore, it falls into Case 1. So, in our count, Case 1 has 2025 numbers. This example is one of them. So, the calculation seems to include this example.Another example: Suppose a=1, b=2, c=3, d=1. Then, (1 - 2)(3 - 1) = (-1)(2) = -2 &lt; 0. So, this is Case 2: a &lt; b and c &gt; d. This should be counted in the 1620 numbers.Therefore, both cases are covered. Hence, the total is 2025 + 1620 = 3645.Therefore, I think the answer is 3645. So, I will put that as the final answer.Final Answerboxed{3645}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of &quot;Rainbow Four-Digit Numbers&quot; among positive four-digit numbers, we need to count numbers where ((a - b)(c - d) &lt; 0).
