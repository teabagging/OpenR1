The problem is about a line that&#39;s parallel to one of two parallel planes. I need to figure out the relationship between this line and the other plane. The options are parallel, intersecting, within the plane, or parallel or within the plane. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about planes and lines in geometry.First, if two planes are parallel, they never intersect, right? So they&#39;re always the same distance apart and don&#39;t meet. Now, there&#39;s a line that&#39;s parallel to one of these planes. I need to see how this line relates to the other plane.Let me visualize this. Imagine two parallel planes, like two sheets of paper lying flat on a table but not touching each other. If a line is parallel to the first plane, does that mean it&#39;s also parallel to the second one? Or could it lie on the second plane?Wait, if a line is parallel to a plane, that means the line doesn&#39;t intersect the plane and isn&#39;t lying on it. So being parallel is different from being within the plane. But since the two planes are parallel, maybe the line&#39;s relationship to the second plane is similar to its relationship to the first one?But the options include &quot;parallel or within the plane.&quot; So maybe there&#39;s a possibility that the line could be either parallel or lying on the second plane? Hmm. How is that possible?Let me think. Suppose we have two parallel planes, let&#39;s call them Plane A and Plane B. If a line is parallel to Plane A, then the line doesn&#39;t intersect Plane A and isn&#39;t on Plane A. Now, what about Plane B? Since Plane A and Plane B are parallel, any line that&#39;s parallel to Plane A might have a similar relationship with Plane B. But wait, could the line actually be lying on Plane B?Wait, if the line is parallel to Plane A, which is parallel to Plane B, does that mean the line could be on Plane B? Or is it necessarily parallel?Let me consider an example. Let&#39;s say Plane A is the xy-plane (z=0) and Plane B is the plane z=1, so they&#39;re parallel. If a line is parallel to Plane A, that means the line is either in a plane parallel to the xy-plane or is parallel in direction. For example, a line in the plane z=2 would be parallel to Plane A, but such a line would also be parallel to Plane B (z=1). Alternatively, a line in Plane B (z=1) itself would also be parallel to Plane A, because it&#39;s in a plane that&#39;s parallel. Wait, no. If the line is in Plane B, then the line is not parallel to Plane B, but actually lies within Plane B. But the original statement says the line is parallel to one of the two parallel planes, say Plane A. So if the line is in Plane B, which is parallel to Plane A, is the line considered parallel to Plane A?Wait, if a line is within a plane that&#39;s parallel to another plane, is the line itself parallel to the other plane? Let me recall the definition. A line is parallel to a plane if it doesn&#39;t intersect the plane and isn&#39;t in the plane. So if the line is in Plane B, which is parallel to Plane A, then the line is in Plane B, so it doesn&#39;t intersect Plane A (since Plane B and Plane A don&#39;t intersect). But since the line is in Plane B, is it considered parallel to Plane A? Or does being in Plane B mean it&#39;s not parallel, because parallel requires the line not to be in the plane. Hmm, maybe I need to check that.So, if a line is in Plane B, then it can&#39;t be parallel to Plane B. But the problem says the line is parallel to Plane A, which is parallel to Plane B. So if the line is in Plane B, is it parallel to Plane A? Let&#39;s see. Since Plane A and Plane B are parallel, a line in Plane B would not intersect Plane A. So according to the definition, if a line doesn&#39;t intersect a plane and isn&#39;t in the plane, it&#39;s parallel. But in this case, the line is in Plane B, which is parallel to Plane A. So the line is not in Plane A, but it doesn&#39;t intersect Plane A because Plane B is parallel. Therefore, is the line considered parallel to Plane A? Wait, the line is in Plane B, so its distance to Plane A is constant (the same as the distance between the planes). Therefore, the line doesn&#39;t lie on Plane A and doesn&#39;t intersect it, so by definition, it&#39;s parallel to Plane A. So a line in Plane B would be parallel to Plane A. But the original problem says the line is parallel to one of the two parallel planes. So in this case, the line is parallel to Plane A and lies within Plane B. Therefore, when considering the relationship between the line and Plane B, which is the other plane, the line is within Plane B.But in another scenario, suppose the line is not in Plane B. For example, suppose we have Plane A (z=0) and Plane B (z=1). If the line is, say, along the z-axis? Wait, no. If the line is parallel to Plane A, then its direction must be such that it doesn&#39;t have a component perpendicular to Plane A. Wait, maybe the direction vector of the line is perpendicular to the normal vector of Plane A. For Plane A (z=0), the normal vector is (0,0,1). So a line parallel to Plane A would have a direction vector perpendicular to (0,0,1), which means its direction vector is in the xy-plane. So, for example, a line in the direction (1,0,0) in 3D space. If such a line is not in Plane B (z=1), then it would be parallel to Plane B as well. Because the direction vector is still in the xy-plane, and Plane B is z=1. So such a line, if it&#39;s not in Plane B, would be parallel to Plane B. But if the line is in Plane B, then it&#39;s within Plane B.Wait, so the line could either be parallel to Plane B or lying within Plane B, depending on its position. Therefore, the positional relationship between the line and the other plane (Plane B) is either parallel or within the plane. So the answer would be D: Parallel or within the plane.Let me check if this makes sense. Suppose the two planes are parallel. A line parallel to one of them could either lie in the other plane or be parallel to it. For instance, if the line is in the other plane, it&#39;s obviously within that plane. If the line is outside both planes, then since it&#39;s parallel to one, it must be parallel to the other as well, because the planes are parallel. So yes, the line could be either parallel to the other plane or lying within it. Therefore, the correct answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given two parallel planes, Plane A and Plane B, we need to determine the positional relationship between a line that is parallel to Plane A and the other plane, Plane B.1. Definition of Parallel Planes: Two parallel planes do not intersect and are a constant distance apart.2. Line Parallel to a Plane: A line is parallel to a plane if it does not intersect the plane and is not within the plane.3. Line Relationship with Plane B:   - If the line is parallel to Plane A, it does not intersect Plane A and is not within Plane A.   - Since Plane A and Plane B are parallel, the line&#39;s relationship with Plane B depends on its position:     - If the line is not within Plane B, it will be parallel to Plane B (as it does not intersect Plane B and is not within it).     - If the line is within Plane B, it is obviously within the plane.Thus, the line can either be parallel to Plane B or lie within Plane B. Therefore, the correct answer is:boxed{D},&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem says: If a line is parallel to one of two parallel planes, then what&#39;s the relationship between this line and the other plane? The options are A: Parallel, B: Intersecting, C: Within the plane, D: Parallel or within the plane. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.First, let&#39;s recall some basics about planes and lines in 3D geometry. Two parallel planes don&#39;t intersect each other, right? So they&#39;re always the same distance apart. Now, if there&#39;s a line that&#39;s parallel to one of these planes, what does that mean exactly? When a line is parallel to a plane, it means the line doesn&#39;t intersect the plane and isn&#39;t lying on it. So the line is either outside the plane and never meets it, or it&#39;s in the plane. Wait, no—if it&#39;s in the plane, then it&#39;s not parallel, it&#39;s just part of the plane. So being parallel to a plane implies that the line is not on the plane and doesn&#39;t intersect it.Now, the two planes are parallel. So if the line is parallel to the first plane, what&#39;s its relationship with the second plane? Let me visualize this. Imagine two parallel planes, like two sheets of paper lying flat on a table, one above the other. If there&#39;s a line that&#39;s parallel to the bottom plane, where could that line be? If the line is parallel to the bottom plane, then it must be going in a direction that&#39;s parallel to the surface of that bottom plane. So, if the line is not on the bottom plane, it could be somewhere in between the two planes or above the top plane. But since the top plane is parallel to the bottom one, the direction of the line being parallel to the bottom plane would also be parallel to the top plane, right?Wait, but is that necessarily true? Let me think. If a line is parallel to a plane, its direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane. Since the two planes are parallel, their normal vectors are the same. So if the line is parallel to the first plane, its direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector of both planes. Therefore, the line should also be parallel to the second plane. So in that case, the line could either be parallel to the second plane or lying on it? Wait, if the line is on the second plane, then it&#39;s not parallel, it&#39;s just part of the plane. But if the line is parallel to the first plane, can it lie on the second plane?Hmm, let&#39;s see. Suppose the line is on the second plane. Then, since the second plane is parallel to the first, the line would also be parallel to the first plane. Wait, but if the line is on the second plane, which is parallel to the first, then the line can&#39;t intersect the first plane. So in that case, the line is parallel to the first plane. But the problem states that the line is already parallel to one of the two parallel planes. So if the line is on the second plane, then it&#39;s parallel to the first plane. So in this scenario, the line could either be on the second plane or parallel to it? But if the line is on the second plane, isn&#39;t that just a case of being within the plane? So the options are either the line is parallel to the second plane or it&#39;s lying on it. Therefore, the answer should be D: Parallel or within the plane.Wait, but how can the line be within the second plane? If the line is parallel to the first plane, then if it&#39;s on the second plane, it&#39;s still parallel to the first plane. So the problem says the line is parallel to one of the two parallel planes. So if the line is on the other plane (the second plane), then it&#39;s still parallel to the first plane. Therefore, being on the second plane is a possibility. But can the line also be parallel to the second plane? If the line is not on the second plane and is parallel to the first plane, then since the first and second planes are parallel, the line must also be parallel to the second plane. So the line can either be parallel to the second plane or lying on it. Therefore, the answer is D.Alternatively, maybe I should test with an example. Let&#39;s take two parallel planes, say z=0 and z=1. So their normal vectors are both in the z-direction. Now, a line parallel to the first plane z=0 would have a direction vector perpendicular to the z-axis. For example, a horizontal line. Let&#39;s take a line that&#39;s parallel to z=0. If the line is in the plane z=1, then it&#39;s lying on the second plane. For example, the line x= t, y=0, z=1. This line is parallel to the x-axis, so it&#39;s parallel to the plane z=0, and it&#39;s lying on the plane z=1. Alternatively, if the line is not on z=1, but is between z=0 and z=1, say z=0.5, then it would still be parallel to both planes. For example, x= t, y=0, z=0.5. This line doesn&#39;t lie on either plane but is parallel to both. Wait, but in this case, the line is parallel to the second plane z=1. So in this case, the line is parallel to both planes. So depending on the position, the line can either be within the second plane or parallel to it. So that&#39;s why D is the correct answer.But wait, if the line is within the second plane, isn&#39;t that considered intersecting? Because the line is on the plane, so all points are intersecting. But in the options, C is &quot;Within the plane&quot; and B is &quot;Intersecting&quot;. But in the problem statement, it&#39;s asking for the positional relationship. If a line is within the plane, it&#39;s not considered intersecting in the same way as a line that crosses the plane at a single point. So in 3D geometry, a line can either be parallel to a plane, intersect it at a point, or lie on the plane. So &quot;within the plane&quot; is a separate case from intersecting. Therefore, the possibilities for the line and the second plane are either parallel, or lying on the plane. So the answer is D.Another way to think about it: if the line is parallel to the first plane, its direction vector is perpendicular to the normal of the first plane. Since the second plane has the same normal, the direction vector is also perpendicular to the normal of the second plane. Therefore, the line is either parallel to the second plane or lies on it. Because if a line&#39;s direction is parallel to a plane (i.e., perpendicular to the plane&#39;s normal), then the line can either be on the plane or parallel to it. So that&#39;s why D is correct.Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given a line that is parallel to one of two parallel planes, we need to determine its positional relationship with the other plane.1. Understanding Parallel Planes: Two parallel planes have the same normal vector and do not intersect. A line parallel to one plane means its direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector of that plane.2. Direction Vector Consideration: Since the two planes are parallel, they share the same normal vector. If a line is parallel to one plane, its direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector of both planes.3. Positional Relationship: A line with a direction vector perpendicular to the normal vector of a plane can either be parallel to the plane or lie within the plane. If the line is not within the second plane, it must be parallel to it. If the line is within the second plane, it is still parallel to the first plane by definition.4. Conclusion: The line can either be parallel to the second plane or lie within it.Thus, the positional relationship between the line and the other plane is either parallel or within the plane.[boxed{D}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e7dc6219></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>🔑:</span>If a line is parallel to one of two parallel planes,  then the positional relationship between this line and the other plane is either parallel to the plane or within the plane,  therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{D}}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-3f387df1 data-v-e7dc6219><div class="review" data-v-e7dc6219><div class="review-title" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>❓:</span>5.

All the cubes have their sides painted red, green, or yellow. The problem states that there are 100 cubes in total. Out of these, 75 have at least one red side, 80 have at least one green side, and 85 have at least one yellow side. The question is asking for the smallest possible number of cubes that have sides of all three colors. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me paraphrase the problem to make sure I understand it. We have 100 cubes, each with all their sides painted in one or more colors: red, green, or yellow. So each cube could have one color on all sides, multiple colors on different sides, or maybe all three colors on different sides. But the key thing is that when they say a cube &quot;has at least one red side,&quot; that means the cube has at least one face painted red, even if the other faces are different colors. Similarly for green and yellow.Now, we need to find the minimal number of cubes that have all three colors. That is, cubes that have at least one red side, at least one green side, and at least one yellow side. So, how can we approach this? It sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Maybe I need to use that to calculate the overlap between the different color groups.Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. For three sets A, B, and C, the number of elements in at least one of the sets is given by:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.But in our case, we know the total number of cubes is 100, and all the cubes have at least one color. Wait, actually, the problem doesn&#39;t specify whether all cubes have at least one color. Wait, the problem says &quot;all of whose sides are painted red, green, or yellow.&quot; So, each cube has all sides painted, but each side can be red, green, or yellow. So a cube could have all sides red, or some combination. So, in that case, every cube must have at least one color, but a cube could have all sides one color, or multiple colors. So, when they say &quot;75 cubes have at least one red side,&quot; that means 75 cubes have at least one face red. Similarly for green and yellow.But the total number of cubes is 100, so some cubes might only have one color, some two, and some all three. We need to find the minimum number of cubes that have all three colors. So, the minimal possible |A ∩ B ∩ C|, where A is the set of cubes with at least one red side, B with at least one green, and C with at least one yellow.Given that |A| = 75, |B| = 80, |C| = 85, and the total is 100. So, we need to compute the minimal |A ∩ B ∩ C|.In inclusion-exclusion, the formula for the union is:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.But since all cubes have at least one color, then |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 100. Therefore,100 = 75 + 80 + 85 - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.Let me compute the left side first. 75 + 80 + 85 is 240. So,100 = 240 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.Rearranging,|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 240 - 100 = 140.So,(|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) - |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 140.But we need to find the minimal |A ∩ B ∩ C|. To minimize the number of cubes with all three colors, we need to maximize the overlaps between pairs, i.e., |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |B ∩ C|, as much as possible. Because the higher the pairwise overlaps, the lower the necessity for triple overlaps.Wait, actually, the formula is (sum of pairwise intersections) minus (triple intersection) equals 140. So, if we want to minimize the triple intersection, we need to maximize the sum of pairwise intersections.But the sum of pairwise intersections can&#39;t exceed certain limits. For example, |A ∩ B| can&#39;t be more than the size of the smaller set, so min(|A|, |B|) = 75. Similarly, |A ∩ C| ≤ 75, and |B ∩ C| ≤ 80. But if we try to maximize each pairwise intersection, we can set |A ∩ B| = 75, |A ∩ C| = 75, and |B ∩ C| = 80. Then the sum would be 75 + 75 + 80 = 230. Then, substituting into the equation:230 - |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 140 =&gt; |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 230 - 140 = 90. But that can&#39;t be possible, since the total number of cubes is 100, and 90 cubes having all three colors would mean that 90 cubes have all three colors, but then how do the remaining 10 cubes fit into the counts? For example, set A has 75 cubes with red. If 90 cubes have all three colors, then all those 90 are included in the 75, which would mean that 90 ≤ 75, which is not possible. So, that approach is invalid.So, clearly, there is a mistake here. The problem is that when we set |A ∩ B| = 75, we assume that all cubes in A are also in B. But if A is 75 cubes and B is 80 cubes, the maximum intersection is 75, since A is smaller. But if |A ∩ B| = 75, then all cubes in A are in B, so B consists of 75 cubes from A and 5 cubes not in A. Similarly, |A ∩ C| can be at most 75, so if we set that to 75, then all cubes in A are also in C. But then, C is 85 cubes, so it would consist of 75 cubes from A and 10 cubes not in A. Similarly, |B ∩ C| can be at most 80, but since B has 80 cubes, if we set |B ∩ C| = 80, then all cubes in B are in C. Wait, but C is 85 cubes. So, if all 80 cubes of B are in C, then C has 80 from B and 5 others not in B.But let&#39;s see how this plays out. If |A ∩ B| = 75, |A ∩ C| = 75, and |B ∩ C| = 80, then:- All 75 cubes in A are also in B and C.- Then B has 75 from A and 5 more not in A. But since |B ∩ C| = 80, those 5 in B not in A must also be in C. So, C has 75 from A and 5 from B, and since C has 85 total, there are 5 more cubes in C not in A or B.- However, A is 75, which is entirely in B and C. B is 80: 75 in A, 5 in C. C is 85: 75 in A, 5 in B, 5 neither in A nor B.But then, how does this affect the counts? Let&#39;s check the total number of cubes. The total would be the number in A (75) plus the number in B not in A (5) plus the number in C not in A or B (5). So 75 + 5 + 5 = 85. But we have 100 cubes. So, where are the remaining 15 cubes?Wait, this seems contradictory. If the above setup only accounts for 85 cubes, but we have 100, then this approach is missing something. The problem is that we are trying to maximize pairwise overlaps, but perhaps this is not the right way because each time we set a pairwise overlap to the maximum, we might be excluding other overlaps.Alternatively, perhaps we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion more carefully. Let me recall that in inclusion-exclusion, the formula can be rearranged to solve for the triple overlap:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∪ B ∪ C|.But since |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 100, then:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 75 + 80 + 85 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) + 100 - 100Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s go back.Earlier, we had:100 = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.Therefore,|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| - 100.Which is:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 75 + 80 + 85 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) - 100So,|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 240 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) - 100Which simplifies to:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 140 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|)Wait, that can&#39;t be, because then:Wait, original equation:100 = 75 + 80 + 85 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) + |A ∩ B ∩ C|So rearranged:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 100 - (75 + 80 + 85) + (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|)Which is:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - 140Therefore, to minimize |A ∩ B ∩ C|, we need to minimize the value of |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|. Wait, no, hold on. If |A ∩ B ∩ C| is equal to |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - 140, then to minimize |A ∩ B ∩ C|, we need to minimize the sum |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|. Because if the sum is as small as possible, then |A ∩ B ∩ C| is as small as possible. But this contradicts my initial thought.Wait, no. Wait, if |A ∩ B ∩ C| equals (sum of pairwise overlaps) minus 140, then the smaller the sum of pairwise overlaps, the smaller |A ∩ B ∩ C|. Therefore, to minimize |A ∩ B ∩ C|, we need to minimize the sum of the pairwise overlaps. But how?But I thought earlier that to minimize the triple overlap, we need to maximize the pairwise overlaps. But according to this formula, it&#39;s the opposite. Hmm. Let me think again.Suppose we have higher pairwise overlaps. Then, (sum of pairwise overlaps) is higher, so |A ∩ B ∩ C| would be higher as well. Wait, but the formula is |A ∩ B ∩ C| = (sum of pairwise overlaps) - 140. So if the sum of pairwise overlaps is as small as possible, then |A ∩ B ∩ C| is as small as possible. Therefore, to minimize the triple overlap, we need to minimize the sum of pairwise overlaps.But how does that make sense? Let me check with an example.Suppose we have three sets A, B, C, each of size 50 in a universe of 50 elements. Then, if all three sets are the same, the triple overlap is 50, and the pairwise overlaps are 50 each. Then, according to the formula:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = (50 + 50 + 50) - 140 = 150 - 140 = 10. Wait, but in reality, if all three sets are the same 50 elements, then |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 50. So clearly, the formula is not being applied correctly here. Wait, no. Wait, the formula in this case would be:For the union:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|If A, B, and C are all the same 50 elements, then:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = 50So,50 = 50 + 50 + 50 - 50 - 50 - 50 + |A ∩ B ∩ C|Which simplifies to:50 = 150 - 150 + |A ∩ B ∩ C| =&gt; |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 50, which is correct. So in that case, using the formula:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - (|A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∪ B ∪ C|)Wait, in the original problem, we had:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - (|A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∪ B ∪ C|)Which in our problem is:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - 140.So, in the example where A, B, C are all 50, then |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 50, and |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 50 + 50 + 50 = 150. Then 150 - 140 = 10, which does not equal 50. Wait, so that seems contradictory. Therefore, my previous conclusion must be wrong.Wait, hold on, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me rederive it.Given:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|Therefore,|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A ∪ B ∪ C| - |A| - |B| - |C| + |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|In our problem, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 100, so:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 100 - 75 - 80 - 85 + |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|Which simplifies to:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 100 - 240 + (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|)Therefore,|A ∩ B ∩ C| = (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) - 140So, yes, that&#39;s correct. Therefore, to minimize |A ∩ B ∩ C|, we need to minimize (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|). The smaller the sum of the pairwise intersections, the smaller the triple intersection. Therefore, my initial thought was wrong. It&#39;s the opposite. To minimize the triple overlap, we need to minimize the sum of the pairwise overlaps.But how does that make sense? Let&#39;s think of a simple case. If the pairwise intersections are as small as possible, then the triple intersection would also be as small as possible. For example, if there&#39;s minimal overlap between the sets, the triple overlap would be minimized. However, in our problem, since all the sets are quite large (75, 80, 85 out of 100), the overlaps can&#39;t be too small.Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible value of |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| given that |A| = 75, |B| = 80, |C| = 85, and the total is 100. Once we find that minimal sum, then plug it into the equation |A ∩ B ∩ C| = sum - 140, and that would give us the minimal triple overlap.So, how do we find the minimal possible |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|?I remember that for two sets, the minimal intersection is |A| + |B| - N, where N is the total number of elements. But in three sets, it&#39;s more complicated. Maybe we can use linear programming or some inequalities.Alternatively, we can use the principle that the minimal sum of the pairwise intersections occurs when the overlaps are as small as possible. For each pair, the minimal possible intersection is |A| + |B| - N. But let&#39;s check.For two sets, the minimal intersection is |A| + |B| - N, if that&#39;s non-negative. Otherwise, it&#39;s zero. So, for A and B, which have 75 and 80 elements, the minimal intersection is 75 + 80 - 100 = 55. Similarly, for A and C: 75 + 85 - 100 = 60. For B and C: 80 + 85 - 100 = 65. So, the minimal possible pairwise intersections are 55, 60, and 65 respectively. Therefore, the minimal sum of pairwise intersections is 55 + 60 + 65 = 180. Then, substituting into the equation:|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 180 - 140 = 40. So, the minimal triple overlap is 40.But wait, is that possible? Let&#39;s check if these minimal pairwise intersections can coexist.That is, can we have |A ∩ B| = 55, |A ∩ C| = 60, |B ∩ C| = 65, all at the same time?To check this, let&#39;s consider the maximum possible overlaps with other sets.Wait, for example, if |A ∩ B| is minimized to 55, then the number of elements only in A is 75 - 55 = 20, and the number of elements only in B is 80 - 55 = 25. Then, the rest of the elements (100 - 55 - 20 -25) = 0. Wait, that&#39;s not possible because we have other sets.Wait, perhaps I need to use a Venn diagram approach here.Let me denote:- a = number of elements only in A- b = number of elements only in B- c = number of elements only in C- ab = number of elements in A ∩ B but not in C- ac = number of elements in A ∩ C but not in B- bc = number of elements in B ∩ C but not in A- abc = number of elements in A ∩ B ∩ CThen, we have:a + ab + ac + abc = 75 (total in A)b + ab + bc + abc = 80 (total in B)c + ac + bc + abc = 85 (total in C)Also, the total number of elements is:a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc = 100We need to find the minimal abc.Our goal is to minimize abc. To do that, we need to maximize a, b, c, ab, ac, bc as much as possible, subject to the above equations.Let me express the variables:From the first equation:a = 75 - ab - ac - abcFrom the second:b = 80 - ab - bc - abcFrom the third:c = 85 - ac - bc - abcNow, substituting into the total equation:(75 - ab - ac - abc) + (80 - ab - bc - abc) + (85 - ac - bc - abc) + ab + ac + bc + abc = 100Simplify:75 + 80 + 85 - ab - ac - abc - ab - bc - abc - ac - bc - abc + ab + ac + bc + abc = 100Combine like terms:75 + 80 + 85 - (2ab + 2ac + 2bc + 3abc) + (ab + ac + bc + abc) = 100Which simplifies to:240 - (ab + ac + bc + 2abc) = 100Therefore,ab + ac + bc + 2abc = 240 - 100 = 140So,ab + ac + bc + 2abc = 140But we need to find the minimal abc. Let&#39;s denote abc = x. Then, ab + ac + bc = 140 - 2x.Our other equations are:a = 75 - ab - ac - xb = 80 - ab - bc - xc = 85 - ac - bc - xAll variables a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, x must be non-negative integers.To minimize x, we need to maximize ab + ac + bc, since ab + ac + bc = 140 - 2x. So, to minimize x, maximize ab + ac + bc, which is equivalent to making 140 - 2x as large as possible. Hence, x as small as possible.But we need to make sure that a, b, c are non-negative.Let me think. The maximum possible value of ab + ac + bc is 140, which would occur when x = 0. But when x = 0, then ab + ac + bc = 140. Let&#39;s check if this is possible.If x = 0, then:a = 75 - ab - acb = 80 - ab - bcc = 85 - ac - bcAlso, a, b, c ≥ 0.So, we need to find non-negative integers ab, ac, bc such that:ab + ac ≤ 75ab + bc ≤ 80ac + bc ≤ 85and ab + ac + bc = 140.Wait, but ab + ac + bc = 140, while ab + ac ≤ 75, ab + bc ≤ 80, and ac + bc ≤ 85. Let&#39;s see if this is possible.From ab + ac ≤ 75 and ab + bc ≤ 80 and ac + bc ≤ 85.But if we add ab + ac + ab + bc + ac + bc, that&#39;s 2ab + 2ac + 2bc ≤ 75 + 80 + 85 = 240.But ab + ac + bc = 140, so 2(ab + ac + bc) = 280 ≤ 240? But 280 ≤ 240 is false. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have ab + ac + bc = 140 with x = 0. Therefore, x cannot be 0.So, need to find the minimal x such that 140 - 2x ≤ (75 + 80 + 85)/2 = 120. Wait, but 140 - 2x ≤ 120 =&gt; 2x ≥ 20 =&gt; x ≥ 10. Hmm, but this is a rough estimation. Let&#39;s approach this differently.Since ab + ac + bc = 140 - 2x, and we need ab + ac ≤ 75, ab + bc ≤ 80, ac + bc ≤ 85.Let me denote S = ab + ac + bc = 140 - 2x.We need:ab + ac ≤ 75 --&gt; S - bc ≤ 75 --&gt; bc ≥ S - 75Similarly,ab + bc ≤ 80 --&gt; S - ac ≤ 80 --&gt; ac ≥ S - 80ac + bc ≤ 85 --&gt; S - ab ≤ 85 --&gt; ab ≥ S - 85Therefore,bc ≥ S - 75ac ≥ S - 80ab ≥ S - 85But since ab, ac, bc are non-negative, these inequalities imply:S - 75 ≥ 0 =&gt; S ≥ 75S - 80 ≥ 0 =&gt; S ≥ 80S - 85 ≥ 0 =&gt; S ≥ 85Therefore, S must be at least 85.But S = 140 - 2x, so 140 - 2x ≥ 85 =&gt; 2x ≤ 55 =&gt; x ≤ 27.5. Since x must be an integer, x ≤ 27. But we are trying to minimize x, so this doesn&#39;t directly help.Wait, but if S must be at least 85, then 140 - 2x ≥ 85 =&gt; x ≤ 27.5. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps we can approach this by using the inequalities:From bc ≥ S - 75ac ≥ S - 80ab ≥ S - 85Since ab, ac, bc are non-negative, the right-hand sides must be non-negative.So:S - 75 ≥ 0 =&gt; S ≥ 75S - 80 ≥ 0 =&gt; S ≥ 80S - 85 ≥ 0 =&gt; S ≥ 85Therefore, S must be at least 85.So, the minimal S is 85, which would require that:bc ≥ 85 - 75 = 10ac ≥ 85 - 80 = 5ab ≥ 85 - 85 = 0So, when S = 85, we have:bc ≥ 10, ac ≥ 5, ab ≥ 0Then, ab + ac + bc = 85. Let&#39;s see if we can find such integers ab, ac, bc.Let me set ab as 0 (minimum), then ac + bc = 85.With ac ≥ 5 and bc ≥ 10.So, let ac = 5, then bc = 80. But bc = 80. Let&#39;s check if this works.If ab = 0, ac = 5, bc = 80.Then,a = 75 - ab - ac - x = 75 - 0 - 5 - x = 70 - xb = 80 - ab - bc - x = 80 - 0 - 80 - x = 0 - x = -xWait, but b can&#39;t be negative. Therefore, this is impossible.So, setting ab = 0 and S = 85 leads to b = -x, which is impossible. Therefore, S = 85 is not feasible.Therefore, need to increase S beyond 85.Wait, let&#39;s try S = 90.Then, 140 - 2x = 90 =&gt; x = 25.Then, bc ≥ 90 -75 = 15ac ≥ 90 -80 = 10ab ≥ 90 -85 =5So, ab ≥5, ac ≥10, bc ≥15Then, ab + ac + bc = 90.Let&#39;s try to set ab =5, ac=10, bc=75.But bc=75, which is more than the total of set B and C?Wait, set B has 80 elements, set C has 85 elements. The intersection bc is the number of elements in B ∩ C but not in A. So, bc can be at most the minimum of |B|, |C|, but since B is 80 and C is 85, the intersection B ∩ C can be up to 80, but bc is the part not in A, so bc can be up to 80 - |A ∩ B ∩ C|. Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if the variables a, b, c are non-negative.If S =90, then:a =75 - ab - ac - x =75 -5 -10 -25=35b=80 -ab - bc -x=80 -5 -15 -25=35c=85 -ac - bc -x=85 -10 -15 -25=35So, a=35, b=35, c=35, ab=5, ac=10, bc=15, abc=25.Total cubes:35+35+35+5+10+15+25= 35*3 + 5+10+15+25=105 +55=160. Wait, that&#39;s way over 100. Wait, that can&#39;t be.Wait, this approach is not working. Maybe my method is flawed.Wait, I think I need to step back. Let&#39;s recall that in the Venn diagram approach, the total number of elements is:a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc = 100And the equations for the sets:a + ab + ac + abc =75b + ab + bc + abc=80c + ac + bc + abc=85Our goal is to minimize abc.Let me express the variables in terms of abc = x.Then:a =75 - ab - ac -xb=80 -ab - bc -xc=85 -ac - bc -xAlso, total:a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + x=100Substituting a, b, c:(75 - ab - ac -x) + (80 - ab - bc -x) + (85 - ac - bc -x) + ab + ac + bc +x=100Simplify:75 +80 +85 -ab -ac -x -ab -bc -x -ac -bc -x +ab +ac +bc +x=100Which becomes:240 -2ab -2ac -2bc -3x +ab +ac +bc +x=100Simplify:240 -ab -ac -bc -2x=100Therefore:ab + ac + bc +2x=140So, ab + ac + bc=140 -2xOur goal is to minimize x, so we need to maximize ab + ac + bc.But ab, ac, bc must satisfy the constraints from a, b, c being non-negative.So, a=75 -ab -ac -x≥0Similarly,b=80 -ab - bc -x≥0c=85 -ac - bc -x≥0Therefore,ab + ac ≤75 -xab + bc ≤80 -xac + bc ≤85 -xLet me denote:Equation 1: ab + ac ≤75 -xEquation 2: ab + bc ≤80 -xEquation 3: ac + bc ≤85 -xAnd we have ab + ac + bc=140 -2xLet me add equations 1, 2, 3:(ab + ac) + (ab + bc) + (ac + bc) ≤ (75 -x) + (80 -x) + (85 -x)Which simplifies to:2ab + 2ac + 2bc ≤240 -3xBut since ab + ac + bc=140 -2x, multiplying by 2 gives 2ab + 2ac + 2bc=280 -4xTherefore,280 -4x ≤240 -3x=&gt;280 -240 ≤4x -3x=&gt;40 ≤xSo, x≥40.Therefore, the minimal possible value of x is 40.Now, check if x=40 is possible.If x=40, then ab + ac + bc=140 -80=60.Now, check if equations 1, 2, 3 are satisfied.Equation 1: ab + ac ≤75 -40=35Equation 2: ab + bc ≤80 -40=40Equation 3: ac + bc ≤85 -40=45But ab + ac + bc=60Let me denote:Let’s set ab + ac =35 (maximum allowed by equation 1). Then bc=60 -35=25.Now, check equation 2: ab + bc=ab +25≤40 ⇒ ab ≤15And equation 3: ac + bc=ac +25≤45 ⇒ ac ≤20But ab + ac=35, so if ab ≤15 and ac ≤20, then maximum ab + ac=15+20=35. Which matches. So, let&#39;s set ab=15, ac=20, bc=25.Then:a=75 -ab -ac -x=75 -15 -20 -40=0b=80 -ab - bc -x=80 -15 -25 -40=0c=85 -ac - bc -x=85 -20 -25 -40=0So, a=0, b=0, c=0.Then total cubes:a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc=0+0+0+15+20+25+40=100.Perfect, that adds up to 100. So, this is a valid solution.Therefore, the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is 40.Wait, so the answer is 40? Let me confirm once again.If we set abc=40, then the pairwise overlaps are ab=15, ac=20, bc=25. So:- Set A has a=0, ab=15, ac=20, abc=40. Total:0+15+20+40=75. Correct.- Set B has b=0, ab=15, bc=25, abc=40. Total:0+15+25+40=80. Correct.- Set C has c=0, ac=20, bc=25, abc=40. Total:0+20+25+40=85. Correct.Total number of cubes:0+0+0+15+20+25+40=100. Correct.All variables are non-negative, so this works. Therefore, the minimal possible number is 40.But wait, the problem is in Chinese, right? Wait, no, the user hasn&#39;t specified. But given the problem statement, this seems correct. So, according to this calculation, the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is 40.But wait, let me check again the logic. We used the Venn diagram approach, set up equations, found that x must be at least 40, and constructed an example where x=40 works. Therefore, the answer is 40.But let me think differently. Suppose we have 75 cubes with at least one red side. So, 25 cubes have no red sides. Similarly, 20 cubes have no green sides, and 15 cubes have no yellow sides.The minimal number of cubes that have all three colors is equivalent to the total minus the maximum number of cubes that are missing at least one color.Wait, another approach: the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is equal to the total number minus the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color.So, the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color is the union of the cubes missing red, missing green, or missing yellow.By the inclusion-exclusion principle:|¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| = |¬R| + |¬G| + |¬Y| - |¬R ∩ ¬G| - |¬R ∩ ¬Y| - |¬G ∩ ¬Y| + |¬R ∩ ¬G ∩ ¬Y|But since all cubes have at least one color, there are no cubes missing all three colors. So, |¬R ∩ ¬G ∩ ¬Y|=0.Therefore,|¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| = (25 + 20 + 15) - (|¬R ∩ ¬G| + |¬R ∩ ¬Y| + |¬G ∩ ¬Y|)We need to maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, which is equivalent to minimizing the number of cubes with all three colors. Because the total is 100, so:Number of cubes with all three colors = 100 - |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|Therefore, to minimize the cubes with all three colors, we need to maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|.To maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, we need to minimize the intersections |¬R ∩ ¬G|, |¬R ∩ ¬Y|, |¬G ∩ ¬Y|. Because:|¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| = 25 + 20 + 15 - (|¬R ∩ ¬G| + |¬R ∩ ¬Y| + |¬G ∩ ¬Y|)So, the larger |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| is, the smaller the sum (|¬R ∩ ¬G| + |¬R ∩ ¬Y| + |¬G ∩ ¬Y|).But the sum of the intersections can&#39;t be less than the sum of individual sets minus the total, according to the inclusion-exclusion principle. Wait, but perhaps another way: the minimal possible value of |¬R ∩ ¬G| + |¬R ∩ ¬Y| + |¬G ∩ ¬Y| is ?Wait, each of these intersections is the number of cubes missing two colors. For example, |¬R ∩ ¬G| is the number of cubes missing both red and green, which means they are entirely yellow. Similarly, |¬R ∩ ¬Y| is the number of cubes missing red and yellow (entirely green), and |¬G ∩ ¬Y| is the number missing green and yellow (entirely red).But since each cube must have all sides painted with some color, a cube missing two colors must be entirely the third color.Therefore, |¬R ∩ ¬G| is the number of cubes that are entirely yellow. Similarly, |¬R ∩ ¬Y| is entirely green, and |¬G ∩ ¬Y| is entirely red.So, the cubes missing at least one color are the cubes that are entirely red, entirely green, entirely yellow, or some combination. Wait, no. Wait, cubes missing at least one color include those missing one color, two colors, or all three. But since all cubes have at least one color, the only possibilities are missing one or two colors.But cubes that are entirely one color are missing two colors, as they have all sides painted with one color, so they don&#39;t have the other two.So, the cubes missing red are those that have no red sides, which could be entirely green, entirely yellow, or some combination of green and yellow. Wait, but since all sides of a cube are painted, if a cube has no red sides, then all its sides must be either green or yellow. However, if a cube is entirely green, it&#39;s missing red and yellow. If it&#39;s entirely yellow, it&#39;s missing red and green. If it has a mix of green and yellow sides, then it&#39;s missing red but has both green and yellow.But in our problem, the counts are:- 25 cubes have no red sides: these can be entirely green, entirely yellow, or have both green and yellow.- 20 cubes have no green sides: these can be entirely red, entirely yellow, or have both red and yellow.- 15 cubes have no yellow sides: these can be entirely red, entirely green, or have both red and green.However, the cubes that are entirely one color (missing two colors) are counted in two of these missing color categories. For example, a cube that&#39;s entirely green is missing red and yellow, so it&#39;s counted in ¬R and ¬Y.Therefore, when we compute |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, which is the total number of cubes missing at least one color, we need to subtract the overlaps appropriately. But since we want to maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, which would require minimizing the overlaps, i.e., having as few cubes as possible that are missing two colors.Wait, but the maximum |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| is achieved when the overlaps are as small as possible. The overlaps are the cubes missing two colors, i.e., entirely one color. So, to maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, we need to minimize the number of cubes that are entirely one color.But how does that work? Let me think.The maximum possible |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| would be the sum of |¬R|, |¬G|, |¬Y| minus the minimal possible overlaps. So, according to inclusion-exclusion:|¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| = |¬R| + |¬G| + |¬Y| - |¬R ∩ ¬G| - |¬R ∩ ¬Y| - |¬G ∩ ¬Y| + |¬R ∩ ¬G ∩ ¬Y|But since all cubes have at least one color, |¬R ∩ ¬G ∩ ¬Y| = 0. Therefore,|¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| = 25 + 20 +15 - (|¬R ∩ ¬G| + |¬R ∩ ¬Y| + |¬G ∩ ¬Y|)To maximize this, we need to minimize the sum (|¬R ∩ ¬G| + |¬R ∩ ¬Y| + |¬G ∩ ¬Y|).What is the minimal possible value of this sum?Each term |¬R ∩ ¬G| is the number of cubes that are entirely yellow. Similarly, |¬R ∩ ¬Y| is entirely green, and |¬G ∩ ¬Y| is entirely red.Let’s denote:y = number of entirely yellow cubes (missing red and green)g = number of entirely green cubes (missing red and yellow)r = number of entirely red cubes (missing green and yellow)So, |¬R ∩ ¬G| = y|¬R ∩ ¬Y| = g|¬G ∩ ¬Y| = rTherefore, the sum is y + g + r.Additionally, the cubes missing one color are:- Missing red only: cubes that have at least one green and at least one yellow side, but no red sides. Let&#39;s denote this as a.- Missing green only: cubes that have at least one red and at least one yellow side, but no green sides. Denote as b.- Missing yellow only: cubes that have at least one red and at least one green side, but no yellow sides. Denote as c.Then, the total number of cubes missing exactly one color is a + b + c.And the total number of cubes missing at least one color is a + b + c + y + g + r.But according to the given numbers:|¬R| =25 = a + y + g (missing red includes those missing only red (a), and those missing red and green (y), and missing red and yellow (g))Similarly,|¬G|=20 = b + g + r|¬Y|=15 = c + y + rTherefore, we have:1. a + y + g =252. b + g + r =203. c + y + r =15And the total number of cubes missing at least one color is:a + b + c + y + g + r = |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|Our goal is to maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, which is equivalent to maximizing a + b + c + y + g + r. To do this, we need to maximize a + b + c, since y + g + r is being subtracted in the inclusion-exclusion formula.But perhaps another approach: Since we need to minimize y + g + r to maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, and we can express a, b, c in terms of y, g, r:From equation 1: a =25 - y - gFrom equation 2: b =20 - g - rFrom equation 3: c =15 - y - rTherefore,a + b + c =25 - y - g +20 - g - r +15 - y - r=60 -2y -2g -2rSo,|¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y| = a + b + c + y + g + r = (60 -2y -2g -2r) + y + g + r=60 - y - g - rTherefore, to maximize |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|, we need to minimize y + g + r.But we also have constraints that a, b, c ≥0.From equation 1: a =25 - y - g ≥0 ⇒ y + g ≤25From equation 2: b =20 - g - r ≥0 ⇒ g + r ≤20From equation 3: c =15 - y - r ≥0 ⇒ y + r ≤15So, we need to find the minimal possible value of y + g + r given:y + g ≤25,g + r ≤20,y + r ≤15,and y, g, r ≥0.This is a linear programming problem. Let me try to find the minimal y + g + r.Let’s denote S = y + g + r. We need to minimize S.Constraints:1. y + g ≤252. g + r ≤203. y + r ≤154. y, g, r ≥0To minimize S, let&#39;s try to find the minimal S.Let me express r from constraint 3: r ≤15 - yFrom constraint 2: g + r ≤20. Substituting r ≤15 - y:g + (15 - y) ≤20 ⇒ g ≤ y +5From constraint 1: y + g ≤25. Substituting g ≤ y +5:y + (y +5) ≤25 ⇒2y +5 ≤25 ⇒2y ≤20 ⇒y ≤10Therefore, y can be at most 10.Let me set y=10 (maximum possible). Then,From constraint 3: r ≤15 -10=5From constraint 2: g + r ≤20. To minimize S=y + g + r, set r as large as possible. So, set r=5.Then from constraint 2: g +5 ≤20 ⇒g ≤15From constraint 1: y + g ≤25 ⇒10 +g ≤25 ⇒g ≤15So, set g=15 (maximum possible).Then, S=10 +15 +5=30.Check if this satisfies all constraints:1. y + g=25 ≤25 ✔️2. g + r=20 ≤20 ✔️3. y + r=15 ≤15 ✔️Perfect. Therefore, minimal S=30.Therefore, the maximum |¬R ∪ ¬G ∪ ¬Y|=60 - S=60 -30=30.Therefore, the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is 100 -30=70.Wait, but this contradicts the previous result of 40. There&#39;s inconsistency here. Which one is correct?Wait, this approach suggests that the minimal number is 70, but the Venn diagram approach suggested 40. There must be a mistake.Wait, let&#39;s check the second approach. If we can have a maximum of 30 cubes missing at least one color, then the minimal number with all three colors is 70. But according to the first approach, we found a configuration where only 40 cubes have all three colors. Which is correct?Wait, the problem arises from different interpretations of the problem. Wait, in the first approach, we considered cubes with all three colors as those having at least one side of each color. In the second approach, we considered cubes missing a color as those having no sides of that color, and the cubes with all three colors are those that are not missing any color, i.e., have at least one side of each color. So, both approaches are referring to the same thing.But the results are conflicting. So, which is correct?Wait, let&#39;s check the second approach again. If S = y + g + r =30, then:y=10, g=15, r=5.Then,a=25 - y -g=25 -10 -15=0b=20 -g -r=20 -15 -5=0c=15 - y -r=15 -10 -5=0So, all a, b, c are zero. Therefore, all cubes missing at least one color are those missing two colors, which are entirely one color: 10 entirely yellow, 15 entirely green, 5 entirely red. Total:10+15+5=30.Therefore, the remaining cubes are 100 -30=70, which must have at least one side of each color. Therefore, 70 cubes have all three colors.But according to the first approach, we constructed a case where only 40 cubes have all three colors, with 0 cubes entirely red, green, or yellow. How is this possible?Wait, there&#39;s a misunderstanding here. In the first approach, we set the overlaps such that there are 15 cubes in A ∩ B but not C, 20 in A ∩ C but not B, 25 in B ∩ C but not A, and 40 in all three. The remaining cubes (0 in a, b, c) are all in the intersections.But in this case, the cubes in A ∩ B but not C are cubes that have at least one red and green side, but no yellow sides. Similarly, the ones in A ∩ C but not B have no green sides, and the ones in B ∩ C but not A have no red sides.But according to the problem statement, the cubes have all their sides painted with red, green, or yellow. So, a cube in A ∩ B but not C has at least one red and at least one green side, but no yellow sides. Since all sides are painted, this cube must have some combination of red and green, but no yellow. Therefore, such a cube is missing yellow. Similarly, a cube in A ∩ C but not B is missing green, and a cube in B ∩ C but not A is missing red.But in the first approach, we had 15 +20 +25=60 cubes missing one color: 15 missing yellow, 20 missing green, 25 missing red. Plus 40 cubes with all three colors. Total 60+40=100.But according to the second approach, cubes missing a color can include those missing one or two colors. But in the first approach, the 60 cubes are missing exactly one color, and the 40 cubes are missing none. But according to the problem&#39;s initial statement, cubes have all sides painted with some color, so missing a color just means that none of their sides are of that color. Therefore, a cube can miss one, two, or three colors. But since all sides are painted, missing three colors is impossible (as that would require a cube with no painted sides). Therefore, in the problem, cubes can miss at most two colors.But in the first approach, the 60 cubes missing one color (i.e., having no sides of that color) and having the other two colors. While in the second approach, the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color is 30, all missing two colors. But this is conflicting.Wait, the confusion is arising from different interpretations. Let me clarify:In the first approach, when we have a cube in A ∩ B but not C, that cube has at least one red and green side, but no yellow sides. Therefore, it is missing yellow. So, it is part of ¬Y. Similarly, a cube in A ∩ C but not B is missing green (part of ¬G), and a cube in B ∩ C but not A is missing red (part of ¬R).Therefore, the 15 +20 +25=60 cubes missing one color. But according to the second approach, the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color is 30. This inconsistency indicates an error in one of the approaches.Wait, in the first approach, the cubes missing one color are 60, but in the second approach, the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color is 30. Therefore, one of them is incorrect.Let me re-examine the second approach. In the second approach, we considered that the number of cubes missing at least one color is 30, composed of entirely red, green, or yellow cubes. But in reality, cubes missing one color can also have a combination of the other two colors. For example, a cube missing red can have green and yellow sides. These cubes are not entirely one color; they just don&#39;t have red.Therefore, in the second approach, we only considered cubes missing two colors (entirely one color) as overlaps, but in reality, the overlaps can also include cubes missing one color. Therefore, the mistake in the second approach is assuming that the overlaps (|¬R ∩ ¬G|, etc.) are only the entirely one-color cubes, but in reality, they can also include cubes with multiple colors but missing two.Wait, no. If a cube is in ¬R ∩ ¬G, it means it has no red and no green sides. Since all sides are painted, it must be entirely yellow. Similarly, ¬R ∩ ¬Y must be entirely green, and ¬G ∩ ¬Y must be entirely red. Therefore, the intersections of two missing colors can only be the entirely third-color cubes.Therefore, the second approach is correct in that |¬R ∩ ¬G| is the number of entirely yellow cubes, and similarly for the others. Therefore, the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color is 30, which are entirely red, green, or yellow. The remaining 70 cubes must have at least one side of each color. Therefore, the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is 70.But this contradicts the first approach, which found a configuration with 40 cubes having all three colors. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the first approach.Wait, let&#39;s revisit the first approach. We used the inclusion-exclusion principle and set up variables for the Venn diagram regions. We found that if we set abc=40, ab=15, ac=20, bc=25, and a=b=c=0, then the total is 100. However, in this configuration, the cubes in ab (15) are those in A ∩ B but not C. Since they are not in C, they have no yellow sides. Therefore, they are missing yellow. Similarly, ac=20 are missing green, and bc=25 are missing red.But in the problem statement, it&#39;s stated that all sides of the cubes are painted with red, green, or yellow. Therefore, a cube missing a color just has the other two colors. So, for example, a cube missing yellow can have red and green sides. However, in the first approach, these cubes are considered as ab, ac, bc regions. But according to the counts:- 15 cubes missing yellow (ab=15)- 20 cubes missing green (ac=20)- 25 cubes missing red (bc=25)These cubes missing one color can have a combination of the other two colors. However, in addition to these, there are 40 cubes with all three colors. Therefore, in total, the number of cubes missing at least one color is 15 +20 +25=60, which contradicts the second approach&#39;s maximum of 30.But according to the second approach, the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color is 30. Therefore, there is a conflict.The resolution lies in the fact that the second approach&#39;s maximum of 30 is under the constraint that cubes missing a color can only be those entirely one color (missing two colors). However, in reality, cubes missing one color can have multiple colors (e.g., missing red but having green and yellow), so the actual number of cubes missing at least one color can be higher than 30. Therefore, the second approach is incorrect because it only considers cubes missing two colors, but cubes missing one color also contribute to the union.Therefore, the correct approach is the first one, which accounts for cubes missing one color (ab, ac, bc) and cubes missing two colors (a, b, c). But in our first approach, we found that if we set a, b, c to zero, then the number of cubes missing one color is 60, leading to 40 cubes with all three colors. However, according to the problem&#39;s constraints, the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color is actually 60, not 30, because it includes both cubes missing one color and cubes missing two colors. Therefore, the second approach was incorrect because it only considered cubes missing two colors.Hence, the correct minimal number of cubes with all three colors is 40.But wait, why did the second approach give a different answer? Because in the second approach, we assumed that the cubes missing a color can only be those entirely one color (missing two colors), but actually, cubes missing one color can have multiple colors, so they contribute to the count of missing that color. Therefore, the second approach&#39;s calculation of the maximum number of cubes missing at least one color was incorrect.Therefore, returning to the first approach, which correctly accounts for all regions in the Venn diagram, the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is 40.Therefore, the answer should be 40. But the initial problem says &quot;the smallest possible number of cubes that have sides of all three colors.&quot; So, according to this, 40 is the minimal number.But let&#39;s cross-verify with another method.Suppose we have 75 cubes with at least one red side. So, 25 cubes have no red sides. Similarly, 20 have no green, and 15 have no yellow.To find the minimal number of cubes with all three colors, we can use the principle that:The minimal number of cubes with all three colors = |A| + |B| + |C| - 2N, where N is the total number of cubes, but this might not be directly applicable.Alternatively, another formula: the minimal overlap is |A| + |B| + |C| - 2N. For our case, this would be 75 + 80 +85 - 2*100=240 -200=40. Which matches the result from the first approach.Yes, there is a formula for the minimal number of elements in the intersection of three sets:min |A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - 2NWhen |A| + |B| + |C| - 2N ≥0, otherwise it&#39;s zero.In our case, 75 +80 +85 -200=240 -200=40. Therefore, the minimal number is 40.Therefore, this formula confirms the result from the first approach.Hence, the correct answer is 40.Final Answerboxed{40}&lt;/think&gt;Given 100 cubes, each with sides painted red, green, or yellow, we need to find the smallest possible number of cubes that have all three colors. The counts of cubes with at least one side of each color are 75 (red), 80 (green), and 85 (yellow).Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, we start with the formula:[|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|]Given that all 100 cubes have at least one color, we know:[100 = 75 + 80 + 85 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) + |A ∩ B ∩ C|]Simplifying, we get:[100 = 240 - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) + |A ∩ B ∩ C|]Rearranging terms:[|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 140]To minimize (|A ∩ B ∩ C|), we need to minimize the sum (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|). Using linear programming and considering the constraints for the overlaps, we find that the minimal value of (|A ∩ B ∩ C|) is derived when the sum of pairwise intersections is maximized under the given constraints.Through detailed analysis and verification using the principle of inclusion-exclusion and linear programming, we find that the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is given by:[|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - 2N = 75 + 80 + 85 - 2 times 100 = 40]Thus, the smallest possible number of cubes that have sides of all three colors is:[boxed{40}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here about cubes with painted sides. Let me try to wrap my head around it. There are 100 cubes, each with their sides painted red, green, or yellow. The numbers given are that 75 have at least one red side, 80 have at least one green side, and 85 have at least one yellow side. The question is asking for the smallest possible number of cubes that have all three colors on their sides. Hmm, that seems like an inclusion-exclusion problem. Let me recall how that works.Inclusion-exclusion principle is used to find the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. The formula for three sets is:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|But in this problem, we’re given the number of cubes that have at least one side of each color, which would correspond to |A|, |B|, |C| here. The total number of cubes is 100, so |A ∪ B ∪ C| is 100, because all cubes have at least one color on their sides. Wait, actually, the problem says all cubes have sides painted red, green, or yellow. So every cube has at least one color, but each color can be on different sides. But each cube has all their sides painted with some combination of red, green, or yellow. Wait, no—it says &quot;all of whose sides are painted red, green, or yellow.&quot; So each cube has six sides, each of which is either red, green, or yellow. So each cube has some combination of these colors on their sides, but each cube must have at least one side of each color? Wait, no, not necessarily. For example, a cube could have all sides red, or some sides red, some green, some yellow. But the counts given are 75 cubes with at least one red side, 80 with at least one green, 85 with at least one yellow. So &quot;at least one red side&quot; means that the cube has at least one face painted red, similarly for green and yellow.But the problem is asking for the smallest possible number of cubes that have all three colors. So we need to minimize the overlap where a cube has at least one red, at least one green, and at least one yellow side.This seems like a problem where we can model it using sets. Let me define:- Let R be the set of cubes with at least one red side. |R| = 75- Let G be the set of cubes with at least one green side. |G| = 80- Let Y be the set of cubes with at least one yellow side. |Y| = 85We need to find the minimal possible |R ∩ G ∩ Y|.Since all cubes are in the union of R, G, Y, but actually every cube has at least one color, but not necessarily. Wait, actually, the problem states that all cubes have their sides painted with red, green, or yellow. So every cube has at least one color. But if a cube has all sides red, then it would be in R but not in G or Y. Similarly, a cube could be in only R, only G, only Y, or in intersections.But the total number of cubes is 100, so the union of R, G, Y is 100. Thus, using inclusion-exclusion:|R ∪ G ∪ Y| = |R| + |G| + |Y| - |R ∩ G| - |R ∩ Y| - |G ∩ Y| + |R ∩ G ∩ Y|But since |R ∪ G ∪ Y| = 100, we can write:100 = 75 + 80 + 85 - |R ∩ G| - |R ∩ Y| - |G ∩ Y| + |R ∩ G ∩ Y|Let me compute 75 + 80 + 85: that&#39;s 240.So,100 = 240 - (|R ∩ G| + |R ∩ Y| + |G ∩ Y|) + |R ∩ G ∩ Y|Rearranging terms,(|R ∩ G| + |R ∩ Y| + |G ∩ Y|) - |R ∩ G ∩ Y| = 240 - 100 = 140So,|R ∩ G| + |R ∩ Y| + |G ∩ Y| - |R ∩ G ∩ Y| = 140But we need to find the minimal |R ∩ G ∩ Y|. Let&#39;s denote x = |R ∩ G ∩ Y|. Then,|R ∩ G| + |R ∩ Y| + |G ∩ Y| = 140 + xBut we need to express |R ∩ G|, |R ∩ Y|, |G ∩ Y| in terms of x and other variables. Wait, but how?Alternatively, maybe using the principle that for two sets, the minimal intersection is |A| + |B| - N, where N is the total number. But here, with three sets, it&#39;s more complicated.Alternatively, let me think in terms of maximizing the number of cubes that have only two colors, which would minimize the overlap of all three.To minimize x, we need to maximize |R ∩ G| + |R ∩ Y| + |G ∩ Y|, but each of these intersections can&#39;t exceed the size of the smaller set. Wait, but actually, each pairwise intersection can be at most the size of the smaller of the two sets.Wait, but since R is 75, G is 80, Y is 85. So, for example, |R ∩ G| can be at most 75, since R is only 75. Similarly, |R ∩ Y| ≤ 75, |G ∩ Y| ≤ 80.But if we want to maximize |R ∩ G| + |R ∩ Y| + |G ∩ Y|, then perhaps we need to make these intersections as large as possible. But how?Wait, but the total number of cubes is 100. So, for example, if we have R = 75, then the remaining 25 cubes are not in R. But since all cubes are in R ∪ G ∪ Y, the 25 cubes not in R must be in G or Y. But G is 80 and Y is 85. Wait, this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is given by the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me try to recall that the minimal overlap can be calculated using the formula:x ≥ |R| + |G| + |Y| - 2NWhere N is the total number of elements, but I might be misremembering.Wait, let&#39;s consider that the maximum possible number of cubes that are in exactly two sets would be the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. But this might not help.Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to minimize x, the number of cubes in all three sets. To minimize x, we need to maximize the number of cubes that are in exactly two sets. Because each cube in exactly two sets contributes to two of the pairwise intersections, but not to the triple intersection.Wait, so if we let a = number of cubes in exactly R and G, b = exactly R and Y, c = exactly G and Y, and d = exactly R, G, Y. Then:Total cubes in R: a + b + d = 75Total cubes in G: a + c + d = 80Total cubes in Y: b + c + d = 85Total cubes: a + b + c + d + (number of cubes in only R, only G, only Y) = 100But wait, but if a cube is not in any of the intersections, then it can&#39;t be in any of the sets. Wait, no. If a cube is not in any of the sets, it would have no colors. But the problem states all cubes have sides painted with red, green, or yellow. But a cube could have only one color, right? Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;all of whose sides are painted red, green, or yellow.&quot; Each cube has all its sides painted with some combination of those colors. So a cube could be entirely red, which would mean it is in R but not in G or Y. Similarly, a cube could be entirely green or entirely yellow, or have two colors, or all three.Therefore, the total number of cubes is equal to the number of cubes with only red + only green + only yellow + two-color overlaps + three-color overlaps.So:Number of cubes with only R = |R| - (a + b + d)But wait, if a is the number of cubes in exactly R and G, b is exactly R and Y, d is exactly all three. Then the number of cubes only in R is |R| - a - b - d.Similarly for G and Y.But the total number of cubes is:(|R| - a - b - d) + (|G| - a - c - d) + (|Y| - b - c - d) + a + b + c + d = 100Simplify:|R| + |G| + |Y| - 2a - 2b - 2c - 3d + a + b + c + d = 100Which simplifies to:|R| + |G| + |Y| - a - b - c - 2d = 100But |R| + |G| + |Y| = 75 + 80 + 85 = 240, so:240 - a - b - c - 2d = 100Therefore,a + b + c + 2d = 140But we need to find the minimal d, which is the number of cubes with all three colors. To minimize d, we need to maximize a + b + c. However, a, b, c are constrained by the counts in each set.From the equations:1. a + b + d = |R| - only R = 75 - only RBut the number of cubes only in R is |R| - (a + b + d). Similarly, the number of cubes only in G is |G| - (a + c + d), and only in Y is |Y| - (b + c + d).But all these &quot;only&quot; counts must be non-negative. Therefore:- For only R: 75 - (a + b + d) ≥ 0 ⇒ a + b + d ≤ 75- For only G: 80 - (a + c + d) ≥ 0 ⇒ a + c + d ≤ 80- For only Y: 85 - (b + c + d) ≥ 0 ⇒ b + c + d ≤ 85But these inequalities can be rewritten as:1. a + b ≤ 75 - d2. a + c ≤ 80 - d3. b + c ≤ 85 - dWe need to maximize a + b + c given these constraints. Let me denote S = a + b + c. Then, from the above:From 1: a + b ≤ 75 - dFrom 2: a + c ≤ 80 - dFrom 3: b + c ≤ 85 - dIf we add these three inequalities:(a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) ≤ (75 - d) + (80 - d) + (85 - d)Which simplifies to:2(a + b + c) ≤ 240 - 3dSo,2S ≤ 240 - 3d ⇒ S ≤ 120 - (3/2)dBut we also have from the earlier equation:a + b + c + 2d = 140 ⇒ S + 2d = 140 ⇒ S = 140 - 2dSo substituting into the inequality S ≤ 120 - (3/2)d,140 - 2d ≤ 120 - (3/2)dMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fractions:280 - 4d ≤ 240 - 3dSubtract 240 from both sides:40 - 4d ≤ -3dAdd 4d to both sides:40 ≤ dTherefore, d ≥ 40.So the minimal number of cubes with all three colors is 40. Let me check if this is achievable. If d = 40, then S = 140 - 2*40 = 60.Then, according to the inequalities:From 1: a + b ≤ 75 - 40 = 35From 2: a + c ≤ 80 - 40 = 40From 3: b + c ≤ 85 - 40 = 45We need to have a + b + c = 60, but with a + b ≤ 35, a + c ≤ 40, b + c ≤ 45.Let’s denote:Let’s assume a + b = 35 (maximizing a + b). Then c = 60 - 35 = 25.Check if a + c ≤ 40 ⇒ a + 25 ≤ 40 ⇒ a ≤ 15Similarly, since a + b = 35, then b = 35 - a.Then, check b + c = (35 - a) + 25 = 60 - a ≤ 45 ⇒ 60 - a ≤ 45 ⇒ a ≥ 15So from a ≤ 15 and a ≥ 15, we have a = 15.Then, b = 35 - 15 = 20, c = 25.Check the inequalities:- a + c = 15 + 25 = 40 ≤ 40 ✔️- b + c = 20 + 25 = 45 ≤ 45 ✔️So this works. So with d = 40, a = 15, b = 20, c = 25.Let me verify the counts:Number of cubes only in R: 75 - (a + b + d) = 75 - (15 + 20 + 40) = 75 - 75 = 0Only in G: 80 - (a + c + d) = 80 - (15 + 25 + 40) = 80 - 80 = 0Only in Y: 85 - (b + c + d) = 85 - (20 + 25 + 40) = 85 - 85 = 0So all cubes are in two or three sets, which is possible. So the total number of cubes is:Only R: 0Only G: 0Only Y: 0Two-color: a + b + c = 15 + 20 + 25 = 60Three-color: d = 40Total: 60 + 40 = 100 ✔️Therefore, it&#39;s achievable, and the minimal number is 40.Final AnswerThe smallest possible number of cubes with all three colors is boxed{40}.&lt;/think&gt;Given 100 cubes, each with sides painted red, green, or yellow, we need to find the smallest possible number of cubes that have all three colors. The counts given are 75 cubes with at least one red side, 80 with at least one green side, and 85 with at least one yellow side.Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, we start with the formula:[|R cup G cup Y| = |R| + |G| + |Y| - |R cap G| - |R cap Y| - |G cap Y| + |R cap G cap Y|]Since all 100 cubes are in the union of R, G, and Y, we have:[100 = 75 + 80 + 85 - (|R cap G| + |R cap Y| + |G cap Y|) + |R cap G cap Y|]Simplifying the equation:[100 = 240 - (|R cap G| + |R cap Y| + |G cap Y|) + |R cap G cap Y|]Rearranging terms:[(|R cap G| + |R cap Y| + |G cap Y|) - |R cap G cap Y| = 140]Let ( x = |R cap G cap Y| ). We need to minimize ( x ). We denote ( a = |R cap G| - x ), ( b = |R cap Y| - x ), and ( c = |G cap Y| - x ), which represent the number of cubes with exactly two colors. The equation becomes:[a + b + c + 2x = 140]To minimize ( x ), we maximize ( a + b + c ). The constraints are:1. ( a + b leq 75 - x )2. ( a + c leq 80 - x )3. ( b + c leq 85 - x )Adding these constraints:[2(a + b + c) leq 240 - 3x]Substituting ( a + b + c = 140 - 2x ):[2(140 - 2x) leq 240 - 3x]Simplifying:[280 - 4x leq 240 - 3x][40 leq x]Thus, the minimum ( x ) is 40. Verifying, if ( x = 40 ), then ( a + b + c = 60 ). Setting ( a = 15 ), ( b = 20 ), ( c = 25 ) satisfies all constraints. Therefore, the smallest possible number of cubes with all three colors is (boxed{40}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e7dc6219></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>🔑:</span>## Solution.Let:a= the number of cubes whose all sides are redb= the number of cubes whose all sides are greenc= the number of cubes whose all sides are yellowd= the number of cubes that have only red and green sidese= the number of cubes that have only red and yellow sidesf= the number of cubes that have only green and yellow sidesx= the number of cubes that have sides of all colorsThese notations can be more clearly represented by a Venn diagram.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_30_b67770dbc376921a4b0eg-5.jpg?height=405&amp;width=638&amp;top_left_y=1266&amp;top_left_x=581)yellow sideFrom the problem statement, we can read the system of equations:begin{aligned}x+a+d+e &amp; =75 x+b+d+f &amp; =80 x+c+e+f &amp; =85 x+a+b+c+d+e+f &amp; =100end{aligned}Sum the first three equations and subtract twice the fourth equation.

Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember there are some algebraic identities for cubes. Maybe I can use the formula for a³ - b³? Let me recall: a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²). Yeah, that seems right. So if I let a = sinα and b = cosα, then sin³α - cos³α would be (sinα - cosα)(sin²α + sinα cosα + cos²α). Wait, the problem gives me sinα - cosα = n, so that part is just n. Then the second part is sin²α + sinα cosα + cos²α. Hmm, sin²α + cos²α is equal to 1, that&#39;s a fundamental identity. So this simplifies to 1 + sinα cosα. So now, sin³α - cos³α = n(1 + sinα cosα). But I still need to find sinα cosα. How can I find that from the given information? Let&#39;s see, we know sinα - cosα = n. Maybe I can square both sides to get sin²α - 2 sinα cosα + cos²α = n². Again, sin²α + cos²α is 1, so that becomes 1 - 2 sinα cosα = n². Then solving for sinα cosα: subtract 1 from both sides, -2 sinα cosα = n² - 1, then divide both sides by -2: sinα cosα = (1 - n²)/2. So plugging that back into the earlier expression, sin³α - cos³α = n(1 + (1 - n²)/2). Let&#39;s simplify that. First, inside the parentheses: 1 + (1 - n²)/2. Let&#39;s write 1 as 2/2 to combine the fractions: 2/2 + (1 - n²)/2 = (2 + 1 - n²)/2 = (3 - n²)/2. Therefore, sin³α - cos³α = n*(3 - n²)/2 = (3n - n³)/2. Let me check if this makes sense. Suppose n is 0, then sinα - cosα = 0, so sinα = cosα. Then sin³α - cos³α would be 0, which matches (3*0 - 0)/2 = 0. If n is 1, sinα - cosα = 1. The maximum value of sinα - cosα is sqrt(2) (since it&#39;s equivalent to sqrt(2) sin(α - 45°)), so n can&#39;t be 1. Wait, but maybe the problem allows n to be any real number? Wait, actually, sinα - cosα can range between -sqrt(2) and sqrt(2). So if n is within that range, then the expression (3n - n³)/2 is valid. Let me take another test case. Let&#39;s say α = 45°, then sin45 = cos45 = √2/2. So sinα - cosα = 0, which is n = 0. Then sin³α - cos³α is 0, which matches. Another example, suppose α = 0°, then sin0 = 0, cos0 = 1. So sinα - cosα = -1. Then according to the formula, (3*(-1) - (-1)^3)/2 = (-3 +1)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Let&#39;s compute sin³0 - cos³0 = 0 - 1 = -1, which matches. Another test case: α = 90°, sin90 = 1, cos90 = 0. So sinα - cosα = 1 - 0 = 1. So n = 1. Then according to the formula, (3*1 -1^3)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. And sin³90 - cos³90 = 1 - 0 = 1. That works. Hmm, so the formula seems to hold for these test cases. Therefore, I think the answer is (3n - n³)/2. So boxed, that&#39;s boxed{dfrac{3n - n^3}{2}}.Final AnswerThe value of sin ^{3} alpha - cos ^{3} alpha is boxed{dfrac{3n - n^3}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that (sin alpha - cos alpha = n), we need to find (sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha).We use the algebraic identity for the difference of cubes:[a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)]Let (a = sin alpha) and (b = cos alpha). Then,[sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha = (sin alpha - cos alpha)(sin^2 alpha + sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha)]We know (sin alpha - cos alpha = n), and using the Pythagorean identity (sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1), we get:[sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1]Thus,[sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha = n(1 + sin alpha cos alpha)]Next, we need to find (sin alpha cos alpha). Squaring both sides of the given equation (sin alpha - cos alpha = n):[(sin alpha - cos alpha)^2 = n^2][sin^2 alpha - 2 sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha = n^2]Using the Pythagorean identity again:[1 - 2 sin alpha cos alpha = n^2]Solving for (sin alpha cos alpha):[-2 sin alpha cos alpha = n^2 - 1][sin alpha cos alpha = frac{1 - n^2}{2}]Substituting this back into the expression for (sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha):[sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha = n left(1 + frac{1 - n^2}{2}right)]Simplifying inside the parentheses:[1 + frac{1 - n^2}{2} = frac{2}{2} + frac{1 - n^2}{2} = frac{2 + 1 - n^2}{2} = frac{3 - n^2}{2}]Thus,[sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha = n cdot frac{3 - n^2}{2} = frac{3n - n^3}{2}]The value of (sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha) is boxed{dfrac{3n - n^3}{2}}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find sin³α - cos³α given that sinα - cosα = n. Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that there are some algebraic identities for cubes, right? Like the difference of cubes formula. Maybe I can apply that here. The formula for a³ - b³ is (a - b)(a² + ab + b²). So if I let a = sinα and b = cosα, then sin³α - cos³α would be (sinα - cosα)(sin²α + sinα cosα + cos²α). Wait, that seems right. And they already told us that sinα - cosα = n, so that part is taken care of. Then the other factor is sin²α + sinα cosα + cos²α. I know that sin²α + cos²α = 1, that&#39;s the Pythagorean identity. So this simplifies to 1 + sinα cosα. So the entire expression becomes n*(1 + sinα cosα). But now I need to figure out what sinα cosα is in terms of n. Because the problem gives me sinα - cosα = n, so I need to relate sinα cosα to n somehow. Let me think. If I square both sides of the given equation, maybe that will help. So, starting with (sinα - cosα)² = n². Expanding the left side, that&#39;s sin²α - 2 sinα cosα + cos²α. Again, using the Pythagorean identity, sin²α + cos²α = 1, so this becomes 1 - 2 sinα cosα = n². Then, rearranging that equation to solve for sinα cosα. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives -2 sinα cosα = n² - 1. Then dividing both sides by -2, we get sinα cosα = (1 - n²)/2. Oh, that&#39;s perfect. So now I can substitute this back into the expression we had earlier. The original expression was n*(1 + sinα cosα). Substituting sinα cosα gives us n*(1 + (1 - n²)/2). Let&#39;s compute that. First, inside the parentheses: 1 + (1 - n²)/2. To combine these, convert 1 to 2/2, so we have 2/2 + (1 - n²)/2 = (2 + 1 - n²)/2 = (3 - n²)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is n*(3 - n²)/2. So sin³α - cos³α = (n(3 - n²))/2. Wait, let me check that again. Starting from the beginning: difference of cubes gives (sinα - cosα)(sin²α + sinα cosα + cos²α). Then sin²α + cos²α is 1, so that becomes (sinα - cosα)(1 + sinα cosα). Then sinα - cosα is n, so n*(1 + sinα cosα). Then squared the original equation: (sinα - cosα)^2 = n^2 =&gt; sin²α - 2 sinα cosα + cos²α = n^2 =&gt; 1 - 2 sinα cosα = n^2 =&gt; sinα cosα = (1 - n²)/2. Then substituting back gives n*(1 + (1 - n²)/2) = n*( (2 + 1 - n²)/2 ) = n*(3 - n²)/2. Yeah, that seems right. So the final answer should be (n(3 - n²))/2. Let me write that in a box. Final Answerboxed{dfrac{n(3 - n^2)}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given that (sin alpha - cos alpha = n), we need to find (sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha).We use the identity for the difference of cubes:[sin^3 alpha - cos^3 alpha = (sin alpha - cos alpha)(sin^2 alpha + sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha)]We know (sin alpha - cos alpha = n). Next, we simplify (sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha) using the Pythagorean identity:[sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1]Thus, the expression becomes:[(sin alpha - cos alpha)(1 + sin alpha cos alpha)]We need to find (sin alpha cos alpha). Squaring both sides of the given equation (sin alpha - cos alpha = n):[(sin alpha - cos alpha)^2 = n^2][sin^2 alpha - 2 sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha = n^2][1 - 2 sin alpha cos alpha = n^2]Solving for (sin alpha cos alpha):[-2 sin alpha cos alpha = n^2 - 1][sin alpha cos alpha = frac{1 - n^2}{2}]Substituting this back into the expression:[n left(1 + frac{1 - n^2}{2}right)]Simplifying inside the parentheses:[1 + frac{1 - n^2}{2} = frac{2 + 1 - n^2}{2} = frac{3 - n^2}{2}]Thus, the final expression is:[n cdot frac{3 - n^2}{2} = frac{n(3 - n^2)}{2}]The final answer is:[boxed{dfrac{n(3 - n^2)}{2}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e7dc6219></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>🔑:</span>4.86 Instruction.

First, I need to recall some properties of ellipses. The problem mentions an ellipse Γ with vertices A and B on the major axis, foci E and F, the distance between A and B is 4, the distance from A to F is 2 + √3, and there&#39;s a point P on the ellipse such that the product of the distances from P to each focus, |PE| · |PF|, is 2. We need to find the area of triangle PEF.First, let me note down the given information:1. The major axis length |AB| = 4. Since the major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse, the semi-major axis length &#39;a&#39; is half of that, so a = 2.2. The distance from vertex A to focus F is |AF| = 2 + √3. Since in an ellipse, the distance from a vertex to a focus is a - c, where c is the distance from the center to a focus. Wait, hold on. Let me confirm that. If the ellipse is centered at the origin, then vertices are at (±a, 0), and foci are at (±c, 0). So the distance from vertex (a, 0) to focus (c, 0) is |a - c|. But since a &gt; c, it&#39;s a - c. So given that |AF| = 2 + √3, but wait, a is 2. So 2 - c = 2 + √3? That would make c negative, which doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Maybe I have the direction wrong.Wait, perhaps the foci are on the major axis, which is AB. So if A and B are the vertices, then the major axis is from A to B with length 4, so the center is the midpoint of AB. Let&#39;s call the center O. Then AO = OB = 2. The distance from A to focus F is given as 2 + √3. If the center is O, then the foci are located at a distance c from the center. So if F is one focus, then OF = c. So the distance from A to F would be AO - OF if F is on the same side as B. Wait, maybe A and B are the two ends of the major axis. Let me visualize: if A is the left vertex and B is the right vertex, then the center O is in the middle. The foci E and F are located at a distance c from the center, so they are at O ± c. If F is the right focus, then the distance from A to F would be AO + OF, since A is at -a (assuming center at origin) and F is at +c. So AO is 2, and OF is c. Therefore, |AF| = AO + OF = 2 + c. The problem says |AF| = 2 + √3. Therefore, 2 + c = 2 + √3 ⇒ c = √3.So that gives c = √3. Then, in an ellipse, we have the relationship a² = b² + c², where b is the semi-minor axis. So since a = 2 and c = √3, we can find b.Calculating b: a² = 4, c² = 3, so b² = a² - c² = 4 - 3 = 1 ⇒ b = 1. So the semi-minor axis is 1.Therefore, the ellipse has semi-major axis 2, semi-minor axis 1, centered at O, with foci at (±√3, 0) if we place the major axis along the x-axis. Let&#39;s assume the coordinate system is such that the center O is at the origin, the major axis is along the x-axis, so vertices A and B are at (-2, 0) and (2, 0), and foci E and F are at (-√3, 0) and (√3, 0). Then, |AF| is the distance from A (-2, 0) to F (√3, 0), which is √3 - (-2) = √3 + 2, which matches the given |AF| = 2 + √3. That checks out.Now, point P is on the ellipse Γ, and |PE| · |PF| = 2. We need to find the area of triangle PEF.First, let&#39;s note that E and F are the foci, located at (-√3, 0) and (√3, 0). So the distance between E and F is 2√3. The triangle PEF has vertices at E, F, and P. The area of triangle PEF can be calculated if we know the coordinates of P, or perhaps using some properties of the ellipse.But since P is a point on the ellipse, we can use coordinates to parameterize P. Let&#39;s parametrize the ellipse. Since the ellipse is centered at the origin with major axis along the x-axis, the standard parametric equations are:x = a cos θ = 2 cos θy = b sin θ = 1 sin θSo P can be represented as (2 cos θ, sin θ) for some angle θ.Now, we need to compute |PE| and |PF|. Let&#39;s write expressions for these distances.First, coordinates of E: (-√3, 0)Coordinates of F: (√3, 0)Coordinates of P: (2 cos θ, sin θ)Compute |PE|: distance between P and E.|PE| = √[(2 cos θ + √3)^2 + (sin θ - 0)^2]Similarly, |PF| = √[(2 cos θ - √3)^2 + (sin θ)^2]The product |PE| · |PF| is given as 2. Let&#39;s compute this product.First, compute |PE|² and |PF|², perhaps multiply them and take square root? Hmm.Alternatively, expand the product |PE| · |PF|.Let me compute |PE| · |PF|:= √[(2 cos θ + √3)^2 + sin² θ] × √[(2 cos θ - √3)^2 + sin² θ]Let me square this product to make it easier:(|PE| · |PF|)^2 = [(2 cos θ + √3)^2 + sin² θ] × [(2 cos θ - √3)^2 + sin² θ]This looks complicated, but maybe we can simplify it.First, expand each bracket.First bracket:(2 cos θ + √3)^2 + sin² θ = 4 cos² θ + 4√3 cos θ + 3 + sin² θSecond bracket:(2 cos θ - √3)^2 + sin² θ = 4 cos² θ - 4√3 cos θ + 3 + sin² θSo, the product becomes:[4 cos² θ + 4√3 cos θ + 3 + sin² θ] × [4 cos² θ - 4√3 cos θ + 3 + sin² θ]Notice that the two brackets are of the form (A + B)(A - B) where A = 4 cos² θ + 3 + sin² θ and B = 4√3 cos θ. Therefore, the product is A² - B².So, let&#39;s compute A and B:A = 4 cos² θ + 3 + sin² θ = (4 cos² θ + sin² θ) + 3Note that sin² θ = 1 - cos² θ, so substituting:A = 4 cos² θ + (1 - cos² θ) + 3 = 3 cos² θ + 4Similarly, B = 4√3 cos θTherefore, the product becomes:(A)² - (B)² = (3 cos² θ + 4)^2 - (4√3 cos θ)^2Let me expand this:First term: (3 cos² θ + 4)^2 = 9 cos⁴ θ + 24 cos² θ + 16Second term: (4√3 cos θ)^2 = 16 * 3 cos² θ = 48 cos² θSubtracting the second term from the first:9 cos⁴ θ + 24 cos² θ + 16 - 48 cos² θ = 9 cos⁴ θ - 24 cos² θ + 16Therefore, (|PE| · |PF|)^2 = 9 cos⁴ θ - 24 cos² θ + 16But we know that |PE| · |PF| = 2, so squaring gives 4. Therefore:9 cos⁴ θ - 24 cos² θ + 16 = 4Subtract 4:9 cos⁴ θ - 24 cos² θ + 12 = 0Divide both sides by 3:3 cos⁴ θ - 8 cos² θ + 4 = 0Let me set u = cos² θ, so the equation becomes:3u² - 8u + 4 = 0Solving this quadratic equation:u = [8 ± √(64 - 48)] / 6 = [8 ± √16]/6 = [8 ± 4]/6Therefore:u = (8 + 4)/6 = 12/6 = 2or u = (8 - 4)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3But u = cos² θ, so cos² θ cannot be 2 because the maximum value of cos² θ is 1. So reject u = 2. Therefore, cos² θ = 2/3 ⇒ cos θ = ±√(2/3) = ±(√6)/3Therefore, θ corresponds to angles where cos θ = ±√6/3. Let&#39;s note that sin θ = ±√(1 - cos² θ) = ±√(1 - 2/3) = ±√(1/3) = ±1/√3.Therefore, the coordinates of point P are:x = 2 cos θ = 2*(±√6/3) = ±2√6/3y = sin θ = ±1/√3But since θ can be in any quadrant, but we need to consider all possibilities. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify the position of P, just that it&#39;s on the ellipse. So there might be multiple such points P, but the area of triangle PEF might be the same for all such points due to symmetry.Wait, let&#39;s check. Let&#39;s suppose cos θ = √6/3, then sin θ can be +1/√3 or -1/√3. Similarly, if cos θ = -√6/3, sin θ can be +1/√3 or -1/√3. So there are four possible points P. Let&#39;s check if they all give the same area.But since the area is absolute, maybe positive and negative y-values would give the same area. Let me see.First, let&#39;s compute coordinates of E and F: E is (-√3, 0), F is (√3, 0). So the base of triangle PEF is EF, which has length 2√3. The height would be the distance from point P to the line EF. Since EF is on the x-axis, the height is just the absolute y-coordinate of P. Therefore, the area of triangle PEF is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*(2√3)*|y| = √3 * |y|.Since y = ±1/√3, |y| = 1/√3. Therefore, the area is √3*(1/√3) = 1.Wait, so regardless of which point P we take (with the given product of distances), the y-coordinate magnitude is 1/√3, so the area is 1. Is that right?Wait, let&#39;s confirm this. Let me check with coordinates.Suppose P is (2√6/3, 1/√3). Then, the coordinates of E, F, and P are:E: (-√3, 0), F: (√3, 0), P: (2√6/3, 1/√3)The area of triangle PEF can be calculated using the shoelace formula or determinant formula.Let me use the determinant formula:Area = (1/2)| (x_P(y_E - y_F) + x_E(y_F - y_P) + x_F(y_P - y_E)) |But y_E = y_F = 0, so simplifies:Area = (1/2)|x_P(0 - 0) + x_E(0 - y_P) + x_F(y_P - 0)|= (1/2)|0 + x_E*(-y_P) + x_F*y_P|= (1/2)| -x_E y_P + x_F y_P |= (1/2)| y_P (x_F - x_E ) |But x_F - x_E = √3 - (-√3) = 2√3Therefore, Area = (1/2)| y_P * 2√3 | = |y_P| * √3Which is the same as I had before. Since |y_P| = 1/√3, Area = √3*(1/√3) = 1. So yes, the area is 1.But wait, let&#39;s confirm that with the coordinates. Let me take P as (2√6/3, 1/√3):Compute the vectors PE and PF. Wait, but maybe the base EF is 2√3, and the height is the vertical distance from P to EF (the x-axis), which is |y_P| = 1/√3. Therefore, area is (1/2)*2√3*(1/√3) = 1. Correct.Alternatively, if I take P with coordinates (-2√6/3, 1/√3), the y-coordinate is still 1/√3, so the area would be the same. Similarly, if y is negative, absolute value still gives 1/√3. Therefore, regardless of the position of P, the area is 1.But let me verify this with another approach. Let&#39;s recall that in an ellipse, the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant, which is 2a = 4 in this case. So |PE| + |PF| = 4.But we also know that |PE| · |PF| = 2. So we have two equations:|PE| + |PF| = 4|PE| · |PF| = 2Let me denote |PE| = m and |PF| = n. Then m + n = 4 and mn = 2. Then, we can solve for m and n.From m + n = 4 and mn = 2, the quadratic equation is x² - 4x + 2 = 0. Solving this:x = [4 ± √(16 - 8)]/2 = [4 ± √8]/2 = [4 ± 2√2]/2 = 2 ± √2Therefore, |PE| and |PF| are 2 + √2 and 2 - √2. But wait, in our previous parametrization, we found that |PE| · |PF| = 2, but according to the sum, they should add to 4 and multiply to 2, which gives these values. But how does that relate to the coordinates?But in our earlier calculation, we found that the y-coordinate of P is ±1/√3, leading to an area of 1. However, perhaps we can use another approach to compute the area. Let&#39;s use coordinates.Given that E is (-√3, 0) and F is (√3, 0). Let P be (x, y) on the ellipse. The area of triangle PEF is (1/2)*|EF|*|y|, as EF is the base along the x-axis and y is the height.Since |EF| = 2√3, then area = (1/2)*(2√3)*|y| = √3 |y|. So the area is √3 |y|.But we need to find |y|. Since P is on the ellipse, the equation of the ellipse is (x²)/a² + (y²)/b² = 1. Here, a = 2, b = 1, so (x²)/4 + y² = 1.So, if we can find y, then we can compute the area. But how do we relate |PE| · |PF| = 2 to y?Let me compute |PE| and |PF| in terms of x and y. Since E is (-√3, 0), F is (√3, 0):|PE| = √[(x + √3)^2 + y²]|PF| = √[(x - √3)^2 + y²]Therefore, |PE| · |PF| = √[(x + √3)^2 + y²] * √[(x - √3)^2 + y²] = 2Square both sides:[(x + √3)^2 + y²][(x - √3)^2 + y²] = 4Let me expand this product.First, expand each bracket:First bracket: (x + √3)^2 + y² = x² + 2√3 x + 3 + y²Second bracket: (x - √3)^2 + y² = x² - 2√3 x + 3 + y²Multiply them together:(x² + 2√3 x + 3 + y²)(x² - 2√3 x + 3 + y²)Again, this is of the form (A + B)(A - B) where A = x² + 3 + y² and B = 2√3 x. Therefore, the product is A² - B².Compute A and B:A = x² + y² + 3B = 2√3 xTherefore, the product becomes:(A)^2 - (B)^2 = (x² + y² + 3)^2 - (2√3 x)^2Expand this:(x² + y² + 3)^2 - 12 x²First expand (x² + y² + 3)^2:= x^4 + 2x² y² + y^4 + 6x² + 6y² + 9Then subtract 12x²:= x^4 + 2x² y² + y^4 + 6x² + 6y² + 9 - 12x²Simplify:x^4 + 2x² y² + y^4 - 6x² + 6y² + 9But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the ellipse equation to substitute.From the ellipse equation, (x²)/4 + y² = 1 ⇒ x² = 4(1 - y²). Let&#39;s substitute x² = 4(1 - y²) into the equation.So, first, compute A = x² + y² + 3 = 4(1 - y²) + y² + 3 = 4 - 4y² + y² + 3 = 7 - 3y²B = 2√3 xTherefore, A² - B² = (7 - 3y²)^2 - (2√3 x)^2 = 49 - 42y² + 9y^4 - 12x²But again, substitute x² = 4(1 - y²):= 49 - 42y² + 9y^4 - 12*4(1 - y²) = 49 - 42y² + 9y^4 - 48 + 48y²Simplify:= (49 - 48) + (-42y² + 48y²) + 9y^4= 1 + 6y² + 9y^4Therefore, we have:1 + 6y² + 9y^4 = 4So:9y^4 + 6y² + 1 - 4 = 0 ⇒ 9y^4 + 6y² - 3 = 0Divide by 3:3y^4 + 2y² - 1 = 0Let me set z = y², so equation becomes:3z² + 2z - 1 = 0Solving quadratic equation:z = [-2 ± √(4 + 12)] / 6 = [-2 ± √16]/6 = [-2 ± 4]/6Therefore:z = (-2 + 4)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3or z = (-2 - 4)/6 = -6/6 = -1But z = y² cannot be negative, so z = 1/3 ⇒ y² = 1/3 ⇒ y = ±1/√3Therefore, |y| = 1/√3, which gives the area as √3 * (1/√3) = 1. So the area is indeed 1.Therefore, regardless of the coordinates of P (as long as |PE| · |PF| = 2), the y-coordinate of P is ±1/√3, leading to an area of 1.Therefore, the answer is 1. Let me check again to make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything.Wait, but when we parametrized P as (2 cos θ, sin θ), we found that cos² θ = 2/3, so cos θ = ±√6/3, leading to x = ±2√6/3, and y = ±1/√3, which gives the same result. So the area is indeed 1. So I think that&#39;s the answer.Final Answerboxed{1}&lt;/think&gt;Given an ellipse (Gamma) with vertices (A) and (B) on the major axis, foci (E) and (F), and a point (P) on (Gamma) such that (|PE| cdot |PF| = 2), we need to find the area of (triangle PEF).1. Ellipse Properties:   - The length of the major axis (|AB| = 4), so the semi-major axis (a = 2).   - The distance from vertex (A) to focus (F) is (|AF| = 2 + sqrt{3}). Since the distance from a vertex to a focus is (a - c), we have (2 + sqrt{3} = 2 + c), giving (c = sqrt{3}).   - The semi-minor axis (b) is calculated using (a^2 = b^2 + c^2): (4 = b^2 + 3 Rightarrow b = 1).2. Coordinates of Foci:   - The foci (E) and (F) are located at ((- sqrt{3}, 0)) and ((sqrt{3}, 0)).3. Point (P) on the Ellipse:   - Parametrize (P) as ((2 cos theta, sin theta)).   - Calculate (|PE|) and (|PF|):     [     |PE| = sqrt{(2 cos theta + sqrt{3})^2 + sin^2 theta}     ]     [     |PF| = sqrt{(2 cos theta - sqrt{3})^2 + sin^2 theta}     ]   - Given (|PE| cdot |PF| = 2), solving this product leads to the quadratic equation in (cos^2 theta), resulting in (cos^2 theta = frac{2}{3}) and (sin theta = pm frac{1}{sqrt{3}}).4. Area Calculation:   - The coordinates of (P) are ((pm frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}, pm frac{1}{sqrt{3}})).   - The area of (triangle PEF) is calculated using the base (|EF| = 2sqrt{3}) and height (|y| = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}):     [     text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{3} times frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = 1     ]Thus, the area of (triangle PEF) is (boxed{1}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about an ellipse. Let me recall what I know about ellipses. An ellipse is defined as the set of points where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant. The major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse, passing through the two farthest points (vertices) A and B. The distance between A and B is given as 4, so the length of the major axis is 4, which means the semi-major axis (a) is half of that, so a = 2.Now, the foci of the ellipse, E and F, are located along the major axis at a distance of c from the center, where c is the focal distance. The relationship between a, b (semi-minor axis), and c is given by c² = a² - b². So if I can find c, I can find b, but maybe I won&#39;t need b directly here.We are also told that |AF| = 2 + √3. Since A is a vertex of the major axis and F is one of the foci, let me visualize this. If the center of the ellipse is O, then OA = a = 2. The distance from A to F is given as 2 + √3. Since F is a focus, it&#39;s located at a distance c from the center. So depending on which focus F is, the distance from A to F would be either a + c or a - c. But since A is a vertex on the major axis, and F is a focus, if F is on the same side as B, then the distance from A to F would be AB - (distance from B to F). Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.Let me consider the standard ellipse centered at the origin. Suppose the major axis is along the x-axis. Then the vertices are at (±a, 0). The foci are at (±c, 0). If A is (a, 0) and F is (c, 0), then the distance AF is |a - c|. Similarly, if F were (-c, 0), the distance AF would be a + c. But since the problem says |AF| = 2 + √3, and a is 2, then |AF| can be either a - c or a + c. Let&#39;s check both possibilities.If |AF| = a + c = 2 + c = 2 + √3, then c = √3. Alternatively, if |AF| = a - c = 2 - c = 2 + √3, that would imply c = -√3, which doesn&#39;t make sense since c is a positive distance. Therefore, we must have |AF| = a + c = 2 + c = 2 + √3, so c = √3. Therefore, the foci are located at a distance of √3 from the center along the major axis.So now we know a = 2, c = √3, so we can find b. Since c² = a² - b², substituting the values:(√3)² = 2² - b²  3 = 4 - b²  b² = 4 - 3 = 1  Therefore, b = 1. So the semi-minor axis is 1.Now, the problem introduces a point P on the ellipse such that the product |PE| · |PF| = 2. We need to find the area of triangle PEF.First, let me note that E and F are the two foci, located at (-√3, 0) and (√3, 0) if the ellipse is centered at the origin along the x-axis. So coordinates of E and F would be (-c, 0) and (c, 0), which is (-√3, 0) and (√3, 0).So point P is somewhere on the ellipse, and we need to compute the product of its distances to E and F, which is given as 2. Then find the area of triangle PEF.First, maybe it&#39;s helpful to parametrize the ellipse. The standard parametric equations for an ellipse centered at the origin are x = a cosθ, y = b sinθ. Since a = 2 and b = 1, the parametric coordinates for P would be (2 cosθ, sinθ).Then, coordinates of E: (-√3, 0), coordinates of F: (√3, 0).Compute |PE| and |PF|. Let&#39;s denote P as (2 cosθ, sinθ). Then:Distance PE: sqrt[(2 cosθ + √3)^2 + (sinθ - 0)^2]  Distance PF: sqrt[(2 cosθ - √3)^2 + (sinθ - 0)^2]Compute the product |PE| · |PF|:sqrt[(2 cosθ + √3)^2 + sin²θ] * sqrt[(2 cosθ - √3)^2 + sin²θ]This looks complicated, but maybe there&#39;s a way to simplify it. Let me compute each term inside the square roots first.For PE: (2 cosθ + √3)^2 + sin²θ  = 4 cos²θ + 4√3 cosθ + 3 + sin²θ  = (4 cos²θ + sin²θ) + 4√3 cosθ + 3Similarly for PF: (2 cosθ - √3)^2 + sin²θ  = 4 cos²θ - 4√3 cosθ + 3 + sin²θ  = (4 cos²θ + sin²θ) - 4√3 cosθ + 3Note that 4 cos²θ + sin²θ can be written as 3 cos²θ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 3 cos²θ + 1Therefore, substituting back:PE² = 3 cos²θ + 1 + 4√3 cosθ + 3 = 3 cos²θ + 4√3 cosθ + 4  PF² = 3 cos²θ + 1 - 4√3 cosθ + 3 = 3 cos²θ - 4√3 cosθ + 4Now, the product |PE| · |PF| is sqrt(PE² * PF²) = sqrt{(3 cos²θ + 4√3 cosθ + 4)(3 cos²θ - 4√3 cosθ + 4)}Let me compute this product inside the square root. Let me set u = 3 cos²θ and v = 4√3 cosθ. Then the expression becomes (u + v + 4)(u - v + 4). Which is equal to (u + 4)^2 - v².Expanding that:(u + 4)^2 - v² = u² + 8u + 16 - v²Substituting back u = 3 cos²θ and v = 4√3 cosθ:= (9 cos^4θ) + 8*(3 cos²θ) + 16 - (16*3 cos²θ)  = 9 cos^4θ + 24 cos²θ + 16 - 48 cos²θ  = 9 cos^4θ - 24 cos²θ + 16So the product |PE| · |PF| = sqrt(9 cos^4θ - 24 cos²θ + 16)But this is supposed to equal 2. Therefore:sqrt(9 cos^4θ - 24 cos²θ + 16) = 2  Squaring both sides:  9 cos^4θ - 24 cos²θ + 16 = 4  Therefore:  9 cos^4θ - 24 cos²θ + 12 = 0  Divide both sides by 3:  3 cos^4θ - 8 cos²θ + 4 = 0Let me set x = cos²θ. Then the equation becomes:  3x² - 8x + 4 = 0  Solve for x:  x = [8 ± sqrt(64 - 48)] / 6  = [8 ± sqrt(16)] / 6  = [8 ± 4] / 6  So x = (8 + 4)/6 = 12/6 = 2, or x = (8 - 4)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3But x = cos²θ must be between 0 and 1, so x = 2 is invalid. Therefore, x = 2/3, so cos²θ = 2/3, which implies cosθ = ±√(2/3) = ±(√6)/3Therefore, θ corresponds to angles where cosine is ±√6/3. Let me note that.So cosθ = ±√6/3, so sinθ = sqrt(1 - (2/3)) = sqrt(1/3) = ±1/√3. But since sinθ can be positive or negative, depending on the quadrant. However, since the ellipse is symmetric, the area might be the same regardless of the sign. Let me check.So coordinates of P are (2 cosθ, sinθ). So if cosθ = √6/3, then x-coordinate is 2*(√6/3) = 2√6/3, and y-coordinate is ±1/√3. Similarly, if cosθ = -√6/3, x-coordinate is -2√6/3, y-coordinate is ±1/√3.But since E and F are on the x-axis, the triangle PEF will have coordinates E(-√3, 0), F(√3, 0), and P(2√6/3, ±1/√3) or P(-2√6/3, ±1/√3). However, due to symmetry, the area should be the same whether P is in the upper or lower half, or left or right. Let&#39;s pick one, say P(2√6/3, 1/√3).Now, to compute the area of triangle PEF. The coordinates are E(-√3, 0), F(√3, 0), and P(2√6/3, 1/√3). Let&#39;s compute the area.One formula for the area of a triangle given three vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:Area = (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |Plugging in E(-√3,0), F(√3,0), P(2√6/3,1/√3):Area = (1/2)| (-√3)(0 - 1/√3) + √3(1/√3 - 0) + (2√6/3)(0 - 0) |Simplify each term:First term: (-√3)( -1/√3 ) = (-√3)( -1/√3 ) = (√3)(1/√3) = 1  Second term: √3(1/√3 - 0) = √3*(1/√3) = 1  Third term: (2√6/3)(0 - 0) = 0So sum is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. Then area = (1/2)|2| = 1.Alternatively, since E and F are on the x-axis, the base of the triangle is the distance between E and F, which is 2√3. The height is the y-coordinate of P, since the height from P to the base EF (which is along the x-axis) is just |y|.So area = (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*(2√3)*(1/√3) = (1/2)*(2√3)*(1/√3) = (1/2)*(2/√3)*√3 = (1/2)*2 = 1.Either way, the area is 1.Wait, but before I conclude, let me check if this is consistent with all possible positions of P. Let me take another P, say P(-2√6/3, 1/√3). Then the coordinates would be E(-√3,0), F(√3,0), P(-2√6/3,1/√3). The area calculation would be similar. The base is still 2√3, the height is still 1/√3, so area is still 1. Similarly, if the y-coordinate is negative, the absolute value makes the height the same, so area is still 1. Therefore, regardless of the position of P, as long as |PE|·|PF| = 2, the area of triangle PEF is 1.But wait, let me verify whether this answer makes sense. Let me check the steps again.We had |PE|·|PF| = 2, leading us to solve for cosθ and found that cosθ = ±√6/3. Then, with that, the y-coordinate of P is ±1/√3. Then, the area is 1. That seems consistent.But maybe there&#39;s another way to approach this problem, perhaps using properties of ellipses or triangles.Alternatively, recall that in an ellipse, the sum |PE| + |PF| is constant and equal to 2a = 4. Wait, but here we are dealing with the product |PE|·|PF| = 2. Maybe we can use the arithmetic mean - geometric mean inequality or something else? But since the sum is 4 and the product is 2, maybe we can set up equations.Let me denote |PE| = x, |PF| = y. Then x * y = 2 and x + y = 4 (since for any point on the ellipse, the sum of distances to the foci is 2a = 4). So solving these equations:x + y = 4  x * y = 2Then, from these, we can write quadratic equation: t² - 4t + 2 = 0  Solutions are t = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 8)]/2 = [4 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = [4 ± 2√2]/2 = 2 ± √2Therefore, |PE| and |PF| are 2 + √2 and 2 - √2. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier parametrization where we found coordinates leading to the area of 1. Wait, maybe not. Wait, but if we think that for any point P on the ellipse, |PE| + |PF| = 4, and the product |PE|·|PF| = 2, then solving gives |PE| and |PF| as 2 ± √2. Then, using these distances, maybe we can compute the area of triangle PEF.But how?Alternatively, using coordinates. If we have E(-√3, 0), F(√3, 0), and P(x,y) on the ellipse. The area of triangle PEF can be calculated as (1/2)*EF*height, where EF is the distance between E and F, which is 2√3, and the height is the distance from P to the line EF (which is the x-axis), so height is |y|. Therefore, area = (1/2)*2√3*|y| = √3*|y|. Therefore, if the area is 1, then √3*|y| = 1 =&gt; |y| = 1/√3, which matches our previous result where y = ±1/√3. So that&#39;s consistent.But then, how does this relate to the product |PE|·|PF| = 2? Let me check.Given that |PE|·|PF| = 2, and |PE| + |PF| = 4, we can compute |PE| and |PF| as 2 ± √2. Let&#39;s verify with coordinates.If P is (2√6/3, 1/√3), compute |PE| and |PF|.Coordinates of E(-√3,0), F(√3,0), P(2√6/3,1/√3).Compute |PE|:sqrt[(2√6/3 + √3)^2 + (1/√3 - 0)^2]First, simplify 2√6/3 + √3. Let&#39;s write √3 as √3/1. To add these, find a common denominator:2√6/3 + √3 = 2√6/3 + 3√3/3 = (2√6 + 3√3)/3Similarly, the y-component is 1/√3.Therefore, |PE|² = [(2√6 + 3√3)/3]^2 + (1/√3)^2Let me compute this:First, expand the x-component squared:[(2√6 + 3√3)/3]^2 = [ (2√6)^2 + 2*(2√6)*(3√3) + (3√3)^2 ] / 9  = [ 24 + 12√18 + 27 ] / 9  Simplify √18 = 3√2, so 12√18 = 12*3√2 = 36√2  Therefore, numerator: 24 + 27 + 36√2 = 51 + 36√2  So |PE|² = (51 + 36√2)/9 + (1/3)  = (51 + 36√2)/9 + 3/9  = (54 + 36√2)/9  = 6 + 4√2  Therefore, |PE| = sqrt(6 + 4√2)Similarly, compute |PF|:sqrt[(2√6/3 - √3)^2 + (1/√3)^2]Again, 2√6/3 - √3 = 2√6/3 - 3√3/3 = (2√6 - 3√3)/3Compute |PF|²:[(2√6 - 3√3)/3]^2 + (1/√3)^2  Expand the x-component squared:[ (2√6)^2 - 2*(2√6)*(3√3) + (3√3)^2 ] / 9  = [ 24 - 12√18 + 27 ] / 9  Again, 12√18 = 36√2  Numerator: 24 + 27 - 36√2 = 51 - 36√2  So |PF|² = (51 - 36√2)/9 + 1/3  = (51 - 36√2)/9 + 3/9  = (54 - 36√2)/9  = 6 - 4√2  Thus, |PF| = sqrt(6 - 4√2)Now, let&#39;s compute |PE| * |PF|:sqrt(6 + 4√2) * sqrt(6 - 4√2)  = sqrt[(6 + 4√2)(6 - 4√2)]  = sqrt[36 - (4√2)^2]  = sqrt[36 - 32]  = sqrt[4]  = 2Which matches the given product |PE|·|PF| = 2. So this checks out.Moreover, |PE| and |PF| are sqrt(6 + 4√2) and sqrt(6 - 4√2). Let&#39;s approximate these to check if they sum to 4.sqrt(6 + 4√2) ≈ sqrt(6 + 5.656) ≈ sqrt(11.656) ≈ 3.414  sqrt(6 - 4√2) ≈ sqrt(6 - 5.656) ≈ sqrt(0.344) ≈ 0.586  Sum ≈ 3.414 + 0.586 ≈ 4.0, which matches 2a = 4. So that works.Therefore, all the steps check out, and the area of triangle PEF is indeed 1. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{1}Final Answerboxed{1}&lt;/think&gt;Given an ellipse (Gamma) with vertices (A) and (B) on the major axis, where (|AB| = 4), the semi-major axis (a = 2). The foci (E) and (F) are such that (|AF| = 2 + sqrt{3}). This distance implies the focal distance (c = sqrt{3}). Using the relationship (c^2 = a^2 - b^2), we find the semi-minor axis (b = 1).For a point (P) on the ellipse, the product of distances to the foci (|PE| cdot |PF| = 2). We need to find the area of (triangle PEF).Parametrizing the ellipse as (P(2 cos theta, sin theta)), we compute the distances (|PE|) and (|PF|):[|PE| = sqrt{(2 cos theta + sqrt{3})^2 + sin^2 theta}][|PF| = sqrt{(2 cos theta - sqrt{3})^2 + sin^2 theta}]Given (|PE| cdot |PF| = 2), solving the resulting equation leads to (cos^2 theta = frac{2}{3}) and (sin theta = pm frac{1}{sqrt{3}}). The coordinates of (P) are (left(pm frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}, pm frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)).The area of (triangle PEF) is calculated using the base (EF = 2sqrt{3}) and height (|y| = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}):[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{3} times frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = 1]Thus, the area of (triangle PEF) is (boxed{1}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e7dc6219></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>🔑:</span>Answer: 1.Solution: Let&#39;s assume the standard equation of Gamma in the Cartesian coordinate system is frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a&gt;b&gt;0).

The answer choices are given, and I need to determine which set is possible. Hmm, okay. So, first, I remember that when two planes intersect, they form a line, right? So, if we have multiple planes, each pair can potentially intersect in a line. But of course, if planes are parallel, they don&#39;t intersect, so that reduces the number of lines. Also, if three or more planes intersect along the same line, that might affect the total count too. Let me start breaking this down step by step.First, the maximum number of intersection lines. If all four planes are in general position, meaning no two are parallel and no three intersect along the same line, then each pair of planes intersects in a distinct line. The number of pairs of planes is C(4,2) = 6. So, in that case, there are 6 intersection lines. That&#39;s the maximum possible, right? So 6 is definitely in the set. Looking at the options, all the answer choices except maybe some include 6. So that&#39;s a start.Now, what&#39;s the minimum number of intersection lines possible? If all four planes are parallel, then none of them intersect, so the number of intersection lines would be 0. But wait, is that possible? Wait, four parallel planes... but the problem says &quot;different planes.&quot; So, if they are all parallel, they are different but non-intersecting. So, yes, that gives 0 lines. So 0 is possible. Let&#39;s check the answer options. Option B, C, D include 0. Option A doesn&#39;t, so A is out. But wait, the answer choices might not all have 0. Wait, the problem says &quot;the set of possible numbers of intersection lines formed by these four planes.&quot; So, are there configurations where you get 0 lines? Hmm, if all four are parallel, then yes. But maybe the answer options don&#39;t all include 0. Wait, the answer options given are:(A) {1,2,3,4,5,6}(B) {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}(C) {0,1,3,4,5,6}(D) {0,1,2,3,5,6}So, the possible options include 0 for B, C, D. But we need to check whether 0 is actually possible. So, four parallel planes would have 0 intersection lines. So, 0 is possible. So, answer options B, C, D are candidates. But now, let&#39;s check whether other numbers are possible.Wait, but let&#39;s think again. If the four planes are all parallel, then each plane is parallel to the others, so no intersections. So 0 is possible. So 0 is in the set. So A is out because it doesn&#39;t include 0. Now, moving on. What about other numbers?So, next, if three planes are parallel and the fourth is not. Then, the three parallel planes don&#39;t intersect each other, but the fourth plane intersects each of the three parallel planes in three different lines. So, each intersection with the non-parallel plane gives a line. So, three lines. So, 3 is possible. So 3 is in the set.Alternatively, if two pairs of parallel planes. For example, two planes are parallel, and the other two are also parallel but in a different direction. So, like two sets of parallel planes. Then, each pair within the same set doesn&#39;t intersect, but planes from different sets intersect. So, if we have two pairs, each pair has two planes. So, the number of intersection lines would be 2 (from the first pair) times 2 (from the second pair) = 4 lines. Because each plane in the first pair intersects each plane in the second pair, forming a line. So, 4 lines. So, 4 is possible.Alternatively, if three planes intersect along a common line, and the fourth plane is arranged in some way. Let&#39;s see. If three planes intersect along the same line, so they all share a common line. Then, the fourth plane can intersect each of the three planes in three different lines. But wait, if the fourth plane is not passing through the common line of the first three, then it would intersect each of the three planes in separate lines. But the first three planes only contribute one line (the common line). So, total lines would be 1 (from the three planes) plus 3 (from the fourth plane intersecting each of the three) = 4 lines. But wait, if the fourth plane intersects each of the three planes in three different lines, but those three lines might not coincide with the existing lines. Wait, but if the first three planes already have a common line, then the fourth plane can intersect them in three different lines. So, total lines would be 1 + 3 = 4. Hmm, but is that accurate?Wait, let me think. If three planes intersect along a common line L. Then, the fourth plane can intersect each of the three planes. If the fourth plane is not parallel to line L, then it will intersect each of the three planes along three different lines, each of which intersects L at some point. So, those three lines would be distinct. So, total lines would be 1 (the common line) plus 3 (from the fourth plane) = 4 lines. So, 4 is possible. Alternatively, if the fourth plane is parallel to line L, then it might not intersect line L, but it would still intersect each of the three planes in lines that are parallel to each other? Hmm, no. Wait, if the fourth plane is parallel to line L, then it can still intersect each of the three planes, but the lines of intersection would be parallel to each other. Because the fourth plane is parallel to L, so the direction of the intersection lines would be parallel to L. So, if the fourth plane is parallel to L but not containing L, then the intersections with the three original planes would be three parallel lines. So, three new lines, but they are parallel. So, the total lines would be 1 (common line) plus 3 (parallel lines) = 4 lines. But if the three parallel lines are considered distinct, then 4 lines. But if the three lines are actually the same line... Wait, no. If the fourth plane is parallel to L but not containing it, then each intersection with the three original planes would be a separate line, each parallel to L but in different positions. So, three distinct parallel lines. So, total lines would be 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 is possible.Alternatively, if the fourth plane contains line L. Then, the fourth plane would intersect each of the three original planes along line L. So, in that case, all four planes share line L. So, the intersection lines would be line L for each pair among the first three planes, and the fourth plane intersecting each of the first three also along line L. So, how many distinct lines? Just line L. Because every pair of planes among the four intersects along L. Wait, no. Wait, if the fourth plane contains L, then the first three planes each intersect the fourth plane along L. But the intersections between the first three planes are also L. So, all intersections are L. So, the total number of intersection lines is 1. So, that&#39;s another case where you can have 1 line. So, 1 is possible.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So, if all four planes pass through the same line, then every pair of planes intersects along that line, so the number of intersection lines is 1. So, 1 is possible. So, 1 is in the set. Therefore, the answer options must include 1.So far, we have 0,1,3,4,6 as possible numbers. Wait, but let&#39;s check again. Let me go step by step through possible configurations.First, 0: all four planes are parallel. So, that&#39;s 0 lines.1: all four planes intersect along a single common line. So, every pair of planes intersects along that line. So, only 1 line.3: three planes are parallel, and the fourth plane is not parallel. Each of the three parallel planes intersects the fourth plane in a line, so three lines. The three parallel planes don&#39;t intersect each other. The fourth plane is only involved in those three intersections, so total lines: 3.4: either two pairs of parallel planes, each pair intersecting the other pair in lines, leading to 2×2=4 lines. Alternatively, three planes intersecting along a common line and the fourth plane intersecting each of the three planes in separate lines, leading to 1+3=4 lines. Or three parallel planes and a fourth plane intersecting them in three lines, but wait, no, that would be three lines. Wait, maybe another configuration. Maybe two planes are parallel, and the other two intersect each other and also intersect the parallel planes. Let&#39;s see: two parallel planes, then the other two planes are not parallel to each other or to the parallel planes. So, each of the two non-parallel planes intersects the two parallel planes, giving 2×2=4 lines. Additionally, the two non-parallel planes intersect each other in a line, so total lines: 4 +1=5. Wait, so that&#39;s 5 lines. So, maybe that&#39;s another case. Hmm, so perhaps 5 is also possible.Wait, let&#39;s verify. If we have two parallel planes, and two other planes that intersect each other and also intersect the two parallel planes. So, each of the two non-parallel planes intersects the two parallel planes, which is 2 planes × 2 intersections each = 4 lines. Then, the two non-parallel planes intersect each other, adding one more line. So total of 5 lines. So, yes, 5 is possible. Therefore, 5 is in the set.Similarly, if three planes are such that two are parallel, and the third intersects them, giving two lines, and then the fourth plane is arranged in some way. Wait, maybe if the fourth plane is parallel to the third plane. Then, the fourth plane would intersect the two parallel planes in two lines, and the third plane is parallel to the fourth, so they don&#39;t intersect. So, total lines: two from the first two parallel planes and the third plane, two from the first two parallel planes and the fourth plane, and the third and fourth planes are parallel, so no intersection. So, total lines: 2 + 2 = 4. Hmm, but if the third and fourth planes are parallel, but the first two are also parallel. So, in total, we have two sets of parallel planes. Then, each plane in one set intersects each plane in the other set. So, two sets of two planes each: 2×2=4 lines. So, that&#39;s similar to the two pairs of parallel planes case, leading to 4 lines. So, 4 is possible.Alternatively, if we have two pairs of intersecting planes. For example, two planes intersecting along a line, and another two planes intersecting along another line, and all four planes are arranged such that none are parallel and no three planes share a common line. Then, each pair from different sets would intersect, leading to 2×2=4 lines, plus the two lines from each pair, so total lines: 2 + 4 = 6. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two pairs of planes: pair 1 (planes A and B) intersect along line L1, pair 2 (planes C and D) intersect along line L2. Then, each of A and B will intersect each of C and D in separate lines. So, each of the four planes from the first pair intersects each of the two planes in the second pair, leading to 4 lines. Then, the intersections within the pairs are L1 and L2. So, total lines: 4 + 2 = 6. But this is the same as the general case. So, 6 lines.But maybe if some lines coincide? For example, if the two pairs intersect along the same line. But then, that would require all four planes to intersect along the same line, which would make all pairs of planes intersect along that line, leading to 1 line. So, that&#39;s the case where you have 1 line. So, maybe 6 is the maximum, 0 is the minimum, and other numbers depend on the configurations.But earlier, we found that 5 is possible. So, how do we get 5 lines? As per before, with two parallel planes and two intersecting planes. Let me recount. Two parallel planes (say plane 1 and 2), and two other planes (3 and 4) that intersect each other. Plane 3 intersects plane 1 and 2 in two lines. Plane 4 intersects plane 1 and 2 in two lines. Additionally, planes 3 and 4 intersect each other in a line. So, total lines: 2 (from plane 3 and 1,2) + 2 (from plane 4 and 1,2) + 1 (from 3 and 4) = 5 lines. So, that&#39;s 5. So, 5 is possible.So far, numbers 0,1,3,4,5,6 are possible. Wait, but what about 2? Is 2 possible? Let me see. Can we arrange four planes such that only two lines are formed? Hmm. Let&#39;s think.If three planes are parallel, and the fourth plane is also parallel to them. Then, all four planes are parallel, which gives 0 lines. If three planes are parallel, and the fourth is not, that gives 3 lines. If two planes are parallel, and the other two are also parallel but in a different direction, that gives 4 lines. If two planes are parallel, and the other two intersect each other and intersect the parallel planes, that gives 5 lines. So, how can we get 2 lines?Wait, maybe if two pairs of planes, each pair coinciding? But the problem states &quot;four different planes,&quot; so they can&#39;t coincide. So, that&#39;s not possible. Alternatively, if two planes are parallel, and the other two planes are also parallel but in the same direction as the first two? Wait, no, that would make four parallel planes. Hmm. Alternatively, if two planes are parallel, and the other two planes intersect each other along a line that is parallel to the two parallel planes. Wait, let me think.Suppose we have two parallel planes, and two other planes that intersect along a line that&#39;s parallel to the two parallel planes. Then, each of the two intersecting planes would intersect each of the two parallel planes. But if their line of intersection is parallel to the parallel planes, does that affect anything? Let&#39;s see. For example, imagine two horizontal parallel planes. Then, two planes that intersect along a horizontal line. Then, each of these two planes would intersect the two horizontal planes in lines. However, since their line of intersection is horizontal, the lines of intersection with the horizontal planes might be parallel? Wait, no. If you have two planes intersecting along a horizontal line, and they each intersect a horizontal plane, then each intersection would be a line. But since the horizontal plane is horizontal, the intersection line would also be horizontal. So, the two intersecting planes each intersect the two horizontal planes in horizontal lines. So, for each horizontal plane, the two intersecting planes each intersect it in a horizontal line. So, each horizontal plane has two horizontal lines, which are parallel to each other. So, the total lines would be: two horizontal lines from the first horizontal plane, two horizontal lines from the second horizontal plane, and the line of intersection between the two non-parallel planes. Wait, but the lines on the horizontal planes would be parallel, so those are four lines, but two of them are duplicates? Wait, no. Each horizontal plane is intersected by the two non-parallel planes, resulting in two lines per horizontal plane. So, if the two non-parallel planes intersect each other along a horizontal line, then their intersections with the horizontal planes would be horizontal lines as well. But since the two non-parallel planes are different, their intersections with each horizontal plane would be different lines. However, if the two non-parallel planes are arranged such that their intersections with the horizontal planes are the same line, but that would require them to coincide, which they can&#39;t because they are different planes. So, each horizontal plane would have two distinct horizontal lines. So, the total lines would be:- From the first horizontal plane: two lines (from intersections with the two non-parallel planes).- From the second horizontal plane: two lines (similarly).- The line of intersection between the two non-parallel planes.But if the two non-parallel planes intersect along a horizontal line, then their intersections with the horizontal planes are also horizontal lines. However, each horizontal plane is intersected by both non-parallel planes, resulting in two horizontal lines on each horizontal plane. However, since all horizontal lines are parallel, those lines are parallel but distinct. So, in total, we have 4 + 1 = 5 lines? Wait, but each horizontal plane is a separate plane, so the lines on the first horizontal plane are different from those on the second. So, for example, first horizontal plane has lines L1 and L2, second horizontal plane has lines L3 and L4, and the two non-parallel planes intersect along line L5. So, total lines: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5. That&#39;s 5 lines. So, that&#39;s the same as the previous case.Hmm, so maybe there&#39;s no configuration that gives exactly 2 lines. Alternatively, is there another way? Let&#39;s think differently. Suppose three planes intersect along a single line, and the fourth plane is parallel to that line but not containing it. Wait, how does that work? If the fourth plane is parallel to the line, then it would intersect each of the three planes in lines that are parallel to the original line. So, similar to before, three parallel lines from the fourth plane intersecting the three original planes, plus the original common line. So, total lines: 1 + 3 = 4.Alternatively, maybe two planes are coinciding? But the problem states four different planes, so they can&#39;t coincide. So that&#39;s not possible. Alternatively, two pairs of planes, each pair intersecting along the same line. For example, planes 1 and 2 intersect along line L, planes 3 and 4 also intersect along line L. Then, all four planes intersect along line L. Wait, but then planes 1 and 3, if they are different planes, would intersect along line L as well. Similarly, all pairs would intersect along L, so only 1 line. So that&#39;s the case where all four planes share a common line, leading to 1 line.Alternatively, if two planes intersect along line L, and the other two planes are both parallel to line L but not to each other. Wait, so planes 3 and 4 are not parallel to each other but are both parallel to line L. Then, plane 3 and 4 would intersect each other in a line that&#39;s not parallel to L. But since they are both parallel to L, their line of intersection would not be parallel to L. Wait, but if two planes are both parallel to a given line, does that mean they can intersect in a line that&#39;s not parallel? Let me recall: if two planes are both parallel to a line, they can either be parallel to each other or intersect in a line that&#39;s parallel to that line. Wait, no. If two planes are both parallel to a line L, then their line of intersection, if they intersect, must be parallel to L. Because the direction vector of line L is parallel to both planes, so their intersection line must have a direction vector that is common to both planes, which would be parallel to L. So, if two planes are both parallel to line L, then they are either parallel to each other (no intersection) or intersect in a line parallel to L.Therefore, in the case where two planes (1 and 2) intersect along line L, and planes 3 and 4 are both parallel to L. If planes 3 and 4 are parallel to each other, then they don&#39;t intersect, and each of them can intersect planes 1 and 2. Since planes 3 and 4 are parallel to L, which is the line of intersection of planes 1 and 2, then planes 3 and 4 would intersect planes 1 and 2 in lines parallel to L. So, for example, plane 3 intersects plane 1 in line L1 (parallel to L) and plane 2 in line L2 (parallel to L). Similarly, plane 4 intersects plane 1 in L3 and plane 2 in L4, also parallel to L. So, if planes 3 and 4 are parallel to each other, then lines L1, L2, L3, L4 are all parallel. But each intersection is a distinct line unless planes 3 and 4 coincide, which they can&#39;t. So, lines L1, L2, L3, L4 are four distinct parallel lines. Additionally, planes 1 and 2 intersect in line L. So total lines: L, L1, L2, L3, L4. That&#39;s 5 lines.If planes 3 and 4 are not parallel, then they intersect in a line parallel to L. Let&#39;s say they intersect in line M, which is parallel to L. Then, plane 3 intersects planes 1 and 2 in lines parallel to L, and plane 4 does the same. Additionally, planes 3 and 4 intersect in line M. So, lines are L, M, L1, L2, L3, L4. But M is parallel to L. So, total lines: 6 lines, but all lines except L and M are parallel to L. Wait, but L is the original line, and M is parallel to L. So, if M is different from L, then we have two distinct lines (L and M) plus four lines parallel to them. So, total 6 lines.Alternatively, if planes 3 and 4 intersect in line L itself. Then, planes 3 and 4 intersect along L, so all four planes intersect along L. Then, total lines is 1. So, that&#39;s the previous case.So, in this configuration, depending on how planes 3 and 4 are arranged, we can get 1,5, or 6 lines. But not 2. Hmm. So, where does 2 come in?Wait, let&#39;s think of another configuration. Suppose we have two pairs of planes, each pair intersecting in a line, but the two lines are parallel. So, pair 1 (planes 1 and 2) intersect along line L1, pair 2 (planes 3 and 4) intersect along line L2, and L1 is parallel to L2. Additionally, all other intersections (between planes of different pairs) don&#39;t form any new lines. Wait, but planes from different pairs would intersect unless they are parallel. So, if lines L1 and L2 are parallel, does that mean the planes are arranged in a way that other intersections don&#39;t occur? Wait, no. If planes 1 and 2 form pair 1 with line L1, planes 3 and 4 form pair 2 with line L2 parallel to L1. Then, plane 1 (from pair 1) will intersect planes 3 and 4 (from pair 2) in lines. Since L1 and L2 are parallel, but planes are not necessarily parallel. Wait, maybe if the planes of pair 2 are arranged such that they are both parallel to pair 1&#39;s line L1.But if planes 3 and 4 intersect along L2, which is parallel to L1, then planes 3 and 4 must each contain a direction parallel to L2, hence parallel to L1. But planes 1 and 2 intersect along L1, so their normal vectors are not parallel. Therefore, planes 3 and 4, which intersect along L2 (parallel to L1), would have normal vectors that are not parallel to each other. Therefore, plane 1 (from pair 1) would intersect plane 3 (from pair 2) along a line, and similarly plane 1 and 4, plane 2 and 3, plane 2 and 4. So, each of the four planes from pair 1 intersects each of the two planes from pair 2 in lines. If the lines L1 and L2 are parallel, then perhaps the intersections between pair 1 and pair 2 planes are all parallel lines? Maybe.Let me try to visualize. Suppose pair 1: planes 1 and 2 intersect along vertical line L1. Pair 2: planes 3 and 4 intersect along vertical line L2, which is parallel to L1 (so also vertical). Now, plane 1 (from pair 1) will intersect plane 3 (from pair 2). Since plane 1 contains L1 and plane 3 contains L2, which are parallel, the intersection of plane 1 and plane 3 would be a line. Similarly for plane 1 and 4, plane 2 and 3, plane 2 and 4. If these intersections are all parallel lines, then maybe we can have multiple parallel lines.But unless the planes are arranged in a special way, these intersections might not be parallel. For example, if planes 1 and 2 are both vertical planes intersecting along L1, and planes 3 and 4 are also vertical planes intersecting along L2, which is parallel to L1, then all four planes are vertical. So, plane 1 and plane 3, both vertical, would intersect along a vertical line. Similarly, plane 1 and plane 4 intersect along another vertical line, and so on. So, all intersections between pair 1 and pair 2 planes would be vertical lines. However, if L1 and L2 are distinct vertical lines, then the intersections between planes 1 and 3, 1 and 4, etc., would be different vertical lines. So, total lines would be:- L1 and L2 (two vertical lines).- Four vertical lines from the intersections between pair 1 and pair 2 planes.But wait, planes 1 and 3 intersect along a vertical line, say M1. Planes 1 and 4 intersect along vertical line M2. Planes 2 and 3 intersect along vertical line M3. Planes 2 and 4 intersect along vertical line M4. So, total lines: L1, L2, M1, M2, M3, M4. That&#39;s six lines, all vertical, hence parallel. But since they are all vertical, they are parallel, but distinct. So, total six lines. So, that&#39;s the case where you have six lines, all parallel. But this seems similar to the general case, but with all lines parallel.Alternatively, if planes 1 and 2 are arranged such that their intersections with planes 3 and 4 coincide. But since planes are different, unless arranged specifically, the intersections would be distinct. So, perhaps in this configuration, you cannot reduce the number of lines below six. So, maybe this doesn&#39;t help.Wait, but maybe if planes 3 and 4 are arranged such that their intersections with planes 1 and 2 all coincide with L1. For example, if planes 3 and 4 both contain line L1, then planes 3 and 4 intersect planes 1 and 2 along L1. But in that case, planes 3 and 4 intersect along a line that contains L1? Wait, no. If planes 3 and 4 both contain L1, then they would intersect along a line that contains L1. But planes 3 and 4 are supposed to intersect along L2, which is parallel to L1. If L2 is parallel to L1 but distinct, then planes 3 and 4 can&#39;t both contain L1. So, this seems contradictory.Alternatively, if planes 3 and 4 are arranged such that their intersections with plane 1 are the same line, and their intersections with plane 2 are the same line. But how?Suppose plane 3 intersects plane 1 in line M, and plane 4 also intersects plane 1 in line M. That would require planes 3 and 4 to both contain line M and their line of intersection. But if planes 3 and 4 intersect along line L2, then line L2 must lie on both planes 3 and 4. If line M is the intersection of plane 1 with planes 3 and 4, then line M must lie on plane 1 and on both planes 3 and 4. Therefore, line M is the intersection of planes 1, 3, and 4. Similarly, if planes 3 and 4 intersect plane 2 in the same line N, then line N is the intersection of planes 2, 3, and 4. But planes 3 and 4 intersect along L2, so lines M and N must both lie on L2. But L2 is parallel to L1. If L1 is the intersection of planes 1 and 2, then L1 and L2 are parallel. Therefore, lines M and N are both on L2, but also on planes 1 and 2 respectively. However, since L1 and L2 are parallel, plane 1 contains L1 and line M (which is on L2), but L1 and L2 are parallel and distinct, so plane 1 cannot contain L2 unless it is parallel to it. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe such a configuration is not possible. Therefore, maybe it&#39;s impossible to have planes 3 and 4 intersect planes 1 and 2 in the same lines unless they coincide, which they can&#39;t.Therefore, perhaps there is no configuration of four planes that results in exactly 2 intersection lines. Then, the set of possible numbers would be {0,1,3,4,5,6}, which is option C. But wait, option D is {0,1,2,3,5,6}, which includes 2 but excludes 4. However, earlier we saw that 4 is possible (two pairs of parallel planes, or three planes with a common line and a fourth plane intersecting them). So, if 4 is possible, then option C and B include 4, but option D excludes it. Since we have established that 4 is possible, options C and B are still in the running. But we need to check if 2 is possible or not.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a configuration with two parallel planes and two other planes that are both parallel to each other but not to the first two. So, two pairs of parallel planes. Let me think. Suppose planes 1 and 2 are parallel, planes 3 and 4 are parallel. Then, each plane in the first pair intersects each plane in the second pair in a line. Since the planes in each pair are parallel, they don&#39;t intersect within the pair. So, the intersections are between the first pair and the second pair. There are 2×2=4 intersection lines. So, that gives 4 lines. So, that&#39;s the case we considered earlier. So, 4 lines. So, 4 is possible. So, 2 is still not accounted for.Wait, unless there&#39;s a case where we have two lines of intersection, but how? For example, if two planes are parallel, and the other two planes are also parallel but intersect the first two planes in the same line. Wait, but if two planes are parallel, the other two planes can&#39;t intersect them in the same line unless they are the same plane, which they aren&#39;t. For example, if planes 1 and 2 are parallel. If planes 3 and 4 are parallel to each other but intersect planes 1 and 2. If planes 3 and 4 are arranged such that they both intersect plane 1 along the same line, and plane 2 along the same line. But since planes 3 and 4 are parallel, their intersections with plane 1 would be parallel lines, not the same line. Similarly, their intersections with plane 2 would be parallel lines. So, plane 3 intersects plane 1 in line L1 and plane 2 in line L2. Plane 4, being parallel to plane 3, intersects plane 1 in line L3 (parallel to L1) and plane 2 in line L4 (parallel to L2). So, total lines: L1, L2, L3, L4. That&#39;s four lines, all parallel in pairs. So, still 4 lines.Alternatively, if three planes are arranged in such a way that they only produce two lines. But three planes typically either intersect in a common line, or form a triangular prism (if two are parallel and the third intersects them), which gives two lines. Wait, three planes: if two are parallel and the third intersects them, that gives two lines. Then, adding a fourth plane. If the fourth plane is parallel to the third plane, then it would intersect the two parallel planes in two more lines, leading to total of four lines. If the fourth plane is not parallel, then it could intersect the two parallel planes in two lines and intersect the third plane in a line, leading to three lines. Wait, let&#39;s clarify.Suppose we have three planes: planes 1 and 2 are parallel, plane 3 intersects them in lines L1 and L2. Then, adding a fourth plane. If plane 4 is parallel to plane 3, then plane 4 intersects planes 1 and 2 in lines L3 and L4, parallel to L1 and L2. So, total lines: L1, L2, L3, L4, and the intersection between planes 3 and 4 (if they are parallel, no intersection; if not, a line). Wait, if plane 4 is parallel to plane 3, they don&#39;t intersect, so total lines are L1, L2, L3, L4: four lines. If plane 4 is not parallel to plane 3, then plane 4 intersects plane 3 in a line L5, and planes 1 and 2 in L3 and L4. So total lines: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5: five lines. So, in this case, with three planes giving two lines and adding a fourth plane, we can get four or five lines, but not two.Wait, unless the fourth plane is arranged such that it doesn&#39;t create any new lines. But since it&#39;s a different plane, it must intersect existing planes unless it&#39;s parallel. If we have three planes: two parallel (planes 1, 2) and one intersecting them (plane 3). If the fourth plane is parallel to plane 1 and 2, then it&#39;s parallel to all three, but plane 3 isn&#39;t parallel, so the fourth plane would intersect plane 3 in a line. So, planes 1,2,4 are parallel, plane 3 is not. So, plane 4 intersects plane 3 in a line L3. Planes 1 and 2 don&#39;t intersect with 4. So total lines: L1 (from 1 and 3), L2 (from 2 and 3), L3 (from 3 and 4). That&#39;s three lines. So, 3 lines. So, if we have three parallel planes and one non-parallel, we get three lines.Alternatively, if the fourth plane is parallel to plane 3. Then, plane 4 is parallel to plane 3, so they don&#39;t intersect. Plane 4 intersects planes 1 and 2 in two lines. So total lines: L1, L2, L3, L4. Four lines.So, in no case do we get two lines. Hence, it seems that 2 is not achievable. Therefore, the possible numbers of intersection lines are 0,1,3,4,5,6, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the answer options:(A) {1,2,3,4,5,6}(B) {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}(C) {0,1,3,4,5,6}(D) {0,1,2,3,5,6}So, option C excludes 2 and includes 0,1,3,4,5,6. But wait, we need to confirm once more if 2 is possible or not. Is there any configuration where four planes can form exactly two lines?Wait, another idea: if two lines of intersection are each shared by two pairs of planes. For example, suppose we have four planes: planes 1 and 2 intersect along line L1, planes 3 and 4 intersect along line L2. If lines L1 and L2 are skew lines, then there are no other intersections. But wait, planes 1 and 3 will intersect in some line, unless they are parallel. Similarly, planes 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 2 and 4 will also intersect. So, unless all these intersections are the same as L1 or L2, which is not possible unless the planes are arranged in a special way.Alternatively, if all four planes belong to a regulus or something, but that&#39;s more complex. Maybe in hyperbolic paraboloid, but I think that might not limit the number of lines.Alternatively, if all four planes pass through a common line, then we have 1 line. If two pairs of planes intersect along two different lines, but arranged so that other intersections coincide. Wait, suppose planes 1 and 2 intersect along line L1, planes 3 and 4 intersect along line L2, and lines L1 and L2 are coplanar. Then, planes 1 and 3 might intersect along a line in that plane, but this seems too vague.Alternatively, consider four planes where two pairs intersect at the same two lines. For example, planes 1 and 2 intersect along line L1, planes 2 and 3 intersect along line L2, planes 3 and 4 intersect along line L1, and planes 4 and 1 intersect along line L2. This would form a kind of closed loop, but in three dimensions, this might not be possible without additional intersections. Each additional plane would create more lines. This seems too forced and likely would result in more intersections.Alternatively, maybe two planes are parallel, and the other two planes are also parallel but intersect the first two planes in the same line. Wait, but if two planes are parallel, any plane intersecting them must do so along parallel lines. So, if the other two planes are parallel, they would intersect the first two parallel planes in four parallel lines. But they can&#39;t intersect them in the same line because they are parallel to each other. For example, two horizontal planes and two vertical planes. The vertical planes would intersect the horizontal planes in two lines each, totaling four lines. So, that&#39;s four lines again.Wait, maybe if three planes are arranged such that they all intersect along the same line, and the fourth plane is arranged such that it only intersects two of them. But how? If the fourth plane is parallel to two of the first three planes, then it would intersect the third plane. If the fourth plane is parallel to one of the first three planes, it would intersect the other two. For example, suppose planes 1,2,3 intersect along line L. Plane 4 is parallel to plane 1. Then, plane 4 does not intersect plane 1, but intersects planes 2 and 3 in two lines. So, total lines: L (from 1,2,3), and two lines from plane 4 intersecting planes 2 and 3. So, three lines. If plane 4 is parallel to planes 2 and 3, but then it can&#39;t be parallel to both unless they are parallel, which they aren&#39;t since they intersect along L. So, plane 4 can only be parallel to one of them. If plane 4 is parallel to plane 2, then it intersects planes 1 and 3 in two lines, and plane 3 in another line. Wait, no. If plane 4 is parallel to plane 2, then it doesn&#39;t intersect plane 2, but intersects planes 1 and 3. Since planes 1 and 3 intersect along L, plane 4 intersects them in two lines that meet at a point on L? Or are parallel? Wait, if plane 4 is parallel to plane 2, which intersects planes 1 and 3 along L, then plane 4 must intersect planes 1 and 3 in lines that are parallel to L? Not sure. This is getting too complicated.Given all these attempts, it seems that achieving exactly two intersection lines with four planes is not possible. Therefore, the set of possible numbers is {0,1,3,4,5,6}, which is option C. But let me check once more for 2.Wait, another thought. If three planes intersect along one line, and the fourth plane is parallel to that line. Then, the fourth plane would intersect each of the three planes in a line parallel to the original line. But would that result in two lines?No, because the fourth plane intersects each of the three planes in separate parallel lines, so three lines. Plus the original common line. So total 4 lines. Not 2.Alternatively, if two pairs of planes each intersect in the same line. For example, planes 1-2 and planes 1-3 intersect along the same line. But then, planes 2 and 3 would coincide, which they can&#39;t. So, not possible.Alternatively, if three planes share a common line, and the fourth plane is arranged such that it only intersects one of the three planes. But how? If the fourth plane is parallel to two of the three planes, then it would intersect the third plane. If it&#39;s parallel to one, intersects the other two. So, no way to have it intersect only one.Therefore, I think it&#39;s safe to conclude that 2 is not possible. Hence, the correct answer is option C: {0,1,3,4,5,6}. However, looking back at the options, option D is {0,1,2,3,5,6}. Did I make a mistake here?Wait, let me check if 2 is actually possible. Suppose we have two pairs of planes, each pair intersecting in a line, and the two lines are the same. For example, planes 1-2 intersect in line L, planes 3-4 also intersect in line L. But then, all four planes share line L. So, every pair of planes intersects in line L. Therefore, only 1 line. So, that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, two pairs of planes intersecting in two different lines, but all four planes are arranged such that any other intersections coincide with these two lines. For instance, planes 1-2 intersect in line L1, planes 3-4 intersect in line L2. If planes 1 and 3 intersect along L1, and planes 2 and 4 intersect along L2, but this would require specific arrangements. Let me try to visualize:Plane 1: contains L1 and L2.Plane 2: contains L1 and intersects plane 4 in L2.Wait, this seems impossible. If plane 1 contains both L1 and L2, and plane 2 contains L1 and intersects plane 4 in L2, then plane 4 must contain L2 and intersect plane 2 in L2. Similarly, plane 3 must contain L2 and intersect plane 1 in L1. This is getting too tangled, and likely such a configuration would require planes to coincide or lines to coincide, which is not allowed.Another approach: consult the possible numbers from known results. I recall that in three-dimensional space, the number of intersections formed by four planes can vary, but the possible numbers are 0,1,3,4,5,6. The number 2 is not achievable. This is a known result in combinatorial geometry. Therefore, the answer should be option C.However, just to be thorough, let&#39;s consider if any standard configuration gives 2 lines. The most likely way would be if two planes are parallel (giving 0 lines between them), and the other two planes are also parallel (giving 0 lines between them), but each plane from one pair intersects each plane from the other pair in a line. However, this results in four intersection lines, not two. So, that&#39;s 4 lines.Alternatively, if three planes are mutually parallel, giving 0 lines among themselves, and the fourth plane is not parallel, cutting through them in three parallel lines. That gives three lines. So, 3 lines.If two planes are parallel, and the other two planes intersect each other and also intersect the parallel planes, leading to five lines as we saw before.If all four planes intersect along a common line, giving 1 line.If all four planes are parallel, giving 0 lines.If two planes are parallel, and the other two are parallel to each other but in a different direction, giving four lines.If three planes intersect along a common line, and the fourth plane intersects them in three different lines, leading to four lines.Thus, in no configuration do we get exactly two lines. Therefore, the correct answer must exclude 2 and include 0,1,3,4,5,6. Hence, option C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the set of possible numbers of intersection lines formed by four different planes in space, we need to consider various configurations of the planes:1. Maximum Number of Intersection Lines (6):   - When all four planes are in general position (no two parallel, no three intersecting along the same line), each pair of planes intersects in a distinct line. The number of pairs is ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ).2. Minimum Number of Intersection Lines (0):   - If all four planes are parallel, they do not intersect each other, resulting in 0 lines.3. Other Configurations:   - 1 Line: If all four planes intersect along a single common line.   - 3 Lines: If three planes are parallel, and the fourth plane intersects each of the three parallel planes in three different lines.   - 4 Lines:      - If two pairs of planes are parallel (each pair in a different direction), resulting in (2 times 2 = 4) intersection lines.     - If three planes intersect along a common line, and the fourth plane intersects each of the three planes in separate lines.   - 5 Lines: If two planes are parallel, and the other two planes intersect each other and the parallel planes, resulting in 5 lines.4. Checking for 2 Lines:   - After considering various configurations, it is determined that there is no possible arrangement of four planes that results in exactly 2 intersection lines. All configurations that might initially seem to produce 2 lines actually result in more lines or fewer lines due to the constraints of plane intersections.Thus, the set of possible numbers of intersection lines is ( {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6} ), which corresponds to option C.[boxed{C}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem about four different planes in space and the possible numbers of intersection lines they can form. The options are given as sets, and I need to figure out which set contains all the possible numbers. Let me think step by step.First, I remember that when two planes intersect, they form a line, provided they are not parallel. If they are parallel, they don&#39;t intersect. So, if all four planes are parallel, they would all be parallel to each other, meaning no intersections, right? So in that case, the number of intersection lines would be zero. But wait, the problem says &quot;four different planes,&quot; so maybe they can be arranged in different ways.Wait, if all four planes are parallel, then each pair of planes is parallel, so none of them intersect. But does that count as zero intersection lines? That seems right. So zero is a possible number. But looking at the options, option B includes zero, but option D also includes zero. So maybe both B and D are candidates, but let&#39;s check the rest.If the four planes are not all parallel, how many lines can they form? Let&#39;s think. If they are in general position, meaning no two planes are parallel and no three planes intersect along a common line, then each pair of planes intersects in a unique line. The number of intersection lines would be the combination of four planes taken two at a time, which is C(4,2) = 6. So six is the maximum number of intersection lines possible.But depending on how the planes are arranged, some intersection lines might coincide. For example, if three planes intersect along the same line, then those three planes would each intersect the other two along that single line, so instead of three separate lines, you have one line. Let me see. Suppose three planes intersect along the same line. Then the first and second plane intersect along that line, the first and third also along that line, and the second and third also along that line. So those three pairs would all share the same line, reducing the total number of intersection lines. So normally, those three pairs would contribute three lines, but in this case, they contribute only one. So the total number of lines would be 6 - 2 = 4? Wait, let me check again.If three planes intersect along a single line, then each pair among those three planes intersect along that line, so instead of three separate lines, you have one line. So the total number of lines would be the remaining intersections plus that one line. The fourth plane, if it&#39;s not part of that trio, would intersect each of the three planes in three separate lines. So originally, without any overlapping, it would be six lines. But if three pairs are overlapping, we subtract two lines (since 3 become 1), so total lines would be 6 - 2 = 4? Wait, no. Let me recast.Total number of intersections when three planes intersect along the same line: For the three planes, instead of 3 lines, we have 1 line. Then the fourth plane intersects each of the three planes in three different lines. So total lines would be 1 + 3 = 4. But originally, without the three planes intersecting along the same line, it would have been 3 + 3 = 6. So yes, 4 is possible. So 4 is a possible number of lines.Similarly, if two pairs of planes are parallel, then each pair that&#39;s parallel doesn&#39;t intersect, so reducing the total lines. For example, suppose we have two pairs of parallel planes. Each pair of parallel planes doesn&#39;t intersect, so how many lines would that be? Let&#39;s see. If there are four planes: Plane 1 and Plane 2 are parallel; Plane 3 and Plane 4 are parallel. Then Plane 1 doesn&#39;t intersect Plane 2, and Plane 3 doesn&#39;t intersect Plane 4. The other intersections: Plane 1 intersects Planes 3 and 4, Plane 2 intersects Planes 3 and 4, Plane 3 intersects Planes 1 and 2, and Plane 4 intersects Planes 1 and 2. Each of these intersections would form a line. So how many lines is that?Planes 1 and 3: linePlanes 1 and 4: linePlanes 2 and 3: linePlanes 2 and 4: linePlanes 3 and 4: parallel, no linePlanes 1 and 2: parallel, no lineSo that&#39;s four lines. Wait, so two pairs of parallel planes result in four intersection lines. So four is possible. But earlier, when three planes intersect along the same line, we also had four lines. So four is achievable in multiple ways.Alternatively, if three planes are parallel, and the fourth is not, then how many lines? The three parallel planes don&#39;t intersect each other, and the fourth plane intersects each of the three parallel planes in three separate lines. So three lines. So three is possible.But wait, if three planes are parallel, then each of them doesn&#39;t intersect the others. The fourth plane, intersecting each of the three, gives three lines. So total three lines. So three is possible.Also, if two planes are parallel, and the other two are not parallel and not intersecting along the same line as the first two. Then, how many lines?Let me see. Two parallel planes: they don&#39;t intersect. Each of the other two planes intersects the two parallel planes, giving two lines each. So each of the non-parallel planes intersects the two parallel planes, creating two lines per non-parallel plane. So that&#39;s 2 + 2 = 4 lines. Then, the two non-parallel planes intersect each other, adding another line. So total lines: 4 + 1 = 5. Wait, so that would be five lines.Wait, let me break it down. Planes 1 and 2 are parallel. Planes 3 and 4 are not parallel to each other or to Planes 1 and 2.Planes 1 and 2: no line.Planes 1 and 3: linePlanes 1 and 4: linePlanes 2 and 3: linePlanes 2 and 4: linePlanes 3 and 4: lineSo that&#39;s five lines. So five is possible.Alternatively, if two planes are parallel, and the other two are also parallel but in a different direction, but then we have four planes arranged as two pairs of parallel planes. Wait, but we already considered that case earlier, which gave four lines. So depending on how the planes are arranged, we can have different numbers.What about if all four planes intersect along the same line? So all four planes share a common line. Then, each pair of planes would intersect along that same line. So instead of C(4,2)=6 lines, we have just one line. So the number of lines is one. So one is possible.But how can all four planes intersect along the same line? If they all contain the same line, then yes, every pair of planes intersects along that line. For example, imagine four different planes all passing through the same line but rotated around it. So they all share that line. Therefore, each intersection is that line. So only one line. So that&#39;s possible. So one is possible.Alternatively, if three planes intersect along a common line, and the fourth plane is arranged such that it intersects each of the three planes along different lines. Wait, no. If the fourth plane is not passing through that common line, then it would intersect each of the three planes along separate lines. So, similar to the earlier case, three planes intersecting along one line, and the fourth plane intersecting each of those three in separate lines, giving a total of four lines. But if the fourth plane also passes through the common line, then all four planes intersect along that line, so all pairs would intersect along that line, resulting in one line. So one is possible.So far, possible numbers I have are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, but where did 3 come from? Earlier, when three planes are parallel and the fourth isn&#39;t, the fourth plane intersects each of the three parallel planes, resulting in three lines. So three lines is possible.Wait, but in that case, if three planes are parallel, the fourth plane intersects each of them in three separate lines. So three lines. Then, what about the fourth plane? Are there any other intersections? If the three planes are all parallel, and the fourth plane is not parallel to them, then each of the three parallel planes is intersected by the fourth plane, giving three parallel lines? Wait, no. If three planes are parallel, then a fourth plane intersecting them would create three parallel lines? Wait, no, actually, if the three planes are parallel, they are all parallel to each other, so a fourth plane intersecting them would intersect each in a line, and all those lines would be parallel, since the planes are parallel. So three parallel lines. So those are three distinct lines, but they are all parallel. So they are three different lines, just parallel. So three lines is possible.So, in this case, three lines. So three is possible.Wait, but what if two planes are parallel, and the other two intersect each other? Let&#39;s see. Planes 1 and 2 are parallel. Plane 3 intersects Plane 1 and Plane 2 along two parallel lines. Plane 4 intersects Plane 1 and Plane 2 along two more parallel lines. Then, Plane 3 and Plane 4 might intersect each other as well. So how many lines?Planes 1 and 2: no line.Planes 1-3: linePlanes 1-4: linePlanes 2-3: linePlanes 2-4: linePlanes 3-4: lineSo total five lines. So if Plane 3 and 4 are not parallel, they intersect each other. So that&#39;s five lines, as before.But if Planes 3 and 4 are also parallel, then we have two pairs of parallel planes: Planes 1-2 and Planes 3-4. Then, the number of lines is four, as earlier.So depending on the arrangement, we can get different numbers.So compiling the possible numbers:- 0: All four planes are parallel. Wait, but if all four planes are parallel, then no intersections. But in 3D space, four distinct parallel planes. Each pair is parallel, so no intersection lines. So 0 lines.Wait, but the problem says &quot;four different planes.&quot; So, yes, different planes can still be parallel. So 0 is possible.- 1: All four planes intersect along a single common line. So every pair of planes intersects along that line, so only one line.- 3: Three planes are parallel, and the fourth plane is not parallel, intersecting each of the three parallel planes in three separate lines. Since those three lines are parallel, but distinct, so three lines.- 4: Either two pairs of parallel planes, each pair contributing two intersections with the other pair, totaling four lines. Or three planes intersecting along a common line and the fourth plane intersecting each of them in separate lines, totaling 1 + 3 = 4 lines.- 5: When two planes are parallel, and the other two planes are not parallel and intersect each other. The non-parallel planes each intersect the two parallel planes, giving four lines, and they intersect each other, adding a fifth line.- 6: When all four planes are in general position, meaning no two are parallel and no three intersect along a common line. So each pair intersects in a distinct line, giving C(4,2)=6 lines.So that covers 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, but what about 2? Is two possible? Hmm, how could we get two intersection lines? Let me think.If two pairs of planes intersect each other along the same line. Wait, but each pair of planes can only intersect along a line if they&#39;re not parallel. Suppose we have four planes where two pairs intersect along the same line. Wait, but if two pairs share the same line, that would mean that four planes all contain that line, right? Because if Plane 1 and Plane 2 intersect along line L, and Plane 3 and Plane 4 also intersect along line L, then all four planes contain line L. Wait, but if that&#39;s the case, then every pair of planes among the four would intersect along line L. So that would result in only one line, not two. So that gives one line.Alternatively, maybe arranging the planes such that there are two different lines where multiple planes intersect. For example, suppose three planes intersect along line L, and the fourth plane intersects one of those three planes along a different line M. Wait, but if three planes intersect along line L, then the fourth plane, if it intersects one of them along a different line, then that line M would have to be the intersection of the fourth plane with that one plane. But since the three original planes intersect along L, the fourth plane would intersect each of the three planes. If it intersects one plane along M, then M must either be parallel to L or intersect it. But if the fourth plane is not passing through L, then its intersection with each of the three original planes would be three different lines, all parallel to each other if the fourth plane is parallel to L, or intersecting at different points if not.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of a specific configuration.Suppose we have three planes intersecting along line L. The fourth plane is not parallel to L and not containing L. Then, the fourth plane would intersect each of the three original planes along three distinct lines, which all meet at a single point where the fourth plane intersects line L. So three lines intersecting at a point. So total lines would be L plus the three new lines, making four lines. But if the fourth plane is arranged such that it intersects two of the original three planes along the same line. Wait, but if the three original planes intersect along L, then any plane intersecting two of them would have to intersect along lines that lie on both planes, which would be L itself. So unless the fourth plane contains L, it can&#39;t intersect two of the original planes along the same line. So perhaps if the fourth plane contains L, then all four planes intersect along L, leading to one line.Alternatively, if the fourth plane is parallel to L, then intersecting the three original planes in three parallel lines. So those three lines are parallel, but distinct. So total lines: L plus three parallel lines, which would be four lines.Hmm. So maybe two lines isn&#39;t possible. Wait, how else?Alternatively, if we have two pairs of planes, each pair intersecting in a different line, and no other intersections. But in 3D space, if two pairs of planes intersect in two different lines, those lines can either be parallel, intersecting, or skew.If the two lines are parallel, then the four planes would form two pairs of parallel planes? Wait, no. Let me see.Suppose Plane 1 and Plane 2 intersect along line L1, and Plane 3 and Plane 4 intersect along line L2. If L1 and L2 are parallel, then Planes 1 and 2 are not parallel to Planes 3 and 4 unless their normals are arranged accordingly. But even so, Planes 1 and 3 might intersect, etc.Wait, this might not result in only two lines. For example, if Plane 1 and Plane 2 intersect along L1, and Plane 3 and Plane 4 intersect along L2, which is parallel to L1. Then, Plane 1 would intersect Planes 3 and 4 along two different lines. Similarly, Plane 2 would intersect Planes 3 and 4 along two different lines. So total lines would be L1, L2, and four more lines from the intersections between the first pair and the second pair. So that&#39;s six lines. Unless the planes are arranged in such a way that some intersections coincide.Alternatively, if Planes 1 and 2 intersect along L1, and Planes 3 and 4 are both parallel to L1. Then, Planes 3 and 4 are parallel to each other (since they&#39;re both parallel to the same line). So Planes 3 and 4 are parallel, so they don&#39;t intersect. Then, Planes 1 and 3 intersect along a line, Plane 1 and 4 intersect along another line, Plane 2 and 3 intersect along another line, Plane 2 and 4 intersect along another line. So that&#39;s L1, plus four lines from the intersections between Planes 1-2 with Planes 3-4. But Planes 3 and 4 are parallel, so no intersection between them. So total lines would be 1 + 4 = 5 lines. Hmm.Alternatively, if we have two sets of planes, each set being two parallel planes. So, Planes 1 and 2 are parallel, Planes 3 and 4 are parallel. If the two sets are not parallel to each other, then each plane from the first set intersects each plane from the second set, giving four lines. So total lines would be four. So that brings us back to four lines.Wait, so is two lines possible? How?Maybe if we have three planes arranged such that two are parallel, and the third is not parallel, and the fourth plane is arranged in some way. Wait, let&#39;s see. If two planes are parallel (Planes 1 and 2), Plane 3 is not parallel and intersects them in two lines. Plane 4 is arranged such that it&#39;s parallel to Plane 3. Then, Plane 4 would be parallel to Plane 3, so they don&#39;t intersect. Plane 4 would intersect Planes 1 and 2 in two lines. So total lines:Planes 1 and 2: no line.Planes 1 and 3: linePlanes 1 and 4: linePlanes 2 and 3: linePlanes 2 and 4: linePlanes 3 and 4: no line.So that&#39;s four lines. Still four.Alternatively, if Plane 4 coincides with Plane 3, but they have to be different planes. So no.Alternatively, if Plane 4 is arranged such that it intersects both Planes 1 and 2 along the same line that Plane 3 does. But if Planes 1 and 2 are parallel, then Plane 3 intersects them in two parallel lines. Plane 4 would have to be parallel to Plane 3 to intersect Planes 1 and 2 along the same lines, but then Plane 4 would be parallel to Plane 3, so they don&#39;t intersect. Wait, but even so, Plane 4 would intersect Planes 1 and 2 in two lines parallel to the original lines from Plane 3. So you&#39;d have two sets of parallel lines, but still four distinct lines. So again, four lines.Hmm. Maybe two lines isn&#39;t possible. Let me think differently.Suppose two planes are coincident. Wait, but the problem says four different planes. Coincident planes are not different, right? So they must be distinct, so no two planes are coincident.Alternatively, what if we have four planes where two pairs intersect at two different lines, and all other intersections are along those two lines. Is that possible?For example, suppose Planes 1 and 2 intersect along line L1, and Planes 3 and 4 intersect along line L2. If L1 and L2 are the same line, then all four planes intersect along that line, leading to one line. But if L1 and L2 are different lines, then we need to see how the other intersections work.Planes 1 and 3: intersect along some line.Planes 1 and 4: intersect along some line.Planes 2 and 3: intersect along some line.Planes 2 and 4: intersect along some line.Unless those intersections coincide with L1 or L2. For example, if Planes 1 and 3 intersect along L1, but Plane 3 is part of the pair with Plane 4 intersecting along L2. Wait, if Plane 3 intersects Plane 1 along L1, then Plane 1 contains L1, and Plane 3 contains L1 and also intersects Plane 4 along L2. So unless L2 is the same as L1, which they are not, Plane 3 would have two lines of intersection: L1 with Plane 1, and L2 with Plane 4. But a plane can&#39;t contain two different lines unless they intersect or are parallel. If L1 and L2 are skew, Plane 3 can&#39;t contain both. So this might not be possible.Alternatively, if L1 and L2 are intersecting lines. Suppose L1 and L2 intersect at a point. Then, if Planes 1 and 2 intersect along L1, and Planes 3 and 4 intersect along L2, and L1 and L2 intersect at a point P. Then, Plane 1 contains L1, Plane 3 contains L2. Plane 1 and Plane 3 would intersect along a line that passes through P, since both contain P. Similarly, other intersections would create lines through P. But I don&#39;t see how this would result in only two lines.Alternatively, if all four planes pass through a single point. Then, each pair of planes intersect along a line passing through that point. So you can have multiple lines through that point. But the number of lines would depend on how the planes are arranged. If all four planes pass through a single point, but are otherwise in general position, then each pair of planes intersect along a distinct line, so six lines. If some planes are arranged such that multiple pairs share a line, then fewer lines.But unless multiple planes share a common line through the point, which would require them to be co-planar or something. But in 3D space, four planes passing through a point can be arranged so that each pair intersects along a unique line, giving six lines. Alternatively, if some planes are arranged such that three planes intersect along the same line, but in that case, those three planes would have to lie in a pencil around that line. But this is getting too complex.Wait, maybe two lines is not possible. The possible numbers we have are 0,1,3,4,5,6. So the answer would be option C: {0,1,3,4,5,6}, but looking at the options given, option C is {0,1,3,4,5,6}, and option D is {0,1,2,3,5,6}. Wait, the question is asking for the set of possible numbers. So if two is not possible, then option C would be correct. But the options given are:(A) {1,2,3,4,5,6}(B) {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}(C) {0,1,3,4,5,6}(D) {0,1,2,3,5,6}So, based on my earlier reasoning, 0,1,3,4,5,6 are possible, but 2 is not. So the correct answer should be option C. But I need to confirm if two is possible or not.Wait, let&#39;s think once more. Is there a configuration where four planes can intersect in exactly two lines?Suppose we have two pairs of planes, each pair intersecting in a line, and the two lines are the same. Wait, that would mean all four planes share a common line, leading to one line. Not two.Alternatively, two different lines, but arranged such that all other intersections are along those two lines.Wait, imagine two lines, L1 and L2, which are either parallel or intersecting.Case 1: L1 and L2 are parallel. Suppose we have four planes: two planes intersecting along L1, and two planes intersecting along L2. But then each plane from the first pair will intersect each plane from the second pair in a line. If L1 and L2 are parallel, then the intersections between the planes of the first pair and the second pair would be lines that are parallel to L1 and L2. So in total, we have L1, L2, and four more lines (from the cross intersections). So that&#39;s six lines. Not two.Case 2: L1 and L2 intersect at a point P. Then, the four planes are arranged such that two planes intersect along L1, two along L2. Then, each plane from the first pair intersects each plane from the second pair along a line passing through P. So, for example, Plane 1 (from first pair) intersects Plane 3 (from second pair) along a line through P, same with Plane 1 and Plane 4, Plane 2 and Plane 3, Plane 2 and Plane 4. So that would result in L1, L2, and four more lines through P. Total of six lines again.Alternatively, can we have four planes where all intersections are only two lines? For example, if two lines each have two planes intersecting along them, and the other intersections somehow don&#39;t create new lines. But in reality, when planes intersect, unless they are parallel, they must intersect along a line. So if you have four planes, unless some are parallel, you have multiple lines.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. If two planes are coincident, but the problem states four different planes, so coincident planes are not allowed. So scratch that.Alternatively, three planes are arranged such that they all intersect along a single line, and the fourth plane is parallel to that line. Wait, if the fourth plane is parallel to the line, then it doesn&#39;t intersect the line, but it can still intersect each of the three planes. If the fourth plane is parallel to the common line of the first three planes, then its intersections with each of the three planes would be three parallel lines. So total lines: the original common line plus three parallel lines, totaling four lines.Still not two.Alternatively, what if two planes are parallel, and the other two planes are also parallel but in a different direction, and arranged such that each of the latter two planes is parallel to the intersection line of the first two. Wait, this is getting too vague.Alternatively, consider three planes: two parallel planes and a third plane intersecting both, creating two parallel lines. Then add a fourth plane that is also parallel to the first two and doesn&#39;t intersect them, but intersects the third plane in another line. Wait, but if the fourth plane is parallel to the first two, it would be parallel to them and hence not intersect them, but it can intersect the third plane in a line. So total lines:Planes 1 and 2: parallel, no line.Planes 1 and 3: line L1.Planes 2 and 3: line L2 (parallel to L1).Planes 4 is parallel to 1 and 2, so no intersection with them.Planes 4 and 3: line L3.So total lines: L1, L2, L3. Three lines.But we already have three lines as a possible number.Alternatively, if we have two pairs of parallel planes, but each pair is parallel in a different direction. So, Planes 1 and 2 are parallel (horizontal), Planes 3 and 4 are parallel (vertical). Each plane from the first pair intersects each plane from the second pair in a line. So Planes 1 and 3: line, Planes 1 and 4: line, Planes 2 and 3: line, Planes 2 and 4: line. These four lines would be parallel within each pair, but since the two pairs are in different directions, maybe the lines are all parallel? Wait, no. If Planes 1 and 2 are horizontal, and Planes 3 and 4 are vertical, then the intersections would be lines that are vertical for Planes 1 and 2 with Planes 3 and 4. Wait, no. The intersection of a horizontal plane and a vertical plane would be a line that&#39;s horizontal or vertical depending on orientation. Wait, maybe they form a grid. For example, Planes 1 and 2 are like floors, Planes 3 and 4 are like walls. Each floor intersects each wall along a line (the corner where the wall meets the floor). So four lines, each at the corners. So that&#39;s four lines.Thus, even with two pairs of perpendicular parallel planes, you get four lines.So still, two lines seems elusive. Perhaps it&#39;s not possible. Then, the possible numbers are 0,1,3,4,5,6, which is option C.But wait, the options given have option D as {0,1,2,3,5,6}. So they include 2 but exclude 4. But we already established that 4 is possible. So maybe the answer is C.Wait, but let me check one more time. Is there a way to get two lines?Suppose we have four planes arranged such that two lines of intersection are formed, with multiple planes intersecting along each line.For example, three planes intersecting along line L1, and the fourth plane intersecting another plane along line L2. But then, the fourth plane would intersect the three planes in three lines. Unless... Wait, if three planes intersect along L1, and the fourth plane is arranged such that it intersects one of those three planes along L1 and the other two along a single line L2. Is that possible?Wait, if the fourth plane contains L1, then it would intersect all three planes along L1, resulting in only one line. If the fourth plane doesn&#39;t contain L1, it would intersect each of the three planes in three different lines. So to have two lines, the fourth plane would have to intersect two of the three planes along the same line, and the third plane along a different line. But how?If two of the original three planes are such that the fourth plane intersects them along the same line. For that to happen, that line would have to be common to both planes, which would mean it&#39;s their line of intersection, which is L1. So if the fourth plane intersects two of the original three planes along L1, then it must contain L1. Then, it would intersect the third original plane along a different line. So total lines: L1 and the line from the intersection with the third plane. So two lines. Wait, this might work.Let me detail:Planes 1, 2, 3 intersect along line L1.Plane 4 contains L1, so it intersects Planes 1, 2, and 3 along L1. But Plane 4 also intersects Plane 3 (wait, Plane 4 contains L1, which is the intersection of Planes 1,2,3. So Plane 4 contains L1, so it intersects Plane 3 along L1. Therefore, all intersections between Plane 4 and Planes 1,2,3 are along L1. But Plane 4 is a different plane from 1,2,3, so it must intersect Plane 3 along L1, which is already the case. So in this configuration, the only lines are L1 and... Wait, if Plane 4 contains L1, then all four planes intersect along L1. Therefore, every pair of planes among the four intersects along L1. So only one line. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, suppose Plane 4 intersects Plane 1 and Plane 2 along a different line L2, and intersects Plane 3 along line L3. But unless L2 and L3 are the same, which would require Plane 4 to intersect Plane 3 along L2, which would mean L2 is the intersection of Plane 4 and Plane 3. But Plane 4 intersects Plane 1 and Plane 2 along L2, so L2 would have to lie on both Plane 1 and Plane 4, and Plane 2 and Plane 4. Therefore, L2 is the intersection of Planes 1 and 4, and also of Planes 2 and 4. Therefore, L2 is the line where Planes 1, 2, and 4 meet. But Planes 1 and 2 already intersect along L1. So unless L1 and L2 are the same line, which would require Plane 4 to contain L1. But then, Plane 4 contains L1, and intersects Plane 3 along L3. If L3 is different from L1, then we have two lines: L1 and L3. But wait, in that case, Plane 4 intersects Planes 1, 2 along L1, and Plane 3 along L3. So total lines:Planes 1-2: L1Planes 1-4: L1Planes 2-4: L1Planes 3-4: L3Planes 1-3: L1 (since Planes 1,2,3 intersect along L1)Planes 2-3: L1Planes 3-4: L3So total lines: L1 and L3. So two lines. So is that possible?Yes! If three planes intersect along L1, and the fourth plane contains L1 and intersects the third plane along another line L3. Wait, but if the fourth plane contains L1, which is the intersection of Planes 1,2,3, then Plane 4 contains L1 and intersects Plane 3 along L1, right? Because Plane 3 contains L1. Wait, no. If Plane 4 contains L1, then Plane 4 and Plane 3 both contain L1, so their intersection is L1. So Plane 4 can&#39;t intersect Plane 3 along a different line L3 unless L3 coincides with L1. Therefore, this configuration doesn&#39;t result in two lines.Wait, maybe another approach. Suppose Planes 1 and 2 intersect along line L1. Planes 3 and 4 intersect along line L2. Additionally, Plane 1 is parallel to Plane 3, and Plane 2 is parallel to Plane 4. Then, Planes 1 and 3 are parallel, no intersection; Planes 2 and 4 are parallel, no intersection. The intersections are L1 (Planes 1-2), L2 (Planes 3-4), and the intersections of Planes 1-4, Planes 1-3 (parallel), Planes 2-3, Planes 2-4 (parallel). Wait, no. Plane 1 is parallel to Plane 3, so no intersection. Plane 2 is parallel to Plane 4, so no intersection. Plane 1 intersects Plane 4: since Plane 1 is parallel to Plane 3, and Plane 4 is parallel to Plane 2, which is not parallel to Plane 1. So Plane 1 and Plane 4 are not parallel, so they intersect along a line. Similarly, Plane 2 and Plane 3 are not parallel, so they intersect along a line. So total lines:L1 (Planes 1-2),L2 (Planes 3-4),Line from Planes 1-4,Line from Planes 2-3.So that&#39;s four lines. Still four.Hmm. I can&#39;t seem to find a configuration that results in exactly two lines. Therefore, maybe two is not possible, which would mean the answer is option C: {0,1,3,4,5,6}.But let me check once more. Maybe if two planes are the same, but the problem states four different planes. So coincident planes aren&#39;t allowed. So no.Alternatively, two planes intersecting along a line, and the other two planes are both parallel to that line but not to each other. Then, each of the latter two planes would intersect the first two planes in lines parallel to the original line. Then, how many lines do we have?Planes 1 and 2 intersect along line L.Planes 3 and 4 are each parallel to L but not parallel to each other.Plane 3 intersects Plane 1 along line L1 (parallel to L) and Plane 2 along line L2 (parallel to L).Plane 4 intersects Plane 1 along line L3 (parallel to L) and Plane 2 along line L4 (parallel to L).Planes 3 and 4, not being parallel, intersect along some line M.So total lines:L (Planes 1-2),L1, L2, L3, L4 (four lines parallel to L),M (Planes 3-4).So that&#39;s six lines. Not two.Alternatively, if Planes 3 and 4 are parallel to each other, then they don&#39;t intersect. So lines would be:L (Planes1-2),L1, L2 (Plane3 intersects Planes1 and 2),L3, L4 (Plane4 intersects Planes1 and 2).Total lines: 1 + 4 = 5 lines.Still not two.I think after all this, two lines is not achievable. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: {0,1,3,4,5,6}.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the set of possible numbers of intersection lines formed by four different planes in space, we consider various configurations:1. 0 lines: All four planes are parallel.2. 1 line: All four planes intersect along a single common line.3. 3 lines: Three planes are parallel, and the fourth plane intersects each of the three parallel planes in three separate lines.4. 4 lines:    - Two pairs of parallel planes, each pair intersecting the other pair in two lines.   - Three planes intersect along a common line, and the fourth plane intersects each of the three planes in separate lines.5. 5 lines: Two planes are parallel, and the other two planes intersect each other and each intersect the two parallel planes.6. 6 lines: All four planes are in general position (no two are parallel, and no three intersect along a common line), resulting in each pair of planes intersecting in a distinct line.After considering all possible configurations, we find that the numbers of intersection lines possible are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The number 2 is not achievable with any valid configuration of four different planes.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e7dc6219></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>🔑:</span>3.

The distance is divided into segments of equal length, the number of which is 42, with a checkpoint at the beginning of each. Petya runs a segment in 9 minutes, Vasya in 11 minutes, and on the scooter, either of them can cover a segment in 3 minutes. They start simultaneously, and the time of the last one to finish is recorded at the finish line. The team agreed that one of them will ride the first part of the way on the scooter and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite (the scooter can be left at any checkpoint). How many segments should Petya ride on the scooter to achieve the best time for the team?## Number of points 7#</div><div class="divider" data-v-e7dc6219></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out how many segments Petya should ride the scooter to minimize the team&#39;s total time. So, the race has 42 segments, each with checkpoints. Both Petya and Vasya start at the same time. The goal is to have the best time, which is determined by the last person to finish. First, let&#39;s recap the given information:- Petya runs a segment in 9 minutes.- Vasya runs a segment in 11 minutes.- On the scooter, either can cover a segment in 3 minutes.- The scooter can be left at any checkpoint. - They need to split the scooter usage such that one rides the first part and runs the rest, while the other does the opposite. So, one of them will ride the scooter for some segments and then run the remaining, and the other will run first and then take the scooter. The key here is to decide how many segments Petya should ride the scooter so that the maximum of their two finishing times is minimized.Let’s denote the number of segments Petya rides the scooter as x. Then, Vasya would be the one who rides the scooter for (42 - x) segments, right? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the team agreed that one will ride the first part and run the rest, and the other will run the first part and ride the rest. So, it&#39;s not necessarily that one uses the scooter for x and the other for 42 - x. Wait, but there&#39;s only one scooter. So, maybe they have to share the scooter. So the scooter can be left at checkpoints, so they can switch. For example, maybe Petya rides the scooter for x segments, leaves it at checkpoint x, and then starts running. Then Vasya could start running the first x segments, pick up the scooter at checkpoint x, and then ride the remaining (42 - x) segments? Wait, but the problem says &quot;one of them will ride the first part of the way on the scooter and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite.&quot; So perhaps one does (scooter first, then run), the other does (run first, then scooter). So the scooter is only used once by each, but they have to coordinate where to switch.Wait, but there&#39;s only one scooter. So maybe they can&#39;t both use the scooter at the same time. So if Petya starts on the scooter, he can ride it for x segments, then leave it at checkpoint x. Meanwhile, Vasya starts running, and after x segments, he picks up the scooter and rides the remaining (42 - x) segments. Alternatively, Vasya starts on the scooter, rides x segments, leaves it, then Petya runs the first x segments, picks up the scooter, and rides the rest. But the problem says that the team agreed that one will ride the first part and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite. So maybe they have to split the segments such that one uses the scooter for the first k segments and runs the rest, and the other runs the first k segments and uses the scooter for the rest. But since there&#39;s only one scooter, they have to leave it at checkpoint k so the other can pick it up. So the total distance is 42 segments. So the first person (let&#39;s say Petya) rides the scooter for k segments, which takes 3k minutes. Then he leaves the scooter at checkpoint k and runs the remaining (42 - k) segments, which takes 9*(42 - k) minutes. So his total time is 3k + 9*(42 - k).Meanwhile, Vasya starts running the first k segments. Since he runs each segment in 11 minutes, that takes 11k minutes. Then at checkpoint k, he picks up the scooter and rides the remaining (42 - k) segments, which takes 3*(42 - k) minutes. So his total time is 11k + 3*(42 - k).Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s Vasya who rides the scooter first and Petya runs first. So depending on who starts with the scooter, the roles switch. The problem states that &quot;one of them will ride the first part... while the other will do the opposite.&quot; So we need to decide whether Petya starts with the scooter or Vasya does, but the problem is asking how many segments should Petya ride on the scooter. So perhaps we can assume that Petya is the one who rides first, and Vasya runs first. So in this case, Petya&#39;s time is 3x + 9*(42 - x) and Vasya&#39;s time is 11x + 3*(42 - x). Then the total time is the maximum of these two. We need to find x (number of segments Petya rides the scooter) that minimizes this maximum.Alternatively, if Vasya is the one who rides first, then the roles would be reversed. But the problem is specifically asking how many segments should Petya ride. So maybe the question is assuming that Petya is the one who starts on the scooter, and Vasya starts running. So we need to model both possibilities? Wait, but the problem says &quot;the team agreed that one of them will ride the first part... while the other will do the opposite.&quot; So they have two options: either Petya rides first and Vasya runs first, or Vasya rides first and Petya runs first. The question is, which of these two options gives a better time, and in the optimal case, how many segments should Petya ride. Wait, but the problem says &quot;how many segments should Petya ride on the scooter to achieve the best time for the team?&quot; So perhaps they can choose who starts on the scooter, but the answer is to choose x, the number of segments Petya rides, regardless of whether he is first or second. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.Wait, perhaps the problem is structured such that regardless of who starts first, the number of segments Petya rides could be different. But the problem states that &quot;the team agreed that one of them will ride the first part... while the other will do the opposite.&quot; So the strategy is fixed in terms of roles: one is scooter then run, the other is run then scooter. But they have to decide who takes which role and how many segments each rides. However, the problem specifically asks &quot;how many segments should Petya ride on the scooter,&quot; so perhaps it&#39;s given that they have chosen the roles, and we need to find x, the number of segments Petya rides, regardless of the role. But maybe the roles can be assigned either way, and we need to determine both the assignment of roles and x to minimize the time.But the problem says &quot;the team agreed that one of them will ride the first part... while the other will do the opposite.&quot; So perhaps the roles are already decided, but the problem is not specifying which. Wait, maybe the problem is not specifying whether Petya is the one who rides first or Vasya. So perhaps we need to consider both scenarios and pick the one that gives the minimal time, then report the x accordingly.Wait, let me read the problem again:&quot;The team agreed that one of them will ride the first part of the way on the scooter and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite (the scooter can be left at any checkpoint). How many segments should Petya ride on the scooter to achieve the best time for the team?&quot;So &quot;one of them&quot; will ride first part and run the rest, &quot;the other&quot; will do the opposite. So &quot;the other&quot; will run first part and ride the rest. So the scooter is used by both, but in different parts. The key is that they leave the scooter at a checkpoint, so that the other can pick it up. Therefore, the point where they switch is the same for both. So if Petya rides the first x segments on the scooter, leaves it at checkpoint x, then runs the remaining (42 - x) segments. Meanwhile, Vasya has to run the first x segments (since the scooter is at checkpoint x), then ride the scooter from checkpoint x to the end, which is (42 - x) segments. Therefore, Vasya&#39;s time is 11x (running first x segments) + 3*(42 - x) (scooter the rest). Similarly, Petya&#39;s time is 3x (scooter) + 9*(42 - x) (running).Alternatively, if Vasya is the one who rides the scooter first for x segments, leaves it at x, then runs the rest. Then Petya would have to run the first x segments (taking 9x minutes) then ride the scooter for (42 - x) segments (3*(42 - x) minutes). Then Vasya&#39;s total time would be 3x + 11*(42 - x), and Petya&#39;s time would be 9x + 3*(42 - x).So depending on who starts on the scooter, we have two different expressions for their times. The problem is asking how many segments should Petya ride on the scooter. So if Petya is the one who starts on the scooter, then x is the number he rides. If Vasya starts on the scooter, then x would be the number Vasya rides, and Petya rides (42 - x). Wait, but the problem specifically says &quot;how many segments should Petya ride,&quot; so we need to model both scenarios: one where Petya is the one who starts on the scooter (and thus rides x segments), and the other where Vasya starts on the scooter (and Petya rides (42 - x) segments? Wait, but maybe not. Let me think.If the team decides that Petya will be the one who rides first (scooter then run) and Vasya will run then ride, then Petya rides x segments. If they decide Vasya rides first, then Vasya rides y segments, and Petya would ride (42 - y) segments. But the question is about how many segments should Petya ride, regardless of the order. So maybe the answer is the x that minimizes the maximum of the two times, considering both possibilities of who starts on the scooter.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the team can choose who starts on the scooter and the number of segments each rides. But the problem specifically says &quot;one of them will ride the first part... while the other will do the opposite.&quot; So the roles are fixed: one is scooter-first, the other is run-first. But which roles they take can be chosen to minimize the time. So perhaps we need to consider both possibilities: either Petya is scooter-first and Vasya is run-first, or Vasya is scooter-first and Petya is run-first. For each case, find the optimal x (number of segments the scooter-first person rides), then see which case gives a lower total time, and report the corresponding x for Petya.But since the question is specifically asking how many segments should Petya ride, regardless of the role, we need to check both possibilities where Petya is scooter-first (and thus rides x segments) or run-first (and thus rides (42 - x) segments). Wait, but if he is run-first, he would ride the remaining (42 - x) segments. Hmm. Let me clarify.Case 1: Petya is the one who rides the scooter first for x segments, then runs the rest. Vasya runs the first x segments, then rides the scooter for the remaining (42 - x) segments.Case 2: Vasya is the one who rides the scooter first for y segments, then runs the rest. Petya runs the first y segments, then rides the scooter for the remaining (42 - y) segments.In Case 1, Petya rides x segments. In Case 2, Petya rides (42 - y) segments. The problem is asking for the optimal x (number Petya rides), so we need to compare both cases and see which gives a better time, and then the answer would be x in Case 1 or (42 - y) in Case 2, whichever gives the minimal maximum time.Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the roles are fixed, i.e., they have already decided who is scooter-first and who is run-first, and we just need to find the optimal x. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify, so we need to consider both possibilities.Wait, let&#39;s re-read the problem statement:&quot;They start simultaneously, and the time of the last one to finish is recorded at the finish line. The team agreed that one of them will ride the first part of the way on the scooter and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite (the scooter can be left at any checkpoint). How many segments should Petya ride on the scooter to achieve the best time for the team?&quot;So they agreed on the strategy: one rides first part then runs, the other runs first part then rides. The scooter can be left at any checkpoint. So the strategy is fixed: one person does scooter-then-run, the other does run-then-scooter. But which person takes which role is part of the optimization. So to minimize the time, they can choose either:1. Petya does scooter-then-run, Vasya does run-then-scooter.2. Vasya does scooter-then-run, Petya does run-then-scooter.For each of these two scenarios, we need to find the optimal number of segments the scooter is used by the first rider (x in case 1, y in case 2), compute the maximum time for both people, and then choose the scenario with the lower maximum time. Then, the answer would be either x (if case 1 is better) or (42 - y) (if case 2 is better, since Petya would ride the scooter for (42 - y) segments in case 2).Therefore, we need to analyze both cases.Let&#39;s first analyze Case 1: Petya rides the scooter for x segments, then runs. Vasya runs first x segments, then rides.Petya&#39;s time: 3x + 9*(42 - x) = 3x + 378 - 9x = 378 - 6x.Vasya&#39;s time: 11x + 3*(42 - x) = 11x + 126 - 3x = 126 + 8x.The total time is the maximum of these two. We need to find x (integer between 0 and 42) that minimizes max(378 - 6x, 126 + 8x).To find the optimal x, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:378 - 6x = 126 + 8x378 - 126 = 8x + 6x252 = 14xx = 252 / 14 = 18.So at x=18, both times are equal:Petya: 378 - 6*18 = 378 - 108 = 270.Vasya: 126 + 8*18 = 126 + 144 = 270.So the maximum time is 270 minutes.Now, let&#39;s check Case 2: Vasya rides the scooter for y segments, then runs. Petya runs first y segments, then rides.Vasya&#39;s time: 3y + 11*(42 - y) = 3y + 462 - 11y = 462 - 8y.Petya&#39;s time: 9y + 3*(42 - y) = 9y + 126 - 3y = 126 + 6y.The total time is the maximum of these two. We need to minimize max(462 - 8y, 126 + 6y).Set them equal:462 - 8y = 126 + 6y462 - 126 = 6y + 8y336 = 14yy = 336 / 14 = 24.At y=24, both times are equal:Vasya: 462 - 8*24 = 462 - 192 = 270.Petya: 126 + 6*24 = 126 + 144 = 270.Maximum time is again 270 minutes.So in both cases, the minimal maximum time is 270 minutes. However, in Case 1, Petya rides x=18 segments. In Case 2, Petya rides (42 - y) segments. Wait, in Case 2, Petya is running the first y segments and then riding the remaining (42 - y). So the number of segments Petya rides is (42 - y). If y=24, then Petya rides 42 -24=18 segments. So in both cases, Petya rides 18 segments. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So whether they assign Petya to the scooter-first or Vasya to scooter-first, the optimal number of segments Petya rides is 18? Because in the first case, Petya is scooter-first and rides 18 segments, and in the second case, Vasya is scooter-first (rides 24 segments), which leaves Petya to ride 18 segments. So regardless of the role assignment, the number of segments Petya rides is 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.Wait, but is that accurate? Let me confirm.In Case 1, when Petya is scooter-first, he rides x=18. So answer is 18.In Case 2, when Vasya is scooter-first, Petya rides (42 - y) = 42 -24=18.Therefore, regardless of who is assigned to which role, the optimal number of segments Petya rides is 18. Hence, the answer should be 18.But let me check for non-optimal x in both cases to ensure that 18 is indeed the minimal.In Case 1: Suppose x=17.Petya&#39;s time: 378 -6*17=378 -102=276.Vasya&#39;s time:126 +8*17=126 +136=262.Max is 276.At x=18: both 270.x=19:Petya: 378 -114=264.Vasya:126 +152=278.Max=278.So indeed, x=18 gives the minimal max of 270.Similarly, in Case 2, y=24.If y=23:Vasya:462 -8*23=462 -184=278.Petya:126 +6*23=126 +138=264.Max=278.y=24: both 270.y=25:Vasya:462 -200=262.Petya:126 +150=276.Max=276.Thus, y=24 is optimal.Therefore, in both cases, the minimal maximum time is 270, achieved when x=18 (Case 1) or y=24 (Case 2). However, since in Case 2, Petya rides (42 -24)=18 segments, so either way, the number of segments Petya rides is 18. Therefore, regardless of who is assigned to which role, the optimal number of segments Petya should ride is 18.Hence, the answer is 18.Final AnswerThe number of segments Petya should ride on the scooter is boxed{18}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the optimal number of segments Petya should ride the scooter to minimize the team&#39;s total time, we need to consider two scenarios: one where Petya rides the scooter first and Vasya runs first, and the other where Vasya rides the scooter first and Petya runs first.  Case 1: Petya rides the scooter first- Petya&#39;s time: (3x + 9(42 - x) = 378 - 6x)- Vasya&#39;s time: (11x + 3(42 - x) = 126 + 8x)We need to find (x) such that the maximum of these two times is minimized. Setting the times equal:[378 - 6x = 126 + 8x]Solving for (x):[252 = 14x implies x = 18]At (x = 18), both times are 270 minutes. Case 2: Vasya rides the scooter first- Vasya&#39;s time: (3y + 11(42 - y) = 462 - 8y)- Petya&#39;s time: (9y + 3(42 - y) = 126 + 6y)We need to find (y) such that the maximum of these two times is minimized. Setting the times equal:[462 - 8y = 126 + 6y]Solving for (y):[336 = 14y implies y = 24]At (y = 24), both times are 270 minutes. Petya rides (42 - y = 18) segments.In both scenarios, the optimal number of segments Petya rides the scooter is 18. Therefore, the answer is (boxed{18}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out how many segments Petya should ride the scooter to minimize the team&#39;s total time. The problem says that the team consists of Petya, Vasya, and a scooter. They need to cover 42 segments. Each has different running and scooter speeds. The goal is to split the segments between them such that one rides the scooter for part of the way and runs the rest, while the other does the opposite. The time taken is determined by whoever finishes last. So, we need to balance their times so that both finish as close as possible, which would minimize the maximum time.First, let&#39;s note down the given data:- Total segments: 42- Petya&#39;s running time per segment: 9 minutes- Vasya&#39;s running time per segment: 11 minutes- Scooter time per segment (for either): 3 minutesThe team&#39;s strategy is that one will ride the scooter for a certain number of segments and run the rest, and the other will do the opposite. The scooter can be left at any checkpoint, which probably means they can switch who uses it at any segment boundary. But since there&#39;s only one scooter, they have to share it. Wait, but the problem says &quot;the scooter can be left at any checkpoint,&quot; so maybe one person uses the scooter for some segments, then leaves it, and the other picks it up from there? But they start at the same time. Hmm.Wait, the problem says: &quot;one of them will ride the first part of the way on the scooter and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite.&quot; So, one person starts on the scooter, rides for some segments, then leaves the scooter and continues running. The other person starts running, then picks up the scooter where it was left and rides the remaining segments. So, the scooter is only used once by each person? Wait, no. Because the problem says &quot;the scooter can be left at any checkpoint,&quot; but they have to decide in advance how many segments each will ride. Since they start at the same time, if Petya rides the scooter for &#39;k&#39; segments, he will take 3 minutes per segment for those k, then 9 minutes per segment for the remaining (42 - k). Meanwhile, Vasya would start running the first (42 - k) segments at 11 minutes per segment and then ride the scooter for the last k segments at 3 minutes per segment. Wait, is that how it&#39;s structured?Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. If Petya rides the scooter for &#39;k&#39; segments, he leaves the scooter at checkpoint k. Then Vasya, who is running, can pick up the scooter at checkpoint k and ride it from there. But since they start at the same time, how does Vasya get the scooter? If Petya is using the scooter for the first k segments, he can&#39;t leave it until he&#39;s done with those k segments. So Vasya can&#39;t use the scooter until after Petya has finished using it. But they start at the same time. Hmm, this seems conflicting.Wait, maybe the problem is that they can both use the scooter, but the scooter can only be used by one person at a time. Or maybe the scooter is a one-person scooter, so only one person can use it at any time. But since they start at the same time, how is the scooter shared? Maybe the problem allows for the scooter to be transferred between them at checkpoints, but since they start at the same time, perhaps they can only exchange the scooter at certain checkpoints. But the problem statement is a bit vague here. Let me re-read the problem.&quot;A team consisting of Petya, Vasya, and a one-person scooter is participating in a race. The distance is divided into segments of equal length, the number of which is 42, with a checkpoint at the beginning of each. Petya runs a segment in 9 minutes, Vasya in 11 minutes, and on the scooter, either of them can cover a segment in 3 minutes. They start simultaneously, and the time of the last one to finish is recorded at the finish line. The team agreed that one of them will ride the first part of the way on the scooter and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite (the scooter can be left at any checkpoint). How many segments should Petya ride on the scooter to achieve the best time for the team?&quot;So, the key here is that one person rides the scooter for the first part and runs the rest, while the other runs the first part and rides the scooter for the rest. The scooter can be left at any checkpoint, meaning that the handover point is arbitrary. So, if Petya rides the scooter for k segments, then leaves it at checkpoint k, Vasya, who is running, can pick up the scooter at checkpoint k and ride it for the remaining (42 - k) segments. Wait, but if Vasya is running the first part, he can only start using the scooter once he reaches checkpoint k. But since they start at the same time, how does this timing work?Alternatively, maybe Vasya can start running the first (42 - k) segments while Petya is riding the scooter for the first k segments, and then Vasya uses the scooter for the remaining k segments? Wait, that doesn&#39;t add up. Wait, maybe the total number of segments is 42, so if Petya rides k segments on the scooter and runs the remaining (42 - k), while Vasya runs k segments and rides the remaining (42 - k) on the scooter. Wait, that makes more sense. Because the scooter is used for k segments by Petya, then Vasya uses it for (42 - k) segments. But how does that work if they start at the same time?Wait, maybe the total distance is 42 segments. If Petya takes the scooter for k segments, then leaves it, and continues running. Meanwhile, Vasya starts running, and when he reaches the point where Petya left the scooter (segment k), he picks it up and rides the remaining (42 - k) segments. But they start at the same time. So the time it takes for Petya to ride k segments on the scooter is 3k minutes. Then he continues running the remaining (42 - k) segments, taking 9(42 - k) minutes. So his total time is 3k + 9(42 - k) minutes.Meanwhile, Vasya starts running the first k segments. Since he runs each segment in 11 minutes, this takes 11k minutes. Then he picks up the scooter at segment k and rides the remaining (42 - k) segments in 3(42 - k) minutes. So his total time is 11k + 3(42 - k) minutes.The team&#39;s total time is the maximum of Petya&#39;s time and Vasya&#39;s time. So we need to find k (number of segments Petya rides the scooter) such that the maximum of [3k + 9(42 - k), 11k + 3(42 - k)] is minimized.That makes sense. So the problem reduces to solving for k (integer between 0 and 42) to minimize the maximum of the two expressions:Petya&#39;s time: 3k + 9*(42 - k) = 3k + 378 - 9k = 378 - 6kVasya&#39;s time: 11k + 3*(42 - k) = 11k + 126 - 3k = 126 + 8kWe need to find k such that the maximum of (378 - 6k) and (126 + 8k) is as small as possible.So the two expressions are linear in k, one decreasing and the other increasing. The optimal k is where the two expressions are equal, because that&#39;s where the maximum switches from one to the other, and the minimum maximum occurs at the intersection point.Set 378 - 6k = 126 + 8k378 - 126 = 8k + 6k252 = 14kk = 252 / 14 = 18So k=18. At this point, both times would be equal:Petya: 378 -6*18=378-108=270Vasya: 126 +8*18=126+144=270So if k=18, both take 270 minutes.If k is less than 18, then Petya&#39;s time is higher (since 378 -6k would be larger), and Vasya&#39;s time is lower. The maximum would be Petya&#39;s time. If k is more than 18, then Vasya&#39;s time becomes higher, and the maximum would be Vasya&#39;s time. So the minimal maximum is achieved at k=18.But wait, the problem asks &quot;How many segments should Petya ride on the scooter to achieve the best time for the team?&quot; So the answer is 18.But let me check if k must be an integer. Since the number of segments can&#39;t be a fraction, k must be integer. In our calculation, k=18 is integer, so that&#39;s perfect.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check for k=17 and k=19.For k=17:Petya&#39;s time: 378 -6*17=378-102=276Vasya&#39;s time:126 +8*17=126+136=262Maximum is 276.For k=18:Both 270.For k=19:Petya&#39;s time:378 -6*19=378-114=264Vasya&#39;s time:126 +8*19=126+152=278Maximum is 278.So indeed, k=18 gives the minimal maximum time of 270. So Petya should ride 18 segments.But wait, the problem says &quot;one of them will ride the first part of the way on the scooter and run the rest, while the other will do the opposite&quot;. So if Petya rides the scooter for k segments, Vasya runs the first k segments and rides the scooter for the remaining. So the handover is at segment k. But the problem didn&#39;t specify who starts with the scooter. Wait, but the question is &quot;How many segments should Petya ride on the scooter&quot;, so Petya is the one who rides first part. So the model we have is correct.Alternatively, what if we considered Vasya starting with the scooter? But the problem says &quot;the team agreed that one of them will ride the first part... while the other will do the opposite&quot;. So it&#39;s either Petya starts with scooter and Vasya starts running, or vice versa. But the question specifically asks how many segments should Petya ride. So we can assume that the arrangement is Petya rides first, Vasya runs first. So our previous model holds.Therefore, the answer is 18. So I think the answer is boxed{18}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many segments Petya should ride the scooter to minimize the team&#39;s total time, we analyze the time taken by both Petya and Vasya under different scenarios. Key Information:- Total segments: 42- Petya&#39;s running time per segment: 9 minutes- Vasya&#39;s running time per segment: 11 minutes- Scooter time per segment (for either): 3 minutesStrategy:- Petya rides the scooter for ( k ) segments and runs the remaining ( 42 - k ) segments.- Vasya runs the first ( k ) segments and rides the scooter for the remaining ( 42 - k ) segments.Time Calculations:- Petya&#39;s total time: ( 3k + 9(42 - k) = 378 - 6k )- Vasya&#39;s total time: ( 11k + 3(42 - k) = 126 + 8k )We need to find ( k ) such that the maximum of these two times is minimized. Setting the two times equal to find the optimal ( k ):[378 - 6k = 126 + 8k]Solving for ( k ):[378 - 126 = 14k 252 = 14k k = 18]Verification:- For ( k = 18 ):  - Petya&#39;s time: ( 378 - 6 times 18 = 270 ) minutes  - Vasya&#39;s time: ( 126 + 8 times 18 = 270 ) minutes- For ( k = 17 ):  - Petya&#39;s time: 276 minutes  - Vasya&#39;s time: 262 minutes  - Maximum: 276 minutes- For ( k = 19 ):  - Petya&#39;s time: 264 minutes  - Vasya&#39;s time: 278 minutes  - Maximum: 278 minutesThe optimal ( k ) is 18, where both times are equal and minimized. Thus, Petya should ride the scooter for (boxed{18}) segments.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e7dc6219></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e7dc6219><span class="icon" data-v-e7dc6219>🔑:</span># Answer:18SolutionIf the time of one becomes less than the time of the other of the boys, then the time of the other will increase, and consequently, the team&#39;s time will increase.
