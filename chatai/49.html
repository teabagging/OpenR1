on a 100 times 100 board with all unit squares initially white.

After that, a legal move for Bob is to choose a row or column with at least 10 red squares and color all of the remaining squares in it red. What is thesmallest k such that Alice can set up a game in such a way that Bob can color the entire board red after finitely many moves?Proposed by [i]Nikola Velov, Macedonia[/i]</div><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. So Alice and Bob are playing this game on a 100x100 board. All squares start white, and Alice first colors exactly k squares red. Then Bob can make moves where he selects a row or column that has at least 10 red squares, and he can color all the remaining squares in that row or column red. The question is, what&#39;s the smallest k such that Alice can set up the board so that Bob can eventually color the entire board red after some finite number of moves.Hmm. So Alice needs to choose k squares in such a way that Bob can use those to trigger a chain reaction of coloring entire rows and columns. Each time Bob colors a row or column, all the remaining squares in that row or column become red. So, if he can keep doing that, he can eventually cover the entire board.The key here is that each move Bob makes requires at least 10 red squares already present in the row or column. So Alice&#39;s initial setup must have enough red squares in certain rows or columns so that Bob can start making moves. Once Bob colors a row or column, that adds more red squares, which might allow him to color other rows or columns.This seems similar to a percolation or a domino effect problem, where you need a critical mass to start the process. So the minimal k would be the number of red squares needed so that, through successive applications of Bob&#39;s moves, the entire board can be colored red.Let me think. Let&#39;s first consider how Bob can progress. Suppose Alice sets up some rows or columns with at least 10 red squares. Then Bob can color those entire rows or columns, which would then give him more red squares in the columns or rows that intersect with them. For example, if Bob colors a row red, then every column that intersects that row now has one more red square. If those columns had 9 red squares before, they now have 10, so Bob can color them. Similarly for columns.Therefore, the strategy would be to have enough initial red squares such that when Bob colors a row or column, it provides enough red squares in intersecting columns or rows to allow Bob to color those as well. So we need a way to bootstrap from the initial k red squares to the entire board.I remember similar problems where you need to cover a grid with a minimum number of seeds that can spread. For example, in a grid infection model where a cell becomes infected if a certain number of its neighbors are infected. The setup here is a bit different, though. Here, the spread happens along entire rows or columns once there&#39;s a threshold of 10 red squares in that row or column.So maybe Alice can set up a grid of red squares such that there are enough in certain rows and columns to start the process. Let&#39;s think in terms of rows and columns. Suppose Alice colors entire rows or columns, but she can&#39;t color them entirely because k has to be minimal. So she needs to color just enough in some rows and columns so that Bob can complete them.If Alice sets up 10 red squares in a row, Bob can immediately color that row. Similarly, if she sets up 10 red squares in a column, Bob can color that column. But if she spreads the red squares too thin, with less than 10 in any row or column, Bob can&#39;t make any moves. So Alice needs to arrange at least 10 red squares in some rows or columns so that Bob can start.But if she just does 10 red squares in one row, Bob can color that row, which gives 100 red squares in that row. Then, each column intersecting that row now has 1 red square. But 1 is less than 10, so Bob can&#39;t color any columns. So that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, if she sets up 10 red squares in each of 10 different rows, that&#39;s 100 red squares. Then Bob can color each of those 10 rows, turning them all red. Then, each column will have 10 red squares (one from each of the 10 rows), so Bob can then color every column, completing the board. But that requires k = 100. However, maybe we can do better.Wait, maybe Alice can interleave rows and columns. For example, if she sets up 10 red squares in some rows and 10 in some columns, such that when Bob colors those rows, it gives enough red squares in the columns to color them, which in turn gives more red squares in other rows, etc.Alternatively, maybe a checkerboard pattern? But 10 is a high threshold.Wait, another approach: suppose Alice colors 10 squares in each of 10 columns. So 10 columns with 10 red squares each. That&#39;s k = 100. Then Bob can color those 10 columns entirely red. Once those 10 columns are red, then each row has 10 red squares (from the 10 columns), so Bob can color all rows. Then once all rows are colored, the entire board is red. So that&#39;s k = 100. But is this the minimal?But maybe you don&#39;t need 10 full columns. Suppose instead, Alice colors 10 squares in each of 10 rows and 10 columns, but overlapping? For instance, arranging the red squares at intersections of certain rows and columns. If each of 10 rows has 10 red squares, and each of 10 columns also has 10 red squares, but the red squares are at the intersections, then k would be 100 (10 rows x 10) but overlapping with 10 columns x 10. Wait, but if they overlap, the total number of red squares is 10x10 = 100. Wait, no. If you have 10 rows and 10 columns, and the red squares are at their intersections, that&#39;s a 10x10 grid, which is 100 squares. So in this case, each of the 10 rows has 10 red squares (the intersection with the 10 columns), and each of the 10 columns also has 10 red squares. So Bob can first color those 10 rows, each of which has 10 red squares. Coloring those 10 rows would make all 100 squares in each row red. Then, the 10 columns that originally had 10 red squares now have 100 red squares each, but actually, they already have 10 red squares from the original setup. Wait, no. If Alice colored a 10x10 grid at the intersection of 10 rows and 10 columns, then each of those 10 rows has 10 red squares, and each of those 10 columns has 10 red squares. So Bob can choose to color either the 10 rows or the 10 columns first.If he colors the 10 rows first, then each of those rows becomes entirely red. Then, for the 10 columns, each column now has 10 red squares (from the original 10x10 grid) plus 90 more from the colored rows. Wait, no. If the columns are separate from the rows, but in the case of the 10x10 grid, each column in the original 10 columns already has 10 red squares. If Bob colors the 10 rows first, each of those rows becomes entirely red, which means the 10 columns that were originally with 10 red squares now have 100 red squares each. But since they were already in the initial 10 columns, maybe this is overlapping.Wait, maybe I need to visualize this. Suppose we have a 10x10 grid in the top-left corner. So rows 1-10 and columns 1-10. Each of these rows has 10 red squares in columns 1-10, and each of these columns has 10 red squares in rows 1-10. So k = 100. Then Bob can color rows 1-10, each of which has 10 red squares. Coloring those rows would make all 100 squares in each of these rows red. Then, columns 1-10 now each have 100 red squares (since the entire rows 1-10 are red). But Bob can color columns 1-10, but they are already all red. Then, what about the rest of the board? The rows 11-100 and columns 11-100. The problem is that after coloring rows 1-10, columns 1-10 are fully red, but the other columns (11-100) still only have the red squares from rows 1-10, which is 10 red squares each. Wait, no. If Bob colors rows 1-10, then all columns that intersect with those rows will have 10 red squares each (since each column has 10 red squares from the colored rows). So columns 1-100 each have 10 red squares (from the 10 rows). Therefore, Bob can then color any column, since each column has 10 red squares. So after coloring all rows 1-10, Bob can color all columns 1-100. Coloring a column would turn all remaining squares in that column red. But after coloring rows 1-10, the columns 1-10 are already fully red, but columns 11-100 have 10 red squares each (from the 10 rows). So Bob can color columns 11-100, which will turn all the remaining squares in those columns red. However, those columns have 10 red squares in rows 1-10, and 90 white squares in rows 11-100. So coloring those columns would color the remaining 90 squares in each column red. Then, once all columns are colored, the entire board is red. So with k = 100, this works.But the question is, can we do this with fewer than 100? Maybe. Let&#39;s see. Because if Alice can arrange the red squares in such a way that after Bob colors some rows and columns, the number of red squares in other rows and columns increases beyond 10, allowing a chain reaction.Suppose instead of a 10x10 grid, Alice arranges the red squares in a more efficient pattern. For example, if she sets up some rows with 10 red squares each, but overlapping in columns. Then, when Bob colors those rows, the columns get multiple red squares. If each column gets 10 red squares from different rows, then Bob can color the columns, which in turn color other rows.Wait, let&#39;s formalize this. Let&#39;s say Alice sets up m rows each with 10 red squares. The total number of red squares is 10m. Then Bob can color those m rows, which will color all the squares in those rows. Then, each column that intersects with these m rows will have m red squares. If m is at least 10, then each column has m red squares. So if m &gt;=10, then each column has at least 10 red squares, so Bob can color all columns, which would color the remaining squares. Therefore, if Alice sets up 10 rows with 10 red squares each (total k=100), Bob can color the 10 rows, then all columns, which would color the entire board. So that&#39;s the previous case.But if Alice can set up m rows and n columns such that after coloring those rows, the columns have enough red squares, and vice versa, then perhaps a smaller k is possible.Wait, suppose Alice sets up 10 red squares in each of 10 rows, but arranges them so that each column has only 1 red square. Then, after coloring those 10 rows, each column would have 10 red squares (1 from each of the 10 rows). Then Bob can color all columns, which would color the remaining 90 squares in each column. Then, after coloring all columns, all the remaining rows (which are 90 rows) would have 100 red squares each (from the columns), so Bob can color those rows as well. Wait, but once all columns are colored, the entire board is already colored. So in this case, k = 10 rows * 10 red squares = 100. But actually, arranging 10 red squares in each of 10 rows such that each column has only 1 red square would require that the red squares are spread across different columns. That is, in each row, the 10 red squares are in distinct columns. So for 10 rows, each with 10 unique columns, you need 10*10=100 columns, but the board only has 100 columns. Wait, so if you spread the red squares in 10 rows such that each row has 10 red squares in 10 distinct columns, and each column is used only once per row, then you would need 10*10=100 columns. Which is exactly the number of columns available. Therefore, this is possible. So for each of the 10 rows, assign 10 unique columns, so that each column is used exactly once. Therefore, each column has exactly 10 red squares (one from each of the 10 rows). Wait, no. Each column would have 10 red squares if each of the 10 rows has a red square in that column. But if the red squares in each row are in distinct columns, such that each column is only used once per row, but since there are 10 rows, each column would have 10 red squares. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think. If you have 10 rows, each with 10 red squares in distinct columns. Since there are 100 columns, if each row uses 10 unique columns, then across 10 rows, you can cover 10*10=100 columns. Therefore, each column is used exactly once. Therefore, each column has exactly 1 red square. Because each column is only used by one row. Therefore, after coloring the 10 rows, each column would have 1 red square from the initial setup plus 10 red squares from the colored rows? Wait, no. Wait, no. If Alice sets up 10 red squares in each of 10 rows, each in distinct columns (so that each column has exactly one red square across all rows), then when Bob colors those 10 rows, each column will have 10 red squares (since each column is covered by one row, and coloring that row makes the entire column have 1 red square initially, but then coloring the row adds the other 99? Wait, this is getting confusing.Wait, let&#39;s clarify:Case 1: Alice colors 10 rows fully red. Then k = 10*100 = 1000, which is way too big. Not helpful.Case 2: Alice colors 10 red squares in each of 10 rows, but spreads them across different columns. For example, in row 1, columns 1-10; row 2, columns 11-20; ..., row 10, columns 91-100. Then each of these 10 rows has 10 red squares, and each column in 1-100 has exactly 1 red square (from one of the rows). So k = 10*10 = 100. Then Bob can color those 10 rows, which will turn all 100 squares in each of those rows red. After that, each column has 10 red squares (1 from the initial setup and 9 more from the colored rows? Wait, no. Wait, originally, each column had 1 red square from Alice&#39;s setup. Then, when Bob colors the 10 rows, each of those rows is entirely red. So for columns that are in the segments 1-10, 11-20, etc., they are fully colored because their respective rows are colored. Wait, no. If row 1 is colored, then columns 1-10 in row 1 are colored, but columns 11-100 in row 1 were already white, but since Bob colors the entire row, columns 11-100 in row 1 would also be colored red. Wait, but in this setup, Alice had colored columns 1-10 in row 1 red, but Bob coloring the entire row would color columns 1-100 in row 1 red. So after Bob colors the 10 rows, those rows are entirely red. Then, for the columns: columns 1-10 have 10 red squares (from row 1), columns 11-20 have 10 red squares (from row 2), etc. So each column in 1-100 has 10 red squares from one row. Therefore, Bob can then color all columns. Because each column has 10 red squares. Wait, but actually, each column has 10 red squares in their respective rows. For example, column 1 has 10 red squares in row 1, column 11 has 10 red squares in row 2, etc. Wait, no. If Bob colors row 1, then column 1-10 will have 100 red squares each (since the entire row is colored). Wait, no. If row 1 is colored, then column 1 will have 1 red square from row 1, and the rest of the column (rows 2-100) were initially white. But when Bob colors row 1, he colors all remaining squares in row 1 red. But if Alice already colored 10 squares in row 1, then Bob colors the remaining 90 squares in row 1. So after Bob colors row 1, row 1 is entirely red. Then, column 1, which had 1 red square from row 1, now has 1 red square. Wait, that&#39;s not right. Wait, if Alice colored 10 squares in row 1 (columns 1-10), then column 1 has 1 red square (from row 1). Then, when Bob colors row 1, the entire row 1 becomes red, so column 1 now has 1 red square (from Alice&#39;s setup) plus the remaining 99 squares in column 1 (rows 2-100) are still white. Wait, no. Wait, Bob&#39;s move is to choose a row or column with at least 10 red squares and color all remaining squares in it red. So if Alice colored 10 squares in row 1, then Bob can color row 1 because it has 10 red squares. Coloring row 1 would color all remaining 90 squares in row 1 red. So column 1, which previously had 1 red square (from row 1), now still has 1 red square in column 1 (since only row 1 was colored). The rest of column 1 (rows 2-100) are still white. Wait, so coloring a row only affects that row. Similarly, coloring a column affects that column.Therefore, in this setup where Alice has 10 rows with 10 red squares each, spread out so that each column has at most 1 red square, when Bob colors those 10 rows, each column will have 1 red square. But 1 is less than 10, so Bob cannot color the columns. So that approach doesn&#39;t work.Hmm. So maybe the initial idea of having a 10x10 grid where Alice colors 10 rows and 10 columns with overlapping red squares is better. Let&#39;s think again.Suppose Alice colors a 10x10 subgrid in the corner. So rows 1-10 and columns 1-10 each have 10 red squares. Wait, no. If she colors the intersection of rows 1-10 and columns 1-10, that&#39;s a 10x10 grid, so 100 red squares. Each row in 1-10 has 10 red squares, each column in 1-10 has 10 red squares. Then Bob can color rows 1-10. After coloring those rows, each column in 1-10 has 100 red squares (the entire column is colored). Then, columns 1-10 are fully colored. Then, for the remaining columns (11-100), each has 10 red squares from the initial 10 rows. Wait, no. If Bob colors rows 1-10, then columns 1-10 will have those rows colored, but columns 11-100 will only have the red squares from the initial setup, which is zero. Wait, no. Wait, in the 10x10 grid, Alice colored rows 1-10 and columns 1-10. So in columns 11-100, there are no red squares. Therefore, after coloring rows 1-10, columns 11-100 still have zero red squares, so Bob can&#39;t color them. Therefore, that approach only gets columns 1-10 colored, but the rest of the board is still white.So that&#39;s not helpful. So maybe we need a different strategy.Wait, here&#39;s another idea. If Alice can arrange the red squares in such a way that each row and each column has at least 10 red squares, then Bob can color all rows and columns immediately. But that would require each row having at least 10 red squares and each column having at least 10 red squares. The minimal k for that would be something like 10*100, but arranged so that each row and column has 10. Wait, but 10 per row would be 1000, which is way too big.Alternatively, if we can cover the board with red squares such that every row and column has at least 10 red squares, but with overlapping. The minimal number would be max(10*100, 10*100) but with overlapping. But actually, in a bipartite graph, the minimal number to cover all rows and columns with at least 10 red squares is 10*100 if they don&#39;t overlap, but since they can overlap, the minimal is 100*10 - something, but actually, it&#39;s 100*10 if you arrange them in rows, but if arranged in both rows and columns, you can do better? Wait, no, because if you have to have each row with at least 10, it&#39;s 10*100. But if you also have each column with at least 10, you can do it with 10*100 if 10*100 &gt;= 10*100, which it is. But actually, it&#39;s a covering problem. The minimal k is the maximum between the row covering and column covering. But since both require 10*100, but if you arrange 10 per row, you automatically get some coverage on columns. The minimal k is actually the maximum of 10*100 and 10*100, but since they are equal, it&#39;s 1000. But that&#39;s obviously too much, so this approach is wrong.Wait, no. The problem is not that every row and column must have 10 red squares initially. The problem is that Alice needs to set up k red squares so that Bob can perform a sequence of moves to color the entire board. So Bob can create new red squares by coloring rows or columns that have at least 10 red squares.Therefore, Alice&#39;s setup needs to allow Bob to perform moves that increase the number of red squares until the entire board is red. The key is that each move by Bob can turn a large number of white squares red, provided that there&#39;s a row or column with at least 10 red squares.So perhaps the minimal k is 10*10=100, arranged in a 10x10 grid. Then Bob can color the 10 rows or 10 columns of that grid. Wait, but as we saw earlier, coloring the 10 rows would only affect those rows, not the columns. So maybe not.Alternatively, if Alice arranges 10 red squares in each of 10 columns. So 10 columns with 10 red squares each. Total k=100. Then Bob can color those 10 columns, turning them all red. Then, each row that intersects with those 10 columns now has 10 red squares, so Bob can color all rows. Then coloring all rows would color the entire board. Let&#39;s verify this.Suppose Alice sets up 10 columns (say columns 1-10) with 10 red squares each. So in each column 1-10, there are 10 red squares somewhere. The rest of the board is white. Bob can then color each of these 10 columns because each has 10 red squares. Coloring a column means turning all remaining squares in that column red. Since each column initially has 10 red squares, coloring it would turn 90 squares red. After coloring all 10 columns, columns 1-10 are entirely red. Then, in each row, there are 10 red squares (one in each of the 10 columns). Therefore, Bob can now color every row. Coloring a row would turn all remaining squares in that row red. Since each row already has 10 red squares (from the 10 columns), coloring it would turn 90 squares red. After coloring all rows, the entire board is red. So this works with k=100.But is 100 the minimal k? Let&#39;s see if we can do it with fewer. Suppose instead of 10 columns with 10 red squares each, we have fewer columns but more red squares per column. Wait, but each column needs at least 10 red squares for Bob to color it. So if we have, say, 9 columns with 12 red squares each, totaling 108. Then Bob can color those 9 columns, but 9 columns * 12 red squares = 108. Then, after coloring those 9 columns, each row would have 9 red squares, which is less than 10, so Bob can&#39;t color the rows. So that doesn&#39;t help.Alternatively, if we have 11 columns with 10 red squares each, totaling 110. Then Bob can color the 11 columns, and each row would have 11 red squares. Then Bob can color all rows. But this uses more k, so not helpful.Alternatively, maybe overlapping columns and rows. For example, arrange red squares so that some columns and rows overlap, allowing Bob to color both rows and columns in a sequence.Suppose Alice sets up a grid where certain rows and columns have 10 red squares, such that coloring a row allows columns to be colored, which in turn allow more rows to be colored, etc. For example, if we have a set of rows each with 10 red squares in certain columns, and those columns, when colored, give 10 red squares in other rows.But designing such a configuration is tricky. Let&#39;s think in terms of a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and a red square is an edge. Then, the problem reduces to finding a minimal set of edges such that iteratively adding all edges from a row or column once it has 10 edges.This is similar to a bootstrap percolation problem on a bipartite graph with threshold 10. The question is, what&#39;s the minimal number of initial edges so that all nodes (rows and columns) become active (fully connected).In bootstrap percolation, the usual results depend on the graph structure. For a complete bipartite graph, which is our grid, the threshold is such that if each node needs at least t neighbors active to become active. But in our case, rows and columns can be activated (colored) if they have at least 10 red squares (edges). Once activated, all edges in that row or column are added.So we need a minimal initial set of edges such that activating these allows the activation of all rows and columns.Some research exists on bootstrap percolation in grids, but I&#39;m not sure of the exact results. However, maybe we can reason it through.Suppose we have r rows and c columns initially each with 10 red squares. The total number of red squares would be 10(r + c) - overlaps. If the red squares are arranged so that the overlaps are minimized, then the total k is 10(r + c). To cover all rows and columns, we need that after activating these r rows and c columns, the remaining rows and columns can be activated.Wait, no. Because activating a row or column requires that it has 10 red squares. So the initial red squares must be arranged so that some rows or columns can be activated, and their activation leads to other rows or columns getting enough red squares.Alternatively, think of it as a two-stage process. First, Alice places some red squares. Then, Bob can activate rows or columns with at least 10 red squares, which adds more red squares. The goal is for the entire board to be activated.This is similar to the problem of influencing a graph through a threshold model. Each row and column is a node with threshold 10. The question is, what&#39;s the minimal number of initially active nodes (red squares) such that all nodes become active.But in our case, the nodes are the rows and columns, and activating a row or column requires that at least 10 of its squares are active (red). However, activating a row or column causes all its squares to become active. So it&#39;s a bit different because the activation of a row or column affects both the row and column nodes.Wait, maybe this is overcomplicating. Let&#39;s think of it in terms of the original problem. The key idea is that when Bob colors a row, he adds 100 - (number of initially red squares in that row) red squares. Similarly for a column.So, if we can find a way that after some rows and columns are colored, the number of red squares in other rows and columns increases beyond 10, allowing a chain reaction.Suppose Alice sets up 10 red squares in each of 10 rows and 10 red squares in each of 10 columns, arranged so that the intersections of these rows and columns have red squares. For example, imagine a 10x10 grid where the 10 rows and 10 columns each have 10 red squares at their intersections. Then, k = 10*10 + 10*10 - 10*10 = 100. Wait, because the intersections are counted twice. So total red squares would be 10*10 + 10*10 - 10*10 = 100. So that&#39;s 100 again.Then, Bob can color the 10 rows, which would add 90 red squares to each row. Then, the 10 columns, which already had 10 red squares each, now have 10 red squares from the original setup plus 10 red squares from the colored rows (since each column intersects with 10 rows). Wait, no. If the 10 columns each had 10 red squares initially, and after coloring the 10 rows, each column now has 10 (original) + 10 (from the colored rows) = 20 red squares. Wait, but actually, coloring a row turns all its squares red. So if a column had 10 red squares initially, and one of the rows that was colored intersects with this column, then the column now has 10 + 1 (from the colored row) = 11 red squares? Wait, no. If a column has 10 red squares initially, and a row that is colored intersects the column in one square (which was already red), then coloring the row doesn&#39;t change the number of red squares in the column. Because that square was already red.Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. If Alice has a red square at the intersection of a row and a column, then coloring that row or column doesn&#39;t affect the count in the other. So if a column has 10 red squares, some of which are in rows that are colored, then when those rows are colored, the red squares in the column remain 10. Because the other squares in the column (not in the colored rows) are still white. Unless the column is colored.This is getting really confusing. Let&#39;s maybe think of a smaller example. Let&#39;s consider a 2x2 grid where the threshold is 1. So Alice needs to color some squares so that Bob can color rows or columns with at least 1 red square. Then, the minimal k would be 1, because Alice can color one square, Bob can color its row or column, which colors the rest.But in our problem, the threshold is 10. So, in a 100x100 grid, to color a row or column, you need at least 10 red squares in it. Then, once you color it, the entire row or column becomes red. So the question is, what&#39;s the minimal k such that Alice can set up red squares so that Bob can iteratively color rows and columns to eventually cover the entire board.From the previous example with 10 columns each with 10 red squares, k=100, Bob can color those columns, then color all rows. So that works. Similarly, if Alice sets up 10 rows with 10 red squares each, same thing.But maybe we can do better by having overlapping rows and columns. For example, if some red squares are in both a row and a column that can be colored, thereby reducing the total number needed.Suppose Alice creates a grid where some red squares are shared between rows and columns. For example, if she has a set of rows each with 10 red squares, and a set of columns each with 10 red squares, overlapping in such a way that the intersection squares count towards both. Then, the total k would be 10*(number of rows + number of columns) - overlaps.But to minimize k, we need to maximize overlaps. The maximum possible overlaps would be if each red square is counted in both a row and a column. So, if we have r rows and c columns, each with 10 red squares, and the intersections between these rows and columns are all red squares, then the total k is 10r + 10c - 10*min(r,c). Assuming r=c=10, then k=10*10 +10*10 -10*10=100. So same as before.But if we use fewer rows and columns, but more overlaps. For example, if we use 19 rows and 19 columns, each with 10 red squares, overlapping in a 10x10 grid. Wait, this might not make sense.Alternatively, think in terms of a grid where we have a core of red squares, and then build out from there. For example, if Alice colors a 10x10 grid in the corner, then Bob can color those 10 rows and 10 columns. Wait, but as discussed earlier, that doesn&#39;t help because the other columns don&#39;t get enough red squares.Wait, another approach: what if Alice arranges the red squares such that each red square is in both a row and a column that can be eventually colored. So, for example, if Alice has a diagonal of red squares, each in a different row and column. But 10 red squares on the diagonal would allow Bob to color those 10 rows and columns, but each such row and column only has 1 red square, which is less than 10. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, arrange blocks of 10 red squares in such a way that each block is in a row and a column. For example, if you have a 10x10 block, then 10 rows and 10 columns each have 10 red squares. Then Bob can color those rows and columns, but again, this is the same as before, requiring k=100.Wait, maybe the minimal k is actually 100. Because if you consider that to color a single column, you need at least 10 red squares in it. If you want to color all 100 columns, you would need at least 10*100=1000 red squares. But since coloring a column can help with coloring rows, which in turn help with other columns, maybe you can get away with less.But in the previous example, with k=100, you can color 10 columns, which then allow you to color all rows, which then color all columns. So the key is that by coloring 10 columns, you give each row 10 red squares, so then you can color all rows, which then give all columns 100 red squares. So total k=100.But can we do it with less than 100? Let&#39;s try to see. Suppose Alice uses 99 red squares. Is there a way to arrange 99 red squares so that Bob can still color the entire board?If Alice arranges 9 rows with 10 red squares each and 9 columns with 10 red squares each, overlapping as much as possible. The maximum overlap would be a 9x9 grid, so 81 red squares. Then the total k would be 9*10 + 9*10 - 81 = 180 -81=99. So k=99. Then, Bob can color the 9 rows and 9 columns. However, after coloring the 9 rows, each column that was part of the 9 columns now has 9 red squares (from the rows) plus the initial 10 in the column. Wait, no. If the columns have 10 red squares initially, overlapping with the rows. Let&#39;s think.If we have 9 rows and 9 columns, each with 10 red squares, arranged so that their intersection is a 9x9 grid (81 red squares). Then, the total red squares are 9*10 + 9*10 - 81 = 99. So the 9 rows each have 10 red squares: 9 in the intersection with the 9 columns, and 1 extra in another column. Similarly, the 9 columns each have 10 red squares: 9 in the intersection with the 9 rows, and 1 extra in another row.Then, Bob can color the 9 rows. Each of those rows has 10 red squares. Coloring them would turn the remaining 90 squares in each row red. Then, the 9 columns that were initially set up now have 9 red squares (from the intersection) plus 1 extra, which was in another row. Wait, no. The columns had 10 red squares initially: 9 in the intersection and 1 extra. After coloring the 9 rows, the 9 columns now have their 9 red squares from the intersection turned into full rows, so the columns have 9 full rows colored, which gives them 9*100=900 red squares. Wait, no. If a column is in the initial 9 columns, it had 10 red squares: 9 in the intersection and 1 elsewhere. After coloring the 9 rows, the 9 rows are entirely red. So in the 9 columns, the 9 rows that were colored intersect the columns, giving 9 red squares per column. But the columns already had 1 extra red square, so total 10. Therefore, Bob can color the 9 columns. Coloring the columns would turn the remaining 91 squares in each column red. Then, after coloring the columns, each row outside the initial 9 rows has 9 red squares (from the 9 columns). But 9 is less than 10, so Bob cannot color those rows. Therefore, this setup with k=99 doesn&#39;t work because after coloring the initial 9 rows and 9 columns, the remaining rows and columns don&#39;t have enough red squares.Therefore, k=99 is insufficient.What about k=100? With k=100, as in the previous example, 10 columns with 10 red squares each. Bob colors the 10 columns, resulting in each row having 10 red squares, allowing all rows to be colored, hence the entire board. So k=100 works.But is there a way to do it with, say, 190? Wait, no. Wait, 100 is less than 190, so 100 is better. But the question is asking for the minimal k.Wait, but let&#39;s verify with k=100. If Alice sets up 10 columns with 10 red squares each, that&#39;s 100 red squares. Bob colors those 10 columns, turning all remaining squares in those columns red. Wait, no. Bob&#39;s move is to choose a column with at least 10 red squares and color all remaining squares in it red. So if a column has 10 red squares, coloring it will turn the remaining 90 squares red. So after Bob colors the 10 columns, each of those columns is fully red. Then, in each row, there are 10 red squares (one in each of the 10 columns). Therefore, Bob can color all rows. Coloring a row will turn all remaining squares in the row red. Since each row already has 10 red squares (from the 10 columns), coloring it will add 90 red squares. After coloring all rows, the entire board is red. Therefore, k=100 is sufficient.But could we do it with fewer? For example, if Alice arranges the red squares in a way that some columns can be colored with overlapping benefits.Wait, suppose Alice sets up 10 red squares in each of 9 columns, and 10 red squares in a 10th column. Wait, that would be 9*10 +10=100. So same as before. Alternatively, if she overlaps some.Wait, another idea: use a smaller number of columns but have more red squares per column. For example, if Alice sets up 20 columns with 5 red squares each. Total k=100. Then Bob can&#39;t color any columns because they have only 5 red squares. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, 50 columns with 2 red squares each. Still k=100, but Bob can&#39;t color any columns. So that&#39;s worse.Alternatively, 10 columns with 10 red squares each: k=100, which works.Alternatively, 11 columns with 9 red squares each: k=99, which we saw doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, it seems that k=100 is the minimal.Wait, but let&#39;s check with a different configuration. Suppose Alice sets up 10 rows with 10 red squares each, but arranged such that each column has exactly 1 red square. Then, k=100. Then, Bob can color the 10 rows, which would make those 10 rows entirely red. Then, each column has 10 red squares (1 from the initial setup and 9 from the colored rows). Wait, no. If each column had 1 red square from the initial setup (from one of the 10 rows), then when Bob colors those 10 rows, each column will have 1 red square from the initial setup and 90 from the colored rows. Wait, no. If a column had 1 red square in one of the 10 rows, then coloring that row would make the entire row red, so the column now has 100 red squares in that row. Wait, no. Each column has 100 squares. If one of them is in a colored row, then that column has 1 red square from the colored row. The rest are still white. So each column has 1 red square after coloring the 10 rows. Which is less than 10, so Bob can&#39;t color the columns. Hence, this approach doesn&#39;t work. So arranging 10 rows with 10 red squares each, spread out so each column has 1, doesn&#39;t work. So k=100 must be arranged in columns, not rows.But when arranged in columns, as we saw, k=100 works. So perhaps 100 is indeed the minimal.Alternatively, what if Alice uses both rows and columns? For example, 5 rows with 10 red squares each and 5 columns with 10 red squares each. Total k=5*10 +5*10=100. If arranged so that the 5 rows and 5 columns intersect in a 5x5 grid, then the total red squares would be 5*10 +5*10 -5*5=100 -25=75. Wait, but this is only 75. Then Bob can color the 5 rows and 5 columns. After coloring the 5 rows, the 5 columns each have 5 red squares from the rows and their original 10 -5=5 red squares elsewhere. Wait, no. If the columns had 10 red squares initially, 5 of which are in the 5 rows. Then coloring the 5 rows would color those 5 squares in each column, but the columns already had 10 red squares. Wait, this is confusing.Let me detail this:If Alice colors 5 rows with 10 red squares each and 5 columns with 10 red squares each, arranged so that the intersection of these rows and columns is a 5x5 grid. So each of the 5 rows has 10 red squares: 5 in the 5 columns and 5 elsewhere. Each of the 5 columns has 10 red squares: 5 in the 5 rows and 5 elsewhere. Total red squares: 5*10 +5*10 -5*5=100 -25=75. So k=75.Then, Bob can first color the 5 rows. Each row has 10 red squares, 5 in the columns and 5 elsewhere. After coloring a row, all 100 squares in the row are red. Therefore, coloring the 5 rows turns 5*100=500 squares red. However, the initial red squares were 75, so overlapping. Wait, but after coloring the 5 rows, those rows are entirely red. Then, the 5 columns that were initially set up with 10 red squares now have 5 full rows intersecting them, which are red. So in each column, the 5 rows that are colored contribute 5 red squares, and the initial 5 red squares elsewhere in the column are still there. So each column now has 5 (from colored rows) +5 (initial) =10 red squares. Therefore, Bob can now color the 5 columns. Coloring each column turns all remaining squares in the column red. After coloring the 5 columns, those columns are entirely red. Then, each row outside the initial 5 rows has 5 red squares from the colored columns. 5 is less than 10, so Bob can&#39;t color them. Wait, but the rows outside the initial 5 rows: each has 5 red squares from the 5 columns. So insufficient. Hence, this setup with k=75 doesn&#39;t work.But maybe after coloring the 5 columns, which are now fully red, the remaining columns (95) each have 5 red squares from the 5 rows. Still insufficient. So this approach only gets 5 rows and 5 columns colored, but the rest remains.Therefore, k=75 is insufficient.Alternatively, if we increase the number. Suppose we have 9 rows and 9 columns arranged similarly. Then, total red squares would be 9*10 +9*10 -9*9=180-81=99. As before, this gives k=99. But Bob can color the 9 rows, leading to 9 columns having 9+1=10 red squares, allowing him to color the 9 columns, leading to other rows having 9 red squares, which is insufficient. So same problem.Therefore, the key is that to get the remaining rows after coloring some columns, you need those rows to have 10 red squares. Which requires that the number of colored columns times the number of red squares per column in those rows is at least 10. But if you color c columns, each contributing 1 red square to a row, then you need c &gt;=10. So c=10.Therefore, if Alice sets up 10 columns with 10 red squares each, Bob can color those 10 columns, resulting in each row having 10 red squares (1 from each column), allowing Bob to color all rows, hence the entire board. This requires k=10*10=100.Similarly, if Alice sets up 10 rows with 10 red squares each, Bob can color those rows, resulting in each column having 10 red squares (1 from each row), allowing him to color all columns. Hence, k=100.Therefore, it seems that k=100 is necessary. Because to ensure that after coloring 10 columns, each row has 10 red squares, each column must contribute 1 red square to each row. Which requires that the columns are spread out so that each row has one red square from each column. Which requires that the red squares are arranged in a 10x10 grid where each row and column has exactly 10 red squares. But in reality, arranging 10 columns with 10 red squares each, spread out so that each row has one red square from each column, would require that each column has one red square in each row. Which is impossible, since there are 100 rows and only 10 columns.Wait, no. If you have 10 columns with 10 red squares each, and you spread the red squares in each column across 10 different rows, then each row would have 10 red squares (one from each column). Therefore, this is possible. For example, if each column has its 10 red squares in rows 1-10, then each row 1-10 has 10 red squares. But rows 11-100 have none. So Bob can color rows 1-10, then columns 1-10 (which already have 10 red squares), but this doesn&#39;t help rows 11-100.Wait, confusion arises again.Let me try again. Suppose Alice arranges 10 columns, each with 10 red squares. For each column, the 10 red squares are placed in 10 distinct rows, such that each row has exactly one red square from each column. This would require 10 columns * 10 rows = 100 rows, but the board only has 100 rows. So, yes, it&#39;s possible. For example, column 1 has red squares in rows 1-10, column 2 in rows 11-20, ..., column 10 in rows 91-100. Then, each column has 10 red squares in 10 distinct rows. Then, Bob can color the 10 columns, which are each turned red. Then, each row has 10 red squares (one from each column). Therefore, Bob can color all rows, coloring the entire board. This works with k=100.Alternatively, if Alice arranges the 10 columns such that their red squares are spread across all rows. For example, column 1 has red squares in rows 1-10, column 2 in rows 2-11, ..., column 10 in rows 10-19. But this would cause overlapping rows, leading to some rows having more than one red square from different columns. But the key is that as long as each row has at least 10 red squares from the colored columns. Wait, but if the columns are colored first, then each row will have as many red squares as the number of colored columns that intersect it. If the columns are arranged so that each row is intersected by exactly 10 columns, then each row will have 10 red squares. This is possible if the 10 columns each have their 10 red squares in distinct rows, covering all 100 rows. But with 10 columns, each with 10 red squares, you can cover 100 rows by assigning each column to 10 unique rows. Therefore, each row is covered by exactly one column. Therefore, when the columns are colored, each row has one red square. But one is less than 10, so this doesn&#39;t work.Ah, here&#39;s the mistake. If the columns are colored first, each column has 10 red squares. When Bob colors a column, all remaining squares in that column become red. So if a column has 10 red squares in 10 rows, coloring the column would color the remaining 90 rows in that column. Therefore, after coloring the 10 columns, each column is fully red. Then, each row has 10 red squares (one from each of the 10 columns). Therefore, Bob can color all rows. Hence, this works with k=100.Therefore, the minimal k is 100. But to confirm that it&#39;s indeed minimal, we need to check if k=99 is possible. Suppose Alice uses 99 red squares. If she tries to arrange them in 10 columns with 10 red squares each, that would require 100 red squares. So she can only arrange 9 columns with 10 red squares each (90 red squares) and 9 red squares left over. If she adds 9 more red squares in a 10th column, making it 9+9=18 red squares in that column, but 18 is more than 10. However, Bob can color that 10th column immediately, turning the remaining squares red. Wait, but the 10th column has 18 red squares initially? No, Alice can only color k squares. If she uses 90 in 9 columns (10 each), and 9 in a 10th column, that&#39;s a total of 99. So the 10th column has 9 red squares. Then, Bob cannot color any columns initially, since the first 9 columns have 10 red squares each, but the 10th has 9. So Bob can color the first 9 columns. After coloring those 9 columns, each row has 9 red squares (one from each column), which is less than 10. The 10th column still has 9 red squares, which is less than 10. So Bob can&#39;t color anything else. Therefore, k=99 is insufficient.Therefore, the minimal k is indeed 100.Final AnswerThe smallest ( k ) is (boxed{100}).&lt;/think&gt;Alice and Bob play a game on a (100 times 100) board where Alice initially colors exactly (k) unit squares red. Bob can then color all remaining squares in a row or column if it has at least 10 red squares. The goal is to determine the smallest (k) such that Bob can eventually color the entire board red.Key steps and reasoning:1. Initial Setup: Alice needs to color (k) squares such that Bob can start a chain reaction to color the entire board. Each row or column Bob colors must have at least 10 red squares initially.2. Critical Mass: For Bob to color a row or column, it must initially have at least 10 red squares. Coloring a row or column then turns all remaining squares in it red, which can help in coloring other rows and columns.3. Efficient Configuration: If Alice colors 10 columns with 10 red squares each, Bob can color these columns first. Each column will then be fully red, contributing 10 red squares to each row (one from each column). This allows Bob to color all rows, which in turn color all remaining columns.4. Verification: If (k = 100), Alice can set up 10 columns with 10 red squares each. Coloring these columns gives each row 10 red squares, enabling Bob to color all rows and subsequently the entire board. Testing (k = 99) shows it is insufficient as it leads to rows and columns with fewer than 10 red squares, halting the chain reaction.Thus, the smallest (k) required for Alice to set up the game such that Bob can color the entire board red is (boxed{100}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game on a 100x100 board. All squares start white, and Alice gets to choose exactly k squares to color red initially. Then Bob can make moves by selecting a row or column that has at least 10 red squares, and when he does that, he can color all the remaining squares in that row or column red. The goal is to find the smallest k such that Alice can set up the initial red squares in a way that allows Bob to eventually turn the entire board red after some finite number of moves.Hmm, let&#39;s try to break this down. So first, Alice picks k red squares. Then Bob can look at any row or column, and if it has at least 10 red squares, he can color the rest red. So each move Bob makes can turn an entire row or column red, but only if there are already 10 red squares in it. The challenge is to figure out the minimum number of red squares Alice needs to place so that, through a series of these moves, Bob can convert the entire board to red.This seems similar to some kind of graph infection or percolation problem, where you need a certain number of initially infected nodes to spread the infection throughout the entire graph. Here, the rows and columns are like the nodes, and coloring a row or column is like infecting it once it has enough infected neighbors.But how exactly does this work? Let&#39;s consider the process. Suppose Alice colors some squares red. Bob can then check each row and column. If any row or column has at least 10 red squares, he can color the rest of that row or column red. By doing so, he adds more red squares, which might then allow other rows or columns to meet the 10-red-square threshold, and so on.So the key is to set up an initial configuration where the red squares are positioned such that Bob can iteratively convert rows and columns, each time using the newly red squares to enable further conversions. The question is: what&#39;s the minimal k for which this is possible?Let&#39;s think about the structure of the board. Since Bob can operate on rows and columns, maybe a good strategy is to have Alice place red squares in such a way that certain critical rows and columns can be activated first, which then help in activating others.For instance, if Alice colors enough squares in a particular row or column so that Bob can immediately convert that row or column on his first move. But since Bob needs at least 10 red squares in a row or column to convert it, Alice needs to place 10 red squares in some row or column. However, if she does that, Bob can convert that entire row or column to red in one move, which gives him 100 red squares in that row or column. Then, those 100 red squares can be used to convert other rows or columns.Wait, but if Bob converts a row to all red, then every column that intersects that row now has at least one red square. But each column would need 10 red squares to be converted. Similarly, if a column is converted, each row that intersects it gets one red square. So converting a single row or column gives a single red square in each intersecting column or row.But maybe if you convert multiple rows or columns, those red squares can accumulate in the columns or rows. For example, if you convert 10 rows, then each column that intersects those 10 rows would have 10 red squares, which would then allow Bob to convert those columns, which in turn would give more red squares in other rows.So maybe the strategy is to set up an initial set of red squares such that Bob can convert a certain number of rows or columns, which then allow him to convert columns or rows, which then allow converting more rows or columns, and so on, until the entire board is red.This seems like a bootstrapping process. So, perhaps the minimal k is related to setting up intersections where converting a row allows converting columns, and converting columns allows converting more rows, etc.To make this precise, let&#39;s consider that if Bob can convert a set of rows, each of those rows will contribute one red square to each column. So if he converts 10 rows, each column will have 10 red squares (one from each converted row). Then, each column can be converted, which in turn would give 100 red squares in each column, which when converted, each row would have 100 red squares. Wait, but once a column is converted, it&#39;s all red, so then every row that intersects that column would have a red square. But converting a column would require 10 red squares in it. If you have 10 red rows, each column has 10 red squares, so you can convert all columns. Then converting all columns would make the entire board red. Hmm, interesting.So here&#39;s an idea: if Alice can arrange for Bob to first convert 10 rows. Each of those 10 rows would have 10 red squares initially, allowing Bob to convert them. Once those 10 rows are converted, each column now has 10 red squares (one from each of the 10 converted rows). Then Bob can convert all 100 columns, each of which now has 10 red squares. Converting all columns would then color all remaining white squares in the columns red. Therefore, the entire board would be red.But wait, how does Bob convert the initial 10 rows? For Bob to convert a row, that row must have at least 10 red squares. So Alice needs to place 10 red squares in each of 10 rows. That would require 10*10 = 100 red squares. Then, Bob can convert each of those 10 rows (since each has 10 red squares), coloring the remaining 90 squares in each row red. Then, each column would have 10 red squares (one from each of the 10 converted rows), allowing Bob to convert all columns, each of which would then color the remaining 90 squares red. Thus, the entire board would be red. Therefore, k=100.But the problem is asking for the minimal k. Is 100 the minimal? Maybe we can do better.Wait, perhaps we don&#39;t need to have 10 red squares in each of 10 rows. Maybe we can have overlapping rows and columns so that the red squares can be shared between them. For example, if we place red squares in such a way that each red square is part of both a row and a column that can be converted. This way, the same red square can contribute to both a row and a column&#39;s count.Alternatively, maybe a more efficient arrangement is possible. Let me think. Suppose we arrange the red squares in a grid pattern. For example, if we have 10 rows and 10 columns each with 10 red squares at their intersections, the total number of red squares would be 10*10 + 10*10 - 10*10 = 100. Wait, no. If you have 10 rows with 10 red squares each, and 10 columns with 10 red squares each, but the intersections would overlap. Specifically, if the red squares are at the intersections of 10 rows and 10 columns, then the total number of red squares is 10*10 = 100. So that&#39;s the same as before.But if we do that, then each of those 10 rows has 10 red squares (at the intersections with the 10 columns). Similarly, each of the 10 columns has 10 red squares. So Bob can choose to convert either the 10 rows or the 10 columns first. Suppose he converts the 10 rows first. Then those rows become all red. Then, the 10 columns that were initially set up with 10 red squares now each have 10 red rows plus the remaining 90 rows. Wait, no. If the 10 columns had 10 red squares initially (at the intersections with the 10 rows), and then those 10 rows are converted to all red, then each of those 10 columns now has 100 red squares (since the entire row is red). So actually, those columns would already be fully red. Wait, no. Wait, if a column is one of the initial 10 columns with 10 red squares, and after converting the 10 rows, the entire rows are red, so those columns now have the 10 red squares from the initial setup plus 90 more from the converted rows. So each initial column has 100 red squares, meaning they&#39;re already fully red. Similarly, the initial rows are converted to all red. So if Alice sets up a 10x10 grid of red squares at the intersections of 10 rows and 10 columns, then Bob can convert those 10 rows, which in turn convert the 10 columns (since they now have 100 red squares each). But then the rest of the board is already converted? Wait, no.Wait, if Alice sets up 10 rows and 10 columns with red squares at their intersections (total 100 red squares), then converting the 10 rows would color the entire 10 rows red. Each of those 10 rows intersects all 100 columns. So after converting the 10 rows, each column has 10 red squares (from the 10 converted rows). Therefore, Bob can then convert all 100 columns. Converting each column would color the remaining 90 squares in each column red, resulting in the entire board being red. Therefore, with 100 red squares, Bob can convert the entire board.But is 100 the minimal k? Let&#39;s see if we can do with fewer.Suppose instead of 10 rows and 10 columns, we use fewer. For example, suppose Alice sets up 9 rows and 9 columns. Then the intersections would be 9x9=81 red squares. But converting 9 rows would give each column 9 red squares, which is less than the required 10. So Bob cannot convert the columns. Similarly, converting the columns first would result in each row having 9 red squares. So that&#39;s not enough.Alternatively, maybe a different configuration. Instead of a grid, maybe some other pattern where each red square is part of multiple rows and columns. For example, if red squares are arranged such that each is in a unique row and column, like a diagonal. But a diagonal of 100 red squares would only give one red square per row and column, which is way below the 10 needed.Alternatively, arranging red squares in a checkerboard pattern? But that would spread them out too thin. Each row and column would have about 50 red squares, but if we use fewer, maybe not. Wait, but if you have k red squares, distributed as evenly as possible, each row and column would have about k/100 red squares. To get at least 10 in a row or column, we need k/100 &gt;=10, so k&gt;=1000. That can&#39;t be, since 1000 is way more than the 100 we had before.Wait, that reasoning is flawed. Because when you convert a row or column, you add more red squares, so maybe you don&#39;t need the initial red squares to cover each row or column evenly. Instead, the initial red squares can be concentrated in certain rows or columns to allow converting those, and then the converted ones help convert others.So perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way. Let&#39;s think recursively. Suppose we have some number of red squares in such a way that Bob can convert some rows, which then allow converting columns, which then allow converting more rows, and so on.For instance, if Alice places red squares in a set of rows such that each of those rows has 10 red squares, allowing Bob to convert them. Then, the columns that intersect those rows will have a certain number of red squares. If the number is enough, then Bob can convert those columns, which in turn give more red squares in other rows, allowing those to be converted, etc.But how does this chain reaction work? Let&#39;s try to model it.Suppose Alice sets up m rows with 10 red squares each. That requires k = 10m red squares. After converting these m rows, each column now has m red squares. If m &gt;=10, then each column has at least 10 red squares, so Bob can convert all columns. Converting all columns would then color all remaining white squares red. Therefore, if m=10, then k=100, which is the same as before.But what if m=9? Then, after converting 9 rows, each column has 9 red squares, which is insufficient. So Bob can&#39;t convert columns. Therefore, 9 is not enough. So m=10 seems necessary. But perhaps there&#39;s another way where the columns can be converted in a different manner.Alternatively, maybe Alice can set up some rows and some columns with red squares, such that converting some rows allows converting some columns, which then allow converting more rows, and so on. Maybe with overlapping rows and columns.Suppose Alice sets up 10 red squares in 10 different rows and 10 different columns. Wait, that would require 10 red squares, each in a unique row and column. But then each row and column has only 1 red square. That&#39;s way too few.Alternatively, if she sets up 10 red squares in each of 5 rows and 5 columns. Wait, but overlapping. Let me think. For example, if she has 5 rows with 10 red squares each, and 5 columns with 10 red squares each, but the intersections of these rows and columns have overlapping red squares. So total red squares would be 5*10 + 5*10 - overlaps. If the overlaps are maximized, then the minimal k is 5*10 +5*10 - 5*5=100-25=75. Wait, how?Suppose the 5 rows and 5 columns intersect in a 5x5 grid. So in those 5 rows, each has 10 red squares. But 5 of those are in the intersecting columns, and 5 are outside. Similarly, the 5 columns have 10 red squares each, 5 in the intersecting rows, and 5 outside. Therefore, the total red squares would be 5 rows * 10 reds = 50, plus 5 columns *10 reds =50, minus the overlapping 5x5=25 red squares (since those were counted twice). So total red squares would be 50 +50 -25=75.Then, Bob can convert the 5 rows (each has 10 red squares). Converting those 5 rows would turn all 100 squares in each of those 5 rows red. Then, the 5 columns that had initial 10 red squares each (5 in the overlapping rows and 5 elsewhere). After converting the 5 rows, those 5 columns now have 5 red squares from the converted rows plus the original 5 red squares, totaling 10. Therefore, Bob can convert those 5 columns. Converting those 5 columns would turn all remaining squares in those columns red. Then, after converting the 5 columns, each of the remaining 95 rows (since 5 were already converted) now have 5 red squares from the converted columns. But 5 is still less than 10, so Bob can&#39;t convert those rows. Hmm, so this approach doesn&#39;t work because the remaining rows don&#39;t get enough red squares.Alternatively, maybe if we do more overlapping. Let&#39;s think of a grid where Alice sets up r rows and c columns, each with 10 red squares, arranged such that the intersections of these rows and columns have as many overlaps as possible. The total number of red squares would be 10r +10c - x, where x is the number of overlapping red squares (i.e., red squares that are in both the rows and columns). The maximum possible overlap is min(10r,10c), but likely less depending on the arrangement.Wait, for example, if Alice sets up 10 rows and 10 columns, each with 10 red squares, and arranges the red squares so that the intersections of these rows and columns are all red. Then, each of the 10 rows has 10 red squares in the 10 columns, and each of the 10 columns has 10 red squares in the 10 rows. Thus, the total red squares would be 10*10=100. Then, converting the 10 rows first gives all 10 rows as red, which then gives the 10 columns (already fully red because the rows are red). But then the rest of the board is already converted? Wait, no. The 10 rows are converted, so each column has 10 red squares (from the converted rows). Then, Bob can convert all 100 columns, each of which now has 10 red squares. Converting each column would color the remaining 90 squares in the column red. So this brings us back to the k=100 case.But if we try to use fewer red squares by overlapping, like in the 5 rows and 5 columns example, we ended up not being able to convert enough rows or columns afterwards. So maybe the minimal k is indeed 100? But the problem is from Macedonia, proposed by Nikola Velov, and it&#39;s likely not 100 because that seems straightforward, but maybe there&#39;s a trick.Wait, another idea. Maybe using a smaller number of red squares arranged in such a way that each red square is part of multiple rows and columns that can be converted. For example, if we have a set of red squares where each red square is in a row that can be converted and a column that can be converted, creating a kind of chain reaction.Wait, suppose Alice places red squares in a diagonal pattern. For instance, place 10 red squares in each of the first 10 rows, but staggered such that each column only has one red square. Then, this would require 10*10=100 red squares again, same as before. But this doesn&#39;t help.Alternatively, maybe place 10 red squares in a single row. Then Bob can convert that row, giving 100 red squares in that row. Then, each column that intersects that row now has 1 red square. If we have 10 such rows, each column would have 10 red squares. Wait, no. If we have 10 rows, each with 10 red squares, but arranged so that each column has one red square from each row. That would require 10*10=100 red squares, each in a unique column. Then converting those 10 rows would result in each column having 10 red squares (one from each converted row). Then Bob can convert all columns. But again, that&#39;s 100 red squares.Alternatively, if the red squares are arranged such that converting one row allows converting multiple columns, which in turn allow converting multiple rows, etc., with some multiplier effect.Suppose Alice places 10 red squares in a single row. Bob converts that row, turning all 100 squares red. Now, every column has 1 red square. Not enough. Then, if Alice also places 9 red squares in each of 10 columns. Wait, but that would be 10 columns with 9 red squares each, totaling 90 red squares. Then, converting the initial row gives 100 red squares in that row, so each column now has 1 (from the converted row) + 9 (original) = 10 red squares. Then Bob can convert all 10 columns, each of which has 10 red squares. Converting those columns would color the remaining 90 squares in each column red. Then, since each of the other 99 rows now has 10 red squares (from the converted columns), Bob can convert those rows. Wait, no. Each of the other rows would have 10 red squares from the converted columns. So converting those 99 rows would color them all red. Therefore, the total red squares initially would be 10 (in the first row) + 10 columns *9 red squares =10 +90=100. So again, k=100.Wait, but in this case, the initial setup is 10 red squares in one row and 9 red squares in each of 10 columns. But those columns already have 9 red squares, and converting the first row gives them 1 more, making 10. Then converting the columns gives all columns red. Then, the other rows have 10 red squares each from the converted columns, so they can be converted. But wait, each of the other rows (99 rows) would have 10 red squares from the 10 converted columns. So Bob can convert all 99 remaining rows, each with 10 red squares. But converting a row requires at least 10 red squares, which they have. So converting all rows would make the entire board red. Therefore, with k=100, this works.But is there a way to do it with fewer than 100? Let&#39;s try to see. Suppose instead of 10 columns with 9 red squares each, we have fewer columns. For example, if Alice sets up 9 red squares in 11 columns. Then, converting the initial row gives each of those 11 columns 1 red square, so they would have 10 red squares? No, 9+1=10. Wait, 9 red squares initially in the column, plus 1 from the converted row gives 10. Then, converting those 11 columns would require each to have 10 red squares, which they do. So converting those 11 columns would turn them all red. Then, each row would have 11 red squares (from the converted columns), allowing Bob to convert all rows, which would then convert the entire board.Wait, how many red squares does this setup require? Let&#39;s compute. The initial row has 10 red squares. Then, 11 columns each with 9 red squares. But we have to make sure that the 9 red squares in each column are not in the initial row. Because if they are, then converting the initial row would add 1 red square to the column, but if the column already had 9 in the initial row, converting the row would make it 10. Wait, but if the 9 red squares in the column are in the initial row, then converting the row would make the entire column red (since the row is converted to all red). But that&#39;s not the case. If the column has 9 red squares in the initial row, then converting the row would color the remaining 91 squares in the row, but the column still has 9 red squares in the initial row. Wait, no. Wait, the column has 9 red squares in the initial row. Then, when Bob converts the initial row, the entire row becomes red, so the column now has 100 red squares in that row, so the column is fully red. Wait, no. Converting a row colors all squares in that row red. So if a column had 9 red squares in that row, converting the row would make that column have 9+91=100 red squares. Wait, no. If the column had 9 red squares in the initial row, and the rest of the column is white. Then converting the row would color all 100 squares in the row red. Therefore, the column now has 9 (from the initial setup) +91 (from the converted row) =100 red squares. So that column is already fully red. Therefore, in that case, the column is already converted. Therefore, if Alice puts 9 red squares in a column within the initial row, then converting the initial row would automatically convert that column. But that seems like a different approach.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. Suppose Alice&#39;s initial setup is as follows: She picks one row and colors 10 squares red in that row. Let&#39;s call this Row A. Then, she picks 10 columns and colors 9 squares red in each of those columns, all of which are in Row A. So in Row A, there are 10 red squares (the ones in the 10 columns). In each of the 10 columns, there are 9 red squares in Row A and 9 red squares in other rows. Wait, no. If she colors 9 squares in each column, but all 9 are in Row A, then each column has 9 red squares in Row A. Then, converting Row A would color the entire Row A red, so each of those 10 columns would have 9 red squares in Row A, which is now all red. Therefore, each column would have 9 red squares from Row A (which is now all red, so 100 red squares in the column? Wait, no.Wait, if a column has 9 red squares in Row A, which is converted to all red, then the column has 9 red squares (from the initial setup) plus 91 red squares from the converted row. Wait, no. Converting a row doesn&#39;t add red squares to other rows. It just converts the entire row to red. So if a column has 9 red squares in Row A, and Row A is converted, then the column has 100 red squares in Row A (since the entire row is red). Therefore, the column now has 100 red squares, so it&#39;s already fully converted. Wait, that seems contradictory.Wait, no. Let&#39;s take a step back. If you have a column. Initially, it has 9 red squares in Row A. The rest of the column is white. Then, Bob converts Row A, which turns all squares in Row A red. Therefore, in the column, the square in Row A is now red. The other 99 squares in the column are still white. So the column now has 1 red square (from Row A) plus the original 9 red squares in Row A? Wait, no. If the column had 9 red squares in Row A before conversion, converting Row A would color all squares in Row A red, which includes those 9 squares. Wait, but if the column had 9 red squares in Row A, then converting Row A would not affect the column&#39;s count. Because those 9 squares were already red. Converting the row just colors the remaining 91 squares in the row red. So the column, which had 9 red squares in Row A, now has 100 red squares in Row A. Wait, no. The column only intersects Row A at one square. If the column had 9 red squares in Row A, that&#39;s impossible, because a column and a row intersect at only one square. Therefore, if Alice colors 9 squares in a column, they have to be in 9 different rows. Wait, that&#39;s right. Each column has 100 squares, one in each row. So if Alice wants to color 9 squares in a column, they have to be in 9 different rows. Similarly, each row has 100 squares, one in each column.Therefore, if Alice wants to color 9 squares in a column, she must choose 9 distinct rows to color in that column. Therefore, in the initial setup, if Alice colors 10 red squares in Row A (say, in columns 1 to 10), and then in columns 1 to 10, she colors 9 red squares each in different rows. For example, in column 1, she colors 9 red squares in rows B to J (rows 2 to 10). In column 2, she colors 9 red squares in rows K to S (rows 11 to 19), and so on. Wait, but this would spread out the red squares across many rows and columns. Let&#39;s compute the total number of red squares here.In Row A, 10 red squares (columns 1-10). In each of columns 1-10, 9 red squares in other rows. So total red squares: 10 (from Row A) + 10*9=90 (from the columns) =100. Then, converting Row A gives all 100 squares in Row A red. Each column 1-10 now has 1 red square (from Row A) plus 9 red squares in other rows, totaling 10 red squares. Therefore, Bob can convert columns 1-10. Converting each column colors all remaining squares in the column red. Since each column had 10 red squares, converting it would color 90 squares red. Now, after converting columns 1-10, each row that intersects these columns now has 10 red squares (one from each column). Wait, how many rows are we talking about? For each column 1-10, there were 9 red squares in other rows. So in column 1, rows B-J (9 rows) have red squares. Similarly for columns 2-10. But depending on how these are arranged, these rows might overlap.If the 9 red squares in each column are in distinct rows, then total rows affected would be 10 columns *9 rows=90 rows. Each of these rows would have one red square from each column. Wait, no. Each row that has a red square in column 1 would have one red square. Then, if those rows also have red squares in other columns, they would accumulate more red squares.But if the red squares in each column are in unique rows, then each of the 90 rows (for 10 columns *9 rows) would have 1 red square. After converting columns 1-10, each of those 90 rows would have 10 red squares (one from each converted column). Therefore, Bob can then convert those 90 rows. Converting each of those rows would color the remaining 90 squares in each row red. Then, finally, the remaining 10 rows (the original Row A and the 9 rows that were not used in the columns?) Wait, no. Wait, there are 100 rows. If 90 rows are converted, then 10 remain. But the 10 remaining rows would have been Row A (already converted) and maybe others. Wait, no. If 90 rows are converted after the columns, and Row A was converted first, then in total, 91 rows are converted. The remaining 9 rows would have 0 red squares? Wait, no. Wait, each of the remaining 9 rows would have red squares from the converted columns. Each column 1-10 is fully converted, so each row, including the remaining 9, would have 10 red squares from the converted columns. Therefore, Bob can convert those remaining 9 rows as well. Therefore, the entire board is red.But in this setup, the initial red squares are 100 (10 in Row A, 9 in each of 10 columns). Then Bob converts Row A (10 moves?), columns 1-10 (10 moves?), then the 90 rows (90 moves?), then the remaining 9 rows (9 moves?). Wait, but the problem states that Bob can color the entire board after finitely many moves, which this setup allows. However, the initial k is 100. So this is the same as the previous methods. Therefore, regardless of how we arrange the initial red squares, it seems we need at least 100.But maybe there&#39;s a smarter way where some red squares are shared between multiple rows and columns in a way that allows a chain reaction with fewer initial red squares.Another approach: think of this as a directed graph where each node is a row or column, and there is an edge from a row to a column if converting the row contributes to the column&#39;s red count, and vice versa. Then, the problem reduces to finding a minimal set of nodes (rows/columns) that can activate the entire graph through these edges, given that a node can be activated if it has at least 10 incoming edges from activated nodes.But this is getting abstract. Alternatively, think in terms of linear algebra. Each converted row adds 1 red square to each column, and each converted column adds 1 red square to each row. We need to find a sequence of moves where starting from some initial red squares, we can convert rows and columns such that each conversion step adds enough red squares to allow further conversions.This is similar to solving a system of equations. Let me try to model it.Let’s denote R_i as the number of red squares in row i, and C_j as the number of red squares in column j. Initially, some R_i and C_j are set by Alice. When Bob converts a row, R_i becomes 100, and each C_j for columns j in that row increases by 1 (if not already 100). Similarly, converting a column sets C_j to 100 and increases each R_i in that column by 1.But this seems complex. Alternatively, consider that converting a row contributes 1 to each column, and converting a column contributes 1 to each row. The goal is to have all rows and columns converted.If we model this as a bipartite graph with rows and columns as nodes, and conversions as edges that activate nodes when enough predecessors are activated.To activate a row, you need 10 red squares, which can come from either initial red squares or from converted columns. Similarly for columns.This seems similar to a bootstrap percolation problem where nodes activate when a certain number of neighbors are activated. In this case, rows and columns activate when they have 10 red squares, which can be from initial setup or from other activated rows/columns.In bootstrap percolation, the minimal number of initially active nodes needed to activate the entire network is studied. For a grid with threshold 10, perhaps the minimal number is related to 10*10=100.But I need to recall results from bootstrap percolation. In 2D grids, the critical number for percolation with threshold m is often on the order of m. However, this is a bipartite graph rather than a 2D grid, so maybe different.Alternatively, since each row is connected to all columns and vice versa, it&#39;s a complete bipartite graph. In such a case, activating a sufficient number of rows or columns can lead to activation of all.Suppose we activate m rows initially. Then each column gets m red squares. To activate a column, we need m &gt;=10, so m=10. Then activating 10 rows allows activating all columns, which then allow activating all rows. Therefore, k=10*10=100. This again gives k=100.Alternatively, if we activate a mix of rows and columns. For example, activate 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row activation gives 1 to each column, each column activation gives 1 to each row. So total contributions to rows: 5 (initial) +5 (from columns). Total contributions to columns:5 (initial) +5 (from rows). But this only gives 10 to each row and column. Wait, but if you start with 5 rows and 5 columns each with 10 red squares, that&#39;s 5*10 +5*10 - overlaps. If no overlaps, that&#39;s 100 red squares. Then converting the 5 rows and 5 columns would give 5 contributions to each column and row, but since they need 10, you still need 5 more.Alternatively, if you have overlapping red squares. Suppose the 5 rows and 5 columns intersect, so that the red squares are at their intersections. Then, 5*5=25 red squares. Then converting those 5 rows and 5 columns. Wait, but each row only has 5 red squares initially, so you can&#39;t convert them. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.This seems to circle back to the conclusion that k=100 is needed. Because to convert the first set of rows or columns, they need 10 red squares each, and if they don&#39;t overlap, that&#39;s 10*10=100.But maybe there&#39;s a way to have overlapping red squares such that some red squares count towards multiple rows or columns. Wait, but each red square is in one row and one column. So a single red square can contribute to one row and one column. Therefore, to have a red square count towards multiple rows, it would need to be in multiple rows, which is impossible.Therefore, each red square can only help one row and one column. Hence, if you need 10 red squares per row or column, you can&#39;t share them between multiple rows or columns. Therefore, the minimal k would indeed be 10*10=100.But wait, let&#39;s test this intuition. Suppose you have a red square in row 1, column 1. This red square counts towards row 1 and column 1. If you want another red square to count towards row 1 and column 2, that&#39;s a different red square. So indeed, each red square is unique to a row-column pair.Therefore, to have 10 red squares in a row, you need 10 distinct red squares in that row. Similarly, for a column. Therefore, if you want 10 rows with 10 red squares each, and these red squares are all in distinct columns, then you need 10*10=100 red squares.Alternatively, if the red squares in the 10 rows are in the same columns, then those columns would have 10 red squares each (one from each row), allowing you to convert the columns. But this again results in 10 rows *10 columns =100 red squares.Thus, it seems unavoidable that k=100 is the minimal number. But the problem is from a competition, likely the IMO shortlist or something similar, and such problems often have a twist. Maybe the answer is 100, but I need to verify.Wait, here&#39;s another angle. Suppose Alice doesn&#39;t place all 10 red squares in separate columns, but instead concentrates them in fewer columns, so that converting those columns can help convert more rows.For example, suppose Alice creates 10 red squares in a single column. Then Bob can convert that column, turning all 100 squares red. But converting a column requires at least 10 red squares, which this column has. Wait, no. If Alice places 10 red squares in a column, Bob can convert that column, coloring the remaining 90 squares red. Then, that column is fully red. Each row that intersects that column now has 1 red square. If there are 10 such columns, each with 10 red squares, then converting those columns would give each row 10 red squares, allowing Bob to convert all rows. But this again requires 10 columns *10 red squares =100 red squares.Alternatively, if Alice arranges 10 red squares in a column such that those 10 red squares are in rows that each have 9 other red squares. Then, converting the column would give those rows 1 more red square, making it 10. But this seems like the same as before, requiring 10*10=100.Wait, maybe another way. If Alice places 10 red squares in each of 10 columns, but arranged such that these red squares are in the same 10 rows. Then, the total red squares are 10 columns *10 rows =100. Converting the 10 columns would color them all red, which gives each of the 10 rows 10 red squares (from the converted columns). Then, converting those 10 rows would color the entire board red. Again, k=100.Alternatively, use a smaller number of rows and columns but with more red squares each. For example, if Alice places 20 red squares in 5 rows. Then Bob can convert those 5 rows (each with 20 red squares). Converting those 5 rows gives each column 5 red squares. Not enough. Then, if Alice also places 15 red squares in 8 columns. Wait, but this seems more complicated and might not result in a lower k.Alternatively, consider that after the initial conversion of some rows, the columns they intersect get red squares, which can be used to convert more columns, which in turn convert more rows, etc. This might have a cascading effect.Suppose Alice places 10 red squares in a single row. Bob converts that row, resulting in 100 red squares. Then, every column has 1 red square. Not enough. But if Alice also places 9 red squares in 10 different columns, not overlapping with the initial row. Then, converting the initial row gives those columns 1 red square, so they now have 10. Wait, 9+1=10. Then converting those 10 columns gives each row 10 red squares. Then converting all rows. Total initial red squares:10 (initial row) +10*9=100. Again, k=100.This seems to be a common theme. All these strategies require 100 red squares. Is there a way to get away with less?Wait, let&#39;s think outside the box. What if Alice doesn&#39;t place all 10 red squares in a single row or column, but spreads them out in a way that allows multiple conversions to happen simultaneously.For example, suppose Alice places 10 red squares in such a way that each red square is in a different row and column. Then, this would be 10 red squares. But then each row and column has only 1 red square, which is insufficient. So Bob can&#39;t convert anything.Alternatively, place 10 red squares in each of 5 rows and 5 columns, but with overlaps. Wait, but each overlap would reduce the total count. For example, 5 rows with 10 red squares each and 5 columns with 10 red squares each, overlapping in a 5x5 grid. Then total red squares are 5*10 +5*10 -5*5=50+50-25=75. Then, converting the 5 rows (each has 10 red squares) would turn them all red. Then, each column has 5 red squares from the converted rows. If the 5 columns had 5 red squares initially (from the overlapping), then converting the rows adds 5 more, totaling 10. Wait, but the columns already had 5 red squares in the overlapping rows, which are now converted. Wait, no. If the columns had 5 red squares in the 5 rows, and those rows are converted, then the columns now have 5 red squares from the converted rows plus the remaining 5 red squares in other rows. Wait, no. The columns had 10 red squares initially, 5 in the overlapping rows and 5 elsewhere. Converting the 5 rows turns the overlapping 5 red squares in each column to 100, but the column&#39;s red squares are only in the converted rows. Wait, this is getting confusing.Let me clarify. Suppose we have 5 rows and 5 columns with red squares arranged at their intersections (a 5x5 grid). So each of the 5 rows has 5 red squares (at the intersections with the 5 columns), and each of the 5 columns has 5 red squares (at the intersections with the 5 rows). Total red squares:25. Then, Alice needs to add more red squares to reach 10 per row and 10 per column. So for each of the 5 rows, she needs 5 more red squares outside the 5 columns. Similarly, for each of the 5 columns, she needs 5 more red squares outside the 5 rows. Therefore, total red squares:25 (intersection) +5 rows*5 red squares=25 +25=50, and 5 columns*5 red squares=25, but these are already counted in the previous 50. Wait, no. If the 5 rows each have 5 red squares in the 5 columns and 5 red squares elsewhere, that&#39;s 10 per row, totaling 5*10=50. Similarly, the 5 columns each have 5 red squares in the 5 rows and 5 red squares elsewhere, totaling 10 per column, 5*10=50. However, the red squares outside the intersections are distinct from each other. So total red squares are 25 (intersections) +25 (rows) +25 (columns) =75. Then, converting the 5 rows first. Each row has 10 red squares. Converting them turns all 100 squares in each row red. Then, the 5 columns that were initially set up now have 5 red squares from the converted rows plus 5 red squares from their own initial setup, totaling 10. Therefore, Bob can convert those 5 columns. Converting them turns all remaining squares in those columns red. Then, the remaining 95 rows (original 100 minus 5 converted) each have 5 red squares from the converted columns. Not enough. So they can&#39;t be converted. Similarly, the remaining 95 columns (original 100 minus 5 converted) each have 5 red squares from the converted rows. Not enough. So this approach doesn&#39;t work.Hmm. So even with 75 red squares, we can&#39;t convert the entire board. Therefore, maybe 100 is indeed the minimal k.But let&#39;s check another configuration. Suppose Alice places 10 red squares in each of 9 rows. That&#39;s 90 red squares. Then, Bob can convert those 9 rows. Each column now has 9 red squares. Not enough. Then, if Alice also places 1 red square in each of 10 columns. That&#39;s 10 more red squares, totaling 100. Then, converting the 9 rows gives each column 9 red squares. The 10 columns with an extra red square now have 10 red squares. Bob can convert those 10 columns. Converting them gives each row 10 red squares (from the converted columns). Then, Bob can convert all rows. So this works with k=100.But is this the same as before? Yes, because the initial 9 rows with 10 red squares each is 90, plus 10 columns with 1 red square each is 10, totaling 100.Alternatively, if Alice arranges 10 red squares in a way that overlaps more efficiently. Suppose she has 10 rows with 10 red squares each, but arranged such that each red square is in a unique column. Then, this requires 100 red squares. Then Bob converts the 10 rows, each column now has 10 red squares, convert all columns, done. So same as before.Alternatively, what if Alice uses a combination of rows and columns in the initial setup. For example, set up 5 rows with 14 red squares each and 5 columns with 14 red squares each. The total red squares would be 5*14 +5*14 - overlaps. If the overlaps are maximized, i.e., the 5 rows and 5 columns intersect in a 5x5 grid, then the overlaps are 5*5=25. So total red squares would be 70 +70 -25=115. That&#39;s worse than 100.Therefore, it seems that no matter how we arrange the red squares, the minimal k required is 100. Because to convert the initial rows or columns, they need at least 10 red squares each, and if they don&#39;t overlap, that&#39;s 10*10=100. Any overlapping would require compensating with more red squares elsewhere, leading to the same or higher total.Therefore, after considering various configurations and strategies, it appears that the minimal k is 100.Final Answerboxed{100}&lt;/think&gt;Alice and Bob play a game on a (100 times 100) board where Alice initially colors exactly (k) unit squares red. Bob can then color all remaining squares in a row or column red if it contains at least 10 red squares. The goal is to find the smallest (k) such that Bob can eventually color the entire board red.Key steps and reasoning:1. Initial Setup: Alice needs to place red squares in such a way that Bob can convert rows and columns iteratively. Converting a row or column requires at least 10 red squares in that row or column.2. Conversion Process: If Bob converts a row, all squares in that row become red, which contributes 1 red square to each column intersecting that row. Similarly, converting a column contributes 1 red square to each row intersecting that column.3. Critical Rows and Columns: To start the process, Alice must ensure there are enough red squares in certain rows or columns so Bob can convert them. Converting these will help convert other rows and columns.4. Example Configuration: If Alice places 10 red squares in each of 10 different rows (totaling (10 times 10 = 100) red squares), Bob can convert these rows. Each column will then have 10 red squares (one from each converted row), allowing Bob to convert all columns. Converting all columns will color the remaining squares red.5. Overlap Consideration: Overlapping red squares in rows and columns might seem beneficial, but each red square can only contribute to one row and one column. Efficient configurations without overlapping still require 10 red squares per row or column, leading to the same total.6. Verification: Various configurations were considered, including different overlaps and distributions, but all led to the conclusion that (k = 100) is the minimum required to ensure Bob can convert the entire board.Thus, the smallest (k) such that Alice can set up the game for Bob to color the entire board red is (boxed{100}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🔑:</span>1. First Claim: Alice can color 100 squares and Bob can color the entire board.   Let&#39;s name the rows ( A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, A_{100} ) and the columns ( B_1, B_2, B_3, ldots, B_{100} ). If Alice colors the squares ( A_1B_1, A_1B_2, ldots, A_1B_{10}, A_2B_1, A_2B_2, ldots, A_2B_{10}, ldots, A_{10}B_{10} ), then Bob can color the entire board.   - Alice colors the first 10 rows and the first 10 columns, making a (10 times 10) grid of red squares.   - Each row and each column in this (10 times 10) grid has exactly 10 red squares.   - Bob can then choose any row or column with at least 10 red squares and color the entire row or column red.   - This process can be repeated until the entire board is red.2. Second Claim: Alice has to color at least 100 squares.   Proof: Suppose the number of squares Alice colors is less than 100.   - Without loss of generality (WLOG), suppose Bob starts by coloring rows. Initially, he colors row ( A_1 ), which means there are at least ( 10A_1 ) red squares.   - If ( A_1 &lt; 10 ), he then colors column ( B_1 ), which means there are at least ( B_1(10 - A_1) ) more red squares.   - If ( B_1 &lt; 10 ), he colors row ( A_2 ), adding ( A_2(10 - B_1) ) more red squares.   - This process continues, alternating between rows and columns, until either ( A_1 + A_2 + ldots + A_k = 10 ) or ( B_1 + B_2 + ldots + B_t = 10 ).   At the ( k )-th step, if either ( A_1 + ldots + A_k = 10 ) or ( B_1 + ldots + B_t = 10 ), Bob finishes coloring.   - The total number of red squares is given by:     [     10(A_1 + ldots + A_k + B_1 + ldots + B_t) - (A_1 + ldots + A_k)(B_1 + ldots + B_t)     ]   - Since ( A_1 + ldots + A_k = 10 ) or ( B_1 + ldots + B_t = 10 ), we have:     [     10(A_1 + ldots + A_k + B_1 + ldots + B_t) - (A_1 + ldots + A_k)(B_1 + ldots + B_t) &lt; 100     ]   - This implies:     [     100 &lt; 100     ]   - This is a contradiction, so Alice must color at least 100 squares.Therefore, the smallest ( k ) such that Alice can set up the game in such a way that Bob can color the entire board red after finitely many moves is ( k = 100 ).The final answer is ( boxed{100} ).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-7b758c3c data-v-84ea8c19><div class="review" data-v-84ea8c19><div class="review-title" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>❓:</span>15.

Then, we need to consider two polynomials: a(x - b)(x - c) and a(x - b)(x + c). For each of these polynomials, we have to find the minimum value they take over all real numbers x, which are called k and l respectively. Finally, we need to compute the maximum possible value of k - l. Hmm, okay, let&#39;s unpack this step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Vijay picks three different numbers a, b, c from 1 to 11. Then, we have two quadratic polynomials: one is a(x - b)(x - c) and the other is a(x - b)(x + c). For each quadratic, we need to find their minimum values when considered over all real x. These minima are k and l. Then, we want to maximize the difference k - l by choosing the best possible a, b, c. Got it.So, quadratic functions. Since they are quadratics, their graphs are parabolas. The coefficient of x² in each will determine if they open upwards or downwards. Let&#39;s check that.For the first polynomial: a(x - b)(x - c). Expanding this, it becomes a[x² - (b + c)x + bc]. So the coefficient of x² is a. Similarly, the second polynomial: a(x - b)(x + c) becomes a[x² + (c - b)x - bc]. So coefficient of x² is also a. Since a is a positive integer (from 1 to 11), both quadratics open upwards. Therefore, each has a minimum at their vertex, and no maximum. So k and l are the y-values at the vertices of these parabolas.Therefore, to find k and l, we need to compute the vertex (specifically the y-coordinate) of each quadratic.For a quadratic function f(x) = Ax² + Bx + C, the vertex occurs at x = -B/(2A), and the minimum value is C - B²/(4A). Let me verify that formula. Yes, completing the square: f(x) = A(x² + (B/A)x) + C = A[(x + B/(2A))² - B²/(4A²)] + C = A(x + B/(2A))² - B²/(4A) + C. So the minimum value is indeed C - B²/(4A).So, applying this to both quadratics.First polynomial: f1(x) = a(x - b)(x - c) = a x² - a(b + c)x + a b c.So A = a, B = -a(b + c), C = a b c.Therefore, the vertex is at x = -B/(2A) = [a(b + c)]/(2a) = (b + c)/2.Then, the minimum value k is C - B²/(4A) = a b c - [a²(b + c)^2]/(4a) = a b c - [a(b + c)^2]/4.Simplify that: k = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ].Similarly for the second polynomial: f2(x) = a(x - b)(x + c) = a x² + a(c - b)x - a b c.So here, A = a, B = a(c - b), C = -a b c.Therefore, vertex at x = -B/(2A) = -a(c - b)/(2a) = (b - c)/2.Then, the minimum value l is C - B²/(4A) = -a b c - [a²(c - b)^2]/(4a) = -a b c - [a(c - b)^2]/4.Simplify: l = -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ].So now, we have expressions for k and l in terms of a, b, c. Then, the difference k - l is:k - l = [a ( bc - (b + c)^2 /4 )] - [ -a ( bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ) ]Simplify this:= a bc - a (b + c)^2 /4 + a bc + a (c - b)^2 /4Combine like terms:= 2a bc + a [ (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 ] /4Let me compute (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2:Expand both:(c - b)^2 = c² - 2bc + b²(b + c)^2 = b² + 2bc + c²Subtracting: (c² - 2bc + b²) - (b² + 2bc + c²) = -4bcTherefore:k - l = 2a bc + a (-4 bc)/4 = 2a bc - a bc = a bc.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So k - l simplifies down to a bc. Let me verify this step again because that seems too straightforward.Starting from k - l:k = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ]l = -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ]Therefore, k - l = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ] - ( -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ] )= a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 + bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ]= a [ 2 bc + ( (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 ) /4 ]Then, (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 = (c² - 2bc + b²) - (c² + 2bc + b²) = -4bc.Therefore, k - l = a [ 2 bc + (-4 bc)/4 ] = a [ 2 bc - bc ] = a bc.Wow, so the difference k - l is just a*b*c. So the problem reduces to maximizing the product a*b*c, given that a, b, c are distinct integers from 1 to 11.But wait, is that correct? Let me check once more.Starting with k = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ]and l = -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ]Then k - l = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 + bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ]= a [ 2bc + ( (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 ) /4 ]Expanding (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 = (c² - 2bc + b²) - (c² + 2bc + b²) = -4bcThus, ( ... ) /4 = -4bc /4 = -bcTherefore, k - l = a [ 2bc - bc ] = a*b*c.Yes, that&#39;s correct. So actually, the difference k - l is equal to a*b*c. So to maximize k - l, we need to maximize the product a*b*c where a, b, c are distinct integers from 1 to 11.Wait a minute, but that seems too straightforward. The problem states that Vijay chooses three distinct integers a, b, c from the set {1,2,...,11}. Then k - l = a*b*c, so the maximum possible value of k - l is just the maximum product of three distinct integers from 1 to 11. Which would be 11*10*9 = 990. So is the answer 990?But hold on. Wait, the problem says &quot;compute the maximum possible value of k - l&quot;. If k - l = a*b*c, then yes, maximum product of three distinct numbers in the set. But that seems too easy for an Olympiad problem, especially since the original setup involved quadratics and their minima. There must be a catch here. Let me check again the derivations.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra when simplifying k - l. Let me retrace:Starting with k = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ]l = -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ]Therefore, k - l = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ] - ( -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ] )= a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 + bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ]= a [ 2 bc + ( (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 ) /4 ]Then, (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 = -4 bc as before.Thus, the term becomes ( -4 bc ) /4 = -bcHence, k - l = a [ 2 bc - bc ] = a bc.So that seems correct. So k - l is indeed a*b*c. Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing a*b*c where a,b,c are distinct integers from 1 to 11. Then, the maximum product is 11*10*9 = 990. Therefore, the answer is 990. But is that possible?Wait, but in the problem statement, the polynomials are a(x - b)(x - c) and a(x - b)(x + c). Wait, c is part of the polynomial. But in the second polynomial, Vijay is choosing c as part of the set {1,2,...,11}, but in the polynomial, it&#39;s (x + c). So c is being used as a coefficient in the polynomial, but it&#39;s still a positive integer from 1 to 11. So even if c is subtracted or added, since c is positive, that term is (x + c). But in our derivation, we treated c as a positive integer, and our algebra still went through. So the result that k - l = a*b*c seems valid.But perhaps there is a restriction in the problem that I missed? Let me check again.Vijay chooses three distinct integers a, b, c from the set {1,2,...,11}. The polynomials are a(x - b)(x - c) and a(x - b)(x + c). Then k is the minimum of the first polynomial, l is the minimum of the second polynomial, and we need the maximum k - l. According to our derivation, k - l = a*b*c. So, maximum k - l is the maximum possible a*b*c with a,b,c distinct. So 11*10*9=990.But that seems too easy. Maybe there is a mistake here. Let me think.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a restriction on the minima k and l? For example, is there a case where the minima are not achieved at real numbers? But quadratics with positive leading coefficients always have a minimum, achieved at their vertex. So that&#39;s okay. So as long as a is positive, which it is, since a is from 1 to 11.Wait, but in the second polynomial, a(x - b)(x + c) = a x² + a(c - b)x - a b c. The coefficient of x² is still positive, so it&#39;s a parabola opening upwards, so it has a minimum. So l is the minimum value of that quadratic, which is the y-coordinate at the vertex. So our calculation of l as -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ] is correct? Let me check.For the second polynomial: f2(x) = a(x - b)(x + c) = a [x² + (c - b)x - bc ]Thus, expanding: a x² + a(c - b) x - a b c.So coefficients: A = a, B = a(c - b), C = -a b c.Therefore, vertex at x = -B/(2A) = -a(c - b)/(2a) = (b - c)/2.Then, the minimum value l = C - B²/(4A) = -a b c - [a²(c - b)^2]/(4a) = -a b c - a (c - b)^2 /4.Which can be written as l = -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ].Similarly, k = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ].Then, k - l = a [ bc - (b + c)^2 /4 ] - ( -a [ bc + (c - b)^2 /4 ] )= a bc - a (b + c)^2 /4 + a bc + a (c - b)^2 /4= 2a bc + a [ (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 ] /4Then, expanding (c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 = c² - 2b c + b² - (c² + 2b c + b²) = -4b c.Hence, k - l = 2a bc + a (-4b c)/4 = 2a bc - a bc = a bc.So, this derivation is correct. Therefore, k - l = a*b*c. Therefore, to maximize k - l, we need to maximize a*b*c with a, b, c distinct elements from 1 to 11.Therefore, the answer is 11*10*9=990. But, wait, 11,10,9 are the three largest numbers in the set. So indeed, their product is the maximum possible. So is the answer 990?But wait, let me check with the problem statement again. It says &quot;compute the maximum possible value of k - l&quot;. So if k - l = a*b*c, then yes. But let me just confirm with an example.Suppose a=1, b=2, c=3. Then k - l should be 1*2*3=6.Compute k: First polynomial: 1(x - 2)(x - 3). The minimum is at x=(2+3)/2=2.5. The value is 1*(2.5 - 2)*(2.5 - 3)=1*(0.5)*(-0.5)= -0.25. So k = -0.25.Second polynomial: 1(x - 2)(x + 3). The minimum is at x=(2 - 3)/2= -0.5. The value is 1*(-0.5 - 2)*(-0.5 + 3)=1*(-2.5)*(2.5)= -6.25. So l = -6.25.Then k - l = (-0.25) - (-6.25)=6. Which is equal to a*b*c=1*2*3=6. So that works. So the formula holds in this case.Another example: a=2, b=1, c=3. Then k - l should be 2*1*3=6.First polynomial: 2(x -1)(x -3). Vertex at x=(1+3)/2=2. The value is 2*(2 -1)*(2 -3)=2*(1)*(-1)= -2. So k = -2.Second polynomial: 2(x -1)(x +3). Vertex at x=(1 -3)/2= -1. The value is 2*(-1 -1)*(-1 +3)=2*(-2)*(2)= -8. So l = -8.Then k - l = (-2) - (-8)=6=2*1*3. Again, correct.Therefore, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the problem is indeed equivalent to maximizing a*b*c over distinct a,b,c in {1,...,11}.Hence, the maximum product is 11*10*9=990.Wait, but let me verify if 11*10*9 is indeed the maximum. Since the numbers are distinct, the three largest numbers in the set are 11,10,9. Their product is 990. If we try other combinations, like 11,10,8: 11*10*8=880, which is less. Similarly, 11,9,8= 792, etc. So 990 is indeed the maximum.Therefore, the answer is 990, so boxed answer is boxed{990}.But wait, wait, the problem says &quot;compute the maximum possible value of k - l&quot;, which is equal to a*b*c. But in the first example I did, k - l was positive. But when a, b, c are positive integers, their product is positive. But since k is the minimum of the first quadratic, which opens upwards, so k is negative (since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum is below the x-axis). Similarly, l is the minimum of the second quadratic, which also opens upwards, so l is also negative. So k - l is a negative number minus a more negative number, which is positive. So k - l is positive, equal to a*b*c. Therefore, the maximum of k - l is the maximum of a*b*c.Therefore, yes, the answer is 990. Hmm. But let me check with a larger product. For example, if a=11, b=10, c=9, then k - l=11*10*9=990. Let&#39;s compute k and l to confirm.First polynomial: 11(x -10)(x -9). The vertex is at x=(10 +9)/2=9.5. The value is 11*(9.5 -10)(9.5 -9)=11*(-0.5)(0.5)=11*(-0.25)= -2.75. So k= -2.75.Second polynomial: 11(x -10)(x +9). The vertex is at x=(10 -9)/2=0.5. The value is 11*(0.5 -10)(0.5 +9)=11*(-9.5)(9.5)=11*(-90.25)= -992.75. So l= -992.75.Then k - l= (-2.75) - (-992.75)=990. Correct. So k - l is indeed 990 in this case.Therefore, the answer is 990. Therefore, the maximum possible value of k - l is boxed{990}.Final Answerboxed{990}&lt;/think&gt;Vijay chooses three distinct integers (a, b, c) from the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 11}). We need to compute the maximum possible value of (k - l), where (k) is the minimum value of the polynomial (a(x - b)(x - c)) and (l) is the minimum value of the polynomial (a(x - b)(x + c)).First, we analyze the polynomials:1. The polynomial (a(x - b)(x - c)) expands to (a x^2 - a(b + c)x + abc). The minimum value (k) occurs at the vertex (x = frac{b + c}{2}) and is given by:   [   k = a left[ bc - frac{(b + c)^2}{4} right]   ]2. The polynomial (a(x - b)(x + c)) expands to (a x^2 + a(c - b)x - abc). The minimum value (l) occurs at the vertex (x = frac{b - c}{2}) and is given by:   [   l = -a left[ bc + frac{(c - b)^2}{4} right]   ]We then compute the difference (k - l):[k - l = a left[ bc - frac{(b + c)^2}{4} right] - left( -a left[ bc + frac{(c - b)^2}{4} right] right)]Simplifying this expression, we find:[k - l = a left[ 2bc + frac{(c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2}{4} right]]Expanding and simplifying the terms inside the brackets:[(c - b)^2 - (b + c)^2 = -4bc]Thus,[k - l = a left[ 2bc - bc right] = abc]To maximize (k - l), we need to maximize the product (abc) where (a, b, c) are distinct integers from the set ({1, 2, ldots, 11}). The maximum product is achieved with (a = 11), (b = 10), and (c = 9), giving:[11 times 10 times 9 = 990]Therefore, the maximum possible value of (k - l) is (boxed{990}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem where Vijay chooses three distinct integers a, b, c from the set {1,2,3,...,11}. Then, we need to consider two polynomials: a(x - b)(x - c) and a(x - b)(x + c). For each polynomial, we find the minimum value they take over all real numbers x, which are called k and l respectively. The goal is to compute the maximum possible value of k - l. First, I need to understand what these polynomials look like and how their minimum values are determined. Both polynomials are quadratic functions since when expanded, they will have an x² term. The leading coefficient is &#39;a&#39; in both cases, which is a positive integer between 1 and 11 (since a, b, c are distinct integers from that set). Quadratic functions have a vertex which is their minimum or maximum point. Since the leading coefficient is positive (a &gt; 0), the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is the minimum point. Therefore, the minimum value k of the first polynomial a(x - b)(x - c) is the y-coordinate of its vertex. Similarly, the minimum value l of the second polynomial a(x - b)(x + c) is also the y-coordinate of its vertex. To find the vertex of a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c, the x-coordinate is at -b/(2a). Then, plugging that back into the function gives the y-coordinate. However, since our quadratics are given in factored form, maybe it&#39;s easier to work with that.Let me first write out both polynomials in standard form to find their vertices.Starting with the first polynomial: a(x - b)(x - c). Let&#39;s expand this:a(x - b)(x - c) = a[(x)(x) - xc - bx + bc] = a[x² - (b + c)x + bc] = a x² - a(b + c)x + a bcSo, the standard form is f(x) = a x² - a(b + c)x + a bc. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -B/(2A) where A = a, B = -a(b + c). So:x_vertex = -(-a(b + c))/(2a) = (a(b + c))/(2a) = (b + c)/2Then, plugging this back into the function to find k, the minimum value:k = a[( (b + c)/2 - b )( (b + c)/2 - c )] + ... Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to use the standard formula. The y-coordinate of the vertex for a quadratic f(x) = Ax² + Bx + C is given by f(-B/(2A)). Alternatively, since we already expanded it:k = a[( ( (b + c)/2 )² - (b + c)( (b + c)/2 ) + bc ]But maybe it&#39;s easier to compute f((b + c)/2). Let&#39;s compute it step by step:f((b + c)/2) = a[( ( (b + c)/2 - b ) * ( ( (b + c)/2 - c ) ) ]Simplify each term:First term: ( (b + c)/2 - b ) = (b + c - 2b)/2 = (c - b)/2Second term: ( (b + c)/2 - c ) = (b + c - 2c)/2 = (b - c)/2Multiplying these two terms: (c - b)/2 * (b - c)/2 = ( - (b - c) )/2 * (b - c)/2 = - (b - c)^2 / 4Therefore, f((b + c)/2) = a * ( - (b - c)^2 / 4 ) = - a (b - c)^2 / 4So, k = - a (b - c)^2 / 4Similarly, let&#39;s do the same for the second polynomial: a(x - b)(x + c)Expanding this:a(x - b)(x + c) = a[x² + cx - bx - bc] = a x² + a(c - b)x - a bcSo, the standard form is f(x) = a x² + a(c - b)x - a bcAgain, the x-coordinate of the vertex is -B/(2A), where A = a, B = a(c - b). So:x_vertex = - (a(c - b)) / (2a) = - (c - b)/2 = (b - c)/2Then, compute l, the minimum value:Plugging x = (b - c)/2 into the polynomial:f((b - c)/2) = a[ ( (b - c)/2 - b ) ( (b - c)/2 + c ) ]Simplify each term:First term: ( (b - c)/2 - b ) = (b - c - 2b)/2 = (-b - c)/2Second term: ( (b - c)/2 + c ) = (b - c + 2c)/2 = (b + c)/2Multiplying these two terms:(-b - c)/2 * (b + c)/2 = [ - (b + c) / 2 ] * [ (b + c) / 2 ] = - (b + c)^2 / 4Therefore, f((b - c)/2) = a * [ - (b + c)^2 / 4 ] = - a (b + c)^2 / 4So, l = - a (b + c)^2 / 4Therefore, we have:k = - a (b - c)^2 / 4l = - a (b + c)^2 / 4Therefore, the difference k - l is:k - l = [ - a (b - c)^2 / 4 ] - [ - a (b + c)^2 / 4 ] = [ -a (b - c)^2 + a (b + c)^2 ] / 4Factor out a/4:= a/4 [ - (b - c)^2 + (b + c)^2 ]Now, expand both squares:First, (b + c)^2 = b² + 2bc + c²Second, (b - c)^2 = b² - 2bc + c²Therefore:- (b - c)^2 + (b + c)^2 = - (b² - 2bc + c²) + (b² + 2bc + c²) = -b² + 2bc - c² + b² + 2bc + c² = 4bcThus, k - l = a/4 * 4 bc = a bcWait, that&#39;s a big simplification! So k - l = a bcBut that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again.Starting from k - l:= [ - a (b - c)^2 / 4 ] - [ - a (b + c)^2 / 4 ]= (-a/4)[ (b - c)^2 - (b + c)^2 ]Wait, that might be a miscalculation. Let me redo the subtraction:k - l = [ - a (b - c)^2 / 4 ] - [ - a (b + c)^2 / 4 ]= (-a/4)(b - c)^2 + (a/4)(b + c)^2= a/4 [ (b + c)^2 - (b - c)^2 ]Which, when expanded, is:= a/4 [ (b² + 2bc + c²) - (b² - 2bc + c²) ] = a/4 [4bc] = a bcYes, that&#39;s correct. So, k - l = a * b * cWait, that seems surprising, but algebraically it checks out. Let me verify with specific numbers to ensure that I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Suppose a = 1, b = 1, c = 2.First polynomial: 1(x - 1)(x - 2). Its minimum k is at x = (1 + 2)/2 = 1.5. The value is 1*(1.5 - 1)*(1.5 - 2) = 1*(0.5)*(-0.5) = -0.25. So k = -0.25.Second polynomial: 1(x - 1)(x + 2). Its minimum l is at x = (1 - 2)/2 = -0.5. The value is 1*(-0.5 - 1)*(-0.5 + 2) = (-1.5)*(1.5) = -2.25. So l = -2.25.Then k - l = -0.25 - (-2.25) = 2.0. But according to the formula, a*b*c = 1*1*2 = 2. So that&#39;s correct.Another example: a = 2, b = 3, c = 4.First polynomial: 2(x - 3)(x - 4). Minimum k at x = (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5. Value is 2*(3.5 - 3)*(3.5 - 4) = 2*(0.5)*(-0.5) = 2*(-0.25) = -0.5. So k = -0.5.Second polynomial: 2(x - 3)(x + 4). Minimum l at x = (3 - 4)/2 = -0.5. Value is 2*(-0.5 - 3)*(-0.5 + 4) = 2*(-3.5)*(3.5) = 2*(-12.25) = -24.5. So l = -24.5.k - l = -0.5 - (-24.5) = 24.0. According to the formula, a*b*c = 2*3*4 = 24. Correct again.So the conclusion is that k - l = a*b*c. Therefore, the maximum possible value of k - l is the maximum possible value of a*b*c where a, b, c are distinct integers from {1,2,...,11}.Wait, but the problem states that Vijay chooses three distinct integers a, b, c from the set {1,2,...,11}. So, to maximize a*b*c, we need to choose the three largest distinct numbers in the set. The set goes up to 11, so the three largest numbers are 9, 10, 11. So the maximum product is 9*10*11 = 990.However, I need to confirm whether the problem allows a, b, c to be arranged in any order. But since a, b, c are just distinct integers from the set, and in the polynomials, b and c are used in different ways. In the first polynomial, it&#39;s (x - b)(x - c), and in the second, it&#39;s (x - b)(x + c). But since the formula k - l = a*b*c came out regardless of the positions of b and c? Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, in the derivation above, k - l = a*b*c, but in the polynomials, b and c are used differently. In the first polynomial, both are subtracted, so (x - b)(x - c), leading to vertex at (b + c)/2. In the second polynomial, it&#39;s (x - b)(x + c) = (x - b)(x - (-c)), so effectively, one root is at b and the other at -c. Therefore, the vertex is at (b - c)/2. But in our calculation, we derived that regardless of the positions, the difference k - l simplifies to a*b*c. Wait, but in the first example I took, a=1, b=1, c=2, the product a*b*c=2, which is correct. However, in that case, c was 2, and in the second polynomial, we had (x - 1)(x + 2). So even though the second polynomial has a term (x + c), which would be (x - (-c)), the formula still holds. So in general, k - l = a*b*c, regardless of the signs in the polynomial? Because even if we have (x + c), which is (x - (-c)), the formula still uses c as a positive integer. But in the set {1,2,...,11}, all numbers are positive, so c is a positive integer, but in the second polynomial, we have (x + c) = (x - (-c)). However, in the formula for l, which is the minimum of a(x - b)(x + c), we ended up with l = -a(b + c)^2 /4, but in the calculation, we considered c as positive. Wait, but c is chosen from the set {1,2,...,11}, which are all positive. So in the second polynomial, (x + c) is just shifting the root to the left by c units. But according to the algebra, regardless of the signs, the difference k - l = a*b*c. Therefore, to maximize k - l, we just need to maximize the product a*b*c with a, b, c distinct in {1,2,...,11}.But wait, in the problem statement, Vijay chooses three distinct integers a, b, c from the set. So a, b, c are all distinct. Therefore, the maximum product is choosing the three largest numbers, 9, 10, 11. However, their product is 9*10*11=990. But wait, is that correct?Wait, hold on. Wait, in our formula, k - l = a*b*c. But in the problem, we have to choose a, b, c distinct. So, yes, the maximum possible product is 9*10*11=990. But let&#39;s confirm with smaller numbers. For example, if a=10, b=11, c=9, then the product is same. So regardless of the order of a, b, c, the product a*b*c is same. But in our problem, a is the coefficient of the quadratic, and b and c are the roots (shifted in one case). But the formula k - l = a*b*c holds regardless of their positions? Wait, but in the derivation, the positions of b and c in the polynomials are different. In the first polynomial, both are subtracted, in the second polynomial, one is subtracted and the other is added. However, in the derivation, we still ended up with k - l = a*b*c. So, is the formula independent of how b and c are arranged?Wait, let&#39;s test with a different arrangement. Let&#39;s take a=2, b=1, c=3.First polynomial: 2(x - 1)(x - 3). Vertex at (1 + 3)/2 = 2. The minimum value k is 2*(2 - 1)*(2 - 3) = 2*(1)*(-1) = -2. So k = -2.Second polynomial: 2(x - 1)(x + 3). Vertex at (1 - 3)/2 = -1. The minimum value l is 2*(-1 - 1)*(-1 + 3) = 2*(-2)*(2) = -8. So l = -8.Then k - l = -2 - (-8) = 6. The product a*b*c = 2*1*3 = 6. Correct again. So even if a is not the largest number, the formula holds. So as long as a, b, c are distinct, the product a*b*c is the value of k - l. Therefore, to maximize k - l, we need to maximize the product a*b*c with a, b, c distinct in {1,2,...,11}. Therefore, the maximum product is indeed 9*10*11 = 990. So the answer should be 990. However, let&#39;s confirm that there isn&#39;t a higher product with different choices.Wait, the three largest numbers in the set {1,2,...,11} are 9,10,11. Their product is 9*10*11=990. The next possible would be 8*10*11=880, which is less. 9*8*11=792, also less. So 990 is indeed the maximum.But hold on a second. Wait, in the problem statement, Vijay chooses three distinct integers a, b, c from the set. But in the polynomials, a is the coefficient, but b and c are used as roots (shifted). However, according to the formula k - l = a*b*c, the product is just the product of the three numbers, regardless of their roles. So as long as we choose a, b, c to be the three largest numbers, regardless of which is a, which is b, which is c, the product will be same. Therefore, assigning a=9, b=10, c=11 or a=10, b=11, c=9, etc., all result in the same product a*b*c=990. Therefore, the maximum possible value of k - l is 990.Wait, but let me check if the formula holds when we permute a, b, c. Suppose a=11, b=9, c=10. Then k - l should be 11*9*10=990. Let&#39;s verify.First polynomial: 11(x - 9)(x - 10). The vertex is at (9 + 10)/2 = 9.5. The minimum value k is 11*(9.5 - 9)*(9.5 - 10) = 11*(0.5)*(-0.5) = 11*(-0.25) = -2.75.Second polynomial: 11(x - 9)(x + 10). The vertex is at (9 - 10)/2 = -0.5. The minimum value l is 11*(-0.5 - 9)*(-0.5 + 10) = 11*(-9.5)*(9.5) = 11*(-90.25) = -992.75.Then k - l = -2.75 - (-992.75) = 990. Correct. So the formula holds regardless of the permutation of a, b, c. Therefore, as long as a, b, c are the three largest numbers, the product is 990, which is the maximum.But wait, in the problem statement, a, b, c are distinct integers from {1,2,...,11}. So they can be any three distinct numbers, not necessarily the largest. Therefore, 9,10,11 are allowed as they are all in the set. So their product is 990, which would be the maximum. Therefore, the answer should be 990.But just to be thorough, is there a possibility that using different numbers (not the three largest) could result in a higher product? For example, using 10,11, and 8? 10*11*8=880, which is less than 990. 9*10*11=990 vs 8*9*10=720. So indeed, 9,10,11 gives the maximum product. Alternatively, maybe using a=11 and b=10, c=9, but as shown earlier, the product is the same. So yes, 990 is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the answer is 990. So the maximum possible value of k - l is 990.But just to ensure that there are no constraints I missed in the problem. The problem says Vijay chooses three distinct integers a, b, c from the set {1,2,...,11}. Then compute k - l where k is the minimum of the first polynomial and l is the minimum of the second polynomial. We derived that k - l = a*b*c, which is correct through examples. Therefore, the maximum value is the maximum product of three distinct integers in the set. Therefore, 9*10*11=990. Hence, the answer is 990.Final Answerboxed{990}&lt;/think&gt;Vijay chooses three distinct integers (a, b, c) from the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 11}). We need to compute the maximum possible value of (k - l), where (k) is the minimum value of the polynomial (a(x - b)(x - c)) and (l) is the minimum value of the polynomial (a(x - b)(x + c)).1. Finding (k) and (l):   - The polynomial (a(x - b)(x - c)) is a quadratic function. The minimum value (k) occurs at the vertex (x = frac{b + c}{2}).   - The polynomial (a(x - b)(x + c)) is another quadratic function. The minimum value (l) occurs at the vertex (x = frac{b - c}{2}).2. Calculating (k) and (l):   - For (k), substituting (x = frac{b + c}{2}) into the polynomial gives:     [     k = a left( frac{b + c}{2} - b right) left( frac{b + c}{2} - c right) = -frac{a(b - c)^2}{4}     ]   - For (l), substituting (x = frac{b - c}{2}) into the polynomial gives:     [     l = a left( frac{b - c}{2} - b right) left( frac{b - c}{2} + c right) = -frac{a(b + c)^2}{4}     ]3. Difference (k - l):   - The difference (k - l) is calculated as:     [     k - l = -frac{a(b - c)^2}{4} - left( -frac{a(b + c)^2}{4} right) = frac{a}{4} left[ (b + c)^2 - (b - c)^2 right]     ]   - Simplifying the expression inside the brackets:     [     (b + c)^2 - (b - c)^2 = 4bc     ]   - Therefore, (k - l = a cdot b cdot c).4. Maximizing (a cdot b cdot c):   - The maximum product of three distinct integers from the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 11}) is achieved with the three largest numbers: (9), (10), and (11).   - The product is (9 times 10 times 11 = 990).Thus, the maximum possible value of (k - l) is (boxed{990}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🔑:</span>Answer:990Solution: Quadratics are minimized at the average of their roots, sobegin{aligned}k &amp; =aleft(frac{b+c}{2}-bright)left(frac{b+c}{2}-cright)=aleft(frac{b-c}{2}right)left(frac{c-b}{2}right)=-frac{a(b-c)^{2}}{4}, text { and } l &amp; =aleft(frac{b-c}{2}-bright)left(frac{b-c}{2}+cright)=aleft(frac{-b-c}{2}right)left(frac{b+c}{2}right)=-frac{a(b+c)^{2}}{4} .end{aligned}Therefore,k-l=-frac{a}{4}left((b-c)^{2}-(b+c)^{2}right)=a b cThus, k-l=a b c is maximized when a, b, and c are 9,10 , and 11 are some order, so the answer is 9 cdot 10 cdot 11=990.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-7b758c3c data-v-84ea8c19><div class="review" data-v-84ea8c19><div class="review-title" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>❓:</span>18.

Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step. The problem is about an equilateral triangle ABC. Then, we extend AB to a point D so that B is the midpoint of AD. Then there&#39;s a variable point E such that DE equals AB. We need to find the angle BED when the distance between C and E is maximized. Hmm, okay, let&#39;s start by drawing a diagram in my mind.First, ABC is an equilateral triangle. All sides are equal, so AB = BC = CA. Let&#39;s denote each side as length s. Since it&#39;s equilateral, all angles are 60 degrees. Now, we need to extend AB to D such that B is the midpoint of AD. So, starting from A, going through B, and then extending to D so that AB = BD. Therefore, AD is twice AB. Since AB is length s, AD must be 2s. So, BD is equal to AB, which is s.Next, we have a variable point E on the plane such that DE = AB, which is s. So, E lies somewhere on a circle of radius s centered at D. The problem says when the distance between C and E is as large as possible, what is the angle BED. So, we need to maximize CE, given that E is on the circle with center D and radius s, then find angle BED in that configuration.Let me think. To maximize the distance CE, where E is on the circle centered at D with radius s. The maximum distance from a point C to a point on a circle is the distance from C to the center D plus the radius of the circle. So, CE_max = CD + DE. But DE is s, so CE_max = CD + s. Therefore, E must lie on the line CD extended beyond D, such that DE = s. Wait, but we need to confirm if that&#39;s the case. The maximum distance from C to a point on the circle would indeed be when E is in the direction away from C from D. So, if we draw the line CD, then the farthest E would be on the line CD, on the opposite side of D from C, at a distance s from D.But first, let&#39;s confirm the position of point D. Since ABC is equilateral, and AD is twice AB. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let&#39;s place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me choose coordinates such that point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (1, 0). Since it&#39;s an equilateral triangle, point C will be at (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Then, since B is the midpoint of AD, D must be at (2, 0). Because AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), so AD is from (0,0) to (2,0), with midpoint at B (1,0).So, coordinates:- A: (0, 0)- B: (1, 0)- C: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2)- D: (2, 0)Now, point E is such that DE = AB. Since AB is 1 (from (0,0) to (1,0)), DE must also be 1. Therefore, E lies on a circle with center D (2,0) and radius 1.We need to find the position of E on this circle that maximizes the distance CE. Then, once we have that E, we need to find angle BED.To find E that maximizes CE, as I thought earlier, the maximum distance from C to a point on the circle centered at D with radius 1 is CD + radius. Let&#39;s compute CD. C is at (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), D is at (2,0).So, distance CD is sqrt[(2 - 0.5)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[2.25 + 0.75] = sqrt[3] ≈ 1.732. So, CE_max = sqrt(3) + 1. Therefore, E lies along the line CD extended beyond D, at a distance 1 from D. So, the coordinates of E can be found by moving from D in the direction away from C by 1 unit.First, let&#39;s find the direction vector from C to D. D - C = (2 - 0.5, 0 - sqrt(3)/2) = (1.5, -sqrt(3)/2). The unit vector in this direction is (1.5 / sqrt(3), -sqrt(3)/2 / sqrt(3)) = (1.5 / sqrt(3), -0.5). Wait, let me compute the magnitude of vector CD:|CD| = sqrt[(1.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[2.25 + 0.75] = sqrt[3], as we had before. So, unit vector in direction CD is (1.5 / sqrt(3), -sqrt(3)/2 / sqrt(3)) = ( (3/2)/sqrt(3), - (sqrt(3)/2)/sqrt(3) ) = ( (3)/(2 sqrt(3)), - (1/2) ) = ( sqrt(3)/2, -1/2 ). Since 3/(2 sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/2. So, the unit vector is (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2).Therefore, moving from D in the direction opposite to C (to go away from C) would be the negative of this unit vector. Wait, no. If we want to go from D away from C, we need to go in the direction opposite to CD. The direction from C to D is (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2). Therefore, the direction from D away from C would be the same as the direction from C to D. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think.If we are at point D and want to move away from C, the direction is along the line CD, extended beyond D. So, the vector from C to D is (1.5, -sqrt(3)/2). So, the direction from D away from C is the same direction as from C to D. Therefore, the unit vector is (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2). Therefore, moving from D in that direction by 1 unit. Wait, but the unit vector is already in the direction from C to D. So, adding that to D would take us further away from C.Therefore, coordinates of E would be D + (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2) * 1. Let&#39;s compute that. D is at (2,0). So, E is at (2 + sqrt(3)/2, 0 - 1/2) = (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2).Therefore, E is at (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2). Now, we need to compute angle BED. Points B, E, D. So, angle at E between points B and D. Wait, angle BED is the angle at E between points B, E, D. So, vertex at E, with segments EB and ED. So, to find angle BED, we can compute the angle between vectors EB and ED.First, let&#39;s find coordinates of points:- B: (1, 0)- E: (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2)- D: (2, 0)So, vectors:- EB = B - E = (1 - (2 + sqrt(3)/2), 0 - (-1/2)) = (-1 - sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)- ED = D - E = (2 - (2 + sqrt(3)/2), 0 - (-1/2)) = (-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)Now, to find the angle between vectors EB and ED, we can use the dot product formula:cos(theta) = (EB . ED) / (|EB| |ED|)First, compute the dot product:EB . ED = [(-1 - sqrt(3)/2)(-sqrt(3)/2)] + [(1/2)(1/2)]Let&#39;s compute each term:First term: (-1 - sqrt(3)/2)(-sqrt(3)/2) = (1)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 + (3/4)Second term: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4So, total dot product = sqrt(3)/2 + 3/4 + 1/4 = sqrt(3)/2 + 1Now, compute |EB|:|EB| = sqrt[(-1 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 + (1/2)^2]Let&#39;s compute each component:First component squared: (-1 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (1 + sqrt(3) + 3/4) = 1 + sqrt(3) + 0.75 = 1.75 + sqrt(3)Wait, wait, let&#39;s expand it properly:(-1 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (-1)^2 + 2*(-1)*(-sqrt(3)/2) + (-sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1 + sqrt(3) + (3/4) = 1 + sqrt(3) + 0.75 = 1.75 + sqrt(3)Second component squared: (1/2)^2 = 1/4Therefore, |EB| = sqrt[(1.75 + sqrt(3)) + 0.25] = sqrt[2 + sqrt(3)]Similarly, compute |ED|:|ED| = sqrt[(-sqrt(3)/2)^2 + (1/2)^2] = sqrt[(3/4) + (1/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1Therefore, the denominator is |EB| |ED| = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) * 1 = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3))So, cos(theta) = (sqrt(3)/2 + 1) / sqrt(2 + sqrt(3))Hmm, need to compute this. Let&#39;s rationalize or simplify the expression.First, let&#39;s compute sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)). I recall that sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) can be expressed as sqrt( (sqrt(3)/2 + 1/2)^2 ). Wait, let me check:Suppose sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Then, squaring both sides:2 + sqrt(3) = a + b + 2 sqrt(ab)Comparing, we have:a + b = 22 sqrt(ab) = sqrt(3) =&gt; sqrt(ab) = sqrt(3)/2 =&gt; ab = 3/4So, solving:a + b = 2ab = 3/4This is a quadratic equation: x^2 - 2x + 3/4 = 0Solutions: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 3)] / 2 = [2 ± 1]/2 =&gt; 3/2 or 1/2Therefore, sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3/2) + sqrt(1/2) = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2Yes, that&#39;s a known identity: sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2Similarly, sqrt(2 - sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(6) - sqrt(2))/2Therefore, sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2So, going back to cos(theta):cos(theta) = (sqrt(3)/2 + 1) / [ (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2 ] = [ (sqrt(3) + 2)/2 ] / [ (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2 ] = (sqrt(3) + 2)/(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))Let&#39;s rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)):Numerator: (sqrt(3) + 2)(sqrt(6) - sqrt(2))Denominator: (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))(sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)) = 6 - 2 = 4Compute numerator:First, expand (sqrt(3) + 2)(sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)):sqrt(3)*sqrt(6) - sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(2)Simplify each term:sqrt(3*6) = sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2)sqrt(3*2) = sqrt(6)2*sqrt(6) remains as is2*sqrt(2) remains as isSo, the terms are:3 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6) + 2 sqrt(6) - 2 sqrt(2)Combine like terms:3 sqrt(2) - 2 sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)-sqrt(6) + 2 sqrt(6) = sqrt(6)Therefore, numerator is sqrt(2) + sqrt(6)Therefore, cos(theta) = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))/4But wait, (sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))/4 is known. That&#39;s equal to cos(15°). Because cos(15°) = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4 ≈ 0.9659, which matches. Wait, no, cos(15°) is approximately 0.9659, which is (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4 ≈ (2.449 + 1.414)/4 ≈ 3.863/4 ≈ 0.9659. Correct.But wait, we have cos(theta) = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))/4 = cos(15°), so theta = 15°, which is π/12 radians. However, wait, angle BED is 15 degrees? Let me verify.Wait, but wait, angle at E is 15 degrees? Let me check again.Wait, let&#39;s check the calculation again.We had:cos(theta) = [sqrt(3)/2 + 1] / sqrt(2 + sqrt(3))After simplifying, we found that equals (sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))/4, which is cos(15°). Therefore, theta = 15°, which is 15 degrees. So angle BED is 15 degrees.But wait, in the problem statement, when we maximize CE, is the angle at E (BED) 15 degrees? Let me confirm with another approach.Alternatively, perhaps there is a geometric interpretation. Since DE = AB = 1, and BD = AB = 1, BD = DE. Hmm, BD is 1, DE is 1, so BD = DE. So triangle BDE is isoceles with BD = DE. But wait, BD is from B(1,0) to D(2,0), which is length 1. DE is also 1, so point E is such that DE = 1, so from D(2,0), moving 1 unit in some direction. But in our case, when CE is maximized, E is located at (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2). So, let&#39;s compute BE and BD and see.Wait, angle at E between B and D. So, triangle BED with sides BE, ED, and BD. BD is 1, ED is 1, BE is sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)), as we found earlier. Wait, if BD = 1 and DE = 1, then triangle BDE has two sides equal (BD and DE) only if BE is the base. But in our case, BE is sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)), which is approximately sqrt(2 + 1.732) ≈ sqrt(3.732) ≈ 1.931, which is longer than BD and DE. Therefore, triangle BDE is not isoceles unless BE is equal to BD or DE, which it isn&#39;t. Wait, BD is 1, DE is 1, but BE is longer. So, in that case, angle at E would be opposite to the side BD, which is 1. Wait, in triangle BED, sides:- BE: sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) ≈ 1.931- ED: 1- BD: 1Therefore, angle at E is opposite BD (which is 1). Wait, but in triangle BED, angle at E is between BE and ED, with lengths 1.931 and 1. So, the angle is calculated via the cosine law as we did before, giving 15 degrees. Alternatively, since BD is 1, and we have angle at E as 15 degrees, then using the Law of Sines, sin(angle at E)/BD = sin(angle at B)/ED. Wait, maybe that&#39;s complicating.Alternatively, if we accept that the cosine of the angle is (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4, which is cos(15°), then angle BED is 15 degrees, which is π/12. So, 15°, which is 15 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 15 degrees, so boxed as boxed{15^circ}.But wait, the problem says &quot;what is ∠BED&quot;. So, the angle in degrees. But let me verify once again.Wait, let me check with coordinates. Points:- B: (1,0)- E: (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2)- D: (2,0)Compute vectors EB and ED:EB vector: from E to B: (1 - (2 + sqrt(3)/2), 0 - (-1/2)) = (-1 - sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)ED vector: from E to D: (2 - (2 + sqrt(3)/2), 0 - (-1/2)) = (-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)Then, the angle between these two vectors. The dot product was:(-1 - sqrt(3)/2)(-sqrt(3)/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = sqrt(3)/2 + 3/4 + 1/4 = sqrt(3)/2 + 1The magnitudes:|EB| = sqrt[ (-1 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ] = sqrt[1 + sqrt(3) + 3/4 + 1/4] = sqrt[2 + sqrt(3)]|ED| = 1So, cos(theta) = (sqrt(3)/2 + 1)/sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3)/2 + 1)/sqrt(2 + sqrt(3))Multiply numerator and denominator by 2:= (sqrt(3) + 2)/[2 sqrt(2 + sqrt(3))]But sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2, so substituting:= (sqrt(3) + 2)/[2*(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/2] = (sqrt(3) + 2)/(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)):= [ (sqrt(3) + 2)(sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)) ] / [ (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))(sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)) ]Denominator: 6 - 2 = 4Numerator:sqrt(3)*sqrt(6) - sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(2)= sqrt(18) - sqrt(6) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(2)= 3*sqrt(2) - sqrt(6) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(2)= (3 sqrt(2) - 2 sqrt(2)) + (-sqrt(6) + 2 sqrt(6))= sqrt(2) + sqrt(6)Therefore, cos(theta) = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))/4 = cos(15°). Therefore, theta = 15°, which is 15 degrees.Therefore, angle BED is 15 degrees. So, the answer is 15 degrees, so boxed{15^circ}.But let me just confirm once again to make sure. If E is located such that CE is maximum, which is along the line CD extended beyond D, at a distance DE = AB = 1. Then, the coordinates of E are correct. Then, calculating the angle at E between points B and D gives 15 degrees. So, I think that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, perhaps using some geometric properties. Since ABC is equilateral, and D is such that AD is twice AB, and DE = AB, maybe there&#39;s some symmetry or triangle congruence. But perhaps the coordinate method is straightforward here.Therefore, I think the answer is 15 degrees.Final Answerboxed{15^circ}&lt;/think&gt;Let ( ABC ) be an equilateral triangle with side length ( s ). Extend ( overrightarrow{AB} ) to a point ( D ) such that ( B ) is the midpoint of ( overline{AD} ). Thus, ( AD = 2s ) and ( BD = s ). A variable point ( E ) is such that ( DE = AB = s ). We need to find the angle ( angle BED ) when the distance ( CE ) is maximized.1. Coordinates of Points:   - ( A ) is at ( (0, 0) )   - ( B ) is at ( (1, 0) )   - ( C ) is at ( left( frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) )   - ( D ) is at ( (2, 0) )2.

Vectors and Angle Calculation:   - Vectors ( overrightarrow{EB} ) and ( overrightarrow{ED} ):     [     overrightarrow{EB} = left( 1 - left( 2 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right), 0 - left( -frac{1}{2} right) right) = left( -1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{1}{2} right)     ]     [     overrightarrow{ED} = left( 2 - left( 2 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right), 0 - left( -frac{1}{2} right) right) = left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{1}{2} right)     ]   - Dot product and magnitudes:     [     overrightarrow{EB} cdot overrightarrow{ED} = left( -1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) + left( frac{1}{2} right) left( frac{1}{2} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 1     ]     [     |overrightarrow{EB}| = sqrt{left( -1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{1}{2} right)^2} = sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}     ]     [     |overrightarrow{ED}| = 1     ]   - Cosine of the angle:     [     cos(theta) = frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 1}{sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}} = frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4} = cos(15^circ)     ]   - Therefore, ( theta = 15^circ ).The angle ( angle BED ) when ( CE ) is maximized is (boxed{15^circ}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have an equilateral triangle ABC. That means all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees each. Then, they&#39;re extending the vector AB to a point D such that B is the midpoint of AD. Hmm, so vector AB is being extended past B to D, making B the midpoint. That should mean that AD is twice as long as AB. Since AB is a side of the equilateral triangle, let&#39;s say each side is length s. Then AB = s, so AD should be 2s, meaning BD is also s. So, D is a point such that it&#39;s on the line extended from AB beyond B, and BD = AB. Got that.Now, there&#39;s a variable point E on the plane such that DE = AB. So DE is also length s. The problem asks for the angle BED when the distance between C and E is maximized. So, we need to find E such that DE = AB (so DE = s) and CE is as large as possible. Then, once we have that E, we need to find the measure of angle BED.Let me start by sketching this in my mind. We have triangle ABC with AB = BC = CA = s. Point D is on the extension of AB beyond B, so the order is A --- B --- D, with AB = BD = s. Then point E is somewhere such that DE = s. The set of all such E&#39;s is a circle with center at D and radius s. We need to find the point E on this circle that is farthest from point C. The maximum distance CE would be the distance from C to D plus the radius of the circle, right? Because the farthest point on a circle from a given point is along the line connecting the center of the circle to that point, extended outward. So if we can draw a line from C through D, then the intersection of that line with the circle (on the side away from C) would be the farthest E. Wait, but the circle is centered at D with radius s. So if the distance CD is fixed, then the maximum CE would be CD + DE, but DE is s. Wait, but DE is the radius, so CE would be CD + s. But only if E is colinear with C and D, beyond D. So E would lie on the line CD, beyond D, such that DE = s. Then CE would be CD + s. That makes sense.So first, let&#39;s find coordinates to model this. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let&#39;s place point A at (0, 0). Since ABC is equilateral, point B can be at (s, 0). Then point C would be at (s/2, (s√3)/2). That&#39;s because in an equilateral triangle, the height is (s√3)/2. Then point D is on the extension of AB beyond B, so since AB is from (0,0) to (s,0), extending to D which is s units beyond B. So D would be at (2s, 0).Now, point E lies on a circle centered at D (2s, 0) with radius s. So the equation of this circle is (x - 2s)^2 + y^2 = s^2. We need to find the point E on this circle that is farthest from point C (s/2, (s√3)/2).To maximize the distance CE, as I thought before, E should lie along the line CD extended beyond D. Let&#39;s verify that. The point farthest from C on the circle would be in the direction away from C. So if we consider the vector from C to D, and extend it past D by the radius s, that should give the farthest point.First, let&#39;s compute the coordinates of D, which is (2s, 0). The coordinates of C are (s/2, (s√3)/2). The vector from C to D is (2s - s/2, 0 - (s√3)/2) = (3s/2, - (s√3)/2). To go from D in the same direction (away from C) for a distance s, we need to find the unit vector in the direction from C to D, multiply it by s, and add that to D.First, compute the length of CD. The distance between C and D is sqrt[(3s/2)^2 + ( - s√3/2)^2] = sqrt[(9s²/4) + (3s²/4)] = sqrt[12s²/4] = sqrt[3s²] = s√3. So the unit vector in the direction from C to D is (3s/2)/(s√3), (-s√3/2)/(s√3)) = (3/(2√3), -1/(2)). Simplify that: 3/(2√3) = √3/2, so the unit vector is (√3/2, -1/2).Therefore, moving from D in this direction (since we want to go away from C) for a distance s would give the point E. So E&#39;s coordinates would be D plus the unit vector times s:E_x = 2s + (√3/2)*s = 2s + (s√3)/2E_y = 0 + (-1/2)*s = -s/2So E is at (2s + (s√3)/2, -s/2). Now, we need to find the angle BED. Points B, E, D.Point B is at (s, 0). Point E is at (2s + (s√3)/2, -s/2). Point D is at (2s, 0).So angle BED is the angle at point E between points B and D. So we need to find angle BED, which is the angle at E formed by points B, E, D.To compute this angle, we can use vectors. Let&#39;s compute vectors EB and ED, then find the angle between them.First, vector EB is from E to B: (s - (2s + (s√3)/2), 0 - (-s/2)) = (s - 2s - (s√3)/2, s/2) = (-s - (s√3)/2, s/2)Vector ED is from E to D: (2s - (2s + (s√3)/2), 0 - (-s/2)) = (- (s√3)/2, s/2)Now, the angle between vectors EB and ED can be found using the dot product formula:cos(theta) = (EB · ED) / (|EB| |ED|)First, compute the dot product:EB · ED = [(-s - (s√3)/2) * (-s√3/2)] + [(s/2) * (s/2)]Compute each term:First term: (-s - (s√3)/2) * (-s√3/2) = [s + (s√3)/2] * (s√3/2) = s*(s√3/2) + (s√3/2)*(s√3/2) = (s²√3)/2 + (3s²)/4Second term: (s/2)*(s/2) = s²/4So total dot product:(s²√3)/2 + (3s²)/4 + s²/4 = (s²√3)/2 + (4s²)/4 = (s²√3)/2 + s²Now, compute |EB| and |ED|:First, |EB|:EB is (-s - (s√3)/2, s/2)|EB| = sqrt[ (-s - (s√3)/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 ]Compute (-s - (s√3)/2)^2:= [ -s(1 + (√3)/2) ]^2 = s²(1 + (√3)/2)^2 = s²[1 + √3 + 3/4] = s²[ (4 + 4√3 + 3)/4 ] = s²(7 + 4√3)/4Then (s/2)^2 = s²/4So |EB| = sqrt[ s²(7 + 4√3)/4 + s²/4 ] = sqrt[ s²(8 + 4√3)/4 ] = sqrt[ s²(2 + √3) ] = s√(2 + √3)Similarly, |ED|:ED is (- (s√3)/2, s/2)|ED| = sqrt[ ( - (s√3)/2 )^2 + (s/2)^2 ] = sqrt[ (3s²/4) + (s²/4) ] = sqrt[4s²/4] = sqrt[s²] = sSo, |ED| = s.Therefore, cos(theta) = [ (s²√3)/2 + s² ] / [ s√(2 + √3) * s ] = [ (√3/2 + 1) s² ] / [ s²√(2 + √3) ) ] = (√3/2 + 1) / √(2 + √3)Simplify numerator and denominator:Let me compute √3/2 + 1 = 1 + √3/2. Let&#39;s write it as (2 + √3)/2.So numerator is (2 + √3)/2, denominator is √(2 + √3). Therefore,cos(theta) = [ (2 + √3)/2 ] / √(2 + √3) = (2 + √3)^(1) / 2 / (2 + √3)^(1/2) ) = (2 + √3)^(1 - 1/2) / 2 = (2 + √3)^(1/2)/2But √(2 + √3) is equal to something. Let me recall that √(2 + √3) can be written as √[(√3/2 + 1/2)*2]... Wait, maybe better to rationalize or recall exact value.Alternatively, note that cos(15°) = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ 0.9659, and 2 + √3 ≈ 3.732, so sqrt(3.732) ≈ 1.931, which is approximately twice cos(15°). Indeed, 1.931 / 2 ≈ 0.9655, which is close to cos(15°). So sqrt(2 + √3) = 2 cos(15°). Therefore, sqrt(2 + √3)/2 = cos(15°). Therefore, cos(theta) = cos(15°), so theta = 15°. Therefore, angle BED is 15 degrees.Wait, but let me verify that sqrt(2 + √3) is indeed 2 cos(15°). Let&#39;s compute 2 cos(15°). Cos(15°) is cos(45° - 30°) = cos45 cos30 + sin45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ (2.449 + 1.414)/4 ≈ 3.863/4 ≈ 0.9659. Then 2 cos(15°) ≈ 1.931, and sqrt(2 + √3) ≈ sqrt(2 + 1.732) ≈ sqrt(3.732) ≈ 1.931, which matches. Therefore, sqrt(2 + √3) = 2 cos(15°). Therefore, sqrt(2 + √3)/2 = cos(15°). Therefore, cos(theta) = cos(15°), so theta = 15°, which is 15 degrees. So angle BED is 15 degrees.But wait, 15 degrees is π/12 radians. So the answer is 15 degrees. Therefore, the angle BED is 15 degrees. So, I need to check if my steps are correct.Wait, but let me verify once again. Let me compute (2 + √3)/2 divided by sqrt(2 + √3):(2 + √3)/2 divided by sqrt(2 + √3) = (2 + √3)/(2 sqrt(2 + √3)) ). Let me square this value to see if it&#39;s equal to [ (2 + √3)^2 ] / [4 (2 + √3) ) ] = (2 + √3)/4. Wait, but that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that (2 + √3)/sqrt(2 + √3) = sqrt(2 + √3). Because (2 + √3) = [sqrt(2 + √3)]^2. Therefore, (2 + √3)/sqrt(2 + √3) = sqrt(2 + √3). Therefore, the expression is sqrt(2 + √3)/2, which as established is cos(15°). Therefore, yes, theta is 15 degrees.Therefore, the angle BED is 15 degrees. So the answer is 15°, which is 15 degrees, so the box answer should be boxed{15^circ}.But let me check if there could be another approach or if I made a mistake in coordinates.Alternatively, using complex numbers. Let me assign coordinates again. Let me set AB to be along the x-axis. Let me set point A at (0,0), B at (1,0), so ABC is equilateral, so C is at (0.5, √3/2). Then point D is the midpoint of AD, with B being the midpoint. So since AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), then AD must be such that B is the midpoint, so D is at (2,0). So AD is from (0,0) to (2,0), with midpoint at (1,0), which is B. Then DE = AB = 1. So E is on the circle centered at D (2,0) with radius 1. Then, the maximum distance CE is achieved when E is along the line CD extended beyond D. Let&#39;s compute coordinates of C (0.5, √3/2) and D (2,0). The line CD goes from (0.5, √3/2) to (2,0). The direction vector is (2 - 0.5, 0 - √3/2) = (1.5, -√3/2). The unit vector in this direction is (1.5, -√3/2) divided by its length. The length of CD is sqrt( (1.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. So unit vector is (1.5/sqrt(3), (-√3/2)/sqrt(3)) = (1.5/sqrt(3), - (√3)/(2 sqrt(3))) = (1.5/sqrt(3), -1/2). Simplify 1.5/sqrt(3): 1.5 is 3/2, so (3/2)/sqrt(3) = (3)/(2 sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/2 after rationalizing. Therefore, unit vector is (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2). Therefore, moving from D in the direction away from C (which would be the same as the direction from C to D) gives us point E as D + 1 * unit vector: (2,0) + (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2) = (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2). So coordinates of E are (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2). Then points B is at (1,0), E is at (2 + sqrt(3)/2, -1/2), and D is at (2,0). So angle BED is the angle at E between points B, E, D. So vectors EB and ED. Vector EB is B - E = (1 - (2 + sqrt(3)/2), 0 - (-1/2)) = (-1 - sqrt(3)/2, 1/2). Vector ED is D - E = (2 - (2 + sqrt(3)/2), 0 - (-1/2)) = (- sqrt(3)/2, 1/2). Then the dot product is (-1 - sqrt(3)/2)(- sqrt(3)/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2 + 3/4) + 1/4 = sqrt(3)/2 + 1. The magnitudes: |EB| = sqrt[ (-1 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ] = sqrt[ (1 + sqrt(3) + 3/4) + 1/4 ] = sqrt[ 1 + sqrt(3) + 1 ] = sqrt[2 + sqrt(3)]. |ED| = sqrt[ (- sqrt(3)/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ] = sqrt[ 3/4 + 1/4 ] = sqrt[1] = 1. Therefore, cos(theta) = (sqrt(3)/2 + 1)/sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = ( (2 + sqrt(3))/2 ) / sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) ) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3))/2. Which is equal to cos(15°), as before. Therefore, theta = 15°, so angle BED is 15 degrees. So this confirms my previous result.Therefore, the answer is 15 degrees, so boxed{15^circ}.Final Answerboxed{15^circ}&lt;/think&gt;Given an equilateral triangle (ABC) with (AB = BC = CA = s). Point (D) is such that (B) is the midpoint of (overline{AD}), making (AD = 2s) and (BD = s). A variable point (E) lies on a circle centered at (D) with radius (s). We need to find the angle (angle BED) when the distance (CE) is maximized.1. Coordinates Setup:   - (A(0, 0)), (B(s, 0)), (Cleft(frac{s}{2}, frac{ssqrt{3}}{2}right)), (D(2s, 0)).2. Maximizing (CE):   - The farthest point (E) from (C) on the circle centered at (D) lies on the line extending from (C) through (D). This point (E) is found by moving (s) units from (D) in the direction away from (C).3. Direction Vector:   - Vector (CD) is (left(frac{3s}{2}, -frac{ssqrt{3}}{2}right)).   - Unit vector in the direction of (CD) is (left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, -frac{1}{2}right)).4. Coordinates of (E):   - (E) is at (left(2s + frac{ssqrt{3}}{2}, -frac{s}{2}right)).5. Vectors Calculation:   - Vector (EB = left(-s - frac{ssqrt{3}}{2}, frac{s}{2}right)).   - Vector (ED = left(-frac{ssqrt{3}}{2}, frac{s}{2}right)).6. Angle Calculation:   - Dot product: (EB cdot ED = frac{s^2sqrt{3}}{2} + s^2).   - Magnitudes: (|EB| = ssqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}), (|ED| = s).   - (cos(theta) = frac{sqrt{3}/2 + 1}{sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}} = cos(15^circ)).Thus, the angle (angle BED) is (boxed{15^circ}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🔑:</span>18. 15^{circ}To make C and E as far as possible, C, D, E must be collinear in that order.With angle A B C=60^{circ}, we have angle C B D=120^{circ}.

The question is asking about the relationship between the coefficient of determination, R-squared (R²), and the sum of squares of residuals. The options are whether the sum becomes smaller, larger, may vary, or none of the above when R² is larger. Let me start by recalling what I know about these concepts.First, in regression analysis, R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that&#39;s explained by the independent variables in the model. So, a higher R² means that more variance is explained, which intuitively should mean that the model fits the data better. The sum of squares of residuals, often called the residual sum of squares (RSS), is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the model. So, RSS = Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)². If the model fits the data well, these residuals should be small, leading to a smaller RSS.Now, the formula for R-squared is R² = 1 - (RSS/TSS), where TSS is the total sum of squares. TSS is the total variance in the dependent variable and is calculated as Σ(y_i - ȳ)², where ȳ is the mean of the dependent variable. So, if R² increases, that means the fraction (RSS/TSS) must decrease because R² is 1 minus that fraction. Since TSS is a constant for a given dataset (it doesn&#39;t depend on the model), if R² becomes larger, RSS must become smaller. Because if you have 1 - (RSS/TSS) getting bigger, then (RSS/TSS) has to get smaller, which, since TSS is fixed, RSS must decrease.Let me test this with an example. Suppose TSS is 100. If R² is 0.8, then RSS = TSS*(1 - R²) = 100*(0.2) = 20. If R² increases to 0.9, then RSS = 100*(0.1) = 10. So yes, RSS decreased when R² increased. This seems to confirm that as R² becomes larger, RSS becomes smaller.But wait, is there any scenario where increasing R² might not lead to a decrease in RSS? Let me think. Suppose you add more variables to the model. Adding more variables generally increases R² because you&#39;re explaining more variance, but it can also lead to overfitting. However, even in overfitting, the R² calculated on the same data used to fit the model will always increase (or stay the same) as you add more variables. Therefore, in that case, RSS would decrease. But if you adjust R², like adjusted R-squared, that&#39;s a different measure which penalizes adding variables, but the question here is about the regular R².Therefore, in the context of a single model or comparing models on the same dataset, a higher R² directly corresponds to a lower RSS. Therefore, the answer should be A: becomes smaller.But let me check another angle. What if the TSS changes? Wait, no, TSS is based on the variance of the dependent variable in the dataset. So if you have the same dataset, TSS is fixed. Therefore, R² is directly related to 1 - RSS/TSS. Therefore, if R² increases, RSS must decrease.Another thought: in some cases, if you have a different dataset, but the question doesn&#39;t mention different datasets. The question is in the context of regression analysis, so presumably for the same dataset and model. Therefore, higher R² implies lower RSS. So answer A is correct.But wait, is there a possibility of confusion between different types of sum of squares? For example, in some contexts, people talk about explained sum of squares (ESS) versus RSS. Since R² is ESS/TSS, and ESS + RSS = TSS. Therefore, if ESS increases, RSS decreases. Since R² = ESS/TSS, higher R² means higher ESS, hence lower RSS. Therefore, yes, A is correct.Therefore, the answer is A: becomes smaller.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;In regression analysis, the coefficient of determination ( R^2 ) represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. The sum of squares of residuals (RSS) is the sum of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable.The formula for ( R^2 ) is given by:[ R^2 = 1 - frac{text{RSS}}{text{TSS}} ]where TSS (Total Sum of Squares) is the total variance in the dependent variable and is calculated as:[ text{TSS} = sum (y_i - bar{y})^2 ]Since TSS is a constant for a given dataset, an increase in ( R^2 ) implies that the fraction (frac{text{RSS}}{text{TSS}}) must decrease. Therefore, if ( R^2 ) increases, RSS must decrease. This relationship holds because a higher ( R^2 ) indicates a better fit of the model to the data, resulting in smaller residuals.Thus, the correct answer is:[boxed{A}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the relationship between the coefficient of determination, R-squared, and the sum of squares of residuals in regression analysis. The question is asking whether a larger R-squared makes the sum of squares of residuals (SSR) become smaller, larger, may vary, or none of the above. Let me think step by step.First, I remember that R-squared is a measure of how well the regression model explains the variance of the dependent variable. It&#39;s calculated as the ratio of the explained variation to the total variation. The formula for R-squared is:[ R^2 = 1 - frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} ]Where:- ( SS_{res} ) is the sum of squares of residuals (also called the residual sum of squares)- ( SS_{tot} ) is the total sum of squares, which is the sum of squares of the deviations of the observed values from the mean.So if I rearrange this formula to solve for ( SS_{res} ), I get:[ SS_{res} = (1 - R^2) times SS_{tot} ]This equation tells me that as R-squared increases, ( 1 - R^2 ) decreases, which means that ( SS_{res} ) must decrease as well, assuming that ( SS_{tot} ) remains constant. Since ( SS_{tot} ) is a measure of the total variance in the dependent variable, it doesn&#39;t depend on the regression model—it&#39;s just a property of the data. Therefore, if ( R^2 ) gets larger, the sum of squares of residuals becomes smaller. Let me verify this with an example. Suppose we have a dataset where ( SS_{tot} ) is 100. If ( R^2 ) is 0.8, then ( SS_{res} = (1 - 0.8) times 100 = 20 ). If ( R^2 ) increases to 0.9, then ( SS_{res} = (1 - 0.9) times 100 = 10 ). So indeed, as R-squared increases, the sum of residuals squared decreases. That seems to confirm option A: becomes smaller.Wait, but I should check if there are any edge cases or exceptions. For instance, if the model is perfect, ( R^2 = 1 ), then ( SS_{res} = 0 ). If the model is no better than the mean, ( R^2 = 0 ), then ( SS_{res} = SS_{tot} ). So the relationship is inverse: higher R-squared means lower residual sum of squares.Is there a scenario where increasing R-squared could lead to a larger sum of squares? Hmm. If the model is worse, but somehow R-squared increases? Wait, R-squared is based on the comparison of the residual sum of squares to the total sum of squares. If the model is worse, the residuals should be larger, which would decrease R-squared. So, in normal circumstances, they move in opposite directions.But could adding more variables to the model (which can sometimes lead to overfitting) affect this? Even if you add variables, the R-squared will never decrease in the training data—it can only stay the same or increase. But in that case, the residual sum of squares would decrease or stay the same. But the question isn&#39;t about adding variables; it&#39;s just about the relationship between R-squared and SSR. So regardless of how you achieve a higher R-squared, the SSR must decrease. Therefore, the answer should be A: becomes smaller.Wait, but wait. There&#39;s a possible confusion here. In some contexts, the sum of squares of residuals is denoted as SSE (sum of squared errors) and sometimes SSR is used for the regression sum of squares. Wait, different textbooks might use different notations. Let me confirm.In some sources:- SST = Total sum of squares- SSR = Regression sum of squares (explained)- SSE = Error sum of squares (residuals)But in others:- SST = Total sum of squares- SSE = Explained sum of squares- SSR = Residual sum of squaresHmm, that&#39;s conflicting. Wait, this is a crucial point. Depending on the notation, SSR can mean different things. Let me check.The question here specifically says &quot;the sum of squares of residuals&quot;, so regardless of notation, we are talking about the sum of the squared residuals, which is the same as SSE (error sum of squares) in some notations. However, the key is that regardless of notation, the formula for R-squared is always 1 minus (SS_res / SS_tot). So SS_res is definitely the residual sum of squares. Therefore, the problem is using SSR to denote the residual sum of squares here. Wait, but in the question, the acronym in parentheses is (quad). The original problem says:&quot;In regression analysis, the larger the value of the coefficient of determination ( R^{2} ), the sum of squares of residuals ((quad)) A: becomes smaller...&quot;So the question is using &quot;sum of squares of residuals&quot; which is unambiguous. So regardless of notation, that&#39;s the residual sum of squares. So according to the formula, as R-squared increases, this residual sum must decrease. So the answer is A.Therefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is A: becomes smaller.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;In regression analysis, the coefficient of determination ( R^2 ) is calculated as:[ R^2 = 1 - frac{SS_{text{res}}}{SS_{text{tot}}} ]where ( SS_{text{res}} ) is the sum of squares of residuals and ( SS_{text{tot}} ) is the total sum of squares. Rearranging this formula gives:[ SS_{text{res}} = (1 - R^2) times SS_{text{tot}} ]As ( R^2 ) increases, the term ( 1 - R^2 ) decreases, leading to a decrease in ( SS_{text{res}} ) assuming ( SS_{text{tot}} ) remains constant. For example, if ( SS_{text{tot}} = 100 ), an increase in ( R^2 ) from 0.8 to 0.9 results in ( SS_{text{res}} ) decreasing from 20 to 10. Thus, a larger ( R^2 ) value indicates a smaller sum of squares of residuals. The answer is confirmed to be:boxed{A}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🔑:</span>To judge the fitting effect of the model using the value of the coefficient R^2, the larger R^2 is, the better the fitting effect of the model. Similarly, when using the correlation coefficient r to judge the fitting effect of the model, the larger the absolute value of r is, the better the fitting effect of the model.  From this, it can be inferred that the larger the value of the coefficient of determination R^{2}, the smaller the sum of squares of residuals.  Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{A}.  According to the formulas and properties of regression analysis, the measures that can be used to assess the quality of the simulation effect include the coefficient of determination, the sum of squares of residuals, and the correlation coefficient. Only a smaller sum of squares of residuals indicates a better effect; the larger values for the others indicate better effects.  This question tests knowledge of regression analysis and is considered a basic question. The key to solving this question is understanding how the magnitude of several measures reflects the quality of the fitting effect.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-7b758c3c data-v-84ea8c19><div class="review" data-v-84ea8c19><div class="review-title" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>❓:</span>Which is larger: 1985^{1986} or 1986^{1985}?</div><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out whether 1985^1986 is larger than 1986^1985 or the other way around. Hmm, exponents can be tricky, especially when both the base and the exponent are different. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when comparing numbers with large exponents, it&#39;s often helpful to take the natural logarithm of both sides. Because the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, if we take ln(a) and ln(b), then a &gt; b if and only if ln(a) &gt; ln(b). So, that could be a good way to simplify the comparison.Let me write that down:We need to compare 1985^1986 and 1986^1985.Take the natural logarithm of both:ln(1985^1986) = 1986 * ln(1985)ln(1986^1985) = 1985 * ln(1986)So now, the problem reduces to comparing 1986 * ln(1985) and 1985 * ln(1986). If 1986 * ln(1985) &gt; 1985 * ln(1986), then 1985^1986 is larger, otherwise, 1986^1985 is larger.So, let&#39;s compute the ratio of these two terms. If we divide both sides, we can see:(1986 / 1985) compared to (ln(1986) / ln(1985))Wait, let me clarify. Let&#39;s rearrange the inequality:Is 1986 * ln(1985) &gt; 1985 * ln(1986)?Dividing both sides by 1985 * 1986 gives:(ln(1985)/1985) compared to (ln(1986)/1986)So, the question becomes: which is larger, (ln(1985)/1985) or (ln(1986)/1986)?If ln(n)/n is a decreasing function for large n, then ln(1985)/1985 would be larger than ln(1986)/1986, meaning that 1986 * ln(1985) &gt; 1985 * ln(1986), which would imply that 1985^1986 is larger. Conversely, if ln(n)/n is increasing, then the opposite would be true.Therefore, I need to check whether the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is increasing or decreasing around n = 1985.To find this out, I can compute the derivative of f(n). Let&#39;s recall:f(n) = ln(n)/nThe derivative f’(n) is [1/n * n - ln(n) * 1] / n^2 = (1 - ln(n)) / n^2So, f’(n) = (1 - ln(n)) / n^2The sign of the derivative depends on the numerator: 1 - ln(n). When is 1 - ln(n) positive? When ln(n) &lt; 1, which is when n &lt; e. Since e is approximately 2.718, for all n ≥ 3, ln(n) &gt; 1, so f’(n) is negative. Therefore, for n ≥ 3, the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing.Therefore, since 1985 and 1986 are both much larger than e, the function is decreasing in that interval. Therefore, ln(1985)/1985 &gt; ln(1986)/1986.Thus, going back to the original inequality:1986 * ln(1985) &gt; 1985 * ln(1986)Which implies that ln(1985^1986) &gt; ln(1986^1985), so 1985^1986 &gt; 1986^1985.Therefore, 1985^1986 is larger.Wait, but let me verify this with some smaller numbers to see if my logic holds. For example, let&#39;s take n=2 and n=3.Compare 2^3 vs 3^2. 8 vs 9. So 3^2 is larger. Hmm, here n=2 and n=3. But according to our function f(n) = ln(n)/n, ln(2)/2 ≈ 0.3466, ln(3)/3 ≈ 0.3662. Wait, but 0.3466 &lt; 0.3662, so ln(2)/2 &lt; ln(3)/3, which would mean 3 * ln(2) &lt; 2 * ln(3), so 2^3 &lt; 3^2. Which is correct. So in this case, even though n=2 and n=3 are both greater than e, the function f(n) is decreasing, so ln(n)/n should be decreasing, but here ln(3)/3 is larger than ln(2)/2. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion?Wait, but according to the derivative, for n &gt;=3, the function is decreasing. Wait, let&#39;s check the derivative at n=2 and n=3.At n=2, f&#39;(n) = (1 - ln(2))/4 ≈ (1 - 0.6931)/4 ≈ 0.3069/4 ≈ 0.0767, which is positive. So at n=2, the function is still increasing. Then, when does f(n) start decreasing?Set derivative to zero: 1 - ln(n) = 0 → ln(n) = 1 → n = e ≈ 2.718.So for n &lt; e, f(n) is increasing, and for n &gt; e, f(n) is decreasing.So n=2 is less than e, so increasing, n=3 is greater than e, so decreasing.Wait, so at n=3, the function is decreasing. So ln(3)/3 ≈ 1.0986/3 ≈ 0.3662Compare to ln(4)/4 ≈ 1.3863/4 ≈ 0.3466So yes, from n=3 to n=4, it&#39;s decreasing. So starting at n=3, the function decreases.But when n=2 to n=3, even though n=3 is past e, but n=2 is below e, so the function increases from n=2 to n=e, then decreases from n=e onwards.Therefore, in the case of n=2 and n=3, even though n=3 is past e, since n=2 is below e, the function is still increasing.But in our original problem, both numbers are way above e (1985 and 1986), so the function is decreasing. Therefore, as n increases beyond e, the function f(n) = ln(n)/n decreases. Therefore, for our numbers, since 1986 &gt; 1985, ln(1986)/1986 &lt; ln(1985)/1985.Therefore, going back, 1986 * ln(1985) &gt; 1985 * ln(1986), so 1985^1986 &gt; 1986^1985.But just to make sure, maybe try an example where both numbers are above e. Let&#39;s take n=4 and n=5.Compare 4^5 vs 5^4. 1024 vs 625. 4^5 is larger. Wait, so here, n=4 and n=5. Both above e. Since the function is decreasing, ln(4)/4 ≈ 0.3466, ln(5)/5 ≈ 0.3219. So ln(4)/4 &gt; ln(5)/5. Therefore, 5 * ln(4) &gt; 4 * ln(5). Therefore, 4^5 &gt; 5^4. Which is true. So that example works.Another example: n=3 and n=4. Compare 3^4=81 vs 4^3=64. 3^4 is larger. Similarly, ln(3)/3 ≈ 0.3662 vs ln(4)/4 ≈ 0.3466. So 4 * ln(3) ≈ 1.4648 vs 3 * ln(4) ≈ 4.158. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 3^4 vs 4^3.Wait, ln(3^4) = 4 * ln(3) ≈ 4 * 1.0986 ≈ 4.3944ln(4^3) = 3 * ln(4) ≈ 3 * 1.3863 ≈ 4.1589So 4.3944 &gt; 4.1589, so 3^4 &gt; 4^3. Which is correct.So, in these examples, when both numbers are above e, the smaller base raised to the higher exponent is larger. So, for n and n+1, both above e, then n^(n+1) is larger than (n+1)^n. But wait, that&#39;s not always true. For example, when n=1: 1^2 vs 2^1. 1 vs 2. 2 is larger. But n=1 is below e. When n=2: 2^3 vs 3^2. 8 vs 9. 3^2 is larger. Hmm, but n=2 is still below e. At n=3: 3^4 vs 4^3. 81 vs 64. 3^4 is larger. So when n=3 (which is above e), n^(n+1) is larger. So perhaps the trend is that once n &gt;=3, n^(n+1) is larger than (n+1)^n.Wait, but let&#39;s check n=5 vs n=6.5^6 vs 6^5. 15625 vs 7776. 5^6 is larger. Similarly, 6^7 vs 7^6. 6^7 = 279,936 vs 7^6 = 117,649. 6^7 is larger. Wait, but wait, 6^7 is 6^(6+1) and 7^6. So here, the pattern continues. So is it the case that for n &gt;=3, n^(n+1) is always larger than (n+1)^n?But wait, when n approaches infinity, the limit of n^(n+1)/(n+1)^n as n approaches infinity is equal to limit n * (n/(n+1))^n. Since (n/(n+1))^n = 1/(1 + 1/n)^n ≈ 1/e as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit is n * (1/e) → infinity. Therefore, as n becomes very large, n^(n+1) is way larger than (n+1)^n. So the trend continues.But then, why in the case of n=1 and n=2, the opposite happens? Because for n=1 and n=2, the function hasn&#39;t started decreasing yet? Wait, no. The function f(n)=ln(n)/n starts decreasing after n=e. So for n &gt;=3, it&#39;s decreasing. So, as n increases beyond e, f(n) decreases. Therefore, when comparing n and n+1 (both above e), the ratio ln(n)/n &gt; ln(n+1)/(n+1), which implies that (n+1) ln(n) &gt; n ln(n+1), which implies n^(n+1) &gt; (n+1)^n. Therefore, n^(n+1) is indeed larger for n &gt;=3. So this seems to hold.Therefore, in our original problem, since 1985 and 1986 are both greater than e, and the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing for n &gt;=3, then 1985^1986 should be larger than 1986^1985.But let me see if there is another way to think about this. Maybe using the concept of exponents growth rates. For example, exponential functions grow faster than polynomial functions. But in this case, both are exponential functions with different bases and exponents.Alternatively, perhaps using the ratio test. Let&#39;s compute the ratio of 1985^1986 / 1986^1985 and see if it&#39;s greater than 1 or not.So, ratio = (1985^1986) / (1986^1985) = 1985 * (1985/1986)^1985Because 1985^1986 = 1985^(1985 +1) = 1985^1985 * 1985, and 1986^1985 is as it is. So, ratio = 1985 * (1985/1986)^1985So, if we can show that 1985 * (1985/1986)^1985 &gt; 1, then 1985^1986 is larger.Alternatively, since (1985/1986) is less than 1, raising it to the 1985th power will make it very small. But we also multiply by 1985, so maybe it&#39;s still greater than 1.But how can we compute or estimate this?Alternatively, take the natural logarithm of the ratio:ln(ratio) = ln(1985) + 1985 * ln(1985/1986)= ln(1985) + 1985 * [ln(1985) - ln(1986)]= ln(1985) + 1985 * ln(1985) - 1985 * ln(1986)= 1986 * ln(1985) - 1985 * ln(1986)Which is exactly the same as before. So we get back to the same comparison. Therefore, if we can show that ln(ratio) &gt; 0, then ratio &gt; 1.So, the key is to show that 1986 * ln(1985) - 1985 * ln(1986) &gt; 0.Alternatively, divide both sides by 1985 * 1986:[ln(1985)/1985] - [ln(1986)/1986] &gt; 0But this is equivalent to the difference between two consecutive terms of the function f(n) = ln(n)/n. Since f(n) is decreasing, f(1985) &gt; f(1986), so the difference f(1985) - f(1986) &gt; 0. Therefore, the above expression is positive, so ln(ratio) &gt; 0, so ratio &gt; 1, so 1985^1986 &gt; 1986^1985.Therefore, the answer should be 1985^1986 is larger.But just to be thorough, let me see if there&#39;s an approximation we can use for ln(n+1) - ln(n), or something similar. Maybe using the Taylor series expansion or the logarithm approximation.Recall that ln(n+1) ≈ ln(n) + 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ... for large n.But perhaps it&#39;s better to use the difference:ln(1986) - ln(1985) = ln(1986/1985) = ln(1 + 1/1985) ≈ 1/1985 - 1/(2*1985^2) + ...So, approximately, ln(1986) ≈ ln(1985) + 1/1985 - 1/(2*1985^2)Then, let&#39;s compute 1986 * ln(1985) - 1985 * ln(1986):= 1986 * ln(1985) - 1985 * [ln(1985) + 1/1985 - 1/(2*1985^2)]= 1986 * ln(1985) - 1985 * ln(1985) - 1985*(1/1985) + 1985*(1/(2*1985^2))= ln(1985) - 1 + 1/(2*1985)So, this simplifies to:ln(1985) - 1 + 1/(2*1985)Now, we can compute ln(1985). Let&#39;s estimate ln(1985). Since 1985 is a large number, but perhaps we can relate it to known values. We know that ln(1000) ≈ 6.9078, ln(2000) ≈ 7.6009. So 1985 is close to 2000. Let&#39;s approximate ln(1985):Compute ln(1985) ≈ ln(2000) - ln(2000/1985) ≈ 7.6009 - ln(1.007556).Using the approximation ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 for small x:x = 0.007556ln(1.007556) ≈ 0.007556 - (0.007556)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.007556 - 0.0000285 ≈ 0.0075275Therefore, ln(1985) ≈ 7.6009 - 0.0075275 ≈ 7.59337So, ln(1985) ≈ 7.5934Therefore, ln(1985) - 1 + 1/(2*1985) ≈ 7.5934 - 1 + 0.000252 ≈ 6.5934 + 0.000252 ≈ 6.59365So, this is a positive number. Therefore, 1986 * ln(1985) - 1985 * ln(1986) ≈ 6.59365 &gt; 0. Therefore, ln(ratio) &gt; 0, so ratio &gt;1, so 1985^1986 is larger.Therefore, this approximation also supports the conclusion.Alternatively, maybe using the inequality:For n ≥ 3, n^(n+1) &gt; (n+1)^nWhich seems to hold for n=3,4,5,... as we saw in the examples. Since 1985 is much larger than 3, this inequality would definitely hold.Therefore, by generalization, 1985^1986 &gt; 1986^1985.Thus, after going through multiple methods: comparing logarithms, calculating the derivative of the function ln(n)/n to confirm it&#39;s decreasing for n &gt; e, checking with numerical examples, approximating the logarithmic difference, and considering the general inequality for n &gt;=3, all approaches lead to the conclusion that 1985^1986 is larger than 1986^1985.Final Answerboxed{1985^{1986}}&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether (1985^{1986}) or (1986^{1985}) is larger, we compare the natural logarithms of both expressions:[ln(1985^{1986}) = 1986 ln(1985)][ln(1986^{1985}) = 1985 ln(1986)]We need to compare (1986 ln(1985)) and (1985 ln(1986)). This can be done by examining the ratio:[frac{ln(1985)}{1985} quad text{and} quad frac{ln(1986)}{1986}]The function (f(n) = frac{ln(n)}{n}) is decreasing for (n geq 3) because its derivative (f&#39;(n) = frac{1 - ln(n)}{n^2}) is negative for (n &gt; e). Since both 1985 and 1986 are much larger than (e), (f(n)) is decreasing. Therefore, (frac{ln(1985)}{1985} &gt; frac{ln(1986)}{1986}).This implies:[1986 ln(1985) &gt; 1985 ln(1986)]Taking the exponential of both sides, we conclude that (1985^{1986} &gt; 1986^{1985}).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{1985^{1986}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out whether 1985^1986 is larger than 1986^1985 or the other way around. Hmm, comparing two numbers with both large bases and exponents. This seems a bit tricky because both numbers are enormous, but maybe there&#39;s a mathematical technique or theorem that can help me compare them without actually computing them. Let me recall. I remember that when comparing exponents like a^b vs b^a, sometimes taking the natural logarithm of both sides can help. Since the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, if I take the natural log of both numbers, whichever is larger will still maintain that relationship. So, let me try that approach.Let me denote the two numbers as A = 1985^1986 and B = 1986^1985. Taking the natural logarithm of both:ln(A) = 1986 * ln(1985)ln(B) = 1985 * ln(1986)So, to compare A and B, I can compare ln(A) and ln(B). If ln(A) &gt; ln(B), then A &gt; B; otherwise, B &gt; A.Therefore, the problem reduces to determining whether 1986 * ln(1985) is greater than 1985 * ln(1986). Let me write that inequality:1986 * ln(1985) &gt; 1985 * ln(1986)If this inequality holds, then A is larger; otherwise, B is larger.To make this comparison easier, maybe I can divide both sides by 1985 * 1986 to simplify the inequality. Let&#39;s see:Dividing both sides by 1985 * 1986 gives:(ln(1985))/1985 &gt; (ln(1986))/1986So now the question becomes: is the value of (ln(n)/n) greater at n=1985 or at n=1986? Therefore, if the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing at n=1985, then ln(1985)/1985 &gt; ln(1986)/1986, which would imply A &gt; B. Conversely, if f(n) is increasing at that point, then B would be larger. So, I need to determine whether the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is increasing or decreasing around n=1985. To do this, I can compute the derivative of f(n) with respect to n and check its sign.Calculating the derivative f&#39;(n):f(n) = ln(n)/nUsing the quotient rule: f&#39;(n) = [ (1/n) * n - ln(n) * 1 ] / n^2Simplifying numerator: (1 - ln(n)) / n^2So, f&#39;(n) = (1 - ln(n)) / n^2Wait, hold on, let&#39;s check that derivative again. Let me do it step by step.The derivative of ln(n) is 1/n, and the derivative of 1/n is -1/n². So, using the quotient rule:If f(n) = numerator/denominator, where numerator = ln(n), denominator = n.Then f&#39;(n) = [ (derivative of numerator * denominator) - (numerator * derivative of denominator) ] / denominator^2So that&#39;s [ (1/n * n) - (ln(n) * 1) ] / n^2Simplify numerator:(1 - ln(n)) / n^2Yes, that&#39;s correct. So, f&#39;(n) = (1 - ln(n))/n²Therefore, the sign of f&#39;(n) depends on the numerator (1 - ln(n)) because the denominator n² is always positive. So, if (1 - ln(n)) &gt; 0, then f(n) is increasing; if it&#39;s &lt; 0, f(n) is decreasing.So, set (1 - ln(n)) &gt; 0:1 - ln(n) &gt; 0=&gt; ln(n) &lt; 1=&gt; n &lt; e^1 ≈ 2.718Therefore, for n &lt; e, the function f(n) is increasing, and for n &gt; e, it&#39;s decreasing.Since our n here is 1985 and 1986, both of which are much larger than e ≈ 2.718, the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing for n &gt;=3. Therefore, since 1985 &lt; 1986, f(1985) &gt; f(1986), which means that ln(1985)/1985 &gt; ln(1986)/1986. Therefore, going back to the earlier inequality:1986 * ln(1985) &gt; 1985 * ln(1986) =&gt; ln(A) &gt; ln(B) =&gt; A &gt; B. So, 1985^1986 is larger than 1986^1985.But wait, let me verify if this is always the case. I remember that for numbers where a and b are both greater than e, sometimes the comparison can depend on how close they are. For example, I recall that 3^4 vs 4^3, 3^4 is 81 and 4^3 is 64, so 3^4 is bigger. Similarly, 4^5 vs 5^4: 1024 vs 625, so 4^5 is bigger. But 2^3 vs 3^2: 8 vs 9, so 3^2 is bigger. Wait, so there&#39;s a point where it flips?Wait, the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing for n &gt; e, but when comparing a^b vs b^a, even when both a and b are above e, the comparison isn&#39;t straightforward. Wait, but in our previous examples, for n and n+1, when does (n+1)^n become larger than n^(n+1)?Wait, maybe there&#39;s a specific point where this happens. For example, let&#39;s take n=2: 2^3=8 vs 3^2=9, 3^2 is larger. For n=3: 3^4=81 vs 4^3=64, 3^4 is larger. For n=4: 4^5=1024 vs 5^4=625, 4^5 is larger. So starting from n=3, n^(n+1) is larger than (n+1)^n. Wait, but when n=1: 1^2=1 vs 2^1=2, 2 is larger. So n=1, n=2: (n+1)^n is larger. For n &gt;=3, n^(n+1) is larger. So is there a general rule here?Alternatively, perhaps the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing, so for m &gt; n &gt; e, f(n) &gt; f(m). Therefore, if we have two numbers a and b, both greater than e, then if a &lt; b, f(a) &gt; f(b). Therefore, if we compare a^b and b^a, we can take the ratio:(a^b)/(b^a) = (a/b)^b * e^{a} ??? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, take the ln of both:ln(a^b) = b ln aln(b^a) = a ln bSo, compare b ln a vs a ln b. Which is equivalent to comparing (ln a)/a vs (ln b)/b. Since if a &lt; b and f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing, then (ln a)/a &gt; (ln b)/b. Therefore, b ln a &gt; a ln b =&gt; a^b &gt; b^a. Therefore, for a &lt; b, with a and b greater than e, then a^b &gt; b^a.So, in our case, since 1985 &lt; 1986, and both are much greater than e, then 1985^1986 &gt; 1986^1985.But wait, this seems to contradict my previous example with n=2 and n=3. Wait, when a=3 and b=4, a &lt; b, then a^b=81, b^a=64, so 3^4 &gt; 4^3. Similarly, a=4, b=5: 4^5=1024 &gt; 5^4=625. So in those cases, a^b &gt; b^a. However, when a=2, b=3: a^b=8 &lt; b^a=9. So here, even though a=2 &lt; b=3, which are both greater than e (since e≈2.718), but 2 &lt; e &lt;3. So 2 is less than e, 3 is greater than e. Therefore, in that case, a=2 is less than e, so the function f(n) is increasing for n &lt; e and decreasing for n &gt; e. So when a &lt; e &lt; b, then f(a) &lt; f(b) if a is increasing and b is decreasing? Wait, no. Let me think again.The function f(n)=ln(n)/n increases until n=e and then decreases after that. So when comparing a=2 and b=3, since 2 &lt; e &lt;3, f(2) is in the increasing part and f(3) is in the decreasing part. But even so, f(2)=ln(2)/2≈0.3466, f(3)=ln(3)/3≈0.3662. So f(3) is actually greater than f(2). Therefore, (ln 2)/2 &lt; (ln 3)/3, so 3*ln2 &lt; 2*ln3, so ln(2^3)=ln8 &lt; ln(3^2)=ln9, which is true. Therefore, 2^3 &lt;3^2. But when a=3 and b=4: f(3)=ln3/3≈0.3662, f(4)=ln4/4≈0.3466. So f(3) &gt; f(4), so 4*ln3 &gt;3*ln4, so ln(3^4) &gt; ln(4^3), so 3^4 &gt;4^3. Similarly, for a=4, b=5: f(4)=≈0.3466, f(5)=ln5/5≈1.6094/5≈0.3219. So f(4) &gt; f(5), so 5*ln4 &gt;4*ln5, so ln(4^5) &gt; ln(5^4), so 4^5 &gt;5^4.Therefore, the key is that once both a and b are above e, then the smaller one raised to the larger exponent is bigger. But when one is below e and the other above, it can vary. Since in the original problem, both 1985 and 1986 are way above e, so according to this, since 1985 &lt;1986, then 1985^1986 &gt;1986^1985. Therefore, the answer should be 1985^1986 is larger.But to make sure, maybe I can test with a slightly larger number. Let&#39;s say n=10 and n=11. Let&#39;s compute 10^11 vs 11^10. 10^11 is 100,000,000,000. 11^10: 11*11=121, 121*11=1331, 1331*11=14641, 14641*11=161051, 161051*11=1,771,561, 1,771,561*11=19,487,171, 19,487,171*11=214,358,881, 214,358,881*11=2,357,947,691, 2,357,947,691*11=25,937,424,601. So 11^10 is about 25.9 billion, while 10^11 is 100 billion. So 10^11 is larger. Therefore, even when n=10, which is well above e, 10^11 &gt;11^10.Therefore, this seems to confirm that for n and n+1, when n &gt;=3, n^{n+1} &gt; (n+1)^n. So in our original problem, 1985^1986 should be larger than 1986^1985.Alternatively, maybe another approach is to write the ratio of the two numbers and see if it&#39;s greater or less than 1.Let me compute (1985^1986)/(1986^1985) = (1985/1986)^1985 *1985.Because 1985^1986 =1985^{1985 +1}=1985^1985 *1985, and 1986^1985 is as is. So the ratio becomes (1985/1986)^1985 *1985.Let me denote x = 1985. Then the ratio is (x/(x+1))^x *x.So, is (x/(x+1))^x *x &gt;1?We can write this as [x/(x+1)]^x *x.We can take the natural logarithm:ln([x/(x+1)]^x *x) = x*ln(x/(x+1)) + ln(x)So, compute x*ln(x/(x+1)) + ln(x) and see if it&#39;s greater than 0.Simplify x*ln(x/(x+1)):x*[ln(x) - ln(x+1)] = x*ln(x) -x*ln(x+1)Therefore, total expression:x*ln(x) -x*ln(x+1) + ln(x) = (x +1)ln(x) -x*ln(x+1)So, need to check if (x +1)ln(x) -x*ln(x+1) &gt;0Which is equivalent to (x +1)ln(x) &gt;x*ln(x+1)Or, [(x +1)/x]^x &gt;x+1 ?Wait, let&#39;s see:Divide both sides by x:[(x +1)/x]^x &gt;x+1Wait, not exactly. Let me see:Wait, (x +1)ln(x) &gt;x*ln(x+1)Divide both sides by x:[(x +1)/x] ln(x) &gt; ln(x +1)Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, exponentiate both sides:exp[(x +1)ln(x) -x*ln(x+1)] = exp[(x +1)ln(x)] / exp[x*ln(x+1)] = x^{x+1}/(x+1)^xWhich is exactly the ratio we&#39;re considering: x^{x+1}/(x+1)^x.So, if x^{x+1}/(x+1)^x &gt;1, then the ratio is greater than 1, meaning x^{x+1} &gt; (x+1)^x.So, we need to check whether x^{x+1}/(x+1)^x &gt;1.Alternatively, write this as (x/(x+1))^x *x &gt;1.So, perhaps we can look for when (x/(x+1))^x *x &gt;1.Let me compute (x/(x+1))^x. This is similar to the expression (1 -1/(x+1))^{x}, which approaches 1/e as x approaches infinity. So (x/(x+1))^x ≈1/e when x is large. Then multiplying by x gives approximately x/e. Since x is large (1985), x/e is definitely greater than 1, so the ratio would be greater than 1. Therefore, for large x, x^{x+1}/(x+1)^x ≈x/e, which is greater than 1, so x^{x+1} &gt; (x+1)^x.Therefore, in our case, since x=1985 is very large, (1985/1986)^{1985} *1985 ≈1985/e, which is way larger than 1, so the ratio is much greater than 1, hence 1985^{1986} is much larger than 1986^{1985}.Therefore, the answer is that 1985^1986 is larger.But wait, let me confirm this approximation. If (x/(x+1))^x approximates to 1/e as x approaches infinity, then multiplying by x gives x/e, which is indeed large. But is this approximation valid for x=1985?Yes, because even for large x, (1 -1/(x+1))^{x} ≈ e^{-1}. For example, lim_{x→∞} (1 -1/(x+1))^{x} = lim_{x→∞} (1 -1/x)^{x -1} = e^{-1}. So indeed, (x/(x+1))^x = [1 -1/(x+1)]^x ≈ e^{-x/(x+1)} ≈ e^{-1} for large x. Therefore, the approximation (x/(x+1))^x ≈1/e holds for large x. Then, multiplying by x gives x/e, which is indeed very large (1985/e ≈ 730), so the ratio is approximately 730, which is way greater than 1. Therefore, the exact ratio is huge, confirming that 1985^{1986} is way larger.Alternatively, maybe using calculus to approximate the difference. Let me consider taking the function f(x) = x^{x+1}/(x+1)^x. Taking the logarithm:ln(f(x)) = (x +1)lnx -x ln(x +1)Compute this for large x.Expand ln(x +1) as lnx + ln(1 +1/x) ≈ lnx + 1/x -1/(2x^2) +...Therefore, ln(f(x)) ≈ (x +1)lnx -x[lnx +1/x -1/(2x^2)]Simplify:(x +1)lnx -x lnx -x*(1/x) +x*(1/(2x^2))= lnx -1 +1/(2x)So, ln(f(x)) ≈ lnx -1 +1/(2x)Therefore, exponentiating:f(x) ≈ e^{lnx -1 +1/(2x)} = x * e^{-1} * e^{1/(2x)} ≈ x/e * (1 +1/(2x)) ≈ x/e +1/(2e)Therefore, for large x, f(x) ≈x/e, which is consistent with the previous approximation.So, with x=1985, f(x)≈1985/e≈730. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 730, so 1985^{1986} is about 730 times larger than 1986^{1985}, hence definitely larger.Therefore, after all these different approaches—comparing logarithms, analyzing the function f(n) = ln(n)/n, considering the ratio and its approximation—it seems consistent that 1985^{1986} is larger than 1986^{1985}.Another way to think about this is using the concept of growth rates. Exponential functions grow at different rates depending on their base and exponent. When the base and exponent are both large, the function with the higher base raised to a slightly lower exponent might still be larger, but in this case, since the exponents are so close (1985 vs 1986) and the difference in bases is just 1, the fact that the function f(n) = ln(n)/n is decreasing means that the smaller base&#39;s ratio of log to its value is higher, leading the smaller base raised to the larger exponent to dominate.Alternatively, using the inequality that for a &lt; b, if a and b are greater than e, then a^b &gt; b^a. Since 1985 &lt; 1986 and both are greater than e, this inequality holds. Therefore, 1985^1986 &gt; 1986^1985.In conclusion, after verifying through multiple methods—logarithmic comparison, derivative analysis of the function f(n), ratio approximation, and considering known inequalities for exponential functions—it&#39;s clear that 1985^1986 is indeed larger than 1986^1985.Final Answerboxed{1985^{1986}}&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether (1985^{1986}) or (1986^{1985}) is larger, we can compare their natural logarithms. Let (A = 1985^{1986}) and (B = 1986^{1985}). We need to compare (ln(A)) and (ln(B)):[ln(A) = 1986 cdot ln(1985)][ln(B) = 1985 cdot ln(1986)]We need to check if (1986 cdot ln(1985) &gt; 1985 cdot ln(1986)). Dividing both sides by (1985 cdot 1986), we get:[frac{ln(1985)}{1985} &gt; frac{ln(1986)}{1986}]This reduces to comparing the values of the function (f(n) = frac{ln(n)}{n}) at (n = 1985) and (n = 1986). The function (f(n)) is decreasing for (n &gt; e) (where (e approx 2.718)). Since both 1985 and 1986 are much larger than (e), (f(n)) is decreasing in this interval. Therefore, (f(1985) &gt; f(1986)), which implies:[frac{ln(1985)}{1985} &gt; frac{ln(1986)}{1986}]Thus, (1986 cdot ln(1985) &gt; 1985 cdot ln(1986)), leading to (ln(A) &gt; ln(B)) and hence (A &gt; B).Additionally, considering the ratio (frac{1985^{1986}}{1986^{1985}}), we can approximate it as:[left(frac{1985}{1986}right)^{1985} cdot 1985]For large (x), (left(frac{x}{x+1}right)^x approx frac{1}{e}). Multiplying by (x) gives approximately (frac{x}{e}), which is very large for (x = 1985). This confirms that the ratio is much greater than 1, hence (1985^{1986}) is significantly larger than (1986^{1985}).Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{1985^{1986}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🔑:</span>Those who wrote approximate values for lg 1985 and lg 1986 instead of taking the logarithm after writing the inequality received 0 points.

I need to find f(1) given that for any x and y, the function f satisfies f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + 80xy. Also, they told me that f(0.25) = 2. Hmm. Alright, so first, this looks like a functional equation. I remember that Cauchy&#39;s functional equation is f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y), which has solutions that are linear functions if we assume some regularity conditions like continuity. But here there&#39;s an extra term, 80xy. So maybe this function f is quadratic? Because the term with xy might suggest that.Let me think. If f is a quadratic function, say f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then let&#39;s plug that into the equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + 80xy.Compute f(x + y) = a(x + y)² + b(x + y) + c = a(x² + 2xy + y²) + b(x + y) + c = ax² + 2axy + ay² + bx + by + c.On the other hand, f(x) + f(y) + 80xy = [ax² + bx + c] + [ay² + by + c] + 80xy = ax² + ay² + bx + by + 2c + 80xy.Set them equal:ax² + 2axy + ay² + bx + by + c = ax² + ay² + bx + by + 2c + 80xy.Subtract ax², ay², bx, by from both sides:2axy + c = 2c + 80xy.So, 2axy - 80xy = 2c - c → (2a - 80)xy = c.Hmm, this equation must hold for all x and y. Therefore, the coefficients of the terms involving xy and the constant term must each be zero. So:For the xy term: 2a - 80 = 0 → 2a = 80 → a = 40.For the constant term: c = 0.So, if f is quadratic, then f(x) = 40x² + bx + 0. So f(x) = 40x² + bx. Okay, now we need to determine the coefficient b.We have another condition: f(0.25) = 2. Let&#39;s use that.f(0.25) = 40*(0.25)² + b*(0.25) = 40*(1/16) + (b/4) = 40/16 + b/4 = 2.5 + b/4.But they said f(0.25) = 2. So:2.5 + b/4 = 2 → b/4 = 2 - 2.5 = -0.5 → b = -0.5 * 4 = -2.Therefore, the function is f(x) = 40x² - 2x.Then, to find f(1), plug x = 1 into this:f(1) = 40*(1)² - 2*1 = 40 - 2 = 38.Wait, but let me check if this works. Let me verify the original functional equation with f(x) = 40x² - 2x.Take f(x + y) = 40(x + y)^2 - 2(x + y) = 40x² + 80xy + 40y² - 2x - 2y.On the other side, f(x) + f(y) + 80xy = [40x² - 2x] + [40y² - 2y] + 80xy = 40x² + 40y² - 2x - 2y + 80xy.Which matches. So yes, the functional equation is satisfied. Then, since f(0.25) = 2, and we found b = -2, so f(x) = 40x² - 2x. Therefore, f(1) = 40 - 2 = 38. So the answer is 38.Alternatively, is there another way to approach this problem without assuming the quadratic form? Maybe by using recursive relations or specific substitutions.Let me try another approach. Let&#39;s set y = 0 in the original equation. Then:f(x + 0) = f(x) + f(0) + 80x*0 → f(x) = f(x) + f(0) + 0 → f(0) = 0.So f(0) = 0. Good, that&#39;s a start.Now, let&#39;s try to compute the derivative, but maybe assuming differentiability. But the problem doesn&#39;t state that f is differentiable. However, if we can assume that f is differentiable (since it&#39;s a numerical function, maybe?), then perhaps we can proceed.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute the difference quotient. Let me fix x and take y = h approaching 0, but maybe that&#39;s overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe use induction to find a formula for f(nx) in terms of f(x).Wait, let&#39;s set y = x. Then f(2x) = f(x) + f(x) + 80x² → f(2x) = 2f(x) + 80x².Similarly, maybe setting x = y = 0.25. Then f(0.5) = f(0.25) + f(0.25) + 80*(0.25)*(0.25) = 2 + 2 + 80*(1/16) = 4 + 5 = 9. Because 80*(1/16) is 5. So f(0.5) = 9.Similarly, set x = y = 0.5. Then f(1) = f(0.5) + f(0.5) + 80*(0.5)*(0.5) = 9 + 9 + 80*(0.25) = 18 + 20 = 38. So there we go, same answer. So f(1) = 38. That matches the previous result.So this method works without assuming the form of f. Let&#39;s see:Starting with f(0.25) = 2.Set x = y = 0.25: f(0.5) = 2 + 2 + 80*(0.25)*(0.25) = 4 + 80*(0.0625) = 4 + 5 = 9.Then set x = y = 0.5: f(1) = 9 + 9 + 80*(0.5)*(0.5) = 18 + 80*(0.25) = 18 + 20 = 38.So that&#39;s another way. So the answer is 38.Alternatively, maybe even more generally, try to find f(x) for arbitrary x. Let&#39;s try to derive the general formula.Assume that f is a quadratic function, as before. Because the functional equation includes an xy term, which is quadratic in variables x and y, so likely f is quadratic. But even without assuming, we can proceed.Let’s consider the functional equation f(x + y) - f(x) - f(y) = 80xy. This resembles a quadratic form. Let’s suppose f(x) is a quadratic function, so f(x) = ax² + bx + c. As we saw earlier, c must be 0 because f(0) = 0, so c = 0. Then, proceeding as before, we find a = 40, b = -2. So this gives the same result.Alternatively, let&#39;s define g(x) = f(x) - 40x². Then let&#39;s see:g(x + y) = f(x + y) - 40(x + y)^2 = [f(x) + f(y) + 80xy] - 40(x² + 2xy + y²) = f(x) + f(y) + 80xy -40x² -80xy -40y² = [f(x) - 40x²] + [f(y) - 40y²] + (80xy -80xy) = g(x) + g(y).Therefore, g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y). So g is additive, Cauchy&#39;s functional equation. If we assume that g is linear, which is usually the case if we have some regularity conditions, then g(x) = kx. Therefore, f(x) = 40x² + kx. Then, using f(0.25) = 2:40*(0.25)^2 + k*(0.25) = 2 → 40*(1/16) + (k/4) = 2.5 + (k/4) = 2 → k/4 = -0.5 → k = -2. So again, same result. Therefore, f(1) = 40*1 + (-2)*1 = 38.Therefore, all approaches lead to 38. So I think that&#39;s the answer.Final AnswerThe value of ( f(1) ) is (boxed{38}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the functional equation ( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + 80xy ) for all ( x ) and ( y ), and the condition ( f(0.25) = 2 ), we need to find ( f(1) ).First, we consider the possibility that ( f ) is a quadratic function. Assuming ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), we substitute into the functional equation:[f(x + y) = a(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) + c = ax^2 + 2axy + ay^2 + bx + by + c]Comparing this with the right-hand side of the functional equation:[f(x) + f(y) + 80xy = ax^2 + bx + c + ay^2 + by + c + 80xy = ax^2 + ay^2 + bx + by + 2c + 80xy]Equating the coefficients of ( xy ) and the constant terms, we get:1. ( 2a = 80 ) implies ( a = 40 )2. ( 2c = c ) implies ( c = 0 )Thus, ( f(x) = 40x^2 + bx ). Using the given condition ( f(0.25) = 2 ):[40(0.25)^2 + b(0.25) = 2 implies 40 left( frac{1}{16} right) + frac{b}{4} = 2 implies 2.5 + frac{b}{4} = 2 implies frac{b}{4} = -0.5 implies b = -2]Therefore, the function is ( f(x) = 40x^2 - 2x ). Evaluating at ( x = 1 ):[f(1) = 40(1)^2 - 2(1) = 40 - 2 = 38]We verified this result by substituting specific values into the functional equation. Setting ( x = y = 0.25 ):[f(0.5) = 2 + 2 + 80(0.25)(0.25) = 9]Then setting ( x = y = 0.5 ):[f(1) = 9 + 9 + 80(0.5)(0.5) = 38]Both methods confirm that ( f(1) = 38 ).[boxed{38}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here. It says that there&#39;s a numerical function f such that for any x and y, the equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + 80xy holds. And I need to find f(1) given that f(0.25) = 2. Hmm, let&#39;s try to figure this out step by step.First off, functional equations can sometimes be tricky, but they often have certain standard approaches. The given equation reminds me of Cauchy&#39;s functional equation, which is f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y). The difference here is the extra term 80xy. So maybe this function is similar to a linear function but with an additional quadratic term? Let me think.In Cauchy&#39;s equation, the solutions are linear functions of the form f(x) = kx, assuming some regularity conditions like continuity. But here, since there&#39;s an extra 80xy term, maybe the function f has a quadratic component. Let me suppose that f(x) is a quadratic function. Let&#39;s say f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then maybe substituting this into the functional equation will help me find the coefficients a, b, c.But wait, the problem doesn&#39;t specify that f is quadratic, but since there&#39;s an xy term in the equation, it&#39;s possible that f is quadratic. Let&#39;s test this hypothesis.Let me let f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then f(x + y) = a(x + y)² + b(x + y) + c = a(x² + 2xy + y²) + b(x + y) + c = ax² + 2axy + ay² + bx + by + c.On the other hand, f(x) + f(y) + 80xy = [ax² + bx + c] + [ay² + by + c] + 80xy = ax² + ay² + bx + by + 2c + 80xy.So equating the two expressions:ax² + 2axy + ay² + bx + by + c = ax² + ay² + bx + by + 2c + 80xy.Subtracting the left side from the right side:Left: ax² + 2axy + ay² + bx + by + cRight: ax² + ay² + bx + by + 2c + 80xySubtracting left from right: (Right) - (Left) = (0x²) + (0y²) + (0x) + (0y) + (2c - c) + (80xy - 2axy) = c + (80 - 2a)xy.For this to hold for all x and y, the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal. So:1. The coefficient of xy: 80 - 2a = 0 ⇒ 2a = 80 ⇒ a = 40.2. The constant term: c = 0.So, with a = 40 and c = 0, the function becomes f(x) = 40x² + bx.Now, we need to determine the coefficient b. For that, we can use the given information that f(0.25) = 2.Let&#39;s substitute x = 0.25 into f(x):f(0.25) = 40*(0.25)^2 + b*(0.25).Calculate 0.25 squared: (0.25)^2 = 0.0625.So, 40*0.0625 = 2.5.Then, b*0.25 = 0.25b.So, 2.5 + 0.25b = 2.Subtract 2.5 from both sides: 0.25b = 2 - 2.5 = -0.5.Therefore, b = (-0.5)/0.25 = -2.So, the function is f(x) = 40x² - 2x.Now, to find f(1), substitute x = 1 into the function:f(1) = 40*(1)^2 - 2*(1) = 40 - 2 = 38.Therefore, the answer should be 38.Wait a second, let me check if this function actually satisfies the original functional equation. Let me verify with arbitrary x and y.Take f(x) = 40x² - 2x.Compute f(x + y) = 40(x + y)^2 - 2(x + y) = 40x² + 80xy + 40y² - 2x - 2y.Compute f(x) + f(y) + 80xy = [40x² - 2x] + [40y² - 2y] + 80xy = 40x² + 40y² - 2x - 2y + 80xy.Comparing both expressions:f(x + y) = 40x² + 80xy + 40y² - 2x - 2yf(x) + f(y) + 80xy = 40x² + 40y² + 80xy - 2x - 2yThese are the same. So yes, the function satisfies the equation. Therefore, the solution seems correct.But just to make sure, let&#39;s test with specific numbers. Let&#39;s take x = 0.25 and y = 0.25.Compute f(0.25 + 0.25) = f(0.5) = 40*(0.5)^2 - 2*(0.5) = 40*0.25 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.Now, f(0.25) + f(0.25) + 80*(0.25)*(0.25) = 2 + 2 + 80*(0.0625) = 4 + 5 = 9. Which matches. So that works.Another test: x = 1, y = 1.f(2) = 40*(4) - 2*(2) = 160 - 4 = 156.f(1) + f(1) + 80*1*1 = 38 + 38 + 80 = 156. Which matches again.Seems solid. Therefore, I think f(1) is indeed 38. So the answer is 38.Final AnswerThe value of ( f(1) ) is boxed{38}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the functional equation ( f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + 80xy ) for all ( x ) and ( y ), we need to find ( f(1) ) given that ( f(0.25) = 2 ).We hypothesize that ( f(x) ) is a quadratic function of the form ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ). Substituting this into the functional equation, we get:[f(x+y) = a(x+y)^2 + b(x+y) + c = ax^2 + 2axy + ay^2 + bx + by + c]On the other hand,[f(x) + f(y) + 80xy = (ax^2 + bx + c) + (ay^2 + by + c) + 80xy = ax^2 + ay^2 + bx + by + 2c + 80xy]Equating the coefficients of corresponding terms, we find:1. The coefficient of ( xy ): ( 2a = 80 ) implies ( a = 40 ).2. The constant term: ( c = 0 ).Thus, the function simplifies to ( f(x) = 40x^2 + bx ). Using the given information ( f(0.25) = 2 ):[2 = 40(0.25)^2 + b(0.25)]Calculating ( 40(0.25)^2 ):[40 times 0.0625 = 2.5]Thus,[2 = 2.5 + 0.25b implies 0.25b = -0.5 implies b = -2]The function is ( f(x) = 40x^2 - 2x ). Substituting ( x = 1 ):[f(1) = 40(1)^2 - 2(1) = 40 - 2 = 38]Thus, the value of ( f(1) ) is (boxed{38}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-84ea8c19></div><p class="review-content" data-v-84ea8c19><span class="icon" data-v-84ea8c19>🔑:</span>f(0,5)=f(0,25+0,25)=f(0,25)+f(0,25)+80 cdot 0,25 cdot 0,25=2+2+5=9.
