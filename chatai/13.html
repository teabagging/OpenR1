Let me try to figure it out step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a &gt; 0 ) and ( b &gt; 0 ). The foci ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ) are the left and right foci, respectively. The origin is denoted by O. There&#39;s a point P on the right branch of the hyperbola such that two conditions are satisfied: first, the vector equation ( (overrightarrow{OP} + overrightarrow{OF_2}) cdot overrightarrow{F_2 P} = 0 ), and second, the distance from P to ( F_1 ) is ( sqrt{3} ) times the distance from P to ( F_2 ). We need to find the eccentricity of the hyperbola from the given options.Let me recall that for a hyperbola, the foci are located at ( (pm c, 0) ) where ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ). The eccentricity ( e ) is ( c/a ), so we need to find ( e = c/a ). The problem gives some vector conditions involving point P, so maybe coordinates can be assigned to all these points and equations can be derived.First, let&#39;s note the coordinates:- ( F_1 ) is at ( (-c, 0) )- ( F_2 ) is at ( (c, 0) )- Point P is on the right branch, so its coordinates can be represented as ( (x, y) ), where ( x geq a ).Given the hyperbola equation, ( x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1 ).Now, let&#39;s parse the vector conditions.First condition: ( (overrightarrow{OP} + overrightarrow{OF_2}) cdot overrightarrow{F_2 P} = 0 )Let me translate these vectors into coordinates.- ( overrightarrow{OP} ) is the vector from the origin to point P, which is ( (x, y) ).- ( overrightarrow{OF_2} ) is the vector from the origin to ( F_2 ), which is ( (c, 0) ).- So, ( overrightarrow{OP} + overrightarrow{OF_2} = (x + c, y + 0) = (x + c, y) ).Next, ( overrightarrow{F_2 P} ) is the vector from ( F_2 ) to P. Since ( F_2 ) is at ( (c, 0) ), then the vector from ( F_2 ) to P is ( (x - c, y - 0) = (x - c, y) ).The dot product of ( (x + c, y) ) and ( (x - c, y) ) is zero. So:( (x + c)(x - c) + y cdot y = 0 )Simplify:( x^2 - c^2 + y^2 = 0 )So, this simplifies to ( x^2 + y^2 = c^2 ). Wait, so the point P lies on the circle centered at the origin with radius c? Interesting. But P is also on the hyperbola. So, the intersection of the hyperbola and the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = c^2 ).So, combining the hyperbola equation and the circle equation:From the hyperbola: ( y^2 = b^2(x^2/a^2 - 1) )Substitute into the circle equation:( x^2 + b^2(x^2/a^2 - 1) = c^2 )Simplify:( x^2 + (b^2/a^2)x^2 - b^2 = c^2 )Combine like terms:( x^2 (1 + b^2/a^2) = c^2 + b^2 )Factor:( x^2 ( (a^2 + b^2)/a^2 ) = c^2 + b^2 )But since ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), substitute that in:( x^2 ( c^2 / a^2 ) = c^2 + b^2 )Therefore,( x^2 = (c^2 + b^2) * (a^2 / c^2 ) )Simplify:( x^2 = ( (a^2 + b^2) + b^2 ) * (a^2 / (a^2 + b^2)) ) )Wait, no, hold on. Wait, actually, c^2 is a^2 + b^2. So substituting:( x^2 = ( (a^2 + b^2) + b^2 ) * (a^2 / (a^2 + b^2)) ) )Wait, no. Wait, c^2 + b^2 is (a^2 + b^2) + b^2 = a^2 + 2b^2Wait, no. Wait, the original equation after substitution was:x^2 (c^2 / a^2 ) = c^2 + b^2But c^2 is a^2 + b^2, so:x^2 = ( (a^2 + b^2) + b^2 ) * (a^2 / (a^2 + b^2)) )Wait, no. Let me re-express:x^2 = (c^2 + b^2) * (a^2 / c^2 )But c^2 = a^2 + b^2, so:x^2 = ( (a^2 + b^2 ) + b^2 ) * (a^2 / (a^2 + b^2)) )Simplify numerator:a^2 + 2b^2So:x^2 = (a^2 + 2b^2) * (a^2 / (a^2 + b^2)) )Hmm. Let&#39;s compute this:x^2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2b^2) / (a^2 + b^2)So, x^2 = [a^4 + 2a^2 b^2 ] / (a^2 + b^2 )Factor numerator:a^2 (a^2 + 2b^2 )But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps write as:x^2 = a^2 [ (a^2 + b^2 ) + b^2 ] / (a^2 + b^2 )So, x^2 = a^2 [ 1 + (b^2 / (a^2 + b^2 )) ]Not sure if helpful. Maybe we can proceed.But this is the x-coordinate of point P. Let&#39;s note that.Now, the second condition is ( | PF_1 | = sqrt{3} | PF_2 | ).Let me write the distance formulas.Point P is (x, y), F1 is (-c, 0), F2 is (c, 0).So,( | PF_1 | = sqrt{ (x + c)^2 + y^2 } )( | PF_2 | = sqrt{ (x - c)^2 + y^2 } )Given that ( | PF_1 | = sqrt{3} | PF_2 | ), so:( sqrt{ (x + c)^2 + y^2 } = sqrt{3} sqrt{ (x - c)^2 + y^2 } )Square both sides:( (x + c)^2 + y^2 = 3 [ (x - c)^2 + y^2 ] )Expand both sides:Left side: ( x^2 + 2xc + c^2 + y^2 )Right side: ( 3x^2 - 6xc + 3c^2 + 3y^2 )Bring all terms to left:( x^2 + 2xc + c^2 + y^2 - 3x^2 + 6xc - 3c^2 - 3y^2 = 0 )Combine like terms:( (1 - 3)x^2 + (2x c + 6x c) + (c^2 - 3c^2) + (1 - 3)y^2 = 0 )Simplify:( -2x^2 + 8xc - 2c^2 - 2y^2 = 0 )Divide both sides by -2:( x^2 - 4xc + c^2 + y^2 = 0 )So, equation becomes:( x^2 + y^2 - 4xc + c^2 = 0 )But from the first condition, we had ( x^2 + y^2 = c^2 ). So substitute that into the above equation:( c^2 - 4xc + c^2 = 0 )Simplify:( 2c^2 - 4xc = 0 )Divide both sides by 2c (assuming c ≠ 0, which it isn&#39;t):( c - 2x = 0 )Therefore,( x = c/2 )So, the x-coordinate of point P is c/2. Interesting. So, point P has x = c/2, and since it&#39;s on the hyperbola, we can find y.But also, from the first condition, x^2 + y^2 = c^2, so substituting x = c/2:( (c/2)^2 + y^2 = c^2 )So,( c^2 / 4 + y^2 = c^2 implies y^2 = c^2 - c^2 / 4 = 3c^2 /4 implies y = pm sqrt{3} c / 2 )But since hyperbola is symmetric, we can take either sign, but since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, maybe it doesn&#39;t matter. So, coordinates of P are (c/2, ± (√3 c)/2 )But also, point P must lie on the hyperbola ( x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1 ). Let&#39;s substitute x and y into the hyperbola equation.So:( ( (c/2)^2 ) / a^2 - ( ( (√3 c)/2 )^2 ) / b^2 = 1 )Simplify:( ( c^2 / 4 ) / a^2 - ( 3c^2 /4 ) / b^2 = 1 )Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators:( ( c^2 / a^2 ) - 3c^2 / b^2 = 4 )Factor out c^2:( c^2 ( 1/a^2 - 3 / b^2 ) = 4 )But since c^2 = a^2 + b^2, substitute that:( (a^2 + b^2)( 1/a^2 - 3 / b^2 ) = 4 )Let me compute this expression:First, write 1/a² - 3/b² as (b² - 3a²) / (a² b² )Therefore,( (a^2 + b^2)(b² - 3a²) / (a² b² ) = 4 )Multiply numerator:(a^2 + b^2)(b² - 3a²) = (a²*b² - 3a^4 + b^4 - 3a² b² ) = (-2a² b² -3a^4 + b^4 )Therefore,(-2a² b² -3a^4 + b^4 ) / (a² b² ) = 4Multiply both sides by a² b²:-2a² b² -3a^4 + b^4 = 4a² b²Bring all terms to left:-2a² b² -3a^4 + b^4 -4a² b² =0Combine like terms:-3a^4 -6a² b² + b^4 =0Multiply both sides by -1:3a^4 +6a² b² -b^4=0Hmm. This is a quartic equation in terms of a and b.We need to relate a and b to find the eccentricity e = c/a = sqrt(a² + b²)/aLet me set k = b/a. Then, b = k a. Let&#39;s substitute.So, replacing b with k a:3a^4 +6a² (k a)^2 - (k a)^4 =0Simplify:3a^4 +6a² k² a² - k^4 a^4 =0Factor a^4:a^4 [3 +6k² -k^4 ] =0Since a ≠0, we have:3 +6k² -k^4 =0Multiply by -1:k^4 -6k² -3=0Let me set z =k², so equation becomes:z² -6z -3=0Solve quadratic:z = [6 ± sqrt(36 +12 )]/2 = [6 ± sqrt(48)]/2 = [6 ± 4 sqrt(3)]/2 = 3 ± 2 sqrt(3)But z =k² must be positive, so both solutions are positive:3 + 2 sqrt(3) and 3 - 2 sqrt(3). Let&#39;s check 3 -2 sqrt(3) ≈ 3 -3.464= -0.464, which is negative. Wait, sqrt(48) is 4 sqrt(3), so sqrt(48)=6.928, so 6 -6.928≈-0.928, divided by 2 is -0.464. So that&#39;s negative. So only z=3 +2 sqrt(3) is valid.Therefore, k²=3 +2 sqrt(3), so k= sqrt(3 +2 sqrt(3))But we need to find the eccentricity e = sqrt(a² +b²)/a= sqrt(1 + (b/a)^2 )=sqrt(1 +k²)Since k²=3 +2 sqrt(3), so e= sqrt(1 +3 +2 sqrt(3))=sqrt(4 +2 sqrt(3))Wait, 4 +2 sqrt(3). Let me see if this can be simplified.Suppose sqrt(4 +2 sqrt(3)). Let me see if this can be written as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Let&#39;s let sqrt(4 +2 sqrt(3)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Then squaring both sides:4 +2 sqrt(3) = a + b + 2 sqrt(ab)Comparing terms:a + b =42 sqrt(ab)=2 sqrt(3) =&gt; sqrt(ab)=sqrt(3) =&gt; ab=3So, we have:a + b =4ab=3This is a system of equations. The solutions are a and b roots of t² -4t +3=0, which factors as (t-1)(t-3)=0, so t=1 and t=3. Therefore, sqrt(4 +2 sqrt(3))=sqrt(3)+sqrt(1)=sqrt(3)+1. Therefore, sqrt(4 +2 sqrt(3))=sqrt(3)+1.Therefore, e= sqrt(4 +2 sqrt(3))=sqrt(3)+1. So the eccentricity is sqrt(3)+1, which is option B.Let me check if this makes sense. So, e= sqrt(3)+1≈1.732+1≈2.732. The options given include (B) sqrt(3)+1, so that&#39;s one of the options. So I think this is correct.But let me verify again to make sure I didn&#39;t make any miscalculations.First, from the vector condition, we found that x=c/2. Then substituting into the hyperbola equation, we arrived at an equation in terms of a and b, which led to k^4 -6k² -3=0, which had solution k²=3 +2 sqrt(3). Then e= sqrt(1 +k²)=sqrt(4 +2 sqrt(3))=sqrt(3)+1. This seems correct.Alternatively, maybe there is a simpler way, but given the steps check out, I think the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the hyperbola (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1) with foci (F_1) and (F_2) at ((-c, 0)) and ((c, 0)) respectively, where (c^2 = a^2 + b^2), we need to find the eccentricity (e) given the conditions: ((overrightarrow{OP} + overrightarrow{OF_2}) cdot overrightarrow{F_2 P} = 0) and (|PF_1| = sqrt{3} |PF_2|).1. Vector Condition:   - (overrightarrow{OP} = (x, y))   - (overrightarrow{OF_2} = (c, 0))   - (overrightarrow{F_2 P} = (x - c, y))   - Dot product condition: ((x + c, y) cdot (x - c, y) = 0)   - Simplifies to: (x^2 - c^2 + y^2 = 0 implies x^2 + y^2 = c^2)2. Distance Condition:   - (|PF_1| = sqrt{3} |PF_2|)   - Using distance formulas: (sqrt{(x + c)^2 + y^2} = sqrt{3} sqrt{(x - c)^2 + y^2})   - Squaring and simplifying: (x^2 + y^2 - 4xc + c^2 = 0)   - Substituting (x^2 + y^2 = c^2): (2c^2 - 4xc = 0 implies x = frac{c}{2})3. Hyperbola Equation:   - Substituting (x = frac{c}{2}) into (x^2 + y^2 = c^2): (y = pm frac{sqrt{3}c}{2})   - Substituting (x) and (y) into the hyperbola equation: (frac{(c/2)^2}{a^2} - frac{( sqrt{3}c/2)^2}{b^2} = 1)   - Simplifying: (frac{c^2}{4a^2} - frac{3c^2}{4b^2} = 1)   - Multiplying by 4: (frac{c^2}{a^2} - frac{3c^2}{b^2} = 4)   - Substituting (c^2 = a^2 + b^2): ((a^2 + b^2) left( frac{1}{a^2} - frac{3}{b^2} right) = 4)   - Simplifying: (3a^4 + 6a^2b^2 - b^4 = 0)   - Let (k = frac{b}{a}): (3 + 6k^2 - k^4 = 0)   - Solving for (k^2): (k^2 = 3 + 2sqrt{3})   - Eccentricity (e = sqrt{1 + k^2} = sqrt{4 + 2sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3} + 1)Thus, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this problem about a hyperbola. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, where a and b are positive. The foci F₁ and F₂ are the left and right foci, respectively. The problem states that there exists a point P on the right branch of the hyperbola such that two conditions are satisfied:1. The vector (OP + OF₂) is perpendicular to the vector F₂P. In other words, their dot product is zero.2. The distance from P to F₁ is √3 times the distance from P to F₂.We need to find the eccentricity of the hyperbola, which is e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to each focus. The answer choices are given, so maybe we can work through the problem using coordinates and these conditions to find e.First, let&#39;s recall some properties of hyperbolas. For a hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, the foci are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². The eccentricity e is c/a, so e = √(1 + b²/a²). So our goal is to find e, which is related to the ratio b²/a².Given that P is on the right branch of the hyperbola, its coordinates can be written as (a secθ, b tanθ) for some angle θ, using parametric equations of the hyperbola. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates (x, y) with x ≥ a. But maybe it&#39;s easier to use coordinates (x, y) and express in terms of x and y.First, let&#39;s note the foci positions. Since F₁ is the left focus, its coordinates are (-c, 0), and F₂ is the right focus at (c, 0). The origin O is at (0, 0).So the vectors involved:- OP is the vector from the origin to point P: (x, y).- OF₂ is the vector from the origin to F₂: (c, 0).- F₂P is the vector from F₂ to P: (x - c, y - 0) = (x - c, y).The first condition is that (OP + OF₂) · F₂P = 0.Let&#39;s compute OP + OF₂. OP is (x, y), OF₂ is (c, 0). So adding them gives (x + c, y + 0) = (x + c, y).Then the dot product with F₂P, which is (x - c, y), is:(x + c)(x - c) + y * y = 0.Calculating that:(x + c)(x - c) = x² - c²y * y = y²So the equation becomes x² - c² + y² = 0.Therefore, x² + y² = c².But wait, this is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius c. So the point P lies on this circle as well as on the hyperbola. So P is an intersection point of the hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1 and the circle x² + y² = c².But since P is on the right branch of the hyperbola, x ≥ a. So we need to solve these two equations simultaneously.Let me write down the two equations:1. x²/a² - y²/b² = 12. x² + y² = c²We can solve these equations for x and y.From equation 2, y² = c² - x². Substitute into equation 1:x²/a² - (c² - x²)/b² = 1Multiply through by a²b² to eliminate denominators:b²x² - a²(c² - x²) = a²b²Expand:b²x² - a²c² + a²x² = a²b²Combine like terms:x²(b² + a²) = a²b² + a²c²Factor the right-hand side:x²(a² + b²) = a²(b² + c²)Therefore,x² = [a²(b² + c²)] / (a² + b²)But since c² = a² + b² for hyperbola, substitute that in:x² = [a²(b² + a² + b²)] / (a² + b²)x² = [a²(2b² + a²)] / (a² + b²)So x = sqrt[ a²(2b² + a²) / (a² + b²) ) ]But since P is on the right branch, x is positive, so we can write x as [ a sqrt(2b² + a²) ] / sqrt(a² + b²)Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let&#39;s note that c² = a² + b², so we can write this as:x² = [a²(b² + c²)] / (a² + b²) = [a²(b² + a² + b²)] / (a² + b²) = [a²(a² + 2b²)] / (a² + b²)So x = a * sqrt( (a² + 2b²)/(a² + b²) )But perhaps there&#39;s a better way to handle this. Alternatively, maybe we can proceed with the second condition.The second condition is |PF₁| = √3 |PF₂|.Let&#39;s write expressions for |PF₁| and |PF₂|.F₁ is at (-c, 0), F₂ is at (c, 0), P is at (x, y).So |PF₁| = sqrt( (x + c)^2 + y^2 )|PF₂| = sqrt( (x - c)^2 + y^2 )Given that |PF₁| = √3 |PF₂|, so:sqrt( (x + c)^2 + y^2 ) = √3 sqrt( (x - c)^2 + y^2 )Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:(x + c)^2 + y^2 = 3[ (x - c)^2 + y^2 ]Expand both sides:Left side: x² + 2xc + c² + y²Right side: 3x² - 6xc + 3c² + 3y²Bring all terms to left side:x² + 2xc + c² + y² - 3x² + 6xc - 3c² - 3y² = 0Combine like terms:(-2x² + 8xc - 2c² - 2y²) = 0Divide both sides by -2:x² - 4xc + c² + y² = 0So the equation becomes x² + y² - 4xc + c² = 0.But from the first condition, we have x² + y² = c². Substitute that into the above equation:c² - 4xc + c² = 0 ⇒ 2c² - 4xc = 0 ⇒ 4xc = 2c² ⇒ 2x = c ⇒ x = c/2.So from the second condition, we get that x = c/2.But from the first condition, we had that x² + y² = c². So substituting x = c/2 into this, we get:(c/2)^2 + y² = c² ⇒ c²/4 + y² = c² ⇒ y² = c² - c²/4 = 3c²/4 ⇒ y = ± (√3 c)/2.Therefore, the coordinates of P are (c/2, ± (√3 c)/2 ). But since the hyperbola is symmetric, we can take either sign; let&#39;s take positive y for simplicity: P = (c/2, (√3 c)/2).But we also know that P lies on the hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1. Let&#39;s substitute x and y into the hyperbola equation:(c/2)^2 / a² - ( (√3 c / 2 )^2 ) / b² =1Calculating each term:(c²/4)/a² - (3c²/4)/b² =1Multiply both sides by 4:c²/a² - 3c²/b² =4Factor out c²:c² ( 1/a² - 3/b² ) =4But we know that c² = a² + b². Let&#39;s substitute that in:(a² + b²)(1/a² - 3/b²) =4Let me compute this expression:First, distribute (a² + b²) over the terms in the parenthesis:(a²)(1/a²) + a²(-3/b²) + b²(1/a²) + b²(-3/b²)Simplify each term:1 - 3a²/b² + b²/a² - 3Combine like terms:(1 - 3) + (-3a²/b² + b²/a² ) = -2 + ( -3a²/b² + b²/a² )Therefore:-2 - 3a²/b² + b²/a² =4Bring all terms to one side:-3a²/b² + b²/a² -2 -4=0 ⇒ -3a²/b² + b²/a² -6=0Multiply through by a²b² to eliminate denominators:-3a^4 + b^4 -6a²b²=0So:b^4 -3a^4 -6a²b²=0Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can express in terms of e, since e = c/a, and c² = a² + b². Let&#39;s denote e as the eccentricity, so c = a e, and c² = a² e² = a² + b² ⇒ b² = a²(e² -1 )So substituting b² = a²(e² -1 ) into the equation:b^4 -3a^4 -6a²b²=0First, compute b^4:b^4 = [a²(e² -1 )]^2 = a^4 (e² -1 )²Similarly, 6a²b² =6a² * a²(e² -1 ) =6a^4(e² -1 )So substitute into the equation:a^4 (e² -1 )² -3a^4 -6a^4(e² -1 )=0Factor out a^4:a^4 [ (e² -1 )² -3 -6(e² -1 ) ] =0Since a&gt;0, a^4 ≠0, so the expression in the brackets must be zero:(e² -1 )² -3 -6(e² -1 )=0Let me expand (e² -1 )²:= e^4 -2e² +1 -3 -6e² +6Simplify:e^4 -2e² +1 -3 -6e² +6 = e^4 -8e² +4 =0So we have quartic equation e^4 -8e² +4=0Let me let u = e², so the equation becomes:u² -8u +4=0Solving quadratic equation:u = [8 ± sqrt(64 -16)]/2 = [8 ± sqrt(48)]/2 = [8 ±4*sqrt(3)]/2 =4 ±2sqrt(3)Therefore, e²=4+2√3 or e²=4-2√3But since e&gt;1 (hyperbola), e² must be greater than 1. Let&#39;s check:4+2√3 ≈4+3.464≈7.464, which is greater than 1.4-2√3≈4-3.464≈0.536, which is less than 1, so discard this solution.Therefore, e²=4+2√3, so e=√(4+2√3)Simplify √(4+2√3). Let&#39;s see if this can be expressed as √a + √b. Suppose √(4+2√3)=√a +√b. Then:(√a +√b)^2 =a +2√(ab) +b=4+2√3Thus, a +b=4 and 2√(ab)=2√3 ⇒ √(ab)=√3 ⇒ ab=3.So solving the system:a + b =4ab=3This is a quadratic equation: x² -4x +3=0, roots x=1 and x=3. Therefore, a=1, b=3 or a=3, b=1.Thus, √(4+2√3)=√3 +√1=√3 +1. So e=√3 +1. Therefore, the eccentricity is √3 +1, which is option B.Wait, let me verify this. Let me compute (√3 +1)^2 =3 +2√3 +1=4+2√3. Yes, exactly. Therefore, √(4+2√3)=√3 +1. So e=√3 +1. So the answer is B.But let me check again if I did everything correctly. Let&#39;s recap:We had point P on hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b²=1, with two conditions.From first condition, we found x =c/2, y=±(√3 c)/2.Substituted into hyperbola equation, leading to the equation e^4 -8e² +4=0, which gave e²=4+2√3, so e=√3 +1. That matches one of the options, B.Therefore, the answer should be B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the hyperbola (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1) with foci (F_1) and (F_2) at ((-c, 0)) and ((c, 0)) respectively, where (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}), we need to find the eccentricity (e = frac{c}{a}) given the conditions:1.

(|overrightarrow{PF_1}| = sqrt{3} |overrightarrow{PF_2}|)First, the condition ((overrightarrow{OP} + overrightarrow{OF_2}) cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} = 0) translates to:[(x + c)(x - c) + y^2 = 0 implies x^2 + y^2 = c^2]This means point (P) lies on the circle (x^2 + y^2 = c^2).Next, the condition (|overrightarrow{PF_1}| = sqrt{3} |overrightarrow{PF_2}|) leads to:[sqrt{(x + c)^2 + y^2} = sqrt{3} sqrt{(x - c)^2 + y^2}]Squaring both sides and simplifying, we find:[x = frac{c}{2}]Substituting (x = frac{c}{2}) into the circle equation (x^2 + y^2 = c^2), we get:[left(frac{c}{2}right)^2 + y^2 = c^2 implies y = pm frac{sqrt{3}c}{2}]Thus, point (P) is (left(frac{c}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}c}{2}right)).Substituting (P) into the hyperbola equation (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1):[frac{left(frac{c}{2}right)^2}{a^2} - frac{left(frac{sqrt{3}c}{2}right)^2}{b^2} = 1]Simplifying, we get:[frac{c^2}{4a^2} - frac{3c^2}{4b^2} = 1 implies frac{c^2}{a^2} - frac{3c^2}{b^2} = 4]Using (c^2 = a^2 + b^2), substitute (b^2 = a^2(e^2 - 1)) where (e = frac{c}{a}):[(a^2(e^2 - 1) + a^2) left(frac{1}{a^2} - frac{3}{a^2(e^2 - 1)}right) = 4]Simplifying further, we solve the quartic equation:[e^4 - 8e^2 + 4 = 0]Solving for (e), we find (e = sqrt{3} + 1).Thus, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2fff42df></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2fff42df><span class="icon" data-v-2fff42df>🔑:</span>10.

First, I need to understand what sets A and B are, find their intersection C, and then figure out how to maximize the product of distances from a point X in A to multiple points Y₁, Y₂, ..., Yₙ in C. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let&#39;s break it down.Starting with set A: the equation is x² + y² = 2x + 2y + 23. I remember that equations of circles can be written in the form (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r². So maybe I should rewrite set A&#39;s equation to see if it&#39;s a circle. Let&#39;s complete the squares for both x and y.For the x terms: x² - 2x. Completing the square: take half of -2, which is -1, square it to get 1. So x² - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)².For the y terms: y² - 2y. Similarly, half of -2 is -1, square to 1. So y² - 2y + 1 = (y - 1)².But wait, if I add these squares, I need to balance the equation. The original equation is x² + y² = 2x + 2y + 23. Moving the right-hand side to the left: x² - 2x + y² - 2y - 23 = 0. Then, completing the squares:(x - 1)² - 1 + (y - 1)² - 1 - 23 = 0Which simplifies to (x - 1)² + (y - 1)² - 25 = 0, so (x - 1)² + (y - 1)² = 25. So set A is a circle with center at (1, 1) and radius 5. Got that.Set B is given by |x - 1| + |y - 1| = 5. That&#39;s the equation of a diamond (a square rotated 45 degrees) centered at (1, 1) with vertices at a distance of 5 along the axes. The general shape of |x - h| + |y - k| = r is a diamond with vertices at (h + r, k), (h - r, k), (h, k + r), (h, k - r). So here, the vertices would be at (1 + 5, 1) = (6,1), (1 -5,1)=(-4,1), (1,1 +5)=(1,6), and (1,1 -5)=(1,-4). So set B is a diamond centered at (1,1) with side length 5√2. Wait, no, actually, the distance from the center to each vertex is 5 along the axes. The side length would be calculated differently. But maybe I don&#39;t need to get into that right now.Set C is the intersection of sets A and B. So C consists of the points that lie on both the circle A and the diamond B. Therefore, we need to find the points where the circle and the diamond intersect. The maximum product of distances from a point X in A to points Y₁, Y₂, ..., Yₙ in C... Hmm.The problem asks for the maximum value of the product XY₁·XY₂·…·XYₙ, where X is any point in A and each Y_i is in C. Since the product is over n segments, and n is arbitrary, but the points Y₁,…,Yₙ are all elements of C. Wait, but how is n determined? The problem says &quot;the product of the lengths of n segments XY₁⋅XY₂⋅…⋅XYₙ&quot;, where X is in A, Y_i are in C. The maximum value this product can take. So it&#39;s for any n, but n is the number of points Y_i we choose from C. Wait, but n isn&#39;t given. Maybe n is variable? But the problem says &quot;the product of the lengths of n segments&quot;, so perhaps n is the number of points in C? But C could have multiple points. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the maximum possible product, considering all possible n and all possible choices of Y₁,…,Yₙ in C. But it&#39;s not clear. Wait, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and the translation might be slightly off. Wait, no, it&#39;s in English. Let me check again.Wait, the problem says: &quot;What is the maximum value that the product of the lengths of n segments XY₁⋅XY₂⋅XY₃⋅…⋅XYₙ can take, where point X is an arbitrarily chosen point from set A, and points Y₁, Y₂, Y₃, …, Yₙ are all elements of set C?&quot; So the product is over n segments, where n is the number of points in C? But C is the intersection of a circle and a diamond, which could have up to 8 points, maybe? Because a circle can intersect a diamond (which is a convex polygon) at up to 8 points (two points per side). So maybe n is 8? But the problem doesn&#39;t specify n. Wait, maybe n is variable, but they want the maximum over all possible n? Or perhaps n is fixed, but not given? Wait, the problem says &quot;the product of the lengths of n segments&quot;, so it&#39;s asking for the maximum product for any n. But the answer would then depend on n? But the problem is in Chinese, translated as problem 10, so maybe the original problem had a specific n? Wait, but the user has provided the problem statement in English. Let me check again.Wait, the problem says: &quot;the product of the lengths of n segments XY₁⋅XY₂⋅XY₃⋅…⋅XYₙ can take, where point X is an arbitrarily chosen point from set A, and points Y₁, Y₂, Y₃, …, Yₙ are all elements of set C&quot;. So the product is of n segments, each from X to a point Y_i in C. The question is asking for the maximum value of this product. So for each X in A, take all possible products over n points in C (for any n? Or is n the number of points in C? If C has m points, then n can be up to m, and we can choose subsets of size n. But maybe the problem is looking for the maximum over all possible n, but n is not given. Hmmm. Wait, maybe the problem is in the original Chinese, and the translation might have an ambiguity. Maybe the problem is asking for the maximum product when considering all possible numbers of points, but given that the answer is to be boxed, perhaps there&#39;s a specific maximum value regardless of n? Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider all possible products, regardless of n, so for each X, take the product over all points Y in C, and find the maximum of that. If that&#39;s the case, then n is the number of points in C, which is fixed once C is determined. So perhaps first, we need to find how many points are in set C, and then compute the product over all those points for some X, and find the maximum such product.Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows choosing multiple Y_i&#39;s, possibly repeating, but the problem says &quot;points Y₁, Y₂, …, Yₙ are all elements of set C&quot;. So they have to be elements of C, but can we pick the same point multiple times? If repetition is allowed, then the maximum product could be unbounded as n increases, since you can keep multiplying by the same large distance. But that doesn&#39;t make sense. So probably repetition is not allowed, and n is the number of points in C. Therefore, the problem reduces to: Given that C is the intersection of A and B (so a finite set of points), for each X in A, compute the product of distances from X to each point in C, and find the maximum value of this product.Therefore, first, we need to find the set C, which is the intersection of the circle A and the diamond B. Then, for each point X in A, compute the product of distances from X to each point in C, and find the maximum of this product over all X in A.So step 1: Find the coordinates of the intersection points C between circle A and diamond B.Set A: (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 25Set B: |x - 1| + |y - 1| = 5To find the intersection points, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me denote u = x - 1 and v = y - 1. Then the equations become:u² + v² = 25 ...(1)|u| + |v| = 5 ...(2)So we need to solve these equations for u and v, then convert back to x and y.Equation (2) represents a diamond in the uv-plane with vertices at (5,0), (-5,0), (0,5), (0,-5). Equation (1) is a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin. So the intersection points would be where the diamond and the circle meet.But since the diamond is inscribed in the circle, the vertices of the diamond lie on the circle. Let&#39;s check: For example, the vertex (5,0) satisfies u² + v² = 25 + 0 = 25, which is exactly the circle. Similarly, (0,5) also lies on the circle. So the diamond is inscribed in the circle. Therefore, the circle and the diamond intersect at the four vertices of the diamond. Wait, but maybe there are more intersection points? Let me check.Wait, if the diamond is inscribed in the circle, then all points of the diamond lie inside or on the circle. Wait, but the diamond&#39;s edges are straight lines connecting the vertices. Let&#39;s take a point on an edge of the diamond, say between (5,0) and (0,5). A general point on this edge is (5 - t, t) for t from 0 to 5. Then u = 5 - t, v = t. Then u² + v² = (5 - t)² + t² = 25 - 10t + 2t². Let&#39;s compare this to 25. So 25 -10t + 2t² &lt;= 25? That would be when -10t + 2t² &lt;=0, which is 2t² -10t &lt;=0 =&gt; t(2t -10) &lt;=0. So t between 0 and 5. At t=0, 25. At t=5, 25. For t between 0 and 5, the value is less than 25. For example, at t=2.5, 2.5²*2 + ... Wait, perhaps my calculation is off. Wait, (5 - t)^2 + t^2 = 25 -10t + t² + t² = 25 -10t + 2t². So for t between 0 and 5, this expression is equal to 25 -10t + 2t². Let&#39;s check if this is equal to 25. Set 25 -10t + 2t² =25 =&gt; -10t +2t²=0 =&gt; t(-10 +2t)=0 =&gt; t=0 or t=5. So along the edge from (5,0) to (0,5), the only points that lie on the circle are the endpoints. Similarly for the other edges. Therefore, the circle and the diamond intersect only at the four vertices: (5,0), (-5,0), (0,5), (0,-5) in the uv-plane. Translating back to xy-plane, since u = x -1, v = y -1, the intersection points are:(5 +1, 0 +1) = (6,1)(-5 +1, 0 +1) = (-4,1)(0 +1,5 +1) = (1,6)(0 +1, -5 +1) = (1,-4)Wait, hold on. If in the uv-plane, the intersection points are (5,0), (-5,0), (0,5), (0,-5). Then u = x -1, v = y -1, so x = u +1, y = v +1. Therefore:For (5,0): x = 5 +1 =6, y=0 +1=1 ⇒ (6,1)For (-5,0): x = -5 +1=-4, y=0 +1=1 ⇒ (-4,1)For (0,5): x=0 +1=1, y=5 +1=6 ⇒ (1,6)For (0,-5): x=0 +1=1, y=-5 +1=-4 ⇒ (1,-4)Therefore, set C has four points: (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), (1,-4). So n=4 here. Therefore, the product would be the product of distances from a point X in A to these four points. The problem is to find the maximum value of this product as X varies over all points in A.So the problem reduces to: Given four points (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), (1,-4), find the maximum value of the product of distances from a variable point X on the circle (x -1)^2 + (y -1)^2 =25 to these four points.Therefore, the answer is the maximum of [distance(X, (6,1)) * distance(X, (-4,1)) * distance(X, (1,6)) * distance(X, (1,-4))] as X moves along the circle centered at (1,1) with radius 5.So how can we compute this? It seems complicated, but maybe we can use complex numbers or geometric properties.Alternatively, note that the four points are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle (1,1). Let&#39;s see:- (6,1) is 5 units to the right of the center.- (-4,1) is 5 units to the left.- (1,6) is 5 units above.- (1,-4) is 5 units below.So these four points are located at the cardinal directions (east, west, north, south) from the center, each 5 units away. Wait, but the circle A is also centered at (1,1) with radius 5. Therefore, these four points lie exactly on the circle A. Wait, but set C is the intersection of A and B. So since these four points are on both A and B, that&#39;s correct.But wait, the problem states that set A is defined by x² + y² =2x +2y +23, which we converted to (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2=25. So indeed, radius 5. The four points (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), (1,-4) are all on this circle because each is 5 units away from (1,1). For example, distance from (1,1) to (6,1) is 5, which is the radius. Similarly for the others. Therefore, set C is these four points.Therefore, the problem is to find the maximum of the product of distances from a point X on the circle to each of these four points. So if X is on the circle, moving around, how does the product of these four distances change?This seems like a problem that might use complex numbers or inversion, but I need to think of a way to compute it.First, let&#39;s note that the four points are at the ends of the &quot;cross&quot; centered at (1,1). So they are like the four cardinal directions. If we parametrize point X on the circle as (1 + 5cosθ, 1 +5sinθ), then we can express the distances from X to each of the four points and compute the product.Let&#39;s try that.Let’s parametrize X as (1 + 5cosθ, 1 +5sinθ). Then compute the distances to each of the four points:1. Distance to (6,1):d₁ = sqrt[(1 +5cosθ -6)^2 + (1 +5sinθ -1)^2]= sqrt[(-5 +5cosθ)^2 + (5sinθ)^2]= sqrt[25(1 - cosθ)^2 +25sin²θ]= 5 sqrt[(1 - cosθ)^2 + sin²θ]Simplify inside the sqrt:(1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ) + sin²θ = 1 - 2cosθ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 1 -2cosθ +1 = 2(1 - cosθ)Therefore, d₁ =5 sqrt[2(1 - cosθ)] =5 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - cosθ) =5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2 sin²(θ/2)) [using the identity 1 - cosθ=2 sin²(θ/2)]=5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)*|sin(θ/2)|=5*2*|sin(θ/2)|=10|sin(θ/2)|Similarly, distance to (-4,1):d₂ = sqrt[(1 +5cosθ +4)^2 + (1 +5sinθ -1)^2]= sqrt[(5 +5cosθ)^2 + (5sinθ)^2]= sqrt[25(1 + cosθ)^2 +25sin²θ]=5 sqrt[(1 + cosθ)^2 + sin²θ]Expand inside:1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ + sin²θ =1 +2cosθ +1=2(1 +cosθ)Thus, d₂=5*sqrt[2(1 + cosθ)]=5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1 + cosθ)=5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2 cos²(θ/2))=5*2|cos(θ/2)|=10|cos(θ/2)|Similarly, distance to (1,6):d₃ = sqrt[(1 +5cosθ -1)^2 + (1 +5sinθ -6)^2]= sqrt[(5cosθ)^2 + (-5 +5sinθ)^2]= sqrt[25cos²θ +25(sinθ -1)^2]=5 sqrt[cos²θ + (sinθ -1)^2]Expand inside:cos²θ + sin²θ - 2sinθ +1 =1 -2sinθ +1=2(1 - sinθ)Therefore, d₃=5 sqrt[2(1 - sinθ)] =5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1 - sinθ)=5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2 sin²(π/4 - θ/2)) [using identity 1 - sinθ=2 sin²(π/4 - θ/2)]=5*2|sin(π/4 - θ/2)|=10|sin(π/4 - θ/2)|Similarly, distance to (1,-4):d₄ = sqrt[(1 +5cosθ -1)^2 + (1 +5sinθ +4)^2]= sqrt[(5cosθ)^2 + (5 +5sinθ)^2]= sqrt[25cos²θ +25(1 + sinθ)^2]=5 sqrt[cos²θ + (1 + sinθ)^2]Expand inside:cos²θ +1 +2 sinθ + sin²θ =1 +1 +2 sinθ=2(1 + sinθ)Therefore, d₄=5 sqrt[2(1 + sinθ)]=5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1 + sinθ)=5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2 cos²(π/4 - θ/2))=5*2|cos(π/4 - θ/2)|=10|cos(π/4 - θ/2)|Therefore, the product of the four distances is:d₁*d₂*d₃*d₄ = [10|sin(θ/2)|] * [10|cos(θ/2)|] * [10|sin(π/4 - θ/2)|] * [10|cos(π/4 - θ/2)|]= 10^4 * |sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)sin(π/4 - θ/2)cos(π/4 - θ/2)|Note that 10^4 is 10000, so the product is 10000 times the absolute value of sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)sin(π/4 - θ/2)cos(π/4 - θ/2)Let me simplify the trigonometric expression.First, note that sin(a)cos(a) = (1/2)sin(2a). Similarly for the other term.So:sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) = (1/2) sinθSimilarly, sin(π/4 - θ/2)cos(π/4 - θ/2) = (1/2) sin(π/2 - θ) = (1/2) cosθTherefore, the product becomes:10000 * |(1/2 sinθ)(1/2 cosθ)| =10000 * |(1/4 sinθ cosθ)| =10000*(1/4)|sinθ cosθ|= 2500 |sinθ cosθ|But sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ, so:2500*(1/2)|sin2θ|=1250 |sin2θ|Therefore, the product of the four distances is 1250 |sin2θ|So to maximize this product, we need to maximize |sin2θ|. The maximum value of |sin2θ| is 1, so the maximum product is 1250 *1=1250.Wait, so the maximum product is 1250. But let me verify this step-by-step.Wait, starting from:sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) = (1/2) sinθSimilarly, sin(π/4 - θ/2)cos(π/4 - θ/2) = (1/2) sin(π/2 - θ) = (1/2) cosθHence, their product is (1/2 sinθ)(1/2 cosθ) = (1/4) sinθ cosθTherefore, the entire product is 10000*(1/4)|sinθ cosθ| = 2500 |sinθ cosθ|Then, sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ, so:2500*(1/2)|sin2θ| =1250 |sin2θ|Yes, so the maximum of |sin2θ| is 1, so maximum product is 1250*1=1250.But wait, let me check with θ= π/4. Then sin2θ= sin(π/2)=1. So when θ=π/4, the product is 1250. Let me check if this is correct.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the trigonometric identities. Let me check:Given θ, then:sin(π/4 - θ/2)cos(π/4 - θ/2)Let me set φ=π/4 -θ/2. Then sinφ cosφ=(1/2) sin2φ=(1/2) sin(π/2 -θ)= (1/2) cosθ. Yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the product expression is correct.Therefore, the maximum product is 1250.But let me check with a specific example. Let&#39;s take X at (1 +5*cosθ,1 +5*sinθ). When θ=π/4, X is (1 +5*(√2/2),1 +5*(√2/2))=(1 + (5√2)/2,1 + (5√2)/2). Let&#39;s compute distances to each of the four points:Distance to (6,1):sqrt[(6 - (1 +5√2/2))² + (1 - (1 +5√2/2))²]= sqrt[(5 -5√2/2)² + (-5√2/2)^2]= sqrt[(5(1 - √2/2))² + (5√2/2)^2]=5 sqrt[(1 - √2/2)^2 + ( (√2)/2 )² ]Compute inside:(1 - √2/2)^2 + ( (√2)/2 )² =1 - √2 + (2/4) + (2/4)=1 -√2 +1/2 +1/2=1 -√2 +1=2 -√2Wait, so sqrt(2 -√2). Therefore, distance is 5*sqrt(2 -√2)Similarly, distance to (-4,1):sqrt[(-4 - (1 +5√2/2))² + (1 - (1 +5√2/2))²]= sqrt[(-5 -5√2/2)² + (-5√2/2)^2]=5 sqrt[(1 + √2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2 ]Compute inside:(1 + √2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2 =1 + √2 + (2/4) + (2/4)=1 +√2 +1/2 +1/2=1 +√2 +1=2 +√2Thus, distance is 5*sqrt(2 +√2)Similarly, distance to (1,6):sqrt[(1 - (1 +5√2/2))² + (6 - (1 +5√2/2))²]= sqrt[(-5√2/2)^2 + (5 -5√2/2)^2]=5 sqrt[(√2/2)^2 + (1 -√2/2)^2 ]Which is the same as the first distance, 5*sqrt(2 -√2)Similarly, distance to (1,-4):sqrt[(1 - (1 +5√2/2))² + (-4 - (1 +5√2/2))²]= sqrt[(-5√2/2)^2 + (-5 -5√2/2)^2]=5 sqrt[(√2/2)^2 + (1 +√2/2)^2 ]Which is the same as the second distance, 5*sqrt(2 +√2)Therefore, product of distances:[5*sqrt(2 -√2)]² * [5*sqrt(2 +√2)]² =25*(2 -√2)*25*(2 +√2)=625*(4 - (√2)^2)=625*(4 -2)=625*2=1250. Which matches the earlier result. So indeed, when θ=π/4, the product is 1250. And since |sin2θ| reaches 1 at θ=π/4 and θ=3π/4, etc., the maximum product is 1250.Therefore, the maximum value of the product is 1250.Final Answerboxed{1250}&lt;/think&gt;Set ( A ) is defined by the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 2y + 23 ). Rewriting this equation by completing the square, we get:[(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 25]This represents a circle centered at ((1, 1)) with radius 5.Set ( B ) is defined by the equation ( |x - 1| + |y - 1| = 5 ). This represents a diamond (a square rotated 45 degrees) centered at ((1, 1)) with vertices at ((6, 1)), ((-4, 1)), ((1, 6)), and ((1, -4)).The intersection ( C ) of sets ( A ) and ( B ) consists of the four vertices of the diamond, which are also points on the circle. These points are ((6, 1)), ((-4, 1)), ((1, 6)), and ((1, -4)).To find the maximum value of the product of the distances from a point ( X ) on circle ( A ) to each of the four points in ( C ), we parametrize ( X ) as ((1 + 5costheta, 1 + 5sintheta)). The distances from ( X ) to each of the four points are calculated and simplified using trigonometric identities.The product of these distances is found to be:[10000 left| sinleft(frac{theta}{2}right) cosleft(frac{theta}{2}right) sinleft(frac{pi}{4} - frac{theta}{2}right) cosleft(frac{pi}{4} - frac{theta}{2}right) right|]Simplifying further, this product reduces to ( 1250 |sin 2theta| ). The maximum value of ( |sin 2theta| ) is 1, leading to the maximum product value of ( 1250 ).Thus, the maximum value of the product of the lengths of the segments is:[boxed{1250}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about finding the maximum value of the product of the lengths of n segments from a point X in set A to points Y₁, Y₂, ..., Yₙ in set C, where C is the intersection of sets A and B. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let&#39;s break it down step by step.First, I need to understand what sets A, B, and C are. Set A is defined by the equation x² + y² = 2x + 2y + 23. That looks like a circle equation, but let me rearrange it to standard form. Moving the terms on the right to the left:x² - 2x + y² - 2y = 23.To complete the squares for x and y:For x: x² - 2x = (x - 1)² - 1.For y: y² - 2y = (y - 1)² - 1.So substituting back:(x - 1)² - 1 + (y - 1)² - 1 = 23 ⇒ (x - 1)² + (y - 1)² = 25.Ah, so set A is a circle with center at (1, 1) and radius 5. Got that.Set B is defined by |x - 1| + |y - 1| = 5. That&#39;s the equation of a diamond (a square rotated 45 degrees) centered at (1, 1) with vertices at a distance of 5 along the axes. The vertices would be at (1 + 5, 1) = (6,1), (1 -5,1)= (-4,1), (1,1 +5)= (1,6), and (1,1 -5)= (1,-4). So set B is a diamond centered at the same center as set A, which is interesting.Set C is the intersection of sets A and B. So points that lie on both the circle and the diamond. That intersection would likely be a finite number of points since the circle and diamond are both centered at (1,1). Let&#39;s check.First, the circle has radius 5, and the diamond (which is a square with sides of length 5√2) has its vertices at distance 5 from the center along the axes. The circle also has radius 5. So the circle passes through the vertices of the diamond. Therefore, the intersection points C are exactly the four vertices of the diamond: (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), and (1,-4). Wait, is that right?Wait, let me verify. If you plug (6,1) into the circle equation: (6 -1)^2 + (1 -1)^2 = 25 + 0 = 25, which matches the radius squared. Similarly, (-4,1): (-4 -1)^2 + (1 -1)^2 = 25 + 0 =25. Same with (1,6): (1-1)^2 + (6 -1)^2=0 +25=25. And (1,-4): same thing. So yes, the four vertices of the diamond lie on the circle. But are there more intersection points?Wait, the diamond is |x -1| + |y -1| =5. The circle is (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2=25. Let me check if there are other points. For example, take a point on the diamond not at the vertices. Let&#39;s say x -1 = 0, then |y -1|=5, so y=6 or y=-4. Wait, those are the vertices again. Similarly, y -1 =0 gives x=6 or x=-4. So actually, all points on the diamond are either along the edges between these vertices. But does the circle intersect the diamond edges anywhere else?Let&#39;s parametrize one edge of the diamond. Let&#39;s take the edge from (6,1) to (1,6). On this edge, the equation is (x -1) + (y -1) =5, since both x -1 and y -1 are positive. So x + y -2 =5 ⇒ x + y =7. So points on this edge satisfy x + y =7 and x ≥1, y ≥1. Now, substitute into the circle equation: (x -1)^2 + (y -1)^2 =25. Since x + y =7, then y =7 - x. Substitute:(x -1)^2 + (7 - x -1)^2 =25 ⇒ (x -1)^2 + (6 -x)^2 =25.Compute (x -1)^2 + (6 -x)^2 = (x² -2x +1) + (x² -12x +36) =2x² -14x +37=25.So 2x² -14x +12=0 ⇒ x² -7x +6=0 ⇒ (x -6)(x -1)=0. Thus x=6 or x=1. Then y=1 or y=6. So only the vertices. So indeed, the only intersection points are the four vertices. Therefore, set C is those four points: (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), (1,-4).So points Y₁, Y₂, etc., must be among these four points.Now, the problem is asking for the maximum value of the product X Y₁ ⋅ X Y₂ ⋅ … ⋅ X Yₙ, where X is any point in set A (the circle), and each Yᵢ is one of the four points in C. So we need to maximize the product of distances from X to each of these four points, multiplied n times? Wait, but n is arbitrary? Wait, the problem says &quot;the product of the lengths of n segments XY₁ ⋅ XY₂ ⋅ XY₃ ⋅ … ⋅ XYₙ&quot;, where each Y_i is in C. So the product is the product of n distances from X to points in C, possibly repeating points (since it just says all elements of C, but I think it&#39;s allowing multiple Y_i to be the same point). Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;points Y₁, Y₂, ..., Yₙ are all elements of set C&quot;. So each Y_i is an element of C, but they can be the same or different. So if C has four points, then Y_i can be any of the four points, possibly repeated.But to maximize the product, we need to choose points Y₁, ..., Yₙ (each from C) such that the product of their distances from X is maximized. But since we can choose the Y_i&#39;s for each X, but actually, the problem says &quot;points Y₁, Y₂, ..., Yₙ are all elements of set C&quot;. Wait, but are the Y_i&#39;s fixed once X is chosen, or can we choose Y_i&#39;s depending on X to maximize the product?Wait, the problem states: &quot;the product of the lengths of n segments XY₁ ⋅ XY₂ ⋅ XY₃ ⋅ … ⋅ XYₙ can take, where point X is an arbitrarily chosen point from set A, and points Y₁, Y₂, Y₃, ..., Yₙ are all elements of set C&quot;.So, for a given X, you can choose any Y₁,...,Yₙ in C, and compute the product. Then, the maximum over all X in A and all possible choices of Y₁,...,Yₙ in C is required.Wait, but actually, the way it&#39;s phrased is a bit ambiguous. Is the maximum over X in A, and for each X, the maximum product over Y₁,...,Yₙ in C? Or is it the maximum over all possible combinations of X in A and Y₁,...,Yₙ in C?I think it&#39;s the latter. Because the problem says &quot;the maximum value that the product ... can take, where point X is an arbitrarily chosen point from set A, and points Y₁, ..., Yₙ are all elements of set C&quot;. So the maximum is over all possible X in A and Y₁,...,Yₙ in C. So we need to maximize the product over all possible X in A and Y_i in C.But since for each X, we can choose the Y_i&#39;s as any points in C, so for each X, the maximum product would be the product of the maximum distances from X to each Y_i. Wait, but since the product is multiplicative, to maximize the product, for each X, we would choose the Y_i&#39;s that are farthest from X. But since all Y_i&#39;s are in C, and C has four points, then for each X, the maximum distance from X to any Y in C is the maximum of the four distances from X to each of the four points in C. So if we can choose the same Y_i multiple times, then the maximum product for a given X would be [max_Y∈C distance(X,Y)]^n. But if we have to choose different Y_i&#39;s, but since n can be any number, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the Y_i&#39;s are distinct. So likely, we can repeat Y_i&#39;s. So for each X, the maximum product is [max distance]^n. Therefore, the overall maximum would be [max_{X∈A} max_{Y∈C} distance(X,Y)]^n. Therefore, the maximum of the product is the nth power of the maximum possible distance between a point X in A and a point Y in C.But wait, but the problem says &quot;the product of the lengths of n segments XY₁ ⋅ XY₂ ⋅ … ⋅ XYₙ&quot;. So if we can choose Y₁,...,Yₙ as any points in C (possibly repeating), then the maximum product would be [max_{Y∈C} distance(X,Y)]^n for a given X. Therefore, to maximize the product, we need to maximize [max_Y distance(X,Y)]^n over all X in A. So the maximum value is [max_{X∈A, Y∈C} distance(X,Y)]^n. So first, find the maximum distance between any point X in A and any point Y in C, then raise it to the power of n.But wait, but since C is a subset of A? Wait, no. Wait, set A is the circle with center (1,1) and radius 5. Set C is the intersection of A and B, which are four points on the circle. So C is four points on the circle. Therefore, points Y are on the circle A. Therefore, for any X in A, the distance between X and Y is the distance between two points on the circle. The maximum distance between two points on a circle is the diameter. So the maximum possible distance between any two points on the circle is 10 (since radius is 5). Therefore, if there exist two points in C that are diametrically opposed, then the maximum distance would be 10. But looking at C: the four points are (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), (1,-4). Let&#39;s check the distances between them.Distance between (6,1) and (-4,1): 10 units along the x-axis. So that&#39;s the diameter. Similarly, distance between (1,6) and (1,-4) is 10 units along the y-axis. So those are diameters. So if X is at (-4,1), then Y= (6,1) is 10 units away. Similarly, if X is at (1,-4), then Y=(1,6) is 10 units away. But wait, but X is any point on the circle. So to get the maximum distance between X and Y where X is on the circle and Y is in C (the four points), we need to see what&#39;s the maximum possible.Wait, but since Y is fixed as one of the four points, and X is variable on the circle. Wait, but the problem says X is any point on A, and Y₁,...,Yₙ are points in C. So for each X, we can choose Y_i&#39;s as points in C (the four points). So the maximum distance from X to any Y in C would vary depending on X. So the maximum distance over all X and Y would be the maximum of the distances from any X on the circle to any of the four Y points.But to find the maximum possible distance between a point X on the circle and a point Y in C, we need to find the maximum of |X - Y| where X is on the circle (center (1,1), radius 5) and Y is one of the four points: (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), (1,-4).Wait, but the four Y points are themselves on the circle, as we established earlier. Because set C is the intersection of A and B, and A is the circle. Therefore, all Y in C are on the circle. Therefore, the maximum distance between X and Y, where both X and Y are on the circle, is the diameter, which is 10. Therefore, if X and Y are diametrically opposed points on the circle, the distance is 10. However, in our case, the Y points are fixed as the four vertices. So to get the maximum distance between X and Y, we need to find the maximum distance from a point X on the circle to one of the four Y points.Wait, but since the Y points are on the circle, the maximum distance from X to Y would be the maximum over all Y in C of |X - Y|. Since the circle is fixed, we can parametrize X as (1 + 5 cos θ, 1 + 5 sin θ). Then compute the distance from X to each Y in C and find the maximum.Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for each Y in C, the maximum distance from Y to another point on the circle is 10, but only if there is a point diametrically opposed to Y on the circle. Let&#39;s check if the four Y points have their diametrically opposed points also on the circle.Take Y=(6,1). The diametrically opposed point would be (1 - (6 -1), 1 - (1 -1)) = (1 -5, 1) = (-4,1), which is another Y point. Similarly, Y=(1,6) has diametrically opposed point (1,1 -5)=(1,-4), which is also a Y point. So for each Y in C, the diametrically opposed point is also in C. Therefore, the maximum distance from Y to any point on the circle is 10, achieved at its diametrically opposed Y point.However, if X is not diametrically opposed to any Y, then the distance would be less. So for a general X on the circle, the maximum distance to any Y in C is the maximum of the distances from X to each of the four Y points.But we need to find the maximum over all X in A (the circle) of the maximum distance from X to Y in C. Wait, but if for each Y in C, the maximum distance from Y is 10 (achieved at its diametrically opposed point), then the maximum distance over all X and Y is 10. But does that hold?Wait, let&#39;s consider X as the diametrically opposed point to Y=(6,1), which is (-4,1). Then the distance between X=(-4,1) and Y=(6,1) is 10. Similarly, X=(1,-4) and Y=(1,6) is 10. So these are points in A (the circle) and Y in C, giving distance 10. So the maximum possible distance is 10.But wait, what if we take a different X not in C? For example, take X somewhere else on the circle, say (1 + 5,1) = (6,1), which is in C. Then the distance from X=(6,1) to Y=(6,1) is zero. But the maximum distance from X=(6,1) to any Y in C is the distance to (-4,1), which is 10. So even if X is one of the Y points, the maximum distance is 10.Wait, so for any X in A, the maximum distance to a Y in C is 10. Wait, is that true?Wait, no. Suppose X is some point on the circle not diametrically opposed to any Y in C. For example, take X=(1 + 5 cos θ, 1 + 5 sin θ) where θ is 45 degrees. Then X would be (1 + (5√2/2), 1 + (5√2/2)). Then the distances from X to each of the four Y points would be:Distance to (6,1):√[(5 cos θ -5)^2 + (5 sin θ)^2] = √[25(cos θ -1)^2 + 25 sin²θ] = 5√[(cos θ -1)^2 + sin²θ] = 5√[cos²θ - 2 cos θ +1 + sin²θ] = 5√[2 - 2 cos θ] = 5*2 sin(θ/2) = 10 sin(θ/2).Similarly, distance to (-4,1):√[(5 cos θ +5)^2 + (5 sin θ)^2] = 5√[(cos θ +1)^2 + sin²θ] = 5√[2 + 2 cos θ] = 10 cos(θ/2).Distance to (1,6):√[(5 cos θ)^2 + (5 sin θ -5)^2] = 5√[cos²θ + (sin θ -1)^2] = 5√[cos²θ + sin²θ - 2 sin θ +1] = 5√[2 - 2 sin θ] = 10 sin((θ - π/2)/2 + π/4) or something. Alternatively, 10 sin( (π/2 - θ)/2 ) ?Wait, maybe it&#39;s similar to the previous ones. Let me compute:√[25 cos²θ + 25(sin θ -1)^2] = 5√[cos²θ + sin²θ - 2 sin θ +1] =5√[2 - 2 sin θ] =5√[2(1 - sin θ)] =5*2√[(1 - sin θ)/2] =10 cos(π/4 - θ/2). Hmm, maybe not necessary. The key point is that depending on θ, different distances will be maximized.But in the example where θ=45 degrees (π/4), then distance to (6,1) is 10 sin(π/8) ≈ 10*0.3827 ≈ 3.827, distance to (-4,1) is 10 cos(π/8) ≈ 10*0.9239 ≈9.239, distance to (1,6) is 10√[2 - 2 sin(π/4)] =10√[2 - 2*(√2/2)]=10√[2 -√2]≈10*0.541≈5.41, and distance to (1,-4) would be similar but with sin replaced by -sin.Wait, actually, distance to (1,-4):√[(5 cos θ)^2 + (5 sin θ +5)^2] =5√[cos²θ + (sin θ +1)^2] =5√[cos²θ + sin²θ + 2 sin θ +1]=5√[2 + 2 sin θ] =10 cos(θ/2 - π/4). Hmm, not sure. But in any case, for θ=45 degrees, the distances are approximately 3.827, 9.239, 5.41, and maybe another value. So the maximum of these is approximately 9.239, which is less than 10. Therefore, the maximum distance from such an X is not 10. Therefore, the maximum distance of 10 is achieved only when X is diametrically opposed to one of the Y points. Thus, the overall maximum distance between X and Y is 10, achieved when X is the diametrically opposed point to one of the Y&#39;s in C.Therefore, the maximum value of the product XY₁⋅XY₂⋅…⋅XYₙ is 10^n, since we can choose all Y_i&#39;s to be the Y point diametrically opposed to X. Wait, but if X is fixed, then we can choose Y_i&#39;s as the farthest point from X. However, the maximum distance from X is 10 only if X is one of the diametrically opposed points. Wait, but if X is arbitrary, then the maximum distance from X to any Y in C is variable. To achieve the overall maximum product, we need to choose X such that the maximum distance from X to any Y in C is maximized, which as we saw is 10, achieved when X is diametrically opposed to one of the Y&#39;s. However, when X is diametrically opposed to a Y, then the distance between them is 10, but the distances to the other Y&#39;s might be shorter. However, since we can choose all Y_i&#39;s to be the same point (the farthest one from X), then the product would be [10]^n. So for example, if X is (-4,1), then choosing all Y_i&#39;s as (6,1) gives product (10)^n. Similarly, if X is (1,-4), choosing all Y_i&#39;s as (1,6) gives product (10)^n. Therefore, the maximum possible product is 10^n.But wait, let me confirm. Suppose X is at (-4,1). Then Y=(6,1) is 10 units away. The other Y points are (1,6) and (1,-4). The distance from X=(-4,1) to (1,6) is √[(1 - (-4))² + (6 -1)²] = √[25 +25]=√50≈7.07. Similarly, distance to (1,-4) is √[(1 - (-4))² + (-4 -1)²]=√[25 +25]=√50≈7.07. Therefore, if we choose Y_i&#39;s as (6,1) each, the product is 10^n. Alternatively, if we choose some Y_i&#39;s as (1,6) or (1,-4), the product would be lower. Therefore, to maximize the product, we would choose all Y_i&#39;s as the farthest Y from X, which is 10. Therefore, the maximum product is 10^n. Similarly, if X is at (1,-4), we can choose all Y_i&#39;s as (1,6), getting 10^n. Therefore, regardless of X being at one of the diametrically opposed points, the maximum product for such an X is 10^n.However, what if X is somewhere else? For example, take X=(1,1), the center. Then the distance to each Y is 5 units, since Y&#39;s are on the circle of radius 5. So product would be 5^n, which is less than 10^n. So indeed, the maximum product is achieved when X is at one of the diametrically opposed points to a Y in C, and we choose all Y_i&#39;s as that farthest Y. Therefore, the maximum value is 10^n.But wait, but the problem states that X is &quot;an arbitrarily chosen point from set A&quot;. Wait, does &quot;arbitrarily chosen&quot; mean that we have to consider the maximum over all X, i.e., the supremum? Because if X can be chosen to be any point in A, then we can choose X to be such that one of the Y_i&#39;s is 10 away, hence making the product 10^n. Therefore, the maximum possible value is 10^n.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Let&#39;s check again. Suppose we choose X to be at (-4,1), which is in set A (since it&#39;s on the circle). Then the distance from X to Y=(6,1) is 10. So the product of n such distances would be 10^n. Similarly, if we choose X=(6,1), then the distance to Y=(-4,1) is 10, but the distance to other Y&#39;s is less. However, since in the problem statement we can choose the Y_i&#39;s after choosing X, then for X=(6,1), to maximize the product, we would choose all Y_i&#39;s as Y=(-4,1), giving distance 10. But wait, X=(6,1) is one of the points in C, but we can still choose Y_i&#39;s as other points in C.Wait, but if X is in A, and Y_i&#39;s are in C, which is a subset of A. So if X is in C, then Y_i&#39;s can be X itself, but the distance would be zero. But to maximize the product, we need to choose Y_i&#39;s as far as possible from X. So if X is in C, like (6,1), then the farthest Y from X is (-4,1), which is 10 away. So even if X is in C, the maximum distance is still 10. Therefore, regardless of where X is in A, the maximum distance to a Y in C is 10, achieved when Y is diametrically opposed to X. But not all X&#39;s have a diametrically opposed Y in C. For example, take X=(1 +5,1 +0)=(6,1). Its diametrically opposed point is (-4,1), which is in C. Similarly, X=(1,6) has diametrically opposed point (1,-4), which is in C. But suppose X is some other point on the circle not in C. For example, take X=(1 + 5*cos θ, 1 +5*sin θ) where θ is not aligned with the axes. Then, the diametrically opposed point would be (1 -5*cos θ,1 -5*sin θ). But this point might not be in C. Since C only has four points: (6,1), (-4,1), (1,6), (1,-4). Therefore, unless the diametrically opposed point is one of these four, it&#39;s not in C. So for arbitrary X, the diametrically opposed point is not in C, so the maximum distance from X to C is less than 10.Wait, this seems contradictory to the earlier statement. Let me clarify.If X is not one of the four points in C, then the diametrically opposed point to X is not in C. Therefore, the maximum distance from X to C would be the maximum distance from X to any of the four Y points in C. Which might be less than 10.For example, take X=(1 +5*cos(45°),1 +5*sin(45°))≈(1 +3.535,1 +3.535)≈(4.535,4.535). Then, the distances to each Y in C:Distance to (6,1): sqrt((6 -4.535)^2 + (1 -4.535)^2) ≈sqrt(2.135² + (-3.535)²)≈sqrt(4.56 +12.5)≈sqrt(17.06)≈4.13.Distance to (-4,1): sqrt((-4 -4.535)^2 + (1 -4.535)^2)≈sqrt((-8.535)^2 + (-3.535)^2)≈sqrt(72.85 +12.5)≈sqrt(85.35)≈9.24.Distance to (1,6): sqrt((1 -4.535)^2 + (6 -4.535)^2)≈sqrt((-3.535)^2 +1.465²)≈sqrt(12.5 +2.15)≈sqrt(14.65)≈3.83.Distance to (1,-4): sqrt((1 -4.535)^2 + (-4 -4.535)^2)≈sqrt(12.5 +72.85)≈sqrt(85.35)≈9.24.So the maximum distance is approximately 9.24, which is less than 10. Therefore, for this X, the maximum distance to C is about 9.24, so the product would be (9.24)^n, which is less than 10^n. Therefore, the maximum product over all X and Y_i&#39;s in C is achieved when X is such that one of the Y points is diametrically opposed to it, i.e., when X is at (-4,1), (1,-4), (6,1), or (1,6), but wait, (6,1) and (1,6) are in C. If X is at (-4,1), which is in C, then Y=(6,1) is 10 away. Similarly, if X is at (1,-4), Y=(1,6) is 10 away. However, if X is at (6,1), then the farthest Y is (-4,1), which is 10 away. Similarly for (1,6). Therefore, if X is at any of the four points in C, the maximum distance to another Y in C is 10. For X not in C, the maximum distance is less than 10. Therefore, the maximum possible product is indeed 10^n, achieved when X is at one of the four points in C and all Y_i&#39;s are chosen as the diametrically opposed Y in C.Therefore, the answer should be 10^n, so boxed, it&#39;s boxed{10^n}.But wait, let me verify once more. Suppose X is at (-4,1), which is in A (since it&#39;s on the circle). Then Y=(6,1) is 10 units away. So if we choose all Y_i&#39;s as (6,1), the product is 10^n. Similarly, for X=(6,1), Y=(-4,1), same product. For X=(1,-4), Y=(1,6), same. For X=(1,6), Y=(1,-4). So regardless, choosing X as one of the four points in C and Y as the opposite point gives 10^n. If X is any other point, the maximum distance is less, hence the product is less. Therefore, the maximum possible value is 10^n.Yes, that seems correct.Final Answerboxed{10^n}&lt;/think&gt;Set ( A ) is defined by the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 2y + 23 ). Rewriting this in standard form, we get a circle centered at ( (1, 1) ) with radius 5:[(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 25]Set ( B ) is defined by ( |x - 1| + |y - 1| = 5 ), which is a diamond (a square rotated 45 degrees) centered at ( (1, 1) ) with vertices at ( (6, 1) ), ( (-4, 1) ), ( (1, 6) ), and ( (1, -4) ).Set ( C ) is the intersection of sets ( A ) and ( B ), which consists of the four vertices of the diamond: ( (6, 1) ), ( (-4, 1) ), ( (1, 6) ), and ( (1, -4) ). These points are also on the circle ( A ).To find the maximum value of the product ( XY_1 cdot XY_2 cdot ldots cdot XY_n ), where ( X ) is a point in ( A ) and ( Y_1, Y_2, ldots, Y_n ) are points in ( C ), we need to maximize the distances from ( X ) to the points in ( C ). The maximum distance between any two points on the circle ( A ) is the diameter, which is 10. This distance is achieved when ( X ) is diametrically opposed to one of the points in ( C ).For example, if ( X ) is at ( (-4, 1) ), the distance to ( (6, 1) ) is 10. Similarly, if ( X ) is at ( (1, -4) ), the distance to ( (1, 6) ) is 10. Therefore, the maximum distance from any ( X ) in ( A ) to a point in ( C ) is 10.Thus, the maximum value of the product of the lengths of ( n ) segments ( XY_1 cdot XY_2 cdot ldots cdot XY_n ) is ( 10^n ).[boxed{10^n}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2fff42df></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2fff42df><span class="icon" data-v-2fff42df>🔑:</span>Answer: 1250Solution. The set A is (x-1)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=25, which is a circle with center (1 ; 1) and radius 5. The set B is a square with vertices (-4 ; 1),(1 ; 6),(6 ; 1),(1 ;-4). The center of the square is the point (1 ; 1), the diagonals of the square are 10, and the sides are 5 sqrt{2}. The set C consists of 4 points on the circle: (-4 ; 1),(1 ; 6),(6 ; 1),(1 ;-4), which are also the vertices of the inscribed square. Let&#39;s denote them as Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}, Y_{4}. If we now take a point X on the arc Y_{2} Y_{3} (for definiteness), denote the distance from X to the line Y_{1} Y_{2} as a, and note that angle Y_{2} X Y_{1}=frac{angle Y_{2} O Y_{1}}{2}=45^{circ}, then we get: X Y_{1} cdot X Y_{2}=frac{X Y_{1} cdot X Y_{2} cdot 2 sin 45^{circ}}{2 sin 45^{circ}}=S_{X Y_{1} Y_{2}} cdot frac{2}{sin 45^{circ}}=frac{Y_{1} Y_{2} cdot a}{2} cdot frac{2 cdot 2}{sqrt{2}}=frac{5 sqrt{2} cdot a}{2} cdot frac{4}{sqrt{2}}=10 a. Similarly, X Y_{3} cdot X Y_{4}=10(5 sqrt{2}-a). Then X Y_{1} cdot X Y_{2} cdot X Y_{3} cdot X Y_{4}=100 a(5 sqrt{2}-a). The maximum of this quadratic function is achieved at a=frac{5 sqrt{2}}{2} and is equal to 1250. Note that this means that the point X is at the midpoint of the arc Y_{2} Y_{3} (or any of the other three arcs).## B-2The set A on the plane O x y is defined by the equation x^{2}+y^{2}=2 x+2 y+14.

How many more textit{ground beef}s than textit{lean beef}s does Farmer James have?[i]Proposed by James Lin[/i]</div><div class="divider" data-v-2fff42df></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2fff42df><span class="icon" data-v-2fff42df>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. Farmer James has three types of cows: ground beef, steak, and lean beef. Each type has a different number of legs. Ground beef cows have zero legs, steak cows have one leg, and lean beef cows have two legs. The total number of cows is 20, and the total number of legs is 18. We need to find how many more ground beefs there are than lean beefs. Hmm, okay.Let me start by assigning variables to each type of cow. Let&#39;s say:- Let G represent the number of ground beef cows. These have 0 legs.- Let S represent the number of steak cows. These have 1 leg.- Let L represent the number of lean beef cows. These have 2 legs.We know two things: the total number of cows is 20, and the total number of legs is 18. So, I can set up two equations based on that.First equation: total cows.G + S + L = 20.Second equation: total legs. Since each ground beef has 0 legs, they contribute 0*G = 0 legs. Each steak cow contributes 1*S legs, and each lean beef contributes 2*L legs. So, total legs:0*G + 1*S + 2*L = 18.Simplifying that, the second equation is:S + 2L = 18.So now we have a system of two equations:1) G + S + L = 202) S + 2L = 18We need to find how many more ground beefs (G) there are than lean beefs (L). So, the answer will be G - L. To find that, we need to find G and L, or the relationship between G and L.Looking at the two equations, maybe we can express G in terms of S and L from the first equation, then substitute into the second?From equation 1: G = 20 - S - L.But equation 2 is S + 2L = 18. So, maybe we can express S from equation 2 and substitute into equation 1.From equation 2: S = 18 - 2L.Then substitute S into equation 1:G + (18 - 2L) + L = 20.Simplify that:G + 18 - 2L + L = 20G + 18 - L = 20Subtract 18 from both sides:G - L = 2.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So, G - L equals 2. Which is exactly what the problem is asking for: how many more ground beefs than lean beefs there are. So, the answer is 2?Wait, but let me double-check. Let&#39;s verify that.If G - L = 2, then G = L + 2.So, we can express G as L + 2.We also know that S = 18 - 2L from equation 2.Then, substituting back into equation 1:G + S + L = (L + 2) + (18 - 2L) + L = L + 2 + 18 - 2L + L = (L - 2L + L) + (2 + 18) = 0L + 20 = 20.Which matches the total number of cows. So that checks out. So regardless of the value of L, the equations are satisfied as long as G = L + 2 and S = 18 - 2L. But do we need to ensure that S, G, and L are all non-negative integers?Yes, because the number of cows can&#39;t be negative. So, let&#39;s check the possible values for L.Since S = 18 - 2L must be non-negative, we have:18 - 2L ≥ 0 → 2L ≤ 18 → L ≤ 9.Also, L must be a non-negative integer, so L can be from 0 to 9.Similarly, G = L + 2, so G must also be non-negative. Since L can be up to 9, G can be up to 11. Since G + S + L = 20, and S is 18 - 2L, then:(L + 2) + (18 - 2L) + L = 20, as we saw earlier, so all equations are satisfied for any integer L from 0 to 9.But wait, the problem doesn&#39;t state that the number of each type of cow has to be non-negative? Wait, actually, of course, they must be non-negative because you can&#39;t have a negative number of cows. So, we need to check if L can take values such that all three variables are non-negative.So L must satisfy:1. L ≥ 02. S = 18 - 2L ≥ 0 → L ≤ 93. G = L + 2 ≥ 0 → Since L ≥ 0, G will automatically be ≥ 2, which is fine.Therefore, L can be 0 through 9. However, we might need more information to determine the exact numbers, but the problem just asks for how many more ground beefs than lean beefs there are. Which is G - L = 2, regardless of the value of L. Therefore, no matter how many lean beef cows there are, there will always be 2 more ground beef cows than lean beef cows. So the answer is 2.But let me test with an example. Suppose L = 5.Then G = 5 + 2 = 7.S = 18 - 2*5 = 8.Total cows: 7 + 8 + 5 = 20. Total legs: 8*1 + 5*2 = 8 + 10 = 18. Correct.Another example: L = 3.G = 5, S = 18 - 6 = 12.Total cows: 5 + 12 + 3 = 20. Legs: 12 + 6 = 18. Correct.If L = 9:G = 11, S = 18 - 18 = 0.Total cows: 11 + 0 + 9 = 20. Legs: 0 + 18 = 18. Correct.If L = 0:G = 2, S = 18, total cows: 2 + 18 + 0 = 20. Legs: 18*1 + 0*2 = 18. Correct.In all cases, G - L = 2. So regardless of the actual numbers, the difference is always 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.Final Answerboxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;Let ( G ) represent the number of ground beef cows (0 legs), ( S ) represent the number of steak cows (1 leg), and ( L ) represent the number of lean beef cows (2 legs). We know the following:1. The total number of cows is 20:   [   G + S + L = 20   ]2. The total number of legs is 18:   [   S + 2L = 18   ]From the second equation, we can express ( S ) in terms of ( L ):[S = 18 - 2L]Substituting ( S ) into the first equation:[G + (18 - 2L) + L = 20]Simplifying this equation:[G + 18 - L = 20][G - L = 2]Thus, the number of ground beef cows (( G )) is 2 more than the number of lean beef cows (( L )). Therefore, the answer is:[boxed{2}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to solve this problem step by step. So, Farmer James has three types of cows: ground beef (0 legs), steak (1 leg), and lean beef (2 legs). The total number of cows is 20, and the total number of legs is 18. We need to find how many more ground beefs there are than lean beefs. First, let me define some variables to represent the number of each type of cow. Let&#39;s say:- Let G be the number of ground beef cows. These have 0 legs each.- Let S be the number of steak cows. These have 1 leg each.- Let L be the number of lean beef cows. These have 2 legs each.We know two main things: the total number of cows and the total number of legs. So, we can set up two equations based on that.The total number of cows equation would be:G + S + L = 20The total number of legs equation would be:0*G + 1*S + 2*L = 18Simplifying that, it becomes:S + 2L = 18So now we have a system of two equations with three variables. Hmm, but usually with two equations, we can solve for two variables if we have three. Wait, but maybe we can express one variable in terms of another and find the relationship. Let me see.From the first equation, G + S + L = 20. Let&#39;s solve for G:G = 20 - S - LSo, G is expressed in terms of S and L. Now, our second equation is S + 2L = 18. Let&#39;s see if we can substitute G into something here. But maybe not directly. Let me think.We need to find how many more ground beefs (G) there are than lean beefs (L), which is G - L. So, if we can find G and L, then we can compute the difference. Alternatively, maybe we can find G - L directly.Since G = 20 - S - L, then G - L = 20 - S - L - L = 20 - S - 2L. So, G - L = 20 - (S + 2L). But from the second equation, S + 2L = 18. Therefore, substituting that into the equation above: G - L = 20 - 18 = 2.Wait, is that possible? So, does that mean that G - L = 2? That would mean there are 2 more ground beefs than lean beefs. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify if that&#39;s correct.Let me check my steps again. Starting with G = 20 - S - L. Then G - L = 20 - S - L - L = 20 - S - 2L. Then since S + 2L = 18, substituting gives G - L = 20 - 18 = 2. That seems right. But let me test this with actual numbers to make sure. Let&#39;s suppose that S + 2L = 18. Let&#39;s pick some numbers for L and S. For example, suppose L = 5, then S = 18 - 2*5 = 8. Then G = 20 - 8 - 5 = 7. Then G - L = 7 - 5 = 2. If L = 6, then S = 18 - 12 = 6. Then G = 20 - 6 - 6 = 8. Then G - L = 8 - 6 = 2. If L = 4, S = 18 - 8 = 10, G = 20 - 10 -4 =6. G - L = 6 -4=2. So, in each case, regardless of L and S, G - L is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. That seems to hold true. So, the number of ground beef cows is 2 more than the number of lean beef cows. But let me think again to ensure there&#39;s no mistake. The problem is set up with cows having 0, 1, or 2 legs, which is a bit unusual, but the math seems to check out. The key was expressing G - L in terms of the equations we have. Since S + 2L is 18, and total cows are 20, then G becomes 20 - (S + L). Then G - L is 20 - S - L - L = 20 - (S + 2L) = 20 - 18 = 2. Yes, that&#39;s consistent.Therefore, the answer is 2. There are 2 more ground beef cows than lean beef cows.Final Answerboxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;Let ( G ) be the number of ground beef cows (0 legs), ( S ) be the number of steak cows (1 leg), and ( L ) be the number of lean beef cows (2 legs).

I need to find the value of sin(-600°). Hmm, negative angles can be a bit tricky, but I remember that a negative angle means we&#39;re rotating clockwise instead of the usual counterclockwise. So, -600° would be the same as rotating 600° clockwise from the positive x-axis. But maybe it&#39;s easier to convert that negative angle to a positive one by adding 360° until it&#39;s within 0° to 360°. Let me try that first.So, starting with -600°, if I add 360°, that gives me -240°. Still negative. Let me add another 360°, so -240° + 360° = 120°. Ah, so -600° is coterminal with 120°. That means they have the same terminal side, so their sine values should be the same. Wait, but 120° is in the second quadrant, right? In the second quadrant, sine is positive. So sin(120°) is positive. But wait, the original angle was -600°, so maybe we need to check if there&#39;s another way to look at it.Alternatively, I know that sine is an odd function, which means sin(-θ) = -sinθ. So maybe I can use that property here. Let&#39;s see. If I can express sin(-600°) as -sin(600°). Then I just need to find sin(600°) and take the negative of it. That might be another approach.So let&#39;s try both methods and see if they give the same answer.First method: -600° is coterminal with -600° + 2*360° = -600° + 720° = 120°. Therefore, sin(-600°) = sin(120°). Since 120° is in the second quadrant, sin(120°) = sin(180° - 60°) = sin(60°) = √3/2. Since sine is positive in the second quadrant, sin(120°) is √3/2. Therefore, sin(-600°) = √3/2. But wait, the answer options have B as √3/2 and D as -√3/2. But according to this, the answer would be B. But hold on, let me check the second method.Second method: sin(-600°) = -sin(600°). So compute sin(600°). 600° is more than 360°, so subtract 360° to find the coterminal angle: 600° - 360° = 240°. So sin(600°) = sin(240°). 240° is in the third quadrant, where sine is negative. Sin(240°) = sin(180° + 60°) = -sin(60°) = -√3/2. Therefore, sin(600°) = -√3/2, so -sin(600°) = -(-√3/2) = √3/2. So both methods give √3/2. But according to the answer options, B is √3/2. But wait, the original problem is sin(-600°). So according to this, the answer should be B.But let me check again to be sure. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. When I added 720° to -600°, I got 120°, which is correct. So sin(-600°) = sin(120°) = √3/2, so answer B. Alternatively, using the second method, sin(-600°) = -sin(600°) = -sin(240°) = -(-√3/2) = √3/2. So both methods give B. However, looking at the options, B is √3/2. But wait, the options given are:A: 1/2B: √3/2C: -1/2D: -√3/2So according to both methods, the answer is B. But let me cross-verify once more. Maybe I messed up the coterminal angles?Wait, -600 degrees. Let&#39;s compute how many full rotations that is. Since 360° is a full rotation, dividing 600 by 360 gives 1.666..., so that&#39;s 1 full rotation (360°) plus 240°. So -600° is the same as -360° -240°, which is equivalent to -240°, which is coterminal with -240° + 360° = 120°. So yes, -600° is coterminal with 120°, which is in the second quadrant. So sin(-600°) = sin(120°) = √3/2. Therefore, answer B.But wait, another way: Let&#39;s convert the angle to radians just to double-check? Maybe not necessary, but let&#39;s try. -600° in radians is -600*(π/180) = -10π/3 radians. To find a positive equivalent, add 2π until it&#39;s within 0 to 2π. -10π/3 + 4π = -10π/3 + 12π/3 = 2π/3 radians. 2π/3 radians is 120°, so sin(2π/3) is √3/2. So that&#39;s another confirmation.Alternatively, using reference angles. The reference angle for 120° is 60°, so sin(120°) = sin(60°) = √3/2. All right, so that&#39;s consistent.But why is there an option D? Maybe I did something wrong here? Wait, let&#39;s check the second method again. sin(-600°) = -sin(600°). 600° divided by 360° is 1 and 240°, so 600° = 360° + 240°, so sin(600°) = sin(240°). 240° is in the third quadrant, reference angle 60°, so sin(240°) = -sin(60°) = -√3/2. Therefore, -sin(600°) = -(-√3/2) = √3/2. So again, answer B. So both methods give B. So maybe the answer is B? But the options are A, B, C, D. Wait, but maybe the original question is a trick question?Wait, perhaps I messed up the coterminal angle calculation. Let&#39;s verify:Starting from -600°, adding 360° gives -240°, still negative. Adding another 360°, gives -240° + 360° = 120°, which is correct. So -600° is coterminal with 120°, so the sine is positive √3/2. So answer B. But maybe the answer is different? Let me check once more.Alternatively, maybe I should visualize the angle. Starting at the positive x-axis, rotating 600° clockwise. 600° divided by 360° is 1 full rotation plus 240°, so rotating 360° clockwise brings you back to the starting point, then another 240° clockwise. 240° clockwise from the positive x-axis is the same as 120° counterclockwise into the second quadrant. So the terminal side is at 120°, so sin is √3/2. Yes, that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, if I think of the unit circle, -600° would correspond to going around clockwise. Each full rotation is 360°, so 600° is 360° + 240°, so one full rotation clockwise (which brings you back to the start) plus another 240° clockwise. 240° clockwise is equivalent to 120° counterclockwise, landing in the second quadrant. So the sine value is positive, and the reference angle is 60°, so sine is √3/2. So the answer is B.But wait, the options given include B and D. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I messed up the sign somewhere. Let&#39;s check the second method again. sin(-θ) = -sinθ. So sin(-600°) = -sin(600°). Then sin(600°) is sin(600° - 360°) = sin(240°). sin(240°) is -√3/2. Therefore, -sin(600°) = -(-√3/2) = √3/2. So same answer. So both methods agree.Therefore, the answer is B: √3/2. But hold on, the original problem lists the options as A:1/2, B:√3/2, C:-1/2, D:-√3/2. So B is positive √3/2, D is negative. So unless there is a miscalculation, answer should be B.Wait, but I just thought, maybe in some textbooks, different conventions? Wait, no. Sine is positive in the second quadrant. 120° is in the second quadrant. So sin(120°) is positive. So sin(-600°) which is coterminal with 120° is positive. Therefore, answer is B.But let me check with another approach. Using the unit circle, -600° angle. Let&#39;s compute how many full circles: 600 divided by 360 is 1.666..., so one full rotation (360°) and 240° remaining. So -600° is equivalent to -360° -240°, which is a full rotation clockwise plus 240° more. A full rotation brings you back, then 240° clockwise from the positive x-axis. 240° clockwise is the same as 120° counterclockwise, placing the terminal side in the second quadrant. The coordinates there would be (-1/2, √3/2), so the y-coordinate (which is sine) is √3/2. So that&#39;s positive, confirming answer B.Therefore, I think the correct answer is B. But wait, the options given in the problem, the user wrote:A: 1/2B: √3/2C: -1/2D: -√3/2So according to all calculations, the answer is B. But maybe the original problem had a typo? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coterminal angle? Let me check again. -600° + 720° = 120°, correct. 720° is two full rotations. So -600° + 720° = 120°, so that&#39;s correct. So sin(-600°) = sin(120°) = √3/2, which is B. So I think that&#39;s the answer.But why is there an option D? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the coterminal angle? Wait, let&#39;s think differently. If someone converts -600° by adding 360°, they might do -600 + 360 = -240°, then add another 360°: -240 + 360 = 120°, which is what I did. Alternatively, maybe someone else does -600° divided by 360°, gets -1.666..., takes the decimal part. But I think my method is correct.Alternatively, maybe using reference angles wrong? For 120°, reference angle is 180° - 120° = 60°, so sin(120°) = sin(60°) = √3/2, correct. So that&#39;s positive. Therefore, answer B.Therefore, after multiple checks, I think the answer is B. But let me check once more. Maybe the question is in degrees, yes. So all calculations are in degrees. So sin(-600°) equals sin(120°) equals √3/2. So the correct answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of (sin(-600^circ)), we can use the following steps:1. Convert the negative angle to a positive coterminal angle:   - Adding (720^circ) (which is (2 times 360^circ)) to (-600^circ) gives:     [     -600^circ + 720^circ = 120^circ     ]   - Therefore, (-600^circ) is coterminal with (120^circ).2. Determine the sine value for the coterminal angle:   - The angle (120^circ) is in the second quadrant where sine is positive.   - The reference angle for (120^circ) is (180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ).   - The sine of (60^circ) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), so (sin(120^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).3. Verify using the property of sine being an odd function:   - (sin(-600^circ) = -sin(600^circ))   - Convert (600^circ) to a coterminal angle by subtracting (360^circ):     [     600^circ - 360^circ = 240^circ     ]   - The angle (240^circ) is in the third quadrant where sine is negative.   - The reference angle for (240^circ) is (240^circ - 180^circ = 60^circ).   - The sine of (60^circ) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), so (sin(240^circ) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).   - Therefore, (-sin(600^circ) = -(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).Both methods confirm that (sin(-600^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of sin(-600°). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Trigonometry can be a bit tricky sometimes, especially with negative angles and angles larger than 360°. Let me recall some key concepts.First, I remember that sine is a periodic function with a period of 360°, which means that sin(θ) = sin(θ + 360°n) for any integer n. Also, since the angle here is negative, I should probably convert it to a positive angle by adding multiples of 360° until it&#39;s within the 0° to 360° range. That might make it easier to evaluate.So, the given angle is -600°. Let me add 360° repeatedly until I get a positive angle between 0° and 360°. Let&#39;s start adding:-600° + 360° = -240°. Still negative. Okay, add another 360°:-240° + 360° = 120°. There we go. So, sin(-600°) is equivalent to sin(120°). Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Because when dealing with negative angles, adding 360° gives a co-terminal angle, but I need to make sure that I&#39;m not missing something here.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the fact that sine is an odd function, which means that sin(-θ) = -sin(θ). So, sin(-600°) = -sin(600°). Then, if I find sin(600°) and take its negative, that should give me the answer. Let me try that approach.Calculating sin(600°). Let&#39;s subtract 360° from 600° to get an equivalent angle within one rotation. 600° - 360° = 240°. So, sin(600°) = sin(240°). Then, sin(-600°) = -sin(240°). Now, I need to evaluate sin(240°). 240° is in the third quadrant where sine is negative. Wait, but if sin(240°) is negative, then -sin(240°) would be positive. Let me confirm the exact value.240° is 180° + 60°, so it&#39;s 60° past 180°. The reference angle here is 240° - 180° = 60°. So, sin(240°) = -sin(60°). Because in the third quadrant, sine is negative. Sin(60°) is √3/2, so sin(240°) is -√3/2. Therefore, -sin(240°) would be -(-√3/2) = √3/2. So, sin(-600°) equals √3/2? But hold on, let me cross-validate this with the previous method where I converted -600° to 120°.Earlier, I thought that -600° is co-terminal with 120°, because -600° + 2*360° = -600° + 720° = 120°. So, sin(-600°) = sin(120°). Then, sin(120°) is sin(180° - 60°) = sin(60°) = √3/2. But wait, 120° is in the second quadrant where sine is positive, so sin(120°) is indeed √3/2. Wait, so according to this method, sin(-600°) = sin(120°) = √3/2. But according to the other method, using the odd function property, sin(-600°) = -sin(600°) = -sin(240°) = √3/2. Both methods give the same result. So, the answer is √3/2, which is option B. But wait, the options are A: 1/2, B: √3/2, C: -1/2, D: -√3/2. So, B is √3/2. Hmm, but let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the steps.Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the co-terminal angle calculation. Let me verify again.Starting with -600°, adding 360° once: -600 + 360 = -240°. Adding another 360°: -240 + 360 = 120°, so yes, co-terminal angle is 120°. So sin(-600°) = sin(120°). 120° is in the second quadrant, reference angle 60°, sin is positive, so sin(120°) = sin(60°) = √3/2. Therefore, answer is B. But wait, another thought: if I use the odd function identity, sin(-θ) = -sinθ. So, sin(-600°) = -sin(600°). Then, 600° divided by 360° is 1 and 240°, so 600° = 360° + 240°, so sin(600°) = sin(240°). 240° is in the third quadrant, reference angle 60°, sin(240°) = -sin(60°) = -√3/2. Therefore, sin(-600°) = -sin(600°) = -(-√3/2) = √3/2. So, same result. So, both methods lead to √3/2, which is option B. But wait, the options include positive and negative. Let me check again.Wait, but in my first approach, converting -600° to 120°, which is in the second quadrant, sin is positive. So, sin(120°) is √3/2, so answer B. The other approach via odd function also gives √3/2. So, answer is B.But wait, hold on. Let me make sure that adding 720° to -600° gives 120°, correct. -600° + 720° = 120°, yes. So, sin(-600°) = sin(120°). Then, 120°, as mentioned, reference angle 60°, sin(60°)=√3/2, positive. Therefore, answer B.Alternatively, is there any chance that I made a mistake in the co-terminal angle? Let&#39;s calculate -600° + 360°*2 = -600 + 720 = 120°, yes. Correct. Alternatively,  -600° divided by 360° is approximately -1.666..., so the angle is equivalent to -600° + 2*360° = 120°, which is correct.Alternatively, maybe I can visualize the unit circle. Starting at 0°, going clockwise 600° (since it&#39;s negative). Each 360° is a full rotation. So, 600° divided by 360° is 1 with a remainder of 240°. So, going clockwise 600° is equivalent to going clockwise 240°, which is the same as going counterclockwise 120°, which places the terminal angle at 120°, which is in the second quadrant. So, sine is positive, and the value is √3/2. So, answer B.But wait, if I go clockwise 600°, how does that translate? Let me think. Clockwise 360° brings me back to 0°, so 600° clockwise is 360° + 240° clockwise. So, 240° clockwise from 0° is equivalent to 120° counterclockwise (since 240° clockwise is the same as 360° - 240° = 120° counterclockwise). Therefore, the terminal side is at 120°, which is in the second quadrant. Therefore, sine is positive, and the value is √3/2. So, answer is B. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.But wait, just to be absolutely thorough, let me check with another method. Using reference angles. For the angle -600°, let&#39;s find its reference angle. But first, convert -600° to a positive angle by adding multiples of 360°.As before, -600° + 720° = 120°, which is in the second quadrant. The reference angle for 120° is 180° - 120° = 60°, so sin(120°) = sin(60°) = √3/2. Hence, sin(-600°) = √3/2. So, B.Alternatively, if I didn&#39;t convert to a positive angle, and tried to find the reference angle directly for -600°, but negative angles can be confusing. Let&#39;s try that approach. Starting from the positive x-axis, rotating -600°, which is 600° clockwise. As before, 600° divided by 360° is 1 full rotation plus 240°, so 240° clockwise. Which is equivalent to 240° clockwise from 0°, which is the same as 120° counterclockwise, which is 120°, reference angle 60°, sin is √3/2. So, same result.Alternatively, maybe using the unit circle coordinates. The coordinates at angle θ are (cosθ, sinθ). For θ = -600°, which we converted to 120°, so cos(-600°) = cos(120°) = -1/2, and sin(-600°) = sin(120°) = √3/2. So, answer is B.Wait, but why does the problem have options C and D as negative? Maybe I made a mistake in considering the sign. Let me check again. So, sin(-600°) = sin(120°) = √3/2. But 120° is in the second quadrant, sine is positive. So, answer is positive √3/2, which is B. Alternatively, if I thought that sin(-600°) was in a different quadrant, but no. Through all methods, it&#39;s positive √3/2. Therefore, the answer should be B.But let me check once more with another perspective. Using the formula sin(θ) = sin(θ + 360°n). So, for θ = -600°, let&#39;s find n such that θ + 360°n is between 0° and 360°. Let&#39;s compute n:-600 + 360n. Let&#39;s solve for n where 0 ≤ -600 + 360n &lt; 360.Adding 600 to all parts: 600 ≤ 360n &lt; 600 + 360 = 960.Divide by 360: 600/360 ≤ n &lt; 960/360. 600/360 = 1.666..., 960/360 = 2.666...So, n must be 2. Then, angle is -600 + 360*2 = -600 + 720 = 120°, which is between 0° and 360°, so sin(-600°) = sin(120°). So, yes, same result.Therefore, the answer is B: √3/2.But wait, the options are listed as A: 1/2, B: √3/2, C: -1/2, D: -√3/2. So, B is positive √3/2. Therefore, the correct answer is B. But let me check once more with a different approach, maybe using radians to verify.Convert -600° to radians: -600° * (π/180) = -10π/3 radians. Then, sin(-10π/3). But sine has a period of 2π, so we can add multiples of 2π to get it within 0 to 2π. Let&#39;s compute -10π/3 + 2π*2 = -10π/3 + 12π/3 = 2π/3. So, sin(-10π/3) = sin(2π/3). 2π/3 is 120°, which is in the second quadrant, sin(2π/3) = √3/2. So, same answer, B.Alternatively, using the odd function property in radians: sin(-10π/3) = -sin(10π/3). Then, 10π/3 - 2π*1 = 10π/3 - 6π/3 = 4π/3. So, sin(10π/3) = sin(4π/3). 4π/3 is in the third quadrant, reference angle π/3, sin(4π/3) = -√3/2. Therefore, -sin(10π/3) = -(-√3/2) = √3/2. Again, same answer.Therefore, regardless of the method used, the result is √3/2, which is option B.But wait, the options given are A: 1/2, B: √3/2, C: -1/2, D: -√3/2. So, B is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{B}.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of (sin(-600^circ)), we can use the periodicity and properties of the sine function.1. Convert the negative angle to a positive co-terminal angle:   [   -600^circ + 720^circ = 120^circ   ]   This shows that (-600^circ) is co-terminal with (120^circ).2. Evaluate (sin(120^circ)):   - (120^circ) is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive.   - The reference angle for (120^circ) is (180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ).   - Therefore, (sin(120^circ) = sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).3.

We have to find the intersection point with the greatest sum of coordinates, x + y, and present it as (x; y). Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We&#39;re dealing with lines where both the slope a and the y-intercept b are natural numbers between 1 and 8 inclusive. So, each line is uniquely determined by a pair (a, b) where a and b are each integers from 1 to 8. The question is asking for the intersection point of any two of these lines that has the maximum possible sum of its x-coordinate and y-coordinate.Alright, so my goal is to find two lines y = a1x + b1 and y = a2x + b2 (where a1 ≠ a2 since parallel lines don&#39;t intersect) such that when I solve for their intersection point (x, y), the value x + y is as large as possible.Let me recall how to find the intersection of two lines. If we have two lines:1. y = a1x + b12. y = a2x + b2Setting them equal to each other gives:a1x + b1 = a2x + b2Solving for x:(a1 - a2)x = b2 - b1x = (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2)Then, substituting back into one of the equations to get y:y = a1*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1So the coordinates of the intersection point are ( (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2), a1*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1 )Therefore, the sum x + y is:(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + [a1*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1]Simplify that:= (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + a1*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1= (1 + a1)*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1Alternatively, factor out (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2):= [ (1 + a1)/(a1 - a2) ] * (b2 - b1) + b1Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe another approach. Let&#39;s denote d = a1 - a2, which is non-zero because a1 ≠ a2. Then x = (b2 - b1)/d, and y = a1x + b1. So x + y = x + a1x + b1 = x(1 + a1) + b1. Substituting x:= (b2 - b1)/d * (1 + a1) + b1= [ (b2 - b1)(1 + a1) ] / d + b1Hmm, so x + y is a function of a1, a2, b1, b2. Since a1, a2, b1, b2 are all between 1 and 8, we need to maximize this expression.Alternatively, maybe instead of working algebraically, I should think about the properties of the lines. To get a large x + y, we want both x and y to be as large as possible. But x and y are related through the lines. So perhaps the intersection point that&#39;s farthest to the right (large x) and highest (large y) would give the maximum sum.But how can we maximize both x and y? Let&#39;s think. If two lines intersect at a point with a large x-coordinate, that would mean they intersect far to the right. Similarly, a large y-coordinate would be high up. But these two might not necessarily be the same point.But since we need the sum x + y, maybe there&#39;s a balance between x and y. However, perhaps there&#39;s a way to get both x and y to be quite large. Let&#39;s try to find such a point.First, let&#39;s note that lines with steeper slopes (higher a) will rise more quickly as x increases, but lines with shallower slopes (lower a) will rise more slowly. So, if we have two lines with different slopes, their intersection point will depend on their slopes and intercepts.To get a large x-coordinate for the intersection, the lines need to intersect far to the right. When would that happen? If two lines are almost parallel but diverge as x increases. Wait, actually, if two lines have slopes a1 and a2 with a1 &gt; a2, then the line with the steeper slope (a1) will eventually overtake the other line as x increases if the steeper line starts below the shallower one. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Suppose line 1 is steeper: a1 &gt; a2. If line 1 is below line 2 at x=0 (i.e., b1 &lt; b2), then since line 1 is steeper, it will catch up to line 2 at some positive x. The x-coordinate where they intersect is (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2). Since a1 &gt; a2 and b2 &gt; b1, this gives a positive x. To maximize this x, we need (b2 - b1) as large as possible and (a1 - a2) as small as possible. Because if the numerator is large and the denominator is small, the fraction becomes large.So, to maximize x, we should have b2 - b1 as big as possible, which would be 8 - 1 = 7, since b2 can be up to 8 and b1 can be as low as 1. And a1 - a2 as small as possible, which is 1 (since a1 and a2 are natural numbers, the smallest positive difference is 1). So, if we take a1 - a2 = 1 and b2 - b1 = 7, then x = 7 / 1 = 7. Then y would be a1*x + b1. Let&#39;s see. If a1 = a2 + 1, then let&#39;s say a2 = 7, a1 = 8 (since a1 and a2 are up to 8). Then, to get b2 - b1 =7, take b2=8 and b1=1. Then x = (8 - 1)/(8 -7) =7/1=7. Then y =8*7 +1=57. So the point is (7,57), sum is 7+57=64.Alternatively, maybe with a1=2 and a2=1, and b2 -b1=7, which would be x=7/(2-1)=7. Then y=2*7 +1=15. The sum is 22, which is much lower. So the first case is better.So the maximum x-coordinate achieved here is 7, with a sum of 64. But maybe there are other intersection points where x is smaller but y is larger, leading to a higher sum.Wait, for example, take two lines that intersect at a higher y but lower x. Let&#39;s see. For that, we need lines that cross at a high y, but how?If two lines intersect at a high y, then their equations must satisfy that at that x, both give a high y. For example, if we have two lines with very large b values but different slopes. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we have two lines with large b&#39;s, say b1=8 and b2=8, but different slopes. But if b1 and b2 are equal, then their intersection is at x=0, since (b2 -b1)/(a1 -a2)=0. So that&#39;s not helpful. So to get a high y, they need to have different b&#39;s.Wait, but if two lines with different slopes intersect, the y-coordinate can be written as y = a1x + b1. If we can get a1 and x such that a1x is large, and b1 is also large. So, maybe if x is large and a1 is large, combined with a large b1.But x is determined by the intersection. Let&#39;s consider a case where a1 is large and a2 is small, but the intercepts are arranged such that they intersect at a high x. Wait, similar to before.Alternatively, maybe two lines with a high slope and high intercept. But how would they intersect?Wait, let&#39;s take two lines with slopes a1 and a2, a1 &gt; a2, and intercepts b1 and b2. If b1 &lt; b2, then they intersect at x=(b2 - b1)/(a1 -a2). If we want both x and y to be large, perhaps we can maximize x, which would also make y large because y = a1x + b1, and a1 is large.In the previous example, we had a1=8, a2=7, b1=1, b2=8. Then x=7, y=57. If instead, we take a1=8, a2=1, b1=1, b2=8. Then x=(8 -1)/(8 -1)=7/7=1. Then y=8*1 +1=9. So sum is 10. That&#39;s much worse.Alternatively, if a1=8, a2=7, b1=1, b2=8, then x=7/1=7, y=57. If we can get a larger x, that would be better, but since the maximum possible numerator (b2 -b1) is 7 and the minimal denominator (a1 -a2) is 1, x=7 is the maximum possible x-coordinate.But perhaps other pairs can give the same x but higher y. Wait, if we have the same x=7, but with a higher a1 and higher b1. For example, take a1=8, a2=7, b1=2, b2=9. Wait, but b2 can only go up to 8. So b2 -b1 is 8 -2=6. Then x=6/(8-7)=6, which is less than 7. Then y=8*6 +2=50. Sum is 56, which is less than 64.Alternatively, if a1=8, a2=7, b1=1, b2=8, we have x=7, y=57. If we take a1=8, a2=6, then the denominator is 2. So x=(b2 -b1)/2. To get x=7, we need (b2 -b1)=14, but since b2 and b1 are at most 8 and at least 1, maximum b2 -b1 is 7. So x=7/2=3.5. Then y=8*3.5 +b1. If b1=1, then y=28 +1=29. Sum is 3.5 +29=32.5, which is less than 64.So it seems that the maximum x we can get is 7, with a corresponding y of 57, giving a sum of 64. But let&#39;s check if there are intersection points with a higher sum even if x is not maximum.For example, suppose two lines intersect at a point where x is 6, but y is higher than 57. Let&#39;s see.If x=6, then for a line with a=8 and b=1, y=8*6 +1=49. If another line intersects it at x=6, then the other line must satisfy y= a2*6 + b2=49. So a2*6 + b2=49. Since a2 and b2 are between 1 and 8, let&#39;s see if such integers exist.6a2 + b2=49. The maximum 6a2 can be is 6*8=48, so b2=1. Then 6*8 +1=49. So yes, a2=8, b2=1. But wait, then the two lines are y=8x +1 and y=8x +1, which are the same line, not allowed. So they have to be different lines. So the other line would need a different slope. Wait, but if we take a2=7, then 6*7 +b2=42 +b2=49, so b2=7. So line y=7x +7. So lines y=8x +1 and y=7x +7 intersect at x= (7 -1)/(8 -7)=6/1=6, y=8*6 +1=49. So that&#39;s valid. Then the point is (6,49), sum 55. Which is less than 64.Alternatively, take x=5. Let&#39;s see. If we have lines intersecting at x=5. Then y= a1*5 + b1 = a2*5 + b2. So (a1 -a2)*5 = b2 -b1. So 5 divides (b2 -b1). Since b2 and b1 are between 1-8, the difference can be at most 7. So possible only if b2 -b1=5 or -5. So possible cases:Case 1: b2 -b1=5. Then (a1 -a2)=1. So a1 = a2 +1. So possible a2 from 1 to 7, a1 from 2 to 8. Then x=5, y= a1*5 +b1. Let&#39;s take a1=8, a2=7. Then b2 -b1=5. So if b1=3, then b2=8. Then line1: y=8x +3, line2: y=7x +8. Intersect at x= (8 -3)/(8 -7)=5. Then y=8*5 +3=43. Sum x+y=5+43=48.Alternatively, if a1=5, a2=4, b2 -b1=5. Then b1=3, b2=8. Then x=5, y=5*5 +3=28. Sum=33. So the maximum at x=5 is 48, still less than 64.Alternatively, maybe intersections where the sum x + y is higher even if x is smaller. Let&#39;s think of two lines that cross high up but not too far to the right.For example, take two lines with high slopes and high intercepts. Suppose we have line1: y=8x +8 and line2: y=7x +8. Then their intersection is at x=(8 -8)/(8 -7)=0/1=0. Then y=8. Sum is 8. Not helpful.Alternatively, line1: y=8x +8, line2: y=1x +8. Intersection at x=(8 -8)/(8 -1)=0/7=0. y=8. Same.Alternatively, line1: y=8x +1 and line2: y=7x +2. Intersection at x=(2 -1)/(8 -7)=1/1=1. y=8*1 +1=9. Sum=10.Alternatively, line1: y=8x +1 and line2: y=1x +8. Intersection at x=(8 -1)/(8 -1)=7/7=1. y=8*1 +1=9. Sum=10.Wait, maybe lines with higher intercepts. Let&#39;s take line1: y=2x +8 and line2: y=1x +8. Intersection at x=(8 -8)/(2 -1)=0/1=0. y=8. Not helpful.Alternatively, line1: y=3x +7 and line2: y=2x +8. Then x=(8 -7)/(3 -2)=1/1=1. y=3*1 +7=10. Sum=11.Alternatively, line1: y=7x +1 and line2: y=1x +8. Intersection at x=(8 -1)/(7 -1)=7/6≈1.166..., y≈7*(7/6)+1≈49/6 +1≈55/6≈9.166. Sum≈10.333. Still low.Hmm, seems like the intersection points with large x tend to have higher sums. Let&#39;s check another case. Suppose two lines with a1 -a2=1 and b2 -b1=7. As before, which gives x=7. The maximum possible x. Then, depending on a1 and b1, y can be different.Wait, earlier we took a1=8, a2=7, b1=1, b2=8. That gives x=7, y=57. But if we take a1=7, a2=6, then to get b2 -b1=7, we need b2=8, b1=1. Then x=7/(7-6)=7. Then y=7*7 +1=50. Sum=57. Which is less than 64.Similarly, if a1=6, a2=5, then x=7/(6-5)=7, y=6*7 +1=43. Sum=50. So the higher a1 is, the higher the y value when x is fixed. Therefore, to maximize y at x=7, we should take the highest possible a1. Since a1 can be up to 8, so the case with a1=8, a2=7, b1=1, b2=8 gives the maximum y=57 at x=7.Therefore, the sum x+y=64. Now, is there any other intersection point where x+y is larger?Let me think. Suppose we take different a1 and a2 where a1 -a2 is not 1, but maybe 2, but then b2 -b1 would have to be higher to get the same x. Wait, x=(b2 -b1)/(a1 -a2). If a1 -a2=2, then to get x=7, we need b2 -b1=14. But since b&#39;s can only go up to 8, the maximum b2 -b1=7. So x=7/2=3.5. Then y= a1*3.5 +b1. Let&#39;s say a1=8, b1=1. Then y=28 +1=29. Sum=3.5+29=32.5. Not better.Alternatively, take a1 -a2=1, but b2 -b1=6. Then x=6/1=6. Then y=8*6 +1=49. Sum=55. Less than 64.Alternatively, take a1=8, a2=6, and b2 -b1= (a1 -a2)*x. If we want x=7, then b2 -b1=2*7=14, which is impossible. If we take x=3.5 as before, sum is low.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider intersections where the lines have different slopes but cross at a point where x is not necessarily the maximum, but x + y is higher.Suppose we have two lines with high slopes. For example, a1=8 and a2=7. Let&#39;s vary b1 and b2.Suppose we take a1=8, a2=7, b1=2, b2=9. But b2 can&#39;t be 9. So b2=8, b1=1. Then x=(8 -1)/(8 -7)=7, y=8*7 +1=57. Sum=64. Same as before.What if we take a1=8, a2=7, b1=1, b2=8. That&#39;s the same.Alternatively, take a1=8, a2=5. Then x=(b2 -b1)/(8 -5)=(b2 -b1)/3. To get a larger x, we need b2 -b1 as large as possible. Max 7, so x=7/3≈2.333. Then y=8*(7/3) +b1. If b1=1, y≈56/3 +1≈59/3≈19.666. Sum≈2.333 +19.666≈22. Not helpful.Alternatively, take a1=8, a2=7, b1=2, b2=9. Not allowed. Or b1=1, b2=8. That&#39;s our maximum.Alternatively, take a1=7, a2=5. Then x=(b2 -b1)/2. Max b2 -b1=7, so x=7/2=3.5. Then y=7*3.5 +b1. If b1=1, y=24.5 +1=25.5. Sum=3.5+25.5=29. Still low.Hmm. Maybe intersections that don&#39;t involve the steepest slopes? Let&#39;s see.Take a1=4, a2=3. Then x=(b2 -b1)/1. So x=b2 -b1. To maximize x, set b2=8, b1=1. x=7. Then y=4*7 +1=29. Sum=7+29=36. Less than 64.Alternatively, a1=5, a2=4. x=(b2 -b1)/1=7. y=5*7 +1=36. Sum=43. Still less.Wait, so even if we take a1=8, a2=7, and get x=7, y=57. If we take a1=8, a2=6, then x=(b2 -b1)/2. If b2 -b1=7, then x=3.5, y=8*3.5 +1=29. Sum=32.5. Not better.So, seems like the intersection at (7,57) with sum 64 is the maximum so far. Let&#39;s check if there are other pairs of lines with different a1 and a2 that can give a higher sum.Wait, what if two lines intersect where x is negative? But since we are looking for the sum x + y, which could be positive or negative. But with natural numbers a and b from 1 to 8, x might be negative if b2 - b1 and a1 - a2 have opposite signs.For example, take a1=1, a2=2, then a1 -a2= -1. Then x=(b2 -b1)/(-1). To get a positive x, b2 -b1 must be negative, i.e., b2 &lt; b1. Let&#39;s take b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(1 -8)/(-1)= (-7)/(-1)=7. Then y=1*7 +8=15. Sum x+y=22. Which is less than 64.Alternatively, a1=2, a2=3. Then a1 -a2=-1. Take b1=8, b2=1. x=(1 -8)/(-1)=7. y=2*7 +8=22. Sum=29. Still less.So even if x is positive in these cases, the sum is still lower than 64.Alternatively, take a1=1, a2=8. Then a1 -a2= -7. If b2=8, b1=1, x=(8 -1)/(-7)=7/-7=-1. Then y=1*(-1) +1=0. Sum=-1 +0=-1. Not helpful.So negative x&#39;s aren&#39;t useful here. So maybe all the intersection points with positive x come from cases where a1 &gt;a2 and b2 &gt;b1, or a1 &lt;a2 and b2 &lt;b1. But the sum x+y is maximized when both x and y are maximized, which seems to occur when x is as large as possible and a1 is as large as possible.So, going back, the maximum x is 7, achieved when a1 -a2=1 and b2 -b1=7. Then, to maximize y, which is a1*x + b1, we need the largest possible a1 and the smallest possible b1 (since x=7, a1=8, b1=1 gives y=57, whereas a1=7, b1=1 gives y=50, which is lower). So, indeed, the maximum y at x=7 is achieved when a1 is maximum (8) and b1 is minimum (1), with a2=7 and b2=8.Therefore, the intersection point is (7,57), sum 64. Let me check if there are any other intersection points with a different combination that might result in a higher sum.Suppose we take two lines with different slopes where the sum x + y is higher. Let&#39;s suppose that x is not 7, but a smaller number, but y is higher. For example, could we have y higher than 57 at some x?But y = a1x + b1. If x is smaller, but a1 is very large, could that compensate? Let&#39;s see. For example, take x=6. If a1=8, b1=8, then y=8*6 +8=56. Sum=6+56=62. Less than 64.If x=5, a1=8, b1=8, y=48 +8=56. Sum=5+56=61.Alternatively, take x=4, a1=8, b1=8, y=32 +8=40. Sum=44.Alternatively, take a1=8, b1=7. Then at x=7, y=8*7 +7=63. Wait, but how do we get x=7? For that, we need another line intersecting it at x=7.So, line1: y=8x +7. What line intersects it at x=7?Suppose line2 has slope a2 and intercept b2. Then at x=7, 8*7 +7 = a2*7 + b2 =&gt; 63 =7a2 + b2. So 7a2 + b2=63. But a2 and b2 are natural numbers from 1 to8. Let&#39;s see:7a2 + b2=63. Let&#39;s solve for a2 and b2. Since a2 ≤8, 7a2 ≤56, so 63 -7a2 ≥7. But b2 must be ≤8. 63 -7a2 ≤8 =&gt;7a2 ≥55 =&gt;a2 ≥55/7≈7.857. So a2=8. Then b2=63 -56=7. So line2: y=8x +7. But that&#39;s the same as line1. So not allowed.Therefore, there is no other line with a different slope that intersects line1 at x=7. Hence, the point (7,63) is not an intersection of two distinct lines.Alternatively, line2 could have a different slope. For example, let&#39;s take a2=7. Then 7*7 + b2=63 =&gt;49 +b2=63 =&gt;b2=14. But b2 can&#39;t exceed 8. Not possible. Similarly, a2=6: 42 +b2=63 =&gt;b2=21. Not possible. So no solution.Therefore, the maximum y at x=7 is 57, from line1:y=8x +1 and line2:y=7x +8.Alternatively, if we take line1:y=8x +2 and line2 with a2=7. Then solving 8x +2=7x +b2. Then x= b2 -2. To get x as large as possible, set b2=8, then x=6. Then y=8*6 +2=50. Sum=56. Less than 64.Alternatively, line1:y=8x +1 and line2:y=6x +b2. Intersection at x=(b2 -1)/(8 -6)=(b2 -1)/2. To maximize x, set b2=8. Then x=(8 -1)/2=3.5. y=8*3.5 +1=29. Sum=3.5 +29=32.5.No, that&#39;s worse.Wait, maybe another combination. Let&#39;s take two lines with a1=7 and a2=5. Then x=(b2 -b1)/(7 -5)=(b2 -b1)/2. To maximize x, set b2 -b1=7, so x=7/2=3.5. Then y=7*3.5 +b1. If b1=1, then y=24.5 +1=25.5. Sum=3.5+25.5=29.Still low.Alternatively, take a1=8, a2=7, b1=2, b2=9. But b2=9 is invalid. So b2=8, b1=1 is the maximum difference.Alternatively, take a1=8, a2=7, b1=1, b2=8, which we already know.Is there a case where two lines with a larger difference in slopes can produce a higher sum?Wait, take a1=8, a2=1. Then x=(b2 -b1)/(8 -1)=(b2 -b1)/7. To maximize x, set b2 -b1=7, so x=1. Then y=8*1 +b1. If b1=1, then y=9. Sum=1+9=10. If b1=2, y=10. Sum=12. Still low.Alternatively, if a1=8, a2=2. Then x=(b2 -b1)/6. Max x=7/6≈1.166. y≈8*(7/6)+b1≈9.333 +b1. If b1=1, y≈10.333. Sum≈1.166 +10.333≈11.499. Still low.Alternatively, a1=8, a2=3. x=(b2 -b1)/5. Max x=7/5=1.4. y=8*1.4 +b1=11.2 +b1. If b1=1, sum=1.4 +12.2=13.6. Still low.So, no. The maximum sum seems to indeed be 64 at (7,57).But let me check other pairs where a1 -a2=1 and b2 -b1=7 but different a1 and a2.Wait, if a1=7, a2=6, then b2 -b1=7. So b2=8, b1=1. Then x=7/(7-6)=7. Then y=7*7 +1=50. Sum=57. Less than 64.Similarly, a1=6, a2=5: x=7/(6-5)=7. y=6*7 +1=43. Sum=50. Even less.Therefore, the higher a1 is, the higher the y at x=7. Thus, a1=8 gives the highest possible y=57.Therefore, unless there is a different combination where x is not 7, but the sum x + y is higher, which I haven&#39;t found yet, this must be the answer.Wait, let&#39;s consider other pairs where a1 -a2 is not 1, but maybe a1 -a2=2 and b2 -b1=7. Then x=7/2=3.5. Then y= a1*3.5 +b1. If a1=8, then y=28 +b1. To maximize y, set b1=8: y=28 +8=36. Sum=3.5+36=39.5. Not better.Alternatively, a1 -a2=3, x=7/3≈2.333. y=8*2.333 +b1≈18.666 +b1. If b1=8, y≈26.666. Sum≈2.333 +26.666≈29. Still low.Alternatively, a1 -a2=4, x=7/4=1.75. y=8*1.75 +b1=14 +b1. If b1=8, y=22. Sum=1.75 +22=23.75.No, still low.Alternatively, take a1=5, a2=3. Then x=(b2 -b1)/2. Max x=7/2=3.5. Then y=5*3.5 +b1=17.5 +b1. If b1=1, y=18.5. Sum=3.5 +18.5=22. Not helpful.Alternatively, take a1=4, a2=1. Then x=(b2 -b1)/3. Max x=7/3≈2.333. y=4*2.333 +b1≈9.333 +b1. If b1=1, sum≈2.333 +10.333≈12.666.Still low.Alternatively, take two lines where the difference in intercepts is negative but the difference in slopes is also negative. For example, a1=7, a2=8, and b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(1 -8)/(7 -8)= (-7)/(-1)=7. y=7*7 +8=57. So same point (7,57). So actually, whether a1 &gt;a2 or a2 &gt;a1, we can get the same intersection point. Because if we reverse the lines, the intersection remains the same.Thus, another way to get (7,57) is lines y=7x +8 and y=8x +1. Solving: 7x +8=8x +1 =&gt;x=7, y=57.Therefore, the same point is obtained regardless of the order.Therefore, regardless of how we pair them, the maximum sum is 64 at (7,57).Is there any other intersection point that can have a higher sum?Wait, let&#39;s try to think of two lines where one has a very high intercept and a low slope, and the other has a high slope and low intercept. Maybe they intersect somewhere in the middle with a high sum.For example, take line1: y=8x +1 (steep slope, low intercept) and line2: y=1x +8 (shallow slope, high intercept). Their intersection is at x=(8 -1)/(8 -1)=7/7=1. y=8*1 +1=9. Sum=1+9=10. Not helpful.Another example: line1: y=7x +2 and line2: y=2x +7. Intersect at x=(7 -2)/(7 -2)=5/5=1. y=7*1 +2=9. Sum=10. Same.Alternatively, line1: y=6x +3 and line2: y=3x +6. Intersection at x=(6 -3)/(6 -3)=3/3=1. y=6*1 +3=9. Sum=10.Same result. Seems like these symmetric lines intersect at (1,9).Alternatively, take line1: y=5x +4 and line2: y=4x +5. Intersection at x=(5 -4)/(5 -4)=1/1=1. y=5*1 +4=9. Sum=10.So, regardless of the slopes and intercepts in these symmetric cases, the intersection is at (1,9).Not helpful for our maximum.Alternatively, take line1: y=8x +8 and line2: y=7x +8. They are parallel? No, slopes are different. Wait, solving 8x +8=7x +8 =&gt;x=0. y=8. Sum=8.Alternatively, line1: y=8x +7 and line2: y=7x +8. Intersection at x=(8 -7)/(8 -7)=1/1=1. y=8*1 +7=15. Sum=1+15=16.Not great.Alternatively, line1: y=8x +6 and line2: y=6x +8. Intersect at x=(8 -6)/(8 -6)=2/2=1. y=8*1 +6=14. Sum=15.Still low.Hmm. It seems that all these intersections near the lower x values have low sums. The maximum really does seem to be at x=7, with sum 64.Wait, let me check another case where a1=8, a2= something else, and b1 and b2 are different.For example, line1: y=8x +1 and line2: y=5x +b2. Let&#39;s find their intersection.8x +1 =5x +b2 =&gt;3x =b2 -1 =&gt;x=(b2 -1)/3. To maximize x, set b2=8. Then x=(8 -1)/3=7/3≈2.333. y=8*(7/3)+1≈56/3 +1≈59/3≈19.666. Sum≈2.333 +19.666≈22. Not helpful.Alternatively, line1:y=8x +1 and line2:y=4x +b2. Intersection:8x +1=4x +b2 =&gt;4x =b2 -1 =&gt;x=(b2 -1)/4. Max x=(8 -1)/4=7/4=1.75. y≈14 +1=15. Sum≈1.75 +15=16.75.No.Alternatively, line1:y=8x +1 and line2:y=3x +b2. Intersection at x=(b2 -1)/5. Max x=7/5=1.4. y≈11.2 +1=12.2. Sum≈1.4 +12.2≈13.6.No.Alternatively, line1:y=8x +1 and line2:y=2x +b2. Intersection at x=(b2 -1)/6. Max x=7/6≈1.166. y≈9.333 +1=10.333. Sum≈1.166 +10.333≈11.5.Still low.So, all these other combinations don&#39;t give a higher sum.Therefore, after checking various possibilities, the maximum sum of coordinates at an intersection point is indeed 64, achieved at the point (7,57). This occurs when the lines y=8x +1 and y=7x +8 intersect. Let me confirm once more:For lines y=8x +1 and y=7x +8:Set 8x +1 =7x +8 ⇒x=7. Then y=8*7 +1=57. So (7,57). Sum 7+57=64.Yes, that&#39;s correct.I don&#39;t see any other combination of lines that would result in a higher sum. Therefore, the answer should be (7;57).Final AnswerThe point with the greatest sum of coordinates is boxed{(7; 57)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the intersection point with the greatest sum of coordinates among lines of the form ( y = ax + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are natural numbers from 1 to 8, we need to consider the intersection points of these lines. 1. Finding Intersection Points:   - For two lines ( y = a_1x + b_1 ) and ( y = a_2x + b_2 ), the intersection point is found by solving:     [     a_1x + b_1 = a_2x + b_2     ]   - Solving for ( x ):     [     x = frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_1 - a_2}     ]   - Substituting ( x ) back into one of the equations gives ( y ):     [     y = a_1 left( frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_1 - a_2} right) + b_1     ]2. Maximizing the Sum ( x + y ):   - To maximize ( x + y ), we need both ( x ) and ( y ) to be as large as possible.   - The maximum value of ( x ) occurs when the numerator ( b_2 - b_1 ) is maximized and the denominator ( a_1 - a_2 ) is minimized. The maximum difference for ( b_2 - b_1 ) is 7 (when ( b_2 = 8 ) and ( b_1 = 1 )), and the minimum difference for ( a_1 - a_2 ) is 1 (when ( a_1 = 8 ) and ( a_2 = 7 )).   - Substituting these values:     [     x = frac{8 - 1}{8 - 7} = 7     ]     [     y = 8 cdot 7 + 1 = 57     ]   - The sum ( x + y = 7 + 57 = 64 ).3. Verification:   - Checking other possible combinations of slopes and intercepts confirms that no other intersection point results in a higher sum than 64.Thus, the point with the greatest sum of coordinates is (boxed{(7; 57)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about finding the intersection point with the greatest sum of coordinates (x + y) among all lines of the form y = ax + b, where a and b are natural numbers from 1 to 8. Hmm, interesting. So first, I need to understand how these lines intersect and how their intersection points&#39; coordinates contribute to the sum.First, let me recall that two lines y = a1x + b1 and y = a2x + b2 will intersect if their slopes a1 and a2 are different. The intersection point can be found by setting the two equations equal: a1x + b1 = a2x + b2. Solving for x gives x = (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2). Then substituting back into one of the equations gives y = a1*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1. So both x and y coordinates of the intersection point depend on the values of a1, a2, b1, b2.Since a and b are natural numbers from 1 to 8, the slopes a1 and a2 can range from 1 to 8, but they must be different for the lines to intersect. Similarly, the intercepts b1 and b2 can also range from 1 to 8, and they can be the same or different. Wait, but if two lines have the same slope, they are parallel and don&#39;t intersect. So only lines with different slopes can intersect, right. So all intersection points come from pairs of lines with different slopes.Now, the goal is to find the intersection point where x + y is maximized. So I need to find the maximum possible value of x + y, where x and y are coordinates given by the formulas above. Let me write those expressions again:For two lines y = a1x + b1 and y = a2x + b2, the intersection point is:x = (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2)y = a1*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1Alternatively, since a1 ≠ a2, we can write it as x = (b1 - b2)/(a2 - a1) and y = a2*(b1 - b2)/(a2 - a1) + b2. Maybe this is better to avoid negative denominators. Let&#39;s see:x = (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) = (b1 - b2)/(a2 - a1)Similarly, y can be expressed as:y = a1*x + b1 = a1*(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + b1 = [a1(b2 - b1) + b1(a1 - a2)] / (a1 - a2) = [a1b2 - a1b1 + a1b1 - a2b1] / (a1 - a2) = (a1b2 - a2b1)/(a1 - a2)Alternatively, the same as (a2b1 - a1b2)/(a2 - a1). So, either way, the y-coordinate is (a1b2 - a2b1)/(a1 - a2).So, both x and y are fractions. The sum x + y would be [(b2 - b1) + (a1b2 - a2b1)] / (a1 - a2). Let me check that:x + y = (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2) + (a1b2 - a2b1)/(a1 - a2) = [ (b2 - b1) + (a1b2 - a2b1) ] / (a1 - a2 )Combine terms:= [ (1 + a1)b2 - (1 + a2)b1 ] / (a1 - a2 )Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe it&#39;s better to think of x + y in terms of the expressions for x and y. Let&#39;s denote S = x + y. Then S = x + y = x + (a1x + b1) = x(1 + a1) + b1. Similarly, S = x + (a2x + b2) = x(1 + a2) + b2. But since both expressions equal S, perhaps equating them?Wait, but x is the same in both. So actually, since x is fixed for the intersection point, S = x + y can be calculated either way. But maybe expressing S in terms of a1, a2, b1, b2:From x = (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2)So S = x + y = x + a1x + b1 = x(1 + a1) + b1Substituting x:S = [(b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2)] * (1 + a1) + b1Similarly, we can write:= [(b2 - b1)(1 + a1) + b1(a1 - a2)] / (a1 - a2)= [ (b2 - b1)(1 + a1) + b1a1 - b1a2 ] / (a1 - a2 )Expanding (b2 - b1)(1 + a1):= b2(1 + a1) - b1(1 + a1) + b1a1 - b1a2= b2(1 + a1) - b1 - b1a1 + b1a1 - b1a2Simplify terms:- b1 - b1a1 + b1a1 cancels to -b1So:= b2(1 + a1) - b1 - b1a2Factor:= b2(1 + a1) - b1(1 + a2)Therefore, S = [b2(1 + a1) - b1(1 + a2)] / (a1 - a2 )Hmm, that&#39;s an interesting expression. So S is [b2(1 + a1) - b1(1 + a2)] divided by (a1 - a2). Maybe this is useful. Let me see if I can factor or rearrange this.Alternatively, note that the denominator is (a1 - a2) = -(a2 - a1). So if I factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: b2(1 + a1) - b1(1 + a2) = b2 + b2a1 - b1 - b1a2 = (b2 - b1) + a1b2 - a2b1Denominator: a1 - a2So S = [ (b2 - b1) + a1b2 - a2b1 ] / (a1 - a2 )But this seems like going in circles. Maybe let&#39;s consider that S is a function of a1, a2, b1, b2, and we need to maximize S given that a1, a2, b1, b2 are integers from 1 to 8, with a1 ≠ a2.Alternatively, perhaps instead of working with general expressions, think of how to maximize x + y. Since x and y are coordinates of intersection points, and both x and y could be positive or negative, but given that all lines have positive slopes (since a is from 1 to 8) and positive intercepts (b from 1 to 8), all lines are going upwards and intersect the y-axis above the origin. Therefore, their intersection points might lie in the first quadrant, but not necessarily. Wait, actually, two lines with positive slopes and positive intercepts will intersect in the first quadrant only if one has a steeper slope and a lower intercept, or vice versa?Wait, let&#39;s take two lines. Suppose line 1 has a smaller slope a1 and a larger intercept b1, and line 2 has a larger slope a2 and a smaller intercept b2. Then their intersection point would be where the line with the steeper slope (a2) starts below the other line (since b2 &lt; b1) but catches up due to the steeper slope, resulting in an intersection in the first quadrant. Conversely, if a line has both a larger slope and a larger intercept, it might never intersect the other line in the first quadrant? Wait, actually, two lines with positive slopes will always intersect unless they are parallel. So even if both have larger slopes and larger intercepts, they will intersect somewhere. Let me check with an example.Take line1: y = 1x + 1 (a1=1, b1=1)Line2: y = 2x + 2 (a2=2, b2=2)Solving for x: x + 1 = 2x + 2 ⇒ -x = 1 ⇒ x = -1, y = 0. So intersection at (-1, 0), which is not in the first quadrant. So even with both a and b increasing, the intersection point is in the second quadrant.So to have an intersection in the first quadrant, the lines need to satisfy certain conditions. For example, if a2 &gt; a1, then for the lines to intersect in the first quadrant, it&#39;s necessary that b2 &lt; b1. Because if a2 &gt; a1 and b2 &lt; b1, then the steeper line starts lower and crosses the flatter line in the first quadrant. Similarly, if a2 &lt; a1 and b2 &gt; b1, the steeper line is the first one with a1, but since a2 is smaller, actually, no. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for x.Given two lines y = a1x + b1 and y = a2x + b2, the x-coordinate of the intersection is x = (b2 - b1)/(a1 - a2). For x to be positive (so that the intersection is in the first quadrant), the numerator and denominator must have the same sign. So:Case 1: (b2 - b1) &gt; 0 and (a1 - a2) &gt; 0 ⇒ b2 &gt; b1 and a1 &gt; a2Case 2: (b2 - b1) &lt; 0 and (a1 - a2) &lt; 0 ⇒ b2 &lt; b1 and a1 &lt; a2So in either case, if the line with the larger a (steeper slope) has the smaller b (intercept), then their intersection is in the first quadrant. So to have an intersection point in the first quadrant, the steeper line must have a smaller intercept. That&#39;s a key point.Therefore, if we want intersection points in the first quadrant (where x and y are positive), we need pairs of lines where one has a higher slope but lower intercept, and the other has a lower slope but higher intercept.Since we are looking to maximize x + y, it&#39;s likely that the maximum occurs in the first quadrant because both x and y would be positive, contributing to a larger sum. If the intersection is in another quadrant, either x or y would be negative, which would reduce the sum. So maybe we can focus only on intersection points in the first quadrant. But to be thorough, perhaps we should check if any intersection points outside the first quadrant could have a higher sum. However, considering that lines have positive slopes and positive intercepts, their intersections in other quadrants would have either x or y negative. For example, in the second quadrant (x negative, y positive) or fourth quadrant (x positive, y negative). But since y is determined by y = ax + b, with a and b positive, if x is negative, y could still be positive if the intercept b is large enough. But x negative and y positive would result in x + y being possibly positive but maybe not as large as when both are positive. Similarly, x positive and y negative would give a lower sum. So perhaps the maximum sum does occur in the first quadrant. So maybe focusing on first quadrant intersections is sufficient.Therefore, we can restrict our attention to pairs of lines where a2 &gt; a1 and b2 &lt; b1, or a1 &gt; a2 and b1 &lt; b2. So, pairs where the steeper line has a lower intercept.So now, the problem reduces to checking all such pairs and calculating their intersection points, then finding the one with the maximum x + y. However, since there are 8 choices for a1, 8 for a2 (with a1 ≠ a2), and 8 choices for b1, 8 for b2, this could be a lot of pairs. The total number of lines is 8*8 = 64 lines. The number of pairs of lines is C(64, 2) = 2016 pairs. But many of these pairs are parallel (same slope), so they don&#39;t intersect. The number of intersecting pairs is 2016 minus the number of parallel pairs. The number of parallel pairs: for each slope a (from 1 to 8), there are C(8, 2) pairs of lines with that slope. So 8*C(8,2) = 8*28 = 224 parallel pairs. Therefore, the number of intersecting pairs is 2016 - 224 = 1792 pairs. That&#39;s still a lot. Obviously, we can&#39;t check all of them manually, so we need a smarter approach.But maybe instead of considering all possible pairs, we can find the maximum possible x + y by analyzing the expressions for x and y. Let&#39;s recall that S = x + y = x + (a1x + b1) = x(1 + a1) + b1. So S is linear in x. Therefore, to maximize S, we need to maximize x, given that x is positive (since we&#39;re in the first quadrant) and also that a1 is as large as possible? Wait, but S is x(1 + a1) + b1. So if x is large and a1 is large, S can be very large. However, x is constrained by the intersection with another line.Alternatively, consider that for two lines with slopes a1 and a2 (a2 &gt; a1) and intercepts b1 and b2 (b1 &gt; b2), their intersection x is (b1 - b2)/(a2 - a1). Then y = a1x + b1. So S = x + y = x(1 + a1) + b1. Since x = (b1 - b2)/(a2 - a1), substituting gives S = [(b1 - b2)/(a2 - a1)]*(1 + a1) + b1.So S = [ (b1 - b2)(1 + a1) ] / (a2 - a1) + b1Let me see if this can be rewritten:= [ (b1 - b2)(1 + a1) + b1(a2 - a1) ] / (a2 - a1 )= [ (b1 - b2)(1 + a1) + b1a2 - b1a1 ] / (a2 - a1 )Expand the first term:= [ b1(1 + a1) - b2(1 + a1) + b1a2 - b1a1 ] / (a2 - a1 )Simplify:= [ b1 + b1a1 - b2 - b2a1 + b1a2 - b1a1 ] / (a2 - a1 )The b1a1 and -b1a1 cancel:= [ b1 - b2 - b2a1 + b1a2 ] / (a2 - a1 )Factor terms with b1 and b2:= [ b1(1 + a2) - b2(1 + a1) ] / (a2 - a1 )Interesting. So S is [ b1(1 + a2) - b2(1 + a1) ] / (a2 - a1 )Alternatively, since a2 &gt; a1 (because we&#39;re considering pairs where a2 &gt; a1 and b1 &gt; b2 for first quadrant intersection), denominator is positive. So S is [ b1(1 + a2) - b2(1 + a1) ] divided by (a2 - a1). To maximize S, we need to maximize the numerator and minimize the denominator.The denominator (a2 - a1) is positive, so to maximize S, we need to maximize the numerator [ b1(1 + a2) - b2(1 + a1) ] and minimize (a2 - a1). But this is a bit conflicting. Let&#39;s see:If we can maximize the numerator while keeping the denominator small, that would give a larger S. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s denote a2 - a1 = d, where d is a positive integer from 1 to 7 (since a1 and a2 are from 1 to 8, and a2 &gt; a1). Then, the denominator is d. The numerator is b1(1 + a1 + d) - b2(1 + a1) = b1(1 + a1) + b1d - b2(1 + a1) = (1 + a1)(b1 - b2) + b1d.Hmm. Since b1 &gt; b2 (because we are in the first quadrant case), (1 + a1)(b1 - b2) is positive. Additionally, b1d is positive. So the numerator is a sum of two positive terms. To maximize the numerator, we need to maximize both (1 + a1)(b1 - b2) and b1d. To maximize (1 + a1)(b1 - b2), we need a1 as large as possible, and (b1 - b2) as large as possible. To maximize b1d, since d = a2 - a1, we need d as large as possible and b1 as large as possible.But these two components are somewhat conflicting. If we take a larger d (i.e., a2 much larger than a1), then d is large, but a1 is smaller, which may reduce the (1 + a1) term. Alternatively, if we take a1 large, then d must be at least 1, but (1 + a1) is large. So perhaps there is a balance here.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about specific values. Since all parameters are integers from 1 to 8, let&#39;s consider possible maximums.First, let&#39;s note that b1 and b2 can vary from 1 to 8, with b1 &gt; b2. So maximum b1 - b2 is 8 - 1 = 7 when b1=8 and b2=1. Similarly, a1 and a2 can vary with a2 &gt; a1, so a2 - a1 can be from 1 to 7.Suppose we take d = 1 (smallest possible denominator). Then, the denominator is 1, so S is simply the numerator. Let&#39;s see: if d=1, then a2 = a1 + 1. Then, numerator is [ b1(1 + a2) - b2(1 + a1) ] = [ b1(1 + a1 +1 ) - b2(1 + a1) ] = [ b1(a1 + 2) - b2(a1 + 1) ]To maximize this, since d is 1, we need to maximize [ b1(a1 + 2) - b2(a1 + 1) ] with a1 from 1 to 7 (since a2 = a1 +1 ≤8), b1 from 1 to 8, b2 from 1 to b1-1.Let&#39;s fix a1 and try to find the maximum for each a1.For example, take a1=7, then a2=8. Then the numerator becomes b1(7 + 2) - b2(7 + 1) = 9b1 - 8b2. To maximize this, with b1=8 and b2=1, gives 9*8 -8*1 =72 -8=64. So S=64 /1=64.Similarly, for a1=6, a2=7. Numerator: 8b1 -7b2. Max when b1=8, b2=1: 8*8 -7*1=64-7=57. S=57/1=57.a1=5, a2=6: 7b1 -6b2. Max at 7*8 -6*1=56 -6=50. S=50.a1=4, a2=5:6b1 -5b2. Max 6*8 -5*1=48-5=43. S=43.a1=3, a2=4:5b1 -4b2. Max 5*8 -4*1=40-4=36. S=36.a1=2, a2=3:4b1 -3b2. Max 4*8 -3*1=32 -3=29. S=29.a1=1, a2=2:3b1 -2b2. Max 3*8 -2*1=24-2=22. S=22.So for d=1, the maximum S is 64 when a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1.Now, let&#39;s check for d=2. Then a2 = a1 +2. So denominator=2. The numerator is [ b1(1 + a1 +2) - b2(1 + a1) ] = [ b1(a1 +3) - b2(a1 +1) ].So for each a1 from 1 to 6:a1=6, a2=8: numerator= b1(6+3) -b2(6+1)=9b1 -7b2. Max with b1=8, b2=1:9*8 -7*1=72-7=65. Then S=65/2=32.5a1=5, a2=7: numerator=8b1 -6b2. Max 8*8 -6*1=64-6=58. S=58/2=29.a1=4, a2=6:7b1 -5b2. Max 7*8 -5*1=56 -5=51. S=51/2=25.5a1=3, a2=5:6b1 -4b2. Max 6*8 -4*1=48 -4=44. S=44/2=22a1=2, a2=4:5b1 -3b2. Max 5*8 -3*1=40 -3=37. S=37/2=18.5a1=1, a2=3:4b1 -2b2. Max 4*8 -2*1=32 -2=30. S=30/2=15So here, the maximum S for d=2 is 32.5, which is less than the 64 for d=1. So not better.For d=3: denominator=3. Then a2 =a1 +3.Numerator: [b1(a1 +4) -b2(a1 +1)]So:a1=5, a2=8: numerator=9b1 -6b2. Max 9*8 -6*1=72-6=66. S=66/3=22.a1=4, a2=7:8b1 -5b2. Max 8*8 -5*1=64-5=59. S=59/3≈19.67a1=3, a2=6:7b1 -4b2. Max 7*8 -4*1=56-4=52. S=52/3≈17.33a1=2, a2=5:6b1 -3b2. Max 6*8 -3*1=48-3=45. S=45/3=15a1=1, a2=4:5b1 -2b2. Max 5*8 -2*1=40-2=38. S=38/3≈12.67Maximum S here is 22, still less than 64.d=4: denominator=4. a2=a1 +4.Numerator: [b1(a1 +5) -b2(a1 +1)]a1=4, a2=8:9b1 -5b2. Max 9*8 -5*1=72-5=67. S=67/4≈16.75a1=3, a2=7:8b1 -4b2. Max 8*8 -4*1=64-4=60. S=60/4=15a1=2, a2=6:7b1 -3b2. Max 7*8 -3*1=56-3=53. S=53/4≈13.25a1=1, a2=5:6b1 -2b2. Max 6*8 -2*1=48-2=46. S=46/4=11.5Maximum S=16.75.d=5: denominator=5. a2=a1 +5.Numerator: [b1(a1 +6) -b2(a1 +1)]a1=3, a2=8:9b1 -4b2. Max 9*8 -4*1=72-4=68. S=68/5=13.6a1=2, a2=7:8b1 -3b2. Max 8*8 -3*1=64-3=61. S=61/5=12.2a1=1, a2=6:7b1 -2b2. Max 7*8 -2*1=56-2=54. S=54/5=10.8d=6: denominator=6. a2=a1 +6.Numerator: [b1(a1 +7) -b2(a1 +1)]a1=2, a2=8:9b1 -3b2. Max 9*8 -3*1=72-3=69. S=69/6=11.5a1=1, a2=7:8b1 -2b2. Max 8*8 -2*1=64-2=62. S=62/6≈10.33d=7: denominator=7. a2=a1 +7.Only possible a1=1, a2=8.Numerator: [b1(1+8) -b2(1+1)]=9b1 -2b2. Max 9*8 -2*1=72-2=70. S=70/7=10.So for all d from 1 to 7, the maximum S occurs at d=1 with S=64. However, this is when a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1.But wait, S=64? Let me check that again.For a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1.x = (b1 - b2)/(a2 - a1) = (8 -1)/(8 -7)=7/1=7y = a1x + b1=7*7 +8=49 +8=57Therefore, x + y=7 +57=64. So that&#39;s correct.But is this the maximum possible? Let&#39;s check other possibilities where d is not minimal. For example, could there be a case where even though d is larger, the numerator is large enough to compensate?Wait, for instance, if d=1, the maximum S=64. For d=2, the maximum S was 32.5, which is half of that. So even if we have larger numerators for larger d, the denominator increases, which might not be compensated. For example, when d=2, the maximum numerator was 65, which divided by 2 gives 32.5. 65 is just slightly higher than 64, but divided by 2 it&#39;s lower. So, even if for some d&gt;1, the numerator is slightly larger, the division by a larger denominator would lead to a lower S.Similarly, when d=3, the maximum numerator was 66, which divided by 3 gives 22. So, not better.Therefore, it seems that the maximum S occurs when d=1, a2 - a1=1, and the numerator is maximized, which happens when a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. So that gives S=64.But wait, let&#39;s check if there are other pairs with different a1, a2, b1, b2 that could give a higher S.Suppose we take a1=6, a2=7, then b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(8 -1)/(7 -6)=7/1=7. Then y=6*7 +8=42 +8=50. S=7 +50=57. Which is less than 64.If we take a1=5, a2=6, b1=8, b2=1. x=(8-1)/(6-5)=7/1=7. y=5*7 +8=35 +8=43. S=7 +43=50. Also less.So, for the same b1=8 and b2=1, as a1 decreases and a2 decreases, keeping d=1, the S decreases because the slope a1 is smaller, leading to lower y.Alternatively, if we take different b1 and b2.For example, take a1=7, a2=8, but b1=7, b2=1. Then x=(7-1)/(8 -7)=6/1=6. y=7*6 +7=42 +7=49. S=6 +49=55, which is less than 64.If we take a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=2. Then x=(8 -2)/(8 -7)=6/1=6. y=7*6 +8=42 +8=50. S=6 +50=56. Still less.Similarly, if b2=1, but b1=7: x=6, y=49. S=55. So, only when b1=8 and b2=1 do we get the maximum S=64.Alternatively, if we take other pairs where d=1 but different a1 and a2.For example, a1=6, a2=7, b1=8, b2=2. Then x=(8 -2)/(7 -6)=6/1=6. y=6*6 +8=36 +8=44. S=6 +44=50.Less than 64.Alternatively, if we take a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1: x=7, y=57, sum 64.But let&#39;s check another case where the difference in b is larger. For example, take a1=1, a2=2, b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(8 -1)/(2 -1)=7/1=7. y=1*7 +8=15. S=7 +15=22. Much less.So, the key is to have the highest possible a1 and a2, with the largest possible b1 and smallest possible b2. Since a1 and a2 are adjacent (d=1), with a1=7, a2=8, and b1=8, b2=1, we get the maximum S.But wait, is there another pair with different a1 and a2 where S could be higher?Suppose we take a1=5, a2=8. Then d=3. Let&#39;s compute S here.But if a1=5, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(8 -1)/(8 -5)=7/3≈2.333. y=5*7/3 +8≈11.666 +8≈19.666. S≈2.333 +19.666≈22. Not better.Alternatively, take a1=7, a2=8, but with different b1 and b2. Suppose b1=8, b2=2. Then x=(8 -2)/(8 -7)=6/1=6. y=7*6 +8=42 +8=50. S=56. Still less than 64.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Maybe instead of varying a1 and a2 with d=1, consider pairs with different differences in slopes but with higher contributions from b1 and b2.Alternatively, what if we take a1=1 and a2=8, with b1=8 and b2=1. Then x=(8 -1)/(8 -1)=7/7=1. y=1*1 +8=9. S=1 +9=10. Not great.Alternatively, take a1=2, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. x=(8 -1)/(8 -2)=7/6≈1.166. y=2*(7/6)+8≈2.333 +8≈10.333. S≈11.5.Still worse. So, the maximum seems indeed to occur at a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1 with S=64.But wait, let&#39;s check another possibility where a1 and a2 are not adjacent. For example, take a1=6, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1.x=(8 -1)/(8 -6)=7/2=3.5. y=6*3.5 +8=21 +8=29. S=3.5 +29=32.5. Which is less than 64.Alternatively, a1=5, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. x=7/3≈2.333, y=5*2.333 +8≈11.666 +8=19.666. S≈22.Still lower.Alternatively, take a1=7, a2=8, but with b1=7, b2=1. Then x=(7 -1)/(8 -7)=6/1=6. y=7*6 +7=42 +7=49. S=55. Less than 64.Alternatively, a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=2. x=(8 -2)/(8 -7)=6/1=6. y=7*6 +8=42 +8=50. S=56.Still less. So the maximum S=64 occurs when a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. Therefore, the intersection point is at x=7, y=57, giving the sum 64.But wait, before confirming, let&#39;s see if there are any other pairs with different a1, a2, b1, b2 where S could be higher. For instance, take a1=7, a2=8, but with b1=8 and b2=0. But wait, b must be at least 1, so b2=1 is the minimum. So that&#39;s already considered.Alternatively, if we take a1=8, but a1 can only go up to 8. Since a2 must be greater than a1, but a1=8, there is no a2. So the maximum a1 is 7 when paired with a2=8.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a pair where slopes are not adjacent but b1 and b2 are different. Wait, but even if a1 and a2 are not adjacent, the maximum S seems lower. For example, take a1=5, a2=7, b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(8-1)/(7-5)=7/2=3.5. y=5*3.5 +8=17.5 +8=25.5. S=3.5 +25.5=29. Not better.Alternatively, a1=4, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. x=7/4=1.75, y=4*1.75 +8=7 +8=15. S=1.75 +15=16.75.No. Not better.Alternatively, if b1 and b2 are not at their extremes. For example, take a1=7, a2=8, b1=7, b2=2. Then x=(7 -2)/(8 -7)=5/1=5. y=7*5 +7=35 +7=42. S=5 +42=47. Still less than 64.Alternatively, a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=3. x=(8 -3)/(8 -7)=5/1=5. y=7*5 +8=35 +8=43. S=5 +43=48. Still less.So even if we take other b1 and b2, as long as a1=7, a2=8, the maximum S occurs when b1 is maximum (8) and b2 is minimum (1). Therefore, the intersection point (7,57) gives the sum 64.But hold on, let&#39;s check another case where two lines intersect with different a1, a2, but higher b1 and lower b2. For example, take a1=6, a2=7, b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(8-1)/(7-6)=7/1=7. y=6*7 +8=42 +8=50. S=57. Still less than 64.Alternatively, take a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. S=64.Is there a pair of lines where the intersection point gives a higher sum? For example, maybe lines with different slopes where x is very large. But given that a and b are up to 8, perhaps the x-coordinate can&#39;t be too large. For instance, if two lines have a very small difference in slopes, the denominator (a1 - a2) is small, making x large. But since a1 and a2 are integers, the smallest possible denominator is 1 (when slopes differ by 1). So the maximum x is (b1 - b2)/1 = b1 - b2. To maximize x, we need b1 - b2 to be as large as possible, which is 8 -1 =7. So x=7, which is the case we already considered. Therefore, x cannot be larger than 7 in the first quadrant.Therefore, the intersection at x=7 is the maximum possible x-coordinate. Then y is calculated as a1x + b1=7*7 +8=57, which gives the sum 64. Since x can&#39;t be larger than 7, and with x=7, y=57, which is already quite large, it&#39;s unlikely there&#39;s a higher sum.But just to make sure, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another intersection point where x is not maximum, but y is very large, leading to a higher sum. For example, suppose two lines intersect at a lower x but a very high y.For example, take a1=1, a2=2, b1=8, b2=1. Then x=(8-1)/(2 -1)=7/1=7. y=1*7 +8=15. S=22. Not better.Alternatively, take a1=1, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1. x=(8 -1)/(8 -1)=1. y=1*1 +8=9. S=10. No.Alternatively, take a1=2, a2=3, b1=8, b2=1. x=(8 -1)/(3 -2)=7/1=7. y=2*7 +8=22. S=29.Still less than 64.Alternatively, take two lines that cross at a high y but moderate x. For example, take a1=1, b1=8, and a2=8, b2=8. Wait, but these lines are parallel? No, a1=1, a2=8, different slopes. But b2=8, same as b1=8. Then x=(8 -8)/(1 -8)=0/(-7)=0. y=1*0 +8=8. So intersection at (0,8). Sum is 0 +8=8. Not better.Alternatively, take a1=2, a2=3, b1=8, b2=7. Then x=(8 -7)/(3 -2)=1/1=1. y=2*1 +8=10. Sum 11. Not good.Alternatively, take a1=1, a2=2, b1=8, b2=7. x=(8 -7)/(2 -1)=1/1=1. y=1*1 +8=9. Sum=10.Alternatively, take a1=8, a2=7, but since a2 must be greater than a1 for first quadrant intersection, but in this case, a1=8, a2=7 would mean a2 &lt; a1, so we need to swap them. If we consider a1=7, a2=8, which we&#39;ve already considered.Alternatively, if we take a1=8, a2=7, but since a1 &lt; a2 is required for the first quadrant intersection (with b1 &gt; b2), but in this case, a1=8 is greater than a2=7, so if we take b1 &lt; b2, but then the intersection might be in the first quadrant. Wait, let&#39;s check.If we take a1=8, a2=7, with b1=1, b2=8. Then x=(8 -1)/(8 -7)=7/1=7. y=8*7 +1=57. Sum=7 +57=64. Wait, this is the same sum, but the intersection point is (7,57) as before. Because swapping a1 and a2 and swapping b1 and b2 just gives the same intersection point. So actually, this is the same pair of lines. The line y=8x +1 and y=7x +8 intersect at (7,57). Similarly, swapping them gives the same intersection.Therefore, the maximum sum is indeed 64, achieved by the lines y=7x +8 and y=8x +1 intersecting at (7,57).But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a pair of lines with different a1, a2, b1, b2 that intersect at a point with x + y &gt; 64.Suppose we take a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=1: sum 64.Is there another pair where x + y could be higher?Suppose we take a1=7, a2=8, b1=8, b2=0. But b2 must be at least 1, so invalid.If b2 could be 0, then x=(8 -0)/(8 -7)=8/1=8. y=7*8 +8=64. Sum=72. But since b2 must be at least 1, this isn&#39;t allowed.Alternatively, if b1 could be 9, but b1 is limited to 8.So within the constraints, the maximum possible is 64.Thus, the answer should be the point (7,57), written as (7;57) in the required format.Final AnswerThe point with the greatest sum of coordinates is boxed{(7; 57)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the intersection point with the greatest sum of coordinates (x + y) among all lines of the form (y = ax + b) where (a) and (b) are natural numbers from 1 to 8, we need to consider pairs of lines with different slopes. The intersection point of two lines (y = a_1x + b_1) and (y = a_2x + b_2) is given by:[x = frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_1 - a_2}][y = a_1 left( frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_1 - a_2} right) + b_1]To maximize the sum (x + y), we need to maximize both (x) and (y). The key is to find pairs of lines where the steeper line (with a larger slope) has a smaller intercept and the flatter line (with a smaller slope) has a larger intercept. This ensures the intersection point is in the first quadrant with positive coordinates.After analyzing various pairs of lines, the maximum sum (x + y) is found for the lines (y = 7x + 8) and (y = 8x + 1). Solving for their intersection:[x = frac{8 - 1}{8 - 7} = 7][y = 7 cdot 7 + 8 = 57]The sum of the coordinates is (7 + 57 = 64), which is the maximum possible value given the constraints.Thus, the point with the greatest sum of coordinates is (boxed{(7; 57)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2fff42df></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2fff42df><span class="icon" data-v-2fff42df>🔑:</span>Answer: (7 ; 57)|(7,57)| 7 ; 57 | 7,57</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-77e84fb7 data-v-2fff42df><div class="review" data-v-2fff42df><div class="review-title" data-v-2fff42df><span class="icon" data-v-2fff42df>❓:</span>8.2.

So, the work was divided equally among the workers. Let me denote the total work as W and the number of workers as N. Then each worker has a share of W/N work to do. After the first day, they checked how many people had completed at least 30% of their share. It turned out that 70% of all workers had done so. So, 0.7N workers completed ≥30% of their individual shares. Similarly, when they checked for those who completed at least 70% of their share, it was 30% of the workers. So, 0.3N workers completed ≥70% of their shares. The question is: Can we be sure that at least a third of the total work has been completed? So, we need to check if the total work done is ≥ (1/3)W.To approach this, I think we can calculate the minimum possible total work completed based on the given percentages and see if it&#39;s at least W/3.Let me structure this:Let’s denote:- Total workers = N- Each worker’s share = W/NWork completed by each worker can be categorized into three groups:1. Workers who completed ≥70% of their share: 30% of N workers.2. Workers who completed between 30% and 70% of their share: Since 70% completed at least 30%, and 30% of those completed at least 70%, so the remaining 70% - 30% = 40% of workers completed between 30% and 70%.3. Workers who completed less than 30%: 100% - 70% = 30% of workers.To find the minimum total work completed, we need to assume the least possible work done in each category. For the first category (30% of workers): minimum work done is 70% of their share.For the second category (40% of workers): minimum work done is 30% of their share.For the third category (30% of workers): minimum work done is 0% (since they did less than 30%).So, total minimum work done would be:= (0.3N * 0.7 * W/N) + (0.4N * 0.3 * W/N) + (0.3N * 0 * W/N)Simplify each term:First term: 0.3N * 0.7 * W/N = 0.21WSecond term: 0.4N * 0.3 * W/N = 0.12WThird term: 0Total minimum work = 0.21W + 0.12W = 0.33WSo, 0.33W is 33% of the total work, which is more than a third (which is approximately 33.333...%). Wait, 0.33 is 33%, which is actually slightly less than a third. Hmm. That&#39;s a problem.But wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me do the math precisely:First term: 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.21Second term: 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12Total: 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33, which is 33%.But a third is 1/3 ≈ 0.3333..., so 0.33 is less than 0.3333... So, 33% is less than 33.333...%. Therefore, the minimum total work done is 33%, which is just under a third. Therefore, we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed. But wait, that contradicts the initial approach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.Hold on, perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Let me think again.If we take the minimal possible contributions, i.e., the 30% of workers did exactly 70%, the 40% did exactly 30%, and the remaining 30% did 0%, then total work done would be:(0.3 * 0.7 + 0.4 * 0.3) * W = (0.21 + 0.12) * W = 0.33W, which is indeed 33% of the total work. Since 33% is less than 33.333...%, which is one third, this would mean that the minimum possible total work done is 33%, which is just under a third. Therefore, we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed.But wait, the question is asking &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot; If the minimal possible total is 33%, which is less than a third (33.333...%), then the answer is no. But wait, 0.33 is 33%, which is exactly 33%, which is 0.3333... is 33.333...%. Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. So 0.33 is 33%, which is less than 1/3. Therefore, the minimum possible is 33%, which is less than a third. Therefore, we cannot be sure. Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot be sure.But hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check.Wait, 30% of the workers completed at least 70%, so we take the minimum contribution from them as 70%. 70% of the workers completed at least 30%, so subtracting those who did 70%, we have 40% who did between 30% and 70%. So, take 30% as their contribution. The rest 30% did less than 30%, so we take 0% from them.Calculating total work:(0.3 * 0.7 + 0.4 * 0.3 + 0.3 * 0) * W = (0.21 + 0.12 + 0) * W = 0.33 * WSo 0.33W is the minimum possible. But 0.33 is less than 1/3 (0.3333...). So, 0.33 &lt; 1/3. Therefore, the minimum total work is less than a third. Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed.But wait, maybe the problem states &quot;no less than 30 percent&quot; and &quot;no less than 70 percent&quot;. So, in that case, the ones who did no less than 30% include those who did 70% or more. Therefore, the 70% of workers include the 30% who did 70% or more. Therefore, the remaining 40% did between 30% and 70%.Therefore, in the calculation, the minimal total work is indeed 0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33, which is 33%, which is less than 1/3 (approx 33.33%). Therefore, the answer would be no.But wait, the problem says &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot;So, if the minimum possible is 33%, which is just under a third, but maybe due to rounding, 33% is considered a third? Wait, 1/3 is exactly 33.333...%, so 33% is less than that. So strictly mathematically, 0.33 is less than 1/3. Therefore, we cannot be sure.But maybe my approach is wrong. Maybe we need to take into account that some workers might have completed more than 70%, so the total could be higher.But the question is whether we can be sure that AT LEAST a third has been completed. So, even if in the minimal case it&#39;s 33%, which is less than 33.333%, then the answer is no, we cannot be sure.Wait, but 0.33 is approximately a third. However, mathematically, 0.33 is not equal to 1/3. So, unless there&#39;s some constraint I&#39;m missing.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in another interpretation. Let me check again.The problem states:- 70% of workers completed no less than 30% of their share.- 30% of workers completed no less than 70% of their share.So, the 30% is a subset of the 70%. So, the 70% includes the 30% who did 70% or more. Therefore, the remaining 40% did between 30% and 70%.Therefore, the total work done is at least (0.3 * 0.7 + 0.4 * 0.3) * total work per worker.Since total work per worker is W/N, and multiplied by N, it cancels out. So total work is (0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3) W = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33 W. So 33% of W. Therefore, since 33% is less than 33.333..., we cannot guarantee that a third has been completed. Therefore, the answer is no.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a different way to compute it? Let me think.Alternatively, maybe use inequalities. Let’s denote x_i as the fraction of work done by worker i. Each x_i is between 0 and 1 (assuming they can&#39;t do more than their share in one day). Then, the total work done is the sum of x_i*(W/N) over all i. So total work is (W/N) * sum x_i. We need to find if sum x_i &gt;= (1/3) N.But sum x_i is the sum over all workers. Let’s see:30% of workers have x_i &gt;= 0.740% of workers have x_i &gt;= 0.3 (but less than 0.7)30% of workers have x_i &lt; 0.3So, to minimize sum x_i, we set the 30% workers to x_i = 0.7, the 40% workers to x_i = 0.3, and the remaining 30% to x_i = 0.So, sum x_i = 0.3N * 0.7 + 0.4N * 0.3 + 0.3N * 0 = 0.21N + 0.12N = 0.33NTherefore, total work done is (W/N) * 0.33N = 0.33W. Which is 33% of W. So, since 33% &lt; 33.333...%, the answer is no, we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed.Wait, but the problem says &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot; If the minimal possible is 33%, which is less than a third, then we cannot be sure. Because there exists a scenario where only 33% is done, which is less than a third. Therefore, the answer is no. But the problem might be expecting yes, so maybe my approach is wrong.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the 30% who did 70% or more could have done more than 70%, so maybe the total is higher. But the question is whether we can be SURE that at least a third has been completed. So even if there is a scenario where only 33% is done, which is less than a third, then the answer is no, we cannot be sure. Because it&#39;s possible that only 33% was done.Alternatively, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again.Let me do the calculation precisely:30% of workers did at least 70%: minimal contribution from them is 0.7.70% - 30% = 40% of workers did between 30% and 70%: minimal contribution is 0.3.30% of workers did less than 30%: minimal contribution is 0.Total minimal work:0.3 * 0.7 + 0.4 * 0.3 + 0.3 * 0 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.330.33 equals 33/100, which is 33%, which is exactly 0.33. 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. So 0.33 is less than 1/3.Therefore, the minimal possible total work is 33%, which is less than a third. Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot be sure.Wait, but maybe the problem is in another interpretation. Let me re-examine the problem statement.&quot;After the first day, they counted how many people had completed no less than 30 percent of their share; it turned out that 70 percent of all workers had done so. When they counted only those who had completed no less than 70 percent of their share, it turned out that 30 percent of the workers had done so.&quot;So, 70% of workers have completed &gt;=30%, and within that 70%, 30% of all workers (which is 30/70 ≈ 42.86% of the 70%) have completed &gt;=70%. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:&quot;When they counted only those who had completed no less than 70 percent of their share, it turned out that 30 percent of the workers had done so.&quot;Wait, that might mean that 30% of all workers have completed &gt;=70%, not 30% of the 70%. Let me check:Original problem statement:&quot;After the first day, they counted how many people had completed no less than 30 percent of their share; it turned out that 70 percent of all workers had done so. When they counted only those who had completed no less than 70 percent of their share, it turned out that 30 percent of the workers had done so.&quot;So, first count: 70% of all workers have &gt;=30% completion.Second count: 30% of all workers have &gt;=70% completion.Therefore, the 30% is a subset of the 70%. So, 30% of workers have &gt;=70%, and the remaining 40% (70% - 30%) have between 30% and 70%.So, in that case, the minimum total work is as calculated before: 0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 + 0.3*0 = 0.33.So, 0.33 of total work, which is 33%, which is less than 1/3 (33.333...%). Therefore, we cannot be sure.But perhaps there&#39;s a different approach? Let me think.Suppose we model the workers in three groups:Group A: 30% of workers, completed ≥70%.Group B: 40% of workers, completed between 30% and 70%.Group C: 30% of workers, completed &lt;30%.To find the minimal total work, we assume Group A did exactly 70%, Group B did exactly 30%, Group C did 0%.Total work done: (0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3) * W = 0.33W.Thus, 33% of total work. Since 33% is less than 1/3 (≈33.333%), we can&#39;t guarantee that at least a third has been completed. Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of &quot;no less than 30 percent&quot; and &quot;no less than 70 percent&quot;. If &quot;no less than 30 percent&quot; includes &quot;no less than 70 percent&quot;, which it does, then the 30% is part of the 70%. Therefore, the groups are correctly divided as A, B, C.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the 30% is not part of the 70%? Wait, that can&#39;t be. Because if you completed no less than 70%, you automatically have completed no less than 30%. So, the 30% who did &gt;=70% are included in the 70% who did &gt;=30%. Therefore, the counts are overlapping, and the groups are as I modeled.Therefore, the minimal total is indeed 33% which is less than 1/3. Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, this seems counterintuitive. If 70% did at least 30%, and 30% did at least 70%, then intuitively, isn&#39;t that a significant portion? But math shows it&#39;s 33%, which is just under a third.But let&#39;s check with an example. Let&#39;s take N = 10 workers, W = 10 units (so each worker has 1 unit).Group A: 3 workers, each did 0.7 units.Group B: 4 workers, each did 0.3 units.Group C: 3 workers, each did 0 units.Total work done: 3*0.7 + 4*0.3 + 3*0 = 2.1 + 1.2 = 3.3 units.Total work is 3.3/10 = 0.33 or 33%.Which is less than 3.333... units needed for a third.Therefore, in this case, the total work done is 33%, which is less than a third. Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot be sure.Therefore, the conclusion is that we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed.Final Answerboxed{No}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the work was divided equally among the workers, we denote the total work as ( W ) and the number of workers as ( N ). Each worker&#39;s share is ( frac{W}{N} ).After the first day:- 70% of the workers completed at least 30% of their share.- 30% of the workers completed at least 70% of their share.To determine if at least a third of the total work has been completed, we calculate the minimum possible total work done by considering the lowest contributions from each group of workers:1. 30% of workers completed at least 70% of their share. The minimum contribution from each worker in this group is 70% of their share.2. 40% of workers (70% - 30%) completed between 30% and 70% of their share. The minimum contribution from each worker in this group is 30% of their share.3. 30% of workers completed less than 30% of their share. The minimum contribution from each worker in this group is 0%.Calculating the total minimum work done:[text{Total minimum work} = left(0.3N times 0.7 times frac{W}{N}right) + left(0.4N times 0.3 times frac{W}{N}right) + left(0.3N times 0 times frac{W}{N}right)]Simplifying each term:[= 0.21W + 0.12W + 0 = 0.33W]Since ( 0.33W ) is 33% of the total work, which is less than a third (approximately 33.333...%), we conclude that we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed.[boxed{No}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, so let&#39;s see. The problem is about dividing work equally among a team of workers. After the first day, they checked how many people had completed at least 30% of their share, and 70% of the workers had done that. Then, when they checked how many had completed at least 70% of their share, 30% of the workers had done so. The question is, can we be sure that at least a third of the total work has been completed? Hmm.Okay, let&#39;s break this down. First, let&#39;s assume there are N workers in the team. Since the work is divided equally, each worker has 1/N of the total work. Let&#39;s denote the total work as W, so each worker&#39;s share is W/N.Now, after the first day, 70% of the workers have completed no less than 30% of their individual share. That means 0.7N workers have each done at least 0.3*(W/N) work. Similarly, 30% of the workers, which is 0.3N workers, have completed at least 0.7*(W/N) work each.We need to find out the total work completed and check if it&#39;s at least (1/3)*W. Let&#39;s denote the total work completed as T. So, T is the sum of all the work done by each worker. The question is whether T &gt;= (1/3)W.To compute T, we can consider the contributions from the different groups of workers. However, the problem is that we don&#39;t know exactly how much each worker has done beyond the minimum thresholds (30% and 70%). For example, the 70% of workers who did at least 30% could have done exactly 30%, or maybe more. Similarly, the 30% who did at least 70% could have done exactly 70% or more. Since we want to find the minimal total work completed, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where each worker did the minimum required to meet the thresholds. That way, we can find the lower bound on T and see if even that lower bound is at least a third of W.So, if we assume that 30% of the workers did exactly 70% of their share and the remaining 40% (since 70% - 30% = 40%) did exactly 30% of their share, then the rest (the remaining 30% of workers) did less than 30% of their share. But wait, the problem says that 70% completed no less than 30%, so the remaining 30% might have completed less than 30%. But we need to calculate the minimal possible T, so we have to assume those 30% did 0% to minimize the total. However, if the problem states that &quot;no less than 30 percent of their share,&quot; maybe they did at least 30%, but actually, wait, no. Wait, the problem says: &quot;70 percent of all workers had completed no less than 30 percent of their share.&quot; So that means 70% did &gt;=30%, and the remaining 30% could have done &lt;30%. Similarly, &quot;30 percent of the workers had completed no less than 70 percent of their share,&quot; so 30% did &gt;=70%, and the remaining 70% (which includes the 30% who did &gt;=70%) but wait, no. Wait, actually, the 30% who did &gt;=70% are a subset of the 70% who did &gt;=30%. Because if you did &gt;=70%, you certainly did &gt;=30%. So, 30% of all workers are in both categories. So, 30% did &gt;=70%, and another 40% (70% - 30%) did between 30% and 70%. The remaining 30% did less than 30%.But to find the minimal total work done, we should assume that the 30% who did &gt;=70% only did exactly 70%, the 40% who did &gt;=30% but &lt;70% did exactly 30%, and the remaining 30% did 0%. This would give the minimal possible total work.Therefore, the total work T would be:T = (0.3N * 0.7*(W/N)) + (0.4N * 0.3*(W/N)) + (0.3N * 0*(W/N)).Simplifying each term:First term: 0.3N * 0.7*(W/N) = 0.21WSecond term: 0.4N * 0.3*(W/N) = 0.12WThird term: 0.3N * 0 = 0Adding them up: 0.21W + 0.12W = 0.33WSo T &gt;= 0.33W, which is approximately 33% of the total work. Since 1/3 is approximately 33.33%, 0.33W is slightly less than a third. Wait, but 0.33 is 33%, which is less than 33.33%. So that would mean that the minimal total work done is 33% of W, which is just under a third. Therefore, in this minimal case, we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed. But the problem asks, &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot;But hold on, maybe my calculation is slightly off. Let&#39;s check:0.3N workers did 0.7*(W/N) each: 0.3N * 0.7*(W/N) = 0.21W0.4N workers did 0.3*(W/N) each: 0.4N * 0.3*(W/N) = 0.12WTotal is 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33WSo 0.33W, which is exactly 33% of the total work, which is less than 1/3 (which is approximately 33.333...%). Therefore, 33% is less than a third.But wait, that&#39;s assuming the minimal case where everyone did exactly the minimum required. However, in reality, some workers might have done more. So the actual total work could be higher, but the question is whether we can be sure that at least a third has been completed. If in the minimal case it&#39;s 33%, which is just shy of a third, then the answer would be no—we can&#39;t be sure. But wait, 0.33 is 33%, which is 0.33... which is 1/3. Wait, 0.33 is not exactly 1/3. Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. So 0.33 is less than 1/3. Therefore, if the minimal total work is 0.33W, which is 33%, then we can&#39;t be sure that a third (33.333...%) has been completed. Because 33% is less than 33.333...%.But wait, is 0.33W accurate? Let&#39;s check again:The first group: 30% of workers did 70% of their share. So 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.21.The second group: 40% of workers did 30% of their share. 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12.Total: 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33.Yes, that&#39;s 33% of the total work. So, in the minimal case, it&#39;s 33%, which is less than 1/3. Therefore, we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed. Therefore, the answer would be no. But wait, the problem is phrased as: &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot; So if the minimal possible is 33%, which is less than a third (33.333...%), then we can&#39;t be sure. Therefore, the answer is no.But hold on, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Because 1/3 is approximately 0.3333, so 0.33 is 33%, which is 1/3 minus 0.0033. So it&#39;s very close, but still less. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, the total work is 33%, which is just under a third. Therefore, the answer is that we cannot be sure. So the answer is no, we can&#39;t be sure.But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again.We have 70% of workers did at least 30% of their work, so to compute the minimal total work, we have to take the minimal contributions from each group. So the 30% of workers who did at least 70% can be assumed to have done exactly 70%, and the remaining 40% (70% - 30%) can be assumed to have done exactly 30%, and the rest (30%) did 0%. Then total work is (0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3) = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33. So 0.33W. Since 0.33 &lt; 1/3 (~0.3333), then we cannot guarantee that a third has been completed.Therefore, the answer is no. However, the problem asks, &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot; So if even in the minimal case it&#39;s 0.33, which is 33%, which is just under a third, then we cannot be sure. Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, perhaps there is a different way to model this. For example, maybe the 30% who did at least 70% are part of the 70% who did at least 30%. So the 30% is included in the 70%. Therefore, the remaining 40% (70% - 30%) did between 30% and 70%, and the rest 30% did less than 30%. So in that case, the minimal total work is:30% did 70%, 40% did 30%, 30% did 0%. Then total is 0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33, same as before.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different distribution. For example, some of the 70% did more than 30%, which would make the total higher. But since we are looking for the minimal total, we need to assume the minimal contributions. Hence, 0.33W is the minimal possible.But 0.33 is approximately 33.0%, which is 0.333... is 33.333...%. So 33.0% is less than 33.333...%, meaning less than a third. Therefore, the minimal total work is less than a third, so we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed. Therefore, the answer is no.Wait, but wait again. Let&#39;s think in fractions. 0.33 is exactly 33/100. 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. 33/100 is 0.33, which is less than 1/3. Therefore, 33% is less than a third. Therefore, even in the minimal case, the total work done is 33%, which is less than a third. Therefore, the conclusion is that we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed.But wait, the problem says &quot;no less than 30 percent&quot; and &quot;no less than 70 percent&quot;. So, the workers who completed &quot;no less than 30 percent&quot; includes those who did exactly 30% or more. Similarly, &quot;no less than 70 percent&quot; includes those who did 70% or more. So, when calculating the minimal total, we take the minimal values, which are 30% and 70% respectively, and the rest as 0%. Then total is 0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 + 0.3*0 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33, which is 33%.But perhaps the problem is in the interpretation. Let me check once more.Suppose there are N workers. Total work is W. Each worker&#39;s share is W/N.After day 1:- 70% of workers (0.7N) have completed &gt;=30% of their share. So each of these 0.7N workers have done &gt;=0.3*(W/N).- 30% of workers (0.3N) have completed &gt;=70% of their share. So each of these 0.3N workers have done &gt;=0.7*(W/N).Note that the 30% who did &gt;=70% are a subset of the 70% who did &gt;=30%. Therefore, the remaining 40% (70% - 30%) have done between 30% and 70%.To compute the minimal total work, we assume:- The 30% did exactly 70%,- The 40% did exactly 30%,- The remaining 30% did 0%.Thus, total work is:0.3N * 0.7*(W/N) + 0.4N * 0.3*(W/N) + 0.3N * 0 = 0.21W + 0.12W + 0 = 0.33W.Therefore, the minimal total work is 0.33W, which is 33% of the total work. Since 1/3 is approximately 33.33%, 0.33W is less than a third. Therefore, we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed.But wait, 0.33 is 33%, but maybe the problem is in the approximation. If we compute exactly:Let&#39;s write it as fractions. 70% is 7/10, 30% is 3/10.The first group: 3/10 of workers did 7/10 of their share.Second group: 4/10 of workers did 3/10 of their share.Third group: 3/10 of workers did 0.Total work:(3/10 * 7/10) + (4/10 * 3/10) + (3/10 * 0) = (21/100) + (12/100) + 0 = 33/100.33/100 is exactly 0.33, which is less than 1/3 (which is 100/300 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333). So 33/100 = 0.33 &lt; 1/3.Therefore, even in the minimal case, the total work is 0.33W, which is less than a third. Therefore, we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed. So the answer is no.But the problem asks, &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot; So the answer would be no, because there exists a scenario where only 33% is done, which is less than a third.Wait, but hold on. Wait a second. If we use fractions instead of decimals, maybe we can get a different result?Let me check:1/3 is exactly 0.3333...33/100 is 0.33, which is less than 1/3.So 0.33 is indeed less than 1/3. Therefore, the conclusion is that we cannot be sure.But the problem says &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot;Since there is a possible scenario where the total work is 33%, which is less than a third, the answer is no, we cannot be sure. However, maybe there&#39;s another angle here. Perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.Wait, another way to think about this is to use inequalities. Let&#39;s let x be the fraction of the total work completed. We need to find the minimal possible x given the constraints.Let’s denote:- Let’s say there are N workers.- Let’s denote the total work as 1 (normalizing W=1 for simplicity).- Each worker’s share is 1/N.- Let’s define variables for the fractions completed by each worker.But since the problem is about percentages, maybe we can use the fractions directly.Let’s denote:- 30% of the workers completed at least 70% of their share. Wait, no. Wait, correction:Wait, the problem states:- After the first day, 70% of workers had completed no less than 30% of their share.- When they counted only those who had completed no less than 70% of their share, it was 30% of the workers.Therefore, 30% of the workers are in the intersection of both categories (&gt;=70%), and 70% - 30% = 40% are in the category of &gt;=30% but &lt;70%. The remaining 30% are &lt;30%.Therefore, in total:- 30% of workers: &gt;=70%- 40% of workers: &gt;=30% and &lt;70%- 30% of workers: &lt;30%To find the minimal total work done, we need to minimize the sum over all workers of their completed work. To minimize, we assume:- The 30% in the highest category did exactly 70%,- The 40% in the middle category did exactly 30%,- The 30% in the lowest category did 0%.Therefore, total work done is:0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 + 0.3*0 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33.Therefore, 0.33, which is less than 1/3 (~0.3333). Therefore, the minimal total work is 0.33, so the answer is no, we can&#39;t be sure that at least a third has been completed.But wait, let me check with another approach. Suppose we model this using integrals or averages.Let’s think of it in terms of average work done per worker.We have three groups:1. 30% of workers: &gt;=70% done.2. 40% of workers: &gt;=30% but &lt;70% done.3. 30% of workers: &lt;30% done.To find the minimal total work, set group 1 to 70%, group 2 to 30%, group 3 to 0%.Average per worker contribution:(0.3 * 0.7) + (0.4 * 0.3) + (0.3 * 0) = 0.21 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.33 per worker.Therefore, total work is 0.33*N*(1/N) = 0.33, same as before.Therefore, the minimal total work is 0.33, which is less than 1/3.Therefore, the answer is no.However, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake here. Let&#39;s think about the total work in terms of person-days or something. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention time or rate, only percentages completed after the first day. So, perhaps the reasoning is correct.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s an inequality we can use here, like the pigeonhole principle or Markov&#39;s inequality. Wait, but let&#39;s think about it.Suppose we have the total fraction of work done is T.We know that 70% of workers did at least 30%, so the total work done by these 70% is at least 0.7N * 0.3*(1/N) = 0.21.Similarly, the 30% of workers who did at least 70% contribute at least 0.3N * 0.7*(1/N) = 0.21.But these two groups overlap. The 30% who did &gt;=70% are included in the 70% who did &gt;=30%. Therefore, the total minimal contribution is:0.3N * 0.7*(1/N) + (0.7N - 0.3N) * 0.3*(1/N) + 0.3N * 0*(1/N) =0.21 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.33, same as before.Therefore, regardless of the approach, the minimal total work is 0.33, which is less than a third.Therefore, the conclusion is that we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed.But wait, hold on. The problem says &quot;no less than 30 percent&quot; and &quot;no less than 70 percent&quot;. So, if someone did exactly 30%, they are counted in the first group, and if someone did exactly 70%, they are counted in both groups. Therefore, the minimal total is indeed 0.33.But let me check once again with exact fractions.Suppose there are 10 workers for simplicity.Total work is 10 units, each worker has 1 unit.70% of workers: 7 workers did &gt;=30% (i.e., &gt;=0.3 units).30% of workers: 3 workers did &gt;=70% (i.e., &gt;=0.7 units).So, 3 workers did &gt;=0.7, and the remaining 4 workers (7 - 3) did &gt;=0.3 but &lt;0.7. The other 3 workers did &lt;0.3.To find the minimal total work, we assume:- 3 workers did 0.7 each: total 2.1- 4 workers did 0.3 each: total 1.2- 3 workers did 0 each: total 0Total work done: 2.1 + 1.2 = 3.3Total work is 3.3 out of 10, which is 33%. Which is again 33%, less than 1/3 (~3.333...).Thus, even with exact numbers, the minimal total is 33%, less than a third.Therefore, we cannot be sure that at least a third has been completed.Therefore, the answer is no.But the problem is in Chinese, maybe there was a translation issue? Wait, no, the problem is presented in English here.Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Wait, 3.3 out of 10 is 33%, but 3.3 is 33% of 10? Wait, no. Wait, total work is 10 units. 3.3 units completed is 33% of 10. Wait, 3.3 is 33% of 10. So yes, 33% of total work. Therefore, same conclusion.Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approach, considering the overlap.Wait, another way: let&#39;s model this with variables.Let’s denote:- Let’s say there are N workers.- Let’s denote x as the fraction of workers who did &gt;=70%.- Let’s denote y as the fraction of workers who did &gt;=30% but &lt;70%.- Then, the remaining z = 1 - x - y did &lt;30%.Given that x = 30% (0.3), and x + y = 70% (0.7), so y = 0.4.Therefore, x = 0.3, y = 0.4, z = 0.3.Total work done is:Total = x*0.7 + y*0.3 + z*0 = 0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 + 0.3*0 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33.Same result.Therefore, regardless of the method, the minimal total is 0.33, which is less than 1/3.Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed.But the problem asks, &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot;Since in the minimal case, it&#39;s 0.33, which is less than 1/3, the answer is no. However, I need to confirm whether 0.33 is considered a third. Wait, 0.33 is approximately a third, but mathematically, 1/3 is exactly 0.3333..., so 0.33 is less than that.Therefore, unless there&#39;s a trick in the problem, the answer is no.But maybe there&#39;s a different way to interpret the problem. For instance, maybe the percentages are in terms of the total work, not individual shares. But the problem states, &quot;no less than 30 percent of their share,&quot; so it&#39;s referring to each worker&#39;s individual share.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s an error in assuming that the remaining 30% did 0%. If they did something, even if less than 30%, that would contribute to the total. However, to find the minimal total work, we have to assume the minimal possible contribution from each worker. Therefore, the minimal total occurs when the remaining 30% did 0%. If they did more, the total would increase. Therefore, our calculation of 0.33 is indeed the minimal possible total work.Therefore, since 0.33 &lt; 1/3, the answer is no.But the problem is from a math competition or something, so maybe the answer is yes, and my reasoning is wrong. Let&#39;s think again.Suppose we have 30% of workers who did 70%, 40% who did 30%, and 30% who did 0%. Total is 0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33. So 33%.But perhaps the problem is in the way the work is divided. Wait, maybe the question is whether the entire work is divided equally, so each worker&#39;s share is equal. So each worker&#39;s share is 1/N of the total work. Then, if 30% of workers did 70% of their share, that&#39;s 0.3N workers * 0.7*(1/N) total work per worker, which is 0.3*0.7 = 0.21. Similarly, 0.4N workers did 0.3*(1/N) each, which is 0.4*0.3 = 0.12. So total is 0.33. Yes, same as before.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the harmonic mean or something else. But I don&#39;t see how that would apply here.Alternatively, use an inequality. Let&#39;s denote T as the total work done. We need to prove T &gt;= 1/3.But given that:- 70% of workers did &gt;=30%: so T &gt;= 0.7*0.3 + remaining 30%*0.But the remaining 30% could have done 0, so T &gt;= 0.7*0.3 = 0.21.But 0.21 &lt; 1/3. So that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, the 30% who did &gt;=70%: so T &gt;= 0.3*0.7 + remaining 70%*0.So T &gt;= 0.21.But 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33 is the minimal T when combining both conditions.Therefore, the minimal T is 0.33, which is still less than 1/3.Therefore, the answer is no.Therefore, I think the answer is that we cannot be sure, so the answer is no.But the problem is translated as &quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot; So the answer should be boxed{No}. But in the instructions, it says to put the final answer within boxed{}, and in math problems, sometimes answers are expected as &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; boxed. However, maybe the problem expects a proof and the answer is yes, but I can&#39;t see how.Wait, let&#39;s think again. Maybe there is a different approach. For example, using the fact that the top 30% did at least 70%, so their contribution is at least 0.3*0.7 = 0.21. The remaining 70% - 30% = 40% did at least 30%, contributing at least 0.4*0.3 = 0.12. So total is at least 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33. The remaining 30% can contribute at least 0, so total is at least 0.33. But 0.33 is 33%, which is less than 1/3 (33.333...%). So even considering the minimal contributions from the two groups, the total is 33%, less than a third. Therefore, we cannot be sure.Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed.But maybe I made a miscalculation. Let&#39;s write it as fractions:0.3 (workers) * 0.7 (contribution) = 0.210.4 * 0.3 = 0.12Total: 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33Which is 33/100, which is less than 1/3 (which is approximately 33.333/100).Therefore, the answer is no.But perhaps the problem expects an answer of yes, using a different method.Alternatively, maybe the average of the two percentages: 70% of workers did 30%, and 30% did 70%, so average is (0.7*0.3 + 0.3*0.7) = 0.21 + 0.21 = 0.42, but that&#39;s incorrect because the 30% who did 70% are part of the 70% who did 30%. So overlapping.Alternatively, use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The total percentage of workers who did at least 30% is 70%, and those who did at least 70% is 30%. Therefore, the workers who did between 30% and 70% is 70% - 30% = 40%. Therefore, the total work done can be calculated as:30% did 70%,40% did 30%,30% did 0%,Total = 0.3*0.7 + 0.4*0.3 = 0.21 + 0.12 = 0.33.Same result.Alternatively, if we model the workers as three groups:Group A: 30% of workers, did 70% each.Group B: 40% of workers, did 30% each.Group C: 30% of workers, did 0% each.Total work = (0.3 * 0.7) + (0.4 * 0.3) + (0.3 * 0) = 0.33.Same as before.Therefore, the minimal total work is 33%, which is less than 1/3. Therefore, the answer is no.But the problem is from a source that might expect a different answer. Wait, let me check the exact wording again:&quot;Can we be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed?&quot;If in the minimal case it&#39;s 33%, which is 0.33, which is approximately a third but technically less than 1/3, then the answer is no. However, depending on rounding, sometimes 33% is considered a third. But mathematically, 1/3 is approximately 33.333...%, so 33% is less than that.Therefore, strictly speaking, 33% is less than a third. Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot be sure.Thus, the final answer is boxed{No}.Final Answerboxed{No}&lt;/think&gt;Given a problem where work is divided equally among a team of workers, we need to determine if at least a third of the total work has been completed based on the following conditions:1. After the first day, 70% of the workers completed no less than 30% of their share.2. 30% of the workers completed no less than 70% of their share.To analyze this, we consider the minimal contributions from each group of workers:- 30% of the workers (who completed at least 70% of their share) contribute a minimum of 0.7 times their share.- 40% of the workers (the remaining part of the 70% who completed at least 30% but less than 70%) contribute a minimum of 0.3 times their share.- The remaining 30% of the workers (who completed less than 30% of their share) contribute 0.Calculating the total work completed:- The contribution from the 30% of workers: (0.3 times 0.7 = 0.21)- The contribution from the 40% of workers: (0.4 times 0.3 = 0.12)- The contribution from the remaining 30% of workers: (0.3 times 0 = 0)Summing these contributions gives:[0.21 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.33]This result, 0.33 (or 33%), is less than a third (approximately 33.33%). Therefore, we cannot be sure that at least a third of the work has been completed.[boxed{No}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2fff42df></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2fff42df><span class="icon" data-v-2fff42df>🔑:</span>Solution: Let&#39;s provide an example where the condition of the problem is met, but a third of the work is not done. Suppose there were 10 workers, and the work involves creating 300 identical parts. Then each worker needs to make 30 parts, and a third of the work consists of 100 parts. Suppose three workers made 21 parts each (exactly 70%), another four made 9 parts each (exactly 30%), and the remaining three did not start working. Then the condition of the problem is met, but only 99 parts were made in total, which is less than a third.Answer: No.Recommendations for checking:| is in the work | points || :--- | :--- || A correct counterexample to the question of the problem is provided | 7 points || A specific case is considered, showing that at least a third of the work could have been done | 0 points || Incorrect counterexample or incorrect justification of the absence of a counterexample | 0 points |</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-77e84fb7><span data-v-77e84fb7>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
