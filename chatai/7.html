Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that when integrating something squared, sometimes it&#39;s easier to expand the expression first before integrating term by term. Let me try that approach.First, expand (2x + 3)^2. To do that, I can use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Applying this here, where a is 2x and b is 3. So, expanding it:(2x)^2 + 2*(2x)*(3) + (3)^2Calculating each term:(2x)^2 = 4x^22*(2x)*(3) = 12x(3)^2 = 9So, when expanded, (2x + 3)^2 becomes 4x^2 + 12x + 9.Now, the integral becomes ∫(4x^2 + 12x + 9) dx. Now, I can integrate each term separately. Let&#39;s recall that the integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration. Also, constants can be factored out of the integral.So, integrating term by term:1. ∫4x^2 dx: Factor out the 4, so it&#39;s 4 ∫x^2 dx. The integral of x^2 is (x^3)/3, so multiplying by 4 gives (4/3)x^3.2. ∫12x dx: Factor out the 12, which becomes 12 ∫x dx. The integral of x is (x^2)/2, so multiplying by 12 gives 6x^2.3. ∫9 dx: Factor out the 9, so it&#39;s 9 ∫1 dx. The integral of 1 with respect to x is x, so this becomes 9x.Adding all these results together: (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C, where C is the constant of integration.Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. For the first term, 4 times (x^3)/3 is indeed (4/3)x^3. Second term, 12 times (x^2)/2 is 6x^2. Third term is 9x. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way using substitution. Let me try that to verify. Let u = 2x + 3. Then du/dx = 2, so du = 2 dx, which means dx = du/2. Then the integral becomes ∫u^2 * (du/2). That would be (1/2) ∫u^2 du. Integrating u^2 gives (u^3)/3. Multiplying by 1/2 gives (u^3)/6. Then substitute back u = 2x + 3. So, ( (2x + 3)^3 ) / 6 + C. Wait a minute, now I have two different answers? One from expanding and another from substitution. Which one is correct? Let me check by differentiating both results.First, differentiating the expansion result: d/dx [ (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C ] = 4x^2 + 12x + 9. Which is indeed the original integrand (2x + 3)^2. So that&#39;s correct.Now, differentiating the substitution result: d/dx [ ( (2x + 3)^3 ) / 6 + C ] = (3*(2x + 3)^2 * 2 ) / 6 = (6*(2x + 3)^2 ) / 6 = (2x + 3)^2. Which also matches the integrand. So both methods are correct. Therefore, the two results must differ by a constant. Let me check.Let&#39;s expand the substitution answer: (2x + 3)^3 / 6. Let&#39;s compute that:(2x + 3)^3 = 8x^3 + 36x^2 + 54x + 27. Then divided by 6 gives (8x^3)/6 + (36x^2)/6 + (54x)/6 + 27/6 = (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + 4.5.Comparing to the expansion answer: (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C. So the substitution method gives an extra 4.5 (which is 9/2) in the constant term. But since both are indefinite integrals, constants can differ, so the two answers are equivalent. So both are correct, just the constant of integration is different. That makes sense.Therefore, the answer can be written either way. Depending on the method, we can present it. But the problem says &quot;Find the indefinite integral,&quot; so both forms are acceptable. However, in some cases, the problem might prefer one form over another. Let me check if expanding is necessary or if the substitution form is sufficient. The example given in the problem might be expecting the expanded form. Let&#39;s see, Example 1, maybe they want the expanded version.Alternatively, maybe the substitution method is more straightforward. But since both are correct, perhaps either is acceptable. But in calculus, sometimes the answer is written in the simplest form, and if they expanded, maybe that&#39;s the expected answer. Let&#39;s compare the two answers:Expansion: (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + CSubstitution: (2x + 3)^3 /6 + CBut when expanded, the substitution answer includes the expansion plus a constant. However, the constant can absorb the 27/6 (which is 4.5) into the constant term. Wait, but if we consider the substitution answer as (2x+3)^3 /6 + C, then when expanded, it&#39;s (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + 27/6 + C. So the 27/6 can be combined with the constant C. Therefore, both answers are equivalent, differing only by the constant. Therefore, both are correct.However, depending on the instructions, sometimes the expanded form is preferred unless specified otherwise. So in the absence of specific instructions, either form is acceptable. However, looking back at the problem statement, it&#39;s an example problem. Let me check the example. Wait, the user is giving an example, Example 1, so perhaps they want the answer in expanded form. Alternatively, if I were to answer this, should I write both? Probably not. The problem says &quot;Find the indefinite integral,&quot; and in calculus textbooks, sometimes substitution is preferred if it&#39;s simpler, but in this case, expanding is straightforward.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the substitution method. Let me check by differentiating both. Wait, both are correct. So the answer could be written either way. But maybe the user expects the expanded form. Let me see, (2x+3)^3 /6 + C is a more compact form, but the expanded form is also acceptable. Depending on the context, but in most cases, unless substitution is specified, expanding might be more straightforward. Let me check if expanding is necessary. Let&#39;s see, the integrand is a quadratic, so expanding and integrating term by term is straightforward, but substitution is also valid. Given that both methods are valid, perhaps the answer is presented in the expanded form. Since the problem is an example, maybe to demonstrate integrating polynomials. Therefore, expanding first is the approach taken here. So the answer would be (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C.But let me check once more. If we use substitution, we can get a more compact form, but the expanded form is equivalent. Since constants are arbitrary, both are correct. However, in many textbooks, when you can expand, they prefer the expanded form. Therefore, the answer is (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C.Alternatively, if the problem was more complex, substitution would be the way to go. But for a quadratic, expansion is simple. Hence, the answer via expansion is likely expected here.Final AnswerThe indefinite integral is boxed{dfrac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the indefinite integral (int(2x + 3)^2 , dx), we start by expanding the integrand:[(2x + 3)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2 cdot (2x) cdot 3 + 3^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9]Next, we integrate each term separately:1. The integral of (4x^2) is:   [   int 4x^2 , dx = 4 cdot frac{x^3}{3} = frac{4}{3}x^3   ]2. The integral of (12x) is:   [   int 12x , dx = 12 cdot frac{x^2}{2} = 6x^2   ]3. The integral of (9) is:   [   int 9 , dx = 9x   ]Combining these results and adding the constant of integration (C), we get:[int(2x + 3)^2 , dx = frac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C]Thus, the indefinite integral is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the indefinite integral of (2x + 3) squared with respect to x. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when integrating something squared, it might be easier to expand the square first before trying to integrate term by term. Let me try that approach.First, expand (2x + 3)^2. Let&#39;s do that step by step. (a + b)^2 is a^2 + 2ab + b^2, right? So applying that formula here:(2x)^2 + 2*(2x)*(3) + (3)^2. Let&#39;s compute each term.(2x)^2 is 4x^2. Then 2*(2x)*(3) would be 12x. And (3)^2 is 9. So combining those, the expansion becomes 4x^2 + 12x + 9. Okay, so the integral becomes the integral of (4x^2 + 12x + 9) dx.Now, I can split this integral into three separate integrals: the integral of 4x^2 dx plus the integral of 12x dx plus the integral of 9 dx. That should be straightforward.Starting with the first term, the integral of 4x^2 dx. The integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, right? So applying that here, 4 times the integral of x^2 dx. That would be 4*(x^(2+1)/(2+1)) = 4*(x^3/3) = (4/3)x^3.Next, the integral of 12x dx. Similarly, integrating x with respect to x. The integral of x is (x^2)/2, so 12 times that would be 12*(x^2/2) = 6x^2.Then the integral of 9 dx. The integral of a constant is the constant times x. So that would be 9x.Putting it all together, we have (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C, where C is the constant of integration. Hmm, let me check if that makes sense. Differentiating this result should give back the original function (2x + 3)^2.Let&#39;s differentiate term by term. The derivative of (4/3)x^3 is 4x^2. The derivative of 6x^2 is 12x. The derivative of 9x is 9. Adding those up: 4x^2 + 12x + 9, which is exactly the expansion we had earlier. And since (2x + 3)^2 expands to that, the differentiation checks out. So the integral is correct.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another way to integrate this without expanding? Like using substitution. Let me try that method to see if I get the same answer.Let u = 2x + 3. Then du/dx = 2, so du = 2 dx, which means dx = du/2. Substitute into the integral:Integral of u^2 * (du/2). That&#39;s (1/2) ∫ u^2 du. The integral of u^2 is (u^3)/3, so multiplying by 1/2 gives (1/2)*(u^3/3) = u^3/6 + C. Then substitute back u = 2x + 3, so the integral becomes (2x + 3)^3 / 6 + C.Wait, but this result is different from the one I got earlier. That can&#39;t be right. Did I make a mistake here?Wait, let&#39;s check the substitution method again. Let&#39;s take the original integral: ∫ (2x + 3)^2 dx. Let u = 2x + 3, du = 2 dx, so dx = du/2. Then substituting, we get ∫ u^2 * (du/2) = (1/2) ∫ u^2 du. Integrating that gives (1/2)*(u^3 / 3) + C = u^3 / 6 + C. Substituting back gives (2x + 3)^3 / 6 + C.But when I expanded and integrated term by term, I got (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C. Are these two expressions equivalent?Let me expand (2x + 3)^3 and divide by 6 to see.(2x + 3)^3 = (2x)^3 + 3*(2x)^2*3 + 3*(2x)*(3)^2 + (3)^3. Let&#39;s compute each term:(2x)^3 = 8x^33*(2x)^2*3 = 3*(4x^2)*3 = 36x^23*(2x)*(9) = 54x27So altogether, 8x^3 + 36x^2 + 54x + 27. Divided by 6: (8x^3)/6 + (36x^2)/6 + (54x)/6 + 27/6. Simplify each term:8/6 x^3 = 4/3 x^336/6 x^2 = 6x^254/6 x = 9x27/6 = 9/2So the substitution method gives (4/3 x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + 9/2) + C.Wait a minute, but when I did the expansion method, I had (4/3)x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C. So there&#39;s an extra 9/2 in the substitution method. That suggests that the substitution method is missing something? But no, substitution method should give the correct result. Wait, but when I substituted, I included the constant term?Wait, no. Let&#39;s check again. When I substituted, I had the integral of (2x +3)^2 dx via substitution, which led to (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. However, when expanded, that includes 4/3 x^3 + 6x^2 +9x + 9/2 + C. But in the expansion method, the constant term was just C. So the two methods differ by a constant? Which is allowed in indefinite integrals, because the constant of integration can absorb that. However, the problem arises if you don&#39;t account for it.Wait, but when I integrated via expansion, I had (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x + C. Whereas substitution gives (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x +9/2 + C. So the constants differ by 9/2. But since C is an arbitrary constant, both answers are correct. So essentially, the substitution method&#39;s constant is 9/2 plus the original C, which is still a constant. Therefore, both solutions are correct, differing only by the constant term. So both are valid indefinite integrals.But then why does the substitution method give an extra 9/2? Because when we expanded, the integral of 9 dx is 9x, and the other terms. However, in the substitution method, the integral ends up with a 27/6 =9/2 term. Wait, no. Wait, when I expanded (2x +3)^3 /6, the constant term is 27/6=9/2, but in the expansion method, integrating 9 dx gives 9x, so the linear term is 9x. But in the substitution method, after expanding, we have 9x and 9/2. So actually, in the substitution method, the answer is (2x +3)^3 /6 + C, but when expanded, it&#39;s (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x +9/2 + C. Comparing to the expansion method, which is (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x + C. So they differ by 9/2. But since C is arbitrary, both are correct. So actually, the substitution method didn&#39;t do anything wrong. The difference is just in the constant term.Therefore, both methods are correct, and the answers are equivalent because the constants can differ. Therefore, both (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x + C and (2x +3)^3 /6 + C are correct indefinite integrals. However, typically, the answer is written in the simplest form. If we use substitution, we can leave it as (2x +3)^3 /6 + C, which is a more compact form. Alternatively, expanding it gives the polynomial form.But the question is to find the indefinite integral. Depending on the instructions, sometimes factored form is preferred, but the problem didn&#39;t specify. However, in the example given, perhaps they expect the expanded form. Let me check the original problem again. It says &quot;Find the indefinite integral ∫(2x +3)^2 dx&quot;. So, in calculus, both answers are correct, but perhaps the expected answer is the expanded form. Let me confirm by differentiating both.If we take the substitution answer: (2x +3)^3 /6. The derivative is 3*(2x +3)^2 *2 /6 = (6*(2x +3)^2)/6 = (2x +3)^2, which matches the integrand. So that&#39;s correct. The expanded form&#39;s derivative is 4x^2 +12x +9, which is equal to (2x +3)^2. Therefore, both answers are correct. But in terms of standard practice, sometimes leaving it in the factored form is preferable as it&#39;s more compact, unless specified otherwise.Wait, but the example might be leading towards expansion because when you expand, you can integrate term by term. Let me see. The example is probably meant to demonstrate expanding before integrating. So maybe the answer is expected to be in expanded form. However, since substitution gives a more concise answer, but it&#39;s still correct. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify, both are acceptable.But let me check with the original problem again. The problem is from example 1, which likely is a simple one to demonstrate expanding the integrand. So perhaps the answer is the expanded polynomial. However, to make sure, let&#39;s see. If we present both forms, but the problem asks for the indefinite integral, so technically either is correct, but perhaps the factored form via substitution is more elegant.But in many calculus textbooks, when you have a linear function raised to a power, the standard integration formula is ∫(ax + b)^n dx = ( (ax + b)^(n+1) )/( a(n+1) ) ) + C, for n ≠ -1. In this case, a=2, b=3, n=2. So applying the formula: ( (2x +3)^(3) )/( 2*(3) ) + C = (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. Therefore, this is the standard result. However, expanding is also a valid method, leading to the polynomial form. So depending on the approach, both answers are correct.But since the question is to &quot;find the indefinite integral&quot;, and unless specified, both forms are acceptable. However, in the example, maybe they expect the student to expand first, as substitution might be taught later. But since substitution is a fundamental method, but maybe in some curricula, students learn substitution after learning expansion. If this is an early problem, expansion is the way to go.Given that the problem is presented as an example, perhaps to show that expanding the square is a valid method, leading to the polynomial. However, given that substitution gives a more compact form, the answer might prefer that. However, given that when expanded, the substitution answer includes a 9/2 term, which is a constant, and in the expansion method, that term is part of the constant C. So in reality, both answers are equivalent, with the constant term being different. Therefore, the answer can be written either way. But let&#39;s see.If the problem is in a section that teaches substitution, then the answer via substitution is expected. If it&#39;s in a section before substitution is introduced, then expanding is the method. But since the user hasn&#39;t specified, as a solver, I need to present the answer, possibly both, but the user might expect the expanded form as in the example.Wait, actually, the user wrote: &quot;Example 1. Find the indefinite integral ∫(2x +3)^2 dx.&quot; So this is presented as an example. Therefore, likely, the solution is supposed to show expanding the integrand first. Let me check standard calculus textbooks. For example, in Stewart&#39;s Calculus, early on, when integrating polynomials, they expand. Substitution comes later. Therefore, if this is an example in the polynomial integration section, expanding is appropriate.Therefore, in this case, expanding (2x +3)^2 to 4x^2 +12x +9, then integrating term by term gives (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x +C. Alternatively, using substitution gives (2x +3)^3 /6 +C, which expands to the same thing plus a constant. Since constants can be absorbed into C, both are correct. But in the context of an example problem asking for the indefinite integral, both forms are acceptable. However, depending on the method taught, one might be preferred.But the user hasn&#39;t specified which method. Given that it&#39;s an example problem, and often examples demonstrate multiple methods. However, since the original problem is presented as Example 1, which is probably introductory, they might want the expanded form.But to confirm, let&#39;s compute both results numerically. Let&#39;s compute the integral from, say, 0 to 1 using both forms and see if they differ by a constant.First, using expanded form: (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x. At x=1: (4/3) +6 +9 = 4/3 +15 = 19/3. At x=0: 0. So the definite integral from 0 to1 is 19/3.Using substitution form: (2x +3)^3 /6. At x=1: (5)^3 /6 =125/6. At x=0: (3)^3 /6=27/6=9/2. So definite integral is 125/6 -9/2 =125/6 -27/6=98/6=49/3≈16.333..., which is different from 19/3≈6.333... Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, no. Wait, definite integral from 0 to1 is the same regardless of the method. There must be a miscalculation here.Wait, wait. Wait, hold on. If both forms are antiderivatives, their difference should be a constant. Let me check the antiderivatives:Expanded form: (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x + C.Substitution form: (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. Let&#39;s expand this:(8x^3 + 36x^2 +54x +27)/6 = (8/6)x^3 + (36/6)x^2 + (54/6)x +27/6 = (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x +9/2.So the substitution form is (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x +9/2 + C. The expanded form is (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x + C. Therefore, the difference between the two is 9/2. So if you evaluate both from 0 to1:Expanded form: [ (4/3)(1)^3 +6(1)^2 +9(1) ] - [0] =4/3 +6 +9 =4/3 +15=19/3 ≈6.333.Substitution form: [ (4/3)(1)^3 +6(1)^2 +9(1) +9/2 ] - [ (4/3)(0)^3 +6(0)^2 +9(0) +9/2 ] = (19/3 +9/2) -9/2 =19/3. So same result. Therefore, the extra constant cancels out in definite integrals, as expected. Therefore, both antiderivatives are correct, differing by a constant.Therefore, both answers are correct. However, in the context of an indefinite integral, the constant of integration is included, so both are acceptable. However, typically, answers are written in the simplest form. The substitution method gives a more compact answer, so (2x +3)^3 /6 +C is preferable. However, if the problem is in a section that requires expanding polynomials before integrating, then the expanded form is expected.Given that the user presents this as &quot;Example 1,&quot; which is likely an early example, and in early integration examples, expanding is common before substitution is introduced, but I can&#39;t be sure. However, in many textbooks, substitution is introduced after basic integration, so maybe expanding is the method intended here.Alternatively, check the problem statement again. The problem says: &quot;Find the indefinite integral ∫(2x +3)^2 dx&quot;. If this is from a section before substitution, then expanding is the way. If substitution is allowed, then either method is okay. Given that substitution is a more advanced technique, but in this case, expanding is straightforward. So perhaps the expected answer is the expanded form.But since both are correct, which one should be the final answer? In exams or textbooks, sometimes both forms are accepted. But to confirm, perhaps the example expects the substitution method. Wait, but substitution wasn&#39;t mentioned. The example just says &quot;find the indefinite integral&quot;.Given that expanding is straightforward here, and the power is only squared, which is easy to expand, perhaps the example wants to show expansion.But in conclusion, both methods are valid, but depending on the pedagogical context, the answer can be written in either form. However, as a solver, I need to present the most appropriate answer. Given that the problem is labeled as an example, and considering that substitution might be a more efficient method, but without knowing the exact context, it&#39;s safer to provide both answers. However, since the user might expect a single answer, perhaps the expanded form is safer, as it&#39;s more explicit.Alternatively, check online resources. For example, if I search for the integral of (2x+3)^2 dx, Wolfram Alpha gives both forms: 1/6 (2x+3)^3 + C and the expanded form. But often, factored form is preferred for its compactness.But again, since the user hasn&#39;t specified the method, but given that it&#39;s an example problem, perhaps the solution is intended to demonstrate substitution. However, since expanding is straightforward, and the user might be a student learning basic integration, let&#39;s present both methods and explain the difference.But given the original instruction: &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, so they expect a single answer. Therefore, the question is, which form is considered standard.In many calculus textbooks, the standard answer would be the expanded form, unless substitution is explicitly required. However, substitution gives a neater answer. Let me check a few sources.For instance, Paul&#39;s Online Math Notes. In the substitution section, he integrates (2x+1)^4 by substitution, resulting in (2x+1)^5 /10 +C. But in the basic integration section, he expands polynomials. Therefore, if this problem is from the substitution section, the answer would be in factored form. If it&#39;s from the basic integration section, expanded.Since the user hasn&#39;t specified, but given that (2x+3)^2 is a quadratic, which is easy to expand, perhaps the intended answer is the expanded polynomial. Therefore, integrating term by term.So the final answer would be (4/3)x^3 +6x^2 +9x +C. Therefore, boxed, it would be boxed{dfrac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C}.Alternatively, if substitution is preferred, the answer is boxed{dfrac{(2x + 3)^3}{6} + C}. Both are correct. But to determine which one is expected, given that it&#39;s Example 1, likely introducing basic integration, expanding is the probable method intended here.Therefore, I&#39;ll present the expanded form as the final answer.&lt;/think&gt;To find the indefinite integral (int(2x + 3)^2 , dx), we can expand the integrand first and then integrate term by term.1. Expand the integrand:   [   (2x + 3)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2 cdot (2x) cdot 3 + 3^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9   ]2. Integrate each term separately:   - The integral of (4x^2) is:     [     int 4x^2 , dx = 4 cdot frac{x^3}{3} = frac{4}{3}x^3     ]   - The integral of (12x) is:     [     int 12x , dx = 12 cdot frac{x^2}{2} = 6x^2     ]   - The integral of (9) is:     [     int 9 , dx = 9x     ]3. Combine the results and add the constant of integration (C):   [   int(2x + 3)^2 , dx = frac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C   ]Thus, the indefinite integral is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the indefinite integral of (2x + 3) squared with respect to x. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that integrating something squared might be easier if I expand the square before trying to integrate. Let me try that.Alright, expanding (2x + 3) squared. The formula for (a + b)^2 is a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. So applying that here, a is 2x and b is 3. So that would be (2x)^2 plus 2*(2x)*3 plus 3^2. Let me calculate each term:First term: (2x)^2 = 4x².Second term: 2*(2x)*3. Let&#39;s see, 2 times 2x is 4x, and 4x times 3 is 12x.Third term: 3 squared is 9.So putting it all together, the expansion is 4x² + 12x + 9. Okay, that seems right. Let me check again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in expanding. Multiply (2x + 3)(2x + 3): first terms 2x*2x = 4x², outer terms 2x*3 = 6x, inner terms 3*2x = 6x, last terms 3*3 = 9. Adding those up: 4x² + 6x + 6x + 9, which is 4x² + 12x + 9. Yeah, that matches. Good, so the expansion is correct.Now the integral becomes ∫(4x² + 12x + 9) dx. I can integrate each term separately because the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. Let me recall the power rule for integration: the integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, as long as n isn&#39;t -1.Starting with the first term: ∫4x² dx. The integral of x² is (x³)/3, so multiplying by 4 gives (4/3)x³.Second term: ∫12x dx. The integral of x is (x²)/2, so 12 times that is 6x².Third term: ∫9 dx. The integral of a constant is the constant times x, so that&#39;s 9x.Adding all those together, we have (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C, where C is the constant of integration. Let me check each term again to make sure I didn&#39;t mix up any coefficients or exponents.First term: 4x² integrated is (4/3)x³. Yep, that&#39;s right. Second term: 12x integrated is 6x². Correct. Third term: 9 integrated is 9x. Yep. So combining them all gives the antiderivative. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way to approach this without expanding. Let me think. If I use substitution. Let u = 2x + 3. Then du/dx = 2, so du = 2 dx, which means dx = du/2. Then the integral becomes ∫u² * (du/2). Let&#39;s see:∫u² (du/2) = (1/2)∫u² du = (1/2)*(u³/3) + C = u³/6 + C. Then substitute back u = 2x + 3: (2x + 3)³ / 6 + C.Wait, but that&#39;s a different answer than before. Hmm. Which one is correct? Did I make a mistake in one of the methods?Wait, if I expand (2x + 3)³ / 6, what do I get? Let&#39;s compute that and compare to the previous answer. Maybe they differ by a constant, which is okay because the constant of integration can absorb that.First, (2x + 3)^3. Let&#39;s compute that:(2x + 3)^3 = (2x)^3 + 3*(2x)^2*3 + 3*(2x)*(3)^2 + (3)^3Wait, no, actually, the expansion is 8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27. Let me check:Using the binomial theorem: (a + b)^3 = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. Here a = 2x, b = 3.So (2x)^3 = 8x³.3a²b = 3*(4x²)*3 = 36x².3ab² = 3*(2x)*(9) = 54x.b³ = 27.Therefore, (2x + 3)^3 = 8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27. Then divided by 6 gives (8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27)/6. Simplifying each term:8x³ /6 = (4/3)x³.36x² /6 = 6x².54x /6 = 9x.27/6 = 4.5 or 9/2. So putting it all together, (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + 9/2 + C.But in the first method, when I expanded and integrated term by term, I had (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. So the substitution method gives an extra 9/2. Hmm. That suggests that one of the methods is wrong. But wait, substitution should work, right? Or maybe I missed something.Wait, when I did substitution, I set u = 2x + 3, then du = 2 dx, so dx = du/2. Then ∫u² dx becomes ∫u²*(du/2) = (1/2) ∫u² du = (1/2)*(u³/3) + C = u³ /6 + C. But substituting back, that&#39;s (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. But when we expand that, why is there an extra 9/2?Ah, wait, because when you do substitution, the constant of integration is included. So when we expand the substitution method, we get (8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27)/6 + C. Let&#39;s compute that expression:8x³/6 = 4/3 x³36x²/6 = 6x²54x/6 = 9x27/6 = 4.5 = 9/2So the substitution method gives (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + 9/2 + C.But when we integrated term by term, we got (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C.So they differ by 9/2. But since the constant of integration is arbitrary, the two answers are both correct, but they differ by a constant. Which is allowed in indefinite integrals. So actually, both methods are correct. But why does substitution give an extra constant term?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution method. Let me check again.Original integral: ∫(2x +3)^2 dx.Substitution: u = 2x +3, du = 2 dx ⇒ dx = du/2.So ∫u² * (du/2) = 1/2 ∫u² du = 1/2 * (u³/3) + C = u³/6 + C.Replace u: (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. Then, if I expand, I get (8x³ +36x² +54x +27)/6 = (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x + 27/6 = 4/3x³ +6x² +9x +4.5.But the other method gave 4/3x³ +6x² +9x + C. So the substitution method&#39;s answer is the same as the expansion method&#39;s answer plus 4.5. But since C is arbitrary, the substitution method&#39;s answer is equivalent to the expansion answer with C&#39; = C + 4.5. So both are correct.But in an indefinite integral, the constant is arbitrary, so both forms are acceptable. However, if we were to compute a definite integral, the constants would cancel out. But here, since it&#39;s indefinite, both answers are correct but expressed differently. However, maybe the problem expects the expanded form. Let me check.Wait, in the first method, expanding first gives an answer without the 9/2 term. But substitution gives an answer that includes 9/2. But when you expand (2x +3)^3 /6, you can&#39;t avoid the 27/6, which is 9/2. So substitution method gives that. But when you expand (2x +3)^2 first and integrate term by term, you get a different constant term. But constants can differ, so both are correct.However, if the problem is expecting the answer in expanded form, then the first method is better because it gives the answer as a polynomial. The substitution method gives a factored form plus a constant. But depending on how the answer is expected, either could be acceptable, but maybe the first method is more straightforward here.Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the substitution approach. Wait, let&#39;s check by differentiating both answers.First, differentiate the substitution answer: d/dx [ (2x +3)^3 /6 + C ].Using chain rule: 3*(2x +3)^2 *2 /6 = (6*(2x +3)^2)/6 = (2x +3)^2. Which is the original integrand. Correct.Differentiate the expansion answer: d/dx [ (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x + C ] = 4x² + 12x +9. Which is indeed the original integrand (2x +3)^2. So both derivatives give the correct integrand. Therefore, both answers are correct. The difference is in the constant term, which is absorbed into the constant of integration. Therefore, both methods are valid. So the answer can be written either way.But in the example, probably the first method is preferred because it&#39;s simpler to write the expanded form. Alternatively, the second method gives a more compact form, but it&#39;s equivalent up to a constant. However, in calculus, when they ask for an indefinite integral, different forms that differ by a constant are both acceptable. But sometimes, they might prefer one form over another.Wait, but the problem statement in the example is to find the indefinite integral. So technically, both answers are correct. But if we check with the first method, the answer is (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +C. If we check with substitution, the answer is (2x +3)^3 /6 +C. Since they differ by a constant, both are correct. However, different textbooks might present the answer in different forms.But in this case, expanding the square first and integrating term by term is straightforward and gives a polynomial answer, which is more likely the expected answer here. The substitution method gives a more factored form, but if the question doesn&#39;t specify the form, both are correct, but perhaps the expanded form is more standard.Wait, but let&#39;s verify with the substitution method. The substitution answer is (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. The expansion answer is (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +C. If I factor the expansion answer:(4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +C = (1/6)(8x³ +36x² +54x) +C. Which is the same as (1/6)( (2x)^3 + 3*(2x)^2*3 + 3*(2x)*3^2 ) +C, but missing the 3^3 term. Wait, but substitution gives (2x +3)^3 /6 +C which includes the 27 term. So in the expansion method, integrating term by term, we didn&#39;t have the 27/6 term. So the discrepancy is the constant term 27/6, which is 9/2. So substitution includes that in the answer, but integrating term by term, the constant is part of the +C. Therefore, when integrating term by term, the +C can include any constant, so the substitution answer is equivalent to the expansion answer with C = original C +9/2.Therefore, both answers are correct. However, if the question expects the answer in the expanded form without the additional constant term, then the first method is the way to go. But strictly speaking, both are correct. However, typically, when you expand, you just leave the constant as C, since 9/2 can be absorbed into the constant. But in substitution, you have to carry all terms. Wait, actually, substitution gives (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. When expanded, that includes 27/6, which is 9/2. But when you integrate term by term, you have 9x and the constants from integrating, which is 9x + C. But when you expanded (2x +3)^2, you had 9 as the constant term. Then integrating that gives 9x. So in substitution method, integrating (2x +3)^2 gives (2x +3)^3 /6 + C, which when expanded has 9/2 as part of the expression. But in the term-by-term integration, there is no 9/2, but there&#39;s a 9x. Wait, the difference is not in the x term. Wait, substitution gives 9x + 9/2 + C, whereas term-by-term gives 9x + C. So they differ by 9/2. Therefore, substitution includes an extra constant term. But since the constant of integration is arbitrary, both are correct. So in the substitution answer, you can write (2x +3)^3 /6 + C, and in the term-by-term answer, (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x + C. Both are correct, but different by a constant. Therefore, the answer can be written either way.But in most calculus courses, if you can express the integral in a factored form, that&#39;s acceptable. However, sometimes they prefer the expanded form. Let&#39;s check what&#39;s more standard. For example, in textbooks, when integrating (ax + b)^n, they often use substitution and give the answer as (ax + b)^{n+1}/(a(n+1)) + C. So in this case, n =2, a=2, so the answer would be (2x +3)^3/(2*3) + C = (2x +3)^3 /6 + C. So that&#39;s a standard answer. But if you expand it, you get the polynomial form. So either answer is acceptable.However, the problem here says &quot;Find the indefinite integral&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify the form. So both are correct, but the question is, which form should be presented? If we look at example 1, which is this problem, I think the user is presenting an example solution. So maybe the solution should present both methods? Or perhaps the standard method.Wait, but let&#39;s check in the problem statement: &quot;E x a m p l e 1. Find the indefinite integral ∫(2x +3)^2 dx.&quot; So this is an example problem. The user hasn&#39;t provided a solution yet. So when the assistant answers, they need to provide the solution. So given that, the assistant needs to present a solution. The user is showing an example, but in the problem statement, the user says &quot;You will be given a problem. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within boxed{}: Example 1. Find the indefinite integral ∫(2x +3)^2 dx.&quot;Therefore, as the assistant, I need to solve this problem, show the step-by-step reasoning, and put the final answer in a box. So in the example, the user is presenting a problem for me to solve. Therefore, I need to write out the solution.In this case, since both methods are correct, but the problem is about integrating (2x +3)^2 dx. If I were tutoring someone, I might show both methods. But since the user is asking for the indefinite integral, and both forms are acceptable, but perhaps the expanded form is more straightforward here.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the substitution method. Let&#39;s see.But considering time, expanding is quicker here. Let me present both methods in the reasoning, then choose the expanded form as the answer, as it&#39;s a standard polynomial which is easily verifiable.So, first, expand the integrand:(2x + 3)^2 = 4x² + 12x +9.Then integrate term by term:∫4x² dx = (4/3)x³,∫12x dx = 6x²,∫9 dx =9x.Add them up with the constant of integration:(4/3)x³ +6x² +9x + C.Alternatively, using substitution:Let u =2x +3, du=2dx ⇒ dx=du/2.Integral becomes ∫u²*(du/2)= (1/2)(u³/3) +C= u³/6 +C= (2x+3)³ /6 +C.But as shown earlier, expanding this gives (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +9/2 +C, which differs by the constant term 9/2. However, since constants are arbitrary, both are correct.But the problem asks for the indefinite integral, so both forms are acceptable. However, the user might expect one of them. Let me check with differentiation.If I take (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +C, derivative is 4x² +12x +9, which matches the original integrand.If I take (2x +3)^3 /6 +C, derivative is 3*(2x +3)^2 *2 /6 = (6*(2x +3)^2)/6 = (2x +3)^2, which is the original integrand. So both derivatives are correct. Therefore, both answers are correct.But the problem is presented as Example 1, which is likely from a textbook. Let me think about what is the standard answer. In some textbooks, when you have a linear function raised to a power, they use substitution and present the answer in that form. For example, ∫(ax +b)^n dx = (ax +b)^{n+1}/(a(n+1)) +C. So in this case, a=2, n=2, so it&#39;s (2x +3)^3/(2*3) +C= (2x +3)^3 /6 +C. So that&#39;s a standard formula.However, other textbooks might expect the student to expand and integrate term by term. Given that the power here is only 2, expanding is not too bad. So depending on the context, both could be acceptable.But in many calculus textbooks, if the function inside the integral is a linear term raised to a power, substitution is the method they are trying to teach, so the answer would be in terms of (2x +3)^3 /6 +C.But since the problem didn&#39;t specify the method, either is acceptable. But since the example is labeled as Example 1, which is likely early in the integration chapter, maybe before substitution is introduced, so expanding would be the method used.Wait, but substitution is usually introduced early as well. Let me check the order of topics. Usually, substitution comes after basic integration rules. So if this is the first example, maybe expanding is expected.Alternatively, the problem could be from a section on substitution, in which case the substitution method is expected.Since the problem is presented without context, it&#39;s hard to tell. However, considering that expanding is straightforward here, and leads to a simple polynomial answer, that might be the expected solution. But substitution is also a valid method.Given that both methods are correct, but the problem is written as Example 1, which might be in a section before substitution, so expanding is the intended method. Therefore, the answer would be (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +C.Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a section on substitution, expecting the answer in that form. Since the user hasn&#39;t specified, as a solver, I can present both methods but choose one as the final answer. However, since in the problem statement, there is no indication, perhaps the user expects the expanded form.Alternatively, let&#39;s check online. If I search for the integral of (2x +3)^2 dx, what do standard integral calculators show? Let me think. For example, according to integral calculators, they might show both forms. But often, they present the expanded form. Alternatively, if you use substitution, they might show the factored form. But since (2x +3)^3 /6 is a compact form, it&#39;s also acceptable.But given that the original integrand is a quadratic, expanding gives a cubic polynomial which is straightforward. Therefore, in educational contexts, expanding might be preferred here unless substitution is specifically required.But since the problem is given as Example 1, which is a simple example, expanding is probably the way to go. Therefore, the answer would be (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +C.So to recap:First, expand (2x +3)^2 to 4x² +12x +9.Then integrate term by term:∫4x² dx = (4/3)x³,∫12x dx = 6x²,∫9 dx =9x.Sum them up and add C.Therefore, the final answer is (4/3)x³ +6x² +9x +C.Alternatively, using substitution gives (2x +3)^3 /6 +C, which is also correct but in a different form.Given the ambiguity, but given that expanding is more elementary and often expected for lower-level problems, I will present the expanded form as the final answer.Final AnswerThe indefinite integral is boxed{dfrac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the indefinite integral (int(2x + 3)^2 , dx), we start by expanding the integrand:[(2x + 3)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2 cdot (2x) cdot 3 + 3^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9]Next, we integrate each term separately:1. The integral of (4x^2) is:   [   int 4x^2 , dx = frac{4}{3}x^3   ]2. The integral of (12x) is:   [   int 12x , dx = 6x^2   ]3. The integral of (9) is:   [   int 9 , dx = 9x   ]Combining these results and adding the constant of integration (C), we get:[int(2x + 3)^2 , dx = frac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C]Thus, the indefinite integral is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to find the indefinite integral of (2x + 3) squared with respect to x. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling that an indefinite integral is basically the antiderivative, right? So I need to find a function whose derivative is (2x + 3)^2. First, maybe I should expand the squared term to make it easier to integrate. Let me try that. If I expand (2x + 3)^2, that should be (2x)^2 + 2*(2x)*(3) + 3^2. Calculating each term:(2x)^2 is 4x², then 2*(2x)*(3) is 12x, and 3^2 is 9. So altogether, when expanded, the integrand becomes 4x² + 12x + 9. Okay, so now the integral becomes the integral of 4x² + 12x + 9 dx. That seems more straightforward. Now I can integrate each term separately. Let&#39;s break it down term by term.Starting with the first term: integral of 4x² dx. The integral of x² is (1/3)x³, so multiplying by 4 gives (4/3)x³. Next term: integral of 12x dx. The integral of x is (1/2)x², so multiplying by 12 gives 6x². Last term: integral of 9 dx. The integral of a constant is the constant times x, so that&#39;s 9x. Putting it all together, the integral should be (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C, where C is the constant of integration. Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another way to do this without expanding? Like using substitution? Let me check. If I let u = 2x + 3, then du/dx = 2, so du = 2 dx, which means dx = du/2. Then the integral becomes ∫ u² * (du/2). That would be (1/2) ∫ u² du. The integral of u² is (1/3)u³, so multiplying by 1/2 gives (1/6)u³ + C. Substituting back, that&#39;s (1/6)(2x + 3)³ + C. Wait, but hold on, this answer is different from the one I got before. Which one is correct? Did I make a mistake somewhere?Let me check both methods. Let&#39;s compute the derivative of both results and see if they match the original integrand.First method&#39;s result: (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. Taking derivative term by term:Derivative of (4/3)x³ is 4x².Derivative of 6x² is 12x.Derivative of 9x is 9.Derivative of C is 0.So total derivative is 4x² + 12x + 9, which is exactly the expanded integrand. That checks out.Second method&#39;s result: (1/6)(2x + 3)³ + C. Let&#39;s take the derivative here. Using the chain rule:Derivative of (1/6)(2x + 3)³ is (1/6)*3*(2x + 3)²*2. Simplify that: (1/6)*3*2*(2x + 3)² = (6/6)*(2x + 3)² = (2x + 3)². Which is the original integrand. So that also checks out. Hmm, so both methods are correct? But they look different. Wait, maybe they are equivalent expressions? Let me expand the second result to see if it simplifies to the first one.Expanding (1/6)(2x + 3)³:First, expand (2x + 3)³. Let&#39;s compute that:(2x + 3)³ = (2x)^3 + 3*(2x)^2*3 + 3*(2x)*(3)^2 + (3)^3= 8x³ + 3*4x²*3 + 3*2x*9 + 27= 8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27Multiply by 1/6:(8x³)/6 + (36x²)/6 + (54x)/6 + 27/6Simplify each term:8/6 x³ = 4/3 x³36/6 x² = 6x²54/6 x = 9x27/6 = 9/2Wait, so that would be (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + 9/2 + C. Wait, but in the first method, I had (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. But here, there&#39;s an extra 9/2. That&#39;s confusing. But hold on, when we do substitution, the constants can be absorbed into the constant of integration. So the 9/2 would be part of the constant C. So actually, both answers are equivalent except for the constant term, which is why when taking derivatives, the constants disappear, and both derivatives match the original integrand. Therefore, both methods are correct, and the difference is just in the constant term. However, when we expanded the substitution method, we ended up with (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + 9/2 + C, which is the same as the first answer plus 9/2. But in the first answer, the constant C is arbitrary, so the 9/2 can be included in the constant. Therefore, the substitution method gives a specific antiderivative, and the expansion method gives another antiderivative which differs by a constant. Both are correct because the constant of integration can absorb that difference. But when writing the answer, the substitution method gives a more compact form, whereas the expansion method is more expanded. Depending on what&#39;s required, both are acceptable. However, usually, unless specified, either form is correct, but sometimes they might prefer one over the other. Looking back at the problem statement, it just says &quot;Find the indefinite integral&quot;. Since both answers are correct, but maybe the question expects one form. Let me check if there&#39;s a standard way. In calculus, when integrating expressions like (ax + b)^n, substitution is often the recommended method because it&#39;s straightforward. However, expanding is also valid, especially if the exponent is small, like squared. Given that the original integrand is a perfect square, both methods work. However, if we follow substitution, the answer is (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C. If we expand, it&#39;s (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. Since the problem doesn&#39;t specify the form, either answer is acceptable. However, maybe the expanded form is more detailed in terms of polynomial terms, but the factored form is more concise. But let me check by expanding the substitution answer. Wait, when I expanded (1/6)(2x + 3)^3, I got (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + 9/2. But in the first method, integrating term by term gave 9x, not 9x + 9/2. Wait, so where did that 9/2 come from? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in expanding. Let&#39;s redo the expansion:(2x + 3)^3:First, (a + b)^3 = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³.So, a = 2x, b = 3.(2x)^3 = 8x³3*(2x)^2*3 = 3*4x²*3 = 36x²3*(2x)*(3)^2 = 3*2x*9 = 54x(3)^3 = 27So, altogether, 8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27. Then multiply by 1/6:8x³ /6 = 4/3 x³36x² /6 = 6x²54x /6 = 9x27 /6 = 4.5 = 9/2So, the substitution method gives 4/3 x³ + 6x² + 9x + 9/2 + C.But in the expansion method, integrating term by term gives 4/3 x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. So the difference is the constant term 9/2. But since the indefinite integral includes a constant of integration, C, then 9/2 can be combined with C. Therefore, both answers are equivalent. Therefore, depending on how you approach it, you can write the answer in either form. However, when you use substitution, you get the 9/2 term, but in the expansion method, you don&#39;t. But in reality, since the constant is arbitrary, both are correct. But the problem asks for the indefinite integral, so both forms are acceptable. However, perhaps the problem expects the expanded form. Let me check.In many calculus textbooks, when integrating polynomials, the expanded form is often preferred. Alternatively, if substitution is used, the unexpanded form is also acceptable. However, since (2x + 3)^3 is a cubic term, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the original binomial, so the substitution answer. But in the example, they might have expanded. Let me see. Wait, this is Example 1. So maybe in the example, they are showing the expansion method. Let me check how such problems are typically presented. But since this is an example, maybe the solution is provided as expanded. However, both answers are correct. Let me verify again by differentiating both results.First, substitution result: (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C. Derivative is (1/6)*3*(2x + 3)^2*2 = (6/6)(2x + 3)^2 = (2x + 3)^2. Correct.Expanded result: (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. Derivative is 4x² + 12x + 9, which is equal to (2x + 3)^2. Correct.Therefore, both answers are correct. But perhaps, depending on the approach. The problem didn&#39;t specify the method, so either is fine. But maybe in the context of an example, expanding would be the first method taught before substitution, so the answer might be presented in expanded form. Alternatively, if substitution is covered already, then the compact form is acceptable. Since the problem is presented as Example 1, which might be early in the integration chapter, maybe expanding is expected here. Alternatively, to check if there&#39;s a miscalculation in the substitution method. Wait, when you substitute, you have ∫(2x + 3)^2 dx. Let u = 2x + 3, du = 2 dx, so dx = du/2. Then ∫u²*(du/2) = (1/2) ∫u² du = (1/2)*(u³/3) + C = u³/6 + C = (2x + 3)^3 /6 + C. That&#39;s correct. But when expanding that, we get (8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27)/6 = (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + 4.5. But when integrating term by term, we have 9x, not 9x + 4.5. But 4.5 is a constant, so it&#39;s absorbed into the constant C. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent because the constants can be combined. So, in reality, the substitution method gives an answer that includes an explicit constant term (4.5) plus the arbitrary constant C, which together make a new constant. Therefore, both forms are correct. So, when writing the answer, you can present either one. However, if the problem is expecting the expanded form, then (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C is the answer. If substitution is allowed, then (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C is acceptable. Since the problem is phrased as &quot;Find the indefinite integral,&quot; and doesn&#39;t specify the method, both are correct. However, in many textbooks, when a substitution is straightforward, they might present the answer in the substituted form. But since expanding is also simple here, both are possible. But let&#39;s check if the user has a preference. Since the original problem is presented as Example 1, perhaps in a textbook chapter that is introducing integration, maybe before substitution, so expanding would be the method. Alternatively, substitution is taught early on as a method, so maybe either is okay. But given that (2x + 3)^2 is a quadratic, expanding is simple, and integrating term by term is straightforward, the expanded form might be the expected answer here. So, to conclude, the integral is either (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C or (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. Both are correct. But since the question is presented as Example 1, perhaps expecting a more elementary approach without substitution, the expanded form is the answer. But in some textbooks, substitution is introduced early, so maybe not. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe check by differentiating the substitution answer. Wait, as we saw, differentiating both gives the correct integrand. So both are correct. Therefore, since both are correct, but the problem is to &quot;find the indefinite integral,&quot; and there&#39;s no restriction on the form, either is acceptable. However, perhaps the most simplified expanded form is preferable here. Alternatively, the factored form is more elegant. But considering that the original function is a perfect square, and integrating via substitution gives a compact answer, that might be the better answer. However, in many cases, expanding is also considered correct. Since the user hasn&#39;t specified, and given that this is an example problem, I think both answers are correct, but maybe the user expects the expanded form. Alternatively, check standard integral tables. Wait, let me think again. If someone is just starting integration, they might expand the polynomial first. But once substitution is learned, that&#39;s a faster method. Given that, but since the problem is an example, perhaps the solution is presented in both ways. But since the user asks for the answer within a box, and given that both forms are correct, but different, perhaps I need to see if there&#39;s a standard. Alternatively, maybe compute both and see which is the same as standard integration. Alternatively, consult an integral calculator. Wait, let me compute the integral using an online calculator to check. [Imagining using an integral calculator]Okay, computing ∫(2x + 3)^2 dx. Result: (2x + 3)^3 / 6 + C. Expanding that gives (8x³ + 36x² + 54x + 27)/6 = (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + 4.5 + C. But if you compute via expansion: ∫(4x² + 12x + 9) dx = (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. So, these differ by 4.5. But since C is arbitrary, both are correct. But when presented in different forms, which one is considered standard? In indefinite integrals, constants can be any real number, so both forms are acceptable. However, the form (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C is more compact and might be preferable. But in some educational contexts, expanding is required to demonstrate understanding of integrating polynomials term by term. Given that this is labeled as Example 1, perhaps it&#39;s intended to practice expanding before using substitution. So the answer might be presented in expanded form. But since the problem is in the example, maybe the solution is presented both ways. However, the user hasn&#39;t specified. Given that, but since in the problem statement it&#39;s just asked to find the integral, both answers are correct. However, I need to check if there&#39;s any convention. In many calculus textbooks, when you can express the integral in a factored form that&#39;s simpler, they prefer that. So (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C is a neater answer. However, some instructors might prefer expanding to show all the steps. But as a student, if I were to answer this, I might do both methods and present both answers, but since the problem asks for the indefinite integral, either is acceptable. However, given that substitution gives a more compact answer, and expansion is more detailed, but since both are correct, but the problem is an example, perhaps the intended answer is the expanded form. Alternatively, maybe the substitution method is the expected one. But to resolve this, perhaps I should note that in substitution, the answer is (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C, which is equivalent to the expanded form plus a constant. Since constants are arbitrary, both are correct. But when we present the answer, we can write either form. However, if the problem is in a section before substitution is introduced, expanding is the way. If substitution is covered, then the substitution method is better. Assuming that this is a basic integration problem, perhaps early in the course, expanding is expected. But to be safe, maybe present both answers. Wait, but the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. So they expect a single answer. But how to decide? Let&#39;s think.If I were to follow the substitution method, the answer is (2x + 3)^3 /6 + C. If I expand, it&#39;s (4/3)x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. But in the problem statement, the original integrand is (2x + 3)^2. Depending on the textbook&#39;s pedagogical approach, if substitution is taught, then the first form is better. If not, the second. But since substitution is a fundamental technique, usually taught early, it&#39;s possible that the expected answer is the substituted form. Alternatively, let&#39;s check some references. For example, in Paul&#39;s Online Math Notes, when integrating functions like (2x + 3)^2, he uses substitution and writes the answer in terms of the substituted variable, then substitutes back. So the answer would be in the factored form. Similarly, in Stewart&#39;s Calculus, substitution is used for such integrals. Therefore, the answer is likely expected to be (1/6)(2x + 3)^3 + C. However, when I expanded, I got 4/3 x³ + 6x² + 9x + C. But both are correct, just different forms. But perhaps, to write the answer in the most simplified form, which is the factored form. Alternatively, if the problem is in a chapter before substitution, then expanded. But since the user hasn&#39;t specified, but given that substitution is a standard method, and the factored form is more concise, I think the answer is boxed{dfrac{(2x + 3)^3}{6} + C}. But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check with another method. Alternatively, we can use linear substitution. Let me confirm.Let u = 2x + 3. Then du/dx = 2 =&gt; dx = du/2.Thus, ∫(2x + 3)^2 dx = ∫u²*(du/2) = (1/2)*(u³/3) + C = u³/6 + C = (2x + 3)^3 /6 + C. Yes, correct. Therefore, the answer via substitution is (2x + 3)^3 /6 + C. But integrating by expanding also gives a valid answer, but with a different constant term. However, since constants are arbitrary, both are correct. But when asked for an indefinite integral, typically, you don&#39;t need to expand unless specified. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is boxed{dfrac{(2x + 3)^3}{6} + C}. Alternatively, if they want the expanded version, it&#39;s boxed{dfrac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + C}. But which one is correct? Since both are correct. But in calculus, usually, unless asked to expand, the factored form is preferred because it&#39;s more concise. However, in many introductory problems, especially when learning to integrate polynomials, expanding is expected. But since (2x + 3)^2 is a binomial square, integrating via substitution is straightforward and the factored form is compact. Given that this is Example 1, it might be intended to demonstrate the substitution method. Therefore, the answer is likely boxed{dfrac{(2x + 3)^3}{6} + C}. But to ensure, let me check a standard integral table or solution. For ∫(ax + b)^n dx, the integral is (ax + b)^{n+1}/(a(n+1)) + C, provided n ≠ -1. Here, a = 2, b = 3, n = 2. So applying the formula: (2x + 3)^{3}/(2*3) + C = (2x + 3)^3 /6 + C. Yes, that&#39;s the standard formula result. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{dfrac{(2x + 3)^3}{6} + C}. Hence, even though expanding gives a different-looking answer, the standard formula and substitution method give the factored form, which is more concise and likely the expected answer here.&lt;/think&gt;To find the indefinite integral (int(2x + 3)^2 , dx), we can use the substitution method. 1. Substitution: Let (u = 2x + 3). Then, (du = 2 , dx) which implies (dx = frac{du}{2}).2. Rewrite the integral: Substitute (u) and (dx) into the integral:   [   int(2x + 3)^2 , dx = int u^2 cdot frac{du}{2} = frac{1}{2} int u^2 , du   ]3. Integrate: The integral of (u^2) is (frac{u^3}{3}):   [   frac{1}{2} cdot frac{u^3}{3} + C = frac{u^3}{6} + C   ]4. Substitute back: Replace (u) with (2x + 3):   [   frac{(2x + 3)^3}{6} + C   ]Thus, the indefinite integral is (boxed{dfrac{(2x + 3)^3}{6} + C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ddfc8c3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>🔑:</span>Solution.

The growth of China&#39;s population is gradually slowing down. The number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).A: 0.14126times 10^{6}B: 1.4126times 10^{5}C: 1.4126times 10^{3}D: 14.126times 10^{4}</div><div class="divider" data-v-2ddfc8c3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is asking to express the number 141,260 million in scientific notation and choose the correct option from A to D. Hmm, first I need to make sure I understand the question properly. Wait, the number given is 141,260 million. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Is that 141,260 times a million? Because &quot;million&quot; is 10^6, right? So 141,260 million would be 141,260 multiplied by 1,000,000. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a comma misplaced? Let me read the original problem again. It says, &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as...&quot; Hmm. So the number is written as 141,260 million. So, first, how do I parse that? In some countries, commas are used as thousand separators, but in others, they might denote decimals. But given that this is about China&#39;s population, which is in the billions, 141,260 million would actually make sense because 1,000 million is a billion. So 141,260 million is 141,260 times 1,000,000. Let me compute that.So 141,260 million is 141,260 × 10^6. Let me write that out numerically. 141,260 is 141,260. So multiplying by 10^6 would be adding six zeros. So 141,260 × 10^6 = 141,260,000,000. Let me count the digits. 141,260 is 6 digits, then multiplied by a million adds 6 zeros, so total 12 digits. So 141,260,000,000. Wait, but 141,260 million is equal to 141.26 billion, right? Because a billion is 1,000 million. So 141,260 divided by 1,000 is 141.26, so that&#39;s 141.26 billion. But the options given are in scientific notation. Let me check the options again.Option A: 0.14126 × 10^6. That would be 0.14126 multiplied by 1,000,000, which is 141,260. But the original number is 141,260 million, which is way larger. So that&#39;s probably not right.Option B: 1.4126 × 10^5. That is 1.4126 × 100,000, which is 141,260. Again, same as A, but different exponent. Wait, but the original number is 141,260 million, which is 141,260 multiplied by a million. So both A and B are giving the value of 141,260, not 141,260 million. So maybe the confusion is in the commas. Let me check if perhaps the original number was written with a comma as a decimal separator?Wait, the problem states: &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as...&quot; So if the number is 141,260 million, and commas are thousand separators, then 141,260 is 141 thousand 260, which is 141,260. But if in some notation commas are used as decimal points, but that&#39;s more common in Europe, but in China? I think in China they might follow the international standard where comma is a thousand separator. So 141,260 is 141 thousand 260. Then million is 10^6, so 141,260 million is 141,260 × 10^6. So let&#39;s compute that.141,260 × 10^6. Let&#39;s convert 141,260 into scientific notation first. 141,260 is 1.4126 × 10^5, because you move the decimal point five places to the left. So 1.4126 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^(5+6) = 1.4126 × 10^11. Wait, but none of the options go up to 10^11. Wait, hold on. Let me check the options again.Wait, the options are:A: 0.14126×10^6B: 1.4126×10^5C: 1.4126×10^3D: 14.126×10^4Hmm, none of these are 10^11. So clearly, there&#39;s a misunderstanding here. Maybe the original number is not 141,260 million, but 1412.60 million? Wait, the problem statement says: &quot;the total population of the country at the end of 2021 was 1,412.60 million&quot;. Wait, let me check again. The user wrote: &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).&quot; But according to the problem statement, the total population is 1,412.60 million. Wait, that&#39;s probably a decimal point. So 1,412.60 million. So 1,412.60 million is equal to 1,412.60 × 10^6. Which is 1.41260 × 10^3 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^9. But that&#39;s not any of the options either. Wait, this is confusing.Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s parse the original problem statement again carefully. The user says:&quot;On January 17, 2022, the State Council Information Office announced that the total population of the country at the end of 2021 was 1,412.60 million, an increase of 480,000 from the end of the previous year. The growth of China&#39;s population is gradually slowing down. The number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).&quot;Wait, so there seems to be a discrepancy here. The announced population is 1,412.60 million (which is 1.4126 billion), but then the question refers to &quot;the number 141,260 million&quot;. Wait, 141,260 million is 141,260 × 10^6 = 141.26 × 10^9 = 141.26 billion, which is way larger than China&#39;s population. But China&#39;s population was given as 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 billion. So 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 × 10^3 million. Because 1,412.60 is 1.4126 × 10^3. Then 1.4126 × 10^3 million is equal to 1.4126 × 10^3 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^9. But the options given do not have 10^9. So perhaps there is a typo in the problem statement.But the problem says: &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).&quot; Wait, 141,260 million. If we take 141,260 as a number, which is 141,260, then million is 10^6. So 141,260 × 10^6. Let&#39;s convert this to scientific notation. First, 141,260 is equal to 1.4126 × 10^5 (since moving the decimal point five places to the left gives 1.4126). So 1.4126 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^(5+6) = 1.4126 × 10^11. But none of the options are 10^11. The options given are:A: 0.14126×10^6 (which is 1.4126 × 10^5)B: 1.4126×10^5C: 1.4126×10^3D: 14.126×10^4 (which is 1.4126 × 10^5)Wait, so both A and D, when converted, are equal to B. Because 0.14126 × 10^6 is 141,260, and 14.126 × 10^4 is also 141,260. So options A, B, D all represent 141,260. Option C is 1.4126 × 10^3 which is 1,412.6. But the problem states that the number is 141,260 million. So if the number is 141,260 million, that is 141,260 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11. But none of the options are that. So perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the number is actually 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9, but again, that&#39;s not in the options. Wait, but in the problem statement, they first mention 1,412.60 million, and then refer to &quot;the number 141,260 million&quot;. Maybe there&#39;s a typo? Like instead of 1,412.60 million, it&#39;s written as 141,260 million?Wait, 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 billion. But 141,260 million is 141.26 billion. That&#39;s a hundred times larger. Since China&#39;s population is around 1.4 billion, 141.26 billion is impossible. Therefore, I think there&#39;s a mistake in the problem. It&#39;s likely that the number should be 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9, but since that&#39;s not an option, maybe the comma is misplaced. Let me check the options again.Wait, the options B is 1.4126 × 10^5. If we take the original number as 141,260 million, which is 141,260 × 10^6, but if they actually meant 141.260 million, which is 141.26 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^8. Still not in the options. Alternatively, maybe the number is 1412.60 million without the comma, which would be 1412.60 million = 1.4126 × 10^9. Still not in the options. Alternatively, maybe the number 141,260 million is written with a comma as a decimal separator. In some countries, like in Europe, they use commas as decimal separators. So 141,260 million would be 141.260 million. Then that would be 141.260 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^8. Again, not matching the options.Wait, but the options given are all in the range of 10^3 to 10^5. So maybe the problem is not asking about 141,260 million, but 141,260 as the population number? But 141,260 is way too small for a country&#39;s population. So that can&#39;t be. Alternatively, perhaps the number is 141.260 million, written with a comma as a decimal, so 141.260 million is 141,260 thousand. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.Wait, going back to the original problem statement. The announced population is 1,412.60 million. Then the question refers to &quot;the number 141,260 million&quot;. Maybe there&#39;s a missing decimal point. If it&#39;s 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 billion, then converting that to scientific notation is 1.4126 × 10^9. But since the options don&#39;t have that, maybe the problem is written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the number is 141,260 thousand? If it&#39;s 141,260 thousand, then that would be 141,260 × 10^3 = 141,260,000 = 1.4126 × 10^8. Still not matching.Wait, looking at the options again:A: 0.14126×10^6 = 141,260B: 1.4126×10^5 = 141,260C: 1.4126×10^3 = 1,412.6D: 14.126×10^4 = 141,260So options A, B, and D all equal 141,260. Option C is 1,412.6. But the problem says the number is 141,260 million, which is 141,260,000,000. So none of the options match. Unless the problem has a typo, and instead of 141,260 million, it&#39;s 141.260 million. If that&#39;s the case, 141.260 million is 141,260,000, which is 1.4126 × 10^8, still not in the options. Alternatively, if the number is 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9, which is not in the options. Alternatively, maybe the number given in the problem is just 141,260, not 141,260 million. If that&#39;s the case, then 141,260 in scientific notation is 1.4126 × 10^5, which is option B. But the problem explicitly says &quot;the number 141,260 million&quot;, so that&#39;s supposed to be 141,260 million. But then the answer isn&#39;t there. Wait, is there a chance that in the Chinese numbering system, the comma is used differently? For example, in some countries, a comma separates every three digits, but in others, like India, they use commas differently. However, China typically uses the international system where each comma separates three digits. So 141,260 would be 141 thousand 260. Alternatively, maybe the number is written as 1412,60 million, using a comma as a decimal separator. For example, in some European countries, they write 1.412,60 million as 1 thousand 412.60 million. Wait, but that would be 1.412,60 million = 1.41260 × 10^3 million = 1.4126 × 10^3 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^9, same as before.Given all this confusion, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the problem. However, considering the options given, and if we assume that the number is actually 141,260 (without the million), then the answer is B. But the problem says &quot;141,260 million&quot;. Alternatively, maybe &quot;141,260 million&quot; is a mistranslation or a misprint, and the correct number is 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9. But since none of the options have 10^9, perhaps the question is to express 1,412.60 million in scientific notation, but written as 1.4126 × 10^3 million? Wait, 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 × 10^3 million. If we consider that &quot;million&quot; is 10^6, then 1.4126 × 10^3 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^9. But again, not in the options.Wait, let&#39;s check the options again:A: 0.14126×10^6 = 141,260B: 1.4126×10^5 = 141,260C: 1.4126×10^3 = 1,412.6D: 14.126×10^4 = 141,260So all options except C are equal to 141,260. But if the problem is asking for 141,260 million, which is 141,260 × 10^6, then none of the options are correct. However, if the problem is asking for 141,260 (not million), then the answer is B. But given that the original population number was 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9, there might be a disconnect between the problem statement and the options.Alternatively, maybe the number 141,260 million is supposed to be 141.260 million. If written with a comma as a decimal separator, 141,260 million would be 141.260 million, which is 141,260,000, or 1.4126 × 10^8. Still not in the options. Wait, another approach: perhaps the number 141,260 million is written with a comma as a thousand separator, so it&#39;s 141,260 million, which is 141,260 × 10^6. Then, converting 141,260 × 10^6 into scientific notation. 141,260 is 1.4126 × 10^5, so 1.4126 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11. But none of the options are that. However, maybe they want it expressed in millions? So 141,260 million is 141,260 × 10^6, but expressing it as x × 10^k million. So 141,260 million is 1.4126 × 10^5 million. So in terms of millions, it&#39;s 1.4126 × 10^5. So that would be option B. But the question says &quot;expressed in scientific notation&quot;, which typically requires a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10. But if you express 141,260 million as 1.4126 × 10^5 million, then technically, the unit is million, so it&#39;s 1.4126 × 10^5 million. But in terms of absolute numbers, that would be 1.4126 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11. However, the options don&#39;t have 10^11.Alternatively, if the question is just asking for the number 141,260 expressed in scientific notation, disregarding the &quot;million&quot; part, then the answer is B. But the problem states &quot;the number 141,260 million&quot;, which includes the &quot;million&quot;. So maybe the &quot;million&quot; is a unit, and they just want the coefficient in scientific notation. For example, expressing 141,260 million people as 1.4126 × 10^5 million people. If that&#39;s the case, then option B is correct. But in standard scientific notation, the entire number should be expressed as a single coefficient multiplied by a power of ten, without appending units like million. So 141,260 million is 1.4126 × 10^11, which is not an option. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem.But given the options, and considering that the original population was 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9, but none of the options match. However, looking at the options, B is 1.4126 × 10^5, which is 141,260. If we take the number 141,260 and express it in scientific notation, it&#39;s B. But since the problem mentions &quot;million&quot;, it&#39;s unclear. Maybe the problem is incorrectly formulated. Alternatively, the number 141,260 million is a typo, and it should be 1,412.60 million. If that&#39;s the case, converting 1,412.60 million into scientific notation: 1,412.60 million = 1.41260 × 10^3 million = 1.41260 × 10^3 × 10^6 = 1.41260 × 10^9. But again, not in the options.Wait, but the options given are:A: 0.14126×10^6 = 1.4126×10^5B: 1.4126×10^5C: 1.4126×10^3D:14.126×10^4 =1.4126×10^5So options A, B, D are the same, and C is different.But if the correct answer is supposed to be 1.4126 ×10^3 (option C), that&#39;s 1,412.6. But 1,412.6 million is 1.4126 billion, which is the population figure given. So maybe the problem is asking to express 1,412.60 million in scientific notation, but written as 1.4126 ×10^3 million, which would be option C. Wait, 1,412.60 million is equal to 1.4126 ×10^3 million. If we consider million as the unit, then 1.4126 ×10^3 million is correct. But in standard scientific notation, we would convert the entire number without the unit. So 1,412.60 million is 1,412.60 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^9, which is 1.4126 ×10^9. But none of the options have 10^9. However, if the question is asking to express the number in terms of millions, then it&#39;s 1.4126 ×10^3 (million), which is option C. So perhaps that&#39;s the intended answer. But this is a bit ambiguous because scientific notation typically requires the entire number, not keeping the &quot;million&quot; as a unit. But since the original population is given as 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 ×10^3 million, then if the question is asking to express 1,412.60 million (i.e., the population) in scientific notation, considering &quot;million&quot; as a unit, then the answer would be 1.4126 ×10^3 million, which is option C. But this is non-standard because usually, scientific notation would express the full number without the unit. However, given the options and the context, maybe that&#39;s what the question is expecting. Alternatively, if we take the number as 141,260 million (which is incorrect for China&#39;s population), and express it in scientific notation, it would be 1.4126 ×10^5 million, which is option B. But this would be 1.4126 ×10^5 million = 1.4126 ×10^11 people, which is way too high. But since the options don&#39;t have 10^11, but option B is 1.4126 ×10^5, which is 141,260. If we disregard the &quot;million&quot;, then the answer is B. But the problem explicitly mentions &quot;million&quot;.This is quite confusing. Considering the problem might have a typo, and the intended number is 1,412.60 million (the announced population), which is 1.4126 ×10^9, but since this isn&#39;t an option, and option C is 1.4126 ×10^3, which is 1,412.6, perhaps they just want 1,412.60 million written as 1.4126 ×10^3 million, hence option C. Even though this isn&#39;t standard, it&#39;s possible that the question is formulated this way. Alternatively, maybe the number is 141,260 (without the million), so 141,260 is 1.4126 ×10^5, which is option B. Since the problem statement originally mentions that the total population was 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 billion, but the question is about expressing 141,260 million. If there&#39;s an extra zero in the question, making it 141,260 million instead of 1,412.60 million, then 141,260 million is incorrect. However, given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B. Alternatively, considering that all options except C evaluate to 141,260, which is the coefficient before million, but the problem mentions &quot;million&quot;, so if you write 141,260 million as 1.4126 ×10^5 million, which is option B. If the question is just asking for the coefficient in scientific notation, then B is correct. But usually, in scientific notation, you don&#39;t keep the unit. So this is a bit ambiguous.Given the confusion, but since the original population is 1,412.60 million, and the options include 1.4126 ×10^3 (option C), which is 1,412.6, matching the 1,412.60 million figure if we drop the &quot;million&quot; unit. So maybe the question is intended to express 1,412.60 million as 1.4126 ×10^3, ignoring the &quot;million&quot; part, which would be option C. However, this is not correct because 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 ×10^9. Alternatively, there&#39;s a misunderstanding in the use of commas. If the number is 141,260 million, using the comma as a thousand separator, it&#39;s 141,260 million = 141.260 billion. But since China&#39;s population is around 1.4 billion, this can&#39;t be. Therefore, the problem must have a typo. The correct number should be 1,412.60 million, and the options are supposed to reflect that. If we write 1,412.60 million in scientific notation as 1.4126 ×10^3 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^9, but none of the options have that. Alternatively, if they just want the coefficient before the million in scientific notation, then 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 ×10^3 million, which is option C. Given that, and considering the options, even though it&#39;s non-standard, option C might be the intended answer. But I need to check the options again. Option C is 1.4126 ×10^3. If that&#39;s in millions, then it&#39;s 1.4126 ×10^3 million = 1.4126 ×10^9, which is correct. So maybe the question is using &quot;million&quot; as a unit, and expressing the number as 1.4126 ×10^3 million. In that case, option C is correct. This is a bit unconventional, but possible.Alternatively, if the problem is in Chinese, the translation might have issues. Given the options, and the original population figure, I think the intended answer is option B, but I&#39;m really confused. However, the original population is 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 ×10^3 million. If we write that as 1.4126 ×10^3, that&#39;s option C. Therefore, I think the answer is option B or C. But since the options A, B, D all give 141,260, which is the coefficient if you take 141,260 million. If we consider the question has a typo, and it should be 1,412.60 million instead of 141,260 million, then 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 ×10^3 million, which is option C. Therefore, despite the confusion, I think the answer is C. But I&#39;m not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the number is 141,260 million, the correct scientific notation is 1.4126 ×10^11, which is not an option, so the problem is flawed.But given the options, and the original figure mentioned in the problem statement (1,412.60 million), maybe the answer is C. Therefore, after this long thought process, I think the answer is B or C. Wait, let me check again. If the number is 141,260 million, that&#39;s 141,260 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^11, which is not an option. If the number is 1,412.60 million, that&#39;s 1.4126 ×10^9, also not an option. If the number is 141,260 (without the million), then it&#39;s B. But the problem says &quot;141,260 million&quot;. Therefore, the problem is either wrong, or the answer is not listed. But since the options are given, and the original population is 1,412.60 million, which is written as 1.4126 ×10^3 thousand, perhaps the answer is C. So I&#39;ll go with option B... wait, no. 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 ×10^3 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^9. But if you write 1,412.60 million in terms of million, it&#39;s 1.4126 ×10^3 million. So if the question is asking to express 1,412.60 million in scientific notation, considering the unit as million, then it&#39;s 1.4126 ×10^3, which is option C. Therefore, the answer is C. But I need to verify once more.Yes, if you take &quot;million&quot; as the unit, then 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 ×10^3 million. So in scientific notation, it&#39;s 1.4126 ×10^3. Therefore, option C. So even though it&#39;s unconventional to keep the &quot;million&quot; unit in scientific notation, if the question is framed that way, then C is correct. Hence, after careful consideration, I think the intended answer is C.Final Answerboxed{B}Wait, no, this contradicts my last conclusion. Wait, why did I put B? Let me check again.Wait, in the problem statement, the announced population is 1,412.60 million. Then the question is about the number 141,260 million. If there&#39;s a missing decimal, like 1,412.60 million is written as 141,260 million (with an extra zero), then 141,260 million is 141.26 billion, which is incorrect. But the options do not have 10^11. If the problem is to express 1,412.60 million in scientific notation, then 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 ×10^9, which isn&#39;t an option. But if we consider that they want it in terms of millions, so 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 ×10^3 million, then 1.4126 ×10^3 is option C. So answer C. But I initially thought B, but in the final conclusion, I thought C. However, the system says I put B. Let me correct.Wait, the user initially in the problem mentions &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as&quot;. If it&#39;s 141,260 million, that is 141,260 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^11. Not an option. However, if we parse 141,260 million as 141,260,000,000, and we need to write it in scientific notation, the correct form is 1.4126 ×10^11. Since this isn&#39;t an option, but there&#39;s likely a typo. However, the original population is 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 ×10^9. If the problem mistyped 141,260 million instead of 1,412.60 million, then expressing 1,412.60 million as 1.4126 ×10^3 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^9, which is not present. But maybe the question is to write 1,412.60 in scientific notation, which is 1.4126 ×10^3, option C. Given the problem&#39;s options, and the context, the answer is likely C. But the assistant initially concluded B, but in the thought process leaned towards C. Due to the confusion in the problem statement, but based on the original population number (1,412.60 million), the answer should be C. Therefore, the correct final answer is boxed{C}.Final Answerboxed{B}Wait, now I&#39;m really confused. The user&#39;s original problem states: &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).&quot; The options are A to D. The correct way to write 141,260 million in scientific notation is 1.4126 ×10^11, but that&#39;s not an option. However, if we interpret 141,260 million as 141,260 ×10^6, then breaking down 141,260: 141,260 = 1.4126 ×10^5. Therefore, 141,260 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^5 ×10^6 = 1.4126 ×10^11. Still not an option. If the problem is asking for 141,260 written in scientific notation (without the million), then it&#39;s 1.4126 ×10^5, option B. But the problem includes the &quot;million&quot;. Therefore, unless the &quot;million&quot; is a red herring, and the question is just about the number 141,260, then B is correct. However, given the problem statement&#39;s mention of population in millions, it&#39;s more likely that the million is part of the number. But the options don&#39;t have 10^11. Therefore, the problem is flawed, but the closest possible answer, assuming a typo where &quot;million&quot; shouldn&#39;t be there, is B. Hence, the answer is boxed{B}.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The problem asks to express the number 141,260 million in scientific notation. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:1. Understanding the Number: The number given is 141,260 million. This means 141,260 multiplied by 1,000,000 (10^6).2. Converting to Scientific Notation:   - First, convert 141,260 to scientific notation: (141,260 = 1.4126 times 10^5).   - Then, multiply by (10^6) (since it&#39;s 141,260 million): (1.4126 times 10^5 times 10^6 = 1.4126 times 10^{11}).3. Checking the Options: None of the options provided match (1.4126 times 10^{11}).4. Re-evaluating the Problem: The original problem might have a typo or misinterpretation. The announced population is 1,412.60 million, which is (1.4126 times 10^9), but this is not an option either.5. Considering Possible Errors: If the &quot;million&quot; part is mistakenly included, converting 141,260 to scientific notation directly gives (1.4126 times 10^5), which is option B.Given the confusion and potential errors in the problem statement, the closest correct answer based on the options provided is:boxed{B},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out how to express the number 141,260 million in scientific notation and choose the correct option from A to D. Let me start by recalling what scientific notation is. Scientific notation is a way to write very large or very small numbers more conveniently. It has the form a × 10^b, where a is a number between 1 and 10 (not including 10), and b is an integer.First, let me parse the given number. The problem states &quot;141,260 million.&quot; Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Is it 141,260 followed by &quot;million,&quot; or is the number 141,260 million? Let me check the original statement again. The Chinese population at the end of 2021 was 1,412.60 million. Wait, the original number is written as 1,412.60 million. So that would be 1,412.60 million people. But in the problem statement, it says &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as...&quot; Hmm, maybe there&#39;s a comma used as a decimal separator here? Because 1,412.60 million would be 1.4126 billion, but the problem states 141,260 million. Wait, 141,260 million is 141,260 × 10^6, right?Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a confusion in the way the numbers are presented. Let me clarify. The original announcement was in Chinese, and sometimes commas and periods are used differently in different countries. But in the problem statement, it&#39;s written as &quot;141,260 million&quot;. So 141,260 million is 141,260 followed by a million. Let&#39;s convert that to a numerical value.First, 1 million is 10^6. So 141,260 million is 141,260 × 10^6. Let me compute that. 141,260 × 10^6. Let&#39;s write that out. 141,260 is 1.4126 × 10^5 (since moving the decimal four places to the left gives 1.4126 × 10^5). Then multiplying by 10^6 gives 1.4126 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^(5+6) = 1.4126 × 10^11. Wait, but the answer options given are different. Let me check the answer options again:A: 0.14126×10^6B: 1.4126×10^5C: 1.4126×10^3D: 14.126×10^4Wait, none of these are 10^11. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the original number. Let me go back.The problem states: &quot;The number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).&quot; Wait, but 141,260 million is 141,260,000,000. Because 1 million is 1,000,000, so 141,260 million is 141,260 × 1,000,000 = 141,260,000,000. Now, let&#39;s express 141,260,000,000 in scientific notation.To convert a number to scientific notation, we move the decimal point so that there&#39;s only one non-zero digit to the left of the decimal. The original number is 141,260,000,000. The decimal point is after the last zero, so we need to move it to the left until there&#39;s only one digit before the decimal. Let&#39;s count the places:Starting from 141,260,000,000., moving the decimal to the left:1. Move once: 14,126,000,000.0 × 10^12. Move again: 1,412,600,000.00 × 10^23. Move again: 141,260,000.000 × 10^34. Move again: 14,126,000.0000 × 10^45. Move again: 1,412,600.00000 × 10^56. Move again: 141,260.000000 × 10^67. Move again: 14,126.0000000 × 10^78. Move again: 1,412.60000000 × 10^89. Move again: 141.260000000 × 10^910. Move again: 14.1260000000 × 10^1011. Move again: 1.41260000000 × 10^11So after moving 11 places, we get 1.4126 × 10^11. But none of the answer choices have 10^11. Wait, so maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement or in the options? Let me check again.Wait, in the original problem statement, it says &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).&quot; So 141,260 million. Let&#39;s confirm: 141,260 million is 141,260 times 1 million. 1 million is 10^6, so 141,260 × 10^6. Then 141,260 is equal to 1.4126 × 10^5. Therefore, 1.4126 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11. So the correct scientific notation is 1.4126 × 10^11. But the options given are:A: 0.14126×10^6 = 1.4126×10^5B: 1.4126×10^5C: 1.4126×10^3D: 14.126×10^4 = 1.4126×10^5Wait, options A and D also evaluate to 1.4126×10^5 when simplified. So A is 0.14126×10^6, which is the same as 1.4126×10^5. Similarly, D is 14.126×10^4, which is 1.4126×10^5. So options A, B, and D all simplify to 1.4126×10^5, and option C is 1.4126×10^3. But according to my calculation, the correct scientific notation is 1.4126×10^11, which is not among the options. This suggests that there might be a misinterpretation here.Wait, maybe the original number is not 141,260 million, but 1,412.60 million? The problem statement says: &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed...&quot; Wait, but in the initial paragraph, it&#39;s mentioned that the total population was 1,412.60 million. Wait, 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 billion, which is 1,412,600,000. So 1.4126 × 10^9. But that&#39;s still not matching the answer options.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a confusion in the way the number is presented. Let&#39;s check the original problem again.Original problem: On January 17, 2022, the State Council Information Office announced that the total population of the country at the end of 2021 was 1,412.60 million, an increase of 480,000 from the end of the previous year. The growth of China&#39;s population is gradually slowing down. The number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( ).Wait, so the total population is 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 billion. Then the problem refers to &quot;the number 141,260 million.&quot; But 141,260 million is 141.26 billion, which is way larger than the population of China. So this seems inconsistent. Perhaps there&#39;s a typo? Maybe instead of 141,260 million, it should be 1,412.60 million?Alternatively, maybe the commas and periods are being used differently. In some countries, commas are used as decimal separators. But in the problem statement, they wrote &quot;1,412.60 million,&quot; which uses a comma as a thousand separator and a period as a decimal, which is the standard in English-speaking countries. So 1,412.60 million is 1,412.60 × 10^6 = 1.41260 × 10^9. But the problem then refers to &quot;the number 141,260 million,&quot; which is 141,260 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11. But that&#39;s not the population of China; that would be 141.26 billion, which is way too high.Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. The correct population figure is 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9. But this is not among the answer options. The options given are:A: 0.14126×10^6 = 1.4126×10^5 (which is 141,260)B: 1.4126×10^5 (which is 141,260)C: 1.4126×10^3 (which is 1,412.6)D: 14.126×10^4 = 1.4126×10^5 (same as A and B)Wait, so all options except C are equivalent to 1.4126×10^5. But 1.4126×10^5 is 141,260. But the original population was 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126×10^9. So none of the options match that. However, the problem states that &quot;the number 141,260 million&quot; needs to be converted. If we take that number as is, 141,260 million, which is 141,260 × 10^6, that&#39;s 1.4126 × 10^11. But that&#39;s not in the options. However, if there was a misplaced decimal, perhaps the correct number is 1,412.60 million (1.4126 × 10^9), but even that is not in the options.Alternatively, maybe the number is 141.260 million? That would be 141.26 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^8. Still not matching the options.Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly. If the original population is 1,412.60 million, then 1,412.60 million is equal to 1.4126 × 10^9. However, the problem mentions &quot;the number 141,260 million,&quot; which is 141,260 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11. Since the options don&#39;t include 10^11 or 10^9, perhaps the question is supposed to refer to 141.260 million? Let&#39;s check:141.260 million is 141.260 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^8. Still not matching the options.Wait, let&#39;s check the options again:A: 0.14126×10^6 = 1.4126×10^5 (141,260)B: 1.4126×10^5 (141,260)C: 1.4126×10^3 (1,412.6)D: 14.126×10^4 = 1.4126×10^5 (141,260)So all options except C are 141,260, and C is 1,412.6. The original population was 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126×10^9, but if someone mistakenly wrote 141,260 million instead of 1,412.60 million, then the number is way off. Alternatively, if the number is supposed to be 141,260 thousand, then it would be 141,260 × 10^3 = 1.4126 × 10^8, but that&#39;s also not in the options.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the increase of 480,000. The increase is 480,000 people. So 480,000 can be written as 4.8×10^5, but that&#39;s not related to the options either.Wait, this is very confusing. Let me try another approach. The problem states that the population is 1,412.60 million. In the problem statement, they then refer to the number &quot;141,260 million&quot;. Is there a discrepancy here? 1,412.60 million versus 141,260 million. If the comma is a thousand separator in &quot;141,260&quot;, then 141,260 million is 141,260 × 10^6 = 141,260,000,000 = 1.4126 × 10^11. But the original population is 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126 × 10^9. So there&#39;s a factor of 100 difference. It&#39;s possible that in the problem statement, &quot;141,260 million&quot; is a typo, and it should be &quot;1,412.60 million&quot;. If that&#39;s the case, then 1,412.60 million is 1.4126 × 10^9. However, none of the answer choices are that. Alternatively, if the number is 141,260 (without the million), then 141,260 is 1.4126 × 10^5, which matches options A, B, D. But in the problem statement, it&#39;s &quot;141,260 million&quot;. Unless &quot;million&quot; is a mistranslation or a unit error.Alternatively, maybe the number is supposed to be 141.260 million, written as 141,260 thousand. Wait, 141,260 thousand is 141,260 × 10^3 = 141,260,000 = 1.4126 × 10^8. Still not matching.Alternatively, the problem might have a mistake in the exponent. Let me check the answer options again:A: 0.14126×10^6 = 141,260B: 1.4126×10^5 = 141,260C: 1.4126×10^3 = 1,412.6D:14.126×10^4 = 141,260If the original number is 141,260 (not million), then the answer is B. But the problem says &quot;141,260 million&quot;. If there&#39;s an extra &quot;million&quot; in the problem statement by mistake, then B would be correct. Alternatively, if the number is 141.260 million, which is 141,260,000, then converting that to scientific notation: 1.4126 × 10^8. Not in the options.Wait, this is very confusing. Given that all options A, B, D are equivalent, and the original population was 1,412.60 million, which is 1.4126×10^9, but none of the options are close to that. The only other number mentioned is the increase of 480,000. 480,000 is 4.8×10^5, which is not related.Wait, the problem says: &quot;the number 141,260 million can be expressed in scientific notation as ( )&quot;. So regardless of the original population figure, we have to convert 141,260 million into scientific notation. Let&#39;s do that step by step.First, 1 million is 1,000,000 = 10^6.Therefore, 141,260 million = 141,260 × 10^6.Now, 141,260 is equal to 1.4126 × 10^5 (since we move the decimal four places to the left).Therefore, 141,260 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^(5+6) = 1.4126 × 10^11.But none of the answer options is 10^11. The options are 10^6, 10^5, 10^3, and 10^4. Therefore, there&#39;s a problem here. Either the question is wrong, or the answer options are wrong. Alternatively, maybe the number is not 141,260 million but 141.260 million? Let&#39;s check:141.260 million = 141.260 × 10^6 = 1.41260 × 10^8. Still not matching the options.Alternatively, 14.1260 million? That would be 1.4126 × 10^7. Still not there.Alternatively, maybe the number is written with a comma as a decimal separator? For example, in some countries, a comma is used instead of a period. So &quot;141,260 million&quot; might mean 141.260 million. But that would be 141.260 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^8. Still not matching.Alternatively, if &quot;141,260 million&quot; is supposed to be &quot;1,412.60 million&quot;, with the comma as a thousand separator and period as decimal, then 1,412.60 million is 1.41260 × 10^9. Not in options.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese and the number is presented differently. For example, in Chinese, numbers are sometimes counted in units of 10,000 (wan). So 1 wan is 10^4. But the problem mentions &quot;million&quot;, which is 10^6. Maybe there&#39;s a mistranslation?Alternatively, perhaps the number is 141,260, which is 1.4126 × 10^5, matching options B and D. If the &quot;million&quot; was added erroneously, then the correct answer would be B or D. But since B and D are the same as A when simplified, but A is written as 0.14126×10^6, which is not standard because in scientific notation, the coefficient should be between 1 and 10. Therefore, A is not correctly formatted. Similarly, D is 14.126×10^4, which is 1.4126×10^5, so D is also not properly formatted because 14.126 is not between 1 and 10. Therefore, the correct scientific notation is B: 1.4126×10^5. But this is only if the number is 141,260, not 141,260 million.But the problem explicitly states &quot;141,260 million&quot;. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options provided. This suggests that there&#39;s a mistake in the problem. However, given the options, and assuming that the &quot;million&quot; was a mistake, the correct answer would be B. Alternatively, if the number is written with a different decimal separator, perhaps 141,260 million is actually 1.41260 × 10^5 million, which would be 1.41260 × 10^5 × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11, but again, not in the options.Wait, but perhaps the question is not asking for the total population but the number 141,260 million, which is 141,260 × 10^6, and wants it converted into scientific notation. Let&#39;s do that:141,260 × 10^6 = (1.4126 × 10^5) × 10^6 = 1.4126 × 10^11. But again, this isn&#39;t an option. Therefore, unless there&#39;s a misunderstanding, perhaps the question is asking to express 141,260 in scientific notation, not 141,260 million. If that&#39;s the case, then 141,260 is 1.4126 × 10^5, which is option B.Given that all the answer options are much smaller than 10^11, and the original population was 1,412.60 million (which is 1.4126 × 10^9), but none of the options match, I suspect that the problem intended to ask about the number 141,260 (without the million), which would correspond to option B. This could be a translation error or a typo where &quot;million&quot; was added incorrectly.Alternatively, if we consider that in Chinese sometimes &#39;10 thousand&#39; is a unit, but the problem mentions &#39;million&#39;, which is 10^6. But even considering that, it doesn&#39;t align.Given the options provided, and assuming that the problem statement has an extra &quot;million&quot; by mistake, the correct answer would be B: 1.4126×10^5.Therefore, I think the intended answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To convert the number 141,260 million into scientific notation, we start by recognizing that 1 million is (10^6). Therefore, 141,260 million is (141,260 times 10^6).Next, we convert 141,260 into scientific notation. Moving the decimal point four places to the left, we get (1.4126 times 10^5).Combining this with (10^6), we have:[141,260 times 10^6 = 1.4126 times 10^5 times 10^6 = 1.4126 times 10^{11}]However, none of the answer choices match (10^{11}). Re-examining the problem, we consider the possibility of a typo or misinterpretation. The correct population figure mentioned is 1,412.60 million, which is (1.4126 times 10^9), but this is also not among the options.Given the answer choices, we consider if the &quot;million&quot; might be a mistake. Converting 141,260 (without the million) into scientific notation, we get:[141,260 = 1.4126 times 10^5]This matches option B. Despite the confusion with the unit &quot;million,&quot; the correct answer based on the provided options is:boxed{B}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ddfc8c3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>🔑:</span>To express the number 141,260 million in scientific notation, we first need to understand what scientific notation is. Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in decimal form. It is written as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.Given the number is 141,260 million, or more accurately, 141,260,000,000 when expanded, we can convert this into scientific notation by finding the appropriate power of 10 that the number can be divided by, to get a number between 1 and 10.Starting with the number 141,260,000,000:- We move the decimal point 8 places to the left (since the original number is in millions, and we further expand it to the full form), which gives us 1.4126. - Moving the decimal 8 places to the left means we are dividing by 10^{8}, but since the number is in millions (an additional 10^{6}), we actually divide by 10^{8-6} = 10^{2}, correcting the initial step to account for the million multiplier in the original number.- Therefore, the correct scientific notation is 1.4126 times 10^{8}, which accounts for the million multiplier correctly.However, the provided solution and options seem to misinterpret the magnitude of the original number, treating 141,260 million as 141,260 for the conversion into scientific notation. Following the provided solution closely, without adjusting for the million multiplier error:The number 141,260 (as interpreted in the solution) can be expressed in scientific notation by moving the decimal point 5 places to the left, which gives us 1.4126. Since we moved the decimal point 5 places, we multiply by 10^{5} to maintain the value of the number.Therefore, the correct expression in scientific notation, following the solution&#39;s interpretation, is 1.4126 times 10^{5}.So, the correct choice, according to the provided solution, is:boxed{B}: 1.4126times 10^{5}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-5aacd74b data-v-2ddfc8c3><div class="review" data-v-2ddfc8c3><div class="review-title" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>❓:</span>1. In a certain sports association, each team can choose at most t distinctive colors for their team uniforms.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Each team can pick up to t distinct colors for their uniforms. A set S of teams is color-identifiable if each team in S can be assigned one of their own colors such that no two teams in S share the same assigned color. So, essentially, we need to assign colors to teams in S such that each color is unique to a team. That sounds similar to a matching problem where colors are matched to teams without overlap.The question is asking for the maximum g(n, t) such that no matter how the teams choose their colors (as long as each team has at most t colors and the total number of distinct colors across all teams is exactly n), there will always be a color-identifiable set of size at least g(n, t). So we need a lower bound on the size of such a set that works for any possible configuration of team color choices under the given constraints.Let me think about some examples to get an intuition.Suppose t = 1. Then each team has only one color. In this case, the color-identifiable set would just be a set of teams where all their single colors are distinct. Since there are n colors in total, the maximum possible color-identifiable set is n. But since each team could be using the same color (but the problem states that all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors). Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors.&quot; So the union of all teams&#39; color sets is exactly n colors. So even if a team has multiple colors, the total number of distinct colors across all teams is exactly n.If t = 1, then each team has exactly one color, and since the total number of colors is n, there must be exactly n teams, each with a unique color. Therefore, the color-identifiable set is the entire set of teams, so g(n, 1) = n. But that seems trivial. Wait, but maybe if t = 1, each team can choose at most 1 color, so maybe there can be more than n teams? But if each team has at most 1 color and the total number of colors is n, then the number of teams can be at most n, each assigned a unique color. So in that case, the maximum color-identifiable set is n. But if the problem allows teams to share colors, but with t=1, then teams could share colors. Wait, no. Wait, each team can choose at most t colors. If t=1, each team has 1 color, but multiple teams can have the same color. However, the problem states that all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors. So the union of all teams&#39; color sets is n. So if t=1, each team has one color, and the union is n colors, so there must be at least n teams (each contributing a unique color). But actually, if you have more than n teams, then some colors must be repeated. Wait, but the problem says &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;. So the union is n. So if t=1, each team has one color, so the number of teams can be arbitrary, but the union of their colors is exactly n. Therefore, there must be at least one team for each color (since otherwise the union would have fewer colors). Wait, no. For example, if you have two teams, both with color red, then the union is just {red}, so n=1. But the problem states that the union is exactly n colors, so in that case, n=1, and t=1. Then the maximum color-identifiable set is 1, because both teams have color red, so you can only choose one team to assign red to, since assigning red to both would conflict. Therefore, in this case, with t=1, n=1, g(1,1)=1.Wait, so in general, if t=1, then each team has exactly one color, and the total number of colors is n. The maximum color-identifiable set is the maximum number of teams you can choose such that all their colors are distinct. But since the union is n colors, and each team has one color, the maximum such set is n. However, there could be multiple teams with the same color, but the problem states that in any sports association (i.e., any possible configuration of teams) with exactly n different colors, there must exist a color-identifiable set of size at least g(n, t). So if t=1, regardless of how the teams are arranged (they could all share the same color, but the problem says the union is exactly n colors. Wait, but if t=1, and the union is exactly n colors, then there must be at least one team for each color. Because otherwise, if a color is not used by any team, the union would be less than n. Therefore, each color must be used by at least one team. But multiple teams can share the same color. Therefore, the maximum color-identifiable set would be a set of teams with distinct colors, so since there are n colors, you can pick one team per color, hence size n. Therefore, g(n,1) = n.But if t is larger, say t=2. Then each team can choose up to 2 colors. The problem is to find the minimal g(n,2) such that no matter how the teams choose their colors (with each team having at most 2 colors, and the union of all colors is n), there exists a color-identifiable set of size at least g(n,2). So, we need to guarantee that regardless of the team color assignments, there is a set of g(n,2) teams where each can be assigned a unique color from their own color set.This seems related to graph theory. Maybe modeling this as a hypergraph where each team is a hyperedge containing its colors, and a color-identifiable set is a matching in this hypergraph. Wait, but a matching in a hypergraph is a set of hyperedges that are pairwise disjoint. But in this problem, a color-identifiable set is a set of teams (hyperedges) where each can be assigned a unique color, so that the assigned colors are all distinct. That&#39;s equivalent to choosing a set of hyperedges and a system of distinct representatives (SDR) for them. An SDR is a set of elements (colors) such that each element is chosen from a different set (team&#39;s color set), and all elements are distinct. So the problem reduces to finding, in any hypergraph where each hyperedge has size at most t and the total number of vertices is n, the maximum g(n,t) such that there exists an SDR of size g(n,t).Wait, yes! This is exactly the problem of finding a system of distinct representatives (SDR) in a hypergraph. So the question is: given a hypergraph with hyperedges (teams) each of size at most t, and the vertex set (colors) has size n, what is the maximum g(n,t) such that there always exists an SDR of size at least g(n,t). Therefore, we need to determine the minimal g(n,t) such that any such hypergraph has an SDR of size at least g(n,t).So, I need to recall results related to SDRs in hypergraphs. There&#39;s a theorem called Hall&#39;s theorem which gives a condition for the existence of an SDR. For a family of sets, an SDR exists if and only if for every k, the union of any k sets has size at least k. But in our case, the hypergraph can be arbitrary, as long as each hyperedge has size at most t and the total vertex set is n. So we need a lower bound on the size of the SDR that holds for any such hypergraph.Alternatively, there is a theorem called the Haxell&#39;s theorem or some other result in hypergraph matching that might give such a bound. But since I might not remember the exact theorems, let me think from scratch.Suppose each team (hyperedge) has at most t colors. The total number of colors is n. We need to pick a set S of teams and assign to each a unique color from their color set, such that no two teams in S share the same color.So, what&#39;s the minimal guarantee? For example, if each color is used by at most some number of teams, then we can apply some sort of greedy algorithm. But in the worst case, a color could be shared by many teams.But the problem states that in any possible hypergraph (any possible assignment of colors to teams, respecting the max t colors per team and total n colors), there must exist an SDR of size g(n,t). So we need the minimal g(n,t) such that this is always true.Let me consider some small cases.Case 1: t = 1. Then each team has exactly one color, and the total colors are n. As before, the maximum SDR is n, and since in any hypergraph with n vertices and hyperedges of size 1, the SDR is the number of distinct hyperedges, but since the union is n colors, and each hyperedge is a color, there must be at least n hyperedges (teams) to cover all n colors. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if t=1, each team is a single color, and the union of all teams&#39; colors is n. So there are n colors, and each team is a singleton set. The number of teams can be arbitrary, but the union is n colors. So for example, there could be many teams all using the same color. However, the problem states that &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;, which I think means that the union is exactly n. So in that case, even if multiple teams share colors, the total distinct colors are n. Then, the maximum SDR is the maximum matching, which would be n, because you can pick one team for each color. But if multiple teams share a color, you can only pick one team per color. However, the problem is asking for the minimal g(n,t) such that in any such hypergraph, there is an SDR of size at least g(n,t). Since in the worst case, all teams could be using the same color, but the union must be n. Wait, but if all teams use the same color, then the union is 1 color, so n must be 1. So for n=1, t=1, you have multiple teams each with color 1, then the maximum SDR is 1. So in that case, g(1,1)=1. But for larger n, if t=1, then you need at least n teams, each with a unique color? Wait, no. The problem states that the union of all teams&#39; colors is exactly n. So if t=1, each team has one color, so if the union is n, then there must be at least n teams (since each team contributes one color, but colors can repeat). Wait, no. For example, if you have two teams, both with color 1, and n=1. Then the union is {1}, which satisfies the condition. Then, the maximum SDR is 1. But if n=2, and t=1, the union must be two colors. So if you have three teams: two with color 1, two with color 2, then the union is {1,2}, and the maximum SDR is 2 (you can pick one team from color 1 and one from color 2). So even if there are multiple teams, as long as the union is n colors, you can always pick one team per color, hence g(n,1)=n.But when t increases, the problem becomes more complex. Let me consider t=2. Let&#39;s take n=2. Each team has at most 2 colors, and the total colors are 2. So possible teams could be {1}, {2}, {1,2}. If there are multiple teams. The maximum SDR would be 2, because you can assign color 1 to one team and color 2 to another. But is that always possible? Suppose all teams are {1,2}. Then, if you have k teams, each with {1,2}, then the maximum SDR is 2: assign color 1 to one team and color 2 to another. But if you have three teams, each with {1,2}, then the SDR size is 2. So in this case, the maximum SDR is 2, regardless of how many teams there are. So for n=2, t=2, g(2,2)=2. Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimal g(n,t) such that in any configuration, there&#39;s an SDR of at least g(n,t). So for n=2, t=2, even if all teams are {1,2}, you can still find an SDR of size 2. Wait, no. If there are two teams, each with {1,2}, then you can assign color 1 to the first team and color 2 to the second team. If there are three teams, each with {1,2}, then the maximum SDR is still 2: assign color 1 to one team and color 2 to another, the third team can&#39;t be assigned a color without conflict. But the problem says &quot;there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least g(n, t) teams&quot;. So for n=2, t=2, in any hypergraph with teams of size at most 2 and total colors 2, there must exist an SDR of size at least g(2,2). If all teams are {1,2}, then the maximum SDR is 2. If there&#39;s a mix, like some {1}, some {2}, some {1,2}, then you can still get an SDR of size 2. So maybe g(2,2)=2. But wait, if all teams are {1}, then the union is {1}, but n is supposed to be 2. So actually, in the problem statement, &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;, so if n=2, then the union must be exactly 2 colors. Therefore, there must be at least one team with color 1 and at least one team with color 2. So in that case, even if you have multiple teams, you can always pick one team with color 1 and one with color 2, so the SDR is at least 2. Therefore, g(2,2)=2. Similarly, for n=3, t=2. Let&#39;s see. Suppose we have three colors: 1,2,3. Each team has at most 2 colors. The union is all three colors. So there must be at least one team with color 1, one with color 2, and one with color 3. But teams can have multiple colors. Let&#39;s say all teams are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. Then, the maximum SDR is 2: assign color 1 to {1,2}, color 3 to {1,3}, but then {2,3} can&#39;t get a color. Wait, no. Wait, maybe assign color 2 to {1,2}, color 3 to {2,3}, but then {1,3} can take color 1. Wait, actually, in this case, you can have an SDR of size 3. Assign color 1 to {1,2}, color 2 to {2,3}, color 3 to {1,3}. Wait, no, because {1,2} is assigned color 1, {2,3} is assigned color 2, {1,3} is assigned color 3. That works. Each team is assigned a unique color. So in this case, the SDR is 3. Hmm. But what if there are more teams? Suppose you have four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3} (but t=2, so the last team can&#39;t have three colors). Wait, each team has at most 2 colors. So maybe four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}. Then, trying to find an SDR. Let&#39;s assign color 1 to the first {1,2}, color 3 to {1,3}, color 2 to {2,3}. Then the fourth team {1,2} can&#39;t get a color. So maximum SDR is 3. But if n=3, t=2, and all teams are pairs, then maybe the maximum SDR is 3. Wait, but is that always possible? Let me think. If the hypergraph is a triangle: three teams {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. Then, as above, we can assign 1, 3, 2 respectively, which works. If we have four teams, like {1,2}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. Then, the SDR could be assign 1 to the first {1,2}, 2 to the second {1,2}, but then {1,3} can take 3, and {2,3} can&#39;t take anything. Wait, no. If you assign 1 to the first team, 2 to the second, then {1,3} can take 3, and {2,3} is left with no available colors. So the SDR size would be 3. Alternatively, assign 2 to the first team, 1 to the second, then {1,3} takes 3, {2,3} takes 3, but conflict. So still SDR size 3. So even with four teams, the SDR is 3. Wait, but in this case, n=3, so we need to cover all three colors. Wait, but the problem states that the union is exactly n colors, so all three colors must be present in the teams. Therefore, in any case, there must be at least one team containing each color. So even if you have multiple teams, you can select one team for each color, but you need to ensure that each selected team actually contains its assigned color.But if a color is only present in one team, then that team must be included in the SDR. So, for example, if color 1 is only present in one team, then that team must be assigned color 1. Then, the remaining colors can be assigned to other teams. But if colors are present in multiple teams, then you have more flexibility.But to find the minimal guarantee, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. That is, the hypergraph where the maximum SDR is as small as possible. So, what&#39;s the minimal possible SDR given n and t.I recall that in hypergraphs, there&#39;s a concept called matching number, which is the size of the largest set of hyperedges that are pairwise disjoint. But in our case, it&#39;s slightly different because we are looking for an SDR, which is equivalent to a matching that covers the SDR size, but the matching is in the bipartite incidence graph between teams and colors.Alternatively, think of it as a bipartite graph where one partition is the teams and the other is the colors, with an edge from a team to a color if the team has that color. Then, an SDR corresponds to a matching in this bipartite graph that covers the teams in the SDR. So the question reduces to: given a bipartite graph between teams and colors, where each team has degree at most t, and the total number of colors is n, what is the minimal largest matching size over all such graphs.But in our problem, the teams can be any number, right? The problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of teams, just that the total colors are n, and each team has at most t colors. So the number of teams could be arbitrary. However, the problem states that the union of all teams&#39; colors is exactly n. So colors not present in any team are not allowed; all n colors must be used by at least one team.But in such a bipartite graph, we need to find the minimal maximum matching size across all possible such graphs. Wait, but if the number of teams is arbitrary, then in theory, you could have a graph where each color is connected to many teams, and the matching number is limited by some function of n and t.Wait, perhaps we can use the following approach: each color is available in some number of teams. To maximize the difficulty of finding a large matching, the adversary would arrange the teams such that the colors are distributed as evenly as possible among the teams, forcing us to use as many colors as possible but limiting the matching size.But maybe we can think in terms of the pigeonhole principle. If each color is present in at most k teams, then the total number of teams is at most n*k. But we need to find a matching that covers as many teams as possible. However, since the problem allows the number of teams to be arbitrary, but the total colors are n, the worst case is when the hypergraph is designed to minimize the maximum SDR.Wait, actually, if we fix n and t, the maximum number of teams doesn&#39;t matter because even with infinitely many teams, as long as each has at most t colors and the union is n, we need to find an SDR of size g(n,t). But how does the number of teams affect the SDR? For example, if you have more teams, you might have more overlap, making it harder to find a large SDR.Wait, actually, no. If you have more teams, but each color is in many teams, then even though there&#39;s overlap, you might still be able to find a large SDR by choosing different teams for different colors. Wait, but the problem states &quot;there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least g(n, t) teams&quot;. So regardless of how the teams are arranged (as long as each team has at most t colors and the total colors are n), there must be such a set. Therefore, the minimal such g(n,t) is determined by the worst-case arrangement of teams, i.e., the arrangement that minimizes the maximum SDR.So to find g(n,t), we need to find the minimal number such that any hypergraph with n vertices, hyperedges of size ≤t, and covering all n vertices, has an SDR of size at least g(n,t).This seems related to the concept of covering number or hitting set, but in reverse. Wait, actually, an SDR is a kind of matching where each hyperedge is matched to a unique vertex.There&#39;s a theorem in combinatorics called the Hall&#39;s theorem for hypergraphs, which might give a condition for the existence of an SDR. Hall&#39;s condition states that for any subset S of the hyperedges, the union of the neighbors (i.e., the vertices covered by S) must be at least as large as |S|. However, in our case, since the hypergraph can be arbitrary, we can&#39;t guarantee that Hall&#39;s condition is satisfied. Therefore, we need a lower bound on the size of the largest SDR that must exist in any such hypergraph.Alternatively, consider that each color is in at least one team. Therefore, the minimal SDR is at least 1, but we need a better lower bound.Another angle: since each team has at most t colors, then in the bipartite graph representation, each team (on one side) has degree ≤t. We need a matching that matches teams to colors such that each matched team is assigned a unique color. This is equivalent to a matching that covers some number of teams.In bipartite graphs, there&#39;s a theorem called König&#39;s theorem which relates the size of the maximum matching and the minimum vertex cover, but I&#39;m not sure if that applies here.Alternatively, consider that each color can be assigned to at most one team. Therefore, the maximum SDR size is at most n, since there are n colors. But we need a lower bound.If we can find a lower bound based on n and t, that&#39;s our answer.Let me think of it in terms of the greedy algorithm. If we proceed greedily, picking a team and assigning it a color, then removing that color from all other teams. The question is, what&#39;s the minimal number of teams we can always pick in this way.But the problem is that the order in which we pick teams affects the outcome. However, since we need a guarantee for any hypergraph, we need to consider the worst possible order.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of the Caro-Wei theorem, which gives a lower bound on the independence number in graphs. But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. Since each color is present in at least one team, we can trivially form an SDR of size 1 by choosing any team and assigning it any of its colors. But we need a larger guarantee.Suppose we consider that each team has t colors, so potentially, each team can &quot;cover&quot; t colors. To cover g teams, we need g colors, with each color used exactly once. So, the problem is similar to packing teams into colors such that each color is used once.In the worst case, how many teams can we pack without overlapping colors?This is equivalent to the maximum matching in the bipartite graph. So, we need the minimal maximum matching over all possible bipartite graphs with the given constraints.Alternatively, consider that each color can be assigned to only one team. Therefore, the maximum SDR size is equal to the maximum number of teams we can select such that all their assigned colors are distinct. This is equivalent to choosing a set of teams with a system of distinct colors.Since each team has up to t colors, maybe we can use some fractional reasoning. For example, if each color is used by m teams, then the total number of team-color incidences is at most m*n. On the other hand, each team can contribute up to t colors, so if there are k teams, then the total team-color incidences are at least k (since each team has at least 1 color) and at most k*t. Therefore, k ≤ m*n ≤ k*t. But not sure if this helps.Alternatively, using double counting. Let me denote:Let T be the number of teams. Each team has at most t colors, so the total number of color assignments is ≤ T*t.Each color is assigned to at least 1 team (since the union is n colors). Therefore, the total color assignments is ≥ n.Thus, T*t ≥ n ⇒ T ≥ n/t. But this gives a lower bound on the number of teams, not directly on the SDR size.But the SDR size is the number of teams we can match to unique colors. Let g be the SDR size. Then, each color can be used at most once, so g ≤ n. Also, g ≤ T, since we can&#39;t have more teams in the SDR than the total number of teams. But we need a lower bound on g.If we think in terms of the pigeonhole principle: if there are many teams, then some colors must be used by many teams, so we can choose a team for each color. But even if a color is used by many teams, we can only choose one team for that color. Therefore, the maximum SDR size is at least the number of colors divided by the maximum number of times a color is used.Wait, but since we don&#39;t know the distribution, maybe we can use an averaging argument. Suppose that each color is used by at least one team and at most m teams. Then, the total number of color assignments is ≤ m*n. But since each team has ≤ t colors, total color assignments ≤ T*t. Thus, m*n ≥ T*t. But since T can be arbitrary, unless we have a bound on m.Alternatively, for the SDR size g, we need to choose g teams such that all their assigned colors are distinct. Each color can be assigned to at most one team. Therefore, the maximum possible g is n, but we need a lower bound.In the worst case, the hypergraph is designed to minimize g. So, the adversary would try to maximize the overlap of colors among teams, making it difficult to choose many teams with distinct colors.Suppose that each color is included in as many teams as possible. If each color is included in k teams, then the total number of teams is k*n. Then, in such a hypergraph, the maximum SDR would be n, since we can choose one team per color. Wait, but if each color is in k teams, then we can choose any one team per color, so SDR size is n. Therefore, in that case, even with multiple teams per color, the SDR size is n. But that contradicts my earlier thought where if all teams have the same color, then the SDR size is 1. But in the problem, the union must be exactly n colors. So if all teams have the same color, then n=1, and the SDR size is 1.Wait, perhaps the key is that each color must be present in at least one team, but can be present in many. So, if a color is present in m teams, then in the SDR, we can choose at most one team from those m. Therefore, the SDR size is at least the number of colors divided by the maximum number of teams that share a color. Wait, but without knowing the distribution, how can we bound this?Alternatively, using an averaging argument. Suppose that each color is used by an average of T*t / n teams (since total color assignments is ≤ T*t). Then, the average number of teams per color is ≤ T*t / n. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, there exists a color used by at least T*t / n teams. But this seems in the opposite direction.Wait, perhaps using the concept of the minimal maximum multiplicity. If we want to minimize the maximum SDR size, the adversary would maximize the minimum number of teams sharing a color. That is, distribute the teams as evenly as possible among the colors.Suppose there are T teams, each with t colors, and n total colors. Then, the total color assignments is ≤ T*t. To distribute the teams as evenly as possible among the n colors, each color would be assigned to about T*t / n teams. Then, in such a case, the maximum SDR size would be roughly n, since we can pick one team per color. But this seems contradictory.Wait, maybe I&#39;m overcomplicating. Let&#39;s think of it in another way. Each color is a resource, and each team needs one resource (color) to be active, and no two teams can share the same resource. We need to activate as many teams as possible. The problem is asking for the minimal number that is always achievable, regardless of how the resources are distributed, given that each team can use up to t resources.This is similar to a scheduling problem where each job (team) can be processed on up to t machines (colors), and we need to schedule as many jobs as possible without overlap. The question is, given that there are n machines, and each job can use up to t machines, what&#39;s the minimal number of jobs that can always be scheduled, regardless of the job assignments.In scheduling theory, there&#39;s a result called the Moore-Hodgson algorithm or perhaps other scheduling bounds, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, think in terms of graph matching. If each team is a node connected to t colors, the problem is to find the maximum matching in this graph. The question then becomes, what&#39;s the minimal maximum matching size over all such graphs with n color nodes and any number of team nodes, each of degree at most t.There is a theorem called the König&#39;s theorem which states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching plus the size of the maximum independent set equals the number of vertices. But not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, consider that in any bipartite graph with maximum degree t on one side (teams), the size of the maximum matching is at least n / t. Wait, maybe not. Wait, in a bipartite graph where one side has teams and the other has colors, each team connected to ≤t colors. Then, the maximum matching is the maximum number of teams that can be assigned unique colors. To find a lower bound on this, we can use the following argument:Each color can be assigned to at most one team. Therefore, the maximum matching is at most n. On the other hand, each team can contribute at most 1 to the matching, so it&#39;s at most the number of teams. But we need a lower bound.A possible approach is to use the concept of fractional matchings. A fractional matching assigns a weight to each edge such that the sum over edges incident to a team is ≤1 and the sum over edges incident to a color is ≤1. The maximum fractional matching is then at least the integral matching. However, I&#39;m not sure if this helps.Alternatively, use Hall&#39;s theorem. For a subset S of teams, the number of colors they are connected to must be at least |S|. If this condition is satisfied for all subsets S, then a perfect matching exists. However, in our case, we cannot guarantee Hall&#39;s condition, but we need a lower bound on the matching size when Hall&#39;s condition is not necessarily met.There&#39;s a result called the Hall&#39;s theorem for approximate matchings, which states that if for every subset S of teams, the number of neighbors (colors) is at least |S| - k, then there exists a matching of size at least n - k. Not sure.Alternatively, consider the following theorem: In any bipartite graph with maximum degree t on one side, the size of the maximum matching is at least n / (t + 1). But I need to verify this.Wait, actually, there&#39;s a theorem that says that in a bipartite graph with maximum degree t on one side, the matching number is at least n / (t + 1). Let me check the logic.Suppose that in the bipartite graph between teams and colors, each team has degree at most t. We need to show that there exists a matching of size at least n / (t + 1). Here&#39;s a possible argument:Assign each color to a team in such a way that each color is assigned at most once. The total number of assignments is at most n. Each team can be assigned at most t colors, but since we want each team to be assigned at most one color, we need to select a subset of edges such that each team has at most one edge and each color has at most one edge.The problem is equivalent to finding a matching that covers as many colors as possible. Wait, no. It&#39;s covering teams with colors. Wait, perhaps we can use the following result from graph theory: In any bipartite graph, the size of the maximum matching is at least the number of edges divided by the maximum degree. But here, the number of edges can be as high as T*t, where T is the number of teams. But n is fixed as the number of colors.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think again.The number of colors is n, and each color is connected to at least one team. Each team is connected to at most t colors. Let’s denote E as the number of edges in the bipartite graph. Then, E ≥ n (since each color is connected to at least one team) and E ≤ T*t.Now, the maximum matching size μ satisfies μ ≤ n (since there are n colors) and μ ≤ T (since there are T teams). We need a lower bound on μ.A theorem by Erdős–Rényi states that in a bipartite graph with parts A and B, if every vertex in A has degree at least k, then there exists a matching of size at least min(|A|, |B|, k). But in our case, the teams (A) can have degree 1 to t, and colors (B) have degree at least 1.Alternatively, use the following formula from matching theory: In any bipartite graph, the size of the maximum matching is at least (number of edges) / (maximum degree). Here, maximum degree on the team side is t, and on the color side it can be arbitrary. However, since we don&#39;t know the maximum degree on the color side, this approach might not help.Alternatively, since each color has degree at least 1, and each team has degree at most t, we can use the following inequality: Let μ be the maximum matching size. Then, by Konig&#39;s theorem, μ equals the minimum vertex cover. However, I don&#39;t see an immediate way to apply this.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach inspired by the probabilistic method. Suppose we randomly select a color for each team, choosing uniformly among its available colors. The expected number of teams that successfully get a unique color is the sum over all teams of the probability that their chosen color is not chosen by any other team.But this seems complicated. Alternatively, consider assigning each color to a random team that contains it. The expected number of colors assigned is the sum over colors of the probability that the color is assigned to exactly one team. For a color c, if it is present in m teams, then the probability that exactly one team selects it is m * (1/m) * (1 - 1/m)^{m - 1} ≈ 1/e for large m. So the expected number is roughly n / e. But this is just a heuristic.However, since we need a deterministic lower bound, this approach might not be useful.Wait, returning to the problem statement: we need to find the maximum g(n, t) such that in any sports association (i.e., any hypergraph) with n colors and teams of size ≤ t, there exists an SDR of size at least g(n, t).This is equivalent to finding the minimal number g such that any hypergraph as described has an SDR of size at least g. So g(n, t) is the minimal such g over all possible hypergraphs.Therefore, to find g(n, t), we need to find the hypergraph that minimizes the maximum SDR size, and then g(n, t) is equal to that minimal maximum.So, let&#39;s try to construct a hypergraph that minimizes the SDR size.Suppose we partition the n colors into groups, each of size t. Then, create teams such that each team corresponds to a group, i.e., each team has all t colors in the group. Then, the number of teams is n/t (assuming n divisible by t). In this case, the SDR size is n/t, since each team must be assigned a unique color, but each team has t colors. However, since all teams in a group share the same t colors, you can only choose one team per group, assigning one color from each group. But wait, each group has t colors, and each team in a group has all t colors. Therefore, if we have multiple teams in a group, they all have the same t colors. Therefore, the SDR size would be the number of groups, which is n/t, because you can assign one color per group, choosing one team per group. However, if there are multiple teams per group, you can only pick one team per group, since they all share the same colors. Wait, but in this case, if you have multiple teams in the same group, you can only include one of them in the SDR, because they share all t colors. Therefore, the maximum SDR size is equal to the number of groups, which is n/t. However, this requires that each color is in exactly one group. But if we partition the n colors into groups of size t, then each color is in exactly one group. Therefore, each team (group) has t unique colors. Therefore, in this hypergraph, the maximum SDR size is n/t, since you can select one team per group and assign a unique color from each group. But wait, if you have multiple teams per group, then they all have the same colors, so you can only select one team from each group, and assign one color from that group. Therefore, the maximum SDR size is the number of groups, which is n/t, multiplied by 1, which is n/t. However, if there&#39;s only one team per group, then the SDR size is n/t. If there are more teams per group, the SDR size remains n/t. Therefore, in this construction, the SDR size is n/t, regardless of the number of teams.Is this the minimal possible? Suppose we have a hypergraph where colors are arranged in such a way that each color is shared by as many teams as possible, but structured to minimize the SDR. The above construction gives an SDR size of n/t. If we can find a hypergraph where the SDR size is smaller than n/t, then g(n,t) would be smaller. But is that possible?Suppose n=4, t=2. Then, partitioned into two groups of two colors each: {1,2}, {3,4}. Each team in a group has both colors. If there are two teams per group, then the hypergraph has four teams: {1,2}, {1,2}, {3,4}, {3,4}. The maximum SDR size is 2: choose one team from the first group (assigned color 1 or 2) and one from the second group (assigned color 3 or 4). Indeed, 2 = 4/2 = n/t. If you try to create a different hypergraph, say, overlapping groups. For example, teams {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,1}. Each team has two colors. The maximum SDR size here is 2: assign 1 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, but then {3,4} and {4,1} can&#39;t be assigned without conflict. Alternatively, assign 2 to {1,2}, 4 to {3,4}, which gives SDR size 2. Alternatively, can we get a larger SDR? If we assign 1 to {1,2}, 3 to {3,4}, but then {2,3} and {4,1} are still conflicting. Wait, maybe assign 1 to {4,1}, 2 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, 4 to {3,4}. But then {4,1} is assigned 1, which conflicts with {1,2} assigned 1. No, you can&#39;t do that. Wait, each team must be assigned one of its own colors. So {1,2} can be assigned 1 or 2. Suppose we assign 1 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, 4 to {3,4}, then we have three teams in the SDR: {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, assigned colors 1, 3, 4 respectively. But color 2 is not used, and color 3 is used, but {2,3} is assigned 3, {3,4} is assigned 4. Wait, no conflict. Wait, that works. Assign 1 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, 4 to {3,4}. This is an SDR of size 3. So in this hypergraph, the maximum SDR is 3, which is greater than n/t=2. Therefore, this construction allows a larger SDR. Therefore, the previous construction where the SDR size is n/t is not the minimal possible. Therefore, my initial thought was incorrect.So, in the overlapping groups example, the SDR size can be larger than n/t. Therefore, the hypergraph that minimizes the maximum SDR might be the one where colors are partitioned into groups, and teams are formed such that each team in a group shares all colors in the group. As in the first example, leading to an SDR size of n/t. But in the second example with overlapping groups, the SDR size is larger. Therefore, the minimal SDR size occurs when the hypergraph is structured with disjoint color groups, each assigned to multiple teams, forcing the SDR size to be n/t.Therefore, perhaps g(n,t) = ⌈n/t⌉. But wait, in the first example with n=4, t=2, we have g(4,2)=2. But in the overlapping hypergraph, the SDR size is 3, which is bigger. However, the question is about the minimal possible SDR over all hypergraphs. So if there exists a hypergraph where the SDR size is n/t, then g(n,t) cannot be higher than n/t, but we need to check whether in all hypergraphs the SDR size is at least n/t.But in the disjoint groups hypergraph, the SDR size is exactly n/t. In other hypergraphs, it could be larger. Therefore, the minimal possible SDR size over all hypergraphs is n/t, so g(n,t) = ⌈n/t⌉. However, in the example with n=3, t=2, ⌈3/2⌉=2. If we have three colors, partitioned into two groups: one of size 2 and one of size 1. Then, teams in the first group have both colors, and the team in the second group has the single color. Then, the SDR size is 2: one from the first group (assigned one color) and one from the second group. But in reality, if the group of size 1 has one color, say color 3, and the group of size 2 has colors 1 and 2, with multiple teams in each group. Then, the SDR would need to include one team from the first group (assigned either 1 or 2) and the team from the second group (assigned 3). So SDR size is 2, which is indeed ⌈3/2⌉=2. If we have a different hypergraph, like three teams each with two colors forming a triangle {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,3}, then the SDR size is 2 as well. Wait, no. Earlier, we saw that in the triangle hypergraph, the SDR size is 3. Assign 1 to {1,2}, 2 to {2,3}, 3 to {1,3}? No, {1,3} can&#39;t be assigned 3 if {2,3} is assigned 3. Wait, no. Wait, {1,2} can be assigned 1, {2,3} can be assigned 2, {1,3} can be assigned 3. Each team is assigned a distinct color. So SDR size is 3. Therefore, in this hypergraph, the SDR size is 3, which is greater than ⌈3/2⌉=2.Therefore, the previous reasoning is flawed. It seems that the disjoint groups hypergraph gives an SDR size of ⌈n/t⌉, but other hypergraphs can have larger SDR sizes. Therefore, the minimal SDR size over all possible hypergraphs is ⌈n/t⌉, so g(n,t)=⌈n/t⌉.But wait, in the triangle hypergraph with n=3, t=2, the SDR size is 3. So the minimal possible SDR is 2, but in reality, it&#39;s possible to have larger SDRs. But we need the guarantee that in any hypergraph, there exists an SDR of size at least g(n,t). So even if some hypergraphs allow larger SDRs, we need to find the minimal g(n,t) such that all hypergraphs have at least g(n,t). So if there exists a hypergraph where the maximum SDR is ⌈n/t⌉, and all other hypergraphs have SDR size at least ⌈n/t⌉, then g(n,t)=⌈n/t⌉. However, in the triangle hypergraph example, the SDR size is 3, which is larger than ⌈3/2⌉=2. So in that case, the lower bound is still 2, but the actual SDR can be higher. Therefore, to find g(n,t), we need to find the minimal number such that every hypergraph has an SDR of at least that size.So, the question is: is there a hypergraph with SDR size ⌈n/t⌉, and is that the minimal possible?In the disjoint groups hypergraph, where n is split into groups of size t, and teams are formed within each group, the SDR size is the number of groups, which is ⌈n/t⌉. For example, if n=5, t=2, then groups are {1,2}, {3,4}, {5}, leading to SDR size 3. So ⌈5/2⌉=3. In this case, you can assign one color per group, so the SDR size is equal to the number of groups. Therefore, in such a hypergraph, the SDR size is exactly ⌈n/t⌉.Now, the question is: is there any hypergraph where the SDR size is less than ⌈n/t⌉? If not, then ⌈n/t⌉ is the correct answer.Suppose someone tries to construct a hypergraph with a smaller SDR. For example, n=4, t=2. If we make two groups of two colors, {1,2}, {3,4}, each with multiple teams. Then, the SDR size is 2, which is ⌈4/2⌉=2. If you try to overlap the groups more, the SDR size can increase, as seen earlier. So in all cases, the SDR size is at least ⌈n/t⌉.Therefore, it&#39;s plausible that g(n,t)=⌈n/t⌉. But I need to confirm this with another example.Take n=5, t=2. Then ⌈5/2⌉=3. If we create three groups: {1,2}, {3,4}, {5}. Assign multiple teams to each group. Then, the SDR size is 3: one from each group. If we create a different hypergraph with overlapping groups, say teams {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,1}. Each team has two colors. What&#39;s the maximum SDR size here? Let&#39;s try to assign colors:Assign 1 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, 4 to {3,4}, 5 to {4,5}. Then {5,1} is left, but color 1 is already used. Alternatively, assign 2 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, 4 to {3,4}, 5 to {4,5}, 1 to {5,1}. That works! So all five teams can be assigned unique colors. Wait, but we only have five colors. So the SDR size is 5. But n=5, t=2, and g(n,t)=3 according to the previous logic. But in this hypergraph, the SDR size is 5, which is the maximum possible. So this example doesn&#39;t help.But if we create a hypergraph that combines both overlapping and non-overlapping groups. For example, some teams share colors, and others don&#39;t. However, regardless of the structure, the SDR size seems to be at least ⌈n/t⌉.Alternatively, think about it from an algorithm perspective. To build an SDR, you can iterate through each color and assign it to a team that has that color. Since there are n colors, you need to assign each color to at most one team. However, teams can have multiple colors, so once a team is assigned a color, it cannot be assigned another. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting a set of teams such that each team is assigned a unique color, covering as many colors as possible. But we need a lower bound.Another approach: Since each team has at most t colors, the number of teams required to cover all n colors is at least ⌈n/t⌉. Because each team can cover at most t colors. Therefore, to cover all n colors, you need at least ⌈n/t⌉ teams. But in our problem, we don&#39;t need to cover all colors, but to have a set of teams with assigned colors that are unique. The size of such a set is limited by the number of colors, but also by the structure.Wait, perhaps the answer is indeed ⌈n/t⌉. Because in the worst-case hypergraph, where colors are partitioned into ⌈n/t⌉ groups, each of size at most t, and teams are formed within each group, the SDR size is exactly ⌈n/t⌉. And in any other hypergraph, the SDR size can only be larger. Therefore, the minimal guarantee is ⌈n/t⌉.Therefore, g(n,t)=⌈n/t⌉.But let me verify with another example. Take n=3, t=2. Then ⌈3/2⌉=2. In the triangle hypergraph {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,3}, the SDR size is 3. However, in the partitioned hypergraph with groups {1,2}, {3}, the SDR size is 2. But wait, in this partitioned hypergraph, if you have multiple teams in the first group {1,2}, say two teams: {1,2} and {1,2}, and one team {3}. Then, the SDR size is 2: one from the first group (assigned 1 or 2) and one from the second group (assigned 3). So even though there are three teams, the SDR size is 2. Therefore, in this hypergraph, the SDR size is 2, which matches ⌈3/2⌉=2. In the triangle hypergraph, the SDR size is larger, but the question is about the minimal guarantee across all hypergraphs. Therefore, since there exists a hypergraph where the SDR size is 2, and in others it&#39;s larger, the minimal guarantee is 2. Therefore, g(3,2)=2.Similarly, for n=5, t=2, g(5,2)=3, since you can partition into {1,2}, {3,4}, {5}, and the SDR size is 3. In other hypergraphs, it can be larger, but the minimal is 3.Therefore, the pattern seems to be that g(n,t)=⌈n/t⌉. Because in the partitioned hypergraph, you can&#39;t get more than ⌈n/t⌉, and this is the minimal possible. Therefore, the answer should be ⌈n/t⌉, which is the ceiling of n divided by t.But let me check with t=3, n=7. Then g(7,3)=3, since ⌈7/3⌉=3. If partitioned into {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7}, then the SDR size is 3. If there are multiple teams in each group, you can still only pick one per group. Therefore, the SDR size is 3. In another hypergraph with overlapping teams, you might get a larger SDR, but the minimal is 3.Therefore, based on these examples and constructions, it seems that g(n,t)=⌈n/t⌉. Therefore, the maximum value g(n,t) such that any sports association with n colors and teams of at most t colors has a color-identifiable set of at least g(n,t) teams is the ceiling of n divided by t.But wait, the problem states &quot;positive integers n, t&quot;. Therefore, the answer is ⎡n/t⎤, which is the ceiling function. In LaTeX, this is written as lceil frac{n}{t} rceil.However, the problem says &quot;find the maximum value of the integer g(n, t)&quot; such that in any sports association... there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least g(n, t) teams. So we need the maximum g(n,t) that is always true. Since in some hypergraphs you can have larger SDRs, but the minimal possible is ⎡n/t⎤, therefore the answer is ⎡n/t⎤.But wait, let me confirm with another example where n is divisible by t. For example, n=4, t=2. Then g(4,2)=2. In the partitioned hypergraph with two groups {1,2}, {3,4}, each with multiple teams, the SDR size is 2. In another hypergraph, like four teams each with two colors forming a cycle {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,1}, the SDR size can be 2: assign 1 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, but then {3,4} and {4,1} can&#39;t be assigned. Alternatively, assign 2 to {1,2}, 4 to {3,4}, which gives SDR size 2. However, actually, you can assign 1 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, 4 to {3,4}, which is three teams. But color 4 is assigned to {3,4}, but then {4,1} can&#39;t be assigned. Wait, but you can choose a different assignment. Assign 2 to {1,2}, 3 to {2,3}, 4 to {3,4}, and 1 to {4,1}. That&#39;s four teams assigned unique colors. So in this hypergraph, the SDR size is 4, which is n. But the minimal guarantee is 2, which is ⎡n/t⎤. Therefore, even though some hypergraphs allow larger SDRs, the minimal guarantee is still ⎡n/t⎤.Therefore, I think the correct answer is g(n,t)=⌈n/t⌉. Thus, the maximum value g(n,t) is the ceiling of n divided by t.Final AnswerThe maximum value ( g(n, t) ) is boxed{leftlceil frac{n}{t} rightrceil}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum value ( g(n, t) ) such that in any sports association with exactly ( n ) different colors and each team choosing at most ( t ) colors, there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least ( g(n, t) ) teams, we can model this problem using hypergraphs and systems of distinct representatives (SDRs).1. Understanding the Problem: A color-identifiable set ( S ) of teams means each team in ( S ) can be assigned a unique color from their set such that no two teams share the same color. This is equivalent to finding an SDR in a hypergraph where each hyperedge (team) has at most ( t ) vertices (colors), and the total number of vertices (colors) is ( n ).2. Hypergraph Representation: Each team is a hyperedge containing up to ( t ) colors. The goal is to find the minimum guarantee ( g(n, t) ) such that any such hypergraph has an SDR of size at least ( g(n, t) ).3. Key Insight: The worst-case scenario is when the hypergraph is structured to minimize the SDR size. By partitioning the ( n ) colors into groups of size ( t ) and creating teams within each group, the SDR size is limited by the number of groups. This partitioning results in an SDR size of ( lceil frac{n}{t} rceil ).4. Verification with Examples: Various examples confirm that the minimal SDR size in such hypergraphs is indeed ( lceil frac{n}{t} rceil ). For instance, if ( n = 5 ) and ( t = 2 ), the minimal SDR size is ( lceil frac{5}{2} rceil = 3 ). Similarly, other configurations show that the SDR size cannot be smaller than ( lceil frac{n}{t} rceil ).5. Conclusion: The maximum value ( g(n, t) ) is the ceiling of ( n ) divided by ( t ), ensuring that in any hypergraph configuration, there is always a color-identifiable set of at least this size.[boxed{leftlceil frac{n}{t} rightrceil}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum value of g(n, t) such that in any sports association with exactly n different colors, and each team choosing at most t colors, there&#39;s always a color-identifiable set of at least g(n, t) teams. Hmm. Let me parse this again.Each team can have up to t distinctive colors. The set S of teams is color-identifiable if each team in S can be assigned one of their colors such that no two teams in S share the same assigned color. So, it&#39;s like assigning distinct colors to each team in S, using colors from their own palettes. So, the assigned color for each team must be unique across S, and each assigned color must belong to the team&#39;s own set of colors.The question is asking for the maximum g(n, t) such that no matter how the teams choose their colors (up to t each, with total n colors in the association), there will always be at least g(n, t) teams that form a color-identifiable set. So, it&#39;s a guarantee that such a set exists of that size. We need to find the largest such g(n, t).Let me try to rephrase. This is similar to a graph problem? Maybe each team is a vertex, and colors are... maybe colors are another set, and each team is connected to the colors it has. Then, a color-identifiable set S would be a matching in this bipartite graph where each vertex in S is matched to a distinct color. So, in other words, the problem reduces to finding, in any bipartite graph where one partition has n nodes (colors), the other partition has an arbitrary number of teams, each team has degree at most t, what&#39;s the maximum number g(n, t) such that there&#39;s always a matching of size g(n, t).Wait, but the teams can be any number? The problem says &quot;in any sports association where all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;. So, the number of teams is not fixed, but the total number of colors is n. So, the graph has n color nodes, and any number of team nodes, each team node connected to at most t color nodes. Then, we need to find the maximum g(n, t) such that in any such bipartite graph, there exists a matching of size at least g(n, t). So, the minimal maximum. Because it&#39;s for any such graph, so the minimal g(n, t) that works for all graphs, but we need the maximum such g(n, t).Wait, but the problem says &quot;find the maximum value of the integer g(n, t) such that in any sports association [...] there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least g(n, t) teams.&quot; So, yes, it&#39;s the largest number g such that every possible such association (i.e., every possible bipartite graph with n colors and teams of degree ≤t) contains a matching of size at least g. So, the minimal maximum matching size across all possible such graphs is g(n, t), and we need to find that.This is similar to a Ramsey number problem, but not exactly. Alternatively, it&#39;s a question about the worst-case scenario for matchings in bipartite graphs with certain degree constraints.Let me think about possible approaches. Maybe using Hall&#39;s theorem? Hall&#39;s condition states that a bipartite graph has a matching that covers every node on one side if for every subset of that side, the number of neighbors is at least the size of the subset. Here, the colors are on one side, and the teams on the other. But we want a matching that covers some number of team nodes, each with a unique color.But we need to guarantee that regardless of how the teams are connected to colors (with each team connected to at most t colors), there must be a matching of a certain size. So, the question is, in such a bipartite graph, what is the minimal maximum matching size. So, the maximum g(n, t) such that every such graph has a matching of size at least g(n, t).Alternatively, to find the minimal number such that there exists a graph where the maximum matching is exactly g(n, t), and then that&#39;s the minimal maximum. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, consider the problem where each color can be assigned to at most one team. So, the matching is a set of teams each assigned a unique color. So, the maximum size of such a set is the maximum matching.But we need to guarantee that no matter how the teams are connected (with the constraints), there&#39;s always a matching of size at least g(n, t). So, the question is, what&#39;s the largest g(n, t) such that in every such bipartite graph, there is a matching of size g(n, t).I think this is a known problem in hypergraphs. Each team is a hyperedge of size at most t, and we want a matching in the hypergraph, which is a set of hyperedges that are pairwise disjoint. But here, the hyperedges (teams) can have size up to t, and we want the maximum number of hyperedges that can be packed such that they are pairwise disjoint. The question is, given that the hypergraph has n vertices (colors), and each hyperedge has size at most t, what is the minimal maximum matching size over all possible such hypergraphs. Then, the answer is g(n, t).But hypergraphs can be complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a theorem here. Let me recall. For hypergraphs where each hyperedge has size at most t, what&#39;s the minimal maximum matching size?Wait, maybe we can think in terms of the pigeonhole principle. Each team (hyperedge) can cover up to t colors, but if we have too many teams, some colors must be reused. But here, we want to pick as many teams as possible such that their assigned colors are all distinct. So, each team picks one color from their available t, such that all chosen colors are distinct.So, equivalently, we need a system of representatives. Each team picks a representative color from their set, and all representatives are distinct.This is similar to a system of distinct representatives (SDR). In our case, we need an SDR for some subset S of the teams. So, the question becomes: given a hypergraph where each hyperedge (team) has size at most t, and the vertex set has size n, what is the minimal maximum size of an SDR over all such hypergraphs. The answer would be g(n, t).I remember there&#39;s a theorem called Hall&#39;s theorem for SDRs. But in this case, it&#39;s not about a specific hypergraph, but about all possible hypergraphs with these parameters. So, we need the minimal number such that every hypergraph with n vertices and hyperedges of size at most t has an SDR of at least that size.Alternatively, maybe think of the problem as a two-player game: an adversary constructs a hypergraph with n vertices and hyperedges (teams) of size at most t, trying to minimize the maximum matching size. We need to find the maximum g(n, t) that the adversary cannot make the maximum matching smaller than g(n, t).What is the minimal possible maximum matching in such a hypergraph? Let&#39;s consider extremal cases.First, if t = 1. Then each team has only one color. So, each team is just a single color. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is just a set of teams with distinct colors. Since there are n colors, the maximum possible is n. But since the adversary can have as many teams as they want, but each team is a single color. To minimize the maximum matching, the adversary can have multiple teams with the same color. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set would be the number of distinct colors, which is n. Wait, but if all teams have distinct colors, then the maximum is the number of teams. But since the total colors are n, the maximum possible color-identifiable set can&#39;t exceed n. However, the problem states that all teams&#39; colors consist of exactly n different colors. So, each team must have at least one color? Wait, the problem says &quot;distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;. So, the union of all teams&#39; colors is exactly n. But each team can choose at most t colors. So, in the case t = 1, each team has exactly one color, and all n colors are used. But the number of teams can be arbitrary. Wait, no. If each team must have at most t colors, but the total colors are exactly n. So, if t = 1, then each team has exactly 1 color, and all n colors must be used by at least one team. But the number of teams could be greater than n, with some colors used by multiple teams. For example, if the adversary makes many teams with the same color. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set would be 1, since all teams share the same color. Wait, but the total colors are n. If t = 1, each team must have exactly 1 color, and the union of all teams&#39; colors is n. So, all n colors must be present. So, if the adversary wants to minimize the maximum color-identifiable set, they can have multiple teams per color, but since each color is present in at least one team, then the maximum color-identifiable set is at least 1 (just pick one team from each color). Wait, but no. If there are multiple teams with the same color, you can only pick one team per color. So, the maximum color-identifiable set would be equal to the number of colors, n. Because you can pick one team for each color, as all colors are present. Wait, but if there are multiple teams, but each color is only used once, then the maximum is n. If some colors are used by multiple teams, then the maximum is still n, because you can pick one team per color. Wait, but in this case, if the colors are exactly n, and each team has one color, then the hypergraph is just a collection of n color nodes, and team nodes each connected to one color. The maximum matching is the maximum number of teams you can pick such that each has a unique color. Which is equivalent to the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where one side is colors (n nodes) and the other is teams. The maximum matching would be the size of the maximum set of teams with distinct colors. If the adversary wants to minimize this, they would arrange as many teams as possible sharing colors, but since each color must be used at least once, but can be used multiple times. However, the maximum matching size is equal to the number of colors, n, because you can choose one team for each color. Wait, no. For example, if a color is used by multiple teams, but you can only choose one team for that color. So, even if there are 100 teams all of color 1, you can choose at most one of them. Then, if there are n colors, each with at least one team, then the maximum color-identifiable set is exactly n. Because you can choose one team from each color. Even if some colors have multiple teams, you can just pick one per color. So, in the case t = 1, g(n, 1) = n. But that seems contradictory, because if t = 1, each team has 1 color, and the maximum color-identifiable set is n. But n is the total number of colors. So, regardless of how the teams are arranged, as long as all n colors are used, you can always pick one team per color. So, g(n, 1) = n.Wait, but maybe not. Suppose n=2, t=1. So, two colors, say red and blue. Each team has one color. The association must include both red and blue. Suppose there are two teams: one red, one blue. Then the maximum color-identifiable set is 2. If there are three teams: two red and one blue. Then the maximum color-identifiable set is 2 (one red, one blue). If there are four teams: three red and one blue. Then maximum is still 2. So, regardless of how many teams there are, as long as both colors are present, the maximum is 2. So, for t=1, g(n, 1) = n.But that seems to suggest that if t=1, then the answer is n, but when t is larger, the answer might be lower. Wait, but when t is larger, each team can choose more colors, so maybe it&#39;s easier to find a color-identifiable set? Or is it harder?Wait, if each team has more colors to choose from, then potentially there are more overlaps between teams, so it might be harder to find a color-identifiable set. For example, if t=2, each team has two colors. Then, two teams might share a color, but also have another color. So, perhaps you can assign different colors to them.Wait, but the problem is in the worst case. So, the adversary will arrange the teams&#39; colors in such a way to minimize the maximum color-identifiable set. So, when t increases, the adversary has more flexibility to create overlaps, so the minimal maximum might decrease. Wait, but actually, when t increases, each team has more options, so maybe it&#39;s easier to find an SDR? Wait, no, because the adversary can create more overlaps. Let&#39;s see.Wait, take n=2, t=2. So, two colors, each team can choose up to two colors. The adversary wants to minimize the maximum color-identifiable set. Suppose the adversary creates three teams: each team has both colors. Then, for any two teams, if you try to assign colors, each team needs to pick one color, but there are only two colors. So, two teams can be assigned different colors, but the third team would have to reuse a color. So, maximum color-identifiable set is 2. But if the adversary creates two teams, each with both colors. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2: assign each team a different color. Wait, but each team has both colors. So, you can assign team 1 to color 1, team 2 to color 2. So, that works. If there are three teams, each with both colors. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2. Because if you try to assign each team a color, you have three teams but only two colors. So, two teams can get one color each, but the third team has to reuse a color. Wait, no. Each team has both colors, so for three teams, each can choose either color 1 or 2. But since there are only two colors, you can assign at most two teams without conflict. So, maximum is 2.But in this case, n=2, t=2. So, g(2, 2) would be 2? Because even though the adversary can create three teams each with both colors, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2. But if the adversary only creates two teams, each with both colors, then the maximum is 2. So, the minimal maximum here is 2. But is there a way for the adversary to make it lower?Wait, if n=2, t=2. The adversary could create multiple teams with both colors. But the maximum color-identifiable set is at least 2? Because you can choose two teams and assign them different colors. Wait, even if there are three teams, each with both colors, you can pick two teams, assign one color to each. The third team can&#39;t be assigned because both colors are taken. So, the maximum is 2. So, in this case, g(2,2)=2. But what if the adversary creates more teams? Say, four teams, each with both colors. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is still 2. So, regardless of how many teams there are, as long as they all have both colors, the maximum is 2. So, for n=2, t=2, g(2,2)=2. Wait, but maybe not.Wait, if the adversary creates teams with different color sets. For example, some teams have color 1, some have color 2, and some have both. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set might be larger. But the adversary is trying to minimize that maximum. So, to make the maximum as small as possible, the adversary would make as many teams as possible share colors. So, if the adversary makes all teams have both colors, then the maximum color-identifiable set is 2. But if some teams have only one color, the adversary might be forced to have a larger maximum. Wait, no. If a team has only one color, say color 1, then assigning that team color 1 blocks color 1 from other teams. So, maybe the maximum color-identifiable set could be larger if there are teams with single colors. Therefore, to minimize the maximum, the adversary would make all teams have both colors. Therefore, the maximum color-identifiable set would be 2. Hence, g(2,2)=2. Wait, but when t=2 and n=2, each team can have both colors. Then, in the worst case, the maximum is 2, which is the same as when t=1.Wait, perhaps for n=2, regardless of t≥1, g(2,t)=2. Because even if teams can choose up to t colors, the adversary can just assign both colors to all teams, making the maximum color-identifiable set 2.But actually, if t=2, n=2, the maximum is 2. If t=3, n=2, but since there are only two colors, t is irrelevant. So, perhaps for any t≥1, g(n, t) ≥ n. But that contradicts our previous thought. Wait, in the case where t=1 and n=2, we saw that the maximum is 2, which is n. If t=2, n=2, also 2. But if we take n=3, t=2. Let&#39;s see.Take n=3, t=2. The adversary wants to arrange teams with up to two colors from three total colors, trying to minimize the maximum color-identifiable set. How can they do that?Suppose the adversary creates multiple teams, each with two colors. To minimize the maximum SDR, perhaps they overlap the colors as much as possible. For example, create teams with colors {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}, etc. Then, if we try to assign colors to these teams, how many can we get?If we have three teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. Then, we can assign each team a different color: assign {1,2} to 1, {1,3} to 3, {2,3} to 2. So, that&#39;s three teams. Wait, but the adversary is trying to prevent that. Maybe by creating more teams. If the adversary creates four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 3. Because you can pick the first three teams and assign each a unique color. The fourth team can&#39;t be assigned because all colors are taken. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a way to have a larger set, but I think the maximum is 3. Hmm. Wait, but n=3, so there are three colors. The maximum possible color-identifiable set can&#39;t exceed 3. But can the adversary force it to be less?Suppose the adversary creates multiple teams all sharing the same two colors. For example, all teams have {1,2}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2: assign one team to color 1, another to color 2. But since all teams have {1,2}, you can only have two teams in the set. But the problem states that the union of all teams&#39; colors must be exactly n=3. So, if all teams have {1,2}, then color 3 is not used. But the problem says the association&#39;s colors consist of exactly n different colors, so color 3 must be used by at least one team. Therefore, the adversary can&#39;t have all teams with {1,2}; they must include at least one team with color 3. So, maybe one team has {1,2}, another {1,2}, and one team has {3}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2 (from the two {1,2} teams) plus 1 (the {3} team), but actually, you can&#39;t assign both {1,2} teams without conflicting. Wait, if you have two teams with {1,2}, and one team with {3}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set would be 2: assign one {1,2} team to 1, another {1,2} team to 2, and the {3} team to 3. Wait, but there are three teams here. So, you can have a color-identifiable set of size 3. Assign each team a unique color. The two {1,2} teams can be assigned 1 and 2, and the {3} team is assigned 3. So, that works. Therefore, even if the adversary tries to duplicate teams, as long as all colors are present, you can form a color-identifiable set of size 3. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier thought. So, perhaps for n=3, t=2, the answer is 3? But that seems too optimistic.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose n=3, t=2. The adversary creates four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}. All colors are present. Now, can we assign each of the four teams a unique color? Well, there are only three colors. So, at most three teams can be assigned unique colors. Let&#39;s try. Assign the first {1,2} to 1, {1,3} to 3, {2,3} to 2, and the fourth {1,2} team can&#39;t be assigned because 1 and 2 are already taken. So, the maximum is 3. But if the adversary adds more teams, say five teams: three copies of {1,2}, one {1,3}, one {2,3}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is still 3: pick one {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3} and assign each a different color. So, regardless of how the adversary arranges the teams, as long as all colors are covered, you can always find a color-identifiable set of size 3. So, g(3, 2)=3. But that seems to contradict the idea that when t increases, the maximum might decrease. Hmm.Wait, perhaps my reasoning is flawed. Let me think again. If each team can choose up to t colors, but the total colors are n. The problem requires that the entire set of teams uses exactly n colors. So, each color must be used by at least one team. Therefore, in the worst case, the adversary will arrange the teams such that the overlap between teams is maximized, but still covering all n colors.Wait, but if all teams must cover all n colors, but each team can only have up to t colors. So, the minimal number of teams needed to cover all n colors is ceiling(n/t). But in our problem, the adversary can have as many teams as they want, as long as the total colors are n. But they must include at least one team for each color.Wait, no. The problem says &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;. So, the union of all teams&#39; colors is exactly n. Therefore, each color must be used by at least one team. So, the adversary can&#39;t omit any color. So, in order to minimize the maximum color-identifiable set, the adversary would arrange as much overlap as possible, making many teams share colors, but still covering all n colors.But how does that affect the maximum color-identifiable set? Since even if teams share colors, you can pick one team per color. Wait, for example, suppose n=3, t=2. The adversary creates three teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. Then, each color is covered. The maximum color-identifiable set is 3: assign each team a different color. If the adversary creates more teams, say four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is still 3: pick {1,2} assigned to 1, {1,3} assigned to 3, {2,3} assigned to 2. The fourth team can&#39;t be assigned. So, the maximum remains 3.Alternatively, if the adversary creates multiple teams with the same two colors. For example, teams {1,2}, {1,2}, {3}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2 (from the two {1,2} teams assigned 1 and 2) plus 1 (the {3} team), totaling 3. Wait, but can you assign all three teams? Assign the first {1,2} to 1, the second {1,2} to 2, and {3} to 3. Yes, that works. So, even if you have multiple teams sharing colors, as long as all colors are covered, you can assign each color to a different team.Wait a second, maybe the key here is that since all n colors are present, you can always select one team per color. Because each color is present in at least one team. So, regardless of how the teams are structured, you can choose one team for each color, picking a team that includes that color. Then, assign each chosen team their respective color. Since each team is assigned only one color, and all colors are unique, this forms a color-identifiable set of size n. But this contradicts the earlier example where I thought with n=2, t=2, and multiple teams having both colors, you could only have a set of size 2. But in that case, n=2, and the maximum is 2, which is equal to n. So, perhaps the answer is always n, regardless of t? But that can&#39;t be.Wait, take n=2, t=2. As before, if all teams have both colors, then the maximum color-identifiable set is 2, since you can assign each of two teams a different color. If there are more than two teams, you still can only assign two teams, one for each color. So, the maximum is 2, which is n. So, even if teams have more colors, as long as you can pick one color per team without conflict, and since the total colors are n, you can always pick n teams. Wait, but how? If there are multiple teams per color, but each team can choose any of their colors. So, if you have multiple teams that include color 1, you can pick one of them to assign color 1, and ignore the others. Similarly for other colors. Since all n colors are present, you can pick one team per color. Therefore, the maximum color-identifiable set is at least n. Wait, but in the earlier case with n=3, t=2, even if teams have two colors, you can pick three teams, each assigned a different color. So, the maximum is n. So, perhaps g(n, t) = n for any t?But that can&#39;t be right. Suppose n=3, t=1. Then, each team has only one color. The maximum color-identifiable set is 3, which is n. If t=2, same. If t=3, same. So, maybe regardless of t, the answer is n. But this seems counterintuitive. Let me test another case.Suppose n=3, t=2. The adversary creates four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. Wait, but t=2, so the last team can&#39;t have three colors. So, teams can have at most two colors. So, maybe {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 3: assign {1,2} to 1, {1,3} to 3, {2,3} to 2. So, n=3. Alternatively, if the adversary creates teams such that color 1 is only in one team. For example, teams {1,2}, {3,2}, {3,2}, {3,2}. Then, color 1 is only in the first team. So, you have to assign color 1 to the first team. Then, color 3 and 2 are in the other teams. You can assign color 2 to one of the {3,2} teams, and color 3 to another. So, the maximum color-identifiable set is 3. So, even if some colors are only in one team, you can still assign that team to its unique color, and assign the other colors to other teams.Therefore, it seems that regardless of t, as long as all n colors are used, you can always find a color-identifiable set of size n. Therefore, g(n, t) = n.But this seems to conflict with the initial problem statement which differentiates based on t. The problem says &quot;each team can choose at most t distinctive colors&quot;. If the answer is always n regardless of t, then why specify t? So, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.Wait, let&#39;s consider a case where n=3, t=2. Suppose the adversary creates three teams: {1,2}, {1,2}, {3}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2: assign one {1,2} team to 1, another to 2, and the {3} team to 3. Wait, but that&#39;s three teams. So, the size is 3. But the two {1,2} teams can both be assigned to different colors. Wait, each {1,2} team can choose either 1 or 2. So, you can assign the first {1,2} team to 1, the second {1,2} team to 2, and the {3} team to 3. So, all three teams can be in the set. Therefore, the maximum is 3.Wait, so even if multiple teams share colors, as long as you can assign different colors to them, it&#39;s possible. Therefore, even with overlapping color sets, as long as there exists a way to assign distinct colors, the maximum is n. Therefore, is the answer always n?But then why does the problem mention t? If each team can have up to t colors, but the answer is always n, then t doesn&#39;t matter. There must be something wrong here.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Suppose n=2, t=2. Adversary creates three teams: {1,2}, {1,2}, {1,2}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2: assign two teams to color 1 and 2. But all teams are {1,2}, so you can only assign two teams. But in this case, the union of colors is {1,2}, so n=2. The maximum color-identifiable set is 2. So, even if all teams have both colors, you can still assign two teams. So, the maximum is 2, which is n.But what if the adversary creates a team that has only one color. For example, teams {1}, {2}, {1,2}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2: assign {1} to 1, {2} to 2. The third team can&#39;t be assigned. But wait, no. Actually, you can assign {1} to 1, {2} to 2, and {1,2} to either 1 or 2. But since 1 and 2 are already taken, you can&#39;t assign {1,2} team. So, the maximum is 2. But in this case, the union of colors is {1,2}, so n=2. So, the maximum color-identifiable set is 2, which is n. So, even if some teams have only one color, you can still pick n teams. Wait, in this example, you can only pick two teams. But n=2, so that&#39;s okay. So, the maximum is n.Alternatively, suppose n=3, t=2. Adversary creates four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3} (but t=2, so last team is invalid). If t=3, then the last team is allowed. But with t=2, the adversary can&#39;t have a team with three colors. So, teams are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}. Then, maximum color-identifiable set is 3: assign each of the three distinct color pairs to a different color. So, as before, you can always get n.Wait, maybe the key insight is that since all n colors are present, you can choose one team for each color, regardless of the teams&#39; other colors. Because for each color, there exists at least one team that has that color. Then, you can select such a team for each color and assign them their respective color. Since each selected team is assigned a unique color, this forms a color-identifiable set of size n. Therefore, regardless of t, the maximum is at least n. But can it be larger?No, because you can&#39;t have more teams than colors in a color-identifiable set, since each team must be assigned a unique color. So, the maximum possible is n. Therefore, g(n, t) = n.But this contradicts the problem statement&#39;s implication that t affects the result. Let me check the problem statement again:&quot;For a set S of teams, if each team in S can be assigned one of their distinctive colors such that no team in S is assigned any distinctive color of another team in S, then the set S is called &#39;color-identifiable.&#39; For all positive integers n, t, find the maximum value of the integer g(n, t) such that in any sports association where all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors, there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least g(n, t) teams.&quot;Wait, perhaps I misread. The problem says &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;. So, the union of all teams&#39; colors is exactly n. Therefore, each color is used by at least one team. Therefore, regardless of the team structure, you can always select one team per color, assign each their color, and get a color-identifiable set of size n. Therefore, the answer is n. Therefore, g(n, t) = n for any t.But that seems too straightforward, and the parameter t doesn&#39;t matter. Maybe there&#39;s a misunderstanding here.Wait, but if each team can choose at most t colors, but we have to assign each team in S a unique color from their own set. If multiple teams share a color, you can only assign that color to one team. But since all n colors are present, you need at least n teams to cover all colors. Wait, no. The set S is a subset of teams. So, S can be any size, but the assigned colors must be unique. So, the maximum size of S is n, since there are n colors. Therefore, regardless of the team structure, as long as all n colors are used, you can always find a subset S of size n where each team in S is assigned a unique color. Therefore, g(n, t) = n.But this seems to ignore t. For example, if t=1, then each team has only one color. Then, the color-identifiable set S would need to consist of one team per color, so exactly n teams. If t=2, each team has two colors, but you still need to pick one team per color. Since each color is present in at least one team, you can pick that team. So, even if a team has multiple colors, you can assign them the color that&#39;s unique to them. Wait, for example, suppose you have color 1 only in team A, which also has color 2. Then, you can assign team A to color 1, freeing up color 2 for another team. Wait, but color 2 might be present in another team. So, perhaps the key is to pick a set of teams such that each color is assigned to exactly one team, and each team is assigned one of its colors.This is equivalent to choosing a system of distinct representatives (SDR) for the family of sets (teams) where each set is the colors of a team. The classic Hall&#39;s theorem says that an SDR exists if and only if for every subset of teams, the union of their colors is at least as large as the number of teams. But here, we are not dealing with a specific family, but all possible families covering n colors with each team having at most t colors.But since the family must cover all n colors, and we need an SDR of size n (assign each color to a unique team), but in reality, we just need an SDR of size g(n, t), which is the maximum guaranteed.Wait, but Hall&#39;s theorem says that as long as for every subset of k teams, the union of their colors is at least k. Then, an SDR exists. But here, we can&#39;t guarantee that for an arbitrary family. However, since the problem states that the entire family covers n colors, but individual teams can have up to t colors. The question is, what&#39;s the minimal size of the maximum SDR across all such families.But if the entire family covers n colors, then for the whole family, the union is n. So, by Hall&#39;s theorem, if we take the whole family, the union is n, which is equal to the number of colors. But the number of teams can be larger than n. However, we need an SDR for a subset of the teams.Wait, perhaps not. The problem requires that there exists a subset S of teams such that each team in S is assigned a unique color from their own color set. This is equivalent to a matching in the bipartite graph between teams and colors. So, the question is, in any bipartite graph where the color side has n nodes, each team (the other side) has at most t edges, and all n colors are connected to at least one team, what is the minimal maximum matching size across all such graphs.The answer would be the minimal number g(n, t) such that every such graph has a matching of size at least g(n, t).Now, in bipartite graphs, the maximum matching size is at least the minimum of the two partitions. But here, the color partition has size n, and the team partition can be any size. But we are looking for the maximum matching size in the team partition.Wait, but since we can choose any subset of teams, the maximum matching size is up to n, because there are only n colors.But the question is, what&#39;s the minimal maximum matching over all possible such bipartite graphs. For example, take n=2, t=1. Then, the bipartite graph has two colors. Each team has exactly one color. Since all colors must be covered, there is at least one team per color. Then, the maximum matching is n=2. If t=2, then each team can have two colors. The worst case is when all teams are connected to both colors, but you can still assign each of two teams to a different color. So, maximum matching is 2. If the adversary adds more teams, you can still pick two teams. So, maximum matching is 2.Similarly, for n=3, t=2. The worst case is when the graph is such that the maximum matching is 3. Wait, but how could it be less? If you have three colors, each color is connected to at least one team. Even if teams are overlapping, you can assign each color to a different team.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach. For each color, pick a team that has that color. Assign that team to the color. This forms a matching. Since all colors are present, you can do this. Therefore, the maximum matching is at least n. But since there are only n colors, the maximum matching cannot exceed n. Therefore, the maximum matching is exactly n. Therefore, in any such graph, the maximum matching is n. Therefore, g(n, t) = n.But this seems to suggest that regardless of t, the answer is n. But this feels counterintuitive because if teams have more colors, the adversary might create overlaps that prevent a larger matching. But according to this logic, since all colors are present, you can always assign each color to a team that has it, resulting in a matching of size n. Therefore, g(n, t) = n for any t ≥ 1.But wait, if a team is assigned a color, it cannot be assigned another color. But in this case, we&#39;re assigning each color to a different team. So, even if a team has multiple colors, we only assign it one color. So, even if multiple teams share colors, we can pick different teams for each color.For example, if n=2, t=2. Teams: {1,2}, {1,2}. We can assign the first team to color 1, the second team to color 2. So, the matching is size 2. If there are three teams: {1,2}, {1,2}, {1,2}. Assign the first to 1, the second to 2. The third cannot be assigned. But the maximum matching is still 2, which is n=2.But in this case, the union of colors is 2, and n=2. Therefore, regardless of t, the maximum color-identifiable set is n. Therefore, g(n, t)=n.But this contradicts the problem&#39;s mention of t. Unless the problem has a different interpretation. Let me re-read the problem statement.&quot;For a set S of teams, if each team in S can be assigned one of their distinctive colors such that no team in S is assigned any distinctive color of another team in S, then the set S is called &#39;color-identifiable.&#39; For all positive integers n, t, find the maximum value of the integer g(n, t) such that in any sports association where all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors, there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least g(n, t) teams.&quot;Wait, the key might be that &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot;. So, the union of all teams&#39; colors is exactly n. Therefore, every color must be used by at least one team, but a team can use multiple colors. Then, the question is, in such a setup, what&#39;s the largest guaranteed size of a color-identifiable set.But if you can always pick one team per color, then the size is n. Even if teams share colors, you can pick different teams for each color. For example, if multiple teams have color 1, pick one of them to assign color 1. The rest can be assigned other colors if possible. But if you just need to pick a set S where each team is assigned a unique color, then you can pick S to be one team per color. Since every color is used by at least one team, this is possible. Therefore, the size is n.Wait, but maybe the problem is that a team can have multiple colors, but once you assign a color to a team, that color cannot be used by another team. So, if multiple teams share a color, you can only assign that color to one team. Therefore, to maximize the size of S, you need to pick teams such that their assigned colors are all distinct. Since there are n colors, the maximum possible S is n. But the question is whether you can always find S of size n. But if all teams have all n colors, then you can only pick one team, because all teams share all colors. Wait, no. If a team has all n colors, then you can assign it any color, but you can only assign one color to it. If all teams have all n colors, then you can pick any one team and assign it any color, but you can&#39;t assign colors to other teams without conflict. So, the maximum S would be 1, which is way less than n. But this contradicts the previous reasoning.Wait, this is a crucial point. If teams can have multiple colors, including all n colors, then assigning colors becomes problematic.Wait, hold on, in the problem statement, it says &quot;each team can choose at most t distinctive colors&quot;. So, a team cannot have more than t colors. So, if t is less than n, a team cannot have all n colors. So, in the case where t &lt; n, a team can have at most t colors. Therefore, if t &lt; n, you cannot have a team with all n colors. Therefore, in such a case, the previous reasoning might not hold.Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Suppose n=3, t=1. Then, each team has exactly one color. Since the union is three colors, there must be at least three teams, each with a distinct color. Therefore, the maximum color-identifiable set is 3.If n=3, t=2. The adversary could create three teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. Then, the maximum color-identifiable set is 3: assign each team a different color. If the adversary creates more teams, say four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2}. Then, the maximum is still 3: assign the first {1,2} to 1, {1,3} to 3, {2,3} to 2. The fourth team can&#39;t be assigned.But what if the adversary creates teams in such a way that some color is only present in one team. For example, teams {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}. But wait, n=4 here. But sticking to n=3, suppose teams {1,2}, {1,2}, {3}. Then, you have to assign color 3 to the third team. Then, you can assign either color 1 or 2 to the first two teams. But you can only assign one of them to 1 and the other to 2. Therefore, the maximum color-identifiable set is 3.Wait, so even if a color is only present in one team, you have to assign that team to that color. Then, other colors can be assigned to other teams. So, regardless of the structure, as long as all colors are present, you can assign each color to a team that has it, possibly needing to choose one team per color. Therefore, the maximum color-identifiable set is always n.But in the case where a team has multiple colors, but you have to assign each team only one color. So, even if a team has multiple colors, you can choose which one to assign. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting a system of distinct representatives (SDR) for the family of color sets. By Hall&#39;s theorem, an SDR exists if for every subset of teams, the union of their colors is at least the size of the subset. However, in our case, we are not given a specific family, but we need to guarantee that in any family (satisfying the union of all colors is n and each team has at most t colors), there exists an SDR of size g(n, t).But if the entire family has union n, then for the whole family, the union is n. If we take a subset of k teams, the union of their colors could be as small as... Well, if the adversary arranges the teams such that many teams share colors, the union could be small. For example, if all teams share a single color, but they have to cover all n colors, so that&#39;s impossible. Wait, no. The problem states that the union of all teams&#39; colors is exactly n, so every color must be in at least one team. So, the adversary cannot have all teams share a single color; they must include all n colors.But even so, the adversary could structure the teams such that most teams share many colors, but still cover all n colors. For example, n=3, t=2. Adversary creates teams {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, and multiple copies of {1,2}. But to cover all colors, they need at least the three initial teams. Then, the maximum SDR is 3, as you can pick the three original teams. The copies can&#39;t increase the SDR beyond 3.Alternatively, suppose n=3, t=2. Adversary creates teams {1,2}, {1,2}, {1,2}, but also {3}. Then, the maximum SDR is 2 (from the {1,2} teams) plus 1 (from {3}), totaling 3. So, you can still get n.Therefore, it seems that regardless of how the adversary arranges the teams, as long as all colors are covered, you can always find an SDR of size n. Therefore, g(n, t) = n.But then why does the problem mention t? Maybe I&#39;m missing something.Wait, consider the following case: n=3, t=1. So, each team has exactly one color. The adversary must include all three colors. Therefore, there must be at least three teams, each with a distinct color. Hence, the maximum SDR is 3. If the adversary adds more teams, say four teams: three with unique colors and one duplicate. Then, the maximum SDR is still 3.If n=3, t=2. Suppose the adversary creates three teams: {1,2}, {1,2}, {3}. Then, the maximum SDR is 3: assign {1,2} to 1, {1,2} to 2, and {3} to 3. So, even with overlapping teams, you can assign different colors.Wait, but in this case, two teams have {1,2}. Assigning one to 1 and the other to 2 allows both to be in the SDR. Then, {3} is assigned 3. So, that&#39;s three teams. Hence, regardless of overlaps, you can always assign the colors appropriately.Therefore, it seems that as long as each color is present in at least one team, you can choose an SDR of size n by selecting one team per color and assigning that color to the team. Therefore, regardless of t, the answer is n. Hence, g(n, t) = n.But the problem states &quot;each team can choose at most t distinctive colors&quot;. If the answer is always n, then why is t mentioned? Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let&#39;s think of a different angle. Suppose n=4, t=2. The adversary creates four teams: {1,2}, {1,2}, {3,4}, {3,4}. So, two teams with {1,2}, two teams with {3,4}. Now, the maximum SDR would be 4: assign {1,2} to 1, another {1,2} to 2, {3,4} to 3, and another {3,4} to 4. So, that&#39;s four teams. So, even though the teams overlap in colors, you can still assign different colors to different teams.Alternatively, if the adversary creates four teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}. But wait, n=4, so there is no color 5. So, n=4, colors are 1-4. Teams: {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,2}. The maximum SDR would be 4? Wait, no. Because color 1 is in all teams. If you try to assign color 1 to one team, say the first team. Then, the other teams can be assigned their other colors: {1,3} can be assigned 3, {1,4} can be assigned 4, and the fourth team {1,2} can be assigned 2. So, all four teams can be in the SDR. So, maximum SDR is 4.Wait, but color 1 is assigned to the first team, and the fourth team is assigned color 2. But the fourth team has {1,2}, so it&#39;s allowed. So, in this case, even though all teams share color 1, you can assign color 1 to one team and assign the other colors to the remaining teams. Thus, the maximum SDR is n=4.Therefore, regardless of how the adversary overlaps the colors, as long as all n colors are present, you can assign each color to a team that contains it, possibly using different colors for teams that have multiple options. Therefore, the maximum SDR is always n. Therefore, g(n, t) = n for any t ≥ 1.But this seems to make the problem trivial, and the parameter t irrelevant. However, the problem statement specifies &quot;each team can choose at most t distinctive colors&quot;. Maybe the misunderstanding is in the problem&#39;s phrasing. Perhaps &quot;consist of exactly n different colors&quot; means that each team must use exactly n colors, but that doesn&#39;t make sense. Or maybe &quot;all teams&#39; distinctive colors consist of exactly n different colors&quot; means that the entire association uses exactly n colors, which is how I interpreted it.Given this, I think the answer is g(n, t) = n. However, this contradicts the parameter t being mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different interpretation where &quot;distinctive colors&quot; for a team are unique to that team, but that&#39;s not the standard interpretation.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when you assign a color to a team, that color cannot be used by any other team in the set S, even if the other team also has that color. Therefore, if multiple teams share a color, only one can be assigned that color, limiting the size of S. But in that case, the maximum S would be the size of a matching in the bipartite graph, which can be as low as ceiling(m / t), but I&#39;m not sure.Wait, no. Let&#39;s model this as a bipartite graph with colors on one side and teams on the other. An edge connects a color to a team if the team has that color. A color-identifiable set S is a matching in this graph where each team in S is matched to one of its colors. The size of the maximum matching is what we need.In bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching is at least the minimum of the two partitions. But here, the colors are n, and the teams are arbitrary. However, each team has at most t edges.But according to König&#39;s theorem, in bipartite graphs, the maximum matching size equals the minimum vertex cover size. But I&#39;m not sure how that helps here.Alternatively, consider that each color can be assigned to at most one team. Therefore, the maximum matching size cannot exceed n. But we need to find the minimal maximum matching over all possible such graphs.But if all n colors are present, then in the worst case, the maximum matching is n. For example, if each color is present in exactly one team, then the maximum matching is n. If colors are present in multiple teams, you can still assign them to different teams. Therefore, the maximum matching is n.Wait, but suppose we have a color that is present in many teams. For example, color 1 is present in k teams. Then, in the maximum matching, color 1 can be assigned to only one of those k teams. The other teams must be assigned other colors. But as long as all other colors are present in other teams, you can assign those colors to other teams.Therefore, even if a color is heavily shared, as long as every color is present in at least one team, you can form a matching of size n by assigning each color to a team that has it. Therefore, the maximum is always n. Hence, g(n, t) = n.But this seems to ignore t. For example, if t=1, the answer is n. If t=2, the answer is also n. So, t doesn&#39;t affect the result. But the problem mentions &quot;each team can choose at most t distinctive colors&quot;, so why is t a parameter? Maybe the original problem has a typo, or perhaps I&#39;m missing a key detail.Wait, another thought: maybe the problem requires that each team&#39;s assigned color is unique not just within the set S, but globally. But no, the problem states &quot;no team in S is assigned any distinctive color of another team in S&quot;. So, it&#39;s only within S. Therefore, two teams not in S can share colors, but within S, the assigned colors must be unique.Therefore, the size of S is limited by the number of colors, n. Hence, the maximum S is n. And since all colors are present, you can always form such a set. Therefore, g(n, t)=n.But if that&#39;s the case, then the answer is simply n for any t. But this seems too straightforward, and the parameter t is irrelevant. Maybe the original problem intended something else. Perhaps the set S must have each team&#39;s colors all distinct from each other, not just the assigned colors. But the problem states &quot;assigned one of their distinctive colors such that no team in S is assigned any distinctive color of another team in S&quot;. So, only the assigned colors need to be distinct. The teams can have other colors, but those aren&#39;t assigned.Therefore, even if two teams in S share a color not assigned to them, it&#39;s okay. Only the assigned colors must be unique. Therefore, as long as you can assign distinct colors to the teams in S, it&#39;s acceptable. Hence, the problem reduces to finding a matching of size g(n, t) in the bipartite graph, which as reasoned before, is always n.Therefore, I think the correct answer is g(n, t) = n. However, given that the problem specifies t, I&#39;m concerned I might have missed something. Maybe the original problem was different, but based on the current description, the answer seems to be n.But let&#39;s check an example where t is small. Suppose n=4, t=2. The adversary creates four teams: {1,2}, {3,4}, {1,3}, {2,4}. Now, can we assign each team a unique color? Let&#39;s see. Assign {1,2} to 1, {3,4} to 3, {1,3} to 1... Wait, conflict. Alternatively, assign {1,2} to 2, {3,4} to 4, {1,3} to 1, {2,4} to 2. Still conflicts. Wait, perhaps this is a bad example. Let me pick a different one.Another example: four teams {1,2}, {1,2}, {3,4}, {3,4}. Assign {1,2} to 1, {1,2} to 2, {3,4} to 3, {3,4} to 4. That&#39;s four teams assigned unique colors. So, S size 4.Alternatively, if the adversary creates eight teams, all {1,2}. But they must also include teams with colors 3 and 4. So, teams {1,2}, {1,2}, ..., {3}, {4}. Then, assign {3} to 3, {4} to 4, and two of the {1,2} teams to 1 and 2. So, S size 4.Therefore, regardless of t, you can always assign n colors to n teams. Therefore, the answer is n.But according to this, the answer is n. However, this seems to disregard the parameter t. Maybe the problem was intended to have teams with exactly t colors, but it says &quot;at most t&quot;. If it were &quot;exactly t&quot;, the answer might differ. But as stated, it&#39;s &quot;at most t&quot;.Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that all colors of a team are unique across the set S, not just the assigned one. For example, if a team has colors {1,2}, and another team has {1,3}, then even if you assign them different colors, their color sets overlap, which might violate some condition. But the problem statement says: &quot;no team in S is assigned any distinctive color of another team in S&quot;. So, only the assigned colors need to be distinct. The other colors in the team&#39;s palette don&#39;t matter.Therefore, the answer is indeed n. Therefore, the maximum value of g(n, t) is n.But the problem is from a competition or textbook, perhaps expecting a different answer. Let me recall that in hypergraphs, the maximum matching size can be related to the degrees and overlaps, but in this specific case, since all hyperedges (teams) must cover the entire vertex set (colors), the matching can always cover all vertices. Therefore, the maximum matching is n.Therefore, after careful consideration and multiple examples, I think the answer is n. Hence, g(n, t) = n.Final AnswerThe maximum value of ( g(n, t) ) is boxed{n}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum value of ( g(n, t) ) such that in any sports association with exactly ( n ) different colors and each team choosing at most ( t ) colors, there always exists a color-identifiable set of at least ( g(n, t) ) teams, we need to consider the following reasoning:1. Definition of Color-Identifiable Set: A set ( S ) of teams is color-identifiable if each team in ( S ) can be assigned one of their distinctive colors such that no two teams in ( S ) share the same assigned color. This is equivalent to finding a matching in a bipartite graph where one partition represents colors and the other represents teams.2. Hall&#39;s Theorem and System of Distinct Representatives (SDR): The problem reduces to finding a system of distinct representatives (SDR) for the family of sets (teams) where each set is the colors of a team. Hall&#39;s theorem states that an SDR exists if and only if for every subset of teams, the union of their colors is at least the size of the subset. However, since the union of all teams&#39; colors must be exactly ( n ), every color must be present in at least one team.3. Key Insight: Since all ( n ) colors are present in the association, we can always select one team for each color such that each team is assigned a unique color. This forms a color-identifiable set of size ( n ). Even if teams share colors, we can assign different colors to different teams as long as each color is present in at least one team.4. Parameter ( t ): The parameter ( t ) (the maximum number of colors each team can choose) does not affect the result because the problem guarantees that all ( n ) colors are used. Each team can have at most ( t ) colors, but since every color is present, we can always find a team for each color and assign it uniquely.5. Conclusion: Regardless of the value of ( t ), the maximum color-identifiable set size is always ( n ) because we can always assign each color to a unique team. Therefore, the answer is ( g(n, t) = n ).[boxed{n}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ddfc8c3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>🔑:</span>1.

So, the problem is about Peter having 5 rabbit cages arranged in a row. Each cage has at least one rabbit. Two rabbits are neighbors if they&#39;re in the same cage or in adjacent cages. Each rabbit has either 3 or 7 neighbors. We need to find how many rabbits are in the central cage.First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I get all the details. There are 5 cages in a row, each with at least one rabbit. So, the minimum number of rabbits is 5, one in each cage. But there could be more. The neighbor definition is key here: two rabbits are neighbors if they are in the same cage or in adjacent cages. So, for any rabbit, their neighbors include all the rabbits in their own cage and any rabbits in the cage immediately to the left or right.Each rabbit has either 3 or 7 neighbors. So, every rabbit&#39;s neighbor count is exactly 3 or exactly 7. We need to figure out how many rabbits are in the central cage (which would be cage number 3, since there are five in a row).Let me try to model this. Let&#39;s denote the number of rabbits in each cage as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ), where each ( a_i geq 1 ). The problem is to find ( a_3 ).Now, let&#39;s think about the number of neighbors a rabbit in a particular cage would have. For a rabbit in cage ( i ), the number of neighbors is:- The number of rabbits in cage ( i ) (since all in the same cage are neighbors),- Plus the number of rabbits in cage ( i-1 ) (if ( i &gt; 1 )),- Plus the number of rabbits in cage ( i+1 ) (if ( i &lt; 5 )).So, for example, a rabbit in cage 1 would have neighbors equal to ( a_1 + a_2 ).Similarly, a rabbit in cage 2 would have ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ).A rabbit in cage 3 would have ( a_2 + a_3 + a_4 ).Cage 4: ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 ).Cage 5: ( a_4 + a_5 ).But each rabbit must have exactly 3 or 7 neighbors. So, for each cage, all rabbits in that cage must have the same number of neighbors? Wait, no. Wait a second. Each individual rabbit has neighbors. So, if two rabbits are in the same cage, their neighbor counts could be different if, say, their cage is adjacent to different numbers of rabbits. Wait, no. Wait, no. If they are in the same cage, then their neighbors include all in their own cage and adjacent cages. So, for example, two rabbits in cage 2 would both have neighbors equal to ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ). So, all rabbits in the same cage have the same number of neighbors. Therefore, each cage&#39;s rabbits must have either 3 or 7 neighbors. So, per cage, the number of neighbors for each rabbit in that cage is fixed. So, for each cage ( i ), the value ( n_i = ) number of neighbors per rabbit in cage ( i ) is either 3 or 7.Therefore, for each cage, we can compute ( n_i ), which is:- For cage 1: ( n_1 = a_1 + a_2 )- For cage 2: ( n_2 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 )- For cage 3: ( n_3 = a_2 + a_3 + a_4 )- For cage 4: ( n_4 = a_3 + a_4 + a_5 )- For cage 5: ( n_5 = a_4 + a_5 )And each ( n_i ) is either 3 or 7. Also, each ( a_i geq 1 ).So, we have equations:1. ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ) or ( 7 )2. ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3 ) or ( 7 )3. ( a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3 ) or ( 7 )4. ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 ) or ( 7 )5. ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ) or ( 7 )With each ( a_i geq 1 ).So, the problem reduces to solving these equations where each ( a_i ) is a positive integer, and the sums as specified are either 3 or 7. We need to find ( a_3 ).Let me try to approach this step by step.First, let&#39;s consider the first equation: ( a_1 + a_2 ) is either 3 or 7. Similarly, the fifth equation: ( a_4 + a_5 ) is either 3 or 7.Since ( a_1, a_2, a_4, a_5 geq 1 ), possible values for ( a_1 + a_2 ):If 3: Then possible (1,2), (2,1). Since order matters (cages are in a row). Similarly, if 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). But considering that ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) must be at least 1. Similarly for ( a_4 + a_5 ).Similarly, equations 2 and 4 involve three variables. Let&#39;s see how these equations might interact.Let me start by assuming that ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ). Then, equation 2 becomes ( 3 + a_3 = 3 ) or ( 7 ). If ( 3 + a_3 = 3 ), then ( a_3 = 0 ), but that&#39;s impossible since ( a_3 geq 1 ). So, equation 2 must be 7, so ( 3 + a_3 = 7 implies a_3 = 4 ). So, if ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ), then ( a_3 = 4 ).Alternatively, if ( a_1 + a_2 = 7 ), then equation 2 is ( 7 + a_3 ) is either 3 or 7. But ( 7 + a_3 geq 8 ), so it can&#39;t be 3 or 7. Therefore, this case is impossible. Therefore, ( a_1 + a_2 ) must be 3, and thus ( a_3 = 4 ).Wait, hold on. Let me check that again.If ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ), then equation 2: ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3 + a_3 ). This must equal 3 or 7. If it&#39;s 3, then ( a_3 = 0 ), which is invalid. Therefore, it must be 7. So ( 3 + a_3 = 7 implies a_3 = 4 ). Therefore, ( a_3 = 4 ). That seems straightforward.Similarly, looking at the fifth equation: ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ) or 7. Then equation 4: ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 ). If ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ), then equation 4 is ( a_3 + 3 ). But ( a_3 = 4 ), so ( 4 + 3 = 7 ), which is acceptable. If ( a_4 + a_5 = 7 ), then equation 4 would be ( 4 + 7 = 11 ), which is not 3 or 7. Therefore, ( a_4 + a_5 ) must be 3, so equation 4 is 7. Therefore, ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ).So, summarizing:From the left side:- ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 )- ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 7 implies a_3 = 4 )From the right side:- ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 )- ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 7 implies 4 + a_4 + a_5 = 7 implies a_4 + a_5 = 3 )Therefore, we have:( a_1 + a_2 = 3 )( a_4 + a_5 = 3 )( a_3 = 4 )Now, the middle equation is equation 3: ( a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3 ) or 7.Since ( a_3 = 4 ), this becomes ( a_2 + 4 + a_4 = 3 ) or 7. ( a_2 + a_4 + 4 = 3 ) is impossible because ( a_2, a_4 geq 1 implies a_2 + a_4 geq 2 implies total geq 6 ). Therefore, equation 3 must equal 7. So,( a_2 + 4 + a_4 = 7 implies a_2 + a_4 = 3 )But ( a_2 geq 1 ), ( a_4 geq 1 ), so possible pairs for ( a_2 + a_4 = 3 ) are (1,2) or (2,1). So, either ( a_2 = 1, a_4 = 2 ) or ( a_2 = 2, a_4 = 1 ).Now, let&#39;s tie this back to ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ) and ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ).If ( a_2 = 1 ), then ( a_1 = 3 - a_2 = 2 ). Then, since ( a_4 = 2 ), ( a_5 = 3 - a_4 = 1 ).If ( a_2 = 2 ), then ( a_1 = 3 - a_2 = 1 ). Then, ( a_4 = 1 ), so ( a_5 = 3 - a_4 = 2 ).Therefore, we have two possible configurations:Case 1:( a_1 = 2 ), ( a_2 = 1 ), ( a_3 = 4 ), ( a_4 = 2 ), ( a_5 = 1 )Case 2:( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_2 = 2 ), ( a_3 = 4 ), ( a_4 = 1 ), ( a_5 = 2 )Now, let&#39;s verify if these configurations satisfy all the neighbor conditions.First, check each cage&#39;s neighbor count:For Case 1:Cage 1: ( a_1 + a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 ). So, each rabbit in cage 1 has 3 neighbors. Good.Cage 2: ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 ). So, each rabbit in cage 2 has 7 neighbors. Good.Cage 3: ( a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7 ). So, each rabbit in cage 3 has 7 neighbors. Good.Cage 4: ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 ). So, each rabbit in cage 4 has 7 neighbors. Good.Cage 5: ( a_4 + a_5 = 2 + 1 = 3 ). Each rabbit in cage 5 has 3 neighbors. Good.All cages have rabbits with either 3 or 7 neighbors. So, Case 1 works.Case 2:Cage 1: ( a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 ). So, 3 neighbors. Good.Cage 2: ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 ). 7 neighbors. Good.Cage 3: ( a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 ). 7 neighbors. Good.Cage 4: ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 ). 7 neighbors. Good.Cage 5: ( a_4 + a_5 = 1 + 2 = 3 ). 3 neighbors. Good.So, both cases satisfy all the conditions. Therefore, regardless of whether ( a_2 ) is 1 or 2, ( a_3 = 4 ).Therefore, the number of rabbits in the central cage is 4.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there could be any other possibilities. For example, could there be a case where some of the equations have different assignments of 3 or 7? Wait, earlier when we considered equations 1 and 2, we saw that if ( a_1 + a_2 = 7 ), equation 2 would become ( 7 + a_3 ), which would have to be 3 or 7, but 7 + anything is at least 8, so that&#39;s invalid. Similarly, for ( a_4 + a_5 = 7 ), equation 4 would be 4 + 7 = 11, which isn&#39;t allowed. So, those possibilities are excluded. Therefore, the only possible solutions are the two cases we found, both leading to ( a_3 = 4 ).Therefore, the answer should be 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Given that Peter has 5 rabbit cages in a row, each containing at least one rabbit, and each rabbit has either 3 or 7 neighbors, we need to determine the number of rabbits in the central cage.We denote the number of rabbits in each cage as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ). The key steps are as follows:1. Neighbor Calculation:   - For a rabbit in cage ( i ), the number of neighbors is the sum of rabbits in the same cage and adjacent cages.   - Each rabbit&#39;s neighbors must be either 3 or 7.2. Equations:   - Cage 1: ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ) or 7   - Cage 2: ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3 ) or 7   - Cage 3: ( a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3 ) or 7   - Cage 4: ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 ) or 7   - Cage 5: ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ) or 73. Solving the Equations:   - From cages 1 and 2: If ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ), then ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 7 ) implies ( a_3 = 4 ).   - From cages 4 and 5: If ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ), then ( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 7 ) implies ( a_4 + a_5 = 3 ).   - For cage 3: ( a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 7 ) implies ( a_2 + a_4 = 3 ).4. Possible Configurations:   - ( a_2 ) and ( a_4 ) can be (1, 2) or (2, 1), leading to two valid configurations:     - Case 1: ( a_1 = 2 ), ( a_2 = 1 ), ( a_3 = 4 ), ( a_4 = 2 ), ( a_5 = 1 )     - Case 2: ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_2 = 2 ), ( a_3 = 4 ), ( a_4 = 1 ), ( a_5 = 2 )Both configurations satisfy all neighbor conditions, confirming that the number of rabbits in the central cage ( a_3 ) is 4.[boxed{4}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Peter has 5 rabbit cages arranged in a row, each with at least one rabbit. Each rabbit has either 3 or 7 neighbors. Neighbors are defined as rabbits in the same cage or in adjacent cages. We need to find how many rabbits are in the central cage.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are five cages in a row: Cage 1, Cage 2, Cage 3 (central), Cage 4, Cage 5. Each cage has at least one rabbit. Every rabbit in these cages has either 3 or 7 neighbors. A neighbor is another rabbit in the same cage or in an adjacent cage. So, for example, a rabbit in Cage 2 could have neighbors in Cage 1, Cage 2, or Cage 3. Similarly, a rabbit in Cage 3 could have neighbors in Cage 2, Cage 3, or Cage 4.Now, each rabbit must have exactly 3 or 7 neighbors. The question is to determine how many rabbits are in Cage 3. Let&#39;s think about how a rabbit&#39;s number of neighbors is determined. The number of neighbors a rabbit has depends on the number of rabbits in its own cage and the adjacent cages. For instance, a rabbit in Cage 1 can only have neighbors from Cage 1 and Cage 2. Similarly, a rabbit in Cage 5 can only have neighbors from Cage 4 and Cage 5. The rabbits in the middle cages (2, 3, 4) can have neighbors from three cages: the previous one, their own, and the next one.Since each cage has at least one rabbit, we can&#39;t have any empty cages. Let me try to model this. Let&#39;s denote the number of rabbits in each cage as a, b, c, d, e for cages 1 to 5 respectively. So, a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1, c ≥ 1, d ≥ 1, e ≥ 1.Each rabbit in Cage 1 will have neighbors equal to the number of rabbits in Cage 1 plus the number in Cage 2. Similarly, each rabbit in Cage 2 will have neighbors equal to rabbits in Cage 1 + Cage 2 + Cage 3. Wait, but for each individual rabbit, the number of neighbors is the total number of rabbits in their own cage and adjacent cages. So, if a rabbit is in Cage 1, the total neighbors are a + b. Similarly, for Cage 2, it&#39;s a + b + c. Wait, but no, that can&#39;t be right. Wait, no, neighbors are per rabbit. So, each rabbit in Cage 1 is in a cage with a-1 other rabbits (since there are a rabbits total), and the rabbits in Cage 2. So the total neighbors for a rabbit in Cage 1 would be (a - 1) + b. Similarly, for a rabbit in Cage 2, it would be (b - 1) + a + c. Wait, hold on, that might be a different way to count.Wait, the problem says two rabbits are neighbors if they are in the same cage or adjacent cages. So, for any rabbit, the number of neighbors is the total number of rabbits in its own cage (including itself?) minus 1 (since a rabbit can&#39;t be its own neighbor) plus the number of rabbits in adjacent cages. Wait, no. If they are in the same cage, all rabbits in that cage are neighbors. So, for a rabbit in Cage 1, the neighbors are all rabbits in Cage 1 (including itself? Wait, no, neighbor is another rabbit. So, in the same cage, how many neighbors? If there are a rabbits in Cage 1, then each rabbit in Cage 1 has a - 1 neighbors from Cage 1. Then, from Cage 2, they have b neighbors. So total neighbors would be (a - 1) + b. Similarly, a rabbit in Cage 2 would have (b - 1) neighbors in Cage 2, plus a neighbors in Cage 1 and c neighbors in Cage 3. So total neighbors: (b - 1) + a + c.Similarly, a rabbit in Cage 3 would have (c - 1) neighbors in Cage 3, plus b neighbors in Cage 2 and d neighbors in Cage 4. So total neighbors: (c - 1) + b + d.A rabbit in Cage 4 would have (d - 1) + c + e, and a rabbit in Cage 5 would have (e - 1) + d.Each of these totals must be either 3 or 7. So, for each cage, the number of neighbors for each rabbit in that cage is either 3 or 7. Therefore, for each cage, the expression (number of rabbits in own cage minus 1) plus number of rabbits in adjacent cages must equal 3 or 7. Since all rabbits in the same cage have the same number of neighbors (because their own cage count and adjacent cages are fixed for all rabbits in that cage), each cage&#39;s neighbor count must be either 3 or 7. So, for example, in Cage 1, we have (a - 1) + b = 3 or 7. Similarly for all other cages.Therefore, we can write equations for each cage:Cage 1: (a - 1) + b = 3 or 7  Cage 2: (b - 1) + a + c = 3 or 7  Cage 3: (c - 1) + b + d = 3 or 7  Cage 4: (d - 1) + c + e = 3 or 7  Cage 5: (e - 1) + d = 3 or 7  Since each cage has at least one rabbit, a, b, c, d, e ≥ 1. Also, these variables are positive integers.Our goal is to find c. Let&#39;s try to solve these equations step by step.Starting with Cage 1: (a - 1) + b = 3 or 7. Let&#39;s denote this as:Case 1: (a - 1) + b = 3  Case 2: (a - 1) + b = 7Similarly for each cage. But since the cages are connected, the variables are related. Let&#39;s try to handle this step by step.Let me start with Cage 1. Let&#39;s suppose that Cage 1 has a rabbits and Cage 2 has b rabbits. So, (a - 1) + b must be 3 or 7. Let&#39;s analyze possible values.Possible values for a and b (since a ≥1, b ≥1):If (a -1) + b = 3, then a + b = 4. Since a ≥1 and b ≥1, possible pairs (a, b) are (1,3), (2,2), (3,1).If (a -1) + b = 7, then a + b = 8. Possible pairs (a, b) are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2), (7,1).Similarly, for Cage 5: (e -1) + d = 3 or 7. So same as Cage 1, mirrored. So possible (d, e) pairs:If (e -1) + d = 3, then d + e = 4. Possible (1,3), (2,2), (3,1).  If (e -1) + d = 7, then d + e = 8. Possible (1,7), (2,6), ..., (7,1).Now, moving to Cage 2: (b -1) + a + c = 3 or 7. Let&#39;s denote this as:Either (b -1) + a + c = 3 ⇒ a + b + c = 4  Or (b -1) + a + c = 7 ⇒ a + b + c = 8Similarly, Cage 4: (d -1) + c + e = 3 or 7 ⇒ same as Cage 2, mirrored. So:Either c + d + e = 4  Or c + d + e = 8Cage 3: (c -1) + b + d = 3 or 7. So:Either (c -1) + b + d = 3 ⇒ b + c + d = 4  Or (c -1) + b + d = 7 ⇒ b + c + d = 8So, now we have equations for each cage. Let&#39;s see if we can link these equations.First, note that the equations for Cage 1 and Cage 5 are similar, and Cage 2 and Cage 4 are similar, with Cage 3 in the center.Let me try to first consider possible cases for Cage 1 and Cage 5.Case 1: Both Cage 1 and Cage 5 have neighbor counts of 3. So:For Cage 1: (a -1) + b = 3 ⇒ a + b = 4  For Cage 5: (e -1) + d = 3 ⇒ d + e = 4Then, moving to Cage 2 and Cage 4:Cage 2: a + b + c = 4 or 8  But since a + b = 4 (from Cage 1), then Cage 2 equation becomes 4 + c = 4 or 8 ⇒ c = 0 or 4. But c ≥1, so c = 4.Similarly, Cage 4: c + d + e = 4 or 8. Since d + e =4 (from Cage 5), then 4 + c = 4 or 8 ⇒ c = 0 or 4. Again, c =4.Then, moving to Cage 3: b + c + d = 4 or 8. From Cage 1: a + b =4. From Cage 5: d + e =4. From Cage 2 and 4, c=4. Now, we need to find b and d. Let&#39;s note that:From Cage 1: a =4 - b  From Cage 5: e =4 - d  From Cage 2: a + b + c = 8 (since c=4, 4 + b + a =8, but a + b =4, so 4 +4=8, which works). Wait, no. Wait, Cage 2&#39;s equation is (b -1) + a + c = 3 or 7. Wait, no, in this case, since we considered that Cage 1 had a neighbor count of 3, which gives a + b =4. Then, Cage 2&#39;s neighbor count is (b -1) + a + c. But since Cage 2&#39;s neighbor count must be either 3 or7, we have (b -1) + a + c =3 or7. But a + b =4 (from Cage1), so substituting a =4 - b into Cage2&#39;s equation:(b -1) + (4 - b) + c =3 or7  Simplify: (b -1 +4 - b) + c =3 or7  So (3) + c =3 or7  Therefore, 3 + c =3 ⇒ c=0, which is invalid, or 3 + c=7 ⇒ c=4. So c=4.Similarly, in Cage4: (d -1) + c + e =3 or7. From Cage5, d + e=4, so e=4 - d. Substitute into Cage4&#39;s equation:(d -1) + c + (4 - d) =3 or7  Simplify: (d -1 +4 - d) + c =3 or7  (3) + c =3 or7 ⇒ same as Cage2: c=0 or4, so c=4.Thus, c=4. Then, moving to Cage3: (c -1) + b + d =3 or7. c=4, so 3 + b + d =3 or7. Therefore:3 + b + d =3 ⇒ b + d =0, impossible, or 3 + b + d =7 ⇒ b + d =4.But from Cage1: a + b =4 ⇒ a=4 - b  From Cage5: d + e=4 ⇒ e=4 - d  We also have from Cage3: b + d=4Thus, variables a, b, d, e are related by a=4 - b, e=4 - d, and b + d=4.Since a ≥1, e ≥1, we have:a=4 - b ≥1 ⇒ b ≤3  e=4 - d ≥1 ⇒ d ≤3But also, since b ≥1 and d ≥1, and b + d=4, possible pairs (b, d) are (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Then:If (b, d)=(1,3): a=4 -1=3, e=4 -3=1  If (b, d)=(2,2): a=4 -2=2, e=4 -2=2  If (b, d)=(3,1): a=4 -3=1, e=4 -1=3  So possible assignments:Case1a: a=3, b=1, c=4, d=3, e=1  Case1b: a=2, b=2, c=4, d=2, e=2  Case1c: a=1, b=3, c=4, d=1, e=3  Now, check if these satisfy all equations.First, for Cage2: (b -1) + a + c. Let&#39;s take each subcase:Case1a: b=1, a=3, c=4  (1 -1) +3 +4=0 +7=7, which is allowed (either 3 or7). Good.Case1b: b=2, a=2, c=4  (2 -1) +2 +4=1 +6=7. Good.Case1c: b=3, a=1, c=4  (3 -1) +1 +4=2 +5=7. Good.Similarly, check Cage4: (d -1) + c + e.Case1a: d=3, c=4, e=1  (3 -1)+4 +1=2 +5=7. Good.Case1b: d=2, c=4, e=2  (2 -1)+4 +2=1 +6=7. Good.Case1c: d=1, c=4, e=3  (1 -1)+4 +3=0 +7=7. Good.Cage3: Already handled, which gave us b + d=4 and c=4. So all equations are satisfied. Also, all cages have at least one rabbit. So these are valid solutions.Therefore, in this case, the number of rabbits in the central cage is 4.Now, let&#39;s check if there are other cases where either Cage1 or Cage5 has neighbor counts of 7, leading to different values of c.Case2: Cage1 has neighbor count 3 (a + b =4) and Cage5 has neighbor count7 (d + e =8)So, Cage1: a + b=4  Cage5: d + e=8Then, moving to Cage2: (b -1) + a + c =3 or7. Since a + b=4, substitute a=4 - b:(b -1) + (4 - b) + c =3 or7  Simplify: (b -1 +4 -b) +c =3 or7  3 + c =3 or7 ⇒ c=0 or4. c=4.Similarly, Cage4: (d -1) + c + e =3 or7. Since d + e=8, substitute e=8 - d:(d -1) + c + (8 - d)=3 or7  Simplify: (d -1 +8 -d) +c =7 +c  So, 7 + c =3 or7 ⇒ 7 +c=3 ⇒ c=-4 (invalid) or 7 +c=7 ⇒c=0. But c≥1. Therefore, no solution here.Thus, this case is invalid.Case3: Cage1 has neighbor count7 (a + b=8) and Cage5 has neighbor count3 (d + e=4)Similarly, this would be symmetric to Case2. Let&#39;s check:Cage1: a + b=8  Cage5: d + e=4Cage2: (b -1) + a + c. Substitute a=8 - b:(b -1) + (8 - b) +c =7 +c. So 7 +c=3 or7 ⇒c=-4 or0. Invalid. Thus, no solution.Cage4: (d -1) + c + e. Since d + e=4, e=4 - d. Substitute:(d -1) + c + (4 - d) =3 +c. So 3 +c=3 or7 ⇒c=0 or4. c=4. But then Cage2 would require c=0 or -4. Contradiction. Thus, no solution.Case4: Both Cage1 and Cage5 have neighbor counts of7. So:Cage1: a + b=8  Cage5: d + e=8Then, Cage2: (b -1) + a + c. Substitute a=8 -b:(b -1) + (8 -b) +c=7 +c=3 or7. Thus, 7 +c=3⇒c=-4 invalid, or 7 +c=7⇒c=0 invalid. Hence, no solution.Cage4: Similarly, (d -1) + c + e=7 +c. Since d + e=8, e=8 - d. Substitute:(d -1) + c + (8 - d)=7 +c=3 or7. Same as above, c=0 invalid. So no solution.Therefore, the only valid case is Case1 where both Cage1 and Cage5 have neighbor counts of3, leading to c=4. The other cases lead to contradictions or invalid numbers of rabbits. Therefore, the number of rabbits in the central cage must be 4.But wait, let&#39;s confirm if there are other possibilities. For example, is there a case where one of the middle cages (Cage2, Cage3, Cage4) has neighbor counts of3 or7 in a different configuration?Wait, in the previous analysis, we assumed that if Cage1 has neighbor count3, then Cage2 would have neighbor count7 (since c=4). But let&#39;s check the equations again. Wait, in Case1, when Cage1 and Cage5 have neighbor counts of3, we found c=4, and all other variables dependent on b and d. The possible assignments for a, b, c, d, e are 3,1,4,3,1 or 2,2,4,2,2 or1,3,4,1,3. Then, we need to check if in these assignments, any other cages have neighbor counts outside of 3 or7. Wait, but in these cases, all cages have neighbor counts of3 or7. Let&#39;s verify:Take Case1a: a=3, b=1, c=4, d=3, e=1Cage1: (3-1)+1=2+1=3 ✔️  Cage2: (1-1)+3+4=0+7=7 ✔️  Cage3: (4-1)+1+3=3+4=7 ✔️  Cage4: (3-1)+4+1=2+5=7 ✔️  Cage5: (1-1)+3=0+3=3 ✔️  All neighbor counts are 3 or7. Good.Case1b: a=2, b=2, c=4, d=2, e=2Cage1: (2-1)+2=1+2=3 ✔️  Cage2: (2-1)+2+4=1+6=7 ✔️  Cage3: (4-1)+2+2=3+4=7 ✔️  Cage4: (2-1)+4+2=1+6=7 ✔️  Cage5: (2-1)+2=1+2=3 ✔️  All good.Case1c: a=1, b=3, c=4, d=1, e=3Cage1: (1-1)+3=0+3=3 ✔️  Cage2: (3-1)+1+4=2+5=7 ✔️  Cage3: (4-1)+3+1=3+4=7 ✔️  Cage4: (1-1)+4+3=0+7=7 ✔️  Cage5: (3-1)+1=2+1=3 ✔️  All good.Therefore, these are valid solutions. Are there any other solutions where some cages have neighbor counts of3 and others of7 in different combinations?Wait, perhaps if in some cages the neighbor count is3 and in others7, not necessarily all the same. But in our previous analysis, when we set Cage1 and Cage5 to 3, the rest ended up with7. But maybe there&#39;s a different combination where, say, Cage1 has7 and Cage2 has3, but that might lead to different values. Wait, let&#39;s check.Alternative approach: Let&#39;s not fix Cage1 and Cage5 first. Let&#39;s consider possibilities where different cages have different neighbor counts.Suppose Cage1 has a neighbor count of7. Then (a -1) + b =7 ⇒a + b=8.Similarly, Cage5 could have3 or7. Let&#39;s assume Cage5 has3, so d + e=4.Then, Cage2: (b -1) + a + c=3 or7. Since a + b=8, substitute a=8 -b into Cage2&#39;s equation:(b -1) + (8 - b) + c =7 + c=3 or7. So, 7 +c=3⇒c=-4 invalid; 7 +c=7⇒c=0 invalid. So no solution.Similarly, if Cage1 has7 and Cage5 has7:Cage1: a + b=8  Cage5: d + e=8  Cage2: (b -1) + a + c=7 +c=3 or7⇒c=0 or -4 invalid.  Cage4: (d -1) + c + e=7 +c=3 or7⇒c=0 or -4 invalid.  Thus, no solution.If Cage1 has7 and Cage5 has3:As before, no solution. So maybe only when Cage1 and Cage5 have neighbor counts of3 can we get valid solutions.Alternatively, let&#39;s suppose that Cage2 has neighbor count3. So:Cage2: (b -1) + a + c=3. But Cage2 must have either3 or7.If Cage2=3, then (b -1) + a + c=3. Let&#39;s see if this can be combined with other equations.But if Cage1 has neighbor count3, then a + b=4. Then Cage2: (b -1) + a + c=3 ⇒(b -1) + (4 -b) +c=3 ⇒3 +c=3⇒c=0. Invalid. Therefore, Cage2 cannot have neighbor count3 if Cage1 has neighbor count3.Alternatively, if Cage1 has neighbor count7 (a + b=8), then Cage2&#39;s equation would be (b -1) + (8 -b) +c=7 +c. If Cage2 has neighbor count3, then 7 +c=3⇒c=-4 invalid. If Cage2 has neighbor count7, then 7 +c=7⇒c=0 invalid. Thus, no solution.Thus, the only possible way to have valid solutions is when both Cage1 and Cage5 have neighbor counts of3, leading to c=4. All other configurations lead to contradictions. Therefore, the answer should be 4.But let me check one more time if there&#39;s another way. Suppose that the central cage has neighbor count3. Wait, Cage3: (c -1) + b + d=3. But from previous analysis, in Case1, Cage3 had neighbor counts of7. Let&#39;s see.If Cage3 has neighbor count3, then (c -1) + b + d=3. But in our earlier solution, (c -1) + b + d=7. But suppose we consider this.If we set Cage3&#39;s neighbor count=3, then (c -1) + b + d=3. But in that case, since all other cages must also have neighbor counts of3 or7, how would that affect the equations?But let&#39;s see. If Cage3&#39;s neighbor count=3, then b + c + d=4 (since (c-1) +b +d=3). Given that b and d are at least1, and c is at least1, the only possible values are if b=1, c=1, d=2 or similar. But then, how does that interact with the other equations?But maybe starting from here:Assume Cage3 has neighbor count3. So:(c -1) + b + d=3 ⇒b + c + d=4Since b, c, d ≥1, possible combinations are:b=1, c=1, d=2  b=1, c=2, d=1  b=2, c=1, d=1  But then, considering other equations:From Cage1: (a -1) + b=3 or7. If b=1, then (a -1) +1= a=3 or7 ⇒a=3 or7. But then Cage2: (b -1) + a + c. If b=1, a=3 or7, c=1 or2.But let&#39;s take b=1, c=1, d=2. Then, Cage2: (1 -1) + a +1=0 +a +1= a +1. This must be3 or7. So:If a +1=3 ⇒a=2  If a +1=7 ⇒a=6But from Cage1: (a -1) +1= a=3 or7. So:If a=3: (3 -1) +1=3, which is allowed. Then Cage2: a +1=3 +1=4, which is not 3 or7. Wait, no, wait:Wait, in this scenario, we set Cage3&#39;s neighbor count=3, leading to b=1, c=1, d=2. Then Cage1&#39;s neighbor count is (a -1) +1= a. This must be3 or7. So a=3 or7. If a=3, then Cage2&#39;s neighbor count is (1 -1) +3 +1=0 +4=4, which is invalid. If a=7, Cage1 neighbor count=7, and Cage2&#39;s neighbor count= (1 -1) +7 +1=0 +8=8, which is invalid. Therefore, no solution.Similarly, if b=1, c=2, d=1:Cage3: (2 -1) +1 +1=1 +2=3. Cage1: (a -1) +1= a=3 or7. So a=3 or7.Cage2: (1 -1) +a +2=0 +a +2= a +2. This must be3 or7.If a=3: 3 +2=5 invalid  If a=7:7 +2=9 invalid.No solution.If b=2, c=1, d=1:Cage3: (1 -1) +2 +1=0 +3=3. Cage1: (a -1) +2=3 or7 ⇒a -1=1 or5 ⇒a=2 or6.If a=2: Cage2 neighbor count=(2 -1) +2 +1=1 +3=4 invalid  If a=6: Cage2 neighbor count=(2 -1) +6 +1=1 +7=8 invalid.No solution.Therefore, if Cage3 has neighbor count3, no solutions. Hence, Cage3 must have neighbor count7, which was the case in our original solution.Thus, the only possible number of rabbits in the central cage is4. Therefore, the answer is4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Peter has 5 rabbit cages in a row, each containing at least one rabbit. Each rabbit has either 3 or 7 neighbors, where neighbors are defined as rabbits in the same cage or adjacent cages. We need to determine the number of rabbits in the central cage (Cage 3).Key steps:1. Define Variables: Let (a, b, c, d, e) be the number of rabbits in cages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. Each variable is at least 1.2. Neighbor Calculations:   - For each rabbit in Cage 1: ((a - 1) + b) must be 3 or 7.   - For each rabbit in Cage 2: ((b - 1) + a + c) must be 3 or 7.   - For each rabbit in Cage 3: ((c - 1) + b + d) must be 3 or 7.   - For each rabbit in Cage 4: ((d - 1) + c + e) must be 3 or 7.   - For each rabbit in Cage 5: ((e - 1) + d) must be 3 or 7.3. Equations Analysis:   - Cage 1 and Cage 5:     - If ((a - 1) + b = 3), then (a + b = 4).     - If ((e - 1) + d = 3), then (d + e = 4).   - Cage 2 and Cage 4:     - If ((b - 1) + a + c = 7) and ((d - 1) + c + e = 7), given (a + b = 4) and (d + e = 4), we find (c = 4).   - Cage 3:     - With (c = 4), ((c - 1) + b + d = 7) leads to (b + d = 4).4. Possible Values:   - From (a + b = 4) and (d + e = 4), possible pairs are ((a, b) = (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)) and ((d, e) = (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)).   - With (b + d = 4), valid combinations are ((b, d) = (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)).5. Verification:   - All combinations satisfy the neighbor conditions for each cage, confirming (c = 4).Thus, the number of rabbits in the central cage (Cage 3) is (boxed{4}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ddfc8c3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>🔑:</span>Answer: 4 rabbits.Solution. Let&#39;s number the cells from 1 to 5 from left to right.Notice that the neighbors of the rabbit in the first cell are all the rabbits living in the first two cells. The neighbors of the rabbit in the second cell are all the rabbits living in the first three cells. The third cell cannot be empty, so the rabbit in the second cell has more neighbors than the rabbit in the first cell. Therefore, the rabbit in the first cell has three neighbors, and the rabbit in the second cell has seven neighbors. The difference between the number of neighbors of the rabbit in the second cell and the number of neighbors of the rabbit in the first cell is equal to the number of rabbits in the central cell. Therefore, there are 7-3=4 rabbits in the central cell.Such an arrangement of rabbits exists. It is sufficient to place 2 rabbits in the first, second, fourth, and fifth cells, and 4 rabbits in the third cell.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-5aacd74b data-v-2ddfc8c3><div class="review" data-v-2ddfc8c3><div class="review-title" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>❓:</span>Which of the following statements are correct?A: In the linear regression equation, if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger, the linear correlation between the two variables is stronger.B: The 75th percentile of the data 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16 is 10.C: According to the paired sample data of categorical variables X and Y, the calculated chi ^{2}=3.937.

I need to be careful here because some might be tricky. Let&#39;s start with statement A.Statement A: &quot;In the linear regression equation, if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger, the linear correlation between the two variables is stronger.&quot;Hmm, the correlation coefficient r ranges from -1 to 1. The strength of the correlation is determined by the absolute value of r. So, whether r is positive or negative, a larger absolute value means a stronger correlation. However, the statement just says &quot;larger,&quot; which could be ambiguous. If r is larger in magnitude, then yes. But if they mean larger in the sense of more positive, then even if r is negative, a larger r (closer to 1) would mean stronger. Wait, actually, even if r is negative, like -0.8 is a stronger correlation than 0.5. But the statement says &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; so if you have two different r values, the one that is larger (closer to 1) has a stronger correlation. But actually, even if r is negative, moving towards 1 (i.e., becoming less negative) would technically be &quot;larger,&quot; but the strength is about the absolute value. Wait, maybe the confusion here is whether &quot;larger&quot; refers to absolute value or not. The way the statement is phrased is a bit ambiguous. But in statistical terms, the strength is based on the absolute value. So if r is 0.9 versus 0.5, 0.9 is stronger. If r is -0.9 versus 0.5, -0.9 is stronger. However, the way the statement is written: &quot;if r is larger, the correlation is stronger.&quot; If we take &quot;larger&quot; as a higher value (not considering sign), then a higher r (closer to 1) would be stronger. So, if r is increasing in absolute terms, then the correlation is stronger. But if r is positive and becomes more positive, or negative and becomes less negative, but still, the key is that the strength is determined by the absolute value.But the problem is that the statement doesn&#39;t mention absolute value. So, if you have an r of 0.8, which is larger than 0.5, then yes, stronger. If you have an r of -0.9, which is &quot;larger&quot; in magnitude but actually smaller in value. Wait, but r is -0.9, which is less than 0.5. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, r is a number between -1 and 1. So, -0.9 is a larger negative number, but in terms of magnitude, it&#39;s 0.9. So when they say &quot;r is larger,&quot; they probably mean in terms of the numerical value, not the magnitude. So, for example, if you have two correlations: 0.8 and 0.5, then 0.8 is larger and stronger. If you have -0.5 and -0.8, then -0.5 is larger than -0.8 (since -0.5 &gt; -0.8), but the magnitude of -0.8 is larger. Therefore, the statement is technically incorrect if they don&#39;t consider the absolute value. But in standard terminology, when people say &quot;correlation coefficient is larger,&quot; they might actually be referring to the strength, which is the absolute value. Wait, but no, in statistics, the sign matters for the direction. So if you have a larger positive r, it&#39;s a stronger positive correlation. A larger negative r (closer to -1) is a stronger negative correlation. So, if you&#39;re just talking about strength (regardless of direction), then it&#39;s the absolute value. But if the question is phrased as &quot;the linear correlation is stronger,&quot; then the strength is indeed based on absolute value. Therefore, if r is larger in absolute value, the correlation is stronger. However, the statement says &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; which could be interpreted as a higher value, not considering absolute. For example, if you have r = 0.7 vs. r = -0.8, then -0.8 is actually a stronger correlation, but since -0.8 is less than 0.7, the statement would be incorrect here. Therefore, the statement is incorrect because it doesn&#39;t specify absolute value. Wait, but maybe in Chinese education, they teach that the correlation coefficient&#39;s magnitude is what matters. Wait, the original problem is in Chinese, translated into English. Maybe the original statement is correct in the context. Let me think again.In linear regression, the correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship. The closer r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the correlation. So, a larger absolute value of r means a stronger correlation. However, the statement says &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; without mentioning absolute value. So if r is larger in the sense of more positive or less negative, but not necessarily higher in absolute value. For instance, if you have two coefficients: r = 0.5 and r = -0.9. Here, r = 0.5 is larger than r = -0.9, but the correlation is actually weaker (0.5 vs. 0.9). So in this case, the statement would be wrong. Therefore, the statement is incorrect because it doesn&#39;t take into account the absolute value. However, sometimes people might colloquially say &quot;larger correlation&quot; to mean stronger, implying absolute value. But in strict terms, the statement is not correct because r can be negative. So, statement A is not necessarily correct. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous, but I think in statistical terms, the correct interpretation is that the strength is determined by the absolute value, so if r is larger in absolute value, then the correlation is stronger. However, the wording here is &quot;if r is larger,&quot; which could be a translation issue. Maybe in the original Chinese, it&#39;s clearer. But given the translation, I think Statement A is incorrect because a larger r (not in absolute terms) does not necessarily mean a stronger correlation. For example, r = -0.9 is a stronger correlation than r = 0.8, but -0.9 is smaller than 0.8. Therefore, the answer depends on the interpretation. Wait, but in most textbooks, when they talk about the magnitude of r, they use absolute value. So maybe the correct answer is that Statement A is correct? Wait, if someone says &quot;the correlation coefficient is larger,&quot; without qualifying, do they mean in absolute value? Hmm. Let&#39;s check an example. Suppose we have r = 0.3 and r = 0.6, then 0.6 is larger and the correlation is stronger. If we have r = -0.3 and r = -0.6, then -0.6 is smaller (since it&#39;s more negative), but the correlation is stronger. So if someone says &quot;r is larger,&quot; in the case of negative numbers, it&#39;s ambiguous. But in the context of the question, since it&#39;s about the linear regression equation, and typically, the slope&#39;s sign is related to r&#39;s sign. But the strength is still about the absolute value. Therefore, if the question is translated as &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; then it&#39;s incorrect because it&#39;s not considering the absolute value. However, if the question in Chinese was using &quot;larger&quot; in terms of magnitude, then it&#39;s correct. But given the translation here, I think Statement A is incorrect. Wait, but I need to check standard definitions. According to any stats textbook, the correlation strength is based on absolute value, so the statement as written is incorrect because it doesn&#39;t specify absolute value. Therefore, Statement A is incorrect. Hmm, but maybe in some contexts, people just refer to the magnitude when they say &quot;larger.&quot; This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should check other statements first and come back to this.Statement B: &quot;The 75th percentile of the data 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16 is 10.&quot;Okay, let&#39;s compute the 75th percentile for this dataset. The data is already ordered: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16. There are 8 data points. To find the 75th percentile, we can use the formula: index = (n + 1) * p / 100, where n is the number of data points, p is the percentile. Or sometimes different methods. There are different methods to compute percentiles, which can give slightly different results.First, let&#39;s note that there are 8 data points. Using the nearest rank method, the position is given by (P/100)*N, where N is the number of observations. For 75th percentile, that&#39;s 0.75*8 = 6. So the 6th observation. But indexing starts at 1. So the 6th data point is 9. But that seems low. Alternatively, using another method, like the one used in Excel, which is R = 1 + (n - 1)*P/100. So R = 1 + (8 - 1)*0.75 = 1 + 5.25 = 6.25. Then, the percentile is the value at the 6th observation (9) plus 0.25*(11 - 9) = 9 + 0.5 = 9.5. So 9.5. Alternatively, some methods interpolate. Wait, different sources have different ways. Let&#39;s check.Another formula: the position is (n + 1) * p / 100. So for 75th percentile, that&#39;s (8 + 1)*0.75 = 6.75. So the 6.75th term. The 6th term is 9, the 7th term is 11. So 9 + 0.75*(11 - 9) = 9 + 1.5 = 10.5. Hmm. So depending on the method, it can be 9.5, 10.5, or 10. Wait, but the answer given in Statement B is 10. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, using the quartile method. The third quartile Q3 is the 75th percentile. For eight data points, Q3 is the median of the upper half. The median of the entire dataset is between the 4th and 5th terms: (5 + 7)/2 = 6. So lower half is 1, 3, 4, 5; upper half is 7, 9, 11, 16. The median of the upper half is between the 2nd and 3rd terms: (9 + 11)/2 = 10. Therefore, Q3 is 10. So according to this method, the 75th percentile is 10, which matches Statement B. Therefore, Statement B is correct.But different sources might compute it differently. For example, if the dataset is split into four equal parts. But with 8 data points, each quartile is 2 data points. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For quartiles, if n is even, the median is average of the middle two. Then, Q1 is the median of the first half, Q3 the median of the second half. So with 8 data points:First half (1, 3, 4, 5): median is (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5 (Q1)Second half (7, 9, 11, 16): median is (9 + 11)/2 = 10 (Q3). So yes, Q3 is 10. Therefore, using this method, the 75th percentile is 10. So Statement B is correct.But sometimes people use different methods, like linear interpolation. For example, in R, using the quantile function with type 7 (default) gives: quantile(c(1,3,4,5,7,9,11,16), 0.75) = 10.5. But type 6 gives 10. So depends on the method. However, in educational settings, especially exams, they often teach the method where Q3 is the median of the upper half. Therefore, the answer would be 10, so Statement B is correct.Statement C: &quot;According to the paired sample data of categorical variables X and Y, the calculated χ²=3.937. Based on the small probability value α=0.05 for the independence test (X₀.₀₅=3.841), it can be inferred that X and Y are related, and the probability of making an error in this inference is not greater than 0.05.&quot;Okay, chi-squared test for independence. The calculated chi-squared statistic is 3.937. The critical value at α=0.05 is 3.841. Since 3.937 &gt; 3.841, we reject the null hypothesis of independence. Therefore, we conclude that there is a significant association between X and Y. The statement says &quot;the probability of making an error in this inference is not greater than 0.05.&quot; But in hypothesis testing, α is the probability of Type I error, which is rejecting the null when it&#39;s true. So if we reject the null, the probability of making a Type I error is α, which is 0.05. Therefore, the statement is correct. However, there&#39;s a nuance here. The p-value is the probability of observing the data or something more extreme assuming the null is true. If the calculated χ² is 3.937 and the critical value is 3.841, that means the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, the probability of making an error (Type I) is indeed not greater than 0.05. So Statement C is correct.Statement D: &quot;A certain school has a total of 1500 male and female students. A sample of 100 people is selected using stratified sampling by gender. If there are 55 male students in the sample, then the number of female students in the school is 675.&quot;Stratified sampling means that the population is divided into strata (here, male and female), and samples are taken from each stratum proportionally. So if the school has M males and F females, with M + F = 1500. In stratified sampling, the number of males sampled would be (M / 1500) * 100, and similarly for females. If in the sample, there are 55 males, then the proportion of males in the sample is 55/100 = 0.55. Assuming that the stratified sampling is proportionate, this would imply that the proportion of males in the population is also 0.55. Therefore, the number of males in the school would be 0.55 * 1500 = 825, and the number of females would be 1500 - 825 = 675. Therefore, Statement D is correct.But wait, stratified sampling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean proportionate allocation. Stratified sampling can be done with equal numbers from each stratum or other allocations. However, the problem states &quot;stratified sampling by gender,&quot; which typically implies proportionate allocation unless specified otherwise. In exams, stratified sampling usually refers to proportionate unless stated. Therefore, assuming proportionate allocation, the number of females would be 675. Therefore, Statement D is correct.Wait, but let&#39;s think again. If they used stratified sampling, the sample is divided according to the strata. So, if in the school, the proportion of males is p, then in the sample of 100, the number of males should be 100*p. If we observe 55 males in the sample, then 55/100 = 0.55 is the sample proportion, which is used to estimate the population proportion. Therefore, the estimated number of males is 0.55*1500 = 825, hence females = 675. Therefore, Statement D is correct.But stratified sampling can sometimes refer to making sure that each stratum is represented, but if we don&#39;t know the actual proportion beforehand, how can we do stratified sampling? Usually, stratified sampling requires knowing the strata sizes in advance. Wait, yes, stratified sampling is when you divide the population into strata and then sample from each stratum. So in order to perform stratified sampling by gender, you need to know how many males and females there are in the population, then decide how many to sample from each stratum. For example, if you know there are M males and F females, you might sample 55 males and 45 females if that&#39;s your allocation. But wait, the problem states that they used stratified sampling by gender, but doesn&#39;t specify whether it&#39;s proportionate or not. However, the fact that the sample has 55 males and 45 females would then be used to estimate the total number of females. But actually, in stratified sampling, if you know the total population size and the proportion in each stratum, you can use the sample to make estimates. Wait, but if you use stratified sampling, you usually fix the number of samples from each stratum. For example, if you know that the population has 50% males and 50% females, you might sample 50 males and 50 females. But here, we are not told the population proportions. The question says they used stratified sampling by gender, selected a sample of 100, and in the sample, there are 55 males and 45 females. Then, to estimate the number of females in the school, you would assume that the proportion in the sample reflects the proportion in the population. Therefore, the estimated number of females is (45/100)*1500 = 675. But wait, in stratified sampling, if you do proportionate allocation, then the sample proportions match the population proportions. However, if you don&#39;t know the population proportions beforehand, you can&#39;t do proportionate allocation. Therefore, in practice, stratified sampling often requires prior knowledge of the strata sizes. If they didn&#39;t know the strata sizes, they couldn&#39;t have done proportionate stratified sampling. But the problem doesn&#39;t mention knowing the strata sizes beforehand. This is a bit confusing.Wait, perhaps the key here is that stratified sampling doesn&#39;t necessarily require proportionate allocation. It just means sampling from each stratum. For example, you could sample 50 males and 50 females regardless of the population proportions. But in that case, you would need to use weighted estimates. However, in this problem, since they have a sample of 55 males and 45 females, and they want to estimate the total number of females, the natural assumption is that the sampling was done proportionally. Therefore, the proportion in the sample reflects the proportion in the population. So, 55 males in a sample of 100 implies 55% males in the population, so 55% of 1500 is 825, females 675. Therefore, Statement D is correct. However, if the stratified sampling was done with equal allocation (50 males and 50 females), then the estimate would be different. But since the sample has 55 males, which is not equal, the likely assumption is proportionate allocation. Therefore, I think Statement D is correct.But wait, another perspective: stratified sampling requires that you divide the population into strata and then sample within each stratum. If gender is the stratum, then they would take a sample from the male stratum and a sample from the female stratum. The number sampled from each stratum can be decided in different ways: equal number, proportionate to population, or something else. However, unless specified, I think the default is proportionate allocation. However, without knowing the actual number of males and females in the population, you cannot perform proportionate allocation. So this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. How can you do proportionate stratified sampling without knowing the strata sizes?Therefore, perhaps in this problem, they actually did simple random sampling, but the question says stratified. But since they ended up with 55 males and 45 females, and the total is 1500, the school would have 55% males and 45% females. Therefore, 0.45*1500=675. So the answer is correct. Therefore, Statement D is correct.But this might be a common type of question where stratified sampling is mentioned, but the calculation is based on assuming the sample proportion reflects the population proportion, hence correct. Therefore, Statement D is correct.So summarizing:A: I was initially unsure, but upon reflection, the strength of correlation is based on the absolute value of r. So if r is larger in absolute value, the correlation is stronger. However, the statement says &quot;if r is larger,&quot; not &quot;if the absolute value of r is larger.&quot; Therefore, if you have two negative correlations, say r = -0.3 and r = -0.8, then -0.3 is larger than -0.8, but the correlation is weaker. So the statement is incorrect because it doesn&#39;t specify absolute value. Therefore, Statement A is incorrect.B: Correct, as per quartile calculation.C: Correct, because rejecting the null at α=0.05 means the probability of Type I error is ≤0.05.D: Correct, assuming proportionate stratified sampling.Wait, but according to the calculations above, A is incorrect, B is correct, C is correct, D is correct. So the correct statements are B, C, D. But let me double-check.Wait, on second thought, for Statement A, if r is larger (in absolute value), then the correlation is stronger. But the statement says &quot;if r is larger,&quot; without qualification. If you interpret &quot;larger&quot; as larger in absolute value, then A is correct. But if &quot;larger&quot; means just a higher value (so positive numbers increasing, negative numbers increasing towards zero), then A is not necessarily correct. So in Chinese, maybe the term used for &quot;larger&quot; implies magnitude. If that&#39;s the case, then A is correct. But given the translation here, it&#39;s ambiguous. In English, &quot;larger&quot; would typically mean a higher numerical value, not absolute. So, for example, -0.5 is larger than -0.8, but the correlation is weaker. Therefore, the statement is incorrect. So I think Statement A is incorrect.Therefore, the correct statements are B, C, D.But wait, let me check Statement C again. It says &quot;the probability of making an error in this inference is not greater than 0.05.&quot; The error here refers to Type I error, which is rejecting the null when it&#39;s true. The significance level α=0.05 is the probability of Type I error. So when we reject the null, the probability that we made an error (Type I) is indeed ≤0.05. Therefore, Statement C is correct.Thus, the correct answers are B, C, D.Final AnswerThe correct statements are boxed{BCD}.&lt;/think&gt;Statement A: The strength of the linear correlation is determined by the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ( r ). Since the statement does not mention absolute value, a larger ( r ) (in terms of numerical value) does not necessarily mean a stronger correlation. For example, ( r = -0.9 ) is stronger than ( r = 0.8 ), but ( -0.9 ) is smaller than ( 0.8 ). Therefore, Statement A is incorrect.Statement B: The 75th percentile (third quartile) of the data ( 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16 ) is calculated by finding the median of the upper half. The upper half is ( 7, 9, 11, 16 ), and the median of this subset is ( frac{9 + 11}{2} = 10 ). Therefore, Statement B is correct.Statement C: The calculated ( chi^2 = 3.937 ) is greater than the critical value ( 3.841 ) at ( alpha = 0.05 ). Rejecting the null hypothesis means the probability of a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis) is ( alpha = 0.05 ). Therefore, Statement C is correct.Statement D: Using stratified sampling by gender, the proportion of males in the sample (55 out of 100) is used to estimate the school&#39;s population. The estimated number of males is ( frac{55}{100} times 1500 = 825 ), leaving ( 1500 - 825 = 675 ) female students. Therefore, Statement D is correct.The correct statements are boxed{BCD}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to work through these multiple-choice questions one by one. I&#39;ll start with statement A.Statement A: In the linear regression equation, if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger, the linear correlation between the two variables is stronger.Hmm, linear regression and correlation coefficient. So the correlation coefficient r ranges from -1 to 1. The absolute value of r indicates the strength of the linear relationship, regardless of the sign. So if r is larger in absolute value, the correlation is stronger. But the statement says &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; which could be interpreted as just a larger value, not considering absolute value. For example, if r goes from 0.5 to 0.8, that&#39;s a stronger correlation. But if r is negative, say from -0.3 to -0.9, the correlation strength increases even though the value is &quot;larger&quot; in the negative direction. Wait, but in terms of magnitude, -0.9 is stronger than -0.3. So maybe the statement is correct because whether r is positive or negative, a larger absolute value means a stronger correlation. But the way it&#39;s phrased is &quot;r is larger,&quot; so if r is larger in magnitude, then yes. However, if someone interprets &quot;larger&quot; just in the positive direction, that might be a problem, but generally, when discussing strength, we talk about absolute values. So, I think statement A is correct. But wait, the question is in Chinese, but translated to English here. Maybe in the original Chinese, the wording is precise. Assuming that &quot;larger&quot; here refers to absolute value, then A is correct. Hmm, but actually, even if r is more negative (i.e., smaller in value), the correlation is stronger. Wait, no. If r is -0.8, that&#39;s a stronger correlation than 0.5. So the strength is based on absolute value. So regardless of sign, a larger |r| means stronger correlation. Therefore, if r is larger in absolute value, the statement is correct. However, the way the statement is phrased says &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; which could be ambiguous. If r is increasing from, say, 0.3 to 0.6, that&#39;s stronger. If it&#39;s increasing from -0.9 to -0.2, that&#39;s actually weaker. So the statement as written is not necessarily correct unless we consider absolute values. Wait, this is a problem. The statement says &quot;if r is larger,&quot; not &quot;if |r| is larger.&quot; Therefore, this could be a trick question. For example, if you have two negative correlations, where one is more negative (i.e., &quot;smaller&quot; in value but larger in magnitude), then the strength is stronger. So if r is larger (e.g., from -0.8 to -0.5), the correlation is actually weaker. Therefore, the statement A is incorrect because it&#39;s not the case that a larger r (regardless of sign) implies a stronger correlation. The strength depends on the absolute value. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. Wait, now I&#39;m confused. Let me verify.In linear regression, the correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship. The closer r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the correlation. So the strength is determined by the absolute value of r, not the sign. Therefore, if r is &quot;larger&quot; in the sense of moving towards 1 or -1, but if you just say &quot;larger&quot; without absolute value, then if you have a negative r that becomes more negative (i.e., moving from -0.5 to -0.9), the absolute value increases, so the strength increases. However, if you have a positive r that becomes more negative, say from 0.8 to -0.8, the absolute value is the same, but the sign changes. But the original statement is &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; so if r increases in value (i.e., becomes more positive), then yes, but if r is negative and becomes less negative, then the strength actually decreases. Therefore, the statement is ambiguous. However, in standard terminology, when we say &quot;the correlation coefficient is larger,&quot; we usually mean larger in magnitude (i.e., absolute value), but that might not be the case here. Wait, no. Typically, &quot;larger&quot; in terms of numerical value. For example, -0.9 is less than -0.5 because -0.9 is to the left of -0.5 on the number line. So if r increases from -0.9 to -0.5, it&#39;s technically &quot;larger,&quot; but the strength of the correlation is weaker. Therefore, the statement is incorrect. So statement A is incorrect. Wait, but maybe in the context of the problem, &quot;larger&quot; is meant in absolute terms. But the question is translated, so maybe the original Chinese was clearer. Hmm. This is a bit of a language issue. In most statistical contexts, when discussing the strength of correlation, we refer to the magnitude. So if r is 0.8, that&#39;s stronger than 0.5. Similarly, -0.8 is stronger than -0.5. But if someone says &quot;r is larger,&quot; does that mean larger in absolute value or larger in actual value? For example, is -0.5 larger than -0.8? In terms of numerical value, yes, -0.5 is larger than -0.8, but in terms of magnitude, 0.8 is larger. So this is ambiguous. The problem is whether the statement is correct. If the original statement in Chinese uses a term that translates to &quot;larger&quot; in absolute value, then A is correct. If it&#39;s just &quot;larger&quot; in numerical value, then A is not necessarily correct. Given that this is a test question, I think they probably mean the absolute value. Therefore, the statement is correct. Wait, but the answer is going to depend on interpretation. Hmm. Let me check another source.Wait, according to standard stats, the strength is determined by |r|. So if r is larger in absolute value, the correlation is stronger. But if the statement says &quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger,&quot; without specifying absolute value, then technically, if r is larger in the numerical sense, that could mean moving from, say, 0.3 to 0.6, which is stronger. But if you have a negative r that becomes more positive (i.e., closer to zero), then the strength decreases. Therefore, the statement is not universally true. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. For example, if r increases from -0.8 to -0.4, the strength of correlation decreases, even though r is &quot;larger.&quot; Therefore, the statement is incorrect. So A is incorrect.Statement B: The 75th percentile of the data 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16 is 10.Let me recall how to calculate percentiles. There are different methods, but one common method is:First, order the data, which it already is: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16.There are 8 data points. The position of the 75th percentile can be calculated as:Using the formula: P = (n + 1) * percentile / 100For 75th percentile: (8 + 1) * 75 / 100 = 9 * 0.75 = 6.75. So the 75th percentile is at the 6.75th position.Since the data is ordered, the 6th element is 9, the 7th is 11. The 6.75th position would be 75% of the way between the 6th and 7th values.So, 9 + 0.75*(11 - 9) = 9 + 1.5 = 10.5. Therefore, the 75th percentile is 10.5.Alternatively, another method might use the position as (n - 1) * percentile / 100 + 1. Let&#39;s see:(8 - 1) * 0.75 + 1 = 7 * 0.75 + 1 = 5.25 + 1 = 6.25. Then, the 6.25th position: 6th element is 9, 0.25*(11 - 9) = 0.5, so 9 + 0.5 = 9.5. Hmm, different result. Wait, this is the problem with percentile calculation—different methods give different results. So which method is standard?In some textbooks, the 75th percentile is the value such that 75% of the data is less than or equal to it. For 8 data points, 75% of 8 is 6. So the 6th value. But the 6th value is 9. However, other methods interpolate. This is confusing.Wait, let&#39;s check another approach. The quartiles: Q1 is 25th percentile, Q2 is 50th, Q3 is 75th.For 8 data points:Split the data into four parts. The positions for quartiles can be calculated as:Method 1: Using (n + 1) method.Q3 position: (8 + 1) * 0.75 = 6.75, so as before, interpolating between 6th and 7th: 9 and 11, resulting in 10.5.Method 2: Using exclusive median: Split the data into two halves, not including the median if odd. For even, the median is average of 4th and 5th: (5 + 7)/2 = 6. Then Q3 is the median of the upper half: upper half is 7, 9, 11, 16. The median of these is (9 + 11)/2 = 10. So Q3 is 10.So depending on the method, Q3 (75th percentile) can be 10 or 10.5. Therefore, the answer depends on the method used.The data is 1,3,4,5,7,9,11,16.Using the method where you split the data into halves:Lower half: 1,3,4,5Upper half: 7,9,11,16Then Q3 is the median of the upper half: (9 + 11)/2 = 10. So 10. So according to this method, the 75th percentile is 10. So statement B is correct.But using another method, it could be 10.5. However, different sources define quartiles differently. For example, Excel uses a different method. But in many textbooks, especially in educational settings, the method that splits the data into halves and takes the median of the upper half is standard. Therefore, statement B is correct.But I need to confirm. Let me check another approach. The data set has 8 numbers. To find the 75th percentile, which is the value where 75% of the data is below it. 75% of 8 is 6. So the 6th value is 9. But 9 is the 6th value, and 6/8 = 75%? Wait, 6/8 is 75%, so does that mean the 6th value is the 75th percentile? Wait, that&#39;s confusing.Wait, if you have 8 data points, the percentiles can be calculated as follows:The position is given by (P/100)*(n), where P is the percentile. For 75th percentile, that would be 0.75*8=6. So the 6th term. If it&#39;s an integer, then take the average of the 6th and 7th terms? Wait, no, some sources say that if it&#39;s an integer, you take the value at that position. Wait, this is conflicting.Wait, another formula: index = (P/100)*(n - 1) + 1For 75th percentile: 0.75*(8 - 1) + 1 = 0.75*7 + 1 = 5.25 + 1 = 6.25. So the 6.25th position, which is between 6th and 7th terms. So 9 + 0.25*(11 - 9)=9 + 0.5=9.5. Hmm, different result.This is frustrating. Different methods yield different results. So which one is correct? The problem is that different software and textbooks use different methods. Therefore, the answer may depend on the method taught in the course.Given that the data is 1,3,4,5,7,9,11,16, and the answer is 10, which is in between 9 and 11. If the 75th percentile is calculated as the median of the upper half, which is 10, then it&#39;s correct. Otherwise, if using linear interpolation, it might be 9.5 or 10.5.Wait, the R programming language, for example, has multiple methods for calculating quantiles. Let me check:In R, using the default method (type 7), the quantile is calculated as:position = 1 + (n - 1)*pSo for 75th percentile, p=0.75, n=8:position = 1 + 7*0.75 = 1 + 5.25 = 6.25. Then, the value is the 6th element + 0.25*(7th - 6th) = 9 + 0.25*(11 - 9)=9 + 0.5=9.5.Alternatively, type 6 in R corresponds to the Minitab and SPSS method, which is:position = (n + 1)*pFor 75th percentile: (8 + 1)*0.75=6.75. Then, the value is 6th element + 0.75*(7th - 6th)=9 + 0.75*(2)=10.5.Other types:Type 4 is similar to linear interpolation.But different methods. If the question is following the method where you take the upper half&#39;s median, then the answer is 10.However, in the data provided, the upper half after splitting at the median would be the last four numbers: 7,9,11,16. The median of these is (9 + 11)/2=10. Hence, Q3=10.Therefore, if the question is using that method, then the 75th percentile is 10, so statement B is correct.Alternatively, if using another method, it could be 9.5 or 10.5, but since the given answer is 10, which is one of the possible correct answers depending on the method, I think the answer expects that method. Therefore, statement B is correct.Statement C: According to the paired sample data of categorical variables X and Y, the calculated χ²=3.937. Based on the small probability value α=0.05 for the independence test (X_{0.05}=3.841), it can be inferred that X and Y are related, and the probability of making an error in this inference is not greater than 0.05.Okay, chi-square test for independence. The calculated chi-square statistic is 3.937. The critical value at α=0.05 is 3.841. Since 3.937 &gt; 3.841, we reject the null hypothesis of independence. Therefore, conclude that there is a significant association between X and Y. The probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null when it&#39;s true) is α=0.05. So the statement says &quot;the probability of making an error in this inference is not greater than 0.05.&quot; That would be correct because α is the maximum probability of Type I error. However, the wording is a bit tricky. The error rate is controlled at α=0.05, so the probability of making an error (Type I) is indeed not greater than 0.05. Therefore, statement C is correct.But wait, the chi-squared test requires that the test statistic is compared to the critical value. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value, we reject the null. The p-value here would be the probability of observing a chi-square statistic as extreme as 3.937 under the null. Since the critical value at 0.05 is 3.841, and our statistic is higher, the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, the conclusion is that X and Y are related, with a significance level α=0.05, and the probability of Type I error is ≤0.05. Therefore, statement C is correct.Statement D: A certain school has a total of 1500 male and female students. A sample of 100 people is selected using stratified sampling by gender. If there are 55 male students in the sample, then the number of female students in the school is 675.Stratified sampling means that the population is divided into strata (here, male and female), and samples are taken from each stratum proportionally. So if the school has N=1500 students, with M males and F females (M + F = 1500), then stratified sampling by gender would involve sampling from each gender group proportionally to their size in the population.If the sample of 100 has 55 males and 45 females, then the proportion of males in the sample is 55/100 = 0.55. Assuming that the stratified sample was done with proportional allocation, the proportion in the sample should reflect the proportion in the population. Therefore, the proportion of males in the population would be estimated as 0.55, so M = 0.55 * 1500 = 825, and F = 1500 - 825 = 675. Therefore, the number of female students is 675. So statement D is correct.Wait, but stratified sampling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean proportional allocation. Stratified sampling can also be done with equal allocation or other allocations. However, the question says &quot;stratified sampling by gender,&quot; which usually implies proportional allocation unless specified otherwise. Therefore, if the sample has 55 males, that would reflect the proportion in the population. Therefore, number of females is 675. Therefore, statement D is correct.But let me think again. In stratified sampling, you can have different sampling fractions. However, if it&#39;s stratified sampling without specifying, it&#39;s often assumed to be proportional. But actually, stratified sampling can also be disproportionate. However, the problem statement says &quot;stratified sampling by gender,&quot; but doesn&#39;t specify whether it&#39;s proportional. However, given that they are inferring the number of female students in the school based on the sample proportion, it implies that the stratified sample was done proportionally. Otherwise, if they sampled 55 males and 45 females regardless of the population proportion, you couldn&#39;t directly infer the population counts.Therefore, since they used stratified sampling by gender, and if the sample is proportional, then the proportion of males in the sample (55/100=55%) should match the proportion in the population. Therefore, total males would be 55% of 1500=825, so females=1500-825=675. Therefore, statement D is correct.Summary of Thoughts:- A: Incorrect. Because &quot;larger r&quot; without absolute value can be misleading. Strength is based on absolute value.Wait, but earlier I was conflicted. Wait, in statement A, does &quot;larger&quot; refer to the absolute value? If yes, then A is correct. But the wording is ambiguous. If someone interprets &quot;larger&quot; as a higher value (including sign), then if r is larger (e.g., from 0.3 to 0.6), the correlation is stronger. If r is negative and becomes more negative (i.e., &quot;smaller&quot; in value but larger in magnitude), then the correlation is stronger. So the statement is only correct if &quot;larger&quot; is in absolute terms. But as written, it&#39;s not. So the statement is technically incorrect.But in common statistical language, when people say &quot;the correlation is larger,&quot; they often mean in absolute value. However, strictly speaking, &quot;larger&quot; refers to numerical value. Therefore, the statement is ambiguous but likely incorrect. So A is incorrect.- B: Correct. Depending on the method, 75th percentile is 10.- C: Correct. Rejecting null hypothesis at α=0.05, Type I error probability ≤0.05.- D: Correct. Proportional stratified sampling implies population proportion is same as sample.But wait, wait. Wait, stratified sampling can have different sampling fractions. For example, you can stratify by gender and sample 50 males and 50 females even if the population is not 50-50. In that case, the sample proportions don&#39;t reflect the population. But the problem says &quot;stratified sampling by gender,&quot; which usually means that the sample size in each stratum is proportional to the population. However, actually, stratified sampling does not necessarily require proportional allocation. It can be any allocation. So unless specified, you can&#39;t assume proportional.Wait, this is a key point. The problem says &quot;stratified sampling by gender,&quot; but doesn&#39;t specify whether it&#39;s proportional. If the school has M males and F females, stratified sampling would involve sampling n_m males and n_f females, where n_m + n_f =100. However, how are n_m and n_f determined? If it&#39;s proportional stratified sampling, then n_m =100*(M/1500), n_f=100*(F/1500). But if it&#39;s not specified, stratified sampling could be any allocation. However, the problem states that the sample has 55 males and 45 females, and from that, they infer F=675. This inference would only be valid if the sampling was proportional. Therefore, the question assumes proportional stratified sampling. Since the problem says &quot;stratified sampling by gender,&quot; and given that they are making an inference based on the sample proportion, it&#39;s implied that the stratified sampling was proportional. Therefore, the answer D is correct.However, strictly speaking, stratified sampling doesn&#39;t have to be proportional. The problem should have specified that it&#39;s proportional stratified sampling. But in many cases, when people refer to stratified sampling without qualifiers, they mean proportional. So, given that context, statement D is correct.Rechecking Statement A:The user might have intended that &quot;larger&quot; refers to absolute value, but as per the strict reading, if r is larger in value (including sign), then it&#39;s not necessarily stronger. For example, r = 0.5 is weaker than r = -0.8, but -0.8 is smaller than 0.5. Therefore, the statement is incorrect. Thus, A is incorrect.Final Answer:Correct statements are B, C, D.Wait, but according to the initial analysis:- A: Incorrect- B: Correct- C: Correct- D: CorrectTherefore, the correct options are B, C, D.But let me verify once more.Rechecking Statement A:&quot;if the linear correlation coefficient r is larger, the linear correlation between the two variables is stronger.&quot;Suppose two scenarios:1. r = 0.9 vs r = 0.5: Here, r is larger, correlation is stronger. True.2. r = -0.9 vs r = -0.5: Here, r is &quot;larger&quot; in the sense of closer to +1? No, -0.5 is larger than -0.9. So if you have a correlation that becomes less negative (from -0.9 to -0.5), r is larger but the correlation strength is weaker.Therefore, the statement is not universally true. Hence, Statement A is incorrect.Statement B:75th percentile=10. As per the method where Q3 is the median of upper half (7,9,11,16), which is 10. Correct.Statement C:Chi-square test: reject null at α=0.05, hence conclude association. The probability of Type I error is α=0.05. Correct.Statement D:Proportional stratified sampling leads to 55 males in sample implies 55% of population is male. Hence, females=675. Correct.Therefore, correct answers are B, C, D.Final AnswerThe correct statements are boxed{BCD}.&lt;/think&gt;Statement A: In the linear regression equation, the strength of the linear correlation is determined by the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ( r ). Since the statement does not specify absolute value, a larger ( r ) in numerical value does not necessarily mean a stronger correlation (e.g., ( r = -0.9 ) is stronger than ( r = -0.5 ), but ( -0.5 ) is larger). Therefore, Statement A is incorrect.Statement B: The 75th percentile (Q3) of the data ( 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16 ) is calculated by taking the median of the upper half of the data. The upper half is ( 7, 9, 11, 16 ), and the median of these values is ( frac{9 + 11}{2} = 10 ). Therefore, Statement B is correct.Statement C: For the chi-square independence test with ( chi^2 = 3.937 ) and critical value ( 3.841 ) at ( alpha = 0.05 ), since ( 3.937 &gt; 3.841 ), we reject the null hypothesis. The probability of a Type I error is ( alpha = 0.05 ). Therefore, Statement C is correct.Statement D: Using stratified sampling by gender with a sample of 100 students (55 males and 45 females), the proportion of males in the sample (55%) reflects the population proportion. Thus, the number of female students in the school is ( 1500 times frac{45}{100} = 675 ). Therefore, Statement D is correct. Final AnswerThe correct statements are boxed{BCD}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ddfc8c3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>🔑:</span>Let&#39;s analyze each option step by step:Option A:- The statement suggests that a larger linear correlation coefficient r indicates a stronger linear correlation between two variables.- However, the strength of the linear correlation is actually determined by the absolute value of r.

Let me start with part (Ⅰ). The function is given as f(x) = ax² + (b - 2)x + 3, where a is not zero. The condition provided is that f(x + 1) - f(x) = 2x - 1. I need to find the explicit formula of f(x), which probably means finding the values of a and b first.Hmm, okay. Let&#39;s think about how to approach this. Since f(x) is a quadratic function, f(x + 1) would also be a quadratic. When we subtract f(x) from f(x + 1), the result is a linear function, which is 2x - 1 here. So maybe expanding f(x + 1) and then subtracting f(x) will give me equations to solve for a and b.Let me try that. Let&#39;s compute f(x + 1):f(x + 1) = a(x + 1)² + (b - 2)(x + 1) + 3Expanding that:First, (x + 1)² is x² + 2x + 1, so the first term becomes a(x² + 2x + 1) = ax² + 2ax + a.Then, the second term: (b - 2)(x + 1) = (b - 2)x + (b - 2)Adding the third term, which is 3. So putting it all together:f(x + 1) = ax² + 2ax + a + (b - 2)x + (b - 2) + 3Combine like terms:The x² term: ax²The x terms: 2ax + (b - 2)x = (2a + b - 2)xConstant terms: a + (b - 2) + 3 = a + b - 2 + 3 = a + b + 1So f(x + 1) = ax² + (2a + b - 2)x + (a + b + 1)Now subtract f(x) from this:f(x + 1) - f(x) = [ax² + (2a + b - 2)x + (a + b + 1)] - [ax² + (b - 2)x + 3]Let&#39;s subtract term by term:ax² - ax² = 0(2a + b - 2)x - (b - 2)x = [2a + b - 2 - b + 2]x = 2a xConstant terms: (a + b + 1) - 3 = a + b + 1 - 3 = a + b - 2Therefore, f(x + 1) - f(x) = 2a x + (a + b - 2)But according to the problem, this equals 2x - 1. So we can set up equations by equating coefficients:Coefficient of x: 2a = 2Constant term: a + b - 2 = -1Solving these equations.First, 2a = 2 =&gt; a = 1.Then, substitute a = 1 into the second equation:1 + b - 2 = -1 =&gt; (1 - 2) + b = -1 =&gt; -1 + b = -1 =&gt; b = 0So a = 1 and b = 0.Therefore, the function f(x) is:f(x) = 1x² + (0 - 2)x + 3 = x² - 2x + 3Wait, let me check that again. The original function is f(x) = ax² + (b - 2)x + 3. Since a = 1 and b = 0, then yes:(0 - 2)x = -2x. So f(x) = x² - 2x + 3.Let me verify if this works. Let&#39;s compute f(x + 1) - f(x).First, compute f(x) = x² - 2x + 3Then f(x + 1) = (x + 1)² - 2(x + 1) + 3 = x² + 2x + 1 - 2x - 2 + 3 = x² + (2x - 2x) + (1 - 2 + 3) = x² + 0x + 2 = x² + 2Subtracting f(x) from that: (x² + 2) - (x² - 2x + 3) = x² + 2 - x² + 2x - 3 = 2x - 1. Perfect, that&#39;s exactly the given condition. So part (Ⅰ) is solved. The explicit formula is x² - 2x + 3.Now part (Ⅱ): Let g(x) = f(x) - m x. If for any x₁, x₂ in [1, 2], |g(x₁) - g(x₂)| ≤ 2 holds, find the range of the real number m.Hmm, so we need to ensure that the maximum variation of g(x) over the interval [1, 2] is at most 2. That is, the maximum value minus the minimum value of g(x) on [1, 2] should be ≤ 2. Alternatively, since g(x) is a function, perhaps we can use the concept of Lipschitz continuity, but maybe it&#39;s simpler to consider the maximum and minimum values of g(x) on [1, 2].Alternatively, since the function is continuous (as it&#39;s a polynomial) and differentiable, the maximum difference |g(x₁) - g(x₂)| would be the difference between the maximum and minimum of g(x) on [1, 2]. So if we can find the maximum and minimum of g(x) on [1, 2], their difference must be ≤ 2. Therefore, we need to analyze the extrema of g(x) in [1, 2].First, let&#39;s write down g(x). Since f(x) is x² - 2x + 3, then:g(x) = f(x) - m x = x² - 2x + 3 - m x = x² - (2 + m)x + 3So g(x) is a quadratic function: x² - (2 + m)x + 3. Its graph is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of x² is 1 &gt; 0). The vertex of this parabola will be the minimum point.The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a) for quadratic ax² + bx + c. Here, a = 1, b = -(2 + m). Therefore, the vertex is at x = (2 + m)/(2*1) = (2 + m)/2.Now, we need to check if this vertex is inside the interval [1, 2]. If it is, then the minimum of g(x) on [1, 2] is at the vertex, and the maximum would be at one of the endpoints. If the vertex is outside the interval, then the extrema are at the endpoints.So let&#39;s find the location of the vertex (2 + m)/2. When is this in [1, 2]?We can write:1 ≤ (2 + m)/2 ≤ 2Multiply all parts by 2:2 ≤ 2 + m ≤ 4Subtract 2:0 ≤ m ≤ 2Therefore, when m is between 0 and 2, the vertex is inside [1, 2]. Otherwise, if m &lt; 0, then (2 + m)/2 &lt; (2 + 0)/2 = 1, so the vertex is to the left of the interval. If m &gt; 2, then (2 + m)/2 &gt; (2 + 2)/2 = 2, so the vertex is to the right of the interval.Therefore, we need to analyze three cases:1. m ≤ 0: vertex at x &lt; 1, so the minimum is at x = 1, and the maximum at x = 2.2. 0 ≤ m ≤ 2: vertex within [1, 2], so the minimum is at the vertex, and the maximum at either x = 1 or x = 2.3. m ≥ 2: vertex at x &gt; 2, so the minimum is at x = 2, and the maximum at x = 1.Wait, but since the parabola opens upwards, when the vertex is to the left of the interval, the function is increasing on the interval [1, 2], so the minimum is at x=1, maximum at x=2.Similarly, when the vertex is to the right, the function is decreasing on the interval [1, 2], so the maximum is at x=1 and the minimum at x=2.When the vertex is inside [1, 2], the function decreases from x=1 to the vertex, then increases from the vertex to x=2. Therefore, the maximum would be at one of the endpoints (either x=1 or x=2), and the minimum at the vertex.But in all cases, the maximum difference |g(x₁) - g(x₂)| would be the maximum value minus the minimum value. So we need:Max g(x) on [1, 2] - Min g(x) on [1, 2] ≤ 2.So let&#39;s compute these values for each case.First, compute g(1) and g(2):g(1) = (1)^2 - (2 + m)(1) + 3 = 1 - 2 - m + 3 = (1 - 2 + 3) - m = 2 - mg(2) = (2)^2 - (2 + m)(2) + 3 = 4 - 4 - 2m + 3 = (4 - 4 + 3) - 2m = 3 - 2mAlso, compute the value at the vertex when it&#39;s inside [1, 2], i.e., when 0 ≤ m ≤ 2:The vertex is at x = (2 + m)/2. Let&#39;s compute g at the vertex:g((2 + m)/2) = [(2 + m)/2]^2 - (2 + m)*[(2 + m)/2] + 3Let me compute this step by step.First, expand [(2 + m)/2]^2:= (4 + 4m + m²)/4Then subtract (2 + m)*[(2 + m)/2]:= (2 + m)(2 + m)/2 = (4 + 4m + m²)/2Therefore, the entire expression:= (4 + 4m + m²)/4 - (4 + 4m + m²)/2 + 3Convert to a common denominator:= (4 + 4m + m²)/4 - 2*(4 + 4m + m²)/4 + 3= [ (4 + 4m + m²) - 2*(4 + 4m + m²) ] /4 + 3= [ - (4 + 4m + m²) ] /4 + 3= - (4 + 4m + m²)/4 + 3= -1 - m - m²/4 + 3= ( -1 + 3 ) - m - (m²)/4= 2 - m - (m²)/4So the value at the vertex is 2 - m - (m²)/4.Therefore, for 0 ≤ m ≤ 2, the minimum of g(x) is 2 - m - (m²)/4, and the maximum is the maximum of g(1) and g(2). Let&#39;s see which is larger between g(1) and g(2):g(1) = 2 - mg(2) = 3 - 2mCompare 2 - m and 3 - 2m:2 - m vs. 3 - 2mSubtract the first from the second: (3 - 2m) - (2 - m) = 1 - mSo, if 1 - m &gt; 0, i.e., m &lt; 1, then g(2) &gt; g(1). If m = 1, they are equal. If m &gt; 1, g(1) &gt; g(2).Therefore, in the interval 0 ≤ m ≤ 2:- For 0 ≤ m &lt; 1, maximum is g(2) = 3 - 2m- For m = 1, both g(1) and g(2) are equal to 2 - 1 = 1 and 3 - 2*1 = 1- For 1 &lt; m ≤ 2, maximum is g(1) = 2 - mTherefore, the maximum value for 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 is:max{3 - 2m, 2 - m} depending on m.But in any case, the maximum is either 3 - 2m or 2 - m, and the minimum is 2 - m - m²/4.Therefore, the difference between maximum and minimum is:If 0 ≤ m &lt; 1: 3 - 2m - (2 - m - m²/4) = 3 - 2m - 2 + m + m²/4 = 1 - m + m²/4If 1 ≤ m ≤ 2: 2 - m - (2 - m - m²/4) = 2 - m - 2 + m + m²/4 = m²/4So, the difference (Max - Min) is:For 0 ≤ m &lt; 1: 1 - m + m²/4For 1 ≤ m ≤ 2: m²/4For m ≤ 0: Max - Min = g(2) - g(1) = (3 - 2m) - (2 - m) = 1 - mFor m ≥ 2: Max - Min = g(1) - g(2) = (2 - m) - (3 - 2m) = (2 - m - 3 + 2m) = (-1 + m)Therefore, summarizing:- If m ≤ 0: difference is 1 - m- If 0 ≤ m &lt; 1: difference is 1 - m + m²/4- If 1 ≤ m ≤ 2: difference is m²/4- If m ≥ 2: difference is m - 1We need all these differences to be ≤ 2. So, we need to find the range of m such that:For m ≤ 0: 1 - m ≤ 2 → -m ≤ 1 → m ≥ -1For 0 ≤ m &lt; 1: 1 - m + m²/4 ≤ 2For 1 ≤ m ≤ 2: m²/4 ≤ 2 → m² ≤ 8 → since m ≤ 2, this is always true because 2² = 4 ≤ 8For m ≥ 2: m - 1 ≤ 2 → m ≤ 3Therefore, combining these:From m ≤ 0: m ≥ -1 and m ≤ 0 → -1 ≤ m ≤ 0From 0 ≤ m &lt; 1: 1 - m + m²/4 ≤ 2Let&#39;s solve 1 - m + m²/4 ≤ 2:Subtract 2: -1 - m + m²/4 ≤ 0Multiply by 4: -4 - 4m + m² ≤ 0 → m² - 4m - 4 ≤ 0Solve m² - 4m - 4 ≤ 0Quadratic equation m² - 4m - 4 = 0Discriminant: 16 + 16 = 32Roots: [4 ± √32]/2 = [4 ± 4√2]/2 = 2 ± 2√2So the quadratic is ≤ 0 between the roots 2 - 2√2 and 2 + 2√2.But our interval here is 0 ≤ m &lt; 1.2 - 2√2 ≈ 2 - 2.828 ≈ -0.828, which is less than 0.2 + 2√2 ≈ 4.828, which is greater than 1.Therefore, the inequality m² - 4m - 4 ≤ 0 holds for m ∈ [2 - 2√2, 2 + 2√2]. But in our current interval of 0 ≤ m &lt;1, this is only true for m ≥ 2 - 2√2. But 2 - 2√2 ≈ -0.828, which is less than 0. So within 0 ≤ m &lt;1, the inequality m² -4m -4 ≤0 is always true? Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, when m is in 0 ≤ m &lt;1, let&#39;s check m = 0:At m =0: left-hand side of m² -4m -4 = 0 -0 -4 = -4 ≤0, which is true.At m =1: m² -4m -4 =1 -4 -4 = -7 ≤0, also true.Therefore, in the interval 0 ≤ m &lt;1, the quadratic m² -4m -4 is always ≤0. Therefore, the inequality 1 -m + m²/4 ≤2 holds for all m in 0 ≤m &lt;1.Therefore, for 0 ≤ m &lt;1, the condition holds.For 1 ≤ m ≤2: difference is m²/4 ≤2, which as we saw, m²/4 ≤2 → m² ≤8 → m ≤ 2√2 ≈2.828. But here m is up to 2, so since 2²/4 =4/4=1 ≤2, which is true. Therefore, all m in 1 ≤m ≤2 satisfy the condition.For m ≥2: difference is m -1 ≤2 → m ≤3.So combining all these:From m ≤0: -1 ≤m ≤0From 0 ≤m &lt;1: 0 ≤m &lt;1From 1 ≤m ≤2: 1 ≤m ≤2From m ≥2: 2 ≤m ≤3Therefore, the total range is -1 ≤m ≤3.But wait, hold on. Wait, for m ≤0, we had m ≥-1 and m ≤0, so that&#39;s -1 ≤m ≤0.For m ≥2, we have m ≤3, so 2 ≤m ≤3.Therefore, combining all these intervals: -1 ≤m ≤3.But let me verify this. Let&#39;s check for m = -1:g(x) = x² - (2 + (-1))x +3 =x² -x +3On interval [1,2], compute g(1)=1 -1 +3=3, g(2)=4 -2 +3=5. The difference is 5 -3=2 ≤2, so okay.For m=3:g(x)=x² - (2 +3)x +3 =x² -5x +3On [1,2], compute g(1)=1 -5 +3=-1, g(2)=4 -10 +3=-3. The maximum difference |-1 - (-3)|=2 ≤2. So okay.What about m=1.5 (which is in 1 ≤m ≤2):g(x)=x² -3.5x +3. The vertex is at (2 +1.5)/2=3.5/2=1.75, which is in [1,2]. The minimum at x=1.75 is 2 -1.5 - (1.5)^2/4=0.5 -2.25/4=0.5 -0.5625= -0.0625. The maximum is at x=1 or x=2. Compute g(1)=1 -3.5 +3=0.5; g(2)=4 -7 +3=0. So the maximum is 0.5, minimum is -0.0625. The difference is 0.5 - (-0.0625)=0.5625≈0.56, which is less than 2. So okay.Similarly, m=0:g(x)=x² -2x +3. This is the original f(x). The vertex is at (2 +0)/2=1, so at x=1. The minimum is g(1)=1 -2 +3=2. The maximum at x=2 is 4 -4 +3=3. Difference is 3 -2=1 ≤2. Good.m=3:As checked above, difference is 2.So overall, m must be in [-1, 3]. Therefore, the range of m is all real numbers from -1 to 3, inclusive.But let me check the edge cases again. For m=-1, difference is 2. For m=3, difference is 2. For m between -1 and 3, the differences are less than 2? Wait, no. Wait, for m=0.5 (in 0 ≤m &lt;1):g(x) =x² - (2 +0.5)x +3 =x² -2.5x +3The vertex is at (2 +0.5)/2=1.25. Compute g(1.25)= (1.25)^2 -2.5*1.25 +3=1.5625 -3.125 +3=1.5625 -3.125= -1.5625 +3=1.4375. Wait, wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, let me compute that again:g(1.25)= (1.25)^2 -2.5*(1.25) +3=1.5625 -3.125 +3= (1.5625 +3) -3.125=4.5625 -3.125=1.4375. So the minimum is 1.4375. The maximum is at x=2, which is 4 -5 +3=2. The difference is 2 -1.4375=0.5625, which is less than 2. So okay.Wait, but according to our previous calculation, for 0 ≤m &lt;1, the difference is 1 -m +m²/4. Let&#39;s check m=0.5:1 -0.5 + (0.5)^2 /4=0.5 +0.25/4=0.5 +0.0625=0.5625, which matches the actual difference. So the difference is 0.5625, which is ≤2. Therefore, all m in [-1,3] satisfy the condition that the maximum difference is ≤2.Hence, the range of m is from -1 to 3, inclusive. Therefore, the answer is m ∈ [-1, 3].But let me check for m=-0.5, which is in [-1,0]:g(x)=x² - (2 + (-0.5))x +3 =x² -1.5x +3Compute on [1,2]:g(1)=1 -1.5 +3=2.5g(2)=4 -3 +3=4Difference:4 -2.5=1.5 ≤2. Correct.For m=-1:As before, difference is 2. So included.For m=3:Difference is 2. Included.So yes, the range is m ∈ [-1, 3].Therefore, part (Ⅱ)&#39;s answer is that m is between -1 and 3, inclusive.Final AnswerⅠ. The explicit formula of ( f(x) ) is boxed{x^2 - 2x + 3};  Ⅱ. The range of the real number ( m ) is boxed{[-1, 3]}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the given problem, we start with part (Ⅰ):Given the function ( f(x) = ax^2 + (b-2)x + 3 ) and the condition ( f(x+1) - f(x) = 2x - 1 ), we need to find the values of ( a ) and ( b ).First, we compute ( f(x+1) ):[f(x+1) = a(x+1)^2 + (b-2)(x+1) + 3]Expanding and simplifying:[f(x+1) = ax^2 + 2ax + a + (b-2)x + (b-2) + 3 = ax^2 + (2a + b - 2)x + (a + b + 1)]Subtracting ( f(x) ) from ( f(x+1) ):[f(x+1) - f(x) = [ax^2 + (2a + b - 2)x + (a + b + 1)] - [ax^2 + (b - 2)x + 3] = 2ax + (a + b - 2)]Given this equals ( 2x - 1 ), we equate coefficients:[2a = 2 quad text{and} quad a + b - 2 = -1]Solving these, we get ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 0 ). Thus, the explicit formula for ( f(x) ) is:[f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3]For part (Ⅱ), we define ( g(x) = f(x) - mx = x^2 - (2 + m)x + 3 ). We need to ensure that for any ( x_1, x_2 in [1, 2] ), ( |g(x_1) - g(x_2)| leq 2 ).The function ( g(x) ) is a quadratic function with its vertex at ( x = frac{2 + m}{2} ). We analyze the maximum and minimum values of ( g(x) ) on the interval [1, 2] based on the position of the vertex:1. Vertex outside [1, 2]:   - For ( m leq 0 ), the vertex is left of 1, so the maximum difference is ( g(2) - g(1) = 1 - m ).   - For ( m geq 2 ), the vertex is right of 2, so the maximum difference is ( g(1) - g(2) = m - 1 ).2. Vertex inside [1, 2]:   - For ( 0 leq m leq 2 ), the minimum value is at the vertex and the maximum at the endpoints. The difference is computed and found to be within the required bound.After solving the inequalities for each case, we find the range of ( m ) that satisfies ( |g(x_1) - g(x_2)| leq 2 ):- For ( m leq 0 ), ( 1 - m leq 2 ) gives ( m geq -1 ).- For ( 0 leq m leq 2 ), the differences are within bounds.- For ( m geq 2 ), ( m - 1 leq 2 ) gives ( m leq 3 ).Combining these results, the range of ( m ) is:[boxed{[-1, 3]}] Final AnswerⅠ. The explicit formula of ( f(x) ) is boxed{x^2 - 2x + 3};  Ⅱ. The range of the real number ( m ) is boxed{[-1, 3]}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, there are two parts here: part (Ⅰ) asks for the explicit formula of f(x), and part (Ⅱ) is about finding the range of m such that the difference between g(x₁) and g(x₂) is at most 2 for any x₁, x₂ in [1,2]. Let&#39;s start with part (Ⅰ).The function given is f(x) = ax² + (b - 2)x + 3, where a is not zero. The condition provided is that f(x + 1) - f(x) = 2x - 1. I need to find a and b so that this condition holds, which will allow me to write the explicit formula for f(x).First, let&#39;s compute f(x + 1). If f(x) is ax² + (b - 2)x + 3, then replacing x with x + 1 gives:f(x + 1) = a(x + 1)² + (b - 2)(x + 1) + 3.Expanding that:First, expand (x + 1)²: x² + 2x + 1.Multiply by a: a(x² + 2x + 1) = ax² + 2ax + a.Next, expand (b - 2)(x + 1): (b - 2)x + (b - 2).So, adding all parts together:f(x + 1) = ax² + 2ax + a + (b - 2)x + (b - 2) + 3.Now, combine like terms:The x² term is ax².The x terms are 2ax + (b - 2)x = [2a + b - 2]x.The constants are a + (b - 2) + 3 = a + b + 1.So, f(x + 1) = ax² + [2a + b - 2]x + (a + b + 1).Now, subtract f(x) from this:f(x + 1) - f(x) = [ax² + (2a + b - 2)x + (a + b + 1)] - [ax² + (b - 2)x + 3].Let&#39;s subtract term by term:ax² - ax² = 0.The x terms: (2a + b - 2)x - (b - 2)x = [2a + b - 2 - b + 2]x = 2a x.The constants: (a + b + 1) - 3 = a + b - 2.Therefore, f(x + 1) - f(x) = 2a x + (a + b - 2).But the problem states that this difference is equal to 2x - 1. Therefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding terms.So:For the x term: 2a = 2. Therefore, a = 1.For the constant term: a + b - 2 = -1.Since we found a = 1, substitute that into the constant term equation:1 + b - 2 = -1 ⇒ (1 - 2) + b = -1 ⇒ -1 + b = -1 ⇒ b = 0.So, a = 1 and b = 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is:f(x) = 1x² + (0 - 2)x + 3 = x² - 2x + 3.Let me check if this works. Let&#39;s compute f(x + 1) - f(x) with these values.Compute f(x + 1):(x + 1)^2 - 2(x + 1) + 3 = x² + 2x + 1 - 2x - 2 + 3 = x² + (2x - 2x) + (1 - 2 + 3) = x² + 0x + 2 = x² + 2.Then f(x) is x² - 2x + 3. So f(x + 1) - f(x) = (x² + 2) - (x² - 2x + 3) = x² + 2 - x² + 2x - 3 = 2x -1. Which matches the given condition. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, part (Ⅰ) answer is f(x) = x² - 2x + 3.Now moving on to part (Ⅱ). Let&#39;s parse the problem again:Let g(x) = f(x) - m x. If for any x₁, x₂ ∈ [1, 2], |g(x₁) - g(x₂)| ≤ 2 holds, find the range of the real number m.So, we need to find all real numbers m such that the maximum difference between g(x) at any two points in [1, 2] is at most 2. Since g(x) is a function, the maximum difference over an interval is the maximum value minus the minimum value on that interval. So, if the maximum of g(x) on [1,2] minus the minimum of g(x) on [1,2] is ≤ 2, then the condition is satisfied.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the oscillation of g(x) on [1,2] must be ≤ 2. For continuous functions on a closed interval, the maximum and minimum are attained, so we can compute the difference between the maximum and minimum and set that ≤ 2.But first, let&#39;s write down g(x). Since f(x) = x² - 2x + 3, then:g(x) = f(x) - m x = x² - 2x + 3 - m x = x² - (2 + m)x + 3.So, g(x) is a quadratic function in x. Since the coefficient of x² is 1 (positive), it opens upwards, meaning its minimum is at the vertex, and the maximum on a closed interval will be at one of the endpoints.But depending on the value of m, the vertex could be inside the interval [1,2] or outside. Therefore, to find the maximum and minimum of g(x) on [1,2], we need to check the critical point (vertex) as well as the endpoints.Therefore, the strategy is:1. Find the derivative of g(x) to locate critical points (though for quadratics, we can just compute the vertex).2. Determine if the vertex is within [1,2].3. Evaluate g(x) at the endpoints (1 and 2) and at the vertex (if it&#39;s inside the interval).4. Compute the difference between the maximum and minimum of these values and set that ≤ 2.5. Solve for m.Alternatively, since g(x) is quadratic, the vertex is at x = -B/(2A) for a quadratic Ax² + Bx + C. Here, A = 1, B = -(2 + m). So vertex at x = (2 + m)/(2*1) = (2 + m)/2.Wait, wait. Wait, in general, quadratic is ax² + bx + c, vertex at x = -b/(2a). So here, the quadratic is x² - (2 + m)x + 3. So a = 1, b = -(2 + m). Therefore, vertex at x = -b/(2a) = (2 + m)/2.Yes, correct.So, the vertex is at x = (2 + m)/2. We need to check if this x is in the interval [1,2]. So, (2 + m)/2 must be between 1 and 2.So:1 ≤ (2 + m)/2 ≤ 2.Multiply all parts by 2:2 ≤ 2 + m ≤ 4.Subtract 2:0 ≤ m ≤ 2.Therefore, if m is between 0 and 2, the vertex is inside [1,2]. If m &lt; 0, the vertex is to the left of 1; if m &gt; 2, the vertex is to the right of 2.Therefore, the maximum and minimum of g(x) on [1,2] will be:Case 1: If m ∈ [0, 2], then the vertex is in [1,2], so the minimum is at the vertex, and the maximum is at one of the endpoints (since the parabola opens upwards).Case 2: If m &lt; 0, the vertex is at x &lt; 1, so on [1,2], the function is increasing (since the vertex is to the left, and the parabola opens upwards). Therefore, the minimum is at x = 1, and the maximum at x = 2.Case 3: If m &gt; 2, the vertex is at x &gt; 2, so on [1,2], the function is decreasing. Therefore, the minimum is at x = 2, and the maximum at x = 1.Therefore, in each case, compute the maximum and minimum, subtract them, set the difference ≤ 2, and solve for m.So let&#39;s formalize this.First, let&#39;s compute the value of g(x) at x = 1 and x = 2.Compute g(1):g(1) = 1² - (2 + m)*1 + 3 = 1 - 2 - m + 3 = (1 - 2 + 3) - m = 2 - m.Compute g(2):g(2) = 2² - (2 + m)*2 + 3 = 4 - 4 - 2m + 3 = (4 - 4 + 3) - 2m = 3 - 2m.Compute the value at the vertex x = (2 + m)/2:g((2 + m)/2) = [(2 + m)/2]^2 - (2 + m)*[(2 + m)/2] + 3.Let&#39;s compute this step by step.First term: [(2 + m)/2]^2 = (2 + m)^2 / 4.Second term: -(2 + m)*(2 + m)/2 = -(2 + m)^2 / 2.Third term: +3.Combine them:( (2 + m)^2 ) / 4 - ( (2 + m)^2 ) / 2 + 3= ( (2 + m)^2 ) / 4 - 2*(2 + m)^2 / 4 + 3= [ (1 - 2) * (2 + m)^2 ] / 4 + 3= [ - (2 + m)^2 ] / 4 + 3= 3 - (2 + m)^2 / 4.Therefore, the value at the vertex is 3 - (2 + m)^2 / 4.So now, depending on the cases:Case 1: m ∈ [0, 2]. Then the minimum is at the vertex: 3 - (2 + m)^2 / 4, and the maximum is at either x =1 or x=2. Let&#39;s compute both g(1) and g(2):g(1) = 2 - mg(2) = 3 - 2mSince the parabola opens upwards, the maximum will be the larger of g(1) and g(2). Let&#39;s compute which one is larger:Compare 2 - m and 3 - 2m.Find when 2 - m &gt; 3 - 2m:2 - m &gt; 3 - 2mAdd 2m to both sides:2 + m &gt; 3Subtract 2:m &gt; 1.Similarly, 2 - m &lt; 3 - 2m when m &lt; 1.At m =1, they are equal: 2 -1 =1, 3 -2*1=1.Therefore, for m ∈ [0,1), maximum is at x=2 (since 3 - 2m &gt; 2 - m), and for m ∈ (1,2], maximum is at x=1 (2 - m &gt; 3 - 2m). At m=1, both are equal.Therefore, in Case 1, the maximum is:- For m ∈ [0,1): 3 - 2m- For m ∈ [1,2]: 2 - mAnd the minimum is always at the vertex: 3 - (2 + m)^2 /4.Therefore, the difference between maximum and minimum is:For m ∈ [0,1):(3 - 2m) - [3 - (2 + m)^2 /4] = (3 - 2m) - 3 + (2 + m)^2 /4 = -2m + (2 + m)^2 /4.Set this ≤2:-2m + (2 + m)^2 /4 ≤ 2.Similarly, for m ∈ [1,2]:(2 - m) - [3 - (2 + m)^2 /4] = (2 - m) -3 + (2 + m)^2 /4 = (-1 - m) + (2 + m)^2 /4.Set this ≤2:(-1 - m) + (2 + m)^2 /4 ≤2.Additionally, in Cases 2 and 3, where the vertex is outside [1,2]:Case 2: m &lt;0. The function is increasing on [1,2], so minimum at x=1, maximum at x=2.Therefore, difference: g(2) - g(1) = (3 -2m) - (2 -m) = 3 -2m -2 +m =1 -m.Set this ≤2:1 -m ≤2 ⇒ -m ≤1 ⇒ m ≥ -1.But in this case, m &lt;0. Therefore, combining with m &lt;0, the range is m ∈ [-1,0).Case 3: m &gt;2. The function is decreasing on [1,2], so maximum at x=1, minimum at x=2.Difference: g(1) - g(2) = (2 -m) - (3 -2m) = 2 -m -3 +2m = (-1) +m.Set this ≤2:-1 +m ≤2 ⇒ m ≤3.But in this case, m &gt;2. Therefore, combining with m &gt;2, the range is m ∈ (2,3].So, in summary:From Case 2: m ∈ [-1,0).From Case 3: m ∈ (2,3].From Case 1: m ∈ [0,2], but need to check the difference for m in [0,1) and [1,2].So let&#39;s handle Case 1.First, for m ∈ [0,1):Compute the difference:-2m + (2 + m)^2 /4 ≤2.Let&#39;s compute (2 + m)^2 /4 -2m ≤2.First, expand (2 + m)^2: 4 +4m +m².Divide by 4: (4 +4m +m²)/4 =1 +m +m²/4.So the left-hand side (LHS) becomes:1 +m +m²/4 -2m =1 -m +m²/4.Set this ≤2:1 -m + (m²)/4 ≤2 ⇒ (m²)/4 -m +1 ≤2 ⇒ (m²)/4 -m -1 ≤0.Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominator:m² -4m -4 ≤0.Solve the quadratic inequality m² -4m -4 ≤0.Find roots of m² -4m -4 =0.Using quadratic formula: m = [4 ± sqrt(16 +16)]/2 = [4 ± sqrt(32)]/2 = [4 ± 4√2]/2 = 2 ± 2√2.So, approximately, sqrt(2) ≈1.414, so 2√2≈2.828. Hence, roots at 2 +2.828 ≈4.828 and 2 -2.828≈-0.828.But we are considering m ∈ [0,1). So, in this interval [0,1), the quadratic m² -4m -4 is:At m=0: 0 -0 -4= -4 ≤0.At m=1: 1 -4 -4= -7 ≤0.Since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of m² is positive), it is ≤0 between its roots. But since the roots are approximately at m≈-0.828 and m≈4.828, and our interval is m ∈ [0,1), which is between -0.828 and 4.828, so the inequality m² -4m -4 ≤0 holds for all m in [0,1). Therefore, the difference is ≤2 for m ∈ [0,1).Now, for m ∈ [1,2]:The difference is (-1 -m) + (2 + m)^2 /4 ≤2.Let me compute (2 + m)^2 /4 - (1 +m) ≤2.First, expand (2 +m)^2 =4 +4m +m².Divide by 4:1 +m +m²/4.So, LHS is 1 +m +m²/4 -1 -m = m²/4.So, m²/4 ≤2 ⇒ m² ≤8 ⇒ |m| ≤2√2 ≈2.828.But in this case, m ∈ [1,2]. Since 2 &lt;2.828, the inequality m²/4 ≤2 holds for all m ∈ [1,2]. Therefore, the difference is m²/4, which is at most 4/4=1 when m=2, so 1 ≤2. Therefore, the condition holds for all m ∈ [1,2].Therefore, combining all cases:From Case 2: m ∈ [-1,0).From Case 1: m ∈ [0,2].From Case 3: m ∈ (2,3].Therefore, the total range is m ∈ [-1,3].But wait, need to check if in all these ranges the difference is ≤2.Wait, in Case 1, when m ∈ [0,1), we had the difference expression:1 -m +m²/4 ≤2, which we transformed to m² -4m -4 ≤0, which holds for all m between the roots, but in our interval m ∈ [0,1), even though the roots are at ≈-0.828 and ≈4.828, so yes, for all m in [0,1), the difference is ≤2.Similarly, in m ∈ [1,2], the difference is m²/4, which is at most 1 (when m=2), so that&#39;s okay.In Case 2: m ∈ [-1,0), the difference is 1 -m. Since m is in [-1,0), 1 -m is in (1,2]. Wait, when m approaches -1, 1 - (-1)=2. When m approaches 0 from the left, 1 -0=1. So, the difference is between 1 and 2. But the condition is that the difference is ≤2. Therefore, in this case, the maximum difference is 2 when m=-1, and as m increases towards 0, the difference decreases to 1. So, for m ∈ [-1,0), the difference is ≤2.Similarly, in Case 3: m ∈ (2,3], the difference is m -1. Since m is in (2,3], m -1 is in (1,2]. When m approaches 2 from the right, the difference is 1, and when m=3, the difference is 2. Therefore, the difference is ≤2 here as well.Therefore, combining all three cases, m ∈ [-1,3].But wait, the problem says &quot;for any x₁, x₂ ∈ [1, 2], |g(x₁) - g(x₂)| ≤ 2&quot;. Therefore, the maximum difference on the interval [1,2] must be ≤2. So, according to our analysis, the range of m is [-1,3].But let me verify with specific values.For example, take m = -1. Let&#39;s check the difference in Case 2.g(x) =x² - (2 + (-1))x +3 =x² -x +3. On [1,2], since m=-1 &lt;0, the function is increasing. Therefore, g(1)=1 -1 +3=3, g(2)=4 -2 +3=5. The difference is 5 -3=2. Which is exactly 2. So, satisfies the condition.Take m=3. In Case 3, g(x)=x² - (2 +3)x +3 =x² -5x +3. On [1,2], since m=3&gt;2, the function is decreasing. Therefore, g(1)=1 -5 +3=-1, g(2)=4 -10 +3=-3. The difference is |-1 - (-3)|= |-1 +3|=2. Which is also exactly 2. So satisfies the condition.For m=0, which is in Case 1: g(x)=x² -2x +3. The vertex is at x=(2 +0)/2=1, which is at the left endpoint. Then, on [1,2], since vertex is at x=1, which is the minimum. The maximum is at x=2. So, g(1)=1 -2 +3=2, g(2)=4 -4 +3=3. The difference is 1, which is ≤2.For m=2, in Case 1, vertex at (2 +2)/2=2, which is the right endpoint. So on [1,2], the minimum is at x=2, maximum at x=1. Compute g(1)=2 -2=0, g(2)=3 -4= -1. The difference is |0 - (-1)|=1 ≤2.For m=1.5, in Case 1, vertex at (2 +1.5)/2=1.75, which is inside [1,2]. Compute the maximum and minimum. The minimum is at the vertex, let&#39;s compute g(1.75):g(1.75)=1.75² - (2 +1.5)*1.75 +3=3.0625 -3.5*1.75 +3. Let&#39;s compute:3.5*1.75=6.125So, 3.0625 -6.125 +3= (3.0625 +3) -6.125=6.0625 -6.125= -0.0625.Then, compute g(1) and g(2):g(1)=2 -1.5=0.5.g(2)=3 -3=0.So, maximum is 0.5, minimum is -0.0625. Difference is approximately 0.5625 ≤2. Which holds.Therefore, the conclusion is that m must be in [-1,3].But let me check if m= -1 and m=3 are included. Since in Case 2, m approaches -1 from the right (but m ∈ [-1,0)), and when m=-1, the difference is exactly 2, which is allowed. Similarly, when m=3, the difference is exactly 2. So, endpoints included.Therefore, the range is m ∈ [-1,3].So, the answer for part (Ⅱ) is that m is between -1 and 3, inclusive.Final AnswerⅠ. boxed{f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3}  Ⅱ. boxed{[-1, 3]}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = ax^2 + (b-2)x + 3 ) (( a neq 0 )) which satisfies ( f(x+1) - f(x) = 2x - 1 ): Part (Ⅰ)1.

Ensure the difference between maximum and minimum values is ≤ 2:   - For ( m in [0, 2] ), the difference is found to be ≤ 2.   - For ( m &lt; 0 ), the difference ( 1 - m leq 2 ) gives ( m geq -1 ).   - For ( m &gt; 2 ), the difference ( m - 1 leq 2 ) gives ( m leq 3 ).Combining these results, the range of ( m ) is ([-1, 3]). Final AnswersⅠ. boxed{f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3}  Ⅱ. boxed{[-1, 3]}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ddfc8c3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ddfc8c3><span class="icon" data-v-2ddfc8c3>🔑:</span>Solution:  (Ⅰ) Since f(x) = ax^2 + (b-2)x + 3 (a neq 0) and it satisfies f(x+1) - f(x) = 2x - 1,  we have a(x+1)^2 + (b-2)(x+1) + 3 - ax^2 - (b-2)x - 3 = 2x - 1,  which simplifies to 2ax + a + b - 2 = 2x - 1,  therefore, 2a = 2 and a + b - 2 = -1,  solving these, we get a = 1, b = 0,  thus, f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3.(Ⅱ) Since for any x_1, x_2 in [1, 2], |g(x_1) - g(x_2)| leq 2 holds,  we have g(x)_{max} - g(x)_{min} leq 2,  since g(x) = f(x) - mx = x^2 - (m+2)x + 3,  the axis of symmetry is x = frac{m+2}{2},  ① When frac{m+2}{2} leq 1, i.e., m leq 0, the function g(x) is monotonically increasing on [1, 2],  thus, f(x)_{max} = f(2) = 3 - 2m, f(x)_{min} = f(1) = 2 - m,  so, 3 - 2m - (2 - m) leq 2,  solving this, we get -1 leq m leq 0,  ② When frac{m+2}{2} geq 2, i.e., m geq 2, the function g(x) is monotonically decreasing on [1, 2],  thus, f(x)_{min} = f(2) = 3 - 2m, f(x)_{max} = f(1) = 2 - m,  so, 2 - m - (3 - 2m) leq 2,  solving this, we get 2 leq m leq 3,  ③ When 1 &lt; frac{m+2}{2} &lt; frac{3}{2}, i.e., 0 &lt; m &lt; 1, the function f(x) is decreasing on [1, frac{m+2}{2}) and increasing on (frac{m+2}{2}, 2],  thus, f(x)_{min} = f(frac{m+2}{2}) = 3 - frac{1}{4}(m+2)^2, f(x)_{max} = f(2) = 3 - 2m,  so, 3 - 2m - [3 - frac{1}{4}(m+2)^2] leq 2,  solving this, we get 2 - 2sqrt{2} leq m leq 2 + 2sqrt{2},  in this case, 0 &lt; m &lt; 1,  ④ When frac{3}{2} leq frac{m+2}{2} &lt; 2, i.e., 1 leq m &lt; 2, the function f(x) is decreasing on [1, frac{m+2}{2}) and increasing on (frac{m+2}{2}, 2],  thus, f(x)_{min} = f(frac{m+2}{2}) = 3 - frac{1}{4}(m+2)^2, f(x)_{max} = f(1) = 2 - m,  so, 2 - m - [3 - frac{1}{4}(m+2)^2] leq 2,  solving this, we get -2sqrt{2} leq m leq 2sqrt{2},  in this case, 1 leq m &lt; 2,  Summarizing the above, the range of m is boxed{[-1, 3]}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-5aacd74b><span data-v-5aacd74b>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
