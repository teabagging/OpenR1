data-v-ca8eb55e>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find an expression for the sequence ( a_n ) where ( a_1 = 1 ) and each subsequent term is defined by the relation ( frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{a_n} + 1 ). Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding what this recursive formula means. First, the initial term is given as ( a_1 = 1 ). Then, for each natural number ( n ), the reciprocal of the next term ( a_{n+1} ) is equal to the reciprocal of the current term ( a_n ) plus 1. So, if I write out the first few terms, maybe I can see a pattern.Starting with ( a_1 = 1 ). Then, for ( n = 1 ):( frac{1}{a_2} = frac{1}{a_1} + 1 = frac{1}{1} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ). So, ( a_2 = frac{1}{2} ).Next, ( n = 2 ):( frac{1}{a_3} = frac{1}{a_2} + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ), so ( a_3 = frac{1}{3} ).For ( n = 3 ):( frac{1}{a_4} = frac{1}{a_3} + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 ), so ( a_4 = frac{1}{4} ).Wait a minute, so ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_2 = 1/2 ), ( a_3 = 1/3 ), ( a_4 = 1/4 )... Is this sequence just ( a_n = frac{1}{n} )? Let me check the recursion to see if that holds.Assume ( a_n = frac{1}{n} ). Then, according to the given relation:( frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{a_n} + 1 Rightarrow frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = n + 1 Rightarrow a_{n+1} = frac{1}{n + 1} ). Yes, that works! If ( a_n = 1/n ), then substituting into the recursion gives ( a_{n+1} = 1/(n + 1) ), which is exactly the next term in the sequence. Therefore, by induction, this formula should hold for all natural numbers ( n ).But wait, let me verify this step-by-step to make sure I didn&#39;t jump to a conclusion. Let&#39;s use mathematical induction properly.Base case: For ( n = 1 ), ( a_1 = 1/1 = 1 ), which matches the given initial condition.Inductive step: Assume that for some ( k geq 1 ), ( a_k = 1/k ). Then, using the recursive formula:( frac{1}{a_{k+1}} = frac{1}{a_k} + 1 = k + 1 ). Therefore, ( a_{k+1} = 1/(k + 1) ).Thus, by induction, the formula ( a_n = 1/n ) holds for all ( n in mathbb{N}^* ).Wait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me check with ( n = 4 ). According to the formula, ( a_4 = 1/4 ), which matches the earlier calculation. Similarly, ( a_5 = 1/5 ), and so on. So, it does seem like the general term is ( a_n = 1/n ).But let me think again. The recursion is given in terms of reciprocals. The reciprocal of ( a_{n+1} ) is the reciprocal of ( a_n ) plus 1. So, if I let ( b_n = 1/a_n ), then the recursion becomes ( b_{n+1} = b_n + 1 ), which is a simple arithmetic sequence with common difference 1. Given that ( b_1 = 1/a_1 = 1 ), then ( b_n = 1 + (n - 1) times 1 = n ). Therefore, ( a_n = 1/b_n = 1/n ).Ah, that&#39;s another way to see it. By defining ( b_n ) as the reciprocal of ( a_n ), the recursion simplifies to an arithmetic progression with first term 1 and common difference 1. So, ( b_n ) is just ( n ), hence ( a_n = 1/n ). Yes, that method is more systematic. Let me reiterate:Given ( frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{a_n} + 1 ), let ( b_n = frac{1}{a_n} ). Then the recurrence becomes ( b_{n+1} = b_n + 1 ). With ( b_1 = frac{1}{a_1} = 1 ), this is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 1. Therefore, ( b_n = b_1 + (n - 1) times 1 = 1 + n - 1 = n ). Hence, ( a_n = frac{1}{b_n} = frac{1}{n} ).So, both methods confirm that the general term is ( a_n = frac{1}{n} ). The problem seems solved, but let me check if there are any possible mistakes in my reasoning.One thing to consider is whether the recursion is properly defined for all ( n ). Since each ( a_n = 1/n ), none of the terms are zero, so taking reciprocals is valid. The sequence is well-defined.Alternatively, if the problem had started with a different initial term, the approach would still work. For example, if ( a_1 ) was something else, we would still use the same substitution ( b_n = 1/a_n ), leading to an arithmetic sequence. But in this case, since ( a_1 = 1 ), the arithmetic sequence starts at 1, leading directly to ( b_n = n ).Therefore, I think the conclusion is solid. The expression for ( a_n ) is ( frac{1}{n} ).Final AnswerThe expression for ( a_n ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{n}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the sequence ( {a_n} ) where ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{a_n} + 1 ) for ( n in mathbb{N}^* ), we need to find the expression for ( a_n ).First, we observe the recursive relation. By defining ( b_n = frac{1}{a_n} ), the given recurrence relation transforms into a simpler form:[b_{n+1} = b_n + 1]This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( b_1 = frac{1}{a_1} = 1 ) and common difference 1. The general term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:[b_n = b_1 + (n - 1) times 1 = 1 + (n - 1) = n]Thus, ( b_n = n ). Converting back to ( a_n ) using ( a_n = frac{1}{b_n} ), we get:[a_n = frac{1}{n}]Verification by induction confirms this result:- Base case: For ( n = 1 ), ( a_1 = 1 ), which matches the given initial condition.- Inductive step: Assume ( a_k = frac{1}{k} ) for some ( k geq 1 ). Then,  [  frac{1}{a_{k+1}} = frac{1}{a_k} + 1 = k + 1 implies a_{k+1} = frac{1}{k + 1}  ]  Hence, by induction, ( a_n = frac{1}{n} ) holds for all ( n in mathbb{N}^* ).Therefore, the expression for ( a_n ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{n}}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this sequence problem here. Let me read it again. The sequence is defined by a₁ = 1, and then for each natural number n, the reciprocal of a_{n+1} is equal to the reciprocal of a_n plus 1. I need to find an expression for a_n. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down.First, the starting term is given: a₁ = 1. Then, the recursive formula is 1/a_{n+1} = 1/a_n + 1. So each term&#39;s reciprocal is just the previous term&#39;s reciprocal plus 1. That seems like an arithmetic sequence in the reciprocals. Wait, maybe I can rephrase this.Let me denote b_n = 1/a_n. Then the recursive formula becomes b_{n+1} = b_n + 1. And the initial term is b₁ = 1/a₁ = 1/1 = 1. So now, this is just an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 1. So the common difference is 1, starting from 1. Therefore, the general term for b_n would be b_n = b₁ + (n - 1)*d, where d is the common difference.Plugging in the values, b_n = 1 + (n - 1)*1 = 1 + n - 1 = n. So, b_n = n. But since b_n is 1/a_n, that means 1/a_n = n, so a_n = 1/n. Wait, is that right? Let&#39;s check.If a₁ = 1, then a₂ would be 1/(1/a₁ + 1) = 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. Similarly, a₃ = 1/(1/a₂ + 1) = 1/(2 + 1) = 1/3. Continuing this pattern, a₄ = 1/(3 + 1) = 1/4. So it seems like each term is 1/n. So yes, that seems to hold. So the expression for a_n is 1/n.But wait, let me verify this more carefully. Let&#39;s use mathematical induction to be sure.Base case: n = 1. a₁ = 1, which is equal to 1/1. So that checks out.Inductive step: Assume that for some k ≥ 1, a_k = 1/k. Then, according to the recursive formula, 1/a_{k+1} = 1/a_k + 1 = k + 1. Therefore, a_{k+1} = 1/(k + 1). Which is exactly the formula when n = k + 1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.Therefore, the expression for a_n is 1/n. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Did I miss something here? Let me check the initial terms again.a₁ = 1.a₂: 1/a₂ = 1/a₁ + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ⇒ a₂ = 1/2.a₃: 1/a₃ = 1/a₂ + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ⇒ a₃ = 1/3.a₄: 1/a₄ = 3 + 1 = 4 ⇒ a₄ = 1/4.Yep, that pattern continues. So each term is just the reciprocal of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the general term is a_n = 1/n.Alternatively, thinking of the sequence {b_n} where b_n = 1/a_n, which is an arithmetic sequence starting at 1 with a common difference of 1. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by b_n = b₁ + (n - 1)d. Substituting, b_n = 1 + (n - 1)(1) = n. Therefore, a_n = 1/b_n = 1/n.I think that&#39;s solid. The key step was recognizing that taking reciprocals turns the recursive relation into a simple arithmetic sequence. Once you see that, the rest is straightforward. So the answer should be a_n = 1/n.Final AnswerThe expression for (a_n) is boxed{dfrac{1}{n}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the sequence ({a_n}) where (a_1 = 1) and (frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{a_n} + 1) for (n in mathbb{N}^*), we need to find the expression for (a_n).First, we define a new sequence (b_n = frac{1}{a_n}). This transforms the given recursive relation into:[b_{n+1} = b_n + 1]with the initial term (b_1 = frac{1}{a_1} = 1). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term (b_1 = 1) and common difference (1).The general term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:[b_n = b_1 + (n - 1)d]Substituting the values, we get:[b_n = 1 + (n - 1) cdot 1 = n]Since (b_n = frac{1}{a_n}), it follows that:[a_n = frac{1}{b_n} = frac{1}{n}]Verification using mathematical induction confirms the result. The base case (a_1 = 1) holds, and assuming (a_k = frac{1}{k}), we find (a_{k+1} = frac{1}{k+1}), completing the inductive step.Thus, the expression for (a_n) is boxed{dfrac{1}{n}}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ca8eb55e></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>🔑:</span>Given the recursive formula frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{a_n} + 1 for n in mathbb{N}^*, we can subtract frac{1}{a_n} from both sides to getfrac{1}{a_{n+1}} - frac{1}{a_n} = 1, quad n in mathbb{N}^*.Because a_1 = 1, we have frac{1}{a_1} = 1.

So, the function f(x) is defined on the interval [-4, 4] and is an odd function. That means f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in [-4, 4]. Then, we have another function g(x) = a f(x) + b. We need to check which of the statements (A) through (D) is correct.First, let me recall what an odd function is. An odd function is symmetric about the origin. So, if we rotate the graph 180 degrees around the origin, it looks the same. Examples include f(x) = x, f(x) = x^3, etc. Since f(x) is odd, we can use that property when analyzing g(x).Now, let&#39;s go through each option one by one.Option (A): If a &lt; 0, then the graph of the function g(x) is symmetric with respect to the origin.Hmm. Let&#39;s think. Since f(x) is odd, then a f(x) is also odd because multiplying by a scalar (even a negative one) preserves the oddness. Because if you replace x with -x, a f(-x) = a (-f(x)) = -a f(x), which is the negative of a f(x), so it&#39;s still odd. Then adding b to it. But adding a constant term would affect the symmetry. For a function to be odd, it needs to satisfy g(-x) = -g(x). Let&#39;s check:g(-x) = a f(-x) + b = a (-f(x)) + b = -a f(x) + bBut -g(x) = - (a f(x) + b) = -a f(x) - bSo unless b = 0, g(-x) ≠ -g(x). Therefore, even if a &lt; 0, unless b = 0, g(x) is not odd. The statement says &quot;if a &lt; 0&quot;, but doesn&#39;t mention anything about b. So even if a is negative, as long as b ≠ 0, the function g(x) isn&#39;t odd. Since the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify that b is zero, just that g(x) = a f(x) + b. So unless b is zero, which isn&#39;t stated here, (A) is false. Therefore, (A) is incorrect.Option (B): If a = -1, -2 &lt; b &lt; 0, then the equation g(x) = 0 has a real root less than 2.So here, a is -1, and b is between -2 and 0. So g(x) = -f(x) + b = 0 ⇒ f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0, so we need to solve f(x) = b. But f(x) is an odd function on [-4, 4]. Let me think about the possible range of f(x).Since f(x) is odd, it must pass through the origin: f(0) = 0. Also, since it&#39;s defined on [-4, 4], the maximum and minimum values depend on the specific function. But we don&#39;t have the exact form of f(x). Wait, but maybe we can use properties of odd functions. For example, if f(x) is odd, then its maximum on [0, 4] is M, then its minimum on [-4, 0] is -M. However, unless given more information about f(x), like continuity or differentiability, it&#39;s hard to be precise. But the problem is presented in a multiple-choice format, so perhaps we can assume f(x) is continuous? Because otherwise, odd functions can have jumps, but in typical calculus problems, unless stated otherwise, functions are continuous.Assuming f(x) is continuous, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, since it&#39;s odd, f(0) = 0, and suppose on [0, 4], f(x) reaches some maximum value and some minimum. If we set g(x) = 0, which is equivalent to f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0, we can think of this as finding x such that f(x) = b. Since f is continuous and odd, if b is in the range of f(x), then there must be some x in [-4, 4] where f(x) = b. However, the question is whether there&#39;s a real root less than 2.Wait, but without knowing the exact behavior of f(x), how can we know where the root is? Maybe we need to use the fact that since f(x) is odd and continuous, and assuming it&#39;s strictly increasing or something? But maybe the answer depends on the fact that b is between -2 and 0. If b is negative, then f(x) = b would require x to be negative (since f is odd, f(-x) = -f(x)). But if x is negative, then the root would be in [-4, 0). However, the question says &quot;a real root less than 2&quot;. Hmm, but negative numbers are less than 2, so maybe all roots are less than 2? Wait, but maybe f(x) could be positive or negative in different intervals.Alternatively, perhaps the original function f(x) has roots only at 0? Since it&#39;s odd, but unless specified, we can&#39;t know. Wait, but f(x) is odd, so f(0) = 0. But if f(x) is zero only at x=0, then solving f(x) = b (which is non-zero) would have solutions elsewhere.Alternatively, maybe the function f(x) crosses the value b somewhere. Let&#39;s think in terms of possible values. If a = -1, then g(x) = -f(x) + b. Setting this to zero gives f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0. If we can assume that f(x) takes all values between -M and M on [-4, 4], where M is the maximum value. If b is within that range, then there exists some x where f(x) = b. However, the question is about having a root less than 2.But how does the value of x relate to being less than 2? Maybe if f(x) = b, and since b is negative, then x would be in the left half of the interval [-4, 4], i.e., x &lt; 0, which is certainly less than 2. But maybe the function f(x) could also attain negative values in the interval [0, 4]? Wait, no. Since f is odd, if x is positive, f(x) = -f(-x). So if x is positive, f(x) is the negative of f(-x). Therefore, if x is positive, f(x) has the opposite sign of f(-x). Therefore, if x &gt; 0, f(x) can be positive or negative depending on the behavior. Wait, but if f is odd, the function could be increasing or decreasing. For example, f(x) = x is odd and increasing, so f(x) is positive when x is positive, negative when x is negative. But if f(x) is a more complex odd function, maybe it has multiple oscillations. For example, f(x) = sin(x) is odd, and on the interval [-4, 4], it would cross zero multiple times. But the problem states that f is defined on [-4, 4], but we don&#39;t know its exact form.However, given that it&#39;s an odd function, and continuous (assuming continuity), then for any b between -2 and 0, there exists some x in (-4, 0) such that f(x) = b, because f(-4) would be -f(4). If we assume that f(4) is some positive number, then f(-4) = -f(4) is negative. Then, if b is between -2 and 0, and assuming that f(x) attains values from -f(4) up to f(4) on the interval [-4, 4]. But if b is between -2 and 0, and the function f(x) ranges from, say, -M to M, where M is greater than 2, then there would be a solution. But wait, without knowing what f(4) is, how do we know?Wait, maybe the problem is designed such that regardless of the specific f(x), as long as it&#39;s odd, then some properties hold. For example, since f is odd and defined on [-4, 4], and we are to consider g(x) = -f(x) + b with a = -1 and b between -2 and 0. Then solving -f(x) + b = 0 implies f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0, and f is odd, then if f(x) can take values down to -M (where M is the maximum absolute value). If M is at least 2, then there exists x such that f(x) = b. But if M is less than 2, then maybe not. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t give us information about the range of f(x). Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Wait, perhaps the key here is that since the function is defined on [-4,4], and it&#39;s an odd function. If f(x) is continuous (which we probably have to assume), then the Intermediate Value Theorem applies. So, since f(0) = 0, and if, for example, f(4) is some positive value (let&#39;s call it M), then f(-4) = -M. So as x goes from -4 to 4, f(x) goes from -M to M. If we take b between -2 and 0, then to solve f(x) = b, which is a negative value. Therefore, x must be in [-4, 0). Similarly, since f is continuous, there must be some x in (-4, 0) where f(x) = b. But the question is whether the root is less than 2. Well, all x in [-4, 0) are less than 2, so yes, any root in that interval is less than 2. Therefore, the equation g(x)=0 has a real root less than 2. Therefore, (B) is correct? Hmm, but wait, unless there are multiple roots. Wait, but even if there are multiple roots, the existence of at least one root less than 2 is guaranteed. So (B) should be correct.But wait, maybe the problem is designed with a trick. Suppose that f(x) is such that f(x) = b only at x &gt;= 2. But since f is odd, if f(x) = b at x = c, then f(-c) = -b. But since b is negative, -b is positive, so if f(x) = b at some positive x, then f(-x) = -b. However, since we are solving f(x) = b where b is negative, that would require x to be negative. Therefore, x would be in [-4, 0), so definitely less than 2. Therefore, regardless of the function, if f(x) is continuous and odd, then f(x) = b (with b negative) would have a solution in [-4, 0), which is less than 0, hence less than 2. Therefore, the equation g(x) = 0 has a real root less than 2. Therefore, (B) is correct. So option (B) is correct.Option (C): If a ≠ 0, b = 2, then the equation g(x) = 0 has two real roots.So, here, g(x) = a f(x) + 2 = 0 ⇒ f(x) = -2/a. Since a ≠ 0, this is equivalent to solving f(x) = c, where c = -2/a. Now, since f is an odd function defined on [-4,4], and if it&#39;s continuous, then depending on the value of c, the equation f(x) = c may have one or more solutions. However, since f is odd, if c is in the range of f, then there is at least one solution in [-4, 4]. But whether there are two real roots depends on the function f(x). For example, if f(x) is strictly increasing, then f(x) = c would have exactly one solution. If f(x) is not monotonic, maybe it has multiple solutions. But since we don&#39;t know the specific form of f(x), can we be sure that there are two real roots?Wait, but if a ≠ 0, then c = -2/a can be any real number except zero (since if a approaches infinity, c approaches zero). But if c is non-zero, then because f is odd, if c is in the range of f, then there exists at least one x such that f(x) = c. But since f is odd, if x is a solution, then -x is a solution to f(x) = -c. But here, we need f(x) = c. So unless c is zero, which it&#39;s not (since a ≠ 0 and b = 2), then f(x) = c will have solutions, but how many?If f is bijective (strictly monotonic), then only one solution. If f has turning points, maybe more. But since we don&#39;t know, we can&#39;t guarantee two real roots. For example, if f(x) is x^3, which is odd, then f(x) = c has exactly one real root for any c. Therefore, in that case, g(x) = a x^3 + 2 = 0 would have one real root. So (C) would be false. Alternatively, if f(x) is sin(x), which is odd, then sin(x) = c can have two solutions in [-4, 4], but depending on c. For example, if c = 1, sin(x) = 1 has one solution at π/2 (~1.57), which is within [-4,4], but sin(x) = 0.5 would have two solutions in [-4,4]. However, if c is greater than 1 or less than -1, there would be no solutions.But in our case, c = -2/a. If a is, say, 1, then c = -2. So f(x) = -2. If f(x) ranges between -M and M, and if M &gt;= 2, then there&#39;s a solution. But if M &lt; 2, then no solution. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the range of f(x). Therefore, we can&#39;t be certain that f(x) = -2/a has solutions. Moreover, even if there are solutions, the number of roots isn&#39;t necessarily two. It could be one, two, or more, depending on f(x). Therefore, without additional information about f(x), we can&#39;t confirm that there are exactly two real roots. Hence, statement (C) is not necessarily correct.Option (D): If a ≥ 1, b &lt; 0, then the equation g(x) = 0 has three real roots.Again, let&#39;s analyze this. Here, g(x) = a f(x) + b = 0 ⇒ f(x) = -b/a. Since a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, then -b/a is positive (because b is negative, so -b is positive, divided by a positive a). So we need to solve f(x) = positive constant. Let&#39;s denote c = -b/a &gt; 0. Now, similar to before, since f is an odd function, if c is within the range of f(x), then there exists some x in (0, 4] where f(x) = c. However, how many roots does this equation have?If f(x) is strictly increasing, then only one root in (0, 4]. Similarly, since f is odd, there would be a corresponding root in [-4, 0) for f(x) = -c, but here we are looking for f(x) = c &gt; 0, so only in the positive side. However, unless the function crosses the value c multiple times. For example, if f(x) is a sine function, it could cross c multiple times. But again, without knowing the specific form of f(x), we can&#39;t be certain. However, the problem states &quot;has three real roots&quot;. How could that happen?Wait, if f(x) is zero at x=0, and suppose that f(x) crosses the x-axis only at 0. Then, solving f(x) = c (positive) would have one solution in (0, 4], and solving f(x) = c would have only that one solution. Then, how would g(x)=0 have three real roots?Alternatively, maybe if f(x) has a maximum at some point and then decreases, it might cross the value c twice on the positive side and once on the negative? Wait, no. Because f(x) is odd, so f(x) = c &gt; 0 would have solutions in (0, 4], and f(x) = -c &lt; 0 would have solutions in [-4, 0). But here, we are solving f(x) = c &gt; 0, which only relates to positive x. Unless the function f(x) crosses c multiple times on (0,4]. If it does, then there would be multiple roots. But again, without knowing the behavior of f(x), we can&#39;t say for sure.Wait, but maybe if a is large enough, scaling up f(x) could make the equation g(x)=0 cross more times. Wait, no. Because g(x) = a f(x) + b. If a increases, the function a f(x) is vertically scaled. If b &lt; 0, then g(x) = a f(x) + b is a scaled version shifted down by |b|. But if a is large, the scaling might make the function have more crossings? Hmm, not necessarily. If f(x) is, say, x, then a f(x) + b = a x + b. Setting to zero gives x = -b/a. Since a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, then -b/a is positive, so x is in (0, 4] if -b/a ≤ 4. But even if a is large, there&#39;s only one root. Therefore, in this case, there&#39;s only one real root. Therefore, for f(x) = x, (D) would be false.Alternatively, if f(x) is a cubic function, like f(x) = x^3, then g(x) = a x^3 + b = 0 ⇒ x^3 = -b/a. Since b &lt; 0 and a ≥ 1, -b/a is positive. Therefore, x = (-b/a)^{1/3}, which is a single real root. So again, only one real root.But maybe if f(x) is a more complicated odd function that has multiple humps. For example, suppose f(x) is an odd function that has a local maximum at x=2, then decreases back to zero at x=4. Then, solving f(x) = c might have two solutions in (0,4]. Then, with the root at x=0 (but f(0)=0, which is not equal to c &gt; 0). Wait, no. If c &gt; 0, then roots are only in (0,4]. If f(x) goes up to a maximum at x=2, then comes back down, then f(x)=c could have two solutions in (0,4]. Then, in that case, there are two real roots. Adding the root at x=0? But f(0)=0 ≠ c. So only two roots. Therefore, even in that case, only two real roots. To have three real roots, there must be three separate x-values where f(x) = c. But since c &gt; 0, and f is odd, if there are three roots, two in positive side and one in negative? No, because f(x) = c &gt; 0 only occurs where x is positive. Unless f(x) is such that it crosses c three times on the positive side. That would require a very oscillatory function. But given the interval is only up to 4, maybe hard to have three crossings. But without specific information about f(x), we can&#39;t guarantee three roots. Since the problem is general for any odd function f(x), statement (D) cannot be always true. For example, if f(x) is linear, then only one root exists. Therefore, (D) is incorrect.Therefore, among the options, only (B) is correct.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) ) defined on the interval ([-4, 4]) and being an odd function, we analyze the statements about ( g(x) = a f(x) + b ).Option (A): If ( a &lt; 0 ), then the graph of ( g(x) ) is symmetric with respect to the origin.  - An odd function multiplied by a scalar remains odd, but adding a constant ( b ) breaks the symmetry unless ( b = 0 ). Since ( b ) is not specified to be zero, this statement is false.Option (B): If ( a = -1 ), ( -2 &lt; b &lt; 0 ), then the equation ( g(x) = 0 ) has a real root less than 2.  - Solving ( -f(x) + b = 0 ) gives ( f(x) = b ). Since ( b ) is negative and ( f(x) ) is odd and continuous, there exists an ( x ) in ([-4, 0)) such that ( f(x) = b ). All such ( x ) are less than 2, so this statement is true.Option (C): If ( a neq 0 ), ( b = 2 ), then the equation ( g(x) = 0 ) has two real roots.  - Solving ( a f(x) + 2 = 0 ) gives ( f(x) = -2/a ). Without knowing the specific form of ( f(x) ), we cannot guarantee two roots. For example, ( f(x) = x ) would have only one root. This statement is false.Option (D): If ( a geq 1 ), ( b &lt; 0 ), then the equation ( g(x) = 0 ) has three real roots.  - Solving ( a f(x) + b = 0 ) gives ( f(x) = -b/a ). For linear ( f(x) ), there is only one root. Even with more complex ( f(x) ), we cannot guarantee three roots without specific information. This statement is false.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an odd function f(x) defined on the interval [-4, 4]. Then, there&#39;s another function g(x) = a f(x) + b. We need to check which of the statements (A) through (D) is correct.First, let&#39;s recall what an odd function is. An odd function satisfies the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. This means the graph is symmetric about the origin. So, for example, if (2, 3) is on the graph, then (-2, -3) must also be on the graph.Now, let&#39;s look at each option one by one.Option A: If a &lt; 0, then the graph of the function g(x) is symmetric with respect to the origin.Hmm. Since f(x) is odd, let&#39;s see what happens with g(x). Let&#39;s check if g(-x) = -g(x) for symmetry about the origin.g(-x) = a f(-x) + b = a (-f(x)) + b = -a f(x) + b.But -g(x) = -a f(x) - b.So, unless b = 0, g(-x) ≠ -g(x). The problem says g(x) = a f(x) + b. If b ≠ 0, even if a &lt; 0, the function g(x) won&#39;t be odd because of the constant term b. Therefore, the symmetry about the origin (i.e., being odd) requires both that f(x) is odd and that the linear combination doesn&#39;t have a constant term unless it&#39;s zero. Since b is added here, unless b = 0, g(x) isn&#39;t necessarily odd. The problem doesn&#39;t state that b is zero, only that a &lt; 0. So unless b is zero, this symmetry doesn&#39;t hold. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify that b = 0; it just defines g(x) = a f(x) + b. Therefore, statement A is only true if b = 0, which isn&#39;t given here. So A is incorrect. So I can eliminate option A.Option B: If a = -1, -2 &lt; b &lt; 0, then the equation g(x) = 0 has a real root less than 2.Alright, let&#39;s parse this. So g(x) = -f(x) + b, where -2 &lt; b &lt; 0. We need to see if g(x) = 0 has a real root less than 2.So solving for f(x): -f(x) + b = 0 ⇒ f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0, f(x) = b. So we need to see if there&#39;s an x in [-4, 4] such that f(x) = b. Now, since f(x) is odd, it passes through the origin (because f(0) = -f(0) implies f(0) = 0). Also, being odd and defined on [-4,4], the function might have a certain range. But since we don&#39;t have the exact graph, maybe we need to deduce based on properties.But wait, the original function f(x) is odd. Suppose the maximum and minimum values of f(x). For an odd function, the maximum value on [0,4] would correspond to the negative of that on [-4,0]. But without knowing the exact behavior, maybe we can think in terms of possible values.However, the problem says &quot;the equation g(x) = 0 has a real root less than 2&quot;. So we need to see if there&#39;s an x &lt; 2 such that f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0. Let&#39;s think: since f is odd, then in the negative side (x &lt; 0), f(x) is the negative of f(-x). So if we can have f(x) = b, which is negative. So if x is negative, then f(x) is negative. So x would be in [-4, 0), which is certainly less than 2. Wait, but maybe also on the positive side? Suppose f(x) can take positive and negative values. Wait, since f is odd, if x is positive, f(x) can be positive or negative depending on the function. Wait, no. Wait, if x is positive, then f(x) is the negative of f(-x), but since we don&#39;t know the specific behavior. Wait, actually, for odd functions, the behavior on the positive side determines the negative side. For example, if on the positive side f(x) is increasing, then on the negative side it&#39;s decreasing.But perhaps if we consider that since f is odd, and defined on [-4,4], then if f(x) can take any value from, say, -M to M, where M is the maximum value of |f(x)| on [0,4]. But since we don&#39;t have the figure, maybe we need to make assumptions. Wait, but the question is part of a test problem, so maybe it&#39;s implied that f(x) has a range that includes values down to -2 and up to 2, given the options here. But maybe not necessarily. Hmm.Wait, if a = -1, and b is between -2 and 0, then g(x) = -f(x) + b = 0 implies f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0, then f(x) must equal b. Since f is odd, and f(0) = 0. So let&#39;s suppose that f(x) is continuous (the problem mentions a graph, so probably continuous). Then, since f is odd, and assuming it&#39;s continuous, it must pass through the origin. If b is between -2 and 0, then f(x) = b is a horizontal line intersecting the graph of f(x) somewhere. Since f is odd, if it&#39;s continuous, then on the interval [-4, 4], f(x) will take every value between -max and max. But unless we know the maximum value of f(x), we can&#39;t be sure. Wait, but in the options, the values given for b are between -2 and 0, so maybe the maximum value of f(x) is at least 2? But since the function is defined on [-4,4], maybe not. Hmm.Wait, but if the equation f(x) = b has a solution for b in (-2, 0), then the equation g(x)=0 has a root. But the question is whether this root is less than 2. If f(x) is defined on [-4,4], then x can be from -4 to 4. If b is negative, then f(x) = b would have solutions in the left half of the graph (x negative), but since x is negative, those roots are less than 2. Also, maybe on the positive side, if f(x) can take negative values. Wait, but since f is odd, if x is positive, f(x) is the negative of f(-x). So if f(x) is positive for x positive, then f(-x) = -f(x) would be negative. Wait, no. Wait, if x is positive, f(x) could be positive or negative? Wait, no, for an odd function, if you know the behavior on the positive side, the negative side is determined. For example, if x is positive and f(x) is positive there, then for x negative, f(x) = -f(-x) which would be negative. So in that case, if f(x) is positive for x positive, then f(x) is negative for x negative. Hence, if we have f(x) = b where b is negative, the solutions would be on the negative side (x &lt; 0), which are certainly less than 2. Therefore, the equation f(x) = b would have roots at x &lt; 0, hence less than 2. Therefore, option B is correct? But the answer choices are given as options, so perhaps B is correct. Hmm. Let me check again.Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that even if the function f(x) isn&#39;t onto, but since it&#39;s an odd function on [-4,4], if f(x) is continuous (which is probably the case since it&#39;s presented as a graph), then the Intermediate Value Theorem would apply. So if f(x) achieves, say, a minimum of -M and maximum of M on [-4,4], then if b is within (-M, M), then there exists a solution. But the options mention -2 &lt; b &lt; 0. So perhaps in the graph (which we don&#39;t have), the function f(x) attains values down to -2 and up to 2. Then, if b is between -2 and 0, then f(x) = b has solutions in x &lt; 0, which are less than 2. So yes, B seems correct. So maybe B is correct.Option C: If a ≠ 0, b = 2, then the equation g(x) = 0 has two real roots.So here, g(x) = a f(x) + 2 = 0 ⇒ f(x) = -2/a. Since a ≠ 0, so f(x) = -2/a. Let&#39;s see. The question is whether this equation has two real roots. Since f is an odd function, which is defined on [-4,4]. If f(x) is such that for some constant c = -2/a, the equation f(x) = c has two real roots. However, since f is odd, if c ≠ 0, then if x is a root, then -x would be a root only if f(-x) = -f(x) = -c. So unless c = 0, the roots don&#39;t come in pairs. Wait, if f(x) = c, then f(-x) = -c. So unless c = 0, the roots for f(x) = c would not be symmetric. Therefore, the number of roots would depend on the function f. If c is in the range of f, there could be one root or multiple roots. But since the function is odd, if c is positive, then the roots for f(x) = c would be in the positive side, and roots for f(x) = -c would be in the negative side. So if we have f(x) = c (c ≠ 0), then the roots would be either on the positive or negative side, not both. Wait, no. Wait, if f(x) is odd, then for f(x) = c, the solutions are x such that f(x) = c. Since f is odd, if x is a solution, then -x is a solution to f(-x) = -c. So unless c = 0, the solutions to f(x) = c are not symmetric. So, for example, if c is positive, the solutions are on the right side (positive x), and if c is negative, solutions are on the left side (negative x). Therefore, if we set c = -2/a, then depending on the sign of a, c can be positive or negative. But regardless, the equation f(x) = c would have how many roots? If the function f is, say, strictly increasing on [-4,4], then f(x) = c would have at most one root. But if it&#39;s more complicated, maybe multiple roots. However, since we don&#39;t have the graph, but in the options, it&#39;s stated that with a ≠ 0 and b = 2, then the equation has two real roots. But considering that f(x) is odd, which passes through the origin, and if you set f(x) = -2/a, which is a constant. Depending on the value of a, -2/a can be any real number except zero. But how do we know if f(x) = k has two roots? Unless the function f(x) crosses the line y = k twice. For example, if f(x) is a cubic-like function, which might have multiple intersections. But without seeing the graph, we can&#39;t be certain. However, in the problem statement, it says &quot;as shown in Figure 1&quot;, but since we don&#39;t have the figure, we have to assume standard properties. Maybe the answer expects that since it&#39;s an odd function, and if you shift it up by 2 (since b=2), but in this case, g(x) = a f(x) + 2. Wait, but a is non-zero. If a is positive, then it&#39;s scaled by a, but still, f(x) is scaled and shifted. However, since b = 2, which is a vertical shift upwards. The equation a f(x) + 2 = 0 ⇒ f(x) = -2/a. Depending on the value of a, but since a ≠ 0, but can be positive or negative. If a is positive, then -2/a is negative; if a is negative, then -2/a is positive. So, for example, if a is positive, then we need to solve f(x) = negative number. Since f is odd, and if the function is continuous, then on the left side (negative x), f(x) is negative, so perhaps there&#39;s a solution there. But the number of solutions depends on how the function behaves. If it&#39;s a straight line through the origin, then f(x) = c would have one solution. If it&#39;s a cubic function, maybe three solutions. But since the problem states it&#39;s an odd function on [-4,4], perhaps with multiple humps. However, given that it&#39;s a multiple-choice question and we don&#39;t have the figure, maybe the answer expects that with b = 2, which is a vertical shift, and a ≠ 0, you might get two intersections. But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C? Hmm. Wait, if a ≠ 0 and b = 2, then g(x) = a f(x) + 2. Suppose a is positive, then as x approaches 4, f(x) could be positive or negative. If f(x) is, say, similar to sin(x), which is odd, then a sin(x) + 2 = 0 would have solutions only if |2/a| ≤ |a sin(x)|. Wait, no, wait, sin(x) has a maximum of 1. So if a sin(x) + 2 = 0 ⇒ sin(x) = -2/a. Then, to have a solution, |-2/a| ≤ 1 ⇒ |a| ≥ 2. So if |a| ≥ 2, then there are solutions. But the number of solutions would depend on the interval. Since x is in [-4,4], but sin(x) is periodic, but in this case, the function is defined on [-4,4], not necessarily periodic. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is assuming that f(x) is a linear function? But no, since it&#39;s just stated as an odd function.Alternatively, maybe since f(x) is odd and g(x) = a f(x) + 2, setting this to zero: a f(x) = -2 ⇒ f(x) = -2/a. Since f is odd, and assuming f(x) is surjective (which it would be if it&#39;s continuous and goes from -4 to 4 with increasing/decreasing appropriately), then for any c in the range of f, there exists an x. But the number of solutions depends on the function. If the function is injective (one-to-one), then only one solution. If it&#39;s not injective, maybe multiple. But again, without the figure, we can&#39;t know. However, the options are given, so maybe in the context of the question, the answer is C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is incorrect. For example, if a = 1, then f(x) = -2, which would be a single solution on the left side (if f is strictly increasing). If a = -1, then f(x) = 2, which would be a single solution on the right side. So maybe only one solution each. Hence, C would be incorrect. Therefore, maybe C is wrong. So perhaps C is incorrect.Option D: If a ≥ 1, b &lt; 0, then the equation g(x) = 0 has three real roots.So here, g(x) = a f(x) + b = 0 ⇒ f(x) = -b/a. Since a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, then -b/a is positive (because b is negative, so -b is positive, and divided by positive a). So we have f(x) = positive constant. Since f is odd, the solutions to f(x) = positive constant would be on the positive x side. If f(x) is, say, a cubic-like function that starts at -4, goes up to some maximum at x=4, then maybe f(x) = k (positive) would have one solution on the positive side. But if the function has a hump, maybe it could have two solutions? Wait, but for an odd function, the function on the positive side determines the negative side. If it&#39;s increasing on the positive side, then f(x) = k would have only one solution. But if the function has a maximum above k and then decreases, then f(x) = k could have two solutions on the positive side. Then, since the function is odd, the total solutions would be two (on positive side) and none on the negative side (since f(x) = k on negative side would require f(x) = -k on positive side). Wait, getting confused.Alternatively, if f(x) is similar to x^3, which is odd. If we have f(x) = x^3, then a x^3 + b = 0 ⇒ x^3 = -b/a. If b &lt; 0 and a ≥ 1, then -b/a is positive, so x = (-b/a)^(1/3). Only one real root. So in this case, only one real root. But if f(x) is a different function, maybe with multiple humps. For example, if f(x) is a sine function between -4 and 4, then f(x) = k could have multiple solutions. But again, without the graph, it&#39;s hard to tell. But in the absence of specific information, maybe the answer expects that three real roots are possible. Wait, but the original function is defined on [-4,4]. If f(x) is a cubic function scaled appropriately, maybe crossing the line y = k three times. But cubic function is monotonic unless it has local maxima and minima. If f(x) is a cubic with two extrema, then yes, f(x) = k could have three solutions. For example, f(x) = x^3 - 3x, which is odd. Then solving x^3 - 3x = k. Depending on k, this equation can have one or three real roots. If |k| &lt; 2, then three real roots; if |k| &gt; 2, one real root. So if in this case, if -b/a is less than the local maximum, then three roots. But since a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, -b/a is positive and equal to |b|/a. Since b &lt; 0, |b| = -b. So |b|/a. Since a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, |b| can be any positive number, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify how large |b| is. If |b|/a is less than the maximum value of f(x), then three roots. If it&#39;s greater, then only one root. But since the problem states &quot;has three real roots&quot;, this would depend on |b| being sufficiently small. However, the problem says &quot;If a ≥ 1, b &lt; 0&quot;, without any restriction on the size of b. So unless we know that the maximum value of f(x) is large enough, we can&#39;t guarantee three roots. But given that the function is defined on [-4,4], and is odd, maybe the maximum value is, say, 4 (if it&#39;s linear, f(x) = x). Then |b|/a &lt; 4. But if b is very negative, say b = -100, then |b|/a = 100/a. Since a ≥ 1, |b|/a could be as large as 100, which would exceed the maximum value of f(x) if it&#39;s only defined up to 4. Then, the equation f(x) = 100/a would have no solution. Therefore, the statement D is not necessarily true. Hence, D is incorrect.But wait, the problem might be assuming that f(x) has a certain shape. For example, if from the figure (which we don&#39;t have), f(x) crosses the x-axis at -4, 0, and 4, and has a maximum and minimum in between. If that&#39;s the case, then for some constants, the equation g(x)=0 could have three roots. But without the figure, it&#39;s hard to say. However, in the absence of specific information, but given that it&#39;s a multiple-choice question, and the options are presented, perhaps D is correct. Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that if the function is like x^3, then even with a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, you only get one root. But if the function is different, maybe three roots. Hmm.Wait, going back to the problem statement: it says &quot;As shown in Figure 1, f(x) is a function defined on the interval [-4, 4] and is an odd function.&quot; So maybe in the original figure (which we don&#39;t have), the function f(x) might have a specific shape that allows three roots when shifted appropriately. But since we can&#39;t see the figure, we have to make general assumptions.Alternatively, maybe the answer is B and D? But the problem says &quot;the correct one is ( )&quot;, implying only one is correct. Wait, but maybe not. Let&#39;s check again.Wait, in the case of option D: If a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, then g(x) = 0 ⇒ f(x) = -b/a. Since b &lt; 0, -b is positive, so -b/a is positive. So f(x) = positive value. Since f is odd, so f(x) is positive when x is positive (assuming typical behavior). If the function f(x) on the positive side [0,4] is increasing to a maximum at x=4, then f(x) = c (positive) would have one solution. If the function f(x) on [0,4] first increases then decreases, creating a local maximum, then f(x) = c could have two solutions on [0,4], leading to two positive roots and one negative root (due to oddness?), wait, no. Wait, f(x) is odd, so f(-x) = -f(x). So if x is a solution to f(x) = c (positive), then -x is a solution to f(-x) = -c. But if we have f(x) = c, which is positive, solutions are on the positive side. If the function f(x) is such that f(x) = c has two solutions on the positive side (say, x1 and x2), then there are two positive roots and no negative roots. But since the function is odd, the negative side would have f(x) = -c, which is a different equation. Therefore, the total number of roots for f(x) = c would depend on the positive side. So if f(x) = c has two solutions on the positive side, then total roots are two. If it has one solution, total roots are one. Therefore, unless c = 0, which gives x=0, the number of roots depends on the function&#39;s shape.But the problem states that g(x) = 0 has three real roots. For that to happen, f(x) = -b/a must have three solutions. However, since f is odd, and c = -b/a is positive, how can f(x) = c have three solutions? Only if c = 0, but c is positive here. Wait, no. If f(x) is zero only at x=0, and positive elsewhere, then f(x) = c would have one solution. If f(x) has a maximum above c and a minimum below -c, but since we are setting f(x) = c, it&#39;s not clear. This is confusing without the graph. Maybe the key here is that since f is odd and the equation is a f(x) + b = 0, the number of roots would be influenced by the intersection points. If a is large (a ≥ 1), scaling up f(x), then the function a f(x) would have a steeper slope. Then adding b &lt; 0 shifts it downward. Wait, no: g(x) = a f(x) + b. If b &lt; 0, then it&#39;s a vertical shift downward. But since f(x) is odd, and a ≥ 1, maybe the function a f(x) oscillates more or has more intersections with the horizontal axis when shifted down by b. But this is vague.Alternatively, consider that if a is large, then a f(x) dominates, so g(x) = a f(x) + b ≈ a f(x), which, being odd, would cross the x-axis at least once. But with the shift b &lt; 0, maybe it creates more crossings. However, without knowing the exact nature of f(x), it&#39;s hard to say. Given that all these options require knowing specifics about f(x) that aren&#39;t provided (except it&#39;s odd and on [-4,4]), but the question is from a problem that includes a figure, which we don&#39;t have. Therefore, perhaps in the original figure, f(x) has three intersections when shifted appropriately, making D correct. But as a test-taker without the figure, maybe we need to deduce based on the given options.Wait, but let&#39;s think differently. Since f(x) is odd, and we&#39;re adding a linear transformation. For option D, a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0. So g(x) = a f(x) + b. Let&#39;s consider x=0: g(0) = a f(0) + b = 0 + b = b &lt; 0. So the function passes below the origin. Then, as x approaches 4, f(x) is some value, say, M (positive), so g(4) = a M + b. Since a ≥ 1 and M could be positive, this could be positive if a M &gt; |b|. Similarly, at x = -4, f(-4) = -M, so g(-4) = -a M + b. Since b &lt; 0, this would be negative if a M &gt; |b|. Therefore, if at x=4, g(4) &gt; 0, and at x=-4, g(-4) &lt; 0, and since the function is continuous (assuming), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there would be a root between -4 and 4. But how many roots?If the function crosses from negative at x=-4 to positive at x=4, passing through below zero at x=0, it might cross the x-axis three times: once in (-4, 0), once at some point, but this depends on the shape. Alternatively, if the function is monotonic, it would cross once. If it&#39;s a cubic-like function, maybe three times. Since f(x) is odd, and scaled by a ≥ 1, which might make it steeper, and shifted down by b &lt; 0. If the original f(x) had a shape that allows multiple crossings when scaled and shifted, then D could be correct. However, without knowing the exact shape, this is speculative. But given that it&#39;s a multiple-choice question and the other options have issues, perhaps D is the intended answer.But earlier analysis suggested that B is correct. Let me recheck.Rechecking Option B:Given a = -1, so g(x) = -f(x) + b, with -2 &lt; b &lt; 0. We set g(x) = 0 ⇒ -f(x) + b = 0 ⇒ f(x) = b. Since b is between -2 and 0. Since f is odd, then f(x) = b would require x such that f(x) = b. Because f is odd, and b is negative, the solutions x would be in the negative part of the domain (x &lt; 0). Therefore, those x are less than 0, which are certainly less than 2. Therefore, the equation has a real root less than 2. Hence, B is correct.But wait, could there also be a root greater than 2? If f(x) = b has a solution in x &gt; 0, but since f is odd, f(x) = b (negative) would imply that x &gt; 0, but f(x) would need to be negative there. For an odd function, if x &gt; 0, f(x) is the negation of f(-x). So if f(x) is negative for x &gt; 0, then f(-x) = -f(x) would be positive. But that doesn&#39;t necessarily prevent f(x) from being negative on the positive side. However, if the function is, say, positive for x &gt; 0 and negative for x &lt; 0, then f(x) = b (negative) would only have solutions in x &lt; 0. Therefore, the roots would all be less than 0, hence less than 2. Therefore, B is correct.Option C: If a ≠ 0, b = 2, then the equation g(x)=0 has two real roots.As before, solving f(x) = -2/a. Since a ≠ 0, this is some constant. Depending on the value of a, this could be positive or negative. If a is positive, then -2/a is negative; if a is negative, then -2/a is positive. Suppose a is positive, then f(x) = -2/a is negative, so solutions in x &lt; 0; if a is negative, then f(x) = positive number, solutions in x &gt; 0. In either case, maybe only one solution. Unless the function f(x) has multiple crossings. But since the problem states &quot;two real roots&quot;, but without knowing f(x)&#39;s shape, we can&#39;t be sure. However, since the function is odd, the equation f(x) = c (non-zero) can&#39;t have an even number of roots because roots come in pairs if symmetric, but for odd functions, if x is a solution, then -x is a solution to f(x) = -c. Therefore, the number of roots for f(x) = c would be the same as for f(x) = -c. If c ≠ 0, the roots for f(x)=c and f(x)=-c would be in different halves of the domain. Therefore, unless c=0, which has one root, the number of roots for non-zero c is even? No, wait, suppose f(x) is a cubic function. Then f(x) = c could have one real root if c is beyond the local maximum or minimum, or three real roots if between. But in that case, the number of roots would be odd. Wait, but for a cubic function, which is odd, f(x) = c can have one or three real roots. If it&#39;s three, they would be x1, x2, x3, but since the function is odd, if x is a root, then -x would be a root for f(x) = -c. So for f(x) = c, which is non-zero, if there are three roots, they can&#39;t be symmetric. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let&#39;s take an example: f(x) = x^3, which is odd. Then f(x) = c has one real root: x = c^(1/3). So only one root. If f(x) = x^3 - x, which is also odd. Then solving x^3 - x = c. Depending on c, this can have one or three roots. For |c| &lt; 2/(3√3), three roots; otherwise, one root. So for c = -2/a, if a is such that |c| is small enough, three roots; otherwise, one. But the problem states &quot;has two real roots&quot;. Hmm. Two real roots would require the equation f(x) = c to have two solutions, but for a continuous function, crossing the line y=c twice would require a local maximum above c and a local minimum below c, but for odd functions, which have symmetry, this might not produce two roots. Wait, actually, for a continuous function on an interval, the number of real roots must be odd if it crosses the line an odd number of times, but the interval is closed. Wait, no, if the function starts below and ends above, it crosses once. If it starts below, goes above, then below, then above, it crosses three times. But the total number must be odd for a continuous function on an interval, right? Wait, not necessarily if the function doesn&#39;t cross at the endpoints. For example, if the function starts and ends on the same side, then crossings must be even. If starts and ends on different sides, crossings are odd. So, if f(x) is continuous on [0,4], and f(0) = 0, f(4) = M &gt; 0. If we set f(x) = c where 0 &lt; c &lt; M, then there&#39;s at least one root. But if the function has a dip below c in between, then multiple roots. But depending on the shape. However, for an odd function, the behavior on the positive side is mirrored on the negative side. But for the equation f(x) = c (positive), the solutions would be on the positive side. If the function on the positive side goes from 0 to M, and if it&#39;s monotonic, then one solution. If it goes up, then down, then up, maybe three solutions. But the exact number isn&#39;t determined without the graph. Since the problem gives this as an option, but without the figure, it&#39;s hard to say. However, given that b = 2 is a vertical shift upwards, and a ≠ 0, the equation a f(x) + 2 = 0 ⇒ f(x) = -2/a. If a is negative, then -2/a is positive, leading to potential roots on the positive side. If a is positive, then -2/a is negative, roots on the negative side. Depending on the slope and shape, it might have one or more roots. But unless specified, we can&#39;t assume two roots. Hence, C is likely incorrect.Option D: If a ≥ 1, b &lt; 0, then the equation g(x)=0 has three real roots.Assuming f(x) is a cubic-like function on [-4,4], then scaling it by a ≥ 1 makes it steeper, and shifting down by b &lt; 0. This might result in the function crossing the x-axis three times: once on the negative side, once near the center, and once on the positive side. However, since f(x) is odd, the central root would be at x=0 if b=0, but here b &lt; 0 shifts it down, so maybe the crossing at x=0 is eliminated, but crossings on either side. Wait, but g(0) = a f(0) + b = 0 + b &lt; 0. So the function is below zero at x=0. If at x=4, g(4) = a f(4) + b. Since a ≥ 1 and b &lt; 0, if f(4) is positive and large enough, g(4) could be positive, leading to a root between 0 and 4. Similarly, at x=-4, g(-4) = a f(-4) + b = -a f(4) + b. Since f(4) is positive, -a f(4) is negative, adding b &lt; 0 keeps it negative. So the function goes from negative at x=-4 to negative at x=0 to possibly positive at x=4. Therefore, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there&#39;s at least one root in (0, 4). On the left side, from x=-4 to x=0, the function goes from negative to negative, so no crossing. Therefore, only one real root. Hence, D would be incorrect. But this contradicts the previous thought.Wait, but if f(x) is a cubic function, like f(x) = x^3 - kx, then scaling and shifting might create three roots. Let&#39;s take a concrete example. Let f(x) = x^3 - 16x, which is odd. Let a = 1, b = -2. Then g(x) = x^3 - 16x - 2. Setting this to zero: x^3 - 16x - 2 = 0. How many real roots does this have? A cubic equation has at least one real root. Using calculus, the derivative is 3x^2 - 16. Setting to zero: x = ±√(16/3) ≈ ±2.309. So local maximum at x ≈ -2.309 and local minimum at x ≈ 2.309. Evaluating g at these points:At x ≈ -2.309:g(-2.309) ≈ (-2.309)^3 -16*(-2.309) -2 ≈ -12.3 + 36.94 -2 ≈ 22.64 &gt; 0At x ≈ 2.309:g(2.309) ≈ (2.309)^3 -16*(2.309) -2 ≈ 12.3 - 36.94 -2 ≈ -26.64 &lt; 0So the function goes from negative at x=-4, to positive at x≈-2.309, back to negative at x=0, then to negative at x≈2.309, and finally to positive as x approaches 4. Therefore, roots are in (-4, -2.309), (-2.309, 0), and (2.309, 4). Wait, but according to the calculation, at x=-4, g(-4) = (-4)^3 -16*(-4) -2 = -64 + 64 -2 = -2. At x=-2.309, g is positive. So one root between -4 and -2.309, another between -2.309 and 0. And since at x=0, g(0) = -2, and at x=2.309, g is -26.64, then rising to g(4) = 64 - 64 -2 = -2. Wait, no, x=4: g(4) = 4^3 -16*4 -2 = 64 -64 -2 = -2. So from x=2.309 to x=4, g(x) goes from -26.64 to -2, still negative. Therefore, only two real roots: one between -4 and -2.309, and another between -2.309 and 0. But wait, this contradicts the earlier thought. Wait, but in this case, the function only crosses twice on the left side and not on the right side. Hmm. So maybe three roots? Wait, maybe not. If at x=4, g(x) = -2, which is the same as at x=-4. So from x=0 to x=4, g(x) remains negative. Therefore, only two real roots on the left side. Therefore, D would be incorrect in this case.But this depends on the specific function. If f(x) is linear, say f(x) = x, then g(x) = a x + b. Setting to zero: x = -b/a. Only one real root. So again, D would be incorrect.Therefore, based on these examples, D is not necessarily correct. Hence, the correct answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine which statement about the function ( g(x) = a f(x) + b ) is correct, where ( f(x) ) is an odd function defined on the interval ([-4, 4]).Key steps and reasoning:1. Understanding Odd Functions: An odd function satisfies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ). This symmetry implies that if ( (x, y) ) is on the graph, then ( (-x, -y) ) is also on the graph.2. Option A: If ( a &lt; 0 ), the graph of ( g(x) ) is symmetric with respect to the origin.   - Analysis: For ( g(x) ) to be odd, ( g(-x) = -g(x) ). However, ( g(-x) = -a f(x) + b ) and ( -g(x) = -a f(x) - b ). Unless ( b = 0 ), ( g(x) ) is not symmetric about the origin. Since ( b ) is not specified to be zero, A is incorrect.3. Option B: If ( a = -1 ) and ( -2 &lt; b &lt; 0 ), the equation ( g(x) = 0 ) has a real root less than 2.   - Analysis: ( g(x) = -f(x) + b = 0 ) implies ( f(x) = b ). Since ( b ) is negative and ( f(x) ) is odd, the solution ( x ) must be in the negative interval ([-4, 0)), which is less than 2. B is correct.4. Option C: If ( a neq 0 ) and ( b = 2 ), the equation ( g(x) = 0 ) has two real roots.   - Analysis: Solving ( a f(x) + 2 = 0 ) gives ( f(x) = -2/a ). The number of roots depends on the function ( f(x) ). Since ( f(x) ) is odd, roots for ( f(x) = c ) (non-zero) are not necessarily even. Without specific information on ( f(x) ), we cannot guarantee two roots. C is incorrect.5. Option D: If ( a geq 1 ) and ( b &lt; 0 ), the equation ( g(x) = 0 ) has three real roots.   - Analysis: Solving ( a f(x) + b = 0 ) gives ( f(x) = -b/a ). Since ( -b/a ) is positive, roots depend on ( f(x) )&#39;s behavior. Without specific information on ( f(x) ), we cannot guarantee three roots. Examples show varying results. D is incorrect.Conclusion: The correct answer is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ca8eb55e></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>🔑:</span>4.B.If a=-1, the graph of f(x) is reflected over the x-axis to get -f(x); if -2&lt;b&lt;0, the graph of -f(x) is translated downward along the y-axis by |b| units, then there are real roots less than 2.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-bcb74a31 data-v-ca8eb55e><div class="review" data-v-ca8eb55e><div class="review-title" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>❓:</span>2.

The problem is:√(x + 3 - 2√(x + 2)) + √(x + 6 - 4√(x + 2)) = 1Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with nested square roots. I need to find all real solutions x that satisfy this equation. Let me think about how to simplify these radicals. Maybe I can make a substitution to reduce the complexity.First, I notice that both radicals inside the square roots have expressions involving √(x + 2). Let me set t = √(x + 2). Then, t squared is x + 2, so x = t² - 2. That might help simplify the equation.Let me substitute x = t² - 2 into the equation. Let&#39;s see:First radical: √(x + 3 - 2√(x + 2)) becomes √( (t² - 2) + 3 - 2t )Simplify inside the first radical:t² - 2 + 3 - 2t = t² + 1 - 2tSo that&#39;s √(t² - 2t + 1). Hmm, t² - 2t + 1 is (t - 1)². So the first radical simplifies to |t - 1|.Similarly, the second radical: √(x + 6 - 4√(x + 2)) becomes √( (t² - 2) + 6 - 4t )Simplify inside the second radical:t² - 2 + 6 - 4t = t² + 4 - 4tWhich is t² - 4t + 4, and that factors into (t - 2)². So the second radical becomes |t - 2|.So substituting back, the original equation becomes:|t - 1| + |t - 2| = 1But remember that t = √(x + 2). Since square roots are non-negative, t must be ≥ 0. So t is in [0, ∞).Now, we have the equation |t - 1| + |t - 2| = 1. Let&#39;s solve this equation for t ≥ 0.To handle absolute values, we can consider different intervals where the expressions inside the absolute values are non-negative or non-positive. The critical points are at t = 1 and t = 2, so we should break down the problem into intervals: t &lt; 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2, and t &gt; 2.Case 1: t &lt; 1In this interval, both t - 1 and t - 2 are negative. So |t - 1| = 1 - t and |t - 2| = 2 - t.Then the equation becomes:(1 - t) + (2 - t) = 1 ⇒ 3 - 2t = 1 ⇒ -2t = -2 ⇒ t = 1But in this case, t &lt; 1, so t = 1 is not in the interval. So no solution here.Case 2: 1 ≤ t ≤ 2Here, t - 1 is non-negative and t - 2 is non-positive. So |t - 1| = t - 1 and |t - 2| = 2 - t.Equation becomes:(t - 1) + (2 - t) = 1 ⇒ (t - 1 + 2 - t) = 1 ⇒ (1) = 1So this simplifies to 1 = 1, which is always true. Therefore, every t in [1, 2] satisfies the equation in this interval.Case 3: t &gt; 2In this interval, both t - 1 and t - 2 are positive. So |t - 1| = t - 1 and |t - 2| = t - 2.Equation becomes:(t - 1) + (t - 2) = 1 ⇒ 2t - 3 = 1 ⇒ 2t = 4 ⇒ t = 2But t &gt; 2 in this case, so t = 2 is not in the interval. Therefore, no solution here.So combining all cases, the solutions for t are in the interval [1, 2].But remember that t = √(x + 2). Therefore, t is in [1, 2] implies √(x + 2) is in [1, 2]. Let&#39;s solve for x:√(x + 2) ≥ 1 ⇒ x + 2 ≥ 1 ⇒ x ≥ -1√(x + 2) ≤ 2 ⇒ x + 2 ≤ 4 ⇒ x ≤ 2Therefore, x must be in [-1, 2].But wait, we need to check if all x in [-1, 2] satisfy the original equation. Because sometimes when we square both sides or manipulate equations, we might introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, since we made substitutions and considered absolute values properly, but let me verify.Let me check a value in [-1, 2], say x = 0.Original equation:Left side: √(0 + 3 - 2√(0 + 2)) + √(0 + 6 - 4√(0 + 2))Calculate √(0 + 2) = √2 ≈ 1.414First radical: √(3 - 2*1.414) ≈ √(3 - 2.828) ≈ √(0.172) ≈ 0.415Second radical: √(6 - 4*1.414) ≈ √(6 - 5.656) ≈ √(0.344) ≈ 0.586Sum ≈ 0.415 + 0.586 ≈ 1.001 ≈ 1, which is correct. So x = 0 is a solution.Another test: x = 2.Compute √(2 + 3 - 2√(2 + 2)) + √(2 + 6 - 4√(2 + 2))√(5 - 2*2) + √(8 - 4*2) = √(5 - 4) + √(8 - 8) = √1 + √0 = 1 + 0 = 1. Correct.Another test: x = -1.Compute √(-1 + 3 - 2√(-1 + 2)) + √(-1 + 6 - 4√(-1 + 2))Simplify inside radicals:First radical: √(2 - 2√1) = √(2 - 2*1) = √0 = 0Second radical: √(5 - 4√1) = √(5 - 4) = √1 = 1Sum is 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.So x = -1, 0, 2 all work. Let&#39;s check a value in between, like x = 1.√(1 + 3 - 2√(1 + 2)) + √(1 + 6 - 4√(1 + 2)) = √(4 - 2√3) + √(7 - 4√3)Compute √3 ≈ 1.732First radical: 4 - 2*1.732 ≈ 4 - 3.464 ≈ 0.536, √0.536 ≈ 0.732Second radical: 7 - 4*1.732 ≈ 7 - 6.928 ≈ 0.072, √0.072 ≈ 0.268Sum ≈ 0.732 + 0.268 ≈ 1. Correct.So it seems all x in [-1, 2] satisfy the equation. Therefore, the solution set is [-1, 2].But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check a value just outside the interval, like x = 2.1.First, check if x is allowed. x + 2 = 4.1, so √(4.1) ≈ 2.024, so t ≈ 2.024 which is greater than 2. But in our previous solution, t must be in [1,2], so x = 2.1 is outside the solution set.Compute left side:√(2.1 + 3 - 2√(2.1 + 2)) + √(2.1 + 6 - 4√(2.1 + 2))Simplify:First radical: √(5.1 - 2√4.1) ≈ √(5.1 - 2*2.024) ≈ √(5.1 - 4.048) ≈ √1.052 ≈ 1.025Second radical: √(8.1 - 4√4.1) ≈ √(8.1 - 4*2.024) ≈ √(8.1 - 8.096) ≈ √0.004 ≈ 0.063Sum ≈ 1.025 + 0.063 ≈ 1.088 ≈ 1.09 ≠ 1. So not a solution. Correct.Another check: x = -1.1, which is just below -1.x + 2 = 0.9, √0.9 ≈ 0.948, which is less than 1. So t is in [0,1), which would mean x is in [-2, -1). But x must be ≥ -1, so x = -1.1 is invalid. So x cannot be less than -1. Wait, but x must satisfy x + 2 ≥ 0 since t = √(x + 2). So x ≥ -2, but our solution was x ∈ [-1, 2]. Let me confirm.Wait, when we found t ∈ [1,2], so √(x + 2) ∈ [1,2], which implies x + 2 ∈ [1,4], so x ∈ [-1, 2]. But x + 2 ≥ 0 for t to be real, so x ≥ -2. But our solution set is x ∈ [-1,2]. So x between -2 and -1 would correspond to t between 0 and 1, but in our earlier analysis, t ∈ [1,2] gives x ∈ [-1, 2]. So x between -2 and -1 is not part of the solution set. Let me check x = -1.5.Compute t = √(-1.5 + 2) = √0.5 ≈ 0.707, which is in [0,1). Then |t -1| + |t -2| = |0.707 -1| + |0.707 -2| ≈ 0.293 + 1.293 ≈ 1.586 ≠1. So x = -1.5 does not satisfy the equation, which is outside our solution set. Therefore, indeed the solution set is x ∈ [-1,2].Therefore, the final answer is the interval from -1 to 2, inclusive.Final AnswerThe set of real solutions is boxed{[-1, 2]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation:[sqrt{x + 3 - 2 sqrt{x + 2}} + sqrt{x + 6 - 4 sqrt{x + 2}} = 1]we start by making a substitution ( t = sqrt{x + 2} ). This implies ( x = t^2 - 2 ). Substituting ( x = t^2 - 2 ) into the equation, we simplify the radicals:1. The first radical becomes:   [   sqrt{(t^2 - 2) + 3 - 2t} = sqrt{t^2 - 2t + 1} = |t - 1|   ]2. The second radical becomes:   [   sqrt{(t^2 - 2) + 6 - 4t} = sqrt{t^2 - 4t + 4} = |t - 2|   ]The equation simplifies to:[|t - 1| + |t - 2| = 1]We solve this equation for ( t geq 0 ):- Case 1: ( t &lt; 1 )  [  (1 - t) + (2 - t) = 1 implies 3 - 2t = 1 implies t = 1 quad (text{not valid as } t &lt; 1)  ]- Case 2: ( 1 leq t leq 2 )  [  (t - 1) + (2 - t) = 1 implies 1 = 1 quad (text{always true})  ]  Solutions in this interval are ( t in [1, 2] ).- Case 3: ( t &gt; 2 )  [  (t - 1) + (t - 2) = 1 implies 2t - 3 = 1 implies t = 2 quad (text{not valid as } t &gt; 2)  ]Thus, ( t in [1, 2] ). Converting back to ( x ):- ( t = sqrt{x + 2} ) implies ( 1 leq sqrt{x + 2} leq 2 )- Squaring all parts: ( 1 leq x + 2 leq 4 )- Solving for ( x ): ( -1 leq x leq 2 )Verification of values within ([-1, 2]) confirms they satisfy the original equation. Therefore, the set of real solutions is:[boxed{[-1, 2]}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to solve this equation step by step. The equation is:√(x + 3 - 2√(x + 2)) + √(x + 6 - 4√(x + 2)) = 1Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with nested square roots. Maybe I can simplify the expressions inside the square roots first. Let me look at each term separately.Starting with the first square root: √(x + 3 - 2√(x + 2)). Let me denote √(x + 2) as another variable to simplify things. Let’s set y = √(x + 2). Then, y² = x + 2, so x = y² - 2. Let&#39;s substitute this into the expression inside the first square root.x + 3 - 2√(x + 2) becomes (y² - 2) + 3 - 2y. Simplify that: y² - 2 + 3 - 2y = y² + 1 - 2y. Hmm, that&#39;s a quadratic in y. Let me check if it factors.y² - 2y + 1. Wait, that&#39;s (y - 1)²! Yes, because (y - 1)² = y² - 2y + 1. So the first square root simplifies to √[(y - 1)²] which is |y - 1|. Since y is a square root, y = √(x + 2) ≥ 0, so y is non-negative. But |y - 1| can be either y - 1 or 1 - y depending on whether y ≥ 1 or y &lt; 1. I need to keep that in mind.Now let&#39;s do the same substitution for the second square root: √(x + 6 - 4√(x + 2)). Again, using y = √(x + 2), so x = y² - 2. Substitute into the expression:x + 6 - 4√(x + 2) becomes (y² - 2) + 6 - 4y = y² + 4 - 4y. That&#39;s another quadratic in y. Let&#39;s see if that factors.y² - 4y + 4. That factors into (y - 2)². So the second square root simplifies to √[(y - 2)²] which is |y - 2|. Again, since y ≥ 0, |y - 2| is either y - 2 if y ≥ 2, or 2 - y if y &lt; 2.So now, the original equation becomes:|y - 1| + |y - 2| = 1, where y = √(x + 2) and y ≥ 0.So now, we can analyze the equation |y - 1| + |y - 2| = 1. Let me consider different intervals for y based on the points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign, which are y = 1 and y = 2.Case 1: y &lt; 1. Then, |y - 1| = 1 - y and |y - 2| = 2 - y. So the equation becomes (1 - y) + (2 - y) = 1. Simplify: 3 - 2y = 1 ⇒ -2y = -2 ⇒ y = 1. But this case assumes y &lt; 1, so y = 1 is not in this interval. So no solution here.Case 2: 1 ≤ y &lt; 2. Then, |y - 1| = y - 1 and |y - 2| = 2 - y. So the equation is (y - 1) + (2 - y) = 1. Simplify: (y - 1 + 2 - y) = 1 ⇒ 1 = 1. Wait, that simplifies to 1 = 1, which is always true. So in this interval, any y between 1 and 2 (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of 2) satisfies the equation. So all y in [1, 2) are solutions here.Case 3: y ≥ 2. Then, |y - 1| = y - 1 and |y - 2| = y - 2. So the equation becomes (y - 1) + (y - 2) = 1 ⇒ 2y - 3 = 1 ⇒ 2y = 4 ⇒ y = 2. Since y = 2 is in the interval y ≥ 2, this is a valid solution. So y = 2 is a solution.So combining the solutions from the cases: y ∈ [1, 2]. So y can be any real number between 1 and 2, including 1 and 2. Wait, but in case 2, the upper bound was y &lt; 2, but in case 3, y = 2 is a solution. So overall, y ∈ [1, 2].But remember that y = √(x + 2). So we can write:1 ≤ √(x + 2) ≤ 2To solve for x, we can square all parts of the inequality. Since all parts are non-negative (square roots are non-negative), squaring is allowed without reversing inequalities.First, √(x + 2) ≥ 1 ⇒ x + 2 ≥ 1² ⇒ x + 2 ≥ 1 ⇒ x ≥ -1Second, √(x + 2) ≤ 2 ⇒ x + 2 ≤ 4 ⇒ x ≤ 2So combining these, x must satisfy -1 ≤ x ≤ 2.But wait, we need to check if all x in [-1, 2] satisfy the original equation. Because sometimes when dealing with substitutions and squaring, extraneous solutions can be introduced. Let me verify with x in this interval.But first, let me recall that the original equation is:√(x + 3 - 2√(x + 2)) + √(x + 6 - 4√(x + 2)) = 1We substituted y = √(x + 2), converted the equation to |y - 1| + |y - 2| = 1, found y ∈ [1, 2], which translates to x ∈ [-1, 2]. But let&#39;s check if this is indeed the case.Take for example x = -1:Check if x = -1 is a solution.Compute √(x + 3 - 2√(x + 2)) = √(-1 + 3 - 2√(-1 + 2)) = √(2 - 2√(1)) = √(2 - 2*1) = √0 = 0Second term: √(x + 6 - 4√(x + 2)) = √(-1 + 6 - 4√1) = √(5 - 4*1) = √1 = 1Sum: 0 + 1 = 1. Correct. So x = -1 is a solution.Now take x = 2:First term: √(2 + 3 - 2√(2 + 2)) = √(5 - 2*2) = √(5 - 4) = √1 = 1Second term: √(2 + 6 - 4√(2 + 2)) = √(8 - 4*2) = √(8 - 8) = √0 = 0Sum: 1 + 0 = 1. Correct. So x = 2 is a solution.Now let&#39;s check a point in between, say x = 0.First term: √(0 + 3 - 2√(0 + 2)) = √(3 - 2√2) ≈ √(3 - 2.828) ≈ √(0.172) ≈ 0.414Second term: √(0 + 6 - 4√(0 + 2)) = √(6 - 4√2) ≈ √(6 - 5.656) ≈ √(0.344) ≈ 0.586Sum ≈ 0.414 + 0.586 ≈ 1.0. Close enough. So x = 0 is a solution. Let me verify exact values.Note that √(3 - 2√2) can be written as √( (√2 - 1)^2 ) because (√2 - 1)^2 = 2 - 2√2 + 1 = 3 - 2√2. So √(3 - 2√2) = |√2 - 1| = √2 - 1 ≈ 0.414.Similarly, √(6 - 4√2) = √( (2 - √2)^2 ) since (2 - √2)^2 = 4 - 4√2 + 2 = 6 - 4√2. So √(6 - 4√2) = 2 - √2 ≈ 0.586.Adding those two: (√2 - 1) + (2 - √2) = 1. So exactly 1. Hence, x = 0 is a valid solution.Therefore, all x in [-1, 2] satisfy the original equation. But let me check if there are any restrictions that I might have missed.We need to ensure that the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative.First term inside the first square root: x + 3 - 2√(x + 2) ≥ 0.But since x ∈ [-1, 2], and y = √(x + 2) ∈ [1, 2], then x + 3 - 2√(x + 2) = y² +1 -2y = (y - 1)^2 ≥ 0, which is always true.Similarly, the second term inside the square root: x + 6 - 4√(x + 2) = y² +4 -4y = (y - 2)^2 ≥ 0, which is also always true. So all the square roots are defined for x ∈ [-1, 2].Therefore, the set of solutions is all real numbers from -1 to 2, inclusive.But let me check one more point, say x = 1.First term: √(1 + 3 - 2√(1 + 2)) = √(4 - 2√3). Hmm, √3 ≈ 1.732, so 2√3 ≈ 3.464. 4 - 3.464 ≈ 0.536. √0.536 ≈ 0.732.Second term: √(1 + 6 - 4√3) = √(7 - 4√3). 4√3 ≈ 6.928. 7 - 6.928 ≈ 0.072. √0.072 ≈ 0.268.Sum ≈ 0.732 + 0.268 ≈ 1.0. Exactly 1. So x =1 works.Alternatively, exact expressions:√(4 - 2√3) can be written as √3 -1. Let&#39;s check: (√3 -1)^2 = 3 - 2√3 +1 = 4 - 2√3. Yes, so √(4 - 2√3) = √3 -1.Similarly, √(7 - 4√3). Let me see if that&#39;s a perfect square. Suppose (a - b√3)^2 = a² - 2ab√3 + 3b². Set equal to 7 -4√3.Thus, equations: a² + 3b² =7 and 2ab =4. So 2ab=4 ⇒ ab=2. Let’s solve:From ab=2, b=2/a. Substitute into first equation:a² + 3*(4/a²)=7 ⇒ a² + 12/a² =7. Multiply both sides by a²:a⁴ +12 =7a² ⇒ a⁴ -7a² +12=0. Let’s set z=a²:z² -7z +12=0 ⇒ z=(7 ±√(49 -48))/2=(7 ±1)/2 ⇒ z=4 or z=3.Thus, a²=4 ⇒ a=2 (since a is positive, as we are dealing with square roots), then b=2/2=1. So (2 -√3)^2=4 -4√3 +3=7 -4√3. So √(7 -4√3)=2 -√3. Therefore, the sum:(√3 -1)+(2 -√3)=1. So again, exactly 1. So works.Hence, all x in [-1,2] satisfy the equation. Therefore, the solution set is the interval [-1,2].But let me check the original problem statement again. It says &quot;the set of real solutions that satisfy the equation&quot;. So the answer should be all real numbers between -1 and 2, inclusive.But I should make sure that there are no other solutions outside this interval. Suppose someone tries x = 3. Let&#39;s check.x=3: First term: √(3+3 -2√(3+2))=√(6 -2√5). √5≈2.236. 2√5≈4.472. 6 -4.472≈1.528. √1.528≈1.236Second term: √(3+6 -4√5)=√(9 -4√5)≈√(9 -8.944)=√0.056≈0.237. Sum≈1.236+0.237≈1.473≈1.5≠1. So not a solution.x=-2: Check if possible. x=-2 would give √(x +2)=√0=0, but x must be ≥ -2 for √(x+2) to be real. But in our solution set, x starts at -1. So x=-2 is not in the interval. Let&#39;s check x=-1.5, which is in [-2, -1), so not in our solution interval.x=-1.5: First term: √(-1.5 +3 -2√(-1.5 +2))=√(1.5 -2√0.5). √0.5≈0.707. 2√0.5≈1.414. 1.5 -1.414≈0.086. √0.086≈0.293.Second term: √(-1.5 +6 -4√0.5)=√(4.5 -4*0.707)=√(4.5 -2.828)=√1.672≈1.293. Sum≈0.293+1.293≈1.586≠1. So not a solution.Therefore, indeed, only x ∈ [-1,2] satisfy the equation.Hence, the set of real solutions is the closed interval from -1 to 2. Therefore, the answer is boxed{[-1, 2]}.Final AnswerThe set of real solutions is boxed{[-1, 2]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation:[sqrt{x + 3 - 2 sqrt{x + 2}} + sqrt{x + 6 - 4 sqrt{x + 2}} = 1]We start by substituting ( y = sqrt{x + 2} ), which implies ( y^2 = x + 2 ) and ( x = y^2 - 2 ). Substituting ( x ) into the equation, we simplify the expressions inside the square roots:1. For the first term: ( sqrt{x + 3 - 2 sqrt{x + 2}} )   [   x + 3 - 2 sqrt{x + 2} = (y^2 - 2) + 3 - 2y = y^2 - 2y + 1 = (y - 1)^2   ]   This simplifies to ( |y - 1| ).2. For the second term: ( sqrt{x + 6 - 4 sqrt{x + 2}} )   [   x + 6 - 4 sqrt{x + 2} = (y^2 - 2) + 6 - 4y = y^2 - 4y + 4 = (y - 2)^2   ]   This simplifies to ( |y - 2| ).The original equation becomes:[|y - 1| + |y - 2| = 1]We analyze this equation by considering different intervals for ( y ):- Case 1: ( y &lt; 1 )  [  (1 - y) + (2 - y) = 1 implies 3 - 2y = 1 implies y = 1 quad (text{not valid since } y &lt; 1)  ]- Case 2: ( 1 leq y &lt; 2 )  [  (y - 1) + (2 - y) = 1 implies 1 = 1 quad (text{always true})  ]  Solutions in this interval: ( 1 leq y &lt; 2 )- Case 3: ( y geq 2 )  [  (y - 1) + (y - 2) = 1 implies 2y - 3 = 1 implies y = 2 quad (text{valid})  ]Combining the solutions, we get ( 1 leq y leq 2 ). Converting back to ( x ):[1 leq sqrt{x + 2} leq 2 implies 1 leq x + 2 leq 4 implies -1 leq x leq 2]We verify that all ( x ) in ([-1, 2]) satisfy the original equation. The expressions inside the square roots are non-negative for this interval, confirming the solutions.Thus, the set of real solutions is (boxed{[-1, 2]}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ca8eb55e></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>🔑:</span>2. -1 leqslant x leqslant 2</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-bcb74a31 data-v-ca8eb55e><div class="review" data-v-ca8eb55e><div class="review-title" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>❓:</span>7. The Brazilian IMO leader chooses two natural numbers n and k with n&gt;k, and then tells these to his deputy and a participant.

The deputy writes down all binary sequences of length n that differ from the leader&#39;s sequence at exactly k positions. (Example for n=3 and k=1: If the leader chooses 101, the deputy writes down 001, 100, 111.) The participant looks at the sequences written down by the deputy.

Then he tells these numbers to his deputy and a participant. The leader whispers a binary sequence of length n to the deputy. The deputy then writes down all binary sequences of length n that differ from the leader&#39;s sequence at exactly k positions. An example given is for n=3 and k=1: if the leader&#39;s sequence is 101, the deputy writes down 001, 100, and 111. The participant looks at these sequences and needs to guess the original sequence. The question is, how many guesses does the participant need to make at minimum, depending on n and k, to ensure that at least one guess is correct?Alright, let me break this down. So, first, the deputy, upon receiving the original binary sequence, generates all sequences that are Hamming distance k away from it. The participant sees all these sequences and has to figure out the original one. The participant wants to minimize the number of guesses required to guarantee that the original sequence is among their guesses.Hmm. So, in coding theory terms, the deputy is essentially revealing the entire Hamming ball of radius k around the original sequence. The participant&#39;s job is to determine the center of this ball given all the points on its surface. The question then becomes: what&#39;s the minimum number of centers (guesses) needed such that every possible Hamming ball&#39;s surface (the set of sequences at distance exactly k from the center) uniquely identifies the center, or if not, how many centers could possibly correspond to the same surface.Wait, but in this case, the deputy is writing down all the sequences at distance exactly k. So, given that set, how can the participant deduce the original sequence? Or, if there&#39;s ambiguity, how many possible centers could produce the same set of sequences at distance k? Then the participant would need to guess all those possible centers to be sure.So, perhaps the key is to determine the maximum number of centers (original sequences) that can produce the same set of sequences at distance k. Then, the minimal number of guesses needed would be the maximum number of such overlapping centers.Alternatively, if for any two different centers, their sets of sequences at distance k are different, then the participant could uniquely determine the center, hence needing only 1 guess. But that&#39;s probably not the case. For example, take n=3, k=1. Suppose the original sequence is 000. Then the deputy would write 001, 010, 100. If the original sequence was 111, the deputy would write 110, 101, 011. These are different sets. But if you have n=4, k=2, maybe there could be overlaps? Wait, maybe not.Wait, let me think with a small example. Suppose n=4, k=2. Let the original sequence be 0000. The deputy writes all sequences with exactly two 1s: 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100. Now, suppose there&#39;s another original sequence, say 1111. The deputy would write all sequences with exactly two 0s: 1100, 1010, 1001, 0110, 0101, 0011. Wait a minute, that&#39;s the same set of sequences as for 0000. So, in this case, if the original sequence is all 0s or all 1s, the deputy&#39;s list would be the same. Therefore, in this case, the participant cannot distinguish between 0000 and 1111 just by looking at the set of sequences with exactly two 1s (or two 0s). Therefore, the participant would have to guess both possibilities. Hence, the minimal number of guesses needed would be 2 in this case.So, this suggests that when k = n - k, which in this case n=4 and k=2, the sets can overlap. Wait, n=4 and k=2, so n - k = 2. So, in this case, the complement of each sequence in the deputy&#39;s list would flip all bits. If the original sequence is 0000, the sequences with two 1s are the same as the sequences with two 0s when you take their complements (since flipping all bits in 0011 gives 1100, which is a sequence with two 0s). So, this is an example where the deputy&#39;s list is the same for complementary sequences. So, the participant can&#39;t tell if the original sequence was all 0s or all 1s, so they have to guess both.Therefore, in this case, when k = n - k, i.e., when n is even and k = n/2, the deputy&#39;s list for a sequence and its complement are the same. So, the participant would have to guess both the original sequence and its complement.But what if n is odd? For example, n=5, k=2. Then n - k = 3. The deputy&#39;s list for a sequence would be all sequences at distance 2 from it. If you take the complement of each of those sequences, you get sequences at distance 3 from the original sequence. But since k=2, the deputy&#39;s list is about distance 2. So, perhaps in this case, the deputy&#39;s list for a sequence and its complement are different. Therefore, maybe there&#39;s no overlap. Therefore, maybe when k ≠ n - k, the deputy&#39;s list uniquely identifies the original sequence.Wait, but let&#39;s test with n=5, k=2. Suppose the original sequence is 00000. The deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with exactly two 1s. The complement of these sequences would be sequences with exactly three 1s, which are at distance 3 from the original. So, in this case, the deputy&#39;s list for 00000 is different from the deputy&#39;s list for 11111 (which would be sequences with exactly two 0s, i.e., three 1s). So, these are different sets. Therefore, the participant can distinguish between 00000 and 11111. So, when k ≠ n - k, the deputy&#39;s lists for complementary sequences are different, so the participant can tell them apart.Therefore, the overlapping occurs only when the deputy&#39;s list for a sequence and its complement are the same. Which happens when k = n - k, i.e., when n is even and k = n/2. In that case, the deputy&#39;s list for the original sequence and its complement would be the same. For example, n=4, k=2: sequences with two 1s for 0000, and sequences with two 0s for 1111. But in this case, sequences with two 1s are the same as sequences with two 0s when you take complements. So, the deputy&#39;s list for 0000 and 1111 is the same. Therefore, the participant can&#39;t distinguish between them. So, the minimal number of guesses needed in this case would be 2.But in other cases, when k ≠ n - k, the deputy&#39;s list uniquely identifies the original sequence. Therefore, the participant only needs to guess once. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses needed is 1 if k ≠ n - k, and 2 if k = n - k.Wait, but let&#39;s think again. For n=4, k=1. Let me check. If the original sequence is 0000, the deputy lists all sequences with exactly one 1. If the original sequence is 1111, the deputy lists all sequences with exactly one 0. These are different sets. So, in this case, even though k=1 and n - k = 3, which is different, the deputy&#39;s lists are different, so the participant can distinguish. So, the problem only occurs when k = n - k. So, only when n is even and k = n/2, the deputy&#39;s lists for a sequence and its complement coincide.Hence, in general, if n is even and k = n/2, then the deputy&#39;s list for a sequence s is the same as the deputy&#39;s list for its complement s&#39;. Therefore, the participant cannot distinguish between s and s&#39;, so they have to guess both. Otherwise, if k ≠ n - k, then the deputy&#39;s list uniquely identifies the original sequence, so the participant only needs to guess once.Therefore, the minimal number of guesses needed is 1 if k ≠ n - k, and 2 if k = n - k. So, the answer is 1 when n ≠ 2k, and 2 when n = 2k. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses is 2 if n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1.Wait, but let me verify with another example. Take n=6, k=3. Then, if the original sequence is 000000, the deputy writes all sequences with exactly three 1s. The complement of each of these sequences would have exactly three 0s, which are the same as sequences with exactly three 1s. So, the deputy&#39;s list for 000000 and 111111 is the same. Therefore, the participant can&#39;t tell if the original was all 0s or all 1s, so they need to guess both. So, in this case, n=6, k=3, which is n=2k, so k=3=6/2. So, that&#39;s consistent with the previous conclusion.Another example: n=5, k=2. Original sequence 00000, deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with two 1s. Original sequence 11111, deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with two 0s (i.e., three 1s). These are different sets. Therefore, participant can distinguish, so only 1 guess needed. Since n=5 is odd, so k=2 is not equal to n - k = 3. Therefore, that&#39;s consistent.But wait, let me check n=4, k=1. Original sequence 0000, deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with one 1. Original sequence 1111, deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with one 0. These are different sets, so participant can tell them apart, hence only 1 guess needed. But here n=4, k=1, which is not equal to n - k = 3, so again, it&#39;s 1 guess. So, seems like the only time when the participant can&#39;t distinguish is when k = n - k, i.e., when n is even and k = n/2. Therefore, in that case, they need to guess twice, otherwise once.Therefore, the answer should be 2 if n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses needed is 2 when n = 2k, and 1 otherwise. So, in terms of depending on n and k, it&#39;s 1 + [n = 2k], where [n = 2k] is 1 if true, 0 otherwise. Therefore, the minimal number is either 1 or 2, depending on whether n is twice k.But let me think again. Suppose n is even and k = n/2. Then, as in the example, the deputy&#39;s list is the same for a sequence and its complement. Therefore, the participant must guess both the sequence and its complement. But is that the only case when there&#39;s ambiguity?Suppose there&#39;s a different scenario where two different sequences (not complements) could produce the same deputy&#39;s list. For example, take n=4, k=1. Suppose original sequences 0000 and 0001. Wait, the deputy&#39;s list for 0000 is all sequences with one 1: 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000. The deputy&#39;s list for 0001 is all sequences differing at exactly one position: 0000, 0011, 0101, 1001. These are different sets. So, the deputy&#39;s list would differ. So, in this case, the participant can tell them apart.Another example: n=4, k=2. Original sequences 0000 and 0001. Deputy&#39;s list for 0000 is all sequences with two 1s. Deputy&#39;s list for 0001 is all sequences differing at exactly two positions. So, sequences that have two bits flipped from 0001. Let&#39;s compute: flipping any two bits. For example, flipping first and second: 1101; first and third: 1011; first and fourth: 1000; second and third: 0111; second and fourth: 0100; third and fourth: 0010. So, the deputy&#39;s list for 0001 would be 1101, 1011, 1000, 0111, 0100, 0010. Compare to deputy&#39;s list for 0000, which is all sequences with two 1s: 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100. These are different sets. So, even though k=2, which is n/2=2, but the original sequences are not complements. Wait, but in this case, the deputy&#39;s lists are different, so the participant could tell them apart.But when original sequences are complements, like 0000 and 1111, their deputy&#39;s lists are the same when k=2. For 0000, the deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with two 1s. For 1111, the deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with two 0s. But in n=4, sequences with two 0s are the same as sequences with two 1s when complemented. So, deputy&#39;s list for 0000 and 1111 is the same set. Therefore, the participant can&#39;t distinguish between 0000 and 1111. Thus, only in the case when the original sequences are complements, and k = n/2, do the deputy&#39;s lists coincide.Therefore, in general, the only ambiguity arises when there exists a pair of complementary sequences, and for such pairs, their deputy&#39;s lists coincide if and only if k = n/2. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses needed is 2 if and only if n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1.Therefore, the answer is that the participant needs to guess at minimum 2 times if n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1 time. So, in mathematical terms, the minimal number is 2 when n = 2k, and 1 otherwise. Therefore, the answer is boxed{1} if n ≠ 2k, and boxed{2} if n = 2k. However, since the problem asks for the minimal number of guesses depending on n and k, we need to write it in terms of n and k.Alternatively, if we need to write it as a single expression, we can use the indicator function. But in the problem statement, it says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}:&quot;. So, likely, the answer is 2 if n = 2k, else 1. But how to write this as a boxed expression. Maybe the answer is boxed{2} if n = 2k and boxed{1} otherwise. But since the problem says &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, and &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, perhaps they expect a formula. Alternatively, since the answer is 1 or 2, perhaps they want 1 + δ_{n,2k}, where δ is 1 if n=2k, else 0. But in boxed notation, perhaps the answer is simply:The minimal number of guesses is boxed{1} if ( n neq 2k ) and boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ).But the problem says &quot;How many times does he need to guess at minimum (depending on n and k) to ensure he guesses correctly at least once?&quot; So, the answer is either 1 or 2. However, the problem might expect a general formula. Wait, but perhaps in some cases more than two sequences could have the same deputy list. Wait, but in the previous analysis, we saw that only complementary sequences can produce the same deputy list when k = n/2, and otherwise, no. So, in the case of k = n/2, there are exactly two sequences (the original and its complement) that produce the same deputy list. Therefore, the participant needs to guess both. In all other cases, the deputy list uniquely identifies the original sequence. Therefore, the answer is 2 when n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1. Therefore, in boxed notation, perhaps:The minimal number of guesses is boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{n=2k}}}, where mathbf{1}_{n=2k} is an indicator function that is 1 if n=2k and 0 otherwise. But in standard math notation, we can write:boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ), and boxed{1} otherwise.However, the problem might require a single expression. Alternatively, the answer could be phrased as boxed{1 + lfloor frac{n}{2k} rfloor} or something else. But given the analysis, the answer is 1 or 2. Since in mathematical problems, especially in Olympiad-style problems, such answers are acceptable when conditional. So, the answer is either 1 or 2, depending on whether n is twice k. Therefore, the answer is boxed{2} when ( n = 2k ), and boxed{1} otherwise.But wait, let me check if there&#39;s another case where two different non-complementary sequences could have the same deputy list. Suppose n=4, k=2. Let&#39;s take two sequences that are not complements. Let&#39;s take 0000 and 0001. As before, deputy&#39;s list for 0000 is all sequences with two 1s. Deputy&#39;s list for 0001 is sequences differing in exactly two positions: flipping two bits. Which includes sequences like 1101, 1011, 1000, etc. These are different from the deputy&#39;s list of 0000. So, in this case, different lists. Therefore, only complements generate the same list. So, no other pairs.Therefore, only when k = n/2, and sequences are complements, deputy&#39;s lists coincide. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses is 2 in that case, else 1. Therefore, the answer is 2 if n = 2k, else 1. Hence, boxed appropriately.Final AnswerThe participant needs to guess at minimum boxed{1} time if ( n neq 2k ) and boxed{2} times if ( n = 2k ).However, since the problem asks for the answer in a single boxed expression depending on ( n ) and ( k ), and considering that in some competitions, answers requiring conditional expressions might need to be represented differently, but given the standard practice, if allowed, separate boxed answers are acceptable. Otherwise, if a unified expression is needed, it can be represented as:boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{{n=2k}}}}But since in Chinese and many other mathematical contexts, writing two boxed answers with conditions is acceptable, the answer is as above.But in the original problem statement from the Brazilian IMO, maybe the answer is simply 2 when n=2k and 1 otherwise, so the participant needs to guess 1 or 2 times. Hence, based on the analysis, the correct answer is:boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ), otherwise boxed{1}.But since the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, perhaps expecting a single box. Hmm. However, given that the answer depends on n and k, and the problem is presented in a way that requires specifying the minimal number in terms of n and k, it&#39;s likely that the answer is 2 when n=2k and 1 otherwise. However, in mathematical olympiads, such answers are often written with separate boxes for each case.Alternatively, the problem might be expecting the general formula. Let me think again.Wait, the problem says: &quot;How many times does he need to guess at minimum (depending on n and k) to ensure he guesses correctly at least once?&quot;So, the answer is a function of n and k. From the previous analysis, this function is 1 if n ≠ 2k and 2 if n = 2k. Therefore, the answer is:boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{n = 2k}}}Where mathbf{1}_{n=2k} is 1 if n=2k and 0 otherwise.But since LaTeX doesn&#39;t have an indicator function in the standard notation, perhaps written as:boxed{1 + delta_{n,2k}}}Where δ is the Kronecker delta. However, in Olympiad problems, typically such answers are written conditionally. So, given the user’s requirement to put the final answer in a single box, but the answer depends on n and k, perhaps the answer is:The minimal number of guesses required is boxed{2} when ( n = 2k ) and boxed{1} otherwise.But given the instructions, maybe the user expects just the two possible answers boxed. However, given that the problem states &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, it&#39;s expected to have a formula or expression in terms of n and k. However, since the answer is either 1 or 2, and there is no other possibility, the answer is presented as two boxed answers with conditions. But if the problem expects a single numerical value, it&#39;s not possible. However, given the problem&#39;s phrasing, it&#39;s acceptable to have two cases.But in the original problem statement, the answer is either 1 or 2. Therefore, writing both possibilities with their conditions is acceptable. Hence, the final answer is:boxed{1} if ( n neq 2k ) and boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ).Final AnswerThe participant needs to guess at least boxed{1} time if ( n neq 2k ) and boxed{2} times if ( n = 2k ).&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves a participant trying to guess the original binary sequence of length ( n ) after being shown all sequences that differ from the original sequence at exactly ( k ) positions. The key steps to determine the minimum number of guesses needed are as follows:1. Understanding the Deputy&#39;s List: The deputy generates all sequences at Hamming distance ( k ) from the original sequence. The participant needs to determine the original sequence from this list.2. Complementary Sequences: When ( k = frac{n}{2} ), the deputy&#39;s list for a sequence and its complement (flipping all bits) will be the same. This is because sequences with exactly ( k ) ones from the original sequence correspond to sequences with exactly ( k ) zeros (which is ( n - k ) ones) from the complement sequence. If ( n ) is even and ( k = frac{n}{2} ), these sets are identical.3. Uniqueness of Lists: For ( k neq frac{n}{2} ), the sets of sequences generated by different original sequences are unique. Therefore, the participant can uniquely determine the original sequence from the deputy&#39;s list.4. Conclusion: If ( n = 2k ), the participant must guess both the original sequence and its complement, requiring 2 guesses. Otherwise, the participant can uniquely determine the original sequence, requiring only 1 guess. Final AnswerThe participant needs to guess at least boxed{1} time if ( n neq 2k ) and boxed{2} times if ( n = 2k ).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here about the Brazilian IMO leader choosing two natural numbers n and k, where n is bigger than k. Then he tells these numbers to his deputy and a participant. The leader whispers a binary sequence of length n to the deputy, who then writes down all binary sequences of length n that differ from the leader&#39;s sequence at exactly k positions. The participant looks at these sequences and has to figure out the original sequence. The question is asking: what&#39;s the minimum number of guesses the participant needs to make to ensure they get the original sequence right at least once? And this minimum number should depend on n and k.Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem step by step. So, the deputy, upon receiving the original binary sequence, generates all sequences that are at Hamming distance k from it. The participant sees all these sequences and has to deduce the original one. But how exactly can the participant do that? The participant needs to determine which sequence is the original one, given that all the sequences they see are at distance k from it. Wait, but if the deputy writes down all sequences differing at exactly k positions, then the original sequence isn&#39;t among the ones the deputy writes, right? Because the deputy only writes sequences that differ at exactly k positions, so the original is different from all of them. So, the participant is looking at all these sequences at Hamming distance k from the original, and needs to figure out what the original is. So, the participant&#39;s goal is to compute the original sequence based on the list of sequences provided by the deputy. But the participant can only guess a certain number of times, and wants to minimize the number of guesses needed to be sure that at least one of them is correct.So, the participant has to look at all the sequences written by the deputy (which are all the sequences at Hamming distance k from the original) and then come up with a set of guesses such that the original sequence is in that set. The question is, what&#39;s the smallest possible size of such a set, depending on n and k.Alternatively, this is equivalent to asking: given a code where the codewords are all the sequences at Hamming distance k from the original, what&#39;s the minimal number of guesses needed such that the original sequence is among the guesses. So, in coding theory terms, maybe this relates to covering codes or something similar? Or maybe it&#39;s about the intersection of Hamming balls?Wait, let&#39;s think in terms of possible original sequences. Suppose the original sequence is s. The deputy reveals all sequences at distance k from s. The participant wants to find s. How can s be determined from the set of all sequences at distance k from s?But the problem is that multiple original sequences could potentially lead to the same set of sequences written by the deputy. Wait, no. If two different original sequences, say s and s&#39;, have the same set of sequences at distance k, then s and s&#39; would have to be such that every sequence at distance k from s is also at distance k from s&#39;, and vice versa. But is that possible?Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Let&#39;s say n=3, k=1. If the original sequence is 000, then the deputy writes down 001, 010, 100. If the original sequence is 111, the deputy writes down 110, 101, 011. These are different sets. If the original sequence is 101, as in the problem statement&#39;s example, the deputy writes down 001, 100, 111. So, different original sequences result in different sets. Therefore, the set of sequences written by the deputy uniquely determines the original sequence. Wait, but if that&#39;s the case, why does the participant need to guess multiple times? Maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem.Wait, the problem says: &quot;the participant looks at the sequences written down by the deputy. Now the participant tries to guess the original sequence from the leader. How many times does he need to guess at minimum (depending on n and k) to ensure he guesses correctly at least once?&quot;Wait, but if the set of sequences written by the deputy uniquely determines the original sequence, then the participant should be able to compute it exactly, right? So why would they need to guess more than once?But that contradicts the problem&#39;s premise, which is asking for the minimum number of guesses needed. Therefore, perhaps there&#39;s a misunderstanding here.Wait, perhaps the deputy doesn&#39;t write all the sequences differing at exactly k positions, but instead writes some of them? Wait, the problem says: &quot;the deputy writes down all binary sequences of length n that differ from the leader&#39;s sequence at exactly k positions.&quot; So, the deputy writes down all sequences at Hamming distance k from the original. Therefore, given that, the participant sees all these sequences. Then, from that, the participant must figure out the original.Wait, but how? If you have all the sequences at distance k from s, then s is the unique vector that is at distance n - k from all of them? Wait, no. Let&#39;s think. Each of the deputy&#39;s sequences is at distance k from s, so s is at distance n - k from each of them? Wait, Hamming distance is symmetric. If a sequence t is at distance k from s, then s is at distance k from t. So, perhaps s is the unique sequence that is at distance k from all the deputy&#39;s sequences? Wait, no. For example, take n=3, k=1. The deputy&#39;s sequences for s=101 are 001, 100, 111. Then s=101 is at distance 1 from each of these. But is there another sequence that is at distance 1 from each of 001, 100, 111?Let&#39;s check. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s another sequence x such that x is at distance 1 from 001, 100, and 111.First, x must differ from 001 by 1 bit. So x could be 000, 011, 101.Similarly, x must differ from 100 by 1 bit. So x could be 000, 110, 101.And x must differ from 111 by 1 bit. So x could be 011, 101, 110.Looking for x that is in all three sets. The intersection of {000, 011, 101}, {000, 110, 101}, and {011, 101, 110} is {101}. So, only 101 is in all three. Therefore, in this case, s is uniquely determined.But let&#39;s check another example. Suppose n=4, k=2. Let the original sequence be 0000. The deputy would write all sequences with exactly two 1s. Then, the participant sees all weight-2 sequences. But does this uniquely determine 0000? Let&#39;s see. Suppose the original was 1111, then the deputy would write all sequences with exactly two 0s, which are the weight-2 sequences in the complement. Wait, no. Wait, if the original is 1111, then the sequences differing at exactly two positions would be sequences with two 0s and two 1s. Wait, no. Wait, Hamming distance 2 from 1111 would be sequences that have exactly two 0s. Because changing two bits from 1 to 0 gives you two 0s. So the deputy would write all sequences with exactly two 0s. Whereas if the original was 0000, the deputy writes all sequences with exactly two 1s. These are different sets. Therefore, the original is uniquely determined.Wait, so maybe in general, given all the sequences at Hamming distance k from s, s is the unique sequence that is at Hamming distance n - k from all of them? Wait, no. Wait, if each of the deputy&#39;s sequences is at distance k from s, then s is at distance k from each of them, but there might be another sequence that is also at distance k from all the deputy&#39;s sequences. But in the previous example, that didn&#39;t happen. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps the set of all sequences at distance k from s uniquely determines s because the intersection of all the Hamming balls of radius k centered at each of the deputy&#39;s sequences is just {s}? But in the first example with n=3, k=1, the intersection was {s}. Is that always the case?Wait, let&#39;s see. Suppose we have a code where the deputy&#39;s sequences are all the codewords at distance k from s. Then the intersection of all the Hamming balls of radius k around each codeword would be the set of sequences that are at distance ≤k from every codeword. But since each codeword is at distance k from s, s is at distance k from each codeword. If another sequence s&#39; is at distance ≤k from each codeword, then s&#39; must be such that for each codeword t, d(s&#39;, t) ≤k. But each codeword t is at distance k from s, so by triangle inequality, d(s, s&#39;) ≤ d(s, t) + d(t, s&#39;) = k + d(t, s&#39;). Since d(t, s&#39;) ≤k, this gives d(s, s&#39;) ≤ 2k. But if k &lt; n/2, then perhaps s is uniquely determined? Wait, but this is getting a bit convoluted.Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of the dual problem. If the participant knows all the sequences at distance k from s, can they reconstruct s?In coding theory terms, the set of all vectors at distance k from s forms a code with minimum distance 2(n - k) or something? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Each pair of vectors in the deputy&#39;s list differ in some number of positions. For example, if two vectors are both at distance k from s, their distance from each other can range from |k - (n - k)| to 2k, depending on their overlap. Wait, perhaps not straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps the participant can use the concept of a parity check. If all the vectors written by the deputy are at distance k from s, then s is the only vector that is at distance k from all of them. Wait, but how?Wait, let&#39;s take another example. Suppose n=4, k=2. Let the original s be 0000. The deputy writes all vectors with exactly two 1s: 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100. Now, suppose there is another vector s&#39; such that all the deputy&#39;s vectors are at distance 2 from s&#39;. Let&#39;s see if such an s&#39; exists.Suppose s&#39; is 1111. Then the distance from s&#39; to each deputy&#39;s vector is 2 (since each deputy&#39;s vector has two 1s, so flipping two 1s to 0s would get to s&#39;). Wait, but 1111 is at distance 2 from each deputy&#39;s vector. So in this case, the participant sees all vectors with two 1s, and both 0000 and 1111 are at distance 2 from all of them. Therefore, the participant cannot uniquely determine s; it could be 0000 or 1111. Therefore, in this case, the participant would have to guess both possibilities to be sure. Therefore, in this case, the minimal number of guesses is 2.Wait, so here&#39;s a case where n=4, k=2, and the minimal number of guesses is 2. So the answer isn&#39;t always 1. Therefore, the participant sometimes needs to guess multiple times. Therefore, the problem is to figure out, depending on n and k, how many guesses are needed.So, in the n=4, k=2 case, the participant sees all weight-2 vectors, and the possible originals are 0000 and 1111, since both are at distance 2 from all weight-2 vectors. Wait, is that accurate? Wait, let&#39;s check. If s&#39; is 0000, then each weight-2 vector is at distance 2 from s&#39;. If s&#39; is 1111, then each weight-2 vector is at distance 2 from s&#39;, because you need to flip two 1s to 0s. Therefore, 0000 and 1111 are both centers of the set of weight-2 vectors. Therefore, the participant can&#39;t distinguish between them, so they have to guess both.Similarly, if the deputy wrote all vectors of weight k, then the original could be either all 0s or all 1s, depending on whether k is the number of 1s or 0s. Wait, no, in the case where n=4, k=2, the original is 0000, and the deputy writes all vectors with two 1s, but if the original was 1111, deputy would write all vectors with two 0s, which is a different set. Wait, no, in the problem statement, the deputy writes all sequences that differ from the leader&#39;s sequence at exactly k positions. So, if the leader&#39;s sequence is 0000, the deputy writes all sequences with exactly k 1s (assuming k is the number of differing positions, which are the 1s in this case). If the leader&#39;s sequence is 1111, the deputy writes all sequences with exactly k 0s. So, these are different sets unless k = n/2 and the sequences are complements. Wait, in n=4, k=2, the deputy&#39;s sequences for 0000 would be all sequences with two 1s, and for 1111 would be all sequences with two 0s. These are different sets. So, if the participant sees all sequences with two 1s, then the original must be 0000. If they see all sequences with two 0s, the original is 1111. But in our previous example, we thought that 0000 and 1111 both have distance 2 to all the deputy&#39;s sequences. Wait, but in reality, if the deputy&#39;s sequences are all sequences with two 1s, then the original is 0000, and 1111 is not a center of those. Wait, 1111 is at distance 2 from each of the deputy&#39;s sequences (since each has two 1s, so flipping two 1s to 0s gives 1111). But the deputy&#39;s sequences are at distance 2 from 0000, but also from 1111? Wait, but how?Wait, take a deputy&#39;s sequence, say 0011. The distance from 0011 to 0000 is 2 (flipping the two 1s). The distance from 0011 to 1111 is also 2 (flipping the two 0s). So, 0011 is at distance 2 from both 0000 and 1111. Similarly, all sequences with two 1s are at distance 2 from both 0000 and 1111. Therefore, if the deputy&#39;s list is all sequences with two 1s, the original could be 0000 or 1111. Wait, but in reality, if the leader&#39;s original sequence is 0000, the deputy writes all sequences with two 1s. If the original was 1111, the deputy would write all sequences with two 0s. Therefore, the deputy&#39;s list depends on the original. Therefore, the participant, upon seeing the deputy&#39;s list, can notice whether the list consists of sequences with two 1s or two 0s, and therefore know whether the original was 0000 or 1111. But in the problem statement, the leader tells n and k to both the deputy and the participant. Therefore, the participant knows n and k. If the participant sees that all sequences have weight k, then the original must be the all-0s sequence. If the participant sees that all sequences have weight n - k, then the original must be the all-1s sequence. Wait, but in this case, when the original is 0000, the deputy writes sequences with weight k. If the original is 1111, the deputy writes sequences with weight n - k. So, if the participant can determine the weight of the original, then they can know the original. But in the problem statement, does the participant know the original&#39;s weight? No, the participant only knows n and k. Wait, but if the deputy writes all sequences at Hamming distance k from the original, then the weight of those sequences depends on the original&#39;s weight. For example, if the original has weight w, then each sequence written by the deputy has weight w ± k (depending on whether the differing bits are 1s or 0s). But actually, the exact weight change isn&#39;t straightforward. For example, if the original is 0000 (weight 0), then the deputy&#39;s sequences have weight k. If the original is 0101 (weight 2), then the deputy&#39;s sequences can have weights varying from 2 - k + (number of 1s flipped to 0s) and 2 + (number of 0s flipped to 1s). Wait, but if k is fixed, then for a given original, the deputy&#39;s sequences can have different weights? For example, if the original is 0101 (n=4, k=1), then flipping a 0 to 1 gives a sequence of weight 3, flipping a 1 to 0 gives a sequence of weight 1. So the deputy&#39;s sequences have weights 1 and 3. Therefore, the deputy&#39;s sequences can have different weights. Therefore, the participant cannot in general determine the original&#39;s weight just from k. So maybe in some cases, the deputy&#39;s sequences have varying weights, and in other cases, fixed weights.Wait, so in the case where the original is all 0s or all 1s, then the deputy&#39;s sequences have fixed weight k or n - k. But in other cases, the deputy&#39;s sequences can have varying weights. Therefore, if the participant sees that all sequences have the same weight, then they can infer that the original was either all 0s or all 1s. Otherwise, the original must have mixed bits.Wait, but in the n=4, k=2 case, if the original is 0000, deputy writes sequences of weight 2. If the original is 0101, deputy writes sequences of weight 1, 3, or 2. Wait, no. Let&#39;s check. Original is 0101 (n=4, weight 2). Deputy needs to flip exactly 2 bits. So, flipping two 0s to 1s: original has two 0s, so flipping those gives weight 4; but original is 0101, so positions 1 and 3 are 0s. Flipping both gives 1101 and 0111 and 1111? Wait, no. Wait, the deputy flips exactly 2 bits, regardless of their original values. So from 0101, flipping any two bits. So, the possible results are:- Flip bits 1 and 2: 1001- Flip bits 1 and 3: 1101- Flip bits 1 and 4: 0100- Flip bits 2 and 3: 0011- Flip bits 2 and 4: 0001- Flip bits 3 and 4: 0110So these are the deputy&#39;s sequences. Their weights vary: 1001 (weight 2), 1101 (3), 0100 (1), 0011 (2), 0001 (1), 0110 (2). So weights are 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the participant, upon seeing sequences of weights 1, 2, 3, can infer that the original is not all 0s or all 1s, because in those cases, the deputy&#39;s sequences would all have weight k or n - k.Therefore, if the participant sees that all sequences have the same weight, then they can infer the original is all 0s or all 1s, and they need to guess both possibilities. If the sequences have varying weights, then the original is not all 0s or all 1s, and perhaps can be uniquely determined.Wait, but in the previous example where the original is 0101, the participant sees sequences with weights 1, 2, 3. How would the participant reconstruct the original? Maybe by finding a sequence that is at Hamming distance k from all the deputy&#39;s sequences. Wait, but if the participant has access to all the deputy&#39;s sequences, maybe they can compute the original by some kind of intersection.Wait, let me think. The original sequence s is the unique sequence such that all deputy&#39;s sequences are at distance k from s. So, if the participant can find all sequences s&#39; such that every deputy&#39;s sequence is at distance k from s&#39;, then the original must be among those s&#39;. The minimal number of guesses needed is the number of such s&#39;.So, in the n=4, k=2 example where the deputy&#39;s sequences are all weight-2 sequences, then the possible s&#39; would be 0000 and 1111, as each of them is at distance 2 from all weight-2 sequences. Therefore, the participant needs to guess both. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses is 2.In the case where the deputy&#39;s sequences have varying weights, like in the 0101 example, then the original is the only sequence at distance k from all of them, so the participant can guess just once.Therefore, the minimal number of guesses depends on whether the deputy&#39;s sequences all have the same weight or not. If they do, then the original could be all 0s or all 1s, so two guesses. If not, then only one guess is needed.But wait, in the problem statement, the deputy&#39;s sequences are all sequences at distance k from the original. So, the deputy&#39;s sequences can either all have the same weight (if the original is all 0s or all 1s) or varying weights (otherwise). Therefore, the participant can check if all sequences have the same weight. If they do, then the original is either all 0s or all 1s. If not, then there is only one possible original.But is this always true? Let&#39;s test another example.Take n=5, k=2. If the original is 00000, the deputy writes all sequences with two 1s. All those sequences have weight 2. So, participant sees all weight-2 sequences, and needs to guess 00000 or 11111? Wait, 11111 is at distance 5 from 00000. If deputy&#39;s sequences are all weight-2, then 00000 is at distance 2 from each, and 11111 is at distance 3 from each (since each has two 1s; 5 - 2 = 3). Wait, 11111 is at distance 3 from each deputy&#39;s sequence. Therefore, 11111 is not at distance 2 from the deputy&#39;s sequences. Therefore, in this case, if the deputy&#39;s sequences are all weight-2, then the original must be 00000, because 11111 is not at distance 2 from all weight-2 sequences.Wait, but if original is 00000, deputy&#39;s sequences are weight 2. If original is 11111, deputy&#39;s sequences are weight 3 (since flipping two 1s to 0s). Therefore, the deputy&#39;s sequences for 11111 have weight 3, so participant can distinguish between 00000 and 11111 by looking at the weights of the deputy&#39;s sequences. Therefore, if the participant sees all sequences of weight k, then the original is all 0s. If they see sequences of weight n - k, original is all 1s.Wait, but in the n=4, k=2 case, the deputy&#39;s sequences for all 0s are weight 2, and for all 1s are weight 2 as well (since n - k = 4 - 2 = 2). Therefore, in this case, deputy&#39;s sequences for all 0s and all 1s both result in sequences of weight 2. Wait, but flipping two bits in all 1s (1111) gives sequences with two 0s, which is weight 2. So, deputy&#39;s sequences for 1111 would be all sequences with two 0s, which is the same as all sequences with two 1s. Wait, no, sequences with two 0s are different from sequences with two 1s. For example, in n=4, the sequences with two 0s are 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100, which are the same as the sequences with two 1s. Wait, no. Wait, no, sequences with two 0s have weight n - 2, so in n=4, weight 2. But sequences with two 1s also have weight 2. Wait, but they are different sets. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in n=4, the set of sequences with two 0s is the same as the set of sequences with two 1s? No, that&#39;s not true. For example, 0011 has two 0s and two 1s. But if the original is 0000, deputy&#39;s sequences are sequences with two 1s (and two 0s). If the original is 1111, deputy&#39;s sequences are sequences with two 0s (and two 1s). So, these are different sets. Wait, but in n=4, the set of sequences with two 1s is the same as the set of sequences with two 0s? No, because 0011 has two 0s and two 1s. If the deputy&#39;s sequences for original 0000 are all sequences with two 1s (so positions where they differ from 0000 are 1s), then those sequences have exactly two 1s. Similarly, deputy&#39;s sequences for original 1111 are all sequences with two 0s (positions where they differ from 1111 are 0s), so those sequences have exactly two 0s. Therefore, in n=4, k=2, deputy&#39;s sequences for 0000 are all weight 2 sequences with two 1s, whereas for 1111, they are all weight 2 sequences with two 0s. These are different sets. However, the participant, upon seeing the deputy&#39;s sequences, can note that if all sequences have two 1s, the original is 0000; if all have two 0s, the original is 1111. Therefore, in this case, the participant can uniquely determine the original. But earlier, I thought that 0000 and 1111 were both possible. Wait, maybe my confusion arises from the fact that when you flip bits in 0000, you get sequences with 1s, while flipping bits in 1111 gives sequences with 0s. Therefore, the deputy&#39;s sequences are different, and the participant can tell whether the original was all 0s or all 1s by looking at the bits in the sequences. Therefore, in n=4, k=2, if the deputy&#39;s sequences are all sequences with two 1s, then the original is 0000; if they&#39;re all sequences with two 0s, original is 1111. Therefore, in that case, the participant can guess once. But earlier, I thought that in this case, 0000 and 1111 were both possible. Where is the mistake here?Ah, wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify. If the original is 0000, deputy writes all sequences with exactly two 1s. Each of these sequences is at Hamming distance 2 from 0000. If the original was 1111, deputy would write all sequences with exactly two 0s, which are different sequences. Therefore, the participant, upon seeing the deputy&#39;s list, can check if the sequences have 1s in the positions where they differ from the original or 0s. But the participant doesn&#39;t know the original. Wait, but the participant sees the actual sequences. If all sequences have two 1s, then the original must have been all 0s. If all sequences have two 0s, the original must have been all 1s. Therefore, the participant can actually determine the original uniquely in this case. Therefore, in the n=4, k=2 case, the participant can guess once. But earlier, when I considered s=0000, deputy&#39;s sequences are all weight 2 with two 1s, and s=1111 is at distance 2 from each of those sequences. Wait, let&#39;s check: take a deputy&#39;s sequence, say 0011. The distance from 0011 to 0000 is 2. The distance from 0011 to 1111 is also 2 (since 0011 has two 0s, flipping those gives 1111). Therefore, 0011 is at distance 2 from both 0000 and 1111. Therefore, both 0000 and 1111 are at distance 2 from all deputy&#39;s sequences. Therefore, if the deputy&#39;s sequences are all sequences with two 1s, then both 0000 and 1111 are centers. Wait, but deputy&#39;s sequences for 0000 are sequences with two 1s. Deputy&#39;s sequences for 1111 are sequences with two 0s. So, if the participant sees sequences with two 1s, then the original is 0000. If they see sequences with two 0s, original is 1111. But sequences with two 1s are different from sequences with two 0s. Wait, but in n=4, a sequence with two 1s is also a sequence with two 0s, right? Because n=4, two 1s implies two 0s. Wait, yes. For example, 0011 has two 1s and two 0s. So, in this case, the deputy&#39;s sequences for 0000 are all sequences with two 1s (which are also sequences with two 0s). Wait, but how does the participant know whether the deputy flipped 0s to 1s or 1s to 0s? They can&#39;t, because the participant doesn&#39;t know the original. Therefore, the participant sees sequences with two 1s and two 0s. But both 0000 and 1111 are at distance 2 from all those sequences. Therefore, the participant cannot distinguish between 0000 and 1111, so they have to guess both. Therefore, in this case, the minimal number of guesses is 2.Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me double-check. If the original is 0000, deputy writes all sequences with two 1s. Each of these sequences has two 1s and two 0s. The distance from 0000 to any of these is 2. The distance from 1111 to any of these is also 2, since 1111 has four 1s, and the deputy&#39;s sequence has two 1s, so the distance is 2. Therefore, both 0000 and 1111 are centers of the deputy&#39;s sequences. Therefore, the participant cannot determine whether the original was 0000 or 1111. Therefore, they have to guess both. Therefore, in n=4, k=2, the minimal number of guesses is 2.But then, how does the participant know whether the sequences are written by flipping 0s to 1s or 1s to 0s? They can&#39;t, because the sequences they see are just binary sequences; they don&#39;t know which bits were flipped. Therefore, in this case, the deputy&#39;s sequences are symmetric with respect to 0 and 1, so the participant cannot determine the original, and must guess both possibilities. Therefore, in this case, the minimal number of guesses is 2.Therefore, in general, when the deputy&#39;s sequences are all of weight k or all of weight n - k, then the participant must guess both all 0s and all 1s. Otherwise, if the deputy&#39;s sequences have varying weights, then the original is uniquely determined.But wait, in the example where n=3, k=1, original is 101. Deputy writes 001, 100, 111. These sequences have weights 1, 1, and 3. So varying weights. Therefore, the participant can uniquely determine the original. But in the case where the deputy&#39;s sequences all have weight k or n - k, then the original could be all 0s or all 1s.Wait, but how does the participant know whether the deputy&#39;s sequences all have the same weight? For example, in n=4, k=2, deputy&#39;s sequences all have weight 2, but that weight is both k and n - k (since n=4, k=2, so n - k = 2). Therefore, in this case, it&#39;s ambiguous. Therefore, the participant must consider both possibilities.So, in general, if k = n - k, i.e., n = 2k, then deputy&#39;s sequences for all 0s and all 1s both result in sequences of weight k. Therefore, in this case, the participant cannot distinguish between the two, and must guess both. However, if k ≠ n - k, then deputy&#39;s sequences for all 0s would have weight k, and for all 1s would have weight n - k. Since k ≠ n - k, the participant can look at the weight of the deputy&#39;s sequences. If they&#39;re all of weight k, original is all 0s. If they&#39;re all of weight n - k, original is all 1s. Therefore, in this case, the participant can guess once.But wait, in the n=4, k=2 case, deputy&#39;s sequences have weight 2, which is equal to n - k = 2. Therefore, it&#39;s the same. Therefore, the participant cannot determine whether the original was all 0s or all 1s, so they have to guess both. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses is 2 when n is even and k = n/2. Otherwise, if the deputy&#39;s sequences all have the same weight (either k or n - k), then the participant can guess once (either all 0s or all 1s). But wait, if k ≠ n - k, then deputy&#39;s sequences for all 0s would have weight k, and for all 1s would have weight n - k. So, for example, if n=5, k=2. If the original is all 0s, deputy&#39;s sequences have weight 2. If original is all 1s, deputy&#39;s sequences have weight 3. Therefore, the participant can look at the weight of the deputy&#39;s sequences. If they&#39;re all weight 2, guess all 0s. If all weight 3, guess all 1s. Therefore, only one guess is needed.But in the n=4, k=2 case, deputy&#39;s sequences have weight 2 regardless of whether the original was all 0s or all 1s. Therefore, the participant can&#39;t tell, so needs to guess both. Therefore, the key is whether k equals n - k. If yes (i.e., n even, k = n/2), then deputy&#39;s sequences for all 0s and all 1s are indistinguishable (same weight), so participant must guess both. Otherwise, if k ≠ n - k, then deputy&#39;s sequences will have different weights depending on the original, so participant can determine the original uniquely.But what if the original is not all 0s or all 1s? Then deputy&#39;s sequences will have varying weights, as in the n=3, k=1 example. In that case, the original is uniquely determined, so the participant can guess once. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses is 1 in all cases except when the original is all 0s or all 1s and k = n - k, in which case two guesses are needed. Wait, but how does the participant know whether the original is all 0s/all 1s or not? If the deputy&#39;s sequences have varying weights, the participant knows the original isn&#39;t all 0s or all 1s. If the deputy&#39;s sequences all have the same weight, then the original is either all 0s or all 1s, but depending on whether k = n - k, the participant might need to guess once or twice.So, putting it all together:- If the deputy&#39;s sequences all have the same weight (which happens if and only if the original is all 0s or all 1s):  - If k ≠ n - k, then the deputy&#39;s sequences have weight k or n - k, which are different. Therefore, the participant can determine whether the original was all 0s or all 1s by looking at the weight, and guess once.  - If k = n - k (i.e., n even and k = n/2), then the deputy&#39;s sequences have weight k, but both all 0s and all 1s produce deputy sequences of weight k. Therefore, the participant must guess both, requiring two guesses.- If the deputy&#39;s sequences have varying weights, then the original is uniquely determined, and the participant needs only one guess.Therefore, the minimal number of guesses needed is:- 2, if the original is either all 0s or all 1s and n = 2k.- 1, otherwise.But wait, how does the participant know whether the original is all 0s/all 1s or not? They can check if all deputy&#39;s sequences have the same weight. If they do, then the original is all 0s or all 1s. If not, original is something else. So, the participant can adaptively choose how many guesses to make based on the deputy&#39;s sequences. However, the problem says &quot;at minimum (depending on n and k) to ensure he guesses correctly at least once&quot;. So, the participant must choose a number of guesses that works no matter what the original sequence was. Therefore, the participant has to consider the worst-case scenario. Therefore, they need to prepare for the case where the original could be all 0s or all 1s when n = 2k, requiring two guesses. In all other cases, one guess suffices.Therefore, the minimal number of guesses needed is 2 if n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1. Wait, but is that true?Wait, let&#39;s consider n=4, k=2. As we saw, the participant must guess both all 0s and all 1s. So, in this case, the answer is 2. For n=5, k=2, the participant can determine the original uniquely if it&#39;s all 0s or all 1s, by looking at the weight of the deputy&#39;s sequences. If deputy&#39;s sequences are all weight 2, guess 00000. If all weight 3, guess 11111. If sequences have varying weights, then the original is neither all 0s nor all 1s, and can be uniquely determined. Therefore, only one guess is needed. Therefore, for n=5, k=2, the answer is 1.Similarly, n=6, k=3. Then deputy&#39;s sequences would have weight 3 if original is all 0s or all 1s. Therefore, participant can&#39;t distinguish, needs to guess both. Therefore, for n even and k = n/2, the answer is 2. Otherwise, 1.But wait, let&#39;s confirm with another example. Take n=2, k=1. If original is 00, deputy writes 01 and 10. These are weight 1. Participant sees sequences of weight 1. If original was 11, deputy writes 10 and 01, which are the same sequences. Therefore, participant can&#39;t tell if original was 00 or 11. Therefore, they need to guess both. Here, n=2, k=1, which is n=2k since k=1. Therefore, this aligns with the previous conclusion.Another example: n=3, k=1. If original is 000, deputy writes 001, 010, 100 (weight 1). If original is 111, deputy writes 110, 101, 011 (weight 2). These are different sets, so the participant can distinguish between them. Therefore, if the deputy&#39;s sequences are all weight 1, original is 000. If all weight 2, original is 111. Therefore, only one guess is needed. Since n=3 is odd, k=1 ≠ n - k = 2. Therefore, different weights, so participant can determine the original uniquely.Therefore, it seems the general rule is:If n is even and k = n/2, then the minimal number of guesses is 2. Otherwise, it&#39;s 1.Therefore, the answer is 2 when n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1. So, the minimal number of guesses is 1 + δ_{n,2k}, where δ is 1 if n=2k and 0 otherwise. But the problem states &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, so we need to express it as:The minimal number of guesses required is 2 if n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1. Therefore, the answer is boxed{2} when n is even and k = n/2, otherwise boxed{1}. However, the problem asks to present the answer depending on n and k, so we need a formula in terms of n and k.Wait, but the problem says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. So we need to write it in a boxed expression, likely using some function of n and k. The answer is either 1 or 2, depending on whether n = 2k. Therefore, the minimal number is 1 + [n = 2k], where [n=2k] is 1 if true, 0 otherwise. But in mathematical notation, we can use an indicator function. However, the problem might expect a piecewise function or a more combinatorial expression.Alternatively, the answer is 1 if n ≠ 2k, and 2 if n = 2k. Therefore, boxed answer would be boxed{1} if n ≠ 2k and boxed{2} if n = 2k. However, the problem says &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, and the answer should be given as a single expression. So perhaps we can write it using the indicator function as boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{n=2k}}}.But in the context of Olympiad problems, sometimes such answers are written as boxed{2} if n is even and k = n/2, otherwise boxed{1}. However, since the problem asks for the answer depending on n and k, perhaps we need to present it in terms of n and k. But in the original problem statement, the answer should be given as boxed{something} without conditions. Wait, no, actually, the problem says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, so perhaps the answer is 2 when n = 2k and 1 otherwise. So, to write it as boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{n=2k}}}.But in Olympiad solutions, typically, they might present it as boxed{2} if n = 2k and boxed{1} otherwise. However, since the problem is in Chinese, perhaps the answer is expected to be written in terms of binomial coefficients or something else. Wait, but based on the analysis, the answer is either 1 or 2, depending on whether n is twice k. Therefore, the answer is 2 when n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1.Alternatively, considering that when the original is all 0s or all 1s, the set of sequences written by the deputy forms a so-called &quot;constant-weight code&quot;. If this code is self-complementary (i.e., the set of sequences is the same when you flip all bits), then the participant cannot distinguish between the all 0s and all 1s. This happens exactly when the code is self-complementary, which occurs when the weight k is equal to n - k, i.e., k = n/2. Therefore, in that case, two guesses are needed. Otherwise, one guess suffices.Therefore, the minimal number of guesses is 2 if k = n/2, else 1. So, the answer is boxed{2} when n is even and k = n/2, and boxed{1} otherwise. But how to write this as a single expression? In mathematics, sometimes we use the Kronecker delta function, but in Olympiad contexts, they might accept a piecewise function. However, since the problem asks for the answer &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, and to &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, perhaps the answer is boxed{2} if n = 2k and boxed{1} otherwise. But the user instruction says to put the final answer within a single box. Maybe the problem expects the answer as the minimal number, which is 1 or 2 depending on the case, but in terms of n and k, it can be expressed as 1 + delta_{2k,n}, where δ is 1 if 2k = n, else 0. However, in boxed notation, perhaps:The minimal number of guesses is boxed{1} if ( n neq 2k ), and boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ).But the user might expect a single boxed answer. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: &quot;How many times does he need to guess at minimum (depending on n and k) to ensure he guesses correctly at least once?&quot; So the answer is a function of n and k, which is either 1 or 2. However, in the format requested, the user wants the answer within a single box. Maybe in terms of a piecewise function, but as per the guidelines, mathematical notation is allowed.Alternatively, since in the cases where n ≠ 2k, the answer is 1, and when n = 2k, it&#39;s 2. Therefore, the answer can be written as:boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{n = 2k}}But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s standard. Alternatively, in the problem&#39;s context, perhaps the answer is always 1 or 2, and the correct answer is 2 if n and k satisfy n = 2k, else 1. Therefore, based on the problem&#39;s examples and our analysis, the minimal number of guesses is 2 when n is twice k, and 1 otherwise. Therefore, the answer is:boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ), otherwise boxed{1}But the user might want a single answer. Wait, in Chinese IMO problems, sometimes such answers are written in terms of gcd or other functions, but I don&#39;t think so here. Given the analysis, the answer is 2 when n is even and k = n/2, else 1. Therefore, since the problem says &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, but we need to put the final answer in a box. Perhaps the answer is 2 when n=2k, otherwise 1, so expressed as:boxed{1 + lfloor frac{n}{2k} rfloor}But no, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Alternatively, since it&#39;s a yes/no condition, the answer is 1 + (1 if n=2k else 0). In LaTeX, using the cases notation:boxed{begin{cases}2 &amp; text{if } n = 2k, 1 &amp; text{otherwise}.end{cases}}But in the context of the problem and the requirement to put the answer within a single box, maybe the answer is simply boxed{1} or boxed{2} depending on the values of n and k. But since the problem says &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, perhaps the answer is represented as boxed{2} when n=2k and boxed{1} otherwise. However, the user likely expects the answer written as a function in a box, not as separate cases. In Olympiad problems, sometimes such answers are presented with a general formula, even if it&#39;s a simple piecewise function. Therefore, the standard way is to use the cases environment, but in the given format, since we can only put one box, perhaps the answer is written as:boxed{1 + delta_{2k,n}}But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s acceptable. Alternatively, since the answer is either 1 or 2, and it&#39;s 2 precisely when n is twice k, then we can write it as boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{{n=2k}}}}, where mathbf{1} is the indicator function. But again, not sure if standard. Alternatively, given the problem is about the minimal number of guesses, and given that when n=2k, the participant needs two guesses, else one, then the answer is:boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{n=2k}}}But I think in the context of Olympiad problems, if the answer depends on a condition, it&#39;s acceptable to write it using a cases environment even within a single box. However, in the given instruction, the user might expect the answer written as either 1 or 2, but since it&#39;s dependent on n and k, it must be expressed in terms of n and k. Given the analysis, the answer is 2 when n is even and k = n/2, otherwise 1. Therefore, expressed as:The minimal number of guesses is boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ), otherwise boxed{1}.But the problem says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, so perhaps the answer is presented as two boxed numbers with conditions. However, given the way the question is phrased, it&#39;s likely expecting an answer of either 1 or 2, but since it&#39;s dependent on n and k, it must be a general formula. However, from the problem&#39;s examples and our analysis, the answer is 1 except when n=2k, where it&#39;s 2. Therefore, the answer is 2 when n=2k, 1 otherwise. Therefore, the boxed answer should be expressed as:boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{{n = 2k}}}But since this might not be standard, and given that the problem allows for the answer to be dependent on n and k, which could be written in words, but the user might prefer a numerical value. However, considering that in the problem statement&#39;s example (n=3, k=1), the correct answer would be 1, and in the n=4, k=2 case, the answer is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2 when n=2k, else 1. Therefore, the answer is:boxed{2} when ( n = 2k ) and boxed{1} otherwise.But since the problem asks for the answer &quot;depending on n and k&quot;, and the user wants it in a box, the answer is either 1 or 2. However, since the problem requires a single answer, perhaps the answer is presented with a piecewise function inside the box, which is possible using LaTeX&#39;s cases environment. Therefore, the answer is:boxed{begin{cases}2 &amp; text{if } n = 2k, 1 &amp; text{otherwise}.end{cases}}Yes, this seems appropriate. Therefore, the minimal number of guesses needed is 2 if n equals twice k, and 1 otherwise. This covers all cases, as we&#39;ve analyzed through examples.Final AnswerThe minimum number of guesses required is boxed{2} if ( n = 2k ) and boxed{1} otherwise. However, due to the formatting constraint, we present it as:boxed{ begin{cases} 2 &amp; text{if } n = 2k,  1 &amp; text{otherwise}. end{cases} }But according to the problem&#39;s instruction to put the final answer within a single box without LaTeX cases, the answer is either 1 or 2. Given the problem&#39;s dependence on n and k, and following the user&#39;s requirement to present the answer in a box, the correct approach is to state both possibilities. However, since the answer must be in a single box, the most precise answer considering the problem&#39;s constraints is:boxed{1 + mathbf{1}_{{n = 2k}}}}But recognizing that this might not be standard, and given the previous examples in the problem statement, the intended answer is likely either 1 or 2 based on the condition. However, to adhere strictly to the instruction and provide a single boxed answer that encapsulates both cases, the answer is presented as a piecewise function within a single box using LaTeX&#39;s cases environment.Final Answerboxed{ begin{cases} 2 &amp; text{if } n = 2k,  1 &amp; text{otherwise} end{cases} }&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves determining the minimum number of guesses a participant needs to make to ensure they correctly guess the original binary sequence chosen by the Brazilian IMO leader. The leader provides two natural numbers ( n ) and ( k ) (with ( n &gt; k )), and the deputy writes down all binary sequences of length ( n ) that differ from the leader&#39;s sequence at exactly ( k ) positions. The participant must guess the original sequence based on these sequences.Key steps and reasoning:1. Understanding the Deputy&#39;s Output: The deputy writes down all sequences at Hamming distance ( k ) from the original sequence. This set of sequences can either have varying weights or a fixed weight depending on the original sequence.2. Weight Analysis: If the original sequence is all 0s or all 1s, the deputy&#39;s sequences will have a fixed weight (either ( k ) or ( n - k )). If the original sequence is mixed, the deputy&#39;s sequences will have varying weights.3. Uniqueness of Original Sequence: When the deputy&#39;s sequences have varying weights, the original sequence can be uniquely determined. However, if the deputy&#39;s sequences have a fixed weight, the participant needs to consider whether ( n = 2k ).4. Special Case ( n = 2k ): When ( n ) is even and ( k = n/2 ), the deputy&#39;s sequences for both all 0s and all 1s will have the same weight, making it impossible to distinguish between them. Thus, two guesses are needed.5. General Case: For other values of ( n ) and ( k ), the original sequence can be uniquely determined if the deputy&#39;s sequences have varying weights or the participant can infer the original sequence based on the fixed weight.Conclusion:- If ( n = 2k ), the participant needs to guess both all 0s and all 1s, requiring 2 guesses.- Otherwise, the participant can determine the original sequence uniquely, requiring 1 guess.Final Answer:[boxed{ begin{cases} 2 &amp; text{if } n = 2k,  1 &amp; text{otherwise} end{cases} }]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ca8eb55e></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>🔑:</span>Remark: A binary sequence of length n is a sequence of length n that consists only of 0 and 1.Solution: If we consider a fixed position in the solution sequence L, then binom{n-1}{k} of the listed sequences match L at this position, and binom{n-1}{k-1} of the listed sequences differ from L at this position. Since the participant knows n and k, they can also calculate these values. Additionally, they can count how many of the listed sequences have a 0 or a 1 at this position and thus determine whether L has a 0 or a 1 at this position, provided that binom{n-1}{k} neq binom{n-1}{k-1}. They can do this for every position, so the solution sequence is unique for them, and they need only one guess.If binom{n-1}{k} = binom{n-1}{k-1}, then n-k = k, so k = frac{n}{2}. In this case, it is easy to see that the solution sequence generates the same list as its exact opposite L^{-1} (if all 0s are replaced by 1s and vice versa): Every sequence on the list of L differs from L at half of the positions, so it differs from L^{-1} at the other half of the positions and thus also appears on the list of L^{-1}. By symmetry, this also holds in reverse. Therefore, the lists of L and L^{-1} are indistinguishable, and the number of guesses required is at least 2. We now show that there can be no other sequence that generates the same list. Then the participant can eliminate all other possibilities by writing down all possible solutions and does not need to guess more than twice.For this, the participant guesses the first number of the sequence, WLOG a 0 (since both L and L^{-1} are solutions, this will certainly lead to a possible solution). Then they strike out all left(begin{array}{c}n-1  kend{array}right) sequences that start with a 1 and strike out the 0 at the first position in all others. What remains (assuming the 0 was correct) are all sequences of length n-1 where k entries have been changed. Since k neq frac{n-1}{2}, the solution is now unique for the participant according to the first case. The case with 1 works completely analogously. Therefore, there can be no other solutions.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-bcb74a31 data-v-ca8eb55e><div class="review" data-v-ca8eb55e><div class="review-title" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>❓:</span>2.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what a horizontal asymptote is. From what I remember, a horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of a function approaches as x tends to positive or negative infinity. So, first things first, I should figure out what the horizontal asymptote of this function is.The function is a rational function, meaning it&#39;s a ratio of two polynomials. The numerator is 2x³ + x + 1 and the denominator is x³ + 1. To find the horizontal asymptote, I need to compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. Both the numerator and the denominator are degree 3 polynomials. When the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of their leading coefficients. The leading term of the numerator is 2x³, and the leading term of the denominator is x³. So, the ratio of the leading coefficients is 2/1, which is 2. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 2. Let me double-check that. If I divide both numerator and denominator by x³, the highest power, the function becomes (2 + x⁻² + x⁻³)/(1 + x⁻³). As x approaches infinity, the terms with negative exponents go to zero, so it approaches (2 + 0 + 0)/(1 + 0) = 2/1 = 2. Yep, that seems right. So the horizontal asymptote is y = 2.Now, the question is asking where the graph of f(x) intersects this horizontal asymptote. That means I need to find the x-values where f(x) = 2. So, set up the equation:(2x³ + x + 1)/(x³ + 1) = 2To solve this equation, I can multiply both sides by the denominator to eliminate the fraction. Let&#39;s do that:2x³ + x + 1 = 2(x³ + 1)Expanding the right side:2x³ + x + 1 = 2x³ + 2Now, subtract 2x³ from both sides:(2x³ - 2x³) + x + 1 = 2Which simplifies to:x + 1 = 2Then, subtract 1 from both sides:x = 1So, x = 1 is the solution. Let me check if this is valid. Plugging x = 1 back into the original function f(x):f(1) = (2(1)³ + 1 + 1)/(1³ + 1) = (2 + 1 + 1)/(1 + 1) = 4/2 = 2Yes, that works. So the point of intersection is at x = 1, y = 2. Therefore, the graph intersects its horizontal asymptote at the point (1, 2).Wait, but let me make sure there aren&#39;t any other solutions. When I solved the equation, I ended up with x = 1. Let me check if there could be any other x-values that satisfy f(x) = 2. Let&#39;s see:Starting again from the equation:(2x³ + x + 1)/(x³ + 1) = 2Multiply both sides by (x³ + 1):2x³ + x + 1 = 2x³ + 2Subtract 2x³ from both sides:x + 1 = 2So, x = 1. There&#39;s no quadratic term or anything else here. The equation reduces to x = 1. So, that&#39;s the only solution. Therefore, there&#39;s only one intersection point at x = 1.But let me consider if there&#39;s a case where the denominator x³ + 1 could be zero, which would make the original function undefined. The denominator x³ + 1 factors as (x + 1)(x² - x + 1). Setting that equal to zero, x + 1 = 0 gives x = -1, and the quadratic x² - x + 1 = 0 has discriminant (-1)² - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3, which is negative, so no real roots there. Therefore, the function is undefined at x = -1. But our solution x = 1 is not equal to -1, so x = 1 is a valid point in the domain of f(x). So, that&#39;s okay.Therefore, the only intersection point is (1, 2). I think that&#39;s it.Final AnswerThe intersection point is boxed{(1, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the intersection of the graph of the function ( f(x) = frac{2x^3 + x + 1}{x^3 + 1} ) with its horizontal asymptote, we first identify the horizontal asymptote. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are both 3, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients, which is ( y = 2 ).Next, we find the x-values where ( f(x) = 2 ):[frac{2x^3 + x + 1}{x^3 + 1} = 2]Multiplying both sides by ( x^3 + 1 ):[2x^3 + x + 1 = 2(x^3 + 1)]Expanding and simplifying:[2x^3 + x + 1 = 2x^3 + 2]Subtracting ( 2x^3 ) from both sides:[x + 1 = 2]Solving for ( x ):[x = 1]We verify by substituting ( x = 1 ) back into the original function:[f(1) = frac{2(1)^3 + 1 + 1}{(1)^3 + 1} = frac{4}{2} = 2]Thus, the graph intersects its horizontal asymptote at ( (1, 2) ).[boxed{(1, 2)}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the intersection of the graph of the function f(x) = (2x³ + x + 1)/(x³ + 1) with its horizontal asymptote. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a horizontal asymptote is. A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of a function approaches as x tends to plus or minus infinity. For rational functions like this one, where the numerator and denominator are both polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator.In this case, the numerator is 2x³ + x + 1, which is a third-degree polynomial, and the denominator is x³ + 1, also a third-degree polynomial. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote should be the ratio of their leading coefficients. The leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1. So, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 2/1, which is y = 2. Let me confirm that. Yes, when the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. So, y = 2 is the horizontal asymptote.Now, the problem is asking where the graph of f(x) intersects this horizontal asymptote. That means we need to find the x-values where f(x) = 2. So, I need to solve the equation (2x³ + x + 1)/(x³ + 1) = 2. Let me set up that equation and solve for x.Starting with:(2x³ + x + 1)/(x³ + 1) = 2Multiply both sides by (x³ + 1) to eliminate the denominator:2x³ + x + 1 = 2(x³ + 1)Let me expand the right-hand side:2x³ + x + 1 = 2x³ + 2Now, subtract 2x³ from both sides:(2x³ - 2x³) + x + 1 = 2Which simplifies to:x + 1 = 2Then, subtract 1 from both sides:x = 1So, the solution is x = 1. Therefore, the graph intersects its horizontal asymptote at x = 1. Let me verify this by plugging x = 1 back into f(x) to ensure that f(1) equals 2.Calculating f(1):Numerator: 2(1)³ + 1 + 1 = 2*1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4Denominator: (1)³ + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2So, f(1) = 4/2 = 2. That checks out. Therefore, the point of intersection is at x = 1, which gives the point (1, 2). But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other solutions. When I set up the equation (2x³ + x + 1)/(x³ + 1) = 2, and then cross-multiplied, I got x = 1. Let me make sure that there are no other solutions. Let&#39;s see.After cross-multiplying, we had:2x³ + x + 1 = 2x³ + 2Subtracting 2x³ from both sides gives x + 1 = 2, which leads to x = 1. So, there&#39;s only one solution here. There&#39;s no x³ term left, so we don&#39;t have to solve a higher-degree equation. Therefore, x = 1 is the only solution.Is there a possibility that x³ + 1 could be zero, leading to division by zero? Let&#39;s check if x = -1 is a solution. But when x = -1, the denominator becomes (-1)³ + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0, which would make the function undefined. So, x = -1 is a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the function is undefined there, so we don&#39;t have to consider x = -1 here. So, x = 1 is the only point where the graph intersects the horizontal asymptote.Therefore, the intersection is at x = 1. To write the point, it&#39;s (1, 2). But the problem says &quot;Determine the intersection,&quot; which might just ask for the x-value or the point. Since it&#39;s a point, the coordinates would be (1, 2). But let me check if the problem specifies how to present the answer. The original problem says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. Typically, for intersections, if it&#39;s a point, you might write it as an ordered pair. However, since horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines, maybe they just want the x-coordinate? Wait, no. The intersection of the graph with its horizontal asymptote would be a point where both the x and y satisfy both equations. So, since the horizontal asymptote is y = 2, the intersection point is where f(x) = 2, which we found x = 1, so the point is (1, 2).But let me confirm once more. Let&#39;s see: horizontal asymptote is y = 2, so any intersection point would have a y-coordinate of 2. Solving f(x) = 2 gives x = 1. So, the point is (1, 2). Therefore, the answer is (1, 2). But depending on the problem&#39;s requirement, sometimes they just ask for the x-value, but since it&#39;s an intersection point, probably the coordinates.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects multiple points? But in this case, solving the equation gives only x = 1. Let me check with another x-value. Suppose x is very large, like approaching infinity. Then f(x) approaches 2, but never actually reaches 2 except at x = 1. So, x = 1 is the only point where it crosses the asymptote.Therefore, the intersection is at the point (1, 2). So, the answer should be boxed{(1, 2)}. Yeah, that seems right.Final AnswerThe intersection of the graph of ( f(x) ) with its horizontal asymptote is boxed{(1, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the intersection of the graph of the function ( f(x) = frac{2x^3 + x + 1}{x^3 + 1} ) with its horizontal asymptote, we start by identifying the horizontal asymptote.

The horizontal asymptote of the given function is y=2. To find the intersection, we need to equate f(x) with the asymptote. We get the equation frac{2 x^{3}+x+1}{x^{3}+1}=2.

It&#39;s a bit complex, but I&#39;ll take it one piece at a time. First, let&#39;s parse the problem statement again to make sure I understand all the given information and what needs to be found.We have triangle ABC. There&#39;s a circle Ω with radius √3. This circle touches sides BC and AC at points K and L, respectively. So, Ω is tangent to BC at K and tangent to AC at L. Then, the circle intersects side AB at points M and N, with M between A and N. It&#39;s given that segment MK is parallel to AC. Additionally, we know that KC = 1 and AL = 6. We need to find:1. The measure of angle ACB (denoted as ∠ACB).2. The length of segment MK.3. The length of segment AB.4. The area of triangle CMN.Alright, let&#39;s start by drawing a rough sketch of triangle ABC based on the given information. Since the circle touches BC and AC, it&#39;s tangent to those sides, so K and L are points of tangency. The circle intersects AB at M and N, with M closer to A. Also, MK is parallel to AC. Let&#39;s note the given lengths: KC = 1 and AL = 6.First, perhaps it&#39;s helpful to recall that the radius of a circle tangent to two sides of a triangle will lie along the angle bisector of the angle formed by those two sides. However, in this case, the circle is tangent to BC and AC, which meet at point C. Therefore, the center of the circle Ω must lie along the angle bisector of angle C. Wait, is that true? Hmm.Wait, if a circle is tangent to two sides of a triangle, its center lies along the angle bisector of the angle formed by those two sides. So, since Ω is tangent to BC and AC, the center O of Ω must lie on the angle bisector of ∠ACB. Therefore, the incenter of triangle ABC lies on that angle bisector, but Ω isn&#39;t necessarily the incircle—it&#39;s another circle tangent to BC and AC but intersecting AB. So, it&#39;s an ex-circle or some other circle.But given that it&#39;s tangent to BC and AC, which meet at C, so the center is along the angle bisector of angle C. Let me note that. The center O is somewhere along the bisector of angle C. The radius is √3. Also, the points of tangency are K on BC and L on AC. So, the distances from O to BC and AC are equal to the radius, √3. Therefore, the lengths from O to BC and AC are both √3.Given that, perhaps we can model coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up coordinates. Let&#39;s place point C at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Let’s assume that side AC lies along the x-axis, so point A is somewhere along the positive x-axis, and point B is somewhere in the plane. Then, point L is the point of tangency on AC, so since AL = 6, then if we denote the length of AC as, say, b, then L is 6 units away from A. Therefore, if AC = b, then LC = b - 6. Similarly, KC = 1, which is the length from point K to C on BC. So, if BC is of length a, then BK = a - 1.But maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let&#39;s try to assign coordinates.Let’s set point C at (0, 0). Let’s place AC along the x-axis, so point A is at (c, 0) for some c &gt; 6 (since AL = 6, so L is 6 units from A, meaning L is at (c - 6, 0)). Then, point B is somewhere in the plane; let&#39;s denote its coordinates as (d, e). Then, side BC is from (0, 0) to (d, e), and side AB is from (c, 0) to (d, e). The circle Ω is tangent to BC at K and AC at L, with radius √3. The center O of Ω must lie along the angle bisector of angle C, which in our coordinate system is the line y = x tan(θ/2), where θ is angle ACB. Wait, but since AC is along the x-axis and BC is in the plane, the angle bisector of angle C would be a line making equal angles with AC and BC. Hmm, maybe coordinate geometry is getting complicated here. Alternatively, maybe using coordinate system with point C at (0,0), AC along x-axis, and BC along some line.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s better to use coordinate system with point C at (0,0), AC along the x-axis, so point A is (a, 0), and point B is (0, b) so that BC is along the y-axis. Wait, but if we set BC along the y-axis, then AC is along the x-axis, and angle C is the right angle. But the problem doesn&#39;t state that triangle ABC is right-angled, so we can&#39;t assume that. Therefore, maybe a better approach is needed.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the properties of the circle tangent to two sides. The center O lies along the angle bisector of angle C, and the distance from O to each of those sides is equal to the radius, √3. So, in triangle ABC, the distance from point O to AC and BC is √3. Therefore, if we can find the coordinates of O, perhaps we can find the angle at C.Wait, but since we know AL = 6 and KC = 1, maybe we can relate these lengths to the coordinates. Let&#39;s try.Let’s set up coordinates:- Let’s place point C at (0, 0).- Let’s place AC along the x-axis, so point A is at (c, 0), where c = AC.- Point L is on AC, 6 units from A, so L is at (c - 6, 0).- The circle is tangent to AC at L, so the center O of the circle must lie along the line perpendicular to AC at L. Since AC is horizontal, the perpendicular is vertical. Therefore, the center O has coordinates (c - 6, √3) because the radius is √3. Wait, is that correct?Wait, if the circle is tangent to AC at L, then the radius OL is perpendicular to AC. Since AC is horizontal, OL must be vertical. Therefore, O is located either above or below AC at (c - 6, √3) or (c - 6, -√3). But since the circle also touches BC, which is another side of the triangle. Assuming the triangle is above the x-axis, the center should be above AC. So, O is at (c - 6, √3).Similarly, the circle is tangent to BC at K. The radius OK is perpendicular to BC. Let&#39;s find the coordinates of K. Since K is on BC, and OK is perpendicular to BC. Let’s find the equation of BC.But we need more information. Let&#39;s note that KC = 1. Since point C is at (0, 0), then K is 1 unit away from C along BC. If we denote point B as (p, q), then BC is the line from (0, 0) to (p, q), and K is the point 1 unit away from C along BC. The coordinates of K can be determined parametrically. The direction vector of BC is (p, q), so the unit vector in the direction of BC is (p/√(p² + q²), q/√(p² + q²)). Therefore, moving 1 unit from C along BC, point K is at (p/√(p² + q²), q/√(p² + q²)). However, since KC = 1, this would be the case. But we need to connect this with the circle being tangent to BC at K.Since the center O is at (c - 6, √3), and the radius is √3, the distance from O to BC must be equal to the radius, which is √3. The distance from point O to line BC is equal to √3. Also, since K is the point of tangency on BC, the line OK is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, the distance from O to BC is the length of OK, which is √3. Let me formalize this. Let’s denote coordinates:- C: (0, 0)- A: (c, 0)- L: (c - 6, 0)- O: (c - 6, √3)- B: (p, q)- K: (k_x, k_y) on BC such that KC = 1. So, K is 1 unit away from C along BC.Since K is on BC, which goes from C(0,0) to B(p, q), the parametric coordinates of K can be written as (tp, tq), where t is a parameter between 0 and 1. The distance from C to K is 1, so:√[(tp)^2 + (tq)^2] = 1 ⇒ t√(p² + q²) = 1 ⇒ t = 1/√(p² + q²)Therefore, K is at (p/√(p² + q²), q/√(p² + q²)).Now, the center O is at (c - 6, √3). The line BC has equation qx - py = 0 (since it passes through (0,0) and (p, q)). The distance from O to BC is |q(c - 6) - p(√3)| / √(p² + q²) = √3 (since the radius is √3). Therefore:|q(c - 6) - p√3| / √(p² + q²) = √3Multiplying both sides by √(p² + q²):|q(c - 6) - p√3| = √3 * √(p² + q²)Squaring both sides:[q(c - 6) - p√3]^2 = 3(p² + q²)Expanding the left side:q²(c - 6)^2 - 2pq(c - 6)√3 + 3p² = 3p² + 3q²Simplify:q²(c - 6)^2 - 2pq(c - 6)√3 + 3p² - 3p² - 3q² = 0Simplify term by term:q²[(c - 6)^2 - 3] - 2pq(c - 6)√3 = 0So,q²[(c - 6)^2 - 3] = 2pq(c - 6)√3Divide both sides by q (assuming q ≠ 0, which it can&#39;t be since B is not on the x-axis):q[(c - 6)^2 - 3] = 2p(c - 6)√3Let’s note this equation as (1).Additionally, since K is the point of tangency on BC, the line OK is perpendicular to BC. The slope of BC is q/p, so the slope of OK is -p/q. The coordinates of O are (c - 6, √3), and K is (p/√(p² + q²), q/√(p² + q²)). Therefore, the slope of OK is [√3 - q/√(p² + q²)] / [c - 6 - p/√(p² + q²)].This slope should be equal to -p/q.So,[√3 - q/√(p² + q²)] / [c - 6 - p/√(p² + q²)] = -p/qCross-multiplying:q[√3 - q/√(p² + q²)] = -p[c - 6 - p/√(p² + q²)]Let’s denote s = √(p² + q²) for simplicity. Then, the equation becomes:q[√3 - q/s] = -p[c - 6 - p/s]Multiply out:q√3 - q²/s = -p(c - 6) + p²/sBring all terms to one side:q√3 - q²/s + p(c - 6) - p²/s = 0Factor out 1/s:q√3 + p(c - 6) - (q² + p²)/s = 0But s = √(p² + q²), so (q² + p²)/s = s. Therefore:q√3 + p(c - 6) - s = 0But s = √(p² + q²). Therefore:q√3 + p(c - 6) - √(p² + q²) = 0This is another equation involving p, q, c. Let&#39;s denote this as equation (2).Now, we have equations (1) and (2):From equation (1):q[(c - 6)^2 - 3] = 2p(c - 6)√3From equation (2):q√3 + p(c - 6) - √(p² + q²) = 0This seems complicated, but maybe we can express q in terms of p from equation (1) and substitute into equation (2).From equation (1):q = [2p(c - 6)√3] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3]Let’s denote this as q = kp, where k = [2(c - 6)√3] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3]Therefore, q = kp. Let&#39;s substitute this into equation (2):kp * √3 + p(c - 6) - √(p² + (kp)^2) = 0Factor out p:p[ k√3 + (c - 6) ] - p√(1 + k²) = 0Assuming p ≠ 0 (which it can&#39;t be, since B is not on the y-axis):k√3 + (c - 6) - √(1 + k²) = 0Now, substitute k from earlier:k = [2(c - 6)√3] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3]So,[2(c - 6)√3 / ((c - 6)^2 - 3)] * √3 + (c - 6) - √[1 + ( [2(c - 6)√3 / ((c - 6)^2 - 3)] )² ] = 0Simplify term by term:First term:[2(c - 6)√3 * √3] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3] = [2(c - 6)*3] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3] = [6(c - 6)] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3]Second term: (c - 6)Third term: √[1 + ( [2(c - 6)√3 / ((c - 6)^2 - 3)] )² ]Let’s compute the third term:Inside the square root:1 + [4(c - 6)^2 * 3] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3]^2 = 1 + [12(c - 6)^2] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3]^2Combine terms:= [ ( (c - 6)^2 - 3 )^2 + 12(c - 6)^2 ] / [ (c - 6)^2 - 3 ]^2Let’s expand the numerator:Let’s denote t = (c - 6)^2 for simplicity.Then numerator becomes:(t - 3)^2 + 12t = t² - 6t + 9 + 12t = t² + 6t + 9 = (t + 3)^2So, the third term is √[ (t + 3)^2 / (t - 3)^2 ] = (t + 3)/|t - 3|Since t = (c - 6)^2 ≥ 0, and the denominator is t - 3. Depending on whether t &gt; 3 or t &lt; 3, the absolute value would change. But since the original circle has radius √3, and the center is at (c - 6, √3), the distance from O to AC is √3, which is the radius, so that&#39;s consistent. The position along the angle bisector might require t &gt; 3? Not sure. Let&#39;s proceed.Therefore, the third term is (t + 3)/|t - 3|. Since t = (c - 6)^2, which is non-negative. If t &gt; 3, then |t - 3| = t - 3; if t &lt; 3, |t - 3| = 3 - t. Let&#39;s see. But perhaps t must be greater than 3, because the denominator in k is (c - 6)^2 - 3 = t - 3. Since k is defined as [2(c - 6)√3] / [(c - 6)^2 - 3], we must have (c - 6)^2 ≠ 3, and if (c - 6)^2 - 3 is in the denominator, to avoid division by zero. Moreover, if (c - 6)^2 - 3 = 0, then t = 3, which would make the denominator zero. So, (c - 6)^2 ≠ 3. Also, given that AL = 6, and AL is along AC, which is of length c (since AC is from (0,0) to (c, 0)), so c must be greater than 6. Therefore, (c - 6) is positive. So, t = (c - 6)^2 is positive, but we need to see if t &gt; 3 or t &lt; 3.But since the center O is located at (c - 6, √3), if (c - 6)^2 - 3 is positive, then the denominator in k is positive. Let&#39;s suppose t &gt; 3, so (c - 6)^2 &gt; 3. Therefore, |t - 3| = t - 3, so the third term is (t + 3)/(t - 3). So, putting back into the equation:First term: [6(c - 6)] / (t - 3) = [6(c - 6)] / ((c - 6)^2 - 3)Second term: (c - 6)Third term: (t + 3)/(t - 3) = ((c - 6)^2 + 3)/ ((c - 6)^2 - 3)So the equation becomes:[6(c - 6)] / ((c - 6)^2 - 3) + (c - 6) - ((c - 6)^2 + 3)/ ((c - 6)^2 - 3) = 0Combine the terms over a common denominator ((c - 6)^2 - 3):[6(c - 6) + (c - 6)((c - 6)^2 - 3) - ((c - 6)^2 + 3)] / ((c - 6)^2 - 3) = 0Therefore, the numerator must be zero:6(c - 6) + (c - 6)((c - 6)^2 - 3) - ((c - 6)^2 + 3) = 0Let’s factor out (c - 6) from the first two terms:(c - 6)[6 + (c - 6)^2 - 3] - ((c - 6)^2 + 3) = 0Simplify inside the brackets:6 + (c - 6)^2 - 3 = (c - 6)^2 + 3Therefore:(c - 6)[(c - 6)^2 + 3] - ((c - 6)^2 + 3) = 0Factor out ((c - 6)^2 + 3):[(c - 6) - 1]((c - 6)^2 + 3) = 0So, either (c - 6 - 1) = 0 ⇒ c - 7 = 0 ⇒ c = 7, or ((c - 6)^2 + 3) = 0. The latter is impossible since squares are non-negative, so ((c - 6)^2 + 3) ≥ 3 &gt; 0. Therefore, the only solution is c = 7.Therefore, AC = c = 7. Then, point A is at (7, 0), point L is at (7 - 6, 0) = (1, 0). So, AL = 6, which checks out. Now that we know c = 7, we can find p and q. Recall from equation (1):q[(c - 6)^2 - 3] = 2p(c - 6)√3Substitute c = 7:q[(7 - 6)^2 - 3] = 2p(7 - 6)√3 ⇒ q[1 - 3] = 2p(1)√3 ⇒ -2q = 2p√3 ⇒ -q = p√3 ⇒ q = -p√3But since B is a point in the plane, and we&#39;ve set up the coordinate system with C at (0,0), A at (7,0). If q = -p√3, then point B has coordinates (p, -p√3). However, since K is on BC and KC = 1, let&#39;s check if this makes sense.First, let&#39;s note that BC is the line from (0,0) to (p, -p√3). The length of BC is √(p² + ( - p√3 )² ) = √(p² + 3p²) = √(4p²) = 2|p|. Since KC = 1, which is the distance from C to K along BC, and since BC has length 2|p|, then KC = 1 implies that 2|p| ≥ 1. But K is 1 unit from C, so the coordinates of K can be found by moving 1 unit along BC from C.Parametrize BC: from (0,0) to (p, -p√3). The unit vector in the direction of BC is (p/(2p), -p√3/(2p)) = (1/2, -√3/2). Therefore, moving 1 unit from C, point K is at (1/2, -√3/2). Wait, but coordinates of K should be (1/2, -√3/2). However, since in our coordinate system, the center O is at (c - 6, √3) = (1, √3). Let&#39;s check if the distance from O to BC is √3.Coordinates of O: (1, √3). Coordinates of BC: from (0,0) to (p, -p√3). Let&#39;s compute the distance from O to BC.The line BC can be parametrized as x = pt, y = -p√3 t for t ∈ [0,1]. Alternatively, its equation is y = (-√3)x, since from (0,0) to (p, -p√3), the slope is (-p√3)/p = -√3. Therefore, the equation of BC is y = -√3 x.The distance from O(1, √3) to the line BC (y + √3 x = 0) is |√3 + √3 * 1| / √( (√3)^2 + 1^2 ) = |2√3| / √(4) = 2√3 / 2 = √3. Which matches the radius. Good.So, the distance is indeed √3, which is consistent. Therefore, our previous calculations seem correct.Now, since point K is (1/2, -√3/2), since moving 1 unit along BC from C(0,0), as per the unit vector. Let&#39;s verify that OK is perpendicular to BC and has length √3.Coordinates of O: (1, √3), coordinates of K: (1/2, -√3/2). The vector OK is (1/2 - 1, -√3/2 - √3) = (-1/2, - (3√3)/2 ). The slope of OK is [ - (3√3)/2 ] / [ -1/2 ] = 3√3. The slope of BC is -√3. The product of these slopes is 3√3 * (-√3) = -9, which is not -1, which would be required for perpendicularity. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Did I make a mistake here?Wait, maybe my parametrization is incorrect. Wait, if BC is from (0,0) to (p, -p√3) and we move 1 unit from C along BC, then since the length of BC is 2|p|, and KC = 1, then t = 1/(2|p|). Therefore, coordinates of K are (p/(2|p|), -p√3/(2|p|)). If p is positive, then K is (1/2, -√3/2). If p is negative, K would be (-1/2, √3/2). However, in our case, since q = -p√3, and point B is (p, q), we can assume p is positive (since if p is negative, then q would be positive, but let&#39;s see). Wait, if p is positive, then q = -p√3 is negative, so point B is in the fourth quadrant. If p is negative, then q is positive, so point B is in the second quadrant. However, the triangle ABC has sides AC, BC, AB. If point B is in the fourth quadrant, then the triangle is below the x-axis. If point B is in the second quadrant, the triangle is above the x-axis. But the circle Ω is tangent to BC and AC, and intersects AB at M and N. Given that MK is parallel to AC, which is along the x-axis, so MK is horizontal. If point B is in the fourth quadrant, then AB would go from (7,0) to (p, -p√3), which is in the fourth quadrant. The circle with center at (1, √3) would be above the x-axis, but intersects AB, which is going downward. It&#39;s possible, but maybe it&#39;s more likely that B is in the second quadrant? Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the orientation. Let&#39;s check both possibilities.Wait, but earlier, when we found q = -p√3, from equation (1), we have q = -p√3. So, if p is positive, q is negative; if p is negative, q is positive. Let&#39;s suppose p is positive for now. Then, coordinates of K are (1/2, -√3/2). Then, the vector OK is from O(1, √3) to K(1/2, -√3/2): (-1/2, - (3√3)/2). The direction vector of BC is (p, q) = (p, -p√3) = p(1, -√3). The direction vector of BC is (1, -√3). The vector OK is (-1/2, - (3√3)/2 ). Let&#39;s check if OK is perpendicular to BC. The dot product should be zero.Dot product of OK and BC direction vector:(-1/2)(1) + (-3√3/2)(-√3) = -1/2 + (3√3 * √3)/2 = -1/2 + (9)/2 = (-1 + 9)/2 = 8/2 = 4 ≠ 0So, they are not perpendicular, which contradicts the fact that OK should be perpendicular to BC as the radius at the point of tangency. This suggests a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, how did we get here? Let&#39;s retrace.We set up coordinates with C at (0,0), A at (7,0), L at (1,0), center O at (1, √3). Then, we found that B is at (p, -p√3) such that q = -p√3. Then, K is 1 unit from C along BC, which is along the line from (0,0) to (p, -p√3). If the length of BC is 2|p|, then moving 1 unit along BC from C would reach K at (p/(2p), -p√3/(2p)) = (1/2, -√3/2) assuming p &gt; 0. However, the vector OK is from (1, √3) to (1/2, -√3/2), which is (-1/2, - (3√3)/2). The direction vector of BC is (1, -√3). The dot product between OK and BC direction vector is (-1/2)(1) + (-3√3/2)(-√3) = -1/2 + (9/2) = 4, which is not zero. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Which means our assumption must be wrong.Where did we go wrong? Let&#39;s check the equations again.We had equation (1): q[(c - 6)^2 - 3] = 2p(c - 6)√3. With c = 7, this became q[1 - 3] = 2p(1)√3 ⇒ -2q = 2p√3 ⇒ q = -p√3. So that&#39;s correct.Equation (2) led us to c = 7, which seems correct. Then, substituting into equation (2), we have:q√3 + p(c - 6) - √(p² + q²) = 0With c = 7, q = -p√3:(-p√3)√3 + p(1) - √(p² + 3p²) = 0Simplify:-3p + p - √(4p²) = 0 ⇒ (-2p) - 2|p| = 0If p &gt; 0:-2p - 2p = -4p = 0 ⇒ p = 0, which contradicts p ≠ 0.If p &lt; 0:-2p - 2(-p) = -2p + 2p = 0 ⇒ 0 = 0, which is always true.Therefore, p must be negative. So, p is negative. Therefore, point B is at (p, q) = (p, -p√3) with p &lt; 0. Therefore, q = -p√3 is positive since p is negative. So, point B is in the second quadrant. Then, length of BC is 2|p|. Since p is negative, |p| = -p. Therefore, BC has length 2*(-p). Since KC = 1, which is 1 unit along BC from C, then t = 1/(BC length) = 1/(2*(-p)). Therefore, coordinates of K are (p/(2*(-p)), q/(2*(-p))) = (-1/2, (-p√3)/( -2p )) = (-1/2, (√3)/2). So, K is at (-1/2, √3/2). Now, check if OK is perpendicular to BC.Coordinates of O: (1, √3). Coordinates of K: (-1/2, √3/2). Vector OK is (-1/2 - 1, √3/2 - √3) = (-3/2, -√3/2). The direction vector of BC is (p, q) = (p, -p√3). Since p is negative, let&#39;s take p = -k where k &gt; 0. Then, direction vector is (-k, k√3). The slope of BC is (k√3)/(-k) = -√3, same as before. The slope of OK is (-√3/2)/(-3/2) = (√3)/3. The slope of BC is -√3. The product of these slopes is (√3/3)*(-√3) = -3/3 = -1. Therefore, they are perpendicular. Great! So that works out.Therefore, point B is at (p, q) = (p, -p√3) with p &lt; 0. Let’s denote p = -k where k &gt; 0. Then, B is at (-k, k√3). Then, BC has length 2k, and since KC = 1, then 2k must be ≥ 1. But in our case, K is 1 unit from C, so BC must be at least 1 unit long, which it is. Specifically, BC has length 2k, and K is 1 unit from C, so moving 1 unit along BC from C, which is length 1, so t = 1/(2k), so coordinates of K are (-k/(2k), k√3/(2k)) = (-1/2, √3/2), as we found earlier.Now, we can find k. Wait, how?Wait, we have point B at (-k, k√3). Then, side AB is from A(7, 0) to B(-k, k√3). The circle Ω with center O(1, √3) and radius √3 intersects AB at points M and N. Also, segment MK is parallel to AC, which is along the x-axis. Therefore, MK is horizontal. Since M is between A and N on AB, we need to find the coordinates of M and K such that MK is horizontal.Given that K is at (-1/2, √3/2), and MK is horizontal, meaning that M must have the same y-coordinate as K, which is √3/2. Therefore, point M is on AB such that its y-coordinate is √3/2. Let&#39;s find the coordinates of M.First, parametrize AB. Point A is (7, 0), point B is (-k, k√3). Let’s write the parametric equations for AB. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1, with t=0 at A and t=1 at B.The coordinates of a general point on AB are:x = 7 + t*(-k - 7) = 7 - t(k + 7)y = 0 + t*(k√3 - 0) = t k√3We need to find t such that y = √3/2.So:t k√3 = √3/2 ⇒ t = 1/(2k)Therefore, coordinates of M are:x = 7 - (1/(2k))(k + 7) = 7 - ( (k + 7)/(2k) ) = 7 - (1/2 + 7/(2k)) = 7 - 1/2 - 7/(2k) = 13/2 - 7/(2k)y = √3/2Therefore, M is at (13/2 - 7/(2k), √3/2)But we also know that M lies on the circle Ω. The circle has center O(1, √3) and radius √3. Therefore, the equation of Ω is (x - 1)^2 + (y - √3)^2 = 3Substitute the coordinates of M into this equation:[ (13/2 - 7/(2k) - 1 )^2 + ( √3/2 - √3 )^2 ] = 3Simplify:First term inside the square:13/2 - 7/(2k) - 1 = 13/2 - 2/2 - 7/(2k) = 11/2 - 7/(2k)Second term:√3/2 - √3 = -√3/2Therefore, the equation becomes:[ (11/2 - 7/(2k) )^2 + ( -√3/2 )^2 ] = 3Calculate each part:First part squared:(11/2 - 7/(2k))^2 = ( (11k - 7)/2k )^2 = ( (11k - 7)^2 ) / (4k² )Second part squared:( -√3/2 )^2 = 3/4Therefore:[ ( (11k - 7)^2 ) / (4k² ) ) + 3/4 ] = 3Multiply both sides by 4k²:(11k - 7)^2 + 3k² = 12k²Expand (11k - 7)^2:121k² - 154k + 49 + 3k² = 12k²Combine terms:121k² + 3k² - 154k + 49 = 12k²124k² - 154k + 49 = 12k²Subtract 12k²:112k² - 154k + 49 = 0Divide equation by 7:16k² - 22k + 7 = 0Solve quadratic equation:k = [22 ± √(484 - 448)] / 32 = [22 ± √36]/32 = [22 ± 6]/32So, two solutions:k = (22 + 6)/32 = 28/32 = 7/8k = (22 - 6)/32 = 16/32 = 1/2So, k = 7/8 or k = 1/2. Now, we need to check which of these is valid.Recall that point B is at (-k, k√3). Since k &gt; 0, both solutions are valid, but we need to see which one fits with the rest of the problem. Let&#39;s check both possibilities.First, k = 7/8:Then, point B is at (-7/8, (7/8)√3 )Length of BC is 2k = 2*(7/8) = 7/4. But earlier, KC = 1, which should be less than or equal to BC length. Since BC length is 7/4 ≈ 1.75, which is greater than 1, so that&#39;s okay.Second, k = 1/2:Point B is at (-1/2, (1/2)√3 )Length of BC is 2*(1/2) = 1. But KC is given as 1, which would mean K is at point B, but in our case, K is at (-1/2, √3/2), which is different from B(-1/2, (1/2)√3). Wait, if BC has length 1 and K is 1 unit from C, then K coincides with B. But in the problem statement, K is a point where the circle is tangent to BC. If K coincides with B, then the circle is tangent to BC at B, but in the problem, the circle also intersects AB at M and N, which are distinct from B. However, if K is at B, then the circle is tangent at B and intersects AB at M and N, but since B is already on AB, it might not make sense. Therefore, k = 1/2 would lead to K coinciding with B, which is not possible as per the problem statement. Therefore, k = 1/2 is invalid. Therefore, the correct solution is k = 7/8.Therefore, k = 7/8, so point B is at (-7/8, (7/8)√3 )Now, we can find all required quantities.First, let&#39;s find angle ACB. In triangle ABC, angle at C. Points A(7,0), B(-7/8, (7/8)√3), C(0,0). To find angle at C, we can use the dot product formula.Vectors CA and CB:Vector CA = A - C = (7,0) - (0,0) = (7,0)Vector CB = B - C = (-7/8, (7/8)√3 )The angle between vectors CA and CB is angle ACB.Dot product: CA ⋅ CB = 7*(-7/8) + 0*(7/8√3) = -49/8Magnitude of CA: |CA| = √(7² + 0²) = 7Magnitude of CB: |CB| = √[ (-7/8)^2 + (7/8√3)^2 ] = √[ 49/64 + 49*3/64 ] = √[ 49/64 + 147/64 ] = √[196/64] = √[49/16] = 7/4Therefore, cos(angle ACB) = (CA ⋅ CB) / (|CA||CB|) ) = (-49/8) / (7 * 7/4) ) = (-49/8) / (49/4) ) = (-49/8) * (4/49) ) = -1/2Therefore, angle ACB = arccos(-1/2) = 120 degrees or 2π/3 radians.So, the measure of angle ACB is 120°, which is 2π/3 radians.Next, we need to find the length of MK. Points M and K: K is at (-1/2, √3/2), and M is on AB with coordinates (13/2 - 7/(2k), √3/2). We found k = 7/8, so substituting k = 7/8:x-coordinate of M:13/2 - 7/(2*(7/8)) = 13/2 - 7/(14/8) = 13/2 - 7*(8/14) = 13/2 - 4 = 13/2 - 8/2 = 5/2Therefore, M is at (5/2, √3/2)Point K is at (-1/2, √3/2)Therefore, MK is the distance between (5/2, √3/2) and (-1/2, √3/2). Since the y-coordinates are the same, the distance is the difference in x-coordinates:5/2 - (-1/2) = 5/2 + 1/2 = 6/2 = 3Therefore, MK = 3 units.Next, we need to find the length of AB. Points A(7,0) and B(-7/8, (7/8)√3). The distance between them:AB = √[ (7 - (-7/8))² + (0 - (7/8)√3 )² ] = √[ (63/8)² + ( -7√3/8 )² ]Calculate:(63/8)^2 = (3969/64)(7√3/8)^2 = (49*3)/64 = 147/64Sum: 3969/64 + 147/64 = 4116/64 = 1029/16Therefore, AB = √(1029/16) = (√1029)/4But 1029 factors: 1029 ÷ 3 = 343, 343 is 7³. So, 1029 = 3 × 7³. Therefore, √1029 = √(3 × 7³) = 7√(21). Therefore, AB = 7√21 / 4Alternatively, 7√21 divided by 4. So, AB = (7√21)/4Finally, we need to find the area of triangle CMN. Points C(0,0), M(5/2, √3/2), and N. But we need to find point N. Since the circle intersects AB at M and N, with M between A and N. So, N is the other intersection point of circle Ω with AB. Since we parametrized AB earlier, let&#39;s find the parameter t for point N.We found t for point M was t = 1/(2k) = 1/(2*(7/8)) = 4/7. Wait, since earlier, when finding point M, we had:t = 1/(2k) = 1/(2*(7/8)) = 4/7. Therefore, t = 4/7 for point M, so point N corresponds to another t value. Since the circle intersects AB at two points, M and N. Since the circle equation is (x - 1)^2 + (y - √3)^2 = 3, and AB is parametrized as x = 7 - t(k + 7), y = t k√3. Substituting into the circle equation, we can find the two values of t.But we already found t = 4/7 corresponds to point M. Let&#39;s find the other solution.Given k = 7/8, parametrize AB:x = 7 - t( (7/8) + 7 ) = 7 - t( 7/8 + 56/8 ) = 7 - t(63/8 )y = t*(7/8)*√3Substitute into circle equation:( x - 1 )^2 + ( y - √3 )^2 = 3Substitute x and y:[7 - (63/8)t - 1]^2 + [ (7√3/8)t - √3 ]^2 = 3Simplify:[6 - (63/8)t]^2 + [ (7√3/8 t - √3 ) ]^2 = 3First term:6 - (63/8)t = (48/8 - 63/8)t = (-15/8)t + 48/8 = (-15t/8 + 6)Wait, no. Wait, 7 - (63/8)t - 1 = 6 - (63/8)t. Therefore:[6 - (63/8)t]^2 = [ (48/8 - 63/8)t + 6 ]? Wait, no. Let me compute directly.First term squared:(6 - (63/8)t)^2 = 36 - 2*6*(63/8)t + (63/8)^2 t² = 36 - (756/8)t + (3969/64)t² = 36 - (189/2)t + (3969/64)t²Second term:( (7√3/8)t - √3 ) = √3(7/8 t - 1 )Therefore, squared:3*(7/8 t - 1)^2 = 3*(49/64 t² - 14/8 t + 1 ) = 3*(49/64 t² - 7/4 t + 1 ) = 147/64 t² - 21/4 t + 3Sum of both terms:36 - (189/2)t + (3969/64)t² + 147/64 t² - 21/4 t + 3 = 3Combine like terms:t² terms: (3969 + 147)/64 t² = 4116/64 t² = 1029/16 t²t terms: -189/2 t - 21/4 t = - (378/4 + 21/4 )t = -399/4 tConstants: 36 + 3 = 39Therefore:1029/16 t² - 399/4 t + 39 = 3Subtract 3:1029/16 t² - 399/4 t + 36 = 0Multiply equation by 16 to eliminate denominators:1029 t² - 1596 t + 576 = 0Divide by 3:343 t² - 532 t + 192 = 0Now, solve for t:t = [532 ± √(532² - 4*343*192)] / (2*343)Compute discriminant:532² = (500 + 32)^2 = 500² + 2*500*32 + 32² = 250000 + 32000 + 1024 = 2830244*343*192 = 4*343*192 = 4*65856 = 263424Discriminant = 283024 - 263424 = 19600 = 140²Therefore:t = [532 ± 140]/686Compute:t = (532 + 140)/686 = 672/686 = 96/98 = 48/49t = (532 - 140)/686 = 392/686 = 56/98 = 28/49 = 4/7Therefore, the solutions are t = 48/49 and t = 4/7. We already knew t = 4/7 corresponds to point M. Therefore, point N corresponds to t = 48/49.Therefore, coordinates of N:x = 7 - (63/8)*(48/49) = 7 - (63*48)/(8*49) = 7 - (63*6)/49 = 7 - 378/49 = 7 - 7.714... = Let&#39;s compute more precisely:63*48 = 30248*49 = 3923024/392 = 7.714285...7 - 3024/392 = 7 - 7.714285... = -0.714285...But as a fraction:7 is 343/49, so 343/49 - 378/49 = (-35)/49 = -5/7Wait, let&#39;s do it step by step:x = 7 - (63/8)*(48/49) = 7 - ( (63/49)*(48/8) ) = 7 - ( (9/7)*(6) ) = 7 - 54/7 = (49 - 54)/7 = (-5)/7Similarly, y-coordinate:y = (7√3/8)*(48/49) = (7√3/8)*(48/49) = (√3/8)*(48/7) = (√3/8)*(48/7) = (6√3)/7Therefore, point N is at (-5/7, 6√3/7 )Now, we have points C(0,0), M(5/2, √3/2 ), and N(-5/7, 6√3/7 ). We need to find the area of triangle CMN.To find the area of triangle given three vertices, we can use the shoelace formula.Coordinates:C(0,0), M(5/2, √3/2 ), N(-5/7, 6√3/7 )Shoelace formula:Area = 1/2 | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |Substitute:x1 = 0, y1 = 0x2 = 5/2, y2 = √3/2x3 = -5/7, y3 = 6√3/7Compute:0*(√3/2 - 6√3/7) + (5/2)*(6√3/7 - 0) + (-5/7)*(0 - √3/2 )= 0 + (5/2)*(6√3/7) + (-5/7)*(-√3/2 )= (30√3)/14 + (5√3)/14= (30√3 + 5√3)/14= 35√3 /14= 5√3 / 2Therefore, the area of triangle CMN is (5√3)/2.Alternatively, we can compute vectors and take the cross product. But the shoelace formula gives the same result.Let me verify once more:Alternatively, vectors CM and CN.Point C is (0,0), so vectors:CM = (5/2, √3/2 )CN = (-5/7, 6√3/7 )Area = 1/2 | CM × CN | = 1/2 | (5/2)(6√3/7) - (√3/2)(-5/7) | = 1/2 | (30√3/14) + (5√3/14) | = 1/2 | 35√3 /14 | = 1/2 * 35√3 /14 = 35√3 /28 = 5√3 /4. Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, which one is correct?Wait, no. The cross product formula is correct, but let&#39;s compute again:CM × CN is (5/2)(6√3/7) - (-5/7)(√3/2) = (30√3)/14 + (5√3)/14 = 35√3/14 = 5√3/2Then, area is 1/2 * 5√3/2 = 5√3/4. Wait, no. Wait, no, the cross product magnitude is already the area of the parallelogram, so the area of the triangle is half of that. But in 2D, the magnitude of the cross product of vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 y2 - x2 y1|, and the area of the triangle is half of that.Wait, so:Area = 1/2 | x1 y2 - x2 y1 | = 1/2 | (5/2)(6√3/7) - (-5/7)(√3/2) | = 1/2 | (30√3)/14 + 5√3/14 | = 1/2 | 35√3/14 | = 1/2 * (35√3/14) = 35√3 /28 = 5√3 /4But this contradicts the shoelace formula result. Which is correct?Wait, let&#39;s recalculate the shoelace formula:Coordinates:C(0,0), M(5/2, √3/2 ), N(-5/7, 6√3/7 )Applying the formula:Area = 1/2 |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|Substituting:1/2 | 0*(√3/2 - 6√3/7) + (5/2)*(6√3/7 - 0) + (-5/7)*(0 - √3/2) |= 1/2 |0 + (5/2)*(6√3/7) + (-5/7)*(-√3/2)|= 1/2 | (30√3)/14 + (5√3)/14 |= 1/2 | 35√3/14 |= 1/2 * (35√3/14 )= 35√3/28= 5√3/4Yes, so shoelace formula also gives 5√3/4. Earlier, I must have made a mistake in transcribing the formula. So the correct area is 5√3/4.Wait, that contradicts my initial shoelace calculation. Wait, let&#39;s check again.Wait, no. The shoelace formula says:Area = 1/2 |sum|Where the sum is:0*(√3/2 - 6√3/7) + (5/2)*(6√3/7 - 0) + (-5/7)*(0 - √3/2 )First term: 0*(... ) = 0Second term: (5/2)*(6√3/7) = 30√3/14Third term: (-5/7)*(-√3/2 ) = 5√3/14Sum: 30√3/14 + 5√3/14 = 35√3/14 = 5√3/2Multiply by 1/2: 5√3/4Yes, that&#39;s correct. So the area is 5√3/4. Therefore, the correct area is 5√3/4. So, previously, my initial shoelace calculation was correct, but I miscalculated the cross product. However, both methods give 5√3/4. Therefore, the area of triangle CMN is 5√3/4.Therefore, summarizing the results:1. Angle ACB = 120° or 2π/3 radians.2. Length of MK = 3.3. Length of AB = 7√21/4.4. Area of triangle CMN = 5√3/4.Let me check if these make sense.First, angle ACB is 120°, which is an obtuse angle. Given the coordinates of points A, B, C, and the positions of the circle, this seems plausible.Length of MK is 3. Since MK is parallel to AC (which is along the x-axis), and MK is horizontal. Given the coordinates of M(5/2, √3/2) and K(-1/2, √3/2), the distance is indeed 5/2 - (-1/2) = 3, which is correct.Length of AB is 7√21/4. Given the distance between A(7,0) and B(-7/8, 7√3/8), the calculation leads to √[(63/8)^2 + (7√3/8)^2] = √[(3969 + 147)/64] = √[4116/64] = √[1029/16] = √1029/4 = 7√21/4. Correct.Area of triangle CMN: 5√3/4. Given the coordinates, the calculation via both shoelace and cross product methods confirm this. Therefore, the final answers are:1. ∠ACB = 120° = 2π/3 radians.2. MK = 3.3. AB = 7√21/4.4. Area of triangle CMN = 5√3/4.Final AnswerThe measure of angle ACB is boxed{120^circ}, the length of segment MK is boxed{3}, the length of segment AB is boxed{dfrac{7sqrt{21}}{4}}, and the area of triangle CMN is boxed{dfrac{5sqrt{3}}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given triangle (ABC) with a circle (Omega) of radius (sqrt{3}) tangent to sides (BC) and (AC) at points (K) and (L) respectively, and intersecting (AB) at points (M) and (N) (with (M) between (A) and (N)). It is given that (MK parallel AC), (KC = 1), and (AL = 6). We need to find (angle ACB), the lengths of (MK) and (AB), and the area of triangle (CMN).1. Finding (angle ACB):   - Place (C) at ((0, 0)), (A) at ((7, 0)) (since (AL = 6)), and (L) at ((1, 0)).   - The center (O) of (Omega) is at ((1, sqrt{3})) as it lies on the angle bisector of (angle ACB) and is (sqrt{3}) units from (AC).   - Using coordinates and the dot product, vectors (CA = (7, 0)) and (CB = (-7/8, 7sqrt{3}/8)) give (cos(angle ACB) = -1/2), leading to (angle ACB = 120^circ).2. Length of (MK):   - (M) is found on (AB) with (y)-coordinate (sqrt{3}/2) (same as (K)).   - Coordinates of (M) are ((5/2, sqrt{3}/2)) and (K) are ((-1/2, sqrt{3}/2)).   - Distance (MK = 5/2 - (-1/2) = 3).3. Length of (AB):   - Distance between (A(7, 0)) and (B(-7/8, 7sqrt{3}/8)):   [   AB = sqrt{left(7 + frac{7}{8}right)^2 + left(0 - frac{7sqrt{3}}{8}right)^2} = frac{7sqrt{21}}{4}   ]4. Area of triangle (CMN):   - Coordinates of (N) found using the circle equation and parametric form of (AB), leading to (N(-5/7, 6sqrt{3}/7)).   - Using the shoelace formula for (C(0, 0)), (M(5/2, sqrt{3}/2)), (N(-5/7, 6sqrt{3}/7)):   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| 0 + frac{30sqrt{3}}{14} + frac{5sqrt{3}}{14} right| = frac{5sqrt{3}}{4}   ] Final AnswerThe measure of angle ( angle ACB ) is ( boxed{120^circ} ), the length of segment ( MK ) is ( boxed{3} ), the length of segment ( AB ) is ( boxed{dfrac{7sqrt{21}}{4}} ), and the area of triangle ( CMN ) is ( boxed{dfrac{5sqrt{3}}{4}} ).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ca8eb55e></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ca8eb55e><span class="icon" data-v-ca8eb55e>🔑:</span>Answer: angle A C B=frac{2 pi}{3}, M K=3, A B=frac{7 sqrt{21}}{4}, S_{triangle C M N}=frac{5 sqrt{3}}{4}.Solution. Let the center of the circle be denoted as O, the foot of the altitude from vertex C of the triangle as H, and the angle B A C as alpha.Since the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent, operatorname{to} operatorname{tg} angle O C K= frac{O K}{C K}=sqrt{3} and angle O C K=60^{circ}. The center of the circle inscribed in an angle lies on the bisector of that angle, so angle A C B=2 angle O C K=120^{circ}. Then, by the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral O L C K, we find that angle L O K=60^{circ}.Since O L perp A C and M K | A C, then O L perp M K. Triangle M O K is isosceles, the height in it is also the bisector, so angle M O K=2 angle L O K=120^{circ}. Hence, M K=2 cdot M O cdot sin 60^{circ}=3.(c) MIPT, 2018angle M O L=frac{1}{2} angle M O K=60^{circ}, M O=L O, therefore, triangle M O L is equilateral, angle M L O=60^{circ}, M L=sqrt{3}. Then angle A L M=angle A L O-angle M L O=30^{circ}.Consider triangle A L M. By the cosine theorem, we get A M^{2}=A L^{2}+L M^{2}-2. A L cdot L M cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}=21. By the sine theorem, frac{A M}{sin 30^{circ}}=frac{L M}{sin alpha}, from which sin alpha=frac{1}{2 sqrt{7}}. Since angle alpha lies opposite the smaller side of the triangle, it is acute. From triangle A C H, we get C H=A C sin alpha=frac{sqrt{7}}{2}By the tangent and secant theorem, A L^{2}=A M cdot A N, from which A N=frac{36}{sqrt{21}}, M N=A N-A M=frac{15}{sqrt{21}}. Then the area of triangle C M N is frac{1}{2} cdot C H cdot M N=frac{5 sqrt{3}}{4}.Since K M | A C, triangles B K M and B C A are similar, with the similarity ratio being K M: C A=3: 7. Therefore, frac{B M}{B A}=frac{3}{7}, frac{B A-sqrt{21}}{B A}=frac{3}{7}, A B=frac{7 sqrt{21}}{4}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-bcb74a31><span data-v-bcb74a31>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
