There&#39;s a point P inside the triangle such that the distances from P to the vertices are PA = 11, PB = 7, and PC = 6. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this first.Since it&#39;s an isosceles right triangle with angle C being 90 degrees, that means sides AC and BC are equal in length, right? So, AC = BC, and AB is the hypotenuse. Let&#39;s denote the length of AC and BC as x. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, AB should be x√2. But I need to find x.Now, there&#39;s a point P inside the triangle with known distances to all three vertices. This seems like a problem that might involve coordinate geometry. Maybe I can place the triangle on a coordinate system to make it easier. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0), since it&#39;s the right angle. Then, since AC and BC are equal, I can place point A at (x, 0) and point B at (0, x). That makes sense because AC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (x,0), BC is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,x), and AB is the hypotenuse from (x,0) to (0,x).Point P is somewhere inside this triangle, and we know PA = 11, PB = 7, PC = 6. So if I can assign coordinates to point P, say (a, b), then I can write equations based on the distance formulas.Let me write that down:- Coordinates:  - C: (0, 0)  - A: (x, 0)  - B: (0, x)  - P: (a, b)Then:- PA = distance from P to A = √[(x - a)^2 + (0 - b)^2] = √[(x - a)^2 + b^2] = 11- PB = distance from P to B = √[(0 - a)^2 + (x - b)^2] = √[a^2 + (x - b)^2] = 7- PC = distance from P to C = √[(0 - a)^2 + (0 - b)^2] = √[a^2 + b^2] = 6So, we have three equations:1. √[(x - a)^2 + b^2] = 11  --&gt; square both sides: (x - a)^2 + b^2 = 121  ...(1)2. √[a^2 + (x - b)^2] = 7  --&gt; square both sides: a^2 + (x - b)^2 = 49   ...(2)3. √[a^2 + b^2] = 6        --&gt; square both sides: a^2 + b^2 = 36        ...(3)Now, equation (3) gives us a^2 + b^2 = 36. Maybe we can substitute this into equations (1) and (2).From equation (1):(x - a)^2 + b^2 = 121Expand (x - a)^2: x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + b^2 = 121But from equation (3), a^2 + b^2 = 36, so substitute:x^2 - 2ax + 36 = 121Simplify:x^2 - 2ax = 121 - 36 = 85So, x^2 - 2ax = 85  ...(1a)Similarly, equation (2):a^2 + (x - b)^2 = 49Expand (x - b)^2: a^2 + x^2 - 2bx + b^2 = 49Again, substitute a^2 + b^2 = 36:x^2 - 2bx + 36 = 49Simplify:x^2 - 2bx = 49 - 36 = 13So, x^2 - 2bx = 13  ...(2a)Now, equations (1a) and (2a) are:x^2 - 2ax = 85  ...(1a)x^2 - 2bx = 13  ...(2a)If I subtract equation (2a) from equation (1a):(x^2 - 2ax) - (x^2 - 2bx) = 85 - 13Simplify left side:x^2 - 2ax - x^2 + 2bx = (-2a + 2b)x = 72So,2x(b - a) = 72Divide both sides by 2:x(b - a) = 36  ...(4)So, we have x(b - a) = 36. Let&#39;s keep this in mind.Now, maybe we can find expressions for a and b from equations (1a) and (2a). Let&#39;s see.From (1a):x^2 - 2ax = 85So, rearranged:2ax = x^2 - 85Therefore:a = (x^2 - 85)/(2x)  ...(5)Similarly, from (2a):x^2 - 2bx = 13Rearranged:2bx = x^2 - 13Therefore:b = (x^2 - 13)/(2x)  ...(6)Now, substitute equations (5) and (6) into equation (4):x(b - a) = 36So,x [ ( (x^2 -13)/(2x) ) - ( (x^2 -85)/(2x) ) ] = 36Simplify inside the brackets:[ (x^2 -13 - x^2 + 85 ) / (2x) ) ] = (72)/(2x) = 36/xTherefore,x*(36/x) = 36Which simplifies to 36 = 36. Hmm. So this is an identity, which doesn&#39;t help us find x. That&#39;s interesting. It means that equations (1a) and (2a) are not independent when combined with equation (3). So, perhaps we need another approach.Since we have expressions for a and b in terms of x, maybe we can use equation (3) which is a^2 + b^2 = 36. Let&#39;s substitute equations (5) and (6) into equation (3).So, let&#39;s compute a and b:a = (x^2 -85)/(2x)b = (x^2 -13)/(2x)Compute a^2 + b^2:[(x^2 -85)/(2x)]^2 + [(x^2 -13)/(2x)]^2 = 36Let&#39;s compute each square:= [ (x^2 -85)^2 + (x^2 -13)^2 ] / (4x^2) = 36Multiply both sides by 4x^2:(x^2 -85)^2 + (x^2 -13)^2 = 144x^2Now, expand both squares:First term: (x^2 -85)^2 = x^4 - 170x^2 + 7225Second term: (x^2 -13)^2 = x^4 - 26x^2 + 169Add them together:x^4 -170x^2 + 7225 + x^4 -26x^2 +169 = 2x^4 -196x^2 + 7394So, 2x^4 -196x^2 + 7394 = 144x^2Bring all terms to left side:2x^4 -196x^2 +7394 -144x^2 = 0Combine like terms:2x^4 - (196 +144)x^2 +7394 = 02x^4 -340x^2 +7394 = 0Divide both sides by 2:x^4 -170x^2 + 3697 = 0So, this is a quartic equation, but it&#39;s quadratic in terms of x^2. Let me set y = x^2.Then, equation becomes:y^2 -170y + 3697 = 0Solve for y:Using quadratic formula:y = [170 ± √(170^2 -4*1*3697)] / 2Compute discriminant:170^2 = 289004*1*3697 = 14788So, discriminant = 28900 -14788 = 14112Check if 14112 is a perfect square. Let&#39;s see:14112 ÷ 16 = 882. So sqrt(14112) = 4*sqrt(882)But 882 = 49*18, so sqrt(882) = 7*sqrt(18) = 7*3*sqrt(2) = 21√2Therefore, sqrt(14112) = 4*21√2 = 84√2So, discriminant is 84√2. Wait, but 84√2 squared is (84^2)*(2) = 7056*2 = 14112. Right.Therefore, y = [170 ±84√2]/2 = 85 ±42√2So, y = x^2 = 85 +42√2 or 85 -42√2But since x^2 must be positive, check both:85 +42√2 ≈85 +59.396 ≈144.396 &gt;085 -42√2 ≈85 -59.396≈25.604 &gt;0So both are positive, so possible solutions.But x is the length of the side, so x must be positive. So,x = sqrt(85 +42√2) or sqrt(85 -42√2)But we need to check which one is valid. Since P is inside the triangle, the coordinates (a, b) must satisfy 0 &lt; a &lt; x and 0 &lt; b &lt; x (since it&#39;s inside the triangle with right angle at C and legs along x and y axes). Also, since the triangle is bounded by the hypotenuse from (x,0) to (0,x), the coordinates of P must satisfy a + b &lt; x (since the hypotenuse is the line x + y = x).Wait, actually in the coordinate system, the hypotenuse is from (x,0) to (0,x), so its equation is x + y = x, but wait, that&#39;s not right. Wait, the hypotenuse is between (x,0) and (0,x), so the equation is x/a + y/b =1, but here a and b are x and x, so equation is x + y = x? Wait, no.Wait, if the triangle has vertices at (0,0), (x,0), and (0,x), then the hypotenuse is the line from (x,0) to (0,x). The equation of that line can be found as follows.Slope is (x -0)/(0 -x) = -1. So the equation is y = -x + x, which is y = -x + x? Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s compute the equation properly.Points (x,0) and (0,x). The equation in slope-intercept form:Slope = (x - 0)/(0 - x) = -1. So slope is -1.Using point (x,0):y -0 = -1(x -x) =&gt; y = 0, which is not helpful.Wait, using point (0, x):y -x = -1(x -0) =&gt; y -x = -x =&gt; y = 0. That&#39;s not right either.Wait, maybe using two-point form:Between (x,0) and (0,x):(y -0)/(x -0) = (x -0)/(0 -x) =&gt; (y)/x = (x)/(-x) =&gt; y = -x. Wait, no.Wait, perhaps parametrize. Let me think.The line between (x,0) and (0,x). Let me take a general point (h,k) on this line.The parametric equations can be written as h = x - t, k = 0 + t, where t ranges from 0 to x. Then h + k = x - t + t = x. So the equation is h + k = x.Therefore, the equation of hypotenuse AB is x + y = x. Wait, but that would mean x + y = x, which simplifies to y = 0. That can&#39;t be right. Wait, no. Wait, if h + k = x, then the equation is x + y = x. Wait, that&#39;s y = 0, but that&#39;s the base. Wait, something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, let me re-derive this. Let&#39;s take two points (x, 0) and (0, x). The line connecting them should be x + y = x. Wait, when x is the coordinate variable here. Wait, maybe the confusion is because we used x as both the coordinate variable and the length of the side. That&#39;s probably causing confusion.Let me rename the side length as &#39;k&#39; instead of &#39;x&#39; to avoid confusion. Let&#39;s let the length of AC and BC be k. Then, coordinates:C: (0, 0)A: (k, 0)B: (0, k)Then, the hypotenuse AB connects (k, 0) to (0, k). The equation of this line can be found as follows.The slope is (k - 0)/(0 -k) = -1. So the equation is y = -x + k. Because when x = k, y = 0; when x = 0, y = k. So the equation is y = -x + k.Therefore, any point inside the triangle must satisfy y &lt;= -x + k, along with x &gt;=0, y &gt;=0.Therefore, for point P(a, b) inside the triangle, we have a &gt;=0, b &gt;=0, and a + b &lt;=k.So, going back, we have expressions for a and b in terms of k:a = (k^2 -85)/(2k)b = (k^2 -13)/(2k)We need to ensure that a and b are positive and a + b &lt;=k.First, check if a and b are positive:From equation (5):a = (k^2 -85)/(2k)Since k is positive, the sign of a depends on (k^2 -85). Similarly, for b:b = (k^2 -13)/(2k)So, for a to be positive: k^2 -85 &gt;0 =&gt; k^2 &gt;85 =&gt; k &gt; sqrt(85) ≈9.2195For b to be positive: k^2 -13 &gt;0 =&gt;k^2 &gt;13 =&gt;k &gt;sqrt(13)≈3.605Therefore, as long as k &gt; sqrt(85), both a and b are positive.Now, check a + b &lt;=k:Compute a + b:[(k^2 -85)/(2k)] + [(k^2 -13)/(2k)] = [2k^2 -98]/(2k) = (k^2 -49)/kSo, a + b = (k^2 -49)/kWe need this &lt;=k:(k^2 -49)/k &lt;=kMultiply both sides by k (positive, so inequality sign remains):k^2 -49 &lt;=k^2Subtract k^2:-49 &lt;=0, which is always true.Therefore, a + b &lt;=k is automatically satisfied as long as k^2 -49 &lt;=k^2, which is always true. So the only constraint is that k &gt; sqrt(85) ≈9.2195.Now, we have two possible solutions for k:k = sqrt(85 +42√2) or k = sqrt(85 -42√2)Compute their approximate values:First, compute 42√2:42*1.4142≈59.3964So,85 +42√2≈85 +59.3964≈144.3964sqrt(144.3964)≈12.016Similarly,85 -42√2≈85 -59.3964≈25.6036sqrt(25.6036)≈5.06But earlier, we saw that k must be greater than sqrt(85)≈9.2195. Therefore, the solution k≈5.06 is invalid, as it&#39;s less than 9.2195.Therefore, the only valid solution is k = sqrt(85 +42√2)≈12.016Therefore, the length of side AC is sqrt(85 +42√2). However, we can simplify this radical expression.Let me check if sqrt(85 +42√2) can be expressed in a simpler form. Suppose sqrt(a + b√c) can be written as sqrt(d) + sqrt(e). Let&#39;s assume:sqrt(85 +42√2) = sqrt(d) + sqrt(e)Then, squaring both sides:85 +42√2 = d + e + 2sqrt(de)Therefore, equate the rational and irrational parts:d + e =852sqrt(de)=42√2From the second equation:sqrt(de)=21√2Square both sides:de= (21√2)^2=441*2=882So, we have:d + e =85d*e =882Therefore, we need to solve for d and e.This is a system of equations. Let me set up the quadratic equation:Let d and e be roots of t^2 -85t +882=0Compute discriminant:85^2 -4*1*882=7225 -3528=3697Wait, sqrt(3697) is irrational. Hmm, so this doesn&#39;t factor nicely. Therefore, the expression sqrt(85 +42√2) cannot be simplified into a sum of simpler square roots. Therefore, the exact value is sqrt(85 +42√2), which is approximately 12.016.But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.Wait, 42√2 ≈59.396, so 85 +59.396≈144.396. sqrt(144.396) is approximately 12.016, which is correct. However, the problem might expect an exact answer in the form of sqrt(something). Let&#39;s check if 85 +42√2 can be expressed as (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))^2. Wait, maybe yes.Let me check:Suppose (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))^2 = a + b + 2sqrt(ab) =85 +42√2So, need:a + b =852sqrt(ab)=42√2Therefore,sqrt(ab)=21√2ab=(21√2)^2=441*2=882So same as before. Therefore, same quadratic equation, which doesn&#39;t have integer roots. Therefore, sqrt(85 +42√2) is the simplest exact form.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to write it as sqrt(85 +42√2), which is acceptable. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(85 +42√2). Let me check the original problem statement again. It says &quot;the length of side AC is [2]&quot;. The [2] is probably the problem number, so they just want the answer in boxed notation. So, my answer is sqrt(85 +42√2). However, let me confirm once again.Wait, but sometimes in these problems, people use the formula involving the sum of squares of distances from a point inside a right triangle. Is there a formula that relates PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 to something?Wait, in general, for any point inside a triangle, there are formulae involving coordinates, but maybe in a right triangle, there&#39;s a specific relation. Let me recall.In a coordinate system where C is at (0,0), A at (k,0), B at (0,k), and P at (a,b), then:PA^2 = (k -a)^2 + b^2PB^2 = a^2 + (k - b)^2PC^2 = a^2 + b^2So, PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = (k -a)^2 + b^2 + a^2 + (k - b)^2 + a^2 + b^2Expand:= k^2 - 2ak + a^2 + b^2 + a^2 + k^2 - 2bk + b^2 + a^2 + b^2Combine like terms:= 2k^2 -2ak -2bk + 3a^2 + 3b^2But maybe this isn&#39;t helpful. Alternatively, since we have three equations, maybe use them in some way.Alternatively, since we have:PA^2 = 121, PB^2 =49, PC^2=36.From equation (1a):k^2 -2ak =85From equation (2a):k^2 -2bk =13From equation (3):a^2 + b^2 =36Alternatively, perhaps we can use the British flag theorem? Wait, the British flag theorem states that for any point P in the plane of rectangle ABCD, PA^2 + PC^2 = PB^2 + PD^2. But here, triangle is not a rectangle, but an isosceles right triangle. However, maybe we can extend it to a square and apply the theorem.Let me consider extending triangle ABC to a square. Since ABC is an isosceles right triangle with legs AC and BC, if we complete the square by adding a point D such that ABCD is a square, then D would be at (k, k) if A is at (k,0) and B at (0,k). But since our triangle is only ABC, not a square. However, maybe applying the British flag theorem here.Wait, the British flag theorem for a square says PA^2 + PC^2 = PB^2 + PD^2, where D is the fourth corner. But in our case, we have triangle ABC. If we consider the square ABCD, then point D is outside the triangle. But since P is inside triangle ABC, which is half of the square. However, the British flag theorem might still hold, but PD is not a given distance here.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that in a right triangle, certain relations hold. Let me check.Alternatively, recall that in coordinate system, since we have expressions for a and b in terms of k, and we derived that k^4 -170k^2 +3697=0. The solution was k^2 =85 ±42√2. Since k must be greater than sqrt(85), we take k^2=85 +42√2, so k= sqrt(85 +42√2). So this seems correct.But let me verify with approximate values. Let&#39;s say k≈12.016, as we found. Then, compute a and b:a=(k^2 -85)/(2k)≈(144.396 -85)/24.032≈59.396/24.032≈2.47Similarly, b=(k^2 -13)/(2k)≈(144.396 -13)/24.032≈131.396/24.032≈5.47Check if a and b are positive and a + b ≈2.47 +5.47≈7.94 &lt;k≈12.016, which is true.Also, check if PC=6: sqrt(a^2 + b^2)=sqrt(2.47^2 +5.47^2)=sqrt(6.1 +29.9)=sqrt(36)=6, which matches.PA=11: sqrt((k -a)^2 +b^2)=sqrt((12.016 -2.47)^2 +5.47^2)=sqrt(9.546^2 +29.9)=sqrt(91.1 +29.9)=sqrt(121)=11, correct.PB=7: sqrt(a^2 + (k -b)^2)=sqrt(2.47^2 + (12.016 -5.47)^2)=sqrt(6.1 + (6.546)^2)=sqrt(6.1 +42.8)=sqrt(48.9)≈7, which is approximately 7. Hmm, 6.546 squared is 42.83, plus 6.1 is 48.93, sqrt of that is ≈6.995≈7. Close enough considering rounding errors.Therefore, the approximate values check out. Thus, the exact value is sqrt(85 +42√2). Let me compute sqrt(85 +42√2):But perhaps we can write this as sqrt(85 +42√2). Alternatively, note that 85 +42√2 is (sqrt(49*2) + sqrt(36))^2? Wait, 49*2=98, 36 is 36. 98 +36=134, not 85. Not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps express 85 +42√2 as (7√2 + 3)^2. Let&#39;s check:(7√2 +3)^2 = (7√2)^2 +2*7√2*3 +3^2= 98 +42√2 +9=107 +42√2. Close, but not 85 +42√2.Alternatively, (6√2 +5)^2= (6√2)^2 +2*6√2*5 +25=72 +60√2 +25=97 +60√2. Not matching.Alternatively, (5√2 + 7)^2=50 +70√2 +49=99 +70√2. Not matching.Hmm, maybe it&#39;s not a perfect square. So the answer remains sqrt(85 +42√2).Alternatively, maybe rationalize or write in another form, but I think that&#39;s the simplest exact form.Alternatively, the problem might be expecting an integer answer, which suggests that perhaps my approach is wrong. Wait, the given distances PA=11, PB=7, PC=6. These are all integers, and maybe the side length is an integer. But my calculation gives approximately 12.016, which is not an integer. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Let me think.Another approach is using vectors or complex numbers, but coordinate geometry seems the way to go. Alternatively, use the formula for the sum of squares of distances from a point to the vertices of a triangle.There is a formula that for any point P in the plane of triangle ABC,PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 + 3PG^2Where G is the centroid. But I don&#39;t know if that helps here.Alternatively, use the formula that in a coordinate system, with centroid at ( (x1 +x2 +x3)/3, (y1 + y2 + y3)/3 ), but since this is a right triangle, maybe not helpful.Alternatively, use the concept of Fermat points or something else, but in a right triangle, the Fermat point is the vertex with the right angle if all angles are less than 120 degrees, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case here.Alternatively, reflect the point P across the sides. In some problems, reflecting a point inside a right triangle across the legs can create a right triangle with the reflected points and use the Pythagorean theorem. Let me try.Let me consider reflecting point P across AC and BC.Reflect P over AC: since AC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (k,0). Reflecting over AC (x-axis) changes the y-coordinate sign. So if P is (a, b), reflection over AC is (a, -b). Similarly, reflecting over BC (y-axis) would be (-a, b).But I don&#39;t see immediately how that helps.Alternatively, use the Erdos-Mordell inequality, but that relates distances from a point to the sides, not the vertices.Alternatively, use the concept of trilateration with the three distances. But since we have three equations, we solved them already.Wait, but maybe the answer is 13. Let me check. If the side length is 13, then PA=11, PB=7, PC=6. Let&#39;s see if that fits.Wait, if k=13, then compute a and b:a=(13^2 -85)/(2*13)=(169 -85)/26=84/26=42/13≈3.23b=(13^2 -13)/(2*13)=(169 -13)/26=156/26=6So, a≈3.23, b=6.Then, check if a + b ≈9.23 &lt;13, yes.Check PC=6: sqrt(a^2 +b^2)=sqrt((42/13)^2 +6^2)=sqrt(1764/169 +36)=sqrt(1764/169 +6084/169)=sqrt(7848/169)=sqrt(46.43)=6.81, which is not 6. So PC would not be 6. Therefore, k=13 is invalid.Hmm, so that approach is wrong.Alternatively, maybe the answer is 14. Let&#39;s try k=14.a=(196 -85)/28=111/28≈3.96b=(196 -13)/28=183/28≈6.535Then, PC=sqrt(a^2 +b^2)=sqrt(15.68+42.7)=sqrt(58.38)≈7.64≠6. Not matching.Alternatively, k=12.016 as before. Since it&#39;s approximately 12.016, which is about 12. So maybe the answer is 13, but exact value is sqrt(85 +42√2). The problem might accept the exact form.Looking back at the problem statement: it says &quot;the length of side AC is [2]&quot;. The [2] is probably the problem number, so they just want the numerical value in a box. However, since the answer is irrational, they probably want the exact form, which is sqrt(85 +42√2). Alternatively, written in some other form.Alternatively, note that 85 +42√2=49 + 36 +42√2=7^2 + (3√2)^2 + 2*7*3√2. Which is (7 +3√2)^2. Wait, let&#39;s check:(7 +3√2)^2=49 +42√2 + 18=67 +42√2. Not 85 +42√2.Wait, 85 +42√2=67 +18 +42√2=67 +42√2 +18. Not helpful.Wait, 85=49 +36. 49 is 7^2, 36 is 6^2. Not sure.Alternatively, 85=81 +4=9^2 +2^2. Not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps factor 85 +42√2. But 85 and 42 have a common factor?  GCD(85,42)=1. So no.Alternatively, write as (sqrt(85) + something)^2. But sqrt(85)^2=85, and cross term. Doesn&#39;t help.Therefore, the answer is sqrt(85 +42√2). Thus, I think that is the exact value. Hence, the length of side AC is sqrt(85 +42√2). So boxed answer is boxed{sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}}}.Final AnswerThe length of side ( AC ) is (boxed{sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given an isosceles right triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), and a point ( P ) inside the triangle such that ( PA = 11 ), ( PB = 7 ), and ( PC = 6 ), we need to find the length of side ( AC ).1. Coordinate System Setup:   - Place ( C ) at the origin ((0, 0)).   - Place ( A ) at ((x, 0)) and ( B ) at ((0, x)).   - Let ( P ) have coordinates ((a, b)).2. Distance Equations:   - ( PA = sqrt{(x - a)^2 + b^2} = 11 )   - ( PB = sqrt{a^2 + (x - b)^2} = 7 )   - ( PC = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 6 )3. Square the Distances:   - ((x - a)^2 + b^2 = 121)   - (a^2 + (x - b)^2 = 49)   - (a^2 + b^2 = 36)4. Substitute ( a^2 + b^2 = 36 ):   - Expand and simplify the equations for ( PA ) and ( PB ):     - ( x^2 - 2ax + 36 = 121 ) leading to ( x^2 - 2ax = 85 )     - ( x^2 - 2bx + 36 = 49 ) leading to ( x^2 - 2bx = 13 )5. Solve for ( a ) and ( b ):   - ( a = frac{x^2 - 85}{2x} )   - ( b = frac{x^2 - 13}{2x} )6. Substitute ( a ) and ( b ) into ( a^2 + b^2 = 36 ):   - After substituting and simplifying, we derive the quartic equation:     - ( x^4 - 170x^2 + 3697 = 0 )7. Solve the Quartic Equation:   - Let ( y = x^2 ), solving ( y^2 - 170y + 3697 = 0 ) using the quadratic formula:     - ( y = frac{170 pm 84sqrt{2}}{2} )     - ( y = 85 + 42sqrt{2} ) (since the other solution is invalid due to being smaller than required)8. Final Length Calculation:   - The valid solution for ( x ) is ( sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}} ).Thus, the length of side ( AC ) is (boxed{sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have this problem about an isosceles right triangle ABC with angle ACB being 90 degrees. There&#39;s a point P inside the triangle such that the distances from P to the vertices are PA = 11, PB = 7, and PC = 6. I need to find the length of side AC. Hmm, interesting. First, let me visualize the triangle. Since it&#39;s an isosceles right triangle with the right angle at C, sides AC and BC should be equal. Let me denote the length of AC and BC as x. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse AB would be x√2. But the problem is about finding x, given these distances from an internal point P. I remember there&#39;s something called the British Flag Theorem which might be useful here. Let me recall what it states. The British Flag Theorem says that for any point P inside a rectangle, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to two opposite corners is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances to the other two opposite corners. But wait, our triangle is an isosceles right triangle, not a rectangle. However, maybe I can extend the triangle to form a square, which is a rectangle, and apply the theorem there.Let&#39;s try that. If ABC is an isosceles right triangle with right angle at C, then if we construct a square on the hypotenuse AB, completing the figure into a square. Wait, but actually, the triangle itself can be considered as half of a square. Let me think. If we reflect triangle ABC over AC, we get another triangle, and together they form a square. Similarly, reflecting over BC would also form a square. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (x,0), and point B at (0,x), since AC and BC are both length x. Then, the hypotenuse AB would be from (x,0) to (0,x). The point P is somewhere inside this triangle, and we know the distances from P to A, B, and C. Let me assign coordinates to point P. Let’s say P has coordinates (a,b). Then, the distance from P to C (0,0) is √(a² + b²) = 6. So, a² + b² = 36. The distance from P to A (x,0) is √((a - x)² + b²) = 11, so (a - x)² + b² = 121. Similarly, the distance from P to B (0,x) is √(a² + (b - x)²) = 7, so a² + (b - x)² = 49. Now, I have three equations:1. a² + b² = 36 (from PC = 6)2. (a - x)² + b² = 121 (from PA = 11)3. a² + (b - x)² = 49 (from PB = 7)Let me expand equations 2 and 3. Starting with equation 2:(a - x)² + b² = a² - 2ax + x² + b² = (a² + b²) - 2ax + x² = 121.But from equation 1, a² + b² = 36. So substituting that in:36 - 2ax + x² = 121.Similarly, equation 3:a² + (b - x)² = a² + b² - 2bx + x² = (a² + b²) - 2bx + x² = 49.Again, substituting a² + b² = 36:36 - 2bx + x² = 49.So now, from equations 2 and 3, we have two equations:-2ax + x² = 121 - 36 = 85.  (Equation 4)-2bx + x² = 49 - 36 = 13.   (Equation 5)So, equations 4 and 5:Equation 4: x² - 2ax = 85Equation 5: x² - 2bx = 13Let me subtract equation 5 from equation 4:(x² - 2ax) - (x² - 2bx) = 85 - 13x² - 2ax - x² + 2bx = 72(-2a + 2b)x = 722(b - a)x = 72(b - a)x = 36So, (b - a) = 36 / x. Let&#39;s keep this in mind. (Equation 6)Now, let&#39;s try to solve for a and b. Let&#39;s express equations 4 and 5 in terms of a and b:From equation 4: x² - 2ax = 85 → 2ax = x² - 85 → a = (x² - 85)/(2x)From equation 5: x² - 2bx = 13 → 2bx = x² - 13 → b = (x² - 13)/(2x)So, a = (x² - 85)/(2x) and b = (x² - 13)/(2x)Now, recall from equation 6: (b - a) = 36/xLet&#39;s compute b - a:b - a = [(x² - 13)/(2x)] - [(x² - 85)/(2x)] = [ (x² -13 - x² + 85) ] / (2x) = (72) / (2x) = 36/xWhich matches equation 6. So that&#39;s consistent. Good.Now, we also have equation 1: a² + b² = 36.Let me substitute a and b in terms of x into equation 1.First, compute a and b:a = (x² - 85)/(2x)b = (x² - 13)/(2x)Compute a² + b²:[(x² -85)^2)/(4x²)] + [(x² -13)^2)/(4x²)] = [ (x² -85)^2 + (x² -13)^2 ] / (4x²) = 36Multiply both sides by 4x²:(x² -85)^2 + (x² -13)^2 = 144x²Let me compute each term:First term: (x² -85)^2 = x^4 - 170x² + 7225Second term: (x² -13)^2 = x^4 -26x² + 169Adding them together:x^4 -170x² + 7225 + x^4 -26x² + 169 = 2x^4 -196x² + 7394So, 2x^4 -196x² + 7394 = 144x²Bring all terms to left side:2x^4 -196x² + 7394 -144x² = 0Combine like terms:2x^4 - (196 + 144)x² + 7394 = 0 → 2x^4 -340x² +7394 =0Divide both sides by 2:x^4 -170x² + 3697 =0Let me denote y = x². Then equation becomes:y² -170y +3697 =0Now, solving for y:Using quadratic formula:y = [170 ±√(170² -4*1*3697)] /2Compute discriminant:170² = 289004*1*3697 = 14788Discriminant: 28900 -14788 =14112√14112. Let&#39;s see: 14112 ÷ 16 = 882. √14112 = 4√882. 882=49*18. So √882=7√18=7*3√2=21√2. Therefore √14112=4*21√2=84√2. Wait, let me check:Wait, 14112 divided by 16 is 882. Then 882 is 49*18, so √882=7*3√2=21√2. So √14112=√(16*882)=4*21√2=84√2. Correct. So discriminant is 84√2.Therefore, y = [170 ±84√2]/2 = 85 ±42√2So, y = x² =85 +42√2 or y=85 -42√2Since x² must be positive, check if 85 -42√2 is positive.Compute 42√2 ≈42*1.4142≈59.4. 85 -59.4≈25.6. So positive. So both solutions are possible. But since x is the length of the side of the triangle, we need to check which one is valid.But how? Let&#39;s see. Since the point P is inside the triangle, coordinates a and b must be positive and a + b &lt;x, because in the coordinate system where C is at (0,0), A at (x,0), B at (0,x), the hypotenuse is x + y = x. Wait, actually in an isosceles right triangle, the hypotenuse is x√2. Wait, but in our coordinates, points A and B are at (x,0) and (0,x), so the hypotenuse is from (x,0) to (0,x), which has length x√2. So, the triangle is in the first quadrant, bounded by x-axis, y-axis, and the line x + y = x√2? Wait, no. Wait, in the coordinate system, the hypotenuse is from (x,0) to (0,x), so the equation of the hypotenuse is x + y = x. Wait, but that&#39;s not correct. Wait, no, the hypotenuse is from (x,0) to (0,x), so the equation is x/a + y/b =1, but here a =x, b =x. So equation is x/x + y/x =1 → x + y =x. That&#39;s not right. Wait, maybe I messed up.Wait, actually, in the coordinate system, point A is (x,0), point B is (0,x), so the hypotenuse AB is the line connecting these two points. The equation of this line is y = -x + x, which is y = -x + x. Wait, no. Let me compute the slope. The slope is (x -0)/(0 -x) = -1. So the equation is y = -x + x? Wait, when x= x, y=0. So the equation is y = -x + x? That simplifies to y =0. Wait, that&#39;s not right. Wait, when moving from (x,0) to (0,x), the slope is (x -0)/(0 -x) = -1, so the equation is y -0 = -1*(X -x), so y = -X +x. So equation of AB is X + Y =x. So yes, the hypotenuse is the line x + y =x, which is x + y =x. Wait, that simplifies to y=0, which can&#39;t be right. Wait, no, let me check.Wait, point A is (x,0), point B is (0,x). So, when X= x, Y=0. When X=0, Y=x. So the equation is indeed X + Y =x. So any point on AB satisfies X + Y =x. Therefore, the hypotenuse is the line x + y =x. Wait, but that would mean x + y =x → y=0, which is the x-axis. That can&#39;t be right. Wait, no, wait, that&#39;s not correct. Wait, if you have two points (x,0) and (0,x), the equation of the line joining them is x/X + y/Y =1? Wait, maybe that&#39;s not the standard form. Let me compute it properly.Slope is (x -0)/(0 -x) = -1. So the line has slope -1 and passes through (x,0). So the equation is:y -0 = -1*(X -x) → y = -X +x. So yes, X + Y =x. So any point (X,Y) on the hypotenuse satisfies X + Y =x. Therefore, the hypotenuse is the line X + Y =x.Therefore, the triangle is bounded by X ≥0, Y ≥0, and X + Y ≤x. So for point P inside the triangle, coordinates (a,b) must satisfy a ≥0, b ≥0, and a + b ≤x.Given that, since a and b are coordinates of point P inside the triangle, we can check if for each solution x²=85 +42√2 or x²=85 -42√2, the values of a and b satisfy a + b ≤x.First, let&#39;s compute x for both cases.Case 1: x²=85 +42√2 →x=√(85 +42√2)Case 2: x²=85 -42√2 →x=√(85 -42√2)Compute approximate values:First, compute 42√2 ≈42*1.4142≈59.3964Case 1: 85 +59.3964≈144.3964 →x≈12.02Case 2: 85 -59.3964≈25.6036 →x≈5.06Now, check if a and b in each case satisfy a + b ≤x.First, compute a and b for both cases.Case 1: x≈12.02a = (x² -85)/(2x) = (85 +42√2 -85)/(2x) = (42√2)/(2x) = (21√2)/x ≈ (21*1.4142)/12.02 ≈29.6982/12.02≈2.47Similarly, b = (x² -13)/(2x) = (85 +42√2 -13)/(2x) = (72 +42√2)/(2x) = (36 +21√2)/x ≈(36 +29.6982)/12.02≈65.6982/12.02≈5.47Then, a + b ≈2.47 +5.47≈7.94 ≤12.02. Which is true.Case 2: x≈5.06Compute a = (x² -85)/(2x) = (85 -42√2 -85)/(2x) = (-42√2)/(2x) = (-21√2)/x ≈(-29.6982)/5.06≈-5.87But a is negative here. Since coordinates a and b must be non-negative (as P is inside the triangle), this is invalid. Therefore, Case 2 is rejected.Therefore, only Case 1 is valid, so x²=85 +42√2, so x=√(85 +42√2). Wait, but the problem is asking for the length of AC, which is x, so the answer is √(85 +42√2). But maybe this can be simplified? Let me check.Let’s see if 85 +42√2 is a perfect square. Suppose √(85 +42√2) can be written as √a + √b. Let’s assume that (√a + √b)^2 = a + 2√(ab) + b = (a + b) + 2√(ab) =85 +42√2.Therefore, setting up equations:a + b =852√(ab) =42√2 →√(ab)=21√2 →ab=(21√2)^2=441*2=882So we have:a + b =85ab=882So, we need to solve for a and b such that they satisfy these equations.Let me solve quadratic equation t² -85t +882=0Discriminant: 85² -4*1*882=7225 -3528=3697Wait, 85²=7225, 4*882=3528, so 7225 -3528=3697. So discriminant is 3697, which is not a perfect square. Hmm. Therefore, 85 +42√2 is not a perfect square in terms of √a +√b. Therefore, the answer would be √(85 +42√2). But maybe the problem expects a numerical value? But since it&#39;s a competition problem, likely an exact form is needed. Let me check if I made a miscalculation.Wait, earlier steps:We had the quartic equation leading to x^4 -170x² +3697=0, then substitution y=x² gives y² -170y +3697=0, solved for y= [170 ±√(170² -4*1*3697)]/2= [170 ±√(28900 -14788)]/2= [170 ±√14112]/2= [170 ±84√2]/2=85 ±42√2.Yes, that&#39;s correct. So x²=85 +42√2 or x²=85 -42√2. Since x must be positive, and x≈12.02 and ≈5.06, but the second case gives negative a, which is invalid, so only the first case is valid, leading to x=√(85 +42√2). However, let&#39;s check if this can be simplified further.Wait, perhaps 85 +42√2 is equal to (sqrt something)^2. Let me see. Let’s suppose that 85 +42√2 is (a + b√2)^2 where a and b are integers.Compute (a + b√2)^2= a² + 2ab√2 + 2b². So to equal 85 +42√2, we need:a² + 2b² =852ab=42 →ab=21So solve for integers a, b with ab=21. Possible pairs (a,b)=(1,21),(3,7),(7,3),(21,1). Also negatives, but since we’re squaring, positives are sufficient.Check these:First pair: a=1, b=21.a² +2b²=1 + 2*(441)=1 +882=883≠85. Not.Second pair: a=3, b=7.a² +2b²=9 +2*49=9 +98=107≠85.Third pair: a=7, b=3.a² +2b²=49 +2*9=49 +18=67≠85.Fourth pair: a=21, b=1.a² +2b²=441 +2=443≠85.Not working. How about fractions? Maybe a and b are fractions.But since 85 +42√2 is irrational, and the problem likely expects an exact form, which is √(85 +42√2). But let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;the length of side AC is [2]&quot;. The [2] might indicate the answer is to be written in a specific format, perhaps as boxed{sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}}} or maybe there&#39;s a different approach where the answer is an integer? Wait, that can&#39;t be, since 85 +42√2 is not a perfect square. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.Wait, let&#39;s verify the equations again. Let me double-check.PA=11: √[(a -x)^2 + b²]=11 → (a -x)^2 + b²=121PB=7: √[a² + (b -x)^2]=7 → a² + (b -x)^2=49PC=6: √[a² + b²]=6 →a² + b²=36Then expanding PA and PB equations:PA: (a -x)^2 + b² = a² - 2ax +x² + b² = (a² + b²) -2ax +x² =36 -2ax +x²=121 →x² -2ax=85Similarly, PB: a² + (b -x)^2 =a² + b² -2bx +x²=36 -2bx +x²=49→x² -2bx=13Then, from these two equations, subtract to get (x² -2ax) - (x² -2bx)=85 -13→2x(b -a)=72→x(b -a)=36→b -a=36/xThen, solving for a and b in terms of x:From x² -2ax=85→2ax=x² -85→a=(x² -85)/(2x)From x² -2bx=13→2bx=x² -13→b=(x² -13)/(2x)Then, equation a² + b²=36:[(x² -85)^2 + (x² -13)^2]/(4x²)=36Multiply both sides by 4x²:(x² -85)^2 + (x² -13)^2=144x²Expanding both terms:First term: x^4 -170x² +7225Second term:x^4 -26x² +169Adding them:2x^4 -196x² +7394=144x²Then 2x^4 -340x² +7394=0→x^4 -170x² +3697=0Then substituting y=x²:y² -170y +3697=0→solutions y=(170 ±√(28900 -14788))/2=(170 ±√14112)/2=(170 ±84√2)/2=85±42√2So, correct. Then x=√(85 +42√2)≈12.02, which seems plausible.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way using the British Flag Theorem. Let me recall that.In the British Flag Theorem, for any point P in the plane of rectangle ABCD, PA² + PC² = PB² + PD², where PA, PB, PC, PD are distances to the four corners.But our triangle is half of a square. Let me think. If we consider the isosceles right triangle ABC, and complete it to a square by adding another triangle, say, ABC&#39;, where C&#39; is the reflection of C over AB. Then, in the square ACC&#39;B, the British Flag Theorem applies. Wait, but point P is inside triangle ABC, not the square. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the theorem can still be applied with some modifications. Let me try.If we consider the square ACBD, where D is the fourth vertex. Then, for point P inside the original triangle ABC, the British Flag Theorem would state that PA² + PD² = PB² + PC². But we don&#39;t know PD. However, maybe we can express PD in terms of the known quantities.Wait, but since D is outside the original triangle, and we don&#39;t have information about PD. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry is the way to go. Since the equations led us to x=√(85 +42√2), which is approximately 12.02. Wait, but 85 +42√2 is 85 +59.396≈144.396, whose square root is approximately 12.02. However, 12.02 squared is 144.48, which is close to 85 +59.396=144.396. So, that&#39;s about right.But maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think.Alternatively, there is a formula for the coordinates of a point inside a triangle with given distances to the vertices. But that&#39;s more complicated. Alternatively, using vectors or complex numbers.Alternatively, consider using the fact that in an isosceles right triangle, rotating the triangle 90 degrees around point C maps A to B and B to A. Maybe using some symmetry.But perhaps the coordinate approach is the most straightforward, even if it leads to an expression involving radicals. So unless there&#39;s a simplification I missed, the answer is √(85 +42√2). Let me check if that&#39;s the case.Wait, 85 +42√2 can be written as (7√2 + 3)^2? Let&#39;s check:(7√2 +3)^2 = (7√2)^2 + 2*7√2*3 +3²= 98 +42√2 +9=107 +42√2. Not 85 +42√2. Close, but not quite.How about (6√2 +5)^2= (6√2)^2 +2*6√2*5 +25=72 +60√2 +25=97 +60√2. Not.How about (5√2 +7)^2=50 +70√2 +49=99 +70√2. Not.Alternatively, maybe (something else). Let me see:Suppose (a√2 +b)^2=2a² +2ab√2 +b²=85 +42√2. Then equate:2a² +b²=852ab=42→ab=21So, same as before. So solving for integers a and b with ab=21. Possible a and b:1 and 21, 3 and7, 7 and3, 21 and1. So trying these:For a=3, b=7:2*(9) +49=18+49=67≠85a=7, b=3:2*49 +9=98+9=107≠85a=1, b=21:2*1 +441=443≠85a=21, b=1:2*441 +1=882+1=883≠85So again, no solution. Therefore, 85 +42√2 is not a perfect square of a binomial with terms involving √2. Therefore, the answer is indeed √(85 +42√2).But wait, the problem states that &quot;the length of side AC is [2]&quot;. The [2] might indicate that the answer is an integer written in the box. But from our calculation, it&#39;s a radical expression. Hmm. Maybe there&#39;s an error in my approach. Let me verify once again.Wait, perhaps when I set up the coordinate system, I assigned point C at (0,0), A at (x,0), and B at (0,x). Then, the hypotenuse is AB with coordinates (x,0) and (0,x). Then, the distance from P(a,b) to A is √[(a -x)^2 + b²]=11, and similarly others. Then, equations are correct.Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of squares of distances from a point to the vertices of a triangle. But I don&#39;t recall such a formula offhand.Alternatively, recall that in any triangle, the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices can be related to the coordinates or to the side lengths, but in this case, we have a specific triangle and specific distances.Alternatively, use the concept of Fermat points or something else, but in a right triangle, the Fermat-Toricelli point is the vertex of the right angle if all angles are less than 120°, but here it&#39;s a right angle. Not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using the Pythagorean theorem in some clever way. Let me think.Given that PA=11, PB=7, PC=6. Maybe construct right triangles with these distances. But since P is inside the triangle ABC, perhaps coordinate geometry is the most straightforward.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the problem in terms of vectors. Let me denote vectorially.Let’s take point C as the origin, vector CA = (x,0), vector CB = (0,x). Let vector CP = (a,b). Then PA = |CA - CP| = |(x -a, -b)| = √[(x -a)^2 + b²] =11, PB = |CB - CP| = |(-a, x -b)| = √[a² + (x -b)^2]=7, PC=√[a² +b²]=6.So equations are same as before. So, solving the same system. So the answer is indeed √(85 +42√2). Unless there&#39;s a miscalculation here, which I can&#39;t see.Alternatively, maybe the answer is an integer. Wait, 85 +42√2≈85 +59.39≈144.39, and √144.39≈12.02. But 12.02 squared is 144.48, which is close but not exact. So, it&#39;s irrational. Therefore, the exact answer is √(85 +42√2). Hence, the answer is boxed{sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}}}.But wait, the original problem says &quot;Example 2&quot;. Maybe there is a standard example where the answer is known. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate setup.Wait, perhaps I should have taken the legs as length x, and then the coordinates would be C(0,0), A(x,0), B(0,x), as I did. Then, the distances PA, PB, PC lead to the equations. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 13? Wait, 11,7,6 – maybe there&#39;s a relation. But 11² +7² +6²=121+49+36=206. Not sure.Alternatively, using the formula from the problem&#39;s solution: in some cases, for a point inside an isosceles right triangle, there&#39;s a formula relating the distances to the vertices and the side length. However, I don&#39;t recall such a formula.Alternatively, check if the answer can be written as √(85 +42√2). Let&#39;s compute this value:Compute 42√2≈59.39685 +59.396≈144.396√144.396≈12.016, which is approximately 12. So maybe the problem expects an exact form. But the problem says &quot;the length of side AC is [2]&quot;. The [2] might indicate that the answer is two digits, but 12.016 is approximately 12.02, which is two decimal places. However, in competition problems, if the answer is irrational, it&#39;s usually left in radical form. So √(85 +42√2) is the exact value, so boxed as such.Alternatively, perhaps rationalizing or simplifying:√(85 +42√2). Let me see if it can be written in another way. Suppose it&#39;s expressed as something like m +n√2, then (m +n√2)^2= m² +2mn√2 +2n²=85 +42√2. So:m² +2n²=852mn=42→mn=21So same equations again. So m and n are positive real numbers. Solutions are:From mn=21, n=21/m. Substitute into first equation:m² +2*(21/m)^2=85Multiply both sides by m²:m^4 +2*441=85m²m^4 -85m² +882=0Let y =m²:y² -85y +882=0Solutions y=(85 ±√(85² -4*882))/2=(85 ±√(7225 -3528))/2=(85 ±√3697)/2But 3697 is a prime number? Let me check. 3697 divided by 13: 13*284=3692, remainder 5. Not divisible by 13. 3697 divided by 7: 7*528=3696, remainder 1. Not divisible by 7. 3697 is a prime. Hence, this approach does not yield integer solutions. Therefore, m and n are irrational, so the expression √(85 +42√2) cannot be simplified further in terms of integers and radicals. Therefore, the answer is √(85 +42√2).Thus, after thorough consideration and verification, I believe that is the correct answer.Final AnswerThe length of side ( AC ) is (boxed{sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given an isosceles right triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), and a point ( P ) inside the triangle such that ( PA = 11 ), ( PB = 7 ), and ( PC = 6 ), we need to find the length of side ( AC ).1. Coordinate Setup:   - Place ( C ) at the origin ((0,0)), ( A ) at ((x,0)), and ( B ) at ((0,x)).   - Let ( P ) have coordinates ((a,b)).2. Distance Equations:   - From ( PC = 6 ): ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 6 ) ⟹ ( a^2 + b^2 = 36 ).   - From ( PA = 11 ): ( sqrt{(a - x)^2 + b^2} = 11 ) ⟹ ( (a - x)^2 + b^2 = 121 ).   - From ( PB = 7 ): ( sqrt{a^2 + (b - x)^2} = 7 ) ⟹ ( a^2 + (b - x)^2 = 49 ).3. Expanding and Simplifying:   - Expand the equations for ( PA ) and ( PB ):     - ( (a - x)^2 + b^2 = 121 ) ⟹ ( a^2 - 2ax + x^2 + b^2 = 121 ) ⟹ ( 36 - 2ax + x^2 = 121 ) ⟹ ( x^2 - 2ax = 85 ).     - ( a^2 + (b - x)^2 = 49 ) ⟹ ( a^2 + b^2 - 2bx + x^2 = 49 ) ⟹ ( 36 - 2bx + x^2 = 49 ) ⟹ ( x^2 - 2bx = 13 ).4. Solving for ( a ) and ( b ):   - From ( x^2 - 2ax = 85 ) and ( x^2 - 2bx = 13 ):     - Subtract these equations: ( -2ax + 2bx = 72 ) ⟹ ( 2x(b - a) = 72 ) ⟹ ( (b - a)x = 36 ).   - Express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( x ):     - ( a = frac{x^2 - 85}{2x} )     - ( b = frac{x^2 - 13}{2x} )5. Substitute ( a ) and ( b ) into ( a^2 + b^2 = 36 ):   - After substitution and simplification, we get the quartic equation:     - ( x^4 - 170x^2 + 3697 = 0 )   - Let ( y = x^2 ), solving ( y^2 - 170y + 3697 = 0 ):     - Solutions: ( y = 85 pm 42sqrt{2} )   - Since ( x ) must be positive, check valid solutions:     - ( x = sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}} ) is valid, while ( x = sqrt{85 - 42sqrt{2}} ) is invalid due to negative coordinates.Thus, the length of side ( AC ) is (boxed{sqrt{85 + 42sqrt{2}}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>As shown in Figure 3, triangle P B C is rotated 90^{circ} clockwise around point C, making point B coincide with A, and point P moves to position P^{prime}, connecting P P^{prime}.Then triangle C P P^{prime} is an isosceles right triangle.

The question is about representing the product (x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)...(x - 12)(x - 13) as a permutation expression, given that x is a positive integer greater than 13. The options are A through D, each with different permutation notations. First, I need to recall what the notation A(n, k) stands for. From what I remember, in permutations, A(n, k), sometimes written as P(n, k), represents the number of ways to arrange k items out of n distinct items, and it&#39;s calculated as n! / (n - k)!. So, for example, A(5, 2) would be 5 * 4 = 20. Now, looking at the given expression: (x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)...(x - 12)(x - 13). Let me count how many terms are in this product. Starting from (x - 3) up to (x - 13), the numbers subtracted from x are 3, 4, 5, ..., 13. Let me list them out to count: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. That&#39;s 11 terms in total because 13 - 3 + 1 = 11. Wait, 13 - 3 is 10, plus 1 is 11. So there are 11 factors here. So, the product is 11 consecutive terms, each decreasing by 1 in the subtracted number. But in terms of permutation notation, A(n, k) is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * (n - k + 1). So, if we have A(n, k), it&#39;s the product of k terms starting from n and going down by 1 each time. Comparing this to our given expression: (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Let me see. Let&#39;s try to write this in the form of a permutation. Suppose we set n as some number and k as 11 (since there are 11 terms). Then A(n, 11) would be n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - 10). But our given expression is (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Let&#39;s see what the relationship is here. Let&#39;s try to express each term (x - m) as a term in a permutation. Let&#39;s start by reindexing the terms. If we let m start from 3 and go up to 13, then each term is (x - m). Alternatively, if we reverse the order, starting from (x - 13) up to (x - 3), that would be similar to a descending product. Let me try that. Suppose we write it as (x - 13)(x - 12)...(x - 3). That would be the reverse order, but multiplication is commutative, so the product is the same. Now, let&#39;s see if we can relate this to A(n, k). If we set the first term as (x - 13), the next as (x - 12), up to (x - 3). So, the first term is (x - 13), then (x - 13 + 1), up to (x - 13 + 10), since there are 11 terms. Wait, (x - 13) + 10 would be (x - 3). So, the product can be expressed as (x - 13) * (x - 13 + 1) * (x - 13 + 2) * ... * (x - 13 + 10). But in permutation terms, A(n, k) is n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - k + 1). Wait, but here we have an ascending sequence. If we reverse the order, we can get a descending sequence. Let&#39;s see:(x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13) = (x - 13)(x - 12)...(x - 3) if we reverse the order. But this ascending sequence can be thought of as starting from (x - 13) and multiplying 11 terms, each increasing by 1. So, if we set n = x - 13, then the terms would be n, n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + 10. But permutation formulas involve descending sequences. Alternatively, if we factor out a negative sign from each term, but that would complicate things since the product would then have (-1)^11 times (13 - x)(12 - x)...(3 - x). But since x &gt; 13, these terms would be negative, but we have 11 negative signs, so (-1)^11 times the product of (x - 13)(x - 12)...(x - 3). But that might not be helpful here. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let&#39;s note that the permutation formula A(n, k) is equal to n! / (n - k)!. So, for example, if n is x - 3, then A(x - 3, 10) would be (x - 3)! / (x - 3 - 10)! = (x - 3)! / (x - 13)!.But our product is (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Let&#39;s compute how many terms there are. As we saw earlier, from 3 to 13 inclusive, that&#39;s 11 terms. So the product is 11 terms starting from (x - 3) down to (x - 13). Alternatively, if we think of this as (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13) = (x - 3)! / (x - 14)! but wait, (x - 3)! is (x - 3)(x - 4)...1, and (x - 14)! is (x - 14)(x - 15)...1, so the ratio would be (x - 3)! / (x - 14)! which is equal to the product from k = x - 13 to x - 3 of k. Wait, that might not directly correspond. Wait, let&#39;s check:If I take (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Let&#39;s substitute n = x - 13. Then each term becomes (n + 10)(n + 9)...n. So that&#39;s the product from k = n to k = n + 10, which is 11 terms. However, the permutation A(n + 10, 11) would be (n + 10)(n + 9)...(n + 10 - 11 + 1) = (n + 10)(n + 9)...n. Which is exactly the same as our product. So, since n = x - 13, then A(n + 10, 11) = A(x - 13 + 10, 11) = A(x - 3, 11). Wait, but in the substitution, n = x - 13, so n + 10 = x - 13 + 10 = x - 3. Therefore, A(x - 3, 11) is equal to (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). But looking at the options, we have option B: A_{x-3}^{11} and option D: A_{x-13}^{11}. So, according to this substitution, it&#39;s A(x - 3, 11), which would correspond to option B. However, the answer options are written with subscripts and superscripts. The notation can vary, but typically A_n^k is the same as A(n, k). So, A_{x-3}^{11} would be A(x - 3, 11). So that would be the case here. Wait, but let me verify again. If we set n = x - 3, then A(n, 11) = n! / (n - 11)! = (x - 3)! / (x - 14)!.But our product is (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Let&#39;s compute how many terms that is. From 3 to 13 inclusive: 13 - 3 + 1 = 11 terms. So the product is (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13) = product_{k=3}^{13} (x - k). Let me shift the index. Let me let m = k - 3, then when k = 3, m = 0; when k = 13, m = 10. So the product becomes product_{m=0}^{10} (x - (3 + m)) = product_{m=0}^{10} (x - 3 - m) = product_{m=0}^{10} ( (x - 3) - m ). So that&#39;s the same as (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13), which is 11 terms. Which is also equal to A(x - 3, 11). Because A(n, k) = product_{i=0}^{k - 1} (n - i). So here, n = x - 3, and k = 11. Therefore, A(x - 3, 11) = (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). So that would correspond to option B: A_{x-3}^{11}. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:A: A_{x-3}^{10}B: A_{x-3}^{11}C: A_{x-13}^{10}D: A_{x-13}^{11}So according to this reasoning, the answer is B. However, the options also include C and D which involve x - 13. Maybe there&#39;s another way to represent this. Let me check again.Alternatively, suppose we consider the permutation starting from (x - 13). Let&#39;s set m = x - 13. Then our product is (m + 10)(m + 9)...(m). Which is the product from m to m + 10, which is 11 terms. But permutation A(n, k) is starting from n and going down. So if we have m, m + 1, ..., m + 10, this is ascending. But permutations are descending. So unless we reverse the order. Wait, but permutation is about ordered arrangements, but in terms of the formula, A(n, k) is n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - k + 1). So, if we have an ascending product, it&#39;s not exactly the permutation formula. But in our case, the product (x - 3)...(x - 13) is a descending product. Let&#39;s check:(x - 3), (x - 4), ..., (x - 13). Each term is one less than the previous. So starting from (x - 3) and descending by 1 each time for 11 terms. So this is exactly the permutation formula. If we let n = x - 3 and k = 11, then A(n, k) = n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - k + 1) = (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Therefore, it&#39;s A_{x - 3}^{11}, which is option B.Alternatively, if someone were to mistakenly count the number of terms as 10 instead of 11, they might pick option A. Let me verify the number of terms again. From 3 to 13 inclusive: 13 - 3 = 10, but since both ends are inclusive, it&#39;s 10 + 1 = 11 terms. So that&#39;s correct.Wait, but another perspective: suppose the expression is written as (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). If we factor out a negative sign from each term, we get (-1)^{11}(3 - x)(4 - x)...(13 - x). But that&#39;s equal to (-1)^{11} * (13 - x)(12 - x)...(3 - x). However, x &gt; 13, so each term (3 - x), (4 - x), ..., (13 - x) is negative, but when we take the product, (-1)^11 * product_{k=3}^{13} (k - x). But since x &gt; 13, each (k - x) is negative, so (k - x) = - (x - k). So the product becomes (-1)^11 * product_{k=3}^{13} (- (x - k)) = (-1)^11 * (-1)^{11} * product_{k=3}^{13} (x - k) = (-1)^{22} * product = 1 * product. So that&#39;s the same as the original product. Not sure if that helps, but it shows that the product is positive, which makes sense since all terms (x - k) are positive as x &gt; 13 and k up to 13.Alternatively, maybe someone might think of the permutation starting from x - 13. Let&#39;s see: if we set n = x - 13, then A(n, 11) would be n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - 10). But n = x - 13, so (x - 13)(x - 14)...(x - 23). Wait, that doesn&#39;t match our original product. Our original product is (x - 3)...(x - 13). So starting from x - 3 and going down to x - 13. If we set n = x - 3, then A(n, 11) = (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). So that matches. Therefore, the correct answer is B: A_{x - 3}^{11}.But wait, let me check the answer options again. The options are labeled A to D. The problem might be using a different notation where the subscript and superscript are reversed. Wait, in Chinese textbooks, sometimes permutations are written as A_n^k where n is the total number and k is the number being chosen, which is equivalent to A(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!. So if the question is using A_{n}^{k}, that&#39;s the same as A(n, k). So in that case, A_{x - 3}^{11} is A(x - 3, 11) which is correct.Alternatively, if the question uses A_{k}^{n}, but I think it&#39;s more standard in Chinese notation to have A_n^k where n is the total and k is the number selected. So in this case, since we have 11 terms starting from (x - 3), which would correspond to A_{x - 3}^{11}, that is, selecting 11 elements from (x - 3) elements. But hold on, another way: if we have (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13) = A_{x - 3}^{11} because you&#39;re taking 11 terms starting from (x - 3). However, maybe there&#39;s a different interpretation. Let me consider the general formula for permutations. If we have n elements and we want to arrange k of them, the number is A(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!. So, for example, if n = 5 and k = 2, A(5, 2) = 5 * 4 = 20. In our case, the product is 11 terms: (x - 3) down to (x - 13). Let&#39;s calculate how much we subtract from (x - 3) to get to (x - 13). The difference between (x - 3) and (x - 13) is 10. So, starting at (x - 3), we subtract 10 to get to (x - 13). But in permutation terms, A(n, k) is the product from n down to n - k + 1. So, k terms. For example, A(n, 11) would be n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - 10). Therefore, if our product is 11 terms starting at (x - 3) and ending at (x - 13), then this is exactly A(x - 3, 11). Because (x - 3) - 10 = (x - 13), so the 11 terms are (x - 3) down to (x - 13). Therefore, A_{x - 3}^{11} is correct. So the answer is B.But let me check the other options. Option D is A_{x - 13}^{11}, which would be A(x - 13, 11) = (x - 13)(x - 14)...(x - 23). But our product stops at (x - 13), so that&#39;s not matching. Similarly, options A and C have 10 instead of 11. Since there are 11 terms, options A and C can be ruled out. So between B and D. But as established, B is A_{x - 3}^{11} which gives the correct terms. Therefore, the answer should be B.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me confirm once more. If x &gt; 13, then x - 13 is a positive integer. So, A_{x - 3}^{11} is the permutation of 11 elements from (x - 3) elements. But permutations usually require that the number of elements being permuted is less than or equal to the total number of elements. Since x &gt; 13, x - 3 is certainly greater than 11 (since x &gt; 13, x - 3 &gt; 10, but x could be 14, so x - 3 = 11, which is equal to 11). Wait, if x = 14, then x - 3 = 11, so A_{11}^{11} would be 11!, which is the product from 11 down to 1. But our product in that case would be (14 - 3)(14 - 4)...(14 - 13) = 11 * 10 * ... * 1. So that&#39;s 11!, which is indeed A_{11}^{11}. So that works. If x = 15, then x - 3 = 12, and our product is 12 * 11 * ... * 2, which is A(12, 11) = 12! / (12 - 11)! = 12! / 1! = 12!. Which is correct. So yeah, in general, the product (x - 3)...(x - 13) is equal to A(x - 3, 11). So the answer is B.Alternatively, if someone thought that the starting term is x - 13 and they wanted to express it as a permutation starting from x - 13, but that would require ascending terms, which permutations don&#39;t use. Because permutations are descending products. So unless there&#39;s a different notation, but in standard permutation notation, it&#39;s a descending product. So I think B is correct.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The given expression is ((x-3)(x-4)(x-5)ldots(x-12)(x-13)) where (x in mathbb{N}^+) and (x &gt; 13). We need to represent this expression using permutation notation (A_n^k).1. Count the number of terms: The terms are from ((x-3)) to ((x-13)), which includes 11 terms (since (13 - 3 + 1 = 11)).2. Permutation notation: The permutation (A(n, k)) represents the product of (k) terms starting from (n) and descending by 1 each time. This is calculated as (n times (n-1) times ldots times (n-k+1)).3. Relate to the given expression: The given expression ((x-3)(x-4)ldots(x-13)) can be seen as the product of 11 terms starting from ((x-3)) and descending by 1 each time. This matches the permutation notation (A(x-3, 11)).Thus, the expression ((x-3)(x-4)ldots(x-13)) is represented as (A_{x-3}^{11}).[boxed{B}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly represents the expression (x-3)(x-4)(x-5)...(x-12)(x-13) where x is a positive integer greater than 13. The options are permutations, denoted by A with some subscripts and superscripts. Let me recall what permutation notation means.Permutation notation A(n, k) or sometimes written as P(n, k) represents the number of ways to arrange k items out of n, which is equal to n! / (n - k)!. So, A_n^k is the same as P(n, k) and equals n! / (n - k)!.Looking at the problem, the given expression is a product of consecutive terms starting from (x - 3) down to (x - 13). Let me count how many terms there are here. Starting from (x - 3) up to (x - 13), so the terms are (x - 3), (x - 4), (x - 5), ..., (x - 13). Let me count how many factors that is. The first term is when the subtracted number is 3, and the last term is when it&#39;s 13. So, from 3 to 13 inclusive, how many numbers is that?Subtracting 3 from 13 gives 10, but since both endpoints are included, it&#39;s 13 - 3 + 1 = 11 terms. So there are 11 terms being multiplied here.Now, the product of consecutive integers from some number down to another can be represented as a permutation. For example, if you have n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - k + 1), that&#39;s equal to A(n, k). So in permutation terms, if I have a product of k consecutive terms starting from n and decreasing by 1 each time, that&#39;s A(n, k).In this problem, the expression is (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Let me see if I can rewrite this product in terms of a permutation. Let&#39;s let y = x - 3. Then the first term is y, and the next term is y - 1, then y - 2, and so on. Wait, but the original expression is (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). Let me check:If x is a number greater than 13, then each term is (x - 3), (x - 4), ..., (x - 13). Let&#39;s list them out:First term: (x - 3)Second term: (x - 4)Third term: (x - 5)...Last term: (x - 13)So how many terms? As calculated before, 11 terms. So each term is (x - 3 - k) where k ranges from 0 to 10. So, this is equivalent to (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 3 - 10) = (x - 3)(x - 4)...(x - 13). So, that&#39;s 11 terms.If I want to write this as a permutation A(n, k), where n is the starting number and k is the number of terms. Wait, permutation A(n, k) is n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - k + 1). So in this case, the first term is (x - 3), and the last term is (x - 13) which is (x - 3) - 10. So, the number of terms is 11. Therefore, this product is A(x - 3, 11), since we start at (x - 3) and multiply 11 terms, decreasing by 1 each time. So in the notation given, that would be A_{x - 3}^{11}, which is option B.Wait, but let me check again. Let me confirm with an example. Suppose x is 14. Then the expression becomes (14 - 3)(14 - 4)...(14 - 13) = 11 * 10 * ... * 1. That&#39;s 11 terms, which is 11!.But A(n, k) when n = 11 and k = 11 would be 11! / (11 - 11)! = 11! / 0! = 11!, which is correct. But if we use the permutation formula as per the options given, which is A_{x - 3}^{11}. If x is 14, then A_{14 - 3}^{11} = A_{11}^{11} = 11! which matches. Similarly, if x is 15, then the product is 12 * 11 * ... * 2, which is 12! / 1! = 12!.Using the permutation formula, A_{15 - 3}^{11} = A_{12}^{11} = 12! / (12 - 11)! = 12! / 1! = 12!, which matches. So that seems correct.Alternatively, if we look at option D: A_{x - 13}^{11}. If x is 14, then x -13 =1, so A_1^{11} is 1! / (1 - 11)! which is undefined because factorial of a negative number isn&#39;t defined. So D is invalid. Option C: A_{x -13}^{10}. For x=14, x-13=1, so A_1^{10}=1!/(1-10)! which is also undefined. So C is invalid.Option A: A_{x-3}^{10}, so for x=14, that&#39;s A_{11}^{10}=11! / (11 -10)! =11! /1! =11! which is same as the product (11*10*...*1). Wait, but when x=14, the product is 11*10*...*1, which is 11! So A_{11}^{10} is 11*10*...*2 = 11! /1! but wait, no. Wait, A(n, k) = n! / (n -k)! So A_{11}^{10} is 11! / (11 -10)! =11! /1! =11! which is indeed the product. However, when x=14, the product is 11*10*...*1=11! So in this case, A_{x -3}^{10} is 11! But the product is also 11!. Wait, so maybe both A and B can be correct? Wait, but let&#39;s check for x=15.When x=15, the product is (15-3)(15-4)...(15-13) =12*11*10*...*2. That is 12*11*10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2, which is 12! /1! = A_{12}^{11} =12! / (12 -11)! =12! /1! =12! Alternatively, A_{12}^{10} would be 12! / (12 -10)! =12! /2! which is 12*11*10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3, which is different. So the product for x=15 is 12*11*...*2 which is 12! /1! , which is A_{12}^{11}, so that&#39;s option B. So if we had option A: A_{x-3}^{10}, which would be A_{12}^{10} =12! /2! which is not equal to the product. Therefore, for x=15, option B gives the correct result, whereas option A does not. So, the correct answer should be option B: A_{x -3}^{11}Wait, but when x=14, the product is 11! which is A_{11}^{11}, but option B is A_{x -3}^{11}, which when x=14 is A_{11}^{11}, which is indeed 11!. So in that case, both A_{x -3}^{11} and A_{x -3}^{10} would give different results. Wait, for x=14, option A would be A_{11}^{10}=11! /1! =11! which is same as the product. So for x=14, both A and B options give the same result? That can&#39;t be. Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, A_{n}^{k} is n! / (n -k)!. So A_{11}^{10} is 11! / (11 -10)! =11! /1! =11! Similarly, A_{11}^{11} is 11! /0! =11! /1 =11!. So in this case, both A_{11}^{10} and A_{11}^{11} equal 11! So for x=14, both options A and B would give the same result. But when x=15, as before, the product is 12*11*...*2 =12! /1! = A_{12}^{11}, which is option B. If we take option A: A_{12}^{10} =12! /2! which is 12*11*10*...*3, which is not the same as the product (which goes down to 2). Therefore, for x=15, only option B is correct. Therefore, the answer must be B.But then why for x=14 both A and B give the same result? Because when n=k, A_{n}^{k} =n! and when n=k+1, A_{n}^{k} =n! /1! So in the case where n=11, k=10 and k=11 both give 11! because 11! / (11-10)! =11! /1=11! and 11! / (11-11)! =11! /1=11! So in this edge case, it&#39;s the same. But in general, for x&gt;13, x can be 14,15,... So when x=14, both A and B work, but for x=15, only B works. Therefore, the correct general answer is B.Another way: the number of terms is 11. The permutation formula A(n, k) is the product of k terms starting from n. So if we have 11 terms starting from (x-3), then it&#39;s A_{x-3}^{11}. So yes, option B.Therefore, the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The given expression is ((x-3)(x-4)(x-5)ldots(x-12)(x-13)) where (x in mathbb{N}^+) and (x &gt; 13). We need to determine which permutation notation correctly represents this expression.First, we count the number of terms in the product. The terms start from ((x-3)) and end at ((x-13)), which gives us (13 - 3 + 1 = 11) terms.Permutation notation (A(n, k)) represents the product of (k) terms starting from (n) and decreasing by 1 each time. This is calculated as (A(n, k) = frac{n!}{(n - k)!}).For the given expression, the product of 11 terms starting from ((x-3)) can be represented as (A(x-3, 11)). This is because the first term is ((x-3)), the second term is ((x-4)), and so on, down to ((x-13)), which is ((x-3) - 10).To verify, we consider examples:- When (x = 14), the product is (11 times 10 times ldots times 1 = 11!), which is (A_{11}^{11}).- When (x = 15), the product is (12 times 11 times ldots times 2 = frac{12!}{1!} = A_{12}^{11}).Thus, the correct permutation notation is (A_{x-3}^{11}), which corresponds to option B.[boxed{B}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>According to the formula for permutations A_n^m = n(n-1)(n-2)ldots(n-m+1),  let n=x-3, and n-m+1=x-13,  we get m=11.

So, we have the function ( f(x) = e^{t(x-1)} - t ln x ) with ( t &gt; 0 ). Part (I) asks to prove that when ( t = 1 ), ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum. Then part (II) wants us to show that ( f(x) geq 0 ) for all ( x ) where the function is defined, I suppose ( x &gt; 0 ) because of the logarithm.Starting with part (I). If ( t = 1 ), the function becomes ( f(x) = e^{(x-1)} - ln x ). To show that ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum, we need to use calculus, right? So first, check the first derivative at ( x = 1 ). If the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is positive, then it&#39;s a local minimum.Let&#39;s compute the first derivative of ( f(x) ) when ( t = 1 ). The derivative of ( e^{(x-1)} ) with respect to ( x ) is ( e^{(x-1)} ), and the derivative of ( -ln x ) is ( -1/x ). So, ( f&#39;(x) = e^{(x-1)} - frac{1}{x} ).Evaluating at ( x = 1 ): ( f&#39;(1) = e^{0} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 ). So that&#39;s good, the first derivative is zero there. Now, check the second derivative. The second derivative of ( f(x) ) would be the derivative of ( f&#39;(x) ). So, derivative of ( e^{(x-1)} ) is again ( e^{(x-1)} ), and the derivative of ( -1/x ) is ( 1/x^2 ). So, ( f&#39;&#39;(x) = e^{(x-1)} + frac{1}{x^2} ).Evaluating at ( x = 1 ): ( f&#39;&#39;(1) = e^{0} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ), which is positive. Therefore, by the second derivative test, ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum. That should take care of part (I).Now moving on to part (II): Prove that ( f(x) geq 0 ) for all ( x &gt; 0 ), given ( t &gt; 0 ). Hmm. So we need to show that ( e^{t(x-1)} - t ln x geq 0 ).First, let&#39;s think about the function ( f(x) = e^{t(x-1)} - t ln x ). We need to show this is always non-negative. Maybe we can find the minimum of ( f(x) ) and show that the minimum is zero or greater. If we can show that the minimum value is zero, then the function is always above that.To find the minimum, take the derivative of ( f(x) ) with respect to ( x ):( f&#39;(x) = frac{d}{dx} [e^{t(x-1)}] - frac{d}{dx} [t ln x] )Which is ( t e^{t(x-1)} - frac{t}{x} ).Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:( t e^{t(x-1)} - frac{t}{x} = 0 )Divide both sides by ( t ) (since ( t &gt; 0 )):( e^{t(x-1)} - frac{1}{x} = 0 )So, ( e^{t(x-1)} = frac{1}{x} )Take natural logarithm on both sides:( t(x - 1) = -ln x )So, ( t(x - 1) + ln x = 0 )Hmm. So this equation gives the critical points. Let&#39;s denote this equation as ( t(x - 1) + ln x = 0 ). We need to solve for ( x ). But this equation might not have an explicit solution. However, maybe we can show that there&#39;s only one critical point at ( x = 1 ) when ( t = 1 ), but for general ( t &gt; 0 ), perhaps ( x = 1 ) is still a critical point? Wait, if ( x = 1 ), then ( t(0) + ln 1 = 0 + 0 = 0 ), so yes, ( x = 1 ) is always a solution, regardless of ( t ). Wait, but when ( x = 1 ), ( t(x - 1) = 0 ), and ( ln 1 = 0 ). So, x=1 is always a critical point. Interesting.But is that the only critical point? Let&#39;s check. Suppose ( x neq 1 ). Let&#39;s analyze the equation ( t(x - 1) + ln x = 0 ). Let&#39;s rearrange it as ( ln x = -t(x - 1) ). Let&#39;s consider the function ( g(x) = ln x + t(x - 1) ). We want to find the roots of ( g(x) = 0 ).Compute ( g(1) = ln 1 + t(0) = 0 ), so x=1 is always a root. To check if there are other roots, let&#39;s look at the derivative of ( g(x) ):( g&#39;(x) = frac{1}{x} + t ). Since ( x &gt; 0 ), ( frac{1}{x} &gt; 0 ), and ( t &gt; 0 ), so ( g&#39;(x) &gt; 0 ) for all ( x &gt; 0 ). Therefore, ( g(x) ) is strictly increasing. Since it&#39;s strictly increasing and already has a root at x=1, there can be no other roots. Therefore, x=1 is the only critical point.Therefore, for any ( t &gt; 0 ), the function ( f(x) ) has only one critical point at x=1. Now, to check whether this critical point is a minimum or maximum. Let&#39;s compute the second derivative for general t.The second derivative ( f&#39;&#39;(x) ):First derivative is ( f&#39;(x) = t e^{t(x - 1)} - frac{t}{x} ).Differentiate again:( f&#39;&#39;(x) = t^2 e^{t(x - 1)} + frac{t}{x^2} ).Since ( t &gt; 0 ) and ( x &gt; 0 ), both terms ( t^2 e^{t(x - 1)} ) and ( frac{t}{x^2} ) are positive. Therefore, ( f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0 ) for all ( x &gt; 0 ). Therefore, the function ( f(x) ) is convex everywhere, and the critical point at x=1 is a global minimum.Therefore, if we can show that the minimum value at x=1 is zero, then ( f(x) geq 0 ) for all x &gt; 0.Compute ( f(1) ):( f(1) = e^{t(1 - 1)} - t ln 1 = e^{0} - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 ).Wait, that contradicts the assertion that the minimum is zero? Wait, hold on. Wait, when x=1, f(1) = 1, not zero. But the problem says to prove that ( f(x) geq 0 ). Hmm. But 1 is greater than 0, so maybe the minimum is 1? But that can&#39;t be. Wait, let&#39;s check the function again.Wait, if t is a positive constant, but when t=1, part (I) says that x=1 is a local minimum. But when t=1, f(1)=1, which is positive. But the problem in part (II) states to prove that ( f(x) geq 0 ). So perhaps the problem is misstated? Wait, but maybe the function is always greater or equal to zero for any t&gt;0. Wait, let&#39;s check for t=1, f(x)=e^{x-1} - ln x. We need to see if this is always non-negative.Wait, when x approaches 0 from the right, ln x approaches negative infinity, so -ln x approaches positive infinity. However, e^{t(x-1)} when x approaches 0 becomes e^{-t}, which is finite. Therefore, as x approaches 0+, f(x) tends to infinity. At x=1, f(1)=1. When x approaches infinity, e^{t(x-1)} grows exponentially, while -t ln x grows to negative infinity, but the exponential term dominates, so f(x) tends to infinity. So, maybe the function has a minimum at x=1 where f(1)=1, so the function is always greater or equal to 1? But the problem states f(x) ≥ 0. But 1 is greater than 0, so that would still hold. Wait, but if the minimum is 1, then f(x) is always ≥1, which is even stronger. But maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, when t is arbitrary, let&#39;s check f(1):f(1) = e^{t(1 -1)} - t ln 1 = e^0 - 0 = 1. So regardless of t&gt;0, f(1)=1, and since x=1 is the global minimum, then f(x) ≥1 for all x&gt;0. But the problem says to prove that f(x) ≥0, which would be true if the minimum is 1, but maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Wait, let&#39;s check for t=1, the function at x=1 is 1, but maybe when t is different?Wait, let&#39;s take t=2, for example. Then f(x)=e^{2(x-1)} - 2 ln x. Then at x=1, f(1)=1 -0=1. The minimum is still 1, so f(x)≥1. But the problem says prove f(x)≥0, which is weaker. So why does the problem state f(x)≥0? Maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation here. Wait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding.Wait, let&#39;s check for some specific value. Let me take t=1 and x=1, f(1)=1. Let&#39;s take x=2, t=1: f(2)=e^{1(2-1)} -1 ln 2= e^1 - ln2 ≈ 2.718 - 0.693 ≈2.025&gt;0. Take x=0.5, t=1: f(0.5)=e^{1*(0.5-1)} -1*ln0.5= e^{-0.5} - (-ln2)≈0.606 +0.693≈1.299&gt;0. So indeed, when t=1, the function seems to be always greater than 1, but actually, at x=1, it&#39;s 1, and higher elsewhere. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, f(1)=1 for any t&gt;0. So if the global minimum is 1, then f(x)≥1&gt;0, so indeed f(x)≥0. So the problem statement is correct. But the stronger statement would be f(x)≥1, but maybe the question just wants us to show it&#39;s non-negative. So that&#39;s okay.Wait, but why then part (I) says to prove x=1 is a local minimum when t=1. But in general, as we saw, x=1 is always the global minimum for any t&gt;0. So perhaps part (I) is just a specific case. Anyway, moving on.So, since we have shown that for any t&gt;0, the function f(x) has a unique critical point at x=1, which is a global minimum because the function is convex, and the value at x=1 is f(1)=1, which is positive. Therefore, f(x) is always greater than or equal to 1, which is certainly greater than 0. Hence, f(x) ≥1≥0. Therefore, the conclusion holds. Therefore, part (II) is proved.But wait, the problem says to prove f(x)≥0, but actually f(x) is always at least 1, so maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in my analysis.Wait, let&#39;s double-check. Let me compute f(1) again. When x=1, regardless of t, f(1)=e^{0} - t*0=1-0=1. So that&#39;s correct. Then, since x=1 is the global minimum, and the function tends to infinity as x approaches 0 or infinity, then yes, the function is always greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, f(x)≥1≥0. So the inequality f(x)≥0 is true, but it&#39;s actually a weaker statement than the reality. Therefore, the answer holds.But maybe I misread the problem? Let me check again. The problem states: &quot;f(x) = e^{t(x-1)} - t ln x&quot;. Yes, and part (II) says &quot;Prove that f(x) ≥ 0&quot;. Well, as we saw, since the minimum is 1, which is positive, then indeed f(x) is always at least 1, which is more than 0. So the problem&#39;s statement is correct. Therefore, our reasoning is okay.Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe there is a different interpretation. Let me check when t is variable. Wait, no, t is a positive constant. For each fixed t&gt;0, f(x) is defined for x&gt;0. The function has a unique critical point at x=1, which is a global minimum, and f(1)=1. So, f(x)≥1 for all x&gt;0, t&gt;0. Therefore, f(x)≥0 is certainly true.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement, and part (II) was meant to say f(x)≥1? But since the user wrote the problem as is, we have to go with that.Therefore, the conclusion is that f(x) is minimized at x=1 with f(1)=1, which is greater than zero, so indeed f(x)≥0.Therefore, part (II) is proved.But let me see if there&#39;s another approach. Maybe using inequalities like the exponential function is always greater than or equal to 1 plus its argument, or something like that. Let&#39;s explore that.We know that for any real number y, ( e^y geq 1 + y ). Let&#39;s set y = t(x - 1). Then, ( e^{t(x - 1)} geq 1 + t(x - 1) ).Therefore, ( f(x) = e^{t(x - 1)} - t ln x geq 1 + t(x - 1) - t ln x ).So, ( f(x) geq 1 + t(x - 1) - t ln x ). Hmm, can we show that this expression is non-negative?Let me denote ( h(x) = 1 + t(x - 1) - t ln x ). If we can show ( h(x) geq 0 ), then ( f(x) geq h(x) geq 0 ).Compute ( h(x) = 1 + t(x - 1) - t ln x ).Let&#39;s check h(1): h(1) =1 +0 -0=1.Take derivative of h(x): h’(x) = t - t/x = t(1 - 1/x). Setting derivative to zero: t(1 -1/x)=0 =&gt; 1 -1/x=0 =&gt;x=1. So h(x) has critical point at x=1. Second derivative: h&#39;&#39;(x) = t/x² &gt;0. Therefore, x=1 is a local minimum. And h(1)=1. Therefore, h(x) ≥1 for all x&gt;0, so h(x) ≥1, which gives f(x)≥1. So again, f(x) is at least 1. Therefore, f(x)≥0 is true.Alternatively, perhaps even a different inequality. Wait, but the problem might have expected a different approach. For example, using the inequality between arithmetic and geometric means, or convexity.Alternatively, considering the function f(x) and trying to show that it&#39;s always non-negative. Since we know the minimum is 1, perhaps 1 is the minimal value, but since the problem only asks for non-negativity, maybe they just want us to recognize the minimum is positive.But in any case, since the problem says to prove f(x)≥0, and we have shown that the minimum value is 1, which is positive, then the inequality holds.Therefore, part (II) is proved.But let me check for some t and x where maybe f(x) could be lower. Wait, take t approaching 0. If t approaches 0, then f(x) = e^{0} - 0*ln x =1 -0=1. So for t approaching 0, the function is identically 1. For t very large, say t=1000, then at x=1, f(1)=1, but for x near 1, the exponential term would dominate. For x slightly greater than 1, e^{1000(x-1)} would be enormous, and -1000 ln x would be negative but maybe not as big. For x slightly less than 1, e^{1000(x-1)} becomes e^{-1000(1 -x)}, which is nearly zero, but then -1000 ln x would be positive because ln x is negative (since x &lt;1). So, as x approaches 0, -1000 ln x approaches infinity, so f(x) approaches infinity. So, regardless of t, the function&#39;s minimum is at x=1, and f(1)=1. Therefore, the function is always at least 1, hence non-negative.So, conclusion: For part (I), when t=1, x=1 is a local minimum, which we showed by computing the first and second derivatives. For part (II), since x=1 is the global minimum for any t&gt;0, and f(1)=1≥0, therefore f(x)≥0 for all x&gt;0.Final Answer(I) boxed{x=1} is a local minimum point.  (II) boxed{f(x) geqslant 0}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = e^{t(x-1)} - t ln x ) where ( t &gt; 0 ):(I) If ( t = 1 ), prove that ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum point of the function ( f(x) ):1.

Evaluate the second derivative at ( x = 1 ): ( f&#39;&#39;(1) = e^{0} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ), which is positive.6. Since the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is positive at ( x = 1 ), ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum.(II) Prove that ( f(x) geq 0 ):1. Compute the first derivative of ( f(x) ) for general ( t ): ( f&#39;(x) = t e^{t(x-1)} - frac{t}{x} ).2. Set the first derivative to zero to find critical points: ( t e^{t(x-1)} = frac{t}{x} ), which simplifies to ( e^{t(x-1)} = frac{1}{x} ).3. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides gives ( t(x - 1) + ln x = 0 ). Solving this, we find ( x = 1 ) is a critical point.4. Compute the second derivative: ( f&#39;&#39;(x) = t^2 e^{t(x-1)} + frac{t}{x^2} ), which is always positive for ( x &gt; 0 ) and ( t &gt; 0 ), indicating convexity.5. Since ( f(x) ) is convex, ( x = 1 ) is a global minimum.6. Evaluate ( f(1) ): ( f(1) = e^{0} - t ln 1 = 1 - 0 = 1 ), which is the minimum value.7. Since the minimum value is 1, which is greater than 0, ( f(x) geq 1 geq 0 ) for all ( x &gt; 0 ). Final Answer(I) boxed{x=1} is a local minimum point.  (II) boxed{f(x) geqslant 0},&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. First, the function is given as ( f(x) = e^{t(x - 1)} - t ln x ) with ( t &gt; 0 ). The problem has two parts: part (I) asks to prove that when ( t = 1 ), ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum, and part (II) requires proving that ( f(x) geq 0 ) for all ( x ) in the domain, I suppose.Starting with part (I). If ( t = 1 ), then the function simplifies to ( f(x) = e^{(x - 1)} - ln x ). We need to show that ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum. To do this, I remember that for a function to have a local minimum at a point, the first derivative should be zero there, and the second derivative should be positive (concave upwards).First, let&#39;s compute the first derivative ( f&#39;(x) ). The derivative of ( e^{(x - 1)} ) with respect to ( x ) is ( e^{(x - 1)} ), and the derivative of ( - ln x ) is ( -1/x ). So, ( f&#39;(x) = e^{(x - 1)} - frac{1}{x} ).Now, evaluate this at ( x = 1 ): ( f&#39;(1) = e^{0} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 ). So, the first derivative is zero at ( x = 1 ), which is a necessary condition for a local extremum.Next, compute the second derivative ( f&#39;&#39;(x) ). The derivative of ( e^{(x - 1)} ) is still ( e^{(x - 1)} ), and the derivative of ( -1/x ) is ( 1/x^2 ). So, ( f&#39;&#39;(x) = e^{(x - 1)} + frac{1}{x^2} ).Evaluate the second derivative at ( x = 1 ): ( f&#39;&#39;(1) = e^{0} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ), which is positive. Since the second derivative is positive, the function is concave upwards at ( x = 1 ), confirming that it&#39;s a local minimum. So part (I) seems done. But let me double-check if there are any other critical points or if something is missing. Wait, maybe we need to check if there are other critical points? The problem only asks to prove that ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum when ( t = 1 ), so even if there are other critical points, as long as we showed that at ( x = 1 ) the first derivative is zero and the second is positive, then it&#39;s a local minimum. So I think that&#39;s sufficient for part (I).Now moving on to part (II): Prove that ( f(x) geq 0 ) for all ( x &gt; 0 ) (since ( ln x ) is defined for ( x &gt; 0 )) and ( t &gt; 0 ). So, the function is ( e^{t(x - 1)} - t ln x ). We need to show that this is always non-negative.First, perhaps analyzing the function&#39;s behavior. Let&#39;s consider critical points for general ( t ). Maybe find the minimum of the function and show that the minimum value is zero or greater.Compute the first derivative: ( f&#39;(x) = t e^{t(x - 1)} - frac{t}{x} ). Factor out ( t ): ( f&#39;(x) = t left( e^{t(x - 1)} - frac{1}{x} right) ).To find critical points, set ( f&#39;(x) = 0 ). Since ( t &gt; 0 ), this implies ( e^{t(x - 1)} = frac{1}{x} ).This equation might be tricky to solve analytically. Maybe there&#39;s a particular solution? Let&#39;s test ( x = 1 ). If ( x = 1 ), left side becomes ( e^{0} = 1 ), and right side is ( 1 ). So ( x = 1 ) is a critical point for any ( t &gt; 0 ). Wait, when ( x = 1 ), the derivative is ( t(1 - 1) = 0 ), so yes, ( x = 1 ) is a critical point.Now, check the value of ( f(x) ) at ( x = 1 ). Compute ( f(1) = e^{0} - t ln 1 = 1 - 0 = 1 ). So the function has value 1 at ( x = 1 ). Hmm, but the problem says to prove that ( f(x) geq 0 ), so maybe 1 is the minimum value? Wait, but in part (II) they don&#39;t specify ( t = 1 ), so the function is for general ( t &gt; 0 ). Wait, but if ( t = 1 ), at ( x = 1 ), the value is 1, but for other ( t ), at ( x = 1 ), it&#39;s still ( 1 - t cdot 0 = 1 ). So regardless of ( t ), ( f(1) = 1 ), which is positive.But maybe the function has a minimum at ( x = 1 ), and since ( f(1) = 1 geq 0 ), and the function is always above that? Wait, but if we can show that ( x = 1 ) is the global minimum, then since ( f(1) = 1 geq 0 ), then ( f(x) geq 1 geq 0 ). But that&#39;s not necessarily the case. Wait, but maybe for some ( t ), the function could dip below zero? Wait, but the problem says to prove that ( f(x) geq 0 ), so perhaps regardless of ( t &gt; 0 ), the function is always non-negative. So maybe the minimum of the function is zero? But when ( x = 1 ), it&#39;s 1. So maybe there&#39;s another critical point where the function is zero? Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps the minimum of the function is 0, achieved at some point, and otherwise, it&#39;s positive. Let me check for specific values.Take ( t = 1 ), then ( f(x) = e^{x - 1} - ln x ). Let&#39;s check ( x = 1 ): 1 - 0 = 1. What about ( x ) approaching 0 from the right? ( e^{x - 1} ) approaches ( e^{-1} approx 0.3679 ), and ( - ln x ) goes to infinity. So ( f(x) ) approaches infinity. As ( x ) approaches infinity, ( e^{t(x - 1)} ) grows exponentially, and ( - t ln x ) grows negatively, but the exponential term dominates, so ( f(x) ) tends to infinity. So the function tends to infinity at both ends. So maybe it has a minimum somewhere in between. For ( t = 1 ), in part (I), we saw that ( x = 1 ) is a local minimum. But the value there is 1, which is positive. So in this case, the function is always greater than or equal to 1. Wait, but the problem statement says to prove ( f(x) geq 0 ). So perhaps even though the minimum is 1, it&#39;s still non-negative. But the problem says &quot;prove that ( f(x) geq 0 )&quot;, which is weaker than the actual minimum being 1. So maybe for all ( t &gt; 0 ), the function is always non-negative. Wait, but perhaps for some ( t ), the minimum dips to zero? Let&#39;s check.Suppose we take another value of ( t ). Let&#39;s say ( t = 2 ). Then ( f(x) = e^{2(x - 1)} - 2 ln x ). Let&#39;s check ( x = 1 ): f(1) = 1 - 0 = 1. Compute the derivative at ( x = 1 ): f&#39;(1) = 2 e^{0} - 2/1 = 2 - 2 = 0. So x=1 is a critical point. Second derivative: f&#39;&#39;(1) = 2*2 e^{0} + 2/(1)^2 = 4 + 2 = 6 &gt; 0. So x=1 is a local minimum with f(1)=1. So again, the function is minimized at 1. But 1 is positive, so f(x) &gt;= 1 &gt;= 0. Hmm. So if for all t &gt;0, the minimum is at x=1 and f(1)=1, then f(x) is always greater or equal to 1, which is certainly &gt;=0. But then why does the problem ask to prove f(x) &gt;=0? Maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Wait, perhaps when t is varying, the critical point isn&#39;t always at x=1? Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, for general t &gt;0, the first derivative is f&#39;(x) = t e^{t(x -1)} - t / x. Setting that equal to zero gives e^{t(x -1)} = 1/x. So x=1 is a solution because e^{0}=1 and 1/x=1. But maybe there are other solutions? For example, let&#39;s take t=1. Then equation e^{x-1} = 1/x. Let&#39;s see if x=1 is the only solution. At x=1, both sides are 1. For x &lt;1, say x=0.5, e^{-0.5} ≈0.606, and 1/0.5=2. So left side is less than right. For x=2, e^{1}≈2.718, 1/2=0.5. Left side is greater. So the function e^{x-1} -1/x crosses zero at x=1. Let&#39;s check its derivative: derivative of left side e^{x-1} is increasing, derivative of right side 1/x is decreasing. So maybe x=1 is the only solution. Thus, for t=1, x=1 is the only critical point. Similarly, for other t? Let&#39;s take t=2. The equation is e^{2(x-1)}=1/x. Let&#39;s check x=0.5: e^{2(-0.5)}=e^{-1}≈0.367, 1/0.5=2. So left &lt; right. x=1: left=1, right=1. x=2: left=e^{2(1)}=e^2≈7.389, right=0.5. So left &gt; right. The function e^{2(x-1)} -1/x is increasing for x&gt;0.5? Wait, the derivative of left side is 2 e^{2(x-1)}, and the derivative of right side is -1/x^2. So the derivative of the left side minus right side is 2 e^{2(x-1)} +1/x^2, which is always positive. Therefore, the function e^{2(x-1)} -1/x is strictly increasing. Since at x=1, it&#39;s zero. So for x&lt;1, it&#39;s negative, and x&gt;1, positive. Therefore, the equation e^{2(x-1)}=1/x has only one solution at x=1. Hence, for t=2, x=1 is the only critical point. Similarly, perhaps for any t&gt;0, the equation e^{t(x-1)}=1/x has only x=1 as a solution. Let&#39;s check.Suppose we let y = x -1, so x =1 + y. Then the equation becomes e^{t y} = 1/(1 + y). Let&#39;s see for y ≠0, can this hold? For y&gt;0: e^{t y} &gt;1, and 1/(1 + y) &lt;1, so e^{t y} &gt;1/(1 + y). For y&lt;0: e^{t y} &lt;1, and 1/(1 + y) &gt;1 (since 1 + y &lt;1), but let&#39;s see. Suppose y approaches -1 from above (so 1 + y approaches 0 from above). Then 1/(1 + y) approaches infinity, while e^{t y} approaches e^{-t}, which is finite. Therefore, for y approaching -1, e^{t y} -1/(1 + y) approaches negative infinity. At y=0, it&#39;s 1 -1 =0. So if we consider the function g(y)=e^{t y} -1/(1 + y), then at y=0, it&#39;s zero. The derivative of g(y) is t e^{t y} +1/(1 + y)^2. Since t&gt;0 and e^{t y} &gt;0, and 1/(1 + y)^2 &gt;0 for all y &gt; -1, so g&#39;(y) is always positive. Therefore, the function g(y) is strictly increasing. Since at y=0, g(0)=0, and for y&gt;0, g(y) &gt;0, and for y approaching -1 from above, g(y) approaches -infty. Therefore, there must be another solution y &lt;0 where g(y)=0. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier thought that x=1 is the only critical point. Hmm, so perhaps for t&gt;0, there are two critical points: one at x=1 and another at x &lt;1? Wait, but when we took t=1 and t=2, in numerical examples, x=1 was the only critical point. Wait, perhaps my analysis is wrong.Wait, let&#39;s take t=1 again, and the equation e^{y}=1/(1 + y). For y approaching -1 from above, the right side 1/(1 + y) approaches infinity, left side e^{y} approaches e^{-1}. So for y approaching -1+, g(y)= e^{y} -1/(1 + y) approaches -infty. At y=0, g(0)=1 -1=0. The derivative g&#39;(y)=e^{y} +1/(1 + y)^2, which is always positive. Therefore, since the function is strictly increasing from -infty to 0 as y goes from -1 to 0, and then increasing beyond, then there must be exactly one solution at y=0. Wait, but if the function is strictly increasing and passes from -infty to 0 at y=0, then there is only one solution at y=0. So, x=1 is the only critical point. Wait, but if the function is strictly increasing over its entire domain (y &gt; -1), then it can only cross zero once. Therefore, for any t&gt;0, the equation e^{t y} =1/(1 + y) has only one solution at y=0 (x=1). Hence, x=1 is the only critical point.Therefore, for any t&gt;0, x=1 is the only critical point. Then, since the second derivative at x=1 is f&#39;&#39;(1)= t^2 e^{0} + t/(1)^2 = t^2 + t. Since t&gt;0, this is always positive. Therefore, x=1 is the only critical point and it&#39;s a local minimum. Since the function tends to infinity as x approaches 0+ and infinity, then x=1 must be the global minimum. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is f(1)=1, which is positive. Therefore, f(x) &gt;=1 &gt;=0. Hence, part (II) is proved.Wait, but the problem says to prove that f(x) &gt;=0. If the minimum is 1, then f(x) &gt;=1, which is stronger. So maybe the problem statement has a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, let me check for t=0.5. Let&#39;s take t=0.5. Then f(x) = e^{0.5(x -1)} -0.5 ln x. At x=1, f(1)=1. Compute the derivative: f&#39;(x)=0.5 e^{0.5(x-1)} -0.5/x. Setting to zero: e^{0.5(x-1)} =1/x. Let&#39;s see if x=1 is the only solution. Let y =0.5(x -1). Then x=2y +1. The equation becomes e^{y} =1/(2y +1). Let&#39;s check y=0: e^0=1, 1/(0 +1)=1. So y=0 is a solution (x=1). Let&#39;s see for y &lt;0: Let y=-0.5, then x=2*(-0.5)+1=0. The equation becomes e^{-0.5} ≈0.606 vs 1/(0 +1)=1. Left side &lt; right. For y approaching -0.5 from above (since x&gt;0), y approaches -0.5, x approaches 0, right side approaches infinity. So e^{y} approaches e^{-0.5}≈0.606, so left side is less than right. For y&gt;0: e^{y} &gt;1, and 1/(2y +1) &lt;1. So left side &gt; right. So the function e^{y} -1/(2y +1) is increasing? Let&#39;s check the derivative: derivative of e^{y} is e^{y}, derivative of -1/(2y +1) is 2/(2y +1)^2. So total derivative is e^{y} + 2/(2y +1)^2, which is always positive. Therefore, the function is strictly increasing. Therefore, the equation e^{y}=1/(2y +1) has only one solution at y=0 (x=1). Therefore, x=1 is the only critical point, which is a minimum. Thus, the minimum value is f(1)=1, so f(x)&gt;=1&gt;=0. Therefore, the function is always greater or equal to 1, hence non-negative.But the problem says to prove f(x)&gt;=0. Since we have f(x)&gt;=1, which is stronger, so the problem&#39;s statement is still satisfied. Maybe the problem intended to state f(x)&gt;=1, but perhaps in the original problem, there was a different function. Wait, let me check the original problem again.Original problem: ( f(x) = e^{t(x -1)} - t ln x ), t&gt;0. Part (I) for t=1, prove x=1 is a local minimum. Part (II) Prove that f(x)&gt;=0.But according to our analysis, for all t&gt;0, x=1 is the global minimum with f(1)=1, so f(x)&gt;=1. Therefore, f(x)&gt;=0 is automatically satisfied. Hence, part (II) is proven.Wait, but maybe the problem is mistyped? Or perhaps there is a different function? Let me verify once again with t=1 and x approaching 1. If x approaches 1, the function is approximately 1 + (x-1) + (x-1)^2/2 - (x -1 - (x-1)^2/2 + ... ) Wait, but that&#39;s expanding e^{x-1} and ln x around x=1. Let me do a Taylor expansion around x=1 for t=1.Let x =1 + h, where h is small. Then f(x)=e^{h} - ln(1 + h). Expand e^{h} ≈1 + h + h^2/2 + h^3/6. ln(1 + h)≈h - h^2/2 + h^3/3. So f(x)≈ [1 + h + h^2/2 + h^3/6] - [h - h^2/2 + h^3/3] =1 + h + h^2/2 + h^3/6 -h + h^2/2 - h^3/3 =1 + h^2/2 + h^2/2 + (h^3/6 - h^3/3) =1 + h^2 - h^3/6. So near x=1, the function is approximately 1 + h^2, which is consistent with f(x) having a minimum of 1 at x=1. Therefore, even locally, f(x) is above 1. Hence, globally, f(x) is always above 1, which is non-negative. So part (II) is proven.But the problem says &quot;Prove that f(x) ≥ 0&quot;. Since 1 ≥0, this is true. So maybe the problem is correctly stated, and the answer is that since the minimum is 1, which is non-negative, hence f(x) is always non-negative.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s another approach where you can show that ( e^{t(x -1)} geq t ln x ) for all x &gt;0 and t &gt;0. Maybe using inequalities like the exponential function is always greater than or equal to 1 + x, or using convexity.Alternatively, consider the inequality ( e^{a} geq 1 + a ). If we set ( a = t(x -1) - ln x ), but that might not lead directly.Alternatively, maybe using the inequality ( e^y geq 1 + y ), which holds for all y. Let&#39;s see. If we set ( y = t(x -1) - ln x ), but not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the function ( f(x) = e^{t(x -1)} - t ln x ). Let&#39;s fix x and consider it as a function of t. Wait, but the problem states t &gt;0, so for each x&gt;0, t is a positive parameter. Wait, no, the function is f(x) with parameter t. So perhaps for each x&gt;0, and t&gt;0, show that e^{t(x -1)} ≥ t ln x.Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let’s let u = x -1, then x =1 + u. Then the inequality becomes ( e^{t u} geq t ln(1 + u) ). But not sure.Alternatively, fix t &gt;0 and analyze f(x). As we saw before, the function f(x) has a unique critical point at x=1, which is a global minimum, and f(1)=1. Therefore, f(x) ≥1 ≥0 for all x&gt;0, t&gt;0. Therefore, the conclusion holds. Hence, part (II) is proven.So in summary, for part (I), when t=1, x=1 is a local minimum since first derivative is zero and second derivative positive. For part (II), for any t&gt;0, x=1 is the only critical point, a global minimum, with f(1)=1, hence f(x) ≥1 ≥0. Therefore, the inequality holds.Final Answer(I) boxed{x = 1} is a local minimum point.(II) boxed{f(x) geqslant 0}&lt;/think&gt;(I) For ( t = 1 ), the function is ( f(x) = e^{(x-1)} - ln x ).

Testing ( x = 1 ), we find ( e^0 = 1 ), so ( x = 1 ) is a critical point.3. Compute the second derivative: ( f&#39;&#39;(x) = t^2 e^{t(x-1)} + frac{t}{x^2} ).

I need to find the possible values of &#39;a&#39; such that the intersection of sets A and B is empty. That means the two sets don&#39;t have any common elements, right? So, sets A and B are both sets of ordered pairs (x, y), which represent lines or maybe something else. Let me first understand what each set is.Starting with set A: It&#39;s defined as all (x, y) such that (y - 3)/(x - 2) = a + 1. Hmm. This looks like the equation of a line, except that it&#39;s written in a slope-point form. The formula (y - y1)/(x - x1) = slope is a way to write the equation of a line passing through the point (x1, y1) with a given slope. So here, the line passes through (2, 3) and has a slope of (a + 1). So set A is the line y - 3 = (a + 1)(x - 2), except when x = 2 because the original expression would be undefined there. Wait, but in the set A, they have (x, y) such that (y - 3)/(x - 2) = a + 1. So that would exclude the point (2, 3) because the denominator becomes zero. But actually, when x approaches 2, y approaches 3, but the point (2, 3) itself isn&#39;t included in set A because the equation is undefined there. So set A is the line with slope (a + 1) passing through (2, 3), but missing the point (2, 3).Now set B is given by the equation (a² - 1)x + (a - 1)y = 15. This is a linear equation in x and y, so it&#39;s also a line. The coefficients of x and y depend on &#39;a&#39;. So depending on the value of &#39;a&#39;, this line can change.We need to find the values of &#39;a&#39; where A and B have no intersection. So, when are two lines parallel and distinct? If they are parallel, meaning they have the same slope but different y-intercepts, then they don&#39;t intersect. Alternatively, if they are not parallel, they will intersect at exactly one point, unless they are the same line. But in this case, since set A is missing a point, even if the lines are the same, their intersection might still be empty if the missing point is the only intersection. Wait, no. If the lines are the same, then their intersection would be set A minus the point (2, 3). But set B is the entire line. So if lines A and B are the same, then their intersection would be set A, which is missing (2, 3). But set B includes all points on that line, so their intersection would be set A. Wait, but set A is missing a point, so the intersection would be set A. But since set B is a line, which includes all points on that line except maybe (2, 3) if when x=2, y=3 satisfies B&#39;s equation? Wait, maybe I need to check if the point (2, 3) is on set B.If (2, 3) is on set B, then B includes that point, while A doesn&#39;t. So if lines A and B are the same line, then their intersection would be A, which is the line without (2, 3). But if (2, 3) is on B, then B contains that point, but A doesn&#39;t. So the intersection would still be A. But the problem states A ∩ B = ∅. So if the lines are the same, then their intersection is A, which is not empty unless A is empty, which it isn&#39;t. So in that case, even if lines are the same, the intersection is A, which is non-empty, unless maybe (2,3) is not on B. Wait, no. Let&#39;s check if (2,3) is on B.Let me substitute x=2 and y=3 into B&#39;s equation: (a² -1)*2 + (a -1)*3 = 15. Let&#39;s compute this: 2(a² -1) + 3(a -1) = 2a² -2 + 3a -3 = 2a² +3a -5. Set this equal to 15? So 2a² +3a -5 =15 → 2a² +3a -20=0. Solving this quadratic equation: discriminant = 9 + 160 = 169, sqrt(169)=13. So a = [-3 ±13]/4. So a = (10)/4=2.5 or a=(-16)/4=-4. So when a=5/2 or a=-4, then (2,3) is on B. Otherwise, (2,3) is not on B.So if lines A and B are the same line, then the intersection A ∩ B would be set A (since B includes all points on the line except when (2,3) is not on B). But if (2,3) is on B, then B contains all points on the line including (2,3), so the intersection would be all points of A plus (2,3). But A doesn&#39;t include (2,3), so the intersection would still be A. Wait, no. If the lines are the same, then B is the entire line, and A is the entire line except (2,3). So their intersection would be A, which is not empty. Therefore, even if lines are the same, the intersection is A, which is non-empty unless A is empty. But A is a line missing a point, so it&#39;s not empty. Therefore, if lines A and B are the same, then the intersection is A, which is not empty. Hence, to have A ∩ B = empty set, the lines must be parallel and distinct. Therefore, the possible values of &#39;a&#39; would be those that make the lines parallel and not coinciding.Alternatively, there&#39;s another possibility. If the lines are not parallel but they intersect only at the point (2,3), which is excluded from set A. Then the intersection would be empty. So that&#39;s another scenario. So we have two cases:1. The lines are parallel and distinct (so they don&#39;t intersect at all).2. The lines are not parallel, but their only point of intersection is (2,3), which is not in set A.So we need to consider both cases.First, let&#39;s find when the lines are parallel. For two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal.The slope of set A: we already know it&#39;s (a + 1). For set B, we need to find the slope. Let&#39;s rewrite the equation of B in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).Starting with (a² -1)x + (a -1)y =15.Solve for y:(a -1)y = - (a² -1)x +15If a ≠ 1, we can divide both sides by (a -1):y = [ - (a² -1) / (a -1) ] x + 15 / (a -1)Simplify the coefficient of x:-(a² -1)/(a -1) = -[(a -1)(a +1)] / (a -1) = -(a +1) [since (a² -1) factors into (a -1)(a +1), and we cancel (a -1) provided a ≠1]So the slope of line B is - (a +1), provided that a ≠1. If a =1, the original equation becomes (1 -1)x + (1 -1)y =15 → 0x +0y=15, which is 0=15, which is impossible. So when a=1, set B is empty. Therefore, if a=1, set B is empty, so A ∩ B would also be empty. So a=1 is a possible value. But we need to check that.Wait, set B when a=1 becomes 0x +0y=15, which has no solutions, so B is empty. Therefore, A ∩ B is also empty because B is empty. So a=1 is a possible value.But let&#39;s get back to the slopes. If a ≠1, then slope of B is - (a +1). The slope of A is (a +1). So for the lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. So:Slope of A: (a +1)Slope of B: - (a +1) [when a ≠1]So setting them equal:(a +1) = - (a +1)Which implies:(a +1) + (a +1) =02(a +1) =0a +1=0a= -1So if a= -1, then the slopes are equal. So lines A and B would be parallel. But we need to check if they are distinct. If they are parallel and distinct, then A ∩ B is empty. If they are the same line, then A ∩ B would be set A, which is non-empty.So let&#39;s check when a=-1, are lines A and B the same?First, set A when a=-1: The equation is (y -3)/(x -2)= (-1)+1=0. So (y -3)/(x -2)=0 implies y -3=0, so y=3. But x ≠2, so set A is the line y=3 with the point (2,3) excluded.Set B when a=-1: Let&#39;s plug a=-1 into B&#39;s equation:((-1)^2 -1)x + (-1 -1)y =15(1 -1)x + (-2)y =150x -2y =15-2y =15y= -15/2So set B is the line y= -15/2. Which is a horizontal line different from y=3. So set A is y=3 without (2,3), set B is y=-15/2. These are parallel lines (both horizontal) and distinct, so they don&#39;t intersect. Therefore, when a=-1, A and B are parallel and distinct, so their intersection is empty. So a=-1 is a valid solution.Now, moving on to the other case: when the lines are not parallel but intersect only at the excluded point (2,3). So if the lines intersect at (2,3), but (2,3) is not in set A, then A ∩ B would be empty. So even though the lines intersect, the point of intersection is excluded from A, so the intersection is empty.So we need to find values of &#39;a&#39; where the lines A and B intersect only at (2,3), which is not in A. To check this, we can solve for the intersection points of A and B, and ensure that the only solution is (2,3), which is excluded.First, let&#39;s write the equations of A and B.Set A: y -3 = (a +1)(x -2), x ≠2Set B: (a² -1)x + (a -1)y =15We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let&#39;s substitute y from set A into set B&#39;s equation.From set A: y = (a +1)(x -2) +3Plug into B&#39;s equation:(a² -1)x + (a -1)[(a +1)(x -2) +3] =15Let&#39;s expand this:(a² -1)x + (a -1)(a +1)(x -2) + 3(a -1) =15Note that (a -1)(a +1) = a² -1. So:(a² -1)x + (a² -1)(x -2) +3(a -1) =15Factor out (a² -1):(a² -1)[x + (x -2)] +3(a -1) =15Simplify inside the brackets:x + x -2 = 2x -2So:(a² -1)(2x -2) +3(a -1) =15Factor out 2 from the first term:2(a² -1)(x -1) +3(a -1) =15Now, let&#39;s try to solve for x.First, let&#39;s note that if a² -1=0, which happens when a=1 or a=-1. But we already considered a=-1 earlier, and a=1 makes set B empty. So if a≠1 and a≠-1, then a² -1≠0, so we can proceed.So let&#39;s assume a≠1 and a≠-1. Then:2(a² -1)(x -1) +3(a -1) =15Let me isolate x:2(a² -1)(x -1) =15 -3(a -1)Divide both sides by 2(a² -1):x -1 = [15 -3(a -1)] / [2(a² -1)]Simplify the numerator:15 -3(a -1) =15 -3a +3=18 -3aSo:x -1 = (18 -3a)/[2(a² -1)]Then:x =1 + (18 -3a)/[2(a² -1)]Now, let&#39;s compute x:x = [2(a² -1) +18 -3a]/[2(a² -1)]Numerator:2a² -2 +18 -3a =2a² -3a +16Therefore:x=(2a² -3a +16)/(2(a² -1))Now, once we have x, we can find y using the equation from set A:y = (a +1)(x -2) +3But let&#39;s check if x=2. If x=2, then we would have (2,3) as the intersection point. So let&#39;s set x=2 and see for which &#39;a&#39; that happens.So set x=2:(2a² -3a +16)/(2(a² -1)) =2Multiply both sides by 2(a² -1):2a² -3a +16 =4(a² -1)Expand right side: 4a² -4Bring all terms to left:2a² -3a +16 -4a² +4 =0Combine like terms:-2a² -3a +20 =0Multiply both sides by -1:2a² +3a -20 =0Solve quadratic equation:Discriminant=9 + 160=169sqrt(169)=13Solutions: a=(-3 ±13)/4So a=(10)/4=5/2 or a=(-16)/4=-4So when a=5/2 or a=-4, x=2. Then y would be (a +1)(0) +3=3. Therefore, the intersection point is (2,3). But (2,3) is not in set A. Therefore, when a=5/2 or a=-4, the lines intersect only at (2,3), which is excluded from A. Therefore, A ∩ B is empty.Therefore, the possible values of &#39;a&#39; are a=-1, a=1, a=5/2, and a=-4.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify:We had earlier considered a=1. When a=1, set B is empty, so A ∩ B is empty. So that&#39;s valid.a=-1: lines are parallel and distinct, so no intersection.a=5/2 and a=-4: lines intersect only at (2,3), which is excluded from A, so intersection is empty.So those are the four possible values? Wait, but when a=1, B is empty. So that&#39;s a valid case.Wait, but let&#39;s check a=1. Let me plug a=1 into set A and B.Set A when a=1: (y -3)/(x -2) =1 +1=2. So (y -3)=2(x -2), x≠2. So y=2x -4 +3=2x -1, x≠2. So A is the line y=2x -1 except (2, 3). Wait, when x=2, y=2*2 -1=3, which is excluded.Set B when a=1: (1 -1)x + (1 -1)y=15 → 0x +0y=15, which is impossible. So B is empty. Therefore, A ∩ B is empty. So a=1 is valid.But wait, when a=1, set A is a line missing (2,3). But set B is empty. So their intersection is empty. Correct.Similarly, when a=-1, the lines are parallel and distinct. So their intersection is empty.When a=5/2 or a=-4, the lines intersect only at (2,3), which is excluded from A. So their intersection is empty.Therefore, the possible values are a=-1, 1, 5/2, -4.But wait, let me check if there are any other possibilities. For example, are there values of &#39;a&#39; where lines A and B are the same line except for the point (2,3)? But we saw earlier that if lines A and B are the same, then their intersection is A, which is non-empty. So we need to ensure that lines A and B are not the same. So when would lines A and B coincide?For lines to coincide, they must have the same slope and the same y-intercept. So slope of A is (a +1), slope of B is -(a +1) when a ≠1. So unless (a +1) = - (a +1), which would require a +1=0, so a=-1, which we already considered. But when a=-1, slope of B is -(-1 +1)=0, which is horizontal. Wait, when a=-1, slope of A is 0, slope of B is 0. So they are both horizontal lines. But in that case, when a=-1, set A is y=3 without (2,3), and set B is y=-15/2, which are different lines. So they don&#39;t coincide. Therefore, there are no cases where lines A and B coincide, except maybe for other values of &#39;a&#39;. Wait, let&#39;s check.Suppose that lines A and B are the same line. Then their equations must be equivalent. Let me check:Set A: y -3 = (a +1)(x -2), x ≠2Set B: (a² -1)x + (a -1)y =15If they are the same line, then set B&#39;s equation must be a multiple of set A&#39;s equation. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s rearrange set A&#39;s equation:y = (a +1)x - 2(a +1) +3 = (a +1)x -2a -2 +3 = (a +1)x -2a +1So set A&#39;s equation is y = (a +1)x + (-2a +1), x ≠2Set B&#39;s equation can be written as y = [ - (a² -1)/(a -1) ]x + 15/(a -1)Which simplifies to y = - (a +1)x + 15/(a -1), as we had earlier, when a ≠1.So for the two lines to be the same, their slopes must be equal and their y-intercepts must be equal. So:Slope equality: (a +1) = - (a +1) → same as before, leading to a +1=0 → a=-1. But when a=-1, set B is y= -15/2, which doesn&#39;t match set A&#39;s equation (y=3). So they are different. Hence, there are no values of &#39;a&#39; where lines A and B coincide, except perhaps when a=1, but a=1 makes B empty. Therefore, the only possibilities where A ∩ B is empty are a=-1, 1, 5/2, and -4.Wait, but let&#39;s confirm a=5/2 and a=-4.Take a=5/2 first. Then, set A is (y -3)/(x -2)=5/2 +1=7/2. So set A is y -3 = (7/2)(x -2), x≠2. So y = (7/2)x -7 +3 = (7/2)x -4. So set A is the line y=(7/2)x -4 without (2,3). Set B is ( (25/4 -1)x + (5/2 -1)y =15 ). Let&#39;s compute:25/4 -1=21/4, 5/2 -1=3/2.So equation: (21/4)x + (3/2)y =15.Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators:21x +6y=60.But let&#39;s check if (2,3) is on B:Left side:21*2 +6*3=42 +18=60. Right side:60. So yes, (2,3) is on B. But set A does not include (2,3). So the lines intersect at (2,3), which is excluded from A, so their intersection is empty. Hence, a=5/2 is valid.Similarly, a=-4:Set A: (y -3)/(x -2)= -4 +1=-3. So y -3 = -3(x -2), so y= -3x +6 +3= -3x +9, x≠2. So set A is the line y=-3x +9 without (2,3).Set B: ( (16 -1)x + (-4 -1)y=15 ) →15x -5y=15.Simplify: 3x - y =3 → y=3x -3.Check if (2,3) is on B: y=3*2 -3=6 -3=3. So yes, (2,3) is on B. So the lines A and B intersect at (2,3), which is excluded from A. Therefore, their intersection is empty. Hence, a=-4 is valid.So summarizing, the possible values of &#39;a&#39; are:- a=-1 (parallel lines)- a=1 (B is empty)- a=5/2 (intersect at (2,3))- a=-4 (intersect at (2,3))So these four values. But wait, the problem says &quot;possible values of a that make A ∩ B=∅&quot;. So we need to list all four?But let&#39;s check if a=1 is considered. When a=1, set B is empty, so their intersection is empty. But in some problems, sometimes parameters that make one set empty might be considered trivial or not considered depending on context, but here since the problem didn&#39;t specify any restrictions on &#39;a&#39;, we should include a=1.Therefore, the possible values are a=-4, -1,1,5/2. But let me verify again.Wait, when a=1, set A is (y -3)/(x -2)=2, so y=2x -1, x≠2. Set B is empty, so intersection is empty. Correct.When a=-1, set A is y=3 (excluding (2,3)), set B is y=-15/2. These are parallel, no intersection.When a=5/2 and a=-4, the lines intersect only at (2,3), which is excluded. So yes, all four values.Therefore, the possible values are a=-4, -1,1,5/2.But let me check if these are the only ones. For example, could there be other values where lines A and B are parallel? We saw that slope equality only happens when a=-1, which is already covered. And other than that, the only way for the intersection to be empty is when they intersect at (2,3). So the cases where solving the system leads to x=2, which gives the four values.Therefore, the possible values are a=-4, -1,1,5/2.But let&#39;s write them in order. The problem says &quot;the possible values of a that make A ∩ B=∅ are .&quot; So in boxed notation, we need to present them as a list. Let me check for any miscalculations.Wait, when a=5/2, lines intersect at (2,3). For a=-4, same. When a=-1, parallel lines. When a=1, set B empty.Yes, all four. So the answer should be a=-4, -1,1,5/2. But need to check if 5/2 is 2.5 or 5/2. The problem might expect fractions or integers. Since 5/2 is already in simplest form.So the possible values of &#39;a&#39; are -4, -1,1, and 5/2.But let me check once more:For a=5/2 and a=-4, solving the system leads to x=2, which is excluded, hence empty intersection. For a=-1, lines are parallel. For a=1, set B is empty. Hence, all four values are valid. So the answer is a ∈ {-4, -1,1, 5/2}.Final AnswerThe possible values of ( a ) are (boxed{-4}), (boxed{-1}), (boxed{1}), and (boxed{dfrac{5}{2}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the sets ( A = left{(x, y) leftlvert, frac{y-3}{x-2} = a + 1right.right} ) and ( B = left{(x, y) mid (a^2 - 1)x + (a - 1)y = 15right} ), we need to find the possible values of ( a ) such that ( A cap B = varnothing ).1. Set A Analysis:   - Set ( A ) is the line ( y - 3 = (a + 1)(x - 2) ) excluding the point ( (2, 3) ).2. Set B Analysis:   - Set ( B ) is the line ( (a^2 - 1)x + (a - 1)y = 15 ).3. Key Cases:   - Case 1: Lines are parallel and distinct:     - Slope of ( A ) is ( a + 1 ).     - Slope of ( B ) is ( -frac{a^2 - 1}{a - 1} = -(a + 1) ) (for ( a neq 1 )).     - For parallel lines, slopes must be equal: ( a + 1 = -(a + 1) ) leading to ( a = -1 ).     - Check if lines are distinct: When ( a = -1 ), set ( A ) is ( y = 3 ) (excluding ( (2, 3) )) and set ( B ) is ( y = -frac{15}{2} ). These lines are distinct.   - Case 2: Lines intersect only at ( (2, 3) ):     - Substitute ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 3 ) into set ( B )&#39;s equation: ( 2(a^2 - 1) + 3(a - 1) = 15 ).     - Solving ( 2a^2 + 3a - 20 = 0 ) gives ( a = frac{5}{2} ) or ( a = -4 ).     - These values make the lines intersect at ( (2, 3) ), which is excluded from set ( A ).   - Case 3: Set ( B ) is empty:     - When ( a = 1 ), set ( B ) becomes ( 0x + 0y = 15 ), which is impossible, making ( B ) empty.4. Conclusion:   - The possible values of ( a ) that make ( A cap B = varnothing ) are ( a = -4 ), ( a = -1 ), ( a = 1 ), and ( a = frac{5}{2} ).[boxed{-4}, boxed{-1}, boxed{1}, boxed{dfrac{5}{2}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here with two sets, A and B, and I need to find the possible values of &#39;a&#39; that make their intersection empty. Hmm, let me parse this step by step.First, let&#39;s understand what set A is. The definition says A is the set of all points (x, y) such that (y - 3)/(x - 2) = a + 1. That looks like the equation of a line, but with a caveat: since we&#39;re dividing by (x - 2), x can&#39;t be 2, right? So, the line is defined for all x except 2. So, set A is a line with a hole at x = 2. The slope of this line would be (a + 1), because if I rearrange the equation:(y - 3) = (a + 1)(x - 2)Which is the point-slope form of a line with slope (a + 1) passing through the point (2, 3). But x ≠ 2, so the point (2, 3) isn&#39;t actually in set A. Interesting.Now, set B is defined as all points (x, y) such that (a² - 1)x + (a - 1)y = 15. That&#39;s another linear equation, so set B is a line in the plane. The question is, when do these two sets A and B have no intersection? So, when are the two lines A and B parallel and distinct, or when they&#39;re the same line but with some conflict (like the hole in A making them not overlap completely)?First, let&#39;s recall that two lines in a plane can either intersect at a single point, be parallel and distinct (no intersection), or be the same line (infinite intersection). Since A has a hole at x = 2, even if the lines are the same, the point (2, 3) is missing from A, so if (2, 3) is on B, then their intersection would be B without that point. But if (2, 3) is not on B, then if the lines are the same, their intersection would be the entire line except (2, 3). Wait, but the problem states that A ∩ B = ∅. So, even if the lines are the same but (2, 3) is not on B, then A ∩ B would be the entire line except (2, 3), which is not empty. Therefore, to have A ∩ B = ∅, the lines must be parallel and distinct, or if they are the same line, but with (2, 3) not on B. Wait, but if they are the same line, then except for the point (2, 3), all other points are in both A and B. But since (2, 3) is not in A, but if it is in B, then the intersection would be B without (2, 3). If (2, 3) is not in B, then the intersection is the entire line except (2, 3). Either way, the intersection is not empty. So the only way for A ∩ B to be empty is if the lines are parallel and distinct. Therefore, we need to find values of &#39;a&#39; such that lines A and B are parallel and distinct.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a case where even if they are not parallel, but the only point of intersection is (2, 3), which is not in A. So if line B passes through (2, 3), then their intersection would be that point, which is excluded from A, so A ∩ B would be empty. Wait, that&#39;s another possibility. So, two cases:1. Lines A and B are parallel and distinct.2. Lines A and B intersect only at (2, 3), which is excluded from A.Therefore, the possible values of &#39;a&#39; are those that make either case true.So, let&#39;s analyze both cases.First, let&#39;s rewrite the equations of both lines in slope-intercept form to find their slopes and y-intercepts.For set A:(y - 3) = (a + 1)(x - 2)So, y = (a + 1)x - 2(a + 1) + 3Simplify:y = (a + 1)x - 2a - 2 + 3y = (a + 1)x - 2a + 1So, slope of A is (a + 1), y-intercept is (-2a + 1)For set B:(a² - 1)x + (a - 1)y = 15Let&#39;s solve for y:(a - 1)y = - (a² - 1)x + 15If a ≠ 1, we can divide both sides by (a - 1):y = [ - (a² - 1) / (a - 1) ] x + 15 / (a - 1)Simplify the coefficient of x:-(a² - 1)/(a - 1) = -( (a - 1)(a + 1) ) / (a - 1) ) = -(a + 1) [when a ≠ 1]Therefore, equation for B becomes:y = - (a + 1)x + 15/(a - 1)So, slope of B is - (a + 1), y-intercept is 15/(a - 1)But if a = 1, the original equation for B becomes:(1 - 1)x + (1 - 1)y = 15 ⇒ 0x + 0y = 15, which simplifies to 0 = 15, which is impossible. Therefore, when a = 1, set B is empty. So, if a = 1, B is empty, so A ∩ B is empty. Therefore, a = 1 is a possible value. Wait, but let&#39;s check this.Wait, when a = 1, the equation for B becomes 0x + 0y = 15, which has no solutions, so B is indeed empty. Therefore, A ∩ B would be empty since B is empty. So, a = 1 is one possible value.But let&#39;s not jump to conclusions yet. Let&#39;s check this later.First, proceeding with the case analysis.Case 1: Lines A and B are parallel and distinct.For two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. The slope of A is (a + 1), slope of B is - (a + 1). Therefore, setting them equal:(a + 1) = - (a + 1)Solving:a + 1 = -a - 12a = -2a = -1So, when a = -1, the slopes of A and B are equal. Wait, but let&#39;s verify.If a = -1, slope of A is (-1 + 1) = 0, so line A is horizontal. Similarly, slope of B is - ( -1 + 1 ) = -0 = 0, so slope of B is also 0. Therefore, both lines are horizontal. Now, we need to check if they are distinct.For a = -1, equation of A is:y = 0x -2*(-1) + 1 ⇒ y = 0 + 2 + 1 ⇒ y = 3But with x ≠ 2, so line A is y = 3 with a hole at (2, 3).Equation of B when a = -1:First, let&#39;s compute B&#39;s equation. Original equation is (a² -1)x + (a -1)y = 15.Plug a = -1:[ (-1)^2 -1 ]x + (-1 -1)y = 15 ⇒ (1 -1)x + (-2)y = 15 ⇒ 0x -2y =15 ⇒ -2y =15 ⇒ y = -15/2Therefore, set B is the line y = -15/2. So, line A is y = 3 (except x=2) and line B is y = -15/2. These are two distinct horizontal lines, so they are parallel and distinct. Therefore, their intersection is empty. Hence, when a = -1, A ∩ B = ∅. So, a = -1 is a valid solution.Case 2: Lines A and B are not parallel, but their only point of intersection is (2, 3), which is excluded from A.So, if lines A and B intersect at (2, 3), but since (2, 3) is not in A, then their intersection would be empty. Therefore, we need to find values of &#39;a&#39; such that (2, 3) is the solution to both equations, but (2, 3) is not in A. Wait, but (2, 3) can&#39;t be in A because A excludes x=2. So, if (2, 3) is on B, then B passes through (2, 3). But since A doesn&#39;t include (2, 3), even if B passes through (2, 3), their intersection would be all other points where they intersect. Wait, no. If two lines intersect at a single point, which is (2, 3), but that point is excluded from A, so A ∩ B would be empty. Wait, no. If two lines intersect only at (2, 3), then since that point is not in A, their intersection is empty. But if they intersect elsewhere, then the intersection is non-empty. So, for this case, the lines must intersect only at (2, 3), which is excluded. So, we need that (2, 3) is the only solution to the system of equations, but since it&#39;s excluded, A ∩ B is empty.Therefore, to find such &#39;a&#39;, we can set (2, 3) to satisfy B&#39;s equation, and also ensure that the lines are not parallel (so they intersect only at that point). Wait, but if (2, 3) is on both lines, then they intersect there. But since (2, 3) is excluded from A, then the intersection is empty. However, if the lines intersect at another point, then the intersection is not empty. Therefore, if (2, 3) is the only intersection point and it&#39;s excluded, then A ∩ B is empty.So, first, let&#39;s check if (2, 3) is on B.Plugging x=2, y=3 into B&#39;s equation:(a² -1)(2) + (a -1)(3) = 15Simplify:2a² - 2 + 3a - 3 =15Combine like terms:2a² + 3a -5 =152a² + 3a -20=0Solving quadratic equation:a = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 160)] / (4) = [-3 ± sqrt(169)] /4 = [-3 ±13]/4So, solutions:a = (-3 +13)/4 = 10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5a = (-3 -13)/4 = -16/4 = -4Therefore, when a = 5/2 or a = -4, the point (2, 3) is on B.Now, if a ≠ -1 and a ≠1 (since when a=1, B is empty, which we already considered), then lines A and B are not parallel (since their slopes would be (a +1) and - (a +1), which are only equal if a +1 = - (a +1) ⇒ a = -1). Therefore, except when a = -1 or a=1, lines A and B are not parallel and hence intersect at exactly one point.Therefore, if we have a =5/2 or a=-4, the lines intersect at (2,3), which is excluded from A. Therefore, in those cases, the intersection A ∩ B would be empty. Because the only point they would intersect is (2,3), which is not in A. Therefore, a=5/2 and a=-4 would also be solutions.But we need to verify that for these values of a, the lines do indeed intersect only at (2,3). Let&#39;s check.Take a=5/2 first.For a=5/2, let&#39;s check if lines A and B intersect only at (2,3).Equation of A: y = (a +1)x -2a +1For a=5/2: slope = 5/2 +1 =7/2. Equation: y = (7/2)x -2*(5/2) +1 = (7/2)x -5 +1 = (7/2)x -4.Equation of B: (a² -1)x + (a -1)y =15. For a=5/2:[(25/4 -1)]x + (5/2 -1)y =15 ⇒ (21/4)x + (3/2)y =15Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators: 21x +6y=60 ⇒ 7x +2y=20So, equation of B: 7x +2y=20Now, solve for intersection of y=(7/2)x -4 and 7x +2y=20Substitute y into B&#39;s equation:7x +2*(7/2 x -4) =207x +7x -8 =2014x -8=2014x=28x=2Then y=(7/2)*2 -4=7 -4=3. So, intersection at (2,3). Which is excluded from A. So, lines intersect only at (2,3), which is not in A, hence A ∩ B=∅.Similarly, check a=-4.Equation of A: y=(a +1)x -2a +1. For a=-4:Slope: -4 +1=-3. Equation: y=(-3)x -2*(-4) +1= -3x +8 +1= -3x +9.Equation of B: (a² -1)x + (a -1)y=15. For a=-4:(16 -1)x + (-4 -1)y=15 ⇒15x -5y=15 ⇒Divide by 5: 3x - y=3 ⇒ y=3x -3.Find intersection of y=-3x +9 and y=3x -3.Set equal: -3x +9=3x -3 ⇒6x=12 ⇒x=2. Then y=3*2 -3=6-3=3. So intersection at (2,3), excluded from A. Therefore, A ∩ B=∅.Therefore, for a=5/2 and a=-4, even though lines A and B intersect at (2,3), since that point isn&#39;t in A, their intersection is empty.Therefore, combining all cases:1. When a=1: B is empty, so A ∩ B=∅.2. When a=-1: lines are parallel and distinct.3. When a=5/2 and a=-4: lines intersect only at (2,3), which is excluded from A.Therefore, the possible values of a are -4, -1, 1, 5/2.But wait, let&#39;s check if a=1 is allowed. When a=1, set B is defined by (1 -1)x + (1 -1)y=15 ⇒0=15, which is impossible, so B=∅. Therefore, A ∩ B=∅ because B is empty. So, a=1 is valid.Similarly, we need to make sure that these are all distinct values. So, a=-4, -1, 1, 5/2. Let me check if there are overlaps or other possibilities.Wait, but when a=1, the original equation for A is (y -3)/(x -2)=1 +1=2, so (y -3)=2(x -2). So, y=2x -4 +3=2x -1. But x≠2. So, set A is the line y=2x -1 with a hole at (2, 3). But B is empty, so indeed A ∩ B is empty.But, let me check if there are other values where lines might be parallel but coinciding, but due to the hole, they don&#39;t overlap entirely. Wait, for lines to coincide, their equations must be the same. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s possible.Suppose lines A and B are the same line, but with the hole in A. Then, except for (2,3), all points would be in both A and B. So, A ∩ B would be the line minus (2,3), which is not empty. Therefore, even if lines are coinciding, the intersection is not empty. Hence, we need lines to be either parallel and distinct or intersect only at the hole.But for lines to coincide, their slopes and y-intercepts must be equal. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible.Equation of A: y = (a +1)x -2a +1Equation of B: y = - (a +1)x + 15/(a -1), when a ≠1.For them to be the same line, the slopes must be equal, and y-intercepts must be equal.But slope of A is (a +1), slope of B is - (a +1). Therefore, for slopes to be equal:(a +1) = - (a +1) ⇒ a +1 =0 ⇒a= -1.But when a= -1, lines A and B are both horizontal lines, but A is y=3 with a hole at (2,3), and B is y= -15/2. So, they are distinct. So, lines can&#39;t coincide. Therefore, the only way lines can coincide is if (a +1) = - (a +1) and y-intercepts are equal, but that only gives a=-1, which makes lines parallel but distinct. Therefore, there is no &#39;a&#39; for which lines A and B coincide.Therefore, the only possible &#39;a&#39;s are a=-4, -1, 1, 5/2.Wait, but in the case when a=1, B is empty. So, maybe the problem counts a=1 as a valid solution. So, we need to confirm all these values.So, compiling the possible values:From case 1: a=-1 (parallel and distinct)From case 2: a=5/2 and a=-4 (intersect only at the excluded point)From case a=1: B is empty, so intersection is empty.Thus, four values: a=-4, -1, 1, 5/2.But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s any overlap or if any of these values cause other issues.For a=-1: As we saw, A is y=3 (x≠2), B is y=-15/2. No intersection. Correct.For a=1: B is empty, so intersection is empty. Correct.For a=5/2: Lines intersect only at (2,3), which is excluded. Correct.For a=-4: Same as above. Correct.Therefore, these four values are the solutions.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the possible values of a that make A ∩ B=∅&quot;. So, these four values.But let me check if there are any other edge cases. For example, when a=-1, B is y=-15/2, A is y=3 with a hole. Parallel, distinct. Correct.When a=5/2 and a=-4, lines intersect only at (2,3), which is excluded. Correct.When a=1, B is empty. Correct.Therefore, all four values are valid. Therefore, the possible values are a=-4, -1, 1, 5/2.But let me check the quadratic equation when we plugged (2,3) into B&#39;s equation. We found a=5/2 and a=-4. So, that&#39;s two values. Then a=-1 and a=1.Wait, but hold on. When we considered a=1, we saw that B is empty. So, even if a=1, even though (2,3) is not on B (since B is empty), but actually, when a=1, the equation for B is invalid (0=15), so B is empty. So, A ∩ B=∅. Therefore, a=1 is a separate case.So, in total, we have four values: a=-4, -1,1,5/2.But let me check if when a=1, the equation for A is defined. When a=1, set A is (y-3)/(x-2)=1+1=2. So, (y-3)=2(x-2), which is y=2x -1, x≠2. So, A is a line with a hole. B is empty. Therefore, yes, A ∩ B is empty. Therefore, a=1 is valid.Therefore, all four values are valid. Therefore, the possible values of a are -4, -1,1,5/2.But let me check if the problem allows these values. For example, when a=5/2 or a=-4, we need to ensure that B is a valid line. For a=5/2:(a² -1) = (25/4 -1)=21/4, which is non-zero? Not necessarily. Wait, B&#39;s equation is (a² -1)x + (a -1)y=15. For a=5/2, coefficients are (21/4)x + (3/2)y=15, which is a valid line. Similarly, for a=-4, coefficients are (16-1)x + (-5)y=15 ⇒15x -5y=15, which is 3x - y=3, a valid line. So, yes, these are valid.Also, when a=-1, B is a horizontal line, as we saw. So, all four values are valid. Therefore, the answer is a=-4, -1,1,5/2.But the problem says &quot;the possible values of a that make A ∩ B=∅&quot;. So, these four. Let me confirm once more.Yes, I think that&#39;s correct.Final AnswerThe possible values of ( a ) are (boxed{-4}), (boxed{-1}), (boxed{1}), and (boxed{dfrac{5}{2}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the sets ( A = left{(x, y) leftlvert, frac{y-3}{x-2} = a + 1right.right} ) and ( B = left{(x, y) mid (a^2 - 1)x + (a - 1)y = 15right} ), we need to find the possible values of ( a ) that make ( A cap B = varnothing ).1. Set A Analysis:   - The equation ( frac{y-3}{x-2} = a + 1 ) can be rewritten as ( y = (a + 1)(x - 2) + 3 ), which is a line with slope ( a + 1 ) and a hole at ( (2, 3) ).2. Set B Analysis:   - The equation ( (a^2 - 1)x + (a - 1)y = 15 ) can be rewritten in slope-intercept form. For ( a neq 1 ), it becomes ( y = - (a + 1)x + frac{15}{a - 1} ). For ( a = 1 ), the equation becomes ( 0 = 15 ), which is impossible, making ( B ) empty.3. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: Lines are parallel and distinct:     - Slopes must be equal: ( a + 1 = - (a + 1) Rightarrow a = -1 ). For ( a = -1 ), lines are horizontal and distinct.   - Case 2: Lines intersect only at ( (2, 3) ):     - Substitute ( (2, 3) ) into ( B )&#39;s equation: ( 2(a^2 - 1) + 3(a - 1) = 15 ). Solving gives ( a = frac{5}{2} ) or ( a = -4 ).   - Case 3: ( a = 1 ):     - ( B ) is empty, so ( A cap B = varnothing ).4. Verification:   - For ( a = -1 ), lines are parallel and distinct.   - For ( a = frac{5}{2} ) and ( a = -4 ), lines intersect only at ( (2, 3) ), which is excluded from ( A ).   - For ( a = 1 ), ( B ) is empty.Thus, the possible values of ( a ) are (boxed{-4}), (boxed{-1}), (boxed{1}), and (boxed{dfrac{5}{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>13. -4,-1,1, frac{5}{2}.A is {(x, y) mid(a+1) x-y-2 a+1=0, x neq 2}.A cap B=varnothing occurs only in one of the following three cases:(1) When a=-1, since A={(x, y) mid y=3, x neq 2}, B=left{(x, y) leftlvert, y=-frac{15}{2}right.right}, the lines y=3 and y=-frac{15}{2} are parallel, so A cap B=varnothing;(2) When a neq-1, and frac{a^{2}-1}{a+1}=frac{a-1}{-1} neq frac{-15}{-2 a+1}, the line (a+1) x-y-2 a+1=0 is parallel to left(a^{2}-1right) x+(a-1) y=15, so A cap B=varnothing.

Hmm, let&#39;s start with part a.For part a, the cube has six faces, each face lying on a plane. These six planes should divide the space into regions. I know that in lower dimensions, like with lines dividing a plane, there&#39;s a formula for the maximum number of regions. For example, n lines can divide a plane into at most (n² + n + 2)/2 regions. But in three dimensions, it&#39;s more complicated because we&#39;re dealing with planes. I remember that the formula for the maximum number of regions created by n planes in three-dimensional space is R(n) = (n³ + 5n + 6)/6. Let me verify that. For n=1, one plane divides space into 2 regions. Plugging into the formula: (1 +5 +6)/6 = 12/6 = 2, which is correct. For n=2, two planes intersecting along a line create 4 regions. Formula: (8 +10 +6)/6 = 24/6 =4. That works. For n=3, three planes intersecting generically (no two planes are parallel, and the three lines of intersection are not concurrent) divide space into 8 regions. Formula: (27 +15 +6)/6 = 48/6 =8. Correct. So the formula seems right.But wait, this is the maximum number of regions when each new plane intersects all previous ones in a line, and each new line of intersection intersects all previous ones at a unique point. But in the case of a cube, the planes are not in general position. The cube&#39;s planes are three pairs of parallel planes. So the formula for maximum regions doesn&#39;t apply here. So I can&#39;t just use that formula. Hmmm. So I need another approach.Alternatively, maybe I can visualize how the cube&#39;s planes divide the space. Let&#39;s think. The cube has three pairs of parallel planes: front/back, left/right, top/bottom. Each pair is perpendicular to the other two. So, in terms of coordinate axes, they can be considered as planes x=0 and x=1, y=0 and y=1, z=0 and z=1, assuming a unit cube. If we consider the three coordinate planes (x=0, y=0, z=0), they divide space into 8 octants. Then adding the opposite planes (x=1, y=1, z=1) would split each existing region into smaller regions. Wait, but how exactly?Let me first think about adding one plane to an existing set. Suppose we start with the three coordinate planes. They divide space into 8 regions. Now, adding the plane x=1. How does that affect the regions? The plane x=1 is parallel to the y-z plane. It will slice through the regions where x &gt;= 1. But originally, the regions were divided by x=0 into x&gt;0 and x&lt;0. Now, adding x=1, we divide the x&gt;0 part into two parts: 0 &lt; x &lt;1 and x &gt;1. So for each existing region where x &gt;0, we split it into two. But originally, there were 4 regions with x &gt;0 (since the three coordinate planes divide space into 8 octants, half of which have x&gt;0). So adding x=1 would split each of those 4 regions into two, so adding 4 regions. So total regions would be 8 +4 =12.Wait, but maybe that&#39;s not the right way to think. Let&#39;s think step by step. Let&#39;s start with no planes: 1 region. Adding the first plane (say x=0), divides space into 2 regions. Adding the second plane (y=0), which is orthogonal to the first, divides each of the 2 regions into 2, so 4 regions. Adding the third plane (z=0), orthogonal to both, divides each of the 4 regions into 2, so 8 regions. Now, adding the fourth plane (x=1). How does that affect the count? The fourth plane is parallel to the first plane (x=0). In the case of adding a plane parallel to an existing one, the formula is different. If two planes are parallel, the number of regions added is equal to the number of regions the plane passes through. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Alternatively, when adding a plane that is parallel to an existing one, it can only divide regions that lie between the two parallel planes or outside. Wait, perhaps the regions divided by x=0 and x=1. The regions where x &lt;0, 0 &lt;x &lt;1, and x &gt;1. So when we first have x=0, we have x&lt;0 and x&gt;0. Then adding x=1 divides the x&gt;0 part into two, so total regions for x-axis: 3. But in 3D, each plane can affect multiple regions.Wait, maybe step by step:Start with 0 planes: 1 region.Add x=0: splits into 2 regions (x &lt;0 and x &gt;0).Add y=0: each existing region is split by y=0. So 2*2=4 regions.Add z=0: each existing region is split by z=0. 4*2=8 regions.Now, adding x=1. The plane x=1 is parallel to x=0. So in the existing regions, the regions where x &gt;0 will be intersected by x=1. Specifically, in the positive x side, we had all regions with x &gt;0. The plane x=1 will split each of those regions into two parts: 0 &lt;x &lt;1 and x &gt;1. However, in 3D, the plane x=1 will slice through all regions where x &gt;0, but the splitting might not just be doubling the number. Wait, actually, in 3D, if a region is entirely on one side of the plane, it&#39;s not split. If the plane passes through a region, it splits it into two.But in this case, the plane x=1 is parallel to x=0. The existing regions after three coordinate planes are the octants. For each octant, their x-coordinate ranges are either x &gt;0 or x &lt;0. The regions with x &gt;0 are in the positive octants. The plane x=1 will pass through the regions where x &gt;0. But does x=1 pass through all those regions?Wait, for example, take the region where x &gt;0, y &gt;0, z &gt;0. The plane x=1 will intersect this region, dividing it into two parts: 0 &lt;x &lt;1, y &gt;0, z &gt;0 and x &gt;1, y &gt;0, z &gt;0. Similarly, the other three positive octants (x &gt;0, y &gt;0, z &lt;0; x &gt;0, y &lt;0, z &gt;0; x &gt;0, y &lt;0, z &lt;0) will each be split by x=1 into two parts. Therefore, adding x=1 will split each of the four positive octants into two, thus adding four regions. So total regions after adding x=1: 8 +4=12.Similarly, adding y=1 next. The plane y=1 is parallel to y=0. The regions where y &gt;0 are the four regions with y &gt;0 (regardless of x and z). These regions are: (x any, y &gt;0, z any). Originally, after adding x=1, the regions with y &gt;0 are: for each combination of x (either &lt;0, 0-1, or &gt;1) and z (&lt;0 or &gt;0), but y &gt;0. Wait, no, after adding x=0, x=1, y=0, z=0, how many regions do we have?Wait, maybe I need to track the regions more carefully.After the initial three planes (x=0, y=0, z=0): 8 regions.Adding x=1: splits each of the four regions where x &gt;0 into two, so 4 new regions, total 12.Then adding y=1: splits each of the regions where y &gt;0. How many regions have y &gt;0? Originally, after x=0, y=0, z=0, there are 4 regions with y &gt;0. But after adding x=1, the regions where y &gt;0 are: for x &lt;0, y &gt;0, z &lt;0 or z &gt;0; and for x between 0 and1, y &gt;0, z &lt;0 or z &gt;0; and x &gt;1, y &gt;0, z &lt;0 or z &gt;0. Wait, actually, regardless of x and z, as long as y &gt;0. But with the x=1 plane, x is divided into x &lt;0, 0 &lt;x &lt;1, x &gt;1. Similarly, z is divided into z &lt;0 and z &gt;0. So for y &gt;0, there are 3 (x partitions) * 2 (z partitions) =6 regions. Wait, but initially, after adding x=1, we had split the x &gt;0 regions. Let me recount.Wait, initial 8 regions from x=0, y=0, z=0. Then adding x=1: splits each of the four regions where x &gt;0 into two. So for each of the four positive x octants, we split them into 0 &lt;x &lt;1 and x &gt;1. Therefore, the regions where y &gt;0: originally, 4 regions (since in the original octants, half have y &gt;0). After splitting x &gt;0 into two, the regions with y &gt;0 would be: for x &lt;0, y &gt;0, z &lt;0 and z &gt;0 (2 regions); for 0 &lt;x &lt;1, y &gt;0, z &lt;0 and z &gt;0 (2 regions); and for x &gt;1, y &gt;0, z &lt;0 and z &gt;0 (2 regions). So total 6 regions with y &gt;0. Therefore, adding the plane y=1 would split each of these 6 regions into two parts: 0 &lt;y &lt;1 and y &gt;1. Therefore, adding 6 regions. So total regions after adding y=1: 12 +6=18.Similarly, adding z=1 next. The plane z=1 is parallel to z=0. The regions where z &gt;0: how many are there? After adding x=1, y=1, the regions are divided along x into x &lt;0, 0 &lt;x &lt;1, x &gt;1; y into y &lt;0, 0 &lt;y &lt;1, y &gt;1; and z into z &lt;0 and z &gt;0. So for z &gt;0, the number of regions is 3 (x partitions) *3 (y partitions) *1 (z &gt;0) =9 regions. Wait, no. Wait, z is only split into two by z=0. So after adding z=1, which is parallel to z=0, the regions where z &gt;0 will be split into 0 &lt;z &lt;1 and z &gt;1. Each of the existing regions where z &gt;0 will be split. How many regions have z &gt;0? After adding x=1 and y=1, the regions are as follows:For each axis, x is divided into three parts: x &lt;0, 0 &lt;x &lt;1, x &gt;1;y similarly into three parts: y &lt;0, 0 &lt;y &lt;1, y &gt;1;z is divided into two parts: z &lt;0 and z &gt;0.Therefore, total regions before adding z=1: 3 (x) *3 (y) *2 (z) =18 regions. So when we add z=1, which splits the z &gt;0 regions. Each of the z &gt;0 regions (which are 3*3*1=9 regions) will be split into two. So adding 9 regions. Therefore, total regions after adding z=1: 18 +9=27.Therefore, the six planes of the cube (three coordinate planes and three at 1 unit distance) divide the space into 27 regions. That seems familiar, like a 3x3x3 grid. Each axis is divided into three intervals, so the total number of regions is 3*3*3=27. That makes sense. So part a) answer is 27.Now part b) the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces. Hmm. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a plane. The question is, how many regions do these four planes divide the space into?Again, if the four planes are in general position, the formula for regions created by n planes in 3D is R(n) = (n³ +5n +6)/6. For n=4, that would be (64 +20 +6)/6 =90/6=15. But the tetrahedron&#39;s faces are not in general position. The four planes of a tetrahedron intersect each other along edges (lines), and each plane intersects the other three planes. So they are not in general position because in general position, each new plane would intersect all previous planes in distinct lines, but in a tetrahedron, each pair of planes intersects along a line (edge), and three planes meet at a vertex. So maybe the number of regions is different from the general case.Wait, actually, a tetrahedron&#39;s four planes do divide space into regions. Let&#39;s think. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, four vertices, and six edges. The four planes extend infinitely, so the regions are divided by these four planes.How can we compute the number of regions? Maybe by considering how each plane intersects the others and adding up the regions.Alternatively, there&#39;s a formula for convex polyhedrons. The number of regions created by the planes of a convex polyhedron is equal to the number of its vertices plus the number of its faces plus the number of its edges minus 2, but I might be misremembering. Wait, Euler&#39;s formula is V - E + F =2. But how does that relate to regions?Alternatively, maybe we can use inclusion-exclusion or another combinatorial method.Alternatively, maybe visualize the process. Start with one plane: divides space into two. Add a second plane, intersecting the first along a line: divides space into four regions. Add a third plane, intersecting the first two along different lines, creating a triangular arrangement: how many regions? Let me think. After three planes, if they form a triangular prism-like intersection, the number of regions is 8? Wait, no. Wait, three planes in general position (no two parallel, no three intersecting along a common line) divide space into 8 regions. But in the case of a tetrahedron, the three planes intersect at a common vertex. Wait, no, in a tetrahedron, each pair of planes intersect along an edge (a line), and three planes meet at a vertex. So the three planes forming one face and the adjacent faces meet at a vertex. Hmm, maybe the three planes are arranged such that each pair intersects along a line, and the three lines meet at a point. So similar to the coordinate planes, which meet at the origin.Wait, the coordinate planes (x=0, y=0, z=0) divide space into 8 octants. If we add a fourth plane, say the plane x+y+z=1, how does that divide the regions? But in the case of a tetrahedron, the four planes are arranged so that each is a face of the tetrahedron. For example, a regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces. But how do these four planes divide the space?Alternatively, consider that the tetrahedron can be thought of as a three-dimensional simplex. The number of regions created by the hyperplanes of a simplex in n-dimensional space is 2^n. But in three dimensions, a simplex (tetrahedron) would have 2^3=8 regions? But that doesn&#39;t make sense because we know that three coordinate planes (a three-dimensional simplex&#39;s hyperplanes) divide space into 8 regions, and adding the fourth plane (the fourth face of the tetrahedron) would divide some regions into more parts.Wait, maybe that&#39;s not the right approach. Let&#39;s think of the tetrahedron&#39;s four planes. Each plane is a face of the tetrahedron. For a convex polyhedron like a tetrahedron, the number of regions created by its face planes should be equal to the number of its vertices plus the number of its faces plus the number of its edges... Wait, not sure. Let&#39;s think.Alternatively, consider that each face of the tetrahedron divides space into two parts: the interior of the tetrahedron and the exterior. However, the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces actually extend infinitely, so the regions are divided by these four planes. Each plane contributes to the division.Alternatively, use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The number of regions R created by n planes is given by:R(n) = R(n-1) + n(n-1)/2 +1Wait, no, that might not be. Wait, actually, in 3D, the formula for regions formed by n planes is similar to the one in 2D but more complex. The general formula is R(n) = R(n-1) + number of intersections the nth plane has with the previous planes, plus 1. Wait, in 2D, each new line intersects all previous lines at a point, adding n regions. In 3D, each new plane intersects the previous planes in lines, and the number of regions the new plane is divided into by those lines corresponds to the number of regions added.Wait, here&#39;s the general formula for regions created by n planes in three dimensions:R(n) = R(n-1) + n(n-1)/2 +1 ?Wait, no. Let me recall. The formula is similar to the 2D case but extended. In 2D, the maximum number of regions with n lines is R(n) = n(n+1)/2 +1. In 3D, the formula is R(n) = n(n² - n +6)/6. Wait, no, as earlier, the formula is (n³ +5n +6)/6. For n=4, that would be (64 +20 +6)/6=90/6=15. But this is for planes in general position. However, the tetrahedron&#39;s four planes are not in general position because they all intersect at a common point (the vertices). Wait, no. Wait, in a tetrahedron, each three planes meet at a vertex, but not all four planes meet at a single point. Each vertex is the intersection of three planes. So there are four vertices, each being the intersection of three planes. So the four planes intersect each other in six lines (edges), and each line is the intersection of two planes. Each plane contains three lines (edges), and each line is shared by two planes. So the arrangement of the four planes is such that they form a tetrahedral arrangement.In such a case, how many regions do they create? Let me try to compute it step by step.Start with the first plane: divides space into 2 regions.Add the second plane: intersects the first plane along a line, dividing space into 4 regions.Add the third plane: this plane intersects the first two planes along two different lines, which intersect at a point (a vertex). The third plane is divided by the two lines into three regions on the plane, but in space, this plane will add several regions. Wait, maybe using the formula for regions added by the third plane: the number of regions a new plane adds is equal to the number of times it intersects previous planes (in lines) plus 1. Wait, in 3D, when adding a new plane, the maximum number of regions it can add is equal to the number of intersections it has with previous planes plus 1. Each intersection is a line, and each line divides the new plane into segments, each segment corresponding to a region being added.But in the case of the tetrahedron&#39;s third plane, it intersects the first two planes along two lines that meet at a point. So the third plane is intersected by the first two planes in two lines that meet at a point. Therefore, those two lines divide the third plane into four regions. Wait, no, two intersecting lines on a plane divide it into four regions. So when adding the third plane, it would add four regions. Wait, but in 3D, the number of regions added by the third plane is equal to the number of regions the plane is divided into by the existing intersections. So if the third plane is divided into four regions by the two lines, then it adds four regions. Therefore, total regions after three planes: 4 (from two planes) +4=8.Wait, but in reality, three planes in 3D (if they are not all intersecting along a single line) divide space into 8 regions. Which is correct. So if the three planes are the faces of a tetrahedron, which meet at a vertex, then they divide space into 8 regions. So that matches.Now, adding the fourth plane. The fourth plane is another face of the tetrahedron. How does this plane interact with the existing three planes? The fourth plane will intersect each of the three existing planes along a line (the edges of the tetrahedron). Each intersection is a line where two planes meet. So the fourth plane will intersect the three existing planes in three different lines. These three lines on the fourth plane will meet at a point (the vertex where all three lines intersect). So on the fourth plane, the three lines (from intersections with the first three planes) meet at a single point, dividing the fourth plane into six regions. Wait, three lines intersecting at a common point on the plane divide the plane into six regions. Therefore, the number of regions added by the fourth plane is six. Hence, total regions after four planes: 8 +6=14.But let me verify this. If three lines on a plane intersecting at a single point divide the plane into six regions. So in 3D, when adding the fourth plane, which is intersected by the three existing planes in three lines meeting at a point, the fourth plane is divided into six regions. Each of these regions corresponds to a region in space that is cut by the fourth plane. Therefore, each of the six regions on the fourth plane divides an existing region into two parts, thereby adding six regions. Hence, total regions would be 8 +6=14.But is that correct? Let&#39;s think. Let me consider an example. Suppose we have three coordinate planes (x=0, y=0, z=0) dividing space into 8 octants. Now, adding a fourth plane, say x+y+z=0. Wait, but this plane passes through the origin, which is the intersection point of the three coordinate planes. The intersections of x+y+z=0 with the coordinate planes are the lines x+y=0 (on z=0), x+z=0 (on y=0), and y+z=0 (on x=0). These three lines on the fourth plane meet at the origin. So the fourth plane is divided into six regions by these three lines. So when we add the fourth plane, how many regions does it add?Each existing region in space is either entirely on one side of the fourth plane or the other, or intersected by the plane. The regions intersected by the plane will be split into two. The number of regions intersected by the fourth plane corresponds to the number of regions on the fourth plane. Since the fourth plane is divided into six regions by the three lines, each of these six regions is part of an existing region in space. Therefore, the fourth plane will split six regions into two, adding six new regions. Therefore, total regions 8 +6=14.But in our case, the four planes of the tetrahedron. Let&#39;s confirm. If we have four planes forming a tetrahedron, how many regions do they create? I recall that a tetrahedron has 15 regions? Wait, maybe not. Wait, let&#39;s think again.Wait, the formula for the number of regions formed by the four planes of a tetrahedron is 15. But according to our step-by-step, it would be 14. There&#39;s a contradiction here.Wait, let&#39;s check with another method. The four planes of a tetrahedron, each pair intersecting along an edge (six edges), and each triplet intersecting at a vertex (four vertices). The number of regions can be calculated using Euler&#39;s formula for three-dimensional arrangements.The formula for the number of regions formed by an arrangement of planes in three dimensions is given by:R = n(n² - n + 6)/6But this is when the planes are in general position. For n=4, that would be 4(16 -4 +6)/6 =4(18)/6=12. Wait, no, wait, the formula is actually R(n) = (n³ +5n +6)/6. For n=4, (64 +20 +6)/6=90/6=15. So if the four planes are in general position, they create 15 regions. But in our case, the four planes of the tetrahedron are not in general position because they intersect along lines and share common intersection points (vertices). So does this increase or decrease the number of regions?In general, when planes are not in general position (i.e., more planes intersecting along a common line or point), the number of regions can be less than the maximum. For example, if two planes are parallel, they don&#39;t intersect, so the number of regions is less. Similarly, if multiple planes intersect along a common line, the number of regions is less.In the case of a tetrahedron, the four planes intersect in such a way that each pair intersects along a line (edge), and each triplet intersects at a vertex. So compared to four planes in general position (where each pair intersects along a unique line, and no three planes intersect along a common line), the tetrahedron&#39;s planes have more intersections at common points, which might reduce the number of regions.Wait, but in general position, four planes would intersect each other in six lines (each pair intersects in a line), and each line is the intersection of two planes. However, in the tetrahedron case, the four planes also intersect in six lines (the edges of the tetrahedron), but additionally, each line is intersected by two other planes at a vertex. Wait, no, each vertex is the intersection of three planes, so each vertex is where three lines (edges) meet. So for four planes, there are four vertices, each being the intersection of three planes.In general position, four planes would not have any three planes intersecting at a common point. Therefore, the difference between the tetrahedron&#39;s planes and general position is that in the tetrahedron, each triplet of planes intersects at a point (vertex), whereas in general position, three planes intersect at three different lines, none of which share a common point.Therefore, the number of regions created by the tetrahedron&#39;s planes should be different from the general position case. But how?Alternatively, there is a formula for the number of regions created by an arrangement of planes, which takes into account the number of intersections. The formula is:R = 1 + n + ∑_{k=1 to n} (number of regions added by the k-th plane)But to compute that, we need to know how each new plane intersects the previous ones.Alternatively, use the formula from incidence geometry. The number of regions can be calculated as:R = n³ - 3n² +8n /6 ?Wait, not sure.Wait, let me think again step by step.Start with one plane: 2 regions.Add the second plane: intersects the first plane along a line, dividing space into 4 regions.Add the third plane: intersects the first two planes along two different lines, which intersect at a point. This divides the third plane into six regions? Wait, no. When adding the third plane, it intersects the first two planes in two lines, which intersect at a point. The two lines on the third plane divide it into four regions. Therefore, the third plane adds four regions, total 8.Add the fourth plane: this plane intersects each of the three existing planes along three different lines. Each of these lines is the intersection of the fourth plane with one of the first three planes. These three lines on the fourth plane meet at a point (the vertex where the fourth plane meets the three original planes). So, three lines on the fourth plane intersecting at a single point divide the plane into six regions. Therefore, the fourth plane adds six regions, making total regions 8 +6=14.But according to the general position formula, four planes should create 15 regions, but here we get 14. So because the fourth plane&#39;s intersections with the previous planes meet at a common point, it creates fewer regions than if the intersections were all separate. Therefore, the number is 14.But let me check with a different approach. Another way to compute the number of regions is to use the formula:R = V - E + F - C +1Where V is the number of vertices, E the number of edges, F the number of faces, and C the number of cells (regions). Wait, no, Euler&#39;s formula in three dimensions for a convex polyhedron is V - E + F =2. But this is for a single convex polyhedron, not for an arrangement of planes dividing space into regions.However, there&#39;s a generalization of Euler&#39;s formula for cell complexes in three dimensions:V - E + F - C =0But I&#39;m not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, use the formula for arrangements of planes. The number of regions created by an arrangement of planes in three dimensions can be calculated using:R = 1 + n + number of intersections.Wait, no, it&#39;s more complex. The formula is similar to inclusion-exclusion:The number of regions R is equal to:R = 1 + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + C(n,3)But only if every set of three planes intersects at a unique point and no four planes intersect at a point. But in our case, for the tetrahedron&#39;s four planes, each three planes intersect at a point (a vertex), and there are four such points (vertices). So this violates the general position condition where no three planes intersect at a common line or point.Therefore, the formula R = 1 +n +n(n-1)/2 +n(n-1)(n-2)/6 doesn&#39;t apply here because it assumes that every three planes intersect at a distinct point, which is not the case here. In the tetrahedron&#39;s case, each three planes intersect at one of the four vertices, so there are four points where three planes intersect, whereas in general position, there would be C(4,3)=4 points of intersection, each from a unique triplet. Wait, in the tetrahedron&#39;s case, there are four vertices, each being the intersection of three planes, so it&#39;s actually the same number as in general position. Wait, but in general position, four planes would have C(4,3)=4 points where three planes intersect, which is the same as the tetrahedron. However, in general position, each pair of planes intersect along a line, and each line is the intersection of two planes. In the tetrahedron, each pair of planes intersect along a line (edge), but those lines (edges) are shared by two planes. So in terms of intersections, the tetrahedron&#39;s planes have the same number of intersections as four planes in general position. Therefore, maybe the number of regions is the same as in general position.Wait, but in general position, four planes create 15 regions. But according to our step-by-step addition, it&#39;s 14. So there is a discrepancy. Which is correct?Wait, perhaps my step-by-step reasoning was flawed. Let&#39;s try another method. The formula for regions created by four planes in general position is indeed 15. But if the four planes form a tetrahedron, how many regions do they form?Another approach is to notice that the tetrahedron&#39;s planes divide the space into the interior of the tetrahedron and the exterior regions. The exterior regions can be considered as the regions &quot;opposite&quot; each face. Each face has an exterior region, but also regions around edges and vertices.Wait, perhaps we can count the regions by considering the tetrahedron&#39;s structure.The tetrahedron has four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices. Each face is part of a plane that extends infinitely. The regions created by these four planes can be categorized based on their position relative to the tetrahedron.- The interior of the tetrahedron: 1 region.- Regions adjacent to each face but outside the tetrahedron: 4 regions.- Regions adjacent to each edge but not adjacent to any face: Each edge is the intersection of two planes. The regions around an edge would be the space between the two adjacent face regions. There are six edges, so six regions.- Regions adjacent to each vertex but not adjacent to any edge or face: Each vertex is where three planes meet. The region near a vertex but not adjacent to any edge or face would be like a octant-like region. There are four vertices, so four regions.- Finally, the region that is outside all these, opposite to the tetrahedron: 1 region.Adding them up: 1 (interior) +4 (face regions) +6 (edge regions) +4 (vertex regions) +1 (exterior) =16. Wait, that gives 16 regions. But this contradicts previous counts. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe this method overcounts. Let&#39;s think again.Interior: 1 region.Each face divides the exterior into regions. For each face, there&#39;s a region directly opposite to it. So 4 face-opposed regions.Each edge is the intersection of two faces. The regions adjacent to an edge but not part of the face-opposed regions would form a dihedral angle region. There are six edges, so six such regions.Each vertex is where three faces meet. The region around a vertex but not adjacent to any edge or face would be a trihedral angle region. There are four vertices, so four regions.Finally, the outermost region, which is not adjacent to any face, edge, or vertex: 1 region.So total regions: 1 +4 +6 +4 +1=16. But according to the general position formula, four planes create 15 regions. Which is correct?Alternatively, maybe the count above is wrong. Let me think. When you have a tetrahedron, the planes divide the space into regions. The interior is one region. Then, each face has a corresponding external region. Then, each edge is shared by two faces, and the external regions adjacent to the edge are the regions that are on the outside of both adjacent faces. However, these might not be distinct regions. Wait, maybe the counting is not accurate.Alternatively, use the formula for convex polyhedrons extended to arrangements. The number of regions created by the four planes of a tetrahedron can be calculated using Zaslavsky&#39;s theorem, which relates the number of regions to the number of intersections. The formula is:R = ∑_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k C(n, k) (number of regions in the intersection poset)But I&#39;m not familiar with the exact formula.Alternatively, look for existing references. From some research, I recall that the number of regions formed by the four planes of a tetrahedron is 15. However, according to our previous step-by-step addition, it was 14, and according to the face/edge/vertex count, it was 16. This is confusing.Wait, let&#39;s look for an example. Let&#39;s consider the coordinate planes plus the plane x+y+z=1. This is a tetrahedron with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,0). Wait, no, the planes x=0, y=0, z=0, and x+y+z=1. These four planes form a tetrahedron. How many regions do they divide the space into?Let&#39;s consider:- The coordinate planes divide space into 8 octants.- The plane x+y+z=1 divides each octant into two parts, depending on whether x+y+z &lt;1 or x+y+z &gt;1.So we need to determine how many of the 8 octants are intersected by the plane x+y+z=1.In each octant, the signs of x, y, z are fixed. For example, the positive octant (x&gt;0, y&gt;0, z&gt;0). In this octant, the plane x+y+z=1 divides it into two regions: x+y+z &lt;1 and x+y+z &gt;1.But in other octants, where some variables are negative, the plane x+y+z=1 may or may not intersect. For example, in the octant where x&lt;0, y&gt;0, z&gt;0, x+y+z could be less than 1 even for large y and z because x is negative. Wait, but the plane x+y+z=1 passes through (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So in octants where some variables are negative, the plane x+y+z=1 might not intersect that octant. Let&#39;s check.Take the octant x&lt;0, y&lt;0, z&lt;0. In this octant, x+y+z is always less than 0, so x+y+z &lt;1. Hence, the plane doesn&#39;t intersect this octant. Similarly, octants with two negatives and one positive: For example, x&lt;0, y&lt;0, z&gt;0. Here, x+y+z can be written as (negative) + (negative) + (positive). Depending on the values, it could be positive or negative. But the plane x+y+z=1 would pass through this octant. Wait, let&#39;s substitute. Let x=-a, y=-b, z=c, where a,b,c&gt;0. Then, x+y+z = -a -b +c. For this to equal 1, we need c =1 +a +b. Since c&gt;0, this is possible. Therefore, the plane does intersect this octant. So the plane x+y+z=1 intersects all octants except the all-negative octant (x&lt;0,y&lt;0,z&lt;0) where x+y+z is always negative. Similarly, in the octant x&gt;0,y&lt;0,z&lt;0, x+y+z = positive + negative + negative. Can this equal 1? Let x=a, y=-b, z=-c, a,b,c&gt;0. Then x+y+z= a -b -c =1. So if a=1 +b +c, which is possible. So the plane intersects this octant as well. The only octant not intersected by the plane x+y+z=1 is the all-negative octant. Therefore, the plane x+y+z=1 intersects 7 of the 8 octants, splitting each into two parts. Hence, total regions =1 (all-negative) +7*2=1+14=15.Therefore, the four planes (three coordinate planes and x+y+z=1) divide space into 15 regions. Therefore, the answer for part b) is 15.But in this case, the four planes are three coordinate planes and x+y+z=1. These four planes form a tetrahedron with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,0). But in our previous step-by-step addition where we added the fourth plane and thought it created 14 regions, that was wrong. Actually, it creates 15 regions. So where was the mistake?Ah, earlier when I considered adding the fourth plane (the fourth face of the tetrahedron) to the existing three planes (which were the coordinate planes), the fourth plane intersects seven of the eight octants, splitting each into two, resulting in 15 regions. So this contradicts the previous step-by-step where I thought that adding the fourth plane would add six regions, leading to 14. That was a mistake.Therefore, the correct answer for part b) is 15.But why the discrepancy? Because the fourth plane in the tetrahedron case intersects seven of the existing eight regions, splitting each into two, but in the step-by-step approach where we added planes one by one, maybe we didn&#39;t account correctly for the regions intersected.Wait, if we start with three coordinate planes (8 regions), adding the fourth plane (x+y+z=1), which intersects seven of the octants (all except the all-negative), each of those seven octants is split into two, so adding seven regions. Hence, total regions 8 +7=15. That makes sense. Therefore, the mistake earlier was assuming that the fourth plane would intersect six regions, but in reality, it intersects seven.So, why the confusion earlier? Because when we add the fourth plane, which is not parallel to any axis, it can intersect more regions. In the case of the tetrahedron&#39;s fourth plane, it intersects seven regions, hence adding seven regions. Therefore, the correct number is 15.Therefore, part b) answer is 15.To summarize:a) The six planes of the cube divide space into 27 regions.b) The four planes of the tetrahedron divide space into 15 regions.Final Answera) boxed{27}b) boxed{15}&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many regions the space is divided into by the given planes: Part a: Six planes of the cube&#39;s faces1. A cube has three pairs of parallel planes (front/back, left/right, top/bottom).2. Each pair of planes is perpendicular to the other pairs.3. These planes can be considered as (x=0), (x=1), (y=0), (y=1), (z=0), and (z=1).4. Each axis (x, y, z) is divided into three intervals (negative, between 0 and 1, and positive).5. The number of regions created is the product of the divisions along each axis: (3 times 3 times 3 = 27).Thus, the number of regions divided by the six planes of the cube&#39;s faces is (boxed{27}). Part b: Four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces1. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each face lying on a plane.2. The planes of a tetrahedron intersect each other along edges (lines) and meet at vertices.3. Considering the example of the planes (x=0), (y=0), (z=0), and (x+y+z=1):   - The coordinate planes divide space into 8 octants.   - The plane (x+y+z=1) intersects 7 of the 8 octants, splitting each into two regions.4. The total number of regions is calculated as 1 (all-negative octant) plus 7 octants each split into two, resulting in (1 + 7 times 2 = 15).Thus, the number of regions divided by the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces is (boxed{15}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have these two geometry problems here. Let me start with part a: figuring out how many regions a cube&#39;s six face planes divide the space into. Hmm. Okay, cubes are pretty regular, so maybe there&#39;s a pattern or formula for this. Let me think. First, when we talk about regions created by planes in space, it&#39;s similar to how lines divide a plane into regions, but extended into three dimensions. For lines in a plane, the maximum number of regions formed by n lines is given by (n² + n + 2)/2. But in three dimensions, planes are the cutting elements. I remember there&#39;s a formula for the maximum number of regions created by n planes in three-dimensional space, which is (n³ + 5n + 6)/6. But wait, is that applicable here?Wait, but the cube&#39;s face planes aren&#39;t in general position; they are arranged orthogonally and in pairs. So the formula for maximum regions might not apply here because the planes are not all intersecting each other in different lines, etc. So maybe the cube&#39;s planes being orthogonal affect the number of regions. Let me visualize a cube.A cube has six faces, so each pair of opposite faces are parallel. So the three pairs of parallel planes. Each pair is perpendicular to the other two pairs. So like, the planes x=0 and x=1, y=0 and y=1, z=0 and z=1. These divide the space into regions. How many regions? Let&#39;s think step by step.Imagine starting with no planes. The whole space is one region. Then, add the first pair of planes, say x=0 and x=1. These divide the space into three regions along the x-axis: x &lt; 0, 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, and x &gt; 1. Now, add the next pair, y=0 and y=1. Each existing region is cut by the y-planes. How does that work?In 3D, when you add a pair of planes perpendicular to the y-axis, each existing region (which is like a slab along the x-axis) will be divided into three parts along the y-axis. So for each of the three existing regions, we get three new ones. So 3 * 3 = 9 regions after adding the y-planes. Then, adding the z=0 and z=1 planes, each existing region will be divided into three parts along the z-axis. So 9 * 3 = 27 regions. Wait, but that seems like 3³ = 27. But the cube&#39;s faces are at x=0,1; y=0,1; z=0,1. So the regions are all the orthants extended beyond the cube. So each direction is split into three parts (negative, between 0 and 1, positive), so 3*3*3=27 regions. That makes sense.But wait, let me verify. If we just have the three coordinate planes (x=0, y=0, z=0), they divide the space into 8 octants. Then, adding the opposite planes (x=1, y=1, z=1), each plane will add divisions. Hmm. Maybe another way to think is that each axis is divided into three intervals by the two planes on that axis. So for each axis, three intervals, and the total regions are the product of the number of intervals on each axis, which is 3*3*3=27. Yeah, that seems right.So part a) the answer is 27. Let me check with a simpler case. For example, if we have just one pair of planes, say x=0 and x=1, then space is divided into 3 regions. Adding y=0 and y=1, each of those 3 regions is split into 3 along y, so 9. Then adding z=0 and z=1, each of those 9 regions is split into 3 along z, giving 27. So that&#39;s consistent.Okay, so I think part a is 27.Now, part b: the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces. How many regions do they divide the space into? Hmm, tetrahedron. A regular tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each of which is a plane. The question is, how many regions do these four planes divide the space into?This seems trickier. Since a tetrahedron&#39;s faces are not orthogonal, so the planes are intersecting each other in edges (the edges of the tetrahedron). Each pair of faces intersect along an edge, and three edges meet at each vertex. So the arrangement is more complicated.To figure out the number of regions, maybe we can use inclusion-exclusion or some formula. But in three dimensions, the formula for regions created by n planes is more complicated when the planes are not in general position. The general maximum is given by R(n) = n³ + 5n + 6)/6, but for n=4, that would be (64 + 20 + 6)/6 = 90/6 = 15. But that&#39;s the maximum number of regions with 4 planes in general position, where no two planes are parallel and no three planes intersect along a common line. However, in the tetrahedron case, each pair of planes intersect along a line (the edges), and three planes meet at a vertex. So the tetrahedron&#39;s four planes are not in general position. Therefore, the number of regions might be less than 15.Wait, so how many regions do four planes of a tetrahedron create?Let me try to visualize a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a plane. If I take one plane, it divides space into two regions. Adding a second plane, which intersects the first along a line, divides space into four regions. Adding a third plane, which intersects the first two along different lines (but all three planes intersecting at a single point), how does that affect the count?Alternatively, maybe think incrementally. Let&#39;s add the planes one by one and see how the number of regions increases.First plane: splits space into 2 regions.Second plane: intersects the first plane along a line, so it adds two more regions, total 4.Third plane: intersects the first two planes along two different lines, which meet at a point (the vertex of the tetrahedron). The third plane will intersect the existing two planes, creating a triangle of intersection lines? Wait, no. In a tetrahedron, the third plane will intersect each of the first two planes along a line, and those two lines intersect at a vertex. So the third plane cuts through the existing arrangement. How many new regions does it create?In general, each new plane can intersect the previous planes in lines, and each line can divide existing regions. The maximum number of regions added by the nth plane is n, but when planes are not in general position, this number can be lower.Wait, in three dimensions, the maximum number of regions after n planes is R(n) = R(n-1) + n. Wait, no, that&#39;s the formula in two dimensions for lines. In three dimensions, it&#39;s R(n) = R(n-1) + n(n-1)/2 + 1? Wait, no, let me recall.Actually, the formula is similar to the 2D case but extended. In 3D, each new plane intersects all previous planes in lines, and these lines divide the new plane into regions, each corresponding to a new region in space. So the number of regions a new plane adds is equal to the number of regions it&#39;s divided into by the existing planes. For the k-th plane, it intersects the previous (k-1) planes in (k-1) lines, and these lines can divide the new plane into at most (k-1)(k)/2 +1 regions, by the 2D formula. Therefore, the maximum number of regions added by the k-th plane is (k² - k + 2)/2. But since we are dealing with a tetrahedron, the planes are not in general position, so the actual number of regions added might be less.But maybe instead of trying to remember formulas, let&#39;s compute it step by step for the tetrahedron.First plane (P1): splits space into 2 regions.Second plane (P2): intersects P1 along a line. Each plane is divided into two parts by the line of intersection. So adding P2 divides each existing region into two parts where they cross? Wait, in 3D, adding a second plane which intersects the first along a line will divide space into 4 regions. So after two planes, 4 regions.Third plane (P3): this plane intersects each of the first two planes along a separate line, and these two lines meet at a point (the vertex where all three planes meet). How does P3 divide the existing regions?Each existing region is potentially cut by P3. The third plane will intersect the previous two planes along two lines that meet at a vertex. The intersection lines on P3 are two lines intersecting at a point, so they divide P3 into four regions (like an &#39;X&#39; with a cross). Therefore, the third plane adds four new regions. Wait, but how does that translate to the 3D space? Wait, in 3D, when you add a plane, the number of new regions created is equal to the number of regions the plane is divided into by the intersections with existing planes.Since P3 intersects P1 and P2 each along a line, those two lines intersect at a point on P3. So on P3, there are two intersecting lines, dividing P3 into four regions. Therefore, adding P3 should divide space into four new regions. So total regions would be 4 (from two planes) + 4 = 8? But let&#39;s check.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider three planes intersecting at a single point (like the coordinate planes but not orthogonal). The three planes usually divide space into 8 regions, similar to the coordinate planes. But if the three planes are arranged like a tetrahedron&#39;s faces, maybe it&#39;s similar. Wait, a tetrahedron has four faces, but three of them meeting at a vertex. Wait, no, each vertex of a tetrahedron is where three edges and three faces meet. So three faces meet at each vertex.But actually, in a tetrahedron, each face is adjacent to the other three faces, right? Each pair of faces intersects along an edge. So the three planes (faces) intersecting along edges, and all three meeting at a vertex. So three planes, each pair intersecting along a line, and all three lines meeting at a common vertex. So in this case, how many regions do three planes create?In general, three planes can divide space into 8 regions if they are mutually orthogonal, like the coordinate planes. But if three planes intersect along lines that meet at a single point, but are not orthogonal, how many regions do they create? Let me think.Suppose we have three planes intersecting like the pages of a book, but each page is a different plane. If they all intersect along a common line, then they only create 6 regions. But in the tetrahedron case, the three planes intersect pairwise along three different lines, which all meet at a single point. So similar to three coordinate planes but maybe tilted. Wait, the three coordinate planes divide space into 8 octants. If we tilt them so they are no longer orthogonal, but still each pair intersecting along a line, and all three lines meeting at a point, would the number of regions still be 8?Hmm. Let&#39;s consider three planes: x=0, y=0, and x+y+z=0. These three planes intersect at the origin. Each pair intersects along a line: x=0 and y=0 intersect along the z-axis, x=0 and x+y+z=0 intersect along the line x=0, y + z =0, and y=0 and x+y+z=0 intersect along the line y=0, x + z =0. These three lines all meet at the origin. Do these three planes divide space into 8 regions? Let&#39;s think.If I take a point in the region where x&gt;0, y&gt;0, and x+y+z&gt;0. Then another region where x&gt;0, y&gt;0, x+y+z&lt;0. Similarly for other combinations. Since the third plane is x+y+z=0, it&#39;s a diagonal plane cutting through the positive and negative regions. So each octant defined by x&gt;0, y&gt;0, z&gt;0, etc., is further divided by the plane x+y+z=0. Wait, but actually, each of the original 4 regions (from x and y) would be split by the third plane into two. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.Wait, three planes in general position (no two parallel, no three intersecting along a common line) divide space into 8 regions. Wait, but in this case, the three planes do intersect along three different lines, but all three lines meet at the origin. So it&#39;s like three planes intersecting at a single point but not along the same line. So maybe they still divide space into 8 regions. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the number of regions is different. Let me take a concrete example. Take the three coordinate planes: x=0, y=0, z=0. They divide space into 8 octants. If instead, I have three planes that intersect at a single point but are not orthogonal, would they still create 8 regions?Suppose the three planes are all passing through the origin but are not orthogonal. For example, take x=0, y=0, and x + y =0. Wait, but x + y =0 is the same as z=any, but that&#39;s a vertical plane. Wait, x + y =0 and z=0 would be a line. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me look for a different approach.Alternatively, think of the tetrahedron&#39;s four faces. Each face is a plane. Let&#39;s try to compute the number of regions step by step by adding each face one by one.First plane (face 1): divides space into 2 regions.Second plane (face 2): intersects the first plane along a line (an edge of the tetrahedron). So adding the second plane divides space into 4 regions.Third plane (face 3): this plane intersects the first two planes along two different edges, which meet at a common vertex. The third plane will intersect the existing arrangement, which is already divided into 4 regions. How many regions does it add?Each existing region that the third plane passes through will be split into two. The number of regions added is equal to the number of regions the third plane passes through. If the third plane intersects the previous two planes along lines, then on the third plane, those lines divide it into regions. The intersection lines on the third plane are two lines meeting at a vertex, so they divide the third plane into 4 regions (like an &#39;X&#39;). Therefore, the third plane adds 4 regions. So total regions would be 4 + 4 = 8.Fourth plane (face 4): this is the last face of the tetrahedron. It needs to intersect the three existing planes. Each intersection is along an edge of the tetrahedron. So the fourth plane intersects each of the first three planes along a line (edge), and those three lines meet at the three vertices of the fourth face.On the fourth plane, the intersections with the previous three planes are three lines, forming a triangle (since the fourth face is a triangle). A triangle on the plane divides it into 7 regions? Wait, no. If you have three lines forming a triangle on a plane, they divide the plane into the interior of the triangle and 6 unbounded regions. Wait, actually, three lines in general position (no two parallel, not all intersecting at a single point) divide the plane into 7 regions. But in this case, the three lines form a triangle, so they are not all intersecting at a single point. Each pair intersects at a vertex of the triangle. So three lines forming a triangle divide the plane into an inner triangular region and 6 outer regions. So total 7 regions on the fourth plane.But how does that translate to the number of new regions added in space? Each region on the plane corresponds to a region in space that is split by the plane. So the number of new regions added is equal to the number of regions the fourth plane is divided into by the previous intersections, which is 7. Therefore, adding the fourth plane would add 7 regions. So total regions would be 8 + 7 = 15. Wait, but earlier, the maximum regions for four planes is 15. But in this case, the four planes of a tetrahedron are not in general position, but the calculation here gives 15. But that contradicts the earlier thought that non-general position would result in fewer regions. Hmm.Wait, maybe the formula isn&#39;t straightforward. Let me verify with an example.Alternatively, maybe the four planes of a tetrahedron do in fact divide space into 15 regions. But that seems high. Let me check with some references in my mind. Wait, the maximum number of regions with four planes is 15. If the four planes are in general position, meaning no two planes are parallel and no three planes intersect along a common line. However, in the case of a tetrahedron, each pair of planes intersect along a line (the edges), and three planes meet at each vertex. So the tetrahedron&#39;s four planes are not in general position because three planes meet at each vertex, creating lines of intersection (edges) where two planes meet. So the question is, does this arrangement still result in 15 regions?Wait, maybe the number is actually less. Let me think again step by step.First plane: 2 regions.Second plane: intersects the first along a line, adding 2 regions. Total 4.Third plane: intersects the first two planes along two different lines (edges). These two lines on the third plane meet at a vertex. So on the third plane, the two intersection lines divide it into 4 regions (as two intersecting lines). Therefore, adding the third plane should add 4 regions. Total 8.Fourth plane: intersects each of the first three planes along three different lines (the edges of the tetrahedron). These three lines on the fourth plane form a triangle. So on the fourth plane, the three lines (edges) divide it into 7 regions (the triangle and 6 unbounded regions). Thus, adding the fourth plane should add 7 regions, making the total 8 + 7 = 15.But that&#39;s the same as the maximum number. But how come even though the planes are not in general position, the number is still 15? Wait, maybe in this case, even though the planes are not in general position, the number of regions still reaches the maximum. Is that possible?Alternatively, maybe the formula for the maximum regions is when every new plane intersects all previous planes in lines that are not concurrent. In the tetrahedron case, the fourth plane intersects the three existing planes in three lines that form a triangle (so not concurrent). So even though the three lines on the fourth plane form a triangle, they don&#39;t all meet at a single point, hence they are in general position on that plane. Therefore, the fourth plane is divided into 7 regions by the three lines, hence adding 7 regions, leading to 15 total. Therefore, even though the four planes of the tetrahedron are not in general position in space (since three planes meet at each vertex), the intersection lines on each new plane are in general position (i.e., no two lines are parallel, and no three lines meet at a point on the plane), so each new plane is divided into the maximum number of regions by the existing intersections, leading to the total being the same as the maximum.Is that possible? Let me verify with a simpler case. For three planes, if the three planes intersect along three lines that meet at a single point in space, but on each plane, the two lines are intersecting at that point. So on each plane, the lines are concurrent. Wait, no. If we have three planes: P1, P2, P3. Each pair intersects along a line. If all three lines meet at a common point in space, then on each plane, the two lines intersect at that common point. So on plane P3, the lines of intersection with P1 and P2 meet at that common point, hence on plane P3, the two lines intersect at a point. Therefore, on plane P3, the two lines divide it into 4 regions. So adding P3 adds 4 regions, leading to total 8. But if the three planes were in general position, each pair intersecting along a separate line not meeting at a common point, then on plane P3, the two lines would be non-intersecting (parallel?) or intersecting at a different point. Wait, but in three-dimensional space, two lines from different planes can&#39;t be parallel unless the planes are arranged specifically.Wait, if three planes are in general position, meaning no two are parallel and no three intersect along a common line, then each pair intersects along a unique line, and the three lines do not all meet at a single point. Therefore, on the third plane, the two lines of intersection with the first two planes would intersect at a point not lying on the third plane&#39;s line of intersection with any other plane. Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, perhaps the key is that when adding the fourth plane of the tetrahedron, even though the three lines on it form a triangle, which is a set of three non-concurrent lines (each pair intersects at a different point), so on the plane, the three lines are in general position (for three lines on a plane, the maximum number of regions is 7). Therefore, adding such a plane adds 7 regions, leading to the total 15.Therefore, even though the four planes are part of a tetrahedron and not in general position in space, the intersections on each new plane are in general position for a plane, leading to the maximum number of regions. Therefore, the total number of regions is 15. But I need to verify this.Wait, actually, in the case of the tetrahedron, all four planes meet at a single point? No, each face of the tetrahedron is a plane, and the tetrahedron is a three-dimensional figure with four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices. Each vertex is where three edges meet, and three faces meet at each vertex. So, each set of three planes (faces) intersect at a vertex. Therefore, each of the four vertices is the intersection point of three planes. So, in total, the four planes form an arrangement where every three planes meet at a vertex, but no four planes meet at a single point.But how does this affect the regions? Let&#39;s try to imagine.Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the number of regions created by an arrangement of planes. The formula is:R = 1 + n + (n choose 2) + (n choose 3) - (number of intersections where three planes meet at a point).Wait, no, the formula for regions created by planes in 3D is more complicated. In general, for n planes in general position (no two parallel, no three meet along a common line, no four meet at a point), the number of regions is:R(n) = n³ + 5n + 6)/6.But when planes are not in general position, the number is less. The formula can be adjusted by subtracting the overlaps.Alternatively, another approach: Each region can be characterized by its position relative to each plane (either on one side or the other). However, due to the dependencies between the planes, not all combinations are possible.In the case of the tetrahedron&#39;s four planes, how many possible regions are there?Alternatively, imagine the tetrahedron. The four planes extend infinitely, dividing space into regions. Each region is either inside the tetrahedron or outside. Wait, but the tetrahedron is a bounded figure, but the planes extend infinitely. So the regions created by the four planes would include the space inside the tetrahedron and various regions outside. But how many?Wait, actually, the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces divide space into 15 regions. This seems to be a known result. Wait, if I recall, the formula for the number of regions created by the faces of a convex polyhedron is similar to Euler&#39;s formula. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, using Euler&#39;s formula for the arrangement. In three dimensions, the number of regions can be calculated using the formula:R = 1 + n + (number of lines of intersection) + (number of vertices).But I need to check the exact formula.Wait, actually, in three dimensions, the formula for regions formed by an arrangement of planes is given by:R = n(n² - n + 6)/6But that might be for certain conditions.Alternatively, the formula is:R = 1 + n + S + VWhere S is the number of intersections of two planes (lines), and V is the number of intersections of three planes (points). But I need to verify.Wait, actually, the general formula for the number of regions created by n planes in three dimensions is:R = 1 + n + (n choose 2) + (n choose 3) - m - kWhere m is the number of pairs of parallel planes, and k is the number of triple planes intersecting along a common line, or something like that. This is getting too vague.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the inclusion-exclusion principle for plane arrangements. The number of regions can be calculated as:R = Σ_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k C(n, k)Wait, no. Maybe not.Alternatively, for an arrangement of planes, the number of regions is equal to:R = 1 + n + (number of lines) + (number of vertices)But I need to recall the formula correctly.Wait, actually, for an arrangement of planes in three dimensions, the number of regions R can be calculated using the formula:R = n + 1 + ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} (i + 1 - t_i)Where t_i is the number of intersections of the i-th plane with the previous ones. Wait, this seems too vague.Alternatively, for each plane, the number of regions it adds is 1 + the number of intersections it has with previous planes.Wait, in two dimensions, the number of regions added by the n-th line is n. In three dimensions, the number of regions added by the n-th plane is 1 + the number of intersections with previous planes. Wait, but intersections are lines. Each line on the new plane can divide it into more regions. So, if the n-th plane intersects the previous (n-1) planes in (n-1) lines, then those lines can divide the new plane into (n² - n + 2)/2 regions, by the two-dimensional formula. Therefore, the number of regions added by the n-th plane is (n² - n + 2)/2.But in the tetrahedron case, when adding the fourth plane, how many intersections does it have with the previous three? Each of the three previous planes intersects the fourth plane along a line (the edges of the tetrahedron). Therefore, the fourth plane is intersected by three lines, which form a triangle. In two dimensions, three lines forming a triangle divide the plane into 7 regions. Therefore, the number of regions added by the fourth plane is 7. So following the step-by-step:First plane: 2 regions.Second plane: intersects the first in a line, adding 2 regions, total 4.Third plane: intersects each of the first two planes in a line, which meet at a vertex. The two lines divide the third plane into 4 regions, so adding 4 regions, total 8.Fourth plane: intersects each of the first three planes in a line, forming a triangle on the fourth plane. The three lines divide the fourth plane into 7 regions, so adding 7 regions, total 15.Therefore, the total number of regions created by the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces is 15. But this seems to be the same as the maximum number of regions for four planes, which is 15. So even though the tetrahedron&#39;s planes are not in general position (they intersect three at a point), the number of regions still reaches the maximum. That&#39;s interesting.But to confirm, let&#39;s think about the tetrahedron. Each face plane extends infinitely. The regions inside the tetrahedron is one region. Then, each face contributes regions outside. But considering all four planes, the regions would be:1. Inside the tetrahedron.2. Regions adjacent to each face.3. Regions adjacent to each edge.4. Regions adjacent to each vertex.But how many?Alternatively, think of the tetrahedron as a cell complex. The four planes divide space into regions. The number can be calculated using the formula related to the Euler characteristic. For a three-dimensional arrangement, Euler&#39;s formula is:V - E + F - R = 0But I need to recall the exact formula. Alternatively, in three dimensions, the formula relating the number of vertices (V), edges (E), faces (F), and regions (R) for a plane arrangement is:V - E + F - R = 1But I need to verify.Alternatively, the formula for a convex polyhedron is V - E + F = 2, but for an infinite arrangement of planes, it&#39;s different.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute the number of vertices, edges, faces, and regions.In the case of the tetrahedron&#39;s four planes:Each pair of planes intersect along a line (the edges of the tetrahedron). There are C(4,2)=6 edges. But each original edge of the tetrahedron is an intersection line of two planes, and since the tetrahedron has 6 edges, but wait, no. Wait, a tetrahedron has 4 faces, each pair of faces intersect along an edge, so there are C(4,2)=6 edges. Wait, no. Wait, a tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces, each face has 3 edges, but each edge is shared by two faces. Therefore, the number of edges is (4*3)/2=6. So there are 6 lines of intersection (edges) from the four planes.Each three planes intersect at a vertex. The tetrahedron has 4 vertices, each being the intersection of three planes. So V = 4 vertices.But wait, in reality, each line (edge) is the intersection of two planes, and each vertex is the intersection of three planes (and three edges). So in the arrangement of four planes, the number of vertices is 4 (the vertices of the tetrahedron), and the number of edges (lines of intersection) is 6.The number of faces (portions of the planes) can be calculated. Each plane is divided by its intersections with the other three planes into regions. Each plane is intersected by three lines (edges), forming a triangle on the plane. So each plane has 3 lines dividing it into 7 regions (as before). But since each plane is part of the original tetrahedron, each plane has one bounded triangular face and six unbounded regions. However, when considering all four planes, the total number of faces would be 4 planes * 7 regions per plane, but this counts each face from both sides, so we need to divide by 2. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, each region on a plane is a face in the arrangement. Each of the 6 edges is shared by two planes, and each edge is divided into segments by the vertices. Each vertex is where three edges meet.This is getting too complicated. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, use the formula for the number of regions created by four planes:R = 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15. Wait, where does this come from? If we take the general formula for regions created by n planes, which is similar to the inclusion-exclusion formula:R(n) = n^0 + n^1 + n^2 + n^3 / 6... Wait, no. Wait, the formula for regions in 3D is:R(n) = R(n-1) + n(n-1)/2 + 1But this is not correct.Wait, let me look up the formula for regions formed by n planes in three dimensions. The maximum number is indeed R(n) = (n^3 + 5n + 6)/6. For n=1, R=2; n=2, R=4; n=3, R=8; n=4, R=15.Yes, that&#39;s the formula. So for four planes in general position, the number is 15. But in our case, the four planes are not in general position because every three planes intersect at a point (the tetrahedron&#39;s vertices). However, as we added the fourth plane, it still added 7 regions, leading to the total of 15. Therefore, even with the non-general position, we still get the maximum number of regions. How is that possible?Wait, perhaps because although three planes intersect at a point, when adding the fourth plane, it doesn&#39;t pass through that point, so the number of intersections is not reduced. Wait, in the tetrahedron, each three planes intersect at a vertex, but the fourth plane does not pass through that vertex. Wait, no. In a tetrahedron, each vertex is where three planes meet, and the fourth plane does not pass through that vertex. Because in a tetrahedron, each vertex is only part of three faces, the fourth face is opposite and doesn&#39;t pass through that vertex. Therefore, when adding the fourth plane, it doesn&#39;t pass through any of the existing vertices where three planes meet. Therefore, the intersections on the fourth plane are three lines that don&#39;t intersect at a common point, forming a triangle. Therefore, those three lines on the fourth plane are in general position (forming a triangle), thereby dividing the plane into 7 regions. Hence, adding the fourth plane adds 7 regions, leading to the total 15.Therefore, even though the four planes are part of a tetrahedron and meet three at a vertex, the fourth plane&#39;s intersections with the previous three planes are three lines that do not concur at a point on the fourth plane, hence allowing the maximum number of regions to be added. Therefore, the total number of regions is indeed 15.But I need to verify this with a concrete example. Let&#39;s take a regular tetrahedron and analyze the regions.Imagine a regular tetrahedron with vertices at (1,1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1), and (1,-1,-1). The equations of its faces can be derived, but this might get complex. Alternatively, consider the symmetry. The four planes of the tetrahedron divide the space into regions that are symmetric with respect to the tetrahedron&#39;s geometry. Each region is either inside the tetrahedron or in one of the external regions. But counting them is difficult without a diagram.Alternatively, another approach: the four planes of the tetrahedron form an arrangement where each plane is intersected by the other three in three lines (edges), and each trio of planes intersects at a vertex. The number of regions can be calculated using the formula:R = 1 + n + number of edges + number of vertices.Wait, but in three dimensions, maybe:The formula is:Regions = 1 + planes + lines + points.But for n=4 planes:Planes = 4Lines = 6 (each pair of planes intersects in a line)Points = 4 (each trio of planes intersects at a point)Then, Regions = 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15. So that gives 15 regions. Is this a valid formula? Let me check for n=1:1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2. Correct.For n=2:1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 4. Correct.For n=3:1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8. Correct.For n=4:1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15. Correct.So yes, this formula seems to work. So in general, for an arrangement of n planes in three dimensions, where each pair of planes intersects in a unique line, and each three planes intersect in a unique point (which is the case for the tetrahedron), the number of regions is 1 + n + C(n,2) + C(n,3). Which for n=4 gives 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15.But wait, this formula is actually the same as the inclusion-exclusion formula:R(n) = C(n,0) + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + C(n,3).Which for n=4 is 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15.But this formula holds when each new plane intersects all previous planes in distinct lines and all previous lines in distinct points, which seems to be the case for the tetrahedron. Therefore, even though the planes are part of a tetrahedron and not in general position (as in, each three planes intersect at a point), the formula still holds because each new plane intersects the previous planes in lines that do not intersect at a common point on the new plane, hence allowing the maximum number of regions to be formed.Therefore, the number of regions created by the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces is 15.But wait, this contradicts some sources I recall. For example, some references state that the four planes of a tetrahedron divide space into 15 regions, which is the same as four planes in general position. However, other sources suggest that non-general position arrangements can result in fewer regions, but in this specific case, it&#39;s still 15. Therefore, the answer to part b is 15.Wait, but let me check with another method. Consider the following: each of the four planes divides space into two halves. The regions can be characterized by their position relative to each plane (either &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;outside&quot; the tetrahedron). However, not all combinations are possible due to the tetrahedron&#39;s geometry. For example, you can&#39;t be inside all four planes simultaneously because the tetrahedron is a convex polyhedron; the intersection of all four half-spaces defined by the planes is the tetrahedron itself, which is a bounded region. Therefore, there is exactly one region inside the tetrahedron. The remaining regions are outside.So total regions = 1 (inside) + regions outside.How many regions outside? Each face contributes regions adjacent to it, each edge contributes regions adjacent to it, and each vertex contributes regions adjacent to it.In three dimensions, for a convex polyhedron, the number of regions created by its face planes is given by:Regions = 1 + F + E + VWhere F is the number of faces, E the number of edges, V the number of vertices.For a tetrahedron, F=4, E=6, V=4. Therefore, regions = 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15. This matches our previous result. Therefore, this formula gives 15 regions.Hence, part b) the answer is 15.So, in summary:a) The six face planes of a cube divide space into 27 regions.b) The four face planes of a tetrahedron divide space into 15 regions.Final Answera) boxed{27}b) boxed{15}&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many regions the space is divided into by the given planes: Part a) Six planes of the cube&#39;s facesA cube has three pairs of parallel planes (x=0, x=1; y=0, y=1; z=0, z=1). Each pair of planes divides the space into three regions along their respective axis. The total number of regions is the product of the divisions along each axis:- Each axis (x, y, z) is divided into 3 intervals.- The total number of regions is (3 times 3 times 3 = 27).Thus, the number of regions created by the six planes of the cube&#39;s faces is (boxed{27}). Part b) Four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s facesA tetrahedron has four triangular faces. The number of regions created by these four planes can be calculated using the formula for regions formed by an arrangement of planes in three dimensions. The formula is:[ R = 1 + n + binom{n}{2} + binom{n}{3} ]where (n) is the number of planes. For (n = 4):[ R = 1 + 4 + binom{4}{2} + binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15 ]Thus, the number of regions created by the four planes of the tetrahedron&#39;s faces is (boxed{15}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span># I. solution:a) First, we consider the planes of two parallel faces of the cube. These two planes divide the space into 3 parts. A plane perpendicular to these and belonging to one of the other faces divides each of these space parts in half, so the three planes delimit 6 space parts. The plane of the face parallel to the previous one divides three of these 6 space parts in half, so the four planes delimit 9 space parts. The two planes of the third pair of faces divide each of these space parts into 3 parts, so in the end, 27 space parts are formed, of which only the one that the cube fills is finite.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_03006199ff90eba78debg-1.jpg?height=780&amp;width=665&amp;top_left_y=350&amp;top_left_x=730)b) The plane of one face of the tetrahedron ABCD (e.g., the unmarked plane ACD) divides the space into 2 parts. Another face plane (e.g., the densely dashed ABD) divides each of the previous 2 space parts in half, so the two intersecting planes delimit 4 space parts. The third plane (the sparsely dashed BCD) divides each of the previously formed space parts in half, as it is not parallel to either of the first two planes and does not pass through their intersection line. Thus, the three planes delimit 8 space parts, as shown in the figure. The fourth plane (ABC), which we have not separately visualized, divides each of the previously formed space parts into two, except for the one labeled 8, which is bounded by the tetrahedron&#39;s vertex trihedron at vertex D. Thus, a total of 8+7=15 space parts are formed, of which only the one that the tetrahedron fills is finite.Anna Mestyán (Debrecen, Svetits lg. IV. o. t.)II. solution: If we connect a point inside the cube to one of its vertices, then this point, intersecting the 3 planes meeting at the vertex (i.e., passing through the mentioned vertex), ends up in a space part delimited by these 3 planes, and remains in this space part because it does not intersect any new plane; thus, a space part is connected to each vertex of the cube. If we draw a line from a point inside the cube perpendicular to one of its edges, then this line, after intersecting the edge, or rather the intersection of the two planes meeting at the edge, ends up in a space part whose two bounding planes are the planes of the two cube faces meeting at the edge. This space part is also infinite because the line does not intersect any new plane after intersecting the edge. Finally, if we draw a perpendicular from a point inside the cube to one of its faces, then this line, after intersecting a single face, ends up in an infinite space part. Considering that we end up in the space part connected to a vertex after intersecting 3 planes, while we end up in the space part connected to an edge after intersecting only 2 planes, these two space parts cannot be the same. They can have two bounding planes in common (if the vertex is exactly on the edge in question), but even then, they are separated by the plane that we did not intersect when we ended up in the space part connected to the edge. Similarly, it can be shown that the space part connected to a face is different from the previous two. Since the number of space parts connected to a vertex is equal to the number of vertices, the number of space parts connected to an edge is equal to the number of edges, and the number of space parts connected to a face is equal to the number of faces, the total number of space parts is: 8+12+6 infinite +1 finite space part, or a total of 27 space parts. Our visualization shows that the counted space parts fill the entire space, so we have indeed counted all the space parts in the manner mentioned.b) In the case of the tetrahedron, using a completely similar line of thought, we arrive at the number of space parts being 4+6+4+1=15.Károly Legéndy (Bp. VIII., Apáczai Csere g. IV. o. t.)Note: After the counting method described in the second solution, it is not superfluous to check whether the mentioned space parts fill the entire space.(See problem 690 in this issue).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-95d0d1ff data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review" data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review-title" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>❓:</span>Let theta in left(frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}right), and sin 2theta = frac{1}{16}.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities that might help here.First, I know that sin2θ = 2sinθcosθ. The problem gives sin2θ = 1/16, so that means 2sinθcosθ = 1/16. Maybe I can use this to relate sinθ and cosθ somehow. But the question is asking for cosθ - sinθ. Hmm, how do I connect these?I remember that (cosθ - sinθ)^2 equals cos²θ - 2sinθcosθ + sin²θ. Let me write that down:(cosθ - sinθ)^2 = cos²θ - 2sinθcosθ + sin²θ.But cos²θ + sin²θ is equal to 1, right? So substituting that in:(cosθ - sinθ)^2 = 1 - 2sinθcosθ.Wait, and 2sinθcosθ is exactly sin2θ, which we already know is 1/16. So substituting that in:(cosθ - sinθ)^2 = 1 - (1/16).Calculating that: 1 - 1/16 is 15/16. Therefore,(cosθ - sinθ)^2 = 15/16.Taking the square root of both sides gives:cosθ - sinθ = ±√(15/16) = ±(√15)/4.Now, we have to determine whether the answer is positive or negative. The problem states that θ is in (π/4, π/2). Let me think about the values of cosθ and sinθ in that interval.In the first quadrant (0 to π/2), both cosθ and sinθ are positive. But θ is between π/4 and π/2. Let&#39;s compare cosθ and sinθ in that range.At θ = π/4, cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. As θ increases from π/4 to π/2, cosθ decreases from √2/2 to 0, and sinθ increases from √2/2 to 1. So, for θ &gt; π/4, sinθ is greater than cosθ. Therefore, cosθ - sinθ would be negative.Therefore, we take the negative root:cosθ - sinθ = -√15/4.Looking at the options, that&#39;s option B or D. Wait, the options given are:A: √15/4B: -√15/4C: 3/4D: -3/4So, √15 is approximately 3.872, so √15/4 is approximately 0.968, and 3/4 is 0.75. The answer we got is -√15/4, which is option B. Therefore, the answer should be B.But wait, let me double-check. Let me verify my steps.First, using the identity (cosθ - sinθ)^2 = 1 - sin2θ. Wait, hold on:Wait, (cosθ - sinθ)^2 = cos²θ - 2sinθcosθ + sin²θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ) - 2sinθcosθ = 1 - sin2θ. Since sin2θ = 1/16, then (cosθ - sinθ)^2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16. So that&#39;s correct.Then, taking the square root gives ±√15/4. Then, since θ is in (π/4, π/2), sinθ &gt; cosθ, so cosθ - sinθ is negative. Therefore, the answer is -√15/4, which is option B.Therefore, the correct answer is B.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another way to approach this. Maybe by finding θ first?Given sin2θ = 1/16 and θ is between π/4 and π/2. Then 2θ is between π/2 and π. So, 2θ is in the second quadrant. Therefore, sin2θ = 1/16, which is positive, as expected in the second quadrant.So, if 2θ is in the second quadrant, then cos2θ would be negative. Let me compute cos2θ using the identity cos²2θ + sin²2θ = 1. So cos2θ = ±√(1 - sin²2θ) = ±√(1 - (1/16)^2) = ±√(1 - 1/256) = ±√(255/256) = ±(√255)/16. Since 2θ is in the second quadrant, cos2θ is negative. Therefore, cos2θ = -√255/16.But how does this help me? Maybe using another identity to relate cosθ - sinθ?Alternatively, we can express cosθ - sinθ in terms of sqrt(2)cos(θ + π/4). Wait, let&#39;s see:cosθ - sinθ = sqrt(2)cos(θ + π/4). But I&#39;m not sure if that helps. Let me verify that identity.Yes, using the cosine addition formula:sqrt(2)cos(θ + π/4) = sqrt(2)[cosθ cosπ/4 - sinθ sinπ/4] = sqrt(2)[(cosθ)(√2/2) - (sinθ)(√2/2)] = sqrt(2)*(√2/2)(cosθ - sinθ) = (2/2)(cosθ - sinθ) = cosθ - sinθ. So yes, cosθ - sinθ = sqrt(2)cos(θ + π/4). Hmm, interesting. So if I can find θ + π/4, maybe?But perhaps this complicates things more. Let me see. Alternatively, if I can find θ, but since θ is between π/4 and π/2, 2θ is between π/2 and π, so 2θ = π - arcsin(1/16). Then θ = (π - arcsin(1/16))/2. But that might not be helpful numerically. Alternatively, maybe we can use the double angle formula for cosine?Wait, cos2θ = 1 - 2sin²θ, or 2cos²θ - 1. But since we know cos2θ = -√255/16, which is negative. Let&#39;s try to compute cosθ - sinθ.Alternatively, let&#39;s let x = cosθ - sinθ. We know x^2 = 15/16, so x = ±√15/4. As established, x is negative. But just to confirm, let&#39;s compute θ numerically.Wait, maybe it&#39;s overcomplicating, but let&#39;s see. If sin2θ = 1/16, then 2θ = arcsin(1/16). But since 2θ is in the second quadrant, 2θ = π - arcsin(1/16). Therefore, θ = (π - arcsin(1/16))/2.Let me compute arcsin(1/16). Since 1/16 is approximately 0.0625, arcsin(0.0625) is approximately 0.0626 radians. So, θ ≈ (π - 0.0626)/2 ≈ (3.1416 - 0.0626)/2 ≈ 3.079/2 ≈ 1.5395 radians. Since π/2 is approximately 1.5708 radians, so θ is approximately 1.5395, which is just slightly less than π/2. Therefore, θ is close to π/2, so sinθ is close to 1, and cosθ is close to 0. So, cosθ - sinθ should be approximately 0 - 1 = -1. But the answer we have is -√15/4 ≈ -0.968, which is close to -1, which makes sense. So that seems reasonable.Alternatively, if θ were exactly π/4, cosθ - sinθ would be 0, and as θ approaches π/2, cosθ - sinθ approaches -1. So given that θ is between π/4 and π/2, and sin2θ = 1/16 is a small positive number, which would mean that 2θ is just slightly more than π/2? Wait, no. Wait, sin2θ = 1/16, which is a small value. So 2θ is in the second quadrant where the sine is positive but decreasing from 1 to 0 as the angle goes from π/2 to π. Since sin2θ = 1/16, which is small, that means 2θ is close to π. Therefore, θ is close to π/2. So that&#39;s consistent with our previous conclusion.Therefore, cosθ - sinθ should indeed be negative and close to -1. So -√15/4 ≈ -0.968 is the right answer, which is option B.Therefore, I think the correct answer is B: -√15/4.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given (theta in left(frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}right)) and (sin 2theta = frac{1}{16}), we need to find the value of (costheta - sintheta).First, we use the identity for ((costheta - sintheta)^2):[(costheta - sintheta)^2 = cos^2theta - 2sinthetacostheta + sin^2theta]Since (cos^2theta + sin^2theta = 1), we substitute:[(costheta - sintheta)^2 = 1 - 2sinthetacostheta]We know that (sin 2theta = 2sinthetacostheta = frac{1}{16}), so:[(costheta - sintheta)^2 = 1 - frac{1}{16} = frac{15}{16}]Taking the square root of both sides, we get:[costheta - sintheta = pmfrac{sqrt{15}}{4}]Since (theta in left(frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}right)), (sintheta &gt; costheta), making (costheta - sintheta) negative. Therefore, we choose the negative root:[costheta - sintheta = -frac{sqrt{15}}{4}]Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of cosθ - sinθ given that θ is between π/4 and π/2, and sin2θ = 1/16. Let&#39;s start by recalling some trigonometric identities that might help here. First, I remember that sin2θ = 2sinθcosθ. The problem gives me sin2θ = 1/16, so that means 2sinθcosθ = 1/16. Maybe I can use this to find sinθ and cosθ individually, but I&#39;m not sure yet. Alternatively, I need to find cosθ - sinθ. Hmm, perhaps I can square this expression to relate it to sin2θ?Let me try squaring cosθ - sinθ. So, (cosθ - sinθ)^2 = cos²θ - 2sinθcosθ + sin²θ. I know that cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so substituting that in, this becomes 1 - 2sinθcosθ. But wait, 2sinθcosθ is exactly sin2θ, which we know is 1/16. So substituting that in, we have (cosθ - sinθ)^2 = 1 - (1/16) = 15/16.Therefore, the square of cosθ - sinθ is 15/16, which means that cosθ - sinθ is either sqrt(15)/4 or -sqrt(15)/4. But we need to determine the correct sign based on the interval where θ lies. The problem states that θ is between π/4 and π/2. Let me think about the values of cosθ and sinθ in this interval.In the interval (π/4, π/2), θ is in the first quadrant, so both sinθ and cosθ are positive. However, since θ is greater than π/4, which is 45 degrees, we know that sinθ &gt; cosθ because sin increases from π/4 to π/2 while cos decreases. So sinθ is greater than cosθ in this interval. Therefore, cosθ - sinθ would be negative because we are subtracting a larger positive number (sinθ) from a smaller positive number (cosθ). Therefore, cosθ - sinθ must be negative, so the negative square root is the correct one. Hence, cosθ - sinθ = -sqrt(15)/4.Looking at the options, B is -sqrt(15)/4, so that should be the answer. But let me verify to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes.Let me recap: I squared cosθ - sinθ to get 15/16, so square roots are ±sqrt(15)/4. Since θ is between π/4 and π/2, cosθ &lt; sinθ, so their difference is negative. Therefore, the answer is negative sqrt(15)/4, which is option B. That seems right.Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check with specific values. Let&#39;s suppose θ is some angle in (π/4, π/2) where sin2θ = 1/16. Let me compute θ. If sin2θ = 1/16, then 2θ is in (π/2, π) because θ is in (π/4, π/2). So 2θ is in the second quadrant. The reference angle would be arcsin(1/16). Then 2θ = π - arcsin(1/16), so θ = (π - arcsin(1/16))/2. But maybe instead of calculating the exact angle, I can compute cosθ - sinθ using another identity. Alternatively, since we know sin2θ and we can find cos2θ, maybe that can help. Let&#39;s recall that cos²θ - sin²θ = cos2θ. But we also have (cosθ - sinθ)^2 = 15/16. Wait, we already used that. Alternatively, let&#39;s compute cos2θ. Since sin2θ = 1/16, then cos2θ = sqrt(1 - (1/16)^2) but wait, cos2θ can be positive or negative. But since 2θ is in the second quadrant (π/2 &lt; 2θ &lt; π), cos2θ is negative. So cos2θ = -sqrt(1 - (1/16)^2) = -sqrt(255/256) = -sqrt(255)/16 ≈ -15.97/16 ≈ -0.998. Wait, but sqrt(255) is approximately 15.97, so sqrt(255)/16 ≈ 0.998, so cos2θ ≈ -0.998. But cos2θ is also equal to cos²θ - sin²θ. Which is (cosθ - sinθ)(cosθ + sinθ). Hmm, we have cos2θ = (cosθ - sinθ)(cosθ + sinθ). So if we can find cosθ + sinθ, we can find cosθ - sinθ by dividing cos2θ by (cosθ + sinθ). Let&#39;s see.We know (cosθ + sinθ)^2 = cos²θ + 2sinθcosθ + sin²θ = 1 + sin2θ = 1 + 1/16 = 17/16. Therefore, cosθ + sinθ = sqrt(17/16) = sqrt(17)/4, since cosθ + sinθ is positive in the first quadrant. Therefore, cosθ + sinθ = sqrt(17)/4. Then, since cos2θ = (cosθ - sinθ)(cosθ + sinθ), we have:cosθ - sinθ = cos2θ / (cosθ + sinθ) = (-sqrt(255)/16) / (sqrt(17)/4) = (-sqrt(255)/16) * (4/sqrt(17)) = (-sqrt(255)/4) * (1/sqrt(17)) = -sqrt(255)/ (4*sqrt(17)) = -sqrt(15) /4. Wait, because sqrt(255) = sqrt(15*17) = sqrt(15)*sqrt(17), so sqrt(255)/sqrt(17) = sqrt(15). Therefore, that simplifies to -sqrt(15)/4, which matches our previous result. Therefore, this confirms that cosθ - sinθ is indeed -sqrt(15)/4, which is option B.Therefore, I feel confident that the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given (theta in left(frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}right)) and (sin 2theta = frac{1}{16}), we need to find the value of (costheta - sintheta).First, we use the identity for (sin 2theta):[sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta = frac{1}{16}]Next, we square (costheta - sintheta):[(costheta - sintheta)^2 = cos^2theta - 2 sintheta costheta + sin^2theta]Using the Pythagorean identity (cos^2theta + sin^2theta = 1), we substitute:[(costheta - sintheta)^2 = 1 - 2 sintheta costheta]Since (2 sintheta costheta = sin 2theta = frac{1}{16}), we substitute this value:[(costheta - sintheta)^2 = 1 - frac{1}{16} = frac{15}{16}]Taking the square root of both sides, we get:[costheta - sintheta = pm frac{sqrt{15}}{4}]To determine the sign, we note that (theta) is in the interval (left(frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}right)). In this interval, (sintheta &gt; costheta), so (costheta - sintheta) must be negative.
