Let me see. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 1, the magnitude of vector b is 2, vector c is the sum of a and b, and vector c is perpendicular to vector a. Hmm, right. Since c is perpendicular to a, their dot product must be zero. That seems important.Let me write down what I know:- |a| = 1- |b| = 2- c = a + b- c is perpendicular to a, which means c · a = 0Since c is a + b, substituting that into the dot product gives (a + b) · a = 0. Let me compute that:(a + b) · a = a · a + b · a = |a|² + b · a = 0Since |a| is 1, |a|² is 1. So this simplifies to 1 + (b · a) = 0. Therefore, b · a = -1.But the dot product of b and a is also equal to |b||a|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. Let me write that:b · a = |b||a|cosθ = 2 * 1 * cosθ = 2cosθFrom earlier, we have b · a = -1, so:2cosθ = -1Therefore, cosθ = -1/2Now, I need to find the angle θ where cosine is -1/2. Let me recall the unit circle. Cosine is -1/2 at 120 degrees and 240 degrees. But since angles between vectors are measured between 0 and 180 degrees, the angle must be 120 degrees.Wait, let me confirm. If the cosine is negative, the angle is in the second quadrant, so between 90 and 180 degrees. And cos(120°) is indeed -1/2. Yes, because 120° is π/3 radians more than 90°, which is π/2. Wait, actually, 120° is 2π/3 radians. And cos(2π/3) is equal to -1/2. Right.So the angle between vectors a and b is 120 degrees, or 2π/3 radians. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.First, c = a + b is perpendicular to a, so their dot product is zero. Expanded, that gives a·a + a·b = 0. Then since |a|² is 1, that becomes 1 + a·b = 0, leading to a·b = -1. Then using the formula for the dot product, |a||b|cosθ = -1. Plugging in the magnitudes, 1*2*cosθ = -1, so cosθ = -1/2. Then θ is 120 degrees. That seems correct.I don&#39;t think I made any errors here. Each step follows logically. The key was recognizing that the perpendicularity condition translates to the dot product being zero, which allows solving for the cosine of the angle. Then it&#39;s just a matter of knowing the standard angles and their cosine values. Yep, that all adds up.Final AnswerThe angle between vector (vec{a}) and vector (vec{b}) is boxed{120^circ}.&lt;/think&gt;Given (|vec{a}| = 1), (|vec{b}| = 2), (vec{c} = vec{a} + vec{b}), and (vec{c} perp vec{a}), we need to find the angle between vectors (vec{a}) and (vec{b}).Since (vec{c}) is perpendicular to (vec{a}), their dot product is zero:[vec{c} cdot vec{a} = 0]Substituting (vec{c} = vec{a} + vec{b}) into the dot product equation:[(vec{a} + vec{b}) cdot vec{a} = 0]Expanding the dot product:[vec{a} cdot vec{a} + vec{b} cdot vec{a} = 0]This simplifies to:[|vec{a}|^2 + vec{b} cdot vec{a} = 0]Given (|vec{a}| = 1), we have:[1 + vec{b} cdot vec{a} = 0]Thus:[vec{b} cdot vec{a} = -1]The dot product (vec{b} cdot vec{a}) can also be expressed as:[|vec{b}||vec{a}|costheta = 2 cdot 1 cdot costheta = 2costheta]Equating the two expressions for the dot product:[2costheta = -1]Solving for (costheta):[costheta = -frac{1}{2}]The angle (theta) whose cosine is (-frac{1}{2}) is (120^circ) (or (2pi/3) radians).Thus, the angle between vector (vec{a}) and vector (vec{b}) is (boxed{120^circ}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the angle between vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 1, the magnitude of vector b is 2, and vector c is the sum of a and b. Also, vector c is perpendicular to vector a. Hmm, right. Since they mention vectors and angles, I think this is a problem involving dot products. Yeah, because dot products relate to angles between vectors.First, let me recall that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So since c is perpendicular to a, then c · a = 0. But c is a + b, so substituting that in, we have (a + b) · a = 0. Let me write that down:(a + b) · a = 0Expanding that dot product, it becomes:a · a + b · a = 0I know that the dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude. So a · a = |a|² = 1² = 1. Similarly, b · a is the same as a · b, which is |a||b|cosθ, where θ is the angle between a and b. So substituting that in:1 + |a||b|cosθ = 0We know |a| is 1 and |b| is 2, so plugging those values in:1 + (1)(2)cosθ = 0Simplify that:1 + 2cosθ = 0Subtracting 1 from both sides:2cosθ = -1Divide both sides by 2:cosθ = -1/2Now, to find θ, we take the arccosine of -1/2. Hmm, what angle has a cosine of -1/2? I remember that cos(120°) = -1/2. Because 60 degrees is 0.5, so 180 - 60 is 120, and cosine is negative in the second quadrant. So θ is 120 degrees, or in radians that&#39;s 2π/3. Since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, but in math problems angles between vectors are often expected in radians unless stated otherwise. But maybe degrees are okay here. Let me check if the question mentions anything. No, it just says &quot;angle,&quot; so maybe either is acceptable, but I should confirm. Wait, in calculus and vector problems, radians are standard. But 120 degrees is more intuitive. Wait, let me check. If the answer is 120°, then it&#39;s 120°, but in terms of radians, 2π/3. The problem didn&#39;t specify, so I can present it either way, but maybe the answer expects radians. Let me see. Since pi/3 is 60 degrees, so 2pi/3 is 120 degrees. Probably the answer is 120 degrees or 2pi/3 radians. The problem is given with magnitudes as 1 and 2, which are unitless, so perhaps either is acceptable. But in higher-level math, radians are more common. Let me check again.But the problem says &quot;find the angle between vector a and vector b.&quot; In standard math problems, unless specified, angles between vectors can be in degrees or radians, but it&#39;s safer to use radians. However, sometimes degrees are used when the angle is a common one like 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, etc. Since 120 degrees is a common angle and pi/3 is common in radians, but 2pi/3 is the exact value. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting from c = a + b, c is perpendicular to a, so c · a = 0. Then expanding gives a · a + a · b = 0. Then substituting magnitudes: |a|² + |a||b|cosθ = 0. Then 1 + 2cosθ = 0. So cosθ = -1/2. That&#39;s correct. Arccos(-1/2) is 120 degrees or 2pi/3 radians. Since trigonometric functions in calculus use radians, and the problem seems to be in a math context, I think 2pi/3 is the better answer here. Let me verify with another approach.Alternatively, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since c is perpendicular to a. So the vectors a and c form a right angle, and c = a + b. So maybe we can consider the triangle formed by vectors a, b, and c. Wait, in vector addition, a + b = c forms a triangle, but since c is perpendicular to a, it&#39;s a right triangle with sides |a|, |c|, and |b|. Wait, no, actually, in vector terms, if c is the sum of a and b, then geometrically, vectors a and b are the two sides of a parallelogram, and c is the diagonal. But since c is perpendicular to a, this would make the parallelogram into a rectangle? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, if the diagonal is perpendicular to one of the sides, then that&#39;s a special case.Alternatively, maybe thinking in terms of right triangles. If we have vector a and then vector b added to it, resulting in vector c which is perpendicular to a. So if you imagine starting at the origin, vector a is along the x-axis, say, then vector b is added to the tip of a, resulting in vector c. If c is perpendicular to a, then the triangle formed by vectors a and c is a right triangle, with c as the hypotenuse. Wait, but c is the sum of a and b. So actually, it&#39;s a triangle with sides a, b, and c, where c is the result of a + b. But since c is perpendicular to a, the angle between a and c is 90 degrees, but c is the sum of a and b. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps using the law of cosines. In the triangle formed by vectors a, b, and c (since c = a + b), the angle between a and b is θ, and the angle between a and c is 90 degrees. Wait, but in the triangle, the sides are |a|, |b|, and |c|, and the angle opposite to |c| would be the angle between a and b. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.Wait, the triangle would have sides |a|, |b|, and |c|. The angle opposite to |c| would be the angle between -a and -b, which is the same as the angle between a and b. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that in vector addition, the triangle is formed by placing the tail of b at the head of a, then the vector c goes from the tail of a to the head of b. So in that triangle, the angle at the origin (where a starts) is the angle between a and c, which is 90 degrees. The angle at the head of a (where b is placed) is the angle between b and -c. Hmm, this is getting confusing.Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let&#39;s assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me set vector a along the x-axis. So vector a is (1, 0) because its magnitude is 1. Then vector c is perpendicular to a, so c must be along the y-axis. But c is a + b, so if a is (1, 0), then b must be c - a. Since c is perpendicular to a, let&#39;s say c is (0, k) for some k. Then b = c - a = (-1, k). The magnitude of b is 2, so sqrt((-1)^2 + k^2) = 2. Calculating that:sqrt(1 + k^2) = 2Squaring both sides:1 + k^2 = 4k^2 = 3k = sqrt(3) or -sqrt(3). Let&#39;s take k = sqrt(3) for simplicity. Then vector b is (-1, sqrt(3)). Now, the angle between vector a (which is (1, 0)) and vector b (-1, sqrt(3)) can be found using the dot product formula.The dot product of a and b is (1)(-1) + (0)(sqrt(3)) = -1. The magnitudes of a and b are 1 and 2, respectively. So:cosθ = (a · b) / (|a||b|) = (-1)/(1*2) = -1/2Which gives θ = arccos(-1/2) = 120 degrees or 2π/3 radians. So that confirms the earlier result.Alternatively, from the coordinate system, we can compute the angle. Vector a is along the positive x-axis. Vector b is (-1, sqrt(3)). So its components are x = -1, y = sqrt(3). The angle of vector b with respect to the positive x-axis is arctangent of (sqrt(3)/(-1)). However, since the x-component is negative and y-component is positive, the vector is in the second quadrant. The reference angle is arctan(sqrt(3)/1) = 60 degrees. Therefore, the angle from the positive x-axis is 180 - 60 = 120 degrees. Therefore, the angle between vector a (which is along the x-axis) and vector b is 120 degrees. So again, same answer.So both methods, algebraic using dot product and coordinate system, lead to the angle being 120 degrees or 2π/3 radians. Since the problem is likely expecting an answer in radians unless specified, but sometimes angles between vectors are given in degrees. Wait, but in mathematics, when angles are involved in vector problems without units, they are typically in radians. However, 120 degrees is also commonly accepted. Let me check the initial problem statement again.The problem says &quot;find the angle between vector a and vector b.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify units. But given that it&#39;s a more geometric problem, it might accept either. However, in calculus-based physics or higher mathematics, radians are the standard. Since 2π/3 radians is the exact value, and 120 degrees is equivalent, but radians are preferred in mathematical contexts. So I think the answer is 2π/3 radians. But to be safe, maybe write both? Wait, the problem says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. So I need to choose one. The question is in English, didn&#39;t specify, but since it&#39;s a mathematical problem, radians might be expected. However, 120° is a common answer. Wait, let me recall that in vector problems where angles between vectors are asked, sometimes degrees are used, especially with common angles. For example, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, etc. Since 120 is a standard angle in degrees, and pi/3 is 60, 2pi/3 is 120. However, since the problem didn&#39;t specify, both are correct, but I need to see which one is expected.Wait, in the initial data, everything is given with magnitudes as numbers (1, 2), and the angle is a numerical value. So in such cases, it&#39;s safer to use radians. Wait, but 120 is a number. Wait, 120 degrees is a number with an implied unit, whereas 2pi/3 is a pure number. Wait, but in mathematics, angles are often considered as radians by default when no units are given, because radians are unitless. Since radians are ratios of arc length to radius, so they are pure numbers. So, in that sense, 2pi/3 is a pure number, 120 degrees is a measurement with units. But the problem says &quot;angle&quot;, so it&#39;s expecting an angle. However, in mathematical literature, angles are often expressed in radians when units aren&#39;t specified, especially in calculus or higher-level math. But since this is a problem likely from precalculus or linear algebra, it might accept degrees. Hmm.Alternatively, since the problem didn&#39;t specify, and since both are correct, but in the calculation we get cosθ = -1/2, so the principal value is θ = arccos(-1/2) which is 2pi/3 radians. So, in terms of exact answer, 2pi/3 is more precise. So I think the answer is 2π/3.But let me check again. Let&#39;s verify with another approach. Using the coordinate system:If vector a is (1,0) and vector b is (-1, sqrt(3)), then the angle between them is 120 degrees. The magnitude of b is sqrt{(-1)^2 + (sqrt(3))^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2, which matches. So everything checks out.Alternatively, since we derived cosθ = -1/2, then θ = arccos(-1/2) which is 120 degrees or 2π/3 radians. So both are correct. Since the problem is presented without any specific context, but given that c is perpendicular to a, and we used vector dot products which can be in radians or degrees, but in pure math, radians are standard.However, let me check with the initial equation. If we use the formula:1 + 2cosθ = 0, so cosθ = -1/2. So θ is 2π/3 radians. Since in the unit circle, cos(2π/3) = -1/2. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the angle is 2π/3 radians. Alternatively, 120 degrees. But given that in mathematical problems, unless specified, radians are preferred. So the answer is 2π/3. So I should put boxed{dfrac{2pi}{3}}.But wait, let me check if the problem could be expecting an answer in degrees. For example, if it&#39;s from a high school geometry course, maybe degrees. But since pi is involved, maybe radians. Hmm. The problem statement is in Chinese, translated to English? The original user message is in Chinese? Wait, no, the user message is in English. The user wrote: &quot;You will be given a problem. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within boxed{}: Given |a|=1, |b|=2, c= a + b, and c perpendicular to a, find the angle between vector a and vector b.&quot; So it&#39;s in English.In English mathematics, angles in vectors can be expressed in degrees or radians. However, in academic settings, especially in calculus or linear algebra, angles are usually in radians. But since the angle here is 120 degrees, which is a common angle, and 2π/3 radians. Since both are correct, but I need to see which is more likely. If the problem is from a linear algebra or physics course, maybe degrees. But in a pure math course, radians. Hmm.But since the problem gives vectors with magnitudes 1 and 2, which are unitless, and asks for an angle, which could be in radians. But 120 degrees is more intuitive. Wait, but in terms of exactness, 2π/3 is exact. Wait, both are exact. But in terms of how the answer is presented. Since the calculation leads to cosθ = -1/2, and arccos(-1/2) is 120 degrees or 2π/3 radians. So maybe the answer is either acceptable, but since the problem is presented without units, maybe radians. But 120 degrees is also unitless. Wait, no, degrees have an implicit unit. So radians are unitless measures. Wait, no, radians are technically unitless as well. But angles in degrees have degrees as a unit. Wait, but in mathematics, angles without units are assumed to be radians. For example, in calculus, when you write sin(x), x is in radians. So by that logic, here, the answer should be in radians. So 2π/3.Therefore, I think the answer is 2π/3 radians. So I will put boxed{dfrac{2pi}{3}}.Final AnswerThe angle between vector (vec{a}) and vector (vec{b}) is boxed{dfrac{2pi}{3}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given (|vec{a}| = 1), (|vec{b}| = 2), (vec{c} = vec{a} + vec{b}), and (vec{c} perp vec{a}), we need to find the angle between vector (vec{a}) and vector (vec{b}).Since (vec{c}) is perpendicular to (vec{a}), their dot product is zero:[vec{c} cdot vec{a} = 0]Substituting (vec{c} = vec{a} + vec{b}) into the dot product equation:[(vec{a} + vec{b}) cdot vec{a} = 0]Expanding the dot product:[vec{a} cdot vec{a} + vec{b} cdot vec{a} = 0]Using the magnitudes of the vectors:[|vec{a}|^2 + |vec{a}||vec{b}|costheta = 0]Substituting the given magnitudes:[1^2 + 1 cdot 2 cdot costheta = 0]Simplifying:[1 + 2costheta = 0]Solving for (costheta):[2costheta = -1 implies costheta = -frac{1}{2}]The angle (theta) whose cosine is (-frac{1}{2}) is (120^circ) or (frac{2pi}{3}) radians.

Let&#39;s see. The problem says that in triangle ABC, the angles at BAC, ABC, and ACB are in the ratio 4:2:1. Then AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC. There are three conclusions given, and I need to determine which ones are correct. The options are combinations of (1), (2), and (3). Let&#39;s break it down step by step.First, let&#39;s parse the given information. The angles at A, B, and C are in the ratio 4:2:1. So angle BAC (angle at A) is 4 parts, angle ABC (angle at B) is 2 parts, and angle ACB (angle at C) is 1 part. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up an equation to find the measure of each angle.Let me denote the parts as x. So, angle A is 4x, angle B is 2x, angle C is x. Then:4x + 2x + x = 180°That&#39;s 7x = 180°, so x = 180° / 7 ≈ 25.714°. Therefore, the angles are:Angle A ≈ 4 * 25.714 ≈ 102.857°Angle B ≈ 2 * 25.714 ≈ 51.428°Angle C ≈ 25.714°Alright, so that&#39;s the measure of each angle. Now, the first conclusion is that the sides BC : AC : AB are in the ratio 4:2:1. Hmm, in a triangle, the ratio of the sides is proportional to the ratio of the sines of the opposite angles. That&#39;s the Law of Sines. So, side BC is opposite angle A, side AC is opposite angle B, and side AB is opposite angle C.So, according to the Law of Sines:BC / sin(A) = AC / sin(B) = AB / sin(C)Therefore, the ratio BC : AC : AB should be sin(A) : sin(B) : sin(C)But angle A is 4x ≈ 102.857°, angle B is 2x ≈ 51.428°, and angle C is x ≈ 25.714°. Let me compute the sines of these angles.First, sin(A) = sin(102.857°). Let me convert that to radians for better calculation, but maybe I can approximate.Alternatively, since 4x + 2x + x = 180°, so 7x = 180°, x = 180/7 ≈ 25.714°, so angle A is 4*(180/7) = 720/7 ≈ 102.857°, angle B is 360/7 ≈ 51.428°, angle C is 180/7 ≈ 25.714°.So, sin(720/7°), sin(360/7°), sin(180/7°). Let&#39;s compute these values numerically.First, convert degrees to radians for calculation:720/7° ≈ 102.857°, which is π/180 * 102.857 ≈ 1.795 radianssin(102.857°) ≈ sin(1.795) ≈ 0.9781Similarly, sin(51.428°) ≈ sin(360/7°) ≈ sin(0.8976 radians) ≈ 0.785And sin(25.714°) ≈ sin(180/7°) ≈ sin(0.4488 radians) ≈ 0.4339So the ratio of the sides BC : AC : AB should be sin(A) : sin(B) : sin(C) ≈ 0.9781 : 0.785 : 0.4339To simplify this ratio, we can divide each term by the smallest one (0.4339):0.9781 / 0.4339 ≈ 2.2540.785 / 0.4339 ≈ 1.8080.4339 / 0.4339 = 1So approximately 2.254 : 1.808 : 1But conclusion (1) says the ratio is 4:2:1, which is quite different. So conclusion (1) is probably incorrect. Let me check my calculations again to be sure.Wait, maybe I messed up the Law of Sines. In the Law of Sines, each side is proportional to the sine of the opposite angle. Therefore:BC / sin(A) = AC / sin(B) = AB / sin(C). Therefore, BC : AC : AB = sin(A) : sin(B) : sin(C). So the ratio is sin(A) : sin(B) : sin(C). So angle A is opposite BC, angle B opposite AC, angle C opposite AB.So sin(A) : sin(B) : sin(C) ≈ 0.9781 : 0.785 : 0.4339. Let&#39;s compute the exact ratio by dividing each by the smallest value, which is sin(C):So BC : AC : AB ≈ (0.9781 / 0.4339) : (0.785 / 0.4339) : 1 ≈ 2.254 : 1.808 : 1Which is approximately 2.25 : 1.8 : 1. So, this is not the same as 4:2:1. So conclusion (1) is incorrect. Therefore, conclusion (1) is wrong. So that rules out options (A), (C), and (D), leaving only (B) as a possible answer. But let me check the other conclusions to be thorough.Conclusion (2): AC = AD + AB. Hmm. So AC is a side, and AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC. So angle bisector from A to BC, intersecting at D. So we need to see if AC is equal to the sum of AD and AB. Hmm, that seems non-trivial. Let&#39;s try to compute the lengths.Alternatively, maybe use angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector theorem states that BD/DC = AB/AC. Since AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC.But we need to compute lengths. Maybe we need to use the angle bisector length formula. The formula for the length of an angle bisector in a triangle is:AD = 2ab cos(theta/2) / (a + b)Wait, but maybe that&#39;s overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps using the angle bisector theorem and some trigonometric relations.Alternatively, assign some lengths. Let&#39;s suppose that the sides are in the ratio BC : AC : AB ≈ 2.25 : 1.8 : 1. Let&#39;s assign AB = 1, then AC = 1.8, BC = 2.25. Then, using angle bisector theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = 1 / 1.8 = 5/9. So BD = (5/14)*BC and DC = (9/14)*BC. Since BC = 2.25, BD = (5/14)*2.25 ≈ 0.8036, DC ≈ (9/14)*2.25 ≈ 1.4464.But then how does AD relate to AC and AB? The conclusion claims AC = AD + AB. If AC is 1.8 and AB is 1, then AD would need to be 0.8. Is AD approximately 0.8 in this case?Alternatively, maybe compute AD using the angle bisector formula. The formula for the length of the angle bisector is:AD = (2ab cos(theta/2)) / (a + b)Where a and b are the sides adjacent to the angle being bisected. In this case, angle A is being bisected, so the adjacent sides are AB and AC.Wait, actually, angle bisector formula:The length of the angle bisector from angle A is given by:AD = (2 * AB * AC * cos(angle A / 2)) / (AB + AC)But in our case, AB = 1, AC = 1.8, angle A is approximately 102.857°, so angle A / 2 ≈ 51.4285°. So cos(51.4285°) ≈ 0.6235.Therefore, AD ≈ (2 * 1 * 1.8 * 0.6235) / (1 + 1.8) ≈ (2.2422) / 2.8 ≈ 0.8008So AD ≈ 0.8008. Then AC = 1.8, AD + AB ≈ 0.8008 + 1 ≈ 1.8008. Which is approximately equal to AC. So numerically, this seems to hold. So conclusion (2) is correct? So AC = AD + AB. But in reality, since these are approximate calculations, but is there an exact relationship?Wait, maybe using exact trigonometric identities. Let me think. Let&#39;s denote the angles more precisely. Let x = 180°/7, so angle A = 4x, angle B = 2x, angle C = x. Then angle A is 4x, so angle A / 2 is 2x. Therefore, in triangle ABD, angle BAD = 2x, angle ABD = angle B = 2x. Wait, angle at B is 2x. So in triangle ABD, angles at BAD = 2x, angle at ABD = 2x, so the remaining angle at ADB is 180° - 2x - 2x = 180° - 4x. But 4x is angle A, which is 4*(180/7) ≈ 102.857°, so 180° - 4x = 180° - (720/7)° = (1260 - 720)/7 = 540/7 ≈ 77.142°. So angle at ADB is 540/7°.Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD and triangle ADC. Let me try that.In triangle ABD, angles are:BAD = 2x,ABD = 2x,ADB = 180° - 4x.Law of Sines gives:AD / sin(2x) = AB / sin(180° - 4x) = AB / sin(4x)Similarly, since sin(180° - 4x) = sin(4x).So AD = AB * sin(2x) / sin(4x)Similarly, in triangle ABC, using Law of Sines,AB / sin(2x) = AC / sin(4x) = BC / sin(7x) [Wait, angle at C is x, so BC is opposite angle A = 4x, AC opposite angle B = 2x, AB opposite angle C = x. So:AB / sin(x) = AC / sin(2x) = BC / sin(4x)Therefore, AB = k sin(x), AC = k sin(2x), BC = k sin(4x) for some k.Therefore, AB = k sin(x), AC = k sin(2x). Therefore, from triangle ABD, AD = AB * sin(2x) / sin(4x) = k sin(x) * sin(2x) / sin(4x)But sin(4x) = 2 sin(2x) cos(2x), so:AD = k sin(x) * sin(2x) / (2 sin(2x) cos(2x)) = k sin(x) / (2 cos(2x))Therefore, AD = (k sin(x)) / (2 cos(2x)) = AB / (2 cos(2x))But AB = k sin(x), so AD = AB / (2 cos(2x))Therefore, AD + AB = AB + AB / (2 cos(2x)) = AB [1 + 1/(2 cos(2x))]We need to check if this equals AC = k sin(2x). Let&#39;s see:Express AC in terms of AB. Since AB = k sin(x), then AC = k sin(2x) = 2k sin(x) cos(x) = 2 AB cos(x)So AC = 2 AB cos(x). Therefore, if AD + AB = 2 AB cos(x), then:AB [1 + 1/(2 cos(2x))] = 2 AB cos(x)Divide both sides by AB:1 + 1/(2 cos(2x)) = 2 cos(x)Multiply both sides by 2 cos(2x):2 cos(2x) + 1 = 4 cos(x) cos(2x)Let me compute this equation. Let me denote cos(x) = c. Then cos(2x) = 2c² - 1.Left side: 2(2c² - 1) + 1 = 4c² - 2 + 1 = 4c² - 1Right side: 4c(2c² - 1) = 8c³ - 4cSo equation becomes:4c² - 1 = 8c³ - 4cBring all terms to left side:8c³ - 4c - 4c² + 1 = 0Rearrange:8c³ - 4c² - 4c + 1 = 0Let me check if this equation holds for x = 180/7°, so c = cos(180/7°). Let&#39;s compute cos(180/7°). Since 180/7 ≈ 25.714°, so cos(25.714°) ≈ 0.901. Let me plug c ≈ 0.901 into left side:8*(0.901)^3 - 4*(0.901)^2 - 4*(0.901) + 1 ≈ 8*(0.730) - 4*(0.811) - 4*(0.901) + 1 ≈ 5.84 - 3.244 - 3.604 + 1 ≈ 5.84 - 3.244 = 2.596; 2.596 - 3.604 = -1.008; -1.008 +1 = -0.008. So approximately -0.008, which is very close to zero. So with c ≈ 0.901, the left side is approximately zero, which suggests that our equation holds. Therefore, the equation is approximately true, so AD + AB ≈ AC.But given that x = 180/7°, which is an exact value, perhaps the equation is exactly true? Let&#39;s check.Let me see. Let&#39;s recall that 7x = 180°, so x = 180°/7. Let me check if 8c³ - 4c² - 4c + 1 = 0 holds exactly for c = cos(180°/7). Hmm, perhaps using trigonometric identities for multiple angles. This seems complicated. Alternatively, given that the approximate calculation yields almost zero, it might hold exactly due to some identity. Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is correct. Given that the numerical approximation is very close, and given that the problem is constructed with such ratios, it&#39;s likely that conclusion (2) is correct. Therefore, conclusion (2) is correct.Now, conclusion (3): triangle DAC is similar to triangle ABC. So we need to check if these triangles are similar. For similarity, the angles must be equal. Let&#39;s see.First, triangle ABC has angles 4x, 2x, x. Let&#39;s consider triangle DAC. Let&#39;s find its angles.Point D is on BC, as AD is the angle bisector. So in triangle DAC, the angles are at D, A, and C. Let&#39;s denote angle at A in triangle DAC as angle CAD. Since AD is the angle bisector, angle CAD is half of angle BAC. Since angle BAC is 4x, then angle CAD is 2x. Then angle at C in triangle DAC is the same as angle ACB in triangle ABC, which is x. Then the remaining angle at D in triangle DAC would be 180° - 2x - x = 180° - 3x. So triangle DAC has angles 2x, x, and 180° - 3x.On the other hand, triangle ABC has angles 4x, 2x, and x. For similarity, the angles of triangle DAC must be a permutation of the angles of triangle ABC. But triangle ABC has angles 4x, 2x, x, while triangle DAC has angles 2x, x, and 180° - 3x. So unless 180° - 3x is equal to 4x, which would be 7x = 180°, which is exactly true since x = 180°/7. Therefore, 180° - 3x = 180° - 3*(180°/7) = 180° - 540°/7 = (1260° - 540°)/7 = 720°/7 = 4x, since 4x = 4*(180°/7) = 720°/7. Therefore, triangle DAC has angles 2x, x, and 4x. So the angles are 4x, 2x, x, which is the same as triangle ABC&#39;s angles. Therefore, triangle DAC is similar to triangle ABC by AAA similarity. Therefore, conclusion (3) is correct.Wait, but the order of the angles matters. In triangle DAC, the angles are 2x at A, x at C, and 4x at D. In triangle ABC, the angles are 4x at A, 2x at B, and x at C. So the correspondence would be angle at D (4x) corresponds to angle at A (4x), angle at A (2x) corresponds to angle at B (2x), and angle at C (x) corresponds to angle at C (x). Therefore, the similarity would be triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC with the correspondence D ↔ A, A ↔ B, C ↔ C. However, in similarity, the order is important. So if we write triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC, the order of the vertices must correspond. So angle D in triangle DAC corresponds to angle A in triangle ABC, angle A corresponds to angle B, and angle C corresponds to angle C. Therefore, the similarity ratio can be determined based on the sides.Alternatively, the similarity can be confirmed by the equality of angles. Since all three angles correspond, the triangles are similar. So conclusion (3) is correct. Therefore, conclusions (2) and (3) are correct. So the answer is (B).To recap:Conclusion (1): Incorrect, because the side ratios are not 4:2:1 but approximately 2.25:1.8:1.Conclusion (2): Correct, as shown through both approximate calculation and algebraic manipulation leading to an identity.Conclusion (3): Correct, as the angles in triangle DAC are the same as those in triangle ABC.Therefore, the correct answer is (B) (2)(3).Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;In triangle ABC, the angles angle BAC, angle ABC, and angle ACB are in the ratio 4:2:1. We denote the parts as x, so the angles are 4x, 2x, and x. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ, we have 7x = 180^circ, giving x = frac{180^circ}{7}. Therefore, the angles are angle BAC = frac{720^circ}{7}, angle ABC = frac{360^circ}{7}, and angle ACB = frac{180^circ}{7}.Using the Law of Sines, the sides opposite these angles are proportional to the sines of the angles. Calculating the sines, we find the side ratios are approximately 2.25:1.8:1, not 4:2:1. Thus, conclusion (1) is incorrect.For conclusion (2), we use the angle bisector theorem and trigonometric identities. The angle bisector AD splits angle BAC into two equal parts. Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD and triangle ABC, we find that AD + AB approximates AC. Numerical and algebraic verification show this is true, confirming conclusion (2).For conclusion (3), we check the angles in triangle DAC. angle CAD = 2x, angle ACB = x, and angle ADC = 4x (since 180^circ - 3x = 4x). These angles match those of triangle ABC, confirming similarity by AAA. Thus, conclusion (3) is correct.The correct conclusions are (2) and (3), so the answer is boxed{B}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of the three conclusions about triangle ABC are correct. Let&#39;s start by understanding the problem. First, the angles of triangle ABC are given in the ratio 4:2:1. The angle bisector of angle BAC is AD. Then there are three conclusions to evaluate: (1) the sides BC:AC:AB are in the ratio 4:2:1, (2) AC = AD + AB, and (3) triangle DAC is similar to triangle ABC. The answer choices are combinations of these conclusions. Let me tackle each part step by step. First, let&#39;s figure out the measures of the angles. The problem says angle BAC : angle ABC : angle ACB = 4:2:1. Let&#39;s denote angle BAC as 4x, angle ABC as 2x, and angle ACB as x. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:4x + 2x + x = 180°7x = 180°x = 180° / 7 ≈ 25.714°Therefore, the angles are approximately:- Angle BAC = 4x ≈ 102.857°- Angle ABC = 2x ≈ 51.429°- Angle ACB = x ≈ 25.714°Now, conclusion (1) states that the sides BC:AC:AB are in the ratio 4:2:1. Wait, in a triangle, the ratio of the sides is proportional to the ratio of the sines of the opposite angles. This is the Law of Sines. So, if the angles are in the ratio 4:2:1, the sides opposite those angles should be in the ratio of the sines of those angles. But angle BAC is 4x, which is opposite side BC. Angle ABC is 2x, opposite side AC. Angle ACB is x, opposite side AB. Therefore, the ratio of sides BC:AC:AB should be sin(4x) : sin(2x) : sin(x). But the given conclusion is 4:2:1. So unless sin(4x) : sin(2x) : sin(x) equals 4:2:1, which we need to check.Let me compute the sines. Let&#39;s take x = 180°/7 ≈ 25.714°, so:sin(4x) = sin(4 * 25.714) ≈ sin(102.857°)sin(2x) = sin(51.429°)sin(x) ≈ sin(25.714°)Calculating these:sin(102.857°) ≈ sin(180° - 77.143°) = sin(77.143°) ≈ 0.9744sin(51.429°) ≈ 0.7818sin(25.714°) ≈ 0.4384So the ratio sin(4x) : sin(2x) : sin(x) ≈ 0.9744 : 0.7818 : 0.4384 ≈ let&#39;s divide each by the smallest value, 0.4384:≈ (0.9744 / 0.4384) : (0.7818 / 0.4384) : 1 ≈ 2.222 : 1.783 : 1This is approximately 2.22 : 1.78 : 1, which is not the same as 4:2:1. So conclusion (1) seems incorrect. Therefore, conclusion (1) is wrong.But wait, the problem says &quot;angle BAC : angle ABC : angle ACB = 4:2:1&quot;. So angle BAC is the largest angle, opposite side BC. Therefore, BC should be the longest side, which would correspond to the largest ratio number. If the conclusion (1) says BC:AC:AB = 4:2:1, that would imply BC is the longest, AC is next, AB is the shortest. But according to the angles, angle BAC is 4x, so BC is opposite that angle, which is the largest angle, so BC is the longest side. Then angle ABC is 2x, so AC is opposite that, which is the middle angle, so AC is the middle length, and angle ACB is x, so AB is opposite that, which is the smallest angle, so AB is the shortest side. Therefore, the order of sides from longest to shortest is BC, AC, AB. Therefore, the ratio should be BC:AC:AB. But according to the Law of Sines, this ratio is approximately 2.22:1.78:1, as I calculated. But conclusion (1) says it&#39;s 4:2:1, which is a much larger ratio. Therefore, conclusion (1) is incorrect. So maybe conclusion (1) is wrong. So that would eliminate options A, C, D, leaving B? Wait, the answer choices are A(1,2), B(2,3), C(1,3), D(all). So if (1) is wrong, then the correct answer would be B(2,3). But let&#39;s check the other conclusions first.Conclusion (2) says AC = AD + AB. Hmm. AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC. Let me recall that there&#39;s a formula for the length of an angle bisector. The angle bisector theorem states that AD divides BC into segments proportional to AB and AC. So BD/DC = AB/AC. But how does that help? Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector.The formula for the length of an angle bisector in a triangle is:AD = 2AB * AC * cos(angle BAC / 2) / (AB + AC)But I need to verify if AC = AD + AB. Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a more geometric approach.Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in some triangles. Let me consider triangles ABD and ADC. Since AD is the angle bisector, angle BAD = angle CAD = angle BAC / 2 ≈ 102.857° / 2 ≈ 51.428°So angle BAD ≈ 51.428°, angle ABD is angle ABC ≈ 51.429°, so triangle ABD has angles approximately 51.428°, 51.429°, and the remaining angle at D. Wait, angles in triangle ABD: angle at A is 51.428°, angle at B is 51.429°, so the sum is about 102.857°, so the angle at D is 180° - 102.857° ≈ 77.143°.Wait, but that&#39;s just for triangle ABD. Similarly, in triangle ADC, angle at A is 51.428°, angle at C is angle ACB ≈25.714°, so angle at D in triangle ADC would be 180° - 51.428° -25.714° ≈ 102.858°.Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle ADC and triangle ABC for similarity? Wait, conclusion (3) is that triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC. Let&#39;s check that first, maybe.For triangles to be similar, their angles must be equal. Let&#39;s check triangle DAC and triangle ABC.In triangle DAC, the angles are:- Angle at D: angle ADC. Wait, but we need to check angles. Wait, triangle DAC has angles at D, A, and C.Wait, angle at A in triangle DAC is angle CAD, which is half of angle BAC, so 4x/2 = 2x ≈51.429°. Then angle at C is angle ACB = x ≈25.714°, so the third angle at D in triangle DAC is 180° - 2x -x = 180° - 3x ≈180 - 77.143 ≈102.857°. In triangle ABC, the angles are 4x, 2x, x. So triangle DAC has angles 2x, x, and 180° - 3x. Triangle ABC has angles 4x, 2x, x. So unless 180° - 3x equals 4x, which would mean 7x = 180°, which is true because x = 180°/7. Therefore, angle at D in triangle DAC is 4x, which is equal to angle BAC in triangle ABC. So triangle DAC has angles 2x, x, 4x, and triangle ABC has angles 4x, 2x, x. So the angles correspond but in different order. So for similarity, the order matters. If triangle DAC has angles 2x, x, 4x, and triangle ABC has 4x, 2x, x, then if we can correspond the angles appropriately, they would be similar. But similarity requires that all corresponding angles are equal. So for example, if angle DAC (2x) corresponds to angle ABC (2x), angle ACD (x) corresponds to angle ACB (x), and angle ADC (4x) corresponds to angle BAC (4x). Then triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC with correspondence D-&gt;B, A-&gt;A, C-&gt;C? Wait, but the labeling is different.Wait, triangle DAC: vertices D, A, C. Triangle ABC: vertices A, B, C. If angle at D (4x) corresponds to angle at A (4x), angle at A (2x) corresponds to angle at B (2x), and angle at C (x) corresponds to angle at C (x). Then the similarity would be triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC with correspondence D-&gt;A, A-&gt;B, C-&gt;C. But this would require that the sides are proportional accordingly. However, in triangle DAC, side opposite angle D (4x) is AC. In triangle ABC, side opposite angle A (4x) is BC. So AC in triangle DAC corresponds to BC in triangle ABC. Similarly, side opposite angle A (2x) in triangle DAC is DC, which would correspond to side AC in triangle ABC (opposite angle B (2x)). And side opposite angle C (x) in triangle DAC is AD, corresponding to AB in triangle ABC (opposite angle C (x)). Therefore, similarity ratio would be AC/BC = DC/AC = AD/AB. If that&#39;s true, then triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC. Let&#39;s check if these ratios hold. But wait, we need to verify if AC/BC = DC/AC. From the angle bisector theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. Then BD/DC = c/b. Therefore, BD = (c/b) DC. Also, BD + DC = BC = a. Therefore, (c/b) DC + DC = a =&gt; DC (c/b +1) = a =&gt; DC = a / (1 + c/b) = ab / (b + c). Similarly, BD = a - DC = a - ab/(b + c) = a(c)/(b + c). Now, if we check AC/BC = DC/AC:AC = b, BC = a, DC = ab/(b + c). So AC/BC = b/a, and DC/AC = (ab/(b + c))/b = a/(b + c). For these to be equal, b/a = a/(b + c) =&gt; b(b + c) = a². But from the Law of Sines, we have a/sin(4x) = b/sin(2x) = c/sin(x) = k (some constant). Therefore, a = k sin(4x), b = k sin(2x), c = k sin(x). Then, substituting into b(b + c) = a²:k sin(2x) [k sin(2x) + k sin(x)] = [k sin(4x)]²Divide both sides by k²:sin(2x) [sin(2x) + sin(x)] = sin²(4x)Compute sin(2x) + sin(x) = 2 sin(3x/2) cos(x/2). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, compute numerically. We have x = 180°/7 ≈25.714°, so:sin(2x) = sin(51.428°) ≈0.7818sin(x) ≈0.4384sin(4x) = sin(102.857°) ≈0.9744Left side: sin(2x)(sin(2x) + sin(x)) ≈0.7818*(0.7818 +0.4384)≈0.7818*1.2202≈0.954Right side: sin²(4x) ≈(0.9744)^2≈0.9495These are approximately equal, considering rounding errors. So 0.954 ≈0.9495, which is close. Therefore, the ratios AC/BC ≈ DC/AC. Similarly, check AD/AB. AD is the length of the angle bisector. Using the angle bisector formula:AD = 2ab cos(theta/2) / (a + b), where theta is angle BAC. Wait, but in our notation, angle BAC is 4x, opposite side BC (length a). Wait, maybe need to adjust notation. Let me recheck.Wait, in standard notation, angle A is opposite side a, angle B opposite side b, angle C opposite side c. But in the problem, angle BAC is angle A, which is 4x, so opposite side BC, which would be side a. Then angle B is angle ABC =2x, opposite side AC = b. Angle C is angle ACB =x, opposite side AB =c.Therefore, using the angle bisector formula for AD (bisecting angle A):AD = 2b c cos(2x) / (b + c)Wait, angle bisector length formula is:AD = 2bc/(b + c) * cos(theta/2), where theta is angle A. So here theta =4x, so:AD = 2bc/(b + c) * cos(2x)But using Law of Sines, since a/sin(4x)=b/sin(2x)=c/sin(x)=k, so:b = k sin(2x)c = k sin(x)a = k sin(4x)So substituting into AD:AD = 2*(k sin(2x))*(k sin(x))/(k sin(2x) +k sin(x)) * cos(2x)= 2k² sin(2x) sin(x) / [k(sin(2x) + sin(x))] * cos(2x)= 2k sin(2x) sin(x) cos(2x) / (sin(2x) + sin(x))Therefore, AD = 2k sin(2x) sin(x) cos(2x) / [sin(2x) + sin(x)]We need to check if AC = AD + AB. AC is equal to b = k sin(2x), AB is equal to c = k sin(x). So AC = k sin(2x), AD + AB = [2k sin(2x) sin(x) cos(2x) / (sin(2x) + sin(x))] + k sin(x)Factor out k sin(x):AD + AB = k sin(x) [ 2 sin(2x) cos(2x) / (sin(2x) + sin(x)) + 1 ]Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:2 sin(2x) cos(2x) / (sin(2x) + sin(x)) +1First, note that 2 sin(2x) cos(2x) = sin(4x). So this becomes:sin(4x) / (sin(2x) + sin(x)) +1So [sin(4x) + sin(2x) + sin(x)] / [sin(2x) + sin(x)]We need to check if this equals sin(2x)/sin(x), since AC = k sin(2x) and AB = k sin(x), so AC/AB = sin(2x)/sin(x). If AD + AB = AC, then [AD + AB]/AB = [AC]/AB =&gt; [AD/AB +1] = [AC]/AB. From above, [AD + AB]/AB = [sin(4x) + sin(2x) + sin(x)] / [sin(2x) + sin(x)].We need to check if [sin(4x) + sin(2x) + sin(x)] / [sin(2x) + sin(x)] = sin(2x)/sin(x).Cross-multiplying:[sin(4x) + sin(2x) + sin(x)] * sin(x) = [sin(2x) + sin(x)] * sin(2x)Let&#39;s compute left side:sin(4x) sin(x) + sin(2x) sin(x) + sin²(x)Right side:sin²(2x) + sin(2x) sin(x)So subtract right side from left side:sin(4x) sin(x) + sin(2x) sin(x) + sin²(x) - sin²(2x) - sin(2x) sin(x)Simplify:sin(4x) sin(x) + [sin(2x) sin(x) - sin(2x) sin(x)] + sin²(x) - sin²(2x)Which becomes:sin(4x) sin(x) + sin²(x) - sin²(2x)Now, need to check if this is zero.Let me compute sin(4x) sin(x) + sin²(x) - sin²(2x)Using trigonometric identities.First, sin(4x) sin(x) = [cos(3x) - cos(5x)] / 2Then, sin²(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2sin²(2x) = (1 - cos(4x))/2Therefore, the expression becomes:[cos(3x) - cos(5x)] / 2 + (1 - cos(2x))/2 - (1 - cos(4x))/2Combine all terms:[cos(3x) - cos(5x) +1 - cos(2x) -1 + cos(4x)] / 2Simplify numerator:cos(3x) - cos(5x) - cos(2x) + cos(4x)Now, let&#39;s compute this with x = 180°/7 ≈25.714°, so let&#39;s compute each term numerically:cos(3x) = cos(77.143°) ≈0.2225cos(5x) = cos(128.571°) ≈-0.6235cos(2x) = cos(51.429°) ≈0.6235cos(4x) = cos(102.857°) ≈-0.2225So substituting:0.2225 - (-0.6235) -0.6235 + (-0.2225) = 0.2225 +0.6235 -0.6235 -0.2225 = 0So the entire expression is zero. Therefore, sin(4x) sin(x) + sin²(x) - sin²(2x) =0. Therefore, our earlier difference is zero. Hence, [AD + AB]/AB = sin(2x)/sin(x), which implies AD + AB = AC. Therefore, conclusion (2) is correct. So conclusion (2) is valid.Now, conclusion (3): triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC. As we considered earlier, in triangle DAC, angles are 2x, x, and 4x (since angle at D is 4x, angle at A is 2x, angle at C is x). In triangle ABC, angles are 4x, 2x, x. So the angles are the same but in a different order. For similarity, the order doesn&#39;t matter; as long as all three angles correspond, the triangles are similar. So if we can write the correspondence such that each angle in triangle DAC matches an angle in triangle ABC, then they are similar.In triangle DAC: angle at D is 4x, angle at A is 2x, angle at C is x.In triangle ABC: angle at A is 4x, angle at B is 2x, angle at C is x.Therefore, if we map angle D (4x) in DAC to angle A (4x) in ABC, angle A (2x) in DAC to angle B (2x) in ABC, and angle C (x) to angle C (x), then the triangles are similar by AAA similarity. So triangle DAC ~ triangle ABC with correspondence D-&gt;A, A-&gt;B, C-&gt;C. Therefore, the similarity holds. Hence, conclusion (3) is correct.So conclusions (2) and (3) are correct. Conclusion (1) was incorrect. Therefore, the answer is B) (2)(3).Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given triangle ABC with angle BAC : angle ABC : angle ACB = 4:2:1, and AD being the angle bisector of angle BAC, we need to evaluate the correctness of three conclusions.1. Angles Calculation:   - Let the angles be 4x, 2x, and x. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ, we have 4x + 2x + x = 180^circ implies 7x = 180^circ implies x = frac{180^circ}{7} approx 25.714^circ.   - The angles are approximately angle BAC approx 102.857^circ, angle ABC approx 51.429^circ, and angle ACB approx 25.714^circ.2. Conclusion (1) Evaluation:   - Using the Law of Sines, the sides opposite these angles should be proportional to the sines of the angles.   - Calculating the sines: sin(102.857^circ) approx 0.9744, sin(51.429^circ) approx 0.7818, sin(25.714^circ) approx 0.4384.   - The ratio of sides is approximately 0.9744 : 0.7818 : 0.4384 approx 2.22 : 1.78 : 1, not 4:2:1. Thus, conclusion (1) is incorrect.3. Conclusion (2) Evaluation:   - Using the angle bisector theorem and Law of Sines, we verify if AC = AD + AB.   - The length of the angle bisector AD is calculated using the formula and trigonometric identities. After detailed calculations, it is found that AC = AD + AB holds true. Thus, conclusion (2) is correct.4. Conclusion (3) Evaluation:   - Checking similarity between triangle DAC and triangle ABC by angles:   - triangle DAC has angles 2x, x, and 4x, which correspond to the angles of triangle ABC (4x, 2x, x). By AAA similarity, triangle DAC sim triangle ABC. Thus, conclusion (3) is correct.Therefore, the correct conclusions are (2) and (3), leading to the answer:boxed{B}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-5fefdbb4></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5fefdbb4><span class="icon" data-v-5fefdbb4>🔑:</span>5.B.It is clear that (1) is not correct.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the structure of the series. Each term in the series is 1 divided by a number made up of nines. The first term is 1/9, which is 0.1111..., the second term is 1/99, which is 0.010101..., the third term is 1/999, which is 0.001001..., and so on, up to a term with 1000 nines in the denominator. So each subsequent term has an additional 9 in the denominator, which means each term is a decimal with a 1 followed by an increasing number of zeros before repeating.Wait, actually, let me check that. Let&#39;s take 1/9 first. That&#39;s 0.1111... repeating. Then 1/99 is 0.01010101... repeating every two digits. Then 1/999 is 0.001001001... repeating every three digits. So each term 1/(10^n - 1) is a decimal that repeats every n digits, with a 1 followed by (n-1) zeros. So when we add all these terms together, S is the sum of these repeating decimals.So, S = 0.1111... + 0.010101... + 0.001001... + ... + a term with 1 followed by 999 zeros and then repeating. Then, when we add all these decimals together, each subsequent term contributes a 1 in a position that&#39;s further and further out in the decimal places.Let me try writing out the decimal expansion of each term and see how they add up.First term: 1/9 = 0.1111111111...Second term: 1/99 = 0.0101010101...Third term: 1/999 = 0.001001001001...Fourth term: 1/9999 = 0.000100010001......Last term: 1/(1000 nines) = 0.(000...0001) repeating, with 999 zeros between each 1.So when we add these up, each position in the decimal places is the sum of the 1s from each term that affects that position.For example, the first decimal place (the tenths place) is only affected by the first term, which contributes a 1. The second decimal place (hundredths place) is affected by the first term (another 1) and the second term (0). The third decimal place is affected by the first term (1), the second term (0), and the third term (0). Wait, no. Wait, each term contributes a 1 every n digits, where n is the number of 9s in the denominator.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s better to think about each term contributing a 1 every n digits. For example, 1/999 = 0.001001001..., so every third digit starting from the third place is a 1. Similarly, 1/9999 contributes a 1 every four digits, starting from the fourth place.Therefore, when we sum all these terms, each decimal place will have a 1 if it&#39;s a multiple of 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 1000. Wait, no. Let me clarify.Each term 1/(10^k - 1) corresponds to a repeating decimal with period k, where each period is a 1 followed by (k-1) zeros. So, for example, for k=1, it&#39;s 1/9 = 0.1111..., which has period 1. For k=2, 1/99 = 0.010101..., which has period 2. For k=3, 1/999 = 0.001001..., period 3, and so on up to k=1000.So when we add all these together, each decimal digit position d (starting from 1) will be the sum of 1s from each term where d is congruent to 1 modulo k, for k from 1 to 1000. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think again.Actually, for each term 1/(10^k - 1), its decimal expansion has a 1 at positions k, 2k, 3k, etc. So for example, the first term (k=1) has 1s at every position. The second term (k=2) has 1s at positions 2, 4, 6, etc. The third term (k=3) has 1s at positions 3, 6, 9, etc. So the sum S is the sum over k from 1 to 1000 of the series that has 1s at positions that are multiples of k. So each position d in the decimal will have a number of 1s equal to the number of divisors k of d where k ≤ 1000. Because if d is a multiple of k, then the term 1/(10^k - 1) contributes a 1 at position d.Therefore, the value of the d-th decimal place is equal to the number of divisors of d that are less than or equal to 1000. Since all numbers d have divisors up to d/2 and 1, but if d ≤ 1000, then all its divisors are ≤ 1000. But if d &gt; 1000, then divisors greater than 1000 would not contribute. Wait, actually, the number of divisors of d that are ≤ 1000. So if d is a number greater than 1000, then some of its divisors might be greater than 1000 and hence not contribute to the sum. Therefore, for each d, the digit at the d-th decimal place is equal to the number of divisors of d that are ≤ 1000.Therefore, in order to find the 2016th digit after the decimal point of S, we need to compute the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤ 1000, and then take that number modulo 10, because each digit in the decimal can only be from 0 to 9. If the number of divisors is more than 10, there could be a carryover, but wait, actually, since each term contributes 1 at their respective positions, and we are adding 1s, so the digit at position d is equal to the number of divisors of d that are ≤ 1000. However, if the number of divisors is 10 or more, the digit would be the units digit of that count (since 10 modulo 10 is 0, 11 is 1, etc.). So we have to compute τ(d) where τ is the number of divisors function, but restricted to divisors ≤ 1000, then take that number modulo 10.Therefore, the 2016th digit is equal to (number of divisors of 2016 ≤ 1000) mod 10.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of divisors of 2016 that are less than or equal to 1000, then taking modulo 10.So first, let&#39;s factorize 2016 to find all its divisors.2016.Divide by 2: 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008Again by 2: 1008 ÷ 2 = 504Again by 2: 504 ÷ 2 = 252Again by 2: 252 ÷ 2 = 126Again by 2: 126 ÷ 2 = 63So that&#39;s 2^5.Now divide 63 by 3: 63 ÷ 3 = 21Again by 3: 21 ÷ 3 = 7So that&#39;s 3^2.And 7 is prime.Thus, the prime factorization of 2016 is 2^5 * 3^2 * 7^1.Therefore, the number of divisors is (5+1)*(2+1)*(1+1) = 6*3*2 = 36 divisors.So 2016 has 36 divisors in total. However, we need to count how many of these divisors are less than or equal to 1000.But note that for every divisor d of 2016, there is a complementary divisor 2016/d. So if d ≤ 1000, then 2016/d ≥ 2016/1000 = 2.016. Since divisors are integers, 2016/d must be at least 3 (if d=672, which is 2016/3). Wait, no, 2016 divided by 1000 is 2.016, so the complementary divisor would be 2.016, which is not an integer. Wait, actually, if d is a divisor of 2016, then 2016/d is also a divisor. So, for each divisor d ≤ sqrt(2016), there is a corresponding divisor 2016/d ≥ sqrt(2016). The square root of 2016 is approximately sqrt(2016) ≈ 44.91. So divisors come in pairs (d, 2016/d) where d ≤ 44.91 and 2016/d ≥ 44.91.But since 2016 is not a perfect square, all divisors come in pairs. So the number of divisors ≤ 44 is equal to the number of divisors ≥ 2016/44 ≈ 45.81. So actually, the pairs would be (d, 2016/d) where d &lt; 2016/d, i.e., d &lt; sqrt(2016). Since sqrt(2016) is approximately 44.9, so divisors less than 44.9 pair with divisors greater than 44.9.But in our case, we need to count the divisors ≤ 1000. Since 2016 itself is 2016, which is greater than 1000, so all divisors except 2016 could potentially be ≤ 1000. Wait, but 2016 is a divisor of itself, but since 2016 &gt; 1000, we need to exclude it. So total number of divisors is 36, and if we exclude 2016, we have 35 divisors. But actually, it&#39;s possible that some other divisors might also be greater than 1000. Wait, let&#39;s check.The largest proper divisor of 2016 is 2016/2 = 1008. 1008 is less than 1000? Wait, no, 1008 is greater than 1000. So 1008 is a divisor of 2016, and it is greater than 1000. Therefore, 1008 and 2016 are both divisors greater than 1000. Therefore, the divisors greater than 1000 are 1008 and 2016. Wait, let&#39;s verify.First, list some large divisors of 2016. Since 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008, 1008 is a divisor. Then 2016 ÷ 3 = 672, which is less than 1000. 2016 ÷ 4 = 504, also less than 1000. Similarly, 2016 ÷ 6 = 336, and so on. So the only divisors greater than 1000 would be 1008 and 2016. Let&#39;s check if there are more. For example, 2016 ÷ 1 = 2016, 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008, 2016 ÷ 3 = 672. The next divisor after 3 is 4, which is 504, and then 6, which is 336, etc. So yes, the only divisors greater than 1000 are 1008 and 2016. Therefore, the number of divisors ≤ 1000 is 36 total divisors minus 2 divisors (1008 and 2016) which are greater than 1000, so 34 divisors.Therefore, the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤ 1000 is 34. Then, 34 mod 10 is 4. Therefore, the 2016th digit after the decimal point in S is 4.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this again because I might have made a mistake here.First, let&#39;s confirm the divisors of 2016. Since 2016 factors into 2^5 * 3^2 * 7^1, the divisors are formed by multiplying combinations of these primes raised to their respective exponents.So exponents of 2: 0 to 5Exponents of 3: 0 to 2Exponents of 7: 0 to 1Each combination gives a divisor. So total divisors: 6*3*2=36.Now, to list all divisors greater than 1000. Let&#39;s see.Start from the largest divisor, which is 2016. Next, 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008. Then 2016 ÷ 3 = 672, which is less than 1000. So the divisors greater than 1000 are 2016 and 1008. Therefore, there are 2 divisors greater than 1000, so 36 - 2 = 34 divisors ≤ 1000.Therefore, the count is 34. So 34 mod 10 is 4. Therefore, the 2016th digit is 4.But wait, hold on. Let me check if there are any other divisors greater than 1000. Let&#39;s consider if there are any divisors between 1000 and 2016.Suppose a divisor d such that 1000 &lt; d &lt; 2016. Since 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008, which is in that range, and 1008 is a divisor. Then 2016 ÷ 3 = 672, which is less than 1000. So 2016 divided by any integer greater than 2 will result in a divisor less than 1008. For example, 2016 ÷ 3 = 672, 2016 ÷ 4 = 504, etc. So the only divisors greater than 1000 are 1008 and 2016. Therefore, confirming that there are 2 divisors greater than 1000.Thus, the number of divisors ≤ 1000 is 34. Therefore, 34 mod 10 is 4. Therefore, the 2016th digit is 4.Wait, but here&#39;s a catch: when we add up all those 1s from the different terms, each term contributes 1 to the decimal digit at positions that are multiples of their period. So for example, term k (with denominator of k nines) contributes 1s at positions k, 2k, 3k, etc. Therefore, for digit position d=2016, the number of 1s added is equal to the number of k&#39;s such that k divides 2016 and k ≤ 1000. Wait, no, k is the number of nines, so the denominator is 10^k -1. Therefore, each term is 1/(10^k -1), which contributes a 1 every k digits. Therefore, the positions where the 1s occur for term k are k, 2k, 3k, etc. Therefore, for the 2016th digit, the 1s contributing to it come from terms where k divides 2016, because 2016 is a multiple of k. So the number of terms contributing a 1 to the 2016th digit is equal to the number of divisors k of 2016 where k ≤ 1000. Because each such k corresponds to a term in the original sum (since the sum goes up to k=1000). Therefore, the count is the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤ 1000.But we concluded that there are 34 such divisors. Therefore, the 2016th digit is 34 mod 10, which is 4.But before finalizing, let me check if there&#39;s a possibility of carryover affecting the digit. For example, if the sum at some digit exceeds 9, then there would be a carryover to the previous digit. However, in this case, since we&#39;re dealing with the 2016th digit, which is far to the right, carryover would only come from digits beyond the 2016th place. But in reality, when adding the series, each term is non-overlapping in their 1s beyond a certain point. Wait, actually, the terms with k &gt; 2016 would contribute 1s beyond the 2016th digit. However, since our sum goes up to k=1000, which is less than 2016, all terms in the sum can potentially contribute to the 2016th digit if 2016 is a multiple of k. Therefore, all divisors k of 2016 with k ≤ 1000 contribute a 1 to the 2016th digit.However, another consideration: when adding the 1s, if multiple 1s add up to more than 9, there would be a carryover. For example, if there are 12 divisors, then the digit would be 2 with a carryover of 1 to the previous digit. However, the previous digit would have had its own sum of divisors, so the carryover affects the digit before it. But since we are concerned with the 2016th digit, which is after the decimal, any carryover would come from the 2017th digit, but since we are only adding up the 1s at the 2016th digit, the value at that digit is the number of divisors modulo 10, plus any carryover from the 2017th digit.Wait, this complicates things. Because when you sum decimals, the carryover propagates from right to left. So the digit at position d is equal to the sum at position d plus any carryover from position d+1. However, in our case, the sum S is an infinite series, but we are truncating it at the term with 1000 nines. Wait, no, actually, the problem states the sum is up to 1/(1000 nines), so the sum is finite. Therefore, each term after that (from k=1001 onwards) is not included. So for the 2016th digit, only the divisors k ≤ 1000 contribute. However, even with finite terms, when adding decimals, the digits are computed by summing all the contributions from each term at that digit, considering any carryover from the digits to the right.Wait, but decimal addition is such that when you sum the digits starting from the rightmost, carryover propagates to the left. However, since we have an infinite decimal expansion (since even the finite sum of repeating decimals would result in a decimal that repeats with period equal to the least common multiple of all the individual periods). Wait, but actually, the sum of these terms would not be an infinite non-repeating decimal, but since each term is a repeating decimal with period k, the sum should eventually become periodic with period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of all the individual periods from 1 to 1000. But the LCM of 1,2,...,1000 is an enormous number, so the period is extremely long. However, the problem states that S is the sum up to 1/(1000 nines), so it&#39;s a finite sum of 1000 terms, each of which is a repeating decimal. Therefore, the sum S is a repeating decimal with a period that divides the LCM of 1 through 1000. But given that LCM is enormous, the decimal expansion doesn&#39;t actually repeat within any practical length.But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore carryover, assuming that the digits don&#39;t interfere with each other. But in reality, when summing these decimals, the digits can carry over. However, given that each term contributes a 1 at positions spaced k apart, starting from the kth position, the 2016th digit is the sum of all k such that k divides 2016 and k ≤ 1000. If that sum is, say, 34, then the digit would be 4 with a carryover of 3 to the 2015th digit. However, the 2015th digit is the sum of divisors of 2015 (if 2015 is the position) that are ≤ 1000, plus any carryover from the 2016th digit. But since we are only asked for the 2016th digit, we have to consider the carryover coming from the 2017th digit. Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the digits do not interfere, i.e., that each digit is simply the count of divisors modulo 10, disregarding carryover. But is that a valid assumption?Wait, in reality, when you add decimals, you have to consider carryover. For example, if you add 0.1111... + 0.1111..., you get 0.2222..., which is straightforward. But if you add 0.9999... + 0.9999..., you get 1.9999... which is equivalent to 2.0000..., but in the context of infinite decimals, it&#39;s allowed to have carries. However, in our case, the sum S is an infinite sum of these terms, but we are only summing up to k=1000. Therefore, each term after k=1000 is not included. However, even with k up to 1000, the sum S is still a finite sum of repeating decimals. So the total sum S will have a decimal expansion where each digit is the sum of the number of divisors (k ≤ 1000) of that digit position. However, when summing, these digits can be more than 10, leading to carryover.Therefore, the digit at position d is equal to (number of divisors k ≤ 1000 of d) plus carryover from position d+1, modulo 10, and the carryover from position d is floor((number + carryover)/10). However, because we are dealing with an infinite sum, but in our case, the terms are finite (up to k=1000), but each term contributes 1s infinitely. Wait, no. Each term 1/(10^k -1) is a repeating decimal with period k, contributing 1s every k digits. So even though the sum is finite, the decimal expansion is infinite, with 1s repeating every k digits for each k from 1 to 1000. Therefore, the decimal expansion is the sum of all these infinite sequences. Therefore, when we add them up, we have overlapping 1s at various positions, which can sum to more than 10, leading to carryover.But calculating the exact digit at position 2016 is complicated due to potential carryover from positions beyond 2016. However, if we can argue that beyond a certain position, there are no more contributions, then maybe carryover can be bounded.But since each term contributes 1s every k digits, for k up to 1000, the positions affected by these terms go on indefinitely. So even at position 2016, there can be carryover from positions beyond 2016. For example, if position 2016 + m has a digit sum that causes a carryover, which propagates left to position 2016. However, carryover propagates from right to left, so the digit at position 2016 is affected by carryover from positions 2017, 2018, etc. But how can we compute this without knowing the entire decimal expansion up to that point?This seems intractable. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that there are no carryover effects, or that the number of divisors is less than 10, so no carryover occurs. But in our case, the number of divisors of 2016 is 36, but we are only counting those ≤1000, which is 34. 34 mod 10 is 4, but 34 is greater than 10, so the actual digit would be 4 with a carryover of 3. However, the carryover would come from the digit to the right, i.e., 2017th digit. But then the 2017th digit would have its own number of divisors, say x, plus carryover from 2018th digit, etc. This creates a chain of dependencies.This seems really complicated. So perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Maybe the problem is designed such that after a certain number of terms, the contributions to the decimal digits become predictable, or maybe the carryover cancels out in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the sum converges to a number where the decimal expansion can be determined without worrying about carryover. Alternatively, maybe the problem is set in such a way that the number of divisors is small enough that no carryover occurs.Wait, let&#39;s check how many divisors 2016 has. 36 total divisors, with 34 ≤1000. If we have 34 ones added at the 2016th decimal place, then that would be 34. But 34 divided by 10 is 3 with remainder 4. Therefore, the digit would be 4 and carryover 3 to the previous (2015th) digit. But this carryover would affect the 2015th digit. However, the question is only about the 2016th digit. But the problem is that the 2016th digit&#39;s value is affected by carryover from the 2017th digit, which in turn is affected by carryover from the 2018th, and so on. Therefore, unless we can show that there&#39;s no carryover into the 2016th digit, we can&#39;t just take the number of divisors modulo 10.But this seems impossible to compute manually. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes no carryover, so we can just take the number of divisors modulo 10. Alternatively, perhaps the structure of the series is such that each digit is precisely equal to the number of divisors modulo 10. But is that a valid assumption?Alternatively, maybe when summing all these series, the carryover does not affect the 2016th digit. Let&#39;s test with a smaller example. Let&#39;s take S = 1/9 + 1/99. So S = 0.1111... + 0.010101...Adding these together:0.1 1 1 1 1 1 1...+ 0.0 1 0 1 0 1 0...= 0.1 2 1 2 1 2 1...But in reality, when adding decimals, 1 + 0 =1, 1+1=2, 1+0=1, etc. So there&#39;s no carryover here. So the digits are just the sum of the digits in each position. Similarly, if we add another term, say 1/999 (0.001001...), then at positions 3,6,9,..., we add 1, so the digit becomes 2 at position 3, 2 at position 6, etc. But if we have three terms: 1/9 + 1/99 +1/999, then position 1:1, position2:1+0=1, position3:1+0+1=2, position4:1+1+0=2, position5:1+0+0=1, position6:1+1+1=3, etc. So in this case, digits can be greater than 10 only if there are more than 10 terms contributing to the same digit. However, in our problem, the number of terms contributing to the 2016th digit is 34. So 34 ones added together, which is 34, so the digit would be 34 modulo 10, which is 4, with a carryover of 3. However, this carryover affects the previous digit (2015th). But the problem is asking for the 2016th digit. So the value of the 2016th digit is 4 plus any carryover coming from the 2017th digit. However, the 2017th digit&#39;s value is equal to the number of divisors of 2017 that are ≤1000. Since 2017 is a prime number (I think), let&#39;s check.Wait, 2017 is a prime number. Yes, 2017 is a prime. So the divisors of 2017 are 1 and 2017. Since 2017 &gt; 1000, the number of divisors ≤1000 is 1. So the 2017th digit is 1. Therefore, when adding up, the 2017th digit is 1, which doesn&#39;t cause any carryover. Therefore, the carryover from the 2017th digit to the 2016th digit is 0. Therefore, the 2016th digit is 34 (from its own divisors) plus 0 carryover, resulting in 34, which is 4 modulo 10. So the digit is 4.Wait, but let&#39;s check this logic. If the 2017th digit is 1, then there&#39;s no carryover from the 2017th to the 2016th. Then the 2016th digit is 34, which would be 4 with a carryover of 3 to the 2015th digit. But the 2015th digit is computed as the number of divisors of 2015 that are ≤1000, plus the carryover from the 2016th digit. But since we are only concerned with the 2016th digit, this doesn&#39;t affect our answer. Therefore, as long as the carryover into the 2016th digit is 0, then the 2016th digit is 34 mod 10 =4.But how do we know that there is no carryover from the 2017th digit? Because the 2017th digit is 1, which is less than 10, so no carryover occurs. Similarly, the 2018th digit is the number of divisors of 2018 ≤1000. 2018 is 2×1009. 1009 is a prime number. Therefore, the divisors of 2018 are 1, 2, 1009, 2018. Divisors ≤1000 are 1 and 2. So the 2018th digit is 2. Therefore, no carryover from 2018th digit. Similarly, the 2019th digit is the number of divisors of 2019. 2019 factors into 3×673. Both 3 and 673 are primes. Divisors are 1, 3, 673, 2019. Divisors ≤1000 are 1,3,673. So 3 divisors, so the digit is 3. No carryover. The 2020th digit: divisors of 2020. 2020 = 2^2 *5 *101. Divisors are 1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505,1010,2020. Divisors ≤1000: 1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505. Total 10 divisors. So the digit is 0 with a carryover of 1. But wait, 10 divisors would be 10 mod10 =0, carryover 1. So the 2020th digit is 0, but there&#39;s a carryover of 1 to the 2019th digit. Therefore, this carryover affects the 2019th digit. However, the 2020th digit is to the right of the 2016th digit, so carryover propagates left. Therefore, the carryover from 2020 affects 2019, but not 2016. Therefore, the 2016th digit is only affected by carryover from the 2017th digit, which is 0. Similarly, the 2017th digit is affected by carryover from 2018th digit, which is 0, and so on. So in our case, since all digits to the right of 2016 (i.e., 2017,2018,...) have digits that are less than 10, there is no carryover into the 2016th digit. Therefore, the 2016th digit is indeed 34 mod10=4.Therefore, the answer should be 4.But let me check another example to verify this approach. Let&#39;s take a smaller digit position where we can compute manually.Suppose we want to find the 6th digit of S =1/9 +1/99 +1/999 +... up to k=1000.The 6th digit: number of divisors of 6 ≤1000. Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. All ≤1000. So 4 divisors. So the 6th digit should be 4. Let&#39;s check by adding the decimals:1/9 =0.11111111...1/99=0.01010101...1/999=0.001001001...1/9999=0.000100010001...... up to k=1000.Adding these up, the 1st digit:1, 2nd:1+0=1, 3rd:1+0+0=1, 4th:1+1+0+0=2, 5th:1+0+0+0=1, 6th:1+1+1+0=3. Wait, this contradicts our previous conclusion. According to this manual addition, the 6th digit is 3, but according to the divisor count, we have 4 divisors (1,2,3,6). Wait, why is there a discrepancy?Ah! Wait a second. Because when we add 1/999, which has a 1 at position 3,6,9,..., but 1/999 is 0.001001001..., so the 6th digit is indeed 1. Then 1/9999 contributes a 1 at position 4,8,12,..., so no contribution to the 6th digit. Similarly, higher k terms (k&gt;6) do not contribute to the 6th digit. So actually, the 6th digit is sum of 1/9 (1 at 6th digit), 1/99 (1 at 6th digit since 99 has period 2, contributing to even positions), 1/999 (period 3, contributing to multiples of 3, so 6th digit), 1/9999 (period 4, no contribution to 6th digit), 1/99999 (period 5, no contribution), 1/999999 (period 6, contributes to 6th digit). Wait, hold on. Wait, term k=6, which is 1/999999, has period 6, so contributes a 1 at positions 6,12,18,... Therefore, the 6th digit is contributed by k=1 (every digit), k=2 (every 2nd digit), k=3 (every 3rd digit), k=6 (every 6th digit). So divisors of 6:1,2,3,6. Therefore, four terms contributing 1s. So why does the manual addition give only 3?Wait, let&#39;s do the addition step by step. Let&#39;s compute the sum up to k=6:S = 1/9 +1/99 +1/999 +1/9999 +1/99999 +1/999999Compute each term&#39;s decimal up to the 6th digit:1/9 =0.111111...1/99=0.010101...1/999=0.001001...1/9999=0.000100...1/99999=0.000010...1/999999=0.000001...So adding these up:Position 1:1 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0=1Position 2:1 +1 +0 +0 +0 +0=2Position3:1 +0 +1 +0 +0 +0=2Position4:1 +1 +0 +1 +0 +0=3Position5:1 +0 +0 +0 +1 +0=2Position6:1 +1 +1 +0 +0 +1=4Therefore, the 6th digit is 4. Which matches the divisor count method. However, in my previous manual addition, I only considered up to k=3, which was a mistake. Therefore, if we include all terms up to k=6, the 6th digit is indeed 4. So my initial mistake was not considering higher k terms. Therefore, the divisor count method is correct when we include all terms up to k=1000.Therefore, returning to the original problem, since 2016th digit&#39;s value is equal to the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤1000, which is 34, and 34 mod10=4. Since there is no carryover into the 2016th digit (as established earlier), the 2016th digit is indeed 4.Therefore, the answer is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Given the series ( S = frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{99} + frac{1}{999} + cdots + frac{1}{1000 text{ nines}} ), we need to find the 2016th digit after the decimal point of ( S ).Each term in the series ( frac{1}{10^k - 1} ) (where ( k ) is the number of nines in the denominator) contributes a 1 at every ( k )-th decimal place. Therefore, the 2016th digit after the decimal point is the sum of 1s contributed by each term where ( k ) divides 2016 and ( k leq 1000 ).First, we factorize 2016:[2016 = 2^5 times 3^2 times 7]The total number of divisors of 2016 is calculated as:[(5+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 6 times 3 times 2 = 36]We need to exclude the divisors of 2016 that are greater than 1000. The divisors of 2016 greater than 1000 are 1008 and 2016 itself. Therefore, the number of divisors of 2016 that are less than or equal to 1000 is:[36 - 2 = 34]The 2016th digit after the decimal point is the number of such divisors modulo 10:[34 mod 10 = 4]Thus, the 2016th digit after the decimal point of ( S ) is (boxed{4}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to figure out the 2016th digit after the decimal point of the sum S, which is given by the series S = 1/9 + 1/99 + 1/999 + ... + 1/(1000 nines). Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what each term in this series looks like.First, the denominators are numbers made up of nines. The first term is 1/9, which is 0.1111..., right? Then the next term is 1/99, which is 0.01010101..., then 1/999 is 0.001001001..., and so on. Each subsequent term has a denominator with one more nine than the previous one, so the nth term is 1/(10^n - 1), I think. Because 9 is 10 - 1, 99 is 100 - 1, 999 is 1000 - 1, etc. So yeah, each term is 1/(10^n - 1) where n starts at 1 and goes up to 1000, since the last term is 1000 nines. So the series is from n=1 to n=1000 of 1/(10^n - 1).But the problem asks for the 2016th digit after the decimal point of the sum S. So I need to compute this sum up to 1000 terms and find the 2016th decimal digit. Since these terms are all decimals with repeating patterns, adding them up will involve some sort of overlapping or carrying over in their decimal expansions. But calculating the sum directly up to 1000 terms seems impossible by hand, especially since 1000 terms would create a decimal expansion with a lot of digits. However, since the question is about the 2016th digit, maybe there&#39;s a pattern or a way to approximate the sum beyond a certain point where the digits stabilize?Let me try to write out the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges.First term: 1/9 = 0.1111111111...Second term: 1/99 = 0.0101010101...Third term: 1/999 = 0.001001001001...Fourth term: 1/9999 = 0.000100010001...And so on, up to the 1000th term: 1/(10^1000 - 1) = 0.000...0001 repeating, with 999 zeros between each 1.So when we add these together, each subsequent term adds a 1 in a position that&#39;s further to the right, spaced by the number of nines in the denominator. So the first term has a 1 every digit, the second term every second digit, the third every third, and so on. Wait, no, actually, 1/99 has a period of 2, so it repeats every 2 digits: 01, 01, 01... So the 1s are in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., decimal places. Similarly, 1/999 has a period of 3, so the 1s are every 3rd digit: 001, 001, etc. So when we sum all these, each term contributes a 1 every k digits, where k is the term&#39;s position in the series. Therefore, the total sum S will have a 1 in the decimal places that are multiples of 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000. But since they&#39;re being added, when multiple terms contribute a 1 to the same decimal place, those digits will add up. For example, the first decimal place is 1 from the first term, 0 from the others. The second decimal place is 1 from the first term (1/9) and 1 from the second term (1/99), so total 2. The third decimal place is 1 from the first term, 0 from the second, and 1 from the third term, so total 2. The fourth decimal place: 1 from the first term, 1 from the second term, 0 from the third, so total 2. The fifth decimal place: 1 from the first term, 0 from others, so 1. Wait, this might not be accurate. Let me check again.Wait, actually, each term contributes a 1 every k digits. So for the first term (k=1), every digit has a 1. For the second term (k=2), every even digit has a 1. For the third term (k=3), every third digit has a 1, and so on. So when you sum all terms, each digit position n (starting from 1) will have a number of 1s equal to the number of divisors of n. For example, the first digit (n=1) is only contributed by the first term (k=1), so 1. The second digit (n=2) is contributed by k=1 and k=2, so 2. The third digit (n=3) is contributed by k=1 and k=3, so 2. The fourth digit (n=4) is contributed by k=1, k=2, and k=4 (if there is a k=4 term). Wait, but our series goes up to k=1000, so for any n ≤ 1000, the number of 1s contributing to the nth digit is equal to the number of divisors of n. But if n &gt; 1000, then only the terms with k ≤ n where k divides n and k ≤ 1000. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.Each term k contributes a 1 to every digit position that is a multiple of k. So the nth digit is the sum over all k that divide n and k ≤ 1000. So if n ≤ 1000, then the number of divisors of n is the number of 1s added to that digit. If n &gt; 1000, then it&#39;s the number of divisors of n that are ≤ 1000. Therefore, the nth digit after the decimal is equal to the number of divisors of n, if n ≤ 1000, or the number of divisors of n that are ≤ 1000 otherwise.But in our case, we need to find the 2016th digit. Since 2016 &gt; 1000, the 2016th digit will be the sum over all divisors k of 2016 where k ≤ 1000. Each such k contributes a 1, so the digit is equal to the number of divisors of 2016 that are less than or equal to 1000. Then, once we have that count, the digit is the count modulo 10, since if the count is more than 10, there would be a carryover from previous digits. Wait, but hold on, the problem is that when adding these 1s, if the sum at a digit is 10 or more, there would be a carryover to the previous digit. But decimal digits go from 0 to 9, so if a digit&#39;s sum is, say, 12, then it would be 2 with a carryover of 1 to the next higher digit (i.e., the digit to the left). However, in our case, the way we&#39;re adding these terms, each term contributes 1s to the digits, but when summed, if there&#39;s a carryover, that complicates the digit values. However, the original terms are non-overlapping in their 1s? Wait, no, actually, when you add 0.1111... + 0.010101... + 0.001001..., etc., the 1s can overlap. For example, the 6th digit: 1 from term 1 (every digit), 1 from term 2 (every even digit), 1 from term 3 (every third digit), 1 from term 6 (every sixth digit), etc. So if multiple terms contribute 1s to the same digit, the total would be the number of terms contributing to that digit. However, since each term is added as a decimal expansion, when summing the series, digits can carry over. But actually, each term is a separate infinite decimal, so when you add them all together, each digit in the sum is the sum of the corresponding digits in each term. But since each term&#39;s digits are 0 or 1, the sum at each digit is the number of terms that have a 1 in that digit. However, when you add numbers with infinite decimal expansions, you have to consider that the addition is performed digit by digit, which could result in carries. Wait, but actually, in reality, adding infinite decimals isn&#39;t straightforward because of potential carries propagating infinitely. But in this case, since each subsequent term has 1s further to the right, maybe the carries don&#39;t affect earlier digits? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Wait, perhaps another approach. The sum S can be written as the sum from k=1 to 1000 of 1/(10^k - 1). Each term 1/(10^k - 1) can be expressed as a decimal with a repeating cycle of k digits, all 0s except for a 1 at the end of each cycle. So for example, 1/9 = 0.(1), 1/99 = 0.(01), 1/999 = 0.(001), etc. Therefore, when these are added together, each term contributes a 1 every k digits. Therefore, the total sum S will have, in each decimal position n, a 1 for every k that divides n and k ≤ 1000. Therefore, the value of the nth decimal digit is equal to the number of divisors k of n with k ≤ 1000. However, each of these contributes 1, so the digit is the number of such divisors. But if this number is 10 or more, there will be a carryover into the previous digit. Wait, but carryover propagates to the left, so the digit at position n is affected by carryovers from position n+1, n+2, etc. This complicates things because the digit at position n isn&#39;t just the number of divisors, but also any carries that come from digits beyond n. However, since each term is added as a decimal expansion, perhaps the standard way to compute the sum is by adding digit by digit from the right, but since the decimals are infinite, this is not feasible. Therefore, maybe we need to consider that the carryover only affects digits to the left, but since we are looking for the 2016th digit, which is relatively far to the right, maybe the carryover from digits beyond 2016 can be neglected? Or perhaps there&#39;s a pattern that emerges after a certain point.Alternatively, maybe the sum S can be expressed in a closed-form formula, which we can then use to compute the decimal expansion up to the desired digit. Let me recall that the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/(10^k - 1) is known, but in this case, we have a finite sum up to k=1000. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps approximate the tail of the sum beyond a certain k, so that the contribution to the decimal digits beyond a certain point is negligible. Since each term 1/(10^k - 1) is approximately 10^{-k}, so the terms decrease exponentially. Therefore, the sum from k=2017 to 1000 would contribute to digits beyond the 2016th digit? Wait, no, the term 1/(10^k -1) affects every kth digit. So, for example, the term 1/(10^1000 - 1) affects digits 1000, 2000, 3000, etc. So for the 2016th digit, contributions come from all divisors k of 2016 that are ≤ 1000, and also from terms where k divides a number of the form 2016 - m*k for some m? Wait, this is getting confusing.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. The decimal expansions of each term 1/(10^k -1) have 1s at positions k, 2k, 3k, etc. So for the 2016th digit, which is position 2016, the terms that contribute to this digit are those terms where k divides 2016. For example, term k=1 contributes to every digit, so it contributes 1 to digit 2016. Term k=2 contributes to every even digit, so if 2016 is even, which it is, term k=2 contributes 1. Similarly, term k=3 contributes if 3 divides 2016, which it does. So in general, for each k that divides 2016 and k ≤ 1000, term k will contribute a 1 to digit 2016. Therefore, the total number of 1s contributing to digit 2016 is equal to the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤ 1000. Then, the value of the digit is this number modulo 10, plus any carryover from digits beyond the 2016th. But how do we account for carryover?Carryover occurs when the sum of digits at a certain position is 10 or more. However, in our case, each digit&#39;s value is the number of divisors of its position (if the position is ≤ 1000) or the number of divisors of the position that are ≤ 1000. Since the number of divisors of a number n is O(n^{ε}) for any ε &gt; 0, which grows very slowly. For example, the maximum number of divisors a number can have is roughly around n^{0.07} for n up to 10^6 or something. So, for n=2016, the number of divisors is known. Let&#39;s compute it.First, factorize 2016. 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008; 1008 ÷ 2 = 504; 504 ÷ 2 = 252; 252 ÷ 2 = 126; 126 ÷ 2 = 63. So that&#39;s 2^5. Then 63 ÷ 3 = 21; 21 ÷ 3 = 7. So 3^2. Then 7 is prime. So prime factorization is 2^5 * 3^2 * 7^1. The number of divisors is (5+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 6*3*2 = 36. So 2016 has 36 divisors. But not all of these divisors are ≤ 1000. Wait, 2016&#39;s divisors can be as large as 2016 itself. So we need to count how many of the 36 divisors are ≤ 1000.To find the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤ 1000. Since 2016 is 2016, its divisors come in pairs multiplying to 2016. For each divisor d ≤ sqrt(2016), there&#39;s a corresponding divisor 2016/d ≥ sqrt(2016). So sqrt(2016) is approximately 44.91. So divisors ≤ 44.91 are paired with divisors ≥ 44.91. So all divisors ≤ 44.91 are ≤ 1000, obviously. The larger divisors are 2016/d where d ≤ 44.91. So we need to check if 2016/d is ≤ 1000.Wait, 2016/d ≤ 1000 =&gt; d ≥ 2016/1000 =&gt; d ≥ 2.016. Since d must be an integer divisor, so d ≥ 3. But since all divisors less than sqrt(2016) (~44.91) are paired with divisors greater than sqrt(2016). So to count the number of divisors ≤ 1000, we can note that all divisors of 2016 are either ≤ 44 or ≥ 2016/44 ≈ 45.8. So the divisors greater than 45.8 would be 2016/d where d ≤ 44. So let&#39;s compute all the divisors.But maybe a better approach is to note that since 2016 is 2^5 * 3^2 * 7^1, all divisors are of the form 2^a * 3^b * 7^c where a ≤5, b ≤2, c ≤1. Now, we need to count how many such combinations result in a number ≤1000.Alternatively, since 2016 has 36 divisors, and each divisor d &gt;1000 would correspond to a divisor 2016/d &lt; 2016/1000 = 2.016. But since d must be an integer, the only possible divisor less than 2.016 is 1. Therefore, there&#39;s exactly one divisor greater than 1000, which is 2016 itself. Because 2016/1 = 2016, which is the only divisor pair where d=1 and 2016/1=2016. Therefore, the number of divisors of 2016 ≤1000 is 36 -1=35. Therefore, the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤1000 is 35. Therefore, the 2016th digit is 35 modulo 10, which is 5. But wait, but this is assuming that there is no carryover from the digits beyond the 2016th digit. However, if the sum at digit 2016 is 35, that would mean the digit is 5 with a carryover of 3 to the previous digit. But then the previous digit (2015th) would have its own sum plus 3, which might cause another carryover, and so on. Therefore, this complicates things because the carryover from digit 2016 could affect digits to the left, but the question is about the 2016th digit itself. However, carryover propagates to the left, meaning that the value of the 2016th digit is determined by the sum at 2016 plus any carryover coming from the 2017th digit, 2018th, etc. But if we can show that the sum beyond the 2016th digit does not produce a carryover that affects the 2016th digit, then the digit would be 5. But how can we be sure?Wait, the problem is that the digits to the right of the 2016th (i.e., 2017th, 2018th, etc.) can produce carryover when their sums exceed 9, which would carry over to the 2016th digit. However, since each term in the series S contributes 1s only at positions that are multiples of their respective k. For the digits beyond 2016, the terms that can contribute to those digits are terms with k ≤1000. So, for example, the 2017th digit receives contributions from divisors of 2017 that are ≤1000. But 2017 is a prime number (I recall that 2017 was a prime year). Let me check: 2017 ÷2=1008.5, ÷3=672.333..., ÷5=403.4, ÷7≈288.142..., ÷11≈183.363..., ÷13≈155.153..., ÷17≈118.647..., ÷19≈106.157..., ÷23≈87.7... ÷29≈69.55... ÷31≈65.06... ÷37≈54.51... ÷41≈49.195... ÷43≈46.906... So none of these divide 2017, so yes, 2017 is prime. Therefore, the 2017th digit will have contributions only from k=1 and k=2017. But since k=2017 is not in our sum (we only go up to k=1000), so the 2017th digit is contributed only by k=1, which is 1. Therefore, digit 2017 is 1, no carryover. Similarly, digit 2018: factors of 2018. 2018=2×1009. 1009 is a prime (I think), yes, 1009 is a prime. So divisors of 2018 are 1, 2, 1009, 2018. So contributions to digit 2018 are from k=1 and k=2. So digit 2018&#39;s sum is 2. Therefore, digit 2018 is 2, no carryover. Similarly, digit 2019: 2019 ÷3=673, 673 is prime. So 2019=3×673. Divisors are 1, 3, 673, 2019. So contributions from k=1 and k=3. Sum is 2. Digit 2019 is 2. No carryover. Digit 2020: 2020=2^2×5×101. Divisors are 1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505,1010,2020. So contributions from k=1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505,1010. But since k ≤1000, the divisors ≤1000 are 1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505. So 10 divisors. Therefore, digit 2020&#39;s sum is 10. Then, 10 mod 10 is 0 with a carryover of 1 to digit 2019. Wait, but carryover is to the left. So if digit 2020 is 10, then digit 2020 becomes 0 and carryover 1 to digit 2019. But digit 2019 was originally 2. Adding 1 makes it 3. But digit 2019 is 3, which doesn&#39;t cause a carryover. However, this affects digit 2019, but we are concerned about digit 2016. The carryover from digit 2020 affects digit 2019, which is one digit left (i.e., closer to the decimal point). So this carryover doesn&#39;t affect digit 2016. Similarly, any carryover from digits beyond 2016 would only affect digits 2017, 2016, etc., but unless there is a chain of carryovers reaching back to 2016, which seems unlikely.But to be thorough, let&#39;s check if the digits beyond 2016 can produce a carryover that propagates all the way to 2016. For this to happen, there must be a sequence of digits starting from some digit beyond 2016 where each digit&#39;s sum plus carryover is 10 or more, causing a carryover to the previous digit. This is called a chain of carryovers. However, given that each term contributes 1s spaced further apart, the number of 1s contributing to each digit beyond 2016 decreases as the digits increase. For example, the further right you go, the fewer terms contribute to those digits because the terms have periods up to 1000. So beyond digit 1000, the only terms contributing are those with k ≤1000 where k divides the digit position. The number of divisors for a number tends to be small, unless the number is highly composite. However, the maximum number of divisors for numbers around 2016 is 36 (as in 2016 itself). But as numbers increase beyond 2016, their number of divisors fluctuates but doesn&#39;t have a clear trend. However, even if some digits beyond 2016 have high numbers of divisors, the probability that a chain of carryovers starting from a digit far to the right would affect digit 2016 is extremely low. Moreover, even if such a chain existed, it would require that each digit in the chain from, say, position 2016 + m to 2016 has a sum of 9, so that a carryover would push it to 10, causing another carryover. However, given the terms contributing to those digits, it&#39;s highly unlikely.Alternatively, perhaps we can bound the possible carryover. Let&#39;s consider the maximum possible sum at any digit beyond 2016. Each digit n &gt;2016 can have at most the number of divisors of n that are ≤1000. The maximum number of divisors any number has is roughly O(n^ε), but for n &gt;2016, even if a number has, say, 100 divisors (which is a lot), the sum at that digit would be 100, leading to a digit of 0 and carryover of 10. But wait, 100 mod 10 is 0 with a carryover of 10. Wait, actually, if the sum is 100, then the digit is 0 and carryover is 10. But carryover is per digit, so if the sum is 100, you can only carryover 10 to the next digit, which would be 100//10 = 10. Wait, actually, when summing digits, each digit can have a maximum of 9 + 9 + ... but in our case, the sum is the number of divisors, which is potentially up to around 100. However, in reality, numbers don&#39;t have that many divisors. For example, 2016 has 36 divisors, which is a lot, but numbers larger than 2016 will have fewer divisors on average. But even if we suppose a digit n has 36 divisors, then the sum is 36, leading to a digit of 6 with a carryover of 3. Then, the next digit to the left (n-1) would have its sum plus 3. If that sum is, say, 5 + 3 = 8, no problem. If it&#39;s 7 + 3 = 10, then it becomes 0 with a carryover of 1. So it&#39;s possible for a single carryover to propagate a few digits, but to reach from digit n to digit 2016 would require a chain of carryovers over hundreds of digits, each time adding 1 to the next digit. But given that the number of divisors for each digit is variable, and the probability that each subsequent digit&#39;s sum plus carryover is exactly 9, leading to another carryover, is extremely low. In reality, such long chains of carryover are negligible. Therefore, it&#39;s safe to assume that the carryover from digits beyond 2016 does not affect the 2016th digit. Therefore, the 2016th digit is simply the number of divisors of 2016 that are ≤1000, modulo 10. As we calculated earlier, 2016 has 36 divisors, one of which is 2016 itself, which is &gt;1000, so 35 divisors ≤1000. Therefore, 35 mod 10 is 5. So the 2016th digit is 5.Wait, but let me verify the number of divisors of 2016 ≤1000. 2016&#39;s divisors include all numbers from 1 up to 2016 that divide it. Since 2016 is 2^5 * 3^2 * 7^1, the divisors are generated by exponents of the primes: 2^a * 3^b * 7^c where 0 ≤ a ≤5, 0 ≤ b ≤2, 0 ≤ c ≤1. Each combination of a, b, c gives a divisor. The total number is (5+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 6*3*2 = 36. Now, to find how many of these are ≤1000. The largest divisor is 2016 itself. The next largest would be 2016/2=1008, then 2016/3=672, 2016/4=504, etc. Wait, so the divisors come in pairs multiplying to 2016. So for each divisor d ≤ sqrt(2016) ≈44.9, there&#39;s a corresponding divisor 2016/d. So the divisors greater than 44.9 are 2016/d where d is a divisor less than 44.9. Now, the divisor 2016/d is greater than 1000 only when d &lt; 2016/1000 = 2.016. The only integer divisor less than 2.016 is 1. Therefore, the only divisor greater than 1000 is 2016/1 =2016. Therefore, the number of divisors ≤1000 is 36 -1=35. Therefore, the count is indeed 35. Therefore, the 2016th digit is 35 mod 10 =5. Therefore, the answer is 5. However, we need to check if there&#39;s a carryover from digit 2016 itself. Wait, no, carryover to the previous digit (2015th) would be 35//10=3, but the digit itself is 35%10=5. However, since we are only concerned with the 2016th digit, any carryover from digit 2016 would affect digit 2015, but not digit 2016. Therefore, the 2016th digit is indeed 5. Therefore, the final answer is 5.Final Answerboxed{5}&lt;/think&gt;Given the series ( S = frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{99} + frac{1}{999} + cdots + frac{1}{1000 text{ nines}} ), we need to find the 2016th digit after the decimal point of ( S ).Each term in the series ( frac{1}{10^k - 1} ) (where ( k ) ranges from 1 to 1000) contributes a 1 to every ( k )-th digit after the decimal point. Therefore, the 2016th digit is the sum of the number of divisors of 2016 that are less than or equal to 1000.First, we factorize 2016:[2016 = 2^5 times 3^2 times 7]The number of divisors of 2016 is calculated by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiplying the results:[(5+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 6 times 3 times 2 = 36]The divisors of 2016 come in pairs. The only divisor greater than 1000 is 2016 itself. Therefore, the number of divisors of 2016 that are less than or equal to 1000 is:[36 - 1 = 35]The 2016th digit after the decimal point is the sum of these 35 divisors modulo 10:[35 mod 10 = 5]Thus, the 2016th digit after the decimal point of ( S ) is (boxed{5}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-5fefdbb4></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5fefdbb4><span class="icon" data-v-5fefdbb4>🔑:</span>【Solution】Solution: According to the analysis,begin{array}{l}S=frac{1}{9}+frac{1}{99}+frac{1}{999}+cdots+frac{1}{1000 uparrow 9}=0 . dot{1}+0.01+0.001^{+} 0.0001^{+cdots}+0.999 text {  zeros }; n uparrow 9= 0_{n-1 text { zeros}} 1end{array}The 4th, nth, 2nth, 3nth, ... positions after the decimal point are all 1, when n is a divisor of 2016, the 2016th position after the decimal point is 1, otherwise, the 2016th position after the decimal point is 0. 2016=2^{5} times 3^{2} times 7, has (5+1) times(2+1)(1+1)=36 divisors, and there are two divisors greater than 1000: 1008, 2016, so there are 36-2=34 divisors not greater than 1000;Without considering the carry, there are 34 ones added at this position, so the digit at this position is 4.Now consider the carry,2017th position: 2017 is a prime number, so there is only 1 one added at the 2017th position, which does not cause a carry;2018th position: 2018=2 times 1009, has 4 divisors, so there are 2 ones added at the 2018th position, which also does not cause a carry; positions 2019 and beyond are insufficient to carry to the 2016th position;In summary, the 2016th position after the decimal point of S is 4.Therefore, the answer is: 4.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-16350089 data-v-5fefdbb4><div class="review" data-v-5fefdbb4><div class="review-title" data-v-5fefdbb4><span class="icon" data-v-5fefdbb4>❓:</span>The solution set to the inequality x^2 - 5x - 14 &lt; 0 is __________.</div><div class="divider" data-v-5fefdbb4></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5fefdbb4><span class="icon" data-v-5fefdbb4>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve the inequality ( x^2 - 5x - 14 &lt; 0 ). Hmm, quadratic inequalities. Let me remember how to approach this. I think the first step is to solve the corresponding quadratic equation ( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 ) to find the critical points, which will divide the number line into intervals. Then I can test each interval to see where the inequality holds true.Alright, let me start by solving ( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 ). To do this, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ( ax^2 + bx + c ), so here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -5 ), and ( c = -14 ). The quadratic formula is ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ).Plugging in the values: ( x = frac{-(-5) pm sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)} ). That simplifies to ( x = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} ). Wait, because the discriminant part is ( b^2 - 4ac ), so ( (-5)^2 = 25, 4ac = 4*1*(-14) = -56, so it&#39;s 25 - (-56) = 25 + 56 = 81. Oh, nice, the discriminant is 81, which is a perfect square. So square root of 81 is 9. Therefore, the solutions are ( x = frac{5 pm 9}{2} ).Calculating the two roots: first, ( frac{5 + 9}{2} = frac{14}{2} = 7 ). Second, ( frac{5 - 9}{2} = frac{-4}{2} = -2 ). So the roots are x = 7 and x = -2.These roots divide the number line into three intervals: ( (-infty, -2) ), ( (-2, 7) ), and ( (7, infty) ). Now, the inequality ( x^2 - 5x - 14 &lt; 0 ) will be satisfied in the intervals where the quadratic expression is negative. Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. That means the expression will be below zero (negative) between the two roots. So the solution should be the interval between -2 and 7.But let me verify this by testing a point in each interval.First interval: ( (-infty, -2) ). Let&#39;s pick x = -3. Plugging into the quadratic: ( (-3)^2 -5*(-3) -14 = 9 +15 -14 = 10. 10 is positive, so the inequality is not satisfied here.Second interval: ( (-2, 7) ). Let&#39;s take x = 0. Plugging in: ( 0^2 -5*0 -14 = -14. Which is negative. So the inequality holds here.Third interval: ( (7, infty) ). Let&#39;s choose x = 8. Plugging in: ( 64 -40 -14 = 10. Positive again, so inequality doesn&#39;t hold.Therefore, the solution set is the interval between -2 and 7. But let me double-check if I did everything correctly.Wait, the quadratic opens upwards because the coefficient of x² is positive. So the graph is a parabola opening upwards, crossing the x-axis at x = -2 and x = 7. So the part of the parabola between the roots is below the x-axis, hence negative. That matches the test points. So the solution is indeed (-2, 7).But just to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in solving the quadratic equation. Let me re-calculate the roots.Original equation: ( x^2 -5x -14 = 0 ).Quadratic formula: ( x = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 56)] / 2 = [5 ± sqrt(81)] / 2 = [5 ± 9]/2. So 5 + 9 =14, divided by 2 is 7. 5 -9 = -4, divided by 2 is -2. Correct. So the critical points are right.Another way to check is to factor the quadratic. Let me see if it factors. We need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm. Let&#39;s think: factors of -14:  -7 and 2. Because -7 * 2 = -14, and -7 + 2 = -5. Yes! So the quadratic factors as (x - 7)(x + 2). Let&#39;s check: (x - 7)(x + 2) = x² +2x -7x -14 = x² -5x -14. Perfect, so factored correctly.Therefore, the inequality can be written as (x - 7)(x + 2) &lt; 0.To solve this inequality, we need to find where the product of (x - 7) and (x + 2) is negative. A product is negative when one factor is positive and the other is negative.So, the critical points are still x = -2 and x =7, dividing the number line into three intervals.For x &lt; -2: both (x -7) and (x +2) are negative. So their product is positive.For x between -2 and7: (x +2) is positive, (x -7) is negative. So product is negative.For x &gt;7: both factors are positive. Product is positive.Therefore, the inequality (x -7)(x +2) &lt;0 holds when x is between -2 and7.So solution set is (-2,7).Wait, the original inequality is strict (&lt;0), not including equality, so we don&#39;t include the endpoints. Hence, open intervals.Everything seems consistent. I think that&#39;s the correct answer.Final AnswerThe solution set is boxed{(-2, 7)}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the inequality ( x^2 - 5x - 14 &lt; 0 ), we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation ( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 ) using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -5 ), and ( c = -14 ). Plugging in these values, we get:[x = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} = frac{5 pm 9}{2}]This gives the roots:[x = frac{14}{2} = 7 quad text{and} quad x = frac{-4}{2} = -2]These roots divide the number line into three intervals: ( (-infty, -2) ), ( (-2, 7) ), and ( (7, infty) ). We test each interval to determine where the quadratic expression is negative.- For ( x in (-infty, -2) ), choosing ( x = -3 ) gives a positive result.- For ( x in (-2, 7) ), choosing ( x = 0 ) gives a negative result.- For ( x in (7, infty) ), choosing ( x = 8 ) gives a positive result.Since the quadratic expression ( x^2 - 5x - 14 ) is negative between the roots ( x = -2 ) and ( x = 7 ), the solution set is the interval ( (-2, 7) ).Additionally, factoring the quadratic expression confirms the solution:[(x - 7)(x + 2) &lt; 0]The product is negative when ( x ) is between -2 and 7. Thus, the solution set is:[boxed{(-2, 7)}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve the inequality ( x^2 - 5x - 14 &lt; 0 ). Hmm, quadratic inequalities can be tricky, but let me try to remember the steps. First, I think I should find the roots of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 ). Once I have the roots, those will divide the number line into intervals. Then I can test each interval to see where the quadratic expression is negative. That should give me the solution set for the inequality. Let me start by finding the roots.To solve ( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 ), I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -5 ), and ( c = -14 ). Plugging those values into the formula:( x = frac{-(-5) pm sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)} )Simplify that:( x = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} )Because the term under the square root (the discriminant) is ( 25 + 56 = 81 ). So,( x = frac{5 pm sqrt{81}}{2} )( sqrt{81} = 9 ), so:( x = frac{5 pm 9}{2} )Now, calculating the two roots:First root: ( frac{5 + 9}{2} = frac{14}{2} = 7 )Second root: ( frac{5 - 9}{2} = frac{-4}{2} = -2 )So the roots are at ( x = -2 ) and ( x = 7 ). These are the critical points that divide the number line into three intervals: ( (-infty, -2) ), ( (-2, 7) ), and ( (7, infty) ).Since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive), the parabola will be U-shaped. The quadratic will be below zero (negative) between the two roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality ( x^2 - 5x - 14 &lt; 0 ) should be the interval where the quadratic is negative, which is between the roots. So the solution set is ( (-2, 7) ).Wait, but let me double-check by testing points in each interval to make sure. It&#39;s possible I could have made a mistake in assuming the direction the parabola opens or in calculating the roots.Let me confirm the roots again. The original equation is ( x^2 -5x -14 =0 ). Using quadratic formula, discriminant ( b^2 -4ac = 25 - 4*1*(-14) = 25 + 56 = 81 ). Square root of 81 is 9. So yes, roots are (5 +9)/2 = 7 and (5-9)/2= -2. That&#39;s correct.Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (1), the parabola indeed opens upwards. So it will be negative between the two roots. Therefore, the inequality ( x^2 -5x -14 &lt;0 ) holds true for ( x ) between -2 and 7.But just to be thorough, let me pick a test point in each interval and plug into the quadratic expression to check the sign.First interval: ( (-infty, -2) ). Let&#39;s pick x = -3.Compute ( (-3)^2 -5*(-3) -14 = 9 +15 -14 = 10. Which is positive. So the expression is positive here. So not part of the solution.Second interval: ( (-2,7) ). Let&#39;s pick x = 0.( 0^2 -5*0 -14 = -14. Which is negative. So the expression is negative here. This interval is part of the solution.Third interval: ( (7, infty) ). Let&#39;s pick x = 8.( 8^2 -5*8 -14 = 64 -40 -14 = 10. Positive again. So not part of the solution.Therefore, the solution set is indeed between -2 and 7. So the answer is ( (-2,7) ).But wait, the original inequality is strictly less than zero, not less than or equal to. So we need to exclude the endpoints because at x = -2 and x =7, the expression equals zero. Therefore, the solution is all real numbers between -2 and 7, not including -2 and 7. So interval notation is open parentheses.Yes, that&#39;s consistent with what I found earlier.Therefore, the solution set is ( (-2,7) ).Final AnswerThe solution set is boxed{(-2, 7)}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the inequality ( x^2 - 5x - 14 &lt; 0 ), we first find the roots of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 ) using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -5 ), and ( c = -14 ). Plugging in these values, we get:[x = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} = frac{5 pm 9}{2}]This gives the roots:[x = frac{14}{2} = 7 quad text{and} quad x = frac{-4}{2} = -2]The roots divide the number line into three intervals: ( (-infty, -2) ), ( (-2, 7) ), and ( (7, infty) ).

The problem is about a family in Mexico City needing at least ten cars available every day, but each car they own can&#39;t be used on two specific days of the week. The family gets to choose which two days each car is prohibited. We need to find the smallest number of cars they need to manage this.Hmm, so each car is unavailable on two days. The goal is to cover all seven days of the week with at least ten cars available each day. Since the family can choose the prohibited days, we need to arrange the cars&#39; prohibited days such that on any given day, only a certain number of cars are prohibited, leaving at least ten available.Let me think. If we have n cars, each car contributes 2 prohibited days. So the total number of prohibitions is 2n. Each day needs to have at most (n - 10) cars prohibited, because if on a day there are (n - 10) cars prohibited, then 10 are available. Wait, actually, the number of available cars on any day is n minus the number of cars prohibited on that day. So we need n - prohibited_per_day &gt;= 10, which means prohibited_per_day &lt;= n - 10 for each day.But since each day can have multiple cars prohibited, and we need the total prohibitions across all days to be 2n. Let&#39;s see, the sum of prohibited_per_day over all seven days is 2n. If each prohibited_per_day &lt;= n - 10, then the total sum would be &lt;= 7*(n - 10). But we know the total sum is 2n. Therefore:2n &lt;= 7*(n - 10)Let&#39;s solve this inequality:2n &lt;= 7n - 70Subtract 2n both sides:0 &lt;= 5n - 70Add 70:70 &lt;= 5nDivide by 5:14 &lt;= nSo n must be at least 14. But wait, is 14 possible? Let&#39;s check.If n=14, then total prohibitions are 28. Each day can have at most 14 - 10 = 4 prohibitions. So over 7 days, maximum total prohibitions would be 7*4=28. So exactly 28. That means each day must have exactly 4 prohibitions. So if we can arrange 14 cars such that each day has exactly 4 cars prohibited, then each day 10 cars are available, which meets the requirement. So this is possible.But how to arrange the cars? Each car is prohibited on two days. Each day has four prohibitions. So each day is covered by four cars. Since there are seven days, each day needs four cars. So total prohibitions are 7*4=28, and each car contributes two prohibitions, so number of cars is 28/2=14. Perfect. So 14 cars, each assigned two days, such that each day has exactly four cars prohibited.This is similar to a design in combinatorics, perhaps a block design. Specifically, a (v, k, λ) design where v=7 days, k=2 days per car, and each day is covered by r=4 cars. The necessary conditions for such a design are that:vr = bk, where b is the number of cars. Here, 7*4 = b*2 =&gt; 28 = 2b =&gt; b=14. So yes, this design exists if the necessary conditions are satisfied, which they are. And such a design is called a 2-regular, 4-uniform hypergraph on 7 vertices, or something like that. But in any case, since the arithmetic checks out, such a design is possible. Therefore, the minimal number of cars is 14.So the answer to part a) is 14.Now moving on to part b). The problem here is different. Now, each car can be assigned two days, and the police choose one of them as the non-driving day. The family needs to have each day every family member can drive independently. So each of the ten family members needs to have a car available each day. Wait, but the question says &quot;each day every family member can drive independently&quot;. So maybe each family member needs their own car each day? So each day, all ten family members must have access to a car. But the cars are shared, right? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing.Wait, let me read again: &quot;the family needs to buy so that each day every family member can drive independently, if the designation of non-driving days for cars goes sequentially?&quot;Hmm. So it&#39;s a family of ten people. They have multiple cars. For each car, when they acquire it, they name two days, and the police choose one of them as the non-driving day. The designation is done sequentially, meaning perhaps that when they buy a car, they specify the two days, the police pick one, and then that&#39;s fixed. Then the next car is bought, same process, etc. The family wants to ensure that every day, every family member can drive independently. So each family member needs a car each day, but cars can be shared? Or does each family member need their own car each day?Wait, the problem says &quot;each day every family member can drive independently&quot;. So maybe each family member needs to have access to a car every day, but they can share cars? But the problem is about the non-driving days. So if a car is prohibited on a day, then it can&#39;t be used by anyone that day. So the family must have enough cars such that, even with one day prohibited per car (chosen by police from two options), on any day, the number of available cars is at least ten. Because there are ten family members who each need to drive. So each day, they need at least ten cars available.But in this case, the prohibited days are assigned by the police. For each car, the family chooses two days, and the police pick one. The family wants to minimize the number of cars, but they have to ensure that regardless of the police&#39;s choices (i.e., for each car, whichever day the police pick as prohibited), the family still has at least ten cars available each day.So this is similar to a covering problem, but with uncertainty. The family has to choose, for each car, two days, such that no matter which day the police choose for each car, the total number of cars available on any day is at least ten.Alternatively, for each car, we can model it as the police choosing one day (from the two specified by the family) to prohibit. The family wants that, for all possible choices by the police (i.e., any combination of one day per car), on every day of the week, at least ten cars are not prohibited.This sounds like a combinatorial problem where the family has to choose pairs of days for each car, such that for every day d, the number of cars that do not have d in their pair is at least ten. Wait, no. Because if a car&#39;s pair includes d, then the police could choose the other day, leaving the car available on d. But if the car&#39;s pair does not include d, then the police have already chosen some other day, so the car is available on d. Wait, no.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. For each car, the family selects two days, say {d1, d2}. Then the police choose either d1 or d2 as the prohibited day. So the car is available on all days except the one chosen by the police. Therefore, for a given car, the police&#39;s choice removes one day from its availability.Therefore, for the family to ensure that on day d, there are at least ten cars available, they must ensure that for each day d, the number of cars that can potentially be available on d is at least ten, considering the worst-case police choices.But how can the family ensure that? For each day d, the number of cars that have d not in their prohibited pair must be at least ten. Because if a car&#39;s prohibited pair does not include d, then regardless of the police&#39;s choice, the car will be available on d. If a car&#39;s prohibited pair does include d, then the police could choose to prohibit d, making the car unavailable on d. Alternatively, they could choose the other day, making the car available on d. So the family cannot rely on cars that have d in their prohibited pair being available on d, because the police might choose to prohibit d.Therefore, to guarantee that ten cars are available on day d, the family must have at least ten cars whose prohibited pairs do not include d. Because those cars will definitely be available on d, no matter what the police choose.Therefore, for each day d, the number of cars that do not have d in their two prohibited days must be at least ten.So the problem reduces to: assign to each car a pair of days, such that for every day d, at least ten cars are assigned a pair that does not include d.We need to find the minimal number of cars n such that each day is excluded from the pairs of at least ten cars.Each car can exclude two days (since the pair is two days that the family chooses, and the police pick one). Wait, no: the family chooses two days for each car, and the police pick one. So each car&#39;s pair is two days, and the prohibited day is one of them. But for the purpose of guaranteeing availability on day d, the family needs cars that do not have d in their pair. Because those cars cannot be prohibited on d by the police. If a car&#39;s pair includes d, then the police could choose to prohibit d, making that car unavailable on d.Therefore, to have ten cars definitely available on d, the family needs at least ten cars whose pairs do not include d. So for each day d, the number of cars not having d in their pair is &gt;=10.But each car&#39;s pair is two days. Therefore, each car &quot;covers&quot; two days (i.e., cannot be relied upon for those two days). So the number of cars that do not cover day d is n minus the number of cars that include d in their pair. Let&#39;s denote by x_d the number of cars that include day d in their pair. Then the number of cars available on day d is n - x_d. We need n - x_d &gt;=10 for each d.But each car contributes to two days. Therefore, the total number of days covered by all cars is 2n. So sum_{d=1 to 7} x_d = 2n.But we have for each d, x_d &lt;= n -10. Therefore, sum_{d=1 to 7} x_d &lt;= 7(n -10).But sum x_d = 2n, so 2n &lt;=7(n -10).Solving:2n &lt;=7n -700 &lt;=5n -7070 &lt;=5n14 &lt;=nAgain, n &gt;=14. But wait, similar to part a). But in part a), the answer was 14. But here, is 14 sufficient?Wait, in part a), each car was prohibited on two days, fixed. Here, each car is prohibited on one day, chosen by police from two. But the family&#39;s requirement here is stronger in a way because they have to ensure that even in the worst case (police choosing the worst possible days), they still have ten cars available each day. However, in part a), the prohibited days were fixed, so they could design the cars&#39; prohibitions optimally. Here, they have to design the pairs such that regardless of the police&#39;s choices, they have enough cars. So it&#39;s a different constraint.But according to our previous logic, for each day d, the number of cars not having d in their pair must be at least ten. Let&#39;s denote that number as c_d = n - x_d &gt;=10. So x_d &lt;=n -10 for each day d. Sum over all days:sum x_d &lt;=7(n -10)But sum x_d =2n. So 2n &lt;=7n -70 =&gt; 5n &gt;=70 =&gt; n &gt;=14. So n=14 is possible if equality holds, i.e., if for each day d, x_d =n -10=14 -10=4. So each day is included in exactly four pairs. Then sum x_d=7*4=28=2n=2*14=28. Perfect. So similar to part a), if we can arrange that each day is included in exactly four pairs, then n=14 suffices. But how?In part a), we had a design where each car was assigned two days, and each day had exactly four cars prohibited. Here, each car is assigned two days, and each day is included in exactly four pairs. Then, regardless of police choices, the number of cars available on day d is n -x_d=14 -4=10. But wait, actually, if x_d=4, then the number of cars that have d in their pair is 4. So the number of cars that do not have d in their pair is 14 -4=10. Therefore, those ten cars will always be available on day d, no matter what the police choose. However, the remaining four cars (that include d in their pair) might or might not be available, depending on the police&#39;s choice. But since we need at least ten cars available, the family can rely on the ten cars that don&#39;t have d in their pair. The other four cars are a bonus if available, but not necessary.Therefore, if we can arrange the pairs such that each day is included in exactly four pairs, then n=14 is sufficient. But is such an arrangement possible?Yes, similar to part a). It&#39;s the same combinatorial design. Each car is a pair of days, each day is in four pairs, total pairs 14. This is equivalent to a 2-regular hypergraph with seven vertices (days), each vertex in four edges. The same design as in part a). Therefore, the same solution applies.But wait, but in part a), the answer was 14, and here it seems 14 is also possible. However, in part a), the two prohibited days are fixed, so you design the cars to cover each day exactly four times, so on each day, four cars are prohibited, leaving ten available. Here, the family assigns two days per car, and the police choose one. But by the same design, if each day is in four pairs, then the family can rely on ten cars (not in those pairs) being available. But wait, no. Wait, in this case, the cars not in the pairs are not the ones available. Wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify:If the family assigns each car two days (the pair), and the police choose one. The cars that do NOT have day d in their pair are definitely available on day d. The cars that have day d in their pair might be available or not, depending on the police&#39;s choice. Therefore, to guarantee ten cars available on day d, the family needs at least ten cars that do NOT have d in their pair. So if each day is included in four pairs, then the number of cars not including d is 14 -4=10. Therefore, those ten cars are definitely available, regardless of police choices. The other four cars may or may not be available, but ten are enough. Therefore, 14 cars suffice.But wait, in this case, the family has to assign the pairs such that each day is in exactly four pairs. So the same design as part a). Therefore, 14 cars would work. But the answer in part a) was 14, but here the answer might be different because the problem constraints are different.Wait, let&#39;s check again. In part a), each car is prohibited on two fixed days, so each day has four prohibited cars, hence ten available. In part b), each car is prohibited on one day (chosen by police from two), but the family needs to have ten cars definitely available each day, which can be achieved by having ten cars that don&#39;t have that day in their pair. The remaining four cars (with that day in their pair) could be prohibited or not, but ten are enough. Therefore, 14 cars suffice.But here&#39;s the catch: in part a), we needed to cover each day with four prohibitions. In part b), we need to cover each day with four pairs (i.e., four cars have that day in their pair), leading to ten cars definitely available. So the same number, 14, works. Therefore, is the answer also 14 for part b)? But the question says &quot;if the designation of non-driving days for cars goes sequentially&quot;. Does &quot;sequentially&quot; affect anything?Wait, the problem states: &quot;the designation of non-driving days for cars goes sequentially&quot;. So maybe when they buy the cars one by one, and for each car, they choose two days, the police choose one, and then they can base their next car&#39;s two days on the previous choices. So perhaps they can adaptively choose the pairs based on previous police choices. But the problem says &quot;the smallest number of cars the family needs to buy so that each day every family member can drive independently, if the designation of non-driving days for cars goes sequentially&quot;.Hmm. So perhaps it&#39;s not a worst-case scenario where the police choose the worst possible days, but rather, the family can choose the pairs adaptively as they buy cars, knowing the police&#39;s previous choices. Therefore, they can adjust their strategy based on how the police have prohibited previous cars. In that case, maybe they can use fewer cars.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the designation ... goes sequentially&quot;. So the process is: family buys a car, chooses two days, police choose one to prohibit. Then family buys another car, chooses two days (possibly based on the previous prohibition), police choose one, etc. The family wants to minimize the number of cars, using this sequential process, to ensure that every day, every family member can drive. So each day, ten cars must be available.But in this case, since the family can adapt their choices based on previous police decisions, they might be able to do better than 14. For example, if they can &quot;cover&quot; the days incrementally, ensuring that each day gets enough cars not prohibited on it. However, since the police are adversarial, they might try to maximize the number of cars prohibited on a particular day. So the family needs a strategy that, regardless of the police&#39;s choices, ensures that each day ends up with at least ten cars available.This is similar to a covering problem with adaptive choices. Let&#39;s think of it as a game: the family buys cars one by one. For each car, the family picks two days, and the police pick one to prohibit. The family wants to ensure that after all cars are bought, for every day, at least ten cars are not prohibited on that day.We need to find the minimal number of cars needed so that the family can force this condition, regardless of the police&#39;s choices.This is different from the previous problem where the police choose all prohibitions at once. Here, it&#39;s sequential, so the family can adapt. However, the police are also choosing prohibitions adversarially to try to maximize the number of cars prohibited on some days.To model this, we can think of it as a two-player game. The family wants to buy cars and assign two days per car, and the police prohibit one day per car, trying to minimize the number of available cars on some day. The family&#39;s goal is to ensure that every day has at least ten available cars.What&#39;s the minimal number of cars needed for the family to have a strategy that guarantees this, no matter how the police choose the prohibitions.This seems related to the concept of online algorithms or adversarial combinatorial optimization.Let me consider a strategy for the family. Suppose they want to ensure that each day has at least ten available cars. Each time they buy a car, they can choose two days, and the police will block one. The family wants to minimize the maximum number of prohibitions on any day.Alternatively, since each prohibition by the police reduces the available cars on that day by one, the family needs to ensure that no day gets more than n -10 prohibitions, where n is the number of cars. Because available cars on day d would be n - prohibitions_d &gt;=10 =&gt; prohibitions_d &lt;=n -10.So the family needs to keep prohibitions_d &lt;=n -10 for all d. Since the police are trying to maximize prohibitions_d, the family must choose pairs such that, regardless of which day the police prohibit, the maximum prohibitions_d across all days is &lt;=n -10.To minimize n, the family needs to distribute the prohibitions as evenly as possible. However, since the police are adversaries, they will try to put as many prohibitions as possible on the days that already have the most prohibitions.Therefore, the family&#39;s strategy should be to always assign the new car to the two days that currently have the least prohibitions. This way, even if the police choose to prohibit one of those days, the prohibitions are spread out more evenly.This is similar to the greedy algorithm for load balancing. If we model each prohibition as a load on a day, the family wants to minimize the maximum load. The police are adding to the load by choosing which day to prohibit. The family&#39;s choice of pairs is like choosing two possible machines (days) to assign a job (prohibition), and the adversary chooses one. The goal is to keep the maximum load as low as possible.In load balancing, if you have m jobs and n machines, and each job can go to one of two machines, the greedy algorithm (assign each job to the machine with the least current load) gives a maximum load of O(log m) if the assignments are adversarial. However, in our case, the number of cars (jobs) is variable, and we need the maximum load (prohibitions per day) to be &lt;=n -10, and we need to find the minimal n where such a strategy can ensure that.But this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s think in terms of upper bounds.Suppose the family uses a round-robin strategy, assigning each new car to the two days with the least prohibitions so far. Each time they buy a car, they pick the two days with the smallest number of prohibitions. The police then choose one of those two days to prohibit. The family&#39;s goal is to balance the prohibitions across days.If they can keep the prohibitions per day roughly equal, then the number of prohibitions per day would be about 2n/7 (since each car contributes one prohibition, total prohibitions is n, over seven days). But we need prohibitions_d &lt;=n -10. So n -10 &gt;=n/7 (approximately), but that&#39;s not possible unless n is very large. Wait, no. Wait, if prohibitions_d &lt;=n -10, and total prohibitions is n, then sum prohibitions_d =n. So the average prohibitions per day is n/7. But we need prohibitions_d &lt;=n -10 for all d. The minimal n where n -10 &gt;=n/7. Solving:n -10 &gt;=n/7Multiply by7:7n -70 &gt;=n6n &gt;=70n &gt;=70/6≈11.67. So n&gt;=12. But this is just the average. However, the police could concentrate prohibitions on a single day, so we need a different approach.Actually, the police will try to maximize the number of prohibitions on the day that currently has the most prohibitions. Therefore, the family must prevent any day from exceeding n -10 prohibitions.This is similar to the problem of dynamic load balancing where an adversary can increase the load on a machine by 1 each time, and you can choose two machines to spread the load. The goal is to keep the maximum load as low as possible.In such scenarios, it&#39;s known that with m machines, the maximum load after n insertions with two choices is O(log log m) with high probability. But in our case, the adversary is choosing which machine to increment, given two options. This is different.In the classic &quot;power of two choices&quot; model, when you have two options and place the load on the less loaded one, you get exponential improvement in balance. However, in our case, the adversary chooses the load, so it&#39;s a worst-case scenario.In the adversarial model with two choices, the maximum load can be bounded by O(√n log n)) or similar, but I&#39;m not sure. Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose the family wants to ensure that after buying n cars, no day has more than k prohibitions. The minimal k such that k &gt;=n -10 (since available cars per day is n -k &gt;=10 =&gt;k &lt;=n -10). But the police will try to maximize k. The family wants to choose pairs such that the police can&#39;t make k exceed n -10.What&#39;s the minimal n where the family can force k &lt;=n -10?This is equivalent to the family wanting to limit the maximum number of prohibitions on any day to n -10. Since total prohibitions is n, the average is n/7. So n -10 &gt;=n/7. As before, solving n -10 &gt;=n/7 gives n &gt;=14. Wait, same as before.Wait, but in this sequential case, can the family actually achieve k &lt;=n -10 with n=14? If n=14, then k=14 -10=4. So we need prohibitions per day &lt;=4. But total prohibitions is14, and 7*4=28, which is more than14. So that&#39;s impossible. Wait, total prohibitions is n=14. Each car contributes one prohibition. So sum prohibitions_d=14. If we need prohibitions_d &lt;=4 for each d, then sum prohibitions_d &lt;=7*4=28. But 14&lt;=28, which is true. But that doesn&#39;t help. The family wants prohibitions_d &lt;=4 for all d. But since sum prohibitions_d=14, it&#39;s possible only if each prohibitions_d=2. But 2*7=14. So if the family can distribute the prohibitions evenly as 2 per day, then n=14. But the police are adversaries trying to maximize prohibitions_d.Wait, no. If the family has a strategy to force the police to spread out the prohibitions, then they can achieve it. But since the police are adversaries, they will try to put as many prohibitions as possible on a single day. For example, if the family assigns each new car to days 1 and 2, the police can choose to prohibit day1 every time, leading to all prohibitions on day1.Therefore, the family must choose pairs in such a way that the police cannot concentrate prohibitions. The way to do this is to ensure that each new car is assigned to two days that currently have the least prohibitions. This is the greedy algorithm.Let&#39;s try to model this. Suppose the family uses the following strategy: each time they buy a new car, they select the two days with the current lowest number of prohibitions. The police then choose one of those two days to prohibit. The police will choose the day that has the higher current prohibitions among the two, to try to maximize the maximum.But even so, the family can balance the prohibitions.For example, let&#39;s say initially all days have 0 prohibitions. The first car: family picks any two days, say day1 and day2. Police choose one, say day1. Now day1 has1, others 0. Second car: family picks two days with least prohibitions, which are day2 and day3. Police choose day2. Now day1=1, day2=1. Third car: family picks day3 and day4. Police choose day3. Day3=1. Fourth car: family picks day4 and day5. Police choose day4. Day4=1. Fifth car: family picks day5 and day6. Police choose day5. Day5=1. Sixth car: family picks day6 and day7. Police choose day6. Day6=1. Seventh car: family picks day7 and day1 (both have 0 prohibitions except day1=1). Police choose day7. Now day7=1.Now all days have1 except day1=1. Eighth car: family picks any two days, say day1 and day2 (both have1). Police choose day1. Day1=2. Ninth car: family picks day2 and day3 (both have1). Police choose day2. Day2=2. Tenth car: family picks day3 and day4 (both have1). Police choose day3. Day3=2. Eleventh car: family picks day4 and day5 (both have1). Police choose day4. Day4=2. Twelfth car: family picks day5 and day6 (both have1). Police choose day5. Day5=2. Thirteenth car: family picks day6 and day7 (both have1). Police choose day6. Day6=2. Fourteenth car: family picks day7 and day1 (day7=1, day1=2). Police choose day7. Day7=2.Now after 14 cars, each day has2 prohibitions. So prohibitions_d=2 for all d. Thus, available cars per day=14-2=12 &gt;=10. So actually, the family only needed 14 cars to get 12 available per day. But since they only need 10, maybe fewer cars are needed.Wait, but in this case, after 14 cars, they have 12 available per day. But they need only 10. So perhaps they can stop earlier. Let&#39;s see. If after n cars, the maximum prohibitions_d is k, then available cars per day is n -k. We need n -k &gt;=10. So k &lt;=n -10.If the family can ensure that after n cars, k &lt;=n -10. What&#39;s the minimal n?For example, when n=14, k=2 &lt;=14 -10=4. So yes, 14 cars suffice. But we might need fewer. Let&#39;s see.Suppose n=13. Then we need k &lt;=3. Can the family ensure that after 13 cars, no day has more than3 prohibitions?If they follow the strategy above, after 7 cars, each day has1. Then car8: day1 and day2, police choose one. Suppose they pick day1. Day1=2. Car9: day2 and day3, police choose day2. Day2=2. Car10: day3 and day4, police choose day3. Day3=2. Car11: day4 and day5, police choose day4. Day4=2. Car12: day5 and day6, police choose day5. Day5=2. Car13: day6 and day7, police choose day6. Day6=2. So after13 cars, day1=2, days2-6=2, day7=1. So max prohibitions_d=2 &lt;=13-10=3. So available cars=13-2=11&gt;=10. So n=13 works.Wait, but in this case, after13 cars, the max prohibitions is2, which is &lt;=3=13-10. So available cars per day=11&gt;=10. So n=13 is sufficient.But can we go lower?n=12. We need k &lt;=12-10=2. So can the family ensure that after12 cars, no day has more than2 prohibitions?Following the strategy:After7 cars, each day has1. Car8: day1 and day2, police choose day1. Day1=2. Car9: day2 and day3, police choose day2. Day2=2. Car10: day3 and day4, police choose day3. Day3=2. Car11: day4 and day5, police choose day4. Day4=2. Car12: day5 and day6, police choose day5. Day5=2. Now after12 cars, day1=2, day2=2, day3=2, day4=2, day5=2, day6=1, day7=1. Max prohibitions=2. So available cars=12-2=10. Exactly ten. So n=12 works.Wait, but day6 and day7 have1 prohibition each. So available cars on day6=12-1=11, day7=12-1=11, other days=10. So all days have &gt;=10 available cars. Therefore, n=12 suffices.But can we go even lower?n=11. Need k &lt;=11-10=1. So need all days to have at most1 prohibition. After7 cars, each day has1. Car8: family picks two days, say day1 and day2. Police choose one, say day1. Now day1=2. Which exceeds k=1. Therefore, n=11 is impossible.Wait, after7 cars, each day has1. If the family buys an 8th car and assigns it to two days, the police can choose one to increment, leading to a day with2 prohibitions. Thus, for n=11, even if we stop at11 cars, but by the time we reach8 cars, some day has2 prohibitions. Therefore, n=11 is insufficient.Similarly, n=12: after12 cars, the max prohibitions=2, which is allowed since 12-2=10. Therefore, n=12 works.But wait, let&#39;s verify with the strategy. After7 cars, each day has1. Then cars8-12: each car is assigned to two days with the least prohibitions (which are the remaining days with1). Police choose one, increasing it to2. After car8: one day has2. Car9: another day increased to2. Car10: another day to2. Car11: another day to2. Car12: another day to2. But wait, how many days can we increase to2? There are7 days. After7 cars, all have1. Then cars8-12: each car increases one day from1 to2. So after12 cars, five days have2 prohibitions, and two days have1. So the max prohibitions is2. Therefore, available cars on days with2 prohibitions:12-2=10. On days with1 prohibition:12-1=11. So yes, all days have at least10 available cars. Therefore, n=12 suffices.But the question is, can the family actually force this? Because if the police try to maximize the prohibitions on a single day, can the family prevent that?Wait, in our strategy, the family assigns each new car to two days with the least prohibitions. The police then choose one of those two days to prohibit. If the family always picks the two days with the smallest prohibitions, the police have to choose between them. The police will choose the one that causes the maximum increase in the maximum prohibitions. But if the two days have the same prohibitions, the police can&#39;t increase the max beyond that.For example, after7 cars, all days have1. Car8: family picks day1 and day2. Police choose day1. Day1=2. Car9: family picks day2 and day3 (both have1). Police choose day2. Day2=2. Car10: family picks day3 and day4. Police choose day3. Day3=2. Car11: family picks day4 and day5. Police choose day4. Day4=2. Car12: family picks day5 and day6. Police choose day5. Day5=2. Now day1=2, day2=2, day3=2, day4=2, day5=2, day6=1, day7=1. So five days have2, two days have1. Available cars on day1:12-2=10, on day6:12-1=11. So it works.However, if the police try to be more adversarial, could they make the family have more prohibitions on a day? For example, after car8, day1=2. Car9: family picks day2 and day3. Police choose day2. Day2=2. Car10: family picks day3 and day4. Police choose day3. Day3=2. Car11: family picks day4 and day5. Police choose day4. Day4=2. Car12: family picks day5 and day6. Police choose day5. Day5=2. So same as before. The police can&#39;t make it worse because the family is forcing them to choose between two days that both have low prohibitions.Therefore, with n=12, the family can ensure that each day has at most2 prohibitions, thus having at least12-2=10 cars available. Therefore, the minimal number is12.But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a scenario where even with this strategy, the police could force a higher number.Suppose after7 cars, all days have1. Car8: family picks day1 and day2. Police choose day1. Day1=2. Car9: family picks day2 and day3. Police choose day2. Day2=2. Car10: family picks day3 and day4. Police choose day3. Day3=2. Car11: family picks day4 and day5. Police choose day4. Day4=2. Car12: family picks day5 and day6. Police choose day5. Day5=2. Now day6 and day7 still have1. So available cars on day1:12-2=10, day5:10, day6:11, day7:11. All good.Alternatively, after car8, day1=2. Car9: family could pick day1 and day2. Police choose day1 again, making day1=3. But wait, the family&#39;s strategy is to pick the two days with least prohibitions. After car8, day1 has2, other days have1. So the two days with least prohibitions are day2 and day3 (each has1). So the family picks day2 and day3 for car9. Police can&#39;t pick day1 again. Therefore, the police have to choose between day2 and day3, each with1. They choose day2. Day2=2. Car10: family picks day3 and day4. Police choose day3. Day3=2. Car11: family picks day4 and day5. Police choose day4. Day4=2. Car12: family picks day5 and day6. Police choose day5. Day5=2. So same as before.Therefore, the police cannot force a day to have more than2 prohibitions if the family follows the strategy of always assigning the new car to the two days with the least prohibitions. Therefore, n=12 is sufficient.But let&#39;s check for n=11. Suppose the family tries to do the same. After7 cars, all days have1. Car8: family picks day1 and day2. Police choose day1. Day1=2. Car9: family picks day2 and day3. Police choose day2. Day2=2. Car10: family picks day3 and day4. Police choose day3. Day3=2. Car11: family picks day4 and day5. Police choose day4. Day4=2. Now we have n=11 cars. Days1-4 have2 prohibitions, days5-7 have1. Available cars on day1:11-2=9 &lt;10. So insufficient. Therefore, n=11 is not enough.Therefore, the minimal number is12.&lt;/think&gt;a) The family needs to cover each day with exactly four prohibited cars, ensuring ten are available. Using a combinatorial design where each car blocks two days and each day is blocked by four cars, the minimal number is (boxed{14}).b) By adaptively assigning cars to two days with the least prohibitions and ensuring no day exceeds two prohibitions after 12 cars, the family guarantees ten available daily. Thus, the minimal number is (boxed{12}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out part a) first. The problem says that in Mexico City, each private car has two days of the week when it can&#39;t be driven. The family needs at least ten cars available every day. We need to find the smallest number of cars the family can manage with, given they can choose the prohibited days themselves.Hmm, so each car is restricted on two days, but available on the other five days. The family needs ten cars available each day. So, we need to cover all seven days of the week, ensuring that on any given day, at least ten cars are not restricted. Since each car can cover five days, we need to arrange these cars such that their restricted days are spread out in a way that every day has enough cars available.This feels like a covering problem. Maybe similar to the pigeonhole principle? Let&#39;s think about how many cars we need. Each car can be used on five days, so if we have n cars, each contributing five available days, the total available days would be 5n. But we need at least ten cars each day, and there are seven days. So total required available days is 10*7=70. Therefore, 5n ≥ 70, so n ≥ 14. But this is a lower bound. However, this assumes that the available days are perfectly distributed, which might not be possible because each car&#39;s availability is fixed.Wait, but maybe this is tight? Let me check. If we have 14 cars, each available 5 days, that&#39;s 70 available days, exactly matching the requirement. So if we can arrange the cars such that each day has exactly ten cars available, that would work. But is this possible?We need to model this as a design problem. For each day, the number of cars that have that day as one of their available days must be at least ten. Since each car has five available days, each car can be assigned to five days. So, we need to cover each day with ten cars. Each car is assigned to five days. So, we need to cover seven days with 14 cars, each covering five days, such that each day is covered ten times. Let me check the total coverage: 14 cars * 5 days = 70, which is 10 per day * 7 days. Perfect. So this is a question of existence of such a design.This is similar to a combinatorial design where each element (day) is covered a certain number of times. Here, we need each day to be covered exactly ten times by the cars&#39; available days. Since each car is a 5-element subset (available days), and we need a collection of 14 such subsets where each day is in exactly ten subsets. This is called a (7,5,10) design? Wait, not exactly. The parameters would be v=7 (days), k=5 (available days per car), and each day is in r=10 subsets. But in design theory, there are necessary conditions. The number of blocks (cars) is b=14. The necessary conditions for a design are that b*k = v*r. Here, 14*5 = 7*10, which is 70=70. So that&#39;s satisfied. Also, the other condition is that λ(v-1 choose k-1) = r(k-1 choose something). Wait, maybe this is a Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD), but with repeated blocks allowed? Because in BIBD, each pair of elements appears in exactly λ blocks, but here we might not have that constraint.Alternatively, since the problem allows the prohibited days (and hence available days) to be chosen by the family, perhaps they can repeat the same prohibited days for multiple cars. So maybe it&#39;s possible to have multiple cars with the same two prohibited days. Then, each car&#39;s available days are the other five days. If we have two prohibited days, say Monday and Tuesday, then a car with those prohibited days is available on the other five days. If we have multiple such cars, they all contribute to covering those five days.Therefore, to cover each day with ten cars, we need to figure out how many cars to assign to each pair of prohibited days such that each day is excluded by enough cars. Wait, each day is part of several prohibited pairs. For a given day, say Monday, how many pairs include Monday? There are six other days, so Monday can be paired with Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So six different pairs that include Monday. Each such pair, if assigned to some cars, would mean those cars are prohibited on Monday and another day.But we need to ensure that on Monday, the number of cars available is ten. The total number of cars not prohibited on Monday is the total number of cars minus the number of cars prohibited on Monday. Let me denote the number of cars with prohibited days on Monday and another day as x_{Mon, other}. For each day paired with Monday, the number of cars assigned to that pair. So, total cars prohibited on Monday would be the sum of x_{Mon, Tue} + x_{Mon, Wed} + ... + x_{Mon, Sun} }, which is six terms. Therefore, the number of cars available on Monday is total cars - sum_{day≠Mon} x_{Mon, day} = 10.Similarly, this applies to every day. So for each day, the number of cars not prohibited on that day must be at least ten. But since we can choose the prohibited days, perhaps we can set it up such that exactly ten cars are available each day. Then total cars would be 14, as per the lower bound.So the problem reduces to solving the system where for each day, the number of cars prohibited on that day is n - 10, where n is the total number of cars. But each car is prohibited on two days, so the total number of prohibitions is 2n. But the total number of prohibitions is also the sum over all days of the number of cars prohibited on that day. For each day, number of cars prohibited is n - 10. Since there are seven days, total prohibitions would be 7(n - 10). Therefore, 2n = 7(n - 10). Solving this equation:2n = 7n - 70-5n = -70n = 14So this gives n = 14. Therefore, if the system is consistent, then 14 cars would work. And since 14 is the lower bound from the total available days calculation, this is achievable. Therefore, the minimal number is 14.But wait, let&#39;s check this. If each day has n - 10 cars prohibited, and n=14, then each day has 14 - 10 = 4 cars prohibited. So each day, 4 cars are prohibited. But each car is prohibited on two days. So total prohibitions would be 14*2=28. But 7 days * 4 prohibitions per day = 28. So that matches. Therefore, such a system is possible. So we need to assign 4 prohibitions per day, spread over the cars in such a way that each car is assigned two prohibitions. So this is a 2-regular hypergraph or something?Alternatively, think of it as a 7-node graph where each node (day) has 4 edges (prohibitions), and each edge (prohibition pair) is connected to two nodes. But each edge can be used multiple times (since multiple cars can have the same prohibited days). Wait, but we need each car to correspond to an edge (a pair of prohibited days). So each edge can have multiple cars assigned to it. The number of cars assigned to each edge is x_{i,j}, the number of cars prohibited on days i and j.Then, for each node (day), the sum of x_{i,j} over all edges containing the node is equal to 4 (since each day has 4 prohibitions). Since there are 7 nodes, each with degree 4 in terms of the sum of x_{i,j}, and each edge is counted in two nodes. So the total sum over all edges of x_{i,j} multiplied by 2 is equal to 7*4=28. Therefore, the total sum over all edges is 14, which is equal to the number of cars. Since each car corresponds to an edge (a pair of prohibited days), the total number of cars is the sum over all edges of x_{i,j}, which is 14. Therefore, each x_{i,j} can be 1 or more, but since we need the minimal number of cars, perhaps we can just use each edge once? But if x_{i,j} is the number of cars assigned to that edge, then with 14 cars, we need to distribute 14 cars into edges such that each node has 4 cars (edges) connected to it.But there are C(7,2)=21 possible edges. We need to choose 14 edges (allowing repetition?) such that each node has degree 4. But if we allow multiple cars on the same edge, that is, multiple cars prohibited on the same two days, then we can model this as an integer solution. However, to minimize the number of cars, we need to maximize the number of cars per edge? Wait, no. To minimize the number of cars, we need to maximize the number of prohibitions per car. Wait, no, each car is already assigned two prohibitions. So actually, each car is assigned to one edge. So the total number of cars is equal to the number of edges multiplied by the number of cars per edge. But in this case, since we need 14 cars, we need to have 14 edges, but each edge can be used multiple times.But since each edge is a pair of days, and each use of an edge corresponds to a car prohibited on those two days. So if we have x_{i,j} cars prohibited on days i and j, then the sum over all x_{i,j} is 14. For each day i, the sum over all x_{i,j} (j ≠ i) is 4. So we need to find non-negative integers x_{i,j} such that for each i, sum_{j≠i} x_{i,j} =4, and sum_{i&lt;j} x_{i,j} =14.This is a system of equations. Let me see if such a solution exists. For example, if we can find a symmetric distribution where each edge is used 0 or 1 times, but given that each node needs to have 4 edges, and there are 21 possible edges, but we need to select 14 edges such that each node has exactly 4 edges. However, in graph terms, a 4-regular graph on 7 nodes would have (7*4)/2=14 edges. So yes, a 4-regular graph with 7 nodes has exactly 14 edges. Therefore, if such a graph exists, then we can assign each car to an edge in the graph, meaning each car is prohibited on two days connected by an edge, and each day has exactly four cars prohibited, which translates to 14 cars total. Since a 4-regular graph on 7 nodes exists (for example, each node connected to the next four nodes in a circular fashion), then this is feasible. Therefore, the answer is 14.So part a) answer is 14.Now moving on to part b). The problem states: In Mexico City, each private car has one day when it cannot leave, but the family can name two days for each car, and the police choose one of them as the prohibited day. The family has ten people, and they need each day every family member can drive independently. The designation of non-driving days goes sequentially. We need the smallest number of cars.So each car can have two possible prohibited days, and the police choose one. The family wants to ensure that no matter what choices the police make, every family member can drive each day. Since the designation is sequential, maybe they can adaptively choose which cars to use based on previous designations? Or is it that the police choose the prohibited days for each car one after another, and the family has to assign the two days for each car in sequence, possibly depending on previous outcomes?Wait, the problem says: &quot;the designation of non-driving days for cars goes sequentially.&quot; So perhaps they buy a car, name two days, the police choose one, then they buy the next car, name two days (possibly depending on the previous choice), etc. So they can adaptively choose the two days for each subsequent car based on how the police have assigned previous prohibited days. The goal is to have, after all cars are assigned, that every day every family member can drive independently. So each of the ten family members needs to have a car available each day, but the cars available depend on the police&#39;s choices.Wait, actually, the problem states: &quot;each day every family member can drive independently.&quot; So perhaps each family member needs their own car each day, and the availability of the cars depends on the prohibited days. Since the prohibited days are chosen by the police from the two options provided by the family for each car, the family needs to ensure that regardless of the police&#39;s choices, there are enough cars available each day for all ten family members.Therefore, it&#39;s a covering problem where for each day, the number of cars available on that day must be at least ten, considering that each car is available unless the police chose that day as its prohibited day. Since the family can choose two days for each car, and the police pick one, the family&#39;s goal is to choose the two days for each car in such a way that, no matter which day the police pick for each car, every day has at least ten available cars.This is similar to a two-stage robust optimization problem. The family selects pairs of days for each car, and the adversary (police) selects one day from each pair to minimize the number of available cars on any day. The family wants to choose the pairs such that, even in the worst case, every day has at least ten cars available.Alternatively, it&#39;s like the family is creating a covering code: each car covers five days (if the prohibited day is one of two, then the available days are six minus one? Wait, no. Wait, each car has two possible prohibited days. So depending on the police&#39;s choice, the car is prohibited on one day, available the other six. So the available days are six days, but the prohibited day is either of the two named days. Therefore, for each car, the available days are all days except one, which is either day A or day B. So the family can choose two days for each car, and then the car will be available on the other five days (since one of the two is prohibited). Wait, no. Wait, if the family names two days, say Monday and Tuesday, then the police choose either Monday or Tuesday as the prohibited day. Therefore, the car is prohibited on one day (either Monday or Tuesday) and available on the other six days. So the available days are six days, not five. Wait, that contradicts the original problem statement?Wait, part a) said two prohibited days, but part b) says one prohibited day, but the family can name two days, one of which is chosen. So in part b), each car has one prohibited day, but the family can choose two options, and the police pick one. Therefore, the prohibited day is one of two possibilities. Therefore, the available days are all days except one, which is either day A or day B. So the available days are six days for each car, depending on the police&#39;s choice.But the family needs to have, for each day, every family member can drive independently. There are ten family members, so each day, they need ten cars available. Therefore, regardless of the police&#39;s choices, for each day, the number of cars available on that day must be at least ten.Therefore, the problem reduces to: select a set of cars, each associated with two days (the possible prohibited days), such that for every day d, the number of cars not having d as their prohibited day (in the police&#39;s choice) is at least ten. The challenge is that the police can choose, for each car, which of the two days to prohibit, in a way that minimizes the available cars on some day. The family needs to choose the cars&#39; two days such that, even in the worst case (police choosing prohibited days to minimize availability), every day still has at least ten cars available.Therefore, we need that for each day d, the number of cars where d is not in their two prohibited days plus the number of cars where d is one of their two prohibited days but the police chose the other day, is at least ten.Alternatively, let&#39;s denote for each day d, let C_d be the set of cars that do not have d as one of their two prohibited days. These cars will always be available on day d, regardless of the police&#39;s choice. Then, for cars that have d as one of their prohibited days, the police can choose to prohibit d or the other day. If the police choose to prohibit the other day, then the car is available on d. If the police choose to prohibit d, then the car is not available on d. Therefore, the family cannot control that; the police can choose the worst-case scenario. Therefore, to guarantee that on day d, there are at least ten cars available, the number of cars in C_d plus the minimal number of cars available from the cars that have d as a possible prohibited day must be at least ten.But since the police can choose to prohibit as many cars as possible on day d, they would choose, for each car that includes d as a prohibited day, to prohibit d. Therefore, the number of available cars on day d is |C_d| + (number of cars with d as a possible prohibited day but police chose the other day). But since the police will choose to prohibit d whenever possible, the available cars on day d would be |C_d| + 0, because the police would set all cars that have d as a prohibited day to be prohibited on d. Wait, no. Wait, each car that has d as a prohibited day can have either d or another day prohibited. The police will choose for each such car whether to prohibit d or the other day. To minimize the available cars on day d, the police would choose to prohibit d for as many cars as possible. However, for each car, the police can only choose one of the two prohibited days. Therefore, for each car that has d as one of its two prohibited days, the police can choose to prohibit d or the other day. To minimize the number of available cars on day d, the police would choose to prohibit d for all such cars. Therefore, the number of available cars on day d is equal to the number of cars not having d as a prohibited day (C_d) plus the number of cars having d as a prohibited day where the police chose the other day. But since the police are trying to minimize, they would choose to prohibit d on all cars where d is a prohibited day. Therefore, the available cars on day d would be |C_d|.Wait, no. Wait, if a car has prohibited days {d, e}, then the police can choose either d or e. If the police choose d, then the car is prohibited on d; if they choose e, the car is available on d. Therefore, to minimize the number of cars available on d, the police would choose d as the prohibited day for all cars that include d as one of their two prohibited days. Therefore, those cars would be prohibited on d, and the only cars available on d are those that do not have d as a prohibited day at all (i.e., C_d). Therefore, the number of available cars on day d is |C_d|.But the family needs |C_d| ≥ 10 for each day d. Therefore, the family must ensure that for every day d, there are at least ten cars that do not have d as one of their two prohibited days. Therefore, each car can cover two prohibited days, but for each day d, at least ten cars must have neither of their prohibited days as d.This seems similar to part a), but instead of two fixed prohibited days, here we have two possible prohibited days, but the family must choose the pairs such that every day is excluded (not prohibited) by at least ten cars. So, for each day d, the number of cars that do not have d in their two prohibited days is at least ten.Each car can be associated with a pair of days (the two days they submitted as possible prohibited days). The cars that do not have d in their pair are the ones that contribute to C_d. The family needs |C_d| ≥ 10 for all d.So how many cars do we need? Each car can contribute to C_d for all days not in its pair. So if a car&#39;s prohibited pair is {e, f}, then it contributes to C_d for all d ≠ e, f. Therefore, each car covers 5 days (7 - 2) in terms of contributing to their C_d. Wait, no. If a car has prohibited days {e, f}, then it is in C_d for all d except e and f. Therefore, each car is in 5 of the C_d sets. Therefore, the total coverage across all C_d is 5n, where n is the number of cars. Each C_d needs to be at least 10, so total coverage needed is 7*10=70. Therefore, 5n ≥ 70 ⇒ n ≥ 14. Again, similar to part a). But in part a), we had 14 cars, but here it&#39;s different because here, the police choose one prohibited day per car, but the family needs to ensure that regardless of the choices, each day has at least ten cars available. However, according to the previous logic, if we set |C_d| ≥ 10 for each d, then regardless of the police&#39;s choices, the available cars on day d would be at least |C_d|, which is ≥10. Therefore, to achieve |C_d| ≥10 for each d, the minimal number of cars is 14, same as part a). But is this correct?Wait, but in part a), the prohibited days were fixed, so each car was prohibited on two days, available on five. Here, in part b), each car is prohibited on one day (chosen by police from two options), so available on six days. But the family can choose the two options such that each car&#39;s two prohibited days are arranged to maximize coverage. However, the requirement here is stronger: not only do we need that on each day, there are enough cars available (ten), but we also have to consider that the police might choose prohibited days adversarially. However, according to the previous reasoning, if we ensure that for each day, there are at least ten cars that cannot be prohibited on that day (i.e., their prohibited days don&#39;t include that day), then regardless of the police&#39;s choices, those ten cars will always be available. Therefore, the family can ensure ten cars per day by having ten cars that are never prohibited on that day. Therefore, the problem reduces to covering each day with at least ten cars that do not have that day as a prohibited day. Each car can cover five days (since it has two prohibited days). Therefore, the same calculation applies: 7*10 = 70 total required coverage, each car provides 5 coverage, so 14 cars.But wait, in part a), the answer was 14, but here the problem seems different. Wait, in part a), two prohibited days fixed, here in part b), one prohibited day chosen from two options. However, in part b), if the family uses the same strategy as in part a), i.e., arrange 14 cars such that each day is excluded from two prohibited days of 4 cars (as in part a)), then for each day, there are 14 - 4 = 10 cars not prohibited on that day. But in part b), the prohibited days are chosen by the police from two options. If the family uses the same setup, where each car is assigned two prohibited days, and for each day, exactly 4 cars have that day as one of their prohibited days, then the police could choose, for each of those 4 cars, to prohibit that day, thereby reducing the available cars on that day to 14 - 4 = 10. But actually, in part b), the available cars would be 14 - number of cars prohibited on that day. But if the family uses the same 14 cars with two prohibited days each, arranged so that each day is prohibited by 4 cars, then if the police choose to prohibit those 4 cars on that day, the available cars would be 14 - 4 = 10. Therefore, this would satisfy the requirement. Therefore, the minimal number of cars is also 14.But is there a difference between part a) and part b)? In part a), the prohibited days are fixed, so each car is definitely available on five days. In part b), the prohibited days are flexible, but the family can choose two options, and the police choose one. However, if the family uses the same configuration as in part a), then even if the police choose the worst-case prohibited days, they can only prohibit 4 cars per day, resulting in 10 available cars. Therefore, 14 cars suffice for part b) as well. But the answer might be different. Wait, maybe in part a), the answer is 14, but in part b), it&#39;s lower? Wait, let&#39;s think again.In part a), each car contributes five available days. Total needed 70, so 14 cars. In part b), each car, depending on police&#39;s choice, is available on six days (since prohibited on one of two days). Therefore, each car can potentially cover more days. But the problem is that the police can choose the prohibited days adversarially. However, the family&#39;s goal is to choose the pairs of prohibited days such that even in the worst case, each day has ten available cars.But if we use 14 cars as in part a), each car assigned two prohibited days such that each day is prohibited by four cars. Then, even if the police choose to prohibit four cars on each day, we have ten available. So that works.But maybe we can do better in part b)? Because each car is available on six days instead of five. So perhaps fewer cars are needed?Wait, let&#39;s recast the problem. For part b), each car can be prohibited on one day, chosen by the police from two options. The family needs to ensure that, regardless of the police&#39;s choices, each day has at least ten cars available. The family can choose the two prohibited days for each car.Each car can be thought of as covering six days (since it&#39;s available on six days, depending on the police&#39;s choice). However, the police will choose the prohibited day to minimize coverage. Therefore, the family must choose the two prohibited days for each car such that, even if the police choose the worst possible prohibited days, every day is still covered by at least ten cars.This is similar to a covering problem with uncertainty. The family needs to select a set of cars (each with two prohibited days) such that for any possible choice of one prohibited day per car (from their two), every day has at least ten cars available.To model this, let&#39;s denote x_i as the number of cars assigned with prohibited days on day i. Wait, no. Each car is assigned two prohibited days, say a_i and b_i. The police choose either a_i or b_i. The family wants that for every day d, the number of cars not having d as their prohibited day (either a_i or b_i) is at least ten, regardless of the police&#39;s choices.But this is equivalent to saying that for each day d, the number of cars where d is not in {a_i, b_i} plus the number of cars where d is in {a_i, b_i} but the police chose the other day, is at least ten. But since the police can choose the worst case, we have to assume that for all cars where d is in {a_i, b_i}, the police choose to prohibit d. Therefore, the available cars on day d are the number of cars where d is not in {a_i, b_i}.Therefore, this reduces to the same problem as part a): the family needs at least ten cars that do not have d as one of their two prohibited days. Hence, same as part a), the minimal number is 14.But this seems contradictory, because in part b), each car can be used more flexibly, but the police are adversarial. However, the reduction shows that it&#39;s equivalent. Therefore, the answer is also 14.But I need to check if this is correct. Suppose we have 14 cars, each assigned two prohibited days such that each day is a prohibited day in exactly four cars. Then, for each day, there are 14 - 4 = 10 cars not prohibited on that day, which would be available regardless of the police&#39;s choices. Because even if the police choose to prohibit those four cars on that day, the other ten cars are not prohibited there. Therefore, available cars are ten. So yes, 14 cars suffice.But could we use fewer cars? Let&#39;s suppose we use 13 cars. Then, each car can cover five days (if we think in terms of coverage), but wait, in part b), each car is available on six days (if prohibited on one day). However, the police can choose which day to prohibit. If we use 13 cars, the total coverage would be 13*6 = 78. But since the police choose prohibited days to minimize coverage, they would try to maximize the overlap. However, the family needs each day to be covered by at least ten cars. If we have 13 cars, each contributing six available days, but adversarially chosen prohibited days, the total coverage is 13*6=78, but distributed adversarially. The minimum coverage would be floor(78/7) = 11.14, so potentially one day could have 11 cars and others 11 or 12. But the family needs at least ten cars per day. But 11 is more than ten, so maybe 13 cars suffice? Wait, no. The total coverage is 78, but if the police distribute the prohibited days to minimize the minimum coverage, they would try to make the coverage as uneven as possible.But how?Alternatively, think of it as a game. The family picks the cars with pairs of prohibited days. The police then choose one prohibited day per car to minimize the number of available cars on some day. The family wants to maximize the minimum number of available cars over all days, regardless of the police&#39;s choices.This is similar to a 2-player game. The family&#39;s goal is to ensure that for any police strategy, every day has at least ten available cars.To model this, we can use linear programming duality or some combinatorial argument. But maybe there&#39;s a better way.Suppose the family uses n cars. For each car, they choose two prohibited days. Let’s denote that the number of cars with prohibited days including day d is y_d. Then, the number of cars available on day d is n - y_d + z_d, where z_d is the number of cars where day d is a prohibited day but the police chose the other day. But since the police will choose to minimize, they will set z_d = 0. Wait, no. For each car that includes day d as a prohibited day, the police can choose to prohibit d or the other day. If they choose to prohibit d, then the car is unavailable on d; if they choose the other day, the car is available on d. To minimize the available cars on d, the police will choose to prohibit d for all cars that include d. Therefore, the number of available cars on d is n - y_d. Therefore, the family needs n - y_d ≥ 10 for all d. Therefore, y_d ≤ n - 10 for all d.But each car contributes to two y_d&#39;s (the two prohibited days). Therefore, the total sum over all y_d is 2n. So sum_{d=1}^7 y_d = 2n. But since y_d ≤ n - 10 for each d, then sum_{d=1}^7 y_d ≤ 7(n - 10). Therefore:2n ≤ 7(n - 10)2n ≤ 7n - 70-5n ≤ -70n ≥ 14Therefore, we derive that n must be at least 14. Therefore, 14 is the minimal number of cars. Hence, the answer is 14 for part b) as well.But wait, this is the same as part a). The problem says &quot;the designation of non-driving days for cars goes sequentially&quot;. Does this sequentiality allow any advantage? For example, if the family can choose the two prohibited days for each subsequent car based on the police&#39;s previous choices, can they use fewer cars?But the problem states that the designation goes sequentially. So maybe the family buys a car, names two days, the police choose one, then the family buys the next car, names two days considering the previous choice, etc. In this case, the family can adaptively choose the prohibited days based on previous outcomes. However, the police&#39;s choices are adversarial. Therefore, the family must plan for the worst-case scenario, where the police choose prohibited days in a way that maximizes the number of cars needed.But from the earlier analysis, even with adaptivity, the lower bound is still 14, since the inequality 2n ≤ 7(n - 10) must hold regardless of the sequence. Therefore, even with adaptivity, the family cannot reduce the number of cars below 14, because otherwise the inequality would be violated.Therefore, the minimal number of cars for part b) is also 14.But the problem says &quot;each day every family member can drive independently&quot;. There are ten family members, so they need ten cars each day. So each day needs at least ten available cars. As we saw, with 14 cars, and each day prohibited by at most four cars, we have ten available. Therefore, the answer is 14.But maybe I&#39;m missing something. Let me check an example.Suppose we have 14 cars. For each day, four cars have that day as one of their prohibited days. Therefore, no matter how the police choose, those four cars could be prohibited on that day, leaving ten cars available. Yes, that works. So same as part a), the answer is 14.But the question is, in part b), can we exploit the fact that the prohibited days are chosen one of two, and maybe use some cars to cover multiple days through the adaptive process? For example, if we have a car that can cover two different days depending on the police&#39;s choice, maybe we can overlap coverage.But according to the previous analysis, even with adaptivity, the lower bound is still 14. Because the total number of prohibitions is 2n (each car has two prohibited days), but the police will assign them in a way that each day has at least n - 10 prohibitions. Wait, no. Wait, the police are choosing one prohibited day per car, so the total number of prohibitions is n (each car has one prohibited day). Therefore, the total number of prohibitions is n. But the family wants that for each day, the number of prohibitions on that day is at most n - 10. Therefore, for each day d, the number of cars prohibited on d is ≤ n - 10. Therefore, sum_{d} prohibitions_d = n. But if prohibitions_d ≤ n - 10 for each d, then sum_{d} prohibitions_d ≤ 7(n - 10). Therefore, n ≤ 7(n - 10), leading to 6n ≥ 70 ⇒ n ≥ 70/6 ≈ 11.67, so n ≥ 12. But this contradicts our previous result.Wait, something&#39;s wrong here. Let&#39;s clarify.In part b), each car is prohibited on exactly one day (chosen by police from two options). Therefore, total prohibitions across all days is n (number of cars). The family needs that for each day d, the number of cars prohibited on d is ≤ n - 10. Because available cars on d would be total cars minus prohibitions_d, which needs to be ≥10. Therefore, prohibitions_d ≤ n - 10.Thus, for each day d, prohibitions_d ≤ n - 10. Therefore, sum_{d} prohibitions_d ≤ 7(n - 10). But sum_{d} prohibitions_d = n. Therefore,n ≤ 7(n - 10)n ≤ 7n - 70-6n ≤ -70n ≥ 70/6 ≈ 11.67 ⇒ n ≥ 12.But this is a lower bound of 12. However, our previous analysis gave a lower bound of 14. Which one is correct?Wait, there&#39;s a contradiction here. Let&#39;s re-examine the assumptions.In part b), the family selects two days for each car, and the police select one of them as the prohibited day. Therefore, the total number of prohibitions is n (one per car), and the number of prohibitions per day is the number of cars for which the police chose that day. The family wants that for each day d, prohibitions_d ≤ n - 10, because available cars on d is n - prohibitions_d ≥10 ⇒ prohibitions_d ≤ n -10.Therefore, sum_{d} prohibitions_d = n ≤ 7(n -10) ⇒ n ≥ 70/6 ≈11.67⇒12.But this suggests that n≥12 is a lower bound. But this contradicts the previous analysis where we thought n≥14. Which is correct?This is a critical point. Let&#39;s clarify:In part a), each car has two fixed prohibited days, so total prohibitions per day is fixed. The available cars per day is total cars minus prohibitions on that day.In part b), each car contributes one prohibition (chosen by police), so total prohibitions is n. The available cars on day d is n - prohibitions_d.The family needs n - prohibitions_d ≥10 ⇒ prohibitions_d ≤n -10 for all d.But sum_{d} prohibitions_d =n, so sum_{d} (n -10) ≥ sum_{d} prohibitions_d ⇒7(n -10) ≥n ⇒6n ≥70 ⇒n≥12.Therefore, the lower bound is 12. However, this is only a lower bound. We need to check if 12 is achievable.Wait, so why was the previous analysis suggesting 14? Because in the previous analysis, we thought that the number of cars not having d as a prohibited day must be ≥10, which would be equivalent to prohibitions_d ≤n -10. However, in part a), the prohibitions were fixed, two per car, but in part b), the prohibitions are one per car, chosen by police. Therefore, the constraints are different.Therefore, the lower bound here is 12. But can we achieve 12?Let’s try to construct a solution with 12 cars.We need to assign two prohibited days to each of 12 cars, such that for each day d, the number of cars that have d as one of their two prohibited days is ≤12 -10=2. Wait, no.Wait, prohibitions_d is the number of cars actually prohibited on day d, which is chosen by the police. But the family needs to ensure that regardless of the police&#39;s choices, prohibitions_d ≤n -10=12 -10=2. Therefore, for each day d, the police can choose at most two cars to prohibit on d.But the number of cars that have d as one of their prohibited days is x_d. The police can choose to prohibit up to x_d cars on d, but they will choose min(x_d, n -10) to maximize prohibitions_d. Wait, no. The police can choose, for each car that has d as a prohibited day option, whether to prohibit it on d or on the other day. Therefore, for each car that has d in its prohibited days, the police can choose to prohibit it on d, contributing to prohibitions_d, or prohibit it on the other day. Therefore, to maximize prohibitions_d, the police would prohibit as many cars as possible on d. The maximum number of prohibitions_d is the number of cars that have d as one of their prohibited days. Let’s denote y_d as the number of cars that have d as one of their prohibited days. Then, the police can set prohibitions_d = y_d (if they choose to prohibit all those cars on d). Therefore, the family must have y_d ≤n -10=2 for all d. But sum_{d} y_d =2*12=24. If y_d ≤2 for each d, then sum_{d} y_d ≤7*2=14. But 14 &lt;24, which is a contradiction. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have y_d ≤2 for all d. Therefore, the lower bound calculation was incorrect.Wait, now I see the confusion. The family can choose the two prohibited days per car, but y_d is the number of cars that include d as one of their two prohibited days. The police can then choose to prohibit up to y_d cars on d. Therefore, to ensure prohibitions_d ≤n -10, we need y_d ≤n -10 for all d. Because the police can choose to prohibit all y_d cars on d. Therefore, to have prohibitions_d ≤n -10, we must have y_d ≤n -10. But sum_{d} y_d =2n. Therefore,sum_{d} y_d=2n ≤7(n -10)2n ≤7n -705n ≥70n ≥14Ah, so this brings us back to the original lower bound of 14. Therefore, the previous analysis was correct. The confusion came from misunderstanding y_d. The key is that y_d is the number of cars that have d as one of their prohibited days, and the police can choose to prohibit all y_d cars on d. Therefore, to ensure prohibitions_d ≤n -10, we must have y_d ≤n -10. Therefore, the sum over y_d is 2n ≤7(n -10) ⇒n ≥14.Therefore, the minimal number of cars is 14. Therefore, both parts a) and b) have the same answer, 14.But the problem is part b) mentions it&#39;s a wealthy family of ten people, which might imply that each person needs their own car, but the problem states &quot;each day every family member can drive independently&quot;. So each family member needs access to a car each day, but they can share cars? Or does each member need their own car? The problem says &quot;can drive independently&quot;, which probably means that each member needs their own car. Therefore, ten cars available each day. So the reasoning remains the same.Therefore, both answers are 14.However, the standard answer for part b) is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check external sources or similar problems.Upon recalling, part a) is a classic problem where the answer is 14, as we reasoned. Part b) is a variation where instead of two fixed prohibited days, you have two options, and the answer is 14 as well. However, some similar problems have different answers when considering adaptivity. However, given the mathematical constraints, since the lower bound is 14, and it&#39;s achievable by the same method as part a), the answer should be 14.But let&#39;s confirm with a small example. Suppose we have two days, two cars. Wait, not helpful.Wait, suppose we have 14 cars, each with two prohibited days arranged so that each day is prohibited by four cars. Then, if the police choose to prohibit those four cars on each day, we have ten available. Therefore, it works. Hence, 14 cars.Therefore, the answers are both 14.But according to the problem&#39;s phrasing, part b) might have a different answer. Wait, the family designates the non-driving days sequentially. So perhaps they can adapt based on previous assignments. For example, if the first car is assigned days A and B, and the police choose A, then the family might assign the next car to days A and C, knowing that day A is already somewhat covered. But since the police are adversarial, they would continue to choose prohibitions to maximize the required cars. Therefore, adaptivity doesn&#39;t help because the police can always choose the worst-case prohibition. Hence, the lower bound remains 14.Therefore, I conclude both answers are 14.Final Answera) boxed{14}b) boxed{14}&lt;/think&gt;To solve part (a), we need to determine the smallest number of cars required such that the family has at least ten cars available each day, given that each car cannot be driven on two specific days. 1. Each car is available on 5 days of the week.2. The family needs at least 10 cars available each day.3. The total number of available car-days needed is (10 times 7 = 70).4. Each car contributes 5 available days, so the minimum number of cars (n) must satisfy (5n geq 70), which gives (n geq 14).5. We need to check if 14 cars can be arranged such that each day has exactly 10 cars available. This is possible by using a combinatorial design where each day is prohibited by exactly 4 cars, leaving 10 cars available each day. Thus, the smallest number of cars needed for part (a) is (boxed{14}).For part (b), the family needs to ensure that each day has at least ten cars available, even though the police choose one of two prohibited days for each car. 1. Each car is prohibited on one day, chosen by the police from two options provided by the family.2. The family needs to ensure that regardless of the police&#39;s choices, each day has at least ten cars available.3. Using a similar reasoning as part (a), the total number of prohibitions must be distributed such that each day is prohibited by at most 4 cars, leaving 10 cars available.4. The lower bound calculation shows that 14 cars are required, as each car can cover five days, and the adversarial police choices cannot reduce the availability below ten cars per day.Thus, the smallest number of cars needed for part (b) is also (boxed{14}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-5fefdbb4></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5fefdbb4><span class="icon" data-v-5fefdbb4>🔑:</span>a) 13 cars are not enough.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me recall what a contrapositive is. From what I remember in logic, the contrapositive of a statement &quot;If P, then Q&quot; is &quot;If not Q, then not P&quot;. And importantly, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. So, they have the same truth value. Alright, so let&#39;s break down the original proposition. The original is &quot;If x &gt; 10, then x &gt; 1&quot;. Here, P is &quot;x &gt; 10&quot; and Q is &quot;x &gt; 1&quot;. According to the contrapositive definition, we need to form the statement &quot;If not Q, then not P&quot;. So, not Q would be &quot;x ≤ 1&quot; and not P would be &quot;x ≤ 10&quot;. Therefore, the contrapositive should be &quot;If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10&quot;. Let me check the options again. Option D says &quot;If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10&quot;. That matches what I derived. Let me just verify each step again to be sure. Original statement: If P (x &gt; 10), then Q (x &gt; 1). Contrapositive is If not Q, then not P. Not Q is the negation of &quot;x &gt; 1&quot;, which is &quot;x ≤ 1&quot;. Not P is the negation of &quot;x &gt; 10&quot;, which is &quot;x ≤ 10&quot;. So combining them: If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10. So yes, that&#39;s option D. Wait, but let me check the other options to see if any of them could also be correct. Option A is &quot;If x &gt; 1, then x &gt; 10&quot;. That&#39;s actually the converse of the original statement. Because converse swaps P and Q. The original is P → Q, converse is Q → P. So that&#39;s not the contrapositive. Option B: &quot;If x &gt; 10, then x ≤ 1&quot;. That seems like the inverse? Wait, inverse is &quot;If not P, then not Q&quot;. So inverse would be &quot;If x ≤ 10, then x ≤ 1&quot;. Wait, inverse is not one of the options except maybe option C? Let me check. Original statement: P → Q. Inverse is ¬P → ¬Q. So inverse would be &quot;If x ≤ 10, then x ≤ 1&quot;, which is option C. So option C is the inverse. Then option B is &quot;If x &gt; 10, then x ≤ 1&quot;, which is actually the inverse of the original statement? Wait, no. The inverse is &quot;If not P, then not Q&quot;, which is &quot;If x ≤ 10, then x ≤ 1&quot;. So inverse is option C. Then what is option B? Option B is &quot;If x &gt; 10, then x ≤ 1&quot;. That seems like a different statement. Maybe it&#39;s a negation? Let&#39;s see. The original statement is P → Q. Its negation is P ∧ ¬Q. So &quot;x &gt; 10 and x ≤ 1&quot;. But that&#39;s not an implication. So option B is not the inverse or contrapositive; it&#39;s a different kind of statement. Maybe someone confused the inverse and something else. So the contrapositive is option D. Let&#39;s confirm once more. The contrapositive of &quot;If P, then Q&quot; is &quot;If ¬Q, then ¬P&quot;. So P is x &gt; 10, Q is x &gt; 1. Therefore, ¬Q is x ≤ 1, ¬P is x ≤ 10. So contrapositive is &quot;If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10&quot;. Which is exactly option D. Therefore, the answer should be D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To find the contrapositive of the proposition ( p ): &quot;If ( x &gt; 10 ), then ( x &gt; 1 )&quot;, we need to recall that the contrapositive of a statement &quot;If ( P ), then ( Q )&quot; is &quot;If not ( Q ), then not ( P )&quot;. 1. Identify ( P ) and ( Q ):   - ( P ): ( x &gt; 10 )   - ( Q ): ( x &gt; 1 )2. Form the contrapositive:   - The contrapositive is &quot;If not ( Q ), then not ( P )&quot;.   - Not ( Q ) is ( x leq 1 ).   - Not ( P ) is ( x leq 10 ).   - Therefore, the contrapositive is &quot;If ( x leq 1 ), then ( x leq 10 )&quot;.3. Check the options:   - Option D: &quot;If ( x leq 1 ), then ( x leq 10 )&quot; matches the contrapositive we derived.Other options are incorrect:- Option A is the converse.- Option B is a different incorrect statement.- Option C is the inverse.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the contrapositive of a proposition. The proposition given is: If x &gt; 10, then x &gt; 1. And the options are A, B, C, D. Hmm, let me remember what contrapositive means.From what I recall in logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement &quot;If p, then q&quot; is &quot;If not q, then not p&quot;. So basically, you flip the order of the original statement and negate both parts. Let me verify that. Yeah, I think that&#39;s right. So if the original is p → q, the contrapositive is ¬q → ¬p. And importantly, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. So they have the same truth value.Alright, so applying that to the given proposition. The original statement is &quot;If x &gt; 10, then x &gt; 1&quot;. Let me parse that. Here, p is &quot;x &gt; 10&quot; and q is &quot;x &gt; 1&quot;. Therefore, the contrapositive should be &quot;If not q, then not p&quot;, which translates to &quot;If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10&quot;. Let me check that again. Not q would be the negation of &quot;x &gt; 1&quot;, which is &quot;x ≤ 1&quot;, and not p is the negation of &quot;x &gt; 10&quot;, which is &quot;x ≤ 10&quot;. So indeed, the contrapositive is &quot;If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10&quot;.Looking at the options provided:A: If x &gt; 1, then x &gt; 10. Hmm, that seems like the converse of the original statement. Because converse is q → p. So that&#39;s swapping p and q without negating. So that&#39;s not the contrapositive.B: If x &gt; 10, then x ≤ 1. Wait, that&#39;s just changing the conclusion to its negation but keeping the same hypothesis. That would be a contradiction, right? If x is greater than 10, how can it be less than or equal to 1? That doesn&#39;t make sense. Maybe this is the inverse or something else. The inverse would be &quot;If not p, then not q&quot;, which is ¬p → ¬q. So inverse is &quot;If x ≤ 10, then x ≤ 1&quot;. Wait, that&#39;s option C. So inverse is different.C: If x ≤ 10, then x ≤ 1. As I just thought, that&#39;s the inverse of the original statement. The inverse is not necessarily equivalent to the original. So that&#39;s not the contrapositive.D: If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10. That matches what I derived earlier for the contrapositive. So D is the contrapositive.Let me just cross-verify. Original: If p then q. Contrapositive: If not q, then not p. So p is x &gt; 10, q is x &gt; 1. Not q is x ≤ 1, not p is x ≤ 10. Therefore, contrapositive is If x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10. Which is exactly option D. So that must be the correct answer.Just to make sure I&#39;m not making a mistake here. Let&#39;s also check with an example. Suppose x is 5. Then in the original statement, since 5 is not greater than 10, the hypothesis is false, so the statement is true. For the contrapositive, if x ≤ 1, then x ≤ 10. If x is 0, which is ≤ 1, then 0 is also ≤ 10, so the contrapositive holds. If x is 5, which is not ≤ 1, so the contrapositive is vacuously true. So both the original and contrapositive hold. If x is 11, original statement: 11 &gt; 10 implies 11 &gt; 1, which is true. Contrapositive: If 11 ≤ 1, then 11 ≤ 10. Well, 11 is not ≤ 1, so contrapositive is vacuously true. If x is 0.5, original: 0.5 &gt; 10 is false, so implication holds. Contrapositive: 0.5 ≤ 1 implies 0.5 ≤ 10, which is true. So in all cases, original and contrapositive have same truth value. Therefore, D is correct.I think that&#39;s thorough. So the answer should be D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To find the contrapositive of the proposition &quot;If ( x &gt; 10 ), then ( x &gt; 1 )&quot;, we need to recall that the contrapositive of a conditional statement &quot;If ( p ), then ( q )&quot; is &quot;If not ( q ), then not ( p )&quot;. 1. Identify ( p ) and ( q ) in the original statement:   - ( p ): ( x &gt; 10 )   - ( q ): ( x &gt; 1 )2. Determine the contrapositive by negating both ( q ) and ( p ), and swapping their order:   - Negation of ( q ) (( lnot q )): ( x leq 1 )   - Negation of ( p ) (( lnot p )): ( x leq 10 )   - Contrapositive: &quot;If ( x leq 1 ), then ( x leq 10 )&quot;3. Compare with the given options:   - Option D: &quot;If ( x leq 1 ), then ( x leq 10 )&quot; matches the contrapositive derived.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-5fefdbb4></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5fefdbb4><span class="icon" data-v-5fefdbb4>🔑:</span>Since the proposition p is: If x &gt; 10, then x &gt; 1,  the contrapositive of proposition p is:  If x leq 1, then x leq 10.  Therefore, the correct option is: D.  The contrapositive of the proposition: If p, then q is: If not q, then not p, which can be directly written.  This question examines the application of the relationship between a proposition and its contrapositive, which is a basic problem.boxed{text{D}}</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-16350089><span data-v-16350089>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
