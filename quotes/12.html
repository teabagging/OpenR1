Here, X is the set of natural numbers with prime factors only from the first 2009 primes. Let&#39;s start by understanding the problem step by step.First, let me recall that X is a multiplicative semigroup since the product of any two numbers in X is also in X. The function f is from X to X, so it takes numbers with primes from P and maps them to the same kind of numbers. The functional equation given is f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. This looks a bit like a homomorphism or some kind of multiplicative function, but it&#39;s more complex because of the composition with f inside the argument.Since the equation has to hold for all m and n in X, maybe I can choose specific values for m or n to simplify the equation and get some constraints on f and k. Let&#39;s try plugging in m = 1. Then the equation becomes f(1 * f(n)) = f(1) * n^k. Simplifying, that&#39;s f(f(n)) = f(1) n^k. Hmm, interesting. So applying f twice gives us f(1) times n^k.What if I also set n = 1 in the original equation? Then we have f(m f(1)) = f(m) * 1^k = f(m). So f(m f(1)) = f(m) for all m in X. That suggests that multiplying m by f(1) doesn&#39;t change the value of f(m). Is there a way to use this?Suppose f(1) is some element in X. Let&#39;s call c = f(1). Then from n = 1, we have f(m c) = f(m). So multiplying the argument by c doesn&#39;t affect the function&#39;s output. Also, from m = 1, we have f(f(n)) = c n^k.So, two key equations:1. f(m c) = f(m) for all m in X.2. f(f(n)) = c n^k for all n in X.Let me see if these two can lead to something. From the first equation, if we set m = c, then f(c * c) = f(c). But also, if we set m = c in the first equation, f(c * c) = f(c). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Wait, maybe if I iterate the first equation. For example, f(m c^2) = f(m c) = f(m). Similarly, f(m c^t) = f(m) for any natural number t. So, multiplying m by any power of c doesn&#39;t change f(m). That suggests that c must be 1? Wait, why? Because if c were not 1, then multiplying by c would change m, but f(m c^t) remains f(m). So unless c = 1, otherwise, c must have some property that makes multiplying by it not affect the function f. But c is in X, so it&#39;s a product of primes from P. If c is 1, then multiplying by c does nothing, which makes the equation trivial: f(m * 1) = f(m), which is always true. But if c is not 1, then multiplying by c is a non-trivial operation. However, according to the first equation, f(m c) = f(m). So f is invariant under scaling by c. This suggests that c must be 1, otherwise, f would not be injective or something? Wait, but maybe c is 1. Let&#39;s check.Suppose c = 1. Then, from equation 2: f(f(n)) = 1 * n^k = n^k. So f is a function such that applying it twice gives n^k. Also, equation 1 becomes f(m * 1) = f(m), which is redundant. So in this case, f is a function where f(f(n)) = n^k. So we need such a function f from X to X. Also, the original functional equation becomes f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. If c = 1, maybe such functions exist? Let&#39;s suppose c = 1. Then, perhaps f is a multiplicative function. Let&#39;s consider multiplicative functions. Since X is multiplicative, if f is multiplicative, then f(m f(n)) = f(m) f(f(n)) = f(m) n^k. Which would require that f(f(n)) = n^k, as given. So multiplicative functions satisfying f(f(n)) = n^k. So if such a multiplicative function exists, then the original equation is satisfied. So perhaps we can focus on multiplicative functions f where f(f(n)) = n^k. Then, for multiplicative functions, the behavior is determined by their action on primes. So let&#39;s think about primes.Let P be the set of first 2009 primes. Let me index them as p_1, p_2, ..., p_2009. Since X includes numbers with prime factors only from P, any n in X can be written as a product of primes from P. If f is multiplicative, then f(n) is determined by its values on the primes. So let&#39;s define f(p_i) for each prime p_i in P. Then, for f to map X to X, f(p_i) must be an element of X, so a product of primes from P. Then, since f is multiplicative, f(n) for any n in X is the product of f(p_i) raised to the exponents in n&#39;s prime factorization.Given that f(f(n)) = n^k, let&#39;s see what this implies for primes. Take n = p_i. Then f(f(p_i)) = p_i^k. Let&#39;s denote f(p_i) as some element of X, say q_i. Then f(q_i) = p_i^k. But q_i is in X, so it&#39;s a product of primes from P. Then f(q_i) = p_i^k. So if q_i is a prime, say q_i = p_j, then f(p_j) = p_i^k. But then applying f again, f(f(p_j)) = f(p_i^k) = f(p_i)^k = (p_i^k)^k = p_i^{k^2}. But according to f(f(p_j)) = p_j^k. Therefore, p_i^{k^2} = p_j^k. But primes are unique, so this requires that p_i^{k^2} = p_j^k. This can only be true if p_i and p_j are the same prime and k^2 = k. But k is a natural number, so k^2 = k implies k = 1. However, p_i and p_j must be equal, which would mean that f(p_i) = p_i. Then f(f(p_i)) = f(p_i) = p_i, but we need it to be p_i^k. So unless k = 1, this doesn&#39;t hold. If k = 1, then f(f(p_i)) = p_i, so that works if f is an involution, i.e., f(f(p_i)) = p_i. So for k = 1, we can have such functions, like the identity function. But for k &gt; 1, if we suppose that f(p_i) is a single prime, then we get a contradiction unless k = 1.Alternatively, maybe f(p_i) is a product of primes. Suppose f(p_i) is a product of primes, say q_{i1} q_{i2} ... q_{il}}. Then f(f(p_i)) = f(q_{i1}) f(q_{i2}) ... f(q_{il})} = product over j of f(q_{ij}). But each q_{ij} is a prime in P, so f(q_{ij}) is some element of X. For f(f(p_i)) to equal p_i^k, which is a prime power, we need that the product of f(q_{ij}) is p_i^k. Since p_i^k is a prime power, each f(q_{ij}) must be a power of p_i, otherwise, the product would have multiple prime factors. Therefore, each f(q_{ij}) is a power of p_i. So, for each prime q_{ij} in the support of f(p_i), f(q_{ij}) must be a power of p_i. But since f maps into X, which is the set of numbers with prime factors in P, the primes q_{ij} must be in P. So each q_{ij} is in P, and f(q_{ij}) is a power of p_i.So let&#39;s formalize this. Suppose f(p_i) is a product of primes q_{i1}, q_{i2}, ..., q_{il_i}}. Then f(f(p_i)) = product_{j=1 to l_i} f(q_{ij}) = product_{j=1 to l_i} (some power of p_i). Therefore, the entire product is p_i^{m} for some m. But we need this to equal p_i^k. Therefore, the exponents must satisfy m = k. So the product of f(q_{ij}) must be p_i^k. Each f(q_{ij}) is a power of p_i, say p_i^{a_j}, so the product is p_i^{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{l_i}}} = p_i^{k}. Therefore, the sum of exponents a_j must be k. Therefore, for each i, if f(p_i) is a product of primes q_{i1}...q_{il_i}}, then for each q_{ij}, f(q_{ij}) = p_i^{a_j} where a_j are positive integers such that sum a_j = k. But each q_{ij} is a prime in P. Let&#39;s denote q_{ij} as p_{m}, some prime in P. Then f(p_{m}) = p_i^{a_j}. But we can do this for each prime in the image of f(p_i). However, the problem is that each prime p_{m} in P must have f(p_{m}) defined, and this definition must be consistent across all primes. So for example, suppose we have f(p_i) = product of primes q_{i1}...q_{il_i}}, each q_{ij} is in P, and for each q_{ij} = p_{m}, f(p_{m}) must be p_i^{a_j} with sum a_j = k. But then, for another prime p_{n}, if we have f(p_{n}) = product of primes q_{n1}...q_{nl_n}}, each q_{n t} in P, and for each q_{n t} = p_{s}, f(p_{s}) must be p_{n}^{b_t} where sum b_t = k.But this creates a system where primes in P are grouped into cycles or something. For instance, if f(p_i) is a product of primes that map back to p_i via f, then this could form a cycle. Alternatively, primes could map to other primes in such a way that applying f twice gives a power.Wait, but given the first equation f(m c) = f(m) with c = 1 (if c = 1), then f is not necessarily required to be multiplicative. Wait, but if c = 1, then the first equation is trivial. However, if we assume f is multiplicative, then we can use multiplicative properties, but the problem does not state that f is multiplicative. So perhaps f is not necessarily multiplicative. However, the functional equation resembles a multiplicative function&#39;s behavior when composed with itself.Alternatively, maybe we can represent elements of X as vectors of exponents. Since X is the set of numbers with prime factors in P, which is the first 2009 primes, each element n in X can be represented by a vector (e_1, e_2, ..., e_{2009}) where e_i is the exponent of p_i in the prime factorization of n. Then, the function f can be thought of as a function from vectors to vectors. The functional equation f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. Translating this into vectors, if m corresponds to vector (a_1, ..., a_{2009}) and n corresponds to (b_1, ..., b_{2009}), then f(n) corresponds to some vector (c_1, ..., c_{2009}), and m f(n) corresponds to (a_1 + c_1, ..., a_{2009} + c_{2009}). Then f(m f(n)) corresponds to applying f to this vector. On the right-hand side, f(m) n^k is the vector sum of f(m) and (k b_1, ..., k b_{2009}).Wait, but multiplication of numbers corresponds to addition of exponent vectors, and exponentiation corresponds to multiplying exponents. Wait, actually, n^k would correspond to multiplying each exponent in n by k. So, if n is (b_1, ..., b_{2009}), then n^k is (k b_1, ..., k b_{2009}). Therefore, the right-hand side f(m) n^k is the product of f(m) and n^k, which in exponent vectors is adding the exponents of f(m) and n^k. So if f(m) is (d_1, ..., d_{2009}), then f(m) n^k is (d_1 + k b_1, ..., d_{2009} + k b_{2009}).On the left-hand side, m f(n) is the product of m and f(n), which in exponent vectors is (a_1 + c_1, ..., a_{2009} + c_{2009}), then applying f to that. Therefore, the equation in vectors is:f applied to (a_1 + c_1, ..., a_{2009} + c_{2009}) equals (d_1 + k b_1, ..., d_{2009} + k b_{2009}).But this needs to hold for all m and n. Therefore, for all vectors a and b, f(a + c) = d + k b, where c is f(b) and d is f(a). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#39;s try to rephrase.Let me denote the exponent vector of n as v(n) = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_{2009}). Then the function f can be represented as a function F on these vectors, such that F(v(n)) = v(f(n)). The functional equation becomes:v(f(m f(n))) = v(f(m) n^k).Left-hand side: v(f(m f(n))) = F(v(m) + v(f(n))) = F(v(m) + F(v(n))).Right-hand side: v(f(m) n^k) = v(f(m)) + v(n^k) = F(v(m)) + k v(n).Therefore, the equation in terms of vectors is:F(v(m) + F(v(n))) = F(v(m)) + k v(n).But this must hold for all vectors v(m) and v(n). Let&#39;s denote x = v(m) and y = v(n). Then the equation becomes:F(x + F(y)) = F(x) + k y.So for all non-negative integer vectors x, y (since exponents are non-negative integers), this equation must hold.This is a functional equation on the function F: N^{2009} → N^{2009}. We need to find F such that F(x + F(y)) = F(x) + k y for all x, y ∈ N^{2009}.This seems similar to a linear function. Suppose F is linear, so F(x) = A x where A is a matrix. Then the equation becomes A(x + A y) = A x + k y. Simplifying, A x + A^2 y = A x + k y. Therefore, A^2 y = k y for all y. So A^2 = k I, where I is the identity matrix. Therefore, A is a square root of k I over the integers? Wait, but A is a 2009x2009 matrix with non-negative integer entries, and we need A^2 = k I.This seems restrictive. For example, if k = 1, then A^2 = I. So we need an involutory matrix, i.e., a matrix that is its own inverse. Such matrices exist; for example, the identity matrix itself, or permutation matrices of order 2 (i.e., transpositions). However, since we&#39;re dealing with non-negative integer matrices, permutation matrices are allowed. So if A is a permutation matrix with A^2 = I, then it would satisfy the equation for k = 1.But if k is greater than 1, then A^2 = k I. Let&#39;s see. For each standard basis vector e_i, A^2 e_i = k e_i. So A (A e_i) = k e_i. Let&#39;s denote A e_i as some vector v_i. Then A v_i = k e_i. Since A has non-negative integer entries, each component of v_i must be such that when multiplied by A, they sum to k in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere. This is quite restrictive. For example, if A is diagonal, then A^2 would be diagonal with entries squared, so A^2 = k I implies that each diagonal entry is sqrt(k). But sqrt(k) must be integer, so k must be a perfect square. However, even if k is a perfect square, say k = m^2, then A would be m I. Then A^2 = m^2 I = k I, which works. But in that case, F(x) = m x, so the function f(n) would correspond to raising each prime in n to the m-th power, hence f(n) = n^m. Let&#39;s check if this works.If f(n) = n^m, then f(m f(n)) = f(m n^m) = (m n^m)^m = m^m n^{m^2}. On the other hand, f(m) n^k = m^m n^k. These would be equal if m^2 = k. So for k being a perfect square, say k = m^2, then f(n) = n^m is a solution. However, this requires that m is an integer, so k must be a perfect square. However, in the problem statement, k is a natural number, so possible solutions would be k being perfect squares. But the problem asks for all natural numbers k for which such a function exists, not necessarily only the ones where f(n) = n^m. There might be non-linear solutions.Wait, but the previous analysis with the matrix suggests that if A^2 = k I, then k must be a square, and even then, only if there exists a matrix A with non-negative integer entries such that A^2 = k I. The only such matrices are diagonal matrices with sqrt(k) on the diagonal, which would require sqrt(k) to be integer, so k must be a square, and A is sqrt(k) times the identity matrix. However, there might be other non-diagonal matrices. For example, permutation matrices. If k = 1, permutation matrices work. For k &gt; 1, maybe some combination?Suppose A is a permutation matrix multiplied by some scalar. Wait, but permutation matrices have entries 0 and 1. If we multiply by a scalar m, then the entries would be 0 and m. Then A^2 would be the permutation matrix squared times m^2. Since permutation matrices squared can be another permutation matrix (if the permutation is of order 2) or the identity. For example, if A is a transposition (swapping two basis vectors), then A^2 = I. So if we set A = m * transposition matrix, then A^2 = m^2 * I. So in this case, if we want A^2 = k I, then m^2 = k, so m = sqrt(k). Hence, k must be a perfect square again, and A would be sqrt(k) times a permutation matrix. However, if we require that A has non-negative integer entries, then m must be an integer, so sqrt(k) must be integer. Therefore, even with permutation matrices, we still require that k is a perfect square.Alternatively, maybe there are more exotic matrices. Suppose A has some rows that combine multiple basis vectors. For example, A e_i = e_j + e_l. Then A^2 e_i = A(e_j + e_l) = A e_j + A e_l. If we want this to equal k e_i, then A e_j + A e_l must equal k e_i. So both A e_j and A e_l must be vectors whose sum is k e_i. Since A has non-negative integer entries, each of A e_j and A e_l must have non-negative entries, and their sum must have k in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere. Therefore, each of A e_j and A e_l must have 0 in all positions except possibly the i-th, and the sum of their i-th entries must be k. Therefore, if A e_j = a e_i and A e_l = b e_i, with a + b = k. Then A e_j = a e_i, which implies that column j of A is a e_i, and column l of A is b e_i. But then, for A^2 e_j = A(a e_i) = a A e_i. But A e_i is defined as, say, A e_i = c e_p + d e_q + ... Then A(a e_i) = a (c e_p + d e_q + ...). But we need A^2 e_j = k e_j? Wait, no. Wait, A^2 e_i must equal k e_i, but in this case, A e_j = a e_i and A e_l = b e_i. Then, A^2 e_j = A(a e_i) = a A e_i. If A e_i is some vector, then a A e_i must equal k e_j. But unless a A e_i is k e_j, which would require that A e_i = (k/a) e_j. But since A has integer entries, k/a must be integer. Similarly, a must divide k. This is getting too complicated. It seems that unless A is diagonal, it&#39;s difficult to satisfy A^2 = k I for non-square k. Hence, perhaps the only possibility is that k is a perfect square and A is sqrt(k) times a permutation matrix. However, permutation matrices have entries 0 and 1, so scaling them by sqrt(k) would require that sqrt(k) is an integer, so k must be a perfect square. Hence, only square numbers k would allow such a matrix A, leading to a function f(n) = n^sqrt(k). However, since f must map X to X, and sqrt(k) is an integer, then f(n) = n^m where m = sqrt(k), so k = m^2. Therefore, this suggests that k must be a perfect square.But wait, in the problem statement, X is the set of numbers with prime factors in P (the first 2009 primes). Therefore, raising a number in X to the m-th power keeps it in X. Hence, f(n) = n^m is a valid function from X to X. Then, according to the previous check, if we set f(n) = n^m, then f(m f(n)) = f(m n^m) = (m n^m)^m = m^m n^{m^2}, and f(m) n^k = m^m n^k. Therefore, equating the two, m^m n^{m^2} = m^m n^k, which implies that n^{m^2} = n^k for all n in X. Therefore, m^2 = k. Hence, k must be a perfect square. Therefore, for each perfect square k, such a function f(n) = n^{sqrt(k)} exists. Conversely, if such a function exists, then k must be a perfect square. Therefore, the natural numbers k are exactly the perfect squares.But wait, the problem says &quot;natural numbers k&quot;, so k must be positive integers. Therefore, the answer is all positive integers k that are perfect squares. But let&#39;s check whether there could be non-square k for which such a function exists.Suppose that k is not a square. Is there another way to construct f? For example, maybe using different exponents for different primes. Suppose we define f(p_i) = p_j^{a}, where j is some index and a is an exponent such that when we apply f again, we get p_j^{a} mapped to p_i^{k}. Wait, this seems similar to before but with permutations. Suppose we pair up the primes and define f(p_i) = p_j and f(p_j) = p_i^k. Then f(f(p_i)) = f(p_j) = p_i^k, which is required. But then, for f(f(p_j)) = f(p_i^k) = f(p_i)^k = p_j^k. However, according to the functional equation, f(f(p_j)) should be p_j^k. Wait, but f(f(p_j)) = p_j^k, which matches. So in this case, if we can pair up primes such that each pair (p_i, p_j) satisfies f(p_i) = p_j and f(p_j) = p_i^k, then f(f(p_i)) = p_j^k and f(f(p_j)) = f(p_i^k) = p_j^{k^2}. Wait, but f(f(p_j)) should equal p_j^k. Therefore, p_j^{k^2} = p_j^k, which implies that k^2 = k, so k=1. Therefore, this approach only works for k=1. For k=1, such a permutation of primes would work if f is an involution, i.e., f(f(p_i)) = p_i. Then, for k=1, f(f(n)) = n, which works. But for k&gt;1, this approach leads to a contradiction unless k=1.Alternatively, if we have cycles longer than two. For example, a cycle of length 3: f(p_1) = p_2, f(p_2) = p_3, f(p_3) = p_1^k. Then f(f(p_1)) = f(p_2) = p_3, which should equal p_1^k. So p_3 = p_1^k. But primes are distinct, so this is impossible unless k=1 and p_3 = p_1, which they are not. Therefore, cycles longer than two also don&#39;t help unless k=1.Another approach: Maybe f(n) = 1 for all n. Then f(m f(n)) = f(m * 1) = f(m) = 1. On the other hand, f(m) n^k = 1 * n^k = n^k. So 1 = n^k for all n in X. But this is only possible if n^k = 1 for all n in X, which is only true if all n = 1, but X includes all natural numbers with prime factors from P, which are infinitely many. Therefore, this is impossible. So f cannot be the constant function 1 unless k=0, but k is a natural number, so k &gt;=1.Alternatively, if f is a constant function with value c in X. Then f(m f(n)) = c, and f(m) n^k = c n^k. Therefore, c = c n^k for all n in X. This implies that n^k =1 for all n in X, which is impossible unless k=0, which is not allowed. Therefore, constant functions other than 1 don&#39;t work either.Another idea: Suppose f is injective or surjective. If f is injective, then maybe we can invert it. From the equation f(f(n)) = c n^k. If c=1, then f(f(n)) = n^k. If f is injective, then perhaps we can define an inverse function. But I don&#39;t see immediately how that helps.Alternatively, suppose that k=1. Then the functional equation becomes f(m f(n)) = f(m) n. Let&#39;s see if such a function exists. For example, suppose f is the identity function. Then f(m f(n)) = m n, and f(m) n = m n. So it works. So k=1 is possible. Also, if f is a permutation of primes, as discussed earlier, then f(f(n)) = n, which for k=1 satisfies f(f(n)) = n = n^1. So that works. So for k=1, there are multiple solutions. The identity function, permutation functions, etc.For k=2, if we suppose that f(n) = n^sqrt(2), but sqrt(2) is not an integer, so that&#39;s not allowed. So unless we can find another structure. Wait, but if we set f(n) = n^m, then as before, k must be m^2. Therefore, k must be a square. Hence, possible k are squares.But perhaps there is a non-multiplicative function for non-square k. Let&#39;s suppose that k is not a square. Then, can we construct a function f? For example, let’s take k=2. Suppose we try to define f(n) such that f(f(n)) = n^2. Let’s see for primes. Take a prime p. Then f(f(p)) = p^2. So f(p) must be some element q in X such that f(q) = p^2. Similarly, for q, f(q) = p^2. But then f(p^2) = f(f(q)) = q^2. Wait, but f(f(q)) = q^2, but according to the equation f(f(q)) = q^k = q^2, which would require k=2. Wait, but in this case, we have f(f(q)) = q^2, which would mean that if k=2, then yes. However, how do we define f(p)?Let’s try to build such a function. Let&#39;s pick a prime p_1. Let’s set f(p_1) = q_1, where q_1 is some element of X such that f(q_1) = p_1^2. Then, q_1 can be a product of primes. Suppose q_1 is a prime, say p_2. Then f(p_2) = p_1^2. Then f(p_2) is p_1^2, which is in X. Then f(f(p_2)) = f(p_1^2) = [f(p_1)]^2 = p_2^2. But according to the equation f(f(p_2)) = p_2^k. So p_2^2 = p_2^k implies k=2. Therefore, this works. So if we set f(p_1) = p_2, f(p_2) = p_1^2, then f(f(p_1)) = p_1^2 = p_1^k implies k=2. Wait, but in this case, for p_1, f(f(p_1)) = f(p_2) = p_1^2 = p_1^k, which requires k=2. Similarly, for p_2, f(f(p_2)) = f(p_1^2) = [f(p_1)]^2 = p_2^2 = p_2^k, which also requires k=2. Therefore, this works for k=2. But k=2 is not a perfect square. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that k must be a square. What&#39;s going on here?Wait, in this case, the function f is not multiplicative. Because if f(p_1) = p_2 and f(p_2) = p_1^2, then for n = p_1 p_2, f(n) = f(p_1) f(p_2) = p_2 * p_1^2 = p_1^2 p_2. Then f(f(n)) = f(p_1^2 p_2) = [f(p_1)]^2 f(p_2) = p_2^2 * p_1^2 = p_1^2 p_2^2. On the other hand, n^k = (p_1 p_2)^2 = p_1^2 p_2^2. So f(f(n)) = n^2. Therefore, this works. However, note that this function f is not multiplicative. Because f(p_1 p_2) = p_1^2 p_2, which is not equal to f(p_1) f(p_2) = p_2 * p_1^2 = p_1^2 p_2. Wait, actually, it is equal. Wait, in this case, f(p_1 p_2) = f(p_1) f(p_2) = p_2 * p_1^2 = p_1^2 p_2. So f is multiplicative here. Wait, but how is f multiplicative if the definition on primes is not a multiplicative function? Wait, no. If f is defined on primes and extended multiplicatively, then f is multiplicative by definition. So in this case, if we define f(p_i) for each prime and extend it multiplicatively, then f is multiplicative. Therefore, in this case, even though we permute primes and raise them to powers, as long as the function is defined multiplicatively, then f is multiplicative. But in the previous example, we set f(p_1) = p_2 and f(p_2) = p_1^2. Then, for n = p_1, f(n) = p_2, f(f(n)) = p_1^2, which is n^2. Similarly, for n = p_2, f(f(n)) = p_2^2 = n^2. For a composite number, like p_1 p_2, f(f(p_1 p_2)) = f(p_1^2 p_2) = f(p_1)^2 f(p_2) = p_2^2 * p_1^2 = (p_1 p_2)^2. Therefore, f(f(n)) = n^2 for all n. Therefore, this works for k=2, even though 2 is not a perfect square. Therefore, my previous conclusion that k must be a square was incorrect.This suggests that there are solutions for non-square k. So where was the mistake in the earlier reasoning? Let me review.When we considered the matrix equation A^2 = k I, we thought that the only solutions are when k is a square and A is sqrt(k) I or a permutation matrix scaled by sqrt(k). However, the example above shows that for k=2, a non-scalar matrix can satisfy A^2 = 2 I. Wait, let&#39;s model this example in terms of matrices.In the example, we have two primes p_1 and p_2 (for simplicity, let&#39;s take P as just the first two primes; the idea extends). Then, f(p_1) = p_2, which in exponent vectors is mapping (1,0) to (0,1). Similarly, f(p_2) = p_1^2, which maps (0,1) to (2,0). Therefore, the matrix A representing this function would be:For the first basis vector e1 = (1,0), A e1 = e2.For the second basis vector e2 = (0,1), A e2 = 2 e1.Therefore, the matrix A is:[0, 2][1, 0]Then, A^2 is:[0*0 + 2*1, 0*2 + 2*0][1*0 + 0*1, 1*2 + 0*0]Wait, compute A^2:First row: first element is (0*0 + 2*1) = 2, second element is (0*2 + 2*0) = 0.Second row: first element is (1*0 + 0*1) = 0, second element is (1*2 + 0*0) = 2.Therefore, A^2 is:[2, 0][0, 2]= 2 I.Therefore, A^2 = 2 I, which corresponds to k=2. Hence, this matrix satisfies A^2 = 2 I, even though 2 is not a perfect square. Thus, my previous assumption that k must be a square was incorrect. The key insight here is that non-diagonal matrices can satisfy A^2 = k I even when k is not a perfect square, as long as the matrix entries are arranged such that their products result in the required diagonal entries.Therefore, for the general case with 2009 primes, perhaps we can construct such matrices by pairing up primes or creating cycles where the product of the mappings gives k on the diagonal. For example, as in the 2x2 case, pairing two primes and creating a 2x2 block that results in A^2 = k I for the corresponding block. Then, if we have an even number of primes, we could pair them all up and set k to be the square of some integer, but in the previous example, k=2 isn&#39;t a square but still works with a 2x2 block. Wait, but in that 2x2 example, A^2 = 2 I, which is like a scalar multiple in the block. Therefore, in general, if we can partition the set of primes into pairs (or larger cycles?) and define A such that each block corresponds to a matrix whose square is k times the identity matrix for that block.However, in the 2x2 example, k=2, and the block is a 2x2 matrix with A^2 = 2 I. If we have more primes, we could potentially have multiple such blocks. For instance, if we have 2008 primes, which is even, we could pair them into 1004 pairs, each contributing a 2x2 block with A^2 = 2 I, leading to k=2. But if we have an odd number of primes, like 2009, which is odd, then we cannot pair all of them; there would be one left over. Therefore, in the case of 2009 primes, we can pair 2008 of them into 1004 pairs and have one prime left. For the single prime, we need a 1x1 block. For the 1x1 block, A^2 = k I implies that a^2 = k, so a = sqrt(k). Therefore, for the single prime, k must be a square. Hence, for the entire matrix, k must be equal to the square of some integer for the single block, and for the paired blocks, k can be any natural number such that each 2x2 block has A^2 = k I. But in the 2x2 case, we saw that k=2 works. However, in general, for a 2x2 block, if we have a matrix like [0, m; 1, 0], then A^2 = [m, 0; 0, m] = m I. So if we set m = k, then such a block would contribute k I. Therefore, each 2x2 block can be used to set k as any natural number m, but in this case, the blocks would contribute k = m, and if there are multiple blocks, they must all have the same k. Therefore, if we have multiple 2x2 blocks, each contributing k I, then k must be the same across all blocks. Similarly, the 1x1 block must have a^2 = k. Therefore, if we have an odd number of primes, like 2009, we can pair 2008 of them into 1004 blocks, each contributing k I, and the last prime must have a 1x1 block with a^2 = k. Hence, k must be a perfect square. Therefore, in this problem, since we have 2009 primes (which is odd), the only way to have such a function f is if k is a perfect square.Wait, this seems critical. Let me verify. If we have an odd number of primes, then we cannot pair all primes into 2x2 blocks. One prime will be left, requiring a 1x1 block. For the 1x1 block, the entry must be sqrt(k), which must be an integer. Therefore, k must be a square. For the 2x2 blocks, they can accommodate any k, but in combination with the 1x1 block, they must all have the same k. Therefore, if we have a 1x1 block requiring k to be a square, and 2x2 blocks which can adjust to any k, but in reality, the 2x2 blocks actually can only accommodate k if they are set up with a particular structure. Wait, in the 2x2 block example, the matrix [0, m; 1, 0] has A^2 = m I. Therefore, if we want A^2 = k I for the entire matrix, then each 2x2 block must have m = k, and the 1x1 block must have sqrt(k). Therefore, m = k must be equal to sqrt(k), which implies that k = 1. Wait, no. Wait, each 2x2 block contributes m I, where m is the upper right entry, and the 1x1 block contributes sqrt(k). So if we set all the 2x2 blocks to have m = k, and the 1x1 block to have sqrt(k). Then, to have A^2 = k I overall, we need each 2x2 block&#39;s m to be equal to k, so A^2 for each 2x2 block is k I, and the 1x1 block is (sqrt(k))^2 = k. Therefore, this requires that m = k for the 2x2 blocks, but then the 2x2 block matrix [0, k; 1, 0] has A^2 = [k, 0; 0, k] = k I. Therefore, for each 2x2 block, setting m = k allows A^2 = k I, and the 1x1 block with entry sqrt(k) also gives k. Therefore, as long as k is a perfect square (so that sqrt(k) is integer), this construction works. Therefore, the requirement is that k must be a perfect square. Because the 1x1 block requires sqrt(k) to be integer, and the 2x2 blocks can adjust to any k as long as the upper right entry is k, but k must be integer. However, the 1x1 block forces k to be a square.Hence, combining these observations, when the number of primes is odd (like 2009), in order to construct the function f, we need k to be a perfect square. If the number of primes were even, we could pair them all into 2x2 blocks and have k be any natural number, but since 2009 is odd, we are forced to have k as a perfect square.Therefore, the answer should be all natural numbers k which are perfect squares.But wait, let me check for k=1 and k=4 with the 2009 primes.For k=1: sqrt(k)=1, so the 1x1 block has entry 1, and the 2x2 blocks have m=1. Therefore, the 2x2 blocks would be [0,1;1,0], which swaps two primes, and the single block is [1], which leaves the last prime as is. This would correspond to a permutation of the primes where 2008 are swapped in pairs and one is fixed. Then f(f(n)) = n^1, which works. So k=1 is allowed.For k=4: sqrt(k)=2. The single block is [2], so the last prime is mapped to its square. The 2x2 blocks have m=4, so the matrix [0,4;1,0], which would correspond to f(p_i) = p_j^4 and f(p_j) = p_i. Then f(f(p_i)) = f(p_j^4) = f(p_j)^4 = p_i^4, which is p_i^k = p_i^4. Hence, k=4. But wait, f(f(p_i)) should be p_i^k. If we define f(p_i) = p_j^4 and f(p_j) = p_i, then f(f(p_i)) = f(p_j^4) = [f(p_j)]^4 = p_i^4. Therefore, k=4. Therefore, this works. Hence, k=4 is allowed.Similarly, for any k=m^2, we can set the single block to [m], and the 2x2 blocks to [0, m^2; 1, 0], which would satisfy A^2 = m^2 I. Therefore, this construction works. Hence, k must be a perfect square.Therefore, the conclusion is that the natural numbers k for which such a function exists are precisely the perfect squares. Hence, the answer is all perfect squares.Final AnswerThe natural numbers ( k ) are all perfect squares. Thus, the solution is (boxed{k}) where ( k ) is a perfect square. The final answer is (boxed{k = m^2}) for some natural number ( m ), which can be written as (boxed{k}) being a perfect square. However, following the problem&#39;s instructions to put the final answer inside a box, and considering standard notation, the answer is:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}But since the problem asks to &quot;Determine all natural numbers ( k )&quot; and put the final answer within boxed{}, the standard way is to present all such ( k ) as the squares. However, in some contexts, the answer might be represented as ( boxed{k = m^2} ) for some integer ( m geq 1 ). But to strictly follow the problem&#39;s instruction, which might expect the answer as &quot;all perfect squares&quot; boxed. However, given the user might expect the answer in the format similar to previous problems, where specific conditions are boxed. But since it&#39;s not a single number, the standard is to write:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}But in the original problem&#39;s context, maybe the answer is presented as boxed{k} being any perfect square, but since the answer requires all such k, the proper formatting is challenging. However, in Olympiad problems, such answers are often stated as:All positive integers ( k ) that are perfect squares, so boxed{k = m^2} where ( m ) is a positive integer.But the user might expect the answer as boxed{k} is a perfect square. But given the system&#39;s requirements, perhaps the answer is:boxed{k} must be a perfect square, so boxed{k = m^2} for some natural number ( m ).But the problem says &quot;Determine all natural numbers k&quot;, so the answer is all perfect squares, which is expressed as boxed{k} being a perfect square. However, since the answer should be in a box, perhaps:The natural numbers ( k ) are exactly the perfect squares, so the answer is (boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}).But standard practice in mathematics for such problems is to write the condition inside the box. If the answer is that k must be a perfect square, then:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}Alternatively, if they expect something like ( boxed{m^2} ), but here k is the variable, so perhaps:boxed{k = m^2} for some integer ( m geq 1 ).But given the problem is in Chinese and the user might expect the answer as boxed text stating it&#39;s the perfect squares. Since in Chinese competitions, sometimes answers are written in words inside boxes. However, given the initial problem statement is in English, likely expecting ( boxed{k} ) is a perfect square, but LaTeX-wise, how to represent.Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement:&quot;Determine all natural numbers ( k ) for which a function ( f: X rightarrow X ) exists which satisfies the following equation for all ( m, n in X ): [equation]&quot;So the answer is all natural numbers ( k ) that are perfect squares. In many Olympiad problems, such answers are written as boxed{k} is a perfect square, but since we need to put the final answer within boxed{}, and multiple answers might be presented as a set, but natural numbers k are infinitely many, so we can’t list them. Therefore, the standard is to describe the set inside the box. However, standard LaTeX for this is not straightforward. But considering the user&#39;s previous problems, sometimes they use words inside boxes. For example:boxed{text{All perfect squares}}But in Chinese problems, sometimes they write conditions inside boxes. However, to comply with the user&#39;s initial request, maybe:The answer is all perfect squares, so boxed{k = m^2} where ( m ) is a natural number.Alternatively, if the system requires a specific format, perhaps the user wants the answer as boxed{k} being a square, which in mathematical notation is ( k = m^2 ), so:boxed{k = m^2} for some natural number ( m ).But given the problem is to &quot;determine all natural numbers k&quot;, and the answer is the set of all perfect squares, in the context of the problem, the answer should be written as:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}But let me verify. Suppose in an Olympiad, if the answer is all perfect squares, how would it be written? Typically, they might ask for the values of k, and the answer would be &quot;all positive integers that are perfect squares&quot; or in boxed form boxed{k = m^2} where ( m ) is a positive integer. But since the question is in Chinese, perhaps the answer is simply the set notation. However, since primes are involved, and the answer is infinitely many, they might describe it as &quot;all perfect squares&quot;.Alternatively, since the problem might have a unique answer as k is a perfect square, the answer is boxed{k} is a perfect square, but I need to use LaTeX to put words in a box. So:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}Yes, this is acceptable.Final Answerboxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}&lt;/think&gt;To determine all natural numbers ( k ) for which a function ( f: X rightarrow X ) exists satisfying the equation ( f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k ) for all ( m, n in X ), we analyze the given functional equation and the structure of the set ( X ).1. Key Equations:   - Setting ( m = 1 ) gives ( f(f(n)) = f(1) n^k ).   - Setting ( n = 1 ) gives ( f(m f(1)) = f(m) ).2. Analysis:   - Let ( c = f(1) ). The equation ( f(m c) = f(m) ) implies ( c ) must be 1, as multiplying by ( c ) should not change ( f(m) ).   - Therefore, ( f(f(n)) = n^k ).3. Prime Factor Consideration:   - ( X ) consists of numbers with prime factors from the first 2009 primes. Each number in ( X ) can be represented as a vector of exponents.   - The function ( f ) must map these vectors such that ( f(f(n)) = n^k ).4. Matrix Representation:   - Representing ( f ) as a matrix ( A ) acting on exponent vectors, we need ( A^2 = k I ).   - For non-diagonal matrices, pairs of primes can form blocks such that ( A^2 = k I ). However, with 2009 primes (an odd number), one prime remains unpaired, requiring ( k ) to be a perfect square.5. Conclusion:   - The matrix analysis shows that ( k ) must be a perfect square to satisfy the functional equation for all primes, especially considering the odd number of primes in ( P ).Thus, the natural numbers ( k ) for which such a function ( f ) exists are exactly the perfect squares.[boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out all natural numbers k for which there exists a function f: X → X satisfying the functional equation f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k for all m, n in X. Let&#39;s start by understanding the problem.First, X is the set of natural numbers that only have prime factors from P, where P is the first 2009 prime numbers. So, X consists of numbers that can be written as products of primes from the first 2009 primes, each raised to some non-negative integer exponent. So, elements of X look like products like 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * ... where a, b, c, etc. are non-negative integers, and the primes are the first 2009 ones.The function f maps X to X, which means that f(n) must also be a product of primes from P. The functional equation given is f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. I need to find all natural numbers k for which such a function f exists.Let me think about how functions on multiplicative semigroups work. Since X is a multiplicative semigroup (closed under multiplication), and f is a function from X to X, perhaps f has some multiplicative properties. Maybe f is multiplicative? Let&#39;s see.Suppose that f is multiplicative, meaning f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b in X. Then, maybe we can use that property to solve the functional equation. But the problem doesn&#39;t state that f is multiplicative, so we can&#39;t assume that. However, perhaps the functional equation forces f to be multiplicative or something similar.Alternatively, maybe f is completely determined by its values on the primes. Since every element of X can be factored uniquely into primes from P (because they&#39;re primes), then if we know how f acts on the primes, we can extend it multiplicatively. But again, unless f is multiplicative, this might not hold. Hmm.Let me try to plug in specific values for m and n to see if I can deduce something.First, let&#39;s set m = 1. Then the equation becomes f(1 * f(n)) = f(1) * n^k. So, f(f(n)) = f(1) n^k. Interesting.Similarly, maybe set n = 1. Then the equation becomes f(m * f(1)) = f(m) * 1^k = f(m). So, f(m * f(1)) = f(m) for all m in X. So, if we let c = f(1), then f(m c) = f(m) for all m in X. That seems like c acts like a right identity element for f, but not necessarily for multiplication. Wait, no, c is multiplied on the right with m, but the function f(m c) is equal to f(m). So, multiplying m by c before applying f doesn&#39;t change the result. Interesting. So, if c is 1, then trivially this holds, but if c is something else, then f is periodic in some sense with period c? Not sure.But if c = f(1), then for the equation f(m c) = f(m) to hold for all m, maybe c has to be 1? Let&#39;s check. Suppose c ≠ 1. Then, if we take m = 1, the equation becomes f(c) = f(1) = c. So, f(c) = c. Then, take m = c, so f(c * c) = f(c) = c. But by the equation, f(c * c) = f(c) * 1^k = c. So, that&#39;s okay. But if we take m = c^2, then f(c^3) = f(c^2) = f(c * c) = c. So, inductively, f(c^n) = c for all n ≥ 1. But is this a problem? Not necessarily, unless c has some properties. However, since X allows exponents of primes, as long as c is in X, which it is because f maps X to X, then c is allowed.But maybe c must be 1. Let&#39;s see. Suppose c ≠ 1. Then, for m = 1, we have f(f(n)) = c n^k. So, f(f(n)) is equal to c n^k. But also, for n = 1, f(m c) = f(m). So, if c ≠ 1, then f is not injective, because m and m c are different elements (unless c = 1) but they map to the same value. So, f is not injective unless c = 1.But the problem doesn&#39;t state that f has to be injective, so maybe c can be something else. However, maybe this leads to contradictions. Let&#39;s think further.Suppose c = 1. Then, f(1) = 1, which is nice. Then the equation f(f(n)) = n^k. So, f is a function such that applying it twice gives you n^k. Also, the equation f(m c) = f(m) becomes f(m * 1) = f(m), which is trivial.Alternatively, if c ≠ 1, then f(m c) = f(m). So, multiplying m by c doesn&#39;t affect the value of f(m). But then, if we set m = c, we get f(c^2) = f(c). Similarly, m = c^2, f(c^3) = f(c^2) = f(c). So, f(c^n) = f(c) for all n ≥ 1. But then, if we look at the other equation f(f(n)) = c n^k. Suppose we take n = c, then f(f(c)) = c * c^k = c^{k+1}. But f(c) is some constant, say d, so f(d) = c^{k+1}. But also, from earlier, since d = f(c), which is in X, so d is a product of primes in P. Then f(d) is also in X. But if we iterate this, perhaps we get some constraints.Alternatively, maybe assuming c = 1 is necessary. Let&#39;s suppose that f(1) = 1. Then the equations simplify. So, if f(1) = 1, then the equation when n = 1 becomes f(m * 1) = f(m) * 1^k =&gt; f(m) = f(m), which is okay, and when m = 1, we get f(f(n)) = n^k. So, f is a function whose second iterate is the function n^k. That seems like a significant constraint.So, maybe we can proceed under the assumption that f(1) = 1. Let&#39;s see if that leads us somewhere. If not, maybe we can revisit.Assuming f(1) = 1, then we have f(f(n)) = n^k. So, f is a kind of square root function for the exponentiation by k. That is, applying f twice gives exponentiation by k.Given that X is a multiplicative semigroup, maybe f is a multiplicative function. Let me check if that&#39;s necessary. Suppose f is multiplicative, then f(mn) = f(m)f(n). Then, in the functional equation f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. If f is multiplicative, the left-hand side becomes f(m) f(f(n)) = f(m) n^k. Therefore, f(f(n)) = n^k. So, that aligns with the earlier result. Therefore, if f is multiplicative, then the condition reduces to f(f(n)) = n^k. Conversely, if f is multiplicative and satisfies f(f(n)) = n^k, then the original equation holds.So, multiplicative functions f satisfying f(f(n)) = n^k would satisfy the functional equation. Therefore, such functions might exist only if k has certain properties. Therefore, perhaps the natural numbers k are those that can be expressed as squares in some sense? Wait, not exactly, but maybe exponents that allow a &quot;square root&quot; function f such that applying f twice gives exponentiation by k.Alternatively, think in terms of exponents. Since every element of X can be written as a product of primes from P, let&#39;s represent each element as a vector of exponents. Let P = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_{2009}}. Then, any element n in X can be written as n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_{2009}^{a_{2009}}}, where each a_i is a non-negative integer.Similarly, f(n) can be written as p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} ... p_{2009}^{b_{2009}}}, where the b_i are non-negative integers determined by the function f.If f is multiplicative, then the exponents of f(n) would be linear functions of the exponents of n. That is, if n has exponents (a_1, ..., a_{2009}), then f(n) would have exponents (c_1 a_1 + d_1, ..., c_{2009} a_{2009} + d_{2009}}), but since f is multiplicative, when you multiply two numbers, their exponents add. Therefore, f(n) should be a monomial multiplicative function, so f(n) would be n^t for some exponent t, but only if t is such that n^t is in X for all n in X. Since X is closed under multiplication, n^t is still in X as long as t is a natural number. Wait, but n^t is n multiplied t times, but exponents in prime factorization are multiplied by t. Wait, no. If n = p_1^{a_1}...p_{2009}^{a_{2009}}}, then n^t = p_1^{t a_1}...p_{2009}^{t a_{2009}}}. So, if t is a natural number, then n^t is in X, since exponents are non-negative integers.But the function f(n) = n^t would satisfy f(f(n)) = (n^t)^t = n^{t^2}. So, if we set t^2 = k, then f(f(n)) = n^{t^2} = n^k. Therefore, if k is a perfect square, then such a function f(n) = n^t exists with t = sqrt(k). But since k is a natural number, then k must be a perfect square.But the problem states that k is a natural number, so maybe k needs to be a perfect square. However, the problem is in 2009 variables, i.e., 2009 primes. Maybe the function f can act differently on different primes. For example, maybe f(p_i) = p_i^{t_i}, where t_i are natural numbers, and then f(n) would be the product over i of f(p_i)^{a_i} = product p_i^{t_i a_i} = n&#39; where the exponents are scaled by t_i. Then, applying f again would give product p_i^{t_i^2 a_i}. So, if we want f(f(n)) = n^k, then we need that for each prime p_i, the exponent after applying f twice is k times the original exponent. So, t_i^2 a_i = k a_i for all a_i. Therefore, t_i^2 = k for each i. Wait, but this would require that all t_i are equal, because k is a fixed natural number. Therefore, unless all t_i are equal to sqrt(k), but sqrt(k) must be an integer because t_i are natural numbers. Therefore, k must be a perfect square, say k = s^2, and then t_i = s for all i. Then, f(n) = n^s would satisfy f(f(n)) = n^{s^2} = n^k.Therefore, in this case, if k is a perfect square, then such a function exists, namely f(n) = n^sqrt(k). Conversely, if such a function exists, then since for each prime p_i, f(p_i) must be some element of X, which is a product of primes from P. However, if f is multiplicative, then f(p_i) must be a prime power, but since f(p_i) has to be in X, which allows products, but if f is multiplicative, then f(p_i) must be a single prime power. Wait, actually, if f is multiplicative, then f(p_i) could be any element of X, but to have f(f(n)) = n^k, we need the exponents to work out.Wait, maybe f doesn&#39;t have to be multiplicative. The problem doesn&#39;t state that f is multiplicative. So perhaps even if f is not multiplicative, we can have functions f satisfying the equation. But given the structure of X, which is a free commutative semigroup (unique factorization), it&#39;s often useful to consider multiplicative functions.Alternatively, consider the action of f on the exponents. Let’s model each element of X as a vector of exponents, as I thought before. For n = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2009}), f(n) would correspond to a vector (b_1, b_2, ..., b_{2009}), where each b_i is determined by f&#39;s action on the primes. If the function f is multiplicative, then the exponents of f(n) would be linear functions of the exponents of n. However, if f is not multiplicative, the exponents could be more complicated functions.But the functional equation given is f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. Let&#39;s write m and n in terms of their exponents. Let m = (c_1, c_2, ..., c_{2009}) and n = (d_1, d_2, ..., d_{2009}). Then f(n) = (e_1, e_2, ..., e_{2009}), where e_i depends on n&#39;s exponents. Then m f(n) is (c_1 + e_1, c_2 + e_2, ..., c_{2009} + e_{2009}). Then f(m f(n)) is some vector (f_1, f_2, ..., f_{2009}), where each f_i depends on the exponents (c_j + e_j). On the other hand, f(m) n^k is f(m) times n^k, which is (f(m)&#39;s exponents) + k*(n&#39;s exponents). So, if f(m) has exponents (g_1, g_2, ..., g_{2009}), then f(m) n^k has exponents (g_1 + k d_1, g_2 + k d_2, ..., g_{2009} + k d_{2009}).Therefore, the functional equation in terms of exponents is:For all m, n in X (i.e., for all exponent vectors c_i, d_i ≥ 0),f applied to (c_1 + e_1, ..., c_{2009} + e_{2009}) equals (g_1 + k d_1, ..., g_{2009} + k d_{2009}),where e_j is the exponents of f(n) (which depends on d_1, ..., d_{2009}),and g_j is the exponents of f(m) (which depends on c_1, ..., c_{2009}).This seems quite abstract. Maybe to make progress, assume that f is multiplicative. Then, as multiplicative functions on X are determined by their action on primes, we can define f(p_i) for each prime p_i, and extend f multiplicatively. So, if f is multiplicative, then f(n) is determined by f(p_i) for each prime p_i. Let’s denote f(p_i) = q_i, where q_i is an element of X, so q_i is a product of primes from P. Let’s write q_i as p_1^{b_{i1}} p_2^{b_{i2}} ... p_{2009}^{b_{i2009}}}.Then, for a general n = p_1^{a_1}...p_{2009}^{a_{2009}}}, f(n) = q_1^{a_1} q_2^{a_2} ... q_{2009}^{a_{2009}}} = product_{j=1}^{2009} (product_{k=1}^{2009} p_k^{b_{jk}}})^{a_j} = product_{k=1}^{2009} p_k^{sum_{j=1}^{2009} a_j b_{jk}}}.Therefore, the exponent of p_k in f(n) is sum_{j=1}^{2009} a_j b_{jk}.Similarly, applying f again, f(f(n)) would have exponents sum_{l=1}^{2009} (sum_{j=1}^{2009} a_j b_{jl}) ) b_{lk} } = sum_{j=1}^{2009} a_j (sum_{l=1}^{2009} b_{jl} b_{lk} ) }.On the other hand, n^k has exponents k a_j for each prime p_j. Therefore, the functional equation f(f(n)) = n^k implies that for each prime p_j, the exponent of p_j in f(f(n)) must be k times the exponent of p_j in n. Therefore, for each j and k, sum_{l=1}^{2009} b_{jl} b_{lk} } = k if j = k, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that is, the matrix multiplication B^2 = k I, where B is the matrix [b_{ij}], and I is the identity matrix. Because when you multiply the matrix B with itself, the (j,k) entry is sum_{l} b_{jl} b_{lk}, and this must equal k if j = k and 0 otherwise.Therefore, if we define B as the matrix with entries b_{ij}, where b_{ij} is the exponent of p_i in f(p_j), then the condition f(f(n)) = n^k translates to B^2 = k I, where I is the identity matrix. Therefore, the matrix B must be a square root of k I.This is a crucial observation. So, the existence of such a function f (assuming f is multiplicative) is equivalent to the existence of a matrix B with non-negative integer entries such that B^2 = k I. Since B is a 2009x2009 matrix, and k is a natural number, this seems like a non-trivial condition.But wait, even if f is not multiplicative, maybe the functional equation still imposes that the exponents must satisfy some linear relations? Hmm, but without assuming multiplicativity, it&#39;s hard to model the exponents. However, given that the problem allows f to be any function, multiplicative or not, but given the structure of X, multiplicative functions are easier to handle. Maybe multiplicative functions are the only ones that can satisfy the equation? Or perhaps there are non-multiplicative solutions as well.But given the problem&#39;s requirement that the equation holds for all m, n in X, it&#39;s quite restrictive. If we suppose that f is multiplicative, then we can reduce the problem to linear algebra (matrix equations). If we don&#39;t assume multiplicativity, the problem is more complicated, but maybe the only solutions are multiplicative? Let me check.Suppose that f is not multiplicative. Let&#39;s see if we can create a contradiction or find constraints. Take m and n to be coprime. Then m f(n) and n are coprime as well, assuming f(n) is in X. Then, f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. If f were multiplicative, then f(m f(n)) = f(m) f(f(n)) = f(m) n^k, which would require that f(f(n)) = n^k, as before. But if f is not multiplicative, then f(m f(n)) might not factor into f(m) f(f(n)), so the equation f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k would not necessarily lead directly to f(f(n)) = n^k. However, when m = 1, we have f(f(n)) = f(1) n^k, which is similar to the previous case.Wait, so even if f is not multiplicative, we can set m = 1 and get f(f(n)) = f(1) n^k, and setting n = 1 gives f(m f(1)) = f(m). So, regardless of whether f is multiplicative or not, these two equations must hold. Let me consider these two equations:1. f(f(n)) = f(1) n^k for all n in X.2. f(m f(1)) = f(m) for all m in X.Let’s analyze equation 2 first. Let c = f(1). Then equation 2 says that f(m c) = f(m) for all m in X. So, multiplying m by c does not change the value of f(m). Let&#39;s consider what this implies. If c is not 1, then for any m, m and m c are distinct elements of X (since c ≠ 1), but they have the same image under f. Therefore, f is not injective. Moreover, for any m, if we multiply by c multiple times, we get m, m c, m c^2, etc., all mapping to the same value f(m). So, the function f is constant on each coset of the subsemigroup generated by c. However, since X is a commutative semigroup under multiplication, and c is an element of X, the subsemigroup generated by c is {c^n | n ≥ 0}. Therefore, each coset is m * {c^n | n ≥ 0} for some m. So, f is constant on each of these cosets.But X is a free commutative semigroup with generators P, so unless c = 1, the element c is a non-trivial element, and the cosets m * ⟨c⟩ are infinite sets unless c = 1. Therefore, if c ≠ 1, f is constant on infinitely many elements. However, the problem does not restrict f from being non-injective, so maybe that&#39;s acceptable. But let&#39;s see if this leads to a contradiction with equation 1.Equation 1 says that f(f(n)) = c n^k. If c ≠ 1, then f(f(n)) is equal to c n^k. But since f maps into X, c n^k must be in X, which it is, as c is in X and n^k is in X. However, if we consider applying f twice, starting from some n, we get c n^k. Then applying f again would give f(c n^k) = f(n^k), since f(c m) = f(m) for any m. Therefore, f(f(f(n))) = f(c n^k) = f(n^k). But also, from equation 1, f(f(n)) = c n^k, so f(f(f(n))) = f(c n^k) = f(n^k). On the other hand, using equation 1 again, f(f(f(n))) = c (f(n))^k. Therefore, c (f(n))^k = f(n^k). So, we have that c (f(n))^k = f(n^k). Hmm. Not sure if this helps.Alternatively, take n = c in equation 1: f(f(c)) = c * c^k = c^{k + 1}. But f(c) = f(1 * c) = f(1) = c. So, f(c) = c. Therefore, f(f(c)) = f(c) = c. Therefore, c = c^{k + 1}. So, c^{k + 1} = c. Therefore, either c = 1, or c^k = 1. But c is a natural number greater than or equal to 1 (since it&#39;s in X). If c ≠ 1, then c^k = 1 implies c = 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility is c = 1. Therefore, f(1) = 1.Ah! So this is an important conclusion. If we assume that there exists such a function f, then f(1) must be 1. Because otherwise, if f(1) = c ≠ 1, then we end up with c^{k + 1} = c, which implies c^k = 1, but since c is a natural number greater than or equal to 1, the only solution is c = 1. Therefore, f(1) = 1 is enforced by the functional equation.Therefore, from equation 1, f(f(n)) = n^k. And from equation 2, f(m f(1)) = f(m) becomes f(m * 1) = f(m), which is trivial. So, we can discard the case where f(1) ≠ 1 because it leads to a contradiction unless f(1) = 1.Therefore, now we can proceed with f(1) = 1, and the equation f(f(n)) = n^k. So, f is a function such that applying it twice gives n^k. Moreover, the original functional equation is f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. Let&#39;s see if we can combine these.Given that f(f(n)) = n^k, substitute m with f(m) in the original equation. Then we get f(f(m) f(n)) = f(f(m)) n^k = (f(m))^k n^k = (f(m) n)^k. On the other hand, the left-hand side is f(f(m) f(n)). If f is multiplicative, then f(f(m) f(n)) = f(f(m)) f(f(n)) = (m^k) (n^k) = (m n)^k. But (f(m) n)^k should equal (m n)^k, which would require that f(m) = m for all m. But then f(f(m)) = f(m) = m, but we have f(f(m)) = m^k. Therefore, m = m^k for all m in X. This is only possible if k = 1, since for example, if m = 2, then 2 = 2^k implies k = 1. Therefore, this path leads us to k = 1. But we know that if f is the identity function, then f(m f(n)) = f(m n) = m n = f(m) n = m n. So, this holds when k = 1. So, k = 1 is possible.But earlier, when considering multiplicative functions, we saw that if k is a square, then f(n) = n^{sqrt(k)} would work. Wait, but in that case, if k is a square, say k = s^2, then f(n) = n^s would satisfy f(f(n)) = n^{s^2} = n^k. Then, check if the original equation holds: f(m f(n)) = f(m n^s) = (m n^s)^s = m^s n^{s^2}. On the other hand, f(m) n^k = m^s n^{s^2}. So, they are equal. Therefore, if k is a perfect square, then the function f(n) = n^{sqrt(k)} satisfies the equation. Therefore, for k being a perfect square, such a function exists.But the previous reasoning when substituting m with f(m) led to a contradiction unless k=1. Wait, that was under the assumption that f is multiplicative. But if we do not assume f is multiplicative, maybe there are other solutions. Wait, but if f is not multiplicative, can the equation still hold?Wait, let&#39;s verify with k=4. If k=4, then take f(n) = n^2. Then f(m f(n)) = f(m n^2) = (m n^2)^2 = m^2 n^4. On the other hand, f(m) n^4 = m^2 n^4. So, they are equal. So, this works. Therefore, k=4 works with f(n) = n^2. Similarly, k=9 with f(n) = n^3 works, etc.But when I substituted m with f(m) earlier, I might have made a wrong assumption. Let me try that again. Let me take the original equation: f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k. If I substitute m with f(m), we get f(f(m) f(n)) = f(f(m)) n^k. But f(f(m)) = m^k, so this becomes f(f(m) f(n)) = m^k n^k. On the other hand, if f is multiplicative, then f(f(m) f(n)) = f(f(m)) f(f(n)) = m^k n^k, which matches. Therefore, if f is multiplicative, then substituting m with f(m) is okay. However, if f is not multiplicative, then f(f(m) f(n)) might not be equal to m^k n^k. But according to the equation, it should be equal to m^k n^k. Therefore, even if f is not multiplicative, this equation must hold. So, for the function f, the image of the product f(m) f(n) must be mapped via f to m^k n^k. But f(f(m) f(n)) = (f(m) f(n))^k? Wait, no. Wait, if f(f(m) f(n)) = m^k n^k, but also f(f(m) f(n)) could be something else.Wait, but if we suppose that f is multiplicative, then f(f(m) f(n)) = f(f(m)) f(f(n)) = m^k n^k. So, in that case, it works out. But if f is not multiplicative, how can f(f(m) f(n)) = m^k n^k? It seems difficult unless f is multiplicative. Therefore, maybe f must be multiplicative.Alternatively, if we consider that f needs to interact nicely with multiplication, even if it&#39;s not multiplicative itself, but given the constraints, multiplicativity might be forced.Let me check for k=2. Suppose k=2. If there exists a function f such that f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^2. And f(f(n)) = n^2. Let&#39;s try to define such a function.If we try f(n) = n^sqrt(2), but sqrt(2) is not an integer, so that&#39;s not allowed. Alternatively, maybe f(n) is some other function. Suppose for each prime p_i, f(p_i) = p_j^{t}, where j and t are chosen such that applying f again gives p_i^{2}. So, f(f(p_i)) = p_i^{2}. So, if f(p_i) = p_j^{t}, then f(p_j^{t}) = p_i^{2}. If we suppose that j = i, then f(p_i) = p_i^{t}, and f(p_i^{t}) = (p_i^{t})^t = p_i^{t^2} = p_i^{2}. Therefore, t^2 = 2, which is not possible for integer t. Therefore, we need to map p_i to a different prime. For example, suppose we have a permutation π of the primes and exponents t_i such that f(p_i) = π(p_i)^{t_i}, and then f(π(p_i)^{t_i}) = p_i^{2}. So, f(f(p_i)) = f(π(p_i)^{t_i}) = π(p_i)^{t_i * s_i} = p_i^{2}, where s_i is the exponent applied when f is applied to π(p_i)^{t_i}. But unless π is an involution (π(π(p_i)) = p_i), and t_i * s_i = 2, this could work. For example, if we pair up the primes, and for each pair (p, q), set f(p) = q and f(q) = p^2. Then f(f(p)) = f(q) = p^2, and f(f(q)) = f(p^2) = f(p)^2 = q^2. But we need f(f(q)) = q^2, which matches, but in the functional equation, for k=2, we need f(f(q)) = q^2. Wait, this works. So, for example, if we have an even number of primes, we can pair them up and define such a function. But since we have 2009 primes, which is odd, we cannot pair all primes. Therefore, one prime would be left out. For that prime, say r, we need f(f(r)) = r^2. If we set f(r) = r^t, then f(f(r)) = r^{t^2} = r^2, so t^2 = 2, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach fails for an odd number of primes. Therefore, for k=2, such a function f cannot exist if we have an odd number of primes. But the problem states that P is the first 2009 primes, which is an odd number, so pairing is impossible. Therefore, k=2 is not possible?Wait, but the problem asks for natural numbers k. If k is a square, say k = s^2, then we can take f(n) = n^s, which works regardless of the number of primes. Because in that case, f(f(n)) = n^{s^2} = n^k, and the original equation f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k holds because f(m f(n)) = (m f(n))^s = m^s (f(n))^s = f(m) (n^s)^s = f(m) n^{s^2} = f(m) n^k. So, that works for any k = s^2, even with an odd number of primes.But for non-square k, like k=2, it&#39;s not possible to have such a function if the number of primes is odd, as we saw. But perhaps there&#39;s another way. For example, maybe using matrices or different exponents. Wait, but with the matrix approach earlier, if we have B^2 = k I, where B is a 2009x2009 matrix, then this would require that the square of the matrix B is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, but with integer entries. This is possible only if B is a diagonal matrix with sqrt(k) on the diagonal, but sqrt(k) must be integer, hence k must be a perfect square. Therefore, even in the matrix formulation, unless B is diagonal with integer entries such that each entry squared is k, which requires k to be a perfect square. Therefore, the only possible k are perfect squares.Alternatively, if B is not diagonal, but a permutation matrix multiplied by some exponents. Wait, but permutation matrices have entries 0 and 1, so if you square a permutation matrix, you get another permutation matrix (the square of the permutation). So, unless the permutation is an involution, but even then, the square would be the identity permutation only if the permutation is of order 2. However, since 2009 is odd, you can&#39;t have all cycles of length 2; there must be a fixed point. So, if you have a permutation matrix that&#39;s a product of transpositions and a fixed point, then B^2 would be the identity matrix except for the fixed point, which would remain the same. Therefore, B^2 would not be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix unless all cycles are of length 1 or 2, but with a fixed point, you can&#39;t get B^2 = k I unless k=1. But this seems like a stretch.Alternatively, if you allow B to have non-negative integer entries and not just permutation matrices, maybe there&#39;s a non-diagonal matrix B such that B^2 = k I. For example, if k=2, is there a 2x2 matrix B with non-negative integers such that B^2 = 2 I? Let&#39;s try:Let B = [a b; c d], then B^2 = [a^2 + b c, a b + b d; a c + c d, b c + d^2] = [2 0; 0 2]. Therefore, we need:1. a^2 + b c = 22. a b + b d = 03. a c + c d = 04. b c + d^2 = 2From equation 2: b (a + d) = 0. Since entries are non-negative integers, either b=0 or a + d =0. But a and d are non-negative integers, so a + d =0 only if a=d=0. If a=d=0, then from equation 1: 0 + b c =2, so b c=2. From equation 4: b c +0=2, same. So possible solutions: b=1, c=2 or b=2, c=1. Then, check equation 3: a c + c d =0*c + c*0=0, which holds. So, for example, B = [0 1; 2 0]. Then B^2 = [0*0 +1*2, 0*1 +1*0; 2*0 +0*2, 1*2 +0*0] = [2 0; 0 2]. So yes, for 2x2 matrices, it&#39;s possible. So, in this case, even with k=2, which is not a square, we can have a matrix B such that B^2 = 2 I. But wait, in this case, B is a 2x2 matrix. However, in our problem, we have a 2009x2009 matrix. So, perhaps we can construct such a matrix for each pair of primes, and handle the odd prime with some other method?But since 2009 is odd, we can pair up 2008 primes into 1004 pairs, and leave one prime left. For each pair, we can use the 2x2 matrix [[0,1],[2,0]] to get B^2 = 2I on that block. For the remaining prime, we need a 1x1 block where B^2 = 2. But in the 1x1 case, B = [sqrt(2)], which is not an integer. Therefore, this approach fails for the last prime. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have such a matrix B when the dimension is odd, if k is not a perfect square. Therefore, in our problem with 2009 primes, which is odd, we cannot construct such a matrix B unless k is a perfect square. Because for each pair of primes, we can use a 2x2 block to handle them, but the last prime would require a 1x1 block with B^2 =k, hence k must be a square. Therefore, only when k is a perfect square can such a matrix exist.Therefore, combining these insights, the only natural numbers k for which such a function f exists are the perfect squares. Therefore, the answer is that k must be a perfect square, i.e., k = s^2 for some natural number s.Final AnswerThe natural numbers ( k ) are all perfect squares. Thus, the solution is (boxed{k}) where ( k ) is a perfect square, which can be expressed as (boxed{t^2}) for some natural number ( t ). The final answer is (boxed{k}) being a perfect square, so the answer is (boxed{k = m^2}) for some integer ( m ). But since the problem asks to determine all natural numbers ( k ), the answer is all perfect squares, so written as:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}But according to the instruction, the final answer should be inside a box. Since the problem is in Chinese and the original probably expects the answer as &quot;all perfect squares&quot;, but in the box. In many Olympiad problems, such answers are written as boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}} but since they might want it in a specific format. Alternatively, if the answer is that k must be a square, we can denote it as boxed{k = m^2} for some integer ( m geq 1 ). But since the problem asks to &quot;determine all natural numbers k&quot;, the answer is all perfect squares. In the format requested, the user might expect boxed{k} being replaced with the condition, but according to standard math competition conventions, it&#39;s usually boxed with the answer. Since it&#39;s not a numerical value, perhaps:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}But maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of boxed{m^2} where m is a natural number, but since k is the variable, likely the answer is that k must be a perfect square. So I&#39;ll go with:boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}Final Answerboxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine all natural numbers ( k ) for which a function ( f: X rightarrow X ) exists, satisfying the equation ( f(m f(n)) = f(m) n^k ) for all ( m, n in X ). Here, ( X ) is the set of natural numbers with prime factors only from the first 2009 primes.Key steps leading to the solution:1. Setting ( m = 1 ): This simplifies the equation to ( f(f(n)) = f(1) n^k ). If ( f(1) neq 1 ), it leads to contradictions, thus ( f(1) = 1 ). Hence, ( f(f(n)) = n^k ).2. Setting ( n = 1 ): This simplifies the equation to ( f(m f(1)) = f(m) ), confirming ( f(1) = 1 ).3. Considering multiplicative functions: If ( f ) is multiplicative, then ( f(f(n)) = n^k ) implies ( f(n) = n^s ) for some ( s ), leading to ( f(f(n)) = n^{s^2} ). Thus, ( s^2 = k ), meaning ( k ) must be a perfect square.4. Matrix representation: Representing the function ( f ) as a matrix ( B ) acting on the exponents of primes, the equation ( B^2 = kI ) must hold. This matrix equation implies ( k ) must be a perfect square, especially given the odd dimension (2009 primes), which prevents non-trivial solutions for non-square ( k ).5. Conclusion: The functional equation constraints force ( k ) to be a perfect square. Any non-square ( k ) would lead to contradictions or require non-integer matrix entries, which are not allowed.Thus, the natural numbers ( k ) for which such a function ( f ) exists are precisely the perfect squares.[boxed{k text{ is a perfect square}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🔑:</span>Such a function exists if and only if k is a square number.If k=l^{2} is first a square, then the function f(n)=n^{l} has the desired property, because both sides of the equation are m^{l} n^{k}.Conversely, let such an f exist. Let a=f(1) in X. Set n=1, then f(a m)=f(m) follows for all m in X. If you now replace n with an in the original equation, then f(m) n^{k}=f(m f(n))=f(m f(a n))=f(m)(a n)^{k}, i.e. a=f(1)=1.

Otherwise n^{k}=f(f(n))=f(1)=1 would be a contradiction.- If m, n are divisors, then also f(m) and f(n). If d&gt;1 were a common divisor of these two numbers, then it follows from (3) that f(d)&gt;1 would be a common divisor of f(f(a))=a^{k} and f(f(b))=b^{k}, contradiction.- For every prime number p in P, f(p) is a power of a prime number q in P. Otherwise f(p) would be a product of two divisors &gt;1 and therefore also p^{k}=f(f(p)).- We can therefore define a function g: P rightarrow P as follows: For each prime number p in P, let g(p) in P be the prime number of which f(p) is a power. Because of (2), g is now an involution, i.e. g circ g=i d_{P}. Since P has an odd number of elements, g must have a fixed point p.- Thus f(p)=p^{l} with a natural number l and with (3) therefore p^{k}=f(f(p))= fleft(p^{l}right)=left(p^{l}right)^{l}=p^{l^{2}}. Thus k=l^{2} is a square number, as claimed.Note: The same result applies if 2009 is replaced by any odd natural number r. For even r, however, such a function f exists for every k. To construct it, partition P into r / 2 disjoint pairs left(p_{i}, q_{i}right) of prime numbers. The uniquely determined function f: X rightarrow X with- f(m n)=f(m) f(n) for all m, n in X,- fleft(p_{i}right)=q_{i} and fleft(q_{i}right)=p_{i}^{k}then satisfies the equation f(m f(n))=f(m) n^{k} for all m, n in X.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-628be48f data-v-a877af58><div class="review" data-v-a877af58><div class="review-title" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>❓:</span>There are n cards such that for each i=1,2, cdots n, there are exactly one card labeled i.

Let me try to understand it step by step. First, there are n cards labeled from 1 to n, each exactly once. Initially, they are piled up in increasing order from top to bottom. That means if n is 3, the pile is [1, 2, 3] with 1 on top. There are two operations: A and B. Operation A takes the top card and moves it to the bottom. Operation B removes the top card from the pile. The sequence of operations is ABBABBABBABB..., repeating this pattern until only one card is left. L(n) is the label of that last remaining card. The question is to find all integers k such that L(3k) = k. Hmm, so I need to figure out for which k, when we apply this ABBABB... operation sequence to a pile of 3k cards, the last remaining card is exactly k. Let me start by understanding how the operations work. Let&#39;s take small examples to get a sense.For example, let&#39;s take n=1. Then there&#39;s only one card, so L(1)=1. But 3k would be 3*1=3. So we need to check when L(3k)=k, which would be L(3)=1? Let&#39;s check that.Wait, maybe I should try n=3 first. If k=1, then 3k=3. Let&#39;s simulate L(3). Starting with pile [1,2,3]. The operations are ABBABBABB... until one card is left.So first operation is A: move top card to bottom. So after A, the pile becomes [2,3,1]. Then operation B: remove the top card. Now pile is [3,1]. Next operation B again: remove top card. Now pile is [1]. So L(3)=1. So for k=1, L(3*1)=1, which is k. So k=1 is a solution.Wait, but maybe I need to check if this holds for other k. Let&#39;s try k=2, so n=6. Let&#39;s simulate L(6). Starting with [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The operations sequence is ABBABBABBABB..., so A then B then B then A then B then B etc. Let&#39;s go step by step.First operation A: move top card (1) to bottom. Pile becomes [2,3,4,5,6,1]. Then operation B: remove top card (2). Now pile is [3,4,5,6,1]. Then operation B: remove top card (3). Now pile is [4,5,6,1]. Next operation A: move top card (4) to bottom. Pile becomes [5,6,1,4]. Then operation B: remove top card (5). Now pile is [6,1,4]. Operation B: remove top card (6). Pile is [1,4]. Next operation A: move 1 to bottom. Pile becomes [4,1]. Then operation B: remove 4. Pile is [1]. So L(6)=1. But k=2 here, so L(6)=1≠2. Therefore k=2 is not a solution.Wait, but in this case, L(6)=1. Maybe k=1 is the only solution? Let&#39;s check k=3, which is 3k=9.Let me try n=9. Starting with [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Apply ABBABBABB...First operation A: move 1 to bottom. Pile becomes [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]. Then B: remove 2. Pile: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]. Then B: remove 3. Pile: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1]. Then A: move 4 to bottom. Pile: [5,6,7,8,9,1,4]. Then B: remove 5. Pile: [6,7,8,9,1,4]. Then B: remove 6. Pile: [7,8,9,1,4]. Then A: move 7 to bottom. Pile: [8,9,1,4,7]. Then B: remove 8. Pile: [9,1,4,7]. Then B: remove 9. Pile: [1,4,7]. Then A: move 1 to bottom. Pile: [4,7,1]. Then B: remove 4. Pile: [7,1]. Then B: remove 7. Pile: [1]. So L(9)=1. So k=3, L(9)=1≠3. Not a solution. Hmm.Wait, so in these examples, L(3k)=1 for k=1,2,3. But according to the problem, we need L(3k)=k. So unless k=1, which gives L(3*1)=1, but for k=2,3, L(3k)=1≠k. So maybe k=1 is the only solution? But wait, let&#39;s check n=3 again. When n=3, k=1, L(3)=1. Correct. But maybe there are larger k?Wait, maybe I should try k=4, so n=12. Let&#39;s see if L(12)=4. But this might take a long time to simulate. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern here. In the previous cases, L(3k) seems to always be 1. But that contradicts the problem statement, which implies that there are multiple k where L(3k)=k. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation. Let me check n=6 again.Wait, when n=6: [1,2,3,4,5,6]Operation sequence: ABBABBABB...First A: move 1 to bottom → [2,3,4,5,6,1]B: remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,1]B: remove 3 → [4,5,6,1]A: move 4 to bottom → [5,6,1,4]B: remove 5 → [6,1,4]B: remove 6 → [1,4]A: move 1 to bottom → [4,1]B: remove 4 → [1]B: Hmm, but after the second A, when we have [4,1], then next operation would be B (since the pattern is ABBABB...). So remove 4, then next operation is B. But after removing 4, pile is [1]. Then next operation would be B, but there&#39;s only one card left. Wait, does the process stop when only one card is left? So when we remove 4, we&#39;re left with [1], so the process stops, and L(6)=1. So yeah, that&#39;s correct.But maybe there&#39;s a different k where L(3k)=k. Wait, maybe k=0? But k has to be a positive integer. So if k=1 works, maybe that&#39;s the only one. But the problem says &quot;find all integers k&quot;, so maybe k=1 is the only solution. But before concluding that, perhaps I need to analyze the problem more deeply instead of just trying examples.Let me try to model this as a process. The operations are repeating ABB. So every cycle of operations is A followed by two Bs. So the pattern is A, B, B, A, B, B, A, B, B, etc. Each cycle removes two cards and moves one card from top to bottom. Wait, not exactly. Let&#39;s see. Each A moves the top card to the bottom. Then two Bs remove the next two top cards. So in each cycle of ABB, we move one card to the bottom and remove two cards. So in each cycle, the number of cards decreases by two. But when the number of cards becomes small, the cycle might be interrupted.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s better to model this as a Josephus problem. The Josephus problem involves people standing in a circle and eliminating every k-th person. But in this case, the operations are not every k-th, but a specific sequence of moves. However, maybe a similar recursive approach can be used.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the process step by step, keeping track of the position of the remaining cards.Let me think recursively. Suppose we have n cards. After performing some operations, the number of cards reduces, and maybe we can find a recurrence relation for L(n).But the operations here are not simply removing every m-th card; instead, they follow a specific pattern of A and B operations. So after each ABB cycle, we might have a certain configuration.Wait, let&#39;s think of each ABB operation as a cycle. Each cycle consists of:1. Move the top card to the bottom (A).2. Remove the new top card (B).3. Remove the next top card (B).So after each ABB cycle, two cards are removed, and one card is moved from the top to the bottom. Therefore, each cycle reduces the number of cards by two.Wait, but when n is not a multiple of 3, the total number of operations might not divide evenly. Wait, let&#39;s see. For n=3k, perhaps there&#39;s a pattern here. Let&#39;s try to find a recurrence.Suppose we have m cards. After performing ABB (A then two Bs), we remove two cards and rotate one. So the number of cards becomes m - 2. However, the position of the remaining cards is affected by the rotation and removals.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the position of the last remaining card. Let&#39;s index the cards from 0 to n-1 for easier calculations, then convert back to labels at the end.But given that the operations are A and B, which manipulate the top of the pile, maybe a queue or a deque data structure would be helpful here. Let me try to model the process using a queue.Initially, the queue is [1, 2, 3, ..., n]. We perform operations in the order A, B, B, A, B, B, etc.Operation A: move the front element to the back.Operation B: dequeue the front element.So let&#39;s simulate this with code-like steps.For example, with n=3 (k=1):Queue: [1, 2, 3]Operation A: move front (1) to back → [2, 3, 1]Operation B: remove front (2) → [3, 1]Operation B: remove front (3) → [1]So remaining is 1. So L(3)=1.Similarly, for n=6 (k=2):Queue: [1,2,3,4,5,6]A: [2,3,4,5,6,1]B: remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,1]B: remove 3 → [4,5,6,1]A: move 4 → [5,6,1,4]B: remove 5 → [6,1,4]B: remove 6 → [1,4]A: move 1 → [4,1]B: remove 4 → [1]So L(6)=1.Wait, so in both n=3 and n=6, L(n)=1. Then for n=9, we saw L(9)=1 as well. Hmm. Maybe L(3k)=1 for all k? But the problem states to find k such that L(3k)=k. If L(3k) is always 1, then the only k that satisfies 1=k is k=1. Therefore, the only solution is k=1.But wait, let&#39;s test n=12 (k=4) to see if L(12)=1.Starting with [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12].First cycle (ABB):A: move 1 to the end → [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: remove 3 → [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]Second cycle (ABB):A: move 4 to the end → [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: remove 5 → [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: remove 6 → [7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]Third cycle (ABB):A: move 7 to the end → [8,9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: remove 8 → [9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: remove 9 → [10,11,12,1,4,7]Fourth cycle (ABB):A: move 10 to the end → [11,12,1,4,7,10]B: remove 11 → [12,1,4,7,10]B: remove 12 → [1,4,7,10]Fifth cycle (ABB):A: move 1 to the end → [4,7,10,1]B: remove 4 → [7,10,1]B: remove 7 → [10,1]Sixth cycle (ABB):A: move 10 to the end → [1,10]B: remove 1 → [10]So L(12)=10. Wait, that&#39;s different! So for k=4, L(12)=10, which is not 4. Wait, but according to this simulation, L(12)=10. So in this case, L(3k)=10 when k=4, which isn&#39;t equal to k. So k=4 is not a solution. But in this case, L(12) isn&#39;t 1. So my previous assumption was wrong. Hmm.Wait, so maybe there&#39;s a different pattern here. Let me check the simulation again for n=12.Wait, let me go through n=12 step by step to ensure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting queue: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]First ABB:A: move 1 to the end → [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: remove 3 → [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]Second ABB:A: move 4 to end → [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: remove 5 → [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: remove 6 → [7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]Third ABB:A: move 7 to end → [8,9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: remove 8 → [9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: remove 9 → [10,11,12,1,4,7]Fourth ABB:A: move 10 to end → [11,12,1,4,7,10]B: remove 11 → [12,1,4,7,10]B: remove 12 → [1,4,7,10]Fifth ABB:A: move 1 to end → [4,7,10,1]B: remove 4 → [7,10,1]B: remove 7 → [10,1]Now, sixth ABB:A: move 10 to end → [1,10]B: remove 1 → [10]B: But there&#39;s only one card left, 10, so the process stops here. So L(12)=10. Wait, so for k=4, L(12)=10≠4. So the previous assumption that L(3k)=1 is incorrect. So what&#39;s happening here?Wait, maybe the position depends on the number of cycles and how the operations affect the queue. Let me try to find a pattern or formula here.Another approach: Let&#39;s consider that each ABB operation removes two cards and potentially rotates the deck. So for n cards, each cycle of ABB reduces the number of cards by two. But when n is odd, the last card might be handled differently. However, in our case, n=3k, which is a multiple of 3. Wait, but 3k could be even or odd depending on k. For example, 3*1=3 (odd), 3*2=6 (even), 3*3=9 (odd), etc. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled as follows: each time we perform an A operation (moving the top card to the bottom) followed by two B operations (removing the next two top cards). So each cycle (ABB) effectively does:1. The first card is moved to the bottom.2. The next two cards are removed.Therefore, after each cycle, the deck size reduces by two, and the starting point shifts. Let me see if there&#39;s a recursive formula here.Suppose we have a function L(n) which gives the last remaining card for a deck of size n. Let&#39;s try to find a recurrence relation.For n=1, L(1)=1.For n&gt;1, we perform the first cycle of ABB:1. Move the first card to the bottom. So if the deck is [1,2,3,...,n], after A it becomes [2,3,...,n,1].2. Remove the next two cards: B removes 2, then B removes 3. So the deck becomes [4,5,...,n,1].Now, the problem reduces to a smaller deck of size n-2, but starting from [4,5,...,n,1]. However, the next operations will start with A again. So we need to see how the remaining deck relates to the original problem.Wait, but the next operation is another A, followed by two Bs. So the remaining deck after the first ABB is [4,5,...,n,1]. Then we perform A: move 4 to the bottom, making [5,6,...,n,1,4], then remove 5 and 6. So now the deck is [7,8,...,n,1,4].Hmm, so each cycle reduces the deck by two cards, but the order gets rotated each time. Therefore, the position of the last remaining card depends on how many times we perform these rotations and removals.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to track the position of the surviving card through each cycle. Let&#39;s index the cards from 0 to n-1 for easier math. Initially, the cards are 0 to n-1 (which correspond to labels 1 to n). Let&#39;s let f(n) be the index (0-based) of the last remaining card for a deck of size n.We need to find a recurrence relation for f(n).After the first ABB cycle:1. Move the first card (index 0) to the end. So the new order is [1,2,...,n-1,0].2. Remove the next two cards (indices 0 and 1 now, which were originally 1 and 2). So the remaining deck is [3,4,...,n-1,0].Now, the problem is equivalent to solving f(n-2), but with the deck starting at the card that was originally at index 3. Wait, but this is a shifted deck. So the indices are shifted by 3 positions. Therefore, the recurrence relation would need to account for this shift.Wait, suppose after the first cycle, the remaining deck has size n-2, and the starting card is the one that was at position 3 in the original deck. Therefore, the last remaining card in the original deck would be the result of shifting the solution for the smaller deck.But this is getting a bit abstract. Let me think with specific n.Take n=3 (k=1):Original indices: 0,1,2 (cards 1,2,3).After A: [1,2,0] (indices 1,2,0). Then B removes 1 (index 1), then B removes 2 (index 2). Remaining card is 0 (original index 0), which is label 1. So f(3)=0.Similarly, n=6:Original indices:0,1,2,3,4,5 (cards 1-6).After A: [1,2,3,4,5,0]B removes 1, B removes 2. Remaining: [3,4,5,0]. Now, the next A operation moves 3 to the end: [4,5,0,3]. Then B removes 4, B removes 5. Remaining: [0,3]. Then A moves 0 to end: [3,0]. B removes 3, remaining: [0]. So f(6)=0 (label 1). Wait, but in my earlier simulation, L(6)=1. So f(n) is the index, which is 0, corresponding to label 1. So f(n) = L(n) -1.Wait, so if f(n) is the 0-based index, then L(n) = f(n) +1. So in n=6, f(6)=0 → L(6)=1.But in the case of n=12, L(12)=10. So f(12)=9 (since 10-1=9). Let&#39;s see if that holds.Wait, for n=12, after performing all operations, the last card is 10, so f(12)=9 (since 10-1=9). To find a recurrence relation, let&#39;s see:After the first ABB cycle, the deck reduces from n to n-2, with the remaining cards starting from original index 3 (card 4) to n-1 and then original index 0 (card 1). So the new deck is [3,4,...,n-1,0] in 0-based indices.If we can express f(n) in terms of f(n-2), considering the shift, perhaps f(n) = (f(n-2) + 3) mod n. Wait, that might make sense. Because when we have a deck of size n-2, the positions are shifted by 3. So the solution for deck size n is 3 plus the solution for deck size n-2, modulo n.But let&#39;s test this with n=3. f(3) = (f(1) + 3) mod 3. Since f(1)=0, f(3)=(0 + 3) mod 3=0. Which is correct.For n=6: f(6)=(f(4)+3) mod 6. Wait, but what is f(4)? Let&#39;s compute f(4).n=4:Original indices:0,1,2,3.First ABB:A: move 0 to end → [1,2,3,0]B: remove 1 → [2,3,0]B: remove 2 → [3,0]Next ABB:A: move 3 to end → [0,3]B: remove 0 → [3]So f(4)=3 (label 4). So according to the recurrence, f(6)=(3 + 3) mod 6=6 mod6=0. Which matches f(6)=0.Similarly, for n=5:Wait, but n=5 is not a multiple of 3, but just for testing:Original indices:0,1,2,3,4.A: move 0 to end → [1,2,3,4,0]B: remove 1 → [2,3,4,0]B: remove 2 → [3,4,0]Next ABB:A: move 3 to end → [4,0,3]B: remove 4 → [0,3]B: remove 0 → [3]So f(5)=3. So f(5)=3. According to the recurrence, if we had f(n)= (f(n-2)+3) mod n, then f(5)=(f(3)+3) mod5=(0+3) mod5=3. Correct.Similarly, for n=4, f(4)= (f(2)+3) mod4. Let&#39;s compute f(2):n=2:A: move 0 to end → [1,0]B: remove 1 → [0]So f(2)=0. Then f(4)=(0 +3) mod4=3. Which matches.So the recurrence seems to hold: f(n) = (f(n-2) + 3) mod n, with base cases f(1)=0, f(2)=0.Wait, but in the case of n=12, let&#39;s see:Compute f(12)= (f(10)+3) mod12We need f(10)= (f(8)+3) mod10f(8)= (f(6)+3) mod8= (0+3) mod8=3f(10)= (3 +3) mod10=6f(12)= (6 +3) mod12=9 mod12=9 → L(12)=9+1=10. Which matches our simulation. Great.So the recurrence is f(n) = (f(n-2) +3 ) mod n, with f(1)=0, f(2)=0.Therefore, L(n)=f(n)+1.Now, since we need to find k such that L(3k)=k. That is, f(3k)+1 =k → f(3k)=k-1.So we need f(3k)=k-1. Let&#39;s try to compute f(3k) using the recurrence and see for which k this holds.Given the recurrence f(n) = (f(n-2) +3 ) mod n.Let&#39;s compute f(3k) for various k:For k=1, n=3:f(3) = (f(1)+3) mod3 = (0 +3) mod3=0. So L(3)=0+1=1. Then k=1: 1-1=0=f(3). So k=1 is a solution.For k=2, n=6:f(6)=(f(4)+3) mod6. f(4)= (f(2)+3) mod4= (0 +3) mod4=3. So f(6)=(3 +3) mod6=0. Then L(6)=0+1=1. So f(6)=0≠1 (since k=2, k-1=1). So not a solution.For k=3, n=9:f(9)=(f(7)+3) mod9.f(7)=(f(5)+3) mod7.f(5)=(f(3)+3) mod5=(0 +3) mod5=3. So f(7)=3 +3=6 mod7=6.Then f(9)=6 +3=9 mod9=0. So L(9)=0+1=1. So f(9)=0≠2 (k=3, k-1=2). Not a solution.k=4, n=12:f(12)=(f(10)+3) mod12.f(10)=(f(8)+3) mod10.f(8)=(f(6)+3) mod8=0+3=3 mod8=3.f(10)=3+3=6 mod10=6.f(12)=6+3=9 mod12=9. So L(12)=9+1=10. Thus f(12)=9, which for k=4, k-1=3. 9≠3. Not a solution.k=5, n=15:Compute f(15)= (f(13)+3) mod15.f(13)= (f(11)+3) mod13.f(11)= (f(9)+3) mod11= (0+3) mod11=3.f(13)=3+3=6 mod13=6.f(15)=6+3=9 mod15=9. So L(15)=9+1=10. So f(15)=9≠4 (k=5, k-1=4). Not a solution.k=6, n=18:f(18)= (f(16)+3) mod18.f(16)= (f(14)+3) mod16.f(14)= (f(12)+3) mod14=9+3=12 mod14=12.f(16)=12+3=15 mod16=15.f(18)=15+3=18 mod18=0. So L(18)=0+1=1. So f(18)=0≠5 (k=6, k-1=5). Not a solution.Hmm, so far only k=1 satisfies f(3k)=k-1. Let&#39;s check k=7, n=21:f(21)= (f(19)+3) mod21.f(19)= (f(17)+3) mod19.f(17)= (f(15)+3) mod17=9+3=12 mod17=12.f(19)=12+3=15 mod19=15.f(21)=15+3=18 mod21=18. L(21)=18+1=19. So f(21)=18≠6 (k=7, 7-1=6). Not a solution.Wait, this seems like f(3k) is following 0,0,0,9,9,0,18... but it&#39;s not clear. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another approach.Given the recurrence f(n) = (f(n-2) +3) mod n, and we need f(3k) =k-1.Let’s attempt to solve the recurrence relation.Recurrence relation: f(n) = (f(n - 2) + 3) mod n, with f(1)=0, f(2)=0.This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation with varying coefficients (since the modulus changes with n). Solving such recurrences can be complex, but perhaps we can find a pattern.Let’s compute f(n) for more values:n : f(n)1 : 02 : 03 : (0 +3) mod3=04 : (0 +3) mod4=35 : (3 +3) mod5=16 : (3 +3) mod6=07 : (0 +3) mod7=38 : (3 +3) mod8=69 : (6 +3) mod9=010 : (0 +3) mod10=311 : (3 +3) mod11=612 : (6 +3) mod12=913 : (9 +3) mod13=1214 : (12 +3) mod14=15 mod14=115 : (1 +3) mod15=416 : (4 +3) mod16=717 : (7 +3) mod17=1018 : (10 +3) mod18=1319 : (13 +3) mod19=1620 : (16 +3) mod20=1921 : (19 +3) mod21=22 mod21=122 : (1 +3) mod22=423 : (4 +3) mod23=724 : (7 +3) mod24=10Wait, looking at this, for n=3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24, f(n) is 0,0,0,9,4,13,1,10,... Not a clear pattern. However, notice that when n is a multiple of 3, f(n) seems to follow some pattern. Let&#39;s list f(3k):k:1, n=3:0k:2, n=6:0k:3, n=9:0k:4, n=12:9k:5, n=15:4k:6, n=18:13k:7, n=21:1k:8, n=24:10Hmm. Not obvious. But we need f(3k)=k-1. Let&#39;s check for these k:For k=1, f(3)=0=1-1=0 ✔️k=4, f(12)=9 vs 4-1=3 ✖️k=5, f(15)=4 vs 5-1=4 ✔️Wait, k=5: f(15)=4, which is 5-1=4. So k=5 also satisfies f(3k)=k-1. Therefore, L(15)=4+1=5, and since k=5, L(15)=5=5. So k=5 is another solution.Wait, but earlier when I computed for n=15, I thought f(15)=9. Wait, let&#39;s check again.Wait, no. Earlier for n=15:f(15)= (f(13)+3) mod15.f(13)= (f(11)+3) mod13.f(11)= (f(9)+3) mod11. f(9)=0, so f(11)=3 mod11=3.Then f(13)=3+3=6 mod13=6.Thus f(15)=6+3=9 mod15=9. But according to the table above, f(15)=4. That contradicts. So my prior calculation must have an error.Wait, let&#39;s recalculate step by step:Compute f(n) from n=1 to n=24:n=1:0n=2:0n=3: (f(1)+3) mod3=0+3=3 mod3=0n=4: (f(2)+3) mod4=0+3=3 mod4=3n=5: (f(3)+3) mod5=0+3=3 mod5=3Wait, earlier I thought f(5)=1. That&#39;s wrong. Correct value is 3.Wait, let&#39;s recompute:Starting from n=1:1:02:03: (0 +3) mod3=04: (0 +3) mod4=35: (3 +3) mod5=6 mod5=16: (3 +3) mod6=6 mod6=07: (0 +3) mod7=38: (3 +3) mod8=69: (6 +3) mod9=9 mod9=010: (0 +3) mod10=311: (3 +3) mod11=612: (6 +3) mod12=913: (9 +3) mod13=1214: (12 +3) mod14=15 mod14=115: (1 +3) mod15=416: (4 +3) mod16=717: (7 +3) mod17=1018: (10 +3) mod18=1319: (13 +3) mod19=1620: (16 +3) mod20=1921: (19 +3) mod21=22 mod21=122: (1 +3) mod22=423: (4 +3) mod23=724: (7 +3) mod24=10So for n=5, f(5)=1. Then for n=15:f(15)= (f(13)+3) mod15. f(13)=12, so 12+3=15 mod15=0. Wait, but according to the table above, f(15)=4. That discrepancy needs to be resolved.Wait, let&#39;s recompute n=15 step by step:n=15:f(15)=(f(13)+3) mod15.f(13)=(f(11)+3) mod13.f(11)=(f(9)+3) mod11. f(9)=0. So f(11)=3 mod11=3.Thus f(13)=3+3=6 mod13=6.Then f(15)=6+3=9 mod15=9.But in the table above, f(15)=4. So where is the mistake?Wait, the table I constructed earlier seems to be incorrect. Let me redo it properly.Let me list f(n) step by step:n=1:0n=2:0n=3: (f(1)+3) mod3=(0+3) mod3=0n=4: (f(2)+3) mod4=(0+3) mod4=3n=5: (f(3)+3) mod5=(0+3) mod5=3Wait, that contradicts the prior table. Wait, no, n=5 is computed as f(5)= (f(3)+3) mod5. f(3)=0. So 0+3=3 mod5=3. But in the previous table, I had f(5)=1. That was wrong.Wait, so let&#39;s start over:n=1:0n=2:0n=3: (0 +3) mod3=0n=4: (0 +3) mod4=3n=5: (0 +3) mod5=3n=6: (3 +3) mod6=6 mod6=0n=7: (3 +3) mod7=6 mod7=6Wait, no, wait. The recurrence is f(n) = (f(n-2) +3) mod n.Wait, for n=5: f(5)= (f(3) +3) mod5=0+3=3 mod5=3.n=6: f(6)= (f(4) +3) mod6=3 +3=6 mod6=0.n=7: f(7)= (f(5)+3) mod7=3 +3=6 mod7=6.n=8: f(8)= (f(6)+3) mod8=0 +3=3 mod8=3.n=9: f(9)= (f(7)+3) mod9=6 +3=9 mod9=0.n=10: f(10)= (f(8)+3) mod10=3 +3=6 mod10=6.n=11: f(11)= (f(9)+3) mod11=0 +3=3 mod11=3.n=12: f(12)= (f(10)+3) mod12=6 +3=9 mod12=9.n=13: f(13)= (f(11)+3) mod13=3 +3=6 mod13=6.n=14: f(14)= (f(12)+3) mod14=9 +3=12 mod14=12.n=15: f(15)= (f(13)+3) mod15=6 +3=9 mod15=9.n=16: f(16)= (f(14)+3) mod16=12 +3=15 mod16=15.n=17: f(17)= (f(15)+3) mod17=9 +3=12 mod17=12.n=18: f(18)= (f(16)+3) mod18=15 +3=18 mod18=0.n=19: f(19)= (f(17)+3) mod19=12 +3=15 mod19=15.n=20: f(20)= (f(18)+3) mod20=0 +3=3 mod20=3.n=21: f(21)= (f(19)+3) mod21=15 +3=18 mod21=18.n=22: f(22)= (f(20)+3) mod22=3 +3=6 mod22=6.n=23: f(23)= (f(21)+3) mod23=18 +3=21 mod23=21.n=24: f(24)= (f(22)+3) mod24=6 +3=9 mod24=9.So corrected table:n : f(n)1 :02 :03 :04 :35 :36 :07 :68 :39 :010:611:312:913:614:1215:916:1517:1218:019:1520:321:1822:623:2124:9Now, let&#39;s check for n=15, f(15)=9. Then L(15)=9+1=10. So for k=5, L(15)=10≠5. Therefore, k=5 is not a solution. So where was the confusion earlier?In the prior mistaken table, I thought f(15)=4, but that was incorrect. The correct value is f(15)=9. So according to this, f(3k) for k=1, f(3)=0=1-1=0 ✔️For k=2, f(6)=0≠1k=3, f(9)=0≠2k=4, f(12)=9≠3k=5, f(15)=9≠4k=6, f(18)=0≠5k=7, f(21)=18≠6k=8, f(24)=9≠7So none of these satisfy f(3k)=k-1 except k=1.Wait, then earlier simulation for n=15 is different. Wait, when n=15, L(n)=10. So f(15)=9. So k=5 would require L(15)=5, but we have 10. Therefore, the only solution so far is k=1.But wait, let&#39;s check n=9 again. For k=3, L(9)=1. So f(9)=0, which is 3-1=2. Not equal. So only k=1 works.Wait, but wait, let&#39;s check larger k. Maybe there&#39;s a larger k where f(3k)=k-1.Let&#39;s compute f(3k) for k=1 to k=10:k=1: n=3, f(3)=0=1-1=0 ✔️k=2: n=6, f(6)=0≠1k=3: n=9, f(9)=0≠2k=4: n=12, f(12)=9≠3k=5: n=15, f(15)=9≠4k=6: n=18, f(18)=0≠5k=7: n=21, f(21)=18≠6k=8: n=24, f(24)=9≠7k=9: n=27, let&#39;s compute f(27):f(27)= (f(25)+3) mod27.f(25)= (f(23)+3) mod25=21 +3=24 mod25=24.f(27)=24 +3=27 mod27=0. So f(27)=0. L(27)=0+1=1. So for k=9, L(27)=1≠9. Not a solution.k=10: n=30:f(30)= (f(28)+3) mod30.f(28)= (f(26)+3) mod28.f(26)= (f(24)+3) mod26=9 +3=12 mod26=12.f(28)=12 +3=15 mod28=15.f(30)=15 +3=18 mod30=18. L(30)=19. So f(30)=18≠9. So not a solution.So up to k=10, only k=1 satisfies L(3k)=k.Wait, perhaps k=1 is the only solution. But the problem says &quot;find all integers k&quot;, which might imply there are multiple. Maybe I need to consider a different approach.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a pattern where k=2^m -1 for some m? Since in Josephus problem, solutions often relate to powers of 2. But in our recurrence, it&#39;s different.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to find k such that f(3k)=k-1.From the recurrence:f(3k) = (f(3k - 2) +3) mod3k.We need f(3k) =k-1.So:k-1 ≡ f(3k -2) +3 mod3k=&gt; f(3k -2) ≡k-4 mod3k.But 3k-2 = 3(k-1) +1. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, since f(n) is defined recursively, maybe we can express it in terms of the original function.Alternatively, consider writing 3k in terms of its prime factors. But I don&#39;t see an immediate connection.Alternatively, maybe the solution occurs when 3k is a power of 2? For example, 3k=2^m. Then k=2^m /3. But 2^m must be divisible by 3, which only occurs if m is even? No, 2^m is never divisible by 3. So that&#39;s impossible. So this approach might not work.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a closed-form solution for f(n).Given the recurrence f(n) = (f(n-2) +3) modn.This is a linear congruence recurrence. Let&#39;s see if we can find a pattern.For even n:Let’s separate even and odd cases.Let’s define n=2m or n=2m+1.But maybe not helpful. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, notice that each time we subtract 2 from n, we add 3 modulo n. So the function f(n) can be expressed as 3*(number of steps) modulo n. But the number of steps depends on n.Alternatively, think of the process as follows: Each step, we effectively remove two cards and add a shift. The total shift after several steps might accumulate.But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s unroll the recurrence.For even n=2m:f(2m) = (f(2m -2) +3) mod2m.Similarly, for odd n=2m+1:f(2m+1) = (f(2m-1) +3) mod(2m+1).This looks like a double recurrence. Not sure.Alternatively, since we need f(3k)=k-1, let&#39;s substitute into the recurrence.f(3k) = (f(3k -2) +3) mod3k =k-1.So, f(3k -2) ≡k-1 -3 mod3k ⇒ f(3k -2) ≡k-4 mod3k.But 3k -2 =3(k-1) +1. So f(3(k-1)+1)=k-4 mod3k.But this seems to not lead us anywhere.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a relation between f(3k) and f(3k -2). Let&#39;s compute f(3k) in terms of f(3k -2):f(3k) = (f(3k -2) +3) mod3k.We need this to equal k-1. Therefore:f(3k -2) ≡ (k-1 -3) mod3k ≡k-4 mod3k.But f(3k -2) must be less than 3k -2, so k-4 mod3k must be adjusted accordingly.Alternatively, write f(3k -2) =k-4 +3k *t for some integer t ≥0, such that f(3k -2) &lt;3k -2.But since k-4 +3kt &lt;3k -2,k-4 +3kt &lt;3k -23kt &lt;2k +2t &lt; (2k +2)/3k ≈ 2/3 + 2/(3k). Since t must be integer, t=0.Therefore, f(3k -2)=k-4.But f(3k -2) must be non-negative. Therefore, k-4 ≥0 ⇒k≥4.But for k=4:f(3*4 -2)=f(10)=6 (from the table). But k-4=0. 6≠0. Not valid.Similarly, for k=5:f(13)=6. k-4=1. 6≠1.So this approach doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, perhaps the only solution is k=1.Alternatively, maybe there are other solutions for larger k, but they are very sparse.But given the computed values up to k=10, only k=1 satisfies L(3k)=k. Therefore, the answer is k=1.But the problem says &quot;find all integers k&quot;, so maybe there are multiple. But according to the simulations and recurrence calculations, only k=1 works. Therefore, the final answer is k=1.Final AnswerThe only integer ( k ) satisfying ( L(3k) = k ) is (boxed{1}).&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine the integers ( k ) such that ( L(3k) = k ), where ( L(n) ) is the label of the last remaining card after applying the operations ( ABBABBABBldots ) to a pile of ( n ) cards initially ordered from 1 to ( n ).1. Understanding the Operations:   - Operation ( A ) moves the top card to the bottom.   - Operation ( B ) removes the top card.   - The sequence ( ABBABBABBldots ) is repeated until one card remains.2. Simulating the Process:   - For small values of ( n ), we simulate the process to understand the behavior:     - For ( n = 3 ), the last remaining card is 1, so ( L(3) = 1 ).     - For ( n = 6 ), the last remaining card is 1, so ( L(6) = 1 ).     - For ( n = 9 ), the last remaining card is 1, so ( L(9) = 1 ).     - For ( n = 12 ), the last remaining card is 10, so ( L(12) = 10 ).3. Recurrence Relation:   - We derived a recurrence relation ( f(n) = (f(n-2) + 3) mod n ) where ( f(n) ) is the 0-based index of the last remaining card, and ( L(n) = f(n) + 1 ).4. Checking the Recurrence:   - Using the recurrence relation, we computed ( f(n) ) for various values of ( n ):     - For ( n = 3k ), we found that ( f(3k) ) does not equal ( k - 1 ) except when ( k = 1 ).5. Verification:   - For ( k = 1 ), ( 3k = 3 ), and ( L(3) = 1 ), which satisfies ( L(3 cdot 1) = 1 ).   - For larger values of ( k ), such as ( k = 2, 3, 4, ldots ), the value ( L(3k) ) does not equal ( k ).Thus, the only integer ( k ) that satisfies ( L(3k) = k ) is (boxed{1}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem. So we have a pile of n cards, each labeled from 1 to n, and initially they&#39;re in order from top to bottom as 1, 2, 3, ..., n. There are two operations: A moves the top card to the bottom, and B removes the top card. The operations are applied in the pattern ABBABBABBABB..., repeating this until only one card is left. We need to find all integers k such that when we apply this process to 3k cards, the last remaining card is labeled k.First, let me understand the operation sequence. It&#39;s ABBABBABBABB..., so the pattern is ABB repeated. So the sequence of operations would be A, B, B, A, B, B, A, B, B, and so on. Each cycle is three operations: A followed by two Bs. So every three operations, we do an A and then remove two cards. But we need to apply this until only one card remains.Given that n = 3k, we have to find k such that L(3k) = k. So when you start with 3k cards, following this ABBABB... process, the last card left is k. We need to find all k where this is true.Hmm. Maybe the first step is to simulate the process for small values of k and see if we can find a pattern. Let&#39;s try with small k values.Let&#39;s start with k=1, so n=3*1=3. The initial pile is [1, 2, 3] (top to bottom). Let&#39;s apply the operations:The sequence is ABB, so first operation A: move top card to the bottom. So after A, the pile is [2, 3, 1].Then operation B: remove the top card (2). Now the pile is [3, 1].Next operation B: remove the top card (3). Now only card 1 is left. So L(3*1)=1, which is equal to k=1. So k=1 works.Next, k=2, so n=6. Let&#39;s simulate:Initial pile: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.Operations: A, B, B, A, B, B, A, B, B, ... until one remains.First operation A: move 1 to the bottom. Pile becomes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1].Then B: remove 2. Pile is [3, 4, 5, 6, 1].Then B: remove 3. Pile is [4, 5, 6, 1].Next operation A: move 4 to the bottom. Pile becomes [5, 6, 1, 4].Then B: remove 5. Pile is [6, 1, 4].Then B: remove 6. Pile is [1, 4].Next operation A: move 1 to the bottom. Pile becomes [4, 1].Then B: remove 4. Pile is [1].So L(6)=1, but k=2 here. So 1 ≠ 2, so k=2 doesn&#39;t work.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So k=2 doesn&#39;t work. Let&#39;s try k=3 (n=9).But this might take a while. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern here. Let me see.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mathematical way to model this. It&#39;s similar to the Josephus problem, where people are standing in a circle and every k-th person is eliminated. But in this case, the elimination pattern is more complex, not every k-th, but following the ABB sequence.In the standard Josephus problem, the recurrence relation helps. Maybe we can find a similar approach here.But first, let&#39;s try to see if we can find a recurrence relation.Let me define L(n) as the last remaining card when starting with n cards. We need to find L(3k) = k.In the standard Josephus problem, each step you remove one person, but here the operations are different. Let&#39;s think about the process step by step.The operations are applied in the order A, B, B, A, B, B, etc. So every cycle of three operations is A followed by two Bs. But since the process is repeated until one card is left, the number of operations depends on the number of cards.Each time we perform an A operation, we move the top card to the bottom. Each B operation removes the top card. So each cycle of A, B, B does the following:1. Move the top card to the bottom.2. Remove the next top card.3. Remove the next top card.Therefore, each cycle of three operations reduces the number of cards by 2, because two B operations are performed. But since the process might not complete full cycles when the number of cards becomes small, we have to handle that carefully.Alternatively, perhaps after each cycle (A followed by two Bs), the number of cards decreases by 2.Wait, but let&#39;s check with n=3:Cycle 1: A, B, B. Starting with 3 cards.After A: [2,3,1]After B: [3,1]After B: [1]. So after one cycle, n reduces by 2, from 3 to 1. So yes, each cycle reduces n by 2. But when n is not a multiple of 2, maybe the cycles overlap? Hmm, perhaps not exactly.Wait, for n=6:Cycle 1: A, B, B. Start with [1,2,3,4,5,6].After A: [2,3,4,5,6,1]After B: remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,1]After B: remove 3 → [4,5,6,1]So after first cycle, n=4.Then cycle 2: A, B, B.After A: [5,6,1,4]After B: remove 5 → [6,1,4]After B: remove 6 → [1,4]n=2 after cycle 2.Cycle 3: A, B, B.After A: [4,1]After B: remove 4 → [1]So n=1 after cycle 3.But each cycle reduces n by 2, but when n is even, maybe? Wait, from 6 to 4 (reduction by 2), 4 to 2 (reduction by 2), 2 to 1 (reduction by 1). Hmm, so in the last cycle, when there are 2 cards, after A and B, we remove two cards? Wait no, when n=2, cycle is A, B, B:After A: [4,1] becomes [1,4].Then B: remove 1, so [4].Wait, but that would be only one B needed? Wait, no. Wait, when n=2:First operation in the cycle is A: move top card to bottom. So [4,1] becomes [1,4].Then operation B: remove top card (1). Now pile is [4].Then next operation is B, but there&#39;s only one card left. So do we skip it? Or does the process stop once only one card is left?The problem says &quot;repeated until only one card gets left&quot;. So once you have one card, you stop. So when you have two cards, after A, B, you remove one card, leaving one card. So maybe in that case, the last B is not performed? Wait, but in the problem statement, the operations are ABBABBABB... repeated until only one card is left. So you perform the operations in order, stopping when only one is left.So if after performing some operation, the number of cards becomes one, you stop. So for n=2:First operation: A (move top to bottom). Then first B (remove new top). Then only one card is left, so you stop, without performing the second B.Wait, let&#39;s check the n=6 example again. When we had two cards left: [1,4], after operation A, it becomes [4,1]. Then B removes 4, leaving [1]. Wait, but that&#39;s conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, in the n=6 example, after cycle 2, we had [1,4]. Then cycle 3 starts with A: moving 1 to the bottom, resulting in [4,1]. Then operation B: remove 4, leaving [1]. Then operation B is supposed to be next, but since only one card is left, we stop. So in that case, after performing A and B, we stop.So in general, when you have n cards, you perform the next operation in the sequence. If after performing that operation, the number of cards becomes 1, you stop. Otherwise, proceed.Therefore, for n=2, performing A, then B would leave 1 card. So in the sequence ABBABB..., after A and B, you stop. Therefore, when n=2, you perform A and B, removing two cards? Wait, no. Wait, starting with n=2: perform A (move top to bottom), then B (remove the new top). So starting with [1,2], after A: [2,1]. Then B removes 2, leaving 1. So you only perform A and B, not the full ABB.Therefore, the process is to follow the ABBABB... sequence, but if during that sequence an operation would leave only one card, you stop. So each operation is performed one at a time, in the order A, B, B, A, B, B, etc., stopping when only one remains.So perhaps the key is to model this as a sequence of operations, each of which is either A or B, in the order A, B, B, A, B, B, etc., and whenever we perform an operation, we check if the remaining cards are 1. If so, stop.This complicates things, because the number of operations isn&#39;t just cycles of three, but depends on how many operations are performed before the last card is left.Alternatively, maybe we can model this step by step for each n, but for n=3k, that could be tedious. Maybe instead, we can find a recurrence relation.Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the process as follows:Each &quot;cycle&quot; of operations (A followed by two Bs) effectively reduces the problem size by 2, but with some transformation on the remaining cards. But maybe not exactly. Let&#39;s see.Take n=3:Original: [1,2,3]After A: [2,3,1]After B: [3,1]After B: [1]So L(3)=1.n=6:Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6]After A: [2,3,4,5,6,1]After B: [3,4,5,6,1]After B: [4,5,6,1]Next cycle:After A: [5,6,1,4]After B: [6,1,4]After B: [1,4]Next cycle:After A: [4,1]After B: [1]So L(6)=1.Wait, so both L(3)=1 and L(6)=1. Hmm. So when k=1 and k=2 (since n=3k, so k=1, n=3; k=2, n=6), L(n)=1. But for k=1, L(3)=1=k; but for k=2, L(6)=1≠2, so only k=1 works so far.Let me check n=9 (k=3). Maybe the pattern is L(3k)=1 for all k? But in that case, only k=1 would satisfy L(3k)=k, because L(3k)=1, so 1=k. But let&#39;s check n=9.Starting with 9 cards: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].First cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 1 to the bottom → [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]B: Remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]B: Remove 3 → [4,5,6,7,8,9,1]Second cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 4 to the bottom → [5,6,7,8,9,1,4]B: Remove 5 → [6,7,8,9,1,4]B: Remove 6 → [7,8,9,1,4]Third cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 7 to the bottom → [8,9,1,4,7]B: Remove 8 → [9,1,4,7]B: Remove 9 → [1,4,7]Fourth cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 1 to the bottom → [4,7,1]B: Remove 4 → [7,1]B: Remove 7 → [1]So L(9)=1. So again, L(9)=1. If this pattern continues, then L(3k)=1 for all k, which would mean that only k=1 satisfies L(3k)=k. But before assuming that, let&#39;s check n=12 (k=4).Starting with 12 cards: 1 through 12.First cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 1 to the bottom → [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: Remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: Remove 3 → [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]Second cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 4 to the bottom → [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: Remove 5 → [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: Remove 6 → [7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]Third cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 7 to the bottom → [8,9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: Remove 8 → [9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: Remove 9 → [10,11,12,1,4,7]Fourth cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 10 to the bottom → [11,12,1,4,7,10]B: Remove 11 → [12,1,4,7,10]B: Remove 12 → [1,4,7,10]Fifth cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 1 to the bottom → [4,7,10,1]B: Remove 4 → [7,10,1]B: Remove 7 → [10,1]Next cycle (A, B, B):A: Move 10 to the bottom → [1,10]B: Remove 1 → [10]So L(12)=10. Wait, that&#39;s different. So here, L(12)=10. But k=4, so 3k=12, and L(12)=10≠4, so k=4 doesn&#39;t work. But here, the last card is 10. Hmm. So maybe the pattern isn&#39;t that L(3k)=1 always. Let&#39;s see.Wait, in the n=12 case, the last remaining card was 10. So L(12)=10. So perhaps there&#39;s a different pattern here.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation. Let me go through n=12 again.Starting with [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12].First cycle: A, B, B.A: Move 1 to the bottom → [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: Remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: Remove 3 → [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]Second cycle: A, B, B.A: Move 4 to the bottom → [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: Remove 5 → [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: Remove 6 → [7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]Third cycle: A, B, B.A: Move 7 to the bottom → [8,9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: Remove 8 → [9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: Remove 9 → [10,11,12,1,4,7]Fourth cycle: A, B, B.A: Move 10 to the bottom → [11,12,1,4,7,10]B: Remove 11 → [12,1,4,7,10]B: Remove 12 → [1,4,7,10]Fifth cycle: A, B, B.A: Move 1 to the bottom → [4,7,10,1]B: Remove 4 → [7,10,1]B: Remove 7 → [10,1]Now, we have two cards left: [10,1]. Next cycle is A, B, B.A: Move 10 to the bottom → [1,10]B: Remove 1 → [10]So yes, last card is 10. So L(12)=10. So for k=4, L(12)=10≠4, so doesn&#39;t work. Hmm. So L(3k) isn&#39;t always 1. So maybe there&#39;s a different pattern here.Wait, let&#39;s see if we can find a formula or recurrence.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the positions of the remaining cards after each operation. Let&#39;s try to track the position of the last remaining card.Alternatively, think of the process as follows: after each operation (A or B), the pile is modified. Since operations are interleaved, maybe we can model the transformations step by step.But this might be complex. Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the sequence of operations: A, B, B, A, B, B, A, B, B, etc. So every time you do an A, you move the top card to the bottom; then remove the next card (B), then remove the next card (B). So each cycle is A followed by two Bs.Alternatively, maybe each cycle can be considered as: move the first card to the end, then remove the next two cards. So starting with n cards:1. Move the first card to the end.2. Remove the new first card.3. Remove the new first card.Then repeat this process until one remains.So in terms of queue operations, it&#39;s like:- Rotate the first element to the end.- Dequeue the next two elements.Wait, that might be a way to model it.So let&#39;s model the pile as a queue. Each A operation is a rotation (dequeue the front and enqueue it at the back). Each B operation is a dequeue (removal).But the sequence is A followed by two Bs. So in each cycle:1. Do A: dequeue front and enqueue it at the back.2. Do B: dequeue front and discard.3. Do B: dequeue front and discard.So after each cycle, two elements are removed. But the initial rotation might affect which elements are removed.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the position of the surviving card.Wait, let&#39;s try for n=3:Queue: [1,2,3]Cycle 1:A: [2,3,1]B: remove 2 → [3,1]B: remove 3 → [1]Survivor: 1.n=6:Queue: [1,2,3,4,5,6]Cycle 1:A: [2,3,4,5,6,1]B: remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,1]B: remove 3 → [4,5,6,1]Cycle 2:A: [5,6,1,4]B: remove 5 → [6,1,4]B: remove 6 → [1,4]Cycle 3:A: [4,1]B: remove 4 → [1]Survivor: 1.n=9:Cycle 1:A: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]B: remove 2 → [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]B: remove 3 → [4,5,6,7,8,9,1]Cycle 2:A: [5,6,7,8,9,1,4]B: remove 5 → [6,7,8,9,1,4]B: remove 6 → [7,8,9,1,4]Cycle 3:A: [8,9,1,4,7]B: remove 8 → [9,1,4,7]B: remove 9 → [1,4,7]Cycle 4:A: [4,7,1]B: remove 4 → [7,1]B: remove 7 → [1]Survivor: 1.n=12:Cycle 1:A: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]B: remove 2,3 → [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]Cycle 2:A: [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]B: remove 5,6 → [7,8,9,10,11,12,1,4]Cycle 3:A: [8,9,10,11,12,1,4,7]B: remove 8,9 → [10,11,12,1,4,7]Cycle 4:A: [11,12,1,4,7,10]B: remove 11,12 → [1,4,7,10]Cycle 5:A: [4,7,10,1]B: remove 4,7 → [10,1]Cycle 6:A: [1,10]B: remove 1 → [10]Survivor: 10.So L(12)=10.So for n=3,6,9, the survivor is 1; for n=12, it&#39;s 10.Hmm. So there is a pattern here. For n=3,6,9: L(n)=1. For n=12, L(n)=10.Wait, maybe the recurrence is similar to the Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem, the position is given by J(n) = (J(n-1) + k) mod n, where k is the step size. But here, the elimination is not every k-th person, but following a specific operation sequence.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the positions.Wait, for each cycle (A, B, B), starting with m cards, after performing A, B, B, we end up with m - 2 cards. So perhaps there is a way to relate L(m) to L(m - 2). But how?Let&#39;s try to see. Suppose after performing one cycle (A, B, B) on m cards, we remove two cards and end up with m - 2 cards. The positions of the remaining cards are shifted due to the A operation.Wait, perhaps after performing A (rotating the top card to the bottom) and then removing the next two cards, the remaining cards form a new pile where the positions have been transformed. Then the problem reduces to finding L(m - 2), but with some mapping.Alternatively, maybe the position of the survivor in the original pile can be related to the position in the reduced pile.Let me try to formalize this. Suppose we have m cards. After performing A, B, B, we have m - 2 cards. Let&#39;s track the indices.Suppose we number the positions from 0 to m - 1 (for easier modulo arithmetic). Let the original positions be 0 (top) to m - 1 (bottom).After operation A (move top to bottom), the new order is positions 1, 2, ..., m - 1, 0.Then operation B removes the new top (position 1), and then operation B removes the next top (position 2). So the remaining cards are positions 3, 4, ..., m - 1, 0.Wait, but since we are dealing with a physical pile, after each removal, the pile shifts. So perhaps after A, B, B, the remaining cards are the original positions 3, 4, ..., m - 1, 0, but shifted.Wait, maybe not exactly. Let&#39;s think step by step.Original pile: [0, 1, 2, ..., m - 1] (top to bottom).After A: move 0 to the bottom → [1, 2, ..., m - 1, 0].Then B: remove 1 → [2, 3, ..., m - 1, 0].Then B: remove 2 → [3, 4, ..., m - 1, 0].So after one cycle (A, B, B), the remaining pile is [3, 4, ..., m - 1, 0], which is m - 2 cards. The original positions are 3, 4, ..., m - 1, 0. So the new pile corresponds to the original positions starting from 3, wrapping around.So if we can model the survivor&#39;s position in the reduced pile, we can map it back to the original position.Let’s denote the original positions as 0 to m - 1. After A, B, B, the remaining cards are in positions 3, 4, ..., m - 1, 0. So the new position 0 in the reduced pile corresponds to the original position 3, new position 1 corresponds to original position 4, ..., new position m - 3 corresponds to original position 0.Therefore, if we let f(m) be the original position of the survivor in a pile of m cards, then after one cycle, the survivor in the reduced pile of m - 2 cards is at position f(m - 2). But we need to map this back to the original position.In the reduced pile of m - 2 cards, the survivor is at position f(m - 2) in the reduced pile, which corresponds to original position (3 + f(m - 2)) mod m.Wait, because the first card in the reduced pile is original position 3, so adding f(m - 2) (the position in the reduced pile) gives the original position.Therefore, the recurrence relation would be:f(m) = (3 + f(m - 2)) mod mBut we need to confirm this.Let’s test this with m=3:f(3) should be 0 (since the survivor is position 0 in original pile [0,1,2], which is labeled 1). Wait, but in our earlier examples, the survivor was labeled 1 for n=3. But in terms of positions, it&#39;s position 0 (top) being 1, position 1 being 2, position 2 being 3. Wait, maybe the labeling is different.Wait, hold on. If the positions are 0 to m - 1, but the labels are 1 to m. So position 0 is labeled 1, position 1 is labeled 2, etc. So survivor&#39;s label is f(m) + 1.Wait, so if in position 0, the label is 1. So f(m) is the position (0-indexed), and the label is f(m) + 1.Wait, in the n=3 case, survivor is labeled 1, which is position 0. So f(3)=0.According to the recurrence:f(3) = (3 + f(1)) mod 3But f(1)=0 (since with 1 card, the survivor is position 0).So f(3)= (3 + 0) mod 3 = 0. Correct.For m=6:Using recurrence, f(6) = (3 + f(4)) mod 6Need to compute f(4):f(4) = (3 + f(2)) mod 4f(2) = (3 + f(0)) mod 2. Wait, f(0) is undefined. Wait, perhaps base cases need to be established.Wait, the base case is f(1)=0. Then for even m:f(2) would be computed as (3 + f(0)) mod 2, but f(0) doesn&#39;t exist. Hmm, maybe the recurrence starts from m &gt;=3, and for m=2, we need to handle it separately.Alternatively, maybe the recurrence is valid for m &gt;=3, and we need to compute f(2) independently.Wait, let&#39;s try to compute f(2). For m=2, we perform A, then B.Original pile: [0,1] (labeled 1,2).A: move 0 to the bottom → [1,0].B: remove 1 → [0]. So survivor is 0. Therefore, f(2)=0.Thus, for m=2, f(2)=0.Similarly, for m=1, f(1)=0.So let&#39;s see:Compute f(3) = (3 + f(1)) mod 3 = (3 + 0) mod 3 = 0.f(4) = (3 + f(2)) mod 4 = (3 + 0) mod 4 = 3.f(5) = (3 + f(3)) mod 5 = (3 + 0) mod 5 = 3.f(6) = (3 + f(4)) mod 6 = (3 + 3) mod 6 = 6 mod 6 = 0.f(7) = (3 + f(5)) mod 7 = (3 + 3) mod 7 = 6 mod 7 = 6.f(8) = (3 + f(6)) mod 8 = (3 + 0) mod 8 = 3.f(9) = (3 + f(7)) mod 9 = (3 + 6) mod 9 = 9 mod 9 = 0.f(10) = (3 + f(8)) mod 10 = (3 + 3) mod 10 = 6.f(11) = (3 + f(9)) mod 11 = (3 + 0) mod 11 = 3.f(12) = (3 + f(10)) mod 12 = (3 + 6) mod 12 = 9.Wait, but according to our previous simulation, for n=12, the survivor was labeled 10. But according to this, f(12)=9, so the label is 9 +1=10. Correct. Similarly, for n=6, f(6)=0, label=1. For n=9, f(9)=0, label=1. For n=3, same.So the label is f(n) +1. Therefore, the recurrence seems valid.So given f(m) = (3 + f(m - 2)) mod m, with base cases f(1)=0, f(2)=0.Therefore, for m=3k, we need L(3k) = f(3k) +1 = k. So f(3k) = k -1.Therefore, we need to find all integers k such that f(3k) = k -1.Now, let&#39;s try to compute f(3k) using the recurrence and see when it equals k -1.Let&#39;s compute f(3k) step by step for various k.First, let&#39;s note that f(3) = 0. So for k=1, f(3)=0=1-1=0. So k=1 works.For k=2, m=6. f(6)=0. So 0 vs 2-1=1. Not equal. So k=2 doesn&#39;t work.For k=3, m=9. f(9)=0. 0 vs 3-1=2. Doesn&#39;t work.k=4, m=12. f(12)=9. 9 vs 4-1=3. 9≠3. Doesn&#39;t work.k=5, m=15. Let&#39;s compute f(15).Using the recurrence:f(3)=0f(5)=3f(7)=6f(9)=0f(11)=3f(13)=6f(15)= (3 + f(13)) mod 15 = (3 +6) mod 15 =9.So f(15)=9. Then 9 vs 5-1=4. 9≠4. Doesn&#39;t work.k=6, m=18.f(18)=(3 + f(16)) mod 18f(16)=(3 + f(14)) mod16f(14)=(3 + f(12)) mod14=(3 +9) mod14=12 mod14=12f(16)=(3 +12) mod16=15 mod16=15f(18)=(3 +15) mod18=18 mod18=00 vs 6-1=5.

So far, only k=1 works. Let&#39;s check k=1,2,..., and see if any others work.Wait, maybe there are larger k where f(3k)=k-1.Let me check k=4, m=12:f(12)=9=4-1=3? No.k=5, m=15: f(15)=9 vs 5-1=4: no.k=7: f(21)=18 vs 7-1=6: no.k=10: f(30)=18 vs 10-1=9: no.k=13, m=39:Compute f(39):f(39)=(3 + f(37)) mod39f(37)=(3 + f(35)) mod37f(35)=(3 + f(33)) mod35f(33)=(3 + f(31)) mod33f(31)=(3 + f(29)) mod31f(29)=(3 + f(27)) mod29=(3 +0) mod29=3f(31)=(3 +3) mod31=6f(33)=(3 +6) mod33=9f(35)=(3 +9) mod35=12f(37)=(3 +12) mod37=15f(39)=(3 +15) mod39=1818 vs 13-1=12.

So maybe the only solution is k=1.But let&#39;s check k=0, but k must be positive integer, so k=1 is the only solution.But wait, let&#39;s check k=1, m=3:f(3)=0, which is 1-1=0. Correct.k=2, m=6: f(6)=0≠1.k=3, m=9: f(9)=0≠2.k=4, m=12: f(12)=9≠3.k=5, m=15: f(15)=9≠4.k=6, m=18: f(18)=0≠5.k=7, m=21: f(21)=18≠6.k=8, m=24: f(24)=9≠7.k=9, m=27: f(27)=0≠8.k=10, m=30: f(30)=18≠9.So no other k up to 10 satisfies f(3k)=k-1.Therefore, the only integer k satisfying L(3k)=k is k=1.But let&#39;s confirm for k=1:When n=3, L(3)=1, which matches k=1. For k=2, L(6)=1≠2. So yes, only k=1 works.But just to be thorough, maybe check k= some larger value.For example, k=4, m=12:We saw that f(12)=9. So 9 +1=10. So L(12)=10≠4.k=5: L(15)=9 +1=10≠5.k=6: L(18)=0 +1=1≠6.k=7: L(21)=18 +1=19≠7.k=8: L(24)=9 +1=10≠8.k=9: L(27)=0 +1=1≠9.k=10: L(30)=18 +1=19≠10.So, indeed, no other k satisfies the condition except k=1.Therefore, the answer is k=1.Final AnswerThe only integer ( k ) satisfying ( L(3k) = k ) is (boxed{1}).&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine the integers ( k ) such that ( L(3k) = k ), where ( L(n) ) is the label of the last remaining card after applying the operations A and B in the sequence ABBABBABB... until only one card remains. Key Steps:1. Understanding the Operations:   - Operation A: Moves the top card to the bottom.   - Operation B: Removes the top card.   - The sequence ABB is repeated until only one card remains.2. Simulating the Process:   - For small values of ( k ), we simulate the process to observe the pattern.   - For ( k = 1 ) (n = 3), the last remaining card is 1, which matches ( k = 1 ).   - For ( k = 2 ) (n = 6), the last remaining card is 1, which does not match ( k = 2 ).   - For ( k = 3 ) (n = 9), the last remaining card is 1, which does not match ( k = 3 ).3. Recurrence Relation:   - We derive a recurrence relation ( f(m) = (3 + f(m - 2)) mod m ) where ( f(m) ) is the position (0-indexed) of the last remaining card for ( m ) cards.   - The label of the last remaining card is ( f(m) + 1 ).4. Checking Values:   - Using the recurrence relation, we compute ( f(3k) ) for various ( k ):     - ( f(3) = 0 ) (label 1), matches ( k = 1 ).     - For ( k geq 2 ), ( f(3k) ) does not equal ( k - 1 ), hence ( L(3k) neq k ). Conclusion:The only integer ( k ) such that ( L(3k) = k ) is ( k = 1 ).[boxed{1}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🔑:</span>1. Initial Setup and Definitions:   - We have ( n ) cards labeled ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) in increasing order from top to bottom.   - Operations:     - ( A ): Move the top card to the bottom.     - ( B ): Remove the top card.   - The sequence of operations ( ABBABBABB cdots ) is repeated until only one card remains.   - We need to find all integers ( k ) such that ( L(3k) = k ), where ( L(n) ) is the label of the last remaining card.2. Understanding the Operation Sequence:   - The sequence ( ABB ) means:     - ( A ): Move the top card to the bottom.     - ( B ): Remove the top card.     - ( B ): Remove the new top card.   - Repeating ( ABB ) will cycle through the cards in a specific pattern.3. Pattern Analysis:   - Let&#39;s analyze the sequence for small values of ( n ):     - For ( n = 3 ):       - Initial: ( [1, 2, 3] )       - After ( ABB ): ( [2, 3] )       - After another ( ABB ): ( [3] )       - ( L(3) = 3 )     - For ( n = 6 ):       - Initial: ( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] )       - After ( ABB ): ( [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] )       - After another ( ABB ): ( [4, 5, 6] )       - After another ( ABB ): ( [6] )       - ( L(6) = 6 )4. General Pattern:   - We observe that the sequence ( ABB ) effectively reduces the problem size by removing two cards and cycling the rest.   - For ( n = 3k ), the sequence ( ABB ) will reduce the problem to ( 3k - 2 ), then ( 3k - 4 ), and so on.5. Recursive Definition:   - Define sequences ( {a_i} ) and ( {b_i} ) by:     - ( a_1 = 1 ), ( b_1 = 4 )     - ( a_{i+1} = 729a_i - 104 )     - ( b_{i+1} = 729b_i - 104 )   - Solutions are given by:     - ( k = 1 )     - ( k = 243a_i - 35 )     - ( k = 243b_i - 35 )6. Verification:   - Verify that these sequences satisfy the conditions:     - For ( k = 1 ):       - ( L(3 cdot 1) = 1 )     - For ( k = 243a_i - 35 ) and ( k = 243b_i - 35 ):       - These values are derived from the recursive sequences and satisfy the periodicity and reduction pattern of the operations.Conclusion:The problem is solved completely.The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 1 } ), ( k = 243a_i - 35 ), and ( k = 243b_i - 35 ) for any ( i in mathbb{N} ).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-628be48f data-v-a877af58><div class="review" data-v-a877af58><div class="review-title" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>❓:</span>Among the following statements, the correct one is (m, a, b ∈ R) (   )A: If am &gt; bm, then a &gt; bB: If a &gt; b, then am &gt; bmC: If am^2 &gt; bm^2, then a &gt; bD: If a &gt; b, then am^2 &gt; bm^2</div><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The question is about inequalities with real numbers m, a, and b. We have four options, and we need to pick the correct one. Hmm. Let me go through each option one by one.Starting with option A: &quot;If am &gt; bm, then a &gt; b.&quot; Hmm. So, if I have am &gt; bm, does that necessarily mean a &gt; b? Wait, but what if m is negative? Because when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to reverse the inequality sign. So, if m is positive, then yes, dividing both sides by m would keep the inequality direction the same, giving a &gt; b. But if m is negative, dividing both sides by m would flip the inequality, making a &lt; b. But since the problem states m, a, b are real numbers, m could be positive or negative. Therefore, the statement in A is not always true. So A is incorrect.Moving on to option B: &quot;If a &gt; b, then am &gt; bm.&quot; Again, similar reasoning. If m is positive, then multiplying both sides by m preserves the inequality, so am &gt; bm. But if m is negative, the inequality would reverse, making am &lt; bm. Also, if m is zero, then am and bm are both zero, so the inequality becomes 0 &gt; 0, which is false. So, unless we know that m is positive, this isn&#39;t necessarily true. Since m can be any real number, B is not always correct either. So B is out.Option C: &quot;If am² &gt; bm², then a &gt; b.&quot; Let&#39;s think. Since m is a real number, m² is always non-negative. Specifically, unless m is zero, m² is positive. So if m is not zero, then we can divide both sides of the inequality am² &gt; bm² by m² (which is positive), and the inequality remains the same. So dividing gives a &gt; b. But what if m is zero? Then am² = 0 and bm² = 0, so the inequality 0 &gt; 0 is false. Therefore, the premise &quot;am² &gt; bm²&quot; can only be true if m is not zero, because if m is zero, the left-hand side becomes 0, which can&#39;t be greater than 0. Therefore, whenever am² &gt; bm² holds, m must be non-zero, so m² is positive. Therefore, in all cases where the premise is true, we can divide by m² and get a &gt; b. So C seems correct. Let me check again. Suppose m² is positive, then yes, dividing both sides by m² gives a &gt; b. If m is zero, the premise is false, so the implication is vacuously true. So the implication is true in all cases. So C is correct? Wait, but let me test with some numbers. Let&#39;s take m = 1, a = 3, b = 2. Then am² = 3*1 = 3, bm² = 2*1 = 2. 3 &gt; 2, so a &gt; b. That works. Another example: m = -2, a = 5, b = 4. Then am² = 5*4 = 20, bm² = 4*4 = 16. 20 &gt; 16, so a &gt; b. Still holds. If m = 0, then am² = 0 and bm² = 0. The premise is 0 &gt; 0, which is false, so the implication is true regardless of the conclusion. So yes, C is always true. So maybe C is correct.Now D: &quot;If a &gt; b, then am² &gt; bm².&quot; Let&#39;s see. If a &gt; b, then multiplying both sides by m². Since m² is non-negative (because squaring any real number is non-negative). If m² is positive, then yes, multiplying both sides by m² preserves the inequality, so am² &gt; bm². However, if m² is zero, then am² = 0 and bm² = 0, so the conclusion becomes 0 &gt; 0, which is false. So if m is zero, then even if a &gt; b, am² is not greater than bm². Therefore, the implication is not always true. For example, take a = 2, b = 1, m = 0. Then a &gt; b is true, but am² = 0 and bm² = 0, so 0 &gt; 0 is false. Therefore, D is not always correct. So D is incorrect.Therefore, the correct answer is C. Let me double-check.Option C: If am² &gt; bm², then a &gt; b. As we saw, if m is non-zero, then m² is positive, so dividing both sides by m² (positive) keeps the inequality, so a &gt; b. If m is zero, then the premise is false, so the implication holds. So in all cases, the implication is true. Therefore, C is correct.So the answer should be C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the correct statement among the given options, we analyze each one step by step:Option A: &quot;If (am &gt; bm), then (a &gt; b).&quot;  - If (m) is positive, dividing both sides by (m) gives (a &gt; b). However, if (m) is negative, dividing by (m) would reverse the inequality, leading to (a &lt; b). Since (m) can be any real number, this statement is not always true. Hence, A is incorrect.Option B: &quot;If (a &gt; b), then (am &gt; bm).&quot;  - If (m) is positive, multiplying both sides by (m) preserves the inequality. However, if (m) is negative, the inequality would reverse, and if (m = 0), both sides become zero. Since (m) can be any real number, this statement is not always true. Hence, B is incorrect.Option C: &quot;If (am^2 &gt; bm^2), then (a &gt; b).&quot;  - Since (m^2) is always non-negative and non-zero if (m neq 0), dividing both sides by (m^2) (a positive number) preserves the inequality, leading to (a &gt; b). If (m = 0), the premise (am^2 &gt; bm^2) is false, making the implication vacuously true. Therefore, this statement is always true. Hence, C is correct.Option D: &quot;If (a &gt; b), then (am^2 &gt; bm^2).&quot;  - If (m neq 0), (m^2) is positive, and multiplying both sides by (m^2) preserves the inequality. However, if (m = 0), both sides become zero, making the conclusion false. Since (m) can be zero, this statement is not always true. Hence, D is incorrect.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of these statements A, B, C, D is correct. The problem is about inequalities with real numbers m, a, and b. Let me go through each option one by one.Starting with option A: If am &gt; bm, then a &gt; b. Hmm, wait a second. This seems similar to the idea that if you multiply both sides of an inequality by a positive number, the inequality stays the same. But here, they&#39;re saying that if the product of a and m is greater than the product of b and m, then a must be greater than b. But what if m is a negative number? If m is negative, then multiplying by m would reverse the inequality. So, for example, if m is negative, then am &gt; bm would actually imply that a &lt; b. So, unless we know that m is positive, we can&#39;t just say that a &gt; b. Therefore, statement A is not necessarily true because it doesn&#39;t specify that m is positive. So I think A is incorrect.Moving on to option B: If a &gt; b, then am &gt; bm. Again, similar issue here. If we multiply both sides of an inequality by m, the direction of the inequality depends on whether m is positive or negative. If m is positive, then yes, am &gt; bm. But if m is negative, then multiplying by m would reverse the inequality, making am &lt; bm. Also, what if m is zero? Then am and bm would both be zero, so am would equal bm, not greater. Therefore, unless we know that m is positive, this statement isn&#39;t necessarily true. Since the problem states that m, a, b are real numbers, m could be any real number, including negative or zero. Therefore, statement B is also incorrect.Next is option C: If am² &gt; bm², then a &gt; b. Okay, let&#39;s think. Here we have m squared. Since m is a real number, m squared is always non-negative, right? It can&#39;t be negative. So m² is greater than or equal to zero. Now, if m² is positive (i.e., m ≠ 0), then we can divide both sides of the inequality am² &gt; bm² by m², and since m² is positive, the inequality direction remains the same. Dividing both sides by m² would give a &gt; b. However, if m² is zero, then am² and bm² would both be zero, so the inequality am² &gt; bm² would not hold. Therefore, the premise am² &gt; bm² implies that m² is not zero (since 0 &gt; 0 is false), so m must be non-zero. Therefore, if am² &gt; bm², then m² is positive, so we can safely divide both sides by m² and get a &gt; b. Therefore, statement C is correct.But let me check the last option just to be sure. Option D: If a &gt; b, then am² &gt; bm². Hmm. Let&#39;s see. If a &gt; b, and we multiply both sides by m². Since m² is always non-negative, but it could be zero. So if m² is positive, then yes, multiplying both sides by m² preserves the inequality, so am² &gt; bm². But if m² is zero, then am² = bm² = 0, so the conclusion am² &gt; bm² would not hold. Therefore, the statement D is only true if m² is positive, but since m could be zero, the statement D isn&#39;t always true. Therefore, D is incorrect.So, after evaluating all options, the correct one is C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which statement is correct, we analyze each option:- Option A: If ( am &gt; bm ), then ( a &gt; b ).    This is incorrect because if ( m ) is negative, the inequality direction reverses. If ( m = 0 ), the inequality does not hold. - Option B: If ( a &gt; b ), then ( am &gt; bm ).    This is incorrect because if ( m ) is negative, the inequality direction reverses. If ( m = 0 ), both sides are equal.- Option C: If ( am^2 &gt; bm^2 ), then ( a &gt; b ).    Since ( m^2 geq 0 ) and ( am^2 &gt; bm^2 ) implies ( m^2 neq 0 ), we can divide both sides by ( m^2 ) (a positive number), resulting in ( a &gt; b ). This is correct.- Option D: If ( a &gt; b ), then ( am^2 &gt; bm^2 ).    This is incorrect because if ( m = 0 ), both sides are zero, making the inequality false.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🔑:</span>When m  bm, then a  b, then am  bm^2, since m^2 &gt; 0, it implies a &gt; b, so option C is correct;  When m = 0, if a &gt; b, then am^2 = bm^2, so option D is incorrect;  Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}.Analysis: By using the basic properties of inequalities and analyzing the truth of the four options one by one, the conclusion can be drawn.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-628be48f data-v-a877af58><div class="review" data-v-a877af58><div class="review-title" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>❓:</span>In the plane rectangular coordinate system xOy, the coordinates of the point P(3,5) with respect to the y-axis are ( ).A: (-3,0)B: (-3,5)C: (-3,-5)D: (3,-5)</div><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the coordinates of the point P(3,5) with respect to the y-axis. Hmm, let me think. When they say &quot;with respect to the y-axis,&quot; does that mean reflecting the point over the y-axis? I remember that reflecting a point over the y-axis changes the sign of the x-coordinate, while the y-coordinate stays the same. Let me verify that.If I have a point (x, y) and I reflect it over the y-axis, the formula for the reflection should be (-x, y). So, for example, if the original point is (3,5), reflecting over the y-axis would be (-3,5). Let me check that. The y-axis is the vertical line x=0, so reflecting over it would invert the horizontal distance from the axis. Since the original x-coordinate is 3, the distance from the y-axis is 3 units to the right. After reflection, it should be 3 units to the left, which would be -3 on the x-axis. The y-coordinate remains 5 because we&#39;re not changing the vertical position. That makes sense.Looking at the options: A is (-3,0), which changes both coordinates, but the y-coordinate should stay the same. B is (-3,5), which matches what I just thought. C is (-3,-5), which flips both coordinates, which would be a reflection over the origin, not just the y-axis. D is (3,-5), which is a reflection over the x-axis. So, the correct answer should be B: (-3,5). Wait, let me make sure I&#39;m interpreting the question right. It says &quot;the coordinates of the point P(3,5) with respect to the y-axis.&quot; Sometimes &quot;with respect to&quot; can mean different things, like changing the coordinate system. But in this case, since it&#39;s a reflection over an axis, I think the standard interpretation is to reflect the point over the y-axis. If the coordinate system itself were changed to be with respect to the y-axis, maybe the coordinates would be different, but I think in the context of a multiple-choice question like this, they&#39;re asking for the reflection.Another way to check: If you have the original point (3,5), and you mirror it over the y-axis, then in the new position, the x-coordinate is negative, y stays the same. So (-3,5). Yes, that&#39;s option B. So I think B is the right answer.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the coordinates of the point ( P(3,5) ) with respect to the ( y )-axis, we need to reflect the point over the ( y )-axis. Reflecting a point ((x, y)) over the ( y )-axis changes the ( x )-coordinate&#39;s sign while keeping the ( y )-coordinate the same. For the point ( P(3, 5) ):- The ( x )-coordinate changes from ( 3 ) to ( -3 ).- The ( y )-coordinate remains ( 5 ).Thus, the coordinates of the point ( P ) after reflection over the ( y )-axis are ( (-3, 5) ).The correct answer is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the coordinates of the point P(3,5) with respect to the y-axis. Hmm, let me think. When they say &quot;with respect to the y-axis,&quot; does that mean reflecting the point over the y-axis? I remember that reflecting a point over the y-axis changes the sign of the x-coordinate, while the y-coordinate stays the same. Let me recall the reflection rules.In the coordinate plane, reflecting a point over the y-axis (vertical axis) would take a point (x, y) to (-x, y). For example, if you have a point (2, 3), reflecting it over the y-axis would give (-2, 3). Similarly, reflecting over the x-axis would change the y-coordinate&#39;s sign, so (x, y) becomes (x, -y). So, applying that to the point P(3,5), if we reflect over the y-axis, the x-coordinate 3 becomes -3, and the y-coordinate remains 5. Therefore, the coordinates should be (-3,5). Let me check the options.Option A is (-3,0). That changes the y-coordinate to 0, which doesn&#39;t seem right. Option B is (-3,5), which matches what I thought. Option C is (-3,-5), which would be a reflection over both axes, maybe? And Option D is (3,-5), which is a reflection over the x-axis. Since the question is about the y-axis, only the x-coordinate should change. So the correct answer should be B: (-3,5). Wait, but let me make sure I&#39;m interpreting &quot;with respect to the y-axis&quot; correctly. Sometimes, coordinates can be expressed in terms of a different coordinate system. But in this case, I think the problem is just asking for the reflection over the y-axis. The original point is in the xOy coordinate system, and reflecting over the y-axis would give its mirror image with respect to that axis. Yeah, that makes sense. So, reflection over y-axis: (x,y) -&gt; (-x,y). So (3,5) becomes (-3,5). So yes, B is the answer.Alternatively, if &quot;with respect to the y-axis&quot; meant something else, like coordinates along the y-axis, but that doesn&#39;t make much sense. Coordinates are points in the plane, not along an axis. So reflection is the standard interpretation here. Therefore, the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the coordinates of the point ( P(3, 5) ) with respect to the ( y )-axis, we need to reflect the point over the ( y )-axis. Reflecting a point over the ( y )-axis changes the sign of the ( x )-coordinate while keeping the ( y )-coordinate the same. The reflection rule over the ( y )-axis is:[(x, y) rightarrow (-x, y)]Applying this rule to the point ( P(3, 5) ):- The ( x )-coordinate ( 3 ) becomes ( -3 ).- The ( y )-coordinate ( 5 ) remains ( 5 ).Thus, the coordinates of the point ( P ) with respect to the ( y )-axis are ( (-3, 5) ).The correct answer is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🔑:</span>To find the coordinates of the point P(3,5) with respect to the y-axis, we need to understand how reflection across the y-axis affects a point&#39;s coordinates.

The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. Let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola depends on whether it&#39;s opening vertically or horizontally. If the foci are on the y-axis, that means the hyperbola is oriented vertically, right? So the positive term should be with the y part. Wait, but in the given equation, the x term is positive and the y term is negative. Hmm, maybe I need to rearrange it?Wait, let me recall. The standard form of a hyperbola that opens vertically is (frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1), and the foci are on the y-axis. If it opens horizontally, it&#39;s (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1) with foci on the x-axis. So in the given equation, the x term is positive and the y term is negative. That would suggest that it&#39;s a horizontally opening hyperbola. But the problem says the foci are on the y-axis. That seems contradictory. Therefore, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in my initial thought.Wait, no. Let me check again. The standard form for vertical hyperbola is (frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1), center at (h, k). So the positive term is with the y term. So if the given equation is (frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = 1), then for it to be a vertical hyperbola, the positive term should be with y². But here, the positive term is with x². Therefore, maybe the equation is actually a horizontal hyperbola, but the problem states that the foci are on the y-axis, which would mean that it&#39;s a vertical hyperbola. Therefore, there must be something wrong with the signs here. So perhaps the denominators need to be positive for the respective terms?Wait, let&#39;s think. For a hyperbola, the denominators under the positive and negative terms must both be positive. Because in the standard form, both denominators are positive. So, in the given equation, the coefficient under x² is (frac{1}{1 - 2k}), and under y² is (frac{-1}{k - 2}). So in order for the equation to represent a hyperbola, both denominators must be positive? Wait, no. Wait, the standard form is (frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1) for horizontal, and (frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1) for vertical. So regardless of the direction, both denominators are positive. Therefore, in the given equation, if it&#39;s written as (frac{x^2}{A} - frac{y^2}{B} = 1), then A and B must both be positive. So for the equation to be a hyperbola, both denominators 1 - 2k and k - 2 must have the same sign? Wait, no, because one is under x² and the other under y² with a negative sign. Wait, let me clarify.Let me write the given equation again: (frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = 1). For this to be a hyperbola, the coefficients under x² and y² must be such that one is positive and the other is negative. Because in standard form, the hyperbola equation has one term positive and the other negative. But in the standard form, the denominators themselves are positive. So here, if we have (frac{x^2}{A} - frac{y^2}{B} = 1), then both A and B must be positive. Therefore, for this equation to represent a hyperbola, we must have 1 - 2k &gt; 0 and -(k - 2) &gt; 0. Wait, no. Wait, the second term is -(frac{y^2}{k - 2}), so that is equivalent to +(frac{y^2}{2 - k}) if I factor out the negative. So maybe I need to rewrite the equation to match the standard form.Let me rewrite the equation:(frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} + frac{y^2}{2 - k} = 1). Wait, no, because subtracting (frac{y^2}{k - 2}) is the same as adding (frac{y^2}{2 - k}). So the equation becomes (frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} + frac{y^2}{2 - k} = 1). But for this to be a hyperbola, the signs of the two terms should be different. However, in this case, if both denominators are positive, then both terms are positive, which would make it an ellipse, not a hyperbola. Therefore, actually, one of the denominators must be positive and the other negative for it to be a hyperbola. Because then one term would be positive and the other negative, so that when you bring the negative term to the other side, you get a hyperbola equation.Therefore, for the given equation to be a hyperbola, the coefficients of x² and y² must have opposite signs. That is, (frac{1}{1 - 2k}) and (-frac{1}{k - 2}) must have opposite signs. Wait, no. Wait, the equation is (frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = 1). So the coefficient of x² is (frac{1}{1 - 2k}) and the coefficient of y² is (-frac{1}{k - 2}). For this equation to be a hyperbola, the coefficients must be of opposite signs. That is, one term is positive and the other is negative.But actually, in standard form, the hyperbola equation has one term positive and the other negative. So the coefficients in front of x² and y² must be opposite in sign. Therefore, either (frac{1}{1 - 2k} &gt; 0) and (-frac{1}{k - 2} &lt; 0), or (frac{1}{1 - 2k} &lt; 0) and (-frac{1}{k - 2} &gt; 0). Let&#39;s analyze both cases.Case 1: (frac{1}{1 - 2k} &gt; 0) and (-frac{1}{k - 2} &lt; 0). The first inequality implies that 1 - 2k &gt; 0 =&gt; 1 &gt; 2k =&gt; k &lt; 1/2. The second inequality: (-frac{1}{k - 2} &lt; 0) =&gt; multiply both sides by (k - 2), but need to be careful with the sign. Alternatively, simplify the inequality. Let&#39;s write (-frac{1}{k - 2} &lt; 0). This is equivalent to (frac{1}{k - 2} &gt; 0). Because multiplying both sides by -1 flips the inequality. So 1/(k - 2) &gt; 0 implies that k - 2 &gt; 0 =&gt; k &gt; 2. Therefore, in Case 1, we have k &lt; 1/2 and k &gt; 2. But these two cannot be true at the same time. So Case 1 is impossible.Case 2: (frac{1}{1 - 2k} &lt; 0) and (-frac{1}{k - 2} &gt; 0). The first inequality: 1 - 2k &lt; 0 =&gt; 1 &lt; 2k =&gt; k &gt; 1/2. The second inequality: (-frac{1}{k - 2} &gt; 0) =&gt; multiply both sides by (k - 2). But since the inequality is positive, (k - 2) must be negative to keep the direction when multiplying. Wait, let me do it step by step. Starting with (-frac{1}{k - 2} &gt; 0). Multiply both sides by (k - 2)^2, which is always positive (unless k = 2, but denominator can&#39;t be zero). So multiplying both sides by (k - 2)^2 gives: - (k - 2) &gt; 0 =&gt; -k + 2 &gt; 0 =&gt; 2 &gt; k =&gt; k &lt; 2. So the second inequality gives k &lt; 2. Therefore, Case 2 requires k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2. Therefore, the range for k in this case is (1/2, 2).But wait, that would mean that the equation is a hyperbola when k is in (1/2, 2). But we need to check if the foci are on the y-axis.So, in order for the foci to be on the y-axis, the hyperbola must be oriented vertically. That is, the positive term is with y². But in the given equation, the positive term is with x² if 1 - 2k is positive, but in our Case 2, 1 - 2k is negative. Therefore, the coefficient of x² is negative, so the equation can be rewritten as:(frac{x^2}{negative} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = 1). To make this look like the standard hyperbola, we can rearrange terms. Let&#39;s move the x² term to the other side:(-frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} + frac{y^2}{k - 2} = -1). Multiply both sides by -1:(frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = -1). Then, rewrite as:(frac{y^2}{k - 2} - frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} = 1). So this is now in the standard form of a vertical hyperbola, which is (frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1). Therefore, the hyperbola is vertical, so foci are on the y-axis, which is what the problem states. Therefore, the conditions from Case 2 (k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2) are necessary. But we also need to ensure that the denominators in the standard form are positive. That is, for (frac{y^2}{k - 2} - frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} = 1), both denominators (k - 2) and (1 - 2k) must be positive. Wait, but in Case 2, k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2. Let&#39;s check the denominators:For k - 2: since k &lt; 2, k - 2 is negative. But in the standard form, we need the denominator under y² to be positive. So this is a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, let&#39;s step back. When I multiplied by -1, the equation became (frac{y^2}{k - 2} - frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} = 1). For this to be a standard vertical hyperbola, we must have (k - 2) &gt; 0 and (1 - 2k) &gt; 0. But in Case 2, we have k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2. Let&#39;s check if (k - 2) &gt; 0: k &gt; 2, but in our case, k &lt; 2, so (k - 2) is negative. Similarly, (1 - 2k): since k &gt; 1/2, 1 - 2k &lt; 0. Therefore, both denominators (k - 2) and (1 - 2k) are negative. Therefore, we can write the equation as:(frac{y^2}{(negative)} - frac{x^2}{(negative)} = 1). To make this standard, we can factor out the negatives from the denominators:(frac{y^2}{-(2 - k)} - frac{x^2}{-(2k - 1)} = 1). Which simplifies to:(-frac{y^2}{2 - k} + frac{x^2}{2k - 1} = 1). Wait, but this complicates things. Alternatively, factor out the negative signs in the equation:(frac{y^2}{k - 2} - frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} = 1) can be rewritten as (frac{y^2}{-(2 - k)} - frac{x^2}{-(2k - 1)} = 1), which becomes:(-frac{y^2}{2 - k} + frac{x^2}{2k - 1} = 1). Then, moving the negative term to the other side:(frac{x^2}{2k - 1} = 1 + frac{y^2}{2 - k}). Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe a better approach is to note that in the standard form, denominators must be positive. Therefore, for the equation (frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1), we need a² &gt; 0 and b² &gt; 0. Therefore, in the given transformed equation (frac{y^2}{k - 2} - frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} = 1), the denominators (k - 2) and (1 - 2k) must both be positive. Therefore:k - 2 &gt; 0 =&gt; k &gt; 2and1 - 2k &gt; 0 =&gt; k &lt; 1/2But these two conditions can&#39;t be satisfied simultaneously because k can&#39;t be both greater than 2 and less than 1/2. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a different way to interpret the original equation.Wait, but earlier we saw that in Case 2, the equation can be a hyperbola with k in (1/2, 2). But according to the above, the denominators would both be negative. So then, if both denominators are negative, then we can factor out the negatives and write the equation as:(-frac{y^2}{2 - k} + frac{x^2}{2k - 1} = 1). But this is not the standard form. Wait, actually, if we factor out the negatives:(frac{y^2}{-(2 - k)} - frac{x^2}{-(2k - 1)} = 1), which is equivalent to:(-frac{y^2}{2 - k} + frac{x^2}{2k - 1} = 1). So this can be rearranged as:(frac{x^2}{2k - 1} - frac{y^2}{2 - k} = 1). Now, this is a horizontal hyperbola because the positive term is with x². Therefore, even though we initially thought it&#39;s vertical, after adjusting the signs, it&#39;s actually horizontal. Wait, but the problem states that the hyperbola has foci on the y-axis, which would require it to be vertical. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps my initial analysis is wrong.Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let&#39;s recall that for a hyperbola of the form (frac{x^2}{A} - frac{y^2}{B} = 1), the foci are on the x-axis. For a hyperbola of the form (frac{y^2}{A} - frac{x^2}{B} = 1), the foci are on the y-axis. Therefore, to have foci on the y-axis, the positive term must be the y² term.Therefore, let&#39;s consider the original equation:(frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = 1)To have foci on the y-axis, this equation must be equivalent to (frac{y^2}{A} - frac{x^2}{B} = 1), which means that the y² term must be positive and the x² term must be negative. Therefore, the coefficients of x² and y² in the original equation must satisfy:(frac{1}{1 - 2k} &lt; 0) and (-frac{1}{k - 2} &gt; 0)Wait, let&#39;s break it down. For the equation to be equivalent to (frac{y^2}{A} - frac{x^2}{B} = 1), we need:Coefficient of y²: (-frac{1}{k - 2} = frac{1}{A}) =&gt; So A = -(k - 2) = 2 - kCoefficient of x²: (frac{1}{1 - 2k} = -frac{1}{B}) =&gt; So B = -(1 - 2k) = 2k - 1Therefore, for A and B to be positive (since they are denominators in the standard form), we need:A = 2 - k &gt; 0 =&gt; k &lt; 2B = 2k - 1 &gt; 0 =&gt; k &gt; 1/2Therefore, combining these two inequalities, we get 1/2 &lt; k &lt; 2. So the range is (1/2, 2). But wait, let me check if there are any other constraints.Also, the original equation must be a hyperbola, so denominators cannot be zero. So 1 - 2k ≠ 0 =&gt; k ≠ 1/2, and k - 2 ≠ 0 =&gt; k ≠ 2. But in the interval (1/2, 2), we exclude 1/2 and 2, but since the inequalities are strict (k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2), we don&#39;t include them anyway. Therefore, the range is (1/2, 2), which is option A. But wait, the answer options given include option B: (1/2,1)∪(1,2). Why is that? Maybe there&#39;s another constraint that I missed.Wait, perhaps k cannot be 1. Let me check. If k = 1, then the original equation becomes:(frac{x^2}{1 - 2(1)} - frac{y^2}{1 - 2} = frac{x^2}{-1} - frac{y^2}{-1} = -x² + y² = 1), which is equivalent to y² - x² = 1. That is a standard hyperbola opening vertically. So k = 1 is acceptable. So why is option B excluding 1?Wait, maybe there&#39;s a different reasoning here. Let me check the original problem again. The problem says &quot;the range of the real number k&quot;. So if k = 1 is allowed, then option A is correct. But the given options include B which excludes 1. So maybe there is a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let&#39;s check if when k = 1, the equation is indeed a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis. As I mentioned, when k = 1, the equation becomes y² - x² = 1, which is a standard hyperbola opening upwards and downwards, with foci on the y-axis. The foci are at (0, ±√(1 + 1)) = (0, ±√2). So that works. So k = 1 should be included. Therefore, option A (1/2, 2) is the correct answer. But the options include B: (1/2,1)∪(1,2). Maybe there&#39;s an error in the problem&#39;s options, or maybe my reasoning is missing something.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the equation again. When we rewrote the original equation as (frac{y^2}{2 - k} - frac{x^2}{2k - 1} = 1), we had to have both denominators positive. Therefore:2 - k &gt; 0 =&gt; k &lt; 22k - 1 &gt; 0 =&gt; k &gt; 1/2So indeed, k must be in (1/2, 2). However, if k = 1, then 2 - k = 1 and 2k -1 = 1, which are positive. Therefore, k = 1 is allowed. So why is option B presented as excluding 1? Is there a case when k = 1 makes the equation not a hyperbola? Let&#39;s test k = 1.If k = 1, equation is (frac{x^2}{1 - 2(1)} - frac{y^2}{1 - 2} = frac{x^2}{-1} - frac{y^2}{-1} = -x² + y² = 1), which is y² - x² = 1, a hyperbola. So k = 1 is valid. Hence, option A should be correct, but the answer choices don&#39;t have overlapping options. Wait, looking back at the options:A: (1/2, 2)B: (1/2,1)∪(1,2)C: (1,2)D: (1/2, ∞)So why is there an option B which excludes 1? Maybe the original problem requires that the hyperbola is non-degenerate and the denominators cannot be equal? Wait, but when k = 1, the denominators are 1 - 2(1) = -1 and 1 - 2 = -1, so both denominators are -1, but when we rewrite the equation, it&#39;s y² - x² = 1, which is a hyperbola. So k = 1 is acceptable.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that the hyperbola cannot be rectangular? Wait, a rectangular hyperbola has a = b, but in this case, when k = 1, the equation becomes y² - x² = 1, which is a rectangular hyperbola. But rectangular hyperbola is still a hyperbola. So that shouldn&#39;t exclude k = 1. Therefore, maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps my reasoning is flawed.Wait, let&#39;s check the answer options again. The original problem says the foci are on the y-axis. If k = 1, the hyperbola is y² - x² = 1, which indeed has foci on the y-axis. Therefore, k = 1 is valid, so option A is correct. However, option B is (1/2,1)∪(1,2), which excludes 1. But there&#39;s no reason to exclude 1. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. But maybe the original equation has some restrictions when k =1? Let me check.Original equation when k =1: (frac{x^2}{1 - 2(1)} - frac{y^2}{1 - 2} = frac{x^2}{-1} - frac{y^2}{-1} = -x² + y² =1), which is y² -x² =1. That&#39;s valid. So why is there an option excluding 1? Maybe there is a mistake in the problem&#39;s options.Wait, but looking back, when I did the analysis, I concluded that k must be in (1/2, 2). But when I considered the standard form, we had A = 2 - k and B = 2k -1. Both must be positive, so yes, 1/2 &lt; k &lt; 2. Therefore, the answer should be A. But the given options have B as (1/2,1)∪(1,2). Maybe there is a miscalculation.Wait, wait. Let me check again: The original equation is (frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} =1). For this to represent a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis, it must be a vertical hyperbola. Which requires that after rewriting, the y² term is positive. Which requires that the coefficient of y² is positive. Let me see.The coefficient of y² is -1/(k - 2). For that to be positive, -1/(k - 2) &gt; 0, which implies that (k - 2) &lt;0, so k &lt;2. Similarly, the coefficient of x² is 1/(1 -2k). For the equation to have a vertical hyperbola, the coefficient of y² must be positive and the coefficient of x² must be negative. Because in the standard vertical hyperbola, the y² term is positive and the x² term is negative. Therefore:Coefficient of y²: -1/(k - 2) &gt;0 =&gt; k &lt;2Coefficient of x²:1/(1 -2k) &lt;0 =&gt; 1 -2k &lt;0 =&gt;k &gt;1/2Therefore, combining these, k must be in (1/2, 2). So answer A.But the problem gives option B as (1/2,1)∪(1,2). Maybe there is a constraint that k ≠1, but I don&#39;t see why. When k =1, as shown, it&#39;s a valid hyperbola. Hence, perhaps the answer is A. But let&#39;s check the problem statement again.Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check:&quot;If (dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k}-dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2}=1) represents a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis, then the range of the real number k is...&quot;So the equation must represent a hyperbola (so conditions for hyperbola) and the foci must be on the y-axis (so vertical hyperbola). So the conditions are:1. The equation is a hyperbola: The coefficients of x² and y² must be non-zero and opposite in sign.2. The foci are on the y-axis: The hyperbola must be vertical, meaning the positive term is y².So let&#39;s formalize this.First, the equation is (dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k}-dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2}=1)For it to be a hyperbola, the denominators 1 - 2k and k - 2 must not be zero, and the coefficients must be of opposite sign.Denominators not zero:1 - 2k ≠ 0 =&gt; k ≠1/2k - 2 ≠0 =&gt;k ≠2Coefficients opposite in sign:(1/(1 - 2k)) and (-1/(k - 2)) must be of opposite sign.Let me compute the sign of each coefficient.Coefficient of x²: 1/(1 - 2k). This is positive when 1 - 2k &gt;0 =&gt;k &lt;1/2, and negative when k &gt;1/2.Coefficient of y²: -1/(k - 2). This can be rewritten as 1/(2 - k). Therefore, this is positive when 2 - k &gt;0 =&gt;k &lt;2, and negative when k &gt;2.Therefore, the coefficient of x² is positive when k &lt;1/2, negative when k &gt;1/2.The coefficient of y² is positive when k &lt;2, negative when k &gt;2.For the coefficients to be of opposite signs:Case1: x² coefficient positive, y² coefficient negative.This requires k &lt;1/2 and k &gt;2. But impossible.Case2: x² coefficient negative, y² coefficient positive.This requires k &gt;1/2 and k &lt;2. Therefore, k ∈ (1/2, 2)Additionally, for the hyperbola to have foci on the y-axis, it must be a vertical hyperbola. For a vertical hyperbola, the positive term is with y², which in our case, after ensuring coefficients are opposite signs (Case2), the y² term is positive. Hence, the hyperbola is vertical, and the foci are on the y-axis.Thus, the range is (1/2, 2), which is option A.But then why is option B there? Is there a mistake? Wait, unless when k=1, the hyperbola becomes degenerate or something else. But as we saw when k=1, the equation is y² -x²=1, which is a standard hyperbola. So I don&#39;t see why k=1 should be excluded.Therefore, unless there is a mistake in the problem options, the correct answer should be A. But the options given are:A: (1/2,2)B: (1/2,1)∪(1,2)C: (1,2)D: (1/2,∞)Since when k=1 is acceptable, the correct answer is A. But maybe the original problem requires k≠1 because 1-2k and k-2 would be -1 and -1, but when you write the standard form, you get denominators as positive. Wait, when k=1, the equation is y² -x²=1, which has a=1 and b=1. So a and b are positive real numbers, so no problem.Alternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation when transforming the equation? Let me check:Original equation with k=1: (frac{x²}{1 - 2(1)} - frac{y²}{1 - 2} = frac{x²}{-1} - frac{y²}{-1} = -x² + y² =1), which is y² -x²=1. This is indeed a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis.Therefore, I think the correct answer should be A: (1/2, 2). So why is option B present? Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem options. Alternatively, perhaps I need to check for other constraints.Wait, let&#39;s check if in the interval (1/2, 2), the hyperbola is non-degenerate. A hyperbola is non-degenerate as long as the coefficients are non-zero and the equation doesn&#39;t reduce to a pair of lines or something. So as long as the denominators aren&#39;t zero and the terms don&#39;t cancel out. Since we already have k ≠1/2 and k ≠2, and for k ∈ (1/2, 2), the equation is a valid hyperbola. Hence, the correct answer is A.But given that option B is (1/2,1)∪(1,2), perhaps the problem considers that when k=1, the hyperbola becomes a rectangular hyperbola, but rectangular hyperbola is still a hyperbola. So unless the problem specifies &quot;non-rectangular&quot;, which it doesn&#39;t, k=1 should be allowed.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation here. Let me verify the conditions once again.To have the foci on the y-axis, the hyperbola must be of the form (frac{y²}{a²} - frac{x²}{b²}=1). Therefore, the given equation must be expressible in that form. Starting with:(dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k}-dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2}=1)Rearranging:(-dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2} + dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k} =1)Multiply both sides by -1:(dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2} - dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k} = -1)But this is equivalent to:(dfrac{y^{2}}{2 -k} - dfrac{x^{2}}{2k -1} =1) [since multiplying numerator and denominator by -1]Wait, no. If we factor out -1 from denominator:(dfrac{y^{2}}{k -2} = dfrac{y²}{-(2 -k)}), so:(dfrac{y²}{-(2 -k)} - dfrac{x²}{1 - 2k} = -1)Multiply both sides by -1:(dfrac{y²}{2 -k} + dfrac{x²}{2k -1} =1)Wait, no:Starting from:(dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2} - dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k} = -1)Multiply both sides by -1:(-dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2} + dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k} =1)But this brings us back to the original equation. So another approach: to write the original equation in the standard vertical hyperbola form.Original equation: (dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k} - dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2}=1)For this to be a vertical hyperbola, we need to have the y² term positive. However, in the given equation, the y² term is subtracted, so it&#39;s negative. Therefore, to write it as a vertical hyperbola, we need to have the positive term with y², which requires:The coefficient of y² must be positive, and the coefficient of x² must be negative.The coefficient of y² is -1/(k - 2). Therefore, to have this coefficient positive:-1/(k - 2) &gt;0 =&gt; multiply numerator and denominator by -1:1/(2 -k) &gt;0, which requires 2 -k &gt;0 =&gt;k &lt;2.The coefficient of x² is 1/(1 -2k). To have this coefficient negative:1/(1 -2k) &lt;0 =&gt;1 -2k &lt;0 =&gt;k &gt;1/2.Therefore, combining these, 1/2 &lt;k &lt;2, which is interval A.Therefore, the answer is A. Hence, the options might have a typo, or perhaps the original problem had a different equation. But given the problem as stated, the correct answer should be A.However, in some textbooks, sometimes they exclude points where the hyperbola might have asymptotes with certain properties or something else, but there&#39;s no indication here. Since the problem only mentions foci on the y-axis, which is satisfied for k ∈ (1/2,2). Therefore, the correct answer is A.But since option B is given as a choice, perhaps the problem intended to have different denominators or there&#39;s a different interpretation. Wait, another way: Maybe the user made a typo in the equation? Let me check the original problem again.Original problem: (dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k}-dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2}=1). Yes. So I think my analysis is correct. The answer is A. But the given options include B, which is (1/2,1) ∪ (1,2). Unless there&#39;s a mistake when k=1, but as shown earlier, when k=1, the equation is y² - x²=1, which is a valid hyperbola with foci on y-axis. So k=1 is acceptable. Hence, A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the range of the real number ( k ) such that the given equation represents a hyperbola with foci on the ( y )-axis, we start by analyzing the given equation:[frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = 1]For the equation to represent a hyperbola, the coefficients of ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) must be of opposite signs. Additionally, for the foci to be on the ( y )-axis, the hyperbola must be vertical, meaning the positive term should be associated with ( y^2 ).1. Check the signs of the coefficients:   - The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is ( frac{1}{1 - 2k} ).   - The coefficient of ( y^2 ) is ( -frac{1}{k - 2} ).2. Conditions for a vertical hyperbola:   - The coefficient of ( y^2 ) must be positive, and the coefficient of ( x^2 ) must be negative.   - For ( -frac{1}{k - 2} ) to be positive, ( k - 2 ) must be negative, which implies ( k &lt; 2 ).   - For ( frac{1}{1 - 2k} ) to be negative, ( 1 - 2k ) must be negative, which implies ( k &gt; frac{1}{2} ).3. Combine the conditions:   - ( k &gt; frac{1}{2} ) and ( k &lt; 2 ).Thus, the range of ( k ) is ( left( frac{1}{2}, 2 right) ).4. Verification:   - When ( k = 1 ), the equation becomes ( y^2 - x^2 = 1 ), which is a valid hyperbola with foci on the ( y )-axis.   - The intervals ( left( frac{1}{2}, 1 right) ) and ( left( 1, 2 right) ) do not exclude any valid values of ( k ), including ( k = 1 ).Therefore, the correct answer is (boxed{A}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have this hyperbola equation: (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1. The question is asking for the range of the real number k such that the hyperbola has foci on the y-axis. The options are A through D. Hmm. I need to figure out the conditions under which the hyperbola&#39;s foci lie on the y-axis. First, I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola is either (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1 or (y²/b²) - (x²/a²) = 1, depending on whether it opens horizontally or vertically. The foci are located along the axis corresponding to the positive term. So, if the hyperbola opens up and down, the foci are on the y-axis, and if it opens left and right, they&#39;re on the x-axis. Therefore, for the foci to be on the y-axis, the hyperbola must be of the form (y²/b²) - (x²/a²) = 1. Looking at the given equation: (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1. To match the standard form with foci on the y-axis, I need to rearrange the terms so that the y² term is positive. That would mean the equation should be written as -(x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(k - 2) = -1, but wait, let me check that. Wait, starting with the original equation: (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1. To make the y² term positive, I can multiply both sides by -1, which would flip the signs of the denominators and the right-hand side. Let&#39;s do that:Multiplying both sides by -1 gives: -(x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(k - 2) = -1. But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps I should compare directly. In the standard hyperbola with vertical transverse axis (foci on y-axis), the equation is (y²/a²) - (x²/b²) = 1. So comparing this with the given equation, which is (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1. For it to be a vertical hyperbola, the y² term should be positive and the x² term negative. Therefore, the coefficients under y² and x² need to satisfy certain conditions.Let&#39;s denote A = 1/(1 - 2k) and B = -1/(k - 2). So the equation is A x² + B y² = 1. For it to be a hyperbola with vertical transverse axis, we need B &gt; 0 and A &lt; 0. Because the positive term corresponds to y². So, B = -1/(k - 2) &gt; 0. Let&#39;s solve that inequality. -1/(k - 2) &gt; 0. The numerator is -1, which is negative. So the denominator must also be negative to make the fraction positive. Therefore, k - 2 &lt; 0 =&gt; k &lt; 2. Similarly, A = 1/(1 - 2k) &lt; 0. So, 1/(1 - 2k) &lt; 0. That means the denominator 1 - 2k must be negative. Therefore, 1 - 2k &lt; 0 =&gt; -2k &lt; -1 =&gt; 2k &gt; 1 =&gt; k &gt; 1/2. So combining these two inequalities: k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2. Therefore, k is in (1/2, 2). But wait, the answer options have A as (1/2, 2), but option B is (1/2,1) union (1,2). Maybe there&#39;s a condition I&#39;m missing here. Let me check again.Wait, hyperbola requires that the denominators are not zero. So in the original equation, the denominators 1 - 2k and k - 2 cannot be zero. So 1 - 2k ≠ 0 =&gt; k ≠ 1/2, and k - 2 ≠ 0 =&gt; k ≠ 2. But since we already have k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2, the conditions are already excluding the endpoints. So k must be in (1/2, 2). But why is option B splitting it into two intervals? Maybe there&#39;s another constraint.Wait, the standard form of the hyperbola requires that both denominators are positive when the terms are arranged properly. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think again. The standard form for vertical hyperbola is (y²/a²) - (x²/b²) = 1, where a and b are positive real numbers. Therefore, in our case, after rearranging the given equation, to match this standard form, we need the coefficient under y² to be positive and the coefficient under x² to be negative. So, starting with the given equation:(x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1.To write it in the standard vertical hyperbola form, we need to have positive y² term and negative x² term. Let&#39;s rearrange:- (y²)/(k - 2) + (x²)/(1 - 2k) = 1.Multiply both sides by -1 to make the y² term positive:(y²)/(k - 2) - (x²)/(1 - 2k) = -1.But the standard form is (y²/a²) - (x²/b²) = 1. Here, we have equals -1, so perhaps multiplying both sides by -1 gives:- (y²)/(k - 2) + (x²)/(1 - 2k) = -1.Wait, maybe I need to adjust the equation so that the right-hand side is 1. Let me check:Original equation: (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1.Let me factor out the negative sign from the y² term:(x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(2 - k) = 1.Wait, because -(y²)/(k - 2) is equal to (y²)/(2 - k). So the equation can be written as (x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(2 - k) = 1. But for this to be a hyperbola, one of the terms must be positive and the other negative. Because in a hyperbola equation, the coefficients have opposite signs. So if we write it as (x²)/A + (y²)/B = 1, then either A or B must be negative, and the other positive. But in the original equation, when written as (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1, the coefficients of x² and y² are 1/(1 - 2k) and -1/(k - 2). For this to be a hyperbola, these coefficients must be of opposite sign. Wait, but since it&#39;s equal to 1, actually both terms should have denominators with signs such that one is positive and the other is negative. Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall that for the hyperbola equation in the form (x²)/A - (y²)/B = 1, the transverse axis is along the x-axis if A &gt; 0 and B &gt; 0, and along the y-axis if the equation is (y²)/A - (x²)/B = 1, with A &gt; 0 and B &gt; 0. Therefore, in our problem, we need the equation to be equivalent to (y²)/A - (x²)/B = 1, which would mean the transverse axis is along the y-axis, hence the foci are on the y-axis. Therefore, let&#39;s manipulate the given equation to match that form. Starting with the original equation:(x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1.To get the y² term positive, we can multiply both sides by -1:- (x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(k - 2) = -1.But then the right-hand side is -1, which isn&#39;t the standard form. However, if we multiply both sides by -1 again, we get back to the original equation. Hmm, perhaps instead, let&#39;s rearrange the terms:(y²)/(k - 2) - (x²)/(1 - 2k) = -1.But in order to make the right-hand side positive 1, we can multiply both sides by -1:- (y²)/(k - 2) + (x²)/(1 - 2k) = 1.But this is the original equation. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the given equation can be written as:(y²)/(- (k - 2)) - (x²)/(1 - 2k) = 1.Wait, that might not help. Let me think. Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that for the hyperbola to have foci on the y-axis, the positive term must be the y² term. Therefore, the coefficient of y² must be positive and the coefficient of x² must be negative. In the original equation, the coefficient of x² is 1/(1 - 2k), and the coefficient of y² is -1/(k - 2). Therefore, to have the y² term positive and the x² term negative, we need:-1/(k - 2) &gt; 0 and 1/(1 - 2k) &lt; 0.Solving these inequalities:For the y² coefficient: -1/(k - 2) &gt; 0.This implies that (k - 2) must be negative because the numerator is -1. So, k - 2 &lt; 0 =&gt; k &lt; 2.For the x² coefficient: 1/(1 - 2k) &lt; 0.This implies that the denominator (1 - 2k) is negative. Therefore, 1 - 2k &lt; 0 =&gt; 2k &gt; 1 =&gt; k &gt; 1/2.So combining both inequalities, we have 1/2 &lt; k &lt; 2. Therefore, k is in the interval (1/2, 2). But the answer options are A: (1/2, 2), B: (1/2,1)∪(1,2), C: (1,2), D: (1/2, ∞). So according to this, the answer should be A. But the system is giving an option B as well. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake here. Wait, maybe when k=1, something happens? Let me check if k=1 is allowed. If k=1, then the original equation becomes:(x²)/(1 - 2*1) - (y²)/(1 - 2) = 1 =&gt; (x²)/(-1) - (y²)/(-1) = 1 =&gt; -x² + y² = 1 =&gt; y² - x² = 1, which is a standard hyperbola opening upwards and downwards. So foci are on the y-axis. So k=1 is allowed. So why is option B excluding k=1? It seems like k=1 is valid. Wait, maybe there&#39;s another condition. Let&#39;s check if the denominators 1 - 2k and k - 2 can&#39;t be zero. We already have k ≠ 1/2 and k ≠ 2, but those are already excluded since k &gt; 1/2 and k &lt; 2. So k=1 is within (1/2, 2) and doesn&#39;t cause any denominator to be zero. Therefore, why is option B splitting the interval? Maybe the problem is that when k=1, both denominators become -1 and -1. Wait, let&#39;s substitute k=1:Denominator under x²: 1 - 2k = 1 - 2 = -1.Denominator under y²: k - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1.But in the equation, we have x² divided by -1 and y² divided by -1, but the original equation is (x²)/(-1) - (y²)/(-1) = 1 =&gt; -x² + y² = 1, which is y² - x² = 1, a valid hyperbola. So k=1 is okay.Wait, maybe the problem arises when 1 - 2k = -(k - 2). Let&#39;s check:1 - 2k = -(k - 2) =&gt; 1 - 2k = -k + 2 =&gt; 1 - 2k + k - 2 = 0 =&gt; -k -1 = 0 =&gt; k = -1. But k=-1 is outside the interval (1/2, 2), so that&#39;s not relevant here.Alternatively, perhaps when k=1, the hyperbola becomes rectangular? But even so, it&#39;s still a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis. Hmmm.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s recall that in the standard hyperbola equation, the denominators must be positive when written in the form (y²/a²) - (x²/b²) = 1. So let&#39;s rearrange the given equation to that form.Starting with:(x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1.We can rewrite this as:- (y²)/(k - 2) + (x²)/(1 - 2k) = 1.Multiply both sides by -1:(y²)/(k - 2) - (x²)/(1 - 2k) = -1.Multiply both sides by -1 again:- (y²)/(k - 2) + (x²)/(1 - 2k) = 1.Wait, this seems like going in circles. Alternatively, maybe we need to write the given equation in the standard form by swapping the terms. Let&#39;s try:Given equation: (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) = 1.We need this to be equivalent to (y²)/A - (x²)/B = 1. So, let&#39;s factor out the negative sign from the y² term:(x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(2 - k) = 1.Now, for this to be a hyperbola, one of the denominators must be positive and the other negative. Because in a hyperbola, the coefficients of the squared terms have opposite signs.So, if the equation is (x²)/C + (y²)/D = 1, then for a hyperbola, C and D must have opposite signs. Therefore, either:1. C &gt; 0 and D &lt; 0, which would make it a horizontal hyperbola (since the x² term is positive), or2. C &lt; 0 and D &gt; 0, which would make it a vertical hyperbola (since the y² term is positive).But in our case, we want the foci on the y-axis, which corresponds to a vertical hyperbola. Therefore, we need the y² term to be positive and the x² term to be negative. Therefore:C = (1 - 2k) must be negative (since the x² term&#39;s denominator is 1 - 2k, but in the equation, it&#39;s (x²)/C + (y²)/D =1, so if C is negative, then the x² term is negative) and D = (2 - k) must be positive. Therefore:1 - 2k &lt; 0 =&gt; k &gt; 1/2,and2 - k &gt; 0 =&gt; k &lt; 2.Hence, combining both, k must be in (1/2, 2). Therefore, the answer should be A. But option B is (1/2,1)∪(1,2). Maybe there&#39;s an exclusion when k=1? Let me check when k=1.If k=1, then the equation becomes:(x²)/(1 - 2*1) - (y²)/(1 - 2) = (x²)/(-1) - (y²)/(-1) = -x² + y² = 1 =&gt; y² - x² = 1.This is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening upwards and downwards. The foci are on the y-axis, located at (0, ±√(a² + b²)). Here, a²=1, b²=1, so foci at (0, ±√2). So it&#39;s a valid hyperbola with foci on the y-axis. Therefore, k=1 is acceptable. So why is option B excluding k=1? There must be a misunderstanding.Wait, perhaps the problem is with the denominators not just being non-zero, but also ensuring that both terms are present. Wait, if k=1, then the denominators are -1 and -1, but the equation becomes y² - x² =1, which is fine. So k=1 is okay.Alternatively, maybe the original equation cannot be a hyperbola if 1 - 2k = k - 2, which would make the denominators equal. Let&#39;s check:1 - 2k = k - 2 =&gt; 1 + 2 = 3k =&gt; 3 = 3k =&gt; k=1. So when k=1, the denominators are both -1. But even then, the equation is still a hyperbola. So k=1 is allowed.Wait, perhaps the answer is A, but the options suggest that B is correct. Wait, let me check the answer options again.A: (1/2, 2)B: (1/2,1)∪(1,2)C: (1,2)D: (1/2, ∞)The options are given. So according to my reasoning, the correct interval is (1/2, 2), which is option A. But maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check the conditions.The hyperbola must have the form (y²)/A - (x²)/B =1, which requires that A and B are positive. So, given the original equation:(x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) =1.To write it in the desired form, we need to have the y² term positive and the x² term negative. Let&#39;s rearrange:- (y²)/(k - 2) = 1 - (x²)/(1 - 2k).Multiply both sides by -1:(y²)/(k - 2) = -1 + (x²)/(1 - 2k).But this isn&#39;t helpful. Let&#39;s instead consider:Original equation:(x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2) =1.To get it into the form (y²)/A - (x²)/B =1, we can factor out the negative sign from the y² term:(x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(2 - k) =1.But for this to be a hyperbola, the coefficients must have opposite signs. Therefore:Either (1 - 2k) &gt;0 and (2 - k) &lt;0, which would imply k &lt;1/2 and k &gt;2, which is impossible.Or (1 - 2k) &lt;0 and (2 - k) &gt;0, which gives k &gt;1/2 and k &lt;2, which is the interval (1/2,2). Therefore, this confirms that k must be in (1/2,2). Therefore, the answer should be A.But why is option B there? Is there a mistake in my reasoning? Let me check if there&#39;s a different interpretation. Maybe the equation is not in standard form because the denominators could be equal when k=1, but that doesn&#39;t prevent it from being a hyperbola. Even if both denominators are the same, as in k=1, it&#39;s still a hyperbola. For example, y² - x² =1 is a hyperbola with a=b=1.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a restriction that denominators cannot be equal? But I don&#39;t recall such a condition. The hyperbola just needs the coefficients to have opposite signs. The values of the denominators don&#39;t need to be distinct. Therefore, k=1 is acceptable, so the interval should be (1/2,2), which is option A.Therefore, maybe the answer is A. But I need to check again.Wait, let&#39;s check with k=3/2, which is in the interval (1/2,2). Let&#39;s choose k=1.5.Then the equation becomes:(x²)/(1 - 3) - (y²)/(1.5 - 2) = (x²)/(-2) - (y²)/(-0.5) = -x²/2 + y²/0.5 =1.Multiplying both sides by 1, we get: -x²/2 + y²/0.5 =1 =&gt; y²/0.5 - x²/2 =1, which is a hyperbola opening upwards and downwards. The denominators are positive for y² (0.5) and negative for x² (-2), but since we moved the negative sign, it&#39;s a vertical hyperbola. So foci are on the y-axis. So it&#39;s valid.Similarly, take k=1, as before, it&#39;s valid.Take k approaching 2 from below, say k=1.9:Denominator under x²:1 - 2*1.9=1 -3.8= -2.8Denominator under y²:k -2=1.9 -2= -0.1Equation: x²/(-2.8) - y²/(-0.1)=1 =&gt; -x²/2.8 + y²/0.1 =1 =&gt; y²/0.1 -x²/2.8 =1, which is a vertical hyperbola.Similarly, take k approaching 1/2 from above, say k=0.6:Denominator under x²:1 -2*0.6=1 -1.2= -0.2Denominator under y²:0.6 -2= -1.4Equation: x²/(-0.2) - y²/(-1.4)=1 =&gt; -x²/0.2 + y²/1.4=1 =&gt; y²/1.4 -x²/0.2=1, vertical hyperbola.Therefore, all k in (1/2,2) are valid, including k=1. Therefore, the answer should be A.But the system&#39;s options have B as (1/2,1)∪(1,2). Maybe the original problem had a typo, or I&#39;m missing something. Let me check once again.Wait, another possible angle: For the hyperbola, the denominators must not only be opposite in sign but also non-zero. However, we already considered that k≠1/2 and k≠2, which are excluded by the inequalities k&gt;1/2 and k&lt;2. Therefore, all k in (1/2,2) are valid. Hence, answer A.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that 1 - 2k ≠ -(k - 2) to avoid a circle? Wait, 1 -2k = -(k - 2) =&gt; 1 -2k = -k +2 =&gt; -k =1 =&gt;k= -1. Which is outside the interval. So even if k=-1, which isn&#39;t in our range, so no issue.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when k=1, it&#39;s a rectangular hyperbola? But rectangular hyperbola is still a hyperbola. So foci are still on the y-axis. Therefore, no problem.Therefore, I think the correct answer is A. But since the options include B, perhaps the textbook or problem source considers something else. Wait, but according to standard hyperbola definitions, the interval is (1/2,2). Therefore, I think the answer is A.But since the options given include B, I need to check again. Wait, let me check the original equation. The original equation is (x²)/(1 - 2k) - (y²)/(k - 2)=1. Suppose k=1, which is in the interval (1/2,2). Then denominators are 1 -2(1)= -1 and 1 -2= -1. Therefore, the equation is (x²)/(-1) - (y²)/(-1)=1 =&gt; -x² + y²=1 =&gt; y² -x²=1. That&#39;s a hyperbola, correct. So k=1 is okay.But maybe the problem requires that the denominators are not equal? But why would that be a requirement? The hyperbola can have different or equal denominators. So I don&#39;t see why k=1 would be excluded. Therefore, the answer must be A.But let&#39;s check the options again. If the answer is A, but the system&#39;s options include B, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let&#39;s check when k=1. If k=1, then 1 -2k = -1 and k -2 = -1. So the equation is (x²)/(-1) - (y²)/(-1)=1, which is -x² + y²=1, or y² -x²=1, which is a hyperbola. So yes, foci on y-axis. So k=1 is valid. Therefore, the correct interval is (1/2,2), so answer A.But in the options given, the answer might be B due to a different reasoning. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement? Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that the hyperbola is not degenerate, but even so, k=1 doesn&#39;t make it degenerate. The hyperbola is fine.Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the equation is supposed to be (x²)/(1 - 2k) + (y²)/(k - 2)=1, but that&#39;s not the case here. The equation given is definitely a subtraction. So I think the answer is A. Therefore, unless there&#39;s a hidden condition I&#39;m missing, the answer is A. But given that the options are presented and B is a common trick answer, I need to verify once more.Wait, perhaps the hyperbola can&#39;t have equal denominators? But the denominators being equal doesn&#39;t affect the hyperbola&#39;s validity. For example, y²/4 -x²/4=1 is still a hyperbola, just with a=b. So that&#39;s a rectangular hyperbola, but still a hyperbola. So even if 1 -2k = -(k -2), which would imply k=-1, which is outside the interval. So no, even with k=1, the denominators are -1 and -1, but after adjusting signs, it&#39;s a valid hyperbola. So I think the answer is A.Therefore, after careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is A: (1/2,2). But the option B is presented as a possible answer. However, according to the analysis, B excludes k=1 unnecessarily, so A is correct. Maybe the answer is A.Wait, the problem says &quot;the range of the real number k&quot;, and the options include A and B. Since when k=1, the equation is still a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis, then k=1 is allowed, so the interval should include it. Therefore, the answer must be A. So unless there&#39;s a miscalculation, I will go with A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the range of the real number ( k ) such that the given equation represents a hyperbola with foci on the ( y )-axis, we start with the equation:[frac{x^2}{1 - 2k} - frac{y^2}{k - 2} = 1]For the hyperbola to have foci on the ( y )-axis, it must be of the form (frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1). This requires the coefficient of ( y^2 ) to be positive and the coefficient of ( x^2 ) to be negative.1. Coefficient of ( y^2 ):   [   -frac{1}{k - 2} &gt; 0   ]   This implies ( k - 2 &lt; 0 ), hence ( k &lt; 2 ).2. Coefficient of ( x^2 ):   [   frac{1}{1 - 2k} &lt; 0   ]   This implies ( 1 - 2k &lt; 0 ), hence ( k &gt; frac{1}{2} ).Combining these inequalities, we get ( frac{1}{2} &lt; k &lt; 2 ).We also need to ensure the denominators are non-zero:- ( 1 - 2k neq 0 ) implies ( k neq frac{1}{2} )- ( k - 2 neq 0 ) implies ( k neq 2 )However, these points are already excluded by the interval ( (frac{1}{2}, 2) ). Checking ( k = 1 ) confirms it is valid as the equation becomes ( y^2 - x^2 = 1 ), a valid hyperbola with foci on the ( y )-axis.Thus, the range of ( k ) is ( (frac{1}{2}, 2) ).[boxed{A}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🔑:</span>According to the problem, if dfrac{x^{2}}{1-2k}-dfrac{y^{2}}{k-2}=1 represents a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis,  then we have begin{cases} 1-2k &lt; 0  k-2 &lt; 0 end{cases},  solving this yields dfrac{1}{2} &lt; k &lt; 2,  thus, the range of k is (dfrac{1}{2},2);  Therefore, the correct choice is: boxed{A}.

Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding what exactly the problem is asking. First, let&#39;s denote the two primes as p and q, and without loss of generality, let&#39;s assume that p &gt; q. The difference of their squares is p² - q², which needs to be a prime number. So the equation we&#39;re looking at is p² - q² = prime. Wait, I remember that p² - q² can be factored into (p - q)(p + q). So the expression becomes (p - q)(p + q). Now, since we&#39;re dealing with primes here, p and q are both primes greater than or equal to 2. But the product (p - q)(p + q) has to be a prime number. Primes have only two positive divisors: 1 and themselves. So, for the product of two numbers (p - q) and (p + q) to be prime, one of them must be 1 and the other must be the prime itself. Because if either of them was a composite number, then the product would have more divisors, hence not prime. Therefore, either (p - q) = 1 and (p + q) is prime, or (p + q) = 1 and (p - q) is prime. But since p and q are primes, and p &gt; q, both p and q are at least 2, so p + q would be at least 4, which is greater than 1. Hence, the second case (p + q = 1) is impossible. Therefore, the only possible case is (p - q) = 1 and (p + q) is a prime number. So, now we have p - q = 1, meaning that p and q are consecutive primes with a difference of 1. But wait, the only pair of consecutive primes is 2 and 3, since all other primes are odd numbers and differ by at least 2 (since even numbers greater than 2 are not prime). For example, 3 and 5 differ by 2, 5 and 7 differ by 2, etc. So the only primes that are consecutive integers are 2 and 3. Therefore, the pair (p, q) could be (3, 2). Let&#39;s check this. If p = 3 and q = 2, then p² - q² = 9 - 4 = 5, which is prime. So that works. But wait, are there any other possible pairs? Let&#39;s think again. If (p - q) must be 1, then p = q + 1. Since primes greater than 2 are odd, then q must be even (i.e., 2), because if q is an odd prime, then p = q + 1 would be even, hence p would have to be 2. But if q is odd and greater than 2, p = q + 1 would be even and greater than 2, which is not prime. Hence, the only possible q is 2, leading to p = 3. So the only pair is (3, 2). But let&#39;s verify this. Are there any other primes where p - q = 1? For example, if q = 2, p = 3. If q = 3, then p would be 4, which is not prime. Similarly, q = 5, p = 6 (not prime), etc. So indeed, the only possible pair is (3, 2). Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Suppose there&#39;s a pair where p and q are primes such that p - q is not 1, but the product (p - q)(p + q) is prime. Since primes are greater than 1, the only way this product is prime is if one of the factors is 1 and the other is prime, as before. But as we established, the only possible case where p - q = 1 is (3,2). But let&#39;s check for other possibilities. For example, maybe p + q is 1? But p and q are primes, so the smallest p + q could be 2 + 2 = 4. So that&#39;s not possible. So indeed, the only case is when p - q = 1, leading to (3,2). But let&#39;s test another pair. Suppose p = 5 and q = 2. Then p² - q² = 25 - 4 = 21, which is 3*7, not prime. If p = 5 and q = 3, difference is 25 - 9 = 16, which is not prime. If p = 7 and q = 2, 49 - 4 = 45 = 9*5, not prime. If p = 7 and q = 3, 49 - 9 = 40 = 8*5, not prime. If p = 7 and q = 5, 49 -25 =24, not prime. What about p = 2 and q = 2? Then the difference is 0, which is not prime. If p = 2 and q = 3, but since p must be greater than q, that&#39;s not allowed. So maybe only (3,2). Alternatively, what if the primes are the same? Then p² - q² = 0, which isn&#39;t prime. So that&#39;s out. Another approach: Let&#39;s suppose that (p - q)(p + q) is prime. Then, since primes have only two positive divisors, 1 and themselves, the product can only be prime if one of the factors is 1. Therefore, either p - q =1 or p + q =1. But p + q cannot be 1 since primes are at least 2, so p + q ≥ 4. Therefore, p - q =1. So the only possible pair is (3,2). But let me check once more. Let&#39;s suppose that p - q =1. Then, since primes are mostly odd, except for 2. So if q is even (i.e., 2), then p =3, which is odd. If q is odd, then p = q +1, which would be even. The only even prime is 2, so q +1 =2 implies q=1, but 1 isn&#39;t prime. Therefore, the only possible case is q=2, leading to p=3. Therefore, the only pair is (3,2). But wait, let me check another way. Let&#39;s take all primes and compute their squares and differences. Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Compute p² - q² for p &gt; q:3² -2²=9-4=5 (prime) → valid.5² -2²=25-4=21 (not prime).5² -3²=25-9=16 (not prime).7² -2²=49-4=45 (not prime).7² -3²=49-9=40 (not prime).7² -5²=49-25=24 (not prime).11² -2²=121-4=117 (not prime).11² -3²=121-9=112 (not prime).11² -5²=121-25=96 (not prime).11² -7²=121-49=72 (not prime).13² -2²=169-4=165 (not prime).Similarly, it&#39;s clear that all other differences result in composite numbers. So the only valid pair is (3,2). Therefore, the answer is the pair (2,3) or (3,2), but since we need pairs and order might matter? Wait, the problem says &quot;pairs of prime numbers&quot;, so perhaps order doesn&#39;t matter. But since p &gt; q, we can present it as (3,2). Alternatively, maybe both orders are considered, but since the difference is squared, (3,2) gives 5, whereas (2,3) would give negative, but since the difference is squared, maybe it&#39;s absolute. But the problem says &quot;the difference of the squares&quot;, so perhaps it&#39;s p² - q², so p must be larger. Therefore, the only pair is (3,2). Hence, the final answer should be the pair (2,3) where 3² -2²=5 is prime. But depending on notation, it might be written as (3,2). Either way, the two primes are 2 and 3. So, all pairs are (2,3) and (3,2), but since the difference of squares is the same in absolute value, but the problem might be considering ordered pairs where the first is larger. But perhaps the problem considers unordered pairs. However, the problem statement says &quot;pairs&quot;, which in mathematics can sometimes be unordered, but in some contexts ordered. However, since p² - q² is not the same as q² - p² unless p=q, but since p and q are distinct, the pair (2,3) and (3,2) would give different differences. But the problem says &quot;the difference of the squares&quot;, which could be interpreted as a non-negative value. Wait, but in the problem statement, does it specify which is subtracted from which? Let me check. The problem states: &quot;the difference of the squares of which is a prime number.&quot; The wording &quot;difference of the squares&quot; could be ambiguous, but in mathematics, the difference is typically taken as the absolute value. However, sometimes it&#39;s considered as the result of subtraction in order. But since primes are positive, perhaps the problem requires that p² - q² is prime, where p and q are primes, and p &gt; q. Given that, the pair would be (3,2), since 3² -2²=5, which is prime. If we take (2,3), then 2² -3²= -5, which is not prime (since primes are positive). Hence, the only valid ordered pair is (3,2). Therefore, the answer is the pair (3,2). Alternatively, if unordered, then {2,3}, but in the answer, the problem says &quot;pairs&quot;, so maybe ordered. But the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify order. Hmm. But regardless, the two primes involved are 2 and 3. So the only pair is 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer is boxed{(2, 3)} or boxed{(3, 2)}. But according to the standard way of presenting pairs where the difference is considered, maybe (3, 2) since p &gt; q. But in any case, the primes are 2 and 3. Let me check once more to ensure there are no other pairs. Suppose there is a prime q such that q +1 is also prime. As discussed earlier, the only consecutive primes are 2 and 3. All other primes are odd, so adding 1 would make them even and hence non-prime (except for 2). Therefore, 2 and 3 are the only consecutive primes. Therefore, the only pair is 2 and 3, leading to the difference of squares being 5, which is prime. Thus, the final answer is the pair (2,3) or (3,2). The problem might expect the ordered pair where the larger prime comes first, so (3,2). But in some contexts, the order might not matter. However, since the difference of squares is 5 only when the larger one is first, perhaps the answer is (3,2). But to be safe, given that the problem asks for pairs without specifying order, maybe both orders are acceptable. But in mathematical problems, pairs can sometimes be ordered. However, since the problem mentions &quot;the difference of the squares&quot;, which would be positive if we subtract the smaller square from the larger one, but in mathematical terms, difference can be signed. However, since primes are positive integers, the difference here must be a positive prime. Hence, we need p &gt; q such that p² - q² is prime. Therefore, the ordered pair (3,2). But in the answer, perhaps the primes are just listed as a pair, so {2,3} or (2,3). But I need to check the problem statement again. The problem says: &quot;Find all pairs of prime numbers, the difference of the squares of which is a prime number.&quot;So, &quot;pairs&quot; here probably refers to unordered pairs, since the difference of squares is a prime, regardless of order. But actually, since p² - q² is different from q² - p² unless p=q, which they can&#39;t be. So if we consider ordered pairs, then only (3,2) works. If unordered, then {2,3} is the pair. But the problem says &quot;pairs&quot;, which in mathematics usually can be ordered or unordered depending on context. Since the difference of squares is not symmetric, but the problem might consider the absolute difference. Wait, but in the problem statement, the difference is not absolute. It says &quot;the difference of the squares&quot;, which would be p² - q². So if p &lt; q, the difference would be negative, which is not a prime. Therefore, the problem implicitly requires that p &gt; q so that p² - q² is positive. Therefore, the pair is ordered such that the first element is larger. Thus, the answer is (3,2), the ordered pair where 3² -2²=5 is prime. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{(3, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find all pairs of prime numbers ( (p, q) ) such that the difference of their squares is a prime number, we start by noting that the difference of squares can be factored as ( p^2 - q^2 = (p - q)(p + q) ). For this product to be a prime number, one of the factors must be 1 and the other must be a prime number.Since ( p ) and ( q ) are primes and ( p &gt; q ), the only way for ( (p - q) ) to be 1 is if ( p ) and ( q ) are consecutive primes. The only pair of consecutive primes is ( 2 ) and ( 3 ). Checking this pair:- If ( p = 3 ) and ( q = 2 ), then ( p^2 - q^2 = 3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5 ), which is a prime number.Other pairs of primes do not satisfy the condition because the difference of their squares results in a composite number. For example:- ( p = 5 ) and ( q = 2 ) gives ( 25 - 4 = 21 ) (not prime).- ( p = 5 ) and ( q = 3 ) gives ( 25 - 9 = 16 ) (not prime).Thus, the only pair of primes where the difference of their squares is a prime number is ( (3, 2) ).[boxed{(3, 2)}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is to find all pairs of prime numbers where the difference of their squares is a prime number. Let me try to think through this step by step.First, let&#39;s understand what exactly is being asked. We need two prime numbers, let&#39;s call them p and q, such that when we subtract the square of one from the square of the other, the result is also a prime number. The question is a bit ambiguous about the order, so I should check both possibilities: p² - q² and q² - p². But since subtraction is involved, the order matters. However, since primes are positive integers greater than 1, the squares will also be positive, so if p &gt; q, then p² - q² would be positive, and if q &gt; p, then q² - p² would be positive. But primes are by definition positive integers greater than 1, so the difference must also be a prime. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that p &gt; q, and just consider p² - q² being prime, because if q &gt; p, then we can just swap their roles. So we can just look for primes p and q where p &gt; q and p² - q² is prime.Now, let&#39;s recall that the difference of squares can be factored. The expression p² - q² factors into (p - q)(p + q). So we have:p² - q² = (p - q)(p + q)But we want this product to be a prime number. Now, prime numbers have only two positive divisors: 1 and themselves. Therefore, for (p - q)(p + q) to be prime, one of the factors must be 1 and the other must be a prime number. Since p and q are primes with p &gt; q, both p - q and p + q are positive integers. Let&#39;s denote:(p - q) = 1 and (p + q) = primeBecause if we set the smaller factor to 1, then the larger factor would be the prime number. Alternatively, if (p + q) = 1, but since p and q are primes greater than or equal to 2, their sum would be at least 4, so that&#39;s impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is (p - q) = 1 and (p + q) is a prime number.So, our problem reduces to finding primes p and q such that p - q = 1 and p + q is prime.But wait, primes differ by 1? The only primes that differ by 1 are 2 and 3, because all other primes are odd, and the difference between two odd numbers is even. So if two primes differ by 1, one of them must be even. The only even prime is 2. So the pair must be 2 and 3. Let&#39;s check that.Let&#39;s take p = 3 and q = 2. Then p² - q² = 9 - 4 = 5, which is prime. So that works. Are there any other primes that differ by 1? Let&#39;s see. The next primes after 3 are 5, 7, etc. If we take q = 2, then p would be 3. If we take q = 3, then p would be 4, which isn&#39;t prime. Similarly, q = 5, p would be 6, not prime. So the only pair where primes differ by 1 is (2, 3).Therefore, the only possible pair is (2, 3), and indeed, 3² - 2² = 5, which is prime. But let me verify if there are any other possibilities where maybe (p - q) isn&#39;t 1, but somehow the product (p - q)(p + q) is still prime. Wait, but if (p - q) is greater than 1, then both (p - q) and (p + q) would be factors of the prime number. But a prime number can only be factored as 1 times itself. Therefore, if (p - q) &gt; 1, then (p - q) must equal the prime number, and (p + q) must equal 1. But (p + q) is at least 2 + 2 = 4, so that&#39;s impossible. Therefore, the only way the product (p - q)(p + q) is prime is if (p - q) = 1 and (p + q) is prime.Hence, the only possible pair is when p and q are primes differing by 1, which can only be 2 and 3.Wait, but let&#39;s double-check with some examples. Let&#39;s take other primes and see.Take p = 5 and q = 2. Then 25 - 4 = 21, which is not prime.p = 5, q = 3: 25 - 9 = 16, not prime.p = 7, q = 2: 49 - 4 = 45, not prime.p = 7, q = 3: 49 - 9 = 40, not prime.p = 7, q = 5: 49 - 25 = 24, not prime.p = 11, q = 2: 121 - 4 = 117, not prime.So seems like only 3 and 2 work.But let me check another pair where p - q is not 1 but maybe their sum and difference multiply to a prime. Wait, but if p - q is 2, then (p - q)(p + q) would be 2*(p + q). For that product to be prime, 2 must be multiplied by something to get a prime. But primes other than 2 are odd. So 2*(p + q) can only be prime if (p + q) is a prime and 2*(p + q) is prime. But 2*(prime) is only prime if (prime) is 2, so 2*2=4, which is not prime. Therefore, even if p - q = 2, then (p - q)(p + q) would be 2*(p + q). For that to be prime, 2*(p + q) must be prime, which requires p + q = 1.5, which is impossible. So no solution here.Similarly, if p - q = 3, then 3*(p + q) would have to be prime, which would require p + q = 1, which again is impossible. Therefore, the only possible way is p - q =1 and p + q is prime. Which gives us the pair 2 and 3.Wait, but let me check if there are other primes where p - q =1. For example, next primes after 3 is 5. So q = 5, p =6, which is not prime. Similarly, q=7, p=8, not prime. So no. The only consecutive primes differing by 1 are 2 and 3.Therefore, the only pair is (2,3), but let&#39;s check if reversing them would make sense. If we take q=3 and p=2, then p² - q² would be negative. Since primes are positive integers greater than 1, negative numbers aren&#39;t considered primes. So the only valid pair is when p=3 and q=2, leading to a positive prime difference of 5.Therefore, the only pair is (3,2), but since the problem says &quot;pairs&quot;, which are unordered, but in some contexts, ordered pairs. But since the difference of squares is signed, but we need the result to be a prime, which is positive, so the pair is unordered. Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;pairs of prime numbers&quot;, so probably unordered. So {2,3} is the pair.But let&#39;s confirm once again. Let&#39;s see, suppose we take primes p and q where p² - q² is prime. Then, if p=2 and q= another prime, then p=2, q= other prime.Let&#39;s compute 2² - q² = 4 - q². Since q² is at least 4 (if q=2), then 4 - 4=0, which is not prime. If q is 3, then 4 -9= -5, which is not positive. So p=2 can&#39;t be the larger prime. Therefore, p must be greater than q, and p must be at least 3. So q=2 and p=3 is the only case where p - q=1, leading to p² - q²=5, which is prime.Alternatively, could there be a case where p - q=1, but with larger primes? For example, primes p and q where p = q +1. But since except for 2 and 3, primes are odd numbers. If q is an odd prime, then p = q +1 would be even, hence p would have to be 2. But q would then be 1, which is not a prime. Hence, the only case is q=2, p=3.So, yes, the only pair is 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer is the pair (2,3).Wait, but let me check one more time. Let&#39;s suppose that we have two primes p and q, with p &gt; q, and p² - q² is prime. As we saw, p² - q² = (p - q)(p + q). For this product to be prime, one factor is 1, the other is prime. Since p &gt; q and primes are at least 2, the only way for (p - q) =1 is possible when q=2 and p=3. Because next primes after 2 are 3, which is 1 away. Any higher primes would differ by at least 2, and since all primes after 2 are odd, the difference between two odd primes is even. So if p and q are both odd primes, then p - q is even. But if one of them is 2, then p - q can be odd. For example, 5 - 2=3, which is odd. But in such a case, let&#39;s check.Take p=5 and q=2. Then p² - q²=25 -4=21, which is 3*7, not prime. So even though p - q=3, the product (p - q)(p + q)=3*7=21 is composite. So that&#39;s not prime.Similarly, take p=7 and q=2. Then 49 -4=45=9*5, composite.Take p=3 and q=2: 9 -4=5, prime. So only this case works.So the conclusion is that the only pair is (2,3).But wait, let me check if there are any other pairs where even though (p - q) is not 1, but (p - q)(p + q) is a prime. For example, if (p - q)=prime and (p + q)=1. But since (p + q) is at least 2 +2=4, which is greater than 1, so that&#39;s impossible. Alternatively, if (p - q)=prime and (p + q)=1, but again, same problem. So the only way is (p - q)=1 and (p + q)=prime. So yes, the only possible pair is 2 and 3.Therefore, the answer should be the pair (2,3). Since the problem asks for all pairs, this is the only one.&lt;/think&gt;The pairs of prime numbers where the difference of their squares is a prime number can be found by analyzing the expression ( p^2 - q^2 ), which factors as ( (p - q)(p + q) ). For this product to be prime, one factor must be 1 and the other a prime number. Since primes are positive integers greater than 1, the only possibility is ( p - q = 1 ) and ( p + q ) being prime. Considering primes ( p ) and ( q ) where ( p &gt; q ), the only consecutive primes differing by 1 are 2 and 3. Checking this pair:[3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5 quad (text{which is prime})]Other prime pairs result in composite differences. For example, larger primes would have differences of squares that factor into larger numbers, thus not prime. Therefore, the only valid pair is (2, 3).Answer: The only pair is boxed{(2, 3)}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a877af58></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a877af58><span class="icon" data-v-a877af58>🔑:</span>Let p and q be prime numbers and p^{2}-q^{2}=(p-q)(p+q) be a prime number.
