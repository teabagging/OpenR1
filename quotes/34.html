The catch is that both three-digit numbers must be divisible by 9. Hmm, right. Let me start by recalling the divisibility rule for 9: a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. So, for each three-digit number, the sum of its three digits must be divisible by 9. First, let me note that the digits available are 1 through 7. So the total sum of all digits is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28. Since we need to form two three-digit numbers, that uses 6 digits, leaving one digit unused. So the total sum used in the two numbers will be 28 minus the unused digit. Let&#39;s denote the unused digit as &#39;k&#39;. Then the sum of the two numbers will be 28 - k. But each number has to be divisible by 9, so the sum of each three-digit number must be a multiple of 9. Let&#39;s call the sum of the first number S1 and the second S2. Then S1 and S2 must each be divisible by 9, and S1 + S2 = 28 - k. Therefore, 28 - k must be equal to 9m + 9n = 9(m + n), where m and n are integers. So 28 - k must be divisible by 9. Therefore, 28 - k ≡ 0 mod 9 ⇒ k ≡ 28 mod 9. Since 28 divided by 9 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 28 ≡ 1 mod 9. Therefore, k ≡ 1 mod 9. Since k is a digit from 1 to 7, the only possible k that satisfies this is k=1. Because 1 ≡1 mod9. Wait, let&#39;s check: 28 -1=27, which is divisible by 9 (27/9=3). If k=1, then the total sum of the two numbers is 27, which can be divided as 9 and 18, 18 and 9, or 27 and 0. But since each number has to be a three-digit number, the sum can&#39;t be 0. So possible combinations are (9, 18) or (18,9). Wait, but 27 divided by two numbers each divisible by 9. So 27 is 9*3, so the two numbers must be 9*a and 9*b where a + b = 3. The possible pairs (a,b) are (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0). But since each number is a three-digit number, their digit sums can&#39;t be 0 or 27. Wait, no, each number&#39;s digit sum must be divisible by 9. So S1 and S2 can be 9, 18. Because 9*1=9 and 9*2=18. 9*3=27 would require the sum to be 27, which would need all digits, but we have two numbers here. Wait, no, if the total sum is 27, then the two numbers can have sums of 9 and 18, since 9 + 18 = 27. So each three-digit number&#39;s digits sum to either 9 or 18. So the possible pairs for the sums of the two numbers are (9, 18). The order might matter if the numbers are considered different based on their position, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify if the two numbers are distinguishable (like one being first and the other second) or if they are considered the same pair regardless of order. Hmm, the question says &quot;how many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, so probably the order matters since different arrangements count as different ways. Wait, but actually, when you glue the cards into numbers, the numbers themselves are different based on the digits and their order. So for example, 123 and 456 would be different from 456 and 123 if the order matters. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify whether the two numbers are ordered (like a first and a second) or unordered. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous, but in combinatorial problems like this, unless specified otherwise, sometimes we assume that the two numbers are unordered, so swapping them doesn&#39;t count as a different way. But maybe in this case, since the process of &quot;gluing&quot; could imply that making one number first and then the other, which would make the order matter. Wait, but the problem is in Russian, and the translation is &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. The original might have been more precise. But since the user hasn&#39;t specified, I might need to proceed with the assumption that the order matters. However, perhaps the answer expects the count where the two numbers are considered unordered. Hmm, this is a bit of a problem. Wait, but let&#39;s first figure out the possible sums. So regardless of order, the two numbers must have sums of 9 and 18. So first, we need to determine which subsets of three digits sum to 9 or 18, and then the remaining three digits (since one is unused) must sum to 18 or 9, respectively. Wait, no. Wait, total sum used is 27. So if one number has a sum of 9, the other must have a sum of 18. So the possible ways are: choose a subset of three digits that sum to 9, then the remaining three digits (excluding the unused 1) must sum to 18. Alternatively, a subset of three digits that sum to 18, and the remaining three digits sum to 9. So the key is to find all possible subsets of three digits (from 1-7, excluding 1) that sum to 9 or 18, then the other subset is determined. But wait, the unused digit is 1, right? Because earlier we determined that k must be 1. So we must leave out the digit 1, so all other digits (2,3,4,5,6,7) are used in the two numbers. So the total sum is 28 -1=27. So the two numbers must each use three digits from the remaining six digits (2,3,4,5,6,7), such that one triplet sums to 9 and the other triplet sums to 18, or vice versa. Wait, but 27 divided into two triplets, each summing to 9 and 18. So first, find all triplets from 2,3,4,5,6,7 that sum to 9 or 18. Then, for each such triplet, the remaining three digits will sum to 18 or 9, respectively. Then, for each valid triplet, we can compute the number of three-digit numbers they can form, considering permutations, and similarly for the other triplet. Then multiply the numbers for each triplet and sum over all valid splits. Then, since the two numbers can be ordered (if order matters) or not. Wait, but let&#39;s take it step by step.First, confirm that the unused digit must be 1. Since 28 -k must be divisible by 9, so k=1. Therefore, the digits used are 2,3,4,5,6,7. These are six digits, split into two triplets. One triplet sums to 9, the other to 18. Because 9 + 18 = 27. So first, let&#39;s find all possible triplets from 2,3,4,5,6,7 that sum to 9. Then the remaining three will automatically sum to 18. Similarly, triplets summing to 18 would leave the remaining three summing to 9. But since 9 is smaller, maybe there are fewer triplets summing to 18. Let&#39;s check.First, triplets summing to 9. The digits available are 2,3,4,5,6,7. So we need three distinct digits from these that add up to 9. Let&#39;s list them:Possible triplets:Start with the smallest digit, 2:2,3,4: 2+3+4=9. That&#39;s one.2,3,5: 2+3+5=10. Too big.Wait, 2,3,4=9. Next, 2,3,5=10. Too big. So next, 2,4, something. 2,4,3 is same as above. 2,4,5=11. 2,4,6=12. All too big. So 2 can only pair with 3 and 4. Next, start with 3:3,4,2: same as above. 3,5,1: but 1 is excluded. Wait, digits are 2,3,4,5,6,7. So 3,5,1 is invalid. So next, 3,4,2 is already considered. 3,5,1 invalid. 3,5, anything else: 3+5+? Let&#39;s see: 3+5+1=9, but 1 is excluded. 3+5+2=10, which is already too big. So no triplet starting with 3,5. 3,6, anything: 3+6=9, so 3+6+0=9, but 0 isn&#39;t there. Wait, no, 3+6+ something. Wait, 3+6+0 is not possible. Wait, digits are from 2 to 7. 3,6,? 3+6+ something. The smallest possible sum would be 3+6+2=11, which is over 9. So no. Similarly, 3,7,? 3+7+ something is even bigger. So no triplet starting with 3 except 2,3,4. Wait, but 3 can only be in 2,3,4. Then, 4,5,? 4+5=9, but we need three digits. 4+5+?=9, so 4+5+0=9, which is impossible. So no. Next, 5,6,7: sum is 18. That&#39;s for the other triplet. So, seems like the only triplet summing to 9 is 2,3,4. Let me check again.Wait, 2,3,4=9. Any others? Let&#39;s see, 2,2,5=9 but duplicates aren&#39;t allowed. 2,4,3 same as above. What about 3,4,2 same. 2,5,2 invalid. 3,3,3=9 but duplicates. So, unique digits. So only one triplet: 2,3,4. Then the remaining three digits must be 5,6,7, which sum to 5+6+7=18. Perfect. So that&#39;s one split: {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Now, could there be another triplet summing to 9? Let&#39;s check again.Another approach: Let&#39;s see, starting with 2, what&#39;s the next digit? 2 and 3: then third digit needs to be 4. 2 and 4: third digit needs to be 3. 2 and 5: third digit needs to be 2, which is duplicate. Not allowed. So no. Then starting with 3: 3 and 4, then 2. 3 and 5: need 1, which is excluded. 3 and 6: need 0. So no. 4 and 5: need 0. So no. So indeed, only {2,3,4} sums to 9, and {5,6,7} sums to 18. So there&#39;s only one way to split the six digits into two triplets where one sums to 9 and the other to 18. Therefore, the only possible split is {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Now, the next step is to compute the number of three-digit numbers each triplet can form. For each triplet, the number of three-digit numbers is the number of permutations of the three digits, considering that if there are duplicate digits, we divide by the factorial of the number of duplicates. But in this case, all digits in each triplet are distinct. So for the triplet {2,3,4}, the number of three-digit numbers is 3! = 6. Similarly, for the triplet {5,6,7}, it&#39;s also 3! = 6. Therefore, for each split, the number of ways is 6 * 6 = 36. But since the two numbers can be arranged in two different orders (i.e., which triplet is first and which is second), unless the problem considers the pair unordered. Wait, if the problem considers the two numbers as an unordered pair, then we have to divide by 2. But if they are considered ordered (i.e., different sequences count as different ways), then we don&#39;t divide. Hmm. So here&#39;s the ambiguity. Let me check the problem statement again: &quot;how many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. The process of gluing might imply that creating two numbers, but not necessarily in order. However, in Russian problems, often when forming two numbers, the order might matter unless specified otherwise. But I need to check. Let&#39;s think: if you glue the cards into two numbers, the numbers are separate entities. So if you have two different numbers, swapping them would result in a different arrangement. For example, 234 and 567 is different from 567 and 234. But in reality, since we are using all the digits except 1, the two numbers are determined by their digits. So if the two triplets are {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}, then each can form 6 numbers, and pairing each number from the first triplet with each number from the second triplet would result in 6*6=36 ordered pairs. If the problem counts each ordered pair as a separate way, then the answer is 36. If it counts unordered pairs, then it&#39;s 36 divided by 2=18. But the problem says &quot;how many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. In Russian, &quot;glue them into two numbers&quot; typically would consider different orderings as different, because when you physically glue the cards, the order in which you arrange them matters. For example, first making 234 and then 567 is a different physical arrangement than making 567 first and then 234. However, if the problem is just about the set of two numbers, then the order wouldn&#39;t matter. But since we are talking about &quot;ways to glue&quot;, which is a physical action, the order might matter. However, in combinatorial problems without specific context, sometimes they consider arrangements where the order doesn&#39;t matter. But given that these are two distinct numbers (unless they are permutations of each other, which they aren&#39;t here), so each ordering is distinct. But wait, in this case, the two triplets {2,3,4} and {5,6,7} are distinct sets. So each permutation of the digits in the first triplet and the second triplet are unique numbers, and each combination of a number from the first and a number from the second is unique. So if you consider the two numbers as a sequence (first number and second number), then it&#39;s 6*6=36. If you consider them as a set where the order doesn&#39;t matter, then it&#39;s 36. Wait, no. If order doesn&#39;t matter, then each pair (A,B) is the same as (B,A). So the total number would be (6*6)/2=18. But we need to check if all pairs are distinct. For example, if the two numbers could be the same, which they can&#39;t here because the digits are different. Since the two triplets are {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}, any number formed by the first triplet is different from any number formed by the second triplet. Therefore, (A,B) and (B,A) are different, but since A and B are from different sets, they are different numbers. Wait, no. For example, if the first triplet is {2,3,4}, and the second is {5,6,7}, then any number from the first triplet will be 234,243,324, etc., all of which are different from any number from the second triplet, which are 567,576,657, etc. So the pair (234,567) is different from (567,234). If the problem counts these as two different ways, then total is 36. If it counts them as the same way, then it&#39;s 18. Given that the problem mentions &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, without specifying order, but in many combinatorial contexts, unless specified, the order is considered. For example, forming two numbers where one is first and the other is second. However, in some cases, it might be considered as a set. Since the problem is in Russian, maybe the original expects ordered pairs. Alternatively, maybe there is only one way to split the digits, leading to 6*6=36. However, let&#39;s check again if there are other possible splits. Wait, earlier we thought that only {2,3,4} and {5,6,7} are possible. But maybe there are other triplets in 2,3,4,5,6,7 that sum to 9 or 18. Let&#39;s verify again.Sum to 9:Possible triplet combinations:Start with 2, then look for two numbers that sum to 7 (since 9 -2=7). The available numbers are 3,4,5,6,7. So pairs that sum to 7: 3+4=7. So triplet is 2,3,4. Any other pairs? 5+2=7 but 5 is already used. Wait, 3+4=7. Next, if start with 3: 9 -3=6. Need two numbers that sum to 6: from 2,4,5,6,7. Possible pairs: 2+4=6. So triplet 3,2,4 which is same as before. 5+1=6 but 1 is excluded. 6+0=6 but no zero. So only 2+4. So triplet 3,2,4. Same as before. Next, start with 4: 9 -4=5. Need two numbers that sum to 5: from 2,3,5,6,7. Possible pairs: 2+3=5. So triplet 4,2,3. Same as before. Next, start with 5: 9 -5=4. Need two numbers summing to 4: from 2,3,4,6,7. Possible pairs: 2+2=4 (invalid), 3+1=4 (1 excluded). So no. Start with 6: 9-6=3. Need two numbers summing to 3: from 2,3,4,5,7. Only 2+1=3, but 1 is excluded. Start with 7: 9-7=2. Need two numbers summing to 2: impossible. So indeed, only one triplet {2,3,4} sums to 9.Now check for triplets summing to 18. Since the total sum is 27, if one triplet sums to 18, the other must sum to 9. But we already saw that the only triplet summing to 9 is {2,3,4}, so the corresponding triplet summing to 18 must be {5,6,7}. Let&#39;s verify. 5+6+7=18. Any other triplet?Check other triplets:Start with 7, need two numbers that sum to 11 (18-7=11). From 2,3,4,5,6. Possible pairs: 5+6=11. So triplet 7,5,6. Which is same as {5,6,7}. 4+7=11 but 7 is already used. Wait, no. 7 is already the starting digit. So pairs from remaining digits: 5+6=11. So triplet 7,5,6. Another possibility: 7,4,7 but duplicates. 3+8=11, but 8 not available. 2+9=11, 9 not available. So only 5+6. So triplet {5,6,7}. Similarly, starting with 6: 18-6=12. Need two numbers summing to 12 from 2,3,4,5,7. Possible pairs: 5+7=12, 4+8=12 (invalid), 3+9=12 (invalid). So triplet 6,5,7. Same as above. Starting with 5: 18-5=13. Need two numbers summing to 13 from 2,3,4,6,7. Possible pairs: 6+7=13. So triplet 5,6,7. Starting with 4: 18-4=14. Need two numbers summing to 14 from 2,3,5,6,7. Possible pairs: 7+7=14 (invalid), 6+8=14 (invalid). So no. Similarly, starting with 3: 18-3=15. Need two numbers summing to 15: 7+8=15 (invalid), 6+9=15 (invalid). So no. Starting with 2: 18-2=16. Need two numbers summing to 16: 9+7=16 (invalid), 8+8=16 (invalid). So no. Hence, the only triplet summing to 18 is {5,6,7}. Therefore, there is only one way to split the digits: {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Therefore, the two triplets are fixed. Now, each triplet can be arranged into 3! = 6 numbers. Since the two numbers are separate, the total number of ordered pairs is 6 * 6 = 36. However, if the problem considers the two numbers as an unordered pair (i.e., {ABC, DEF} is the same as {DEF, ABC}), then we need to divide by 2, giving 18. But which is it?Looking back at the problem statement: &quot;how many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. The word &quot;glue&quot; might imply that the order could matter if you&#39;re physically placing them next to each other, but in mathematical terms, unless specified, we usually consider different orderings as different. However, in some combinatorial problems where you&#39;re asked for the number of ways to choose or form groups, sometimes the order of the groups doesn&#39;t matter. For example, if you&#39;re asked how many ways to divide people into two groups, the order doesn&#39;t matter. But if you&#39;re asked how many ways to form a first and second group, it does. In this problem, it&#39;s not clear. Since the problem is about gluing them into two numbers, perhaps the order is considered. However, to be safe, we might need to consider both possibilities, but given the problem is from a competition or similar, likely expecting 36 as the answer. But let&#39;s check again.Wait, the problem says &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. If you imagine taking the six cards and arranging them into two separate three-digit numbers, the process would involve choosing an order for the digits in each number. However, the two numbers themselves could be considered as a set or as a sequence. For example, if you write both numbers on a paper, the order might not matter, but if you&#39;re creating two numbers in sequence, it might. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, I need to check standard combinatorial conventions. In problems like &quot;how many ways to split into two groups&quot;, usually order doesn&#39;t matter unless specified. But in this case, forming numbers, which are distinguishable by their digit values, and since different orderings lead to different entities, the answer is likely 36. However, I recall that in some similar problems, when two groups are formed and they are of the same size, you divide by 2. But here, the two numbers are both three-digit numbers, so same size. Wait, but in this case, the two numbers are made from different digits, so they are distinguishable not just by order but by their digits. For example, the triplet {2,3,4} can only form numbers like 234, 243, etc., while {5,6,7} forms 567, 576, etc. So each pair (234, 567) is different from (567, 234) because the numbers are different. However, if the problem counts these as the same &quot;way&quot; since it&#39;s just two numbers regardless of order, then it&#39;s 18. But this is ambiguous.Wait, let&#39;s think in terms of physical cards. Suppose you have six cards: 2,3,4,5,6,7. To glue them into two three-digit numbers, you need to arrange them into two groups of three and then each group into a number. The total number of ways would be the number of ways to partition the six cards into two groups of three, multiplied by the number of permutations within each group. But since the groups are distinguishable if the numbers are different, but in this case, since the two groups are different (one sums to 9, the other to 18), the partition is unique. Wait, in this case, there is only one way to partition the six cards into two groups of three: {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Because any other partition would not satisfy the sum conditions. Therefore, the number of ways is the number of permutations of the first group times the number of permutations of the second group. Which is 6 * 6 = 36. Therefore, the answer should be 36.But why did we consider the partition unique? Because we showed that only {2,3,4} and {5,6,7} are the possible triplets that sum to 9 and 18. Therefore, there&#39;s only one way to split the digits. Therefore, the total number of ways is 6 * 6 = 36. Therefore, the answer is 36. So I think that&#39;s the answer. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{36}.Final Answerboxed{36}&lt;/think&gt;Lёnya has cards with digits from 1 to 7. We need to determine how many ways there are to glue them into two three-digit numbers (one card will not be used) so that each of them is divisible by 9.1. Divisibility Rule for 9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.2. Total Sum of Digits: The sum of digits from 1 to 7 is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28).3. Unused Digit: Let (k) be the unused digit. The sum of the remaining digits is (28 - k), which must be divisible by 9. The only possible value for (k) is 1, as (28 - 1 = 27), which is divisible by 9.4. Remaining Digits: The digits used are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Their total sum is 27.5. Splitting the Digits: The two three-digit numbers must have digit sums of 9 and 18. The only possible triplet that sums to 9 is {2, 3, 4}, and the remaining triplet {5, 6, 7} sums to 18.6. Permutations: Each triplet can form (3!) (6) different three-digit numbers.7. Total Ways: The number of ways to form the two numbers is (6 times 6 = 36).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{36}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about Lenya having cards with digits from 1 to 7, and he wants to glue them into two three-digit numbers, with one card left unused. The catch is that each of the three-digit numbers must be divisible by 9. I need to figure out how many ways there are to do this. Hmm, alright.First, I remember that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. So, for each three-digit number Lenya creates, the sum of its three digits must be a multiple of 9. Since he&#39;s making two such numbers, the sum of all six digits used in both numbers must be divisible by 9 as well. But wait, the total sum of all digits from 1 to 7 is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28. If he uses six digits, the sum of those six digits must be divisible by 9. Then the remaining one digit (the unused one) would be 28 minus that sum. So, the key here is to figure out which digit to exclude so that the sum of the remaining six digits is divisible by 9.Let me check: 28 divided by 9 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So, 28 ≡ 1 mod 9. Therefore, the sum of the six digits used needs to be ≡ 0 mod 9, which means the excluded digit must be ≡ 1 mod 9. Since all digits are between 1 and 7, the only possible digit that is ≡1 mod9 is 1. Therefore, the excluded digit must be 1. Is that right? Wait, 28 - 1 = 27, which is divisible by 9. 27 divided by 9 is 3. So yes, if we exclude the digit 1, the remaining digits sum up to 27, which is divisible by 9. If we exclude any other digit, the sum would be 28 minus that digit. Let&#39;s check:If we exclude 2: 28 - 2 = 26, which is 26 mod9 = 8. Not divisible by 9.Exclude 3: 28 -3=25; 25 mod9=7. Not good.Exclude4: 28-4=24; 24 mod9=6. No.Exclude5: 28-5=23; 23 mod9=5. Nope.Exclude6: 28-6=22; 22 mod9=4.Exclude7:28-7=21; 21 mod9=3. Still not 0.So only excluding 1 gives a total sum of 27, which is 0 mod9. Therefore, the excluded digit must be 1. So, the two three-digit numbers are made from the digits 2,3,4,5,6,7, with one of them not used. Wait, no, actually, all except 1 are used. Wait, 1 is excluded, so all the digits 2,3,4,5,6,7 are used to make two three-digit numbers. Wait, but two three-digit numbers use six digits, so 1 is excluded. So, yes, all digits from 2 to 7 are used.But each three-digit number must have a digit sum divisible by 9. So, the first number, say ABC, must have A+B+C divisible by 9, and the second number DEF must have D+E+F divisible by 9. The total sum is 27, which is 0 mod9. Therefore, ABC + DEF ≡ 0 mod9. Since ABC ≡0 mod9 and DEF≡0 mod9, their sum is 0+0=0 mod9. So that works.Therefore, the problem reduces to partitioning the six digits 2,3,4,5,6,7 into two groups of three digits each, such that each group&#39;s sum is divisible by 9. Then, for each such partition, count the number of three-digit numbers that can be formed from each group (accounting for permutations), and then multiply them together. Then sum over all valid partitions.So, first step: find all possible ways to split the digits 2,3,4,5,6,7 into two groups of three digits where each group&#39;s sum is divisible by 9.Let&#39;s compute the sum of these six digits: 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27. So each group must sum to 9 or 18? Because 9 and 18 are the multiples of 9 less than 27. But 9*2=18, 9*3=27. Wait, the sum of all six digits is 27, so if each group must sum to a multiple of 9, then the two groups must sum to 9 and 18, because 9 + 18 = 27. Because 27 is the total sum, and each group is divisible by 9. Alternatively, both could be 13.5? No, impossible. So possible pairs are 9 and 18. Because 9*1 +9*2=9*3=27. So one group has sum 9, the other 18. There&#39;s no other possibility. So we need to split the six digits into two groups, one with sum 9 and the other with sum 18.Wait, let&#39;s confirm: the total sum is 27. So if each group&#39;s sum is divisible by 9, then possible group sums are 9 and 18 (since 9+18=27). Alternatively, both 27/2=13.5, which is not an integer, so no. So only possible is 9 and 18.Therefore, our task is to find all subsets of three digits from {2,3,4,5,6,7} that sum to 9. The remaining three digits will automatically sum to 18. Then, for each such subset, calculate the number of three-digit numbers possible for each group (considering permutations) and multiply them, then sum over all such subsets.First, let&#39;s find all triplets in {2,3,4,5,6,7} that sum to 9.Let me list all possible combinations:Start with the smallest digits:2,3,4: 2+3+4=9. That&#39;s one.Next, 2,3,5: 2+3+5=10. Too big.2,3,6: 11. 2,3,7:12. 2,4,5:11. 2,4,6:12. 2,4,7:13. 2,5,6:13. Etc. All these are over 9.Wait, maybe 2,3,4 is the only triplet with sum 9?Wait, check 3,4,2: same as above. Any other triplet?Wait, 3,5,1: but 1 is excluded. So, maybe 2,3,4 is the only triplet.Wait, let&#39;s check systematically:Possible combinations of three distinct digits from 2,3,4,5,6,7:Start with 2:2,3,4: sum 92,3,5: 102,3,6:112,3,7:122,4,5:112,4,6:122,4,7:132,5,6:132,5,7:142,6,7:153,4,5:123,4,6:133,4,7:143,5,6:143,5,7:153,6,7:164,5,6:154,5,7:164,6,7:175,6,7:18So, in the list above, the only triplet that sums to 9 is 2,3,4. The triplet 5,6,7 sums to 18. So, are there any others?Wait, let&#39;s check another way. Suppose the three digits sum to 9. The digits are at least 2, so minimum possible sum is 2+3+4=9. The next possible triplet would be 2,3,5=10, which is already over. So indeed, only 2,3,4 sums to 9. Therefore, the only way to split the digits is {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Because those are the only two triplets that sum to 9 and 18 respectively.Therefore, there is only one such partition: {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Thus, all possible ways are based on this partition.Now, for each group, the number of three-digit numbers that can be formed is the number of permutations of the three digits, considering that leading zeros are not allowed. However, since all digits are from 2,3,4,5,6,7, there are no zeros, so all permutations are valid three-digit numbers.Therefore, for the group {2,3,4}, the number of three-digit numbers is 3! = 6. Similarly, for {5,6,7}, it&#39;s also 6. Therefore, for each partition, the number of ways is 6 * 6 = 36.But wait, are the two three-digit numbers distinguishable? For example, if we have ABC and DEF, is that considered different from DEF and ABC? The problem says &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t specify if the order matters. If the order doesn&#39;t matter, then we would have to divide by 2. But if the order does matter, then it&#39;s 36.Looking back at the problem: &quot;How many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers...&quot; The wording doesn&#39;t specify order, but typically, unless stated otherwise, arrangements where order matters are counted. However, in some combinatorial problems, pairs are considered unordered. Hmm. Wait, but in this case, the two numbers are separate entities, so maybe order does matter. For example, 234 and 567 is different from 567 and 234. But maybe not? The problem says &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, but the numbers themselves are just two numbers; unless specified otherwise, the order might not matter. But in the context of counting, unless specified, we usually consider ordered pairs. Wait, but let&#39;s check.Suppose we have two numbers, A and B. If swapping A and B counts as a different way, then order matters. If not, then it&#39;s the same. Since the problem says &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, perhaps the act of gluing implies that the order might matter, depending on how the cards are arranged. But actually, the problem is about using the cards, so perhaps the two numbers are considered distinguishable based on their digits. Wait, but even if you swap the two numbers, it&#39;s a different arrangement of the cards? Hmm, maybe not. If you have two numbers, each made from three cards, then the total number of arrangements is the number of ways to divide the six cards into two groups of three, permute each group, and then the order of the two numbers might not matter. Wait, but in the problem statement, when it says &quot;how many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, it&#39;s possible that the order of the two numbers is considered part of the way. For example, first gluing one number and then the other. But in reality, since they are separate entities, unless specified otherwise, the order could matter.But this is ambiguous. Wait, in Russian problems, sometimes when you form pairs or groups, order is considered unless specified. But here, since we have two distinct numbers (assuming they are different), but in this case, {2,3,4} and {5,6,7} would produce numbers where one group is smaller (234) and the other is larger (567). If swapping them is considered different, then order matters. However, in this specific case, the two groups have distinct digits, so the two numbers will always be different. Therefore, ABC and DEF is different from DEF and ABC, so order might matter. However, the problem might consider them as just a set of two numbers, so order doesn&#39;t matter. Hmm.This is a crucial point because if order matters, the answer is 36, but if not, it&#39;s 18. So how do we resolve this?Looking back at the problem statement: &quot;How many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers (one card will not be used) so that each of them is divisible by 9?&quot; The phrase &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot; is somewhat ambiguous. In Russian, the wording might imply that the two numbers are being formed without considering the order. But given that in combinatorial problems, unless specified, arrangements are considered ordered. However, in this case, since the two numbers are made from different sets of digits, they are distinct numbers, so arranging them in different orders would produce different results. Therefore, the total number of ways is 6 * 6 = 36. But let&#39;s verify with an example. Suppose we have two numbers, 234 and 567. Is 567 and 234 considered a different way? If the problem counts the order in which the numbers are glued as important, then yes. But if it&#39;s just about the set of two numbers, then no. Since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, but in combinatorial problems involving forming groups where the groups are not labeled (i.e., not group A and group B), the order usually doesn&#39;t matter. Therefore, we might need to divide by 2. But wait, in this case, the numbers are different, so even if the order doesn&#39;t matter, the count would still be 6*6=36, because each permutation of the two groups is unique. Wait, no. If the two groups are considered as a pair, then the number of ordered pairs is 36, unordered pairs is 18. For example, if you have two numbers, the pair (234, 567) is the same as (567, 234) if order doesn&#39;t matter. Therefore, if the problem considers these as the same way, then it&#39;s 18; otherwise, 36.Since the problem is presented neutrally, it&#39;s safer to assume that order matters unless told otherwise. But in Russian math problems, usually, unless specified, the order of elements in a selection is considered. However, when forming two groups, sometimes the order isn&#39;t considered. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s see. Suppose we have two groups, and each group is used to form a number. Since the numbers themselves are different (one is made of smaller digits, the other of larger digits), maybe the problem counts them as different even if their order is swapped. But in reality, the two numbers are distinct, so even if you swap them, it&#39;s a different arrangement. Wait, but the problem is about the number of ways to glue the cards into two numbers. The process of gluing could involve arranging the cards in some order, but since we are just forming two numbers, the total number of ways would involve choosing which three cards go to the first number, arranging them, and then arranging the remaining three into the second number. So that would be C(6,3) * 3! * 3!. But in our case, there&#39;s only one way to split the cards into two groups, so it&#39;s 1 * 6 * 6 = 36. Therefore, in this context, the answer is 36.Alternatively, if the problem considers the two numbers as an unordered pair, then it&#39;s 36 / 2 = 18. But why would we divide by 2 here? Because splitting into group A and group B is the same as group B and group A. But since the numbers are different, I think the order matters.Wait, for instance, if the two numbers were the same, then order wouldn&#39;t matter. But in this case, they are different numbers. For example, 234 and 567 are different from 567 and 234. But if the problem counts the total number of pairs (sets) of numbers, then order doesn&#39;t matter, and we should divide by 2. However, in problems where you form two distinct entities (like two different groups), even if they are of the same size, if they are distinguishable by their content, then order might matter. Since the two numbers here are different (as their digits are different), the pair (234, 567) is different from (567, 234). However, in terms of the actual numbers, they are different. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify whether the order of gluing matters. If it&#39;s about how many distinct pairs of numbers exist, then order doesn&#39;t matter, but the count would still be the same because each unordered pair is counted once. Wait, but in our case, there&#39;s only one way to split the digits, so the pair {234,567} is the only possible unordered pair. However, each element of the pair can be arranged in 6 ways, so the total number of ordered pairs is 6*6=36, and the number of unordered pairs is 18. But the problem says &quot;how many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. The term &quot;ways&quot; can be interpreted as sequences, so if you glue one number first and then the other, then order matters. But if you just place them next to each other without considering order, then it doesn&#39;t. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify, so it&#39;s ambiguous.However, in the original problem statement in Russian, the wording might imply that the two numbers are considered as a set, so order doesn&#39;t matter. But since I don&#39;t have the original Russian wording, I have to go by the translation given. The translation says &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. If &quot;glue them&quot; implies that the order is irrelevant, then it&#39;s a set, and we should divide by 2. Otherwise, if it&#39;s an ordered pair, we don&#39;t. To check, let&#39;s think of a simpler case. Suppose you have digits 1,2,3,4 and need to form two two-digit numbers, how many ways? If order matters, it&#39;s C(4,2)*2! * C(2,2)*2! = 6*2*1*2=24. If order doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s 24/2=12. Which is correct? It depends on the problem&#39;s intention. In many cases, unless specified, it&#39;s considered that order matters. So maybe the answer is 36 here.But let&#39;s think again. The total number of ways to split the six cards into two groups of three, where each group&#39;s digits sum to 9 and 18, and then arrange each group into a number. Since there&#39;s only one way to split the digits (into {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}), the total number of ordered pairs (considering order) is 6 * 6 = 36. If order doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s 36 / 2 = 18. Which is correct?In combinatorial problems, when you form two groups without labeling them as first and second, the count is usually divided by 2. But in this case, when you form two numbers, even if you don&#39;t label them, the numbers themselves are distinct (since their digits are different), so swapping them results in a different outcome. Therefore, maybe order does matter. For example, the numbers 234 and 567 are different from 567 and 234. However, if the problem counts these as the same way since they consist of the same numbers, then order doesn&#39;t matter. But typically, unless specified, I think the answer would be 36. However, in some combinatorial contexts, forming two unlabeled groups would have the count divided by 2. Let me verify with a simple example.Suppose you have two digits, 1 and 2, and you need to split them into two one-digit numbers. How many ways? If order matters, it&#39;s 2 (1 and 2 vs 2 and 1). If order doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s 1. So in that case, the answer could vary. Since the problem says &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, it might depend on whether the two numbers are considered as a sequence or a set. In the absence of specific information, but given that the two numbers are different (they will have different digits, hence different values), the problem might want the answer as 36, considering different orderings as different ways.Alternatively, maybe not. Let&#39;s see. If we think about the physical act of gluing the cards, Lenya could arrange the first three cards into a number and the remaining three into another. The leftover card is discarded. In this case, the process involves choosing an order: which three cards to pick first. But since the split is fixed (only one possible split into two groups with sums 9 and 18), the number of ways would be the number of permutations of the first group times the number of permutations of the second group. Since the split is fixed as {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}, the number of ways is indeed 3! * 3! = 36. The order in which Lenya decides to glue the two numbers might not be considered, but since the two numbers are different, permuting them would create different outcomes. But if the problem counts the total number of distinct pairs of numbers, regardless of order, then it&#39;s 18. However, each number is formed by a permutation of the digits in their respective groups, so even if the pair is considered unordered, each permutation is unique. Wait, no. If the pair is unordered, then the total number is (number of ordered pairs)/2. For example, if you have numbers ABC and DEF, then ABC/DEF and DEF/ABC are considered the same pair. So if the problem counts unordered pairs, the answer is 18. If it counts ordered pairs, it&#39;s 36.Given that the problem is from a competition or Olympiad, it&#39;s likely expecting 36 as the answer, considering that each number is formed separately, and the order might matter. But I need to verify.Wait, let&#39;s consider the problem again: &quot;How many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers...&quot; The word &quot;glue&quot; might imply that once glued, the two numbers are considered as separate entities, but the order isn&#39;t specified. In many similar problems, when two numbers are formed, the order is considered unless stated otherwise. For example, in problems asking for the number of ways to arrange objects into groups, if the groups are unlabeled, you divide by the factorial of the number of groups. In this case, if the two numbers are considered unlabeled groups, then we divide by 2. If they are labeled (like first number and second number), we don&#39;t. Since the problem doesn&#39;t mention labels, it&#39;s safer to assume they are unlabeled, so we divide by 2. Therefore, the answer would be 36 / 2 = 18. However, this is a point of debate.Wait, but in our case, the two groups are uniquely determined by their digits. Since {2,3,4} can only form numbers like 234,243, etc., and {5,6,7} can form 567,576, etc., each permutation is unique. But if the problem counts different orderings of the same two numbers as distinct, then it&#39;s 36. If it counts them as the same, then it&#39;s 18.Given that in the problem statement there is no indication of order, but in combinatorial mathematics, unless specified otherwise, arrangements where order matters are counted. For example, forming two numbers where the first is ABC and the second DEF is different from DEF and ABC. Therefore, the total number is 36.Wait, but let&#39;s think of another angle. Suppose Lenya is gluing the cards into two numbers without considering which is first or second. Then, the pair {ABC, DEF} is the same as {DEF, ABC}. In that case, the answer is 18. But how do we know?The problem says &quot;how many ways to glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;. The term &quot;ways&quot; can be interpreted as the number of distinct outcomes. If the outcomes are considered different when the numbers are swapped, then it&#39;s 36. If not, 18. Since the numbers themselves are different (one group has digits 2,3,4 and the other 5,6,7), swapping them would result in a different set of numbers. Wait, but sets are unordered. So the set {234, 567} is the same as {567, 234}. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the number of sets, it&#39;s 18. If it&#39;s asking for ordered pairs, it&#39;s 36.Given that in mathematical problems, unless specified, &quot;how many ways&quot; usually refers to the number of ordered arrangements. However, when forming sets or groups without order, it&#39;s different. Since the problem says &quot;two three-digit numbers&quot;, which is a plural noun, it&#39;s ambiguous. But in Russian, the wording might be more precise. Assuming the translation is accurate, and it&#39;s neutral, we might need to state both possibilities. However, given that the answer is likely expecting 36, given that permutations of digits are considered different numbers, and the two numbers are separate entities, the answer is 36. But I need to be careful.Wait, let&#39;s do a sanity check. If we have two groups, each with 3 digits, and each group can be arranged in 6 ways. If the two groups are fixed, then the total number of ordered pairs is 6*6=36. If the groups are considered unordered, it&#39;s 18. But in this problem, the split into groups is fixed (only one way: {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}), so all the ways come from permuting each group. If the problem considers the order of the two numbers as important, then 36. If not, 18.Given that the numbers are different (since they consist of different digits), the problem might consider different orderings as different ways. But actually, in reality, the numbers 234 and 567 are different from 567 and 234, but as a combination, they form the same pair. However, in terms of the actual gluing process, if Lenya first glues 234 and then 567, vs first 567 then 234, these could be different physical actions, hence different ways. But since the problem is mathematical, not considering the physical process, it&#39;s about the mathematical count of possible outcomes. In mathematics, unless specified, pairs are ordered. But sets are unordered. The problem says &quot;two three-digit numbers&quot;, which is a set, so unordered. Therefore, the answer should be 18.But I need to check with the rules of combinatorics. When you form two groups and the order of the groups doesn&#39;t matter, the formula is C(n, k) / 2 if the groups are of the same size and unlabeled. But in this case, the groups are of the same size but different in composition. However, since there&#39;s only one way to split the digits into two groups with the required sums, the groups are uniquely determined. Therefore, regardless of order, the number of sets is 1, but the number of ordered pairs is 2. But in our case, each group can be permuted into different numbers. So actually, the total number of ordered pairs is 6*6=36, and the number of unordered pairs is 18. Therefore, if the problem considers ordered pairs, it&#39;s 36; else, 18.Given that in Olympiad problems, unless stated otherwise, if you form two numbers, the order usually matters. For example, in problems where you choose a committee and a subcommittee, order doesn&#39;t matter. But if you form two different numbers, the order might matter. However, since the two numbers here are just required to exist, the problem might just want the total number of possible pairs, ordered or unordered. But I think the answer expected here is 36, considering all permutations. Because when you &quot;glue them into two three-digit numbers&quot;, each permutation of the digits in each number is a different way of gluing. Therefore, the total number is 3! * 3! = 36.But let&#39;s think again: the problem states that one card is not used. So the process is: choose which card to exclude, then partition the remaining six into two three-digit numbers. But we already established that the only excluded card is 1. Then, the remaining six cards must be split into two groups of three, each summing to 9 and 18. But we found that only one split is possible: {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Therefore, regardless of how you arrange them, the number of ways is the number of permutations of each group.So the total number of ways is the number of ways to arrange the first group (2,3,4) into a number (6 ways) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the second group (5,6,7) into another number (6 ways). So 6*6=36.Therefore, the answer is 36. However, some might argue that since the two numbers are indistinct in the problem statement (i.e., the problem doesn&#39;t say &quot;first number&quot; and &quot;second number&quot;), the order doesn&#39;t matter. But in standard combinatorics, arranging objects into sequences (numbers) where order matters, even if the problem doesn&#39;t specify first or second. For example, the number of two-letter words from {a,b} is 2*2=4, not 4/2=2. Similarly, here, the two numbers are sequences where order matters because they are separate entities. Therefore, the answer is 36.But to confirm, let&#39;s check an example. Suppose you have digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and you need to form two three-digit numbers with one digit excluded, each number divisible by 9. We found that only excluding 1 works. Then, the two groups are {2,3,4} and {5,6,7}. Each group can be arranged in 6 ways. So the total number of ordered pairs is 6*6=36. If you consider unordered pairs, it&#39;s 18. But since numbers are ordered entities by themselves (i.e., 234 is different from 324), the total number of ordered pairs is 36. Therefore, I think the answer is 36.However, let&#39;s recall that sometimes in problems where two groups are formed and each group is arranged, the total number is calculated as (number of ways to choose and arrange first group) * (number of ways to arrange the second group). Since the split is fixed here, it&#39;s just 3! * 3! =36.Therefore, I think the answer is 36, so boxed{36}.Final Answerboxed{36}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of ways to glue the digits 1 to 7 into two three-digit numbers (with one card unused) such that each number is divisible by 9, we start by noting that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The sum of all digits from 1 to 7 is 28. For two numbers to be divisible by 9, the sum of the six digits used must be divisible by 9. Since 28 ≡ 1 mod 9, the excluded digit must be 1 (as 28 - 1 = 27, which is divisible by 9).Next, we need to split the remaining digits {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} into two groups of three digits each, such that each group&#39;s sum is divisible by 9. The total sum of these digits is 27, so one group must sum to 9 and the other to 18. The only possible split is {2, 3, 4} (sum = 9) and {5, 6, 7} (sum = 18).For each group, we calculate the number of valid three-digit permutations. Each group can be arranged in 3! ways, leading to 6 permutations for each group. Since the order of the two numbers matters (as different permutations result in different numbers), the total number of ways is 6 * 6 = 36.Thus, the final answer is (boxed{36}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b69fb8c6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b69fb8c6><span class="icon" data-v-b69fb8c6>🔑:</span>Answer: 36.Solution. The sum of the digits in each number is divisible by 9, which means the overall sum of the used digits is also divisible by 9. The sum of all given digits 1+2+ldots+7 is 28. If we remove the digit 1, the remaining sum is 27, which is divisible by 9; removing any other digit cannot result in a sum divisible by 9. Therefore, the digits used are 2,3,4,5,6,7.Notice that the smallest possible sum of three of these digits is 2+3+4=9, and the largest is 5+6+7=18. No other sums divisible by 9 can be obtained; 9 and 18 can only be obtained in one way. Thus, one number consists of the digits 2,3,4, and the other consists of 5,6,7.There are six numbers that can be formed from the digits 2,3,4, and six numbers that can be formed from the digits 5,6,7. We need all possible pairs of these numbers.## CriteriaA complete solution to the problem is worth 7 points. In the absence of such a solution, the following criteria are summed:2 p.

First, problem (1): finding the length of the chord intercepted by circle O on line l₁. The circle O is given by x² + y² = 4, which is a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with radius 2. The line l₁ is 3x + 4y - 5 = 0. To find the length of the chord, I remember that the formula for the length of a chord intercepted by a line on a circle is 2√(r² - d²), where r is the radius of the circle and d is the distance from the center of the circle to the line. So first, I need to calculate the distance from the center (0,0) to the line l₁. The formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax₀ + By₀ + C| / √(A² + B²). Applying that here, the distance d is |3*0 + 4*0 -5| / √(3² + 4²) = | -5 | / 5 = 5/5 = 1. So the distance d is 1. The radius r of the circle is 2, so the length of the chord is 2√(2² - 1²) = 2√(4 - 1) = 2√3. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is 2√3. Let me double-check that. The radius is 2, the distance from center to line is 1, so yes, the chord length formula gives 2√(r² - d²) = 2√3. That seems right.Now moving on to part (2). This seems more complex. Let me parse the problem again.We have line l₂ passing through (-1, 2) and is perpendicular to l₁. Then, l₂ is tangent to circle M, whose center lies on the line x - 2y = 0. Additionally, circle M is divided into two arcs by line l₁ with the arc length ratio of 2:1. We need to find the equation of circle M.First, let&#39;s break down the requirements:1. Line l₂ is perpendicular to l₁ and passes through (-1, 2). So, we need to find the equation of l₂ first.2. Circle M is tangent to l₂, and its center is on x - 2y = 0.3. Line l₁ divides circle M into two arcs with a ratio of 2:1. This ratio implies that the central angle subtended by these arcs is 240° and 120°, since 2:1 corresponds to 2 parts and 1 part, totaling 3 parts, which is 360°, so each part is 120°. Therefore, the central angles would be 240° and 120°. Since arc length is proportional to the central angle, the ratio 2:1 would correspond to 240°:120°.But for a line to divide a circle into arcs with central angles in a 2:1 ratio, the line must be such that the angle between the line and the line connecting the center of the circle to the points of intersection is either 60° or 120°. Wait, actually, if the central angles are 240° and 120°, the line l₁ must be cutting the circle such that the angle at the center is 120°, because the larger arc is 240°, so the angle would be 120° (since the smaller arc corresponds to the smaller angle). Hmm, maybe. Let me think.Alternatively, if the ratio of the arc lengths is 2:1, the measure of the arcs would be 240° and 120°. Therefore, the central angle between the two intersection points of line l₁ with circle M is 120°, because the arc lengths are proportional to the central angles. Therefore, the line l₁ cuts the circle M such that the central angle is 120°. Therefore, the distance from the center of circle M to line l₁ must be equal to the radius times cos(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Wait, let me recall the formula for the distance from the center to the chord in terms of the central angle.Yes, if θ is the central angle corresponding to a chord, then the distance d from the center to the chord is given by d = r cos(θ/2). Wait, or is it d = r cos(θ/2)? Wait, let me recall:In a circle, the distance from the center to the chord is d = r cos(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Wait, no, perhaps that&#39;s not accurate. Let me think. Let&#39;s imagine a circle with radius r, a chord subtending an angle θ at the center. Then, if you draw the perpendicular from the center to the chord, it divides the chord into two equal parts. The length of the chord is 2r sin(θ/2), and the distance from the center to the chord is d = r cos(θ/2). Yes, that&#39;s correct.So, chord length = 2r sin(θ/2), and distance d = r cos(θ/2). So here, the central angle is 120°, so θ = 120°, so θ/2 = 60°, so d = r cos(60°) = r*(1/2). Therefore, the distance from the center of circle M to line l₁ is equal to r/2. Alternatively, if the arcs are in the ratio 2:1, then the central angles are 240° and 120°, so the chord would correspond to the smaller angle, 120°, so the distance from the center to the line l₁ is r cos(60°) = r/2. Therefore, the distance from center M to line l₁ is r/2.Therefore, for circle M, if we let the center be (h, k) lying on the line x - 2y = 0, so h - 2k = 0, so h = 2k. Then, the distance from (h, k) to line l₁ (3x + 4y -5 =0) must be equal to r/2. Also, circle M is tangent to line l₂. The radius of circle M is equal to the distance from (h, k) to line l₂. So, we have two equations: distance from (h, k) to l₁ is r/2, and distance from (h, k) to l₂ is r. Additionally, since the center is (h, k) = (2k, k). Let me formalize this.First, let&#39;s find the equation of line l₂. Since l₂ is perpendicular to l₁, which has slope -3/4 (since l₁ is 3x +4y -5 =0, so slope is -A/B = -3/4). Therefore, the slope of l₂, being perpendicular, is 4/3. Since l₂ passes through (-1, 2), its equation is y - 2 = (4/3)(x +1). Let me write that in standard form. Multiply both sides by 3: 3(y - 2) = 4(x +1) =&gt; 3y -6 = 4x +4 =&gt; -4x +3y -10 =0 =&gt; 4x -3y +10 =0. Wait, let&#39;s check:Starting with point-slope form: y - 2 = (4/3)(x +1). Then, multiplying both sides by 3: 3y -6 = 4x +4. Then, rearranged: -4x +3y -10 =0, or 4x -3y +10 =0. Wait, but when moving all terms to left-hand side: 4x -3y +10 =0? Wait, let&#39;s check:Original equation after multiplying: 3y -6 =4x +4. Bring all terms to left: -4x +3y -6 -4 =0 =&gt; -4x +3y -10 =0. So, standard form is 4x -3y +10 =0, but actually, standard form is usually written as Ax + By + C =0, so to make the coefficient of x positive, we can write 4x -3y +10 =0. So, line l₂ is 4x -3y +10 =0.So, the equation of l₂ is 4x -3y +10 =0.Now, circle M has center (h, k) on x -2y =0, so h =2k. Therefore, center is (2k, k). The radius r is equal to the distance from (2k, k) to line l₂ (4x -3y +10 =0). The distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to line Ax + By + C =0 is |Ax₀ + By₀ + C| /√(A² + B²). So, radius r = |4*(2k) -3*k +10| /√(16 +9) = |8k -3k +10| /5 = |5k +10| /5 = |k +2|.Therefore, r = |k +2|. Since radius is a non-negative quantity, we can write r = |k +2|. However, depending on the direction of the tangent, we might need to consider the absolute value. But perhaps since we can consider k as a variable, we can proceed.Additionally, the distance from center (2k, k) to line l₁ (3x +4y -5 =0) must be equal to r/2. Let&#39;s compute this distance:Distance = |3*(2k) +4*k -5| /√(9 +16) = |6k +4k -5| /5 = |10k -5| /5 = |2k -1|.According to the problem, this distance must equal r/2. But r = |k +2|. Therefore:|2k -1| = |k +2| /2So, this gives an equation involving absolute values. Let&#39;s solve this equation.First, let me write |2k -1| = (1/2)|k +2|To solve this, we can square both sides to eliminate the absolute values:(2k -1)^2 = (1/4)(k +2)^2Multiply both sides by 4:4(2k -1)^2 = (k +2)^2Expand both sides:4*(4k² -4k +1) = k² +4k +4Left side: 16k² -16k +4Right side: k² +4k +4Bring all terms to left side:16k² -16k +4 -k² -4k -4 =0Simplify:15k² -20k =0Factor:5k(3k -4) =0Therefore, solutions are k=0 or 3k -4=0 =&gt; k=4/3.Therefore, possible k values are k=0 and k=4/3.Now, let&#39;s check each case.Case 1: k=0.Then center is (2k, k) = (0,0). Radius r = |k +2| = |0 +2| =2. But circle M with center (0,0) and radius 2 is the same as circle O. However, line l₁ is 3x +4y -5=0, which we already considered in part (1). The distance from (0,0) to l₁ is 1, which in this case would mean that the central angle for the chord would be 2*arcsin(d/r) = 2*arcsin(1/2) = 2*30°=60°, which would result in arcs of 60° and 300°, which does not give the ratio 2:1. Therefore, this case is invalid. So, k=0 is not a valid solution.Case 2: k=4/3.Then center is (2*(4/3), 4/3) = (8/3, 4/3). Radius r = |4/3 +2| = |10/3| =10/3.Now, check if this satisfies the arc length ratio. Let&#39;s compute the distance from center (8/3, 4/3) to line l₁ (3x +4y -5 =0):Distance = |3*(8/3) +4*(4/3) -5| /5 = |8 +16/3 -5| /5 = |(24/3 +16/3 -15/3)| /5 = |25/3| /5 =25/(3*5)=5/3.But according to our previous equation, the distance should be r/2 = (10/3)/2 =5/3. So, that checks out.Therefore, this center (8/3,4/3) with radius 10/3 is a valid solution.But wait, we need to also check if line l₂ is tangent to circle M. Since the radius of circle M is equal to the distance from center to line l₂. Let&#39;s verify that.Radius r =10/3. The distance from center (8/3,4/3) to line l₂ (4x -3y +10=0):Distance = |4*(8/3) -3*(4/3) +10| /5 = |32/3 -12/3 +10| /5 = |20/3 +10| /5 = |20/3 +30/3| /5 = |50/3| /5 =50/(3*5)=10/3. Which is equal to the radius. Therefore, the line l₂ is indeed tangent to circle M. So, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the equation of circle M is (x -8/3)² + (y -4/3)² = (10/3)² =100/9.But let me check if there could be another solution. Because when we squared both sides of the equation |2k -1| = |k +2| /2, we might have introduced extraneous solutions, but we checked both k=0 and k=4/3 and only k=4/3 worked. The k=0 led to circle O, which doesn&#39;t satisfy the arc ratio condition, so it&#39;s invalid. Therefore, only k=4/3 is valid.Hence, the equation of circle M is (x -8/3)^2 + (y -4/3)^2 =100/9.Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator to write it without fractions:Multiply both sides by 9:9(x -8/3)^2 +9(y -4/3)^2 =100Expanding the squares:9*(x² -16/3 x +64/9) +9*(y² -8/3 y +16/9)=100Which becomes:9x² -48x +64 +9y² -24y +16=100Combine like terms:9x² +9y² -48x -24y +80=100Then subtract 100:9x² +9y² -48x -24y -20=0But perhaps the original form is better. Alternatively, we can write the equation as:(x -8/3)² + (y -4/3)² = (10/3)²Which is acceptable.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is the equation of circle M as above.Wait, let me confirm once more. The center is (8/3,4/3), radius 10/3. The distance from center to l₁ is 5/3, which is r/2, so the central angle is 120°, leading to arc lengths ratio 2:1. Since the chord corresponding to 120° divides the circle into arcs of 120° and 240°, which have a ratio 2:1. Therefore, this is correct.Additionally, the line l₂ is tangent to circle M, which we confirmed by checking the distance from the center to l₂ equals the radius. Therefore, everything seems consistent.Therefore, the final answers are:(1) The length of the chord is 2√3.(2) The equation of circle M is (x - 8/3)² + (y - 4/3)² = (10/3)², which can be written as (x - 8/3)² + (y - 4/3)² = 100/9.Final Answer(1) The length of the chord is boxed{2sqrt{3}}.(2) The equation of circle ( M ) is boxed{left(x - dfrac{8}{3}right)^2 + left(y - dfrac{4}{3}right)^2 = dfrac{100}{9}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the line ( l_1: 3x + 4y - 5 = 0 ) and the circle ( O: x^2 + y^2 = 4 ):(1) To find the length of the chord intercepted by circle ( O ) on line ( l_1 ):- The radius ( r ) of the circle is 2.- The distance ( d ) from the center (0,0) to the line ( l_1 ) is calculated as:  [  d = frac{|3 cdot 0 + 4 cdot 0 - 5|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = frac{5}{5} = 1  ]- The length of the chord is:  [  2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} = 2sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = 2sqrt{3}  ]  Therefore, the length of the chord is (boxed{2sqrt{3}}).(2) To find the equation of circle ( M ):- The line ( l_2 ) passing through ((-1, 2)) and perpendicular to ( l_1 ) has a slope of (frac{4}{3}). Its equation is:  [  y - 2 = frac{4}{3}(x + 1) implies 4x - 3y + 10 = 0  ]- The center of circle ( M ) lies on the line ( x - 2y = 0 ), so the center is ((2k, k)).- The radius ( r ) of circle ( M ) is the distance from ((2k, k)) to ( l_2 ):  [  r = frac{|4(2k) - 3k + 10|}{sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}} = frac{|5k + 10|}{5} = |k + 2|  ]- The distance from ((2k, k)) to ( l_1 ) is:  [  frac{|3(2k) + 4k - 5|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = frac{|10k - 5|}{5} = |2k - 1|  ]- This distance must be ( frac{r}{2} ):  [  |2k - 1| = frac{|k + 2|}{2}  ]  Solving this equation, we find ( k = frac{4}{3} ).- The center of circle ( M ) is (left(frac{8}{3}, frac{4}{3}right)) and the radius is (frac{10}{3}).- The equation of circle ( M ) is:  [  left(x - frac{8}{3}right)^2 + left(y - frac{4}{3}right)^2 = left(frac{10}{3}right)^2  ]  Therefore, the equation of circle ( M ) is (boxed{left(x - dfrac{8}{3}right)^2 + left(y - dfrac{4}{3}right)^2 = dfrac{100}{9}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here with two parts. Let&#39;s tackle them one by one. Starting with part (1): Find the length of the chord intercepted by circle O on line l₁, where l₁ is 3x + 4y - 5 = 0 and circle O is x² + y² = 4. First, I remember that the length of a chord intercepted by a line on a circle can be found using the formula: 2√(r² - d²), where r is the radius of the circle and d is the distance from the center of the circle to the line. Circle O is x² + y² = 4, so its center is at (0, 0) and radius r = 2. Now, I need to find the distance d from the center (0,0) to the line l₁: 3x + 4y - 5 = 0. The formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax₀ + By₀ + C| / √(A² + B²). Plugging in the values, we get |3*0 + 4*0 -5| / √(3² + 4²) = |-5| / 5 = 5/5 = 1. So d = 1. Then the chord length is 2√(r² - d²) = 2√(4 - 1) = 2√3. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. The formula is correct, the distance calculation is correct. The radius is 2, yes. So 2√(4 -1) is indeed 2√3. Okay, part (1) done. Now part (2) is more complicated. Let me parse the problem again. We have line l₂ passing through the point (-1, 2) and is perpendicular to l₁. Then, l₂ is tangent to circle M, whose center lies on the line x - 2y = 0. Moreover, circle M is divided into two arcs by line l₁ with the arc length ratio of 2:1. We need to find the equation of circle M. Let me break this down step by step. First, find the equation of line l₂. Since l₂ is perpendicular to l₁ and passes through (-1, 2). The slope of l₁: 3x + 4y -5 = 0 can be found by rearranging to y = (-3/4)x + 5/4. So slope m₁ = -3/4. Therefore, the slope of l₂, being perpendicular, is the negative reciprocal: m₂ = 4/3. Thus, the equation of l₂ is y - 2 = (4/3)(x + 1). Let me write that out. Multiply both sides by 3: 3(y - 2) = 4(x + 1) → 3y - 6 = 4x + 4 → 4x - 3y + 10 = 0. Wait, let&#39;s check:Starting from point-slope: y = (4/3)x + (4/3)(-1) + 2? Wait, no. Wait, original point is (-1, 2). So slope is 4/3. So equation is y = (4/3)(x + 1) + 2. Let&#39;s compute that. y = (4/3)x + 4/3 + 2 = (4/3)x + 10/3. So in standard form: multiply both sides by 3: 3y = 4x + 10 → 4x - 3y + 10 = 0. So that&#39;s correct. So l₂ is 4x - 3y + 10 = 0. Now, circle M has its center on the line x - 2y = 0. Let me denote the center as (h, k). Then h - 2k = 0 → h = 2k. So center is (2k, k). Circle M is tangent to line l₂: 4x - 3y + 10 = 0. The distance from the center (2k, k) to line l₂ must be equal to the radius of circle M. Also, circle M is divided into two arcs by line l₁ with arc length ratio 2:1. The arc length ratio relates to the central angle subtended by the chord. Since arc length is proportional to the central angle, a ratio of 2:1 implies central angles of 240° and 120°, because 240:120 = 2:1, and 240 + 120 = 360°. Therefore, line l₁ intersects circle M such that the central angle between the two intersection points is 120° or 240°, depending on which arc we consider. However, since the problem states that the arc length ratio is 2:1, the larger arc is 240°, and the smaller is 120°. But how does this relate to the distance from the center to the line l₁? The central angle θ corresponding to an arc can be related to the distance d from the center to the chord (which is line l₁ here) by the formula: cos(θ/2) = d / rWhere r is the radius of circle M, and d is the distance from the center to the line l₁. Wait, let me recall the relation. If a chord subtends an angle θ at the center, then the distance from the center to the chord is d = r cos(θ/2). Wait, let me verify. Consider a circle with radius r. A chord at distance d from the center subtends an angle θ. Then, the length of the chord is 2√(r² - d²). But also, the chord length can be expressed as 2r sin(θ/2). Equate the two: 2r sin(θ/2) = 2√(r² - d²) → sin(θ/2) = √(1 - (d²/r²)) → sin²(θ/2) = 1 - d²/r² → d² = r² cos²(θ/2). Therefore, d = r cos(θ/2). Therefore, cos(θ/2) = d / r. In our case, the central angle is either 120° or 240°. However, since the ratio is 2:1, the arcs are 240° and 120°, so the central angles are 240° and 120°. But since the line l₁ cuts the circle into two arcs, the central angle depends on which side of the line the center is. Wait, but the central angle would be the angle between the two points where the line l₁ intersects the circle. If the arc length ratio is 2:1, then the central angles must be 240° and 120°. Therefore, the distance d from the center to line l₁ must satisfy d = r cos(θ/2). But θ can be either 120° or 240°, depending on which arc is considered. Wait, let me think. If the center is close to the line l₁, the chord would subtend a larger angle. Wait, actually, when the distance d is smaller, the chord is closer to the center, so the central angle is larger. So if the central angle is 120°, then θ = 120°, so d = r cos(60°) = r * 0.5. If the central angle is 240°, then θ = 240°, so d = r cos(120°) = r * (-0.5). But distance can&#39;t be negative, so maybe take absolute value. Wait, but cos(120°) is -0.5, so the absolute value would be 0.5r. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I need to revisit the formula. Wait, earlier derivation: d = r cos(θ/2). So if θ is 120°, then θ/2 = 60°, so d = r cos(60°) = 0.5r. If θ is 240°, θ/2 = 120°, so d = r cos(120°) = -0.5r. But distance is always positive, so maybe the formula should be d = |r cos(θ/2)|. But in reality, the distance from the center to the chord is a positive quantity. Therefore, θ must be such that cos(θ/2) is positive, so θ/2 must be acute, meaning θ must be less than 180°. However, in our case, the central angles are 120° and 240°, but the chord divides the circle into two arcs. The central angle corresponding to the smaller arc is 120°, and the larger arc is 240°, but the angle θ in the formula refers to the angle subtended by the chord at the center, which can be either the smaller or the larger angle. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s confusion here. Let&#39;s clarify: The chord created by line l₁ on circle M will have two arcs. The central angle for the minor arc is 120°, and the major arc is 240°, since their ratio is 2:1. Therefore, the central angle θ corresponding to the chord is 120°, and the distance d from the center to line l₁ is r cos(θ/2) = r cos(60°) = 0.5r. Alternatively, if θ is 240°, then θ/2 is 120°, so cos(120°) is -0.5, but since distance can&#39;t be negative, perhaps the formula is actually d = r |cos(θ/2)|. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, let&#39;s recall that the chord length is 2r sin(θ/2). Since chord length is positive, and sin(θ/2) is positive for θ between 0 and 180°, but if θ is 240°, sin(120°) is still positive. So maybe the chord length is the same whether θ is 120° or 240°, since sin(60°) = sin(120°) = √3/2. Wait, no. Wait, if θ is 120°, chord length is 2r sin(60°) = 2r*(√3/2) = r√3. If θ is 240°, chord length is 2r sin(120°) = same thing. So chord length is the same regardless of which arc we take. But the distance from center to chord is different. Wait, according to the formula, d = r cos(θ/2). If θ is 120°, then d = r cos(60°) = 0.5r. If θ is 240°, then d = r cos(120°) = -0.5r. But since distance can&#39;t be negative, perhaps it&#39;s absolute value. So |d| = |r cos(θ/2)|. So if the central angle is 240°, the distance is |r cos(120°)| = 0.5r. Wait, same as when θ is 120°, the distance is 0.5r. Wait, that can&#39;t be right. How can two different central angles give the same distance? Maybe I messed up the formula. Wait, let&#39;s rederive. Let me imagine a circle with center C, radius r. A chord AB is at distance d from C. The central angle θ is the angle ACB. Then, in triangle ACB, which is an isosceles triangle with sides AC = BC = r, and AB as the base. The distance d is the height from C to AB. In this triangle, the height splits the triangle into two right triangles, each with hypotenuse r, one leg d, and the other leg (AB/2). So, by Pythagoras: (AB/2)^2 + d^2 = r^2. Also, the central angle θ can be related to AB. The length AB is 2r sin(θ/2), as before. But also, from the right triangle, AB/2 = √(r² - d²). So AB = 2√(r² - d²). Therefore, combining both expressions for AB:2√(r² - d²) = 2r sin(θ/2) ⇒ √(r² - d²) = r sin(θ/2) ⇒ r² - d² = r² sin²(θ/2) ⇒ d² = r² (1 - sin²(θ/2)) = r² cos²(θ/2) ⇒ d = r cos(θ/2). So yes, the formula is d = r cos(θ/2). However, since θ is the central angle, which can be either the acute or obtuse angle between the two radii. But in reality, the chord defines two arcs: the minor arc (smaller central angle) and the major arc (larger central angle). But in our problem, the arc length ratio is 2:1. That means the central angles are in the ratio 2:1. Since the total circumference is 360°, the angles must be 240° and 120°. But here&#39;s the confusion: if the line l₁ cuts the circle into two arcs with ratio 2:1, then the central angles must be 240° and 120°. Therefore, the central angle θ corresponding to the chord (the angle between the two intersection points) is 120°, as the minor arc is 120°, and the major arc is 240°. Therefore, using θ = 120°, we have d = r cos(60°) = 0.5r. Alternatively, if we took θ = 240°, then d = r cos(120°) = -0.5r, but distance can&#39;t be negative. Therefore, the correct central angle to consider is 120°, giving d = 0.5r. Therefore, the distance from the center of circle M to line l₁ is 0.5r. But wait, in our case, the circle M is such that line l₁ divides it into two arcs with ratio 2:1. So, either the central angle is 120° or 240°, but as the ratio is 2:1, the larger arc is twice the smaller. So the central angles must be 240° and 120°. However, the formula d = r cos(θ/2) gives different results. Let me check with θ = 120°: θ/2 = 60°, so d = r cos(60°) = 0.5r. If θ = 240°, θ/2 = 120°, so d = r cos(120°) = -0.5r. But distance is absolute, so maybe we take absolute value, giving d = 0.5r in both cases? Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, maybe we need to consider that the angle θ is the smaller central angle between the two points, so θ = 120°, hence d = 0.5r. Then the distance from center to line l₁ is 0.5r. Alternatively, if the center is on the opposite side of the line l₁, but the distance is still positive. So regardless of which arc is considered, the distance is 0.5r. But this seems conflicting. Let me think with numbers. Suppose r = 2. If θ = 120°, then d = 2 * cos(60°) = 1. If θ = 240°, d = 2 * cos(120°) = 2*(-0.5) = -1, but distance is 1. So actually, the distance is |r cos(θ/2)|. Therefore, regardless of θ, the distance is |r cos(θ/2)|. Therefore, in our problem, since the ratio is 2:1, the central angles are 240° and 120°, so θ = 120°, because that&#39;s the smaller angle, and the distance is |r cos(60°)| = 0.5r. Alternatively, maybe both angles would give the same distance because cos(60°) = |cos(120°)|. Yes, cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(120°) = -0.5, so absolute value is 0.5. So the distance is 0.5r regardless. Therefore, regardless of which arc is considered, the distance from the center to line l₁ is 0.5r. Therefore, we can write that the distance from center (2k, k) to line l₁: 3x + 4y -5 = 0 is equal to 0.5r. Additionally, since circle M is tangent to line l₂: 4x - 3y + 10 = 0, the distance from center (2k, k) to line l₂ is equal to the radius r. Therefore, we have two equations:1) |3*(2k) + 4*(k) -5| / √(3² + 4²) = 0.5r2) |4*(2k) -3*(k) +10| / √(4² + (-3)²) = rLet&#39;s compute these. First, equation 1:Numerator: |6k + 4k -5| = |10k -5|Denominator: 5So |10k -5| /5 = 0.5r → |10k -5| = 2.5rEquation 2:Numerator: |8k - 3k +10| = |5k +10|Denominator: 5So |5k +10| /5 = r → |5k +10| =5r → |k + 2| = rSo from equation 2, r = |k + 2|Plugging into equation 1:|10k -5| = 2.5 * |k + 2|Let me write this as |10k -5| = (5/2)|k + 2|Multiply both sides by 2: |20k -10| = 5|k + 2|Divide both sides by 5: |4k -2| = |k + 2|So, |4k -2| = |k + 2|This equation can be split into cases based on the absolute values.Case 1: 4k -2 = k + 2Then, 4k -2 = k +2 → 3k =4 → k=4/3Case 2: 4k -2 = -(k +2)Then, 4k -2 = -k -2 → 5k =0 →k=0So possible solutions k=4/3 or k=0.Now, let&#39;s check these solutions.First, k=4/3:From equation 2, r = |k +2| = |4/3 + 2| = |10/3| =10/3Center of circle M is (2k, k) = (8/3, 4/3)Check if the distance from center to l₁ is 0.5r:Compute |10k -5| /5 = |10*(4/3) -5| /5 = |40/3 -15/3| /5 = |25/3| /5 =25/15 =5/30.5r = 0.5*(10/3) =5/3. So it matches.Similarly, check tangent condition: distance from center to l₂ is r.Compute |5k +10| /5 = |5*(4/3) +10| /5 = |20/3 +30/3| /5 = |50/3| /5 =50/15 =10/3 =r. So yes, matches.Now check k=0:From equation 2, r = |0 +2| =2Center of circle M is (0,0). Wait, but circle O is already at (0,0) with radius 2. But circle M is supposed to be tangent to l₂ and intersected by l₁ with arc ratio 2:1. If center is (0,0), then check distance to l₁: |0 +0 -5| /5 =1, which is supposed to be 0.5r=1. Since r=2, 0.5*2=1. So that works. But circle M would be x² + y² =4, same as circle O. But circle O is given as x² + y² =4. However, line l₂ is 4x -3y +10=0. The distance from (0,0) to l₂ is |0 +0 +10| /5=10/5=2, which is equal to the radius of circle M (which would be 2). So circle M would be tangent to l₂. But circle M is supposed to be another circle, but in this case, it&#39;s the same as circle O. However, circle O is divided by l₁ into two arcs. Let&#39;s check the arc length ratio. The line l₁:3x +4y -5=0 intersects circle O at points forming a chord. Earlier, in part (1), we found the chord length is 2√3. The central angle θ can be found using chord length =2r sin(θ/2). So 2√3 =2*2 sin(θ/2) → √3=2 sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2)=√3/2 → θ/2=60° →θ=120°. So the arc lengths would be 120° and 240°, ratio 1:2. But the problem states that circle M is divided into two arcs by l₁ with arc length ratio 2:1. Wait, in this case, for circle O, the ratio is 1:2. But the problem says the ratio is 2:1. Therefore, circle M cannot be circle O, so k=0 is invalid. Therefore, only k=4/3 is a valid solution. Therefore, circle M has center (8/3, 4/3) and radius 10/3. Thus, the equation is (x -8/3)² + (y -4/3)² = (10/3)² =100/9. Multiply through by 9 to eliminate denominators: 9(x² -16/3 x +64/9) +9(y² -8/3 y +16/9) =100 →9x² -48x +64 +9y² -24y +16 =100 →9x² +9y² -48x -24y +80=100→9x² +9y² -48x -24y -20=0. But maybe we can present it in standard form without expanding. So, equation is (x -8/3)² + (y -4/3)² =100/9. Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator to write as (3x -8)² + (3y -4)² =100. But let me check:(3x -8)^2 =9x² -48x +64, (3y -4)^2 =9y² -24y +16. Sum is 9x² +9y² -48x -24y +80. Equals 100, so 9x² +9y² -48x -24y -20=0. Which is the same as above. But perhaps the original standard form is better. Alternatively, to write it neatly:(x - 8/3)² + (y - 4/3)² = (10/3)²But since the problem says &quot;find the equation of circle M&quot;, either form is acceptable. However, perhaps they prefer fractions with denominator 3. Alternatively, expand the equation:x² -16/3 x +64/9 + y² -8/3 y +16/9 =100/9Combine terms:x² + y² -16/3 x -8/3 y +80/9 =100/9Subtract 100/9:x² + y² -16/3 x -8/3 y -20/9 =0Multiply all terms by 9 to eliminate denominators:9x² +9y² -48x -24y -20=0But this seems messy. Alternatively, leave it in the standard form with fractions. Alternatively, write the center as (8/3, 4/3) and radius 10/3. So the equation is (x -8/3)² + (y -4/3)² =100/9. Probably best to present it in the standard form with fractions. So, final answer for part (2) is (x -8/3)² + (y -4/3)² =100/9. Let me check once more. Center is (8/3,4/3). Distance to l₂: 4*(8/3) -3*(4/3) +10=32/3 -12/3 +10=20/3 +10=50/3. Divided by 5 (sqrt(16 +9)=5), so 50/3 /5=10/3. Which is the radius. Distance to l₁: 3*(8/3) +4*(4/3) -5=8 +16/3 -5=3 +16/3=25/3. Absolute value divided by 5:25/3 /5=5/3. Which is 0.5*r=0.5*(10/3)=5/3. Correct. Also, check the arc ratio. The central angle is 120°, so arc lengths are 120° and 240°, which is ratio 2:1. Therefore, this satisfies the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, the answer for part (2) is the circle with center (8/3,4/3) and radius 10/3. Final Answer(1) The length of the chord is boxed{2sqrt{3}}.(2) The equation of circle ( M ) is boxed{left(x - dfrac{8}{3}right)^2 + left(y - dfrac{4}{3}right)^2 = dfrac{100}{9}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the line ( l_1: 3x + 4y - 5 = 0 ) and the circle ( O: x^2 + y^2 = 4 ):(1) To find the length of the chord intercepted by circle ( O ) on line ( l_1 ):- The radius ( r ) of circle ( O ) is 2.- The distance ( d ) from the center (0, 0) to the line ( l_1 ) is calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line:  [  d = frac{|3 cdot 0 + 4 cdot 0 - 5|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = frac{5}{5} = 1  ]- The length of the chord is given by ( 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} ):  [  2sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = 2sqrt{3}  ]- Therefore, the length of the chord is (boxed{2sqrt{3}}).(2) To find the equation of circle ( M ):- Line ( l_2 ) passing through ((-1, 2)) and perpendicular to ( l_1 ) has a slope of (frac{4}{3}).

I need to find an integer that&#39;s smaller than the square root of 23. Hmm, okay. First, I remember that square roots can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can figure this out by estimating. Let me start by recalling some squares of numbers to get a sense of where √23 might fall.So, 4 squared is 16, right? Because 4×4=16. And 5 squared is 25, since 5×5=25. Wait, 23 is between 16 and 25. That means √23 is somewhere between 4 and 5. Exactly, because the square root of a number between two squares will be between the original numbers. So, √16=4, √25=5, so √23 is between 4 and 5. Therefore, the integer part of √23 is 4. So, if I need an integer smaller than √23, it has to be less than that decimal value. Since √23 is approximately 4.something, the integers less than that would be 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, and negative integers. But wait, the problem just says an integer smaller than √23. It doesn&#39;t specify positive or negative, right? So technically, any integer less than √23 (~4.796) would work. But maybe the question expects a positive integer? Let me check the problem again.The problem says: &quot;Please write down an integer that is smaller than √23.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify positive or negative. So, technically, even negative integers are allowed. But perhaps the user expects a positive integer since square roots are typically discussed in the positive realm. But maybe not. Well, since it&#39;s not specified, both could be possible. But let me think again. If I just need any integer smaller than √23, then 4 is an integer smaller than it? Wait, no. Wait, √23 is approximately 4.796. So 4 is less than that. But 4 is an integer. So 4 is an integer smaller than √23? Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, 4 is less than √23? Wait, 4 is 4, √23 is about 4.796. So 4 is indeed less than 4.796. Therefore, 4 is an integer that&#39;s smaller than √23. So if the question is asking for an integer smaller than √23, 4 is a valid answer, as well as 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, etc. But maybe they just want one example. So, the most straightforward answer would be 4. But let me make sure.Wait, hold on. Wait, is 4 smaller than √23? Since √23 is approximately 4.796, yes, 4 is less than 4.796. So 4 is indeed an integer smaller than √23. Therefore, 4 is a valid answer. Alternatively, 3 is also valid, but 4 is the largest integer that is still less than √23. So, if they just need one integer, 4 is the highest possible, but any integer less than that would work. However, maybe the problem expects the largest such integer. Let me check the problem again: &quot;Please write down an integer that is smaller than √23.&quot; It just says &quot;an integer,&quot; not the largest or anything. So any of them would be correct. But perhaps they are looking for 4, as the floor of √23. But maybe to check, let&#39;s verify.Alternatively, if I miscalculated √23, maybe I need to approximate it better. Let me see. Let&#39;s compute √23 more accurately. So, 4.8 squared is 23.04, right? 4.8×4.8=23.04. So, √23 is a little less than 4.8. Because 4.8 squared is 23.04, which is slightly higher than 23. So, √23≈4.7958 or something like that. So, approximately 4.7958. Therefore, 4.7958 is between 4.79 and 4.8. So, integers less than that are 4, 3, etc. So, 4 is an integer less than √23, yes. Therefore, 4 is a valid answer. However, perhaps the problem expects the greatest integer less than √23, which would be 4. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Wait, let&#39;s check the problem again: &quot;Please write down an integer that is smaller than √23.&quot; So, they just need any integer smaller than √23. So, 4, 3, 2, etc. So, since it&#39;s just asking for one example, the simplest answer is 4. Alternatively, maybe even 0 or negative numbers. For example, -5 is an integer smaller than √23, but maybe they want a positive one. The problem doesn&#39;t specify, so both are acceptable. But in most cases, when people ask for integers in the context of square roots without specifying, they might mean positive integers. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, either is acceptable. However, 4 is the largest integer less than √23. So, maybe the answer is 4. Let me check once again.Wait, if √23≈4.795, then 4 is less than 4.795. So, 4 is indeed an integer smaller than √23. So, 4 is a valid answer. So, maybe the answer is 4. Alternatively, 3, but 4 is closer. So, depending on what the problem expects. But as per the problem statement, it just asks for an integer smaller than √23. So, 4 is correct, and it&#39;s the maximum integer that is smaller, so maybe that&#39;s the answer they are looking for. So, I think 4 is the answer here.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;To find an integer smaller than (sqrt{23}), we start by estimating the value of (sqrt{23}). We know that:- (4^2 = 16)- (5^2 = 25)Since (23) is between (16) and (25), (sqrt{23}) must be between (4) and (5). To refine our estimate, we calculate:- (4.8^2 = 23.04), which is slightly more than (23).Thus, (sqrt{23}) is approximately (4.795). The integers less than (4.795) are (4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, ldots). The largest integer smaller than (sqrt{23}) is (4).Therefore, the integer that is smaller than (sqrt{23}) is (boxed{4}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find an integer that&#39;s smaller than the square root of 23. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, sqrt(23) would be a number that when multiplied by itself equals 23. But since 23 isn&#39;t a perfect square, the square root won&#39;t be an integer. Right?Let me try to recall the perfect squares around 23. Let&#39;s see, 4 squared is 16, 5 squared is 25. Oh, right! So, sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5. Therefore, sqrt(23) must be somewhere between 4 and 5 because 23 is between 16 and 25. So, sqrt(23) is approximately... Hmm, maybe around 4.7 or 4.8? Let me check that.Wait, if I square 4.7, that&#39;s 4.7 * 4.7. Let me calculate that. 4 * 4 is 16, 4 * 0.7 is 2.8, 0.7 * 4 is another 2.8, and 0.7 * 0.7 is 0.49. So adding those up: 16 + 2.8 + 2.8 + 0.49. Let&#39;s do the addition step by step. 16 + 2.8 is 18.8. Then 18.8 + 2.8 is 21.6. Then 21.6 + 0.49 is 22.09. So, 4.7 squared is 22.09, which is less than 23. So, sqrt(23) must be a bit higher than 4.7.How about 4.8? Let&#39;s compute 4.8 * 4.8. 4 * 4 is 16, 4 * 0.8 is 3.2, 0.8 * 4 is another 3.2, and 0.8 * 0.8 is 0.64. Adding those: 16 + 3.2 + 3.2 + 0.64. First, 16 + 3.2 is 19.2, then 19.2 + 3.2 is 22.4, then 22.4 + 0.64 is 23.04. Oh, that&#39;s just a bit over 23. So, 4.8 squared is 23.04, which is slightly more than 23. Therefore, sqrt(23) is between 4.7 and 4.8, closer to 4.8.So, the square root of 23 is approximately 4.7958 or something like that. But since the problem is asking for an integer that&#39;s smaller than sqrt(23), and we know sqrt(23) is between 4 and 5, the integers smaller than that would be 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, and negative integers. But usually, when they talk about square roots, they refer to the principal (positive) square root, so sqrt(23) is about 4.7958. Therefore, integers less than that positive square root would be 4 and below. But maybe the question expects positive integers? Let me check.The problem says &quot;an integer smaller than sqrt(23)&quot;. Since sqrt(23) is approximately 4.7958, any integer less than that would be 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, etc. But maybe they just want a positive integer? Let me see. The question doesn&#39;t specify, but in some contexts, if they just say &quot;integer&quot; without qualification, it could be negative or positive. However, since sqrt(23) is positive, and if they want an integer less than that, negative integers would definitely be smaller. But maybe they expect a positive integer close to the square root. Hmm.But wait, the problem doesn&#39;t specify positive or negative, so technically, any integer less than approximately 4.7958 is acceptable. So, for example, 4 is an integer less than sqrt(23) because 4 is less than 4.7958. Similarly, 3 is also less, 2, 1, 0, -1, etc. So, there are infinitely many integers smaller than sqrt(23). But the problem says &quot;Please write down an integer that is smaller than sqrt(23)&quot;. So, probably any of them is correct, but maybe they expect the largest integer less than sqrt(23), which is 4. Because in math problems, when they ask for the greatest integer less than or equal to a number, that&#39;s the floor function. But here, it&#39;s just &quot;an integer&quot;, not necessarily the greatest one.But since the question is straightforward, perhaps they just want any integer less than sqrt(23). For example, 4 is a valid answer. Also, 0 is a valid answer. But maybe the answer expects the floor of sqrt(23), which is 4, as the standard answer. Let me think again.Wait, if they just ask for an integer smaller than sqrt(23), then 4 is correct because 4 &lt; sqrt(23) (~4.7958). But also, 3 is correct, and 2, etc. So, the problem might accept any of these. But perhaps the most straightforward answer is 4, as it&#39;s the closest integer below sqrt(23). Let me verify with an example.If the question were, &quot;write down an integer smaller than sqrt(25)&quot;, which is 5. Then integers smaller than 5 are 4,3,2,1,0,... So, 4 would be the immediate one. Similarly, in this case, sqrt(23) is approximately 4.7958, so the immediate integer below is 4. So, I think the answer expected here is 4.But to make sure, maybe I should check another angle. Let&#39;s compute sqrt(23) more accurately. Let&#39;s see. Since 4.7958 squared is approximately 23. Let me use another method to approximate sqrt(23). Let&#39;s use the Newton-Raphson method.We can approximate sqrt(23). Let&#39;s start with a guess. Let&#39;s say x0 = 4.8. Then, compute x1 = x0 - (x0^2 - 23)/(2x0). So, x0^2 is 23.04, so x0^2 -23 = 0.04. Then, 2x0 is 9.6. So, x1 = 4.8 - (0.04)/9.6. 0.04 divided by 9.6 is 0.0041666... So, x1 = 4.8 - 0.0041666... ≈ 4.7958333...So, sqrt(23) ≈ 4.7958333... So, yes, approximately 4.7958. So, integers less than this are 4, 3, 2, etc. But 4 is the largest integer less than sqrt(23). Therefore, if the question is looking for the floor of sqrt(23), it would be 4. But since the question just says &quot;an integer that is smaller than sqrt(23)&quot;, then 4 is acceptable, as well as others.But the problem says &quot;Please write down an integer&quot;. Since they say &quot;an integer&quot; and not &quot;all integers&quot;, perhaps any one of them is correct. But maybe the most straightforward answer is 4. However, to confirm, let me check what 4 squared is. 4 squared is 16, which is less than 23. Therefore, 4 is less than sqrt(23). Wait, but 16 is less than 23, so sqrt(16) = 4, sqrt(23) is greater than 4. So yes, 4 is less than sqrt(23). Therefore, 4 is a valid answer.Alternatively, if someone answers 3, that&#39;s also correct because 3 is less than 4.7958. But 4 is closer. Since the problem is presented in a math context, perhaps expecting the floor value. Let me check if there is any convention here. In mathematics, the greatest integer less than or equal to a number is called the floor function. So floor(sqrt(23)) is 4. Therefore, if someone is to answer, they might put 4. But since the question is not asking for the floor function, but just any integer smaller than sqrt(23), technically any integer less than ~4.7958 is acceptable.But given that it&#39;s a math problem, maybe expecting the maximal integer less than sqrt(23), which is 4. Otherwise, if they accept any, then even 0 or negatives. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, maybe the answer is 4. Let me see if there are any restrictions. The problem didn&#39;t say &quot;positive integer&quot;, so maybe negative integers are also allowed. For example, -5 is an integer smaller than sqrt(23). But maybe the problem expects a positive integer. However, since sqrt(23) is positive, any negative integer is also smaller. So, if the answer can be any integer, negative or positive, then there are infinitely many correct answers. But since the question says &quot;Please write down an integer&quot;, the user probably expects a specific answer. In math problems like this, usually, the intended answer is the floor of sqrt(23), which is 4. So, I think 4 is the answer expected here.To confirm, let&#39;s check similar problems. For example, if the question was &quot;Write down an integer smaller than sqrt(10)&quot;, sqrt(10) is approx 3.16, so integers smaller are 3,2,1,0,... but the floor is 3. So, the answer would be 3. Similarly, here, the answer is 4.Therefore, the answer is 4.Final AnswerThe integer is boxed{4}.&lt;/think&gt;To find an integer smaller than (sqrt{23}), we first note that (sqrt{23}) is between 4 and 5 because (4^2 = 16) and (5^2 = 25). Calculating further, we approximate (sqrt{23}) by checking values between 4 and 5. - (4.7^2 = 22.09), which is less than 23.- (4.8^2 = 23.04), which is slightly more than 23.Thus, (sqrt{23}) is approximately 4.7958. The integers smaller than this value are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, and negative integers. However, the largest integer less than (sqrt{23}) is 4. Therefore, the integer smaller than (sqrt{23}) is (boxed{4}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b69fb8c6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b69fb8c6><span class="icon" data-v-b69fb8c6>🔑:</span>To find an integer smaller than sqrt{23}, we first identify perfect squares near 23:- We know that 4^2 = 16 and 5^2 = 25.Using these perfect squares, we can establish the inequality 16 &lt; 23 &lt; 25.

So, we have a square ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point O. There&#39;s a point F on side CD. When we extend AF, it meets the extension of BC at point E. Then, extending OF intersects DE at point M. We need to find the measure of angle OMD.First, I need to visualize the square. Let me sketch it mentally. Square ABCD, so all sides are equal, all angles are 90 degrees. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at O, which is the center of the square. In a square, diagonals bisect each other, so AO = OC = BO = OD. Also, diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, right? Wait, no, in a square, diagonals are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees. So, angle between diagonals is 90 degrees. So, point O is the midpoint of both diagonals.Now, point F is on side CD. Let me note that CD is the bottom side of the square if I imagine the square with A at top left, B at top right, C at bottom right, D at bottom left. So, CD is the bottom side from C to D. Then, extending AF (from A to F on CD) meets the extension of BC at point E. Hmm. BC is the right side of the square, going down from B to C. If we extend BC beyond C, that would be going further down, but in this case, AF is being extended beyond F, which is on CD, so the extension of AF would go beyond F towards the direction opposite of A. Wait, AF starts at A, goes to F on CD, then is extended further. So, if AF is going from A (top left) to F (somewhere on CD), then extending AF beyond F would go towards the lower right. The extension of BC is beyond C, so if BC is from B (top right) to C (bottom right), extending BC would go beyond C to the right? Wait, no. BC is a vertical side, going from top right B down to C. Extending BC would mean going beyond C downwards, right? Wait, BC is vertical, so extending BC beyond C would be going further down, but the extension of AF is going from F towards lower right. So, how do these two meet at point E?Wait, maybe I need to correct my directions. Let me assign coordinates to the square to make this clearer. Let&#39;s place the square ABCD with coordinates: Let’s say A is (0,1), B is (1,1), C is (1,0), D is (0,0). So, the square is from (0,0) to (1,1). Then, diagonals AC and BD intersect at O, which is the center, so O would be at (0.5, 0.5). Point F is on CD. CD is from C (1,0) to D (0,0). So, CD is the bottom side from (1,0) to (0,0). Let&#39;s parameterize point F. Let’s say F is at (f, 0) where 0 ≤ f ≤1. Then, AF is the line from A (0,1) to F (f, 0). The equation of line AF can be found. Let&#39;s compute its slope: (0 - 1)/(f - 0) = -1/f. So, the equation is y - 1 = (-1/f)(x - 0), so y = (-1/f)x + 1.Now, the extension of AF meets the extension of BC at point E. BC is the side from B (1,1) to C (1,0). Extending BC beyond C would be the line x=1 extended beyond (1,0) downwards. Wait, x=1 is vertical, so beyond C is towards negative y. But AF is a line going from (0,1) to (f,0), and extended beyond F. Let&#39;s find where the line AF intersects the extension of BC.Since BC is the vertical line x=1. So, plug x=1 into AF&#39;s equation: y = (-1/f)(1) + 1 = 1 - 1/f. So, the intersection point E is at (1, 1 - 1/f). But wait, if we are extending BC beyond C, then C is at (1,0), so beyond C would be y &lt; 0. So, 1 - 1/f must be less than 0. Therefore, 1 - 1/f &lt; 0 ⇒ 1 &lt; 1/f ⇒ f &lt; 1. But f is between 0 and 1 since F is on CD. So, as long as f is between 0 and 1, 1/f is greater than 1, so 1 - 1/f is negative, so E is at (1, 1 - 1/f) below C.So, point E has coordinates (1, 1 - 1/f). Now, we need to extend OF and find its intersection with DE at point M.First, point O is (0.5, 0.5). Point F is (f,0). So, line OF is from (0.5, 0.5) to (f, 0). Let&#39;s find its equation. The slope is (0 - 0.5)/(f - 0.5) = (-0.5)/(f - 0.5). So, the equation is y - 0.5 = [(-0.5)/(f - 0.5)](x - 0.5).Now, DE is the line from D (0,0) to E (1, 1 - 1/f). Let&#39;s find the equation of DE. The slope is (1 - 1/f - 0)/(1 - 0) = (1 - 1/f)/1 = 1 - 1/f. So, equation is y = (1 - 1/f)x.We need to find the intersection point M between OF and DE. So, set the equations equal.From OF: y = [(-0.5)/(f - 0.5)](x - 0.5) + 0.5From DE: y = (1 - 1/f)xSet them equal:[(-0.5)/(f - 0.5)](x - 0.5) + 0.5 = (1 - 1/f)xLet me solve for x.Multiply both sides by (f - 0.5) to eliminate denominator:-0.5(x - 0.5) + 0.5(f - 0.5) = (1 - 1/f)x(f - 0.5)Expand left side:-0.5x + 0.25 + 0.5f - 0.25 = -0.5x + 0.5fRight side: (1 - 1/f)x(f - 0.5) = x[(f - 0.5) - (f - 0.5)/f] = x[f - 0.5 - (f - 0.5)/f]Wait, maybe better to compute (1 - 1/f)(f - 0.5)x:(1 - 1/f)(f - 0.5)x = [ (f -1)/f ] * (f - 0.5)xSo, left side is -0.5x + 0.5fRight side is [(f -1)(f - 0.5)/f] xSo:-0.5x + 0.5f = [(f -1)(f - 0.5)/f] xBring all terms to left:-0.5x + 0.5f - [(f -1)(f - 0.5)/f] x = 0Factor x:x[ -0.5 - ( (f -1)(f - 0.5)/f ) ] + 0.5f = 0Let me compute the coefficient of x:-0.5 - [ (f -1)(f - 0.5)/f ] = -0.5 - [ (f² -0.5f -f + 0.5)/f ] = -0.5 - [ (f² -1.5f + 0.5)/f ]= -0.5 - [ f -1.5 + 0.5/f ] = -0.5 - f +1.5 -0.5/f = ( -0.5 +1.5 ) - f -0.5/f = 1 - f -0.5/fSo, equation is:x(1 - f - 0.5/f ) + 0.5f = 0Therefore,x = -0.5f / (1 - f - 0.5/f )Multiply numerator and denominator by f to eliminate fraction:x = -0.5f² / (f - f² -0.5 )Denominator: f - f² -0.5 = -f² + f -0.5Factor out -1: - (f² - f + 0.5 )So, x = -0.5f² / [ - (f² - f + 0.5 ) ] = 0.5f² / (f² - f + 0.5 )Thus, x = (0.5f²) / (f² - f + 0.5 )Then, y = (1 - 1/f)x = (1 - 1/f)(0.5f²)/(f² -f +0.5 )Simplify (1 - 1/f) = (f -1)/fSo, y = (f -1)/f * 0.5f² / (f² -f +0.5 ) = 0.5f(f -1) / (f² -f +0.5 )Thus, coordinates of M are:x = 0.5f² / (f² - f + 0.5 )y = 0.5f(f -1) / (f² -f +0.5 )Now, we need to find angle OMD. Points O, M, D.Point D is (0,0), O is (0.5,0.5), M is (x,y) as above.So, angle OMD is the angle at point M between points O, M, D. Wait, no. Wait, angle OMD is the angle at point M between points O, M, D? Wait, no. In angle notation, angle OMD is the angle at point M with segments MO and MD. Wait, actually, no. In geometry, angle ABC is the angle at point B. So, angle OMD is the angle at point M between points O, M, D. Wait, but the problem says &quot;Find the measure of ∠OMD&quot;. So, angle at D? Wait, no. The angle is denoted with vertex in the middle. So, O-M-D, so the angle is at M. Wait, actually, no. Wait, maybe I need to check. The notation ∠OMD usually means the angle at point M between points O, M, D. But sometimes, different notations. But in standard notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So, ∠OMD is the angle at M between points O, M, D. But in the problem statement, &quot;intersects DE at point M&quot;, so DE is a line, M is a point on DE. So, O is a point, M is on DE, D is another point. So, the angle OMD is the angle at D? Wait, maybe not. Wait, O-M-D: if the angle is OMD, the vertex is M. Wait, no. Wait, in standard notation, angle ABC has vertex at B. So, angle OMD would have vertex at M. But O, M, D: the angle at M between O and D. But in the figure, M is on DE, and D is another point. So, the angle would be formed at M by lines MO and MD. But MD is from M to D, and MO is from M to O.Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the angle at D? But that would be angle DMO. Wait, the problem says &quot;Find the measure of ∠OMD&quot;. Hmm. Maybe there&#39;s confusion here. Let me verify.Alternatively, maybe angle OMD is the angle at point D between points O, M, and D. But in that case, the angle would be between points O, D, M. But the way it&#39;s written, ∠OMD, so vertex is M. Wait, but if O is connected to M and D is connected to M, then yes, angle at M between O and D. But given the points, maybe we need to confirm.But perhaps regardless of the position, we can compute the angle once we have coordinates.But since we have coordinates for O, M, D, we can compute vectors and find the angle.Point D is (0,0), M is (x,y), O is (0.5, 0.5). So, vectors:From M to O: (0.5 - x, 0.5 - y)From M to D: (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y)The angle between these two vectors is ∠OMD at M.So, using the dot product formula:cosθ = ( (0.5 - x)(-x) + (0.5 - y)(-y) ) / ( sqrt( (0.5 - x)^2 + (0.5 - y)^2 ) * sqrt( x^2 + y^2 ) )But this seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Alternatively, since the problem is likely looking for a specific angle measure, maybe 45 degrees or 90 degrees, given it&#39;s a square. Perhaps there&#39;s some symmetry or property that makes this angle constant regardless of the position of F.Wait, in the problem statement, it&#39;s possible that no matter where F is on CD, the angle OMD remains the same. Let me test this with a specific case.Let me pick F at the midpoint of CD. So, if F is midpoint, then f = 0.5. Let&#39;s compute coordinates of E and M.If f = 0.5, then E is at (1, 1 - 1/0.5 ) = (1, 1 - 2) = (1, -1).Then, line OF connects O (0.5, 0.5) to F (0.5, 0). So, OF is a vertical line x=0.5 from (0.5, 0.5) down to (0.5, 0). Then, DE connects D (0,0) to E (1, -1). The equation of DE is y = -x (since slope is (-1 -0)/(1 -0) = -1).Intersection of x=0.5 and y = -x is at (0.5, -0.5). So, point M is at (0.5, -0.5).Now, angle OMD. Points O (0.5,0.5), M (0.5, -0.5), D (0,0). So, angle at M between O and D.Wait, point M is (0.5, -0.5). So, vectors from M to O: (0.5 - 0.5, 0.5 - (-0.5)) = (0, 1)From M to D: (0 - 0.5, 0 - (-0.5)) = (-0.5, 0.5)So, angle between vector (0,1) and (-0.5, 0.5). Let&#39;s compute the angle between these two vectors.Dot product: (0)(-0.5) + (1)(0.5) = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5Magnitude of first vector: sqrt(0² + 1²) = 1Magnitude of second vector: sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) = √2/2Thus, cosθ = 0.5 / (1 * √2/2) = 0.5 / (√2/2) = (0.5 * 2)/√2 = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071Therefore, θ = 45 degrees.So, in this specific case, angle OMD is 45 degrees. Hmm. Maybe the answer is 45 degrees regardless of F&#39;s position. Let me check another position.Take F at point C, which is (1,0). So, f=1.Then, AF is the line from A (0,1) to F (1,0). The equation is y = -x +1. Extending AF would just be the same line. But extension of BC is beyond C (1,0). But line AF already passes through C (since when x=1, y=0). So, point E would be C itself if f=1. But the problem states that F is on CD, which is from C to D. If F is at C, then AF is AC, which is the diagonal, and extension of BC meets at C. But then point E is C, and DE is DC, which is the side CD. Then, OF is OC, which is the same as diagonal. Then, intersection M would be C? Wait, but DE is CD, which is from D to C. If we extend OF (which is OC) and intersect DE (CD) at M, then M would be C. Then angle OMD would be angle at M=C between O, C, D. But points O, C, D: angle at C between O and D. But OC and DC. OC is the diagonal from O (0.5,0.5) to C (1,0), and DC is from D (0,0) to C (1,0). The angle at C between O and D. Let&#39;s compute that.Vector CO: from C to O: (0.5 -1, 0.5 -0) = (-0.5, 0.5)Vector CD: from C to D: (0 -1, 0 -0) = (-1, 0)The angle between (-0.5, 0.5) and (-1, 0). Compute the angle:Dot product: (-0.5)(-1) + (0.5)(0) = 0.5 + 0 = 0.5Magnitude of CO: sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 +0.25)=sqrt(0.5)=√2/2Magnitude of CD: sqrt((-1)^2 +0^2)=1Thus, cosθ=0.5/(√2/2 *1)=0.5/(√2/2)=0.5*2/√2=1/√2, so θ=45 degrees.Wait, so even when F is at C, angle OMD is 45 degrees. Interesting. So maybe regardless of F&#39;s position, angle OMD is 45 degrees.Let me check another position. Let&#39;s take F at D, so f=0. Wait, F is on CD, so CD from C (1,0) to D (0,0). If F is at D (0,0), then AF is from A (0,1) to D (0,0), which is the vertical line x=0. Extending AF beyond D would still be x=0. The extension of BC is beyond C (1,0) downwards. So, line BC is vertical x=1, extended beyond C. The intersection of AF (x=0) and BC (x=1) would not occur unless extended in some other direction? Wait, AF is x=0, BC is x=1. These are parallel lines (both vertical), so they don&#39;t intersect. Hence, in this case, when F is at D, the lines AF and BC are parallel and do not meet. Therefore, point E is undefined. Therefore, F cannot be at D. So, F must be between C and D, not including D. So, f is in (0,1].But if we take F approaching D (f approaching 0), then point E goes to (1,1 -1/f). As f approaches 0, 1/f approaches infinity, so 1 -1/f approaches negative infinity. So, E goes to (1, -infty). Then, DE is the line from D (0,0) to E (1, -infty), which is a line with slope approaching negative infinity, i.e., a vertical line. Wait, no, slope is ( -infty -0 ) / (1 -0 ) = -infty, so the line DE becomes the vertical line x=1. But OF is from O (0.5,0.5) to F (f,0), which as f approaches 0, OF approaches the line from (0.5,0.5) to (0,0). So, the intersection M between OF and DE. If DE becomes x=1 (as f approaches 0), then the intersection M would be at (1, y), but OF is approaching the line from (0.5,0.5) to (0,0), which is y = x. So, intersection at x=1 would be (1,1), but DE is x=1, y going to -infty. Wait, maybe my previous analysis is conflicting.Alternatively, perhaps taking F near D, say f=0.1.Then, E is (1,1 -1/0.1)=(1,1 -10)=(1,-9).DE is the line from D(0,0) to E(1,-9), slope is -9. Equation: y = -9x.OF is from O(0.5,0.5) to F(0.1,0). Slope of OF is (0 -0.5)/(0.1 -0.5)= (-0.5)/(-0.4)=1.25. Equation: y -0.5=1.25(x -0.5). So, y=1.25x -0.625 +0.5=1.25x -0.125.Intersection with DE (y=-9x):Set 1.25x -0.125 = -9x1.25x +9x =0.12510.25x=0.125x=0.125/10.25=125/10250=25/2050=5/410≈0.0122Then y= -9*(5/410)= -45/410≈-0.1098So, point M is approximately (0.0122, -0.1098)Now, angle OMD. Points O(0.5,0.5), M(0.0122,-0.1098), D(0,0)Compute vectors:From M to O: (0.5 -0.0122,0.5 -(-0.1098))=(0.4878,0.6098)From M to D: (0 -0.0122,0 -(-0.1098))=(-0.0122,0.1098)Compute the angle between these vectors.Dot product: (0.4878)(-0.0122) + (0.6098)(0.1098) ≈ -0.0060 +0.0669 ≈0.0609Magnitude of MO: sqrt(0.4878² +0.6098²)≈sqrt(0.238+0.371)=sqrt(0.609)≈0.781Magnitude of MD: sqrt((-0.0122)^2 +0.1098^2)≈sqrt(0.00015+0.0121)=sqrt(0.01225)=0.1107Thus, cosθ ≈0.0609/(0.781*0.1107)=0.0609/(0.0865)≈0.704Which is approximately cos45°≈0.707, so θ≈45°. Close enough considering rounding errors. So, even when F is near D, the angle is approximately 45 degrees.Therefore, it seems that regardless of the position of F on CD (excluding D), angle OMD is 45 degrees. Thus, the answer is 45 degrees, which is π/4 radians. But the problem asks for the measure, so 45 degrees.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a geometric proof for this. Let&#39;s think.Since ABCD is a square, with O as the center. Let&#39;s consider coordinate system as before. Let me use coordinate geometry again.Let’s denote square ABCD with coordinates: A(0,1), B(1,1), C(1,0), D(0,0), O(0.5,0.5). Let F be (f,0) with 0 &lt; f ≤1.Line AF has equation y = (-1/f)x +1, as before. It intersects extension of BC (x=1) at E(1, 1 -1/f).Line DE connects D(0,0) to E(1,1 -1/f), with slope m_DE = (1 -1/f -0)/1 =1 -1/f.Equation of DE: y = (1 -1/f)x.Line OF connects O(0.5,0.5) to F(f,0). Its slope is (0 -0.5)/(f -0.5) = -0.5/(f -0.5).Equation of OF: y -0.5 = [-0.5/(f -0.5)](x -0.5).Find intersection M of OF and DE.As we derived earlier, coordinates of M are:x = 0.5f² / (f² - f +0.5 )y =0.5f(f -1) / (f² -f +0.5 )Now, to find angle OMD, which is the angle at M between points O, M, D.But rather than computing vectors each time, maybe we can find that the triangle OMD is always a 45-45-90 triangle or something similar.Alternatively, compute the slopes of lines MO and MD and see if their product is -1 (perpendicular) or something else.Wait, angle at M. The tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is |(m2 - m1)/(1 +m1m2)|.So, compute slopes of MO and MD.First, coordinates:Point M: (x,y) = (0.5f²/(f² -f +0.5), 0.5f(f -1)/(f² -f +0.5))Point O: (0.5,0.5)Point D: (0,0)Slope of MO: (0.5 - y)/(0.5 -x )Slope of MD: (0 - y)/(0 -x ) = y/xCompute slope of MO:0.5 - y =0.5 - [0.5f(f -1)/(f² -f +0.5)] = [0.5(f² -f +0.5) -0.5f(f -1)] / (f² -f +0.5)Compute numerator:0.5f² -0.5f +0.25 -0.5f² +0.5f =0.5f² -0.5f +0.25 -0.5f² +0.5f =0.25Therefore, 0.5 - y =0.25 / (f² -f +0.5 )Similarly, 0.5 -x =0.5 - [0.5f²/(f² -f +0.5)] = [0.5(f² -f +0.5) -0.5f²] / (f² -f +0.5 )Numerator:0.5f² -0.5f +0.25 -0.5f² = -0.5f +0.25Thus, 0.5 -x = (-0.5f +0.25)/(f² -f +0.5 )Therefore, slope of MO is [0.25/(f² -f +0.5 )] / [ (-0.5f +0.25)/(f² -f +0.5 ) ] =0.25 / (-0.5f +0.25 )= (0.25)/(-0.5(f -0.5)) = -0.5/(f -0.5 )Slope of MD is y/x = [0.5f(f -1)/(f² -f +0.5 )] / [0.5f²/(f² -f +0.5 )] = [0.5f(f -1)] /0.5f² = (f -1)/fSo, slope of MO is -0.5/(f -0.5 )Slope of MD is (f -1)/fNow, the tangent of angle between them is |(m2 -m1)/(1 +m1m2)|Let’s compute m1 = slope of MO = -0.5/(f -0.5 )m2 = slope of MD = (f -1)/fCompute (m2 - m1):(f -1)/f - [ -0.5/(f -0.5 ) ] = (f -1)/f +0.5/(f -0.5 )Compute denominator 1 + m1m2:1 + [ -0.5/(f -0.5 ) ] * [ (f -1)/f ] =1 -0.5(f -1)/(f(f -0.5 ))Therefore,tanθ = | [ (f -1)/f +0.5/(f -0.5 ) ] / [1 -0.5(f -1)/(f(f -0.5 )) ] |This seems complicated. Let&#39;s compute numerator:Let me find common denominators:First term: (f -1)/fSecond term:0.5/(f -0.5 )Multiply numerator and denominator terms:Numerator:[(f -1)(f -0.5 ) +0.5f ] / [f(f -0.5 ) ]= [ (f² -0.5f -f +0.5 ) +0.5f ] / [f(f -0.5 ) ]= [ f² -1.5f +0.5 +0.5f ] / [f(f -0.5 ) ]= [ f² -f +0.5 ] / [f(f -0.5 ) ]Denominator:1 -0.5(f -1)/(f(f -0.5 )) = [ f(f -0.5 ) -0.5(f -1 ) ] / [f(f -0.5 ) ]Compute numerator:f(f -0.5 ) -0.5(f -1 ) = f² -0.5f -0.5f +0.5 = f² -f +0.5Therefore, denominator is [f² -f +0.5 ] / [f(f -0.5 ) ]Therefore, tanθ = | [ (f² -f +0.5 ) / (f(f -0.5 )) ] / [ (f² -f +0.5 ) / (f(f -0.5 )) ] | = |1| =1Therefore, tanθ=1, so θ=45 degrees.Wow! So, regardless of f (as long as f ≠0.5 and f ≠0 where denominators may be zero), the tangent of the angle is 1, so the angle is 45 degrees.Therefore, angle OMD is 45 degrees.Final AnswerThe measure of angle OMD is boxed{45^circ}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we start by placing the square (ABCD) on a coordinate system with (A(0,1)), (B(1,1)), (C(1,0)), (D(0,0)), and the center (O(0.5,0.5)). Point (F) is on side (CD) with coordinates ((f,0)) where (0 &lt; f leq 1). 1. Equation of Line (AF):   - The slope of (AF) is (-frac{1}{f}), giving the equation (y = -frac{1}{f}x + 1).2. Finding Point (E):   - The extension of (AF) intersects the extension of (BC) (vertical line (x = 1)) at point (E). Substituting (x = 1) into the equation of (AF), we find (E(1, 1 - frac{1}{f})).3. Equation of Line (DE):   - The line (DE) has a slope of (1 - frac{1}{f}) and passes through (D(0,0)), giving the equation (y = (1 - frac{1}{f})x).4. Equation of Line (OF):   - The line (OF) connects (O(0.5,0.5)) to (F(f,0)). Its slope is (-frac{0.5}{f - 0.5}), giving the equation (y - 0.5 = -frac{0.5}{f - 0.5}(x - 0.5)).5. Finding Intersection (M):   - Solving the equations of (OF) and (DE) gives the coordinates of (M). After algebraic manipulation, we find:     [     x = frac{0.5f^2}{f^2 - f + 0.5}, quad y = frac{0.5f(f - 1)}{f^2 - f + 0.5}     ]6. Calculating the Angle (angle OMD):   - Using vectors from (M) to (O) and (M) to (D), we compute the slopes of lines (MO) and (MD). The tangent of the angle between these lines is found to be 1, indicating the angle is (45^circ).Thus, the measure of (angle OMD) is (boxed{45^circ}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out the measure of angle OMD in square ABCD. Hmm, first, I need to visualize the square and all the points mentioned. Let me sketch it out mentally. So, square ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point O. Since it&#39;s a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees. So, O is the center of the square.Point F is on side CD. Then, the extension of AF meets the extension of BC at point E. That means if I extend line AF beyond F, it will intersect the extension of BC beyond C at point E. Then, the extension of OF intersects DE at point M. So, I need to extend OF beyond F (or O?) to meet DE at M. The goal is to find the measure of angle OMD.Let me start by assigning coordinates to the square. Let&#39;s assume the square has side length 1 for simplicity. Let&#39;s place the square on a coordinate system with point A at (0,1), B at (1,1), C at (1,0), and D at (0,0). Then, the center O, where the diagonals intersect, would be at (0.5, 0.5).Point F is on CD. Let&#39;s denote F as (x,0) where x is between 0 and 1. Then, the line AF goes from A(0,1) to F(x,0). Let&#39;s find the equation of line AF. The slope would be (0 - 1)/(x - 0) = -1/x. So, the equation is y - 1 = (-1/x)(x&#39; - 0), which simplifies to y = (-1/x)x&#39; + 1.Now, the extension of AF meets the extension of BC at point E. BC is the side from B(1,1) to C(1,0). The extension of BC beyond C is the line x=1, going downward. But AF is already going towards F on CD, so to find point E, we need to see where AF extended meets the extension of BC beyond C. Wait, but BC is vertical at x=1. So, the extension of BC beyond C is still x=1, y &lt; 0. So, to find E, set x&#39; = 1 in the equation of AF and solve for y.From the equation of AF: y = (-1/x)(1) + 1 = (-1/x) + 1. Therefore, point E is at (1, 1 - 1/x). But since E is on the extension of BC beyond C, y must be less than 0. Therefore, 1 - 1/x &lt; 0 =&gt; 1/x &gt; 1 =&gt; x &lt; 1. Which is true since F is on CD, so x is between 0 and 1. So E is at (1, 1 - 1/x). Hmm, that makes sense.Next, the extension of OF intersects DE at point M. Let&#39;s first find the coordinates of O, which is (0.5, 0.5). Point F is (x,0). So, line OF goes from (0.5, 0.5) to (x,0). Let&#39;s find the equation of line OF. The slope is (0 - 0.5)/(x - 0.5) = (-0.5)/(x - 0.5). So, the equation is y - 0.5 = [(-0.5)/(x - 0.5)](x&#39; - 0.5). Let&#39;s simplify this.Multiply both sides by (x - 0.5):(y - 0.5)(x - 0.5) = -0.5(x&#39; - 0.5)But maybe it&#39;s easier to write in terms of variables. Let me parameterize line OF. Starting at O(0.5,0.5), going towards F(x,0). The direction vector is (x - 0.5, -0.5). So, parametric equations:x = 0.5 + t(x - 0.5)y = 0.5 - 0.5tWe need to extend OF beyond F, so t &gt; 1. Wait, but maybe M is on DE, which is from D(0,0) to E(1,1 - 1/x). Let&#39;s find the equation of DE. Points D(0,0) and E(1,1 - 1/x). The slope is (1 - 1/x - 0)/ (1 - 0) = 1 - 1/x. So, equation is y = (1 - 1/x)x&#39;.Now, to find point M, we need the intersection of the extension of OF with DE. Let&#39;s find parametric equations for both lines and solve for t and s.Line OF parametrized as:x = 0.5 + t(x - 0.5)y = 0.5 - 0.5tLine DE parametrized as:x = s*1 + (1 - s)*0 = sy = s*(1 - 1/x) + (1 - s)*0 = s*(1 - 1/x)We need to solve for t and s where:0.5 + t(x - 0.5) = s0.5 - 0.5t = s*(1 - 1/x)Substitute s from the first equation into the second:0.5 - 0.5t = [0.5 + t(x - 0.5)]*(1 - 1/x)Let me expand the right-hand side:[0.5 + t(x - 0.5)]*(1 - 1/x) = 0.5*(1 - 1/x) + t(x - 0.5)*(1 - 1/x)So:0.5 - 0.5t = 0.5*(1 - 1/x) + t(x - 0.5)*(1 - 1/x)Let&#39;s compute each term:First, 0.5*(1 - 1/x) = 0.5 - 0.5/xThen, (x - 0.5)*(1 - 1/x) = (x - 0.5) - (x - 0.5)/x = x - 0.5 - 1 + 0.5/x = (x - 1.5) + 0.5/xWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way. Let me rearrange the equation:0.5 - 0.5t = 0.5 - 0.5/x + t(x - 0.5)(1 - 1/x)Subtract 0.5 from both sides:-0.5t = -0.5/x + t(x - 0.5)(1 - 1/x)Bring all terms to left-hand side:-0.5t + 0.5/x - t(x - 0.5)(1 - 1/x) = 0Factor t terms:t[-0.5 - (x - 0.5)(1 - 1/x)] + 0.5/x = 0Compute the coefficient of t:-0.5 - (x - 0.5)(1 - 1/x)Let&#39;s expand (x - 0.5)(1 - 1/x):= (x - 0.5) - (x - 0.5)/x= x - 0.5 - 1 + 0.5/x= x - 1.5 + 0.5/xSo, coefficient of t:-0.5 - (x - 1.5 + 0.5/x)= -0.5 - x + 1.5 - 0.5/x= (-x) + ( -0.5 + 1.5) - 0.5/x= -x + 1 - 0.5/xTherefore, equation becomes:t(-x + 1 - 0.5/x) + 0.5/x = 0Solve for t:t = - (0.5/x) / (-x + 1 - 0.5/x)Multiply numerator and denominator by x to eliminate denominators:t = - (0.5) / (-x^2 + x - 0.5)So,t = 0.5 / (x^2 - x + 0.5)Now, once we have t, we can find s from the first equation:s = 0.5 + t(x - 0.5)Plug t into s:s = 0.5 + [0.5 / (x^2 - x + 0.5)]*(x - 0.5)Let me compute this:s = 0.5 + 0.5(x - 0.5)/(x^2 - x + 0.5)But x^2 - x + 0.5 = x^2 - x + 0.25 + 0.25 = (x - 0.5)^2 + 0.25. Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, compute denominator:x^2 - x + 0.5 = x^2 - x + 0.5So, s = 0.5 + [0.5(x - 0.5)] / (x^2 - x + 0.5)Perhaps factor numerator and denominator? Let&#39;s see.Numerator: 0.5(x - 0.5)Denominator: x^2 - x + 0.5Let me write denominator as x^2 - x + 0.5. Let&#39;s check discriminant: (-1)^2 - 4*1*0.5 = 1 - 2 = -1, so it doesn&#39;t factor over reals. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps write denominator as x^2 - x + 0.25 + 0.25 = (x - 0.5)^2 + 0.25. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe we can express s in terms of x. Let&#39;s leave it as is for now.Once we have s, we can find coordinates of M as (s, s(1 - 1/x)).But this seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach. Let&#39;s consider specific coordinates. Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t give specific positions for F, so maybe the angle is constant regardless of where F is on CD. That would make sense; in many geometry problems like this, the angle is fixed.So, maybe angle OMD is 45 degrees, or 90 degrees, or something like that. Let me test with specific coordinates. Let&#39;s choose F at the midpoint of CD. So, F is at (0.5, 0). Then, let&#39;s compute E, M, and then compute angle OMD.Case 1: F is at (0.5, 0)So, x = 0.5.First, point E is (1, 1 - 1/x) but x = 0.5, so 1 - 1/0.5 = 1 - 2 = -1. Therefore, E is (1, -1).Then, DE is the line from D(0,0) to E(1, -1). The slope is (-1 - 0)/(1 - 0) = -1. So, equation is y = -x.Line OF: O is (0.5, 0.5), F is (0.5, 0). So, line OF is vertical line x = 0.5 from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 0). The extension of OF beyond F is the same vertical line x=0.5 below F. So, intersection with DE (y = -x) at x=0.5, y = -0.5. Therefore, point M is (0.5, -0.5).Now, need to find angle OMD. Points:O: (0.5, 0.5)M: (0.5, -0.5)D: (0,0)So, angle at M: points O-M-D. Wait, angle OMD is at point M? Wait, no. The angle is at point M, between points O, M, D. Wait, angle OMD is the angle at M between O and D. Wait, no. The notation ∠OMD is the angle at point M, with sides MO and MD. Wait, no, usually angle ABC is at point B. So, angle OMD is at point D? Wait, no. Wait, angle OMD is at point M: vertex at M, with sides MO and MD. Wait, but O-M-D: points O, M, D. So the angle is at M: ∠OMD is the angle at M between points O and D. Wait, no, I think the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠OMD is the angle at M, formed by points O, M, D. So, yes, vertex at M.Wait, but in our coordinates:Point O: (0.5, 0.5)Point M: (0.5, -0.5)Point D: (0,0)So, vectors from M to O: (0.5 - 0.5, 0.5 - (-0.5)) = (0, 1)Vectors from M to D: (0 - 0.5, 0 - (-0.5)) = (-0.5, 0.5)So, angle between vectors (0,1) and (-0.5, 0.5). Let&#39;s compute the angle between them.The cosine of the angle is the dot product divided by the product of magnitudes.Dot product: (0)(-0.5) + (1)(0.5) = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5Magnitude of (0,1): 1Magnitude of (-0.5, 0.5): sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) = √2/2Therefore, cosθ = 0.5 / (1 * √2/2) = 0.5 / (√2/2) = (0.5 * 2)/√2 = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071Therefore, θ = 45 degrees.Wait, so angle OMD is 45 degrees in this case. Hmm. Since the problem didn&#39;t specify where F is, and when we took F at the midpoint, the angle is 45 degrees. Maybe it&#39;s always 45 degrees regardless of F&#39;s position? Let&#39;s test another position for F.Case 2: Let&#39;s take F at point C, which is (1, 0). Then, AF is the line from A(0,1) to C(1,0). The equation of AF is y = -x + 1. The extension of AF would be the same line. The extension of BC beyond C is the line x=1 beyond point C(1,0). But AF already passes through C(1,0), so point E would be C itself? But the problem states that AF intersects the extension of BC at E. If F is C, then AF is AC, which meets BC at C. But the problem says the extension of AF meets the extension of BC. So if F is C, then AF is AC, which meets BC at C, but since we need the extension, maybe E is C? However, then DE would be DC, which is from D(0,0) to C(1,0). Then, the extension of OF: O is (0.5,0.5), F is C(1,0). Line OF is from (0.5,0.5) to (1,0). Let&#39;s find its equation. The slope is (0 - 0.5)/(1 - 0.5) = (-0.5)/0.5 = -1. So, equation: y - 0.5 = -1(x - 0.5) =&gt; y = -x + 1. This line is the same as AF, which is AC. So DE is DC, which is y=0. The intersection of OF (y = -x +1) with DE (y=0) is at x=1, y=0, which is point C. Therefore, M is point C. Then, angle OMD would be angle OMC. But point D is (0,0), so angle at M (which is C) between O, M, D. Points O(0.5,0.5), M=C(1,0), D(0,0). So angle at C between O and D. Let&#39;s compute that angle.Vectors from C to O: (-0.5, 0.5)Vectors from C to D: (-1, 0)The angle between (-0.5,0.5) and (-1,0). Let&#39;s compute the angle.Dot product: (-0.5)(-1) + (0.5)(0) = 0.5 + 0 = 0.5Magnitude of (-0.5,0.5): sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.7071Magnitude of (-1,0): 1Therefore, cosθ = 0.5 / (0.7071 * 1) ≈ 0.5 / 0.7071 ≈ 0.7071, so θ ≈ 45 degrees. So angle is 45 degrees again.Hmm, interesting. So even when F is at C, the angle is 45 degrees. Let&#39;s try another point.Case 3: Let me choose F closer to D. Let&#39;s say F is at (0.25, 0). So, x = 0.25.Compute point E: E is at (1, 1 - 1/x) = 1 - 1/0.25 = 1 - 4 = -3. So E is (1, -3). Then, DE is the line from D(0,0) to E(1, -3). The slope is (-3 - 0)/(1 - 0) = -3. Equation: y = -3x.Line OF: O(0.5, 0.5) to F(0.25, 0). The slope is (0 - 0.5)/(0.25 - 0.5) = (-0.5)/(-0.25) = 2. Equation: y - 0.5 = 2(x - 0.5) =&gt; y = 2x - 1 + 0.5 =&gt; y = 2x - 0.5.Find intersection M between OF (y=2x - 0.5) and DE (y=-3x).Set 2x - 0.5 = -3x =&gt; 5x = 0.5 =&gt; x = 0.1. Then, y = -3*0.1 = -0.3. Therefore, M is (0.1, -0.3).Now, compute angle OMD, which is angle at M between O, M, D.Points:O: (0.5, 0.5)M: (0.1, -0.3)D: (0,0)Vectors from M to O: (0.5 - 0.1, 0.5 - (-0.3)) = (0.4, 0.8)Vectors from M to D: (0 - 0.1, 0 - (-0.3)) = (-0.1, 0.3)Compute the angle between vectors (0.4, 0.8) and (-0.1, 0.3).Dot product: (0.4)(-0.1) + (0.8)(0.3) = -0.04 + 0.24 = 0.20Magnitude of first vector: sqrt(0.4² + 0.8²) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.64) = sqrt(0.80) ≈ 0.8944Magnitude of second vector: sqrt((-0.1)² + 0.3²) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.10) ≈ 0.3162cosθ = 0.20 / (0.8944 * 0.3162) ≈ 0.20 / 0.2828 ≈ 0.7071Which is approximately 45 degrees. So θ ≈ 45 degrees. Therefore, angle OMD is 45 degrees again.Wow, so in all these cases, angle OMD is 45 degrees. Therefore, it seems that regardless of where F is on CD, angle OMD is 45 degrees. Hence, the measure of angle OMD is 45 degrees.But wait, let me confirm with another point.Case 4: Let’s take F very close to D, say x = 0.1.Then, E is at (1, 1 - 1/0.1) = (1, 1 - 10) = (1, -9). DE is from D(0,0) to E(1, -9), slope -9. Equation: y = -9x.Line OF: O(0.5, 0.5) to F(0.1, 0). Slope: (0 - 0.5)/(0.1 - 0.5) = (-0.5)/(-0.4) = 1.25. Equation: y - 0.5 = 1.25(x - 0.5). So y = 1.25x - 0.625 + 0.5 = 1.25x - 0.125.Intersection with DE: set 1.25x - 0.125 = -9x.So 1.25x + 9x = 0.125 =&gt; 10.25x = 0.125 =&gt; x = 0.125 / 10.25 ≈ 0.0122. Then y ≈ -9*0.0122 ≈ -0.11.Point M is approximately (0.0122, -0.11).Compute vectors from M to O: (0.5 - 0.0122, 0.5 - (-0.11)) ≈ (0.4878, 0.61)Vectors from M to D: (0 - 0.0122, 0 - (-0.11)) ≈ (-0.0122, 0.11)Compute the angle between (0.4878, 0.61) and (-0.0122, 0.11).Dot product: 0.4878*(-0.0122) + 0.61*0.11 ≈ -0.006 + 0.0671 ≈ 0.0611Magnitudes:First vector: sqrt(0.4878² + 0.61²) ≈ sqrt(0.238 + 0.372) ≈ sqrt(0.610) ≈ 0.781Second vector: sqrt(0.0122² + 0.11²) ≈ sqrt(0.00015 + 0.0121) ≈ sqrt(0.01225) ≈ 0.1107cosθ ≈ 0.0611 / (0.781 * 0.1107) ≈ 0.0611 / 0.0865 ≈ 0.706Again, arccos(0.706) ≈ 45 degrees. So angle is approximately 45 degrees. Hence, even when F is very close to D, angle OMD is still 45 degrees.Therefore, it seems that regardless of the position of F on CD, angle OMD is always 45 degrees.But why is that? There must be a geometric reason behind this. Let me try to find a general proof instead of coordinate geometry.Since ABCD is a square, diagonals AC and BD intersect at O, the center. So, OA = OB = OC = OD.Let’s consider triangles involved. Maybe some similar triangles or cyclic quadrilaterals?Alternatively, considering that in coordinate geometry, regardless of x, angle OMD comes out to 45 degrees. So perhaps there&#39;s a symmetry or property that makes this angle constant.Alternatively, since DE is connected to E, which is determined by AF, and OF intersects DE at M, the configuration might always create a 45-degree angle at M.Alternatively, maybe triangle OMD is always an isosceles right triangle, leading to 45 degrees. Wait, in the first case, when F was midpoint, M was (0.5, -0.5), O was (0.5, 0.5), D was (0,0). Then, the distances: OM = sqrt(0 + 1^2) = 1, DM = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5). So, not a right triangle.Wait, but the angle was 45 degrees. Maybe using slopes. For example, in coordinate system, the slope of MO and MD can be calculated, and the tangent of the angle between them can be found to be 1, leading to 45 degrees.But in the general case:Point M is the intersection of OF extended and DE.From previous calculations, in coordinates, angle OMD comes out as 45 degrees regardless of x. Therefore, the answer should be 45 degrees.But just to confirm, let&#39;s try to see if there&#39;s a way to show that tan(angle OMD) = 1.Alternatively, since in coordinate system, with D at (0,0), M at (s, s(1 - 1/x)), O at (0.5, 0.5). Let&#39;s compute vectors MD and MO.Vector MD = D - M = (0 - s, 0 - s(1 - 1/x)) = (-s, -s(1 - 1/x))Vector MO = O - M = (0.5 - s, 0.5 - s(1 - 1/x))The angle between vectors MD and MO can be found via the dot product formula:cosθ = (MD · MO) / (|MD| |MO|)But this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a reflection or rotational symmetry.Wait, considering that in square ABCD, the diagonals are lines of symmetry. Maybe reflecting the figure over some axis would show that angle OMD is 45 degrees.Alternatively, since O is the center, and DE is a line from D to E, which is a point determined by AF. Given the square&#39;s properties, there might be congruent triangles or something that forces angle OMD to be 45 degrees.Alternatively, since the diagonals of the square are perpendicular, maybe some projection or orthogonality is involved.But honestly, given that in multiple coordinate cases, the angle comes out as 45 degrees, it&#39;s safe to conclude that angle OMD is 45 degrees regardless of F&#39;s position. Therefore, the measure of angle OMD is 45 degrees.Final Answerboxed{45^circ}&lt;/think&gt;To find the measure of angle OMD in square ABCD where diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O, and point F is on side CD such that the extension of AF intersects the extension of BC at point E, and the extension of OF intersects DE at point M:1. Coordinate System Setup:   - Assign coordinates to the square: A(0,1), B(1,1), C(1,0), D(0,0), and O(0.5,0.5).   - Let F be on CD with coordinates (x,0).2. Equations of Lines:   - Line AF has a slope of -1/x and equation y = (-1/x)x&#39; + 1.   - Point E is found by setting x&#39; = 1 in the equation of AF, giving E(1, 1 - 1/x).   - Line DE has a slope of 1 - 1/x and equation y = (1 - 1/x)x&#39;.3. Intersection of Lines:   - Line OF from O(0.5,0.5) to F(x,0) has parametric equations.   - Solving the intersection of OF extended with DE gives the coordinates of M.4. Testing Specific Cases:   - For F at midpoint (0.5,0), E is (1,-1), line DE is y = -x, and M is (0.5,-0.5). The angle angle OMD is calculated to be 45^circ.   - For F at (1,0), E is (1,-1), line DE is y=0, and M is (1,0). The angle angle OMD is again 45^circ.   - For F at (0.25,0), E is (1,-3), line DE is y = -3x, and M is (0.1,-0.3). The angle angle OMD is 45^circ.   - For F close to D, similar calculations show angle OMD is 45^circ.5. Conclusion:   - Regardless of the position of F on CD, the angle angle OMD is consistently found to be 45^circ through coordinate geometry and vector analysis.Thus, the measure of angle OMD is boxed{45^circ}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b69fb8c6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b69fb8c6><span class="icon" data-v-b69fb8c6>🔑:</span>From the given conditions, we havebegin{array}{l}A B=A D, angle A D F=angle A B E=90^{circ}, A D parallel B E Rightarrow angle D A F=angle B E A .end{array}Therefore, triangle A D F sim triangle E B A Rightarrow frac{A D}{B E}=frac{D F}{A B}Rightarrow B E cdot D F=A D cdot A B=A D^{2} text {. }Also, O D cdot B D=A D^{2}, soB E cdot D F=O D cdot B D Rightarrow frac{B E}{O D}=frac{B D}{D F} text {. }Since angle D B E=45^{circ}=angle O D F, we havetriangle D B E sim triangle F D ORightarrow angle D F O=angle B D E text {. }Thus, angle O M D=angle D F O-angle F D M=angle B D E-angle F D M=angle B D C=45^{circ} text {. }</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-e98246e0 data-v-b69fb8c6><div class="review" data-v-b69fb8c6><div class="review-title" data-v-b69fb8c6><span class="icon" data-v-b69fb8c6>❓:</span>136. How many times should a die be thrown so that the probability of the inequality|m / n-1 / 6| leqslant 0.01is not less than the probability of the opposite inequality, where m is the number of times one dot appears in n throws of a die?</div><div class="divider" data-v-b69fb8c6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b69fb8c6><span class="icon" data-v-b69fb8c6>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the question is: How many times should a die be thrown so that the probability of the inequality |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01 is not less than the probability of the opposite inequality? Here, m is the number of times one dot appears in n throws. First, let me parse this. We need to find the smallest number of die throws n such that the probability that the proportion of ones (m/n) is within 0.01 of 1/6 is at least as large as the probability that it&#39;s outside that range. So, P(|m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01) ≥ P(|m/n - 1/6| &gt; 0.01). Since probabilities sum to 1, this implies that P(|m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01) ≥ 0.5. So essentially, we need the probability that the proportion of ones is within 0.01 of the expected value 1/6 to be at least 50%.Hmm. So, this seems like a problem related to the normal approximation of the binomial distribution. Because m is the number of successes (rolling a one) in n independent trials, each with probability 1/6. So, m follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p = 1/6.For large n, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ = np and variance σ² = np(1 - p). So, the distribution of m is approximately N(μ, σ²). Then, the proportion m/n would have a normal distribution with mean p = 1/6 and variance p(1 - p)/n. So, m/n ~ N(1/6, (1/6)(5/6)/n).We need to find the smallest n such that P(|m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01) ≥ 0.5. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, this is equivalent to finding n such that the probability within 0.01 of the mean is at least 50%.In terms of the standard normal distribution, we can standardize the inequality. Let me write that out:P(-0.01 ≤ m/n - 1/6 ≤ 0.01) ≥ 0.5Multiplying through by sqrt(n)/σ, where σ = sqrt(p(1 - p)):P(-0.01 * sqrt(n)/σ ≤ Z ≤ 0.01 * sqrt(n)/σ) ≥ 0.5Here, Z is the standard normal variable. Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, the probability that Z is between -a and a is equal to 2Φ(a) - 1, where Φ(a) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.So, 2Φ(0.01 * sqrt(n)/σ) - 1 ≥ 0.5Simplifying:2Φ(0.01 * sqrt(n)/σ) - 1 ≥ 0.5Add 1 to both sides:2Φ(0.01 * sqrt(n)/σ) ≥ 1.5Divide by 2:Φ(0.01 * sqrt(n)/σ) ≥ 0.75So, we need the value of a such that Φ(a) = 0.75. Looking at standard normal tables, Φ(a) = 0.75 corresponds to a ≈ 0.6745. So, 0.01 * sqrt(n)/σ ≥ 0.6745Solving for n:sqrt(n) ≥ 0.6745 * σ / 0.01Square both sides:n ≥ (0.6745 * σ / 0.01)^2Now, σ is the standard deviation of m/n, which is sqrt(p(1 - p)/n). Wait, hold on. Wait, maybe I messed up the standard deviation here.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. The standard deviation of m, which is binomial(n, p), is sqrt(np(1 - p)). Therefore, the standard deviation of m/n is sqrt(np(1 - p))/n = sqrt(p(1 - p)/n). So, σ = sqrt(p(1 - p)/n). Wait, but in the earlier step, when standardizing, we have:Z = (m/n - p) / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)So, when we write the probability P(|m/n - p| ≤ 0.01), this is equivalent to P(|Z| ≤ 0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)) )Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.Let me write the standardization properly. If m ~ Binomial(n, p), then E[m/n] = p, Var(m/n) = p(1 - p)/n.Therefore, (m/n - p) / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) ~ N(0,1) approximately for large n.Therefore, the event |m/n - p| ≤ 0.01 is equivalent to |Z| ≤ 0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n). Which is equivalent to |Z| ≤ 0.01 * sqrt(n) / sqrt(p(1 - p)).Therefore, the probability is P(|Z| ≤ 0.01 * sqrt(n) / sqrt(p(1 - p))) ) ≥ 0.5So, similar to before, this probability is 2Φ(0.01 * sqrt(n)/sqrt(p(1 - p))) - 1 ≥ 0.5Which leads to Φ(0.01 * sqrt(n)/sqrt(p(1 - p))) ≥ 0.75So, then 0.01 * sqrt(n)/sqrt(p(1 - p)) ≥ z_{0.75}, where z_{0.75} is the 75th percentile of the standard normal distribution, which is approximately 0.6745.Therefore,sqrt(n) ≥ z_{0.75} * sqrt(p(1 - p)) / 0.01Then,n ≥ (z_{0.75} * sqrt(p(1 - p)) / 0.01)^2Plugging in p = 1/6, so p(1 - p) = (1/6)(5/6) = 5/36.Therefore,n ≥ (0.6745 * sqrt(5/36) / 0.01)^2Compute sqrt(5/36) = sqrt(5)/6 ≈ 2.236 / 6 ≈ 0.3727Therefore,0.6745 * 0.3727 ≈ 0.6745 * 0.3727 ≈ Let&#39;s compute 0.6745 * 0.3727:First, 0.6 * 0.3727 = 0.22360.07 * 0.3727 = 0.02610.0045 * 0.3727 ≈ 0.0017Adding up: 0.2236 + 0.0261 = 0.2497 + 0.0017 ≈ 0.2514So, approximately 0.2514Then divide by 0.01: 0.2514 / 0.01 = 25.14Then square that: (25.14)^2 ≈ 632.0Therefore, n should be at least approximately 632. So, n ≈ 632.But let me check the exact calculation without approximations to see if it&#39;s accurate.First, let&#39;s calculate z_{0.75}: Since Φ(0.6745) = 0.75, so z_{0.75} is 0.6745.p = 1/6, so p(1 - p) = (1/6)(5/6) = 5/36.sqrt(5/36) = sqrt(5)/6 ≈ 2.2360679775 / 6 ≈ 0.37267799625Then, z_{0.75} * sqrt(p(1 - p)) = 0.6745 * 0.37267799625 ≈ 0.6745 * 0.372678 ≈ Let&#39;s compute this more accurately.0.6745 * 0.372678:Multiply 0.6 * 0.372678 = 0.22360680.07 * 0.372678 = 0.026087460.0045 * 0.372678 = 0.001677051Adding these: 0.2236068 + 0.02608746 = 0.24969426 + 0.001677051 ≈ 0.251371311So, approximately 0.251371311Divide this by 0.01: 0.251371311 / 0.01 = 25.1371311Then square it: (25.1371311)^2 ≈ Let&#39;s compute 25^2 = 625, 0.1371311^2 ≈ 0.0188, and cross term 2*25*0.1371311 ≈ 6.856555So total ≈ 625 + 6.856555 + 0.0188 ≈ 631.875, which is approximately 631.875. So, n ≈ 632.Therefore, using the normal approximation, n should be at least 632. But since we&#39;re dealing with a discrete distribution (binomial) and using a continuous approximation (normal), maybe we need to adjust with a continuity correction. Wait, but the problem is phrased in terms of |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01, which is a continuous interval. But m/n is discrete because m is an integer between 0 and n. However, for large n, m/n is approximately continuous, so maybe the continuity correction is negligible here, or perhaps not necessary because the problem is stated in terms of the probability of the inequality, which would include all m such that m/n is within 0.01 of 1/6. Since m must be an integer, the exact probability would involve summing over all integers m where |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01. But for large n, the normal approximation should be reasonable.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using the Central Limit Theorem directly with the normal approximation, so the answer is approximately 632. However, since n must be an integer, we would round up to 632. But let me check again.Wait, actually, let&#39;s recast the problem. The user is asking for the number of throws n such that the probability of being within 0.01 is at least as large as the probability of being outside. That is, the probability inside is &gt;= 0.5. So, using the normal approximation, we found that n ≈ 632. But perhaps we need to verify this.Alternatively, maybe we can use the De Moivre-Laplace theorem, which is the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, and that would give the same result as above.But let me consider whether there&#39;s another approach. For example, using Chebyshev&#39;s inequality. However, Chebyshev&#39;s inequality gives a bound on the probability, but it&#39;s usually not tight. Since the problem is asking for the probability to be at least 0.5, Chebyshev might not be helpful here because it gives a lower bound on the probability in terms of the variance. But let&#39;s see.Chebyshev&#39;s inequality states that P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². But we want P(|m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01) ≥ 0.5. So, inverting Chebyshev, 1 - P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≥ 0.5 implies that P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 0.5. Then, by Chebyshev, 1/k² ≤ 0.5, so k ≥ sqrt(2). But then, 0.01 = kσ, so σ = 0.01 / k. But σ here is sqrt(p(1 - p)/n). So,sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) = 0.01 / kBut since k ≥ sqrt(2), we get sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) ≤ 0.01 / sqrt(2)So,sqrt(n) ≥ sqrt(p(1 - p)) * sqrt(2) / 0.01Then,n ≥ (sqrt(p(1 - p)) * sqrt(2) / 0.01)^2 = (2 * p(1 - p)) / (0.01)^2Plugging in p = 1/6,n ≥ (2 * (1/6)(5/6)) / 0.0001 = (2 * 5/36) / 0.0001 = (10/36) / 0.0001 = (5/18) / 0.0001 ≈ (0.277777...) / 0.0001 ≈ 2777.777...So, n ≥ 2778. But this is way larger than the previous estimate. This is because Chebyshev&#39;s inequality is a very conservative bound and gives a much higher n. Since the problem is likely expecting the normal approximation, which gives a more realistic estimate, the answer is probably 632. However, since the problem says &quot;probability is not less than the probability of the opposite inequality&quot;, which is exactly 0.5, but in reality, since the normal distribution is continuous, maybe we need to adjust.Wait, actually, when using the normal approximation, we might need to consider the continuity correction. For a binomial distribution approximated by a normal, the continuity correction adjusts for the fact that we&#39;re approximating a discrete variable with a continuous one. However, in this case, the event |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01 is equivalent to |m - n/6| ≤ 0.01n. Since m must be an integer, the exact event would be m in [n/6 - 0.01n, n/6 + 0.01n]. But since 0.01n might not be an integer, perhaps we need to consider the interval from ceil(n/6 - 0.01n) to floor(n/6 + 0.01n). However, for large n, the continuity correction would be negligible, as 0.01n is a large number, and the correction of 0.5 in m would translate to a correction of 0.5/n in m/n, which is small for large n. Therefore, maybe the continuity correction is not necessary here.Alternatively, if we do apply the continuity correction, how would that affect the calculation?The continuity correction adjusts the boundary by 0.5. So, the event m ≥ k becomes m ≥ k - 0.5, and m ≤ k becomes m ≤ k + 0.5. In this case, the original event is |m - n/6| ≤ 0.01n. So, m is between n/6 - 0.01n and n/6 + 0.01n. Applying continuity correction, we would instead consider the probability that m is between n/6 - 0.01n - 0.5 and n/6 + 0.01n + 0.5. Then, converting to m/n, that becomes [n/6 - 0.01n - 0.5]/n to [n/6 + 0.01n + 0.5]/n, which is [1/6 - 0.01 - 0.5/n] to [1/6 + 0.01 + 0.5/n]. So, the interval is widened by 0.5/n on each side. Therefore, if we use the continuity correction, the boundaries become 0.01 ± 0.5/n. For large n, 0.5/n is negligible compared to 0.01, especially when n is in the hundreds. For example, if n = 600, 0.5/n ≈ 0.00083, which is much smaller than 0.01. Therefore, the continuity correction might not significantly affect the result here. So, perhaps it&#39;s safe to proceed without it.Therefore, sticking with the original calculation, n ≈ 632. However, since n must be an integer, we would round up to 632. But let&#39;s check with exact value.Wait, the value we calculated was approximately 631.875, so we need to round up to 632. Therefore, n = 632.But to confirm, let&#39;s plug n = 632 back into the equation and check.Compute z = 0.01 * sqrt(n) / sqrt(p(1 - p))p = 1/6, p(1 - p) = 5/36 ≈ 0.138888...sqrt(n) = sqrt(632) ≈ 25.14Then, z = 0.01 * 25.14 / sqrt(5/36) ≈ 0.01 * 25.14 / (sqrt(5)/6) ≈ 0.01 * 25.14 * 6 / sqrt(5) ≈ 0.01 * 150.84 / 2.236 ≈ 1.5084 / 2.236 ≈ 0.674Which is exactly the z-score we started with (0.6745). Therefore, when n = 632, the z-score is approximately 0.6745, which corresponds to the 75th percentile. Therefore, the probability is 0.5. But we need the probability to be at least 0.5, so n should be at least 632. Hence, the minimal n is 632.But wait, if n=632 gives z=0.6745, then Φ(z)=0.75, so the probability is 2*0.75 -1 = 0.5. Therefore, exactly 0.5. But the problem states that the probability should be not less than the probability of the opposite inequality, which is 0.5. So, equality is allowed. Therefore, n=632 is the minimal n where the probability is at least 0.5. However, we need to check if at n=632, the exact probability using the binomial distribution is actually 0.5 or more.But the problem is that the normal approximation is continuous, while the binomial is discrete. So, in reality, the exact probability might be slightly different. However, given that the question is likely expecting an answer based on the normal approximation, and given that the calculation gives n=632, that&#39;s probably the answer expected here.Alternatively, perhaps we can check with n=631.Compute z for n=631: sqrt(631) ≈ 25.12Then z = 0.01 * 25.12 / sqrt(5/36) ≈ same as before: 0.01 * 25.12 * 6 / sqrt(5) ≈ 1.5072 / 2.236 ≈ 0.673. So, z ≈ 0.673. The corresponding Φ(z) is slightly less than 0.75, maybe 0.7495, which would give a probability of 2*0.7495 -1 = 0.499, which is less than 0.5. Therefore, n=631 would give a probability less than 0.5, and n=632 gives exactly 0.5 (in the approximation). Therefore, the minimal n is 632.Hence, the answer is boxed{632}.Final AnswerThe die should be thrown boxed{632} times.&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many times a die should be thrown so that the probability of the inequality ( |m/n - 1/6| leq 0.01 ) is not less than the probability of the opposite inequality, we use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Here, ( m ) is the number of times one dot appears in ( n ) throws, following a binomial distribution with parameters ( n ) and ( p = 1/6 ).1. Normal Approximation: For large ( n ), the distribution of ( m/n ) can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean ( mu = 1/6 ) and variance ( sigma^2 = frac{p(1 - p)}{n} = frac{5}{36n} ).2. Standardization: We need to find ( n ) such that ( P(|m/n - 1/6| leq 0.01) geq 0.5 ). This translates to finding ( n ) such that the probability within 0.01 of the mean is at least 50%.3. Z-Score Calculation: Using the standard normal distribution, we convert the inequality:   [   Pleft(left| frac{m/n - 1/6}{sqrt{5/(36n)}} right| leq frac{0.01}{sqrt{5/(36n)}} right) geq 0.5   ]   This simplifies to finding ( z ) such that:   [   2Phi(z) - 1 geq 0.5 implies Phi(z) geq 0.75   ]   where ( z = frac{0.01 sqrt{n}}{sqrt{5/36}} ).4. Finding ( z ): The 75th percentile of the standard normal distribution is ( z approx 0.6745 ). Setting ( z = 0.6745 ):   [   frac{0.01 sqrt{n}}{sqrt{5/36}} geq 0.6745   ]   Solving for ( n ):   [   sqrt{n} geq frac{0.6745 sqrt{5/36}}{0.01} implies sqrt{n} geq 25.1371 implies n geq (25.1371)^2 approx 632   ]5. Verification: Checking ( n = 632 ) confirms the calculation. The exact probability using the normal approximation gives a z-score corresponding to the 75th percentile, ensuring the probability is at least 0.5.Thus, the die should be thrown (boxed{632}) times.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many times a die should be thrown so that the probability of the inequality |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01 is at least as large as the probability of the opposite inequality. Here, m is the number of times we roll a one in n throws. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.First, let me restate the problem in my own words. We&#39;re dealing with a fair six-sided die, right? Since the probability of rolling a one is 1/6. We need to determine the number of throws n such that the probability that the proportion of ones (m/n) is within 0.01 of the true probability 1/6 is at least 50%. Because the problem says the probability of the inequality should be not less than the probability of the opposite, which basically means P(|m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01) ≥ 0.5.So we&#39;re looking for the smallest n where the probability that the proportion is within 1% of 1/6 is at least 50%. This seems related to confidence intervals in statistics, maybe? But since it&#39;s a probability about the proportion, perhaps using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Let me recall that.The number of ones, m, in n throws follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p = 1/6. The mean number of ones is np = n/6, and the variance is np(1 - p) = n*(1/6)*(5/6) = 5n/36. The standard deviation is sqrt(5n/36). We can approximate the binomial distribution with a normal distribution when n is large, which I think it will be here because we&#39;re dealing with probabilities around a small interval. So, m ~ N(np, np(1 - p)) approximately.But we are looking at the proportion m/n, which would have mean p = 1/6 and variance p(1 - p)/n, so standard deviation sqrt(p(1 - p)/n). Therefore, the proportion m/n is approximately N(p, p(1 - p)/n).The inequality |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01 can be rewritten as -0.01 ≤ m/n - 1/6 ≤ 0.01. To find the probability of this, we can standardize the variable.Let me define Z = (m/n - p) / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n). Then, the probability becomes P(-0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) ≤ Z ≤ 0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)). Since Z is approximately standard normal, this probability is approximately Φ(0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)) - Φ(-0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)), where Φ is the standard normal CDF.But since the normal distribution is symmetric, Φ(a) - Φ(-a) = 2Φ(a) - 1. Therefore, the probability is 2Φ(0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)) - 1. We need this to be at least 0.5. So:2Φ(0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)) - 1 ≥ 0.5Adding 1 to both sides:2Φ(0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)) ≥ 1.5Dividing by 2:Φ(0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n)) ≥ 0.75Now, Φ(z) = 0.75 corresponds to z ≈ 0.6745 (from standard normal tables). So:0.01 / sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) ≥ 0.6745Solving for n:sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) ≤ 0.01 / 0.6745Square both sides:p(1 - p)/n ≤ (0.01 / 0.6745)^2Then, n ≥ p(1 - p) / (0.01 / 0.6745)^2Plugging in p = 1/6:n ≥ (1/6)(5/6) / (0.01^2 / 0.6745^2)Compute the numerator: (1/6)(5/6) = 5/36 ≈ 0.1389Denominator: (0.01^2 / 0.6745^2) ≈ (0.0001) / 0.4549 ≈ 0.0002198So n ≥ 0.1389 / 0.0002198 ≈ 632.0Wait, that gives n ≥ approximately 632. But is this correct?Hold on, let&#39;s check the calculation step by step.First, solving for sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) ≤ 0.01 / 0.6745.So sqrt(p(1 - p)/n) ≤ 0.01 / 0.6745 ≈ 0.01482Then squaring both sides:p(1 - p)/n ≤ (0.01482)^2 ≈ 0.0002196Therefore, n ≥ p(1 - p)/0.0002196 ≈ (5/36)/0.0002196 ≈ 0.138888... / 0.0002196 ≈ 632.0Yes, that seems consistent. So according to the normal approximation, n should be at least 632. But wait, the problem says &quot;the probability of the inequality is not less than the probability of the opposite inequality&quot;, which is equivalent to P(|m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01) ≥ 0.5. So using the normal approximation, we found that n ≈ 632. But the question is, is this the exact answer or do we need to adjust for continuity?Ah, right, since we&#39;re approximating a discrete distribution (binomial) with a continuous one (normal), we should apply the continuity correction. For a binomial variable, the probability P(m ≤ k) is approximated by P(Z ≤ (k + 0.5 - np)/sqrt(np(1 - p))). Similarly, for P(m ≥ k), we use (k - 0.5 - np)/sqrt(np(1 - p)).In our case, we&#39;re looking at |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01, which translates to:-0.01 ≤ m/n - 1/6 ≤ 0.01Multiplying by n:-0.01n ≤ m - n/6 ≤ 0.01nSo:n/6 - 0.01n ≤ m ≤ n/6 + 0.01nTherefore, m is between n(1/6 - 0.01) and n(1/6 + 0.01). Since m must be an integer, the actual probability is the sum of binomial probabilities from m = floor(n(1/6 - 0.01) + 1) to m = ceil(n(1/6 + 0.01) - 1). But when using the normal approximation, we can adjust the bounds by 0.5 to approximate the discrete variable.Therefore, the continuity correction would adjust the bounds by 0.5. So the corrected Z-scores would be:Lower bound: (n(1/6 - 0.01) - 0.5 - n/6)/sqrt(n*(1/6)*(5/6)) = (-0.01n - 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)Upper bound: (n(1/6 + 0.01) + 0.5 - n/6)/sqrt(5n/36) = (0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)Therefore, the probability becomes Φ((0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) - Φ((-0.01n - 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)).But since the normal distribution is symmetric, this is equal to Φ((0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) - Φ(- (0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) = 2Φ((0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) - 1.We need this probability to be at least 0.5, so:2Φ((0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) - 1 ≥ 0.5Which simplifies to:Φ((0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) ≥ 0.75Again, Φ(z) = 0.75 corresponds to z ≈ 0.6745. Therefore, we set:(0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36) ≥ 0.6745Let me compute this expression:First, sqrt(5n/36) = sqrt(5n)/6Therefore, the left side becomes:(0.01n + 0.5) / (sqrt(5n)/6) = 6(0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n)Multiply numerator and denominator:= (0.06n + 3)/sqrt(5n)Set this greater than or equal to 0.6745:(0.06n + 3)/sqrt(5n) ≥ 0.6745This seems a bit more complicated. Let me write it as:0.06n + 3 ≥ 0.6745 * sqrt(5n)Compute sqrt(5n) as sqrt(5)*sqrt(n) ≈ 2.23607*sqrt(n)Thus:0.06n + 3 ≥ 0.6745 * 2.23607 * sqrt(n)Calculate 0.6745 * 2.23607 ≈ 0.6745 * 2.236 ≈ 1.509So:0.06n + 3 ≥ 1.509 sqrt(n)Let me rearrange this inequality:0.06n - 1.509 sqrt(n) + 3 ≥ 0This is a quadratic in terms of sqrt(n). Let me set x = sqrt(n), so n = x^2.Then the inequality becomes:0.06x^2 - 1.509x + 3 ≥ 0Multiply through by 1000 to eliminate decimals:60x^2 - 1509x + 3000 ≥ 0Now, solve 60x^2 - 1509x + 3000 = 0Use quadratic formula:x = [1509 ± sqrt(1509^2 - 4*60*3000)] / (2*60)Compute discriminant:D = 1509^2 - 4*60*3000Calculate 1509^2:1500^2 = 2,250,0002*1500*9 = 27,0009^2 = 81So 1509^2 = 2,250,000 + 27,000 + 81 = 2,277,0814*60*3000 = 720,000Thus, D = 2,277,081 - 720,000 = 1,557,081sqrt(1,557,081). Let&#39;s see:1248^2 = 1,557,504 (since 1200^2 = 1,440,000, 50^2=2500, so 1250^2=1,562,500). So 1248^2 = (1250 - 2)^2 = 1,562,500 - 4*1250 + 4 = 1,562,500 - 5,000 + 4 = 1,557,504So sqrt(1,557,081) is a bit less than 1248. Let me compute 1248^2 = 1,557,504 as above. So D = 1,557,081 is 1,557,504 - 423. Therefore, sqrt(D) ≈ 1248 - 423/(2*1248) ≈ 1248 - 0.169 ≈ 1247.831So x = [1509 ± 1247.831]/120Compute both roots:x1 = (1509 + 1247.831)/120 ≈ (2756.831)/120 ≈ 22.9736x2 = (1509 - 1247.831)/120 ≈ (261.169)/120 ≈ 2.1764So the quadratic is positive when x ≤ 2.1764 or x ≥ 22.9736. But since x = sqrt(n) must be positive and n is a large number (since we are looking for a reasonably high n to satisfy the probability), we take x ≥ 22.9736. Therefore, sqrt(n) ≥ 22.9736, so n ≥ (22.9736)^2 ≈ 22.9736*22.9736.Compute 22^2 = 48422*0.9736*2 = 22*1.9472 ≈ 42.83840.9736^2 ≈ 0.9479So total ≈ 484 + 42.8384 + 0.9479 ≈ 527.7863So n ≈ 527.79. But since n must be an integer, we round up to 528. But wait, this seems conflicting with the previous result of 632. But this is considering the continuity correction.But here&#39;s the thing: when we applied the continuity correction, the required n decreased? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, perhaps because the continuity correction adjusts the bounds, maybe making the interval slightly larger, so requiring a smaller n? Wait, let&#39;s think.Without continuity correction, we had n ≈ 632. With continuity correction, we get n ≈ 528. That seems like a big difference. But maybe my continuity correction was applied incorrectly?Wait, let me verify the continuity correction step. The original inequality is m/n within 0.01 of 1/6, which translates to m within n/6 ± 0.01n. Since m must be an integer, the actual bounds are from floor(n/6 - 0.01n + 1) to ceil(n/6 + 0.01n - 1). When approximating with the normal distribution, the continuity correction would adjust the bounds by 0.5 in the m scale. Therefore, in terms of m:Lower bound: m ≥ n/6 - 0.01n - 0.5Upper bound: m ≤ n/6 + 0.01n + 0.5But when converting back to m/n, this would be:m/n ≥ 1/6 - 0.01 - 0.5/nm/n ≤ 1/6 + 0.01 + 0.5/nTherefore, the corrected interval for m/n is [1/6 - 0.01 - 0.5/n, 1/6 + 0.01 + 0.5/n]. So the width of the interval is increased by 1/n. For large n, this is a small correction, but maybe not negligible.However, in the previous calculation, when we used the continuity correction in terms of m, we adjusted the bounds by 0.5, leading to the expression (0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36) in the Z-score. So perhaps the continuity correction does have a non-negligible effect here, especially for moderate n.But let&#39;s check if n=528 gives the correct probability.Wait, perhaps instead of approximating with the normal distribution, we can compute the exact probability using the binomial distribution. But for n=500 or 600, calculating exact binomial probabilities is computationally intensive. However, maybe we can use the De Moivre-Laplace theorem, which is the basis for the normal approximation, and it includes the continuity correction.Alternatively, maybe the answer is expecting the normal approximation without continuity correction, so 632. But given that the problem is about probability being at least 0.5, and when using the continuity correction, we get a lower n. Since the problem is asking for the minimal n where the probability is not less than 0.5, maybe 528 is the answer? But I need to verify which one is more accurate.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute the required n both with and without continuity correction and see.First, without continuity correction:We had n ≈ 632.With continuity correction, n ≈ 528.But which one is correct? To check, perhaps plugging in n=528 and n=632 into the original inequality and see which one gives a probability of at least 0.5.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 2278. Wait, but that seems too high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.Wait, let&#39;s go back to the original equation with continuity correction:(0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36) ≥ 0.6745Let me compute this again step by step.First, sqrt(5n/36) is equal to sqrt(5n)/6 ≈ (2.23607*sqrt(n))/6 ≈ 0.372678*sqrt(n).Therefore, the left-hand side becomes:(0.01n + 0.5)/0.372678*sqrt(n) ≈ (0.01n + 0.5)/(0.372678*sqrt(n)).Let me write this as:(0.01n + 0.5) / (0.372678*sqrt(n)) = (0.01n)/(0.372678*sqrt(n)) + 0.5/(0.372678*sqrt(n)).Simplify each term:First term: 0.01n / (0.372678*sqrt(n)) = 0.01 / 0.372678 * sqrt(n) ≈ 0.02683 * sqrt(n)Second term: 0.5 / (0.372678*sqrt(n)) ≈ 1.3416 / sqrt(n)Therefore, the entire expression is approximately 0.02683*sqrt(n) + 1.3416/sqrt(n)Set this greater than or equal to 0.6745:0.02683*sqrt(n) + 1.3416/sqrt(n) ≥ 0.6745Let me multiply both sides by sqrt(n):0.02683*n + 1.3416 ≥ 0.6745*sqrt(n)Rearrange:0.02683n - 0.6745*sqrt(n) + 1.3416 ≥ 0Again, this is a quadratic in sqrt(n). Let x = sqrt(n):0.02683x^2 - 0.6745x + 1.3416 ≥ 0Multiply through by, say, 10000 to eliminate decimals:268.3x^2 - 6745x + 13416 ≥ 0But solving this quadratic equation:268.3x^2 - 6745x + 13416 = 0Use quadratic formula:x = [6745 ± sqrt(6745^2 - 4*268.3*13416)] / (2*268.3)This is complicated. Maybe approximate.Alternatively, let&#39;s write it as:0.02683x^2 - 0.6745x + 1.3416 = 0Multiply through by 1000:26.83x² - 674.5x + 1341.6 = 0Compute discriminant D:D = (674.5)^2 - 4*26.83*1341.6Calculate 674.5^2:674^2 = (600 + 74)^2 = 600^2 + 2*600*74 + 74^2 = 360,000 + 88,800 + 5,476 = 454,2760.5^2 = 0.25, and cross term 2*674*0.5=674So 674.5^2 ≈ 454,276 + 674 + 0.25 ≈ 454,950.25Now, compute 4*26.83*1341.6:First, 4*26.83 = 107.32107.32*1341.6 ≈ 107.32*1300 + 107.32*41.6 ≈ 139,516 + 4,462.112 ≈ 143,978.112So D ≈ 454,950.25 - 143,978.112 ≈ 310,972.138sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(310,972.138) ≈ 557.8Therefore, x ≈ [674.5 ± 557.8] / (2*26.83) ≈ [674.5 ± 557.8]/53.66Compute both roots:x1 = (674.5 + 557.8)/53.66 ≈ 1232.3/53.66 ≈ 22.96x2 = (674.5 - 557.8)/53.66 ≈ 116.7/53.66 ≈ 2.174Therefore, the quadratic is positive when x ≤ 2.174 or x ≥ 22.96. Since x is sqrt(n) and n is large, we take x ≥ 22.96, so n ≥ (22.96)^2 ≈ 527.3. So n ≈ 528.Which matches the previous result. Therefore, with continuity correction, we get n ≈ 528.But is this accurate? Let me check n=528.Compute the lower and upper bounds:Lower bound: n(1/6 - 0.01) = 528*(1/6 - 0.01) = 528*(0.166666... - 0.01) = 528*0.156666... ≈ 528*0.156666 ≈ 528*(0.15 + 0.006666) ≈ 528*0.15 + 528*0.006666 ≈ 79.2 + 3.52 ≈ 82.72Upper bound: n(1/6 + 0.01) = 528*(0.166666... + 0.01) = 528*0.176666... ≈ 528*0.176666 ≈ 528*(0.1 + 0.07 + 0.006666) ≈ 52.8 + 36.96 + 3.52 ≈ 93.28So m must be between 82.72 and 93.28. Since m is integer, from 83 to 93 inclusive.So the probability is P(83 ≤ m ≤ 93). Let&#39;s compute this using the normal approximation with continuity correction.First, compute mean and variance:Mean μ = n*p = 528*(1/6) = 88Variance σ² = n*p*(1 - p) = 528*(1/6)*(5/6) = 528*(5/36) = 528/36*5 = 14.666...*5 ≈ 73.333...σ ≈ sqrt(73.333) ≈ 8.565Continuity correction: P(83 ≤ m ≤ 93) becomes P(82.5 ≤ m ≤ 93.5) in the normal approximation.Compute Z-scores:Z_lower = (82.5 - 88)/8.565 ≈ (-5.5)/8.565 ≈ -0.642Z_upper = (93.5 - 88)/8.565 ≈ 5.5/8.565 ≈ 0.642The probability is Φ(0.642) - Φ(-0.642) = 2Φ(0.642) - 1 ≈ 2*0.7394 - 1 ≈ 0.4788. Wait, that&#39;s only about 47.88%, which is less than 50%. That contradicts our previous result.Wait, so if n=528, the approximate probability is only ~47.88%, which is less than 0.5. So that can&#39;t be. Therefore, the continuity correction method gives n≈528 but actual probability is lower. Hmm, so what&#39;s going on here?Alternatively, maybe the continuity correction was applied in the wrong direction? Let&#39;s think.Wait, the original inequality is |m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01. So m is within [n/6 - 0.01n, n/6 + 0.01n]. When converting to the normal approximation with continuity correction, since m is discrete, the continuity correction would expand the interval by 0.5 in either direction. Wait, actually, when approximating P(a ≤ X ≤ b) for integer X, we use P(a - 0.5 ≤ X ≤ b + 0.5). Wait, no. Wait, if you have a discrete variable, the continuity correction depends on the direction of the inequality. For P(X ≤ k), it&#39;s approximated by P(Z ≤ (k + 0.5 - μ)/σ). Similarly, P(X ≥ k) is approximated by P(Z ≥ (k - 0.5 - μ)/σ). Therefore, for P(a ≤ X ≤ b), it&#39;s P(a - 0.5 ≤ X ≤ b + 0.5). Wait, no. Wait, if X is integer, then P(X ≤ b) ≈ P(Z ≤ (b + 0.5 - μ)/σ). Similarly, P(X ≥ a) ≈ P(Z ≥ (a - 0.5 - μ)/σ). Therefore, P(a ≤ X ≤ b) ≈ P((a - 0.5 - μ)/σ ≤ Z ≤ (b + 0.5 - μ)/σ). Therefore, in our case, the interval [83, 93] would be approximated by [82.5, 93.5].But in the previous calculation, we found that the probability was approximately 47.88%, which is less than 50%. That suggests that n=528 is insufficient. Then maybe our initial calculation with continuity correction is not accurate?Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the normal approximation without continuity correction. Let&#39;s check that.Without continuity correction, the Z-scores would be:Z_lower = (83 - 88)/8.565 ≈ -5/8.565 ≈ -0.584Z_upper = (93 - 88)/8.565 ≈ 5/8.565 ≈ 0.584Probability is Φ(0.584) - Φ(-0.584) = 2Φ(0.584) - 1 ≈ 2*0.7190 - 1 ≈ 0.438. Wait, that&#39;s even lower. So that can&#39;t be.Wait, this is confusing. If the approximate probability is lower than 0.5, but we required it to be at least 0.5, perhaps n=528 is insufficient. Then why did our quadratic equation give n≈528?Wait, maybe my approach was flawed. Let me think differently. When we set up the equation with continuity correction:(0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36) = 0.6745We need to solve for n. Let me rearrange this equation:Multiply both sides by sqrt(5n/36):0.01n + 0.5 = 0.6745 * sqrt(5n/36)Square both sides to eliminate the square root:(0.01n + 0.5)^2 = (0.6745)^2 * (5n/36)Expand the left side:(0.01n)^2 + 2*0.01n*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 0.6745^2 * (5n/36)Which simplifies to:0.0001n² + 0.01n + 0.25 = (0.4549)*(5n)/36Compute the right side:0.4549*5 = 2.27452.2745/36 ≈ 0.06318Therefore, the equation becomes:0.0001n² + 0.01n + 0.25 = 0.06318nBring all terms to the left:0.0001n² + 0.01n + 0.25 - 0.06318n = 0Combine like terms:0.0001n² - 0.05318n + 0.25 = 0Multiply through by 10000 to eliminate decimals:1n² - 531.8n + 2500 = 0So quadratic equation:n² - 531.8n + 2500 = 0Solutions:n = [531.8 ± sqrt(531.8² - 4*1*2500)] / 2Compute discriminant:531.8² ≈ (530)^2 + 2*530*1.8 + 1.8² = 280,900 + 1,908 + 3.24 = 282,811.244*1*2500 = 10,000Thus, discriminant ≈ 282,811.24 - 10,000 = 272,811.24sqrt(272,811.24) ≈ 522.31Therefore, n ≈ [531.8 ± 522.31]/2Compute both roots:n1 = (531.8 + 522.31)/2 ≈ 1054.11/2 ≈ 527.05n2 = (531.8 - 522.31)/2 ≈ 9.49/2 ≈ 4.745We discard the smaller root, so n ≈ 527.05, so n=528.But earlier, when we checked n=528, the approximate probability was only ~47.88%, which is less than 50%. So why is there a discrepancy?Ah, because when we square both sides of the equation, we might introduce extraneous solutions. Therefore, even though mathematically solving the squared equation gives n≈528, the actual approximate probability might not satisfy the original inequality. Therefore, perhaps the normal approximation isn&#39;t accurate here, and we need a different approach.Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using Chebyshev&#39;s inequality? Let&#39;s try that.Chebyshev&#39;s inequality states that for any random variable with finite mean μ and variance σ², the probability that |X - μ| ≥ kσ is ≤ 1/k². However, Chebyshev is a loose bound and usually gives much higher n than necessary.But in our case, we need P(|m/n - 1/6| ≤ 0.01) ≥ 0.5. Let&#39;s see.Chebyshev&#39;s inequality for the sample mean:P(|m/n - p| ≥ ε) ≤ σ²/(nε²)Where σ² = p(1 - p). So here, p=1/6, ε=0.01.Therefore:P(|m/n - 1/6| ≥ 0.01) ≤ (1/6)(5/6)/(n*(0.01)^2) = (5/36)/(0.0001n) = 5/(36*0.0001n) ≈ 5/(0.0036n) ≈ 1388.89/nWe want this probability to be ≤ 0.5. Therefore:1388.89/n ≤ 0.5 → n ≥ 1388.89 / 0.5 ≈ 2777.78So n ≥ 2778. But this is a very conservative estimate. The actual n required is likely much lower, as we saw with the normal approximation.But the problem states that the probability of the inequality should be not less than the probability of the opposite, i.e., P(A) ≥ P(not A), which implies P(A) ≥ 0.5. So using Chebyshev, we need n ≥ 2778, but as we saw with the normal approximation, n≈632 gives P(A)≈50% (without continuity correction), but when checked with continuity correction, it&#39;s lower. But since Chebyshev is an upper bound, it&#39;s not helpful here.Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer requires solving for n using the binomial distribution. But this would be complex as it involves summing binomial coefficients. However, given the options between 528 and 632, and my approximate calculation with continuity correction giving 528 but actual probability ~47.88%, which is close to 50%, maybe the correct answer is 528? Or perhaps 632?Alternatively, perhaps using the Central Limit Theorem with continuity correction, but our calculation gives n≈528, but the check shows that at n=528, the probability is approximately 47.88%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, we need a higher n.Alternatively, perhaps solve for n such that:Φ((0.01n + 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) - Φ((-0.01n - 0.5)/sqrt(5n/36)) = 0.5But this requires trial and error or iterative methods.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the initial approach without continuity correction:We had n ≈ 632. Let&#39;s check n=632.Compute μ = 632/6 ≈ 105.333σ = sqrt(632*(1/6)*(5/6)) = sqrt(632*5/36) ≈ sqrt(87.777) ≈ 9.37The interval for m is 1/6 ± 0.01, so 632*(1/6 ± 0.01) ≈ 105.333 ± 6.32 → [99.013, 111.653]. So m is between 99.013 and 111.653, i.e., m=100 to 111.Using the normal approximation without continuity correction:Z_lower = (99.013 - 105.333)/9.37 ≈ (-6.32)/9.37 ≈ -0.675Z_upper = (111.653 - 105.333)/9.37 ≈ 6.32/9.37 ≈ 0.675Probability ≈ Φ(0.675) - Φ(-0.675) ≈ 2Φ(0.675) - 1 ≈ 2*0.7502 - 1 ≈ 0.5004. So about 50.04%. So with n=632, the approximate probability is just over 50%. Therefore, n=632 is the minimal n according to the normal approximation without continuity correction.But when we checked n=528 with continuity correction, the approximate probability was ~47.88%, which is close to 50% but not quite. However, since continuity correction is supposed to give a better approximation, perhaps the true probability at n=528 is actually higher than 47.88%?Alternatively, perhaps the discrepancy arises because the normal approximation isn&#39;t very accurate for such probabilities. Maybe we need to use a finer approximation or exact computation.Alternatively, the problem might accept the normal approximation answer, which is 632. The answer expected is likely 632. However, given that with continuity correction, the answer is lower, but when checked, it&#39;s insufficient. Therefore, maybe the answer is 632.Alternatively, perhaps the original question, since it&#39;s from a problem set or textbook, expects the answer without continuity correction. Let&#39;s see.In many probability problems, especially in introductory courses, the continuity correction is sometimes omitted for simplicity, even though it&#39;s less accurate. Therefore, the answer might expect 632.Alternatively, let&#39;s check with n=633.Using the same calculation:Z = (0.01*633)/sqrt(5*633/36) = 6.33/sqrt(5*633/36)Compute sqrt(5*633/36) = sqrt(3165/36) = sqrt(87.9167) ≈ 9.376So Z ≈ 6.33/9.376 ≈ 0.675Φ(0.675) ≈ 0.7502, so probability ≈ 2*0.7502 -1 = 0.5004, which is just over 50%. Therefore, n=633 gives approximately 50.04% probability.Therefore, rounding up, n=633. But 633 isn&#39;t divisible by 6. But maybe the answer is 632 or 633.However, given that the problem says &quot;how many times should a die be thrown so that the probability... is not less than the probability of the opposite inequality&quot;, which is equivalent to P(A) ≥ 0.5. So the minimal n where P(A) ≥ 0.5.If at n=632, the approximate probability is 50.04%, then n=632 is sufficient. But wait, when we calculated without continuity correction for n=632, we get Z=0.675, leading to probability≈50.04%. Therefore, n=632 is the answer.But the problem is in Chinese maybe? The original problem number is 136. Anyway, the key is that according to the normal approximation without continuity correction, n=632 is the answer.But why does the continuity correction give a different result? Because when we applied continuity correction, the required n decreased, but when checked, the probability was lower. Therefore, perhaps the continuity correction isn&#39;t the right approach here, or maybe the problem expects the answer without continuity correction.Alternatively, maybe the answer is 2278, but I don&#39;t see how. Wait, if we use the other approach where we set 0.01 = z*sqrt(p(1-p)/n), solving for n gives n = (z^2 * p(1 - p))/0.01^2. For z=0.6745, n=(0.6745^2 * 1/6 *5/6)/0.0001 ≈ (0.4549 * 5/36)/0.0001 ≈ (0.06318)/0.0001 ≈ 631.8, which is 632.Yes, that&#39;s the same as before. So this seems consistent.Therefore, I think the answer is 632, and the continuity correction approach was conflicting due to the approximation errors when checking with n=528. Since the problem is likely expecting the normal approximation without continuity correction, the answer is 632.Final AnswerThe die should be thrown boxed{632} times.&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many times a die should be thrown so that the probability of the inequality ( |m / n - 1 / 6| leqslant 0.01 ) is at least 50%, we use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Here, ( m ) is the number of times one dot appears in ( n ) throws, following a binomial distribution with parameters ( n ) and ( p = 1/6 ).1. Normal Approximation:   - The proportion ( m/n ) has mean ( mu = 1/6 ) and variance ( sigma^2 = frac{p(1-p)}{n} = frac{5}{36n} ).   - The standard deviation is ( sqrt{frac{5}{36n}} ).2. Z-score Calculation:   - The inequality ( |m/n - 1/6| leq 0.01 ) translates to ( Z = frac{0.01}{sqrt{frac{5}{36n}}} ).   - We need ( P(|Z| leq 0.01 / sqrt{frac{5}{36n}}) geq 0.5 ).3. Standard Normal Distribution:   - For the probability to be at least 50%, the Z-score must correspond to the 75th percentile of the standard normal distribution, which is approximately 0.6745.   - Setting ( frac{0.01}{sqrt{frac{5}{36n}}} geq 0.6745 ).4. Solving for ( n ):   - Rearrange the inequality: ( sqrt{frac{5}{36n}} leq frac{0.01}{0.6745} ).   - Squaring both sides: ( frac{5}{36n} leq left( frac{0.01}{0.6745} right)^2 ).   - Solving for ( n ): ( n geq frac{5}{36} left( frac{0.6745}{0.01} right)^2 ).5. Calculations:   - Compute ( left( frac{0.6745}{0.01} right)^2 approx 4549 ).   - ( n geq frac{5}{36} times 4549 approx 632 ).Thus, the die should be thrown (boxed{632}) times.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b69fb8c6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b69fb8c6><span class="icon" data-v-b69fb8c6>🔑:</span>Solution.

So, we have a square ABCD with side length 1. Points M, N, O, P are on the sides AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. The conditions given are that AM equals BM, meaning M is the midpoint of AB. Then, DP is three times AP, which probably places P somewhere on DA such that DP = 3AP. We need to find the minimum value of the sum MN + NO + OP.First, let me visualize the square. Let me label the square ABCD with AB, BC, CD, DA as the sides. Let me assume the standard position where A is at the origin (0,0), B is at (1,0), C at (1,1), D at (0,1). So, side AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), BC from (1,0) to (1,1), CD from (1,1) to (0,1), and DA from (0,1) to (0,0). Given that M is the midpoint of AB, so AM = BM = 0.5. So, coordinates of M would be (0.5, 0). Then, point P is on DA. DA goes from D(0,1) to A(0,0). The condition DP = 3AP. Let&#39;s denote AP = x, so DP = 3x. Since DA has length 1, AP + DP = 1. Therefore, x + 3x = 1 =&gt; 4x =1 =&gt; x = 0.25. So, AP = 0.25, DP = 0.75. Therefore, point P is located 0.25 units from A along DA. Since DA is vertical from (0,1) to (0,0), moving down from D, AP is 0.25, so coordinate of P would be (0, 0.25).Wait, hold on. If DP = 3AP, then starting from D, moving down 3AP, but DA is from D(0,1) to A(0,0). If DP = 3AP, then since DP + AP = DA =1, we have 3AP + AP =1 =&gt; AP =0.25. So, AP is 0.25, so P is 0.25 units above A on DA. So, coordinates of P would be (0, 0.25). Correct.So, M is at (0.5,0), P is at (0,0.25). Now, points N and O are on BC and CD respectively. So, N is somewhere on BC from (1,0) to (1,1), and O is on CD from (1,1) to (0,1).We need to find the positions of N and O such that the total length MN + NO + OP is minimized.Hmm. So, MN connects M(0.5,0) to N on BC(1,y), where y is between 0 and1. Then NO connects N(1,y) to O on CD(z,1), where z is between1 and0. Then OP connects O(z,1) to P(0,0.25). So, the total path is M to N to O to P.To minimize the sum of these three distances. This seems like a problem where we can use reflection principles or calculus with coordinates.Alternatively, maybe we can parameterize the positions of N and O and then compute the total distance.Let me try parameterizing. Let me denote N as (1, n), where n is between 0 and1, since it&#39;s on BC. Similarly, O is on CD, which goes from (1,1) to (0,1), so CD is the top side? Wait, CD is from (1,1) to (0,1)? Wait, no. Wait, in the standard square labeling, ABCD is a square with sides AB, BC, CD, DA. So, starting at A(0,0), then B(1,0), C(1,1), D(0,1). So, CD is from (1,1) to (0,1), which is the top side. So, CD is the top side, horizontal from (1,1) to (0,1). Wait, no, CD is from C(1,1) to D(0,1), so it&#39;s the leftward horizontal line from (1,1) to (0,1). So, point O is on CD, so coordinates would be (o,1), where o is between 0 and1. Wait, no. If CD is from C(1,1) to D(0,1), then moving from C to D, the x-coordinate decreases from 1 to 0, y remains 1. So, O is on CD, so coordinates are (o,1) where o is from 1 to0. So, parameterizing O as (1 - t, 1) where t is from 0 to1. Hmm.Similarly, N is on BC, which is from B(1,0) to C(1,1). So, coordinates of N can be (1, n), where n is from 0 to1.So, let me denote:M is (0.5, 0)N is (1, n), n ∈ [0,1]O is (o, 1), o ∈ [0,1]Wait, no. CD is from (1,1) to (0,1), so coordinates of O would be (o,1) where o ∈ [0,1], but moving from C(1,1) to D(0,1), so o goes from 1 to0. So, actually, O is (1 - t,1), t ∈ [0,1]. But perhaps it&#39;s easier to just let o be in [0,1].But regardless, O is somewhere on CD at (o,1), o between0 and1. Wait, if CD is from (1,1) to (0,1), then the x-coordinate decreases from1 to0. So, point O can be represented as (o,1) where o is between0 and1. Wait, no. If CD is from C(1,1) to D(0,1), then moving from C to D, the x-coordinate decreases. So, O is (1 - t,1), t ∈ [0,1]. So, maybe parameterize O as (1 - t,1) with t ∈ [0,1], but perhaps it&#39;s equivalent to just using o =1 - t. Either way, coordinates (o,1), o from0 to1.But let&#39;s proceed with coordinates. So, N is (1,n) and O is (o,1).Now, the total distance MN + NO + OP is:MN: distance from (0.5, 0) to (1, n): sqrt[(1 -0.5)^2 + (n -0)^2] = sqrt(0.25 + n²)NO: distance from (1, n) to (o,1): sqrt[(o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2]OP: distance from (o,1) to (0, 0.25): sqrt[(0 - o)^2 + (0.25 -1)^2] = sqrt(o² + 0.5625)So, the total distance is sqrt(0.25 + n²) + sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) + sqrt(o² + 0.5625)We need to minimize this expression over variables n and o, both in [0,1].Hmm, this is a two-variable optimization problem. Maybe we can use calculus here, taking partial derivatives with respect to n and o, set them to zero, and solve for critical points. Alternatively, perhaps there is a geometric interpretation using reflections to find the shortest path.In problems where we need to minimize the sum of multiple distances, reflection techniques can sometimes turn the problem into finding a straight-line path in a reflected coordinate system.For example, if we need to go from M to N to O to P, the minimal path would correspond to a straight line in a coordinate system where certain sides of the square are reflected. However, with three segments, it might require multiple reflections.Alternatively, since the path consists of three segments, perhaps we can break it down by considering reflections at each bounce.Alternatively, fix one variable and express the other in terms of it.Alternatively, parameterize the positions in terms of a single variable.Alternatively, use calculus. Let me try that.Let me denote the total distance as f(n, o) = sqrt(0.25 + n²) + sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) + sqrt(o² + 0.5625)We need to find the minimum of f(n, o) over n ∈ [0,1], o ∈ [0,1].To do this, compute the partial derivatives ∂f/∂n and ∂f/∂o, set them to zero.First, compute ∂f/∂n:df/dn = (n)/sqrt(0.25 + n²) + [ - (1 -n) ] / sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )Similarly, ∂f/∂o:df/do = [ (o -1) ] / sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) + [ o ] / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 )Set both partial derivatives to zero.So, the critical points satisfy:n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) - (1 -n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) = 0and(o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) = 0This seems complicated. Maybe we can manipulate these equations.Let me denote the first equation as:n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) = (1 -n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )Square both sides:n² / (0.25 + n²) = (1 -n)² / [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]Cross multiply:n² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = (1 -n)² (0.25 + n² )Similarly, for the second equation:(o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) = - o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 )Square both sides:(o -1)² / [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = o² / (o² + 0.5625 )Cross multiply:(o -1)² (o² + 0.5625 ) = o² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]This also looks messy. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps we can consider symmetry or make some substitutions.Alternatively, maybe parametrize the problem in terms of a single parameter.Alternatively, notice that the path M-N-O-P can be thought of as a broken line, and we need to find the positions N and O that make the total length minimal. Perhaps reflecting point P across CD to get a virtual point, then reflecting that across BC, etc., but with three reflections it might get complex.Wait, reflection trick for shortest path: when dealing with a path that reflects off multiple surfaces, you can reflect the start or end points across those surfaces and find a straight line path.But here, we have three segments: M to N on AB to BC, then N to O on BC to CD, then O to P on CD to DA. So, the path goes from M to N (on BC), then to O (on CD), then to P.To apply reflection principle, we can reflect P over CD to get P&#39;, then the path O-P is equivalent to O-P&#39;. Then, reflect P&#39; over BC to get P&#39;&#39;, so the path N-O-P&#39; becomes N-P&#39;&#39;. Then, reflecting again over AB perhaps? Wait, this might need multiple reflections.Alternatively, reflect point P across CD first. Let&#39;s see.Original point P is at (0,0.25). CD is the line y=1. Reflecting P over CD (y=1) would give point P1 at (0, 1.75). Then, reflecting P1 over BC (which is x=1). Wait, BC is the line x=1. So reflecting P1(0,1.75) over x=1 gives P2 at (2,1.75). Then, reflecting P2 over AB (y=0) would give P3 at (2,-1.75). Hmm, not sure if this helps.Alternatively, think of the path M-N-O-P as a path that goes from M to N on BC, then to O on CD, then to P. To make this a straight line, we can reflect P over CD to get P&#39;, then the path O-P is equivalent to O-P&#39;. Then, the path N-O-P&#39; would be a straight line from N to P&#39;, passing through O. Then, reflecting again over BC? Maybe reflect P&#39; over BC to get P&#39;&#39;. So, the path M-N-O-P can be represented as M to N to O to P, which can be converted into a straight line from M to P&#39;&#39; via reflections.Let me think step by step.First, to handle the segment OP, which is from O on CD to P. If we reflect P over CD to get P1, then the length OP is equal to the length OP1, but since O is on CD, the shortest path from O to P would be a straight line, but since O is constrained to CD, reflecting allows us to represent it as a straight line.Similarly, for the segment NO, which goes from N on BC to O on CD. If we reflect O over BC to get O1, then the length NO is equal to the length NO1. Then, reflecting again for the segment MN.But this might get too complicated. Let me try another approach.Alternatively, since we have two variables, n and o, perhaps we can use calculus to solve the system of equations.But given the complexity, maybe it&#39;s better to parameterize one variable in terms of another.Alternatively, consider that after choosing N and O, the total path is three connected line segments. To minimize this, the path should follow the law of reflection at each point, i.e., the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. However, since N and O are points we can choose freely on their respective sides, the minimal path would correspond to a straight line in a suitably reflected coordinate system.Let me try this reflection approach.Imagine that we want to go from M to P via reflections over BC and CD. Wait, but we have two intermediate points N and O. So, perhaps we need to reflect the original square multiple times and find a straight path that goes through the reflections.Alternatively, here&#39;s a method for multiple reflections:1. Reflect point P across CD to get P1.2. Reflect P1 across BC to get P2.3. The path M-N-O-P corresponds to the straight line from M to P2, intersecting BC at N and CD at O.If this is the case, then the minimal path MN + NO + OP would be equal to the distance from M to P2.Let me check.Reflecting P over CD: CD is the line y=1. Original P is (0,0.25). Reflecting over y=1 gives P1 = (0, 1.75).Then reflecting P1 over BC: BC is the line x=1. Reflecting (0,1.75) over x=1 gives P2 = (2,1.75).So, the straight line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75) would cross BC at N and CD at O.Calculate the equation of the line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75). Let&#39;s parametrize this line.The vector from M to P2 is (2 -0.5, 1.75 -0) = (1.5, 1.75). So, parametric equations:x = 0.5 + 1.5ty = 0 + 1.75tWe need to find where this line intersects BC and CD.First, intersection with BC: BC is x=1, y from0 to1. So set x=1:1 = 0.5 + 1.5t =&gt; 0.5 =1.5t =&gt; t= 0.5 /1.5 = 1/3 ≈0.333...At t=1/3, y=1.75*(1/3) ≈0.5833. So, point N is (1, 0.5833). Since BC is from (1,0) to (1,1), y=0.5833 is valid.Then, intersection with CD: CD is y=1, x from0 to1. So set y=1:1 =1.75t =&gt; t=1/1.75 ≈0.5714...At t=1/1.75, x=0.5 +1.5*(1/1.75) =0.5 + (1.5/1.75) ≈0.5 +0.8571≈1.3571. But CD is from (1,1) to (0,1), so x must be between0 and1. However, 1.3571 is outside the square. Hmm, that&#39;s a problem.Wait, that suggests that the line from M to P2 doesn&#39;t intersect CD within the original square. Therefore, this approach might not work.Alternatively, maybe I need to reflect more times. Let me think again.Another way: Since the path goes from M to N on BC, then to O on CD, then to P, perhaps we need to reflect P over CD to get P1, then reflect P1 over BC to get P2. Then the path M-N-O-P would correspond to the straight line from M to P2, intersecting BC at N and CD at O.But in this case, P2 is (2,1.75), which is outside the original square. So the line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75) intersects BC at N(1, ~0.5833) and CD at O(1.3571,1), but O is outside the square. Therefore, this reflection might not capture the minimal path within the square.Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider different reflections. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, reflect point M over BC and then over CD. But not sure.Alternatively, use three reflections. The problem is that with three segments, you might need three reflections. Let me see.Alternatively, consider unfolding the path into a reflected grid. Since we have three segments, we can represent the path as a straight line through three reflected squares.Imagine tiling the plane with reflected squares. Then, the minimal path from M to P through N and O would correspond to a straight line in this grid.But perhaps this is more complex.Alternatively, here&#39;s a method from calculus of variations. If we can parameterize the path with variables n and o, then compute the derivatives and solve.But given the earlier equations, it&#39;s quite involved. Let me try to see if there&#39;s a relation between n and o.From the first equation:n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) = (1 -n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )Let me denote sqrt(0.25 + n²) as A, and sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) as B.Then, equation 1: n / A = (1 -n)/B =&gt; nB = (1 -n)A =&gt; n² B² = (1 -n)² A²But B² = (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 and A² =0.25 +n².So, substituting:n² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = (1 -n)^2 (0.25 +n² )Similarly, from the second equation:(o -1)/B + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) =0Let me denote sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) as C.Then, (o -1)/B + o / C =0 =&gt; (o -1)/B = - o / C =&gt; (o -1)/B = - o / C =&gt; cross multiply: (o -1)C = -o B =&gt; Square both sides: (o -1)² C² = o² B²But C² = o² + 0.5625So, (o -1)² (o² +0.5625 ) = o² B² = o² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]Hmm, so we have two equations:1. n² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = (1 -n)^2 (0.25 +n² )2. (o -1)^2 (o² +0.5625 ) = o² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]This looks really complicated, but maybe we can relate them.Let me denote equation1 as:n² [ B² ] = (1 -n)^2 A²From equation2:(o -1)^2 C² = o² B²But C² = o² +0.5625, so:(o -1)^2 (o² +0.5625 ) = o² B²From equation1, we have B² = [ (1 -n)^2 / n² ] A²So, substituting into equation2:(o -1)^2 (o² +0.5625 ) = o² [ (1 -n)^2 / n² ] A²But A² =0.25 +n²So:(o -1)^2 (o² +0.5625 ) = o² [ (1 -n)^2 / n² ] (0.25 +n² )But this seems too complex. Perhaps we can assume a relationship between n and o. Let&#39;s try to assume that the minimal path occurs when the angles of incidence equal the angles of reflection at points N and O. In optics, when a light ray reflects off a surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Perhaps this principle can be applied here for the minimal path.If that&#39;s the case, then at point N on BC, the incoming path from M to N and the outgoing path from N to O should satisfy the reflection law. Similarly, at point O on CD, the incoming path from N to O and the outgoing path from O to P should also satisfy the reflection law.To apply this, we can reflect the direction of the path at each point.Alternatively, reflect the source or destination across the sides to make the path straight.For instance, for the reflection at O: to make the path from O to P straight, we can reflect P over CD to get P1. Then, the path from N to O to P is equivalent to the path from N to P1 via O on CD. Similarly, reflect N over BC to get N1, making the path from M to N to O equivalent to M to N1 via N on BC.Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to do step by step.First, handle the reflection at O. To make the path O-P into a straight line, reflect P over CD to get P1. Then, the path O-P is equivalent to O-P1, which is a straight line. Then, the total path becomes MN + NO + OP = MN + NO + OP1, but O must lie on CD. So, to minimize this, we can consider the path from N to P1 passing through O on CD. The minimal path from N to P1 via CD is the straight line from N to P1 reflected at CD. So, the minimal path from N to P via O is the straight line from N to P1, with O being the intersection point with CD.Similarly, reflect P over CD to get P1=(0, 1.75). Then, the path NO + OP is equal to the straight line from N to P1, so the total path MN + (NO + OP) = MN + NP1. Now, MN + NP1 is the sum of two distances: from M to N, then from N to P1.But this is not a straight path. However, if we can express it as a function of N, we can find the minimum.Alternatively, to apply reflection for the entire path, maybe we need multiple reflections.Let me try reflecting point P over CD to get P1=(0,1.75). Then, reflecting P1 over BC to get P2=(2,1.75). Then, the path M-N-O-P is equivalent to M-N-O-P1-P2. If we can make the entire path from M to P2 via N and O, which are on BC and CD respectively. So, the minimal path would be the straight line from M to P2 intersecting BC at N and CD at O. However, as previously calculated, this line goes through N=(1, 0.5833) and O=(1.3571,1), but O is outside the original square. Therefore, this path is invalid because O must be on CD (x from0 to1). Hence, this approach may not work.Alternatively, maybe we need to reflect in a different order. Reflect over BC first, then CD. Let&#39;s try.First, reflect M over BC to get M1. BC is the line x=1. M is at (0.5,0). Reflecting over x=1: the reflection of (0.5,0) over x=1 is (1.5,0). So, M1=(1.5,0). Then, reflect M1 over CD (y=1) to get M2=(1.5,2). Then, the path from M to N to O to P would correspond to a straight line from M2 to P, passing through O and N. But this might not work.Alternatively, think of the path as M to N to O to P. To make this a straight line, we can reflect P over CD to P1, then reflect P1 over BC to P2, then reflect P2 over AB to P3, but this is getting too convoluted.Alternatively, use multiple reflections: To go from M to N to O to P, we can reflect P over CD to P1, then reflect P1 over BC to P2. Then the straight line from M to P2 would intersect BC at N and CD at O. However, as before, O is outside the square. Hence, this suggests that the minimal path might involve O being at the corner C or D, but since O is on CD, which is from (1,1) to (0,1), the corner C is (1,1), D is (0,1). P is at (0,0.25). Maybe O is somewhere between C and D.Alternatively, if we parameterize O as (o,1), then OP is sqrt(o² + (0.75)^2 ), since from (o,1) to (0,0.25). Wait, OP is sqrt( (o -0)^2 + (1 -0.25)^2 )=sqrt(o² + 0.5625). Right.Let me consider if N is at B(1,0), then O would have to be somewhere on CD. Let&#39;s compute the total distance in that case.If N is at B(1,0), then MN is distance from (0.5,0) to (1,0)=0.5. Then NO is distance from (1,0) to O on CD. Let&#39;s say O is at C(1,1). Then NO is 1, and OP is distance from (1,1) to (0,0.25)=sqrt(1 + 0.75²)=sqrt(1 +0.5625)=sqrt(1.5625)=1.25. Total distance=0.5 +1 +1.25=2.75. If O is somewhere else on CD, maybe less.Alternatively, if O is at (0,1), then NO is distance from (1,0) to (0,1)=sqrt(2)≈1.4142, and OP is from (0,1) to (0,0.25)=0.75. Total distance=0.5 +1.4142 +0.75≈2.6642. Better.Alternatively, if N is somewhere else. Suppose N is at (1,0.5), then MN is sqrt(0.5² +0.5²)=sqrt(0.25 +0.25)=sqrt(0.5)=0.7071. Then O is at (o,1). Suppose O is at (0.5,1). Then NO is sqrt( (0.5 -1)^2 + (1 -0.5)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 +0.25)=sqrt(0.5)=0.7071. Then OP is sqrt(0.5² +0.75²)=sqrt(0.25 +0.5625)=sqrt(0.8125)=0.9014. Total≈0.7071+0.7071+0.9014≈2.3156. Better.This is less than previous values. Maybe even lower.Alternatively, consider N at (1, n) and O at (o,1). Suppose we set up parametric equations and try to numerically estimate the minimum.Alternatively, use calculus with substitution.From the first equation:n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) = (1 -n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )Let me square both sides:n² / (0.25 +n²) = (1 -n)² / [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]Cross-multiplying:n² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = (1 -n)^2 (0.25 +n² )Let me expand both sides:Left side: n² (o -1)^2 +n² (1 -n)^2Right side: (1 -n)^2 *0.25 + (1 -n)^2 n²So, rearranging:n² (o -1)^2 = 0.25 (1 -n)^2Therefore:(o -1)^2 = [0.25 (1 -n)^2 ] /n²Take square root:|o -1| = [0.5 (1 -n) ] /nSince o is between0 and1, and (o -1) is negative or zero. So, 1 -o = [0.5 (1 -n) ] /nTherefore:1 -o = 0.5 (1 -n)/n =&gt; o =1 - 0.5(1 -n)/n =1 - 0.5/n +0.5Wait, wait:Wait, 1 -o =0.5 (1 -n)/n =&gt; o=1 -0.5(1 -n)/nYes.So, o=1 -0.5(1 -n)/n=1 -0.5/(n) +0.5=1 +0.5 -0.5/n=1.5 -0.5/n.But o must be between0 and1.Given o=1 -0.5(1 -n)/n=1 -0.5(1/n -1)=1 -0.5/n +0.5=1.5 -0.5/n.Since o ≤1, 1.5 -0.5/n ≤1 =&gt; -0.5/n ≤-0.5 =&gt; 0.5/n ≥0.5 =&gt; 1/n ≥1 =&gt; n ≤1, which is always true. But o must also be ≥0.So, 1.5 -0.5/n ≥0 =&gt; 1.5 ≥0.5/n =&gt; n ≥0.5/1.5=1/3≈0.3333.Therefore, n ∈ [1/3,1].So, we have o=1.5 -0.5/n, but o must be ≤1. So, 1.5 -0.5/n ≤1 =&gt;0.5/n ≥0.5 =&gt;n ≤1, which is okay as n ∈[1/3,1].But o must also be≥0. Let&#39;s check when n=1/3:o=1.5 -0.5/(1/3)=1.5 -1.5=0. So, at n=1/3, o=0.At n=1, o=1.5 -0.5/1=1. So, when n=1, o=1.Therefore, o ranges from0 to1 as n ranges from1/3 to1.So, we can express o in terms of n: o=1.5 -0.5/nNow, substitute this into the second equation.From the second equation:(o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) + o / sqrt(o² +0.5625 )=0But we already have from the first equation that (o -1)^2 = [0.25 (1 -n)^2 ] /n², so sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )= sqrt( [0.25(1 -n)^2 /n²] + (1 -n)^2 )=sqrt( (1 -n)^2 [0.25/n² +1 ] )= (1 -n) sqrt(0.25/n² +1 )Similarly, sqrt(o² +0.5625 )=sqrt( (1.5 -0.5/n )² +0.5625 )So, plug these into the second equation:(o -1)/[ (1 -n) sqrt(0.25/n² +1 ) ] + o / sqrt( (1.5 -0.5/n )² +0.5625 ) =0But o -1= (1.5 -0.5/n ) -1=0.5 -0.5/nThus:[0.5 -0.5/n ]/[ (1 -n) sqrt(0.25/n² +1 ) ] + (1.5 -0.5/n ) / sqrt( (1.5 -0.5/n )² +0.5625 ) =0This equation is in terms of n only, but it&#39;s still quite complicated. Let me simplify term by term.Let me denote t =n, to make notation cleaner.First term:Numerator:0.5 -0.5/t =0.5(1 -1/t )Denominator: (1 -t ) sqrt(0.25/t² +1 )= (1 -t ) sqrt( (0.25 +t²)/t² )=(1 -t ) sqrt(0.25 +t²)/tThus, first term becomes:0.5(1 -1/t ) / [ (1 -t ) sqrt(0.25 +t²)/t ] =0.5(1 -1/t ) * t / [ (1 -t ) sqrt(0.25 +t² ) ]=0.5( t -1 ) / [ (1 -t ) sqrt(0.25 +t² ) ]=0.5(-1 ) / sqrt(0.25 +t² )Because (t -1 )/(1 -t )= -1.So, first term simplifies to -0.5 / sqrt(0.25 +t² )Second term:(1.5 -0.5/t ) / sqrt( (1.5 -0.5/t )² +0.5625 )Let me compute the denominator:(1.5 -0.5/t )² +0.5625= (2.25 -1.5/t +0.25/t² ) +0.5625=2.25 +0.5625 -1.5/t +0.25/t²=2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t²So, denominator= sqrt(2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² )Thus, the second term is (1.5 -0.5/t ) / sqrt(2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² )Therefore, the entire equation becomes:-0.5 / sqrt(0.25 +t² ) + (1.5 -0.5/t ) / sqrt(2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² ) =0Move the first term to the other side:(1.5 -0.5/t ) / sqrt(2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² ) =0.5 / sqrt(0.25 +t² )Square both sides:( (1.5 -0.5/t )² ) / (2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² ) =0.25 / (0.25 +t² )But note that numerator of left side:(1.5 -0.5/t )²=2.25 -1.5/t +0.25/t²Denominator of left side:2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t²So, numerator= denominator -0.5625.Therefore, left side= (denominator -0.5625)/denominator=1 -0.5625/denominatorSo, the equation becomes:1 -0.5625/denominator =0.25/(0.25 +t² )Thus,1 -0.5625/(2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² )=0.25/(0.25 +t² )This is still very complex, but maybe we can substitute t=0.5 to check.Let me try t=0.5.Then,denominator=2.8125 -1.5/0.5 +0.25/0.25=2.8125 -3 +1=0.8125So, left side=1 -0.5625/0.8125=1 -0.5625/0.8125=1 -0.6923≈0.3077Right side=0.25/(0.25 +0.25)=0.25/0.5=0.5Not equal. So, not a solution.Try t=0.6.denominator=2.8125 -1.5/0.6 +0.25/0.36≈2.8125 -2.5 +0.6944≈2.8125 -2.5=0.3125 +0.6944≈1.0069left side=1 -0.5625/1.0069≈1 -0.558≈0.442Right side=0.25/(0.25 +0.36)=0.25/0.61≈0.4098Close but not equal.Try t=0.55.denominator=2.8125 -1.5/0.55 +0.25/(0.55)^2Compute:1.5/0.55≈2.72730.25/0.3025≈0.8264Thus, denominator≈2.8125 -2.7273 +0.8264≈2.8125 -2.7273=0.0852 +0.8264≈0.9116Left side=1 -0.5625/0.9116≈1 -0.617≈0.383Right side=0.25/(0.25 +0.3025)=0.25/0.5525≈0.4525Not matching.Try t=0.4.denominator=2.8125 -1.5/0.4 +0.25/0.16=2.8125 -3.75 +1.5625=2.8125 +1.5625=4.375 -3.75=0.625Left side=1 -0.5625/0.625=1 -0.9=0.1Right side=0.25/(0.25 +0.16)=0.25/0.41≈0.6098Nope.Try t=0.3333.denominator=2.8125 -1.5/0.3333 +0.25/0.1111≈2.8125 -4.5 +2.25≈2.8125 -4.5= -1.6875 +2.25≈0.5625Left side=1 -0.5625/0.5625=1 -1=0Right side=0.25/(0.25 +0.1111)=0.25/0.3611≈0.6923Nope.This trial and error isn&#39;t working well. Maybe we need to set u=1/t to simplify.Let me set u=1/t, then t=1/u.Rewrite the equation:-0.5 / sqrt(0.25 + (1/u )² ) + (1.5 -0.5u ) / sqrt(2.8125 -1.5u +0.25u² ) =0But this may not help.Alternatively, cross-multiplied equation:(1.5 -0.5/t ) / sqrt(2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² ) =0.5 / sqrt(0.25 +t² )Square both sides:( (1.5 -0.5/t )² ) / (2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² ) =0.25 / (0.25 +t² )As noticed earlier, numerator= denominator -0.5625Therefore,( denominator -0.5625 ) / denominator =0.25 / (0.25 +t² )Multiply both sides by denominator:denominator -0.5625 =0.25 denominator / (0.25 +t² )Multiply both sides by (0.25 +t² ):(denominator -0.5625)(0.25 +t² )=0.25 denominatorExpand:denominator *0.25 + denominator *t² -0.5625*0.25 -0.5625*t² =0.25 denominatorMove all terms to left:denominator *0.25 + denominator *t² -0.5625*0.25 -0.5625*t² -0.25 denominator=0Simplify:denominator*t² -0.5625*0.25 -0.5625*t²=0Factor:t² (denominator -0.5625 ) -0.140625=0But denominator=2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t²Thus,t² (2.8125 -1.5/t +0.25/t² -0.5625 ) -0.140625=0Simplify inside the parentheses:2.8125 -0.5625=2.25So,t² (2.25 -1.5/t +0.25/t² ) -0.140625=0Multiply through by t² to eliminate denominators:t² *2.25 t² -t²*1.5 t +t²*0.25 -0.140625 t²=0Wait, no:Wait, t²*(2.25 -1.5/t +0.25/t² )=t²*2.25 -t²*(1.5/t ) +t²*(0.25/t² )=2.25 t² -1.5 t +0.25Thus, the equation becomes:2.25 t² -1.5 t +0.25 -0.140625=0Simplify constants:0.25 -0.140625=0.109375Thus:2.25 t² -1.5 t +0.109375=0Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate decimals:2.25*16=36, 1.5*16=24, 0.109375*16=1.75Thus:36t² -24t +1.75=0Divide by 0.25 to simplify:144t² -96t +7=0Use quadratic formula:t=(96 ±sqrt(96² -4*144*7 ))/(2*144 )Compute discriminant:96²=9216, 4*144*7=4032Thus, sqrt(9216 -4032)=sqrt(5184)=72Thus,t=(96 ±72)/288So,t=(96 +72)/288=168/288=7/12≈0.5833Or t=(96 -72)/288=24/288=1/12≈0.0833But earlier, n ∈[1/3,1], so t=7/12≈0.5833 is valid, and t=1/12≈0.0833 is invalid.So, solution is t=7/12≈0.5833Thus, n=7/12≈0.5833Then, o=1.5 -0.5/n=1.5 -0.5/(7/12)=1.5 -0.5*(12/7)=1.5 -6/7≈1.5 -0.8571≈0.6429So, o≈0.6429Thus, coordinates:N=(1,7/12≈0.5833)O=(0.6429,1)Now, compute MN + NO + OP.Compute MN: distance from (0.5,0) to (1,7/12)= sqrt( (0.5)^2 + (7/12)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 +49/144 )=sqrt(36/144 +49/144 )=sqrt(85/144 )=sqrt(85)/12≈9.2195/12≈0.7683NO: distance from (1,7/12) to (0.6429,1)= sqrt( (0.6429 -1)^2 + (1 -7/12)^2 )=sqrt( (-0.3571)^2 + (5/12)^2 )≈sqrt(0.1275 +0.1736 )≈sqrt(0.3011 )≈0.5487OP: distance from (0.6429,1) to (0,0.25)= sqrt(0.6429² + (1 -0.25)^2 )=sqrt(0.4133 +0.5625 )=sqrt(0.9758 )≈0.9878Total≈0.7683 +0.5487 +0.9878≈2.3048Check if this is the minimum.But let&#39;s compute precisely:n=7/12≈0.5833o=1.5 -0.5/(7/12)=1.5 -6/7≈1.5 -0.8571≈0.6429Compute MN:sqrt( (1 -0.5)^2 + (7/12 -0)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 +49/144 )Convert to 144 denominator:0.25=36/144, so total= (36 +49)/144=85/144sqrt(85)/12≈9.2195/12≈0.7683NO:sqrt( (1 -0.6429)^2 + (1 -7/12)^2 )1 -0.6429≈0.3571, squared≈0.12751 -7/12=5/12≈0.4167, squared≈0.1736Sum≈0.1275 +0.1736≈0.3011, sqrt≈0.5487OP:sqrt( (0.6429)^2 + (0.75)^2 )0.6429²≈0.4133, 0.75²=0.5625, sum≈0.9758, sqrt≈0.9879Total≈0.7683 +0.5487 +0.9879≈2.3049But when we calculated earlier with N at (1,0.5) and O at (0.5,1), total≈2.3156, which is higher. So, this suggests that the critical point we found is a lower value.But we need to verify if this is indeed the minimal value.Alternatively, check if this is the minimal by verifying the second derivative or checking endpoints.Check when n=1/3, o=0.Then, MN= distance from (0.5,0) to (1,1/3)=sqrt(0.5² + (1/3)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 +0.1111)=sqrt(0.3611)≈0.601NO= distance from (1,1/3) to (0,1)=sqrt(1 + (2/3)^2 )=sqrt(1 +0.4444)=sqrt(1.4444)≈1.20185OP= distance from (0,1) to (0,0.25)=0.75Total≈0.601 +1.20185 +0.75≈2.55185, which is higher than 2.3049.Check when n=1, o=1.MN= distance from (0.5,0) to (1,1)=sqrt(0.5² +1²)=sqrt(1.25)≈1.118NO= distance from (1,1) to (1,1)=0OP= distance from (1,1) to (0,0.25)=sqrt(1 +0.75²)=sqrt(1.5625)=1.25Total≈1.118 +0 +1.25≈2.368, which is higher than 2.3049.Therefore, the critical point found gives a lower total distance.Now, check if there&#39;s any other critical points. We found t=7/12≈0.5833 as the solution. So, this seems to be the only critical point in the valid range.Therefore, the minimal value of MN + NO + OP is approximately2.3049. However, we need to find the exact value.Let&#39;s compute the exact total distance at n=7/12 and o=1.5 -0.5/n=1.5 -6/7= (21/14 -12/14)=9/14≈0.6429.Compute MN= sqrt( (1 -0.5)^2 + (7/12 -0)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 +49/144 )Convert 0.25 to 36/144, so sqrt(36 +49)/12=sqrt(85)/12NO= sqrt( (1 -9/14 )^2 + (1 -7/12 )^2 )=sqrt( (5/14 )^2 + (5/12 )^2 )Compute (5/14)^2=25/196, (5/12)^2=25/144.

Optimization Using Calculus:   - Total distance (f(n, o) = sqrt{0.25 + n^2} + sqrt{(o - 1)^2 + (1 - n)^2} + sqrt{o^2 + 0.5625}).   - Solve partial derivatives (frac{partial f}{partial n} = 0) and (frac{partial f}{partial o} = 0) to find critical points.5. Critical Points and Reflection Principle:   - Using reflection principles and solving the system of equations derived from partial derivatives, we find:     - (n = frac{7}{12})     - (o = frac{9}{14})6. Calculation of Minimum Distance:   - Substitute (n = frac{7}{12}) and (o = frac{9}{14}) into the distance expressions:     - (MN = sqrt{left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{7}{12}right)^2} = frac{sqrt{85}}{12})     - (NO = sqrt{left(frac{5}{14}right)^2 + left(frac{5}{12}right)^2} = frac{5sqrt{85}}{84})     - (OP = sqrt{left(frac{9}{14}right)^2 + left(frac{3}{4}right)^2} = frac{3sqrt{85}}{28})   - Summing these distances:     [     frac{sqrt{85}}{12} + frac{5sqrt{85}}{84} + frac{3sqrt{85}}{28} = frac{sqrt{85}}{4}     ]Final Answer:The minimum value of (MN + NO + OP) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{85}}{4}}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand all the details.We have a square ABCD with side length 1. Points M, N, O, P are on sides AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. The conditions given are that AM = BM, which means M is the midpoint of AB. Then DP = 3AP, which tells me something about the position of P on DA. The goal is to find the minimum value of the sum MN + NO + OP.First, let me visualize the square. Let me label the square ABCD with AB, BC, CD, DA as the sides. Let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a standard square with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, AB is the bottom side, BC is the right side, CD is the top, and DA is the left side.Points:- M is on AB, and since AM = BM, M must be the midpoint of AB. So if AB has length 1, then AM = BM = 0.5. So the coordinates of M would be (0.5, 0) if we place the square in a coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1,1), D at (0,1).- P is on DA, and DP = 3AP. DA is the left side from D (0,1) to A (0,0). Let&#39;s let P be somewhere on DA. Let&#39;s denote the coordinates. If DA is from (0,1) to (0,0), then the length is 1. The condition DP = 3AP means that the distance from D to P is three times the distance from A to P. Let’s let AP = x, then DP = 3x. Since AP + DP = AD = 1, then x + 3x = 1 =&gt; 4x = 1 =&gt; x = 0.25. So AP = 0.25, DP = 0.75. Therefore, P is 0.25 units above A on DA. So coordinates of P would be (0, 0.25).Wait, but DA is vertical, so from A(0,0) to D(0,1). So if AP = 0.25, then starting from A (0,0) moving up 0.25 units, so P is at (0, 0.25). Correct.So coordinates:- A: (0,0)- B: (1,0)- C: (1,1)- D: (0,1)- M: midpoint of AB: (0.5, 0)- P: (0, 0.25)Now, points N and O are on BC and CD respectively. Their positions are not given, so they can be anywhere on their respective sides. The problem is to find the minimal total length of MN + NO + OP.So MN is from M(0.5,0) to N on BC. BC is from B(1,0) to C(1,1). So N is somewhere on the right side, coordinates (1, n) where n is between 0 and 1.Then NO is from N(1,n) to O on CD. CD is from C(1,1) to D(0,1). Wait, no, CD is from C(1,1) to D(0,1)? Wait, CD is actually the top side from C(1,1) to D(0,1). So CD is horizontal? Wait, in the standard square labeling, ABCD is a square with AB, BC, CD, DA as consecutive sides. So AB is bottom, BC is right, CD is top, DA is left. Therefore, CD is from C(1,1) to D(0,1), which is the top horizontal side. So O is on CD, so coordinates (o,1) where o is between 0 and 1.Then OP is from O(o,1) to P(0,0.25). So we need to connect these three segments: MN from (0.5,0) to (1,n), then NO from (1,n) to (o,1), then OP from (o,1) to (0,0.25). The total length is the sum of these three distances. We need to find the positions of N and O (i.e., parameters n and o) that minimize this total length.Wait, but hold on. Let me check the coordinates again.Wait, CD is the top side from C(1,1) to D(0,1), so yes, horizontal. So O is on CD, so O has coordinates (o,1) where o ∈ [0,1].Similarly, BC is the right side from B(1,0) to C(1,1), so N is (1, n) where n ∈ [0,1].So the path is M(0.5,0) -&gt; N(1,n) -&gt; O(o,1) -&gt; P(0,0.25). The total distance is MN + NO + OP.We need to minimize this sum over n and o in [0,1].This seems like a problem that can be approached using calculus, by parameterizing the positions of N and O, expressing the total distance as a function of n and o, then finding the minimum. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a geometric approach using reflections, which is common in optimization problems involving paths (like shortest path that reflects off certain sides).Let me try the reflection method first because it might be more straightforward.In such problems, reflecting points across sides can help turn a broken path into a straight line, whose length is easier to compute. For example, if you have to go from point A to a point on a wall to point B, the shortest path is found by reflecting one of the points over the wall and drawing a straight line.But here, the path is from M to N to O to P, with N on BC and O on CD. So there are two intermediate points. Maybe we can use multiple reflections.Alternatively, we can split the problem into two parts: first find the minimum of MN + NO, then add OP. But OP is dependent on O, so it&#39;s all connected. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P as a combination of three segments and use reflections to make it a straight line.Let me think step by step.First, suppose we fix point O. Then for a fixed O, the path OP is fixed. Then we need to find N such that MN + NO is minimized. Wait, but O is fixed, so MN + NO is the path from M to N to O. To minimize this sum for a given O, we can consider reflecting O over BC (since N is on BC) to get O&#39;, then the shortest path from M to O&#39; passing through BC would be a straight line from M to O&#39; intersecting BC at N. Then MN + NO = MO&#39;.But in this case, O is on CD. So reflecting O over BC.But BC is the vertical side from (1,0) to (1,1). Reflecting a point over BC. If O is (o,1), then reflecting over BC (the line x=1) would give O&#39;(2 - o,1). Because reflecting across the vertical line x=1, the x-coordinate becomes 2*1 - o, y-coordinate remains the same.Then the distance from M(0.5,0) to O&#39;(2 - o,1) is sqrt((2 - o - 0.5)^2 + (1 - 0)^2) = sqrt((1.5 - o)^2 + 1). The intersection point with BC (x=1) would be N(1, n). Then the minimal MN + NO for a fixed O would be equal to MO&#39;, which is sqrt((1.5 - o)^2 + 1). Then, adding OP, which is the distance from O to P(0,0.25). So OP is sqrt((o - 0)^2 + (1 - 0.25)^2) = sqrt(o^2 + 0.75^2) = sqrt(o^2 + 0.5625).Therefore, for each O (determined by o), the total distance would be sqrt((1.5 - o)^2 + 1) + sqrt(o^2 + 0.5625). Then we need to minimize this expression over o ∈ [0,1].Wait, but this approach seems to only consider reflecting over BC for the MN + NO part. However, maybe we need to do multiple reflections.Alternatively, consider the entire path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P. If we can reflect the path such that the entire broken path becomes a straight line in the reflected plane, then the minimal path would be the length of that straight line.To do this, we can reflect point P across CD to get P&#39;, then reflect P&#39; across BC to get P&#39;&#39;. Then the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P would correspond to a straight line from M to P&#39;&#39; passing through N and O. However, this might require multiple reflections.Alternatively, since the path goes from M to N on BC, then to O on CD, then to P on DA. So each reflection would be over the side where the direction changes.Let me recall that when a path reflects over a side, we can mirror the plane across that side and the straight line in the mirrored plane corresponds to the reflected path in the original plane.So to handle multiple reflections, we can reflect P across DA, but DA is the left side. Wait, but P is already on DA. Hmm, perhaps it&#39;s better to reflect P across CD first, then across BC, and see if the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P can be represented as a straight line through these reflections.Alternatively, here&#39;s a method:1. Reflect P over CD to get P1. Then the path OP becomes OP1 in the reflected plane.But O is on CD, so reflecting P over CD would place P1 on the other side of CD. However, since CD is the top side (y=1), reflecting P(0,0.25) over CD (y=1) would give P1(0,1 + (1 - 0.25)) = (0,1.75). But since CD is part of the original square, maybe this reflection is not necessary.Alternatively, perhaps we can reflect the entire square multiple times to create a grid of squares, and the minimal path would correspond to a straight line in this grid.Alternatively, another approach is to parametrize N and O with coordinates.Let me try that.Coordinates:M is fixed at (0.5, 0).N is on BC: (1, n), n ∈ [0,1]O is on CD: (o,1), o ∈ [0,1]P is fixed at (0,0.25)Total distance: MN + NO + OPCompute each distance:MN: distance from (0.5,0) to (1,n)= sqrt((1 - 0.5)^2 + (n - 0)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + n^2)NO: distance from (1,n) to (o,1)= sqrt((o - 1)^2 + (1 - n)^2)OP: distance from (o,1) to (0,0.25)= sqrt((o - 0)^2 + (1 - 0.25)^2) = sqrt(o^2 + 0.5625)Therefore, total distance D(n,o) = sqrt(0.25 + n^2) + sqrt((o - 1)^2 + (1 - n)^2) + sqrt(o^2 + 0.5625)We need to minimize D(n,o) over n ∈ [0,1] and o ∈ [0,1].This is a calculus problem in two variables. To find the minimum, we can take partial derivatives with respect to n and o, set them to zero, and solve the equations. However, this might be algebraically intensive.Alternatively, perhaps we can see if the minimal path occurs when the angles of incidence equal the angles of reflection, similar to light reflecting off mirrors. That is, if the path MN -&gt; NO -&gt; OP reflects off BC and CD with equal angles, but since there are two reflections, this could be complex.Alternatively, use reflection technique twice. Let&#39;s try that.First, reflect point P over CD to get P1. Then, reflect P1 over BC to get P2. Then the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P would correspond to a straight line from M to P2 passing through N and O.Wait, let me detail this.1. Reflect P over CD to get P1. Since CD is the line y=1, and P is (0,0.25), reflecting over y=1 would give P1 = (0, 1 + (1 - 0.25)) = (0, 1.75).2. Then reflect P1 over BC. BC is the line x=1. Reflecting P1(0,1.75) over x=1 gives P2 = (2*1 - 0, 1.75) = (2, 1.75).Now, the path from M to P passing through N on BC and O on CD would correspond to the straight line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75), intersecting BC at N and CD at O.But wait, when we reflect P over CD to get P1, then reflect P1 over BC to get P2, the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P is equivalent to the straight line M -&gt; N -&gt; O1 -&gt; P2 in the reflected coordinate system, where O1 is the reflection of O over CD. However, I might be mixing up the reflections.Alternatively, the idea is that by reflecting P twice, once over CD and once over BC, the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P becomes a straight line in the twice-reflected plane. Therefore, the minimal path would be the straight line distance from M to P2, which is sqrt((2 - 0.5)^2 + (1.75 - 0)^2) = sqrt(1.5^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) ≈ 2.305. However, the actual path MN + NO + OP would be equal to this distance, but since we are reflecting twice, the actual minimal distance might be equal to this. However, I need to verify.Wait, reflecting over two sides, CD and BC, the total reflection would result in P2 being at (2,1.75). So if we draw a straight line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75), the intersections with BC and CD (original and reflected) would correspond to points N and O.But BC is at x=1, and CD is at y=1 in the original square. So let&#39;s find where the line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75) intersects BC and CD.Wait, but in the original coordinate system, BC is x=1, y from 0 to1. CD is x from 0 to1, y=1. However, P2 is in the reflected coordinate system. Wait, perhaps this approach is not directly applicable because reflecting over CD and BC extends the plane beyond the original square.Alternatively, let&#39;s parametrize the line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75). The parametric equations are:x(t) = 0.5 + t*(2 - 0.5) = 0.5 + 1.5ty(t) = 0 + t*(1.75 - 0) = 1.75tWe need to find t1 where the line intersects BC (x=1), and t2 where it intersects CD (y=1).First intersection with BC (x=1):Set x(t) = 1:0.5 + 1.5t = 1 =&gt; 1.5t = 0.5 =&gt; t = 0.5 / 1.5 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333At t=1/3, y = 1.75*(1/3) ≈ 0.5833. But BC is from y=0 to y=1, so this point (1, 0.5833) is on BC. That&#39;s N.Next intersection with CD (y=1):Set y(t) = 1:1.75t = 1 =&gt; t = 1 / 1.75 ≈ 0.5714At t=0.5714, x = 0.5 + 1.5*(0.5714) ≈ 0.5 + 0.8571 ≈ 1.3571But CD in the original square is from x=0 to x=1, y=1. The intersection at x≈1.3571 is outside the original CD, which only goes up to x=1. Therefore, this suggests that the line from M to P2 doesn&#39;t intersect CD in the original square, but in the reflected square. Hmm, this complicates things.Alternatively, perhaps the reflections need to be considered differently. Let me try reflecting M instead.Alternatively, another reflection strategy. To handle the two reflections (BC and CD), maybe we need to reflect the starting point M over BC and CD, or reflect the end point P over those.Wait, another method: the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P can be considered as a path from M to P with reflections at BC and CD. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. However, with two reflections, the problem becomes more complex, but using the method of images, we can represent the path as a straight line in a coordinate system that has been reflected appropriately.To apply this, we can reflect P over CD to get P1, then reflect P1 over BC to get P2. Then, the straight line from M to P2 would cross BC at N and CD at O (after undoing the reflections). The length of this path would be the same as the straight line distance from M to P2.Let me verify:Original point P is at (0, 0.25). Reflecting over CD (y=1) gives P1 = (0, 1.75). Then reflecting P1 over BC (x=1) gives P2 = (2,1.75). So the straight line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75) would cross BC at N and CD at O. But when we unfold the reflections, the path from O to P would be the reflection from O to P1 to P.Wait, maybe not. Let me think carefully.The path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P in the original square corresponds to:- From M to N on BC.- From N to O on CD.- From O to P.When reflecting P over CD to get P1, the segment O -&gt; P is equivalent to O -&gt; P1 in the reflected square. Then reflecting P1 over BC to get P2, the segment N -&gt; O -&gt; P1 becomes N -&gt; O1 -&gt; P2 in the twice-reflected square, where O1 is the reflection of O over CD. But this might not directly help.Alternatively, by reflecting P twice, we can represent the entire path as a straight line from M to P2 passing through N and O in the reflected squares.However, as we saw earlier, the intersection point with CD in the original square is outside the square, which complicates things.Alternatively, maybe the minimal path doesn&#39;t go through CD and BC in the original square but requires the points N and O to be at certain positions. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal path is achieved when N and O are at specific points such that the angles of incidence equal the angles of reflection.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider using calculus to minimize the expression D(n,o).Given that D(n,o) = sqrt(0.25 + n²) + sqrt((o - 1)² + (1 - n)²) + sqrt(o² + 0.5625)To find the minimum, compute partial derivatives ∂D/∂n and ∂D/∂o, set them to zero.First, compute ∂D/∂n:The first term: d/dn sqrt(0.25 + n²) = (n)/sqrt(0.25 + n²)The second term: d/dn sqrt((o - 1)² + (1 - n)²) = [ -2(1 - n) ] / [ 2 sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) ] = -(1 - n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2)The third term doesn&#39;t depend on n, so derivative is 0.So ∂D/∂n = n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) - (1 - n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) = 0Similarly, compute ∂D/∂o:First term: doesn&#39;t depend on o, derivative 0.Second term: d/do sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) = (2(o -1))/[2 sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2)] = (o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2)Third term: d/do sqrt(o² + 0.5625) = o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625)Thus, ∂D/∂o = (o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625) = 0So we have two equations:1. n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) - (1 - n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) = 02. (o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625) = 0These equations look quite complicated. Let&#39;s see if we can find a relationship between n and o.From equation 1:n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) = (1 - n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2)Let&#39;s square both sides to eliminate the square roots:n² / (0.25 + n²) = (1 - n)² / [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]Cross-multiplying:n² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = (1 - n)^2 (0.25 + n² )Similarly, from equation 2:(o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2) = - o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625)Square both sides:(o -1)^2 / [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = o² / (o² + 0.5625 )Cross-multiplying:(o -1)^2 (o² + 0.5625) = o² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]This is also a complex equation.At this point, solving these equations algebraically seems quite involved. Perhaps we can assume a relationship between o and n. For instance, maybe the minimal path occurs when the points N and O lie along a certain line, or when the angles satisfy some condition.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to express o in terms of n from equation 2 and substitute into equation 1.From equation 2:Let me denote term1 = (o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )term2 = o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 )So term1 + term2 = 0 =&gt; term1 = -term2Thus:(o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) = - o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 )Square both sides:(o -1)^2 / [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = o² / (o² + 0.5625 )Cross-multiplying:(o -1)^2 (o² + 0.5625) = o² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]Let me expand both sides:Left side: (o² - 2o +1)(o² + 0.5625)Right side: o² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = o² [ o² - 2o +1 + (1 -n)^2 ]Let me compute left side first:= (o²)(o²) + (o²)(0.5625) - 2o(o²) - 2o(0.5625) +1(o²) +1(0.5625)= o^4 + 0.5625o² - 2o³ - 1.125o + o² + 0.5625= o^4 - 2o³ + (0.5625o² + o²) -1.125o + 0.5625= o^4 - 2o³ + 1.5625o² -1.125o + 0.5625Right side:= o² [ o² - 2o +1 +1 - 2n + n² ]= o² [ o² - 2o +2 - 2n + n² ]= o^4 - 2o³ + (2 - 2n + n²)o²Set left side equal to right side:o^4 - 2o³ + 1.5625o² -1.125o + 0.5625 = o^4 - 2o³ + (2 - 2n + n²)o²Subtract right side from left side:0 + 0 + [1.5625o² - (2 - 2n + n²)o²] -1.125o + 0.5625 = 0Factor o²:[1.5625 - 2 + 2n - n²]o² -1.125o + 0.5625 = 0Compute coefficients:1.5625 - 2 = -0.4375So coefficient of o²: (-0.4375 + 2n - n²)Thus:(-0.4375 + 2n -n²)o² -1.125o + 0.5625 = 0This is a quadratic equation in o, but it&#39;s parameterized by n. This seems too complicated. Maybe we can assume a particular relation between n and o?Alternatively, let&#39;s look back at the reflection idea. If the minimal path corresponds to a straight line in the reflected coordinate system, then perhaps the angles at N and O should satisfy the law of reflection.For the reflection at BC (point N), the incoming angle from M to N should equal the outgoing angle from N to O with respect to the normal of BC. Similarly, at point O, the incoming angle from N to O should equal the outgoing angle from O to P with respect to the normal of CD.Let me elaborate.At point N on BC (which is the vertical line x=1), the normal line is horizontal (perpendicular to BC, which is vertical). So the normal is in the x-direction. The law of reflection states that the angle between the incoming path MN and the normal equals the angle between the outgoing path NO and the normal.Similarly, at point O on CD (which is the horizontal line y=1), the normal is vertical. The incoming path NO and outgoing path OP should make equal angles with the normal.Therefore, applying the law of reflection at both points N and O.For reflection at N (vertical side BC):The slope of MN and the slope of NO should satisfy that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection with respect to the horizontal (since the normal is horizontal).Similarly, at O (horizontal side CD):The slope of NO and the slope of OP should satisfy that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection with respect to the vertical normal.Alternatively, since BC is vertical, reflecting the path MN and NO over BC should form a straight line. Similarly, reflecting OP over CD should form a straight line with NO.Wait, perhaps by reflecting the path at each side, we can create a straight path.Let me try reflecting the initial path.First, to handle the reflection at BC (point N), we can reflect point O over BC to get O&#39;. Then the path from N to O is equivalent to the path from N to O&#39; in the reflected plane. Therefore, the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O is equivalent to M -&gt; N -&gt; O&#39;, where O&#39; is the reflection of O over BC. To make this a straight line, the points M, N, O&#39; should be colinear. Similarly, reflecting over CD for the path O -&gt; P.But since we have two reflections, we might need to apply multiple reflections.Alternatively, reflect point P over CD to get P1, then reflect P1 over BC to get P2. Then the straight line from M to P2 would cross BC at N and CD at O, giving the path M -&gt; N -&gt; O -&gt; P.Let&#39;s compute the coordinates:Original P: (0, 0.25)Reflect over CD (y=1): P1 = (0, 1 + (1 - 0.25)) = (0, 1.75)Reflect P1 over BC (x=1): P2 = (2*1 - 0, 1.75) = (2, 1.75)So the straight line from M(0.5,0) to P2(2,1.75). Let&#39;s find where this line intersects BC and CD.Parametric equations for the line:x(t) = 0.5 + (2 - 0.5)t = 0.5 + 1.5ty(t) = 0 + 1.75tIntersection with BC (x=1):0.5 + 1.5t = 1 ⇒ 1.5t = 0.5 ⇒ t = 1/3At t=1/3, y = 1.75*(1/3) ≈ 0.5833. So point N is (1, 0.5833)Intersection with CD (y=1):1.75t = 1 ⇒ t = 1/1.75 ≈ 0.5714At this t, x = 0.5 + 1.5*(0.5714) ≈ 0.5 + 0.857 ≈ 1.357But CD in the original square is from (0,1) to (1,1), so x=1.357 is outside the original square. This suggests that the intersection point O is outside the original CD. But O must be on CD, which is within [0,1] for x-coordinate.Therefore, this approach might not work as is, since the intersection with CD is outside the original square. Perhaps the minimal path doesn&#39;t involve reflections beyond the original square, meaning that the minimal path is achieved when O is at the corner C or D, but that might not be the case.Alternatively, maybe the minimal path occurs when O is at (1,1), which is point C. Let&#39;s check that.If O is at C(1,1), then OP is the distance from (1,1) to (0,0.25): sqrt(1² + 0.75²) = sqrt(1 + 0.5625) = sqrt(1.5625) = 1.25Then NO is the distance from N to C: if N is (1,n), then distance is 1 - n.MN is sqrt(0.25 + n²)So total distance would be sqrt(0.25 + n²) + (1 - n) + 1.25Simplify: sqrt(n² + 0.25) + (2.25 - n)To minimize this over n ∈ [0,1].Take derivative with respect to n:d/dn [sqrt(n² + 0.25) + 2.25 - n] = (2n)/(2 sqrt(n² + 0.25)) - 1 = n / sqrt(n² + 0.25) - 1Set derivative to zero:n / sqrt(n² + 0.25) - 1 = 0 ⇒ n / sqrt(n² + 0.25) = 1 ⇒ n = sqrt(n² + 0.25)Square both sides: n² = n² + 0.25 ⇒ 0 = 0.25, which is impossible. Therefore, no critical points, so minimum occurs at endpoints.At n=0: sqrt(0 + 0.25) + 2.25 - 0 = 0.5 + 2.25 = 2.75At n=1: sqrt(1 + 0.25) + 2.25 - 1 = sqrt(1.25) + 1.25 ≈ 1.118 + 1.25 ≈ 2.368So the minimal when O is at C is approximately 2.368. But maybe this isn&#39;t the minimal overall.Alternatively, if O is at D(0,1), then OP is the distance from D(0,1) to P(0,0.25) which is 0.75.Then NO is the distance from N(1,n) to O(0,1): sqrt((1)^2 + (1 - n)^2)MN is sqrt(0.25 + n²)Total distance: sqrt(0.25 + n²) + sqrt(1 + (1 - n)^2) + 0.75To minimize this over n ∈ [0,1].This seems complex. Let&#39;s compute at n=0.5:MN: sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707NO: sqrt(1 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.25) ≈ 1.118Total: 0.707 + 1.118 + 0.75 ≈ 2.575Which is higher than the previous case.Alternatively, perhaps O is somewhere inside CD. Let&#39;s consider the reflection approach again, even if the intersection is outside the square.Even if the intersection point O is at x=1.357, but in our problem O must be on CD, which is from (0,1) to (1,1). So x must be between 0 and1. Therefore, the reflection approach gives a point outside the square, implying that the minimal path in the original square does not use that reflection path, and thus the minimal path must occur at the boundary.Therefore, perhaps the minimal occurs when O is at (1,1), but as we saw earlier, that gives a total distance of approximately 2.368. However, maybe there is a lower value when both N and O are inside their respective sides.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider specific values. For example, set n=0.5. Then compute o to minimize the distance.But this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, use calculus to solve the two equations.Recall:From equation 1:n / sqrt(0.25 + n²) = (1 - n)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )Square both sides:n² / (0.25 + n²) = (1 - n)^2 / [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ]Cross-multiplying:n² [ (o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ] = (1 - n)^2 (0.25 + n² )Let me expand both sides:Left side: n²(o -1)^2 + n²(1 - n)^2Right side: (1 - n)^2 *0.25 + (1 - n)^2 n²Subtract right side from left side:n²(o -1)^2 + n²(1 - n)^2 - (1 - n)^2 *0.25 - (1 - n)^2 n² = 0Simplify:n²(o -1)^2 - 0.25(1 - n)^2 = 0So:n²(o -1)^2 = 0.25(1 - n)^2Take square roots:n |o -1| = 0.5(1 - n)Assuming o &lt;1 since O is on CD (x from 0 to1), so |o -1| = 1 - oThus:n(1 - o) = 0.5(1 - n)=&gt; n(1 - o) = 0.5 - 0.5n=&gt; n(1 - o) + 0.5n = 0.5=&gt; n [ (1 - o) + 0.5 ] = 0.5=&gt; n (1.5 - o) = 0.5Thus:n = 0.5 / (1.5 - o )Similarly, from equation 2:(o -1)/sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 ) + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) = 0Let me denote S = sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )Then:(o -1)/S + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) = 0Multiply both sides by S * sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ):(o -1)sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) + o S = 0But this might not help. Let&#39;s substitute n from the previous result.We have n = 0.5 / (1.5 - o )Let me substitute n into equation 2.First, compute S = sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )= sqrt( (1 - o)^2 + (1 - n)^2 )Given n = 0.5 / (1.5 - o )Thus, 1 - n = 1 - 0.5/(1.5 - o ) = (1.5 - o - 0.5)/ (1.5 - o ) = (1 - o)/ (1.5 - o )Therefore, (1 - n) = (1 - o)/(1.5 - o )Therefore, S = sqrt( (1 - o)^2 + [ (1 - o)/(1.5 - o ) ]^2 )= sqrt( (1 - o)^2 [1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² ] )= |1 - o| sqrt( 1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² )Since o &lt;1.5, and in our case o ∈ [0,1], so 1 - o &gt;0, and 1.5 - o &gt;0.5 &gt;0. Thus:S = (1 - o ) sqrt( 1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² )Now, let&#39;s substitute back into equation 2:(o -1)/S + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) = 0Replace S:(o -1)/[ (1 - o ) sqrt(1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² ) ] + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) = 0Note that (o -1)/(1 - o ) = -1So:-1 / sqrt(1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² ) + o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) = 0Thus:o / sqrt(o² + 0.5625 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² )Let me square both sides:o² / (o² + 0.5625 ) = 1 / [1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² ]Cross-multiplying:o² [1 + 1/(1.5 - o )² ] = o² + 0.5625Expand left side:o² + o² / (1.5 - o )² = o² + 0.5625Subtract o² from both sides:o² / (1.5 - o )² = 0.5625Take square roots:o / (1.5 - o ) = sqrt(0.5625 ) = 0.75Thus:o = 0.75 (1.5 - o )Expand:o = 1.125 - 0.75oBring terms together:o + 0.75o = 1.1251.75o = 1.125o = 1.125 / 1.75 = (9/8) / (7/4) = (9/8)*(4/7) = 36/56 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429So o = 9/14Now, substitute back to find n:n = 0.5 / (1.5 - o ) = 0.5 / (1.5 - 9/14 )Convert 1.5 to 21/14:1.5 = 21/14So 21/14 - 9/14 = 12/14 = 6/7Thus, n = 0.5 / (6/7 ) = 0.5 *7/6 = 7/12 ≈ 0.5833Therefore, the critical point is at o =9/14 ≈0.6429, n=7/12≈0.5833.Now, we need to verify if this gives a minimum.Compute the second derivatives or check the nature of the critical point, but that might be complex. Alternatively, compute the total distance at this point and compare with the boundaries.Compute D(n,o):First, MN: sqrt(0.25 + n² ) = sqrt(0.25 + (7/12 )² )7/12 ≈0.5833, squared is≈0.3403Thus sqrt(0.25 +0.3403)=sqrt(0.5903)≈0.768NO: sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n )^2 )o=9/14≈0.6429, so o-1≈-0.3571, squared≈0.12751 -n=1 -7/12=5/12≈0.4167, squared≈0.1736Sum≈0.1275 +0.1736=0.3011, sqrt≈0.5487OP: sqrt(o² +0.5625 )o=9/14≈0.6429, squared≈0.413, plus0.5625≈0.9755, sqrt≈0.9877Total D≈0.768 +0.5487 +0.9877≈2.3044Compare with previous values when O was at C (≈2.368) or other points. This is lower, so this critical point likely gives the minimal value.Therefore, the minimal total distance is approximately2.3044. To find the exact value, compute it using the exact fractions.Compute MN:n=7/12, MN= sqrt(0.25 + (7/12)^2 )0.25=1/4=9/36(7/12)^2=49/144=49/144=12.25/36Sum=9/36 +49/144= (36 +49)/144=85/144sqrt(85/144)=sqrt(85)/12≈9.2195/12≈0.768, which matches.NO: sqrt((o -1)^2 + (1 -n)^2 )o=9/14, o -1= -5/14, squared=25/1961 -n=5/12, squared=25/144Sum=25/196 +25/144=25(1/196 +1/144)=25(144 +196)/(196*144)=25(340)/(28224)=8500/28224=2125/7056sqrt(2125/7056)=sqrt(2125)/84≈46.10/84≈0.549, which matches.OP: sqrt(o² +0.5625 )o=9/14, o²=81/1960.5625=9/16Sum=81/196 +9/16= (81*16 +9*196)/(196*16)= (1296 +1764)/3136=3060/3136=765/784sqrt(765/784)=sqrt(765)/28≈27.66/28≈0.9875, which matches.Total D= sqrt(85)/12 + sqrt(2125)/84 + sqrt(765)/28But this is messy. Let&#39;s see if these radicals can be simplified.sqrt(85) is irrational.sqrt(2125)=sqrt(25*85)=5*sqrt(85)sqrt(765)=sqrt(9*85)=3*sqrt(85)Therefore,MN= sqrt(85)/12NO=5*sqrt(85)/84= sqrt(85)/16.8OP=3*sqrt(85)/28So total D= sqrt(85)/12 +5*sqrt(85)/84 +3*sqrt(85)/28Convert all to 84 denominator:sqrt(85)/12 =7*sqrt(85)/845*sqrt(85)/84=5*sqrt(85)/843*sqrt(85)/28=9*sqrt(85)/84Sum=7+5+9=21, so total D=21*sqrt(85)/84= sqrt(85)/4≈9.2195/4≈2.3049, which matches the approximate value.Therefore, the exact minimal value is sqrt(85)/4.But wait, sqrt(85)/4. Let me verify:sqrt(85) is approximately9.2195, so sqrt(85)/4≈2.3049, which matches the approximate sum.But let&#39;s check if this is correct:Wait, sqrt(85)/4?Wait, we had total D= sqrt(85)/12 +5*sqrt(85)/84 +3*sqrt(85)/28Let me compute:sqrt(85)/12 =7*sqrt(85)/845*sqrt(85)/84=5*sqrt(85)/843*sqrt(85)/28=9*sqrt(85)/84Total:7+5+9=21*sqrt(85)/84= (21/84)*sqrt(85)= (1/4)*sqrt(85)Yes, so D= sqrt(85)/4.Therefore, the minimal value is sqrt(85)/4.But let&#39;s check if this is the minimal value. Suppose we have found the critical point, and the boundaries give higher values, then this is the minimal. We saw that at O=C, the total was ~2.368, which is higher than ~2.304, so this critical point is indeed the minimum.Thus, the minimal value is sqrt(85)/4. However, sqrt(85) simplifies as sqrt(85) is already in simplest form. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(85)/4.But let me verify this result once more.Alternatively, using the reflection method, if we reflect P twice and compute the straight line distance from M to P2, which is sqrt((2 -0.5)^2 + (1.75)^2)= sqrt(1.5^2 +1.75^2)=sqrt(2.25+3.0625)=sqrt(5.3125)=sqrt(85/16)=sqrt(85)/4≈2.3049, which matches the previous result.Therefore, the minimal total distance MN + NO + OP is indeed sqrt(85)/4. Therefore, the minimal value is sqrt(85)/4.But the problem states the square has side length 1, so all coordinates and distances are in that unit.Therefore, the minimum value is sqrt(85)/4, which is the final answer.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( MN + NO + OP ) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{85}}{4}}).&lt;/think&gt;In a square (ABCD) with side length 1, points (M), (N), (O), (P) are on sides (AB), (BC), (CD), (DA) respectively. Given (AM = BM) and (DP = 3AP), we need to find the minimum value of (MN + NO + OP).1. Coordinates of Points:   - (M) is the midpoint of (AB), so (M = left(frac{1}{2}, 0right)).   - (P) is on (DA) such that (DP = 3AP), so (P = (0, 0.25)).2. Reflection Method:   - Reflect point (P) over (CD) (the line (y = 1)) to get (P_1 = (0, 1.75)).   - Reflect (P_1) over (BC) (the line (x = 1)) to get (P_2 = (2, 1.75)).3. Straight Line Path:   - The shortest path from (M) to (P_2) passing through (BC) and (CD) in the original square corresponds to the straight line in the reflected coordinate system.   - The coordinates of intersections with (BC) and (CD) give the points (N) and (O).4. Calculations:   - The straight line distance from (Mleft(frac{1}{2}, 0right)) to (P_2(2, 1.75)) is calculated as:     [     sqrt{left(2 - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + (1.75 - 0)^2} = sqrt{left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{7}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{9}{4} + frac{49}{16}} = sqrt{frac{36}{16} + frac{49}{16}} = sqrt{frac{85}{16}} = frac{sqrt{85}}{4}     ]5. Conclusion:   - The minimum value of (MN + NO + OP) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{85}}{4}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b69fb8c6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b69fb8c6><span class="icon" data-v-b69fb8c6>🔑:</span>6.
