the equation of a hyperbola centered at the origin. The problem states that the hyperbola has its right focus at (2, 0) and a real axis length of 2√3. Then, part two involves finding the range of k for a line that intersects the left branch of the hyperbola at two points. Let me start with part one first.First, recalling the standard form of a hyperbola. Since the foci are on the x-axis (since one focus is at (2,0) and it&#39;s centered at the origin), the standard form should be (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1. Here, &#39;a&#39; is the distance from the center to each vertex along the x-axis, and &#39;c&#39; is the distance from the center to each focus. The relationship between a, b, and c for hyperbolas is c² = a² + b².The real axis length is the length of the transverse axis, which is 2a. So, if the real axis length is 2√3, then 2a = 2√3, so a = √3. Got that.We also know that the right focus is at (2,0), so c = 2. Since c is the distance from the center to the focus, and the hyperbola is centered at the origin, c = 2. Now, using the relationship c² = a² + b², we can solve for b².Given that a = √3, a² = (√3)² = 3. c² = 2² = 4. So, 4 = 3 + b². Therefore, b² = 4 - 3 = 1. So, b = 1.Therefore, plugging back into the standard equation: (x²)/3 - (y²)/1 = 1. Simplifying, that&#39;s x²/3 - y² = 1. So that&#39;s the equation of hyperbola C. Let me double-check. The center is at (0,0), foci at (±2,0), vertices at (±√3, 0). That makes sense since the distance from center to vertex is a = √3, and distance from center to focus is c = 2. And since c &gt; a for hyperbolas, which it is here (2 &gt; √3 ≈1.732), that checks out. So part (1) seems done. The equation is x²/3 - y² = 1.Moving on to part (2): The line l: y = kx + √2 intersects the left branch of the hyperbola C at points A and B. Find the range of k.First, the hyperbola has two branches. The left branch corresponds to x ≤ -a, which is x ≤ -√3. The right branch is x ≥ √3. Since the line intersects the left branch at two points, the system of equations (the hyperbola and the line) should have two real solutions, both with x ≤ -√3.So, we need to substitute y = kx + √2 into the hyperbola equation and find for which k there are two real solutions, and then ensure that both solutions are on the left branch.Let me substitute y into the hyperbola equation:x²/3 - (kx + √2)² = 1.Expanding the (kx + √2)² term: (k²x² + 2kx√2 + 2).So, substituting back into the equation:x²/3 - [k²x² + 2√2 kx + 2] = 1.Let me distribute the negative sign:x²/3 - k²x² - 2√2 kx - 2 = 1.Combine like terms:x²(1/3 - k²) - 2√2 kx - 3 = 0.Multiply through by 3 to eliminate the denominator (to make it easier):x²(1 - 3k²) - 6√2 kx - 9 = 0.So, this is a quadratic in x: [1 - 3k²]x² - [6√2 k]x - 9 = 0.Let me denote the coefficients as:A = 1 - 3k²,B = -6√2 k,C = -9.For the quadratic equation Ax² + Bx + C = 0 to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. However, since we need two distinct intersection points (points A and B), the discriminant must be positive. Also, both solutions must correspond to x ≤ -√3. So, first, discriminant &gt; 0, and second, both roots are ≤ -√3.So, first step: compute discriminant D = B² - 4AC.Compute D:D = (-6√2 k)^2 - 4*(1 - 3k²)*(-9).Compute each term:First term: (-6√2 k)^2 = 36*(2)*k² = 72k².Second term: -4*(1 - 3k²)*(-9) = -4*(-9)*(1 - 3k²) = 36*(1 - 3k²).Therefore, D = 72k² + 36*(1 - 3k²) = 72k² + 36 - 108k² = (72k² - 108k²) + 36 = (-36k²) + 36 = 36(1 - k²).So discriminant D = 36(1 - k²). For real and distinct solutions, we need D &gt; 0. So:36(1 - k²) &gt; 0 ⇒ 1 - k² &gt; 0 ⇒ k² &lt; 1 ⇒ |k| &lt; 1. So initially, k must be between -1 and 1. But we also need both roots to be ≤ -√3.Wait, but hyperbola left branch is x ≤ -√3, so the x-coordinates of the intersection points must satisfy x ≤ -√3. Therefore, we need both roots of the quadratic in x to be ≤ -√3.So, in the quadratic equation Ax² + Bx + C = 0, with A = 1 - 3k², B = -6√2 k, C = -9, the roots x1 and x2 must satisfy x1 ≤ -√3 and x2 ≤ -√3.To find the conditions for both roots to be ≤ -√3, we can use the following criteria for quadratic equations:1. The quadratic must open upwards or downwards depending on the coefficient A. If A &gt; 0, it opens upwards; if A &lt; 0, it opens downward. However, since we need both roots to be ≤ -√3, the direction of the parabola affects the conditions.2. The vertex of the parabola must lie to the left of -√3.3. The quadratic evaluated at x = -√3 must be ≥ 0 if the parabola opens upwards (since the vertex is to the left, and the parabola opens upwards, the function is increasing to the right of the vertex, so if f(-√3) ≥ 0, then all x ≤ -√3 will have f(x) ≥ 0). Wait, but actually, since we have the equation Ax² + Bx + C = 0, and we want both roots to be ≤ -√3, the conditions are:For A &gt; 0:- The quadratic must have two real roots.- The axis of symmetry must be ≤ -√3.- f(-√3) ≥ 0.For A &lt; 0:- The quadratic must have two real roots.- The axis of symmetry must be ≤ -√3.- f(-√3) ≤ 0.But since the quadratic equation here is [1 - 3k²]x² -6√2 kx -9 = 0, the coefficient A is 1 - 3k².So first, let&#39;s check the leading coefficient A = 1 - 3k².Case 1: A &gt; 0 ⇒ 1 - 3k² &gt; 0 ⇒ k² &lt; 1/3 ⇒ |k| &lt; 1/√3 ≈ 0.577.Case 2: A &lt; 0 ⇒ k² &gt; 1/3 ⇒ |k| &gt; 1/√3.But we already have from the discriminant that |k| &lt; 1, so combining with Case 2, we have 1/√3 &lt; |k| &lt; 1.Now, depending on the case, the conditions for both roots ≤ -√3 differ.So let&#39;s handle each case.First, let&#39;s write the quadratic equation as:(1 - 3k²)x² -6√2 kx -9 = 0.Let me denote the quadratic function as f(x) = (1 - 3k²)x² -6√2 kx -9.We need both roots of f(x) = 0 to be ≤ -√3.Let&#39;s recall the conditions for both roots to be ≤ some value m (here m = -√3).For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0:1. The equation has real roots: discriminant D ≥ 0.2. The sum of the roots, -b/a, is ≤ 2m (since the average of the roots is -b/(2a) ≤ m).3. The product of the roots, c/a, is ≥ m² (if a &gt; 0) or ≤ m² (if a &lt; 0). Wait, actually, when a &gt; 0, for both roots ≤ m, then f(m) ≥ 0 because the parabola opens upwards and if both roots are left of m, then f(m) is positive. Similarly, if a &lt; 0, the parabola opens downward, and f(m) ≤ 0.Alternatively, perhaps another way to think is:If the quadratic has two real roots, then both roots are ≤ m if and only if:1. The quadratic has real roots (D ≥ 0).2. The axis of symmetry is ≤ m.3. f(m) has the same sign as the leading coefficient (if a &gt; 0, f(m) ≥ 0; if a &lt; 0, f(m) ≤ 0).So, applying that here, m = -√3.So, first, we have already discriminant D = 36(1 - k²) &gt; 0 ⇒ |k| &lt; 1.Second, the axis of symmetry for the quadratic f(x) is x = -B/(2A) = (6√2 k)/(2(1 - 3k²)) = (3√2 k)/(1 - 3k²). Wait, B is -6√2 k, so -B/(2A) is (6√2 k)/(2*(1 - 3k²)) = (3√2 k)/(1 - 3k²). So the axis of symmetry is x = (3√2 k)/(1 - 3k²). We need this axis of symmetry to be ≤ -√3.So, (3√2 k)/(1 - 3k²) ≤ -√3.Third, f(-√3) should be ≥ 0 if A &gt; 0, and ≤ 0 if A &lt; 0.So let&#39;s handle these conditions.First, let&#39;s split into cases based on the leading coefficient A.Case 1: A &gt; 0, i.e., 1 - 3k² &gt; 0 ⇒ |k| &lt; 1/√3 ≈ 0.577.In this case, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, to have both roots ≤ -√3, we need:1. The axis of symmetry ≤ -√3.2. f(-√3) ≥ 0.Case 2: A &lt; 0, i.e., |k| &gt; 1/√3.In this case, the parabola opens downward. Therefore, to have both roots ≤ -√3, we need:1. The axis of symmetry ≤ -√3.2. f(-√3) ≤ 0.So, let&#39;s handle each case.Starting with Case 1: A &gt; 0 (|k| &lt; 1/√3)First, compute the axis of symmetry:x = (3√2 k)/(1 - 3k²). We need this ≤ -√3.So:(3√2 k)/(1 - 3k²) ≤ -√3.Multiply both sides by (1 - 3k²). But since A = 1 - 3k² &gt; 0 in this case, multiplying doesn&#39;t change the inequality direction. So:3√2 k ≤ -√3 (1 - 3k²)Bring all terms to the left:3√2 k + √3 (1 - 3k²) ≤ 0.Factor out √3:√3 [ (3√2 / √3)k + (1 - 3k²) ] ≤ 0.Simplify (3√2 / √3) = 3*(√6 / 3) = √6. Wait, let&#39;s see:√2 / √3 = √(2/3). So 3*(√2 / √3) = 3*√(2/3) = √(9*(2/3)) = √6. Yes.Therefore:√3 [ √6 k + 1 - 3k² ] ≤ 0.Since √3 &gt; 0, we can divide both sides by √3:√6 k + 1 - 3k² ≤ 0.Rearranged:-3k² + √6 k + 1 ≤ 0.Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):3k² - √6 k - 1 ≥ 0.Solve 3k² - √6 k - 1 ≥ 0.This is a quadratic in k. Let&#39;s find its roots.Discriminant D&#39; = ( -√6 )² - 4*3*(-1) = 6 + 12 = 18.So roots are [ √6 ± √18 ] / (2*3) = [ √6 ± 3√2 ] / 6.Simplify √18 = 3√2.So:First root: [√6 + 3√2]/6Second root: [√6 - 3√2]/6Approximate values:√6 ≈ 2.45, √2 ≈ 1.414, so 3√2 ≈ 4.242.First root: (2.45 + 4.242)/6 ≈ 6.692/6 ≈ 1.115Second root: (2.45 - 4.242)/6 ≈ (-1.792)/6 ≈ -0.299.So the quadratic 3k² - √6 k - 1 is ≥ 0 when k ≤ [√6 - 3√2]/6 ≈ -0.299 or k ≥ [√6 + 3√2]/6 ≈ 1.115.But in Case 1, |k| &lt; 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. So the interval where 3k² - √6 k -1 ≥ 0 in this context is k ≤ -0.299. However, since k must also satisfy |k| &lt; 1/√3 ≈0.577, the valid interval here is k ≤ -0.299, but since [√6 - 3√2]/6 is approximately -0.299, so k ≤ [√6 - 3√2]/6.But we need to write exact expressions, not decimal approximations.Note that [√6 - 3√2]/6 can be written as (√6 - 3√2)/6.But let&#39;s see if we can simplify it:√6 = √(2*3) = √2√3, 3√2 = 3√2.So:(√2√3 - 3√2)/6 = √2(√3 - 3)/6 = (√3 - 3)/ (6/√2) ) Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, factor √2:= √2(√3 - 3)/6 = (√3 - 3)/ (6/√2) ) Not sure. Maybe leave as is.So, in Case 1, where |k| &lt; 1/√3, the condition 3k² - √6 k -1 ≥ 0 holds when k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6 ≈ -0.299. So combining with |k| &lt; 1/√3 ≈ 0.577, the valid k in Case 1 is k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6 and |k| &lt; 1/√3. Since (√6 - 3√2)/6 ≈ -0.299, which is greater than -1/√3 ≈ -0.577, so the interval is (√6 - 3√2)/6 ≤ k &lt; 1/√3. Wait, no: original inequality is 3k² - √6 k -1 ≥ 0. So k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6 or k ≥ (√6 + 3√2)/6. But in Case 1, |k| &lt; 1/√3 ≈0.577, and (√6 + 3√2)/6 ≈1.115, which is outside the Case 1 range, so only k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6. Therefore, in Case 1, the solution is k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6.But we need to check if this is within |k| &lt;1/√3. Since (√6 - 3√2)/6 ≈ -0.299, which is greater than -1/√3 ≈ -0.577. So the valid k in Case 1 is -1/√3 &lt; k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6. Wait, but (√6 - 3√2)/6 is approximately -0.299, which is greater than -0.577. So the interval is from -1/√3 up to (√6 - 3√2)/6. But since the inequality in Case 1 is 3k² - √6 k -1 ≥ 0 which gives k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6 or k ≥ (√6 + 3√2)/6. But in Case 1, we have |k| &lt; 1/√3 ≈0.577. So only the k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6 part is valid here. So the k&#39;s in Case 1 that satisfy the axis of symmetry condition are k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6. However, since in Case 1, k is between -1/√3 and 1/√3, and (√6 - 3√2)/6 ≈-0.299 is greater than -1/√3 ≈-0.577, so the actual interval is -1/√3 &lt; k ≤ (√6 - 3√2)/6.Additionally, in Case 1, we also need f(-√3) ≥ 0. Let&#39;s compute f(-√3):f(-√3) = (1 - 3k²)(-√3)^2 -6√2 k*(-√3) -9.Compute term by term:(-√3)^2 = 3.So:(1 - 3k²)*3 -6√2 k*(-√3) -9.Simplify:3(1 - 3k²) + 6√2*√3 k -9.Simplify each term:3 - 9k² + 6√6 k -9.Combine constants: 3 -9 = -6.So:-6 -9k² +6√6 k.Therefore, f(-√3) = -9k² +6√6 k -6.We need this to be ≥0 (since A &gt;0 in Case1).So:-9k² +6√6 k -6 ≥0.Multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):9k² -6√6 k +6 ≤0.Divide by 3:3k² -2√6 k +2 ≤0.Solve 3k² -2√6 k +2 ≤0.Find discriminant:D&#39;&#39; = (-2√6)^2 -4*3*2 = 24 -24 =0.So discriminant is zero, so quadratic touches the x-axis at k = [2√6]/(2*3) = √6/3 ≈0.816.Therefore, 3k² -2√6 k +2 is a perfect square: (√3 k - √2 )² *3? Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, 3k² -2√6 k +2.Let me factor it:Assume it&#39;s (a k - b)^2 = a²k² - 2abk + b².Comparing:a² =3, so a=√3.2ab = 2√6 ⇒ ab=√6. Since a=√3, then b=√6 /√3= √2.Therefore, (√3 k - √2)^2 = 3k² -2√6 k +2. Exactly. So the quadratic is (√3 k - √2)^2 ≤0.But square is always ≥0, so equality holds only when √3 k - √2 =0 ⇒k=√2/√3=√(2/3)=√6/3≈0.816.But the inequality (√3 k - √2)^2 ≤0 only holds when k=√6/3. However, in our Case 1, |k| &lt;1/√3≈0.577, and √6/3≈0.816 is outside this range. Therefore, in Case1, 3k² -2√6 k +2 ≤0 has no solution. Therefore, f(-√3) ≥0 has no solution in Case1. Therefore, there are no solutions in Case1.Therefore, even though we had k ≤ (√6 -3√2)/6 ≈-0.299 in Case1, the condition f(-√3) ≥0 cannot be satisfied in this case. Therefore, Case1 yields no valid k.Now, moving on to Case2: A &lt;0, i.e., |k| &gt;1/√3≈0.577. But we still have |k| &lt;1 from discriminant condition. So, 1/√3 &lt; |k| &lt;1.In this case, the parabola opens downward (since A =1 -3k² &lt;0). Therefore, to have both roots ≤ -√3, we need:1. The axis of symmetry ≤ -√3.2. f(-√3) ≤0.Let&#39;s check the axis of symmetry first:x = (3√2 k)/(1 -3k²). But since A &lt;0, denominator 1 -3k² &lt;0. So, x = (3√2 k)/(negative number). So x is negative if k is positive, and positive if k is negative. Wait, let&#39;s think.Wait, if |k| &gt;1/√3, then k can be positive or negative. Let&#39;s split into k &gt;1/√3 and k &lt; -1/√3.But since we have |k| &lt;1 overall, so 1/√3 &lt;k&lt;1 or -1 &lt;k&lt; -1/√3.First, let&#39;s consider k positive: 1/√3 &lt;k&lt;1.Then, x = (3√2 k)/(1 -3k²). Since denominator 1 -3k² &lt;0 (because 3k² &gt;1), and numerator 3√2 k &gt;0, so overall x is negative. Similarly, if k is negative: -1 &lt;k&lt; -1/√3, then numerator 3√2 k is negative, denominator 1 -3k² is negative (since 3k² &gt;1), so x is positive (negative divided by negative). Wait, so:For k &gt;1/√3, axis of symmetry x is negative.For k &lt; -1/√3, axis of symmetry x is positive.But we need the axis of symmetry to be ≤ -√3. So for k &gt;1/√3, since x is negative, it&#39;s possible. For k &lt; -1/√3, x is positive, which can&#39;t be ≤ -√3. Therefore, in Case2, only k &gt;1/√3 are candidates for axis of symmetry ≤ -√3. The k &lt; -1/√3 will have axis of symmetry positive, which cannot satisfy ≤ -√3.Therefore, in Case2, we only need to consider 1/√3 &lt;k&lt;1.So, for 1/√3 &lt;k &lt;1, compute the axis of symmetry:x = (3√2 k)/(1 -3k²). Since denominator is negative (1 -3k² &lt;0), and numerator positive (k&gt;0), so x is negative. We need x ≤ -√3.Therefore:(3√2 k)/(1 -3k²) ≤ -√3.Multiply both sides by (1 -3k²). But since denominator is negative (as 1 -3k² &lt;0), multiplying both sides reverses inequality direction:3√2 k ≥ -√3 (1 -3k²).Simplify:3√2 k ≥ -√3 +3√3 k².Bring all terms to left:3√2 k +√3 -3√3 k² ≥0.Factor out √3:√3 [ (3√2 /√3 )k +1 -3k² ] ≥0.Simplify (3√2 /√3 ) = 3*(√6 /3 )= √6.So:√3 [ √6 k +1 -3k² ] ≥0.Divide both sides by √3 (positive, so inequality direction remains):√6 k +1 -3k² ≥0.Rearrange:-3k² +√6 k +1 ≥0.Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):3k² -√6 k -1 ≤0.This is the same quadratic as in Case1: 3k² -√6 k -1 ≤0.From earlier, the roots are k = [√6 ±3√2]/6≈ [2.45±4.24]/6, which gave roots≈1.115 and ≈-0.299.So, the inequality 3k² -√6 k -1 ≤0 holds between the roots: -0.299 ≤k ≤1.115.But in our current case, k is in (1/√3≈0.577,1). Therefore, the overlap is 0.577 &lt;k ≤1.115. But since in this case k &lt;1, the valid interval is 0.577 &lt;k &lt;1.But let&#39;s write exact expressions. The roots are (√6 +3√2)/6 and (√6 -3√2)/6. So the inequality holds between (√6 -3√2)/6 ≈-0.299 and (√6 +3√2)/6≈1.115. Since we are in the case k &gt;1/√3≈0.577, the overlap is (1/√3, (√6 +3√2)/6 ). Wait, but (√6 +3√2)/6≈1.115, which is greater than1. However, from discriminant condition, k must be less than1. So the valid interval is (1/√3,1). But we need to check if between 1/√3 and1, 3k² -√6 k -1 ≤0 holds.Wait, let&#39;s test k=1. At k=1:3(1)^2 -√6(1) -1=3 -√6 -1≈2 -2.45≈-0.45&lt;0. So at k=1, the inequality holds.At k=1/√3≈0.577:3*(1/3) -√6*(1/√3) -1=1 - (√6/√3) -1= -√2≈-1.414&lt;0. So at k=1/√3, the value is negative.But the quadratic 3k² -√6 k -1 is a parabola opening upwards (coefficient 3&gt;0). So between its roots (approx -0.299 and1.115), the quadratic is ≤0. Therefore, in the interval (1/√3,1), which is within ( -0.299,1.115), the quadratic is ≤0. Therefore, the inequality 3k² -√6 k -1 ≤0 holds for all k in (1/√3,1). Therefore, in Case2, the axis of symmetry condition is automatically satisfied for k in (1/√3,1).Wait, but we derived the axis of symmetry condition leading to 3k² -√6 k -1 ≤0, which is already true for k in (1/√3,1). Therefore, in Case2, for 1/√3 &lt;k &lt;1, the axis of symmetry is ≤ -√3.Now, check the second condition: f(-√3) ≤0 (since A &lt;0 in Case2).Compute f(-√3):As before, f(-√3) = -9k² +6√6 k -6. But in Case2, we need this to be ≤0.So:-9k² +6√6 k -6 ≤0.Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):9k² -6√6 k +6 ≥0.Divide by 3:3k² -2√6 k +2 ≥0.Again, same as in Case1, this is (√3 k -√2)^2 ≥0. Which is always true since a square is non-negative. Therefore, this inequality holds for all real k. So, in Case2, the condition f(-√3) ≤0 reduces to 9k² -6√6 k +6 ≥0, which is always true. Therefore, in Case2 (1/√3 &lt;k &lt;1), both conditions (axis of symmetry and f(-√3) ≤0) are satisfied. Therefore, all k in (1/√3,1) satisfy the requirements.But wait, the original problem states that the line intersects the left branch at two points. So, the hyperbola&#39;s left branch is x ≤ -√3. But in Case2, when A &lt;0 (parabola opens downward), and we have two intersection points. But since the parabola opens downward, it can intersect the hyperbola in two points on the left branch only if the vertex is to the left and the parabola is high enough. Wait, but given that the quadratic equation in x has two real roots, both ≤ -√3. Since we already satisfied the axis of symmetry and f(-√3) ≤0, and A &lt;0, the parabola opens downward, so the intersections are on both sides of the vertex. But since the vertex is at x = (3√2 k)/(1 -3k²) which we have already forced to be ≤ -√3, and the parabola opens downward, then both roots are to the left of the vertex, so x ≤ -√3.Therefore, in Case2, for 1/√3 &lt;k &lt;1, the line intersects the left branch at two points. Hence, the range of k is 1/√3 &lt;k &lt;1. But we need to check the negative k as well.Wait, earlier when we considered Case2, we split into positive and negative k. For negative k, between -1 and -1/√3, but we saw that the axis of symmetry would be positive, so can&#39;t be ≤ -√3. Therefore, negative k in that range don&#39;t satisfy the axis of symmetry condition. Therefore, only positive k in (1/√3,1) are valid.Wait, but wait, let me check with a negative k. Let&#39;s take k negative, say k=-0.7 (which is in -1 &lt;k &lt; -1/√3≈-0.577). Then compute axis of symmetry:x=(3√2*(-0.7))/(1 -3*(0.49)).Compute denominator:1 -3*(0.49)=1-1.47=-0.47.So x= (3√2*(-0.7))/(-0.47)≈( -2.97 ) / (-0.47)≈6.32, which is positive, hence cannot be ≤ -√3. Therefore, for negative k in Case2, axis of symmetry is positive, which doesn&#39;t satisfy the requirement. Therefore, negative k&#39;s in Case2 don&#39;t work. Hence, only positive k in (1/√3,1) work.But let me check with a sample k in that range. Take k=0.8 (which is between1/√3≈0.577 and1). Then, compute the quadratic equation:A=1 -3*(0.64)=1 -1.92=-0.92,B=-6√2*0.8≈-6*1.414*0.8≈-6.787,C=-9.Equation: -0.92x² -6.787x -9=0.Multiply by -1: 0.92x² +6.787x +9=0.Compute discriminant:(6.787)^2 -4*0.92*9≈46.07 -33.12≈12.95&gt;0, so two real roots.Compute roots:x = [ -6.787 ±√12.95 ]/(2*0.92)≈[ -6.787 ±3.6 ]/1.84.First root: (-6.787 +3.6)/1.84≈(-3.187)/1.84≈-1.73.Second root: (-6.787 -3.6)/1.84≈(-10.387)/1.84≈-5.64.Wait, both roots are negative. But -1.73 is approximately -√3≈-1.732. So the first root is≈-1.73, which is ≈-√3, and the second root is≈-5.64.But the hyperbola&#39;s left branch is x ≤-√3≈-1.732. Therefore, x≈-1.73 is at x≈-√3, which is the vertex of the hyperbola. So the intersection at x≈-1.73 is actually the vertex. But since the hyperbola is not including x &gt;-√3, but the line could be tangent here. Wait, but discriminant was≈12.95&gt;0, so two distinct points.Wait, maybe my approximated calculation is causing confusion. Let&#39;s do it more precisely.Take k=√3/3≈0.577, which is the boundary 1/√3. Then, A=1 -3*(1/3)=0. So the quadratic becomes 0x² -6√2*(√3/3)x -9=0 ⇒ -2√6 x -9=0 ⇒x= -9/(2√6)≈-9/4.899≈-1.837, which is less than -√3≈-1.732. So x≈-1.837 is on the left branch.Wait, but when k approaches1/√3 from above, A approaches0 from below. So for k slightly larger than1/√3, A is negative but close to0. Therefore, the quadratic equation becomes very steep parabola opening downward, intersecting the hyperbola at two points far apart. But as k increases towards1, A becomes more negative, making the parabola less steep.But according to our previous analysis, for k in (1/√3,1), the quadratic equation has two real roots, both ≤-√3.Wait, in my example with k=0.8, the roots were≈-1.73 and≈-5.64. But -1.73 is≈-√3, but in the hyperbola, the left branch is x ≤-√3. So x=-1.73 is exactly at the vertex. But the hyperbola&#39;s left vertex is at x=-√3≈-1.732. Therefore, if the line intersects at x≈-1.73, which is≈-√3, then it&#39;s tangent to the hyperbola? But no, discriminant was positive, so two distinct points. Wait, perhaps the approximation is causing confusion. Let&#39;s compute more accurately.Let me take k=0.8 and compute the exact roots.The quadratic equation is:(1 -3*(0.8)^2)x² -6√2*(0.8)x -9=0.Compute coefficients:1 -3*0.64=1 -1.92= -0.92.-6√2*0.8= -4.8√2≈-4.8*1.414≈-6.787.So equation: -0.92x² -6.787x -9=0.Multiply by -1: 0.92x² +6.787x +9=0.Compute discriminant:(6.787)^2 -4*0.92*9=46.07 -33.12=12.95.sqrt(12.95)≈3.6.Roots:x = [ -6.787 ±3.6 ] / (2*0.92)= [ -6.787 ±3.6 ] /1.84.First root: (-6.787 +3.6)/1.84≈(-3.187)/1.84≈-1.73.Second root: (-6.787 -3.6)/1.84≈(-10.387)/1.84≈-5.64.But x=-1.73 is≈-√3≈-1.732, so actually, the intersection at x≈-1.73 is at the vertex of the hyperbola. However, the vertex is part of the hyperbola, so the line passes through the vertex and another point further left. Therefore, in this case, one point is the vertex (x=-√3) and the other is further left (x≈-5.64). But since the problem states &quot;intersects the left branch at points A and B&quot;, which are two distinct points. If one of them is the vertex, is that considered a valid intersection? The problem says &quot;intersects... at points A and B&quot;, implying two distinct points. Therefore, we need to ensure that both roots are strictly less than -√3, not equal to.Therefore, when k=1/√3, the line is tangent to the hyperbola at x=-√3. Because substituting k=1/√3 into the quadratic equation:A=1 -3*(1/3)=0, so equation becomes linear: -6√2*(1/√3)x -9=0 ⇒ -6√(2/3)x -9=0 ⇒x= -9/(6√(2/3))= - (3)/(2√(2/3))= - (3√3)/(2√2). Compute this value:√3/√2=√(3/2), so x= - (3√(3/2))/2≈-3*1.2247/2≈-1.837, which is less than -√3≈-1.732. So even at k=1/√3, the line intersects the hyperbola at x≈-1.837, which is on the left branch. Wait, but when k=1/√3, the quadratic equation reduces to a linear equation, so only one intersection point? Wait, no: when A=0, the equation is linear, so one solution. But we are supposed to have two points A and B. Therefore, when k=1/√3, the line is tangent to the hyperbola? Wait, but in the calculation above, substituting k=1/√3, we have a linear equation leading to one solution x≈-1.837, which is on the left branch. But the original quadratic equation, when A approaches zero, one root goes to infinity. Wait, perhaps confusion arises here.Wait, when A approaches zero from the negative side (k approaching1/√3 from above), the quadratic equation&#39;s leading coefficient approaches zero from below, so one root approaches the finite solution of the linear equation (when A=0), and the other root goes to negative infinity. Wait, in reality, when A becomes zero, the equation is linear, so one root, but near A=0, one root is very large in magnitude. Wait, but in our example with k=0.8, we had two roots, one near -√3 and another at≈-5.64. So as k approaches1/√3 from above, one root approaches the linear solution, which is≈-1.837 (which is &lt; -√3≈-1.732), and the other root tends to -infinity? Wait, no, when k approaches1/√3 from above, the quadratic equation becomes:(1 -3k²)x² -6√2 kx -9=0.As k approaches1/√3, 1 -3k² approaches0 from below (negative), so A approaches0 from the negative side.So, let me write the equation as:A x² + Bx + C=0, where A≈0-.Then, the roots are x=(-B ±√(B² -4AC))/(2A).As A approaches0-, the term √(B² -4AC)≈√(B² -0)=|B|. So, for A approaching0-:One root is [ -B + |B| ]/(2A). Since B is negative (B= -6√2 k, k positive in this case), so |B|= -B.Therefore:First root: [ -B + (-B) ]/(2A)= (-2B)/(2A)= (-B)/A.Since A is approaching0-, and B is negative, (-B)/A= positive / negative= negative. So this root approaches negative infinity.Second root: [ -B - |B| ]/(2A)= [ -B - (-B) ]/(2A)=0/(2A)=0. Wait, but this can&#39;t be. Wait, perhaps I&#39;m missing something.Wait, let&#39;s do it more carefully.Let me denote A=1-3k²=ε, where ε approaches0 from below (ε &lt;0).Then, B= -6√2 k≈-6√2*(1/√3)= -6√(2/3)= -2√6.So, the equation is ε x² -2√6 x -9=0.Roots:x = [2√6 ±√( ( -2√6 )² -4*ε*(-9) ) ]/(2ε).Compute discriminant:(24) -4*ε*(-9)=24 +36ε.As ε approaches0-, discriminant approaches24.Therefore, roots:x ≈ [2√6 ±√24 ]/(2ε).√24=2√6≈4.899.So:First root: [2√6 +2√6]/(2ε)= (4√6)/(2ε)= (2√6)/ε. Since ε approaches0-, this root approaches negative infinity.Second root: [2√6 -2√6]/(2ε)=0/(2ε)=0. Wait, but substituting back into the equation, when x=0, we have ε*0 + B*0 +C= C= -9 ≠0. So this is contradictory.Ah, the issue is that when A approaches0, the approximation breaks down. Actually, the second root is:x= [ -B -√(B² -4AC) ]/(2A).So, with A=ε≈0-,x= [2√6 -√(24 +36ε) ]/(2ε).Expand √(24 +36ε)=√24 *√(1 + (36ε)/24)=√24*(1 + (3ε)/2 + ... )≈√24 + (3ε)/ (2*√24).Therefore,x≈[2√6 - (√24 + (3ε)/(2√24)) ]/(2ε)= [2√6 - 2√6 - (3ε)/(2√24) ]/(2ε)= [ - (3ε)/(2√24) ]/(2ε)= -3/(4√24)= -3/(4*2√6)= -3/(8√6).So as ε approaches0-, x approaches -3/(8√6)≈-0.153. But this is finite. However, since the denominator is approaching0-, perhaps another approach is needed. But this might be getting too technical.In practice, when k approaches1/√3 from above, one root of the quadratic equation goes to -∞, and the other approaches a finite value. Wait, but in our example with k=0.8, we had roots at≈-1.73 and≈-5.64. So as k increases towards1, the roots move. Wait, but when k=1, A=1-3= -2, B=-6√2*1≈-8.485, C=-9.Equation: -2x² -8.485x -9=0. Multiply by -1:2x² +8.485x +9=0.Discriminant: (8.485)^2 -4*2*9≈72 -72=0. Wait, discriminant D= ( -6√2 )^2 -4*( -2 )* (-9 )=72 -72=0. So at k=1, discriminant D=0, so the line is tangent to the hyperbola. Therefore, at k=1, there&#39;s only one intersection point. Therefore, as k approaches1 from below, the two roots merge into one, meaning the line becomes tangent. Therefore, in the interval k ∈(1/√3,1), the line intersects the left branch at two distinct points when k ∈(1/√3,1). At k=1/√3, the quadratic becomes linear, intersecting at one point (x≈-1.837), which is on the left branch. But since the problem specifies two points A and B, k=1/√3 would not be included. Similarly, at k=1, the line is tangent, so also only one intersection point. Therefore, the range of k is open interval: (1/√3,1).But let me verify with k=1. If k=1, substituting into the equation:Equation of line: y= x +√2.Substitute into hyperbola x²/3 - y²=1:x²/3 - (x +√2)^2 =1.Expand: x²/3 -x² -2√2 x -2=1.Combine x² terms: (1/3 -1)x² -2√2 x -3=0 ⇒ (-2/3)x² -2√2 x -3=0.Multiply by -3: 2x² +6√2 x +9=0.Discriminant: (6√2)^2 -4*2*9=72 -72=0. So, repeated root.Roots: x= (-6√2)/(2*2)= (-3√2)/2≈-2.121. Which is less than -√3≈-1.732. So tangent at x≈-2.121, which is on the left branch. Therefore, at k=1, the line is tangent to the left branch. Therefore, to have two distinct points, k must be less than1. Similarly, at k=1/√3≈0.577, the quadratic equation becomes linear, giving one intersection point on the left branch. Therefore, to have two distinct points, k must be greater than1/√3. Therefore, the range of k is (1/√3,1). So the answer is 1/√3 &lt;k &lt;1. But need to write in exact terms.1/√3 can be rationalized as √3/3. So, the range is √3/3 &lt;k &lt;1.Therefore, the final answers:(1) The equation of hyperbola C is x²/3 - y² =1.(2) The range of k is (√3/3,1), which in boxed form is (dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1).But let me check once more for any miscalculations. Especially in the Case1 where we thought there might be solutions, but f(-√3) condition couldn&#39;t be satisfied. And in Case2, for k between√3/3 and1, all conditions satisfied. Therefore, the range is indeed √3/3 &lt;k &lt;1.Final Answer(1) The equation of the hyperbola ( C ) is (boxed{dfrac{x^2}{3} - y^2 = 1}).(2) The range of ( k ) is (boxed{left( dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1 right)}).&lt;/think&gt;Given a hyperbola ( C ) centered at the origin with its right focus at ( (2,0) ) and a real axis length of ( 2sqrt{3} ):1. Finding the equation of the hyperbola ( C ):   - The real axis length is ( 2sqrt{3} ), so ( 2a = 2sqrt{3} ) implies ( a = sqrt{3} ).   - The distance to the focus ( c = 2 ).   - Using the relationship ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), we have ( 4 = 3 + b^2 ), leading to ( b^2 = 1 ).   - Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is ( frac{x^2}{3} - y^2 = 1 ).2. Finding the range of ( k ) for the line ( l: y = kx + sqrt{2} ) intersecting the left branch of the hyperbola:   - Substitute ( y = kx + sqrt{2} ) into the hyperbola equation:     [     frac{x^2}{3} - (kx + sqrt{2})^2 = 1     ]   - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in ( x ):     [     (1 - 3k^2)x^2 - 6sqrt{2}kx - 9 = 0     ]   - For the line to intersect the left branch at two points, the quadratic must have two real roots with ( x leq -sqrt{3} ).   - The discriminant ( D = 36(1 - k^2) ) must be positive, leading to ( |k| &lt; 1 ).   - The axis of symmetry of the quadratic must be ( leq -sqrt{3} ) and the quadratic evaluated at ( x = -sqrt{3} ) must be non-negative or non-positive depending on the leading coefficient.   - After analyzing the conditions, the valid range for ( k ) is found to be ( left( frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1 right) ). Final Answers(1) The equation of the hyperbola ( C ) is (boxed{dfrac{x^2}{3} - y^2 = 1}).(2) The range of ( k ) is (boxed{left( dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1 right)}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this problem about a hyperbola. Let me try to work through it step by step. First, part (1) asks for the equation of hyperbola C, which is centered at the origin. They mention it has a right focus at (2,0) and a real axis length of 2√3. Hmm. Let me recall the standard form of a hyperbola. Since the center is at the origin and the focus is on the x-axis, this must be a horizontally oriented hyperbola. So the standard form should be (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1. The real axis length is the length of the transverse axis, which for a hyperbola is 2a. They say it&#39;s 2√3, so that means a = √3. So a² is (√3)² = 3. Now, we need to find b². For hyperbolas, the relationship between a, b, and c (the distance from the center to each focus) is c² = a² + b². The right focus is at (2,0), so c is 2. Therefore, c² = 4. We already have a² = 3, so plugging into the equation: 4 = 3 + b² → b² = 1. Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola should be (x²/3) - (y²/1) = 1, or simplified, x²/3 - y² = 1. Let me check that again. Yes, the transverse axis length is 2a = 2√3, which matches, and the foci are at (±c, 0) = (±2, 0), which also matches. So part (1) seems done.Now part (2): The line l: y = kx + √2 intersects the left branch of the hyperbola C at points A and B. We need to find the range of k. First, let&#39;s visualize this. The hyperbola has two branches, left and right. The left branch is where x ≤ -a, so x ≤ -√3. The line is y = kx + √2. We want this line to intersect the left branch at two distinct points. So we need to ensure that when we solve the system of equations, there are two real solutions with x ≤ -√3.Let me set up the equations. Substitute y = kx + √2 into the hyperbola equation:x²/3 - (kx + √2)² = 1.Expand the (kx + √2)² term: k²x² + 2k√2 x + 2.So substitute back in:x²/3 - (k²x² + 2k√2 x + 2) = 1.Multiply through by 3 to eliminate the denominator:x² - 3(k²x² + 2k√2 x + 2) = 3.Simplify:x² - 3k²x² - 6k√2 x - 6 = 3.Combine like terms:(1 - 3k²)x² - 6k√2 x - 9 = 0.So this is a quadratic in x: Ax² + Bx + C = 0, where:A = (1 - 3k²)B = -6k√2C = -9For this quadratic to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. But since we need two intersection points on the left branch, we need two real solutions, so discriminant must be positive. Also, both solutions must satisfy x ≤ -√3.First, let&#39;s compute the discriminant D:D = B² - 4AC = (-6k√2)² - 4*(1 - 3k²)*(-9)Calculate term by term:(-6k√2)^2 = 36k² * 2 = 72k²Then, -4AC: -4*(1 - 3k²)*(-9) = -4*(-9)*(1 - 3k²) = 36*(1 - 3k²)So D = 72k² + 36(1 - 3k²) = 72k² + 36 - 108k² = (72k² - 108k²) + 36 = (-36k²) + 36 = 36(1 - k²)For real solutions, D ≥ 0 → 36(1 - k²) ≥ 0 → 1 - k² ≥ 0 → k² ≤ 1 → -1 ≤ k ≤ 1.But we also need the line to intersect the left branch, which is x ≤ -√3. So even if the discriminant is positive, the roots have to be in x ≤ -√3. So we need to ensure that both solutions of the quadratic are ≤ -√3.For a quadratic equation Ax² + Bx + C = 0, with roots x1 and x2. To have both roots ≤ some value, say m, the following conditions must be satisfied:1. The quadratic must open upwards or downwards appropriately. So if A &gt; 0, the parabola opens upwards, so to have both roots ≤ m, the vertex should be to the left of m, and f(m) &gt; 0. Similarly, if A &lt; 0, the parabola opens downwards, so f(m) &gt; 0 and vertex x-coordinate ≤ m.But maybe another approach is better here. Let&#39;s recall that for both roots to be ≤ m, the following must hold:1. The quadratic has real roots (D ≥ 0).2. The smaller root (since A determines the direction) is ≤ m.But perhaps using the conditions:- The average of the roots is ≤ m.- And f(m) ≥ 0 (if A &gt; 0) or f(m) ≤ 0 (if A &lt; 0).Wait, maybe a better method is:Let’s consider the quadratic equation (1 - 3k²)x² -6k√2 x -9 = 0.Let’s denote f(x) = (1 - 3k²)x² -6k√2 x -9.We need both roots to be ≤ -√3. Let me recall that for both roots to be less than or equal to m, the following conditions must be satisfied (assuming A ≠ 0):1. The leading coefficient A and f(m) must have the same sign.2. The axis of symmetry is ≤ m.3. D ≥ 0.So applying these conditions:1. A*f(m) ≥ 0.But since A can be positive or negative, perhaps better phrased as:If A &gt; 0, then f(m) ≥ 0.If A &lt; 0, then f(m) ≤ 0.2. The axis of symmetry (x = -B/(2A)) ≤ m.3. D ≥ 0.So here, m = -√3.First, let&#39;s compute f(-√3):f(-√3) = (1 - 3k²)(-√3)^2 -6k√2*(-√3) -9Compute term by term:(-√3)^2 = 3.So first term: (1 - 3k²)*3 = 3 - 9k².Second term: -6k√2*(-√3) = 6k√2*√3 = 6k√6.Third term: -9.So f(-√3) = (3 - 9k²) + 6k√6 -9 = (3 -9) -9k² +6k√6 = -6 -9k² +6k√6.Therefore, f(-√3) = -9k² +6k√6 -6.Now, the leading coefficient A = (1 - 3k²). So depending on whether A is positive or negative, the sign of f(-√3) must be accordingly.Case 1: A &gt; 0 → 1 - 3k² &gt; 0 → 3k² &lt; 1 → k² &lt; 1/3 → |k| &lt; √(1/3) ≈ 0.577.In this case, since the parabola opens upwards (because A &gt; 0), we need f(-√3) ≥ 0 for both roots to be ≤ -√3. So:-9k² +6k√6 -6 ≥ 0Multiply both sides by -1 (reversing inequality):9k² -6k√6 +6 ≤ 0Divide both sides by 3:3k² -2k√6 +2 ≤ 0This is a quadratic in k: 3k² -2√6 k +2 ≤ 0.Compute discriminant D&#39; = ( -2√6 )² -4*3*2 = 24 -24 = 0.So D&#39; = 0, so the quadratic touches the k-axis at k = [2√6]/(2*3) = √6/3 ≈ 0.816.But 3k² -2√6 k +2 = 0 has a repeated root at k = √6/3. Therefore, the quadratic is always positive except at k = √6/3 where it is zero. Therefore, 3k² -2√6 k +2 ≤ 0 only when k = √6/3. But since in this case we have |k| &lt; √(1/3) ≈ 0.577, and √6/3 ≈ 0.816 is greater than √(1/3) ≈ 0.577, which is outside the current case. Therefore, there is no solution in this case. So when A &gt; 0, there are no k satisfying the required conditions.Case 2: A &lt; 0 → 1 - 3k² &lt; 0 → 3k² &gt; 1 → k² &gt; 1/3 → |k| &gt; √(1/3) ≈ 0.577.In this case, the parabola opens downwards (A &lt; 0). Therefore, to have both roots ≤ -√3, we need f(-√3) ≤ 0.So:-9k² +6k√6 -6 ≤ 0Which is equivalent to:-9k² +6k√6 -6 ≤ 0 → Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):9k² -6k√6 +6 ≥ 0.Again, same quadratic as before: 9k² -6k√6 +6 ≥ 0. Which factors to 3k² -2k√6 +2 ≥ 0, which we already saw has discriminant zero and is always non-negative, with equality only at k = √6/3. Therefore, 9k² -6k√6 +6 ≥ 0 is always true. Therefore, in this case (A &lt; 0), f(-√3) ≤ 0 is automatically true, since the original inequality was -9k² +6k√6 -6 ≤ 0, which is always true.But we also need to check the axis of symmetry condition. The axis of symmetry is x = -B/(2A). For our quadratic, A = (1 - 3k²), B = -6k√2. So:x = -B/(2A) = -(-6k√2)/(2*(1 - 3k²)) = (6k√2)/(2*(1 - 3k²)) = (3k√2)/(1 - 3k²).But since we are in case 2, A = (1 - 3k²) &lt; 0. So 1 - 3k² is negative. Therefore, the denominator is negative. So:x = (3k√2)/(negative).So the axis of symmetry x depends on the sign of k.But we need the axis of symmetry to be ≤ -√3. Let&#39;s write:(3k√2)/(1 - 3k²) ≤ -√3.But since 1 - 3k² &lt; 0 (from case 2), we can multiply both sides by (1 - 3k²), which is negative, so inequality reverses:3k√2 ≥ -√3*(1 - 3k²)But let&#39;s compute:(3k√2)/(1 - 3k²) ≤ -√3Multiply both sides by (1 - 3k²), which is negative, so inequality reverses:3k√2 ≥ -√3*(1 - 3k²)Divide both sides by √3:3k√2 / √3 ≥ -(1 - 3k²)Simplify √2/√3 = √(2/3):3k * √(2/3) ≥ -1 + 3k²Multiply both sides by √3/√3 to rationalize:3k * √2 / √3 ≥ -1 + 3k²Simplify 3/√3 = √3:k * √3 * √2 ≥ -1 + 3k²Which is:k * √6 ≥ -1 + 3k²Rearrange:3k² - √6 k -1 ≤ 0So now, we have a quadratic inequality in k: 3k² - √6 k -1 ≤ 0Let me compute the discriminant D&#39;&#39; for this quadratic:D&#39;&#39; = (-√6)^2 -4*3*(-1) = 6 +12 = 18Roots are:k = [√6 ± √18]/(2*3) = [√6 ± 3√2]/6Simplify √18 = 3√2, so:k = [√6 + 3√2]/6 and k = [√6 - 3√2]/6Compute approximate values:√6 ≈ 2.449, √2 ≈ 1.414So first root: (2.449 + 3*1.414)/6 ≈ (2.449 + 4.242)/6 ≈ 6.691/6 ≈ 1.115Second root: (2.449 - 4.242)/6 ≈ (-1.793)/6 ≈ -0.299Therefore, the quadratic 3k² - √6 k -1 ≤ 0 holds when k is between the roots:-0.299 ≤ k ≤ 1.115But remember that in case 2, |k| &gt; √(1/3) ≈ 0.577. So the intersection of these two conditions is:√(1/3) &lt; k ≤ 1.115 and -0.299 ≤ k &lt; -√(1/3)But wait, in case 2, A &lt; 0 when |k| &gt; √(1/3). So k &gt; √(1/3) or k &lt; -√(1/3). But the quadratic inequality gives us k between approximately -0.299 and 1.115. Therefore, combining these:For k &gt; √(1/3) ≈ 0.577, the valid k is 0.577 &lt; k ≤ 1.115.For k &lt; -√(1/3) ≈ -0.577, the quadratic inequality requires k ≥ -0.299, but -0.299 is greater than -√(1/3) ≈ -0.577. Therefore, there is no overlap in the negative side. Therefore, only the positive interval 0.577 &lt; k ≤ 1.115 is valid.But let me check the exact values. The roots of 3k² - √6 k -1 = 0 are [√6 ± √(6 + 12)]/6 = [√6 ± √18]/6 = [√6 ± 3√2]/6.So exact roots:k1 = (√6 + 3√2)/6k2 = (√6 - 3√2)/6Compute k1:√6 ≈ 2.449, 3√2 ≈ 4.242So k1 ≈ (2.449 + 4.242)/6 ≈ 6.691/6 ≈ 1.115k2 ≈ (2.449 - 4.242)/6 ≈ (-1.793)/6 ≈ -0.299So indeed, as before. So the inequality 3k² - √6 k -1 ≤ 0 holds for k2 ≤ k ≤ k1. But in case 2, |k| &gt; √(1/3) ≈ 0.577. So for positive k: √(1/3) &lt; k ≤ k1 ≈1.115. For negative k: k2 ≈-0.299 ≤k &lt; -√(1/3) ≈-0.577. But wait, k2 is approximately -0.299, which is greater than -0.577, so the interval k2 ≤k &lt; -√(1/3) is empty because -0.299 is not less than -0.577. Therefore, only the positive interval is valid: √(1/3) &lt;k ≤k1.Therefore, combining all conditions:From discriminant, earlier we had k² ≤1 → |k| ≤1. But wait, part (2) requires the line to intersect the left branch. Wait, we found that the discriminant D = 36(1 -k²) ≥0 → |k| ≤1. But in case 2, |k| &gt;√(1/3) ≈0.577. Therefore, the valid k&#39;s must satisfy both |k| ≤1 and |k| &gt;√(1/3), and in addition, from the axis of symmetry condition, k must be between (√6 -3√2)/6 and (√6 +3√2)/6. Wait, but we just saw that this gives k in [≈-0.299, ≈1.115]. But since |k| ≤1, the upper bound is 1.115, but we need k ≤1. So the upper bound becomes min(1.115, 1) =1. Similarly, lower bound is -0.299, but since |k| ≤1, but in case 2, |k| &gt;√(1/3) ≈0.577, so negative side gives no solution. So the final range is √(1/3) &lt;k ≤1.Wait, but wait. The quadratic inequality gave us k ≤ (√6 +3√2)/6 ≈1.115, but since the discriminant requires |k| ≤1, so actually the upper bound is 1. Therefore, the intersection is √(1/3) &lt;k ≤1.Wait, but let&#39;s check with exact values. The upper root is (√6 +3√2)/6. Let me compute (√6 +3√2)/6:√6 = √(6), 3√2 = 3√2.Let me rationalize:(√6 +3√2)/6 ≈ (2.449 +4.242)/6 ≈6.691/6≈1.115, which is more than 1. But since the discriminant requires |k| ≤1, then the upper limit is actually 1. So even though the quadratic inequality allows up to ~1.115, the discriminant condition restricts k to |k| ≤1. Therefore, the upper bound is 1. Therefore, combining all conditions:From the discriminant D ≥0: |k| ≤1.From case 2 (A &lt;0): |k| &gt;√(1/3).From the axis of symmetry condition: √(1/3) &lt;k ≤ (√6 +3√2)/6 ≈1.115. But since |k| ≤1, this becomes √(1/3) &lt;k ≤1.Similarly, for negative k, the axis of symmetry condition gives k ≥ (√6 -3√2)/6≈-0.299, but combined with |k| &gt;√(1/3)≈0.577, which is not possible because -0.299 is greater than -0.577, but negative k with |k| &gt;0.577 would require k &lt; -0.577, but the axis of symmetry condition says k ≥-0.299, which is conflicting. So no solutions on the negative side.Therefore, the range of k is √(1/3) &lt;k ≤1.But let&#39;s verify this with exact values. Let me check if k=1 satisfies the axis of symmetry condition.At k=1, the axis of symmetry is x = (3*1*√2)/(1 -3*(1)^2) = (3√2)/(1 -3) = (3√2)/(-2) = - (3√2)/2 ≈ -2.121. The left branch is x ≤ -√3 ≈-1.732. So the axis of symmetry at x≈-2.121 is indeed ≤ -√3. Therefore, the roots would be around this axis of symmetry, so they should be less than or equal to -√3. Wait, but the quadratic in x has axis of symmetry at x ≈-2.121, which is less than -√3≈-1.732. Wait, actually, -2.121 is more to the left (smaller) than -√3. So if the axis of symmetry is at x ≈-2.121, then the parabola opens downward (A &lt;0), so the arms go to negative infinity. So the two roots would be on either side of the axis of symmetry. Wait, no. Wait, the quadratic in x is (1 -3k²)x² -6k√2 x -9 =0. Since A =1 -3k² &lt;0 (because k &gt;√(1/3)), the parabola opens downward. Therefore, the parabola has a maximum at x ≈-2.121. Therefore, the two roots are on either side of this vertex. But since the parabola opens downward, the arms go down on both sides. Therefore, the two intersection points would be one to the left of x=-2.121 and one to the right. Wait, but we need both points A and B to be on the left branch of the hyperbola, which is x ≤-√3 ≈-1.732. But if the axis of symmetry is at x ≈-2.121, then one root is left of -2.121 and the other is right of -2.121. But since the hyperbola&#39;s left branch is x ≤-√3≈-1.732, the root that is right of -2.121 (i.e., closer to zero) might actually be greater than -√3. Wait, but -2.121 is less than -1.732, so the roots would be at x ≈-2.121 ± something. Wait, no. If the axis of symmetry is at x = -2.121, and the parabola opens downward, then the two roots are symmetric around x = -2.121. So if one root is at x1 = -2.121 + d, the other is x2 = -2.121 - d. So one root is more to the left (x2) and the other is less to the left (x1). But the hyperbola&#39;s left branch is x ≤ -√3 ≈-1.732. So x1 = -2.121 + d must still be ≤ -1.732. So let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s take k=1. Then we can solve the quadratic equation:A =1 -3(1)^2 = -2B = -6*1*√2 = -6√2C = -9So equation: -2x² -6√2 x -9 =0 → 2x² +6√2 x +9 =0Discriminant D= (6√2)^2 -4*2*9=72 -72=0. So repeated root.Root at x= (-6√2)/(2*2)= (-6√2)/4= (-3√2)/2≈-2.121, which is equal to the axis of symmetry. So in this case, the line is tangent to the hyperbola at x≈-2.121, which is on the left branch (since -2.121 &lt; -√3≈-1.732). So at k=1, the line is tangent to the left branch. But the problem states that the line intersects the left branch at two points A and B, so tangency would be a single point. Therefore, k=1 is not allowed. Hmm, so perhaps my previous conclusion was wrong.Wait, when k=1, discriminant D=0, so the line is tangent to the hyperbola. Therefore, to have two distinct intersection points, we need D&gt;0, so k² &lt;1. But earlier we had D=36(1 -k²). So D&gt;0 implies k² &lt;1. So combining with the other conditions.Wait, let me re-express:The problem states that the line intersects the left branch at two points A and B. Therefore, we need two distinct real intersections, both on the left branch. Therefore, discriminant D must be positive (so k² &lt;1), and both roots x1, x2 ≤ -√3.So combining:1. D &gt;0 → k² &lt;1.2. Both roots ≤ -√3.Previously, when considering case 2 (A &lt;0, |k| &gt;√(1/3)), we found that in addition, the axis of symmetry must be ≤ -√3, which led to the inequality resulting in √(1/3) &lt;k ≤1. But when k=1, discriminant D=0, so it&#39;s a tangent, not two points. Therefore, k=1 is excluded. So the upper limit should be k &lt;1.But let me check again with the axis of symmetry condition. If the quadratic in x has axis of symmetry at x = (3k√2)/(1 -3k²). Since in case 2, 1 -3k² &lt;0, so denominator is negative. So x = (3k√2)/negative. If k is positive, then x is negative. If k is negative, x is positive. But since we are dealing with the left branch, we need x ≤ -√3. But if k is negative, the axis of symmetry is positive, which is not relevant for the left branch. Therefore, only positive k values would result in the axis of symmetry being negative, which is necessary for the roots to be on the left branch. Therefore, focusing on positive k:For k &gt;√(1/3), the axis of symmetry is x = (3k√2)/(1 -3k²). Since 1 -3k² is negative, x is negative. To have both roots ≤ -√3, we need:1. The axis of symmetry ≤ -√3.2. f(-√3) ≤0 (since A &lt;0).But we already considered these conditions. However, when k approaches 1, the discriminant approaches zero, leading to a tangent point. So actually, the valid range is √(1/3) &lt;k &lt;1.But let&#39;s re-examine the axis of symmetry condition. We had the inequality:3k² - √6 k -1 ≤0Which had roots at k=(√6 ±3√2)/6. For the positive root, which is (√6 +3√2)/6 ≈1.115, but we must have k &lt;1. Therefore, in reality, the upper bound is k &lt;1, but this quadratic inequality allows k up to ≈1.115. However, since the discriminant D=36(1 -k²) must be positive, we have k &lt;1. Therefore, the quadratic inequality 3k² - √6 k -1 ≤0 must be considered in the context of k &lt;1. Let&#39;s check at k=1:3(1)^2 - √6*1 -1 =3 -√6 -1=2 -√6≈2 -2.449≈-0.449&lt;0. So at k=1, the quadratic expression is negative. Therefore, the inequality 3k² - √6 k -1 ≤0 is true for k ≤ (√6 +3√2)/6≈1.115. But since k must also be &lt;1, the upper limit is k &lt;1. Therefore, the axis of symmetry condition is satisfied for all k in [ (√6 -3√2)/6≈-0.299, (√6 +3√2)/6≈1.115 ], but combined with case 2 (k &gt;√(1/3)≈0.577) and discriminant condition (k &lt;1), the valid k is 0.577 &lt;k &lt;1.Therefore, the range of k is √(1/3) &lt;k &lt;1.But let me verify with a test value between √(1/3)≈0.577 and 1. Let&#39;s choose k=0.8.Check if the line y=0.8x +√2 intersects the left branch at two points.First, substitute into the hyperbola equation:x²/3 - (0.8x +√2)^2 =1Compute:x²/3 - (0.64x² +1.6√2 x +2) =1Multiply through by 3:x² -3*(0.64x² +1.6√2 x +2)=3x² -1.92x² -4.8√2 x -6=3(1 -1.92)x² -4.8√2 x -9=0(-0.92)x² -4.8√2 x -9=0Multiply by -1:0.92x² +4.8√2 x +9=0Compute discriminant D:(4.8√2)^2 -4*0.92*94.8^2*2 - 4*0.92*923.04*2 - 33.1246.08 -33.12=12.96&gt;0So two real roots. Now check if both roots are ≤ -√3≈-1.732.Compute the roots:x = [-4.8√2 ±√12.96]/(2*0.92)√12.96=3.6So x = [ -4.8√2 ±3.6 ]/(1.84)Compute approximate values:4.8√2≈4.8*1.414≈6.787So x1 = [ -6.787 +3.6 ] /1.84≈(-3.187)/1.84≈-1.731x2 = [ -6.787 -3.6 ]/1.84≈(-10.387)/1.84≈-5.643So x1≈-1.731, which is just slightly above -√3≈-1.732, but actually, due to approximation errors, maybe exactly -√3?Wait, let&#39;s compute more accurately.Wait, √3≈1.73205.Compute x1:Numerator: -4.8√2 +3.6≈-4.8*1.41421356 +3.6≈-6.788222 +3.6≈-3.188222Divide by 1.84: -3.188222 /1.84≈-1.732So x1≈-1.732, which is exactly -√3. But since the line intersects at x≈-1.732 (which is the vertex of the hyperbola&#39;s left branch?), but actually, the hyperbola&#39;s left branch starts at x=-√3≈-1.732. So if the line intersects at x=-√3, is that a tangent? Wait, but we had two roots: x1≈-√3 and x2≈-5.643. Wait, x2≈-5.643 is definitely ≤-√3. But x1≈-√3 is exactly at the vertex. So depending on the exact calculation, maybe x1 is slightly less than -√3, but in reality, when k=0.8, does the line intersect the hyperbola at x=-√3 and another point?Wait, perhaps my approximations are causing confusion. Let&#39;s do exact calculation. Let me take k=√(2)/3≈0.471, which is less than √(1/3)≈0.577, so not in our desired range. Wait, perhaps better to take k=0.7, which is within √(1/3)≈0.577 and 1.k=0.7.Compute the quadratic equation:A=1 -3*(0.7)^2=1 -3*0.49=1 -1.47= -0.47B= -6*0.7*√2≈-4.2*1.414≈-5.9388C= -9Equation: -0.47x² -5.9388x -9 =0Multiply by -1: 0.47x² +5.9388x +9=0Discriminant D= (5.9388)^2 -4*0.47*9≈35.27 -16.92≈18.35&gt;0.Roots:x=[ -5.9388 ±√18.35 ]/(2*0.47)≈[ -5.9388 ±4.284 ]/0.94First root: [ -5.9388 +4.284 ]/0.94≈[ -1.6548 ]/0.94≈-1.76Second root: [ -5.9388 -4.284 ]/0.94≈[ -10.2228 ]/0.94≈-10.87Both roots are ≈-1.76 and ≈-10.87, which are both ≤ -√3≈-1.732. So even the first root is≈-1.76 &lt; -1.732. So in this case, both roots are on the left branch. Therefore, k=0.7 is valid.Wait, but earlier with k=0.8, one root was≈-1.732 (exactly -√3) and the other≈-5.643. But at k=0.8, the upper root is exactly at -√3. So perhaps for k in (√(1/3),1), the two intersection points are both on the left branch, but as k approaches 1, one of the points approaches the vertex at x=-√3, becoming tangent there. Therefore, the range is √(1/3) &lt;k &lt;1.But wait, when I took k=0.8, one root was≈-1.732 (exactly -√3) and the other≈-5.643. But the hyperbola&#39;s left branch includes x=-√3, so if the line intersects at x=-√3, that&#39;s a valid point, but since we need two distinct points, the case when one root is at x=-√3 would require the other root also to be on the left branch. Wait, but in reality, when k approaches 1, the two roots merge at x≈-2.121 (for k=1), but when k is slightly less than 1, one root is near -2.121, and the other approaches -√3. Wait, no. Wait, when k=1, it&#39;s tangent at x≈-2.121. So as k decreases from 1 to √(1/3), the two roots move apart? Wait, I need to think.Alternatively, maybe I should check the exact condition when one of the roots is exactly -√3. Let&#39;s set x=-√3 in the quadratic equation:(1 -3k²)x² -6k√2 x -9 =0Plug x=-√3:(1 -3k²)*(3) -6k√2*(-√3) -9=0Compute:3 -9k² +6k√6 -9=0Simplify:-6 -9k² +6k√6=0 → -9k² +6k√6 -6=0 → Multiply by -1:9k² -6k√6 +6=0Which is the same equation as before. This quadratic in k has roots at k=(√6 ±√( (6√6)^2 -4*9*6 ))/(2*9)... Wait, but we already saw that this quadratic has a discriminant of zero. Wait, no, wait:Wait, 9k² -6k√6 +6=0Discriminant D= ( -6√6 )² -4*9*6= 216 -216=0. So this quadratic has a repeated root at k= (6√6)/(2*9)= (6√6)/18=√6/3≈0.816.Therefore, when k=√6/3≈0.816, the line intersects the hyperbola at x=-√3 and another point. But since the discriminant is zero for this quadratic, but when we substituted x=-√3, we found that k=√6/3 is the only solution. Therefore, at k=√6/3≈0.816, the line is tangent to the hyperbola at x=-√3. Wait, but x=-√3 is the vertex of the hyperbola. Therefore, at k=√6/3, the line is tangent to the vertex, hence intersecting at only one point on the left branch. But the problem requires two points of intersection. Therefore, k=√6/3 is excluded. Hence, the valid range is k &gt;√(1/3) but k ≠√6/3. Wait, but when I tested k=0.7, which is less than √6/3≈0.816, the line still intersects two points. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, no. Wait, the equation 9k² -6k√6 +6=0 has a repeated root at k=√6/3. So substituting x=-√3 into the quadratic equation gives k=√6/3 as the only solution. Therefore, when k=√6/3, x=-√3 is a root. But since the quadratic equation for x is of degree 2, there is another root. Let&#39;s compute it.At k=√6/3≈0.816, the quadratic equation becomes:(1 -3*( (√6)/3 )² )x² -6*(√6/3)*√2 x -9 =0Compute:1 -3*(6/9)=1 -3*(2/3)=1 -2= -1Therefore, A=-1.B= -6*(√6/3)*√2= -6*(√12)/3= -6*(2√3)/3= -4√3C= -9So equation: -x² -4√3 x -9 =0 → x² +4√3 x +9=0Discriminant D=(4√3)^2 -4*1*9=48 -36=12&gt;0Roots: x=(-4√3 ±√12)/2=(-4√3 ±2√3)/2=(-4√3 +2√3)/2=(-2√3)/2=-√3 and (-4√3 -2√3)/2=(-6√3)/2=-3√3.Therefore, when k=√6/3≈0.816, the line intersects the hyperbola at x=-√3 and x=-3√3. Both are on the left branch. So even though k=√6/3 is where the quadratic equation for k when x=-√3 has a repeated root, in reality, when substituting into the x quadratic, we still get two distinct roots, both on the left branch. Therefore, k=√6/3 is allowed. However, when k=1, the line is tangent at x=-3√2/2≈-2.121, which is on the left branch. Therefore, at k=1, the line is tangent to the left branch. Thus, the range should be √(1/3) &lt;k &lt;1, including k=√6/3≈0.816. The case when k=1 is excluded because it&#39;s tangent. Hence, the range is ( √(1/3), 1 ).Therefore, converting √(1/3) to √3/3, the range is (√3/3, 1).But let&#39;s check once more with k=√6/3≈0.816. At this k, the line intersects the hyperbola at x=-√3 and x=-3√3. Both are on the left branch, so this is valid. Therefore, k=√6/3 is valid. So why did we get the quadratic inequality allowing up to k=1.115? Because when we set the axis of symmetry ≤ -√3, it&#39;s a condition that&#39;s necessary but in combination with the discriminant. But since the discriminant requires k &lt;1, the upper limit is 1, not 1.115. Therefore, the range is √3/3 &lt;k &lt;1.But wait, the problem says &quot;intersects the left branch at points A and B&quot;. If at k=1, the line is tangent to the left branch, which is a single point, so k=1 is excluded. For k between √3/3 and1, excluding 1, the line cuts the left branch at two distinct points. Therefore, the range is √3/3 &lt;k &lt;1.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is the range of k is (√3/3, 1).But let me confirm once more.Given that when k approaches 1 from below, one of the intersection points approaches the tangent point at x=-3√2/2≈-2.121, but since x=-3√2/2≈-2.121 &lt; -√3≈-1.732, this is still on the left branch. Wait, but when k=1, the line is tangent at x≈-2.121, which is on the left branch. So at k=1, it&#39;s a single intersection point on the left branch, so excluded. For k just less than 1, the line intersects the left branch at two points: one near x≈-2.121 and another further left. Wait, no. Wait, when k=1, discriminant is zero, so only one intersection point. For k &lt;1, discriminant is positive, two distinct points. However, depending on k, these two points can be on the left and right branches. But we need both points on the left branch.Wait, the hyperbola has two branches. The line could intersect both branches if it&#39;s not constrained. But in our case, because the line has a positive slope (k&gt;0), and y-intercept √2&gt;0, it&#39;s possible that for some k, it intersects the right branch, but since we are only considering intersections with the left branch, we have to ensure both solutions x are ≤-√3.Wait, now I&#39;m confused. Let me consider k=0.5, which is less than √(1/3)≈0.577. If I plug k=0.5 into the equation:x²/3 - (0.5x +√2)^2=1Expand:x²/3 -0.25x² -√2 x -2=1Multiply by 3:x² -0.75x² -3√2 x -6=30.25x² -3√2 x -9=0Discriminant D=( -3√2 )² -4*0.25*(-9)=18 +9=27&gt;0.Roots:x=(3√2 ±√27)/(2*0.25)=(3√2 ±3√3)/0.5=6√2 ±6√3.Thus, x1=6√2 +6√3≈6*(1.414 +1.732)=6*3.146≈18.876 (positive, right branch)x2=6√2 -6√3≈6*(1.414 -1.732)=6*(-0.318)≈-1.908So x2≈-1.908 &lt; -√3≈-1.732, so it&#39;s on the left branch. So for k=0.5, the line intersects the right branch at x≈18.876 and the left branch at x≈-1.908. But the problem states that the line intersects the left branch at points A and B. So in this case, only one intersection on the left branch. Therefore, k=0.5 is invalid.But according to our earlier analysis, for k &gt;√(1/3)≈0.577, both intersections are on the left branch. Let me check with k=0.7 again:The roots were≈-1.76 and≈-10.87, both ≤-√3≈-1.732. So yes, two points on the left branch. For k=√6/3≈0.816, the roots are x=-√3 and x=-3√3, both on the left branch. For k approaching 1, say k=0.9:A=1 -3*(0.9)^2=1 -3*0.81=1 -2.43=-1.43B= -6*0.9*√2≈-5.4*1.414≈-7.636C= -9Equation: -1.43x² -7.636x -9=0 → multiply by -1:1.43x² +7.636x +9=0Discriminant D=7.636² -4*1.43*9≈58.29 -51.48≈6.81&gt;0Roots: x=(-7.636 ±√6.81)/(2*1.43)≈(-7.636 ±2.61)/2.86x1≈(-7.636 +2.61)/2.86≈(-5.026)/2.86≈-1.757x2≈(-7.636 -2.61)/2.86≈(-10.246)/2.86≈-3.582Both ≈-1.757 and≈-3.582, which are ≤-√3≈-1.732. Therefore, both on the left branch.At k=1, discriminant D=0, so x=(-3√2)/2≈-2.121, which is a single point on the left branch.Therefore, the valid range is √(1/3) &lt;k &lt;1.

It&#39;s about geometric sequences, which I remember have a common ratio between consecutive terms. The problem has two parts: first, finding the general term of the sequence {a_n}, and second, finding the sum T_{2n} of another sequence {b_n} which is defined in terms of {a_n}. Let&#39;s start with part (1).The problem states that {a_n} is a geometric sequence, so I know that each term is the previous term multiplied by a constant ratio, let&#39;s call it r. So, the general term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by S_n = a_1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), right? Unless r = 1, in which case it&#39;s just n*a_1. But since the problem mentions it&#39;s a geometric sequence and gives another condition, I assume r ≠ 1.The key condition given is that a_{n+1} = S_n + 1 for all natural numbers n. Wait, that seems a bit tricky. So, for any n, the (n+1)th term of the sequence is equal to the sum of the first n terms plus 1. Let me write that down:For any n ∈ ℕ*, a_{n+1} = S_n + 1.But since {a_n} is a geometric sequence, a_{n+1} is also equal to a_1 * r^n. So, putting these together:a_1 * r^n = S_n + 1.But S_n is the sum of the first n terms, which is a_1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r). Therefore:a_1 * r^n = [a_1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r)] + 1.Hmm, this equation needs to hold for all n ∈ ℕ*. That seems like a strong condition. If it&#39;s true for all n, then maybe we can set up equations for different n and solve for a_1 and r. Let&#39;s try plugging in n = 1 first.When n = 1:Left-hand side (LHS): a_1 * r^1 = a_1 r.Right-hand side (RHS): S_1 + 1 = a_1 + 1.So, equation becomes:a_1 r = a_1 + 1.  --- (1)Similarly, for n = 2:LHS: a_1 * r^2.RHS: S_2 + 1 = (a_1 + a_1 r) + 1 = a_1(1 + r) + 1.Equation:a_1 r^2 = a_1(1 + r) + 1.  --- (2)So, we have two equations here. Let&#39;s try to solve for a_1 and r.From equation (1):a_1 r = a_1 + 1 ⇒ a_1(r - 1) = 1 ⇒ a_1 = 1/(r - 1).  --- (1a)Now substitute this into equation (2):a_1 r^2 = a_1(1 + r) + 1.Substitute a_1 = 1/(r - 1):[1/(r - 1)] * r^2 = [1/(r - 1)]*(1 + r) + 1.Multiply both sides by (r - 1) to eliminate denominators:r^2 = (1 + r) + (r - 1).Simplify RHS:1 + r + r - 1 = 2r.So, equation becomes:r^2 = 2r ⇒ r^2 - 2r = 0 ⇒ r(r - 2) = 0.Thus, r = 0 or r = 2.But in a geometric sequence, if r = 0, then all terms after the first would be zero. Let&#39;s check if that works with the original condition.If r = 0, then a_1 = 1/(0 - 1) = -1.Then, the sequence would be -1, 0, 0, 0, ...Sum of first n terms: S_n = -1 + 0 + ... + 0 = -1 for n ≥ 1.Then, a_{n+1} = S_n + 1 ⇒ a_{n+1} = -1 + 1 = 0.Which matches, since for n ≥ 1, a_{n+1} is 0. But wait, for n = 1, a_2 = S_1 + 1 = (-1) + 1 = 0, which is correct. For n = 2, a_3 = S_2 + 1 = (-1 + 0) + 1 = 0, which also holds. So, technically, r = 0 is a solution? But is this a valid geometric sequence? Usually, geometric sequences allow r = 0, but maybe in some contexts they require r ≠ 0. However, the problem didn&#39;t specify any restrictions on r, so perhaps both solutions are possible.Wait, but when r = 0, the sum S_n is always -1 for n ≥ 1, and the terms beyond the first are zero. But let&#39;s check for n = 3:a_4 = S_3 + 1 = (-1 + 0 + 0) + 1 = 0, which matches. So r = 0 seems to work.But let&#39;s also check r = 2. If r = 2, then from (1a), a_1 = 1/(2 - 1) = 1.So, the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Let&#39;s check the condition.For n = 1: a_2 = S_1 + 1 ⇒ 2 = 1 + 1 ⇒ 2 = 2, which holds.For n = 2: a_3 = S_2 + 1 ⇒ 4 = (1 + 2) + 1 ⇒ 4 = 4, which holds.For n = 3: a_4 = S_3 + 1 ⇒ 8 = (1 + 2 + 4) + 1 ⇒ 8 = 7 + 1 ⇒ 8 = 8, which holds.So, r = 2 also works. Therefore, we have two possible solutions? But the problem says &quot;the general term formula&quot;, implying a unique solution. Hmm.Wait, maybe r = 0 isn&#39;t acceptable here because if we look at the original condition a_{n+1} = S_n + 1, for n ∈ ℕ*. If r = 0, then a_{n+1} = 0 for n ≥ 1. But S_n = -1 for all n ≥ 1, so S_n + 1 = 0, which gives a_{n+1} = 0. So that works. However, the problem might be expecting a non-trivial geometric sequence where the ratio isn&#39;t zero. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify, both r = 0 and r = 2 are possible. Wait, but let&#39;s check for n = 1 in the r = 0 case: a_1 = -1, a_2 = 0, but according to the formula a_{n} = a_1 * r^{n-1}, so a_2 = -1 * 0^{1} = 0, which matches. So, technically, both are valid.But let&#39;s check if the problem mentions any other constraints. It just says &quot;geometric sequence&quot; and &quot;n ∈ ℕ*&quot;, which is positive integers. So, both are possible. But in the problem statement part (1), &quot;Find the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}&quot;. If there are two possibilities, we need to find both. But maybe the r = 0 case is trivial and the problem expects the r = 2 case. Let me think again.Wait, for the r = 0 case, the sequence is -1, 0, 0, 0, ... So the sum S_n is -1 for all n ≥ 1, and a_{n+1} is 0 for all n ≥ 1, which is equal to S_n + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0. So it works. But maybe the problem is expecting a non-degenerate geometric sequence? Not sure. Let me check for n = 1 in both cases.In the r = 0 case:a_1 = -1, a_2 = 0, a_3 = 0, etc.In the r = 2 case:a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4, etc.But the problem might have multiple solutions. Wait, but let&#39;s see if r = 0 works for all n.Suppose n = 3:a_4 = S_3 + 1. For r = 0, S_3 = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1. Then a_4 = -1 + 1 = 0, which is correct. Similarly, n = 4: a_5 = S_4 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0, which is a_5 = 0. So yes, works.But in the problem, when they say &quot;the general term formula&quot;, maybe we need to consider both. However, the problem is in Chinese, and the translation might imply that there&#39;s a unique solution. Let me check the original problem again.Wait, the problem says &quot;the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n. It is known that a_{n+1} = S_n + 1, where n ∈ ℕ*.&quot; Then part (1) is to find the general term formula. If we have two possibilities, then the answer would have two cases. But maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Let&#39;s check if r = 0 is actually a solution for all n.Suppose r = 0. Then S_n = a_1 + a_1 r + a_1 r^2 + ... + a_1 r^{n-1} = a_1 (1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0) = a_1. But in our case, a_1 = -1/(1 - 0) ??? Wait, no, earlier calculation for a_1 when r = 0 was a_1 = 1/(r - 1) = 1/(0 - 1) = -1.Therefore, S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n)/(1 - r) = -1 * (1 - 0^n)/(1 - 0) = -1 * (1 - 0)/1 = -1 * 1 = -1. So S_n = -1 for all n. Then a_{n+1} = S_n + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0, which is equal to a_{n+1} = a_1 * r^n = -1 * 0^n = 0 for n ≥ 1. Therefore, yes, this works for all n. So technically, there are two solutions: one with r = 0 and a_1 = -1, and another with r = 2 and a_1 = 1.But the problem asks to &quot;find the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}&quot;. If there are two possible sequences, we should present both. However, maybe in the problem&#39;s context, considering geometric sequences with r ≠ 0, they expect the non-trivial solution. Let me check.Alternatively, perhaps the condition must hold for all n ∈ ℕ*, which includes n = 1, 2, 3, etc., but when we set up the equations, we only used n = 1 and n = 2 and found that both r = 0 and r = 2 satisfy them. However, does r = 0 satisfy for all n?Let me test with r = 0 and n = 3:a_4 = S_3 + 1.a_4 = 0 (since it&#39;s the fourth term, a_4 = a_1 * r^3 = -1 * 0 = 0).S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1.So, S_3 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 = a_4. Correct.Similarly, for n = 4:a_5 = S_4 + 1 = (-1 + 0 + 0 + 0) + 1 = 0. Which matches a_5 = 0.So indeed, r = 0 works for all n. Therefore, there are two solutions. However, the problem might be expecting the non-trivial one. Wait, but why would they not specify? Maybe the problem is designed such that only r = 2 works. Wait, let&#39;s check with n = 1 in the case of r = 0: a_{n+1} = S_n + 1. For n = 1, a_2 = S_1 + 1. S_1 = a_1 = -1, so a_2 = -1 + 1 = 0, which is correct. So both sequences satisfy the condition.But maybe the problem assumes that the geometric sequence is non-trivial (i.e., r ≠ 0). But since the problem statement didn&#39;t specify, maybe we need to present both solutions. However, in most problems like this, unless specified, they usually expect the non-zero ratio. Let me check by substituting n = 3 in the r = 0 case:Wait, if n = 3, then a_4 = 0, which is S_3 + 1. But S_3 is sum of first 3 terms: a1 + a2 + a3 = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1. So S3 +1 = 0, which equals a4. Similarly for any n. So yes, works.But then, in that case, the general term formula is either a_n = -1 * 0^{n-1} = 0 for n ≥ 2, and a1 = -1. But that&#39;s a bit awkward. Alternatively, since 0^{n-1} is 0 for n ≥ 2, so a_n = -1 if n =1, 0 otherwise. But that&#39;s a valid geometric sequence with ratio 0.Alternatively, if the problem requires the sequence to have all terms non-zero, then r = 0 is invalid. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify, both solutions are acceptable.But let&#39;s see what happens in part (2). If there are two possibilities for {a_n}, then {b_n} would have two different forms, and the sum T_{2n} would also differ. But since the problem doesn&#39;t mention different cases, maybe we are supposed to find the solution where {a_n} is non-trivial, i.e., with r = 2. Let&#39;s check.If we take r = 2 and a1 = 1, then {a_n} is 1, 2, 4, 8, ... which is a standard geometric sequence. Then {b_n} = (-1)^n (a_n + n). Let&#39;s see for the first few terms:b1 = (-1)^1 (1 + 1) = -2b2 = (-1)^2 (2 + 2) = 4b3 = (-1)^3 (4 + 3) = -7b4 = (-1)^4 (8 + 4) = 12Sum T_{2n} would be the sum of these terms up to 2n. For example, T_2 = -2 + 4 = 2; T_4 = -2 + 4 -7 +12 = 7, etc.But if we take the r = 0 case, {a_n} is -1, 0, 0, 0, ..., so {b_n} = (-1)^n (a_n + n) = (-1)^n (-1 + n) when n =1: (-1)^1 (-1 +1) = 0; n=2: (-1)^2 (0 +2)=2; n=3: (-1)^3 (0 +3)= -3; n=4: (-1)^4 (0 +4)=4; etc. Then the sum T_{2n} would be 0 + 2 -3 +4 -5 +6... up to 2n terms. Which is a different sum. However, the problem says &quot;find the sum&quot;, implying a unique answer. Therefore, maybe the r=0 case is not intended here, and the problem expects us to take r=2. Perhaps even though the r=0 case technically works, the problem assumes a standard geometric progression where the ratio is not zero.Therefore, maybe we should proceed with r=2 and a1=1. Let&#39;s confirm this with another check. Suppose we take r=2 and a1=1, then for any n, a_{n+1}=2^n. The sum S_n =1*(2^n -1)/(2 -1)=2^n -1. Then a_{n+1}=2^n, which is equal to S_n +1=2^n -1 +1=2^n. Yes, that works. Perfect. Therefore, the correct ratio is r=2 and a1=1. The other case with r=0 gives a_{n+1}=0=S_n +1, which also holds because S_n =-1 for all n, so S_n +1=0. However, since part (2) refers to {b_n}=(-1)^n (a_n +n), if {a_n} is the zero sequence (except first term), then {b_n} becomes (-1)^n (-1 +n) when n=1, and (-1)^n (0 +n) for n≥2. However, the problem might have intended the non-trivial solution. Given that part (2) asks for a sum that likely has a closed-form expression, which would be more complex if {a_n} had mostly zeros. Therefore, the intended solution is probably r=2 and a1=1.Therefore, for part (1), the general term is a_n =1*2^{n-1}=2^{n-1}.Now, moving to part (2): Let {b_n}={(-1)^n}(a_n +n). We need to find the sum of the first 2n terms, T_{2n}.First, let&#39;s express b_n explicitly. Since a_n =2^{n-1}, then:b_n = (-1)^n (2^{n-1} +n)So, T_{2n} = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k (2^{k-1} +k)We can split this sum into two separate sums:T_{2n} = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1} + sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k kLet&#39;s compute each sum separately.First sum: S1 = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1}Second sum: S2 = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k kCompute S1 first.S1 = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1} = (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^kBecause 2^{k-1} = (2^k)/2, so:sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1} = (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^kThis is a geometric series with first term a = (-2)^1 = -2, ratio r = -2, and number of terms 2n.The sum of a geometric series is a*(1 - r^{m})/(1 - r), where m is the number of terms.So, sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^k = (-2)*(1 - (-2)^{2n})/(1 - (-2)) = (-2)*(1 - 4^n)/(1 + 2) = (-2)*(1 -4^n)/3 = ( -2 + 2*4^n ) / 3 = (2*4^n - 2)/3Therefore, S1 = (1/2)*(2*4^n -2)/3 = (4^n -1)/3Now, compute S2 = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k kThis is the alternating sum of the first 2n natural numbers. Let&#39;s write out the terms:For k from 1 to 2n:When k is odd: (-1)^k k = -kWhen k is even: (-1)^k k = +kSo, S2 = (-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + (-5 + 6) + ... + [-(2n-1) + 2n]Each pair (-(2m-1) + 2m) = 1 for m from 1 to n. There are n such pairs.Therefore, S2 = n*1 = nWait, that&#39;s a neat result. Let&#39;s verify with small n:For n=1: 2n=2 terms: -1 +2 =1, which equals n=1.For n=2: 2n=4 terms: -1 +2 -3 +4 = (-1+2) + (-3+4) =1+1=2, which equals n=2.Yes, so indeed S2 = n.Therefore, T_{2n} = S1 + S2 = (4^n -1)/3 + n = (4^n -1)/3 + nWe can write this as T_{2n} = n + (4^n -1)/3Alternatively, combining terms over a common denominator:= (3n +4^n -1)/3But the problem says to &quot;find the sum of the first 2n terms... denoted as T_{2n}.&quot; So either form is acceptable. However, we can check if this simplifies further.Alternatively, note that 4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}, but that might not help here.So, the answer is T_{2n} = n + (4^n -1)/3, which can also be written as (4^n + 3n -1)/3.Therefore, the boxed answers would be:(1) The general term formula for {a_n} is boxed{2^{n-1}}.(2) The sum T_{2n} is boxed{dfrac{4^n + 3n - 1}{3}}.But let me confirm once again with an example.For part (1), if a_n =2^{n-1}, then let&#39;s check the condition a_{n+1} = S_n +1.For n=1: a_2 =2^1=2. S_1 =2^{0}=1. So S1 +1=1+1=2=a2. Correct.For n=2: a3=4. S2=1+2=3. S2+1=4=a3. Correct.For n=3: a4=8. S3=1+2+4=7. 7+1=8. Correct. So part (1) is confirmed.For part (2), take n=1: T2 = sum of first 2 terms of {b_n}.Given a1=1, a2=2.b1 = (-1)^1(1 +1) = -2b2 = (-1)^2(2 +2)=4Sum T2= -2 +4=2.Using the formula: (4^1 +3*1 -1)/3=(4 +3 -1)/3=6/3=2. Correct.Another example, n=2: T4= sum of first 4 terms.b1=-2, b2=4, b3=(-1)^3(4 +3)= -7, b4=(-1)^4(8 +4)=12.Sum T4= -2 +4 -7 +12=7.Formula: (4^2 +3*2 -1)/3=(16 +6 -1)/3=21/3=7. Correct.Another check: n=3. T6= sum of first 6 terms.Compute terms:b1= -2, b2=4, b3= -7, b4=12, b5=(-1)^5(16 +5)= -21, b6=(-1)^6(32 +6)=38.Sum: -2 +4=2; 2 -7= -5; -5 +12=7; 7 -21= -14; -14 +38=24.Formula: (4^3 +3*3 -1)/3=(64 +9 -1)/3=72/3=24. Correct.Therefore, the answers are confirmed.Final Answer(1) boxed{2^{n-1}}  (2) boxed{dfrac{4^n + 3n - 1}{3}}&lt;/think&gt;Given a geometric sequence ({a_n}) with the sum of its first (n) terms denoted as (S_n), and the condition (a_{n+1} = S_n + 1) for all (n in mathbb{N}^*):1.

The general term is (a_n = a_1 cdot r^{n-1}).   - The sum of the first (n) terms is (S_n = a_1 frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}) for (r neq 1).   - Using the given condition (a_{n+1} = S_n + 1), we substitute (a_{n+1} = a_1 cdot r^n) and (S_n) into the equation:     [     a_1 cdot r^n = a_1 frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} + 1     ]   - Solving for (a_1) and (r) by substituting (n = 1) and (n = 2), we find:     - For (n = 1): (a_1 r = a_1 + 1)     - For (n = 2): (a_1 r^2 = a_1 (1 + r) + 1)   - Solving these equations, we find (a_1 = 1) and (r = 2).

The general term formula for the sequence ({a_n}) is (boxed{2^{n-1}}).2. The sum of the first (2n) terms of the sequence ({b_n}) is (boxed{dfrac{4^n + 3n - 1}{3}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to solve this problem about a geometric sequence. The problem has two parts. First, I need to find the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}, given that a_{n+1} = S_n + 1, where S_n is the sum of the first n terms. Then, the second part is about another sequence {b_n} defined as (-1)^n (a_n + n), and I have to find the sum of the first 2n terms, T_{2n}. Let&#39;s start with part (1).First, recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. So, if the first term is a_1 and the common ratio is r, then a_n = a_1 * r^{n-1}. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S_n = a_1(1 - r^n)/(1 - r) if r ≠ 1. Given that a_{n+1} = S_n + 1. Let&#39;s try to write this equation using the formulas for geometric sequences.Since {a_n} is a geometric sequence, a_{n+1} = a_1 * r^n. Also, S_n = a_1(1 - r^n)/(1 - r). Therefore, substituting into the given equation:a_1 * r^n = (a_1(1 - r^n)/(1 - r)) + 1.Hmm, so this equation relates a_1 and r. Maybe we can find a relationship between them. Let&#39;s write this equation for different values of n and see if we can find a pattern or solve for a_1 and r.Wait, but the equation must hold for all n in N*, right? Because the problem states that a_{n+1} = S_n + 1 for all n in N*. So, the equation a_1 * r^n = (a_1(1 - r^n)/(1 - r)) + 1 should hold for all n ≥ 1. That seems restrictive. Maybe we can plug in n = 1 and n = 2 to get two equations and solve for a_1 and r.Let&#39;s try that.For n = 1:Left-hand side (LHS): a_{2} = a_1 * r.Right-hand side (RHS): S_1 + 1 = a_1 + 1.So, equation 1: a_1 * r = a_1 + 1.Similarly, for n = 2:LHS: a_{3} = a_1 * r^2.RHS: S_2 + 1 = (a_1 + a_1 r) + 1 = a_1(1 + r) + 1.So, equation 2: a_1 r^2 = a_1(1 + r) + 1.Now we have two equations:1. a_1 r = a_1 + 1.2. a_1 r^2 = a_1(1 + r) + 1.Let me try to solve these equations. Let&#39;s start with equation 1.From equation 1: a_1 r - a_1 = 1 =&gt; a_1 (r - 1) = 1 =&gt; a_1 = 1/(r - 1). Assuming r ≠ 1, which is okay because if r = 1, the geometric sequence would have all terms equal, but then S_n = a_1 n, and the given condition a_{n+1} = S_n + 1 would imply a_1 = a_1 n + 1 for all n, which is impossible unless a_1 = 0, but then 0 = 0 +1, which is 0 = 1, impossible. So r ≠ 1 is valid.Now, substitute a_1 = 1/(r - 1) into equation 2:Left-hand side (LHS): a_1 r^2 = (1/(r - 1)) * r^2.Right-hand side (RHS): a_1(1 + r) + 1 = (1/(r - 1))(1 + r) + 1.So, set LHS = RHS:( r^2 / (r - 1) ) = ( (1 + r)/(r - 1) ) + 1.Multiply both sides by (r - 1) to eliminate the denominators:r^2 = (1 + r) + (r - 1).Simplify the right-hand side:(1 + r) + (r - 1) = 1 + r + r - 1 = 2r.So equation becomes:r^2 = 2r.Assuming r ≠ 0 (since it&#39;s a geometric sequence, if r = 0, all terms after the first would be zero, but then a_{n+1} = S_n + 1 would require that 0 = S_n +1, which would imply S_n = -1, but S_n for a geometric sequence starting with a1 and ratio 0 is a1 + 0 + 0 + ... = a1, so a1 = -1. Then, S_n = -1 for all n, but a_{n+1} = 0, so 0 = -1 +1 = 0, which might work. Wait, but let&#39;s check if r=0 is a possible solution.Wait, if r=0, then the sequence is a1, 0, 0, 0, ... So S_n = a1 for all n. Then, according to the given condition, a_{n+1} = S_n +1. For n=1, a_2 = S_1 +1 = a1 +1. But a_2 =0, so 0 = a1 +1 =&gt; a1 = -1. Then, for n=2, a3 = S_2 +1 = a1 + a2 +1 = -1 + 0 +1 = 0, which matches a3=0. Similarly, for any n ≥1, a_{n+1} = S_n +1 = -1 +1 =0, which is consistent with the sequence terms being -1,0,0,0,... So, r=0 and a1=-1 is a solution. But in this case, the general term is a1 = -1, a2=0, a3=0,..., so the general term formula would be a1 = -1, a_n=0 for n ≥2. But in this case, the problem says &quot;geometric sequence&quot;. If the ratio is zero, then after the first term, all terms are zero, which is a valid geometric sequence. So, this seems like a possible solution. However, when we solved equation 1 and 2, we assumed r ≠1 and derived a1=1/(r -1). But in that case, if r=0, then a1=1/(0 -1)= -1, which matches the a1=-1 we found. So, actually, r=0 is allowed here. So, equation 2 gives us r^2=2r, leading to r=0 or r=2. So, two possible solutions.Wait, so when we solved equation 2, we got r^2=2r =&gt; r(r -2)=0, so r=0 or r=2. So, possible r=0 or r=2.So, then we have two cases:Case 1: r=0.Then, a1 =1/(0 -1) = -1. So, the sequence is -1, 0, 0, 0, ..., which we checked works. For example, a_{n+1}=0, S_n = -1 +0 +0 +...= -1, so S_n +1= -1 +1=0, which matches a_{n+1}=0. So, this works.Case 2: r=2.Then, a1=1/(2 -1)=1. So, the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., a geometric sequence with ratio 2. Let&#39;s check if this satisfies the condition a_{n+1}=S_n +1.For example, take n=1: a2=2. S1=1. So S1 +1=2, which matches a2=2.For n=2: a3=4. S2=1 +2=3. S2 +1=4, which matches a3=4.For n=3: a4=8. S3=1 +2 +4=7. S3 +1=8, which matches a4=8. So, yes, this works. So, both r=0 and r=2 are possible.But wait, the problem says &quot;the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}&quot;. So, there might be two solutions? But maybe we need to check if both are valid. Wait, let&#39;s see. The problem states &quot;Let {a_n} be a geometric sequence... It is known that a_{n+1}=S_n +1 where n∈N*.&quot; So, both sequences satisfy this condition.Wait, but let&#39;s check for n=3 in the r=0 case. The sequence is -1, 0, 0, 0, ... So, a_{4}=0. S3= -1 +0 +0= -1. S3 +1=0, which matches a4=0. So, yes, it works for all n. Similarly, for r=2, it works for all n as we saw.But the problem asks to &quot;find the general term formula&quot;. So, there might be two possible solutions? But in the problem statement, perhaps they expect a unique solution. Maybe there&#39;s an error in our reasoning.Wait, but let&#39;s check again. When r=0, the general term is a1=-1, a2=0, a3=0, etc. So, a_n = -1 if n=1, 0 if n≥2. But in a geometric sequence, a_n = a1 * r^{n-1}. So, for r=0, a1=-1, so a_n = -1 * 0^{n-1}. Which is -1 * 0^{0} = -1 when n=1, and -1 * 0^{n-1} = 0 when n≥2. So that works. So, that&#39;s a valid general term.Similarly, for r=2, a_n =1*2^{n-1}=2^{n-1}, which is 1,2,4,8,...But the problem is part (2) mentions b_n = (-1)^n (a_n +n). If there are two possible sequences, then part (2) would have two answers. But maybe the problem expects us to find both solutions? However, in the problem statement, part (1) is to find the general term formula. It might be that both solutions are acceptable, but perhaps we need to check if both are correct.Wait, but let&#39;s see the problem statement again. It says &quot;the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}&quot;. Since both r=0 and r=2 satisfy the given condition, perhaps both are valid. However, let&#39;s verify for r=0 case with higher n.Take n=4: a5=0. S4= -1 +0 +0 +0= -1. S4 +1=0, which matches a5=0. Similarly, for n=5, a6=0, S5= -1, S5 +1=0. So, this works indefinitely.But in the r=2 case, the terms grow exponentially, and S_n =1*(2^n -1)/(2 -1)=2^n -1. Then, a_{n+1}=2^n. And S_n +1=2^n -1 +1=2^n. So, that&#39;s consistent. So, yes, both sequences satisfy the condition. So, perhaps the answer has two possible general term formulas.But maybe the problem assumes that the sequence is non-trivial? Because in the case of r=0, after the first term, all terms are zero, which might be considered a trivial solution, whereas the r=2 case is a more standard geometric sequence. But the problem didn&#39;t specify any restrictions. Hmm. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation here.Wait, let&#39;s check the equations again.We had for equation 1: a1 =1/(r -1). Then, for equation 2, after substituting, we ended up with r^2=2r, leading to r=0 or r=2. Then, for r=0, a1=1/(0 -1)= -1. For r=2, a1=1/(2 -1)=1. Both are valid.But let&#39;s think again. If r=0, then S_n =a1 +a1*r +a1*r^2 +...+a1*r^{n-1}=a1*(1 -0)/(1 -0)=a1. But since r=0, all terms after the first are zero. So S_n =a1 for all n. Then, given a_{n+1}= S_n +1. For any n≥1, a_{n+1}=a1 +1. But since the sequence is a geometric sequence with ratio 0, a_{n+1}=0 for n≥1. Therefore, a1 +1=0 =&gt; a1= -1. So, S_n = -1 for all n. Then, a_{n+1}= -1 +1=0, which is consistent. So, this works.But if we consider the problem statement, which mentions the sum of the first n terms, S_n. If S_n is -1 for all n, then the sum isn&#39;t changing as n increases, which is only possible if all terms after the first are zero. So, yes, that&#39;s a valid case.Therefore, the problem might have two solutions. However, in the problem statement, it&#39;s stated as &quot;the general term formula&quot;, implying perhaps a unique solution. Maybe in the problem&#39;s context, they expect the non-trivial solution with r=2. Alternatively, maybe both are acceptable.Wait, but let&#39;s check with n=1. For r=0, the first term is a1=-1. Then, a2=S1 +1= (-1) +1=0, which matches. For the other solution, a1=1, a2=S1 +1=1 +1=2, which is correct. So both are valid. Therefore, the problem might have two possible solutions.But the problem is part (2) asks to find T_{2n} for b_n=(-1)^n (a_n +n). If there are two possible {a_n}, then T_{2n} would be different for each. However, maybe both solutions lead to the same T_{2n}, but I doubt it. Let&#39;s check.Suppose we take r=0. Then, {a_n} is -1,0,0,0,... So, a_n +n is -1 +1=0 when n=1, 0 +2=2 when n=2, 0 +3=3 when n=3, 0 +4=4 when n=4, etc. Then, b_n = (-1)^n*(a_n +n). So, for n=1: (-1)^1*(0)=0; n=2: (-1)^2*(2)=2; n=3: (-1)^3*(3)= -3; n=4: (-1)^4*(4)=4; etc. Then, the sum of the first 2n terms T_{2n} would be 0 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6 -... up to 2n terms. Wait, but in this case, starting from n=1: term1=0, term2=2, term3=-3, term4=4, term5=-5, term6=6,... So, the sum would be (0 +2) + (-3 +4) + (-5 +6) + ... for n pairs. But if we have 2n terms, then the sum would be 2 +1 +1 +... How many times? Let&#39;s see. For n=1 (2 terms): 0 +2=2. For n=2 (4 terms):0 +2 -3 +4= (0 +2) + (-3 +4)= 2 +1=3. For n=3 (6 terms):0 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6= (0 +2) + (-3 +4) + (-5 +6)=2 +1 +1=4. So, seems like T_{2n}=n +1. Wait, but let&#39;s check. For n=1, T_2=2=1 +1=2. For n=2, T_4=3=2 +1=3. For n=3, T_6=4=3 +1=4. So, T_{2n}=n +1. Hmm, interesting.Alternatively, if r=2, then {a_n}=1,2,4,8,16,... So, a_n=2^{n-1}. Then, a_n +n=2^{n-1} +n. Therefore, b_n=(-1)^n*(2^{n-1} +n). So, the terms are:n=1: (-1)^1*(1 +1)= -2n=2: (-1)^2*(2 +2)=4n=3: (-1)^3*(4 +3)= -7n=4: (-1)^4*(8 +4)=12n=5: (-1)^5*(16 +5)= -21n=6: (-1)^6*(32 +6)=38So, the sum T_{2n} would be the sum of these terms up to the 2n-th term. For example, T_2= -2 +4=2; T_4= -2 +4 -7 +12=7; T_6= -2 +4 -7 +12 -21 +38=24. So, this seems more complicated, and likely different from the r=0 case. Therefore, the answer for part (2) depends on which sequence {a_n} is considered. Therefore, since part (1) may have two solutions, part (2) would have two corresponding answers. But the problem didn&#39;t specify to find all possible solutions. So, perhaps the problem expects both possibilities for part (1) and then corresponding part (2) answers? But that seems complicated.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in assuming that r=0 is a valid solution. Let me check again.In the case of r=0, the general term is a_n= -1 if n=1, 0 if n≥2. Then, the sum S_n= -1 for all n. Then, a_{n+1}=S_n +1= -1 +1=0, which holds for all n≥1. But in the definition of a geometric sequence, ratio r=0 is allowed. So, it&#39;s a valid geometric sequence. So, perhaps the problem allows both solutions.But the problem asks to &quot;find the general term formula&quot;. Maybe both are acceptable, but in the original problem&#39;s context, maybe only the r=2 solution is intended. Let&#39;s check the problem again. It says &quot;the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n. It is known that a_{n+1}=S_n +1&quot;. If we take the r=0 case, then S_n is always -1, and a_{n+1}=0. So, this works. But maybe the problem is from a source where the ratio is non-zero, but unless specified, both are valid.But since the problem is likely expecting one answer, maybe there&#39;s an error in my earlier reasoning. Wait, when I solved the equations for a1 and r, I considered n=1 and n=2. But the equation must hold for all n. Let me check for n=3 in the r=0 case.For r=0, a1=-1. Then, a_{4}=0. S_3= -1 +0 +0= -1. Then, S_3 +1=0, which matches a4=0. Similarly, for n=4, a5=0, S_4= -1, so S_4 +1=0. So, it works for all n. Therefore, this is a valid solution.Similarly, for r=2, as checked earlier, it works for all n.Therefore, there are two geometric sequences that satisfy the given condition. Hence, part (1) has two possible general term formulas. Then, for part (2), depending on which {a_n} is chosen, we have different results. However, since the problem says &quot;Let {a_n} be a geometric sequence...&quot;, and &quot;find the general term formula&quot;, perhaps both solutions are acceptable. But maybe the problem expects us to consider both. However, in most problems like this, unless stated otherwise, the non-trivial solution is expected. But let&#39;s check.Wait, if r=0, then the sum T_{2n} for {b_n} is n +1, as we saw. If r=2, then T_{2n} is more complicated. But since part (2) is probably expecting a closed-form expression, maybe the r=0 case is easier, but the problem might be designed for r=2. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the assumption.Wait, let&#39;s think again. When we set up the equation for a geometric sequence, we used the formula S_n = a1(1 - r^n)/(1 - r). But in the case r=0, this formula still holds because S_n = a1(1 -0^n)/(1 -0)=a1*1/1=a1. Which is indeed correct since all terms after the first are zero.Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the sequence is non-degenerate, i.e., r ≠0. But unless specified, we can&#39;t assume that. Therefore, perhaps both solutions are acceptable. However, in the problem&#39;s context, maybe there&#39;s a unique solution. Let me check again.Suppose r=0: Then, {a_n} is -1,0,0,0,... So, when you plug into the original condition, a_{n+1}=S_n +1, it works. So, this is a valid solution. However, maybe the problem expects a non-zero common ratio. If the problem is from an exam, perhaps they expect r=2.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s an error in the problem&#39;s translation. The original problem says &quot;the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n&quot;. The notation is standard. The problem states &quot;a_{n+1}=S_n +1&quot;. So, given that, the two solutions are possible. However, maybe the problem assumes that the sequence is non-constant after the first term. But unless specified, both are valid.Given that, maybe the answer for part (1) is a_n=2^{n-1}, and for part (2) based on that. But the user hasn&#39;t provided options, so we need to check.Alternatively, let&#39;s proceed with both possibilities.For part (1), the general term is either:Case 1: a_n = -1 if n=1, and 0 if n ≥2.Case 2: a_n =2^{n-1}.But in the problem statement, part (1) says &quot;Find the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}&quot;. For Case 1, it&#39;s a piecewise function. However, in terms of a geometric sequence formula, since a_n =a1 * r^{n-1}, so for Case 1, a1=-1, r=0, so a_n=-1*0^{n-1}. Which is equivalent to -1 when n=1 and 0 otherwise. So, technically, the general term can be written as a_n = -0^{n-1}, but 0^{n-1} is 1 when n=1 and 0 otherwise. So, a_n = -0^{n-1}. Alternatively, since 0^{n-1} is 1 only when n=1, then a_n = -1 if n=1, 0 otherwise. But perhaps it&#39;s better to write it using the standard geometric sequence formula: a_n = a1 * r^{n-1} = -1 * 0^{n-1}.Similarly, for Case 2, a_n=2^{n-1}.Therefore, the answer for part (1) is either a_n=2^{n-1} or a_n=-0^{n-1}, depending on the ratio. But perhaps the problem expects the non-trivial solution. Given that, maybe the intended answer is a_n=2^{n-1}.But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a way to confirm. If we consider that when r=2, the terms are increasing, so S_n=2^n -1, as we saw. Then, a_{n+1}=2^n, which is indeed equal to S_n +1=(2^n -1)+1=2^n. So, yes, that works. And for the other case, r=0, we have a_{n+1}=0=S_n +1=(-1)+1=0, which also works.Since both solutions are mathematically valid, the problem might have two answers. But since the problem is in Chinese (given the original Chinese prompt), and the user translated it, maybe in the original problem there were more constraints. However, as presented, both solutions are possible.But let&#39;s think again. If we consider the problem as stated: Let {a_n} be a geometric sequence with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n. It is known that a_{n+1}=S_n +1 for all n in N*. Find the general term formula.Given that for r=2, the sequence is 1,2,4,8,... and for r=0, it&#39;s -1,0,0,0,... Both satisfy the given condition. Therefore, unless additional constraints are given, both are correct. However, in problems like this, sometimes only the non-trivial solution is intended. So, perhaps the answer is a_n=2^{n-1}. Let&#39;s check the problem again.If we suppose that the problem is designed to have a unique solution, then maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation. Let&#39;s check the equations again. When we solved for r, we obtained two solutions: r=0 and r=2. Let me check the case when r=0.If r=0, then the sequence is -1,0,0,0,... So, S_n = -1 for all n. Then, a_{n+1}=0, which equals S_n +1=-1 +1=0, which is correct. So, this is valid.Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the geometric sequence is non-trivial, i.e., with a non-zero ratio. If so, then the answer is r=2. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify, we can&#39;t assume that.Given that, perhaps both solutions are acceptable. But since the problem asks for the general term formula, and in the case of r=0, the formula can be written as a_n = -1 if n=1, 0 otherwise. However, using the geometric sequence formula, it&#39;s a_n = -1 * 0^{n-1}. Which simplifies to a1=-1, and r=0. So, that&#39;s a valid general term.Alternatively, maybe the problem wants a single formula, like a_n=2^{n-1}, which is a standard geometric sequence. However, the other case is also a geometric sequence.Given that, perhaps the answer expects both solutions. But the problem says &quot;Find the general term formula&quot;, implying a unique answer. Therefore, perhaps there is an error in my previous steps.Wait, let&#39;s consider that when we set up the equation:a_{n+1}=S_n +1.But for a geometric sequence, a_{n+1}=a1*r^n.Also, S_n = a1*(1 -r^n)/(1 -r).Therefore, the equation is:a1*r^n = [a1*(1 -r^n)/(1 -r)] +1.But this must hold for all n in N*. Therefore, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of r^n must be equal on both sides. Let&#39;s rearrange the equation:a1*r^n - [a1*( -r^n)/(1 -r)] = [a1/(1 -r)] +1.Wait, maybe that&#39;s messy. Let&#39;s rewrite the equation:a1*r^n = (a1/(1 -r))*(1 - r^n) +1.Then, bring all terms to one side:a1*r^n - (a1/(1 -r))*(1 - r^n) -1 =0.Factor terms with a1:a1[ r^n - (1 - r^n)/(1 -r) ] -1 =0.Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:r^n - (1 -r^n)/(1 -r) = [ r^n*(1 -r) - (1 -r^n) ] / (1 -r).Compute numerator:r^n*(1 -r) -1 + r^n = r^n - r^{n+1} -1 + r^n = 2r^n - r^{n+1} -1.So, expression becomes:[2r^n - r^{n+1} -1]/(1 -r).Therefore, the equation becomes:a1*[2r^n - r^{n+1} -1]/(1 -r) -1 =0.But this must hold for all n≥1. Therefore, the coefficient of r^n and the constant term must be zero.Let&#39;s write this equation as:a1/(1 -r)*(2r^n -r^{n+1} -1) -1 =0.For this equation to hold for all n≥1, the coefficients of the powers of r must be zero, and the constants must also cancel out.Let&#39;s write the equation as:a1/(1 -r)*( -r^{n+1} +2r^n -1 ) -1 =0.Let me factor out terms:For the terms involving r^{n+1} and r^n:a1/(1 -r)*( -r^{n+1} +2r^n ) + a1/(1 -r)*(-1) -1=0.Let me write this as:a1/(1 -r)*[ -r^{n+1} +2r^n ] + [ -a1/(1 -r) -1 ]=0.Now, the first part involves r^{n}, the second part is a constant.For the entire expression to be zero for all n≥1, both the coefficients of r^{n} and the constant term must be zero.First, consider the coefficient of r^{n}:a1/(1 -r)*(-r +2 ) * r^{n-1} must be zero for all n≥1. Therefore, the coefficient (-r +2 ) must be zero. Therefore:-r +2=0 =&gt; r=2.Alternatively, this approach might be flawed. Let me think.Wait, another approach: For the equation a1*r^n = (a1/(1 -r))(1 - r^n) +1 to hold for all n≥1, the left-hand side and the right-hand side must be equal as functions of n. Since this is a functional equation in n, the only way this can hold for all n is if the coefficients of corresponding exponential terms (r^n) are equal, and the constants are equal.Let me rewrite the equation:a1*r^n = (a1/(1 -r)) - (a1/(1 -r))r^n +1.Rearrange terms:a1*r^n + (a1/(1 -r))r^n = (a1/(1 -r)) +1.Factor out r^n on the left:a1*r^n [1 + 1/(1 -r)] = (a1/(1 -r)) +1.Simplify the left-hand side:a1*r^n [ (1 -r +1)/(1 -r) ) ] = a1*r^n [ (2 -r)/(1 -r) ) ].Therefore:a1*r^n*(2 -r)/(1 -r) = (a1/(1 -r)) +1.Now, for this equation to hold for all n≥1, the coefficient of r^n must be zero (since the right-hand side is a constant), and the remaining constant term must equal the right-hand side.Therefore, first, set the coefficient of r^n to zero:a1*(2 -r)/(1 -r) =0.Since this must hold for all n≥1, and r≠1 (from earlier), so denominator is not zero. Therefore, a1*(2 -r)=0.So, either a1=0 or r=2.If a1=0, then the entire sequence is zero, which would imply S_n=0, and then a_{n+1}=0=0 +1=1, which is impossible. Therefore, a1≠0, so we must have r=2.Then, substituting r=2 into the equation:The remaining constant term must equal the right-hand side. Let&#39;s substitute r=2 into the equation:Left-hand side after factoring: a1*r^n*(2 -r)/(1 -r) + ... Wait, but when we set the coefficient of r^n to zero, that part is zero, so we have:0 = (a1/(1 -r)) +1.Substituting r=2:0 = (a1/(1 -2)) +1 =&gt; 0 = (-a1) +1 =&gt; a1=1.So, thus, the only solution is r=2 and a1=1. Therefore, this gives the unique solution a_n=2^{n-1}.Therefore, the earlier consideration of r=0 was incorrect because when we considered r=0, we might have overlooked the fact that the functional equation must hold for all n, which led to a unique solution.Wait, but according to this approach, only r=2 satisfies the equation for all n, and r=0 does not. Wait, but we saw that with r=0, the equation holds for all n. So, there is a contradiction here.Wait, let&#39;s analyze this carefully. If we set the coefficient of r^n to zero, leading to r=2, then the remaining equation gives a1=1. This gives the solution a_n=2^{n-1}.But in the case of r=0, the coefficient approach would not hold, because in that case, r=0, so r^n=0 for n≥1. Therefore, the original equation becomes:Left-hand side: a1*0=0.Right-hand side: [a1/(1 -0)]*(1 -0^n) +1= a1*(1 -0) +1= a1 +1.Therefore, 0 =a1 +1 =&gt; a1=-1. Which is the solution we found earlier.But in the previous approach where we set coefficients for general r≠0,2, we derived that r must be 2, but when r=0, this approach doesn&#39;t apply because the terms involving r^n become zero, which is a different case.Therefore, the problem actually has two solutions: one with r=2 and a1=1, and another with r=0 and a1=-1. Hence, both are valid. However, when we treated the general case with r≠0,2, we derived r=2 as the only solution, but when r=0, we have another solution. Therefore, the problem has two solutions.However, in the functional equation approach, when r≠0,2, the coefficient of r^n must be zero, leading to r=2, but when r=0, the term r^n is zero, so the equation reduces to 0 =a1 +1, which gives another solution.Therefore, the conclusion is that there are two geometric sequences satisfying the given condition: one with a1=1, r=2, and another with a1=-1, r=0.Hence, part (1) has two possible answers:1. a_n = 2^{n-1}2. a_n = -1 if n=1, 0 if n≥2.But the problem says &quot;find the general term formula&quot;. For the second case, it&#39;s a piecewise function, but expressed as a geometric sequence, it&#39;s a_n = -1 * 0^{n-1}, since 0^{n-1}=1 when n=1, and 0 otherwise. So, a_n = -0^{n-1}. Alternatively, using the geometric sequence formula, since a1=-1 and r=0, then a_n = a1*r^{n-1}= -1*0^{n-1}= -0^{n-1}.But 0^{n-1} is 1 when n=1 and 0 otherwise. Therefore, writing it as a_n = -0^{n-1} is equivalent to the piecewise function. However, this notation might not be standard, but mathematically it&#39;s correct.Therefore, the general term formulas are either a_n=2^{n-1} or a_n=-0^{n-1}. Both are correct.But since the problem is likely expecting the non-trivial solution where the sequence is not eventually zero, the answer is a_n=2^{n-1}. However, since the problem didn&#39;t specify, we must present both solutions.But given that the problem has part (2) which involves summing terms of {b_n}=(-1)^n(a_n +n), it&#39;s possible that only the non-trivial solution (r=2) leads to a meaningful sum, while the trivial solution (r=0) might lead to a simpler sum. However, both are valid.Given that, perhaps I need to proceed with both solutions for part (1) and corresponding part (2) answers. But since the problem is structured as two separate parts, maybe the problem expects the non-trivial solution, so proceeding with that.Therefore, proceeding under the assumption that the intended answer is a_n=2^{n-1} for part (1), and then moving to part (2) with that.So, part (1) answer: a_n=2^{n-1}Part (2): {b_n}={(-1)^n(a_n +n)}= (-1)^n(2^{n-1} +n). Find T_{2n}=sum_{k=1}^{2n} b_k.Let&#39;s compute T_{2n}=sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k (2^{k-1} +k).We can split this into two sums:T_{2n}=sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1} + sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k k.Let&#39;s compute each sum separately.First sum: S1 = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1}Second sum: S2 = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k k.Compute S1:S1 = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1} = (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^k.Because 2^{k-1}= (1/2)2^k, so (-1)^k 2^{k-1}= (1/2)(-2)^k.Therefore, S1= (1/2) [ sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^k ].The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=1}^{m} ar^{k-1}= a(1 -r^m)/(1 -r). But here, the sum is sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^k. Let&#39;s write it as sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^k = (-2) + (-2)^2 + (-2)^3 + ... + (-2)^{2n}.This is a geometric series with first term a=-2, ratio r=-2, number of terms 2n.Sum formula: a(1 -r^m)/(1 -r). Here, a=-2, r=-2, m=2n.Sum = (-2)[1 - (-2)^{2n}]/[1 - (-2)] = (-2)[1 - (4^n)]/(1 +2) = (-2)(1 -4^n)/3 = [ -2 + 2*4^n ] /3 = [2*4^n -2]/3 = 2(4^n -1)/3.Therefore, S1= (1/2) * [2(4^n -1)/3] = (4^n -1)/3.Now, compute S2= sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k k.This is the sum of alternating signs: -1 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6 -... +(-1)^{2n}(2n).Since 2n is even, the last term is +2n.We can pair the terms:(-1 +2) + (-3 +4) + ... + [-(2n-1) +2n].There are n pairs. Each pair is (-(2k-1) +2k)=1 for k=1 to n.Therefore, S2= n*1= n.Alternatively, let&#39;s verify with small n:For n=1: S2= -1 +2=1=1. Correct.For n=2: S2= -1 +2 -3 +4=2=2. Correct.For n=3: -1 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6=3. Correct. So, indeed, S2=n.Therefore, T_{2n}= S1 + S2= (4^n -1)/3 +n= (4^n -1)/3 +n.Simplify this expression:Combine terms over a common denominator:= (4^n -1 +3n)/3.Therefore, T_{2n}= (4^n +3n -1)/3.Hence, the answer is T_{2n}= (4^n +3n -1)/3.Alternatively, if we considered the r=0 case:For part (1), a_n=-1,0,0,... so a_n +n= -1 +1=0 when n=1, 0 +2=2 when n=2, 0 +3=3 when n=3, etc. Therefore, b_n=(-1)^n*(a_n +n):n=1: (-1)^1*(0)=0n=2: (-1)^2*(2)=2n=3: (-1)^3*(3)=-3n=4: (-1)^4*(4)=4...Then, T_{2n}= sum_{k=1}^{2n} b_k= sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k*(a_k +k).Given a1=-1, a2=0, a3=0,..., so:b1=0b2=2b3=-3b4=4b5=-5b6=6...Therefore, T_{2n}=0 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6 -...+(-1)^{2n}(a_{2n} +2n).But since a_{2n}=0 (for n≥1), then b_{2n}=(-1)^{2n}(0 +2n)=2n.So, sum T_{2n}=0 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6 -...- (2n-1) +2n.Group terms as pairs:(0 +2) + (-3 +4) + (-5 +6) + ... + [-(2n-1) +2n]Note that the first term is 0 +2=2, then each subsequent pair is (-(2k-1) +2k)=1 for k=2 to n. There are (n-1) such pairs. Wait, let&#39;s check:For example, if n=1: 2n=2. T_2=0 +2=2.If n=2: T_4=0 +2 -3 +4= (0+2) + (-3+4)=2 +1=3.If n=3: T_6=0 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6=2 +1 +1=4.So, in general, T_{2n}=2 + (n-1)*1= n+1.Wait, for n=1: T_2=2=1+1=2.For n=2: T_4=3=2+1=3.For n=3: T_6=4=3+1=4.So, T_{2n}=n+1.But this contradicts the previous calculation where T_{2n}= (4^n +3n -1)/3. So, depending on the solution for part (1), part (2) has different answers. Hence, the problem might have two possible solutions depending on the sequence {a_n}.But since the problem didn&#39;t specify which sequence to use, but in most problems like this, the non-trivial solution is expected. However, given that the problem didn&#39;t specify, it&#39;s ambiguous.Given that, maybe the problem assumes the non-trivial solution with r=2. Therefore, the answer for part (1) is a_n=2^{n-1}, and for part (2), T_{2n}=(4^n +3n -1)/3.But let&#39;s check with the initial terms for the non-trivial solution.For example, when n=1, T_2= sum of first 2 terms:b1= (-1)^1*(1 +1)= -2b2= (-1)^2*(2 +2)=4So, T_2= -2 +4=2. Which matches (4^1 +3*1 -1)/3=(4 +3 -1)/3=6/3=2.For n=2, T_4= sum of first 4 terms:b1=-2, b2=4, b3=(-1)^3*(4 +3)= -7, b4=(-1)^4*(8 +4)=12Sum: -2 +4 -7 +12=7. Which matches (4^2 +3*2 -1)/3=(16 +6 -1)/3=21/3=7.For n=3, T_6= sum of first 6 terms:b1=-2, b2=4, b3=-7, b4=12, b5=(-1)^5*(16 +5)= -21, b6=(-1)^6*(32 +6)=38Sum: -2 +4 -7 +12 -21 +38= (-2+4)=2; (2 -7)= -5; (-5 +12)=7; (7 -21)= -14; (-14 +38)=24. Which matches (4^3 +3*3 -1)/3=(64 +9 -1)/3=72/3=24.So, this formula works. Therefore, if part (1) is a_n=2^{n-1}, then part (2) is T_{2n}=(4^n +3n -1)/3.Alternatively, if part (1) is a_n=-0^{n-1}, then part (2) is T_{2n}=n+1. But this depends on the sequence. Since the problem didn&#39;t specify, but the non-trivial solution is more interesting, likely expects the first answer.Therefore, the answers are:(1) a_n=2^{n-1}(2) T_{2n}=(4^n +3n -1)/3.Final Answer(1) The general term formula is boxed{a_n = 2^{n-1}}.(2) The sum of the first (2n) terms (T_{2n}) is boxed{dfrac{4^n + 3n - 1}{3}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a geometric sequence ({a_n}) with the sum of its first (n) terms denoted as (S_n), and the condition (a_{n+1} = S_n + 1) for (n in mathbb{N}^*):1. Finding the general term formula for the sequence ({a_n}):   - We start by noting that a geometric sequence has the form (a_n = a_1 cdot r^{n-1}) and the sum of the first (n) terms is (S_n = a_1 frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}) for (r neq 1).   - Using the given condition (a_{n+1} = S_n + 1), we substitute the geometric sequence formulas:     [     a_1 cdot r^n = frac{a_1 (1 - r^n)}{1 - r} + 1     ]   - Solving for (a_1) and (r) by considering specific values of (n), we find two possible solutions: (r = 2) with (a_1 = 1) and (r = 0) with (a_1 = -1). However, the non-trivial solution (r = 2) leads to a valid geometric sequence for all (n), while the trivial solution (r = 0) results in a sequence that becomes zero after the first term.   - The non-trivial solution gives the general term formula:     [     a_n = 2^{n-1}     ]2. Finding the sum of the first (2n) terms of the sequence ({b_n} = {(-1)^n (a_n + n)}):   - Given (b_n = (-1)^n (a_n + n)), we need to find (T_{2n}).   - Substituting (a_n = 2^{n-1}) into (b_n), we get:     [     b_n = (-1)^n (2^{n-1} + n)     ]   - We split the sum (T_{2n}) into two parts:     [     T_{2n} = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1} + sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k k     ]   - The first sum is a geometric series:     [     sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k 2^{k-1} = frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-2)^k = frac{1}{2} left( frac{-2 (1 - (-2)^{2n})}{1 + 2} right) = frac{4^n - 1}{3}     ]   - The second sum is an alternating series:     [     sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k k = n     ]   - Combining these results, we get:     [     T_{2n} = frac{4^n - 1}{3} + n = frac{4^n + 3n - 1}{3}     ] Final Answer(1) The general term formula is (boxed{a_n = 2^{n-1}}).(2) The sum of the first (2n) terms (T_{2n}) is (boxed{dfrac{4^n + 3n - 1}{3}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-f09ae572></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>🔑:</span> Solution:# Part (1): Finding the general term formula for the sequence {a_{n}}Given that a_{n+1}=S_{n}+1 and the sequence is geometric with common ratio q, we analyze the sequence as follows:- For n=1, we have:  [  a_{2}=S_{1}+1=a_{1}+1  ]  Since a_{2}=a_{1}q, it follows that a_{1}q=a_{1}+1.- For ngeqslant 2, we consider:  [  a_{n}=S_{n-1}+1  ]  Subtracting this from the given a_{n+1}=S_{n}+1, we find:  [  a_{n+1}-a_{n}=a_{n} implies frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}=2  ]  Therefore, the common ratio q=2.Given q=2, we can deduce that a_{1}=1, and thus the general term formula for the sequence is:[a_{n}=2^{n-1}]# Part (2): Finding the sum of the first 2n terms of the sequence {b_{n}}Given a_{n}=2^{n-1}, we can express {b_n} as:[b_{n}=(-1)^{n}(2^{n-1}+n)]For even and odd terms, we have:- b_{2n}=2^{2n-1}+2n- b_{2n-1}=-(2^{2n-2}+2n-1)Adding b_{2n} and b_{2n-1} gives:[b_{2n}+b_{2n-1}=4^{n-1}+1]The sum of the first 2n terms, T_{2n}, is then the sum of these pairs:[T_{2n}=(b_{1}+b_{2})+(b_{3}+b_{4})+cdots+(b_{2n-1}+b_{2n})=left(1+4+cdots+4^{n-1}right)+n]Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find:[T_{2n}=frac{4^n-1}{3}+n]Therefore, the sum of the first 2n terms of the sequence {b_{n}} is boxed{frac{4^n-1}{3}+n}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-3f6a97c4 data-v-f09ae572><div class="review" data-v-f09ae572><div class="review-title" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>❓:</span>[quad The Pigeonhole Principle (miscellaneous). quad] quad Complexity: 3  [Chessboards and chess pieces]What is the maximum number of kings that can be placed on a chessboard so that no two of them attack each other#</div><div class="divider" data-v-f09ae572></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is asking for the maximum number of kings that can be placed on a chessboard such that no two kings attack each other. Hmm, I remember that kings in chess can move one square in any direction, right? So if two kings are adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they can attack each other. Therefore, we need to place them in such a way that each king has at least one square buffer zone around them in all directions. First, let me visualize a chessboard. It&#39;s an 8x8 grid, so 64 squares in total. If we want to place kings without them attacking each other, each king needs their own &quot;territory&quot; where no other king is nearby. Since a king can attack in all eight surrounding squares, maybe the best way is to arrange them in a pattern where they are spaced out by at least one square in all directions.I wonder if there&#39;s a standard pattern for this. Maybe like a checkerboard pattern? But wait, a checkerboard alternates colors, but even if you place a king on every other square, they might still be diagonally adjacent. For example, if you place a king on a white square, the diagonally adjacent white squares are two squares away, but the black squares are adjacent. So if you place kings on all the white squares, then each white square is separated by one square, but the diagonals would still have kings next to each other. Wait, no, if you place a king on a white square, the next white square is two squares away, so diagonally there&#39;s a black square in between. Wait, actually, diagonally adjacent squares on a chessboard are different colors. So if you place kings on all squares of one color, say all white squares, then no two white squares are adjacent. Wait, but if you place a king on a white square, the squares adjacent to it (including diagonally) are all black. So if you only use one color, then no two kings would be adjacent. But wait, the problem is that a king on a white square can attack any adjacent square, which are all black. So if you have another king on a black square adjacent to it, they can attack each other. Therefore, placing kings on all white squares would result in each king attacking all adjacent black squares, but since there are no other kings on white squares, but if there are kings on black squares, then they would attack each other. So, to prevent any two kings from attacking each other, they must not be on adjacent squares of any color.Therefore, maybe the solution is similar to placing kings on squares of the same color, but with even more spacing. Wait, but the maximum number would require us to place as many kings as possible without them attacking. Maybe a checkerboard pattern with every other square, but not alternating. Let&#39;s think.Alternatively, maybe divide the chessboard into 2x2 blocks. In each 2x2 block, you can place one king. Since in a 2x2 area, placing a king in one square would attack the other three squares. So if you place one king per 2x2 block, then they won&#39;t attack each other. Since the chessboard is 8x8, dividing it into 2x2 blocks gives 16 blocks (since 8/2=4 in each dimension, 4x4=16). Therefore, 16 kings. But is this the maximum?Wait, but maybe you can do better. Because when you divide into 2x2 blocks, each block is isolated, but maybe there&#39;s a way to stagger them so that you can place more kings. For example, think of arranging kings in every other column but shifted in alternating rows. Let me try to imagine.If I place a king in the first row, first column, then skip a column, place another in the third column, etc. Then in the next row, shift by one column, so starting from the second column, then fourth, etc. This way, the kings are staggered diagonally, which might allow for more efficient packing. Let&#39;s see.So row 1: columns 1, 3, 5, 7 (4 kings)Row 2: columns 2, 4, 6, 8 (4 kings)Row 3: columns 1, 3, 5, 7Row 4: columns 2, 4, 6, 8And so on.But wait, in this arrangement, each king in row 1 is in columns 1,3,5,7. The king in row 1, column 1 is adjacent diagonally to row 2, column 2. But in this case, row 2 has a king in column 2. So that would mean those two kings are diagonally adjacent and can attack each other. Therefore, this arrangement doesn&#39;t work because the kings in adjacent rows are diagonally next to each other.Hmm, so that&#39;s a problem. So in order to prevent diagonal attacks, the kings in adjacent rows must not be in adjacent columns. So if in row 1, we have kings in columns 1,3,5,7, then in row 2, we can&#39;t have kings in columns 2,4,6,8 because they would be diagonally adjacent. So perhaps we need to alternate rows with kings and rows without kings. For example, place kings in row 1, skip row 2, place kings in row 3, etc. But that would only use 4 rows, resulting in 4 rows x 4 columns = 16 kings, same as the 2x2 block method. So maybe that&#39;s not better.Alternatively, maybe interleave the kings in a way that each king is surrounded by empty squares in all directions. For instance, in row 1, place a king in column 1, skip one, column 3, skip one, etc. Then in row 2, skip the first column, place a king in column 2, skip one, column 4, etc. Wait, but in that case, the kings in row 1 and row 2 would be adjacent vertically. For example, row 1, column 1 is adjacent to row 2, column 1. So if we skip row 2, then that&#39;s okay. Wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of a different approach.Another way to approach this is to model the chessboard as a graph where each square is a node, and edges connect squares that are adjacent (including diagonally). Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. An independent set is a set of vertices with no two adjacent. However, finding the maximum independent set is generally a hard problem, but for certain graphs, like bipartite graphs, there are known solutions. However, the chessboard adjacency graph is not bipartite because it contains triangles (for example, three mutually adjacent squares in a corner). Wait, no, in chessboard adjacency, each square is adjacent to up to eight others, but does it form triangles? Let&#39;s see. If square A is adjacent to square B and square C, and square B is adjacent to square C, then that forms a triangle. For example, the square at (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2) and (2,1), and (1,2) is adjacent to (2,1). So yes, there are triangles. Therefore, the graph is not bipartite, so König&#39;s theorem doesn&#39;t apply directly. So maybe this approach isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, perhaps use the concept of the Pigeonhole Principle. If we can divide the chessboard into regions such that each region can contain at most one king, then the maximum number of kings is at most the number of regions. To maximize the number of kings, we need to find the minimum number of such regions. But this is similar to graph coloring, where each region is a color, and adjacent regions have different colors. Wait, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, if each region is a set of squares where no two squares in the set are adjacent, then the maximum independent set would be the largest such set.But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to tile the chessboard in such a way that each tile can hold at most one king, and arrange the tiles to cover the entire board. For example, if we use 2x2 tiles as before, each tile can hold one king, leading to 16 kings. But maybe there&#39;s a more efficient tiling.Wait, perhaps 3x3 tiles? No, that would leave too much space. Let me think again. Maybe instead of 2x2 tiles, use a staggered pattern. For example, in each &quot;checkerboard&quot; color, but modified. Wait, if we color the chessboard in the usual alternating black and white squares, each color class has 32 squares. However, placing kings on all squares of one color would result in 32 kings, but as I thought before, they would be attacking each other diagonally. Wait, but actually, two kings on the same color are not adjacent. Wait, no. On a standard chessboard, two squares of the same color are not adjacent either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Wait, actually, diagonally adjacent squares are different colors. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.In a standard chessboard, each square is colored such that adjacent squares (even diagonally) have different colors. So, for example, the square (1,1) is black, (1,2) is white, (2,1) is white, and (2,2) is black. So diagonally adjacent squares, like (1,1) and (2,2), are both black. Wait, no, actually, (1,1) is black, (2,2) is black if the chessboard starts with black at (1,1). Wait, no. Wait, in a standard chessboard, (row, column) where row and column are numbered from 1 to 8. If (1,1) is black, then (1,2) is white, (2,1) is white, and (2,2) is black. So diagonally adjacent squares have the same color. For example, (1,1) and (2,2) are both black. Therefore, if you place kings on all black squares, then any two kings on diagonally adjacent black squares would be attacking each other. Because even though they are on the same color, they are diagonally adjacent. Therefore, placing kings on all squares of one color is not allowed because they would attack each other diagonally. Therefore, that approach doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the maximum independent set on a chessboard graph is not 32. So, what&#39;s the actual maximum? Going back to the 2x2 block idea. If we partition the chessboard into 2x2 blocks, each block can contain at most one king, since a king in one square of the block attacks all other squares in the block. Therefore, with 16 blocks, we can have 16 kings. Is this the maximum? Or can we do better?Wait, maybe if we shift the blocks. For example, instead of dividing the board into 2x2 blocks, maybe use a different tiling. Suppose we use a pattern where each king is placed with one square separating them horizontally and vertically, but staggered between rows. For example, in the first row, place kings on columns 1, 4, 7; second row, columns 2, 5, 8; third row, columns 3, 6; fourth row back to 1,4,7; etc. But this is just a guess; let me try to sketch it.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of a repeating pattern every three rows. Wait, this might complicate things. Alternatively, use a checkerboard pattern but with larger spacing. For instance, place a king on a square, leave two squares, place another king, etc. But I need to make sure that in all directions, there&#39;s at least one square between kings.Wait, perhaps the optimal arrangement is similar to a checkerboard but with a two-color scheme where each color is used in a way that no two squares of the same color are adjacent even diagonally. Wait, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, use four colors. For example, a four-coloring of the chessboard where each color class is an independent set. But if that&#39;s the case, then the maximum independent set would be at least 16 (since 64 squares divided by 4 colors). But perhaps in some colorings, the independent sets are larger.Alternatively, think of the chessboard as a grid and place kings in every other square in such a way that no two are adjacent. For example, in the first row, place kings in columns 1, 3, 5, 7. Then in the second row, skip (no kings). Third row, same as first. Fourth row, skip. Etc. This gives 4 kings per row for 4 rows, totaling 16 kings. But that&#39;s the same as before.Alternatively, stagger the kings between the rows. For instance, in row 1: columns 1, 3, 5, 7. Row 2: columns 2, 4, 6, 8. Row 3: columns 1, 3, 5, 7. Row 4: columns 2, 4, 6, 8. But as I thought before, the kings in row 1 and row 2 are diagonally adjacent. For example, the king at (1,1) is diagonally adjacent to (2,2), which would have a king. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, separate the kings by two rows. For example, place kings in row 1, skip row 2 and 3, place kings in row 4, etc. But that would reduce the number of kings.Alternatively, maybe use a 3x3 grid pattern where each king is centered in a 3x3 area. But this would lead to fewer kings. Wait, 8 divided by 3 is approximately 2.66, so maybe 2 per dimension, leading to 4 per 3x3 area, but this is getting too vague.Wait, let me try to think of a specific arrangement. Suppose we place a king on a1, a3, a5, a7; then on b2, b4, b6, b8; then c1, c3, c5, c7; d2, d4, d6, d8; and so on. So, alternating rows between starting on column 1 and column 2. Let me check adjacency. For example, the king on a1 is adjacent to a2, b1, and b2. The next king on a3 is adjacent to a4, b3, b4. The king on b2 is adjacent to a1, a2, a3, b1, b3, c1, c2, c3. Wait, the king on b2 is adjacent to a1 (which has a king) diagonally. So a1 and b2 are diagonally adjacent, which is an attack. Therefore, this arrangement doesn&#39;t work.So that approach fails because the staggered columns in adjacent rows lead to diagonal attacks. Hmm. So perhaps we need to have at least one row between each row of kings. For example, place kings on row 1, skip row 2, place kings on row 3, etc. Then, in each occupied row, place kings every other column. So each row has 4 kings, and there are 4 such rows (rows 1,3,5,7). Total kings: 4x4=16. Same as before. Alternatively, maybe shift the columns in the next occupied row. For example, row 1: columns 1,3,5,7; row 3: columns 2,4,6,8; row 5: columns 1,3,5,7; row 7: columns 2,4,6,8. But in this case, the kings in row 1 and row 3 are two rows apart, so they are not adjacent vertically. However, diagonally, a king in row 1, column 1 and row 3, column 2 are two squares apart diagonally, so they don&#39;t attack each other. Similarly, the horizontal distance is 1, vertical distance is 2. So that&#39;s safe. Therefore, in this arrangement, the kings are spaced two rows apart and shifted by one column. So in total, we have 4 rows x 4 columns = 16 kings. But wait, is there a way to add more kings?Wait, maybe alternate the pattern differently. For example, in row 1: columns 1,4,7; row 2: columns 3,6; row 3: columns 2,5,8; row 4: columns 1,4,7; etc. But this might lead to some overlaps. Alternatively, it&#39;s getting too complicated. Let me think of the chessboard as a grid where each cell is a square, and I need to place as many kings as possible such that each has no neighbors.Another approach: think of the kings as needing to be at least two squares apart in all directions. So each king needs a plus-shaped area of 3x3 around them where no other king is placed. But this might not be accurate because diagonally, they only need one square buffer. Wait, a king placed at (x,y) attacks all squares (x±1, y±1). So to prevent another king from attacking, no other king can be placed in those squares. Therefore, each king effectively blocks a 3x3 area around itself. So, how many non-overlapping 3x3 squares can fit on an 8x8 chessboard? Well, 8 divided by 3 is about 2.66, so 2 per dimension, leading to 4 areas. But this would only allow 4 kings, which is way too low. So this method isn&#39;t correct.Alternatively, overlapping is allowed as long as the kings themselves are not placed in attacked squares. So perhaps the problem is similar to placing as many non-attacking kings as possible, which is a standard chess problem. I recall that the maximum number of non-attacking kings on a chessboard is 16, achieved by placing them on every other square in a checkerboard pattern. Wait, but earlier I thought that placing them on all squares of one color would result in 32 kings, but they would attack each other diagonally. Wait, no, if you place them on every other square such that no two are adjacent, which would be like a checkerboard pattern but skipping a square each time. Wait, actually, maybe it&#39;s 16.Wait, let&#39;s think. If we divide the chessboard into 2x2 blocks, each block can contain 1 king. Since there are 16 such blocks (8x8 divided by 2x2), then 16 kings. Alternatively, if you color the chessboard in four colors in a 2x2 repeating pattern, then each color class would have 16 squares, and placing one king per color would give 16. But perhaps there&#39;s a better way.Wait, actually, according to some references I recall, the maximum number of non-attacking kings on an 8x8 chessboard is indeed 16. For example, by placing them on all squares of one color in a checkerboard pattern where each color is used every other square both in row and column. Wait, but that&#39;s the same as dividing into 2x2 blocks. Let me verify this.Imagine coloring the chessboard with four colors in a 2x2 repeating pattern: Color 1: (even row, even column)Color 2: (even row, odd column)Color 3: (odd row, even column)Color 4: (odd row, odd column)But each 2x2 block has all four colors. If we choose one color from each 2x2 block, we can place a king on each selected color. Since each 2x2 block contributes one king, and there are 16 blocks, we get 16 kings. Since kings in different blocks are not adjacent, this works. Therefore, 16 is achievable.But is 16 the maximum? Suppose we try to place 17 kings. By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we divide the chessboard into 16 regions (the 2x2 blocks), placing 17 kings would require at least one region to contain two kings, which would attack each other. Therefore, 16 is the maximum. But wait, is this division into 2x2 blocks the only way? What if we partition the board differently?Suppose we partition the board into 16 regions, each of size 2x2. Then, each region can have at most one king. Hence, 16 is the upper bound. Therefore, according to the Pigeonhole Principle, you cannot place more than 16 kings without two being in the same region, hence attacking each other. Therefore, 16 is the maximum.Alternatively, is there a more efficient partitioning? For example, using overlapping regions or different region sizes. But since each king requires a 3x3 area free of other kings, I think the 2x2 partitioning is the most straightforward and tightest. Therefore, the maximum number is 16.Wait, but let me check an actual arrangement. If I place a king on every other square both horizontally and vertically, like a checkerboard but with two squares between them. So, for example:Row 1: columns 1, 3, 5, 7 (4 kings)Row 3: columns 1, 3, 5, 7Row 5: sameRow 7: sameThat&#39;s 4 kings per row, 4 rows, total 16 kings. Each king is two squares apart from the next in all directions. Therefore, they don&#39;t attack each other. Yes, this works. And in this arrangement, there&#39;s no way to add another king without overlapping or being adjacent. For example, if you try to place a king in row 2, column 2, it would be adjacent to the king in row 1, column 1. Similarly, any other square would be adjacent to an existing king. So 16 is indeed the maximum.Therefore, the answer should be 16.Final AnswerThe maximum number of non-attacking kings is boxed{16}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of kings that can be placed on a chessboard such that no two kings attack each other, we need to ensure that each king is not adjacent to another king either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 1. Understanding the Attack Range: A king can attack any square adjacent to it, including diagonally adjacent squares. Therefore, each king must be placed such that there is at least one square between it and any other king in all directions.2. Checkerboard Pattern Consideration: Placing kings on every other square in a checkerboard pattern (alternating colors) was considered, but diagonally adjacent squares of the same color would still allow kings to attack each other. This approach does not work.3. 2x2 Block Partitioning: Dividing the chessboard into 2x2 blocks. Each block can contain at most one king, as placing a king in one square of the block would attack the other three squares. The chessboard is 8x8, leading to 16 such blocks (4 blocks per row and 4 rows). This results in 16 non-attacking kings.4. Verification with Pigeonhole Principle: If we attempt to place more than 16 kings, the Pigeonhole Principle states that at least one 2x2 block would contain more than one king, leading to an attack. Thus, 16 is the maximum number achievable.5. Arrangement Example: Placing kings in every other square both horizontally and vertically, such as in rows 1, 3, 5, 7 with columns 1, 3, 5, 7, ensures no two kings are adjacent. This arrangement results in 16 kings.Thus, the maximum number of non-attacking kings that can be placed on a chessboard is (boxed{16}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of kings that can be placed on a chessboard without any two attacking each other. Hmm. Let&#39;s start by recalling how a king moves in chess. A king can move one square in any direction—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. That means if two kings are placed on adjacent squares (including diagonally adjacent), they can attack each other. So the problem is to place as many kings as possible on the 8x8 chessboard such that none are adjacent.First, maybe I can visualize a chessboard. It&#39;s 8 rows by 8 columns. If I place a king on a square, then all the surrounding squares in all eight directions become unavailable for other kings. So each king effectively blocks off its own square and the eight surrounding squares. But since kings can&#39;t overlap, each needs their own square, so maybe there&#39;s a pattern where we can place kings in such a way that they are spaced out appropriately.Wait, but how do you maximize the number? If each king takes up a 3x3 area, then maybe the maximum number would be roughly the total squares divided by 9, but since the board is 8x8, that would give about 64/9 ≈ 7.1, which doesn&#39;t make much sense. That calculation probably isn&#39;t the right approach because the blocked areas overlap at the edges.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a tiling pattern. If you place kings every other square, like in a checkerboard pattern. Let&#39;s think. A checkerboard alternates between black and white squares. If you place kings on all the black squares, then none of them would be adjacent. Wait, no, because on a checkerboard, each black square is adjacent diagonally to other black squares. Wait, no, actually in the checkerboard pattern, each square is surrounded by squares of the opposite color. So if you place kings on all the black squares, then each king is adjacent (diagonally) to other black squares. So that wouldn&#39;t work because diagonally adjacent kings attack each other. So a checkerboard pattern with kings on every other square would actually result in kings attacking each other.So maybe a different pattern. Maybe if you leave two squares between kings in every direction. For example, in a 2x2 grid, you can place a king in the top-left corner, then skip a row and a column, place another, and so on. But let&#39;s try to formalize this.If we divide the chessboard into 2x2 blocks, each block can hold at most one king. Because if you place a king in one square of the 2x2 block, the other three squares are adjacent to it. So in each 2x2 block, only one king. Since the chessboard is 8x8, that&#39;s 16 blocks of 2x2 (since 8/2=4, so 4x4 blocks). So 16 blocks, each holding one king, would give 16 kings. But is that the maximum? Because 16 seems low. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a way to arrange more kings by offsetting the pattern.Alternatively, maybe a staggered pattern. For example, in one row, place a king every other square, then in the next row, offset by one and do the same, but then check if they attack diagonally. Wait, let me sketch this mentally.Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - K - K - K - KRow 3: K - K - K - K -And so on. But in this case, the kings in Row 1 are diagonally adjacent to the kings in Row 2. For example, the first king in Row 1 (column 1) is diagonally adjacent to the first king in Row 2 (column 2). So they would attack each other. So that&#39;s not allowed. So this pattern doesn&#39;t work.Hmm. So maybe need to leave more space between rows. Let&#39;s think. If we place kings in every other square in a row, then skip a row, and place them again in the same pattern. So that vertically, they are separated by a row. Let&#39;s see:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - - - - - - - -Row 3: K - K - K - K -Row 4: - - - - - - - -And so on. In this case, each king is separated by one row from the kings below and above. Then horizontally, they are separated by one column. So in this case, the kings are spaced two squares apart both horizontally and vertically. Then diagonally, the distance would be sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(8), which is more than one square, so they can&#39;t attack diagonally. So this arrangement might work. Let&#39;s count how many kings this would result in.Each &quot;active&quot; row (rows 1, 3, 5, 7) would have 4 kings (since every other square in 8 columns gives 4). There are 4 active rows, so total kings would be 4 * 4 = 16. Wait, that&#39;s the same as the 2x2 block method. So this gives 16 kings. But is this the maximum?Wait, maybe there&#39;s a more efficient arrangement. Let&#39;s think. If we stagger the kings in adjacent rows but shifted by one, but without overlapping the diagonals. For example, like a brick wall pattern.Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - K - K - K - KRow 3: K - K - K - K -Row 4: - K - K - K - KEtc. Wait, but in this case, each king in Row 1 is diagonally adjacent to the kings in Row 2. So for example, the king at Row 1, Column 1 is diagonally adjacent to the king at Row 2, Column 2. So they would attack each other. So that&#39;s not allowed. So this pattern doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe shift by two columns? Let&#39;s see:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - - K - K - K - K (but shifted two)Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think again.If we place a king in Row 1, Column 1, then in Row 2, we can&#39;t place in Column 1 or 2. So maybe in Row 2, Column 3. Then Row 1, Column 3 is already occupied? Wait, maybe not. Wait, no, if Row 1 has a king at Column 1, then Row 2, Column 1 and 2 are attacked. So in Row 2, starting from Column 3, place a king. Then in Row 1, the next king would be at Column 5, and so on. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, maybe partition the chessboard into 3x3 squares, but that might be too restrictive. Each 3x3 square can have at most one king. But 8 isn&#39;t divisible by 3, so this might not fit.Alternatively, use the concept of the Pigeonhole Principle. The problem is tagged with the Pigeonhole Principle, so maybe that&#39;s a hint.But let&#39;s think of coloring the chessboard in a way that maximizes the number of non-adjacent squares. For example, if we color the board in four colors in a repeating 2x2 pattern: color A, color B, color A, color B, etc., then color C, color D, color C, color D, etc. Wait, maybe that&#39;s overcomplicating. Alternatively, using a four-coloring where each color class is non-adjacent even diagonally. For example, if we divide the board into 2x2 blocks and assign each block a color, but I&#39;m not sure.Wait, actually, the maximum independent set for kings on a chessboard. Wait, in graph theory terms, each square is a vertex, and edges connect squares that are adjacent (including diagonally). Then the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph.For an 8x8 grid, the maximum independent set for kings is a known result, but since I need to figure it out, let&#39;s proceed.Alternatively, perhaps a checkerboard colorings. If we color the board in the standard black and white checkerboard pattern, then each king on a black square attacks only white squares, and vice versa. So the maximum independent set would be 32, but since diagonally adjacent squares are considered, but in the checkerboard pattern, two squares of the same color are not adjacent (even diagonally). Wait, no. Wait, in the standard checkerboard, two black squares are diagonally adjacent. For example, the square (1,1) is black, and (2,2) is also black. So those two squares are diagonally adjacent, which would mean that placing kings on both would result in them attacking each other. Therefore, the checkerboard coloring doesn&#39;t work because same-colored squares are diagonally adjacent.Therefore, maybe a different coloring. Let&#39;s consider a four-coloring. If we color the board in a 2x2 repeating pattern:A B A B ...C D C D ...A B A B ...C D C D ......In this case, each color class (A, B, C, D) is spaced two squares apart. So any two squares of the same color are not adjacent, even diagonally. Because, for example, color A is at (1,1), (1,3), ..., (3,1), (3,3), etc. The distance between any two A squares is at least two squares apart in any direction. Therefore, placing a king on each square of a single color would result in no two kings attacking each other. Each color class has 16 squares (since 8x8 divided by 4). So 16 kings. But wait, this seems similar to the earlier 2x2 block idea. But is 16 the maximum?But wait, maybe we can use two color classes. For example, colors A and B. If they are not adjacent, perhaps combining two non-adjacent color classes. Wait, but if color A and color B are adjacent in the 2x2 pattern. For example, in the 2x2 block:A BC DSo A is adjacent to B and C. Therefore, we can&#39;t combine A and B, since they are adjacent. However, perhaps A and D are not adjacent. Let me check. In the 2x2 coloring, A is at (1,1), B at (1,2), C at (2,1), D at (2,2). So A is adjacent to B, C, and D. Similarly, D is adjacent to B, C, and A. So combining color A and D would still have adjacency. Therefore, you can&#39;t combine color classes.Therefore, each color class is an independent set of size 16. So 16 kings. But is this the maximum?Wait, perhaps another arrangement allows more than 16. Let me try to manually place kings in a different pattern.Suppose in the first row, place kings on columns 1, 3, 5, 7. Then skip the next row. In the third row, place kings starting at column 2, 4, 6, 8. Then skip the fourth row. Then fifth row like the first, and so on.So rows 1,3,5,7 have kings on columns 1,3,5,7. Rows 2,4,6,8 have kings on columns 2,4,6,8. Wait, but then the kings in row 1 and row 3 would be diagonally adjacent. For example, row 1, column 1 is adjacent diagonally to row 2, column 2. But if row 2 has no kings, then row 3, column 2 is a king? Wait, no. Let me clarify.Wait, let&#39;s define the pattern again:- Odd rows (1,3,5,7): kings on odd columns (1,3,5,7)- Even rows (2,4,6,8): kings on even columns (2,4,6,8)But then, for example, the king at (1,1) is diagonally adjacent to (2,2), which is a king in the even row. So they would attack each other. Therefore, this arrangement doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if we shift the pattern by one column in alternate rows. For example:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - K - K - K - KRow 3: K - K - K - K -Row 4: - K - K - K - K...But as previously thought, this results in diagonal adjacents between Row 1 and Row 2. So that&#39;s invalid.Alternatively, skip a row between each king row. So:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - - - - - - - -Row 3: K - K - K - K -Row 4: - - - - - - - -...This way, the vertical distance between kings is two rows, so no vertical or diagonal attacks. And horizontally, they&#39;re spaced by one column, so no horizontal attacks. This gives 4 kings per row * 4 rows = 16 kings. Same as before.Alternatively, maybe intersperse more kings. Suppose in even rows, we place kings shifted by two columns from the odd rows. For example:Row 1: K - - K - - K -Row 2: - - K - - K - -Row 3: K - - K - - K -Row 4: - - K - - K - -...But let&#39;s check adjacency. The king at (1,1) is two columns away from (1,4), so no problem. In the next row, (2,3) is two rows down and two columns over from (1,1). The distance is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2)=sqrt(8) which is more than one, so they don&#39;t attack. Similarly, (2,3) is two columns right and one row down from (1,1), but distance is sqrt(1^2 + 2^2)=sqrt(5) &gt;1. So this works. How many kings is this? Each active row (Rows 1,2,3,4,...) alternates between placing 3 kings and 2 kings? Wait, no. Let&#39;s count:In Row 1: columns 1,4,7 → 3 kingsRow 2: columns 3,6 → 2 kingsRow 3: columns 1,4,7 → 3 kingsRow 4: columns 3,6 → 2 kingsRow 5: same as Row 1Row 6: same as Row 2Row 7: same as Row 1Row 8: same as Row 2Total kings: (3+2)*4 = 5*4=20. Wait, 20? That&#39;s more than 16. But is this arrangement valid?Wait, let&#39;s check if any two kings attack each other. Take Row 1, Column 1. The adjacent squares would be Row 2, Columns 1 and 2. But in Row 2, there&#39;s a king at Column 3. So Row 1, Column 1 is safe. The king at Row 1, Column 4. Adjacent squares in Row 2 would be Columns 3,4,5. There is a king at Column 3 in Row 2. So the king at Row 1, Column 4 is adjacent diagonally to Row 2, Column 3. Wait, yes! Because (1,4) and (2,3) are diagonally adjacent. So those two kings attack each other. Oh, that&#39;s a problem. So this arrangement is invalid.Therefore, that approach doesn&#39;t work.Hmm. So maybe trying to find a different tiling.Alternatively, what if we divide the chessboard into 3x3 sections? But 8 isn&#39;t divisible by 3. Alternatively, using a pattern that repeats every two rows but shifts the columns.Wait, let&#39;s think about smaller boards first to see a pattern. Maybe solving for a smaller chessboard and then extrapolating.For a 1x1 board: obviously 1 king.For a 2x2 board: maximum 1 king, since placing a king in any square attacks all others.For a 3x3 board: maximum 1 king? No, wait. Wait, if you place a king in the center, then you can&#39;t place any others. But if you place kings in non-adjacent squares. Wait, in 3x3, the maximum is actually 1, because any two squares are adjacent either orthogonally or diagonally. Wait, no. Let&#39;s check. If you place kings on (1,1) and (3,3), they are diagonally adjacent, so they attack. If you place on (1,1) and (1,3), they are two squares apart horizontally, so not adjacent. Wait, in 3x3, can you place two kings?Yes. For example:K - K- - -K - KBut wait, in 3x3, that would be:Row 1: K - KRow 2: - - -Row 3: K - KBut here, the kings at (1,1) and (1,3) are two squares apart, so they don&#39;t attack. Similarly, (1,1) and (3,1) are two squares apart vertically, so no attack. But (1,1) and (3,3) are diagonally two squares apart, which is not an attack. Wait, a king can move one square, so attack only occurs if distance is one. So two squares apart is safe. Therefore, in a 3x3 chessboard, you can place 4 kings: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3). Wait, but then each of these is diagonally two squares apart, so they don&#39;t attack each other. Wait, that&#39;s possible. Wait, let me check:Distance between (1,1) and (1,3) is 2 horizontally, which is safe.Distance between (1,1) and (3,1) is 2 vertically, safe.Distance between (1,1) and (3,3) is 2 diagonally (sqrt(8)), which is more than one, so safe.Similarly, between (1,3) and (3,3) is 2 vertically.So in a 3x3 board, maximum 4 kings. Wait, that&#39;s interesting.Wait, but in that case, maybe for the 8x8 board, we can use a similar approach. Divide the board into 3x3 sections, but since 8 isn&#39;t divisible by 3, maybe overlap them. But this might complicate things.Alternatively, for even-sized boards, perhaps a different approach.Wait, but let&#39;s get back to the original problem. The standard answer for the maximum number of non-attacking kings on an 8x8 chessboard is 16. But according to the previous 2x2 block method. However, in my earlier wrong attempt, I thought of a 3x3 pattern for smaller boards allowing more.Wait, but maybe the maximum is actually higher. Let me check.Suppose we use a pattern like this:In each 2x3 rectangle, place two kings.For example:K - K- K -This pattern can be tiled across the board. Let&#39;s see. For a 2x3 block, placing kings at (1,1), (1,3), and (2,2). Wait, but (1,1) and (2,2) are diagonally adjacent. So that&#39;s a conflict. Hmm.Alternatively, place kings in a staggered pattern where each row alternates the positions, ensuring no two are adjacent. For example:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - K - K - K - KRow 3: K - K - K - K -Row 4: - K - K - K - K...But as established before, this causes diagonal conflicts between rows 1 and 2.Alternatively, skip a row between each set. So:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - - - - - - - -Row 3: - K - K - K - KRow 4: - - - - - - - -Row 5: K - K - K - K -Row 6: - - - - - - - -Row 7: - K - K - K - KRow 8: - - - - - - - -This way, each active row is separated by a blank row. In this arrangement, the kings in Row 1 are spaced with one column between them, and the next set in Row 3 are shifted right by one. However, vertically, they are two rows apart, so no vertical or diagonal attacks. But in this case, how many kings do we have? Each active row (1,3,5,7) has 4 kings. So 4*4=16. Same as before.But wait, in this arrangement, the kings in Row 1 and Row 3 are two rows apart and one column apart. So the distance between a king in Row 1, Column 1 and Row 3, Column 2 is sqrt(2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(5) &gt;1, so they don&#39;t attack each other. Similarly, other kings are safe. So this works, but still gives 16.But perhaps there&#39;s a way to place more by using a different pattern. Let me think of another approach.Imagine coloring the board in four colors in a repeating 2x2 pattern. Let&#39;s say:A B A B ...C D C D ...A B A B ...C D C D ...Each color class (A, B, C, D) has 16 squares. Placing kings on one color class gives 16 non-attacking kings, as before. However, maybe combining two color classes that are not adjacent. For example, colors A and C are not adjacent? Wait, in the 2x2 block:A BC DSo color A is adjacent to B, C, and D. Similarly, color C is adjacent to A, B, and D. Therefore, colors A and C are adjacent (they touch vertically). So combining A and C would result in adjacent squares. Similarly for others. So no two color classes can be combined.Alternatively, if we use a different coloring. For example, a checkerboard pattern with four colors, such that each color is spaced two squares apart. For example:A B C D A B C DB C D A B C D AC D A B C D A BD A B C D A B CA B C D A B C D...But this seems complex. Each color would be on squares that are two apart in both directions. So, for example, color A is at (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (3,7), (5,1), (5,5), etc. Each of these is two squares apart from the others. If we place kings on all color A squares, then they are not adjacent to each other. Let&#39;s check:The distance between (1,1) and (1,5) is 4 horizontally—safe.The distance between (1,1) and (3,3) is 2 diagonally—sqrt(8), which is more than 1. Safe.Similarly, between (3,3) and (5,5)—distance 2 diagonally.So in this coloring, color A has 16 squares (since 8x8 / 4 = 16), and placing kings on all color A squares would result in 16 non-attacking kings. So again, same number.Hmm. So all these methods give 16. Is 16 the maximum? Maybe yes. But let me try to see if I can find an arrangement with more.Suppose I try to place kings in every other column, but alternate rows with offset.For example:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: K - K - K - K -Row 3: - K - K - K - KRow 4: - K - K - K - KRow 5: K - K - K - K -Row 6: K - K - K - K -Row 7: - K - K - K - KRow 8: - K - K - K - KWait, but in this case, adjacent rows have kings offset. Let&#39;s check adjacency. For example, Row 1 has kings at columns 1,3,5,7. Row 2 has the same. So vertically, they are adjacent. Kings in Row 1, Column 1 and Row 2, Column 1 are on top of each other, which is invalid. Also, even if shifted, if Row 2 is same as Row 1, then vertical adjacency. So this is invalid.Alternatively, offset every other row. For example:Row 1: K - K - K - K -Row 2: - K - K - K - KRow 3: K - K - K - K -Row 4: - K - K - K - K...But this brings us back to the earlier problem where diagonally adjacent kings attack. For example, Row 1, Column 1 and Row 2, Column 2 are diagonally adjacent. So they attack each other.Hmm. So maybe this approach won&#39;t work.Alternatively, is there a way to tile the board with shapes that each hold multiple kings, spaced apart?Wait, for example, a domino tiling. Each domino covers two squares. But if we place a king on each domino, but ensuring they don&#39;t attack. Not sure.Alternatively, consider that each king requires a 3x3 area, but overlapping. The total number would be floor((8 + 2)/3)^2 = floor(10/3)^2 = 3^2=9? No, that seems too low.Alternatively, use the formula for the maximum independent set for kings on an n x n chessboard. I think the formula is floor((n + 1)/2)^2. For n=8, that would be (8+1)/2=4.5, floored to 4. So 4^2=16. Hence, 16. So that suggests 16 is the correct answer.But let me check for smaller boards. For example, n=1: 1. Correct. n=2: floor((2+1)/2)^2 = floor(1.5)=1, 1^2=1. Correct, since a 2x2 board can have 1 king. For n=3: floor(4/2)=2, so 4. Which matches our earlier 3x3 example. Wait, 3x3 can actually fit 4 kings. So formula floor((3+1)/2)^2 = 2^2=4. Correct.Similarly, n=4: floor(5/2)=2, so 4 kings. Wait, a 4x4 board. If we use the 2x2 block method, each block holds one king. 4 blocks, so 4 kings. But can we fit more? Let&#39;s see:For a 4x4 board:K - K -- K - KK - K -- K - KThis arrangement places kings on alternating squares, resulting in 8 kings. Wait, but then each king is adjacent diagonally to another. For example, (1,1) and (2,2) are diagonally adjacent. So they attack each other. So this is invalid.Wait, the maximum for 4x4 should be 4 kings. Using the 2x2 block method. Each block holds 1 king, so 4. Alternatively, using the formula floor((4+1)/2)^2=2.5 floored to 2, 2^2=4. So correct.Therefore, the formula seems to hold. So for even n, floor((n+1)/2)^2 = (n/2)^2. For n=8: (8/2)^2=16. So 16. Hence, the maximum number of non-attacking kings on an 8x8 chessboard is 16.Therefore, after all these considerations and checking smaller cases and formulas, I think the answer is 16.&lt;/think&gt;The maximum number of non-attacking kings on an 8x8 chessboard is achieved by placing them on every other square in a staggered pattern, ensuring no two kings are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. By dividing the board into 2x2 blocks and placing one king in each block, we effectively prevent any mutual attacks. This results in 16 kings.Answer: boxed{16}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-f09ae572></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>🔑:</span>If in a square of four cells there are two kings, then they attack each other.## SolutionWe will divide the board into 16 squares 2 times 2.Estimate.

These numbers are called superstitious numbers. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem properly. A superstitious number N satisfies N = 13 * (sum of its digits). So, for example, if a number has digits that add up to 5, then 13*5 = 65 would be a superstitious number if 65&#39;s digits add up to 5. Wait, but 6 + 5 = 11, which is not 5, so 65 wouldn&#39;t be one. Got it. So the number must satisfy both conditions: being 13 times the digit sum and also that digit sum must actually correspond to the digits of the number itself. Let me formalize this. Let N be the number, and let S(N) be the sum of its digits. Then N = 13 * S(N). So, I need to find all such N where this equation holds. First, I should consider how large N can be. Let&#39;s think about the maximum possible sum of digits for a number with d digits. The maximum sum for a d-digit number is 9d (if all digits are 9). So, N = 13 * S(N) &lt;= 13 * 9d. But N is a d-digit number, so it must be &gt;= 10^{d-1}. Therefore, we have 10^{d-1} &lt;= 13 * 9d. This inequality can help me bound the number of digits possible for N. Let me compute this for different values of d:- For d=1: 10^{0}=1 &lt;= 13*9*1=117. True.- For d=2: 10^{1}=10 &lt;= 13*9*2=234. True.- For d=3: 10^{2}=100 &lt;= 13*9*3=351. True.- For d=4: 10^{3}=1000 &lt;= 13*9*4=468. False. So, the maximum possible number of digits is 3. Wait, but when d=4, 10^3=1000 is greater than 468. Therefore, N can have at most 3 digits. That simplifies things! So, all superstitious numbers must be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. But let&#39;s check that logic again. The inequality is 10^{d-1} &lt;= 13*9d. For d=4, the right side is 13*9*4=468. The left side is 10^{3}=1000. 1000 &gt; 468, so no 4-digit number can satisfy N=13*S(N). Therefore, all possible solutions must be 3-digit numbers or less. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Let&#39;s see: Suppose a number has d digits. The minimal number with d digits is 10^{d-1}, and the maximum possible digit sum is 9d, so N = 13*S(N) &lt;= 13*9d. Therefore, 10^{d-1} &lt;= 117d. Let&#39;s compute this for d=3: 10^{2}=100 &lt;= 117*3=351. Yes. For d=4: 10^3=1000 &lt;= 117*4=468. No. So indeed, d cannot be 4 or more. So, we can focus on 1, 2, and 3-digit numbers. Therefore, the possible numbers are between 1 and 999. But 13*S(N) must equal N. So, let&#39;s check numbers in this range. But how?Alternatively, perhaps working with the equation N = 13 * S(N). Let&#39;s let S(N) = k, so N = 13k. Therefore, the sum of digits of 13k must be k. So, the problem reduces to finding all k such that S(13k) = k, and 13k is a number (so k must be such that 13k is an integer, which it is as long as k is integer). Therefore, we need to find all integers k where the sum of digits of 13k is equal to k. Also, since N =13k must be a 1, 2, or 3-digit number, k must satisfy 13k &lt;= 999, so k &lt;= floor(999/13) = 76.846..., so k &lt;=76. Also, since N is at least 1, k is at least 1. Therefore, k ranges from 1 to 76. But 76 is still a lot of numbers to check. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter way. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s think about how the sum of digits of 13k relates to k. For example, let&#39;s suppose k is a small number. Let me try some small k values:k=1: N=13*1=13. Sum of digits:1+3=4≠1. Not good.k=2: N=26. Sum=2+6=8≠2. No.k=3: 39. Sum=3+9=12≠3.k=4: 52. Sum=5+2=7≠4.k=5:65. Sum=6+5=11≠5.k=6:78. Sum=7+8=15≠6.k=7:91. Sum=9+1=10≠7.k=8:104. Sum=1+0+4=5≠8. k=9:117. Sum=1+1+7=9. Oh! 9=9. So here, k=9, N=117. The sum of digits is 1+1+7=9, which is equal to k. So, 117 is a superstitious number. That&#39;s one solution. Let me check that again. 13*9=117. 1+1+7=9. Yes, so 117 is a superstitious number. Continuing:k=10: N=130. Sum=1+3+0=4≠10.k=11:143. Sum=1+4+3=8≠11.k=12:156. Sum=1+5+6=12. Hey, 12=12! So, 156 is another superstitious number. Wait, 13*12=156. 1+5+6=12. Correct. So 156 is another solution. k=13:169. Sum=1+6+9=16≠13.k=14:182. Sum=1+8+2=11≠14.k=15:195. Sum=1+9+5=15. So, 15=15. Thus, 195 is another superstitious number. k=16:208. Sum=2+0+8=10≠16.k=17:221. Sum=2+2+1=5≠17.k=18:234. Sum=2+3+4=9≠18.k=19:247. Sum=2+4+7=13≠19.k=20:260. Sum=2+6+0=8≠20.k=21:273. Sum=2+7+3=12≠21.k=22:286. Sum=2+8+6=16≠22.k=23:299. Sum=2+9+9=20≠23.k=24:312.

Sum=8+5+8=21≠66.k=67:871. Sum=8+7+1=16≠67.k=68:884. Sum=8+8+4=20≠68.k=69:897. Sum=8+9+7=24≠69.k=70:910. Sum=9+1+0=10≠70.k=71:923. Sum=9+2+3=14≠71.k=72:936. Sum=9+3+6=18≠72.k=73:949. Sum=9+4+9=22≠73.k=74:962. Sum=9+6+2=17≠74.k=75:975. Sum=9+7+5=21≠75.k=76:988. Sum=9+8+8=25≠76.Okay, so after checking k from 1 to 76, the only values where S(13k) = k are k=9 (117), k=12 (156), and k=15 (195). Let me verify these once more to be sure.For k=9: 13*9=117. 1+1+7=9. Correct.For k=12:13*12=156.1+5+6=12. Correct.For k=15:13*15=195.1+9+5=15. Correct.Are there any other possible numbers? Let&#39;s see. When k=18, N=234. Sum=2+3+4=9≠18. Not equal. Similarly, k=21, sum=12. So no.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a number with more digits? Wait, earlier analysis said that numbers can only be up to 3 digits. So, maybe these three are the only ones. But let me check if there are any 2-digit numbers. For example, let&#39;s check k=6: 13*6=78. Sum=7+8=15≠6. Not. k=5:65, sum=11≠5. k=4:52, sum=7≠4. So no 2-digit numbers. Similarly, 1-digit numbers: 13*1=13, sum=4≠1. So only 3-digit numbers. So, the superstitious numbers are 117, 156, and 195. Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s a possibility that k=0. Then N=0. But 0 is a number, sum of digits 0. So 0=13*0. That&#39;s true. So is 0 considered a superstitious number? The problem says &quot;a number is superstitious when it is equal to 13 times the sum of its digits.&quot; 0 satisfies 0=13*0. However, sometimes in these problems, they might be looking for positive integers. Let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;Find all superstitious numbers.&quot; So unless specified otherwise, 0 might be included. But 0 is a number. Let&#39;s check the sum of its digits. The sum of the digits of 0 is 0. So 0=13*0. Therefore, 0 is a superstitious number. However, maybe the problem is considering positive integers. But the problem didn&#39;t specify. Hmm. So, the question is, should 0 be included? In many digit-related problems, 0 is considered a valid number unless stated otherwise. So, maybe 0 is also a solution. However, when we checked k from 1 to 76, we found 117, 156, 195. If k=0, N=0. Let me check the original inequality. For d=1, 10^{0}=1 &lt;= 117, but N=0 is a 1-digit number? Actually, 0 is a 1-digit number in some contexts, but sometimes considered to have no digits. It&#39;s a bit ambiguous. But in the digit sum, 0 has a digit sum of 0. So, if the problem allows 0, then it&#39;s a solution. However, maybe in the problem&#39;s context, they are looking for positive integers. Let&#39;s see. The problem says &quot;a number is superstitious...&quot; without specifying positive, so maybe 0 is allowed. But in the original analysis, when we considered d=1, the minimal number is 1 (10^{0}=1). However, 0 is a 1-digit number in some systems, but not in others. For example, in the standard decimal system, 0 is a single-digit number with the digit 0. So, perhaps 0 should be considered. Therefore, if we include k=0, then N=0 is also a superstitious number. But maybe the problem expects positive integers. Let me check again the problem statement:&quot;We say that a number is superstitious when it is equal to 13 times the sum of its digits. Find all superstitious numbers.&quot;There&#39;s no restriction to positive numbers. So 0 is a valid solution. However, when I initially set k from 1 to 76, because N=13k and N=0 would require k=0. But k is the sum of digits. So, if 0 is considered, then k=0, N=0. So 0 is a solution. But let me check if 0 is considered. In some mathematical contexts, numbers refer to positive integers unless otherwise stated, but the problem says &quot;a number&quot;, which could include 0. However, in the original analysis, when we considered d=1, N &gt;= 1 (10^{0}=1), but 0 is less than that. So, maybe the inequality 10^{d-1} &lt;= N &lt;= 999 doesn&#39;t include 0. Therefore, maybe 0 is excluded. Alternatively, perhaps I should check. If N=0, sum of digits is 0, and 13*0=0. So 0 is a solution. So unless the problem specifies positive numbers, 0 is a solution. But in the context of digit sums, sometimes 0 is considered to have a digit sum of 0, so maybe. Let me check if the problem is from a particular source or competition, but since it&#39;s presented here as a generic problem, I have to go by the given statement. The problem says &quot;Find all superstitious numbers.&quot; Since it&#39;s not restricted to positive integers, 0 should be included. Therefore, the solutions are 0, 117, 156, 195. But wait, when I computed k from 1 to 76, I didn&#39;t get 0. But if k=0, then N=0. So, 0 is a solution. But is 0 considered a superstitious number here? Let&#39;s see. The problem says &quot;a number is superstitious when it is equal to 13 times the sum of its digits&quot;. So, 0=13*0, so yes. Therefore, 0 is a solution. But in the initial analysis, we considered numbers with digits, and 0 is a 1-digit number. But in the inequality 10^{d-1} &lt;= N, for d=1, 10^{0}=1 &lt;= N. So, N &gt;=1. So, 0 is not included in that. Therefore, the previous analysis that d=1,2,3 gives numbers &gt;=1. So, if we follow that, 0 is not included. Hmm, so there is ambiguity here. Let me see. The problem says &quot;a number is superstitious...&quot;, and N=0 is a number. So, if we strictly follow the problem statement, 0 is a solution. But if the problem is intended for positive integers, then 0 is excluded. Since the problem does not specify, maybe both possibilities should be considered. However, in mathematics, unless specified, numbers can include 0. But let&#39;s check if 0 is a possible answer here. Let&#39;s think about the sum of digits of 0. Depending on the convention, the sum of digits of 0 is 0. So, 13*0=0. Therefore, 0 is a solution. But in the problem&#39;s context, maybe they are thinking of positive integers. Let me check when k=0, N=0. So, if the problem allows 0, then it&#39;s a solution. If not, then not. Since the problem didn&#39;t specify, perhaps it&#39;s safer to include 0. However, when I first checked k from 1 to 76, I found 117, 156, and 195. So, if the problem expects multiple answers, maybe these three plus 0. But I need to check if 0 is considered here. Alternatively, let&#39;s check if there are any other single-digit numbers. For example, k=1: N=13, sum=4≠1. k=2:26, sum=8≠2. So, no single-digit numbers except possibly 0. Therefore, depending on the interpretation, 0 might be included. But since the problem is presented in a mathematical context where sometimes 0 is considered a number, but sometimes problems refer to positive integers, it&#39;s a bit of a dilemma. However, given that 0 trivially satisfies the equation, and the problem doesn&#39;t restrict to positive numbers, perhaps 0 should be included. But wait, let me check the sum of digits of 0. If you write 0 as a single digit, the sum is 0. So, 13*0=0. So, yes, 0 is a solution. Therefore, the superstitious numbers are 0, 117, 156, and 195. But in the initial analysis, when we derived that N must be a 3-digit number or less, we used the inequality 10^{d-1} &lt;= N. But 0 is a 1-digit number (depending on convention), but 10^{d-1} where d=1 is 1, so 0 &lt; 1. Therefore, 0 is not covered by that inequality. Therefore, our previous conclusion that N must be 1, 2, or 3-digit is based on N &gt;=1. However, 0 is a separate case. So, if 0 is allowed, then it&#39;s another solution. But perhaps the problem considers numbers as positive integers. Let me think. If I were given this problem in a competition, would they consider 0? Hmm. In many Olympiad problems, numbers refer to positive integers unless stated otherwise. So maybe 0 is excluded here. Therefore, the solutions are 117, 156, and 195. However, in the problem statement as given, since it&#39;s not specified, maybe 0 should be included. Wait, but in the problem statement, the term &quot;superstitious&quot; is probably meant to be in the context of the number 13 being unlucky, so maybe 0 is not considered here. But that&#39;s just my assumption. Alternatively, let&#39;s check the sum of digits for 0. If you consider 0 to have a digit sum of 0, then it&#39;s valid. However, in some digit sum definitions, the digit sum is the sum of all digits, and 0 is just 0. So, in that case, 0 is a valid solution. Given that, perhaps the answer includes 0. However, in the original check from k=1 to 76, we found 117,156,195. Let me check if 0 is considered. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify, maybe it&#39;s safer to mention both possibilities. However, in my earlier checks, when I calculated N for k=0, it&#39;s 0, which is a valid number. Therefore, unless the problem restricts to positive integers, 0 is a solution. But in the initial reasoning, we considered N &gt;=10^{d-1} for d digits, which for d=1 gives N &gt;=1. Therefore, if we follow that logic, N must be at least 1, so 0 is excluded. Therefore, only 117,156,195 are solutions. But in reality, 0 is a 1-digit number in standard decimal representation, but 10^{d-1} for d=1 is 1, which is the smallest 1-digit number. However, 0 is considered a 1-digit number but is less than 10^{0}=1. Therefore, the inequality 10^{d-1} &lt;= N is not satisfied for 0. Therefore, our previous conclusion that N must be at least 1 is correct if we use that inequality. Therefore, 0 is excluded. Thus, the only solutions are 117,156,195. Therefore, the final answer is these three numbers. Final AnswerThe superstitious numbers are boxed{117}, boxed{156}, and boxed{195}.&lt;/think&gt;To find all superstitious numbers, we need to determine numbers ( N ) such that ( N = 13 times ) (sum of its digits). First, we note that a superstitious number ( N ) must satisfy ( N = 13 times S(N) ), where ( S(N) ) is the sum of the digits of ( N ). We consider the range of possible values for ( N ). The maximum sum of digits for a ( d )-digit number is ( 9d ), so ( N leq 13 times 9d ). For ( d )-digit numbers, ( N geq 10^{d-1} ). Solving ( 10^{d-1} leq 13 times 9d ), we find that ( d ) can be at most 3. Therefore, ( N ) must be a 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit number.We then check values of ( k ) (where ( N = 13k )) from 1 to 76 (since ( 13 times 76 = 988 )) to find ( k ) such that the sum of the digits of ( 13k ) equals ( k ). After checking all possible values, we find:- For ( k = 9 ), ( N = 13 times 9 = 117 ), and the sum of digits ( 1 + 1 + 7 = 9 ).- For ( k = 12 ), ( N = 13 times 12 = 156 ), and the sum of digits ( 1 + 5 + 6 = 12 ).- For ( k = 15 ), ( N = 13 times 15 = 195 ), and the sum of digits ( 1 + 9 + 5 = 15 ).We also considered the case for ( k = 0 ), which gives ( N = 0 ). However, since the problem does not explicitly specify including 0 and the initial analysis focused on numbers ( geq 1 ), we conclude the valid superstitious numbers are:[boxed{117}, boxed{156}, text{ and } boxed{195}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find all numbers that are equal to 13 times the sum of their digits. These numbers are called &quot;superstitious&quot; here. Hmm, let&#39;s think about how to approach this.First, let&#39;s define what a superstitious number is. If N is a superstitious number, then N = 13 * S, where S is the sum of its digits. So, I need to find all N such that when you add up the digits of N and multiply by 13, you get N itself.Let me start by considering the possible number of digits N can have. Since 13 is a two-digit number, maybe the superstitious numbers aren&#39;t too big. Let&#39;s check for numbers with different digit lengths.First, single-digit numbers. If N is a single-digit number, then S = N. So, the equation becomes N = 13*N, which implies N = 0. But 0 is a single-digit number, and 13*0 = 0. So, 0 is a superstitious number. Wait, but is 0 considered here? The problem statement doesn&#39;t specify positive numbers, so maybe 0 is included. Let me keep that in mind.Next, two-digit numbers. Let N be a two-digit number. Let’s denote N as 10*a + b, where a is the tens digit (1-9) and b is the units digit (0-9). Then, the sum of the digits S = a + b. The equation becomes:10*a + b = 13*(a + b)Simplify this:10a + b = 13a + 13bSubtract 10a + b from both sides:0 = 3a + 12bSo, 3a + 12b = 0. But since a and b are digits, and a is at least 1 (since it&#39;s a two-digit number), 3a is at least 3. But 12b is non-negative, so the sum can&#39;t be zero. Therefore, there are no two-digit superstitious numbers.Moving on to three-digit numbers. Let N be a three-digit number: 100*a + 10*b + c, where a is 1-9, b and c are 0-9. Sum of digits S = a + b + c. The equation:100a + 10b + c = 13*(a + b + c)Simplify:100a + 10b + c = 13a + 13b + 13cBring all terms to the left side:100a -13a + 10b -13b + c -13c = 0Which simplifies to:87a - 3b -12c = 0Hmm, so 87a = 3b + 12cDivide both sides by 3:29a = b + 4cNow, since a is at least 1 and at most 9, 29a can range from 29 to 261.But b and c are digits (0-9), so b + 4c can range from 0 (if b=0, c=0) to 9 + 4*9 = 45.So, 29a must be between 29 and 45 because 29*1=29 and 29*2=58 (which is already larger than 45). Therefore, a can only be 1. Then 29*1 = 29 = b + 4c. So, b + 4c = 29.But b is a digit (0-9), so 4c must be 29 - b. Since 4c must be a non-negative integer, 29 - b must be between 0 and 29. Also, c must be an integer between 0 and 9.But 4c = 29 - b. Since 4c must be even (as 4 times an integer), but 29 - b must be even. However, 29 is odd, so 29 - b is even only if b is odd. So, b must be odd.Let me list possible values for b (odd digits from 1 to 9) and compute c:If b=1: 4c=28 → c=7. Valid, since c=7 is a digit.If b=3: 4c=26 → c=6.5. Not valid, as c must be integer.If b=5: 4c=24 → c=6. Valid.If b=7: 4c=22 → c=5.5. Not valid.If b=9: 4c=20 → c=5. Valid.So possible solutions here are:b=1, c=7 → N=100*1 + 10*1 +7=117Wait, N=100a +10b +c. a=1, b=1, c=7: N=117.Check: sum of digits 1+1+7=9. 13*9=117. Correct.Next, b=5, c=6: N=100*1 +10*5 +6=156Sum of digits:1+5+6=12. 13*12=156. Correct.Next, b=9, c=5: N=100*1 +10*9 +5=195Sum of digits:1+9+5=15. 13*15=195. Correct.So there are three three-digit superstitious numbers: 117, 156, 195.Wait, but let me confirm these:117: 1+1+7=9, 9*13=117. Yes.156:1+5+6=12, 12*13=156. Yes.195:1+9+5=15, 15*13=195. Yes.So three three-digit numbers.What about four-digit numbers? Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s possible.Let N be a four-digit number: 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Sum of digits S = a + b + c + d.Equation: 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 13*(a + b + c + d)Simplify:1000a + 100b + 10c + d -13a -13b -13c -13d = 0Which is:(1000a -13a) + (100b -13b) + (10c -13c) + (d -13d) = 0So:987a + 87b -3c -12d = 0Hmm. Let&#39;s analyze this equation.987a +87b = 3c +12dLeft side: 987a is at least 987*1=987, and with 87b (b up to 9, so 87*9=783) so total left side can be up to 987*9 +87*9= (987+87)*9=1074*9=9666.Right side: 3c +12d, where c and d are digits (0-9). The maximum is 3*9 +12*9=27+108=135.But left side is at least 987*1 +87*0=987. So 987 &lt;= left side &lt;=9666, while right side &lt;=135. So 987 &lt;= 3c +12d &lt;=135. But 3c +12d can only be up to 135, which is way smaller than the minimum left side (987). Therefore, no four-digit numbers can satisfy the equation.Therefore, four-digit numbers are impossible. Similarly, numbers with more digits will have even larger left sides, so they are impossible. Hence, the only superstitious numbers are 0 (if allowed), and the three three-digit numbers:117,156,195.Wait, but earlier when I considered single-digit numbers, N=0 is a solution. But 0 is a digit, and sum of digits is 0. So 13*0=0. So 0 is indeed a solution.But the problem says &quot;a number is superstitious when it is equal to 13 times the sum of its digits&quot;. So 0 satisfies that. However, sometimes in these problems, leading zeros are not considered, but 0 is just 0. So maybe 0 is a solution. But perhaps the problem is expecting positive integers? Let me check.But the problem didn&#39;t specify positive numbers, so technically, 0 is a solution. However, maybe in the context of the problem, they want positive numbers. Let me verify.If N is a positive integer, then 0 is excluded. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify positive. Let&#39;s see: the problem says &quot;a number&quot;, which can be zero. So 0 is a valid solution.But let me check if 0 is considered here. Let me see:sum of digits of 0 is 0, 13*0=0. So yes. Therefore, 0 is a superstitious number.But in the three-digit numbers, we found 117,156,195. So total four numbers: 0,117,156,195.Wait, but maybe the problem expects only positive numbers. Let me check the original problem again.Original problem: &quot;Find all superstitious numbers.&quot; without any restriction. So 0 is included.But let me see if there are any two-digit numbers. Wait, earlier analysis showed there are no two-digit numbers. So 0 is a single-digit, and then three three-digit numbers.But wait, let me check two-digit numbers again. Suppose N=10a +b, equation 10a +b=13(a +b). Then 10a +b=13a +13b =&gt; 0=3a +12b. Since a is at least 1, 3a is at least 3, 12b is non-negative. So no solution.Therefore, 0 is a solution, and three three-digit numbers.But maybe 0 is trivial, and the problem is expecting the non-zero ones. Let me check.Alternatively, maybe 0 is not considered because it&#39;s trivial, but since the problem statement doesn&#39;t exclude it, we should include it.But let me verify with an example. For example, if N=0, sum of digits is 0, 13*0=0. So yes, it works. So 0 is a valid solution.Therefore, the complete list is 0,117,156,195.But let me check if there are any other numbers. Let&#39;s check four-digit numbers again just to be thorough. But as I saw, the left side is way bigger. Let me confirm with a=1:987*1 +87b = 3c +12d987 +87b = 3c +12dMinimum left side when a=1, b=0: 987 +0 =987. But maximum right side is 135. So impossible. Hence, no four-digit numbers.Similarly, for numbers with more digits, the left side would be even larger.Therefore, all superstitious numbers are 0,117,156,195.But wait, let me check if there are any other numbers with more digits. Let me check a five-digit number for thoroughness. Suppose N is a five-digit number: 10000a + 1000b + 100c +10d +e.Sum of digits S =a +b +c +d +e.Equation: 10000a + 1000b + 100c +10d +e =13*(a +b +c +d +e)So,10000a +1000b +100c +10d +e -13a -13b -13c -13d -13e =0Which simplifies to:(10000a -13a) + (1000b -13b) + (100c -13c) + (10d -13d) + (e -13e)=0So:9987a + 987b + 87c -3d -12e=0Left side: 9987a is at least 9987 (a=1), and with positive contributions from b, c (if any). The right side terms are -3d -12e, which are negative or zero. So even if we take maximum negative contribution, it&#39;s -3*9 -12*9= -27 -108= -135. So left side is 9987a +987b +87c -135. Since a is at least 1, 9987*1=9987, so 9987 -135=9852&gt;0. Therefore, the equation cannot hold. Thus, five-digit numbers and longer are impossible.Therefore, the only possible superstitious numbers are 0,117,156,195.Wait, but let me check if 0 is considered a &quot;number&quot; here. In some contexts, puzzles like this might only consider positive integers, but unless specified, 0 is a valid number. Let me check the problem statement again:&quot;We say that a number is superstitious when it is equal to 13 times the sum of its digits. Find all superstitious numbers.&quot;There&#39;s no restriction, so 0 should be included. However, sometimes in digit problems, 0 is excluded because it&#39;s trivial, but unless stated, I think it should be included.But let&#39;s check if 0 is the only single-digit number, and the rest are three-digit. So the answer is 0,117,156,195. However, maybe the problem expects only positive numbers, so excluding 0. Let me verify the three numbers:117: works.156: works.195: works.0: works.But maybe the problem is in a context where numbers are positive integers. If that&#39;s the case, the answer is 117,156,195.But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, I should include 0. However, in some cases, leading zeros are not allowed, but 0 is just 0. So perhaps both possibilities. Wait, but let me check if there are any other two-digit numbers. Wait, maybe N=00? But 00 is just 0, which is already considered.Alternatively, maybe numbers like 013, but those are not valid numbers. So no.Therefore, the complete list is 0,117,156,195.But let me check if there are any other three-digit numbers. Wait, when we had a=1, but 29a=29. So for a=1, we found three possibilities. If a=2, 29*2=58. Then b +4c=58. But b is a digit (0-9), so 4c=58 -b. The maximum 4c can be is 58 -0=58. But since c is a digit (0-9), 4c can be at most 36. But 58 &gt; 36. So no solutions. Therefore, a cannot be 2 or higher. So in the three-digit case, only a=1 gives possible solutions.Therefore, the four numbers are 0,117,156,195.But let me check if 0 is considered here. If the problem expects natural numbers, which usually start from 1, then 0 is excluded. But the problem says &quot;number&quot;, which in mathematics includes 0. However, sometimes in such problems, especially if it&#39;s an Olympiad-style problem, 0 might be considered trivial and excluded. Let me check with the equation:For N=0: sum of digits is 0, 13*0=0. So yes, it&#39;s valid.But maybe the problem expects positive integers. Let me see. If the problem says &quot;number&quot;, then 0 is allowed. If it says &quot;positive number&quot;, then not. Since it&#39;s not specified, I should include 0. But maybe in the context of the term &quot;superstitious number&quot;, referring to 13 being unlucky, maybe 0 isn&#39;t considered. But that&#39;s just the name. The definition is purely mathematical.Thus, based on the problem statement, I need to include 0.However, let me check online if similar problems include 0. For example, the well-known Harshad numbers include 0, but sometimes problems specify positive integers. Since the problem here doesn&#39;t specify, I should include 0.But to make sure, let&#39;s see: in the three-digit numbers, we have 117,156,195. Let&#39;s check if there are any other numbers. For example, maybe four-digit numbers with leading zeros? But numbers don&#39;t have leading zeros, so 013 would be 13, but 13 is a two-digit number which we already checked. 13&#39;s sum is 1+3=4, 13*4=52≠13. So no.Alternatively, perhaps considering N=0, but that&#39;s already accounted for.Therefore, the complete list is 0,117,156,195.But let me check once again for two-digit numbers. Maybe I made a miscalculation.Equation for two-digit numbers: 3a +12b=0. Since a ≥1, 3a ≥3, 12b ≥0. So sum ≥3. Therefore, impossible. So no two-digit numbers.One-digit numbers: N=0 and N=13*sum_digits(N). For N=0, sum is 0, so 0=13*0. For other single-digit numbers N=1 to 9, sum_digits(N)=N, so equation N=13*N ⇒ N=0. So only N=0.Three-digit numbers: as found, 117,156,195.So yes, the answer should include 0,117,156,195.But let me check if the problem might have a different set of answers. For example, sometimes there might be a number like 26: sum is 8, 13*8=104≠26. So no. 13: sum is 4, 13*4=52. Not 13. So no.Alternatively, maybe I missed a three-digit number. Let&#39;s check a=1, 29*1=29.So b +4c=29. Possible solutions when b is odd and 4c=29 -b.We found b=1:4c=28→c=7.b=5:4c=24→c=6.b=9:4c=20→c=5.Wait, but b can be from 0 to9, but since 29 -b must be divisible by 4 and non-negative. Wait, 29 -b must be divisible by 4. So 29 ≡1 mod4. Therefore, 29 -b ≡1 -b mod4. To have divisible by4, 1 -b ≡0 mod4 ⇒b≡1 mod4. So possible b=1,5,9 (since b is a digit). Which is exactly the ones we checked. So these are the only solutions.Thus, the three three-digit numbers are correct.Therefore, the complete list is 0,117,156,195.But let me check once again for four-digit numbers. Suppose someone tries a=0, but then it&#39;s not a four-digit number. So no.Therefore, the final answer is that the superstitious numbers are 0, 117, 156, and 195.However, looking back, maybe the problem expects only positive numbers. Let me check the original problem statement once again:&quot;We say that a number is superstitious when it is equal to 13 times the sum of its digits. Find all superstitious numbers.&quot;No restrictions, so 0 should be included. But sometimes, in certain contexts, 0 is excluded. Let me think if 0 is considered a &quot;superstitious number&quot; here. Since 13 is associated with bad luck, but 0 is kind of neutral. However, mathematically, it fits the definition.Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a source that expects only positive integers. For example, in some Olympiad problems, numbers are considered positive unless stated otherwise. But this is a conjecture. However, since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, I should include 0.But to confirm, let me calculate 0&#39;s validity again. Sum of digits of 0 is 0, 13*0=0. Yes, so 0 is a solution.Therefore, the answer is 0,117,156,195.But let me check online if there&#39;s a standard answer for this problem. Wait, I can&#39;t access the internet, but I recall that similar problems sometimes include 0 and sometimes not. For example, the Harshad number problem includes 0, but sometimes it&#39;s excluded depending on the source.Given that the problem statement does not specify positivity, the correct mathematical answer includes 0. Therefore, the superstitious numbers are 0,117,156,195.But let me check once more if there&#39;s another three-digit number that I missed. For example, a=1, b +4c=29. If b=1, c=7. If b=5, c=6. If b=9, c=5. Any other possibilities?Wait, if b=13, but b is a digit, so maximum 9. Similarly, c has to be a digit. So no.Thus, no other solutions.Therefore, the conclusion is the four numbers:0,117,156,195.But let me check if the problem might have a different answer. For example, perhaps the number 26. 2+6=8, 13*8=104≠26. Nope. Or 13:1+3=4, 13*4=52≠13. So no.Another check: 117:1+1+7=9, 13*9=117. Correct.156:1+5+6=12, 13*12=156. Correct.195:1+9+5=15, 13*15=195. Correct.0:0=13*0. Correct.Thus, all four numbers are valid.Therefore, the final answer is 0,117,156,195.But the problem might expect the numbers in a boxed format. Since multiple numbers, maybe separated by commas inside the box.But the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. Usually, for multiple answers, we can box them individually or list inside. Depending on the convention. For example, boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, boxed{195}. Or if multiple numbers in one box, perhaps boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, and boxed{195}.Alternatively, if ordered as a set: boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, boxed{195}. Probably separate boxes.But let me check with the problem statement example. For example, if the answer is a single number, it&#39;s boxed. For multiple numbers, maybe each in a box.But the original problem says &quot;Find all superstitious numbers.&quot; So likely, the answer is multiple boxed numbers.But let me see the user instruction: &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. So maybe all inside one box, separated by commas.For example: boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, boxed{195}But in some cases, they want multiple boxed answers. But the instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, implying one box. Hmm, but how to represent multiple numbers in one box.Perhaps inside the box: boxed{0, 117, 156, 195}Yes, that seems right. So comma-separated inside a single box.Therefore, the final answer is boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, boxed{195} or boxed{0, 117, 156, 195}. Depending on the convention.But since the user might expect all numbers in one box, as per &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, I will go with boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, boxed{195} if multiple boxes are allowed, but since it&#39;s one answer, probably within a single box: boxed{0, 117, 156, 195}Alternatively, check if the original problem expects only the three three-digit numbers, excluding zero. But according to the problem statement, 0 is valid.But to verify, let me check the sum for 0: sum is 0, 13*0=0. Correct. So yes, 0 is valid.Therefore, the answer is 0,117,156,195, all boxed in one.Final AnswerThe superstitious numbers are boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, and boxed{195}.&lt;/think&gt;To find all superstitious numbers, we need to identify numbers ( N ) such that ( N = 13 times ) (sum of its digits).1. Single-digit numbers:   - For ( N ) to be a single-digit number, ( N = 13 times N ) implies ( N = 0 ). Thus, 0 is a superstitious number.2. Two-digit numbers:   - Let ( N = 10a + b ). The equation becomes ( 10a + b = 13(a + b) ), leading to ( 3a + 12b = 0 ). Since ( a geq 1 ), there are no solutions.3. Three-digit numbers:   - Let ( N = 100a + 10b + c ). The equation becomes ( 100a + 10b + c = 13(a + b + c) ), simplifying to ( 29a = b + 4c ).   - For ( a = 1 ), solving ( 29 = b + 4c ) yields valid solutions:     - ( b = 1, c = 7 ) gives ( N = 117 )     - ( b = 5, c = 6 ) gives ( N = 156 )     - ( b = 9, c = 5 ) gives ( N = 195 )4. Four-digit and higher numbers:   - The left side of the equation (derived from the number&#39;s digits) is much larger than the right side (sum of digits multiplied by 13), making solutions impossible.Thus, the superstitious numbers are ( 0 ), ( 117 ), ( 156 ), and ( 195 ).[boxed{0}, boxed{117}, boxed{156}, boxed{195}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-f09ae572></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>🔑:</span>1. Define the problem: We need to find all numbers that are equal to 13 times the sum of their digits. We call such numbers *superstitious*.2. Consider two-digit numbers: Let the two-digit number be represented as (10a + b), where (a) and (b) are the digits.   [   10a + b = 13(a + b)   ]   Simplify the equation:   [   10a + b = 13a + 13b   ]   [   10a + b - 13a - 13b = 0   ]   [   -3a - 12b = 0   ]   [   a + 4b = 0   ]   Since (a) and (b) are digits (0-9), there are no non-negative integer solutions for (a) and (b) that satisfy this equation. Therefore, there are no two-digit superstitious numbers.3. Consider three-digit numbers: Let the three-digit number be represented as (100a + 10b + c), where (a), (b), and (c) are the digits.   [   100a + 10b + c = 13(a + b + c)   ]   Simplify the equation:   [   100a + 10b + c = 13a + 13b + 13c   ]   [   100a + 10b + c - 13a - 13b - 13c = 0   ]   [   87a - 3b - 12c = 0   ]   [   29a = b + 4c   ]   Since (a), (b), and (c) are digits (0-9), we need to find values that satisfy this equation. 4. Solve for (a = 1):    [   29 cdot 1 = b + 4c   ]   [   29 = b + 4c   ]   We need to find (b) and (c) such that this equation holds:   - If (c = 7), then (b = 29 - 4 cdot 7 = 29 - 28 = 1). This gives the number (100 cdot 1 + 10 cdot 1 + 7 = 117).   - If (c = 6), then (b = 29 - 4 cdot 6 = 29 - 24 = 5). This gives the number (100 cdot 1 + 10 cdot 5 + 6 = 156).   - If (c = 5), then (b = 29 - 4 cdot 5 = 29 - 20 = 9). This gives the number (100 cdot 1 + 10 cdot 9 + 5 = 195).5. Verify the solutions:    - For (117):     [     1 + 1 + 7 = 9 quad text{and} quad 13 cdot 9 = 117     ]   - For (156):     [     1 + 5 + 6 = 12 quad text{and} quad 13 cdot 12 = 156     ]   - For (195):     [     1 + 9 + 5 = 15 quad text{and} quad 13 cdot 15 = 195     ]Thus, the three-digit superstitious numbers are (117), (156), and (195).The final answer is (boxed{117, 156, 195}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-3f6a97c4 data-v-f09ae572><div class="review" data-v-f09ae572><div class="review-title" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>❓:</span>1.

I need to find all cubic polynomials of the form ( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ) that satisfy two remainder conditions when divided by two different quadratic binomials. The first condition is that when divided by ( 2x^2 + 1 ), the remainder is ( x + 2 ). The second condition is that when divided by ( x^2 + 2 ), the remainder is ( 2x + 1 ). Hmm. So, polynomial division. When you divide a polynomial by a divisor, you get a quotient and a remainder, and the remainder has a degree less than the divisor. Since both divisors here are quadratic (degree 2), the remainders are linear (degree 1) or constants (degree 0). In this case, both remainders given are linear: ( x + 2 ) and ( 2x + 1 ).So, for the&#39;s etc....                                                                         .But the known order statistics.If the mode of the (k-1)th order statistic.Wait, 2nd largest of k from 1..N. The mode of the (k-1)th order statistic is at floor( ( (k-1) / k )*(N +1) )?Wait, for example, if k=2, then the 2nd largest (i.e., the maximum) would be at floor( (k/(k+1))*(N +1) ), which would be floor( (2/3)*(N +1) ). Wait, but if k=2, N=10, then mode is floor( (2/3)*11 ) = floor(7.333) =7. But in reality, for N=10, k=2, the distribution of the maximum is triangular, peaking at N. Wait, no, for k=2, maximum is more likely at N. So maybe that formula isn&#39;t applicable.Alternatively, the formula for the mode of the (k-1)th order statistic is floor( ((k-1)/(k+1))*(N +1) ) or similar.But if the problem is expecting that formula, then maybe the answer is floor( ( (k-1)/k )*(N +1) ). But since the problem didn&#39;t specify N and k, maybe the answer is expressed in terms of N and k. But since the problem is expecting a boxed number, perhaps the answer is 42, but the user hasn&#39;t provided the necessary data.Wait, but the original problem is in Chinese, and the user hasn&#39;t translated the problem correctly. The user wrote &quot;the maximum number of combinations&quot; but maybe it&#39;s a different problem.Wait, the problem is asking for the number of combinations where the number of combinations is the largest, which would correspond to the value m that maximizes C(m-1, k-2)*(N - m). Which is the same as what we have.But if we need a general formula, then it&#39;s floor( ((k - 2)/(k))*( expressions but perhaps this is complicating but since we already verified with specific values, 6 and 4.335, we can be confident our expressions are correct.Therefore, the final answer is the perimeter ranges from just above 4 to 6, inclusive of 6. Thus, the interval is (4, 6].Final AnswerThe range of the perimeter is boxed{(4, 6]}.boxed{(4, 6]}&lt;/think&gt;Given a triangle (ABC) with (angle B = 60^circ) and side.But,,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all cubic polynomials of the form ( a x^{3} + b x^{2} + c x + d ). The conditions are that when divided by ( 2 x^{2} + 1 ), the remainder is ( x + 2 ), and when divided by ( x^{2} + 2 ), the remainder is ( 2 x + 1 ). Hmm, let me think how to approach this.First, I remember that when a polynomial ( P(x) ) is divided by another polynomial, say ( D(x) ), we can write it as ( P(x) = Q(x) cdot D(x) + R(x) ), where the degree of ( R(x) ) is less than the degree of ( D(x) ). In this case, both divisors are quadratic (degree 2), so the remainders should be linear (degree 1) or constants. But here, the remainders are given as linear polynomials: ( x + 2 ) and ( 2 x + 1 ).Given that the polynomial we&#39;re looking for is a cubic (degree 3), when divided by a quadratic (degree 2), the quotient will be linear (degree 1) and the remainder will be linear (degree 1) as specified. So, for the first division by ( 2x^2 + 1 ), we can write:( a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = (2x^2 + 1)(m x + n) + x + 2 )Similarly, for the division by ( x^2 + 2 ):( a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = (x^2 + 2)(p x + q) + 2x + 1 )Here, ( m, n, p, q ) are coefficients we need to determine, which in turn will give us the coefficients ( a, b, c, d ) of the original cubic polynomial.Since both expressions equal the same cubic polynomial, we can set them equal to each other:( (2x^2 + 1)(m x + n) + x + 2 = (x^2 + 2)(p x + q) + 2x + 1 )But maybe it&#39;s easier to expand both expressions and then equate coefficients. Let&#39;s try that.First, expanding the left-hand side (divided by ( 2x^2 +1 )):( (2x^2 + 1)(m x + n) + x + 2 )= ( 2x^2 cdot m x + 2x^2 cdot n + 1 cdot m x + 1 cdot n + x + 2 )= ( 2m x^3 + 2n x^2 + m x + n + x + 2 )Combine like terms:= ( 2m x^3 + 2n x^2 + (m + 1) x + (n + 2) )Similarly, expanding the right-hand side (divided by ( x^2 + 2 )):( (x^2 + 2)(p x + q) + 2x + 1 )= ( x^2 cdot p x + x^2 cdot q + 2 cdot p x + 2 cdot q + 2x + 1 )= ( p x^3 + q x^2 + 2p x + 2q + 2x + 1 )Combine like terms:= ( p x^3 + q x^2 + (2p + 2) x + (2q + 1) )Now, since both expanded forms equal the original cubic polynomial ( a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d ), their coefficients must be equal. Therefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of x.From the left-hand side:- Coefficient of ( x^3 ): ( 2m )- Coefficient of ( x^2 ): ( 2n )- Coefficient of ( x ): ( m + 1 )- Constant term: ( n + 2 )From the right-hand side:- Coefficient of ( x^3 ): ( p )- Coefficient of ( x^2 ): ( q )- Coefficient of ( x ): ( 2p + 2 )- Constant term: ( 2q + 1 )So, equating the coefficients:1. ( 2m = p ) (from ( x^3 ) terms)2. ( 2n = q ) (from ( x^2 ) terms)3. ( m + 1 = 2p + 2 ) (from ( x ) terms)4. ( n + 2 = 2q + 1 ) (from constant terms)Now, we have four equations with four variables: m, n, p, q.Let me substitute equations 1 and 2 into equations 3 and 4. From equation 1, ( p = 2m ). From equation 2, ( q = 2n ). So plug these into equations 3 and 4.Equation 3 becomes:( m + 1 = 2(2m) + 2 )Simplify:( m + 1 = 4m + 2 )Subtract m from both sides:1 = 3m + 2Subtract 2:-1 = 3mThus, m = -1/3Equation 4 becomes:( n + 2 = 2(2n) + 1 )Simplify:( n + 2 = 4n + 1 )Subtract n and 1 from both sides:1 = 3nThus, n = 1/3Now, with m = -1/3 and n = 1/3, we can find p and q using equations 1 and 2.p = 2m = 2*(-1/3) = -2/3q = 2n = 2*(1/3) = 2/3So, now we have all variables:m = -1/3, n = 1/3, p = -2/3, q = 2/3Now, we can substitute back into the original expressions to find the coefficients a, b, c, d.From the left-hand side expansion:Coefficient of ( x^3 ): 2m = 2*(-1/3) = -2/3Coefficient of ( x^2 ): 2n = 2*(1/3) = 2/3Coefficient of ( x ): m + 1 = (-1/3) + 1 = 2/3Constant term: n + 2 = (1/3) + 2 = 7/3Similarly, from the right-hand side expansion:Coefficient of ( x^3 ): p = -2/3Coefficient of ( x^2 ): q = 2/3Coefficient of ( x ): 2p + 2 = 2*(-2/3) + 2 = (-4/3) + 2 = 2/3Constant term: 2q + 1 = 2*(2/3) + 1 = 4/3 + 1 = 7/3So both sides give us the same coefficients, which is good. Therefore, the cubic polynomial is:( a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = -frac{2}{3}x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + frac{2}{3}x + frac{7}{3} )But the problem says &quot;Find all polynomials...&quot;, so perhaps we can write it in a simplified form or check if there&#39;s a general solution. However, given that the conditions lead to unique values for a, b, c, d, this should be the only solution.Wait a second, let me verify this. Let&#39;s check if this polynomial indeed satisfies both remainder conditions.First, dividing by ( 2x^2 + 1 ). Let&#39;s perform polynomial division.Polynomial: ( -frac{2}{3}x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + frac{2}{3}x + frac{7}{3} )Divide by ( 2x^2 + 1 ). The leading term is ( -frac{2}{3}x^3 ) divided by ( 2x^2 ), which is ( -frac{1}{3}x ). Multiply ( -frac{1}{3}x ) by ( 2x^2 + 1 ): ( -frac{2}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{3}x ). Subtract this from the original polynomial:( (-frac{2}{3}x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + frac{2}{3}x + frac{7}{3}) - (-frac{2}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{3}x) )= ( 0x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + (frac{2}{3}x + frac{1}{3}x) + frac{7}{3} )= ( frac{2}{3}x^2 + x + frac{7}{3} )Now, the remainder is ( frac{2}{3}x^2 + x + frac{7}{3} ). Wait, but the problem states that the remainder should be ( x + 2 ). But here, the remainder is quadratic. That can&#39;t be right. So, I must have made a mistake in my calculation.Wait, this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed. Wait, but how? Let me re-examine.Wait, when I set up the equation:( a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = (2x^2 + 1)(m x + n) + x + 2 )If I divide by ( 2x^2 + 1 ), the quotient is linear (mx + n) and the remainder is x + 2. But when I expand, I should have:( (2x^2 + 1)(mx + n) + (x + 2) )Which is equal to the cubic polynomial. But when I perform the division, the remainder is x + 2. So, when I subtract (2x^2 +1)(mx + n) from the cubic polynomial, I should get x + 2. Therefore, in polynomial division, the remainder&#39;s degree must be less than the divisor&#39;s degree, which is 2 here, so the remainder is linear (x + 2). So my initial setup is correct. Then why when I tried dividing the resulting polynomial by 2x^2 +1, I got a quadratic remainder? Because maybe I messed up the division.Wait, let&#39;s try the division again. Let me write the polynomial:( -frac{2}{3}x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + frac{2}{3}x + frac{7}{3} )Divide by ( 2x^2 + 1 ). Let&#39;s do the division step by step.First term: ( -frac{2}{3}x^3 ) divided by ( 2x^2 ) is ( -frac{1}{3}x ). Multiply the divisor by ( -frac{1}{3}x ):( -frac{1}{3}x cdot (2x^2 + 1) = -frac{2}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{3}x )Subtract this from the original polynomial:( (-frac{2}{3}x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + frac{2}{3}x + frac{7}{3}) - (-frac{2}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{3}x) )= ( 0x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + (frac{2}{3}x + frac{1}{3}x) + frac{7}{3} )= ( frac{2}{3}x^2 + x + frac{7}{3} )Now, the remainder is ( frac{2}{3}x^2 + x + frac{7}{3} ), which is a quadratic polynomial, but we were supposed to have a remainder of x + 2. That means something is wrong here. So, my previous conclusion that the coefficients lead to the remainder x + 2 is incorrect. Where did I go wrong?Wait, maybe in my initial setup. Let me check.The setup was:Polynomial = (2x² + 1)(mx + n) + (x + 2). When I expanded this, I got:2m x³ + 2n x² + (m + 1)x + (n + 2)But when we perform division, the remainder is x + 2, which is correct. So, if the polynomial is equal to that expression, then when divided by 2x² +1, the remainder is x + 2.But when I actually did the division, I got a different remainder. So, there must be an error in the division process.Wait, perhaps I didn&#39;t account for the fact that the polynomial coefficients are fractions. Let me check again.Let me write the polynomial:-2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² + 2/3 x + 7/3.Divide by 2x² +1.First term: (-2/3 x³) / (2x²) = (-1/3 x). Multiply divisor by -1/3 x:-1/3 x * 2x² = -2/3 x³-1/3 x * 1 = -1/3 xSo, subtract: (-2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² + 2/3 x + 7/3) - (-2/3 x³ -1/3 x) = 0x³ + 2/3 x² + (2/3 x + 1/3 x) + 7/3 = 2/3 x² + x + 7/3But according to the problem, the remainder should be x + 2. So, we have here 2/3x² + x + 7/3. But this is not equal to x + 2. Therefore, there&#39;s a contradiction here. That means my solution is wrong. Where did I go wrong?Wait, maybe the mistake is in the setup. Let&#39;s check.The equation is:Polynomial = (2x² +1)(mx + n) + x + 2.But when we expand this, we get 2m x³ + 2n x² + m x + n + x + 2. Combine terms:2m x³ + 2n x² + (m +1)x + (n + 2)Similarly, the other side: (x² +2)(p x + q) +2x +1 = p x³ + q x² + 2p x + 2q +2x +1 = p x³ + q x² + (2p + 2)x + (2q +1 )Equating coefficients, we have:2m = p,2n = q,m +1 = 2p + 2,n +2 = 2q +1.Then solving:From first equation, p = 2m.From second, q = 2n.Third equation: m +1 = 2*(2m) + 2 → m +1 = 4m +2 → -3m =1 → m= -1/3Fourth equation: n +2 = 2*(2n) +1 → n +2 =4n +1 → -3n = -1 → n=1/3Hence, p= -2/3, q= 2/3.Thus, the polynomial is:2m x³ + 2n x² + (m +1)x + (n + 2) = 2*(-1/3) x³ + 2*(1/3) x² + (-1/3 +1)x + (1/3 +2) = -2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² + 2/3 x + 7/3.But when we perform the division, we get a remainder of x + 2. But when we actually perform the division, the remainder is 2/3x² + x + 7/3, which is not x +2. Hence, there is an inconsistency here. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.Wait a second, perhaps the problem is not in the setup, but in my division process. Let me check again.Wait, when I divide polynomial P(x) by D(x), I should get P(x) = Q(x) D(x) + R(x). So, if P(x) is equal to (2x² +1)(mx +n) + x +2, then dividing P(x) by (2x² +1) gives quotient mx +n and remainder x +2. However, when I divided the resulting P(x) by (2x² +1), the remainder was not x +2. So, where is the mistake?Wait, the problem is that when I constructed P(x) as (2x² +1)(mx +n) + x +2, then indeed, the remainder is x +2. But when I expanded P(x), I get a cubic polynomial, which when divided by 2x² +1 should give quotient mx +n and remainder x +2But when I performed the division of P(x) by 2x² +1, the remainder should be x +2. But when I subtract (2x² +1)(mx +n) from P(x), the remainder should be x +2. However, in my calculation, the remainder was 2/3x² +x +7/3. So, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the expansion.Wait, let&#39;s compute P(x) = (2x² +1)(mx +n) +x +2.If m = -1/3, n=1/3:(2x² +1)(-1/3 x +1/3) +x +2.Let me expand this:First, expand (2x² +1)(-1/3 x +1/3):2x²*(-1/3 x) +2x²*(1/3) +1*(-1/3 x) +1*(1/3)= -2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² -1/3 x +1/3.Add x +2:-2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² -1/3 x +1/3 +x +2 = -2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² +2/3 x +7/3.Which is the same polynomial as before.But when we divide this polynomial by 2x² +1, the remainder is x +2.Wait, but when I divided -2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² +2/3 x +7/3 by 2x² +1, I got a remainder of 2/3x² +x +7/3.But according to the setup, the remainder should be x +2. Therefore, my division process is incorrect. Let me redo the division step-by-step.Dividend: -2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² + 2/3 x + 7/3Divisor: 2x² +1.First term: (-2/3 x³) divided by (2x²) = -1/3 x. Multiply divisor by -1/3 x: -1/3 x*(2x² +1) = -2/3 x³ -1/3 x.Subtract this from the dividend:(-2/3 x³ + 2/3 x² + 2/3 x +7/3) - (-2/3 x³ -1/3 x) =0x³ +2/3 x² + (2/3 x +1/3 x) +7/3 = 2/3 x² +x +7/3.Now, the remainder is 2/3 x² +x +7/3, which is of degree 2, but we expected a remainder of degree 1, x +2. Therefore, this indicates that something is wrong.Wait a second, the remainder must have degree less than the divisor&#39;s degree (which is 2). So, if the remainder after division is 2/3x² +x +7/3, which is degree 2, that&#39;s invalid. So, this indicates that the division process was incomplete.Wait, perhaps when dividing polynomials, we need to continue the division until the remainder&#39;s degree is less than the divisor&#39;s degree. But in this case, after the first step, the remainder is quadratic, same as the divisor. So, we need to continue dividing.But wait, the divisor is 2x² +1, degree 2. The remainder after first step is 2/3x² +x +7/3. So, the leading term is 2/3x². Divide this by the leading term of the divisor, which is 2x². 2/3x² divided by 2x² is 1/3. So, the next term in the quotient is 1/3. Multiply 1/3 by the divisor: 1/3*(2x² +1) = 2/3x² +1/3. Subtract this from the remainder:(2/3x² +x +7/3) - (2/3x² +1/3) = 0x² +x +6/3 =x +2.So, the total quotient is -1/3 x +1/3 and the remainder is x +2. Ah! So, I didn&#39;t complete the division earlier. The full quotient is (-1/3 x +1/3) +1/3, but no, let&#39;s see:Wait, first step: quotient term is -1/3x, remainder after first subtraction is 2/3x² +x +7/3.Then, next term: divide 2/3x² by 2x², get 1/3. Multiply divisor by 1/3: 2/3x² +1/3. Subtract from remainder: (2/3x² +x +7/3) - (2/3x² +1/3) =x +6/3= x +2. So, the total quotient is (-1/3x +1/3) and the remainder is x +2. So, the division process does work out. The quotient is (-1/3 x +1/3) with a remainder of x +2. So, the initial setup was correct.Therefore, the polynomial -2/3x³ +2/3x² +2/3x +7/3 does indeed, when divided by 2x² +1, give a quotient of -1/3x +1/3 and a remainder of x +2. Similarly, we need to check the other condition: when divided by x² +2, the remainder is 2x +1.Let me verify this.The polynomial is -2/3x³ +2/3x² +2/3x +7/3.Divide this by x² +2.First term: -2/3x³ divided by x² is -2/3x. Multiply divisor by -2/3x: -2/3x*(x² +2) = -2/3x³ -4/3x.Subtract this from the polynomial:(-2/3x³ +2/3x² +2/3x +7/3) - (-2/3x³ -4/3x) = 0x³ +2/3x² +6/3x +7/3 =2/3x² +2x +7/3.Now, the remainder is 2/3x² +2x +7/3. Since the remainder has degree 2, which is equal to the divisor&#39;s degree, we need to continue dividing.Divide 2/3x² by x²: 2/3. Multiply divisor by 2/3: 2/3x² +4/3. Subtract this from the remainder:(2/3x² +2x +7/3) - (2/3x² +4/3) =0x² +2x +3/3=2x +1.So, the quotient is (-2/3x +2/3) and the remainder is2x +1. Therefore, the polynomial when divided by x² +2 gives a remainder of2x +1, as required. Therefore, despite the initial confusion, the polynomial does satisfy both conditions. The division process required two steps, but the remainder does end up being as required. So, the answer is correct.Thus, the cubic polynomial satisfying the given conditions is:( -frac{2}{3}x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + frac{2}{3}x + frac{7}{3} )But the question says &quot;Find all polynomials...&quot;, so we can multiply numerator and denominator by 3 to eliminate fractions, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the form, so both forms are acceptable. However, since the problem mentions polynomials with coefficients a, b, c, d, which can be fractions, this is the polynomial. Since the solution is unique (as the system of equations had a unique solutionFinal AnswerThe polynomial is boxed{-dfrac{2}{3}x^3 + dfrac{2}{3}x^2 + dfrac{2}{3}x + dfrac{7}{3}}.But the last dfrac{2}{3}x is missing a backslash.

( 2m = p )2. ( 2n = q )3. ( m + 1 = 2p + 2 )4. ( n + 2 = 2q + 1 )Solving these equations step-by-step:- From equation 1: ( p = 2m )- From equation 2: ( q = 2n )- Substituting ( p = 2m ) into equation 3: ( m + 1 = 4m + 2 ) leads to ( m = -frac{1}{3} )- Substituting ( q = 2n ) into equation 4: ( n + 2 = 4n + 1 ) leads to ( n = frac{1}{3} )Substituting ( m ) and ( n ) back, we get ( p = -frac{2}{3} ) and ( q = frac{2}{3} ).Substituting these values back into the polynomial expressions, we get:[ P(x) = -frac{2}{3}x^3 + frac{2}{3}x^2 + frac{2}{3}x + frac{7}{3} ]Verification by polynomial division confirms the remainders are correct. Thus, the polynomial is:[boxed{-dfrac{2}{3}x^3 + dfrac{2}{3}x^2 + dfrac{2}{3}x + dfrac{7}{3}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-f09ae572></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>🔑:</span>SOLUTION.

Let me try to visualize the prism first. The base is triangle ABC with a right angle at C. AC is 6 units, BC is √2 units, and CC₁ is also √2 units. So, the prism is formed by extending the triangle upwards (or sideways, depending on the orientation) to form another triangle A₁B₁C₁ connected by the edges AA₁, BB₁, and CC₁, each of length √2. Since it&#39;s a right triangular prism, all the edges connecting the bases should be perpendicular to the base. So, the edges AA₁, BB₁, and CC₁ are all perpendicular to the base ABC. That means the sides of the prism (the rectangles) are all rectangles because the edges are perpendicular. Therefore, the sides AA₁C₁C, BB₁C₁C, and AA₁B₁B are all rectangles.Now, the point P is moving along the segment B₁C. Let me figure out where B₁ is. Since the prism is a right prism, B₁ is directly above B, connected by BB₁ of length √2. Similarly, C₁ is directly above C. So, the segment B₁C connects the point B₁ (which is above B) to point C. So, that segment is not on the base but is a diagonal edge from the top vertex B₁ to the base vertex C.The problem is to find the minimal value of AP + PC₁, where P is on B₁C. So, it&#39;s like a shortest path problem where we need to find the point P on the segment B₁C such that the sum of the distances from A to P and from P to C₁ is minimized. This reminds me of the reflection principle used in optics or shortest path problems where reflecting a point across a line or surface can help find the minimal path.In problems like this, especially in 3D geometry, reflecting points across surfaces can help turn the problem into a straight line distance. Since we have a prism, maybe reflecting point A or C₁ across the plane containing segment B₁C could help. Alternatively, unfolding the prism into a flat net might make it easier to visualize the path as a straight line.Let me try the unfolding approach. If I can unfold the prism such that the faces connected to B₁C lie on a plane, then the path AP + PC₁ would be a straight line on this unfolded net. Let&#39;s see which faces are connected to B₁C. The segment B₁C is part of the face BB₁C and the face BCC₁. Wait, actually, B₁ is connected to B and C is connected to C₁. Hmm, maybe unfolding the adjacent faces.Alternatively, since the prism is right, all the lateral edges are perpendicular. Let me try to sketch mentally the positions of the points. Let&#39;s assign coordinates to the prism to make it more concrete. Let&#39;s place point C at the origin (0, 0, 0). Since AC = 6 and angle ACB is 90°, then point A is at (6, 0, 0), and point B is at (0, √2, 0) because BC = √2. Then, since CC₁ is √2, point C₁ is at (0, 0, √2). Then, B₁ is directly above B, so B₁ is at (0, √2, √2). Similarly, A₁ is at (6, 0, √2).Now, the segment B₁C connects point B₁ (0, √2, √2) to point C (0, 0, 0). Let&#39;s parametrize point P on B₁C. Let me write the coordinates for any point P on B₁C. Since B₁C is a line segment from (0, √2, √2) to (0, 0, 0), the parametric equations can be written as:x = 0,y = √2(1 - t),z = √2(1 - t),where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t = 0, we are at B₁, and when t = 1, we are at C.So, coordinates of P are (0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)) for t ∈ [0,1].Now, we need to compute AP + PC₁. Let&#39;s find expressions for both distances.First, point A is at (6, 0, 0). Point P is at (0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)). The distance AP is:AP = sqrt[(6 - 0)^2 + (0 - √2(1 - t))^2 + (0 - √2(1 - t))^2]= sqrt[36 + 2(1 - t)^2 + 2(1 - t)^2]= sqrt[36 + 4(1 - t)^2]Similarly, point C₁ is at (0, 0, √2). So, the distance PC₁ is:PC₁ = sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - √2(1 - t))^2 + (√2 - √2(1 - t))^2]= sqrt[0 + 2(1 - t)^2 + (√2 t)^2]= sqrt[2(1 - t)^2 + 2t^2]= sqrt[2(1 - 2t + t^2) + 2t^2]= sqrt[2 - 4t + 2t^2 + 2t^2]= sqrt[2 - 4t + 4t^2]= sqrt[4t^2 - 4t + 2]So, the total distance is sqrt[36 + 4(1 - t)^2] + sqrt[4t^2 - 4t + 2]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it. Let&#39;s compute both terms:First term: sqrt[36 + 4(1 - t)^2] = sqrt{4[(1 - t)^2 + 9]} = 2*sqrt{(1 - t)^2 + 9}Second term: sqrt[4t^2 - 4t + 2] = sqrt{4t^2 -4t + 2} = Let&#39;s see if we can factor or complete the square:4t² -4t + 2 = 4t² -4t +1 +1 = (2t -1)^2 +1. So sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1}So, the total distance becomes 2*sqrt{(1 - t)^2 + 9} + sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1}Hmm, this still seems complicated. Maybe calculus is needed here. To find the minimum of this function with respect to t between 0 and 1, take derivative and set to zero. Let me denote f(t) = 2*sqrt{(1 - t)^2 + 9} + sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1}Compute f&#39;(t):First term derivative: 2*(1/(2*sqrt{(1 - t)^2 +9}))*(-2(1 - t)) = -2(1 - t)/sqrt{(1 - t)^2 +9}Second term derivative: (1/(2*sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1}))*(2*(2t -1)*2) = (2*(2t -1))/sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1}Therefore, f&#39;(t) = [-2(1 - t)/sqrt{(1 - t)^2 +9}] + [2*(2t -1)/sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1}]Set f&#39;(t) = 0:-2(1 - t)/sqrt{(1 - t)^2 +9} + 2*(2t -1)/sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1} = 0Divide both sides by 2:- (1 - t)/sqrt{(1 - t)^2 +9} + (2t -1)/sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1} = 0Bring one term to the other side:(2t -1)/sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1} = (1 - t)/sqrt{(1 - t)^2 +9}Let me denote u = 1 - t and v = 2t -1. Then, v = 2t -1 = 2(1 - u) -1 = 2 - 2u -1 = 1 - 2u. So, v = 1 - 2u.So the equation becomes:v / sqrt{v² +1} = u / sqrt{u² +9}Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:(v²)/(v² +1) = (u²)/(u² +9)Cross-multiplying:v²(u² +9) = u²(v² +1)v²u² +9v² = u²v² +u²Subtract v²u² from both sides:9v² = u²Therefore, 9v² = u²But v = 1 - 2u (from earlier substitution), so substitute:9(1 - 2u)^2 = u²Expand the left side:9(1 -4u +4u²) = u²9 -36u +36u² = u²Bring all terms to left:9 -36u +36u² -u² =0Simplify:35u² -36u +9 =0Solve quadratic equation for u:u = [36 ± sqrt(36² -4*35*9)] / (2*35)Compute discriminant:36² = 12964*35*9=1260So sqrt(1296 -1260) = sqrt(36)=6Thus,u = [36 ±6]/70So,u = (36 +6)/70 =42/70=6/10=3/5=0.6Or,u=(36-6)/70=30/70=3/7≈0.4286But u =1 - t, so t =1 -u.But let&#39;s check if these solutions satisfy the original equation, since we squared both sides which can introduce extraneous solutions.First, consider u=3/5:Then u=3/5, so t=1 -3/5=2/5≈0.4Then v=1 -2u=1 -6/5= -1/5So check original equation:Left side: v/sqrt{v² +1}= (-1/5)/sqrt{(1/25)+1}= (-1/5)/sqrt{26/25}= (-1/5)/(√26/5)= -1/√26≈-0.196Right side: u/sqrt{u² +9}= (3/5)/sqrt{(9/25)+9}= (3/5)/sqrt{(9/25 +225/25)}= (3/5)/sqrt{234/25}= (3/5)/(√234/5)= 3/√234≈3/(15.297)≈0.196Since left side is negative and right side is positive, they can&#39;t be equal. Therefore, this solution is extraneous.Now check u=3/7≈0.4286:Then u=3/7, t=1 -3/7=4/7≈0.5714v=1 -2u=1 -6/7=1/7≈0.1429Left side: v/sqrt{v² +1}= (1/7)/sqrt{(1/49)+1}= (1/7)/sqrt{50/49}= (1/7)/(√50/7)=1/√50≈0.1414Right side: u/sqrt{u² +9}= (3/7)/sqrt{(9/49)+9}= (3/7)/sqrt{(9/49 +441/49)}= (3/7)/sqrt{450/49}= (3/7)/(√450/7)=3/√450≈3/(21.213)≈0.1414So both sides are positive and approximately equal. Therefore, this is a valid solution.Therefore, the critical point is at u=3/7, so t=4/7. So the minimal value occurs at t=4/7. Let&#39;s compute the minimal value of AP + PC₁.First, compute AP:AP = 2*sqrt{(1 - t)^2 +9} =2*sqrt{(3/7)^2 +9}=2*sqrt{9 +9/49}=2*sqrt{(441 +9)/49}=2*sqrt{450/49}=2*(√450)/7=2*(15√2)/7=30√2/7Then compute PC₁:PC₁= sqrt{(2t -1)^2 +1}=sqrt{(8/7 -1)^2 +1}=sqrt{(1/7)^2 +1}=sqrt{1/49 +1}=sqrt{50/49}=√50/7=5√2/7Therefore, total distance is 30√2/7 +5√2/7=35√2/7=5√2≈7.071Wait, that seems too low because AC is 6, and the other edges are √2. Let me verify.Wait, hold on. Let me recalculate AP and PC₁ with t=4/7.Coordinates of P:x=0,y=√2(1 - t)=√2*(1 -4/7)=√2*(3/7)z=√2*(1 - t)=√2*(3/7)So point P is (0, 3√2/7, 3√2/7)Distance from A (6,0,0) to P:AP = sqrt[(6 -0)^2 + (0 -3√2/7)^2 + (0 -3√2/7)^2]= sqrt[36 + (9*2)/49 + (9*2)/49]= sqrt[36 + 18/49 + 18/49]= sqrt[36 + 36/49]= sqrt[(36*49 +36)/49]= sqrt[(36*(49 +1))/49]= sqrt[(36*50)/49]= (6√50)/7= (6*5√2)/7= 30√2/7Similarly, distance from P to C₁ (0,0,√2):PC₁ = sqrt[(0 -0)^2 + (0 -3√2/7)^2 + (√2 -3√2/7)^2]= sqrt[0 + (9*2)/49 + (4√2/7)^2]= sqrt[18/49 + (16*2)/49]= sqrt[18/49 +32/49]= sqrt[50/49]= √50/7= 5√2/7So total is 30√2/7 +5√2/7=35√2/7=5√2≈7.071But wait, 5√2 is approximately 7.071. But the problem is in a prism where AC is 6, which is longer. Is there a shorter path possible? Let me check.Alternatively, maybe the reflection approach is better here. If I reflect point C₁ over the line B₁C, then the minimal path from A to the reflection would cross B₁C at point P, giving AP + PC₁ as the minimal distance. But reflecting in 3D is a bit tricky.Alternatively, think of unfolding the prism. Since the prism has rectangular faces, maybe unfolding the faces into a plane.Let me consider the faces that contain the path AP + PC₁. The path goes from A on the base to P on B₁C, then to C₁. So, to unfold the prism such that the faces containing A, P, and C₁ are laid out flat.The point A is on the base face ABC. The segment B₁C is on the face BB₁C and BCC₁. If we unfold the prism such that the face BB₁C is unfolded onto the same plane as ABC, or maybe another configuration.Alternatively, think of the prism as having three rectangular faces: the base ABC, the top A₁B₁C₁, and the three rectangular sides. If we unfold the prism by folding the side faces into the plane of the base.But perhaps another approach: since the path goes from A to P on B₁C to C₁, perhaps we can consider the two adjacent faces: the face containing A and B₁C, but B₁C is on the vertical edge.Wait, perhaps parametrize the coordinates as I did before and use calculus as the way to go. Since with t=4/7, the minimal value is 5√2. But let me verify if this answer makes sense.Wait, 5√2 is approximately 7.07, while the straight line from A to C₁ is sqrt[6² + (√2)^2] = sqrt[36 +2] = sqrt[38] ≈6.16, which is shorter. But AP + PC₁ cannot be shorter than the straight line distance between A and C₁, unless the path is forced to go through B₁C. Wait, but in this problem, P must lie on B₁C, so the path is constrained to go through that segment. Therefore, the minimal path is longer than the straight line distance from A to C₁.Wait, but 5√2 ≈7.07 is longer than sqrt(38)≈6.16, so that&#39;s okay. But is there a way to get a shorter path?Wait, maybe the reflection method can help here. Let&#39;s consider reflecting point C₁ across the line B₁C to get a point C₁&#39;, then the minimal path from A to C₁&#39; passing through B₁C would correspond to AP + PC₁. But since this is a 3D reflection, it&#39;s a bit more complex.Alternatively, we can reflect the prism in some way. Let me think. Since the segment B₁C is a line in 3D space, reflecting across it might not be straightforward. Alternatively, we can parametrize the problem as done before and see that the minimal value is indeed 5√2. Wait, but according to the calculation, the minimal total distance is 5√2, which is approximately 7.07. Let me check with t=0 and t=1 to see the values.At t=0 (point P=B₁):AP = distance from A to B₁. Since B₁ is at (0, √2, √2). So:AP = sqrt[(6)^2 + (√2)^2 + (√2)^2] = sqrt[36 +2 +2] = sqrt[40] = 2√10 ≈6.324PC₁ = distance from B₁ to C₁: sqrt[(0 -0)^2 + (0 -√2)^2 + (√2 -√2)^2] = sqrt[0 +2 +0] = sqrt[2] ≈1.414Total: 2√10 +√2 ≈6.324 +1.414≈7.738At t=1 (point P=C):AP = distance from A to C: AC is given as 6.PC₁ = distance from C to C₁: CC₁ is given as √2.Total: 6 +√2≈6 +1.414≈7.414At the critical point t=4/7≈0.571, total distance is 5√2≈7.071, which is less than both t=0 and t=1. So that seems correct. Therefore, 5√2 is the minimal value.But the problem is presented as a competition problem, so 5√2 might be the answer, but let me check again.Wait, 5√2 is approximately 7.071, but let&#39;s compute the exact value using the coordinates.Wait, when we parametrized, we found that the minimal total distance is 5√2. But let me cross-verify with another approach.Suppose we use the reflection principle. In 3D, reflecting point C₁ across the line B₁C and then the minimal path from A to the reflection would cross B₁C at P. However, reflecting over a line in 3D is more complex, but since B₁C is a line in 3D space, we need to find the reflection of A or C₁ over B₁C.Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the net of the prism. If we can unfold the faces such that the path AP + PC₁ becomes a straight line.Consider the following: The point A is on the base ABC, and C₁ is on the top face A₁B₁C₁. The segment B₁C is connecting the top vertex B₁ to the base vertex C. If we unfold the prism such that the face BB₁C is adjacent to the base ABC. Wait, if we unfold the side face BB₁C onto the base ABC, then B₁ would be unfolded into the plane of ABC. But since BB₁ is perpendicular to ABC, unfolding it would place B₁ next to B in the plane. However, it&#39;s not straightforward.Alternatively, consider the lateral face BCC₁B₁. If we unfold this face into the plane of the base ABC, then point B₁ would be adjacent to C in the plane. Wait, maybe if we unfold the face BCC₁B₁ (which is a rectangle since BC=√2 and CC₁=√2) into the plane of ABC. Then, unfolding it would place point C₁ at a position adjacent to C. But actually, when you unfold a rectangular face, the adjacent faces become coplanar.Alternatively, think of unfolding the prism along the edge BC. So, the base ABC and the face BCC₁B₁ can be unfolded into a plane. So, in this unfolded net, point A is in the original base, and point C₁ is in the unfolded face.Wait, if I unfold the prism such that the face BCC₁B₁ is laid out next to the base ABC. Then, the combined figure would have ABC connected to BCC₁B₁. In this case, point A is at (6,0,0) in the original coordinate system, and point C₁ would be at (0,0,√2). But when unfolded, the coordinates might shift.Alternatively, in the unfolded net, the rectangle BCC₁B₁ can be considered as attached to BC. So, in the net, triangle ABC is connected to rectangle BCC₁B₁, which is a square since BC=CC₁=√2.In this unfolded net, point C₁ is now in the same plane as ABC. The coordinates of C₁ in the net would be (0, √2, 0) if we unfold it along BC. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to assign coordinates in the unfolded net.Original coordinates:- C: (0,0,0)- B: (0, √2, 0)- C₁: (0,0,√2)But if we unfold the face BCC₁B₁ (which is a rectangle) into the plane of ABC, then point C₁ would be at (0, √2, √2), but that&#39;s not correct.Wait, perhaps another approach. If we unfold the prism along the edge B₁C, then the two adjacent faces would be laid out into a plane. However, B₁C is a diagonal edge, so unfolding might not be straightforward.Alternatively, parametrize the problem in 3D space. Since we have coordinates, maybe consider the minimal path as a straight line from A to C₁ reflected via point P on B₁C. In 3D, the reflection principle can sometimes be applied by reflecting one of the points across the line and then finding the straight line distance.But reflecting across a line in 3D is more complex. The formula for reflection over a line involves some vector calculations.Alternatively, consider that the minimal path from A to C₁ via a point P on B₁C corresponds to the shortest path that touches the line B₁C. In 3D geometry, the shortest path between two points via a line is found by reflecting one point across the line and then finding the distance between the reflected point and the other point. Wait, maybe.Let me recall: In 3D, the shortest path from A to C₁ via a point P on line L can be found by reflecting one of the points (say C₁) across line L to get C₁&#39;, then the minimal path is the distance from A to C₁&#39;. But I&#39;m not sure if this works in 3D as it does in 2D.Alternatively, in 2D, reflecting across the line gives the shortest path, but in 3D, reflecting across a line is not a reflection but a rotation or something else. Hmm.Alternatively, parametrize the line B₁C and use calculus as done before. Since with calculus we found t=4/7 gives minimal value 5√2, and checking endpoints gives higher values, maybe 5√2 is indeed the minimal value.But let me check once again. When we derived 5√2, it was through calculus and found that the critical point gives a lower value than the endpoints, so it&#39;s a valid minimum. Therefore, the minimal value of AP + PC₁ is 5√2, which would be boxed as boxed{5sqrt{2}}.However, let me recall that sometimes in these problems, especially with right prisms, the minimal path can be found by unfolding into a plane where the path becomes a straight line, resulting in a different answer. Let me try once more to see if unfolding gives the same answer.Imagine unfolding the prism such that the face containing A and the face containing C₁ are laid out in the same plane. But since the prism is right, the faces adjacent to the base are all rectangles. For instance, if we unfold the prism along the edge AC, bringing the face ACC₁A₁ into the plane of ABC. Then, point C₁ would be in the same plane as ABC, displaced by CC₁=√2 perpendicular to AC.But in this case, the path AP + PC₁ would cross through the edge B₁C, which is not on the unfolded faces. Alternatively, if we unfold the faces ABB₁A₁ and BB₁C into the same plane.Alternatively, since P is on B₁C, which is part of the face BB₁C. If we unfold the face BB₁C and the face ABC into the same plane, then points A and C₁ would be in different planes. Let me attempt this.The face ABC is a right triangle with AC=6, BC=√2. The face BB₁C is a rectangle with sides BB₁=√2 and BC=√2, making it a square. If we unfold the square BB₁C onto the triangle ABC, then point B₁ would be adjacent to point B in the plane. But how would this affect the positions of A and C₁?Alternatively, imagine that after unfolding, the square BB₁C is laid out next to triangle ABC. So, point B is connected to both C and B₁. If we lay BB₁C flat next to ABC, then point B₁ is now in the plane of ABC extended. Then, point A is at (6,0,0), point C is at (0,0,0), point B is at (0,√2,0), and point B₁ is at (0,√2,√2) if we keep the original coordinates. But when unfolded, perhaps B₁ is at (0, √2 + √2, 0) = (0, 2√2, 0)?Wait, maybe not. When unfolding a square face BB₁C, which is vertical, into the horizontal plane ABC. If BB₁ is vertical, then unfolding it would place B₁ next to B in the horizontal direction. So, if BB₁ is vertical (along the z-axis), unfolding would rotate it 90 degrees into the plane. However, this is getting complicated without a diagram.Alternatively, consider that in the unfolded net, the distance AP + PC₁ becomes the straight line from A to the reflected C₁. But I might be overcomplicating.Given that the calculus approach gives 5√2 and checks out with the coordinates, and the reflection principle in 3D is more complex, perhaps 5√2 is indeed the correct answer. However, I recall that in similar problems, especially with right prisms, the minimal path can sometimes be computed by considering a combination of edges and using the Pythagorean theorem with the total &quot;unfolded&quot; length.Wait, let me think differently. If I can find a path from A to P to C₁ where P is on B₁C, and if I can represent this path on an unfolded net, then the minimal distance would be the straight line on the net.To do this, I need to determine which faces to unfold so that A and C₁ are on the same plane, with the segment B₁C also lying on that plane. Let me try unfolding the prism such that the base ABC and the rectangle BB₁C are in the same plane. Since ABC and BB₁C share the edge BC, unfolding along BC would place the rectangle BB₁C adjacent to triangle ABC. In this unfolded net, point B₁ is now in the same plane as ABC, connected to B via BC.In this unfolded net, the coordinates would be:- Point A remains at (6,0,0)- Point B is at (0,√2,0)- Point C is at (0,0,0)- Point B₁, when unfolded, is at (0, √2, √2) but in the plane, it would be at (0, √2 + √2, 0) = (0, 2√2, 0) if unfolded along BC.Wait, maybe not. Unfolding the rectangle BB₁C (which is a square) along BC would rotate it 180 degrees around BC, so point B₁ would be mirrored over BC. However, since BB₁ is perpendicular to BC, unfolding it into the plane would place B₁ at a point perpendicular to BC from B. But in the plane, after unfolding, the direction of BB₁ would be along a new axis.Alternatively, when you unfold the face BB₁C onto the plane ABC, the coordinates become:- Point B remains at (0, √2, 0)- Point C remains at (0,0,0)- Point B₁ is now at (0, √2, √2) but unfolded into the plane ABC would be at (√2, √2, 0), assuming we unfold along the y-axis.But I think this approach is getting too vague without a clear method. Given that the calculus method gives 5√2 and the check at endpoints confirms that it&#39;s lower, I think this is the right answer. Moreover, 5√2 is a clean answer, which is likely the expected result.Therefore, the minimal value of AP + PC₁ is 5√2, so the answer is boxed{5sqrt{2}}.Final Answerboxed{5sqrt{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To find the minimum value of ( AP + PC_1 ) where ( P ) is a moving point on the line segment ( B_1C ) in the right triangular prism ( ABC-A_1B_1C_1 ):1. Assign Coordinates:   - Place ( C ) at the origin ((0, 0, 0)).   - ( A ) is at ((6, 0, 0)), ( B ) is at ((0, sqrt{2}, 0)), and ( C_1 ) is at ((0, 0, sqrt{2})).   - ( B_1 ) is directly above ( B ) at ((0, sqrt{2}, sqrt{2})).2. Parametrize Point ( P ):   - The coordinates of ( P ) on ( B_1C ) are ((0, sqrt{2}(1 - t), sqrt{2}(1 - t))) for ( t in [0, 1] ).3. Calculate Distances:   - Distance ( AP ):     [     AP = sqrt{(6 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt{2}(1 - t))^2 + (0 - sqrt{2}(1 - t))^2} = sqrt{36 + 4(1 - t)^2}     ]   - Distance ( PC_1 ):     [     PC_1 = sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt{2}(1 - t))^2 + (sqrt{2} - sqrt{2}(1 - t))^2} = sqrt{4t^2 - 4t + 2}     ]4. Minimize the Total Distance:   - The total distance ( AP + PC_1 ) is given by:     [     f(t) = sqrt{36 + 4(1 - t)^2} + sqrt{4t^2 - 4t + 2}     ]   - Using calculus, we find the critical point by solving the derivative ( f&#39;(t) = 0 ). This results in ( t = frac{4}{7} ).5. Verify the Minimum Value:   - Substituting ( t = frac{4}{7} ) into the expressions for ( AP ) and ( PC_1 ):     [     AP = 2 sqrt{(1 - frac{4}{7})^2 + 9} = frac{30sqrt{2}}{7}     ]     [     PC_1 = sqrt{(2 cdot frac{4}{7} - 1)^2 + 1} = frac{5sqrt{2}}{7}     ]   - Total distance:     [     AP + PC_1 = frac{30sqrt{2}}{7} + frac{5sqrt{2}}{7} = 5sqrt{2}     ]Thus, the minimum value of ( AP + PC_1 ) is (boxed{5sqrt{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a right triangular prism, ABC-A₁B₁C₁. The problem says that angle ACB is 90 degrees, AC is 6 units long, BC and CC₁ are both √2 units. Then there&#39;s a point P moving along the segment B₁C, and I need to find the minimum value of AP + PC₁. Hmm, okay.First, let me try to visualize the prism. Since it&#39;s a right triangular prism, the bases are congruent right triangles, and the sides are rectangles. The right triangle is at ACB, with the right angle at C. So AC is one leg, BC is the other leg, and AB would be the hypotenuse. But given that AC is 6 and BC is √2, the hypotenuse AB would be sqrt(6² + (√2)²) which is sqrt(36 + 2) = sqrt(38). Wait, maybe that&#39;s not necessary right now.The prism extends from ABC to A₁B₁C₁, so the edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are all the height of the prism. The problem mentions CC₁ is √2, so that&#39;s the height. Therefore, the edges AA₁ and BB₁ are also √2. Wait, but BC is given as √2, and CC₁ is also √2. So BC and CC₁ are both √2. That might be important.Now, P is a moving point on B₁C. So B₁C is a line segment connecting B₁ to C. Let me think: since it&#39;s a prism, B₁ is the top vertex corresponding to B. So B is connected to B₁ via the edge BB₁ of length √2. Similarly, C is connected to C₁ via CC₁, also length √2. So the segment B₁C connects B₁ to C. So in the prism, B₁ is directly above B, and C is the original corner. So the segment B₁C is a diagonal from the top face to the bottom face.The problem is asking for the minimum value of AP + PC₁, where A is one of the original vertices, and P moves along B₁C. So AP is the distance from A to P, and PC₁ is the distance from P to C₁. We need to find the point P on B₁C that minimizes the sum of these two distances.This sounds like a classic optimization problem where we need to find the shortest path that goes from A to C₁ via a point P on the segment B₁C. In such cases, reflecting points to &quot;unfold&quot; the prism into a plane might help, allowing us to turn the problem into finding a straight line distance.Let me recall: the idea is that the shortest path on a surface can sometimes be found by reflecting the end point across the surface, then connecting the original start point to the reflection with a straight line. The intersection of this line with the surface gives the optimal point P.But since this is a 3D problem, maybe we can unfold the prism into a 2D net and then apply the reflection method. Let&#39;s try to think about how the prism can be unfolded.The prism has three rectangular faces: the base ABC, the top face A₁B₁C₁, and three rectangular sides. The sides are AA₁B₁B, BB₁C₁C, and CC₁A₁A. Wait, no. Actually, in a triangular prism, the lateral faces are parallelograms. But since it&#39;s a right prism, the lateral faces are rectangles.So, the lateral faces are rectangles: AA₁B₁B, BB₁C₁C, and CC₁A₁A. Each of these is a rectangle because the edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are perpendicular to the base ABC.So, if I want to unfold the prism, I can lay out the lateral faces adjacent to each other. For example, if we unfold the prism along the edges AA₁, BB₁, and CC₁, we can get a flat net. Let me try to visualize that.If we unfold the prism such that the face AA₁B₁B is adjacent to the face BB₁C₁C, which is adjacent to CC₁A₁A, then the net would consist of the two triangular bases connected by three rectangles in sequence. Alternatively, we can unfold different faces depending on which edges we cut.But perhaps another approach is better. Since P is on B₁C, which is a diagonal edge from the top face to the bottom face. Let me try to parameterize the position of P.Let&#39;s assign coordinates to the prism to make things clearer. Let&#39;s place point C at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since angle ACB is 90°, AC is along the x-axis and BC is along the y-axis. So, point A is at (6,0,0), point B is at (0,√2,0), and point C is at (0,0,0). Then, the top face points would be A₁(6,0,√2), B₁(0,√2,√2), and C₁(0,0,√2).Wait, hold on. The problem states that CC₁ is √2. So, moving from C up to C₁ is along the z-axis by √2. Therefore, coordinates:- C: (0, 0, 0)- A: (6, 0, 0) (since AC = 6)- B: (0, √2, 0) (since BC = √2)- C₁: (0, 0, √2)- B₁: (0, √2, √2) (since BB₁ is √2, moving up along z-axis)- A₁: (6, 0, √2)So the segment B₁C connects B₁(0, √2, √2) to C(0,0,0). Let&#39;s parametrize P along this segment. Let&#39;s use a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, P is at C, and when t=1, P is at B₁.So the coordinates of P can be written as:P = B₁ + t*(C - B₁) = (0, √2, √2) + t*(0 - 0, 0 - √2, 0 - √2) = (0, √2 - t√2, √2 - t√2)Therefore, P is (0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)).Now, we need to compute AP + PC₁. Let&#39;s write expressions for both distances.First, point A is at (6, 0, 0), and point C₁ is at (0, 0, √2). Let&#39;s compute the coordinates of P as (0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)).Compute AP:AP is the distance between A(6, 0, 0) and P(0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)).So AP = sqrt[(6 - 0)^2 + (0 - √2(1 - t))^2 + (0 - √2(1 - t))^2]Simplify:AP = sqrt[36 + 2(1 - t)^2 + 2(1 - t)^2] = sqrt[36 + 4(1 - t)^2]Similarly, compute PC₁:PC₁ is the distance between P(0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)) and C₁(0, 0, √2)So PC₁ = sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - √2(1 - t))^2 + (√2 - √2(1 - t))^2]Simplify:First, compute the z-coordinate difference:√2 - √2(1 - t) = √2 * tSo PC₁ = sqrt[0 + 2(1 - t)^2 + 2t^2] = sqrt[2(1 - t)^2 + 2t^2] = sqrt[2{(1 - t)^2 + t^2}]Let&#39;s expand (1 - t)^2 + t^2:= 1 - 2t + t² + t² = 1 - 2t + 2t²Thus, PC₁ = sqrt[2(1 - 2t + 2t²)]Therefore, the total distance AP + PC₁ is:sqrt[36 + 4(1 - t)^2] + sqrt[2(1 - 2t + 2t²)]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to approach this problem instead of parameterizing and taking derivatives. Let me think.Since we&#39;re dealing with a 3D geometry problem, perhaps unfolding the prism into a plane and using reflection can help. Let&#39;s consider that.To use reflection, we can think of reflecting either point A or C₁ across the line segment B₁C so that the path AP + PC₁ becomes a straight line in the reflected space. However, since B₁C is a line segment in 3D space, reflecting across it isn&#39;t straightforward.Alternatively, we can unfold the prism into a 2D net. For instance, if we unfold the faces around B₁C, but it&#39;s a bit unclear. Let&#39;s try to see which faces are adjacent to B₁C.The segment B₁C goes from B₁(0, √2, √2) to C(0, 0, 0). This segment passes through the vertical edge CC₁ at C, and through the top face at B₁. Wait, actually, in 3D space, the segment B₁C is a diagonal of the rectangular face BB₁C₁C. Wait, no. BB₁C₁C is a rectangle with sides BB₁ and BC. But B₁C is a diagonal of this rectangle.So, if we unfold the rectangular face BB₁C₁C into a plane, then B₁C becomes a straight line in that plane. However, point A is not on this face. Hmm.Alternatively, if we can find a net that includes both A and the segment B₁C, then we can reflect points appropriately.Alternatively, think of the problem as finding the shortest path from A to C₁ that goes through a point P on B₁C. In 3D space, the shortest path would be a straight line from A to C₁, but constrained to pass through B₁C. However, the straight line from A to C₁ might not intersect B₁C, so the minimal path would be the reflection approach.Wait, another method: in 3D, the minimal path from A to C₁ via a point P on B₁C is equivalent to finding the shortest path from A to C₁ with the constraint that it touches the line segment B₁C. This can be approached by using the method of reflection in 3D, but it&#39;s more complicated than in 2D.Alternatively, we can parameterize the position of P on B₁C as I did before, express AP + PC₁ as a function of t, and then find its minimum by taking the derivative with respect to t and setting it to zero. Let&#39;s try that.So, AP + PC₁ is sqrt[36 + 4(1 - t)^2] + sqrt[2(1 - 2t + 2t²)]. Let&#39;s denote this as f(t) = sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2) + sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²)).To find the minimum, take derivative f’(t), set to zero.First, compute f’(t):f’(t) = [d/dt sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2)] + [d/dt sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²))]Compute first term:d/dt sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2) = [1/(2*sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2))] * d/dt [36 + 4(1 - t)^2]= [1/(2*sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2))] * [8(1 - t)(-1)] = [-4(1 - t)] / sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2)Second term:d/dt sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²)) = [1/(2*sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²)))] * d/dt [2(1 - 2t + 2t²)]= [1/(2*sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²)))] * [2*(-2 + 4t)] = [(-2 + 4t)] / [2*sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²))]Simplify second term:= [2(2t - 1)] / [2*sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²))] = (2t - 1) / sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²))Therefore, total derivative:f’(t) = [-4(1 - t)/sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2)] + [(2t - 1)/sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²))] = 0So set:-4(1 - t)/sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2) + (2t - 1)/sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²)) = 0Bring second term to the other side:-4(1 - t)/sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2) = - (2t - 1)/sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²))Multiply both sides by -1:4(1 - t)/sqrt(36 + 4(1 - t)^2) = (2t - 1)/sqrt(2(1 - 2t + 2t²))Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But before that, note that squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so we need to check later.Left side squared: [16(1 - t)^2] / [36 + 4(1 - t)^2]Right side squared: [(2t - 1)^2] / [2(1 - 2t + 2t²)]Set equal:[16(1 - t)^2] / [36 + 4(1 - t)^2] = [(2t - 1)^2] / [2(1 - 2t + 2t²)]Cross-multiplying:16(1 - t)^2 * 2(1 - 2t + 2t²) = (2t - 1)^2 * [36 + 4(1 - t)^2]Simplify left side:32(1 - t)^2 (1 - 2t + 2t²)Right side:(4t² -4t +1)(36 +4(1 - 2t + t²))First, compute 4(1 - 2t + t²) = 4 -8t +4t². So 36 +4(1 - 2t + t²) = 36 +4 -8t +4t²=40 -8t +4t²=4(t² -2t +10)Wait, 40 -8t +4t² is 4t² -8t +40. Hmm.So right side:(4t² -4t +1)(4t² -8t +40)Let me compute that:Multiply term by term:First, 4t²*(4t²) =16t⁴4t²*(-8t)= -32t³4t²*40=160t²-4t*(4t²)= -16t³-4t*(-8t)=32t²-4t*40=-160t1*(4t²)=4t²1*(-8t)=-8t1*40=40Combine like terms:16t⁴-32t³ -16t³ = -48t³160t² +32t² +4t²=196t²-160t -8t= -168t+40So right side is 16t⁴ -48t³ +196t² -168t +40Left side: 32(1 - t)^2 (1 - 2t + 2t²). Let&#39;s expand (1 - t)^2 =1 -2t +t², then multiply by (1 - 2t +2t²):First, multiply (1 -2t +t²)(1 -2t +2t²):Multiply term by term:1*1=11*(-2t)= -2t1*2t²=2t²-2t*1=-2t-2t*(-2t)=4t²-2t*2t²=-4t³t²*1=t²t²*(-2t)=-2t³t²*2t²=2t⁴So combine like terms:1-2t -2t = -4t2t² +4t² +t² =7t²-4t³ -2t³= -6t³+2t⁴So (1 - t)^2*(1 -2t +2t²)=2t⁴ -6t³ +7t² -4t +1Multiply by 32:Left side=32*(2t⁴ -6t³ +7t² -4t +1)=64t⁴ -192t³ +224t² -128t +32Set equal to right side:64t⁴ -192t³ +224t² -128t +32 =16t⁴ -48t³ +196t² -168t +40Bring all terms to left side:64t⁴ -192t³ +224t² -128t +32 -16t⁴ +48t³ -196t² +168t -40=0Combine like terms:(64t⁴ -16t⁴)=48t⁴(-192t³ +48t³)= -144t³(224t² -196t²)=28t²(-128t +168t)=40t(32 -40)= -8So equation becomes:48t⁴ -144t³ +28t² +40t -8=0Divide both sides by 4 to simplify:12t⁴ -36t³ +7t² +10t -2=0Hmm, quartic equation. This is getting complicated. Maybe there is a mistake here. Let me check the expansions again.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when expanding (1 - t)^2*(1 - 2t +2t²). Let me redo that:(1 - t)^2 =1 -2t +t²Multiply by (1 -2t +2t²):First term:1*(1 -2t +2t²)=1 -2t +2t²Second term: (-2t)*(1 -2t +2t²)= -2t +4t² -4t³Third term: t²*(1 -2t +2t²)=t² -2t³ +2t⁴Now combine:1 -2t +2t² -2t +4t² -4t³ +t² -2t³ +2t⁴Combine like terms:1-2t -2t= -4t2t² +4t² +t²=7t²-4t³ -2t³= -6t³+2t⁴Thus, (1 -t)^2*(1 -2t +2t²)=2t⁴ -6t³ +7t² -4t +1. Then multiply by 32:64t⁴ -192t³ +224t² -128t +32. That seems correct.The right side was 16t⁴ -48t³ +196t² -168t +40. Let me confirm:Original right side:(4t² -4t +1)(4t² -8t +40)First term:4t²*(4t²)=16t⁴4t²*(-8t)= -32t³4t²*40=160t²-4t*(4t²)= -16t³-4t*(-8t)=32t²-4t*40= -160t1*(4t²)=4t²1*(-8t)= -8t1*40=40Combine:16t⁴-32t³ -16t³= -48t³160t² +32t² +4t²=196t²-160t -8t= -168t+40. Yes, correct.So bringing all terms to left:64t⁴ -192t³ +224t² -128t +32 -16t⁴ +48t³ -196t² +168t -40=0Compute term by term:t⁴:64-16=48t³:-192+48= -144t²:224-196=28t:-128+168=40constants:32-40= -8So 48t⁴ -144t³ +28t² +40t -8=0Divide by 4:12t⁴ -36t³ +7t² +10t -2=0This quartic equation seems difficult. Maybe there is a rational root? Let&#39;s apply Rational Root Theorem.

Maybe it&#39;s factorable.Let me write the quartic:12t⁴ -36t³ +7t² +10t -2=0Attempt to factor:Let me try grouping:12t⁴ -36t³ +7t² +10t -2Group as (12t⁴ -36t³) + (7t² +10t -2)=12t³(t -3) + (7t² +10t -2).

Not integers.This approach isn&#39;t working. Maybe the quartic doesn&#39;t factor nicely, and we need to use another method.Alternatively, maybe this problem is better approached using reflection in 2D. Let&#39;s consider unfolding the prism into a plane.Since the prism has three rectangular faces, if we unfold the prism such that the face containing A and the face containing C₁ are laid out flat, we can then connect A to the reflection of C₁ or vice versa with a straight line crossing the edge B₁C.Alternatively, let&#39;s imagine that we can &quot;flatten&quot; the prism into a plane by unfolding adjacent faces. For example, if we unfold the prism along the edge CC₁, then the face CC₁A₁A can be laid out next to the face BB₁C₁C. Alternatively, unfolding along BB₁.Alternatively, think of the path AP + PC₁ as going from A, through P on B₁C, to C₁. If we can reflect C₁ across the line B₁C, then the minimal path AP + PC₁ would be equivalent to the straight line distance from A to the reflection of C₁ across B₁C.But reflecting across a line in 3D is not straightforward. Alternatively, if we can find a suitable 2D unfolding where the path AP + PC₁ becomes a straight line.Another idea: the minimal path should lie on the surface of the prism. So maybe by unfolding the prism into a plane, the path can be represented as a straight line in the plane.Let me consider that the prism has three rectangular faces. Let me try to unfold the faces such that the points A, P, and C₁ lie on the same plane.For instance, if we unfold the face AA₁C₁C and the face BB₁C₁C into the same plane. Then point A would be on one face, and C₁ on the other. But how?Alternatively, if I unfold the prism along the edge B₁C. Wait, no. Unfolding along an edge adjacent to B₁C.Alternatively, think of the prism as two triangles connected by three rectangles. To go from A to C₁ through P on B₁C, the path would cross two faces: from A to P on one face, and from P to C₁ on another face. If we can unfold these two faces into a plane, then the minimal path is the straight line.So, to do this, we need to determine which two faces the path AP and PC₁ lie on.Point A is on the base face ABC, and C₁ is on the top face A₁B₁C₁. The point P is on B₁C, which is a diagonal from B₁ to C. So the segment B₁C is part of the face BB₁C₁C. Therefore, the path from P to C₁ is within the face BB₁C₁C.The path from A to P would cross the face AA₁B₁B if P is on B₁C. Wait, not necessarily. Let&#39;s see: point A is on the base, and P is on B₁C which is from B₁ (top) to C (base). So the segment AP goes from A (base) to P (which is somewhere on B₁C). Depending on where P is, AP might pass through the face AA₁C₁C or the face AA₁B₁B.Alternatively, perhaps AP and PC₁ lie on different faces, so unfolding those two faces into a plane.Alternatively, think of the prism as a flat net. Let me try to imagine unfolding the prism such that the face containing A (ABC) and the face containing C₁ (BB₁C₁C) are adjacent. Wait, ABC is connected to BB₁C₁C via the edge BC. So if we unfold the prism along BC, then the base ABC and the face BB₁C₁C can be laid out in the same plane.Wait, if I unfold the prism along BC, then the base triangle ABC and the rectangular face BB₁C₁C would form a continuous plane. Similarly, the other face AA₁C₁C can be unfolded as well.But point A is on ABC, and C₁ is on BB₁C₁C. Wait, if we unfold the prism along BC, then ABC and BB₁C₁C form a larger rectangle? Let me see.The base ABC is a right triangle with AC=6, BC=√2, angle at C. The rectangular face BB₁C₁C has sides BC=√2 and CC₁=√2. So unfolding along BC would place the triangle ABC adjacent to the rectangle BB₁C₁C. The triangle ABC would be attached along BC, so when unfolded, the combined figure would be a kite shape or something else?Wait, if we have triangle ABC with right angle at C, and rectangle BB₁C₁C attached along BC, then unfolding would create a shape where triangle ABC is connected to the rectangle along BC. The combined figure would have points A, B, C, B₁, C₁. But I need to visualize this.Alternatively, think of the triangle ABC and rectangle BB₁C₁C as part of a larger flat surface when unfolded. Then point A is on the triangle, and point C₁ is on the rectangle. The segment B₁C is part of the rectangle. So, if we reflect point C₁ over the segment B₁C in this unfolded net, then the minimal path from A to the reflection would cross B₁C at point P, giving the minimal AP + PC₁.But this requires knowing the correct reflection. Alternatively, since in the unfolded net, the coordinates can be represented in 2D, and we can compute the straight line distance.Alternatively, assign coordinates in the unfolded net.Let me attempt this.First, unfold the prism along BC. So, in the original 3D coordinates, point C is at (0,0,0), B is at (0,√2,0), and A is at (6,0,0). The rectangle BB₁C₁C has points B(0,√2,0), B₁(0,√2,√2), C₁(0,0,√2), and C(0,0,0). When unfolded along BC, the rectangle BB₁C₁C can be laid out in the plane such that BC is the same as in the triangle ABC.But in the triangle ABC, BC is from (0,0,0) to (0,√2,0). The rectangle BB₁C₁C, when unfolded, would have BB₁ as vertical from B(0,√2,0) to B₁(0,√2,√2). When unfolded, the rectangle can be placed such that it is adjacent to the triangle ABC along BC.But how to represent this in 2D coordinates? Maybe consider a coordinate system where the triangle ABC is in the plane with C at (0,0), B at (0,√2), and A at (6,0). The rectangle BB₁C₁C, when unfolded, would extend from B(0,√2) upwards (in the z-direction), but in the unfolded net, it&#39;s laid out in the same plane as ABC.Wait, in the unfolded net, the rectangle BB₁C₁C is attached along BC. So in 2D, after unfolding, the rectangle would be adjacent to the triangle along BC. So the combined figure would have triangle ABC connected to rectangle BB₁C₁C along BC. So the coordinates in the net would be:- In triangle ABC: C(0,0), B(0,√2), A(6,0).- In rectangle BB₁C₁C: when unfolded, the rectangle is attached along BC. So, when laid out, the rectangle can be represented as extending from B(0,√2) to B₁(0,√2 + √2) = (0,2√2), and from C(0,0) to C₁(0, -√2). Wait, but depending on the direction of unfolding.Alternatively, when unfolding a right prism along an edge, the adjacent rectangle is placed such that it forms a straight angle with the triangle. So if we have triangle ABC with right angle at C, and rectangle BB₁C₁C attached along BC, then unfolding along BC would place the rectangle perpendicular to the triangle. But in the net, it would be laid out in the same plane, so the rectangle would be adjacent to BC but extending in a different direction.Alternatively, think of the rectangle BB₁C₁C as a vertical rectangle attached to BC. When unfolded, the rectangle can be laid out either to the left or right of BC in the 2D plane.Assuming we unfold it such that the rectangle BB₁C₁C is laid out in the plane perpendicular to the original triangle. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.Alternatively, let me assign coordinates in the unfolded net.Let’s place point C at (0,0). The triangle ABC has points A(6,0), B(0,√2), C(0,0). The rectangle BB₁C₁C can be represented as extending from B(0,√2) upwards (in the y-direction) to B₁(0,√2 + √2)= (0,2√2) and then to C₁(0,0 + √2)= (0,√2), but this seems conflicting.Wait, perhaps another approach. In 3D, the coordinates are:- A(6,0,0)- B(0,√2,0)- C(0,0,0)- A₁(6,0,√2)- B₁(0,√2,√2)- C₁(0,0,√2)When we unfold the prism along BC, we can lay out the rectangle BB₁C₁C into the plane of ABC. To do this, imagine rotating the rectangle BB₁C₁C around the edge BC until it lies in the same plane as ABC. This would effectively create a 2D net where triangle ABC and rectangle BB₁C₁C are adjacent along BC.In this unfolded net, point B₁ would be mapped to a new position in the plane. Let me compute its coordinates.In 3D, the rectangle BB₁C₁C has edges BB₁ and BC. When unfolded into the plane of ABC, the rectangle becomes a parallelogram. But since it&#39;s a right prism, the edges are perpendicular, so when unfolded, the rectangle becomes a square (but with sides of length √2 and √2). Wait, BC is √2 and BB₁ is √2, so the rectangle is a square. When unfolded along BC, the square BB₁C₁C becomes adjacent to the triangle ABC.But how to represent point B₁ in the unfolded net?In the original 3D coordinates, B is at (0,√2,0), and B₁ is at (0,√2,√2). When we unfold the square BB₁C₁C into the plane of ABC, the point B₁ will be moved to a position such that the square is laid out in the plane. Since BC is along the y-axis from (0,0,0) to (0,√2,0), and CC₁ is along the z-axis to (0,0,√2). When unfolded, CC₁ can be represented as going in a different direction, say the x-axis.Wait, maybe in the unfolded net, we can represent the 3D coordinates in 2D by &quot;flattening&quot; the z-axis into the plane. Let&#39;s try:After unfolding, the rectangle BB₁C₁C can be represented with B at (0,√2), C at (0,0), and B₁ at (√2, √2), C₁ at (√2, 0). Then, in this 2D net, the rectangle is a square with side √2.But then point A is at (6,0). So the unfolded net would have triangle ABC connected to the square at BC.But in this case, the distance from A(6,0) to P on B₁C (which is from B₁(√2, √2) to C(0,0)) can be calculated as a straight line in this 2D plane.Wait, but this might not preserve the original distances. Alternatively, we need to ensure that the unfolding preserves the lengths.Alternatively, when unfolding the square BB₁C₁C into the plane of ABC, the coordinates would be:- Point C remains at (0,0)- Point B remains at (0,√2)- Point B₁, which was at (0,√2,√2) in 3D, is now moved to (√2, √2) in 2D.- Point C₁, which was at (0,0,√2), is now moved to (√2, 0) in 2D.Thus, the square BB₁C₁C is represented in the unfolded net as a square with side √2 in the plane.Then, the segment B₁C in the unfolded net is from (√2, √2) to (0,0). The point P lies on this segment.Now, in this unfolded net, point A is at (6,0), and we need to find the minimal distance from A(6,0) to P on B₁C, plus the distance from P to C₁(√2, 0).Wait, but in this unfolded net, C₁ is at (√2, 0). So the problem becomes: find P on B₁C (from (√2, √2) to (0,0)) such that AP + PC₁ is minimized.But in the unfolded net, this is equivalent to reflecting point C₁ over the line B₁C and then finding the distance from A to the reflection. Wait, but in this unfolded 2D plane.But wait, the problem is that in reality, the path AP + PC₁ goes through two different faces of the prism. However, in the unfolded net, they are represented as straight lines in the same plane. Therefore, the minimal path in 3D corresponds to the straight line in the unfolded net.Therefore, the minimal AP + PC₁ is the straight line from A(6,0) to C₁(√2, 0) in the unfolded net, but passing through the segment B₁C.Wait, but in the unfolded net, C₁ is at (√2,0), and A is at (6,0). The straight line from A to C₁ would just be a horizontal line from (6,0) to (√2,0), which doesn&#39;t intersect B₁C (from (√2,√2) to (0,0)). So that doesn&#39;t help.Alternatively, perhaps I need to reflect point C₁ over the line B₁C in the unfolded net. Then the minimal path from A to the reflection would intersect B₁C at P.Let me compute the reflection of C₁ over B₁C.First, in the unfolded net, the line B₁C is from (√2, √2) to (0,0). The reflection of C₁(√2, 0) over the line B₁C.To find the reflection of a point over a line in 2D, we can use the formula.The line B₁C has endpoints (0,0) and (√2, √2), so its equation is y = x.The reflection of point (√2, 0) over the line y = x is simply (0, √2). Because reflecting over y=x swaps the coordinates. Wait, but that&#39;s not quite right. The reflection over the line y=x for any point (a,b) is (b,a). So reflecting (√2,0) over y=x gives (0,√2). But (0,√2) is point B in the unfolded net.Wait, but point B is at (0,√2) in the original triangle. So reflecting C₁(√2,0) over line B₁C (which is y=x) gives point B. So the reflection of C₁ over B₁C is point B.Therefore, the minimal path AP + PC₁ is equivalent to the straight line from A(6,0) to B(0,√2) in the unfolded net, intersecting B₁C at P.But wait, AP + PC₁ would then be the distance from A to B, which is sqrt(6² + (√2)^2) = sqrt(36 + 2) = sqrt(38). But this seems different from previous thoughts. Wait, but maybe not.Wait, in the unfolded net, the path from A to reflection of C₁ (which is B) passes through P on B₁C. So the distance AP + PC₁ is equal to AB in the unfolded net, which is sqrt(38). Therefore, is the minimal value sqrt(38)?But let me verify.In the unfolded net, when you reflect C₁ over B₁C (which is y=x), you get point B. Therefore, the minimal path from A to C₁ via P on B₁C is the same as the straight line from A to B in the unfolded net, which intersects B₁C at P. Therefore, the minimal distance is AB = sqrt(6² + (√2)^2) = sqrt(36 + 2) = sqrt(38). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(38), which is approximately 6.164.But let me check with the original 3D coordinates. The distance from A to B is sqrt( (6)^2 + (√2)^2 +0 )=sqrt(36 +2)=sqrt(38). Wait, but in 3D, A is at (6,0,0), B is at (0,√2,0), so distance AB is sqrt(36 + 2 +0)=sqrt(38). However, the problem is asking for AP + PC₁, where P is on B₁C. If in the unfolded net, this sum equals AB, then in 3D, this corresponds to the path moving along two faces. But does this hold?Wait, in the unfolded net, moving from A to P to C₁ is equivalent to moving from A to P on the triangle ABC and then to C₁ on the rectangle BB₁C₁C. But when unfolded, this path is a straight line from A to the reflection of C₁ (which is B). Therefore, the minimal distance is indeed AB, which is sqrt(38). Therefore, the minimal value is sqrt(38).But let me verify this with another approach.Suppose we parametrize P as (0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)) as before. Then, compute AP + PC₁ and see if the minimal value is sqrt(38).If t is such that P is the intersection point of AB with B₁C in the unfolded net. But in 3D, this might not correspond to a straight line.Wait, perhaps in the unfolded net, the straight line from A to B corresponds to a path that goes through P on B₁C in 3D. Therefore, the length of this path is indeed AB, which is sqrt(38). Therefore, the minimal value is sqrt(38).Alternatively, the answer might be different. Let me check.Wait, when you unfold the prism, the distance in the net corresponds to the sum of distances on the faces. So AP in the net is the same as AP in 3D, and PC₁ in the net is the same as PC₁ in 3D. Therefore, the straight line in the net corresponds to the minimal AP + PC₁ in 3D. Therefore, the answer should be the length of the straight line in the net, which is sqrt(38).But let me compute with t= something. For example, if we set P at the midpoint of B₁C, then t=0.5.Coordinates of P: (0, √2(1 -0.5), √2(1 -0.5))=(0, √2/2, √2/2)AP = distance from (6,0,0) to (0, √2/2, √2/2) = sqrt(6² + (√2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2) = sqrt(36 + 0.5 + 0.5)=sqrt(37)= approx 6.082.PC₁ = distance from (0, √2/2, √2/2) to (0,0,√2)=sqrt(0 + (√2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2)=sqrt(0.5 +0.5)=sqrt(1)=1So total AP + PC₁= sqrt(37)+1≈6.082 +1=7.082, which is bigger than sqrt(38)≈6.164. So that can&#39;t be the minimum.Wait, but according to the reflection method, the minimal should be sqrt(38). However, in 3D, the straight line from A to B is  sqrt(38), but this doesn&#39;t pass through B₁C. Wait, in 3D, AB is a straight line on the base face ABC, which does not intersect B₁C. Therefore, my reflection approach might be flawed.Wait, perhaps the unfolding is not done correctly. Maybe reflecting over a different face.Alternatively, maybe I need to reflect point C₁ across the face containing B₁C to get a point C₁&#39;, then compute the distance from A to C₁&#39;.But since B₁C is a line in 3D, reflecting over it is more complex. Alternatively, consider that the minimal path crosses two faces: from A to P on B₁C, which is on the face BB₁C₁C, then from P to C₁ on the same face. Wait, no, P is on B₁C, which is part of the face BB₁C₁C. So the path from A to P would cross through the prism&#39;s interior or other faces.Wait, actually, AP is a straight line from A to P inside the prism. Since the prism is a 3D figure, the straight line from A to P might pass through the interior. Therefore, the problem is to find the minimal AP + PC₁ where P is on B₁C, with AP and PC₁ being straight lines in 3D.This is different from the 2D unfolding, because in 3D, AP and PC₁ are straight lines through the interior, not restricted to the surfaces.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the path has to be along the surfaces. It just says P is a moving point on B₁C, and we need the minimum of AP + PC₁. So AP and PC₁ are straight line distances in 3D.Ah, this is crucial. If the path is allowed to go through the interior, then we can consider AP and PC₁ as 3D straight lines, and the problem becomes finding the point P on segment B₁C that minimizes the sum of distances from A to P and from P to C₁.This is similar to the 2D problem of finding a point on a line that minimizes the sum of distances to two fixed points, which is solved by reflecting one point over the line and taking the straight line distance.But in 3D, reflecting a point over a line is more complex. However, the same principle applies: the minimal path from A to C₁ via a point P on line B₁C is achieved when the angles of incidence and reflection are equal, i.e., when the path AP + PC₁ reflects off the line B₁C.In 3D, this reflection can be done by reflecting point C₁ across the line B₁C and then finding the distance from A to the reflection.But how to compute the reflection of a point over a line in 3D?Alternatively, parameterize P on B₁C and find the minimal AP + PC₁.Alternatively, since P is on B₁C, we can write the coordinates of P as a function of a parameter t, then compute the sum AP + PC₁ as a function of t, then minimize it.We did this earlier, but it led to a quartic equation. Maybe we can solve this numerically.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when the derivative is zero, but solving the quartic is complicated. Alternatively, notice that the minimal path in 3D would have the direction vector from A to P and from P to C₁ making equal angles with the line B₁C.Alternatively, use calculus and solve for t numerically.Given that f(t) = sqrt(36 +4(1-t)^2) + sqrt(2(2t² -2t +1))Let me compute f(t) at various t:At t=0 (P=C):AP = AC = 6PC₁ = CC₁ = √2Sum:6 +√2 ≈6 +1.414≈7.414At t=1 (P=B₁):AP = AB₁ = distance from A(6,0,0) to B₁(0,√2,√2)=sqrt(6² + (√2)^2 + (√2)^2)=sqrt(36 +2 +2)=sqrt(40)=2√10≈6.324PC₁ = B₁C₁= distance from B₁(0,√2,√2) to C₁(0,0,√2)=sqrt(0 + (√2)^2 +0)=√2≈1.414Sum:≈6.324 +1.414≈7.738At t=0.5:AP≈sqrt(37)≈6.082, PC₁=1, sum≈7.082At t=0.3:Compute:AP= sqrt[36 +4*(0.7)^2]=sqrt[36 +4*0.49]=sqrt[36 +1.96]=sqrt[37.96]≈6.16PC₁= sqrt[2*(1 -0.6 +2*(0.09))]=sqrt[2*(0.4 +0.18)]=sqrt[2*0.58]=sqrt[1.16]≈1.077Sum≈6.16 +1.077≈7.237t=0.2:AP=sqrt[36 +4*(0.8)^2]=sqrt[36 +4*0.64]=sqrt[36 +2.56]=sqrt[38.56]≈6.21PC₁=sqrt[2*(1 -0.4 +2*(0.04))]=sqrt[2*(0.6 +0.08)]=sqrt[2*0.68]=sqrt[1.36]≈1.166Sum≈6.21 +1.166≈7.376t=0.25:AP= sqrt[36 +4*(0.75)^2]=sqrt[36 +4*0.5625]=sqrt[36 +2.25]=sqrt[38.25]=6.185PC₁=sqrt[2*(1 -0.5 +2*(0.0625))]=sqrt[2*(0.5 +0.125)]=sqrt[2*0.625]=sqrt[1.25]≈1.118Sum≈6.185 +1.118≈7.303Wait, earlier when I thought the answer might be sqrt(38)=approx6.164, but none of the computed values for t between 0 and 1 give a sum less than about7. So maybe my reflection approach was wrong.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reflection. Maybe reflecting in a different way.Alternatively, the minimal path in 3D would be when AP + PC₁ is minimized by choosing P such that the angles at P satisfy the law of reflection. In 3D, this is more complex, but the idea is that the direction vectors before and after P should make equal angles with the normal to the line B₁C at P.Alternatively, since B₁C is a straight line in 3D, and we need to minimize the sum of distances from A to P and P to C₁, the problem reduces to finding the point P on B₁C such that the angle between AP and the tangent to B₁C at P is equal to the angle between PC₁ and the tangent to B₁C at P.But this requires calculus of variations or Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, parameterize P as before and solve numerically.But given the quartic equation is too complicated, maybe we can use calculus to approximate the solution.Alternatively, set up the derivative equation:-4(1 - t)/sqrt(36 +4(1 -t)^2) + (2t -1)/sqrt(2(2t² -2t +1))=0Let me denote:Let’s let u = t, then equation is:-4(1 - u)/sqrt(36 +4(1 -u)^2) = -(2u -1)/sqrt(2(2u² -2u +1))Multiply both sides by sqrt(2(2u² -2u +1)) and sqrt(36 +4(1 -u)^2)):-4(1 - u)sqrt(2(2u² -2u +1)) = -(2u -1)sqrt(36 +4(1 -u)^2)Square both sides:16(1 - u)^2 *2(2u² -2u +1) = (2u -1)^2*(36 +4(1 -u)^2)Which is the same equation as before:32(1 - u)^2 (2u² -2u +1) = (4u² -4u +1)(36 +4(1 -u)^2)Which simplifies to the same quartic:48u⁴ -144u³ +28u² +40u -8=0Not helpful. Maybe try using numerical methods.Let me define f(t) = -4(1 - t)/sqrt(36 +4(1 -t)^2) + (2t -1)/sqrt(2(2t² -2t +1))We need to find t where f(t)=0.Let me compute f(0.5):-4*(0.5)/sqrt(36 +4*(0.5)^2) + (0)/sqrt(...)= -2/sqrt(36 +1) +0= -2/sqrt(37)≈-0.328f(0.5)= -0.328f(0.6):-4*(0.4)/sqrt(36 +4*(0.4)^2) + (0.2)/sqrt(2*(2*0.36 -1.2 +1))Compute:First term: -1.6/sqrt(36 +0.64)= -1.6/sqrt(36.64)= -1.6/6.053≈-0.264Second term:0.2/sqrt(2*(0.72 -1.2 +1))=0.2/sqrt(2*(0.52))=0.2/sqrt(1.04)=0.2/1.019≈0.196Total f(0.6)= -0.264 +0.196≈-0.068f(0.65):First term: -4*(0.35)/sqrt(36 +4*(0.35)^2)= -1.4/sqrt(36 +0.49)= -1.4/6.041≈-0.232Second term: (1.3 -1)/sqrt(2*(2*0.4225 -1.3 +1))=0.3/sqrt(2*(0.845 -1.3 +1))=0.3/sqrt(2*0.545)=0.3/sqrt(1.09)≈0.3/1.044≈0.287Total f(0.65)= -0.232 +0.287≈0.055So between t=0.6 and t=0.65, f(t) crosses zero. Let&#39;s use linear approximation:At t=0.6, f= -0.068At t=0.65, f=0.055The zero crossing is around t=0.6 + (0 - (-0.068))/(0.055 - (-0.068)) *0.05≈0.6 + (0.068/0.123)*0.05≈0.6 +0.0276≈0.6276Test t=0.6276:Compute first term: -4*(1 -0.6276)/sqrt(36 +4*(1 -0.6276)^2)= -4*0.3724/sqrt(36 +4*0.1386)= -1.4896/sqrt(36 +0.5544)= -1.4896/sqrt(36.5544)≈-1.4896/6.046≈-0.2465Second term: (2*0.6276 -1)/sqrt(2*(2*(0.6276)^2 -2*0.6276 +1))Calculate numerator: 1.2552 -1=0.2552Denominator inside sqrt:2*(2*0.3937 -1.2552 +1)=2*(0.7874 -1.2552 +1)=2*(0.5322)=1.0644So sqrt(1.0644)≈1.0315Second term≈0.2552/1.0315≈0.2473Total f(0.6276)= -0.2465 +0.2473≈0.0008≈0. Close enough.Therefore, t≈0.6276Compute AP + PC₁ at this t:AP= sqrt(36 +4*(1 -0.6276)^2)=sqrt(36 +4*(0.3724)^2)=sqrt(36 +4*0.1387)=sqrt(36 +0.5548)=sqrt(36.5548)≈6.046PC₁= sqrt(2*(2*(0.6276)^2 -2*0.6276 +1))=sqrt(2*(0.7874 -1.2552 +1))=sqrt(2*0.5322)=sqrt(1.0644)=1.0315Sum≈6.046 +1.0315≈7.0775Wait, but this is higher than sqrt(38)≈6.164. But according to the reflection method, the answer should be sqrt(38). There&#39;s a contradiction here.But in 3D, the minimal path should not be shorter than the straight line from A to C₁, which is sqrt( (6)^2 +0^2 + (√2)^2 )=sqrt(36 +2)=sqrt(38)≈6.164. However, AP + PC₁ is constrained to pass through B₁C. So if the minimal sum is greater than or equal to sqrt(38). But the computed value at t≈0.6276 is about7.077, which is larger than sqrt(38). But according to reflection in the unfolded net, the minimal path is sqrt(38). So which is correct?Wait, in 3D, the straight line from A to C₁ has length sqrt(38). However, this straight line does not pass through B₁C. Therefore, the minimal sum AP + PC₁ must be greater than sqrt(38). Therefore, the reflection approach might be flawed because the reflected point in the unfolded net does not correspond to a feasible path in 3D.Alternatively, maybe the reflection should be done in a different way. Let me think.If we reflect point C₁ across the line B₁C in 3D, then the minimal path from A to the reflection would intersect B₁C at P, giving the minimal AP + PC₁.But how to compute the reflection of C₁ across B₁C in 3D?Given line B₁C in 3D with parametric equation:B₁ is at (0,√2,√2), C is at (0,0,0). The direction vector of B₁C is (0 -0, 0 -√2, 0 -√2)= (0, -√2, -√2). So parametric equations: x=0, y=√2 -√2*t, z=√2 -√2*t for t in [0,1].To reflect point C₁(0,0,√2) over line B₁C.The reflection of a point over a line in 3D can be calculated using the formula:Given line L: P(t) = B₁ + t*d, where d is the direction vector.Point Q to be reflected.The reflection Q&#39; of Q over L is given by Q&#39; = 2*proj_L(Q - B₁) + B₁ - Q.First, compute the projection of vector QC₁ onto line B₁C.Wait, let me clarify. Let’s denote Q as C₁(0,0,√2). We need to find the reflection of Q over line B₁C.First, compute the vector from B₁ to Q: Q - B₁ = (0 -0, 0 -√2, √2 -√2)= (0, -√2, 0)The direction vector of line B₁C is d = (0, -√2, -√2)The projection of vector Q - B₁ onto d is:proj_d(Q - B₁) = [( (Q - B₁) · d ) / ||d||² ] * dCompute dot product: (0, -√2, 0) · (0, -√2, -√2) = 0*0 + (-√2)(-√2) +0*(-√2)= 2 +0=2||d||² =0² + (-√2)² + (-√2)²=0 +2 +2=4Therefore, proj_d(Q - B₁)= (2/4)*d= (0, -√2/2, -√2/2)Thus, the reflection Q&#39; = B₁ + 2*proj_d(Q - B₁) - (Q - B₁)Wait, the formula for reflection over line L is Q&#39; = 2*proj_L(Q - B₁) + B₁ - QWait, let me use the standard formula.The reflection of a point Q over line L can be obtained by:1. Find the projection P of Q onto line L.2. Then, the reflection Q&#39; is such that P is the midpoint of Q and Q&#39;. Therefore, Q&#39; = 2P - Q.So, first find the projection P of Q onto line B₁C.Parametrize line B₁C as P(t) = B₁ + t*(C - B₁) = (0, √2, √2) + t*(0 -0, 0 -√2, 0 -√2)= (0, √2(1 - t), √2(1 - t)).We need to find t such that vector Q - P(t) is perpendicular to direction vector d=(0, -√2, -√2).Vector Q - P(t) = (0 -0, 0 -√2(1 - t), √2 -√2(1 - t))= (0, -√2(1 - t), √2*t)Dot product with d=(0, -√2, -√2):0*0 + (-√2(1 - t))*(-√2) + (√2*t)*(-√2) =First term:0Second term: (√2(1 - t))*(√2)=2(1 - t)Third term: (√2*t)*(-√2)= -2tTotal:2(1 - t) -2t=2 -4tSet this equal to zero for perpendicularity:2 -4t=0 =&gt;t=0.5Therefore, the projection P is at t=0.5: (0, √2(1 -0.5), √2(1 -0.5))=(0, √2/2, √2/2)Therefore, reflection Q&#39; = 2P - Q = 2*(0, √2/2, √2/2) - (0,0,√2)= (0, √2, √2) - (0,0,√2)= (0, √2,0)Thus, the reflection of C₁ over line B₁C is point (0, √2,0), which is point B.Therefore, in 3D, reflecting C₁ over B₁C gives point B. Therefore, the minimal AP + PC₁ is equal to the distance from A to B, which is sqrt(38). However, this requires that the path from A to B passes through a point P on B₁C. But in reality, the straight line from A to B in 3D does not pass through B₁C. Therefore, there must be a mistake in this reflection approach.Wait, perhaps in 3D, the reflection gives a virtual point, and the minimal path is the distance from A to the reflection Q&#39;, but the actual path is from A to P to C₁, where P is the intersection of AQ&#39; with B₁C. However, if Q&#39; is B, then the line from A to B does not intersect B₁C, because B is on the base, and B₁C is a diagonal from B₁ to C.Therefore, this suggests that the reflection method might not apply directly in 3D, or that the minimal path isn&#39;t achieved by this reflection.Alternatively, maybe the correct minimal value is indeed sqrt(38), achieved when P is the projection of B onto B₁C, but this is not the case.Alternatively, I must have made a mistake in the reflection process.Wait, but according to the computation, reflecting C₁ over B₁C gives point B, which is on the base ABC. The line AB is in the base ABC, and does not intersect B₁C. Therefore, this suggests that the minimal AP + PC₁ is not achieved by the reflection in this case.Therefore, perhaps the minimal value is higher than sqrt(38), and my initial reflection approach was incorrect because the reflection point does not lead to a path that intersects B₁C.Therefore, we need to rely on the numerical solution. Earlier computations suggest that the minimal value is around7.08, but this seems high.Wait, let&#39;s check with t=0. Let&#39;s go back to AP + PC₁ when t=0 (P=C): AP=6, PC₁=CC₁=√2. Sum=6 +1.414=7.414At t=0.6276, sum≈7.077At t=0.7:AP= sqrt[36 +4*(0.3)^2]=sqrt[36 +4*0.09]=sqrt[36 +0.36]=sqrt[36.36]≈6.03PC₁= sqrt[2*(2*(0.7)^2 -2*0.7 +1)]=sqrt[2*(0.98 -1.4 +1)]=sqrt[2*(0.58)]=sqrt[1.16]≈1.077Sum≈6.03 +1.077≈7.107Wait, not better than t=0.6276. Maybe the minimal sum is around7.07.But according to the 3D reflection, if it were possible, the minimal sum would be sqrt(38)=6.164. However, since the straight line from A to C₁ is sqrt(38), but this line doesn&#39;t intersect B₁C, the minimal sum must be greater than sqrt(38). But according to numerical calculations, the minimal sum is around7.07, which is greater than sqrt(38). Therefore, there must be an error in the reflection approach.Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is obtained by unfolding the prism in a different way.Let me try another unfolding.Consider unfolding the prism such that the face AA₁C₁C is adjacent to the face BB₁C₁C. This way, both A and C₁ are on the same unfolded net.The face AA₁C₁C is a rectangle with sides AC=6 and CC₁=√2. When unfolded next to face BB₁C₁C, which is a square with sides √2, the combined net would have a rectangle of length 6 + √2 and height √2.But how to visualize this?Alternatively, in this unfolded net, point A is at (6,0), and point C₁ is at (0,√2). The line B₁C in this unfolded net would be from B₁(0,√2) to C(0,0). Wait, this seems similar to a previous approach.In this case, the minimal path from A(6,0) to C₁(0,√2) through P on B₁C would be a straight line in the unfolded net. The straight line from A to C₁ intersects B₁C at P. The length of this path is sqrt(6² + (√2)^2)=sqrt(36 +2)=sqrt(38). Therefore, the minimal sum AP + PC₁ is sqrt(38).But in reality, this path goes through two faces: AA₁C₁C and BB₁C₁C. When folded back into the prism, this corresponds to the path from A to P on B₁C to C₁, which is indeed a valid path.Therefore, the minimal value is sqrt(38]</p><div class="divider" data-v-f09ae572></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f09ae572><span class="icon" data-v-f09ae572>🔑:</span>6. 5 sqrt{2} Detailed Explanation: As shown in the figure, connect A B_{1}, and unfold triangle C_{1} B_{1} C along B_{1} C onto the plane A B_{1} C.
