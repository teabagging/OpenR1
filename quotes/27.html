I have this problem about triangle ABC. The angles are opposite the sides a, b, c as usual. The equation given is a sin A sin B + b cos² A = √2 a. We need to find the ratio b/a. Hmm. Alright, let&#39;s start breaking this down.First, I need to recall some trigonometric identities or theorems related to triangles. Since this is a triangle, maybe the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines could be helpful here. The Law of Sines says that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. The Law of Cosines relates the sides with the angles, like c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C. Maybe those can be useful here.Looking at the equation given: a sin A sin B + b cos² A = √2 a. Let&#39;s try to rewrite this equation in terms of ratios like b/a since that&#39;s what we need to find. Let me denote k = b/a, so that b = k a. Then, substituting into the equation:a sin A sin B + (k a) cos² A = √2 a.Divide both sides by a:sin A sin B + k cos² A = √2.So now we have an equation in terms of sin A, sin B, cos A, and k. We need to relate these trigonometric functions. Since it&#39;s a triangle, angles A, B, and C add up to π radians (or 180 degrees). So, A + B + C = π. But we don&#39;t know angle C here. Maybe we can express sin B in terms of sin (π - A - C), but since we don&#39;t have info about angle C, maybe another approach is better.Alternatively, using the Law of Sines: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. Since we have a ratio b/a = k, then from the Law of Sines:b = k a ⇒ (k a)/sin B = a/sin A ⇒ k / sin B = 1 / sin A ⇒ sin B = k sin A.So, sin B = k sin A. That&#39;s helpful! Let&#39;s plug that into our previous equation:sin A * sin B + k cos² A = √2.But sin B = k sin A, so substituting:sin A * (k sin A) + k cos² A = √2 ⇒ k sin² A + k cos² A = √2.Factor out k:k (sin² A + cos² A) = √2.But sin² A + cos² A = 1, so:k * 1 = √2 ⇒ k = √2.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Is k = √2 the answer? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting again, the equation given:a sin A sin B + b cos² A = √2 a.Divide both sides by a:sin A sin B + (b/a) cos² A = √2.Let k = b/a, so:sin A sin B + k cos² A = √2.From the Law of Sines, a/sin A = b/sin B ⇒ b = a sin B / sin A ⇒ k = b/a = sin B / sin A ⇒ sin B = k sin A.So substituting sin B = k sin A into the equation:sin A * (k sin A) + k cos² A = √2 ⇒ k sin² A + k cos² A = √2 ⇒ k (sin² A + cos² A) = √2 ⇒ k * 1 = √2 ⇒ k = √2.Hmm, seems correct. So is the answer √2? But let me think again—if the problem is correct, then maybe yes. But let&#39;s see if there are any constraints or if perhaps this is an identity.Wait, if k = √2, then from the Law of Sines, sin B = √2 sin A. But the sine of an angle can&#39;t exceed 1. So sin B = √2 sin A implies that √2 sin A ≤ 1 ⇒ sin A ≤ 1/√2 ⇒ A ≤ 45 degrees or A ≥ 135 degrees. But since it&#39;s a triangle, all angles must be less than 180, and the sum is 180. So if A is 45 degrees, then sin A = √2/2, so sin B = √2*(√2/2) = 1 ⇒ B = 90 degrees. Then angle C would be 45 degrees. That seems possible. So a triangle with angles 45, 90, 45. Wait, but in a triangle, the sides must satisfy the ratios. If angle A is 45, angle B is 90, angle C is 45, then sides would be a, a√2, a, right? Because in a 45-45-90 triangle, legs are equal and hypotenuse is leg*√2. Wait, but here angle B is 90, so side opposite angle B is b, which would be the hypotenuse. So if a is opposite angle A (45), then a = leg, and b = hypotenuse = a√2. So then b/a = √2. That&#39;s consistent with our answer. So in this case, the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle. So this seems to check out.Alternatively, if angle A were more than 45 degrees, say 60 degrees, then sin A would be √3/2, so sin B would be √2*(√3/2) ≈ 1.2247, which is more than 1, which is impossible. So A must be less than or equal to 45 degrees. But in reality, if A is less than 45, then B would be... Let&#39;s see. For example, if A is 30 degrees, then sin A = 1/2, so sin B = √2*(1/2) ≈ 0.707, which is √2/2 ≈ 0.707, which is sin 45 degrees. So angle B would be 45 degrees. Then angle C would be 105 degrees. But then, in such a triangle, sides a, b, c would be proportional to sin 30, sin 45, sin 105. So a/sin 30 = b/sin 45 = c/sin 105. Then ratio b/a = (sin 45)/sin 30 = (√2/2)/(1/2) = √2. So even in this case, the ratio b/a is √2. Wait, so regardless of the measure of angle A, as long as sin B = √2 sin A, the ratio b/a is always √2? Because from the Law of Sines, b/a = sin B / sin A. If sin B = √2 sin A, then b/a = √2 sin A / sin A = √2. So even if angle A is 30, angle B is 45, then b/a is still √2. Interesting. So in all cases where sin B = √2 sin A, the ratio b/a is √2. Therefore, the answer is √2.But let me check with another example. Suppose angle A is 0 degrees. Wait, but that&#39;s impossible in a triangle. So angles have to be greater than 0. Suppose angle A approaches 0 degrees, then sin A approaches 0, and sin B = √2 sin A approaches 0, so angle B approaches 0, but then angle C approaches 180, which is not possible. So angles have to be such that sin B = √2 sin A, and both angles A and B must be positive and sum to less than 180. So, for example, angle A = 45 degrees, angle B = 90 degrees, angle C = 45 degrees. Or angle A = 30 degrees, angle B = arcsin(√2 * 1/2) = arcsin(√2/2) ≈ 45 degrees. Wait, arcsin(√2/2) is 45 degrees. Wait, but √2/2 is approximately 0.707, which is sin 45. So in this case, angle B would be 45 degrees. Then angle C would be 180 - 30 - 45 = 105 degrees. So this is a valid triangle. In both cases, the ratio b/a is √2. Therefore, seems like regardless of angle A (as long as the triangle is valid), the ratio is always √2. Therefore, the answer is √2.Therefore, the ratio b/a is √2. So the answer is boxed{sqrt{2}}.Final Answerboxed{sqrt{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem in triangle ABC where the equation a sin A sin B + b cos^2 A = sqrt{2} a holds, we need to find the ratio frac{b}{a}.1. Start by dividing both sides of the given equation by a:   [   sin A sin B + left(frac{b}{a}right) cos^2 A = sqrt{2}   ]   Let k = frac{b}{a}, so the equation becomes:   [   sin A sin B + k cos^2 A = sqrt{2}   ]2. Using the Law of Sines, we know frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}, which implies:   [   frac{b}{a} = frac{sin B}{sin A} implies sin B = k sin A   ]3. Substitute sin B = k sin A into the equation:   [   sin A (k sin A) + k cos^2 A = sqrt{2}   ]   Simplify the equation:   [   k sin^2 A + k cos^2 A = sqrt{2}   ]4. Factor out k:   [   k (sin^2 A + cos^2 A) = sqrt{2}   ]   Since sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1, we get:   [   k = sqrt{2}   ]Thus, the ratio frac{b}{a} is boxed{sqrt{2}}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to solve this problem step by step. So we have triangle ABC with sides a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C respectively. The equation given is a sin A * sin B + b cos² A = √2 a. We need to find the ratio b/a.First, let me recall some trigonometric identities and laws related to triangles. The Law of Sines comes to mind, which states that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. Maybe that will be useful here. Also, the Law of Cosines relates the sides of a triangle to the cosine of an angle, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s needed here yet.Looking at the given equation: a sin A sin B + b cos² A = √2 a. Let me try to manipulate this equation. Perhaps I can express all terms in terms of a and b using the Law of Sines. Since we have a and b in the equation, maybe expressing sin B in terms of b, or vice versa.From the Law of Sines, a/sin A = b/sin B, so sin B = (b/a) sin A. Let me write that down: sin B = (b/a) sin A.So, substitute sin B in the original equation. Let&#39;s do that step by step.Original equation: a sin A sin B + b cos² A = √2 a.Replace sin B with (b/a) sin A:a sin A * (b/a sin A) + b cos² A = √2 a.Simplify the first term: the a cancels with 1/a, so we get b sin² A + b cos² A = √2 a.Factor out b from the left side: b (sin² A + cos² A) = √2 a.But sin² A + cos² A = 1, so that simplifies to b * 1 = √2 a.Therefore, b = √2 a, so the ratio b/a is √2. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again.Starting from the equation: a sin A sin B + b cos² A = √2 a.Used Law of Sines: sin B = (b/a) sin A.Substituted into the equation: a sin A*(b/a sin A) + b cos² A = √2 a.Simplify first term: a * sin A * (b/a sin A) = b sin² A.So the equation becomes: b sin² A + b cos² A = √2 a.Factor b: b (sin² A + cos² A) = √2 a.Since sin² A + cos² A = 1, then b = √2 a, so b/a = √2.Hmm, so according to this, the answer is √2. But let me make sure there isn&#39;t a hidden assumption here. For example, did I use the Law of Sines correctly? The Law of Sines does state that a/sin A = b/sin B, so sin B = (b/a) sin A. That seems correct.Is there any possibility that this equation might hold for specific angles, but not in general? Wait, the problem is asking for b/a in triangle ABC, given that the equation holds. So perhaps regardless of the specific angles, as long as the equation is satisfied, the ratio is √2. Let me check with an example.Suppose that angle A is 45 degrees. Then sin A = √2/2, cos A = √2/2. Let&#39;s assume that b/a = √2. Then b = √2 a. Then let&#39;s compute the left side:a sin A sin B + b cos² A.First, sin B. From Law of Sines: sin B = (b/a) sin A = √2 * (√2/2) = (2/2) = 1. So angle B would be 90 degrees. So angle C would be 180 - 45 - 90 = 45 degrees. So the triangle would be a 45-90-45 triangle. But such a triangle would have sides a, b, c where a corresponds to 45 degrees, b corresponds to 90 degrees, and c corresponds to 45 degrees. Using the Law of Sines, a/sin 45 = b/sin 90. So a/(√2/2) = b/1 =&gt; b = a/(√2/2) = a*2/√2 = √2 a. So that checks out. Then let&#39;s compute the left side:a sin A sin B + b cos² A.a * (√2/2) * 1 + √2 a * ( (√2/2)^2 )= a*(√2/2) + √2 a*( (2/4) )= (√2/2)a + √2 a*(1/2)= (√2/2 + √2/2)a = √2 a. Which equals the right side. So in this case, it works.Another example: Let’s take angle A as 30 degrees. Suppose b/a is still √2. Then sin B = (b/a) sin A = √2 sin 30 = √2 * 1/2 = √2/2. So angle B would be 45 degrees or 135 degrees. But in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180, so if angle A is 30, angle B is 45 or 135. Let&#39;s check both cases.Case 1: angle B = 45 degrees. Then angle C = 180 - 30 - 45 = 105 degrees. Then sides would be in proportion to sin 30, sin 45, sin 105. So a = k sin 30 = k * 1/2, b = k sin 45 = k * √2/2, so b/a = (√2/2)/(1/2) = √2. So b/a is indeed √2. Then compute the left side:a sin A sin B + b cos² A.a = k/2, b = k√2/2.Left side: (k/2) sin 30 sin 45 + (k√2/2) cos² 30.Compute each term:First term: (k/2)*(1/2)*(√2/2) = (k/2)*(√2/4) = k√2/8.Second term: (k√2/2)*( (√3/2)^2 ) = (k√2/2)*(3/4) = (3√2/8)k.Total left side: k√2/8 + 3√2/8 k = (4√2/8)k = (√2/2)k.Right side: √2 a = √2*(k/2) = (√2/2)k. So it matches. So in this case, it works.Case 2: angle B = 135 degrees. Then angle C = 180 - 30 - 135 = 15 degrees. Then sides would be proportional to sin 30, sin 135, sin 15. So a = k sin 30 = k/2, b = k sin 135 = k*(√2/2), so again b/a = (√2/2)/(1/2) = √2. So same ratio. Let&#39;s compute left side:a sin A sin B + b cos² A.a = k/2, b = k√2/2.Left side: (k/2) sin 30 sin 135 + (k√2/2) cos² 30.First term: (k/2)*(1/2)*(√2/2) = (k/2)*(√2/4) = k√2/8.Second term: same as before, (k√2/2)*(3/4) = 3√2/8 k.Total left side: k√2/8 + 3√2/8 k = 4√2/8 k = √2/2 k.Right side: √2 a = √2*(k/2) = √2/2 k. So it also matches. Interesting.Therefore, regardless of whether angle B is acute or obtuse (45 or 135 in the examples), as long as b/a is √2, the equation holds. Thus, this suggests that the ratio b/a must indeed be √2. Therefore, the answer is √2.But let me check another angle to be thorough. Let’s take angle A as 60 degrees. Then if b/a = √2, sin B = (b/a) sin A = √2 * sin 60 = √2*(√3/2) = √6/2 ≈ 1.2247. Wait, but sin B can&#39;t be more than 1. That&#39;s impossible. So this suggests a problem. Wait, hold on. If angle A is 60 degrees, and we assume that b/a = √2, then sin B would be √2 * sin 60 = √2*(√3/2) = √6/2 ≈ 1.2247 &gt; 1, which is impossible. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, angle A cannot be 60 degrees if b/a = √2. But in the original problem statement, we are told that the triangle satisfies the given equation. Therefore, if angle A is such that sin B would exceed 1, then such a triangle cannot exist. Therefore, in such a case, the equation would not hold. But in the problem, we are given that the equation holds. Therefore, angle A must be such that sin B = (b/a) sin A ≤ 1. Since b/a = √2, we have sin B = √2 sin A ≤ 1. Therefore, sin A ≤ 1/√2, so angle A ≤ 45 degrees. Therefore, angle A must be at most 45 degrees. So, in such a triangle, angle A must be acute and less than or equal to 45 degrees. For example, angle A could be 30 degrees, 45 degrees, etc., but not 60 degrees.Therefore, the problem is consistent only if angle A is such that √2 sin A ≤ 1. Therefore, angle A must be ≤ 45 degrees, which is acceptable. So, in the problem, since the triangle exists, the given equation must hold, so angle A is constrained, but the ratio b/a is still √2 regardless of the specific angle A (as long as angle A satisfies the equation, i.e., sin A ≤ 1/√2). Therefore, the answer is indeed √2. The initial steps were correct, and the example with angle A = 60 degrees just shows that such a triangle can&#39;t exist if the equation is to hold, but since the problem states that the equation is satisfied, we can conclude that the ratio is √2.Therefore, the answer is √2.Final Answerboxed{sqrt{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find the ratio (frac{b}{a}) in (triangle ABC) where the equation (a sin A cdot sin B + b cos^2 A = sqrt{2} a) holds.1. Using the Law of Sines:   [   frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} implies sin B = frac{b}{a} sin A   ]2. Substitute (sin B) into the given equation:   [   a sin A left(frac{b}{a} sin Aright) + b cos^2 A = sqrt{2} a   ]3. Simplify the equation:   [   b sin^2 A + b cos^2 A = sqrt{2} a   ]4. Factor out (b):   [   b (sin^2 A + cos^2 A) = sqrt{2} a   ]5. Using the Pythagorean identity:   [   sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1 implies b cdot 1 = sqrt{2} a implies b = sqrt{2} a   ]6. Conclusion:   [   frac{b}{a} = sqrt{2}   ]Thus, the final answer is (boxed{sqrt{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9ea064b2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9ea064b2><span class="icon" data-v-9ea064b2>🔑:</span>2. sqrt{2}.From the given and the Law of Sines, we havebegin{array}{l}sqrt{2} a=a sin A cdot sin B+bleft(1-sin ^{2} Aright) =b+sin A(a sin B-b sin A)=b . text { Therefore, } frac{b}{a}=sqrt{2} .end{array}</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-726bf6f9 data-v-9ea064b2><div class="review" data-v-9ea064b2><div class="review-title" data-v-9ea064b2><span class="icon" data-v-9ea064b2>❓:</span>A triangle of sides frac{3}{2}, frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, sqrt{2} is folded along a variable line perpendicular to the side of frac{3}{2}.

I need to find the maximum coincident area when a triangle with sides 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, and sqrt(2) is folded along a variable line that&#39;s perpendicular to the side of length 3/2. Hmm, first, I should visualize the triangle. Let me sketch it out mentally. The triangle has sides 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, and sqrt(2). Let me check if it&#39;s a right triangle. Maybe that could help.Wait, let me compute the squares of the sides. The longest side is 3/2, which is 1.5. Let&#39;s square all sides:(3/2)^2 = 9/4 = 2.25,(sqrt(5)/2)^2 = 5/4 = 1.25,(sqrt(2))^2 = 2.So, 2.25, 1.25, and 2. Do these satisfy the Pythagorean theorem? Let&#39;s see: 1.25 + 2 = 3.25, which isn&#39;t 2.25. So no, not a right triangle. Hmm. Maybe I should determine which sides are opposite which angles? But perhaps that&#39;s not necessary right now.The problem mentions folding along a variable line perpendicular to the side of length 3/2. Let&#39;s call that side the base. So the base is 3/2 units long. The folding line is perpendicular to this base, so it&#39;s a vertical line if we imagine the base lying horizontally. Since the line is variable, it can be moved along the base. When we fold the triangle along this line, the part of the triangle on one side of the line is reflected over to the other side, and the coincident area is the overlapping region where the original and folded parts overlap. The question is to find the maximum value of this coincident area.Alright, so to model this, let&#39;s set up a coordinate system. Let me place the base of length 3/2 along the x-axis from point A(0,0) to point B(3/2, 0). The folding line is perpendicular to AB, so it&#39;s a vertical line x = t, where t ranges from 0 to 3/2. When we fold the triangle over this line x = t, the part of the triangle to the right of x = t (if t is less than 3/2) will be reflected over to the left, and vice versa. However, since the line is variable, we need to consider t moving from 0 to 3/2 and find the t that maximizes the overlapping area.But first, I need to know the coordinates of the third vertex of the triangle. Let&#39;s call it C. The triangle has sides AB = 3/2, AC, and BC. Wait, but the sides are given as 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, and sqrt(2). Let me confirm which sides correspond to which.Wait, in the problem statement, the sides are given as 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, sqrt(2). Let me denote AB as the base with length 3/2. Then the other two sides are AC and BC. So AC and BC would be sqrt(5)/2 and sqrt(2). Wait, but which is which?To find the coordinates of point C, we can use the distances from points A and B. Let&#39;s suppose that point C has coordinates (x, y). Then, the distance from A(0,0) to C(x,y) is sqrt(x^2 + y^2), and the distance from B(3/2, 0) to C(x,y) is sqrt((x - 3/2)^2 + y^2).Given that the sides are 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, and sqrt(2). Assuming AB is 3/2, then the other two sides must be AC and BC. Let&#39;s check which is which. Let&#39;s denote AC = sqrt(5)/2 and BC = sqrt(2). Alternatively, it could be the other way around. Let me check both possibilities.First, suppose AC = sqrt(5)/2 and BC = sqrt(2). Then:sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(5)/2,sqrt((x - 3/2)^2 + y^2) = sqrt(2).Let me square both equations:x^2 + y^2 = 5/4,(x - 3/2)^2 + y^2 = 2.Subtract the first equation from the second:(x - 3/2)^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 2 - 5/4,Expanding (x - 3/2)^2: x^2 - 3x + 9/4,So x^2 - 3x + 9/4 - x^2 = 2 - 5/4,Simplify left side: -3x + 9/4,Right side: 8/4 - 5/4 = 3/4,So -3x + 9/4 = 3/4,Subtract 9/4: -3x = 3/4 - 9/4 = -6/4 = -3/2,Divide by -3: x = (-3/2)/(-3) = 1/2.So x = 1/2. Plug back into first equation: (1/2)^2 + y^2 = 5/4,1/4 + y^2 = 5/4,y^2 = 5/4 - 1/4 = 4/4 = 1,Thus y = 1 or y = -1, but since it&#39;s a triangle above the base, y is positive. So point C is (1/2, 1).Alternatively, if we suppose AC = sqrt(2) and BC = sqrt(5)/2:sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(2),sqrt((x - 3/2)^2 + y^2) = sqrt(5)/2.Squaring both:x^2 + y^2 = 2,(x - 3/2)^2 + y^2 = 5/4.Subtract:(x - 3/2)^2 - x^2 = 5/4 - 2 = -3/4,Expand: x^2 - 3x + 9/4 - x^2 = -3x + 9/4 = -3/4,So -3x + 9/4 = -3/4,-3x = -3/4 - 9/4 = -12/4 = -3,x = 1.Plug x = 1 into x^2 + y^2 = 2: 1 + y^2 = 2 =&gt; y^2 = 1 =&gt; y = 1.So point C would be (1,1). Wait, but then the side AC would be sqrt((1)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(2), which matches, and BC would be sqrt((1 - 3/2)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt((-1/2)^2 + 1) = sqrt(1/4 + 1) = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2. So yes, that works. Therefore, the triangle can have point C at (1,1) if AC is sqrt(2) and BC is sqrt(5)/2. But in the first case, when AC was sqrt(5)/2, point C was (1/2,1). So which one is the correct configuration?Wait, the triangle has sides 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, and sqrt(2). Let&#39;s check both possibilities.If AB = 3/2, AC = sqrt(5)/2, BC = sqrt(2): point C is (1/2,1). Then the sides:AB = 3/2,AC = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 1) = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2,BC = sqrt( (1/2 - 3/2)^2 + (1 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 1 ) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Yes, that works.Alternatively, if AB = 3/2, AC = sqrt(2), BC = sqrt(5)/2, then point C is (1,1). Then:AC = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2),BC = sqrt( (1 - 3/2)^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt( (-1/2)^2 + 1 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 1) = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2.So both configurations are possible. Therefore, the triangle can be in two different orientations depending on how the sides are assigned. However, the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify the order of the sides, so perhaps we need to consider both possibilities. Wait, but the problem says &quot;a triangle of sides 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, sqrt(2)&quot;, so triangles are determined up to congruence. But since the sides are given without specifying which sides are opposite which angles, maybe both configurations are congruent? Wait, no. Wait, in one case, the side opposite the base AB is sqrt(5)/2, and in the other case, it&#39;s sqrt(2). So depending on how the triangle is oriented, the height might be different.Wait, but folding along a line perpendicular to AB. Maybe the position of point C relative to AB affects the result. Therefore, we need to figure out the correct coordinates of point C. But how?Wait, maybe the problem is in 3D space, but no, folding a triangle along a line is a planar problem. Wait, perhaps we need to check which of the two configurations is valid based on triangle inequality.Given sides 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, and sqrt(2). Let&#39;s check triangle inequalities.First, 3/2 + sqrt(5)/2 &gt; sqrt(2)?3/2 is 1.5, sqrt(5)/2 is approx 1.118, sum is approx 2.618, which is greater than sqrt(2) approx 1.414. Yes.Second, 3/2 + sqrt(2) &gt; sqrt(5)/2? 1.5 + 1.414 approx 2.914 &gt; 1.118. Yes.Third, sqrt(5)/2 + sqrt(2) &gt; 3/2? 1.118 + 1.414 approx 2.532 &gt; 1.5. Yes. So all triangle inequalities hold. So both configurations are possible. Therefore, the triangle can be arranged in two different ways. But which one is correct? Maybe the coordinates don&#39;t matter as long as the sides are correct. Wait, but when folding along a line perpendicular to AB, the position of point C relative to AB might affect the overlapping area.Hmm. Maybe I need to figure out the height of the triangle with respect to base AB. Because the maximum coincident area might relate to the height.Let&#39;s compute the area of the triangle. Using Heron&#39;s formula. The sides are a = 3/2, b = sqrt(5)/2, c = sqrt(2).Compute semi-perimeter: s = (3/2 + sqrt(5)/2 + sqrt(2))/2.But this might be complicated. Alternatively, since we have coordinates for both configurations, we can compute the area.In the first configuration, point C at (1/2, 1). Then the area is (base * height)/2. The base AB is 3/2, and the height is the y-coordinate of point C, which is 1. Wait, but if AB is from (0,0) to (3/2,0), and point C is at (1/2,1), then the height is indeed 1. So area is (3/2 * 1)/2 = 3/4.In the second configuration, point C at (1,1). The base AB is still 3/2. The height is the y-coordinate, which is still 1. So area is (3/2 * 1)/2 = 3/4. Same area. So regardless of the configuration, the area is the same. So maybe both configurations are valid and equivalent in terms of area, but different in shape.Wait, but in the first case, point C is at (1/2,1), so the triangle is leaning more to the left, while in the second case, point C is at (1,1), more towards the center. But since the problem is about folding along a line perpendicular to AB, the position of C might affect the overlapping area when folded.But the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify where the sides are, so maybe we need to consider both possibilities? Or maybe the triangle is unique? Wait, but given three sides, the triangle is unique up to congruence. Wait, but in plane geometry, given three sides, the triangle is unique up to congruence (i.e., rotation and reflection). However, in this case, depending on which sides are which, the triangle can be arranged in two different ways. Wait, but sides are 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, sqrt(2). Wait, but in the plane, given three sides, the triangle is determined uniquely up to congruence. So if we fix the base AB as 3/2, then the position of point C is determined. Wait, but in our two cases, the coordinates are different, but perhaps they are congruent via reflection.Wait, in the first case, point C is at (1/2,1), and in the second case at (1,1). If we reflect the triangle over the vertical line x = 3/4, then (1/2,1) becomes (3/2 - 1/2,1) = (1,1). So they are mirror images. Therefore, the two configurations are congruent, so it doesn&#39;t matter which one we take. Therefore, we can pick either one for calculation purposes. Let&#39;s choose point C at (1,1) for simplicity.Wait, but if we choose point C at (1,1), then AC is sqrt(2), BC is sqrt(5)/2, and AB is 3/2. Alternatively, if we take point C at (1/2,1), then AC is sqrt(5)/2, BC is sqrt(2). But since folding is along a line perpendicular to AB, which is horizontal, the reflection might differ. However, due to the mirror symmetry, the maximum area should be the same regardless of the configuration. Therefore, perhaps either coordinate system works. Let me proceed with point C at (1,1) for simplicity.So coordinates:A(0,0), B(3/2, 0), C(1,1).Now, the triangle is formed by these three points.Now, the folding line is a vertical line x = t, perpendicular to AB. When we fold along x = t, the part of the triangle to the right of x = t (i.e., x &gt;= t) is reflected over to the left (x &lt;= t), and vice versa. The coincident area is the overlapping region between the original triangle and the folded triangle.Our goal is to find the value of t in [0, 3/2] that maximizes this overlapping area.Let me think about how folding affects the triangle. When we fold along x = t, the right part (x &gt;= t) is mirrored to x &lt;= t. The overlapping area would be the intersection of the original triangle and the folded triangle. To compute this, we need to find the region that is common to both the original and the reflected triangle.Alternatively, since folding along x = t maps the right part over the left, the overlapping area is the area of the left part that is covered by both the original and the reflection. Wait, maybe not. Let me think step by step.First, consider the original triangle. When folded over x = t, the portion of the triangle to the right of x = t is reflected over x = t, so their images are on the left side of x = t. The coincident area is where the original left part (x &lt;= t) and the reflected right part overlap.Therefore, to compute the coincident area, we need to find the intersection of the original triangle left of x = t and the reflection of the right part over x = t.Therefore, the overlapping area is the area of the set of points that are in the original triangle and also in the reflected triangle.To model this, let&#39;s consider the equations of the sides of the triangle and their reflections.First, let&#39;s define the original triangle with vertices A(0,0), B(3/2,0), C(1,1).The sides are:AC: from (0,0) to (1,1). The equation is y = x.BC: from (3/2,0) to (1,1). The equation can be found as follows. The slope is (1 - 0)/(1 - 3/2) = 1/(-1/2) = -2. So the equation is y - 0 = -2(x - 3/2), which simplifies to y = -2x + 3.AB: from (0,0) to (3/2,0). The equation is y = 0.Now, when we fold along x = t, the right part (x &gt;= t) is reflected over x = t. The reflection of a point (x,y) over x = t is (2t - x, y). Therefore, the reflected triangle will have vertices:Original right part: the portion of the triangle where x &gt;= t. The vertices of this right part depend on where t is. If t is less than 1, then the line x = t will intersect both AC and BC. If t is greater than 1, then x = t will intersect BC only (since AC goes from x=0 to x=1). Wait, point C is at x=1.So, for t in [0,1], the line x = t intersects both AC and BC. For t in [1, 3/2], the line x = t intersects BC and AB. Wait, but AB is along y=0. Hmm, actually, when t is in [1, 3/2], the line x = t would intersect BC (from (1,1) to (3/2,0)) and AB (from (3/2,0) to (t,0)). Wait, but AB is horizontal from (0,0) to (3/2,0), so for x &gt;= t, where t &gt;=1, x = t intersects BC at some point and AB at (t,0). Wait, but when t &gt;1, x = t will intersect BC at a point (t, y), which can be found by plugging x = t into BC&#39;s equation: y = -2t + 3. But if t &gt;1, then y = -2t + 3. For example, at t=1, y = -2(1) +3 = 1, which is point C. As t increases beyond 1, y decreases. At t=3/2, y = -2*(3/2) +3 = -3 +3 =0, which is point B.Therefore, for t in [0,3/2], the line x = t intersects the triangle at two points: on AC and BC when t in [0,1], and on BC and AB when t in [1, 3/2]. Wait, but when t is in [0,1], the intersection points are on AC (from (0,0) to (1,1)) and on BC (from (1,1) to (3/2,0)). For t in [0,1], the intersection points are:On AC: (t, t) because AC is y = x.On BC: Solving x = t in BC&#39;s equation y = -2x + 3, so y = -2t + 3.Therefore, the intersection points are (t, t) and (t, -2t +3). Wait, but when t is in [0,1], -2t +3 is from 3 to 1. So the segment from (t, t) to (t, -2t +3) is vertical? Wait, no. Wait, x = t intersects AC at (t, t) and BC at (t, -2t +3). So between these two points, the line x = t cuts the triangle into two parts: left part (x &lt;= t) and right part (x &gt;= t). The right part is a polygon with vertices (t, t), (t, -2t +3), (3/2,0), but wait, when t is in [0,1], the right part is bounded by x &gt;= t, within the triangle. So the right part would have vertices (t, t), (1,1), (3/2,0), and (t, -2t +3). Wait, no, because when t &lt;1, x = t intersects AC at (t, t) and BC at (t, -2t +3). Then the right part is a quadrilateral? Wait, no. The original triangle is bounded by AC, BC, and AB. When we cut with x = t, the right part is a polygon with vertices (t, t), (1,1), (3/2, 0), (t, -2t +3). But (1,1) is already part of the original triangle, so maybe not. Let me visualize.Alternatively, when we cut the triangle with x = t, the right part is a polygon with vertices (t, t), (t, -2t + 3), (3/2, 0). But (t, t) is on AC and (t, -2t +3) is on BC. So the right part is a triangle with vertices (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and (3/2,0). Wait, but (3/2,0) is point B. So yes, for t &lt;=1, the right part is a triangle with vertices (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and B(3/2,0). Similarly, for t &gt;=1, the line x = t intersects BC at (t, -2t +3) and AB at (t,0). So the right part is a triangle with vertices (t, -2t +3), (t,0), and B(3/2,0). However, when t &gt;=1, the point (t,0) is along AB from (1,0) to (3/2,0).Therefore, when folding over x = t, the right part is a triangle which is then reflected over x = t. The reflection of this right part over x = t will be a triangle on the left side of x = t. The overlapping area is the intersection between the original left part (the part of the triangle left of x = t) and the reflected right part.So to compute the overlapping area, we need to consider the original left part (from x=0 to x=t) and the reflected right part (which is the reflection of the right part over x = t). The overlapping area is where these two regions intersect.Let me formalize this.Original left part (x &lt;= t):This is the part of the original triangle where x &lt;= t. For t in [0,1], this is a trapezoid or triangle bounded by A(0,0), (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and (0,0). Wait, actually, the left part for t in [0,1] would be a polygon with vertices A(0,0), (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and (0,0). Wait, but how?Wait, the original triangle has vertices A(0,0), B(3/2,0), C(1,1). The left part when cut at x = t is the region from x=0 to x=t. To find the shape, we need to see where x &lt;= t in the original triangle.The left edge is from A(0,0) up to (t, t) along AC, then down to (t, -2t +3) along BC, then back to B? Wait, no, because x &lt;= t. Wait, maybe the left part is a polygon with vertices A(0,0), (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and (0,0). Wait, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Let me think again.Actually, when we cut the triangle at x = t, the left part is the portion of the triangle where x &lt;= t. For the original triangle, which is bounded by AC, AB, and BC.The intersection of x &lt;= t with the triangle would be:- For x &lt;= t, the region is bounded by AC from A(0,0) to (t, t) if t &lt;=1, then by BC from (t, -2t +3) back to some point. Wait, perhaps the left part is a polygon with vertices A(0,0), (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and (0,0). But (0,0) is already included. Wait, maybe it&#39;s a quadrilateral A(0,0), (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and a point on AB? Wait, AB is from (0,0) to (3/2,0). If x &lt;= t, then the intersection with AB is from (0,0) to (t,0). But in the original triangle, the left part would be bounded by AC from (0,0) to (t, t), then by BC from (t, t) to (t, -2t +3), then by AB from (t, -2t +3) to (t,0)? Wait, I&#39;m getting confused.Alternatively, maybe the left part is a polygon with vertices A(0,0), (t, t), (t, y), and (t,0), where y is the y-coordinate on BC at x = t. Wait, but BC at x = t has y = -2t +3. So if t is in [0,1], then y = -2t +3 ranges from 3 to 1. However, the triangle&#39;s BC edge goes from (1,1) to (3/2,0). So at x = t, where t &lt;=1, the point (t, -2t +3) is above y=1? Wait, when t=0, y=3, which is outside the triangle. Wait, hold on. This suggests a miscalculation.Wait, BC is from (1,1) to (3/2, 0). Its equation is y = -2x +3. Let&#39;s check at x=1: y = -2(1) +3=1, which is correct. At x=3/2: y = -2*(3/2) +3 = -3 +3=0, which is correct. So for x between 1 and 3/2, the BC edge is from (1,1) to (3/2,0). Therefore, if we take x=t where t &lt;1, then the line x=t intersects BC extended beyond (1,1). But in reality, the triangle&#39;s BC edge is only from (1,1) to (3/2,0). Therefore, for t &lt;1, the line x = t does not intersect BC within the triangle. Wait, that contradicts previous calculations.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let&#39;s re-examine.The line BC connects (1,1) to (3/2,0). So parametrize BC:x goes from 1 to 3/2,y goes from 1 to 0.The equation of BC can be parametrized as:x = 1 + s*(3/2 -1) = 1 + s*(1/2), where s in [0,1],y = 1 + s*(0 -1) = 1 - s.So solving for s in terms of x:x = 1 + (1/2)s =&gt; s = 2(x -1).Then y = 1 - s = 1 - 2(x -1) = 1 -2x +2 = 3 -2x.So y = -2x +3. But this is the same equation as before, but this is only valid for x in [1, 3/2]. Therefore, for x &lt;1, the line BC does not exist in the triangle. Therefore, if we set x = t where t &lt;1, the line x = t does not intersect BC within the triangle. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong. Therefore, for t &lt;1, the line x = t intersects AC and AB?Wait, but AC is from (0,0) to (1,1). So x = t for t &lt;1 intersects AC at (t, t). Then where else does it intersect the triangle? The other edge of the triangle is BC, but for t &lt;1, x = t does not intersect BC (since BC is from x=1 to x=3/2). Therefore, when t &lt;1, the line x = t divides the triangle into two parts: left part is a trapezoid with vertices (0,0), (t, t), (t,0), and (0,0). Wait, but that seems like a triangle. Wait, maybe it&#39;s a triangle with vertices (0,0), (t, t), and (t,0). Because from (0,0) to (t, t) along AC, then down to (t,0) along the line x = t, then back to (0,0). Yes, that&#39;s a triangle. Similarly, the right part is the rest of the triangle.Wait, but the triangle is bounded by AC, BC, and AB. If we cut it at x = t where t &lt;1, then the left part is bounded by AC from (0,0) to (t, t), then by the vertical line x = t down to (t,0), then back along AB to (0,0). So that&#39;s a quadrilateral? Wait, (0,0) to (t, t) to (t,0) to (0,0). That&#39;s actually a triangle with vertices (0,0), (t, t), (t,0). Yes, because the vertical line from (t, t) to (t,0) is part of the cut.Similarly, the right part is from (t, t) to (1,1) along AC, then to (3/2,0) along BC, then back to (t,0) along AB. Wait, but BC is from (1,1) to (3/2,0). So the right part is a polygon with vertices (t, t), (1,1), (3/2,0), (t,0). That&#39;s a quadrilateral.Wait, but when t &lt;1, x = t intersects AC at (t, t) and AB at (t,0). It doesn&#39;t intersect BC because BC is from (1,1) to (3/2,0). Therefore, the right part is bounded by (t, t) to (1,1) along AC, then to (3/2,0) along BC, then to (t,0) along AB. So this is a quadrilateral with vertices (t, t), (1,1), (3/2,0), (t,0).Therefore, when folding over x = t for t &lt;1, the right part is a quadrilateral, and when folded over, it maps to the left side. The overlapping area is the intersection of the original left part (triangle (0,0), (t, t), (t,0)) and the reflected right part (the reflection of the quadrilateral over x = t).Similarly, for t &gt;=1, the line x = t intersects BC at (t, -2t +3) and AB at (t,0). Then the right part is a triangle with vertices (t, -2t +3), (3/2,0), (t,0). When folded over x = t, this reflects to the left side, and the overlapping area is the intersection of the original left part and the reflected right part.This seems complicated, but maybe manageable.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way. The coincident area when folding along x = t is twice the area of the intersection between the original triangle and the folded triangle. Wait, no. When you fold the right part over, the overlapping area is the region that is covered by both the original left part and the folded right part. So it&#39;s the area where the original left part and the reflected right part overlap.To compute this, we can parametrize the boundaries of both the original left part and the reflected right part and find their intersection.Alternatively, since reflection over x = t maps the right part to the left, the overlapping area is the area of the intersection between the original left part and the reflected right part.So, to compute this, let&#39;s first find the reflected right part.For t &lt;1:Original right part is the quadrilateral with vertices (t, t), (1,1), (3/2,0), (t,0). Reflecting this over x = t gives a quadrilateral with vertices:- (t, t) reflects to (2t - t, t) = (t, t) [since it&#39;s on the fold line].- (1,1) reflects to (2t -1,1).- (3/2,0) reflects to (2t - 3/2,0).- (t,0) reflects to (2t - t,0) = (t,0).Wait, reflecting over x = t, each point (x,y) becomes (2t -x, y). Therefore:- (t, t) → (t, t) [same point].- (1,1) → (2t -1,1).- (3/2,0) → (2t -3/2,0).- (t,0) → (t,0).Therefore, the reflected right part is a quadrilateral with vertices (t, t), (2t -1,1), (2t -3/2,0), (t,0).Similarly, the original left part is the triangle with vertices (0,0), (t, t), (t,0).The overlapping area is the intersection between these two regions.To compute this intersection, we need to find the region that is inside both the original left triangle and the reflected quadrilateral.This seems complex. Maybe we can parametrize the boundaries and find the overlapping polygon.Alternatively, we can note that the overlapping area will be a polygon bounded by the overlapping edges of the original left part and the reflected right part.Let&#39;s attempt to find the equations of the reflected edges.The reflected right part has edges:1. From (t, t) to (2t -1,1): This is the reflection of the edge from (t, t) to (1,1). The original edge is part of AC: y = x. Reflecting this over x = t gives a line from (t, t) to (2t -1,1). Let&#39;s find the equation of this reflected edge.The original edge from (t, t) to (1,1) is part of y = x. When reflected over x = t, the image is from (t, t) to (2t -1,1). Let&#39;s find the equation of this line.The slope between (t, t) and (2t -1,1) is (1 - t)/(2t -1 - t) = (1 - t)/(t -1) = -1. Therefore, the equation is y - t = -1(x - t), which simplifies to y = -x + 2t.2. From (2t -1,1) to (2t -3/2,0): This is the reflection of the edge from (1,1) to (3/2,0). The original edge is part of BC: y = -2x +3. Reflecting this over x = t gives a line from (2t -1,1) to (2t -3/2,0). Let&#39;s find the equation of this reflected edge.The original edge from (1,1) to (3/2,0) has slope -2. The reflection of these points gives (2t -1,1) and (2t -3/2,0). The slope between these two reflected points is (0 -1)/(2t -3/2 - (2t -1)) = (-1)/(-1/2) = 2. So the equation is y -1 = 2(x - (2t -1)), simplifying to y = 2x -4t +2 +1 = 2x -4t +3.3. From (2t -3/2,0) to (t,0): This is the reflection of the edge from (3/2,0) to (t,0), which is part of AB. Reflecting gives a horizontal line from (2t -3/2,0) to (t,0). The equation is y =0.4. From (t,0) to (t, t): This is the vertical line x = t from (t,0) to (t, t).Therefore, the reflected right part has edges:1. y = -x + 2t from (t, t) to (2t -1,1),2. y = 2x -4t +3 from (2t -1,1) to (2t -3/2,0),3. y =0 from (2t -3/2,0) to (t,0),4. x = t from (t,0) to (t, t).The original left part is the triangle with vertices (0,0), (t, t), (t,0). Its edges are:1. From (0,0) to (t, t): y = x,2. From (t, t) to (t,0): x = t,3. From (t,0) to (0,0): y =0.Therefore, the overlapping area is the region that satisfies both the original left triangle and the reflected right quadrilateral.To find this overlapping area, we need to determine the intersection of these two regions. This involves finding the intersection points between the edges of the original left triangle and the reflected right quadrilateral.Let&#39;s find the intersections:1. The original left triangle has edge y = x (from (0,0) to (t, t)).This intersects with the reflected right quadrilateral&#39;s edges:a. y = -x + 2t: Setting y = x = -x + 2t ⇒ 2x = 2t ⇒ x = t, y = t. Which is the point (t, t), which is a common vertex.b. y = 2x -4t +3: Setting x = 2x -4t +3 ⇒ -x = -4t +3 ⇒ x =4t -3.But x must be &lt;= t (since it&#39;s part of the original left triangle). So 4t -3 &lt;= t ⇒ 3t &lt;=3 ⇒ t &lt;=1. Which holds since we&#39;re considering t &lt;1 here. So the intersection point is (4t -3, y), where y = x. Wait, but the original edge is y =x and the reflected edge is y=2x -4t +3. Setting equal:x = 2x -4t +3 ⇒ -x = -4t +3 ⇒ x=4t -3.Therefore, the intersection is (4t -3, 4t -3). But we need to check if this point is within both edges.For the original edge y =x from (0,0) to (t, t): x ranges from 0 to t. So 4t -3 must be between 0 and t.But 4t -3 &gt;=0 ⇒ t &gt;= 3/4.And 4t -3 &lt;=t ⇒ 3t &lt;=3 ⇒ t &lt;=1.Therefore, when t &gt;=3/4 and t &lt;=1, the intersection point (4t -3, 4t -3) is valid.When t &lt;3/4, 4t -3 &lt;0, so the intersection is outside the original left triangle.c. y=0: Intersection at (0,0).2. The original left triangle has edge x = t (from (t, t) to (t,0)). This is shared with the reflected quadrilateral&#39;s edge x = t from (t,0) to (t, t). So no new intersections here.3. The original left triangle has edge y=0 (from (t,0) to (0,0)). This intersects with the reflected quadrilateral&#39;s edges:a. y = -x + 2t: Setting y=0, solve for x: 0 = -x + 2t ⇒ x=2t. But x=2t must be &lt;=t (since original left triangle is x &lt;=t). Therefore, 2t &lt;=t ⇒ t &lt;=0. Which only holds when t=0. So no intersection here except at (0,0) when t=0.b. y=2x -4t +3: Setting y=0, solve 0=2x -4t +3 ⇒x=(4t -3)/2. This x must be &lt;=t (due to original left triangle) and &gt;=2t -3/2 (due to reflected edge&#39;s x range). Wait, the reflected edge from (2t -1,1) to (2t -3/2,0) has x from 2t -3/2 to 2t -1. But since t &lt;1, 2t -3/2 &lt;2t -1. For example, if t=0.5, 2t -3/2=1 -1.5= -0.5, and 2t -1=1 -1=0. So the x ranges from negative to 0. However, the original left triangle is x &lt;=t=0.5. Therefore, x=(4t -3)/2 must be within [2t -3/2, 2t -1] and also &lt;=t.But x=(4t -3)/2. Let&#39;s solve when x=(4t -3)/2 &lt;=t:(4t -3)/2 &lt;=t ⇒4t -3 &lt;=2t ⇒2t &lt;=3 ⇒t &lt;=3/2. Which is always true here since t &lt;=1. However, x must also be &gt;=2t -3/2 (the lower x of the reflected edge). So:(4t -3)/2 &gt;=2t -3/2 ⇒4t -3 &gt;=4t -3 ⇒0 &gt;=0. Equality holds. So x=(4t -3)/2=2t -3/2. Therefore, the intersection is at (2t -3/2,0). But 2t -3/2 must be &lt;=t ⇒2t -3/2 &lt;=t ⇒t &lt;=3/2, which is true, but also must be &gt;=0 for the original left triangle. So 2t -3/2 &gt;=0 ⇒t &gt;=3/4.Therefore, when t &gt;=3/4, the intersection point is (2t -3/2,0), which is on both y=0 and the reflected edge y=2x -4t +3.When t &lt;3/4, 2t -3/2 &lt;0, so the intersection is at (negative x,0), which is outside the original left triangle. Therefore, in this case, the only intersection on y=0 is at (0,0) when t=0.Therefore, putting this together, for t &lt;3/4, the overlapping region is a polygon bounded by (0,0), intersection point(s)? Wait, for t &lt;3/4, the reflected right part&#39;s edges might not intersect the original left triangle except at (t, t) and (t,0). But let&#39;s see.Wait, when t &lt;3/4, the reflected right part&#39;s edges:1. y = -x +2t: This line starts at (t, t) and goes to (2t -1,1). Let&#39;s compute 2t -1 when t &lt;3/4: 2*(3/4) -1 = 1.5 -1 =0.5. So for t &lt;3/4, 2t -1 &lt;0.5 -1= -0.5. Wait, for t=0.5, 2t -1=0, which is (0,1). But that&#39;s outside the original left triangle x &lt;=0.5.Wait, for t &lt;3/4, the reflected edge y=-x +2t from (t, t) to (2t -1,1) would have 2t -1 &lt; t -1 &lt; (3/4 -1) = -1/4. So the point (2t -1,1) is at x=2t -1 &lt;0, which is outside the original left triangle (x &lt;=t). Therefore, the line y=-x +2t starts at (t, t) and goes towards x=2t -1, which is outside. Therefore, within the original left triangle (x &lt;=t), the only intersection is at (t, t).Similarly, the reflected edge y=2x -4t +3 from (2t -1,1) to (2t -3/2,0). For t &lt;3/4, 2t -3/2 &lt; 1.5 -3/2=0, so the x-coordinate is negative, outside the original left triangle. Therefore, the only intersection with the original left triangle would be if this line crosses y=0 within x &lt;=t. As before, solving y=2x -4t +3=0 gives x=(4t -3)/2, which for t &lt;3/4 is negative, so no intersection within x &lt;=t.The third edge of the reflected right part is y=0 from (2t -3/2,0) to (t,0). For t &lt;3/4, 2t -3/2 &lt;0, so the line from (2t -3/2,0) to (t,0) is from a negative x to x=t. Within the original left triangle (x &lt;=t), this edge overlaps with the original edge from (t,0) to (0,0). But since the reflected part starts at (2t -3/2,0), which is negative, the overlap on y=0 is from (0,0) to (t,0).Similarly, the fourth edge x=t from (t,0) to (t,t) is shared.Therefore, for t &lt;3/4, the overlapping area is the region bounded by (0,0), (t, t), (t,0). But the reflected right part only contributes the edge from (t,0) to (t,t), and the rest is outside. Therefore, the overlapping area is just the original left triangle, but wait, the reflected right part when folded over x=t would cover part of the original left triangle.Wait, but if the reflected right part&#39;s edges are outside the original left triangle except at (t, t) and (t,0), then the overlapping area is just the line along x=t, which has no area. That can&#39;t be.Wait, this suggests that for t &lt;3/4, the reflected right part does not overlap with the original left triangle except at the fold line x=t. But that seems incorrect.Wait, perhaps I need to visualize this. When t is small, say t=0.5. The original left triangle is from x=0 to x=0.5, bounded by y=x, y=0, and x=0.5. The reflected right part (original right part from x=0.5 to x=1.5 folded over x=0.5) would be a quadrilateral with vertices (0.5,0.5), (0,1), (-0.5,0), and (0.5,0). But these points are:- (0.5,0.5): on the fold line.- (0,1): reflection of (1,1) over x=0.5.- (-0.5,0): reflection of (1.5,0) over x=0.5.- (0.5,0): reflection of (0.5,0) over x=0.5 is itself.So the reflected right part is a quadrilateral from (0.5,0.5) to (0,1) to (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0). Now, overlapping with the original left triangle, which is from (0,0) to (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,0). The overlapping area would be the intersection between these two shapes.The reflected quadrilateral has edges:1. From (0.5,0.5) to (0,1): y = -x + 1 (since slope is (1 -0.5)/(0 -0.5)= -1).2. From (0,1) to (-0.5,0): y = 2x +1 (slope is (0 -1)/(-0.5 -0)= 2).3. From (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0): y=0.4. From (0.5,0) to (0.5,0.5): x=0.5.The original left triangle has edges:1. From (0,0) to (0.5,0.5): y =x.2. From (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,0): x=0.5.3. From (0.5,0) to (0,0): y=0.So overlapping area is where these two regions intersect.Let&#39;s find the intersection points:1. The edge y = -x +1 of the reflected quadrilateral intersects the original left triangle&#39;s edge y=x at point:x = -x +1 ⇒2x=1 ⇒x=0.5, y=0.5. Which is the point (0.5,0.5).2. The edge y = -x +1 also intersects the original edge y=0 at x=1, but x=1 is outside the original left triangle (x &lt;=0.5).3. The edge y=2x +1 of the reflected quadrilateral intersects the original left triangle&#39;s edge y=x at:x =2x +1 ⇒-x =1 ⇒x=-1, which is outside.4. The edge y=2x +1 intersects y=0 at x=-0.5, which is outside.5. The edge y=0 of the reflected quadrilateral overlaps with the original edge y=0 from x=-0.5 to x=0.5. But within the original left triangle (x &lt;=0.5), the overlapping part is from x=0 to x=0.5.6. The edge x=0.5 is shared.Therefore, the overlapping region is a polygon with vertices (0,0), (0.5,0.5), (0.5,0). Wait, but that&#39;s the entire original left triangle. However, the reflected quadrilateral covers part of it. Wait, no. The reflected quadrilateral is from (0.5,0.5) to (0,1) to (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0). The intersection with the original left triangle is the region where x &gt;=0 (since original left triangle is x &lt;=0.5 but x &gt;=0). So the overlapping area would be the polygon bounded by (0,0), (0.5,0.5), and (0.5,0). But how does the reflected quadrilateral interact?Wait, the reflected quadrilateral&#39;s edge y=2x +1 from (0,1) to (-0.5,0) passes through x=0, y=1 to x=-0.5, y=0. Within the original left triangle (x between 0 and0.5), the edge y=2x +1 is only present at x=0, y=1, but that&#39;s outside the original left triangle (which is up to x=0.5). The edge y=-x +1 from (0.5,0.5) to (0,1) is from (0.5,0.5) to (0,1). Within the original left triangle, this line is from (0.5,0.5) to (0,1), but since the original left triangle is below y=x (since y=x is from (0,0) to (0.5,0.5)), the line y=-x +1 is above y=x in the original left triangle.For example, at x=0, y=-x +1=1 vs y=x=0. At x=0.25, y=-0.25 +1=0.75 vs y=0.25. So the reflected edge is above the original left triangle&#39;s edge y=x. Therefore, the overlapping area is bounded by y=x from (0,0) to (0.5,0.5), y=0 from (0,0) to (0.5,0), and the fold line x=0.5. But the reflected quadrilateral doesn&#39;t extend below y=0 within the original left triangle except along x=0.5. Therefore, the overlapping area is actually the entire original left triangle. But when you fold over the right part, the reflected right part covers the original left triangle, so the coincident area is the entire original left triangle. But that can&#39;t be, because folding over would only overlap partially.Wait, I&#39;m getting confused. Maybe I need to think differently. The coincident area when folding is the area where the original left part and the reflected right part overlap. For t=0.5, the original left part is the triangle with area 0.5*0.5*0.5=0.125. The reflected right part, which is the reflection of the right quadrilateral, covers a certain area. The overlapping area is where these two regions intersect.But due to the reflection, the right part is mapped to the left side, so parts of the reflected right part may lie inside or outside the original left triangle. For t=0.5, the reflected right part&#39;s vertices are (0.5,0.5), (0,1), (-0.5,0), (0.5,0). Within the original left triangle (x &lt;=0.5), the overlapping region is the area common to both the original left triangle and the reflected right quadrilateral.The original left triangle is from (0,0) to (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,0). The reflected right quadrilateral is from (0.5,0.5) to (0,1) to (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0). The overlapping area is the region where both shapes intersect. This seems to be the triangle from (0,0) to (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,0), but also considering the reflected parts.However, the reflected right part includes the point (0,1), which is outside the original left triangle. The edge from (0.5,0.5) to (0,1) is above the original left triangle&#39;s edge y=x. Therefore, the overlapping area is actually just the triangle from (0,0) to (0.5,0.5) to (0.5,0). Wait, but this is the entire original left triangle. Is that possible?But if you fold over the right part, which is half of the triangle, over to the left, wouldn&#39;t the overlapping area be something less? Maybe not, because the reflected right part might exactly cover the original left triangle. But that seems unlikely.Wait, let&#39;s compute areas. The original left triangle has area (0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5)=0.125. The reflected right part&#39;s area is the same as the original right part, which is the area of the quadrilateral (t, t), (1,1), (3/2,0), (t,0). For t=0.5, this quadrilateral has vertices (0.5,0.5), (1,1), (1.5,0), (0.5,0). The area can be computed as the area of the triangle (1,1), (1.5,0), (0.5,0). Using coordinates:Area = 0.5 * |(1*(0 - 0) + 1.5*(0 -1) +0.5*(1 -0))| = 0.5 * |0 -1.5 +0.5| = 0.5 * |-1| =0.5.But the original right part&#39;s area should be equal to the original area minus the left part. The original area is 3/4=0.75. The left part area is0.125, so the right part area is0.75 -0.125=0.625. But according to the calculation above, the area of the quadrilateral is0.5. This inconsistency suggests an error in the area calculation.Wait, the quadrilateral for t=0.5 is (0.5,0.5), (1,1), (1.5,0), (0.5,0). To compute its area, we can divide it into two triangles: (0.5,0.5), (1,1), (1.5,0) and (0.5,0.5), (1.5,0), (0.5,0). Wait, no. Alternatively, use the shoelace formula.Coordinates:(0.5,0.5), (1,1), (1.5,0), (0.5,0), (0.5,0.5).Shoelace formula:Sum1 = (0.5*1 +1*0 +1.5*0 +0.5*0.5) =0.5 +0 +0 +0.25=0.75Sum2 = (0.5*1 +1*1.5 +0*0.5 +0*0.5)=0.5 +1.5 +0 +0=2.0Area =0.5*|0.75 -2.0|=0.5*1.25=0.625. Yes, which matches the expected area.Therefore, the reflected right part has area0.625, which when folded over, overlaps with the original left triangle of area0.125. But the overlapping area can&#39;t be larger than0.125. Therefore, the overlapping area must be the entire original left triangle. But that would mean that when folding over, the reflection exactly covers the original left part, but that seems only possible if the triangle is symmetric, which it&#39;s not.Wait, but in this case, the triangle is not symmetric along x=0.5. Therefore, the reflected right part does not exactly overlap the original left part. Therefore, the overlapping area must be less than0.125. Therefore, my previous assumption is wrong.To find the overlapping area, we need to find the intersection polygon between the original left triangle and the reflected right quadrilateral.For t=0.5, the original left triangle is (0,0), (0.5,0.5), (0.5,0). The reflected right quadrilateral is (0.5,0.5), (0,1), (-0.5,0), (0.5,0). The overlapping area is the region where both shapes intersect.The intersection points are:1. Between the edge y=x of the original triangle and the edge y=-x +1 of the reflected quadrilateral: solved earlier at (0.5,0.5).2. Between the edge y=x and y=2x +1 of the reflected quadrilateral: no solution within x &lt;=0.5.3. Between the edge y=0 of the original triangle and the edge y=0 of the reflected quadrilateral: from (0,0) to (0.5,0).4. Between the edge x=0.5 of the original triangle and the edge x=0.5 of the reflected quadrilateral: from (0.5,0) to (0.5,0.5).Additionally, the reflected quadrilateral has a point at (0,1), which is outside the original left triangle. And (-0.5,0), which is also outside.Therefore, the overlapping region is a polygon with vertices (0,0), (0.5,0), (0.5,0.5). This is the entire original left triangle. But this can&#39;t be correct, because the reflected right part is different. Therefore, perhaps the overlapping area is indeed the entire original left triangle when t &lt;=3/4.But when we fold over the right part, which is larger than the left part, why would the overlapping area be the entire left part? That would mean that the reflection of the right part covers the entire left part, which might not be the case.Alternatively, perhaps for t &lt;=3/4, the coincident area is the entire left triangle, and for t &gt;=3/4, it&#39;s something else. But when t=3/4, let&#39;s check:At t=3/4, the original left triangle has vertices (0,0), (0.75,0.75), (0.75,0). The reflected right part&#39;s vertices are:- (0.75,0.75),- (2*(0.75) -1,1) = (0.5,1),- (2*(0.75) -1.5,0) = (1.5 -1.5,0)= (0,0),- (0.75,0).So the reflected right part is a quadrilateral with vertices (0.75,0.75), (0.5,1), (0,0), (0.75,0).The original left triangle is (0,0), (0.75,0.75), (0.75,0). The reflected right part&#39;s edge from (0.5,1) to (0,0) is the line y = -2x +2 (slope from (0.5,1) to (0,0) is -2). This line intersects the original left triangle&#39;s edge y=x at:y =x = -2x +2 ⇒3x=2 ⇒x=2/3 ≈0.6667, y=2/3.Therefore, the overlapping region is a polygon with vertices (0,0), (2/3,2/3), (0.75,0.75), (0.75,0).Therefore, the area can be calculated using the shoelace formula:Coordinates: (0,0), (2/3,2/3), (0.75,0.75), (0.75,0).Compute area:Sum1 =0*2/3 + (2/3)*0.75 +0.75*0 +0.75*0=0 +0.5 +0 +0=0.5Sum2=0*(2/3) + (2/3)*0.75 +0.75*0.75 +0.75*0=0 +0.5 +0.5625 +0=1.0625Area=0.5*|0.5 -1.0625|=0.5*0.5625=0.28125=9/32.But the original left triangle&#39;s area is0.5*0.75*0.75=0.28125, which matches. So in this case, the overlapping area is the entire original left triangle.Wait, but when we have an intersection at (2/3,2/3), why is the area still the same? Because the overlapping region is from (0,0) to (2/3,2/3) to (0.75,0.75) to (0.75,0). But this area is the same as the original left triangle.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s compute it properly.Using shoelace formula:List the coordinates in order:(0,0), (2/3,2/3), (0.75,0.75), (0.75,0), (0,0).Sum1:0*(2/3) + (2/3)*(0.75) + (0.75)*(0) + (0.75)*0 + 0*0 =0 + (2/3)*(3/4) +0 +0 +0 = (2/3)*(3/4)=1/2.Sum2:0*(0) + (2/3)*(0.75) + (0.75)*(0.75) + (0.75)*(0) + 0*(2/3) =0 + (2/3)*(3/4) + (9/16) +0 +0 = (1/2) + (9/16) = 8/16 +9/16=17/16.Area=0.5*|Sum1 - Sum2|=0.5*|1/2 -17/16|=0.5*|-9/16|=9/32≈0.28125.The original left triangle area is0.5*0.75*0.75=0.28125, which is9/32. Therefore, the overlapping area is the same as the original left triangle. Therefore, for t=3/4, the overlapping area is the entire left triangle.But when we derived the intersection point at (2/3,2/3), why does the area remain the same? Because the overlapping region is a different polygon but with the same area. Wait, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Unless the overlapping region is the entire left triangle.But according to the coordinates, the overlapping region includes (0,0), (2/3,2/3), (0.75,0.75), (0.75,0), which is a quadrilateral. But the area is the same as the original left triangle. Therefore, this suggests that the overlapping area is indeed the entire left triangle even when there&#39;s an intersection.This implies that for t &lt;=3/4, the overlapping area is the entire left triangle, and for t &gt;3/4, it&#39;s a different shape.Wait, this seems contradictory. How can folding over a part of the triangle result in the overlapping area being the entire left triangle? It must be that the reflection of the right part covers the left triangle completely for t &lt;=3/4, and only partially for t &gt;3/4.Alternatively, maybe my calculations are wrong. Let&#39;s consider t=1.At t=1, the original left part is from x=0 to x=1. The original triangle has vertices (0,0), (1,1), (1,0) (since folding at x=1 intersects BC at (1,1) and AB at (1,0)). The reflected right part is the reflection of the triangle from x=1 to x=1.5. The right part for t=1 is a triangle with vertices (1,1), (1.5,0), (1,0). Reflecting over x=1 gives a triangle with vertices (1,1), (0.5,0), (1,0). The overlapping area is the intersection of the original left triangle (vertices (0,0), (1,1), (1,0)) and the reflected right triangle (vertices (1,1), (0.5,0), (1,0)).The intersection of these two triangles is the quadrilateral with vertices (0.5,0), (1,0), (1,1), and the intersection of the edges. Let&#39;s compute:The original left triangle&#39;s edge from (0,0) to (1,1): y=x.The reflected right triangle&#39;s edge from (0.5,0) to (1,1): y=2x -1.Setting y=x=2x -1 ⇒x=1, which is the point (1,1).Another intersection between the original left triangle&#39;s edge y=x and the reflected edge y=2x -1: x=1, same point.Therefore, the overlapping area is the polygon bounded by (0.5,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0.5,0.5). Wait, but where is (0.5,0.5) from?Wait, the reflected right triangle has vertices (1,1), (0.5,0), (1,0). The original left triangle has vertices (0,0), (1,1), (1,0). The intersection is the area shared by both triangles. The reflected triangle&#39;s edge from (0.5,0) to (1,1) is y=2x -1. This line intersects the original left triangle&#39;s edge from (0,0) to (1,1) at y=x. Setting 2x -1 =x ⇒x=1, y=1. So only at (1,1). Therefore, the overlapping area is the triangle formed by (0.5,0), (1,0), (1,1). But the original left triangle includes all points below y=x from (0,0) to (1,1) and to (1,0). The reflected right triangle includes points between (0.5,0), (1,0), (1,1). Therefore, the overlapping area is the triangle with vertices (0.5,0), (1,0), (1,1).The area of this triangle can be calculated as 0.5 * base * height. The base from (0.5,0) to (1,0) is 0.5. The height is 1 (from y=0 to y=1). So area=0.5 *0.5 *1=0.25.But the original left triangle at t=1 has area0.5 *1 *1=0.5. So the overlapping area is0.25, which is half of the original left triangle. This makes sense because folding over the right half (from x=1 to1.5) reflects it over x=1, overlapping half of the original left triangle.Therefore, this suggests that for t &gt;=3/4, the overlapping area is less than the entire original left triangle, whereas for t &lt;=3/4, it&#39;s the entire original left triangle. But wait, at t=3/4, the overlapping area was computed as9/32≈0.28125, which is equal to the original left triangle&#39;s area at t=3/4, which is0.5*(3/4)*(3/4)=9/32.But when t increases beyond3/4, the overlapping area decreases. So perhaps the maximum overlapping area is9/32≈0.28125, achieved at t=3/4. But we need to verify this.Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs at t=1/2 or another point.Wait, but according to the previous calculation, for t &lt;=3/4, the overlapping area is equal to the area of the original left triangle, which is0.5*t*t=0.5t². This increases as t increases. Therefore, the maximum area under this scenario would be at t=3/4, where the area is0.5*(3/4)²=9/32=0.28125.For t &gt;3/4, the overlapping area is a different shape, and we need to compute its area.Let&#39;s formalize this.Case 1: t &lt;=3/4Overlapping area = area of original left triangle =0.5*t².This function increases with t, reaching0.5*(9/16)=9/32 att=3/4.Case 2: t &gt;=3/4Overlapping area is the area of the intersection between the original left triangle and the reflected right part. For t in [3/4,1], the overlapping area is a quadrilateral, and for t in [1, 3/2], it&#39;s another shape.Wait, we need to compute for t in [3/4,1].For t in [3/4,1], the line x = t intersects AC at (t, t) and BC at (t, -2t +3). The reflected right part is the reflection of the triangle formed by (t, t), (t, -2t +3), and (3/2,0).Reflecting this triangle over x = t gives vertices:- (t, t) remains (t, t).- (t, -2t +3) reflects to (t, -2t +3).- (3/2,0) reflects to (2t -3/2,0).So the reflected right part is a triangle with vertices (t, t), (t, -2t +3), (2t -3/2,0).But this triangle is vertical along x = t from (t, t) to (t, -2t +3), then to (2t -3/2,0).The original left triangle is from (0,0) to (t, t) to (t,0).The overlapping area is the intersection of these two regions.The reflected triangle&#39;s edge from (t, -2t +3) to (2t -3/2,0) has the equation:Let&#39;s find the equation of the line connecting (t, -2t +3) and (2t -3/2,0).The slope is (0 - (-2t +3))/(2t -3/2 -t) = (2t -3)/(t -3/2).Equation: y - (-2t +3) = [(2t -3)/(t -3/2)](x -t).This can be simplified:y +2t -3 = [(2t -3)/(t - 3/2)](x -t).Multiply numerator and denominator by 2:[(4t -6)/(2t -3)](x -t).But (4t -6)/(2t -3) = 2(2t -3)/(2t -3) =2.Therefore, the slope simplifies to2.Wait, wait:Original slope:(2t -3)/(t -3/2).Factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 2t -3 =2(t) -3.Denominator: t -3/2.Let me compute for t=1:Slope=(2*1 -3)/(1 -3/2)= (-1)/(-1/2)=2.Similarly, for t=3/4:Slope=(2*(3/4) -3)/(3/4 -3/2)=(1.5 -3)/( -3/4)=(-1.5)/(-0.75)=2.Therefore, the slope is always2 for any t.Therefore, the equation simplifies to y +2t -3 =2(x -t).Therefore, y =2x -,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem. So, we have a triangle with sides 3/2, sqrt(5)/2, and sqrt(2). We need to fold it along a variable line that&#39;s perpendicular to the side of length 3/2, and find the maximum value of the coincident area after folding. Hmm, let me visualize this.First, let me sketch the triangle in my mind. The side of length 3/2 is the base, and the folding line is perpendicular to this base. When we fold the triangle along this line, parts of the triangle will overlap, and we need to find the maximum area of that overlapping region.Let me label the triangle. Let’s call the base AB with length 3/2. The other two sides are BC = sqrt(5)/2 and AC = sqrt(2). Wait, let me check if this triangle is valid. Using the triangle inequality: 3/2 + sqrt(5)/2 should be greater than sqrt(2). Let me compute that. 3/2 is 1.5, sqrt(5)/2 is approximately 1.118, so their sum is about 2.618, which is greater than sqrt(2) (~1.414). Similarly, 3/2 + sqrt(2) is about 1.5 + 1.414 = 2.914, which is greater than sqrt(5)/2. And sqrt(5)/2 + sqrt(2) is approximately 1.118 + 1.414 = 2.532, which is greater than 3/2. So, the triangle is valid.Next, let&#39;s figure out the coordinates of the triangle to make it easier. Let&#39;s place the base AB along the x-axis from point A(0,0) to point B(3/2, 0). Now, we need to find the coordinates of point C. Let’s use the distance formula. Let point C be (x, y). Then, the distance from A to C is sqrt( (x)^2 + (y)^2 ) = sqrt(2), and the distance from B to C is sqrt( (x - 3/2)^2 + y^2 ) = sqrt(5)/2.So we have two equations:1. x² + y² = 22. (x - 3/2)² + y² = 5/4Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:x² + y² - [ (x - 3/2)² + y² ] = 2 - 5/4Simplify left side:x² - (x² - 3x + 9/4) = 2 - 5/4Which becomes:x² - x² + 3x - 9/4 = 8/4 - 5/4Simplify:3x - 9/4 = 3/4So, 3x = 3/4 + 9/4 = 12/4 = 3Therefore, x = 1Now plug x = 1 into equation 1:1² + y² = 2 =&gt; y² = 1 =&gt; y = 1 or y = -1. Since it&#39;s a triangle above the base AB, we take y = 1.So, coordinates are A(0,0), B(3/2, 0), C(1,1).Alright, that makes sense. Let me confirm the distances:AC: sqrt( (1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 ) = sqrt(2), correct.BC: sqrt( (3/2 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 1) = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2, correct.Good. Now, the folding line is perpendicular to AB (the base) at some variable point. Let&#39;s denote the folding line as l, which is perpendicular to AB at point P, where P is somewhere along AB. Let&#39;s parameterize point P as (t, 0) where t ranges from 0 to 3/2. The line l is the vertical line x = t (since AB is along the x-axis and perpendicular lines are vertical).When we fold the triangle along line l, the part of the triangle to one side of l will be reflected over to the other side. The coincident area is the overlapping region between the original triangle and the folded-over part. We need to find the maximum area of this overlapping region as t varies from 0 to 3/2.Let me visualize folding along x = t. The left side (from x=0 to x=t) will be reflected over to the right side (from x=t to x=3/2), and vice versa. The coincident area would be the intersection of the original triangle and its reflection over line l.Depending on where t is, the overlapping region could vary. For instance, if t is very close to 0, folding along x=0 would just flip the triangle, but the overlap might be small. Similarly, if t is in the middle, maybe the overlap is larger. So we need to model this.Let me consider the reflection of the triangle over line l. The reflection of point C(1,1) over line x=t would be the point C&#39;(2t - 1, 1). Similarly, other points on the triangle would be reflected over x=t.The reflected triangle after folding would be the triangle formed by reflecting points A, B, C over line l. But actually, since we are folding along l, the part of the original triangle on one side of l is reflected onto the other side. So the overlapping area is the intersection between the original triangle and the reflected part.So, depending on where t is, the reflected part might intersect the original triangle in different ways. The overlapping area would be a polygon whose vertices are intersections of the original triangle edges and the reflected triangle edges.To compute this area, I need to find the coordinates of the overlapping region. Let me approach this step by step.First, let&#39;s note that the original triangle has vertices at A(0,0), B(3/2, 0), and C(1,1). The folding line is x = t. When we fold along x = t, the part of the triangle to the left of x = t (i.e., from x=0 to x=t) is reflected over to the right side (x &gt;= t). Similarly, the part to the right of x=t is reflected to the left.However, since the triangle is between x=0 and x=3/2, the reflection will map parts of the triangle beyond x=3/2 if we fold from the left, or below x=0 if we fold from the right. But since we are folding within the triangle, the overlapping area will be within the original triangle&#39;s bounds.But perhaps it&#39;s better to model the reflection of the entire triangle over x=t. The reflected triangle, let&#39;s call it T&#39;, will have vertices:- A reflected over x=t: A&#39;(2t - 0, 0) = (2t, 0)- B reflected over x=t: B&#39;(2t - 3/2, 0)- C reflected over x=t: C&#39;(2t - 1, 1)But depending on t, these reflected points might be inside or outside the original triangle.Wait, actually, when you fold along x=t, only the part of the triangle on one side of x=t is reflected. So if t is somewhere on AB, folding along x=t would reflect the left part (x &lt;= t) over to the right side (x &gt;= t). Therefore, the reflected image would be a triangle that is the reflection of the left part over x=t. Similarly, if we consider folding the right part over x=t, but since the problem says &quot;a variable line perpendicular to the side of 3/2&quot;, which is AB, so the folding line is vertical, and the folding is along that line. The coincident area is where the original and the folded parts overlap.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s better to think that when folding along x=t, the left part (from x=0 to x=t) is mirrored over to x=t to x=2t, but since the original triangle only exists up to x=3/2, the overlapping region would be between x=t and x=min(2t, 3/2). Similarly, folding the right part over x=t would mirror from x=t to x=3/2 over to x=2t - 3/2 to x=t. But since the original triangle is from x=0 to x=3/2, overlapping would occur between x=2t - 3/2 and x=t if 2t - 3/2 &gt;=0.But maybe depending on t, the overlapping area is different. Let me consider two cases: when t is in the first half (t &lt;= 3/4) and when t is in the second half (t &gt;= 3/4). Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s analyze it properly.Alternatively, perhaps there is symmetry here, so the maximum occurs at some specific t. Maybe when the reflection of point C over x=t lies inside the original triangle, leading to a quadrilateral overlapping area, and when it&#39;s outside, leading to a triangular overlapping area.Let me consider reflecting point C over x=t. The reflection is C&#39;(2t -1, 1). For C&#39; to lie inside the original triangle, it must satisfy the inequalities defining the original triangle.The original triangle is bounded by the lines AB, BC, and AC.Equation of AB: y = 0.Equation of AC: from (0,0) to (1,1), which is y = x.Equation of BC: from (1,1) to (3/2, 0). The slope is (0 -1)/(3/2 -1) = (-1)/(1/2) = -2. So the equation is y -1 = -2(x -1), which simplifies to y = -2x + 3.So, the original triangle is defined by y &gt;=0, y &lt;=x (left side), and y &lt;= -2x +3 (right side).So for the reflected point C&#39;(2t -1, 1) to lie inside the original triangle, it must satisfy:1. y =1 &gt;=0: which is true.2. y &lt;=x: 1 &lt;= 2t -1 =&gt; 2t -1 &gt;=1 =&gt; 2t &gt;=2 =&gt; t &gt;=1.But t ranges from 0 to 3/2 (1.5). So if t &gt;=1, then C&#39; is at x=2t -1. Let&#39;s check if x=2t -1 &lt;=3/2 (since the triangle only goes up to x=3/2). So 2t -1 &lt;= 3/2 =&gt; 2t &lt;=5/2 =&gt; t &lt;=5/4 (1.25). So when t is between 1 and 1.25, C&#39; is inside the triangle. Wait, but also need to check if y &lt;= -2x +3.For C&#39;(2t -1, 1):Check y &lt;= -2x +3:1 &lt;= -2*(2t -1) +31 &lt;= -4t +2 +31 &lt;= -4t +5-4t +5 &gt;=1-4t &gt;= -4t &lt;=1But we have t &gt;=1 from the previous condition, so combining t &gt;=1 and t &lt;=1, only t=1.Therefore, the only t where C&#39; lies inside the original triangle is t=1.At t=1, C&#39; is (2*1 -1,1)=(1,1), which is the original point C. So folding at t=1 would just leave the triangle as is, but folding along x=1. Wait, but folding at t=1 would reflect the left half over x=1, but since C is on the line x=1, reflecting it would map it to itself. So perhaps the overlapping area here is the entire triangle? But that doesn&#39;t make sense because folding along x=1 would split the triangle into two parts, each being a mirror image. So the coincident area would be half the triangle? Wait, but if you fold along x=1, the left side (from x=0 to1) is folded over to the right side (x=1 to2), but since the original triangle only exists up to x=1.5, the overlapping area would be from x=1 to1.5? Hmm, maybe not.Wait, perhaps I need a better approach. Let&#39;s parameterize t and find the overlapping area as a function of t, then maximize it.Let’s denote the original triangle as T, and the folded triangle as T&#39;. The overlapping area is T ∩ T&#39;. To compute this, we need to find the region where both the original triangle and the reflected triangle overlap.First, let&#39;s consider folding the left part over x=t. The reflected part of T left of x=t becomes T&#39;, which is a mirror image across x=t. So T&#39; will have vertices at (2t,0), which is the reflection of (0,0), and the reflection of point C, which is (2t -1,1). Wait, but the original left part is from x=0 to x=t, which includes part of AC and part of AB.Wait, maybe this is getting too vague. Let me instead consider how the reflection affects the entire triangle. When you reflect the entire triangle over x=t, the overlapping area is the intersection between T and its reflection T&#39;. The maximum overlapping area when folding along x=t would be the area of this intersection.But in reality, folding only reflects the part of the triangle on one side of x=t over to the other side, so the overlapping area is the intersection between the original triangle and the folded part (which is a subset of the reflected triangle).Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s equivalent to the intersection of T and T&#39;, where T&#39; is the reflection of T over x=t, but only considering the part that is on the other side of x=t.This is getting confusing. Maybe a better way is to model the overlapping region by considering the fold as follows:When folding along x=t, the part of the triangle to the left of x=t is reflected over to the right. Therefore, the overlapping area is the intersection between the original right part (x &gt;= t) and the reflected left part (which is now on x &gt;= t). Similarly, if we fold the right part over, but since the problem says &quot;along a variable line perpendicular to the side of 3/2&quot;, which is AB, so the fold is vertical, and I think folding either side, but the maximum overlapping area would occur when we fold the left part over to the right, given the position of point C.But to avoid confusion, let&#39;s formalize it.Let’s define the fold along x = t. The left part (x &lt;= t) is reflected over x = t to the right side (x &gt;= t). The overlapping area is the intersection between the original triangle (x &gt;= t) and the reflected left part (x &gt;= t). So we need to find the area where both the original right part and the reflected left part exist.To find this area, we need to find the region x &gt;= t where the original triangle and the reflected left part overlap.The original right part of the triangle (x &gt;= t) is bounded by the lines:- x &gt;= t,- y &gt;= 0,- y &lt;= -2x + 3 (the line BC),- And y &lt;= (something else? Wait, the original triangle&#39;s upper boundary for x &gt;=1 is the line BC. For x &lt;=1, the upper boundary is y =x.But since we are considering x &gt;= t, if t &lt;=1, then the upper boundary is y =x from x=t to x=1, and y = -2x +3 from x=1 to x=3/2. If t &gt;1, then the upper boundary is only y = -2x +3 from x=t to x=3/2.Similarly, the reflected left part (which is the reflection of x &lt;= t over x = t) will be a mirror image. The reflected left part on the right side (x &gt;= t) will have its own upper boundary.To model this, let&#39;s find the equation of the reflected upper edge.Original left part (x &lt;= t) has two edges:1. From A(0,0) to C(1,1): this is y =x.2. From C(1,1) to B(3/2,0): this is y = -2x +3.But when we fold x &lt;= t over x = t, points on these edges are reflected. Let&#39;s find the reflection of the left edges.For the edge AC (y =x), the part from x=0 to x=t is reflected over x=t. The reflection of a point (x, y) on AC (where x &lt;= t) is (2t - x, y). So the reflected edge will be the image of y =x under reflection over x=t. Let’s parametrize it.Original point on AC: (x, x), x ∈ [0, t].Reflection over x=t: (2t -x, x).So the reflected edge is parametrized by x&#39; = 2t -x, y&#39; =x, where x ∈ [0, t].Express y&#39; in terms of x&#39;:From x&#39; = 2t -x =&gt; x = 2t -x&#39;So y&#39; =x = 2t -x&#39;Therefore, the equation of the reflected edge is y = 2t -x.Similarly, for the edge CB (from C(1,1) to B(3/2,0)), but if t &lt;1, then the left part of CB is from C(1,1) to some point D(t, y) on CB. Wait, if t &lt;1, then the left part of CB (x &lt;= t) doesn&#39;t exist because CB is from x=1 to x=3/2. Wait, actually, CB is from (1,1) to (3/2,0), which is on the right side. So if t &lt;1, then the left part of the triangle (x &lt;=t) does not include CB. Therefore, the left part of the triangle is only the part from A(0,0) to C(1,1) (edge AC) and from A(0,0) to the point where x=t on AB.Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The left part of the triangle (x &lt;= t) consists of two edges:1. From A(0,0) to the intersection point D on AC at x=t.Wait, if t &lt;=1, then the line x=t intersects AC at (t, t).2. From D(t, t) to the intersection point E on AB at (t,0).Wait, actually, the left part is a polygon with vertices A(0,0), D(t, t), E(t,0), forming a smaller triangle within the original triangle.Similarly, if t &gt;1, then x=t would intersect BC instead. Because AC is from (0,0) to (1,1), so x= t where t &gt;1 would not intersect AC, but instead intersect BC.Wait, at t &gt;1, the line x=t intersects BC at some point. Let me find that.Equation of BC: y = -2x +3.At x=t, y = -2t +3. So if t &gt;1, then the left part (x &lt;=t) would include the entire AC edge (since AC is up to x=1), and from (1,1) to (t, -2t +3) on BC, and from there to (t,0) on AB.But since we are folding over x=t, which is vertical, the left part is x &lt;=t. So folding over x=t reflects the left part (A, D, E) over x=t to the right side.Therefore, after reflection, the image of the left part (A, D, E) over x=t is a polygon with vertices at (2t,0) [reflection of A(0,0)], (2t - t, t) = (t, t) [reflection of D(t, t)], and (2t - t, 0) = (t, 0) [reflection of E(t,0)].Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, reflection of point A(0,0) over x=t is (2t,0). Reflection of D(t, t) over x=t is (2t -t, t) = (t, t). Wait, but D(t, t) is on the line x=t, so its reflection is itself. Similarly, E(t,0) is on x=t, so its reflection is itself. Wait, that seems contradictory.Wait, if we have a left part with vertices at A(0,0), D(t, t), and E(t,0). When reflecting over x=t, point A(0,0) reflects to (2t,0). Point D(t, t) is on the folding line, so it stays the same. Similarly, point E(t,0) is on the folding line, so it stays the same. Therefore, the reflected left part is a triangle with vertices at (2t,0), D(t, t), and E(t,0). But the original right part (x &gt;=t) has vertices at E(t,0), D(t, t) (if t &lt;=1), and B(3/2,0). Wait, this is getting confusing.Perhaps a better approach is to parameterize t and find the overlapping area.Case 1: t &lt;=1In this case, the left part is the triangle A(0,0), D(t,t), E(t,0). When folded over x=t, this becomes a triangle with vertices at (2t,0), (t,t), and (t,0). The original right part is the quadrilateral E(t,0), D(t,t), C(1,1), B(3/2,0). The overlapping area is the intersection between the reflected left part (triangle (2t,0), (t,t), (t,0)) and the original right part.But since 2t could be greater than 3/2 when t &gt; 3/4. Wait, t ranges from 0 to1 here. If t &lt;=1, then 2t &lt;=2, but the original triangle only goes up to x=3/2. So the reflected left part extends from x=t to x=2t. But the original right part is from x=t to x=3/2. Therefore, the overlapping area is the intersection between x=t to x=min(2t, 3/2).But let&#39;s visualize this. The reflected left part is a triangle with vertices at (2t,0), (t,t), (t,0). The original right part is a quadrilateral with vertices at (t,0), (t,t), (1,1), (3/2,0). The overlapping area would be the region where these two shapes overlap.The overlapping area is likely a quadrilateral formed by the intersection points of the reflected triangle and the original right part.Let me find the equations of the edges involved.Original right part:- From (t,0) to (t,t): vertical line x=t, y from 0 to t.Wait, no, actually, the original right part is:From (t,0) to (t,t) along x=t, then from (t,t) to (1,1) along y =x (if t &lt;=1), but wait, when t &lt;=1, D(t,t) is on AC, which is y=x. Then from (1,1) to (3/2,0) along y = -2x +3.Wait, actually, the original right part is:From (t,0) up along x=t to (t,t) [this is the edge ED], then along AC from (t,t) to (1,1), then along BC from (1,1) to (3/2,0). So the upper boundary is y=x from x=t to x=1, and y=-2x +3 from x=1 to x=3/2.The reflected left part is the triangle with vertices (2t,0), (t,t), (t,0). So its edges are:1. From (t,0) to (t,t): vertical line x=t, y from 0 to t.2. From (t,t) to (2t,0): line connecting (t,t) and (2t,0). The slope is (0 - t)/(2t - t) = -1/t. So the equation is y - t = (-1/t)(x - t) =&gt; y = (-1/t)x + 1 + t. Wait, let&#39;s check:Wait, slope is -1/t. Point-slope form:y - t = (-1/t)(x - t)Multiply out:y = (-1/t)x + (1/t)*t + t =&gt; y = (-1/t)x +1 + t? Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, no:Wait, y - t = (-1/t)(x - t)So y = (-1/t)x + (1/t)*t + t=&gt; y = (-1/t)x +1 + t? Wait, that seems incorrect.Wait, let&#39;s compute again. Let me take two points: (t,t) and (2t,0).The slope m = (0 - t)/(2t - t) = (-t)/t = -1.Wait, hold on! The slope between (t,t) and (2t,0) is (0 - t)/(2t - t) = (-t)/t = -1. So the slope is -1, regardless of t. So the equation is y - t = -1*(x - t) =&gt; y = -x + 2t.Ah, that&#39;s better. So the equation of the line from (t,t) to (2t,0) is y = -x + 2t.Similarly, the third edge of the reflected triangle is from (2t,0) to (t,0), which is horizontal line y=0 from x=t to x=2t. But since the original triangle only exists up to x=3/2, this edge might be cut off.So the reflected triangle has edges:1. x=t, y from 0 to t.2. y = -x + 2t, from (t,t) to (2t,0).3. y=0, from (2t,0) to (t,0).But since the original right part is bounded by:- x from t to 3/2,- y from 0 up to y=x (from x=t to1) and y=-2x +3 (from x=1 to3/2).So the overlapping area is the intersection between the reflected triangle and the original right part.Therefore, the overlapping region will be bounded by:- On the left: x = t.- On the right: x = min(2t, 3/2).- The upper boundary is the lower of the two upper boundaries: the original upper boundaries (y=x up to x=1, then y=-2x +3) and the reflected upper boundary (y = -x + 2t).Therefore, to find the overlapping area, we need to determine where y = -x + 2t intersects with the original upper boundaries.First, let&#39;s find the intersection of y = -x + 2t with y =x.Set -x + 2t =x =&gt; 2t =2x =&gt; x =t. Then y=t. So they intersect at (t,t), which is the point D.Next, find the intersection of y = -x + 2t with y = -2x +3.Set -x + 2t = -2x +3 =&gt; x + 2t =3 =&gt; x =3 -2t.The y-coordinate is y = -x + 2t = -(3 -2t) +2t = -3 +2t +2t = -3 +4t.So the intersection point is (3 -2t, -3 +4t).But this point must lie on both lines and within the original triangle.For the intersection to be valid, x must be between 1 and3/2 (since y=-2x +3 is the right edge from x=1 to3/2). So:1 &lt;=3 -2t &lt;=3/2From the left inequality:3 -2t &gt;=1 =&gt; -2t &gt;=-2 =&gt; t &lt;=1.From the right inequality:3 -2t &lt;=3/2 =&gt; -2t &lt;= -3/2 =&gt; t &gt;=3/4.So the intersection point (3 -2t, -3 +4t) is valid only when t ∈ [3/4,1].Additionally, we need y &gt;=0.Check y = -3 +4t &gt;=0 =&gt;4t &gt;=3 =&gt;t &gt;=3/4.So, when t &gt;=3/4, the intersection point (3 -2t, -3 +4t) is within the original triangle.Therefore, for t in [0, 3/4), the reflected edge y = -x +2t does not intersect y=-2x +3 within the original triangle. Instead, it might intersect y=0 at some point.Wait, for t &lt;3/4, the line y = -x +2t will intersect y=0 at x=2t, which is within the original triangle if 2t &lt;=3/2, i.e., t &lt;=3/4. But since t &lt;3/4 here, x=2t &lt;3/2* (3/4 is 0.75, 3/2 is 1.5). So yes, the line y=-x +2t intersects y=0 at x=2t, which is within the original triangle.But in the original right part, the upper boundary is y=x up to x=1, then y=-2x +3. So, for t &lt;3/4, the reflected upper edge y=-x +2t will intersect the original upper boundary y=x at (t,t), and then continue down to (2t,0). But since t &lt;3/4, 2t &lt;1.5, but also 2t &lt;1.5, but t &lt;0.75, so 2t &lt;1.5. However, the original upper boundary for x &lt;1 is y=x. Therefore, the overlapping area&#39;s upper boundary is the lower of y=x and y=-x +2t.But for x between t and2t, which is the range of the reflected triangle.Wait, let&#39;s take t=0.5 as an example (t &lt;3/4). Then the reflected triangle has vertices at (1,0), (0.5,0.5), (0.5,0). The upper edge is y = -x +1. The original upper boundary from x=0.5 to1 is y=x. So the overlapping area is bounded by x=0.5 to1, y from0 up to the lower of y=x and y=-x +1.Find where y=x and y=-x +1 intersect: x = -x +1 =&gt;2x=1 =&gt;x=0.5, which is at (0.5,0.5). So from x=0.5 to1, the upper boundary is y=x until x=0.5, but since x starts at0.5, the upper boundary is y=x from x=0.5 to1. Wait, but y=-x +1 at x=0.5 is0.5, same as y=x. Then as x increases, y=-x +1 decreases, while y=x increases. Therefore, the upper boundary is y=x from x=0.5 to1, and beyond x=1, it&#39;s y=-2x +3. But in the reflected triangle, the upper boundary is y=-x +1 from x=0.5 to1 (since the reflected triangle ends at x=1 when t=0.5). Wait, no, the reflected triangle when t=0.5 has vertices at (1,0), (0.5,0.5), (0.5,0). So the upper edge is from (0.5,0.5) to (1,0), which is y = -x +1. The original upper edge from x=0.5 to1 is y=x. Therefore, the overlapping region is the area where y &lt;= min(-x +1, x). But since for x between0.5 and1, -x +1 &lt;=x because:At x=0.5, both are0.5.At x=0.75, -0.75 +1=0.25 vs0.75, so -x +1 &lt;x.Therefore, the upper boundary is y=-x +1 from x=0.5 to1. Therefore, the overlapping area is the region under y=-x +1 from x=0.5 to1, and y=0 from x=1 to1. Wait, no, the reflected triangle only goes up tox=1 (since2t=1). Therefore, the overlapping area is a trapezoid from x=0.5 to1, with top edge y=-x +1 and bottom edge y=0. But wait, the original right part has upper boundary y=x from x=0.5 to1. So the overlapping area is the region under both y=-x +1 and y=x. Since y=-x +1 is lower, the overlapping area is under y=-x +1 from x=0.5 to1.Therefore, the area can be calculated as the integral from x=0.5 to1 of (-x +1) dx.Compute that:Integral of (-x +1) dx = [-0.5x² +x] from0.5 to1.At1: -0.5(1) +1 =0.5At0.5: -0.5*(0.25) +0.5= -0.125 +0.5=0.375Difference:0.5 -0.375=0.125.So the area is0.125, which is1/8.Wait, but this is for t=0.5. Hmm, but we need a general expression for t in [0, 3/4) and [3/4,1].Let me formalize this.For t in [0, 3/4):The overlapping area is bounded by x from t to2t, y from0 to the lower of y=-x +2t and y=x.But since for x in [t,2t], y=x is above y=-x +2t?Let&#39;s check at x=t: y=-t +2t =t vs y=t. Equal.At x=2t: y= -2t +2t=0 vs y=2t. Since t&gt;0, y=0 is lower.In between, since y=-x +2t is a line decreasing from (t,t) to (2t,0), while y=x is a line increasing from (t,t) to (2t, 2t). But since2t &lt;1 (because t &lt;3/4=0.75, so2t &lt;1.5). Wait, but x=2t could be less than1 or greater than1.Wait, for t &lt;0.5,2t &lt;1. For t=0.5,2t=1. For t &gt;0.5 but &lt;0.75,2t is between1 and1.5.But in the original triangle, for x &gt;=t, the upper boundary is y=x up tox=1, then y=-2x +3. So if2t &lt;1, then the overlapping region fromx=t to2t is under y=-x +2t and above y=0. But also, the original upper boundary is y=x, so the overlapping area is the region where y&lt;= min(y=-x +2t, y=x). But since y=-x +2t is below y=x in this interval (fromx=t to2t), as seen in the t=0.5 case, the overlapping area is under y=-x +2t.Wait, let me verify with t=0.4 (so2t=0.8 &lt;1). Then the overlapping region is fromx=0.4 tox=0.8. The original upper boundary here is y=x. The reflected upper boundary is y=-x +0.8.Compare y=-x +0.8 and y=x:Atx=0.4, both are0.4.Atx=0.6, y=0.6 vs y=-0.6 +0.8=0.2. So y=-x +0.8 is lower.Atx=0.8, y=0.8 vs y=0. So y=-x +0.8 is lower.Therefore, the overlapping area is bounded by y=0 and y=-x +2t fromx=t tox=2t.Therefore, the area is the integral fromx=t tox=2t of (-x +2t) dx.Compute the integral:∫(-x +2t)dx from t to2t = [ -0.5x² +2tx ] from t to2tAt2t: -0.5*(4t²) +2t*(2t) = -2t² +4t²=2t²Att: -0.5*t² +2t*t= -0.5t² +2t²=1.5t²Difference:2t² -1.5t²=0.5t²So for t in [0, 3/4), the overlapping area is0.5t².But wait, when2t exceeds1 (i.e., t &gt;0.5), then the upper boundary of the original triangle changes atx=1.Wait, but when2t &gt;1, i.e., t &gt;0.5, the overlapping region fromx=t to2t would extend beyondx=1. So for t in (0.5, 3/4), the overlapping area would have two parts: fromx=t to1, the upper boundary is y=x, but the reflected upper boundary is y=-x +2t. Then fromx=1 to2t, the original upper boundary is y=-2x +3, and the reflected upper boundary is y=-x +2t.So we need to split the integral atx=1.But wait, when t &gt;0.5,2t &gt;1, so the overlapping region extends tox=2t, but since the original triangle only exists up tox=3/2, but2t &lt;3/2 when t &lt;3/4. So for t in (0.5, 3/4),2t is in (1,1.5). Therefore, the overlapping area is fromx=t to2t, but the upper boundary is:Fromx=t to1: y= min(y=x, y=-x +2t)Fromx=1 to2t: y= min(y=-2x +3, y=-x +2t)So let&#39;s find where y=-x +2t and y=x intersect: atx=t as before.But betweenx=t andx=1, which one is lower?Atx=1, y=-1 +2t. Since t &gt;0.5,2t &gt;1, so y=-1 +2t &gt;0. The original upper boundary atx=1 is y=1. So compare y=-1 +2t with1.If y=-1 +2t &lt;=1, then the upper boundary is y=-x +2t up to where y=-x +2t &lt;= y=x.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe let&#39;s take t=0.6 (which is in0.5,3/4=0.75):t=0.6,2t=1.2 &lt;3/2.The overlapping area is fromx=0.6 tox=1.2.Fromx=0.6 tox=1, the original upper boundary is y=x, and the reflected upper boundary is y=-x +1.2.Compare y=x and y=-x +1.2:Atx=0.6, both are0.6.Atx=1, y=1 vs y= -1 +1.2=0.2. So y=-x +1.2 is lower.Thus, fromx=0.6 to1, the upper boundary is y=-x +1.2.Fromx=1 tox=1.2, the original upper boundary is y=-2x +3, and the reflected upper boundary is y=-x +1.2.Compare y=-2x +3 and y=-x +1.2:Atx=1, y=-2(1) +3=1 vs y=-1 +1.2=0.2.Atx=1.2, y=-2(1.2) +3=0.6 vs y=-1.2 +1.2=0.So betweenx=1 and1.2, y=-2x +3 is decreasing from1 to0.6, and y=-x +1.2 is decreasing from0.2 to0. The upper boundary is the lower of the two, which is y=-x +1.2.But wait, the original upper boundary is y=-2x +3, which is higher than y=-x +1.2 in this interval. Therefore, the overlapping area&#39;s upper boundary is y=-x +1.2 fromx=0.6 to1.2, and the lower boundary is y=0.Therefore, the area is the integral fromx=0.6 to1.2 of (-x +1.2)dx.Compute:∫(-x +1.2)dx from0.6 to1.2= [ -0.5x² +1.2x ] from0.6 to1.2At1.2: -0.5*(1.44) +1.2*1.2= -0.72 +1.44=0.72At0.6: -0.5*(0.36) +1.2*0.6= -0.18 +0.72=0.54Difference:0.72 -0.54=0.18So area is0.18, which is9/50.But according to the previous formula for t in [0,3/4), which was0.5t², for t=0.6,0.5*(0.6)^2=0.5*0.36=0.18. So matches.Wait, but why does this work even when2t &gt;1? Because when we computed the integral fromx=t tox=2t of (-x +2t)dx, we get0.5t² regardless of where2t is, but in reality, when2t &gt;1, part of the integral is beyondx=1, but since the original upper boundary beyondx=1 is lower? Wait, no. Wait, the overlapping area is defined as the intersection of the reflected left part and the original right part. The reflected left part&#39;s upper boundary is y=-x +2t, but the original right part&#39;s upper boundary is up to y=x or y=-2x +3. However, since we are taking the intersection, it&#39;s the minimum of the two.But in reality, when t &gt;0.5,2t &gt;1, but the overlapping area&#39;s upper boundary is still y=-x +2t because the original upper boundary beyondx=1 is y=-2x +3, which is higher than y=-x +2t in that interval.Wait, forx in [1,2t], y=-2x +3 is greater than y=-x +2t?Let’s check atx=1:y=-2(1) +3=1 vs y=-1 +2t. Since t &gt;0.5,2t &gt;1, so y=-1 +2t &gt;0. But compare to1:If y=-1 +2t &lt;1, then y=-x +2t &lt; y=-2x +3 in some parts.Wait, set -x +2t = -2x +3 =&gt;x +2t =3 =&gt;x=3-2t.So they intersect atx=3-2t, y= - (3-2t) +2t= -3 +4t.But forx in [1,2t], when does3-2t lie in this interval?We havex=3-2t in [1,2t]:1 &lt;=3-2t &lt;=2tFirst inequality:3-2t &gt;=1 =&gt; -2t &gt;=-2 =&gt;t &lt;=1Second inequality:3-2t &lt;=2t =&gt;3 &lt;=4t =&gt;t &gt;=3/4So, for t in [3/4,1], the intersection pointx=3-2t is in [1,2t]. Therefore, in this case, the overlapping area&#39;s upper boundary is y=-x +2t fromx=t tox=3-2t, and y=-2x +3 fromx=3-2t tox=2t.For t in [0.5,3/4):Wait, t=0.6, as before.3-2t=3-1.2=1.8, which is greater than2t=1.2. Therefore, the intersection point is outside the interval [1,1.2]. Therefore, in this case, the upper boundary is entirely y=-x +2t.Therefore, for t in [0,3/4), the overlapping area is0.5t².For t in [3/4,1], the overlapping area is divided into two parts:1. Fromx=t tox=3-2t, upper boundary y=-x +2t.2. Fromx=3-2t tox=2t, upper boundary y=-2x +3.Thus, the area is the sum of the integrals over these two intervals.Compute the area for t in [3/4,1]:First interval: x fromt to3-2t, upper boundary y=-x +2t.Integral of (-x +2t) dx fromt to3-2t:= [ -0.5x² +2tx ] fromt to3-2tAt3-2t:-0.5*(3-2t)^2 +2t*(3-2t)= -0.5*(9 -12t +4t²) +6t -4t²= -4.5 +6t -2t² +6t -4t²= -4.5 +12t -6t²Att:-0.5t² +2t²=1.5t²Difference:(-4.5 +12t -6t²) -1.5t²= -4.5 +12t -7.5t²Second interval: x from3-2t to2t, upper boundary y=-2x +3.Integral of (-2x +3)dx from3-2t to2t:= [ -x² +3x ] from3-2t to2tAt2t:-4t² +6tAt3-2t:-(3-2t)^2 +3*(3-2t)= -9 +12t -4t² +9 -6t=6t -4t²Difference:(-4t² +6t) - (6t -4t²)= -4t² +6t -6t +4t²=0Wait, that can&#39;t be. There must be a mistake here.Wait, compute again:First, integral of (-2x +3)dx is:- x² +3x + CEvaluated at2t:- (2t)^2 +3*(2t) = -4t² +6tEvaluated at3-2t:- (3 -2t)^2 +3*(3 -2t)= -(9 -12t +4t²) +9 -6t= -9 +12t -4t² +9 -6t=6t -4t²So the difference is:(-4t² +6t) - (6t -4t²) = -4t² +6t -6t +4t²=0This suggests that the integral over the second interval is zero, which can&#39;t be right.But this is because when t &gt;=3/4,3-2t &lt;=2t?Wait, for t=3/4,3-2*(3/4)=3-1.5=1.5, and2t=1.5, so the interval [3-2t,2t] is [1.5,1.5], which is a single point. Hence, the integral is zero.For t&gt;3/4, say t=0.8, then3-2*0.8=1.4, and2t=1.6. So the interval [1.4,1.6]. But the original triangle only exists up tox=1.5. So actually, the upper limit should be min(2t, 3/2).Therefore, for t in [3/4, 3/4 + (3/4)/2], i.e., up to t=3/4 + (something), but actually, for t in [3/4, 3/2], but our t ranges up to1.5.Wait, but our previous analysis was for t &lt;=1. Wait, no, in the case when t is in [3/4,1], the intersection point x=3-2t is in [1,2t] only when t &gt;=3/4 and3-2t &lt;=2t =&gt;3&lt;=4t =&gt;t&gt;=3/4. So for t&gt;=3/4, x=3-2t is &lt;=2t (since3-2t &lt;=2t =&gt;3&lt;=4t =&gt;t&gt;=3/4).But the original triangle&#39;s upper boundary beyondx=1 is y=-2x +3 up tox=1.5. So when2t exceeds1.5, i.e., t&gt;0.75, but since our t is up to1.5, but in this problem, the triangle is only up tox=1.5 (3/2). So when2t &gt;1.5, the reflected triangle extends beyond the original triangle. Therefore, for t in [3/4, 3/4 + ...], but the maximum t we need to consider is1.5, but since our original triangle is up tox=1.5, but when folding alongx=t, t can only be from0 to1.5. However, earlier analysis showed that for t&gt;1, the left part includes BC.But wait, in our previous coordinate system, the triangle has vertices at(0,0), (1.5,0), (1,1). So x ranges from0 to1.5.But when folding at t&gt;1, the left part (x &lt;=t) includes more of the BC edge.But earlier, when considering t in [0,1], the analysis holds. For t in [1,1.5], folding would reflect the left part (x &lt;=t) overx=t, but since the triangle ends atx=1.5, the reflected image would be fromx=t tox=2t -1.5. But this might complicate the overlapping area.But since the problem states the folding line is perpendicular to the side of length3/2 (AB), and AB is from0 to1.5 on the x-axis. The variable line can be anywhere fromx=0 tox=1.5, but the maximum coincident area likely occurs beforex=1.5.However, to be thorough, we should consider t from0 to1.5.But the previous analysis up tot=1 might not cover the entire range. However, given that when t&gt;1, the reflected point C&#39;(2t -1,1) hasx=2t -1. For t&gt;1,2t -1 &gt;1, so C&#39; is at(&gt;1,1). The original triangle atx&gt;1 has upper boundary y=-2x +3. So for C&#39;(2t -1,1) to lie inside the original triangle, we need1 &lt;=-2(2t -1) +3.Wait, check if y=1 &lt;=-2x +3 forx=2t -1.So1 &lt;=-2*(2t -1) +31 &lt;=-4t +2 +31 &lt;=-4t +5-4t &gt;=-4t &lt;=1So again, t&lt;=1. Therefore, for t&gt;1, the reflection of point C is outside the original triangle.Therefore, for t&gt;1, the overlapping area is similar to the case when t&lt;3/4, but with different boundaries.But given that the maximum appears to occur at t=1, but when we fold at t=1, the reflection of point C is at(1,1), which is the same point. So the overlapping area might be the entire triangle, but when you fold alongx=1, you are reflecting the left half overx=1, which would map the left half (fromx=0 to1) to the right half (x=1 to2). However, the original triangle only extends tox=1.5. Therefore, the overlapping area would be the intersection of the original right half (x=1 to1.5) and the reflected left half (x=1 to2). But the reflected left half includes the reflection of AC fromx=0 to1, which becomes a line from(2,0) to(1,1). The equation of this line is from(2,0) to(1,1): slope is(1 -0)/(1 -2)= -1, so y= -x +2.But the original triangle&#39;s right half is bounded byx=1 to1.5, y=0 to y=-2x +3.So the overlapping area is the region where both the original right half and the reflected left half overlap.The reflected left half on the right side (x &gt;=1) is under the line y= -x +2.The original right half is under y= -2x +3.Find the intersection of y= -x +2 and y= -2x +3:Set -x +2= -2x +3 =&gt;x=1.Atx=1, y=1. So they intersect at(1,1).Fromx=1 tox=1.5, the original upper boundary is y= -2x +3, and the reflected upper boundary is y= -x +2.Compare these two:Atx=1: both are1.Atx=1.5: y= -3 +3=0 vs y= -1.5 +2=0.5.So betweenx=1 andx=1.5, y= -2x +3 is below y= -x +2. Therefore, the overlapping area&#39;s upper boundary is y= -2x +3.Therefore, the overlapping area when t=1 is the original right half of the triangle, which is a trapezoid with vertices at(1,1), (1.5,0), and the area can be calculated as the area of the original right half.The original right half fromx=1 to1.5 has area:Integral fromx=1 to1.5 of (-2x +3)dx= [ -x² +3x ] from1 to1.5At1.5: - (2.25) +4.5=2.25At1: -1 +3=2Difference:2.25 -2=0.25So area=0.25.But the total area of the triangle is0.5*base*height. The base AB is1.5, height is1 (since point C is at(1,1), but the height from AB is y=1). Wait, no, actually, the height is1. So area=0.5*1.5*1=0.75. So half of that is0.375, but the overlapping area when t=1 is0.25, which is less than half.Therefore, folding at t=1 does not give the maximum coincident area.Earlier, for t in [0,3/4), area=0.5t²For t in [3/4,1], area=?Wait, when t=3/4, let&#39;s compute the area.For t=3/4, the overlapping area is divided into two parts:1. Fromx=3/4 tox=3 -2*(3/4)=3 -1.5=1.5, with upper boundary y=-x +2*(3/4)= -x +1.5.2. Fromx=1.5 tox=2*(3/4)=1.5, so this interval is zero length.Therefore, the area is the integral fromx=3/4 tox=1.5 of (-x +1.5)dx.Compute:∫(-x +1.5)dx from0.75 to1.5= [ -0.5x² +1.5x ] from0.75 to1.5At1.5: -0.5*(2.25) +2.25= -1.125 +2.25=1.125At0.75: -0.5*(0.5625) +1.125= -0.28125 +1.125=0.84375Difference:1.125 -0.84375=0.28125=9/32≈0.28125But according to the formula for t &gt;=3/4:Area= -4.5 +12t -7.5t² +0= -4.5 +12*(3/4) -7.5*(9/16)Compute:12*(3/4)=97.5*(9/16)=67.5/16=4.21875So -4.5 +9 -4.21875=0.28125, which matches.So for t=3/4, area=9/32≈0.28125.For t=1, area=0.25.So the area decreases from t=3/4 to t=1.Therefore, the maximum area occurs at t=3/4, with area9/32.But wait, for t=3/4, the area is9/32≈0.28125, and for t approaching3/4 from below, the area is0.5*( (3/4)^2 )=0.5*(9/16)=9/32≈0.28125. So it&#39;s continuous at t=3/4.Therefore, the maximum coincident area occurs at t=3/4, and the maximum area is9/32.But let&#39;s confirm by checking the derivative.For t in [0,3/4), A(t)=0.5t², which has derivative A’(t)=t, increasing.For t in [3/4,1], A(t)= -4.5 +12t -7.5t²Derivative A’(t)=12 -15tSetting derivative to zero:12 -15t=0 =&gt;t=12/15=4/5=0.8So critical point at t=0.8, which is in [3/4,1].Compute A(0.8):A(0.8)= -4.5 +12*0.8 -7.5*(0.8)^2= -4.5 +9.6 -7.5*0.64= -4.5 +9.6 -4.8=0.3Convert0.3 to fraction:3/10.But3/10=0.3, which is greater than9/32≈0.28125.Wait, so there&#39;s a critical point at t=0.8 where the area is0.3, which is larger than at t=3/4.This suggests that the maximum occurs at t=0.8.But this contradicts the previous calculation where at t=0.8 (which is in [3/4,1]), the area is0.3=3/10, which is greater than9/32≈0.28125.But how come?Let me recast the area function for t in [3/4,1].We found that the area is:A(t) = (-4.5 +12t -7.5t²) +0= -4.5 +12t -7.5t²But this was derived assuming the integral splits atx=3-2t andx=2t.But when t=0.8 (which is greater than3/4=0.75),3-2t=3-1.6=1.4, and2t=1.6.The original triangle only exists up tox=1.5, so the upper limit for the second integral is1.5, not2t.Therefore, there&#39;s a mistake in the previous calculation. The upper limit should be min(2t, 3/2).Therefore, for t in [3/4, 3/2], the upper limit for the second integral is1.5.So, the area computation should be:A(t) = integral fromx=t tox=3-2t of (-x +2t)dx + integral fromx=3-2t tox=1.5 of (-2x +3)dxCompute this correctly for t in [3/4, 1.5]:First integral:∫_{t}^{3-2t} (-x +2t)dx = [ -0.5x² +2tx ]_{t}^{3-2t}At upper limit:-0.5*(3-2t)^2 +2t*(3-2t) = -0.5*(9 -12t +4t²) +6t -4t² = -4.5 +6t -2t² +6t -4t² = -4.5 +12t -6t²At lower limit:-0.5t² +2t*t=1.5t²Difference:-4.5 +12t -6t² -1.5t²= -4.5 +12t -7.5t²Second integral:∫_{3-2t}^{1.5} (-2x +3)dx = [ -x² +3x ]_{3-2t}^{1.5}At1.5:- (1.5)^2 +3*(1.5)= -2.25 +4.5=2.25At3-2t:- (3-2t)^2 +3*(3-2t)= -9 +12t -4t² +9 -6t=6t -4t²Difference:2.25 - (6t -4t²)=2.25 -6t +4t²Therefore, total area:A(t)= (-4.5 +12t -7.5t²) + (2.25 -6t +4t²)= -4.5 +12t -7.5t² +2.25 -6t +4t²= (-4.5 +2.25) + (12t -6t) + (-7.5t² +4t²)= -2.25 +6t -3.5t²So for t in [3/4,1.5], A(t)= -3.5t² +6t -2.25Now, to find critical points, take derivative:A’(t)= -7t +6Set to zero:-7t +6=0 =&gt;t=6/7≈0.8571Check if this is in [3/4,1.5].6/7≈0.8571 is in [0.75,1.5].Compute A(6/7):A= -3.5*(36/49) +6*(6/7) -2.25Convert to fractions:-3.5= -7/2, so:-7/2*(36/49)= - (7*36)/(2*49)= - (36)/(14)= -18/76*(6/7)=36/7-2.25= -9/4So:A= -18/7 +36/7 -9/4= (18/7) -9/4= (72/28 -63/28)=9/28≈0.3214Which is approximately0.3214, greater than the0.3 previously miscalculated.So the maximum area occurs at t=6/7, with area9/28.But wait,9/28 is approximately0.3214, which is greater than the0.28125 at t=3/4.But we need to check if t=6/7 is within the valid range for the integral.Since t=6/7≈0.8571, which is in [3/4,1.5], and the upper limit for the second integral is1.5, which is valid.Therefore, the maximum area is9/28≈0.3214.But let&#39;s confirm this.At t=6/7≈0.8571:3-2t=3 -12/7=9/7≈1.2857Which is less than1.5, so the integrals are split atx=9/7≈1.2857.Compute the first integral fromx=6/7≈0.8571 tox=9/7≈1.2857 of (-x +12/7)dx:Integrate (-x +12/7)dx:= [ -0.5x² + (12/7)x ] from6/7 to9/7At9/7:-0.5*(81/49) + (12/7)*(9/7)= -40.5/49 +108/49=67.5/49≈1.3776At6/7:-0.5*(36/49) + (12/7)*(6/7)= -18/49 +72/49=54/49≈1.1020Difference≈1.3776 -1.1020≈0.2756Second integral fromx=9/7 tox=1.5 of (-2x +3)dx:Integral= [ -x² +3x ] from9/7 to1.5At1.5:-2.25 +4.5=2.25At9/7:- (81/49) + (27/7)= -81/49 +189/49=108/49≈2.2041Difference=2.25 -108/49≈2.25 -2.2041≈0.0459Total area≈0.2756 +0.0459≈0.3215, which is approximately9/28 (since9/28≈0.3214), so correct.Therefore, the maximum coincident area is9/28, which occurs att=6/7.But wait, the problem states the triangle has sides3/2, sqrt(5)/2, sqrt(2). Wait, but in our coordinate system, the triangle with vertices at(0,0), (1.5,0), (1,1) has sides:AB=1.5, AC= sqrt( (1)^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(2), BC= sqrt( (0.5)^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(1.25)=sqrt(5)/2. So yes, this matches.Therefore, the maximum coincident area when folding alongx=6/7 is9/28.But wait,9/28 is equal to0.3214..., but the total area of the triangle is0.5*1.5*1=0.75, so9/28≈0.3214 is about42.86% of the total area.Is this the maximum?Yes, because we derived that the area function for t in [3/4,1.5] is A(t)= -3.5t² +6t -2.25, which has its maximum att=6/7 with A=9/28.But wait, let&#39;s check if t=6/7 is within the folding line&#39;s possible range. Since AB is1.5 units long, t can be from0 to1.5, and6/7≈0.8571 is within this range.Therefore, the maximum coincident area is9/28.But let&#39;s convert9/28 to have a denominator with the given sides. However, the answer should be in a box as boxed{dfrac{9}{28}}.But wait, let&#39;s verify once more.The maximum area occurs att=6/7, with the coincident area of9/28.Alternatively, we can write9/28 as simplifies fraction, but it&#39;s already in simplest form.Therefore, the final answer isboxed{dfrac{9}{28}}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the maximum coincident area when folding a triangle with sides (frac{3}{2}), (frac{sqrt{5}}{2}), and (sqrt{2}) along a variable line perpendicular to the side of length (frac{3}{2}), we start by placing the triangle in a coordinate system. The vertices are (A(0,0)), (Bleft(frac{3}{2}, 0right)), and (C(1,1)).The folding line is vertical, given by (x = t), where (t) ranges from 0 to (frac{3}{2}). When folding along this line, the left part of the triangle (to the left of (x = t)) is reflected over to the right side. The coincident area is the overlapping region between the original triangle and the reflected part.Key steps:1. Reflection of point (C): The reflection of (C(1,1)) over (x = t) is (C&#39;(2t - 1, 1)).2. Intersection analysis: The reflected triangle&#39;s edges intersect with the original triangle&#39;s edges. The equations of the edges are derived and their intersections are calculated.3. Area calculation: The area of the overlapping region is computed by integrating the appropriate functions over the interval where they overlap.After detailed analysis and calculus, it is found that the maximum coincident area occurs at (t = frac{6}{7}). The area is calculated by integrating the overlapping regions and results in the maximum area being (frac{9}{28}).[boxed{dfrac{9}{28}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9ea064b2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9ea064b2><span class="icon" data-v-9ea064b2>🔑:</span>1. Identify the vertices and sides of the triangle:   Let the vertices of the triangle be ( A, B, ) and ( C ) such that:   [   |AB| = frac{3}{2}, quad |AC| = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, quad |BC| = sqrt{2}   ]2. Calculate the area of the original triangle:   Using Heron&#39;s formula, we first find the semi-perimeter ( s ):   [   s = frac{1}{2} left( frac{3}{2} + frac{sqrt{5}}{2} + sqrt{2} right) = frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4}   ]   The area ( Delta ) of the triangle is given by:   [   Delta = sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}   ]   where ( a = frac{3}{2}, b = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, c = sqrt{2} ). Substituting these values, we get:   [   Delta = sqrt{left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} right) left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} - frac{3}{2} right) left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} - frac{sqrt{5}}{2} right) left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} - sqrt{2} right)}   ]   Simplifying the terms inside the square root, we find:   [   Delta = frac{1}{4}   ]3. Determine the height of the triangle relative to the base ( AB ):   The height ( h ) from vertex ( C ) to the base ( AB ) can be calculated using the area formula:   [   Delta = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} implies frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2} times frac{3}{2} times h implies h = 1   ]4. Analyze the folding process:   When the triangle is folded along a line perpendicular to ( AB ), the coincident area ( S ) changes. Initially, when the folding line passes through vertex ( C ), the coincident area ( S_0 ) is:   [   S_0 = frac{1}{4}   ]5. Displace the folding line by ( x ) towards vertex ( B ):   As the folding line is displaced by ( x ), the coincident area ( S ) is affected by the areas of the trapezoid and the right triangle formed. The coincident area ( S ) can be expressed as:   [   S = frac{1}{4} + x - frac{x^2}{2} - 3x^2   ]6. Find the maximum value of ( S ):   To find the maximum value of ( S ), we take the derivative of ( S ) with respect to ( x ) and set it to zero:   [   frac{dS}{dx} = 1 - x - 6x = 1 - 7x = 0 implies x = frac{1}{7}   ]   Substituting ( x = frac{1}{7} ) back into the expression for ( S ):   [   S = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{left( frac{1}{7} right)^2}{2} - 3 left( frac{1}{7} right)^2 = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{1}{98} - frac{3}{49}   ]   Simplifying the terms, we get:   [   S = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{1}{98} - frac{6}{98} = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{7}{98} = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{1}{14} = frac{9}{28}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{9}{28}})</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-726bf6f9 data-v-9ea064b2><div class="review" data-v-9ea064b2><div class="review-title" data-v-9ea064b2><span class="icon" data-v-9ea064b2>❓:</span>underline{text { Gordrin P.K. }}.Between two parallel lines, a circle of radius 1 is placed, touching both lines, and an isosceles triangle, the base of which lies on one of the lines, and the vertex on the other.

The triangle has its base on one line and vertex on the other, and there&#39;s also a circle of radius 1 that touches both lines. The key thing here is that the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, and that point is on the inscribed circle of the triangle. Hmm, let me visualize this.First, since there are two parallel lines, and both the circle and the triangle are between them, the distance between the lines must be at least twice the radius of the circle, right? But the circle has radius 1, so the distance between the lines is 2 units. Wait, but the triangle is also between these lines. The triangle is isosceles with the base on one line and the vertex on the other. So the height of the triangle must be equal to the distance between the lines, which is 2 units. Wait, but the circle is also touching both lines, so its diameter is perpendicular to the lines and equal to the distance between them. Therefore, the distance between the lines is 2*1=2. So the height of the triangle is 2. So the height h of the triangle is 2. That simplifies things a bit.Now, the triangle is isosceles. Let me denote the base as 2a, so the base length is 2a, and the two equal sides are each of length b. The height h is 2, so from the vertex to the base is 2. Then, the area of the triangle is (2a * 2)/2 = 2a. The semi-perimeter s is (2a + 2b)/2 = a + b. The inradius r is given by the formula area/s, so r = 2a / (a + b). That&#39;s the inradius we need to find.But we have another condition here: the circle of radius 1 and the triangle have exactly one common point, which lies on the inscribed circle of the triangle. So the circle is tangent to the triangle at exactly one point, and that point is where the inscribed circle is. Wait, that might mean that the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at the inradius&#39;s point of tangency. Hmm.Wait, let me think. The inscribed circle of the triangle is tangent to all three sides. The other circle (radius 1) is placed between the two lines, touching both, so it&#39;s centered midway between the two lines since the distance is 2. So the center of the radius 1 circle is at 1 unit from each line. The triangle is sitting with its base on the lower line and vertex on the upper line. The inscribed circle of the triangle is inside the triangle, tangent to all three sides. The other circle (radius 1) is also between the two lines, but how is it positioned horizontally? It&#39;s not necessarily centered relative to the triangle, right?But the problem says the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, which is on the inscribed circle of the triangle. So that means the two circles (the inscribed circle and the radius 1 circle) are tangent to each other, and this point of tangency is the only intersection between the triangle and the radius 1 circle. Because the triangle is a polygon, so the circle of radius 1 can only touch it at a single point, which is also on the inscribed circle. So the two circles are tangent, and the triangle is tangent to the radius 1 circle at that point.So perhaps the inscribed circle of the triangle and the given circle of radius 1 are tangent to each other. If that&#39;s the case, then the distance between their centers is equal to the sum or difference of their radii. Since they are tangent and one is inside the other? Wait, the inscribed circle is inside the triangle, and the other circle is between the two lines. Depending on their positions, maybe they are externally tangent or internally tangent.Wait, but the circle of radius 1 is touching both lines, which are the same lines that the triangle is between. So the circle is centered halfway between the two lines, at (0,1) if we take the lower line as y=0 and upper as y=2. The triangle&#39;s base is on y=0, let&#39;s say from (-a,0) to (a,0), and the vertex at (0,2). Then the inscribed circle of the triangle would be somewhere inside the triangle.But the circle of radius 1 is centered at (h,1), since it&#39;s touching both lines y=0 and y=2. Wait, no—if it&#39;s between two horizontal lines, then the center must be at (h,1), right? But if the lines are vertical, the problem would be different. Wait, the problem says two parallel lines, but it doesn&#39;t specify orientation. Wait, probably they are horizontal, since the circle is placed between them, touching both, which would require vertical distance. The triangle has its base on one line and vertex on the other, so it&#39;s standing vertically. So the two lines are horizontal, separated by 2 units. The circle of radius 1 is between them, so its center is at (h,1), but where horizontally?Wait, but if the lines are horizontal, the circle can be anywhere along the horizontal axis, but it has to touch both lines. So its center is at (h,1). Then, the triangle is an isosceles triangle with base on the lower line (y=0) and vertex at (0,2). So the triangle&#39;s base is from (-a,0) to (a,0), and the vertex at (0,2). Then, the inscribed circle of the triangle is centered at some point (0, r), since the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis. Wait, no, the inradius center (incenter) is located along the altitude, which is the y-axis. The inradius is r = 2a / (a + b), as we had before. The inradius center is at a distance r from each side.But the circle of radius 1 is centered at (h,1). We need this circle to have exactly one common point with the triangle, which is on the inscribed circle. So the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at a point that&#39;s on the inscribed circle. That means the point is both on the triangle&#39;s side, on the inscribed circle, and on the radius 1 circle. So that point is where all three meet: the triangle&#39;s side, the inscribed circle, and the radius 1 circle.Alternatively, maybe the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the inscribed circle of the triangle, and also tangent to one of the sides of the triangle. But the problem states that the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, which is on the inscribed circle. So the circle of radius 1 touches the triangle only at that one point, which is also on the inscribed circle. So perhaps the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the inscribed circle and also tangent to one side of the triangle? But no, if it&#39;s tangent to the inscribed circle and a side, that would be two points of contact. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, if the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the inscribed circle at a point that&#39;s also on the triangle&#39;s side, then that would be a single point of contact. Hmm, that&#39;s possible.Alternatively, maybe the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the inscribed circle and lies entirely outside the triangle except for that tangent point. But since the circle of radius 1 is between the two lines, and the triangle is also between them, maybe the circle is tangent to the inscribed circle from the inside? Wait, the inscribed circle is inside the triangle, so the radius 1 circle would have to be partially inside the triangle? But if they have only one common point, which is on the inscribed circle, that suggests that they are tangent to each other at that point, and the circle of radius 1 does not intersect the triangle anywhere else.Alternatively, perhaps the circle of radius 1 is tangent to one of the sides of the triangle and also tangent to the inscribed circle. But in that case, the circle of radius 1 would have two points of contact: one with the side and one with the inscribed circle. But the problem states exactly one common point. So that can&#39;t be. Therefore, the only possibility is that the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at exactly one point, which is also on the inscribed circle. Therefore, the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at a point where the inscribed circle is tangent to the triangle. So that point is a point where both the inscribed circle and the radius 1 circle are tangent to the triangle.Therefore, that point is a point of tangency for both circles. So the triangle has a side (or vertex) where both circles are tangent. But since the inscribed circle is tangent to all three sides, the circle of radius 1 must be tangent to the triangle at one of these tangent points. So, for example, the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at the point where the inscribed circle is tangent to the base, or to one of the other sides.But if the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at the point where the inscribed circle is tangent to the base, then since the base is on one of the lines (y=0), and the circle of radius 1 is also tangent to that line, their centers are both 1 unit away from the line. Wait, the circle of radius 1 is already tangent to both lines, so its center is at (h,1). The inscribed circle&#39;s center is at (0, r), since the triangle is symmetric. The inscribed circle is tangent to the base at (0,0), right? Wait, no. The inscribed circle of an isosceles triangle is tangent to the base at its midpoint if the triangle is symmetric. Wait, the triangle is isosceles with base from (-a,0) to (a,0), so the midpoint is (0,0). But the inscribed circle is tangent to the base at (0,0). However, the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the base line y=0, so its center is at (h,1). If the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the base at (0,0), then the center would have to be at (0,1). But then, the circle is centered at (0,1) with radius 1, so it touches y=0 at (0,0) and y=2 at (0,2). But the triangle&#39;s vertex is at (0,2). So if the circle is centered at (0,1), it would pass through the vertex of the triangle, which is at (0,2). But the problem says the circle and the triangle have exactly one common point. But in this case, the circle would intersect the triangle at (0,0) and (0,2), which are two points. Therefore, this can&#39;t be the case.Therefore, the circle of radius 1 must be tangent to the triangle at a different point, not on the base or the vertex. So maybe on one of the equal sides.Let me try to set up coordinates. Let&#39;s assume the two parallel lines are y=0 and y=2. The circle of radius 1 is between them, touching both, so its center is at (h,1) for some h. The triangle has its base on y=0 from (-a,0) to (a,0), and vertex at (0,2). The inscribed circle of the triangle is centered at (0, r), where r is the inradius. The inradius formula is r = (base * height) / (perimeter), but wait, no. Wait, area over semi-perimeter. The area is (2a * 2)/2 = 2a. The semi-perimeter is (2a + 2b)/2 = a + b, where b is the length of the equal sides. So r = 2a / (a + b).But we need to relate a and b. Since the triangle has sides of length 2a (the base) and two sides of length b. The height is 2, so using Pythagoras, b = sqrt(a² + 2²) = sqrt(a² + 4). So b = sqrt(a² + 4). Therefore, semi-perimeter s = a + sqrt(a² + 4). Then, r = 2a / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)).Now, the circle of radius 1 is centered at (h,1). The problem states that the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, which is on the inscribed circle. So the point of contact is on both the triangle and the inscribed circle and the circle of radius 1.Therefore, the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at a point where the inscribed circle is tangent to the triangle. The inscribed circle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. So the points of tangency are on the base, and on the two equal sides.If the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at the point where the inscribed circle is tangent to the base, then the circle of radius 1 would have to be tangent at (0,0), but as we saw earlier, this would lead to two intersection points. So that&#39;s not possible.If the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at the point where the inscribed circle is tangent to one of the equal sides, then that point is somewhere along the side. Let&#39;s find that point.The inscribed circle touches the left side of the triangle (from (-a,0) to (0,2)) at some point. Let&#39;s find the coordinates of that point. The incenter is at (0, r). The point of tangency on the left side can be found by moving from the incenter towards the left side. The left side has equation... Let&#39;s find the equation of the left side.The left side goes from (-a,0) to (0,2). The slope is (2 - 0)/(0 - (-a)) = 2/a. So the equation is y = (2/a)(x + a). Similarly, the right side is y = (-2/a)(x - a).The inradius center is at (0, r). The point of tangency on the left side can be found by moving from the incenter in the direction perpendicular to the left side. The left side has slope 2/a, so the perpendicular slope is -a/2. The direction from the incenter to the point of tangency is along this perpendicular slope.So the point of tangency is (0 + t*(-a/2), r + t*(1)), where t is the distance. Wait, the direction vector is (-a, 2) because the slope is -a/2. Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to use parametric equations.Alternatively, the distance from the incenter to the left side is equal to the inradius r. Since the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, so the point of tangency is located at a distance r from the incenter along the perpendicular to the left side.So let&#39;s compute the coordinates. The left side is the line y = (2/a)x + 2. Wait, when x = -a, y=0, and when x=0, y=2. So the equation is y = (2/a)x + 2. Wait, let&#39;s check. At x = -a, y = (2/a)(-a) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. At x=0, y=0 + 2=2. Correct. So equation is y = (2/a)x + 2.The distance from the incenter (0, r) to this line is given by the formula |(2/a)(0) - 1*(r) + 2| / sqrt((2/a)^2 + (-1)^2) = | -r + 2 | / sqrt(4/a² + 1). But this distance is equal to r, the inradius. So:| -r + 2 | / sqrt(4/a² + 1) = rSince r is positive and less than 2 (the height is 2), so | -r + 2 | = 2 - r. Thus:(2 - r) / sqrt(4/a² + 1) = rMultiply both sides by sqrt(4/a² + 1):2 - r = r * sqrt(4/a² + 1)But we also have from earlier that r = 2a / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)). Maybe it&#39;s better to express everything in terms of a and then solve for a. Let me denote b = sqrt(a² + 4), so r = 2a/(a + b). Then, substitute into the equation above.Wait, let&#39;s proceed step by step. Let&#39;s first square both sides of the equation:(2 - r)^2 = r² (4/a² + 1)Expanding the left side:4 - 4r + r² = r² (4/a² + 1)Subtract r² (4/a² + 1) from both sides:4 - 4r + r² - r² (4/a² + 1) = 0Factor out r²:4 - 4r + r² [1 - (4/a² + 1)] = 0Simplify inside the brackets:1 - 4/a² - 1 = -4/a²So:4 - 4r - (4/a²) r² = 0Multiply through by a² to eliminate denominators:4a² - 4r a² - 4r² = 0Divide by 4:a² - r a² - r² = 0But we know from earlier that r = 2a/(a + b), and b = sqrt(a² + 4). Let me substitute r into this equation.So:a² - (2a/(a + b)) a² - (2a/(a + b))² = 0Let me compute each term:First term: a²Second term: - (2a/(a + b)) a² = -2a³/(a + b)Third term: - (4a²)/(a + b)^2So the equation becomes:a² - 2a³/(a + b) - 4a²/(a + b)^2 = 0Multiply all terms by (a + b)^2 to eliminate denominators:a²(a + b)^2 - 2a³(a + b) - 4a² = 0Factor out a²:a² [ (a + b)^2 - 2a(a + b) - 4 ] = 0Since a ≠ 0, we have:(a + b)^2 - 2a(a + b) - 4 = 0Expand (a + b)^2:a² + 2ab + b² - 2a² - 2ab -4 =0Simplify:(a² + 2ab + b²) -2a² -2ab -4 = -a² + b² -4 =0But b² = a² + 4, so substitute:-a² + (a² + 4) -4 = -a² + a² +4 -4=0Which simplifies to 0=0. Hmm, that&#39;s an identity. Which suggests that the equation is always true, given the definitions of r and b. That means there&#39;s no new information here. Hmm, so perhaps this approach isn&#39;t working. Maybe I need a different method.Let&#39;s think differently. The circle of radius 1 is tangent to both lines y=0 and y=2, so its center is at (h,1). The triangle is between these lines, with base on y=0 and vertex at (0,2). The inscribed circle of the triangle is centered at (0, r), radius r. The circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at exactly one point, which is on the inscribed circle.Therefore, the circle of radius 1 and the inscribed circle must be tangent to each other at that common point. Because the point is on both circles, so the distance between their centers is equal to the sum or difference of their radii. Since the inscribed circle is inside the triangle and the other circle is between the lines, depending on their positions, it could be externally tangent or internally tangent.But since the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle only at that point, and the inscribed circle is entirely inside the triangle, the circle of radius 1 must be externally tangent to the inscribed circle. Therefore, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii: sqrt((h - 0)^2 + (1 - r)^2) = r + 1.But also, the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at that point. The point of tangency lies on the side of the triangle and on both circles. So the point (x, y) lies on the side of the triangle, on the inscribed circle, and on the circle of radius 1.Let me parametrize the point of tangency. Let&#39;s assume the point is on one of the equal sides of the triangle, not on the base or the vertex. Let&#39;s denote the triangle with base from (-a,0) to (a,0) and vertex at (0,2). The left side has equation y = (2/a)x + 2. Wait, earlier we had y = (2/a)x + 2 when x is from -a to 0. Wait, when x = -a, y = (2/a)(-a) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0, correct. At x=0, y=2, correct. So the left side is y = (2/a)x + 2.The inscribed circle is centered at (0, r) with radius r. The point of tangency on the left side is at a distance r from the center (0, r) along the line perpendicular to the left side. The slope of the left side is 2/a, so the slope of the perpendicular is -a/2. Therefore, the direction vector from the center to the point of tangency is proportional to (-2, a). Wait, because the slope is -a/2, so rise over run is -a/2, which corresponds to a direction vector of (2, -a). Wait, no, slope is dy/dx = -a/2, so for a run of 2, the rise is -a. So direction vector is (2, -a). But normalized.But the distance from the center (0, r) to the point of tangency is r. So the coordinates of the point of tangency are (0 + 2t, r - a t), where t is chosen such that sqrt((2t)^2 + (-a t)^2) = r. So sqrt(4t² + a² t²) = r =&gt; t sqrt(4 + a²) = r =&gt; t = r / sqrt(4 + a²). Therefore, the point of tangency is:x = 2t = 2r / sqrt(4 + a²)y = r - a t = r - (a r)/sqrt(4 + a²) = r [1 - a / sqrt(4 + a²)]This point (x, y) must lie on the left side of the triangle, whose equation is y = (2/a)x + 2. Let&#39;s verify that:Substitute x into the equation:y = (2/a)(2r / sqrt(4 + a²)) + 2 = (4r)/(a sqrt(4 + a²)) + 2But from the y-coordinate of the point of tangency:y = r [1 - a / sqrt(4 + a²)] = r - (a r)/sqrt(4 + a²)Therefore, equate the two expressions for y:r - (a r)/sqrt(4 + a²) = (4r)/(a sqrt(4 + a²)) + 2Let me rearrange:r - (a r)/sqrt(4 + a²) - (4r)/(a sqrt(4 + a²)) - 2 = 0Factor out r:r [1 - a/sqrt(4 + a²) - 4/(a sqrt(4 + a²))] - 2 = 0Combine the terms inside the brackets:1 - [a + 4/a]/sqrt(4 + a²)So:r [1 - (a + 4/a)/sqrt(4 + a²)] - 2 = 0This seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Alternatively, since the point of tangency is on both the inscribed circle and the circle of radius 1, let&#39;s write the equations for both circles and set them equal at that point.The inscribed circle is centered at (0, r) with radius r, so equation: x² + (y - r)^2 = r².The circle of radius 1 is centered at (h,1) with radius 1, so equation: (x - h)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 1.The point of tangency (x, y) lies on both circles and on the side of the triangle. So we have three equations:1. x² + (y - r)^2 = r²2. (x - h)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 13. y = (2/a)x + 2 (equation of the left side)We need to solve these equations simultaneously. Let&#39;s substitute equation 3 into equations 1 and 2.From equation 3: y = (2/a)x + 2. Substitute into equation 1:x² + [(2/a x + 2) - r]^2 = r²Expand the second term:(2/a x + 2 - r)^2 = (2/a x + (2 - r))^2 = (2/a x)^2 + 2*(2/a x)*(2 - r) + (2 - r)^2So equation 1 becomes:x² + (4/a²)x² + (8/a)(2 - r)x + (2 - r)^2 = r²Combine like terms:x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(8/a)(2 - r) + (2 - r)^2 - r² = 0Simplify the constant term:(2 - r)^2 - r² = 4 - 4r + r² - r² = 4 - 4rSo equation 1 becomes:x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(8/a)(2 - r) + (4 - 4r) = 0Similarly, substitute y = (2/a)x + 2 into equation 2:(x - h)^2 + [(2/a x + 2) - 1]^2 = 1Simplify:(x - h)^2 + (2/a x + 1)^2 = 1Expand both terms:x² - 2hx + h² + (4/a²)x² + (4/a)x + 1 = 1Combine like terms:x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(-2h + 4/a) + (h² + 1) = 1Simplify the constant term:h² + 1 - 1 = h²So equation 2 becomes:x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(-2h + 4/a) + h² = 0Now, we have two equations:1. x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(8/a)(2 - r) + (4 - 4r) = 02. x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(-2h + 4/a) + h² = 0Since both equations equal zero, set them equal to each other:x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(8/a)(2 - r) + (4 - 4r) = x² (1 + 4/a²) + x*(-2h + 4/a) + h²Cancel out the x² terms:x*(8/a)(2 - r) + (4 - 4r) = x*(-2h + 4/a) + h²Bring all terms to one side:x*(8/a)(2 - r) + (4 - 4r) - x*(-2h + 4/a) - h² = 0Factor x terms:x[ (8/a)(2 - r) + 2h - 4/a ] + (4 - 4r - h²) = 0Simplify the coefficient of x:(8/a)(2 - r) - 4/a + 2h = (16/a - 8r/a - 4/a) + 2h = (12/a - 8r/a) + 2h = (12 - 8r)/a + 2hSo the equation becomes:x*( (12 - 8r)/a + 2h ) + (4 - 4r - h²) = 0Since this equation must hold for the x-coordinate of the point of tangency, which is a specific value, the coefficients must be zero only if the equation is satisfied for that x. However, since the point of tangency is unique, the system has exactly one solution, which implies that the two circles are tangent, so their equations have exactly one common solution. Therefore, the quadratic equations obtained by substituting y into the circles&#39; equations must have exactly one solution. Therefore, their discriminant must be zero.But this seems too complex. Maybe another approach is needed.Let me recall that the circle of radius 1 and the triangle have exactly one common point, which is on the inscribed circle. So the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at a point where the inscribed circle is also tangent. That point is on the side of the triangle.Therefore, the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at that point, and also tangent to both parallel lines. Wait, but the circle of radius 1 is already tangent to both lines by construction. So its center is at (h,1), and it is tangent to the triangle at one point on the inscribed circle.Therefore, the circle of radius 1 must be tangent to the triangle&#39;s side at the point where the inscribed circle is tangent to that side. So that point is the point of tangency for both circles.Therefore, the point where the inscribed circle is tangent to the side of the triangle is also the point where the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle. So in addition to that, the circle of radius 1 is centered at (h,1), and must pass through that tangency point with radius 1, and also be tangent to the two lines y=0 and y=2.Given that, let&#39;s find the coordinates of the tangency point on the side.Earlier, we found that the tangency point on the left side is at (2r / sqrt(4 + a²), r [1 - a / sqrt(4 + a²)] ). Let&#39;s denote this point as (x_t, y_t).This point must lie on the circle of radius 1 centered at (h,1). Therefore:(x_t - h)^2 + (y_t - 1)^2 = 1Also, since the circle of radius 1 is tangent to both lines y=0 and y=2, its center is at (h,1). So that&#39;s already satisfied.Additionally, since the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at (x_t, y_t), the line from the center of the circle (h,1) to the point (x_t, y_t) must be perpendicular to the side of the triangle at that point.The side of the triangle at (x_t, y_t) has slope 2/a, so the perpendicular slope is -a/2. Therefore, the line from (h,1) to (x_t, y_t) must have slope -a/2.Therefore, (y_t - 1)/(x_t - h) = -a/2So we have two equations:1. (x_t - h)^2 + (y_t - 1)^2 = 12. (y_t - 1)/(x_t - h) = -a/2From equation 2: (y_t - 1) = -a/2 (x_t - h)Substitute into equation 1:(x_t - h)^2 + [ -a/2 (x_t - h) ]^2 = 1Factor out (x_t - h)^2:(x_t - h)^2 [1 + (a²)/4] = 1Therefore,(x_t - h)^2 = 1 / [1 + (a²)/4] = 4 / (4 + a²)Therefore, x_t - h = ±2 / sqrt(4 + a²)But since the tangency point is on the left side of the triangle, which is on the left half (x &lt; 0), and the circle of radius 1 is between the lines, h could be positive or negative. Wait, but the triangle is symmetric, so perhaps we can assume h is positive, and the tangency point is on the right side? Wait, but the problem states &quot;exactly one common point&quot;, so it could be on either side, but due to symmetry, it&#39;s sufficient to consider one side.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. The tangency point on the inscribed circle is on one of the sides. If the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at that point, which is on the left or right side, but due to the triangle&#39;s symmetry, it&#39;s sufficient to consider one side, say the right side. Wait, but the earlier calculation was for the left side. Let&#39;s redo that for the right side.The right side of the triangle has equation y = (-2/a)x + 2. The incenter is at (0, r). The point of tangency on the right side is symmetric to the left side, so coordinates ( -2r / sqrt(4 + a²), r [1 - a / sqrt(4 + a²)] ), but since it&#39;s the right side, x would be positive. Wait, no. Wait, the direction vector for the right side&#39;s perpendicular would be ( -2, -a ), leading to x = -2t, y = r - (-a)t = r + a t. Wait, perhaps I need to recalculate.Wait, the right side has slope -2/a, so the perpendicular slope is a/2. Therefore, the direction from the incenter (0, r) to the point of tangency on the right side is along (2, a). So parametrized as (0 + 2t, r + a t). The distance from (0, r) to (2t, r + a t) is sqrt( (2t)^2 + (a t)^2 ) = t sqrt(4 + a² ) = r. Therefore, t = r / sqrt(4 + a² ). Therefore, the point of tangency on the right side is:x = 2t = 2r / sqrt(4 + a² )y = r + a t = r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² )This point is on the right side of the triangle, which has equation y = (-2/a)x + 2. Let&#39;s verify:Substitute x into the equation:y = (-2/a)(2r / sqrt(4 + a² )) + 2 = (-4r)/(a sqrt(4 + a² )) + 2But from the point of tangency:y = r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² )Set equal:r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) = (-4r)/(a sqrt(4 + a² )) + 2Multiply both sides by sqrt(4 + a² ) to eliminate denominators:r sqrt(4 + a² ) + a r = (-4r)/a + 2 sqrt(4 + a² )Bring all terms to the left side:r sqrt(4 + a² ) + a r + (4r)/a - 2 sqrt(4 + a² ) = 0Factor terms:sqrt(4 + a² )(r - 2) + r(a + 4/a) = 0This is similar to the earlier equation. Maybe there&#39;s a relationship here.But let&#39;s remember that r = 2a / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)). Let&#39;s substitute this into the equation.First, express sqrt(4 + a² ) as sqrt(a² + 4).So:sqrt(a² + 4)(r - 2) + r(a + 4/a) = 0Substitute r = 2a / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)):sqrt(a² + 4)[ (2a)/(a + sqrt(a² + 4)) - 2 ] + [2a/(a + sqrt(a² + 4))](a + 4/a) = 0Simplify the first term:sqrt(a² + 4)[ (2a - 2(a + sqrt(a² + 4)))/(a + sqrt(a² + 4)) ]= sqrt(a² + 4)[ (2a - 2a - 2 sqrt(a² + 4))/(a + sqrt(a² + 4)) ]= sqrt(a² + 4)[ -2 sqrt(a² + 4) / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)) ]= -2 (a² + 4) / (a + sqrt(a² + 4))Second term:[2a/(a + sqrt(a² + 4))](a + 4/a) = [2a(a + 4/a)] / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)) = [2a² + 8] / (a + sqrt(a² + 4))Therefore, combining both terms:[ -2(a² + 4) + 2a² + 8 ] / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)) = [ -2a² -8 + 2a² +8 ] / (a + sqrt(a² + 4)) = 0 / ... = 0Again, this results in 0=0, which is an identity. So this approach isn&#39;t yielding new information. It seems the equations are dependent given the expression for r, which suggests that perhaps the tangency condition is automatically satisfied given the inradius formula. Therefore, we need to use another condition: the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at that point.So let&#39;s return to the circle of radius 1 centered at (h,1). The point of tangency on the triangle is (x_t, y_t) = (2r / sqrt(4 + a² ), r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² )). This point lies on the circle of radius 1:( x_t - h )^2 + ( y_t - 1 )^2 = 1Also, the line from (h,1) to (x_t, y_t) must be perpendicular to the side of the triangle at that point. The slope of the side is -2/a, so the slope of the perpendicular is a/2. Therefore:( y_t - 1 ) / ( x_t - h ) = a/2So:y_t - 1 = (a/2)(x_t - h )But y_t = r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² )Therefore:r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) - 1 = (a/2)(2r / sqrt(4 + a² ) - h )Simplify left side:r [1 + a / sqrt(4 + a² ) ] - 1Right side:(a/2)(2r / sqrt(4 + a² ) - h ) = (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) - (a h)/2Thus:r [1 + a / sqrt(4 + a² ) ] - 1 = (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) - (a h)/2Simplify the left side:r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) - 1Therefore:r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) -1 = (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) - (a h)/2Cancel terms:r -1 = - (a h)/2Therefore:(a h)/2 = 1 - rThus:h = 2(1 - r)/aSo we have h expressed in terms of a and r.Now, substitute h into the equation of the circle:( x_t - h )^2 + ( y_t - 1 )^2 = 1Recall x_t = 2r / sqrt(4 + a² )y_t = r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² )So:( 2r / sqrt(4 + a² ) - h )^2 + ( r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) - 1 )^2 = 1Substitute h = 2(1 - r)/a:= [ 2r / sqrt(4 + a² ) - 2(1 - r)/a ]^2 + [ r + (a r)/sqrt(4 + a² ) - 1 ]^2 = 1This equation relates a and r. Given that r = 2a/(a + sqrt(a² + 4)), we can substitute that in and solve for a.Let me denote s = sqrt(a² + 4). Then r = 2a / (a + s).Let&#39;s express everything in terms of a and s. First, compute h:h = 2(1 - r)/a = 2/a (1 - 2a/(a + s)) = 2/a [ (a + s - 2a)/ (a + s) ) ] = 2/a [ (s - a)/ (a + s) ) ] = 2(s - a)/(a(a + s))Now, substitute into the first term:2r / sqrt(4 + a² ) - 2(1 - r)/a = 2*(2a/(a + s)) / s - 2*(s - a)/(a(a + s)) )= (4a)/(s(a + s)) - (2(s - a))/(a(a + s)) )Factor out 2/(a(a + s)):= 2/(a(a + s)) [ 2a² - (s - a) ]Wait, no, let&#39;s compute each term:First term: 2r / s = 2*(2a/(a + s)) / s = 4a/(s(a + s))Second term: 2(1 - r)/a = 2*(s - a)/(a(a + s)) as aboveSo subtracting them:4a/(s(a + s)) - 2(s - a)/(a(a + s)) = [4a² - 2s(s - a)] / [a s(a + s)]Wait, let&#39;s get a common denominator:First term: 4a/(s(a + s)) = 4a² / [a s(a + s)]Second term: 2(s - a)/(a(a + s)) = 2s(s - a)/ [a s(a + s)]Thus:[4a² - 2s(s - a)] / [a s(a + s)] = [4a² - 2s² + 2a s] / [a s(a + s)]Factor numerator:= 2[2a² - s² + a s] / [a s(a + s)]But s² = a² +4, so substitute:= 2[2a² - (a² +4) +a s] / [a s(a + s)] = 2[ a² -4 +a s ] / [a s(a + s)]This is getting very complicated. Let&#39;s move to the second term in the circle equation:r + (a r)/s -1 = r(1 + a/s) -1 = (2a/(a + s))(1 + a/s) -1 = [2a/(a + s)]*( (s + a)/s ) -1 = [2a/s] -1So the second term in the equation is [2a/s -1]^2.Now, the entire equation is:[2(2a² - s² +a s)]^2 / [a² s² (a + s)^2 ] + [2a/s -1]^2 =1Wait, this is getting too messy. Maybe we need to substitute numerical values. Alternatively, notice that s = sqrt(a² + 4), so s² = a² +4. Let&#39;s substitute that:First term numerator: 2[ a² -4 + a s ] = 2[ a² -4 +a sqrt(a² +4) ]Denominator: a s (a + s )Second term: [2a/s -1]^2It&#39;s still complicated. Let&#39;s assume a specific value for a and see if it satisfies the equation. Let&#39;s try to guess a.If the inradius r is equal to 1, then from h = 2(1 - r)/a =0. So h=0. The circle of radius 1 is centered at (0,1). Then the point of tangency would be (x_t, y_t). Let&#39;s see if this works.If r=1, then from r = 2a/(a + s) =1 =&gt; 2a = a + s =&gt; s = a =&gt; sqrt(a² +4)=a. But sqrt(a² +4)=a implies a² +4 =a² =&gt; 4=0, which is impossible. Therefore, r cannot be 1.Alternatively, maybe r= something else. Let&#39;s think about possible values.If a is very large, then the base of the triangle is very long, and the triangle becomes very flat. Then the inradius approaches the height divided by 2, which is 1. So r approaches 1 as a increases. If a is very small, approaching 0, then the triangle becomes very narrow, and the inradius approaches 0.But the circle of radius 1 is fixed between the two lines. The problem states that the circle and triangle have exactly one common point, so when a is too large, the circle might intersect the triangle at multiple points. When a is just right, it&#39;s tangent. So likely, the inradius is less than 1.Wait, but the circle of radius 1 is also between the two lines, so if the inradius is smaller than 1, then the inscribed circle is inside the triangle, and the circle of radius 1 could be tangent to it externally.Alternatively, maybe they are tangent internally. Wait, if the inradius is r, and the circle of radius 1 is outside the triangle, then the distance between centers would be r +1. But if the circle of radius 1 is inside the triangle, then the distance would be 1 - r. But in this case, since the circle of radius 1 is between the lines and tangent to them, it&#39;s possible that the circle is outside the triangle. Wait, but the triangle is also between the lines, so maybe part of the circle is inside and part is outside. But the problem states that they have exactly one common point, which is on the inscribed circle. Therefore, they must be tangent to each other at that point.Wait, but the inscribed circle is inside the triangle, and the circle of radius 1 is between the lines. Depending on the position of the triangle, the circle of radius 1 could be tangent to the triangle from the outside. The distance between their centers would then be r +1. Alternatively, if the circle of radius 1 is inside the inscribed circle, but since the inradius is less than the circle&#39;s radius (1), that can&#39;t happen.Wait, the inradius r is less than 1, as when a increases, r approaches 1. So the inscribed circle has radius less than 1. Therefore, the circle of radius 1 is outside the inscribed circle, so they must be externally tangent. Therefore, the distance between centers is r +1.The center of the inscribed circle is at (0, r), and the center of the radius 1 circle is at (h,1). Therefore, the distance between them is sqrt( h² + (1 - r)^2 ) = r +1.So:sqrt( h² + (1 - r)^2 ) = r +1Square both sides:h² + (1 - r)^2 = r² + 2r +1Expand (1 - r)^2:h² +1 -2r + r² = r² +2r +1Simplify:h² -2r = 2rThus:h² =4rTherefore, h = 2 sqrt(r) or h = -2 sqrt(r). But since we considered the tangency point on the right side, h should be positive. So h = 2 sqrt(r).Earlier, we had h = 2(1 - r)/a. Therefore:2 sqrt(r) = 2(1 - r)/aSimplify:sqrt(r) = (1 - r)/aBut we also have from the inradius formula:r = 2a/(a + sqrt(a² +4))Let me express sqrt(a² +4) as s. So s = sqrt(a² +4), and r = 2a/(a + s).From sqrt(r) = (1 - r)/a, substitute r:sqrt(2a/(a + s)) = (1 - 2a/(a + s))/aSimplify the right-hand side:( (a + s) - 2a ) / (a(a + s)) ) = (s - a ) / (a(a + s))Therefore:sqrt(2a/(a + s)) = (s - a ) / (a(a + s))Square both sides:2a/(a + s) = (s - a )² / [a² (a + s)^2 ]Multiply both sides by a² (a + s)^2:2a * a² (a + s) = (s - a )²Simplify left side:2a³ (a + s) = (s - a )²But s² = a² +4, so expand (s - a )² = s² -2a s + a² = (a² +4) -2a s + a² = 2a² +4 -2a sThus:2a³ (a + s) = 2a² +4 -2a sDivide both sides by 2:a³ (a + s) = a² +2 -a sBring all terms to the left:a³ (a + s) -a² +a s -2 =0Expand a³(a + s):a^4 + a³ s -a² +a s -2=0But s = sqrt(a² +4). Let&#39;s substitute s:= a^4 + a³ sqrt(a² +4) -a² +a sqrt(a² +4) -2=0This equation seems very difficult to solve analytically. Maybe we need to make a substitution. Let me set t = sqrt(a² +4). Then t² = a² +4, so a² = t² -4. Also, t = sqrt(a² +4) &gt; a.But substituting t into the equation:a^4 + a³ t -a² +a t -2=0But a^4 = (t² -4)^2 = t^4 -8t² +16a³ t = a * a² * t = a(t² -4)tSimilarly, a² = t² -4a t = a tSo substitute:t^4 -8t² +16 + a(t² -4)t - (t² -4) +a t -2 =0But a = sqrt(t² -4 -4)? Wait, no, from t = sqrt(a² +4), we have a = sqrt(t² -4). So a = sqrt(t² -4). Let&#39;s express all terms in t.a = sqrt(t² -4)So:t^4 -8t² +16 + sqrt(t² -4)(t² -4)t - (t² -4) + sqrt(t² -4) t -2 =0This is even more complex. Maybe another substitution. Let me assume that t is a multiple of a or something else. Alternatively, try specific values of a.Let me try a =1. Then s = sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). Then r = 2*1/(1 + sqrt(5)) ≈ 2/(3.236)≈0.618. Then h=2 sqrt(0.618)≈2*0.786≈1.572. Also, from h=2(1 - r)/a=2*(1 -0.618)/1=0.764. But these two expressions for h are not equal. So a=1 is not a solution.Let me try a=2. Then s=sqrt(4 +4)=sqrt(8)=2√2. r=2*2/(2 +2√2)=4/(2(1 +√2))=2/(1 +√2)=√2 -1≈1.414-1≈0.414. Then h=2 sqrt(0.414)≈2*0.643≈1.286. From h=2(1 - r)/a=2*(1 -0.414)/2= (1 -0.414)=0.586. Not equal. Not a solution.Try a= sqrt(2). Then s=sqrt(2 +4)=sqrt(6). r=2*sqrt(2)/(sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))=2sqrt(2)/(sqrt(2)(1 + sqrt(3)))=2/(1 + sqrt(3))≈2/2.732≈0.732. Then h=2*sqrt(0.732)≈2*0.855≈1.710. From h=2(1 - r)/a=2*(1 -0.732)/sqrt(2)=2*0.268/1.414≈0.379. Not equal.Try a=0.5. Then s=sqrt(0.25 +4)=sqrt(4.25)=~2.0616. r=2*0.5/(0.5 +2.0616)=1/2.5616≈0.390. h=2 sqrt(0.390)=2*0.624≈1.248. From h=2(1 -0.390)/0.5=2*0.610/0.5=2.44. Not equal.This trial and error isn&#39;t working. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Let me recall that we have two expressions:1. h = 2 sqrt(r)2. h = 2(1 - r)/aAnd we also have:r = 2a/(a + sqrt(a² +4))Let me express a in terms of r. From r = 2a/(a + s), where s = sqrt(a² +4):r(a + s) = 2ara + r s = 2ar s = 2a - ras = (2a - ra)/r = a(2 - r)/rBut s = sqrt(a² +4), so:sqrt(a² +4) = a(2 - r)/rSquare both sides:a² +4 = a² (2 - r)^2 / r²Multiply both sides by r²:a² r² +4 r² = a² (2 - r)^2Expand right side:a² (4 -4r + r²)Bring all terms to left:a² r² +4 r² -4 a² +4a² r -a² r² =0Simplify:( a² r² -a² r² ) +4 r² -4 a² +4a² r =0So:4 r² -4 a² +4a² r =0Divide by 4:r² -a² +a² r =0Factor:a² ( r -1 ) + r² =0So:a² = r² / (1 - r )From this, we can express a in terms of r:a = r / sqrt(1 - r )Now, substitute this into the expression for h:From h =2 sqrt(r )Also, from h =2(1 - r )/a = 2(1 - r ) / [ r / sqrt(1 - r ) ] = 2(1 - r ) sqrt(1 - r ) / r = 2 (1 - r )^(3/2)/ rBut we also have h=2 sqrt(r )Therefore:2 sqrt(r ) = 2 (1 - r )^(3/2)/ rDivide both sides by 2:sqrt(r ) = (1 - r )^(3/2)/ rMultiply both sides by r:r sqrt(r ) = (1 - r )^(3/2)Square both sides:r^3 = (1 - r )^3Take cube roots:r =1 - rThus:2r =1 =&gt; r=1/2Therefore, the inradius r is 1/2.Let me verify this solution.If r=1/2, then from a² = r² / (1 - r ) = (1/4)/ (1 -1/2 )= (1/4)/ (1/2 )=1/2. So a=1/√2.Check if this satisfies the earlier equations.From a=1/√2, s=sqrt(a² +4)=sqrt(1/2 +4)=sqrt(9/2)=3/√2.Then r=2a/(a +s)=2*(1/√2)/(1/√2 +3/√2)=2*(1/√2)/(4/√2)=2*(1/4)=1/2. Correct.From h=2 sqrt(r )=2*sqrt(1/2)=2*(√2/2)=√2.From h=2(1 -r )/a=2*(1 -1/2 )/(1/√2)=2*(1/2 )*√2=√2. Correct.Therefore, the inradius is indeed 1/2.Final AnswerThe radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle is boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a circle of radius 1 placed between two parallel lines, touching both lines, and an isosceles triangle with its base on one line and vertex on the other, we need to find the radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle. The triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, which lies on the inscribed circle of the triangle.1. Distance between the lines: The circle of radius 1 touches both lines, so the distance between the lines is 2 units.2. Height of the triangle: The height of the isosceles triangle is equal to the distance between the lines, which is 2 units.3. Inradius formula: For an isosceles triangle with base (2a), equal sides (b), and height 2, the inradius (r) is given by (r = frac{2a}{a + b}) where (b = sqrt{a^2 + 4}).4. Tangency condition: The circle of radius 1 and the triangle have exactly one common point, which is on the inscribed circle. This implies the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the triangle at a point where the inscribed circle is tangent to the triangle.5. Distance between centers: The distance between the centers of the inscribed circle (radius (r)) and the circle of radius 1 is (r + 1). The center of the inscribed circle is ((0, r)) and the center of the circle of radius 1 is ((h, 1)). This distance is given by (sqrt{h^2 + (1 - r)^2} = r + 1).6. Solving for (h): Using the relationship (h = frac{2(1 - r)}{a}) and substituting into the distance equation, we find (h = 2sqrt{r}).7. Substituting (a): Expressing (a) in terms of (r) using the inradius formula and solving, we find (a = frac{r}{sqrt{1 - r}}).8. Verification: Solving the equations, we find (r = frac{1}{2}).The radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two parallel lines with a circle of radius 1 placed between them, touching both lines. Then there&#39;s an isosceles triangle with its base on one line and the vertex on the other. The key points are that the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, which lies on the inscribed circle of the triangle. We need to find the radius of this inscribed circle.First, I should visualize the setup. Two parallel lines, let&#39;s say horizontal for simplicity. The circle is sandwiched between them, touching both, so the distance between the lines must be twice the radius, which is 2*1=2 units. Wait, but the triangle is also between these lines, so the height of the triangle must also be 2 units? Because the base is on one line and the vertex on the other. So the height (altitude) of the isosceles triangle is 2. That seems important.Since it&#39;s an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are the legs connecting the base to the vertex. Let me denote the base as length &#39;b&#39; and the equal sides as length &#39;s&#39;. The height is 2, so by Pythagoras, the equal sides can be found in terms of the base. The height splits the triangle into two right triangles, each with base b/2, height 2, and hypotenuse s. So, s = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + 2^2 ) = sqrt( (b²)/4 + 4 ). The inradius of a triangle is given by the formula r = A / s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. Wait, actually, inradius r = A / s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. Let me confirm that. Yes, the formula for the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. So, in this case, the semiperimeter would be (b + 2s)/2 = (b + 2s)/2. The area of the triangle is (base * height)/2 = (b * 2)/2 = b. So, r = b / [ (b + 2s)/2 ] = 2b / (b + 2s ). But we need to find r, so I need to express this in terms of known quantities or find relationships that can let me solve for r. But we also have the condition that the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, which is on the inscribed circle of the triangle. Hmm. So the circle of radius 1 is tangent to both lines, and the triangle is also between the same lines. The circle and the triangle are tangent to each other at exactly one point, which is on the incircle of the triangle. Wait, does that mean that the circle is tangent to the incircle of the triangle? Because the common point is on the incircle. So the circle is tangent to the incircle? And since there&#39;s exactly one common point, that must be the point of tangency. Therefore, the circle of radius 1 is tangent to the incircle of the triangle. Also, since the circle is between the two lines, which are 2 units apart, and the incircle is also between the same lines. So, the centers of both circles lie along the line midway between the two parallel lines? Wait, no. The original circle is tangent to both lines, so its center is exactly halfway, 1 unit from each line. The incircle of the triangle, however, is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. For an isosceles triangle with base on the lower line and vertex on the upper line, the inradius center (incenter) is located along the altitude (since it&#39;s equidistant from all sides). So the inradius is at a distance r from each side. Wait, but the inradius is the radius of the incircle. So the inradius center is r units above the base (the lower line) and (2 - r) units below the upper line, since the total distance between the lines is 2.But the original circle of radius 1 has its center at 1 unit from each line. So the center is at the midpoint. The inradius center is at r units from the lower line. So the distance between the centers of the two circles is (1 - r) units, since the original circle is at 1 unit above the lower line, and the inradius center is at r units above. If the circles are tangent to each other, then the distance between centers should be equal to the sum or difference of their radii. Since they are tangent and only have one common point. Now, since the original circle is radius 1 and the incircle is radius r. If they are externally tangent, the distance between centers is 1 + r. If one is inside the other and tangent, the distance is |1 - r|.But in this case, the original circle is fixed between the two lines, centered midway. The incircle of the triangle is also between the lines. Depending on the size of the inradius, the incircle could be smaller or larger than the original circle. Wait, but the original circle has radius 1, and the inradius is something we need to find. Let&#39;s suppose that the incircle is larger or smaller. Let&#39;s see.But the problem states that the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point, which lies on the inscribed circle of the triangle. So, the circle (radius 1) touches the triangle at exactly one point, which is on the incircle. Therefore, the circle is tangent to the triangle at a single point, and that point is also on the incircle. So, this implies that the original circle and the incircle are tangent to each other at that point, which is also the point where the original circle touches the triangle. Therefore, the original circle is tangent to the incircle and tangent to the triangle at the same point. Therefore, the two circles (radius 1 and radius r) are tangent, and the point of tangency is also the point where the original circle touches the triangle. Therefore, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum or difference of their radii.But we need to determine whether the original circle is inside the incircle or outside. Given that the original circle is of radius 1 and is between the two lines, and the incircle is also between the two lines. The inradius center is at a distance r from the lower line, so the center is at (0, r) if we take the lower line as the x-axis. The original circle is at (0, 1). So the vertical distance between centers is |1 - r|. The horizontal distance? Wait, the original circle is placed between the two lines, but where exactly? If the triangle is isosceles, then the original circle must be placed such that it&#39;s tangent to the triangle at one point. But since the triangle is symmetric, the original circle is probably placed along the altitude of the triangle. So the centers of both circles lie along the altitude. Therefore, the horizontal distance between centers is zero, and the vertical distance is |1 - r|. Therefore, the distance between centers is |1 - r|, which must equal the sum or difference of radii, depending on whether they are externally or internally tangent.But if the incircle is entirely inside the original circle or vice versa. Since the original circle is radius 1 and centered at (0,1), and the inradius is r, centered at (0, r). If r &lt; 1, then the inradius is below the original circle, and the distance between centers is 1 - r. If the original circle is outside the incircle, then the distance between centers is 1 - r, which would equal 1 + r if they are externally tangent. Wait, but 1 - r = 1 + r implies r=0, which is not possible. Alternatively, if the incircle is inside the original circle and they are tangent, then the distance between centers is 1 - r = 1 - r, which is trivial. Wait, no. If the incircle is inside the original circle, then the distance between centers plus the inradius equals the original radius. So |1 - r| + r = 1. But |1 - r| + r = 1. If r &lt;=1, then |1 - r| = 1 - r, so (1 - r) + r = 1, which is always true. That just means that the circles are tangent if the inradius is exactly 1. Wait, that doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, maybe I need to think again. If the two circles are tangent, the distance between centers is equal to the sum or difference of their radii. If they are externally tangent, distance is 1 + r. If internally tangent, distance is |1 - r|. But in our case, the centers are along the same vertical line, so the distance between centers is |1 - r|. So, for them to be tangent, either:1. Externally tangent: |1 - r| = 1 + r. But solving this, if 1 - r = 1 + r, then -r = r =&gt; r=0. Not possible. If r -1 =1 + r, then -1=1, which is impossible.2. Internally tangent: |1 - r| = |1 - r|. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, no. If one circle is inside the other, then the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii. So if the original circle (radius 1) is outside the incircle (radius r), then the distance between centers should be 1 - r. But the distance between centers is |1 - r|. So, if 1 - r = 1 - r, which is always true, but that just means that if the incircle is entirely inside the original circle, the distance between centers is 1 - r, which is equal to the difference of radii. Therefore, they are tangent if 1 - r = 1 - r, which is always true. Wait, that&#39;s not right. Wait, if the incircle is entirely inside the original circle, then the minimal distance between centers is 1 - r. But for them to be tangent, the distance between centers must equal 1 - r. So, yes, if the incircle is inside the original circle, the distance between centers is 1 - r, which is exactly the condition for tangency. But in this case, the incircle is inside the original circle, so the original circle has radius 1, the incircle has radius r &lt;1, and their centers are 1 - r apart. Therefore, the incircle is tangent to the original circle. But in that case, since the incircle is inside the original circle, they can only be tangent if the incircle touches the original circle at one point. But in the problem, the triangle and the original circle have exactly one common point, which is on the incircle. So, the original circle is tangent to the triangle at a point that&#39;s on the incircle, and also tangent to the incircle. Therefore, the original circle is tangent to both the triangle and the incircle at the same point. Therefore, the point where the original circle touches the triangle is the same point where it touches the incircle. Therefore, the original circle and the incircle are tangent at that point, and the original circle is also tangent to the triangle there.Therefore, the distance between centers is 1 - r (since it&#39;s the vertical distance between centers at (0,1) and (0,r)), which must equal 1 - r. Wait, that&#39;s not helpful. But since they are tangent, the distance between centers should equal the sum or difference of radii. Since the original circle is larger (assuming r &lt;1), the distance between centers is 1 - r, which is equal to 1 - r. So this is always true, but we need more conditions.Wait, perhaps I&#39;m approaching this wrong. Let&#39;s think about the geometry again. The original circle is tangent to both lines, so its center is midway between the lines. The triangle has its base on the lower line and vertex on the upper line. The incircle of the triangle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle, so its center is located at a distance r from each side. Therefore, the inradius center is at (0, r) if we take the base on the x-axis. The original circle is at (0,1) with radius 1, so it touches the upper line at y=2 and the lower line at y=0. The inradius touches the base at y=0 and the other two sides. The original circle is tangent to the triangle at exactly one point, which is on the incircle. So, the original circle and the triangle share a single common point, which is also on the incircle.Therefore, the original circle is tangent to the triangle at a point where the incircle is also tangent to the triangle. But the incircle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle, so the original circle must be tangent to one of the sides of the triangle at the same point where the incircle is tangent to that side. Wait, but the incircle is tangent to the sides at three different points. The original circle is tangent to the triangle at one point, which is one of these three points. Since the triangle is between the two lines, and the original circle is tangent to both lines, the original circle is likely tangent to one of the legs of the triangle (the equal sides) because the base is on the lower line, which the original circle is already tangent to. Wait, but the original circle is tangent to the lower line, which is the base of the triangle, but the problem says that the triangle and the circle have exactly one common point. If the base is on the lower line, which the circle is tangent to, then the circle and the triangle would share that tangent point on the base. But the problem states they have exactly one common point, which is on the incircle. Therefore, the circle must not be tangent to the base, which contradicts the initial setup. Wait, maybe the circle is not tangent to the base. Wait, the problem says a circle of radius 1 is placed between two parallel lines, touching both lines. So the circle is tangent to both lines. The triangle has its base on one line and vertex on the other. Therefore, the base of the triangle is on one line, which the circle is already tangent to. Therefore, the circle and the triangle would share the tangent point on the base. But the problem states they have exactly one common point, which is on the incircle. Therefore, that can&#39;t be. Therefore, the circle is not tangent to the base of the triangle. That suggests that the circle is placed in such a way that it doesn&#39;t touch the base, but only touches one of the legs. But the circle is tangent to both lines, so if the base is on one line, then the circle is tangent to that line. Therefore, the circle must be tangent to the base, but the problem says that the circle and the triangle have exactly one common point. Therefore, this is a contradiction unless the circle is tangent to the triangle not at the base, but somewhere else. But the circle is tangent to both lines, so it&#39;s tangent to the base line. The triangle has its base on the base line. Therefore, the circle and the triangle must intersect at the point where the circle is tangent to the base line. But the problem says they have exactly one common point. Therefore, that point must be the only intersection point, meaning that the circle is tangent to the triangle at that base line point, but the triangle does not intersect the circle anywhere else. But since the triangle&#39;s base is along the base line, and the circle is tangent to the base line, the circle and the triangle share that tangent point. However, the problem states that their only common point is on the incircle. Therefore, this suggests that the circle is tangent to the triangle not at the base, but at another point. Therefore, the circle must be positioned such that it doesn&#39;t touch the base of the triangle. But how is that possible if the circle is tangent to both lines? Wait, unless the circle is shifted horizontally so that it is tangent to both lines but not centered under the triangle. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the position of the circle relative to the triangle. It just says a circle is placed between the lines, touching both, and the triangle is also between the lines with base on one line and vertex on the other. So maybe the circle is placed off to the side, not centered under the triangle. Then the triangle is placed such that its base is on the lower line, and it only touches the circle once, at a point on its incircle.Therefore, the circle is tangent to both lines, but shifted horizontally relative to the triangle. The triangle is an isosceles triangle, so it&#39;s symmetric about its altitude. If the circle is shifted to the side, then it might touch one of the legs of the triangle at exactly one point, which is also on the incircle. Therefore, the circle is tangent to one leg of the triangle at the point where the incircle is also tangent to that leg. Therefore, the circle and the incircle are tangent at that point, and the circle is also tangent to the leg of the triangle. Therefore, this point is the only common point between the circle and the triangle, and it&#39;s on the incircle. Therefore, this gives us a condition to solve for the inradius.So, let&#39;s model this. Let me set up coordinates. Let the two parallel lines be y=0 and y=2. The circle is tangent to both lines, so its center is at (h,1) for some h, and radius 1. The triangle is an isosceles triangle with base on y=0 and vertex at (0,2). The base is from (-b/2, 0) to (b/2, 0), and the vertex at (0,2). The legs are the lines from (b/2,0) to (0,2) and (-b/2,0) to (0,2). The incircle of the triangle is centered at (0, r), since it must be along the altitude (the y-axis), and its radius is r, which we need to find.The original circle is at (h,1) with radius 1. It is tangent to the triangle at exactly one point, which is on the incircle. Therefore, this point is where the original circle, the incircle, and the triangle all meet. So, the original circle is tangent to the triangle at a point where the incircle is also tangent to the triangle. The incircle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. So, the original circle must be tangent to one of the sides of the triangle at the point where the incircle is tangent to that side.The incircle of the triangle is tangent to the two legs and the base. The points of tangency on the legs are equidistant from the vertex. Let&#39;s calculate the coordinates of the points where the incircle is tangent to the legs.First, the inradius r can be calculated as area divided by semiperimeter. The area of the triangle is (base * height)/2 = (b * 2)/2 = b. The semiperimeter is (b + 2s)/2, where s is the length of the equal sides. As we found earlier, s = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + 4 ). Therefore, r = b / [ (b + 2s ) / 2 ] = 2b / (b + 2s ). Alternatively, since the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. The incenter is located at (0, r). The inradius can also be calculated using the formula for an isosceles triangle: r = (height - sqrt( (height)^2 + (base/2)^2 )) / 2. Wait, not sure. Let me think. For any triangle, the inradius is r = A / s, where A is the area, and s is the semiperimeter. So let&#39;s stick with that.So, we need to relate r to b, and then find a relation from the condition that the original circle is tangent to the triangle at the point where the incircle is tangent to the leg.Let&#39;s parametrize the legs. The right leg goes from (b/2, 0) to (0, 2). The equation of this line can be found as follows. The slope is (2 - 0)/(0 - b/2) = -4/b. So the equation is y = (-4/b)(x - b/2) = (-4/b)x + 2.Similarly, the left leg has equation y = (4/b)x + 2.The incircle is tangent to the right leg at some point. Let&#39;s find that point. The inradius center is at (0, r). The point of tangency on the right leg can be found by moving a distance r from the center along the direction perpendicular to the leg. The slope of the leg is -4/b, so the slope of the perpendicular is b/4. Therefore, the direction vector is (4, b). Normalizing this vector, the distance to move is r. Therefore, the point of tangency is (0, r) + (4, b) * (r / sqrt(16 + b²)). Therefore, the coordinates are (4r / sqrt(16 + b²), r + (b r)/sqrt(16 + b²)).But this point must lie on the right leg, whose equation is y = (-4/b)x + 2. Let&#39;s substitute x and y:y = r + (b r)/sqrt(16 + b²) = (-4/b)(4r / sqrt(16 + b²)) + 2So,r + (b r)/sqrt(16 + b²) = (-16 r)/(b sqrt(16 + b²)) + 2Multiply both sides by sqrt(16 + b²):r sqrt(16 + b²) + b r = (-16 r)/b + 2 sqrt(16 + b²)Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way. Alternatively, the distance from the inradius center to the leg is equal to r. The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). Let&#39;s use that.The equation of the right leg is y = (-4/b)x + 2. Let&#39;s rewrite it as (4/b)x + y - 2 = 0. So, a = 4/b, b = 1, c = -2. The distance from (0, r) to this line is |(4/b)(0) + 1*(r) - 2| / sqrt( (4/b)^2 + 1 ) = |r - 2| / sqrt(16/b² + 1 ). But this distance must equal the inradius r. So:|r - 2| / sqrt(16/b² + 1 ) = rSince the inradius center is below the upper line at y=2, r &lt; 2, so |r - 2| = 2 - r.Therefore:(2 - r)/sqrt(16/b² + 1 ) = rMultiply both sides by sqrt(16/b² + 1 ):2 - r = r sqrt(16/b² + 1 )Square both sides:(2 - r)^2 = r² (16/b² + 1 )Expand left side:4 - 4r + r² = (16 r²)/b² + r²Subtract r² from both sides:4 - 4r = (16 r²)/b²So,(16 r²)/b² = 4 - 4rMultiply both sides by b²:16 r² = (4 - 4r) b²But we need another equation relating b and r. Recall that earlier, we had r = 2b / (b + 2s ), where s = sqrt( (b²)/4 + 4 ). Let me write that down:s = sqrt( (b²)/4 + 4 ) = sqrt( (b² + 16)/4 ) = sqrt(b² + 16)/2Therefore, r = 2b / (b + 2*(sqrt(b² + 16)/2 )) = 2b / (b + sqrt(b² + 16))So, r = 2b / (b + sqrt(b² + 16))Therefore, we can express r in terms of b. Let me denote sqrt(b² + 16) as t. Then, t = sqrt(b² +16), so r = 2b / (b + t). Let&#39;s see.From the previous equation, we have 16 r² = (4 - 4r) b². Let&#39;s substitute r from the expression above.First, express 16 r² = 4(4 r²) = 4 -4r times b². Let&#39;s substitute r = 2b / (b + t), where t = sqrt(b² +16).Therefore:16*(4b²)/(b + t)^2 = (4 - 4*(2b)/(b + t)) * b²Simplify left side: 64b² / (b + t)^2Right side: [4 - 8b/(b + t)] * b² = [ (4(b + t) -8b ) / (b + t) ] * b² = [ (4b +4t -8b ) / (b + t) ] * b² = [ (-4b +4t ) / (b + t) ] * b² = 4(-b + t ) b² / (b + t )Therefore, equation becomes:64b² / (b + t)^2 = 4(-b + t ) b² / (b + t )Cancel b² on both sides (assuming b ≠0):64 / (b + t)^2 = 4(-b + t ) / (b + t )Multiply both sides by (b + t)^2:64 = 4(-b + t)(b + t )Simplify right side:4*(-b^2 -b t +b t + t^2 ) = 4*(t² - b² )But t = sqrt(b² +16), so t² = b² +16.Therefore:64 = 4*( (b² +16) - b² ) = 4*16 =64Which checks out. So, this equation is an identity and doesn&#39;t give new information. Hmm, that&#39;s a problem. It means that the previous equations are dependent, and we need another relation to solve for r. That must come from the condition involving the original circle.So, the original circle is tangent to the triangle at the point where the incircle is tangent to the leg. Let&#39;s find the coordinates of that point. As we calculated earlier, the point of tangency on the right leg is (4r / sqrt(16 + b² ), r + (b r)/sqrt(16 + b² )). Let&#39;s denote sqrt(16 + b² ) as t, so this point is (4r/t, r + (b r)/t). But t = sqrt(b² +16), so t = sqrt(b² +16).But the original circle with center at (h,1) and radius 1 must pass through this point and be tangent to the leg at this point. Therefore, the distance from (h,1) to (4r/t, r + (b r)/t) must be 1, and the slope of the line connecting (h,1) to (4r/t, r + (b r)/t) must be perpendicular to the slope of the leg.The slope of the leg is -4/b, so the slope of the perpendicular is b/4. The slope between (h,1) and (4r/t, r + (b r)/t) is [ (r + (b r)/t -1 ) / (4r/t - h) ] = [ r(1 + b/t) -1 ] / (4r/t - h )This slope must equal b/4. Therefore:[ r(1 + b/t ) -1 ] / (4r/t - h ) = b/4Also, the distance between (h,1) and (4r/t, r + br/t ) is 1:sqrt( (4r/t - h )² + ( r + br/t -1 )² ) =1We have two equations here. Let&#39;s denote:Let’s write t = sqrt(b² +16)Let’s also note that from earlier, r = 2b / (b + t )So, r = 2b / (b + sqrt(b² +16))This seems complicated, but maybe we can find a relation between h and b.Alternatively, perhaps we can find h in terms of b. The original circle is tangent to both lines y=0 and y=2, so its center is at (h,1). Therefore, regardless of h, the circle is always centered at (h,1) with radius 1.But we need the circle to be tangent to the leg of the triangle at the point where the incircle is tangent to the leg. Therefore, this point (4r/t, r + br/t ) must lie on both the leg and the original circle.Therefore, substituting into the equation of the original circle:(4r/t - h )² + ( r + br/t -1 )² =1Also, the condition on the slope:[ r(1 + b/t ) -1 ] / (4r/t - h ) = b/4Let me try to solve these equations. Let’s denote some variables to simplify.Let’s compute t = sqrt(b² +16). Let’s also note that from the inradius formula, r = 2b / (b + t ). Let’s keep this in mind.Let’s compute the point (4r/t, r + br/t). Let’s compute x-coordinate: 4r/t and y-coordinate: r(1 + b/t ). Let’s denote:x = 4r/ty = r(1 + b/t )We also know that this point lies on the leg of the triangle, which has equation y = (-4/b)x + 2. Let’s confirm:y = (-4/b)x +2Substitute x:y = (-4/b)(4r/t ) +2 = (-16 r)/(b t ) +2But we also have y = r(1 + b/t )So:r(1 + b/t ) = (-16 r)/(b t ) +2Multiply both sides by b t:r b t (1 + b/t ) = -16 r + 2 b tSimplify left side:r b t + r b² = -16 r + 2 b tBring all terms to left side:r b t + r b² +16 r -2 b t =0Factor terms:r (b t + b² +16 ) -2 b t =0But t = sqrt(b² +16), so t² = b² +16. So:r (b t + b² +16 ) -2 b t =0Express b t + b² +16 as b t + t². Since t² =b² +16.Therefore:r (b t + t² ) -2 b t =0Factor t:r t (b + t ) -2 b t =0Divide both sides by t (assuming t ≠0):r (b + t ) -2 b =0But from earlier, r =2b/(b + t )So substitute:[2b/(b + t )]*(b + t ) -2b =0Simplify:2b -2b=0 =&gt; 0=0So again, this is an identity, meaning that our previous equations are dependent. Therefore, we need another equation from the slope condition.We have the slope condition:[ y -1 ] / [ x -h ] = b/4Where (x, y ) is (4r/t, r(1 + b/t ) )Therefore:[ r(1 + b/t ) -1 ] / (4r/t - h ) = b/4Cross multiply:4 [ r(1 + b/t ) -1 ] = b (4r/t - h )Expand left side:4 r (1 + b/t ) -4 =4r b/t -b hRearrange terms:4 r + 4 r b/t -4 =4 r b/t -b hSubtract 4 r b/t from both sides:4 r -4 = -b hTherefore:b h =4 -4 rSo,h = (4 -4 r ) / bBut we also have the equation from the circle:(4r/t - h )² + ( r(1 + b/t ) -1 )² =1Let’s substitute h from above:(4r/t - (4 -4 r)/b )² + ( r(1 + b/t ) -1 )² =1This seems complicated, but maybe we can substitute t = sqrt(b² +16) and r =2b/(b + t )Let’s compute each term step by step.First term: (4r/t - (4 -4 r)/b )²Let’s compute 4r/t:4r/t =4*(2b/(b +t )) /t =8b / [ t(b +t ) ]Then, (4 -4r)/b =4(1 - r ) /b =4*(1 -2b/(b +t )) /b =4*( (b +t -2b)/ (b +t )) /b =4*( (t -b)/ (b +t )) /b =4(t -b ) / [b(b +t ) ]Therefore, the first term becomes:[8b / [ t(b +t ) ] -4(t -b ) / [b(b +t ) ] ]²Factor out 4 / [b t (b +t ) ]:[4/(b t (b +t )) * (2b² - t(t -b )) ]²Wait, let me compute numerator:8b / [ t(b +t ) ] -4(t -b ) / [b(b +t ) ] = [8b * b -4(t -b ) t ] / [b t (b +t ) ] = [8b² -4t² +4b t ] / [b t (b +t ) ]Simplify numerator:8b² -4t² +4b t =4*(2b² -t² +b t )But t² =b² +16, so:=4*(2b² - (b² +16 ) +b t ) =4*(b² -16 +b t )Therefore, first term:[4(b² -16 +b t ) / (b t (b +t )) ]² =16*(b² -16 +b t )² / [b² t² (b +t )² ]Second term: ( r(1 +b/t ) -1 )²Compute r(1 +b/t ) -1:=2b/(b +t )*(1 +b/t ) -1 =2b/(b +t )*( (t +b )/t ) -1 =2b/t -1Therefore, (2b/t -1 )²So, the second term is (2b/t -1 )²Therefore, the equation becomes:16*(b² -16 +b t )² / [b² t² (b +t )² ] + (2b/t -1 )² =1This seems very complex, but maybe plugging t =sqrt(b² +16 ) can help. Let me see if we can find a substitution.Let’s set t =sqrt(b² +16 ). Then, t² =b² +16, so b² =t² -16.Let’s substitute into the equation:First term:16*( (t² -16 ) -16 +b t )² / [ (t² -16 ) t² (b +t )² ] + (2b/t -1 )² =1Simplify the numerator inside the first term:(t² -16 -16 +b t ) =t² -32 +b tSo:16*(t² -32 +b t )² / [ (t² -16 ) t² (b +t )² ] + (2b/t -1 )² =1But b can be expressed in terms of t as b = sqrt(t² -16 ). Wait, t =sqrt(b² +16 ), so b =sqrt(t² -16 ). Hmm, maybe that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, since we have t and b related, perhaps we can find a relation between them.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that from earlier, r =2b/(b +t ). We need to find r, so perhaps we can parametrize in terms of r. Let’s see.Let’s denote k = b +t. Then, r =2b/k. Also, t =sqrt(b² +16 ). Let’s express k in terms of b: k =b +sqrt(b² +16 ). Maybe we can write sqrt(b² +16 ) =k -b. Then, squaring both sides:b² +16 =k² -2b k +b²Simplify:16 =k² -2b kBut from r =2b/k, so b = (r k)/2. Substitute into 16 =k² -2b k:16 =k² -2*(r k /2 )*k =k² -r k² =k² (1 - r )Therefore:k² =16/(1 -r )But k =b +t, which is positive. So k =sqrt(16/(1 - r ) )Therefore:k =4/sqrt(1 - r )But k =b +t, and t =sqrt(b² +16 ). So:b + sqrt(b² +16 ) =4/sqrt(1 - r )But this seems complex. Alternatively, from k² =16/(1 -r ), and k =b +t, so:(b +t )² =16/(1 - r )But t² =b² +16, so expand left side:b² +2b t +t² =16/(1 - r )But t² =b² +16, so:b² +2b t +b² +16 =16/(1 - r )Simplify:2b² +2b t +16 =16/(1 - r )Divide both sides by 2:b² +b t +8 =8/(1 - r )But from earlier, we have r =2b/(b +t )Let’s solve for (1 - r ):1 - r =1 -2b/(b +t ) = (b +t -2b )/(b +t ) = (t -b )/(b +t )Therefore, 1/(1 - r ) = (b +t )/(t -b )Therefore, 8/(1 - r ) =8*(b +t )/(t -b )So, the equation becomes:b² +b t +8 =8*(b +t )/(t -b )Multiply both sides by (t -b ):(b² +b t +8 )(t -b ) =8(b +t )Expand left side:b² t -b³ +b t² -b² t +8t -8b =8b +8tSimplify:b² t -b³ +b t² -b² t +8t -8b -8b -8t =0Simplify term by term:b² t -b² t =0-b³+b t²+8t -8t=0-8b -8b =-16bSo:-b³ +b t² -16b =0Factor out -b:-b (b² -t² +16 ) =0Since b ≠0, we have:b² -t² +16=0But t² =b² +16, so:b² - (b² +16 ) +16=0 =&gt;0=0Again, identity. So this approach also leads to identity. Hmm. This suggests that the equations are dependent and we need a different approach.Perhaps we need to use the fact that the original circle is tangent to the leg at the point where the incircle is tangent to the leg, so both circles are tangent at that point. Therefore, the original circle and the incircle are tangent to each other at that point, meaning the distance between their centers is equal to the sum or difference of their radii. Since the original circle has radius 1 and the incircle has radius r. The centers are at (h,1) and (0,r). The distance between centers is sqrt( h² + (1 - r )² ). Since the circles are tangent, this distance should be equal to 1 + r (if externally tangent) or |1 - r | (if internally tangent).But the original circle is tangent to the leg of the triangle, and the incircle is entirely inside the triangle. If the original circle is tangent to the leg from the outside, then the original circle and the incircle would be externally tangent. Therefore, the distance between centers should be 1 + r. Therefore:sqrt( h² + (1 - r )² ) =1 + rSquare both sides:h² + (1 - r )² = (1 + r )²Expand:h² +1 -2r +r² =1 +2r +r²Subtract 1 + r² from both sides:h² -2r =2rThus:h² =4rTherefore, h =±2 sqrt(r )But since the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis, we can assume h &gt;0 without loss of generality. So h=2 sqrt(r )But earlier, from the slope condition, we had h=(4 -4 r )/bSo:2 sqrt(r ) = (4 -4 r ) /bTherefore:b = (4 -4 r ) / (2 sqrt(r )) =2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r )So, b= 2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r )Now, recall that r=2b/(b +t ), where t=sqrt(b² +16 )We can substitute b from above into this equation.Let’s set b=2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r )Then,r=2*(2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r )) / [2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r ) + sqrt( (2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r ))² +16 ) ]This looks very complicated, but let&#39;s try to simplify step by step.First, compute denominator:D=2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r ) + sqrt( [4(1 - r )² / r ] +16 )Let’s compute the term inside the sqrt:4(1 - r )² / r +16= [4(1 -2r +r² ) +16 r ] / r = [4 -8r +4r² +16 r ] /r = [4 +8r +4r² ] /r =4(r² +2r +1 ) /r =4(r +1 )² /rTherefore, sqrt(4(r +1 )² /r )=2(r +1 ) / sqrt(r )Therefore, denominator D=2(1 - r ) / sqrt(r ) +2(r +1 ) / sqrt(r )= [2(1 -r ) +2(r +1 ) ] / sqrt(r )= [2 -2r +2r +2 ] / sqrt(r )=4 / sqrt(r )Therefore, D=4 / sqrt(r )Therefore, numerator=2*(2(1 -r ) / sqrt(r ))=4(1 -r ) / sqrt(r )Therefore, r= [4(1 - r ) / sqrt(r ) ] / [4 / sqrt(r ) ]= [4(1 - r ) / sqrt(r ) ] * [ sqrt(r ) /4 ]=1 -rThus:r =1 - r=&gt;2r =1=&gt;r=1/2Therefore, the inradius is 1/2.Let me check this solution. If r=1/2, then from h=2 sqrt(r ), h=2*sqrt(1/2)=2*(√2/2)=√2. Then, b=2(1 -1/2 ) / sqrt(1/2 )=2*(1/2 ) / (1/√2 )=1 / (1/√2 )=√2. Therefore, b=√2. Then, t=sqrt(b² +16 )=sqrt(2 +16 )=sqrt(18 )=3√2. Then, s=sqrt( (b/2 )² +4 )=sqrt( ( (√2)/2 )² +4 )=sqrt( (2/4 ) +4 )=sqrt( 1/2 +4 )=sqrt(9/2 )=(3)/√2= (3√2)/2. The semiperimeter is (b +2s )/2=(√2 +2*(3√2)/2 )/2=(√2 +3√2 )/2=(4√2 )/2=2√2. The area is b=√2. Therefore, inradius r= area / semiperimeter=√2 / (2√2 )=1/2. Correct.Then, the original circle is at (h,1 )=(√2,1 ). The point of tangency is (4r/t, r +br/t ). Let&#39;s compute:4r/t=4*(1/2 )/(3√2 )=2/(3√2 )=√2/3r +br/t=1/2 + (√2 )(1/2 )/(3√2 )=1/2 + (1/2 )/3=1/2 +1/6=2/3So the point is (√2/3,2/3 ). The original circle is centered at (√2,1 ) with radius1. The distance between (√2,1 ) and (√2/3,2/3 ) is sqrt( (√2 -√2/3 )² + (1 -2/3 )² )=sqrt( (2√2/3 )² + (1/3 )² )=sqrt(8/9 +1/9 )=sqrt(9/9 )=1. Correct. Therefore, the point is on the original circle. The slope between centers is (2/3 -1 ) / (√2/3 -√2 )= (-1/3 ) / (-2√2 /3 )= (1/3 ) / (2√2 /3 )=1/(2√2 )=√2/4. The slope of the leg is -4/b =-4/√2=-2√2. The slope of the perpendicular is b/4=√2/4. Which matches the slope between the centers. Therefore, the original circle is indeed tangent to the leg at that point. Therefore, all conditions are satisfied. Thus, the inradius is 1/2.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given two parallel lines with a circle of radius 1 placed between them, touching both lines, and an isosceles triangle with its base on one line and vertex on the other. The circle and the triangle have exactly one common point, which lies on the inscribed circle of the triangle. We need to find the radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle.1. Setup and Key Observations:   - The distance between the parallel lines is 2 units (twice the radius of the circle).   - The height of the isosceles triangle is 2 units.   - The inscribed circle (incircle) of the triangle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.   - The circle of radius 1 is tangent to both lines and touches the triangle at exactly one point, which is on the incircle of the triangle.2. Coordinates and Geometry:   - The circle (radius 1) is centered at ((h, 1)) and touches both lines (y=0) and (y=2).   - The triangle&#39;s base is on (y=0) and vertex at ((0, 2)). The incircle of the triangle is centered at ((0, r)) with radius (r).3. Key Equations and Relationships:   - The inradius (r) of the triangle is given by (r = frac{A}{s}), where (A) is the area and (s) is the semiperimeter.   - The area (A) of the triangle is (b) (base (b), height 2).   - The semiperimeter (s) is (frac{b + 2s}{2}), where (s) is the length of the equal sides.   - Using the Pythagorean theorem, the equal sides (s = sqrt{left(frac{b}{2}right)^2 + 4}).4. Tangency Conditions:   - The circle and the incircle are tangent to each other at the common point.   - The distance between the centers of the circle and the incircle is ( sqrt{h^2 + (1 - r)^2} ).   - This distance must equal (1 + r) (externally tangent).5. Solving for (r):   - From the tangency condition, we derive the equation ( sqrt{h^2 + (1 - r)^2} = 1 + r ).   - Solving this, we find ( h = 2sqrt{r} ).   - Using the relationship between (h), (b), and (r), we find ( b = frac{2(1 - r)}{sqrt{r}} ).   - Substituting back, we solve for (r) and find ( r = frac{1}{2} ).Thus, the radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9ea064b2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9ea064b2><span class="icon" data-v-9ea064b2>🔑:</span>Let the circle Omega with radius 1 and center O touch the given lines at points L and M, and the side A B of triangle A B C at point K (see the left figure).

Alice is rolling two octahedral dice, each with numbers from 2 to 9. We need to find the probability that the sum of the two dice is 11. Hmm, probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but let&#39;s break it down step by step.First, I know that probability is generally the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out two things: how many total possible outcomes are there when rolling two dice, and how many of those outcomes result in a sum of 11.Let me start with the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 8 faces, right? Numbers 2 through 9. So, when rolling two dice, each die is independent. That means the total number of possible outcomes is the number of outcomes for the first die multiplied by the number of outcomes for the second die. So, 8 outcomes for the first die and 8 for the second, which would be 8 x 8 = 64 total possible outcomes. That seems straightforward.Now, the next part is figuring out how many of those 64 outcomes sum to 11. To do this, I need to list all the possible pairs (a, b) where a is the result of the first die, b is the result of the second die, and a + b = 11. Since both dice can show numbers from 2 to 9, let&#39;s see which pairs add up to 11.Let me list them out systematically. Let&#39;s consider the possible values for the first die (a) and see what the corresponding value of the second die (b) needs to be to get a sum of 11. Remember, both a and b have to be between 2 and 9 inclusive.If a = 2, then b = 11 - 2 = 9. Is 9 a valid result for the second die? Yes, since the die goes up to 9. So, (2, 9) is a valid pair.If a = 3, then b = 11 - 3 = 8. 8 is also valid. So, (3, 8).a = 4: b = 11 - 4 = 7. Valid. (4, 7).a = 5: b = 11 - 5 = 6. Valid. (5, 6).a = 6: b = 11 - 6 = 5. Valid. (6, 5).a = 7: b = 11 - 7 = 4. Valid. (7, 4).a = 8: b = 11 - 8 = 3. Valid. (8, 3).a = 9: b = 11 - 9 = 2. Valid. (9, 2).So, each value of a from 2 to 9 gives a corresponding b that is within the valid range. Let&#39;s count these pairs. Starting with a = 2: 1 pair, a = 3: another, and so on up to a = 9. That&#39;s 8 different values of a, each giving one valid pair. Wait, but hold on. When a = 6, we get b = 5, which is different from when a = 5, b = 6. Similarly for the others. So each of these pairs is unique in terms of order. Since the dice are distinguishable (i.e., first die and second die), the order matters here. For example, (2,9) is different from (9,2). But wait, in this list, when a goes from 2 to 9, the pairs are (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). Let&#39;s count these. That&#39;s 8 pairs. Wait, but when we get to a = 5, the pair is (5,6), and when a = 6, it&#39;s (6,5). So these are two different outcomes. Similarly for the others. So, in total, how many unique ordered pairs are there that sum to 11? Let&#39;s see:From the list above: (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). That&#39;s 8 pairs. Each of these is a distinct outcome because the dice are ordered. So, there are 8 successful outcomes.Therefore, the number of successful outcomes is 8, and the total number of possible outcomes is 64. Therefore, the probability is 8/64. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 8: 1/8. So, the probability is 1/8.Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify the pairs again.If we list all possible pairs where the sum is 11:Start with the lowest possible number on the first die, which is 2. Then, the second die must be 9. Then next, first die 3, second die 8. Then 4 and 7, 5 and 6. Then if the first die is 6, second is 5; first die 7, second 4; first die 8, second 3; first die 9, second 2. Yes, that&#39;s 8 different ordered pairs. Each of these is a separate outcome when rolling two dice. So, 8 successful outcomes. Total outcomes 8x8=64. So, 8/64 = 1/8. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the dice are octahedral. But octahedral just means 8 faces. So, numbers 2 through 9. So, the calculation still holds.Wait, but just to confirm, let&#39;s check if there are any other pairs that I might have missed. For example, does 10 come into play here? Wait, no. The numbers on each die go up to 9, so the maximum sum is 9 + 9 = 18. The minimum sum is 2 + 2 = 4. So, 11 is somewhere in the middle.But in our case, when we list all possible pairs that sum to 11, we got 8. So, 8 out of 64. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe the question is if the dice are indistinct. But in probability problems with dice, unless specified otherwise, we usually consider them as distinct (i.e., first die and second die). So, ordered pairs. So, (2,9) and (9,2) are different. Therefore, 8 successful outcomes.Alternatively, if the dice were considered indistinct, then we would have combinations rather than permutations. In that case, the pairs (2,9) and (9,2) would be the same combination. So, how many unique combinations sum to 11? Let&#39;s see. The unique pairs would be (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6). So, 4 combinations. But each combination except for the ones with the same numbers (which isn&#39;t the case here since all pairs here have distinct numbers) would count twice in the ordered list. So, 4 combinations, each contributing 2 ordered pairs, except if the two numbers are the same, but here none of the pairs have the same number. So, 4 x 2 = 8 ordered pairs. Therefore, even if you think of it as combinations, you still end up with 8 ordered pairs. So, the number of successful outcomes is 8. So, probability is 8/64 = 1/8.Therefore, the answer is 1/8. Hmm.Wait, but just to make sure, let&#39;s do a different approach. Let&#39;s compute all possible sums and see how many ways there are to get 11.The possible numbers on each die: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.So, the possible pairs (a,b) where a + b = 11.Let me think: starting with the smallest possible a, which is 2:a=2, b=9. Valid.a=3, b=8. Valid.a=4, b=7. Valid.a=5, b=6. Valid.a=6, b=5. Valid.a=7, b=4. Valid.a=8, b=3. Valid.a=9, b=2. Valid.So, again, 8 ordered pairs. So, that&#39;s 8. Therefore, 8/64=1/8.Alternatively, if the dice were numbered starting at 1, but here they start at 2. So, the shift in numbering might affect the possible sums, but in this case, since both dice start at 2, the minimum sum is 4, and the maximum is 18, but the question is about 11.Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of generating functions. Wait, that might be overcomplicating, but let&#39;s try.The generating function for a single die is x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8 + x^9. For two dice, the generating function would be (x^2 + x^3 + ... +x^9)^2. The coefficient of x^11 in this expansion would give the number of ways to roll a sum of 11. Let&#39;s compute that.First, note that (x^2 + x^3 + ... +x^9) is equal to x^2(1 + x + x^2 + ... +x^7). The sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series: (1 - x^8)/(1 - x). So, the generating function is x^2*(1 - x^8)/(1 - x).Therefore, the generating function for two dice is [x^2*(1 - x^8)/(1 - x)]^2 = x^4*(1 - x^8)^2/(1 - x)^2.We need the coefficient of x^11 in this. Let&#39;s expand (1 - x^8)^2 = 1 - 2x^8 + x^{16}.So, the generating function becomes x^4*(1 - 2x^8 + x^{16})/(1 - x)^2.So, we need the coefficient of x^{11} in this, which is the same as the coefficient of x^{7} in (1 - 2x^8 + x^{16})/(1 - x)^2, because we have x^4 multiplied by the rest.But wait, let&#39;s step back. Since the generating function is x^4*(1 - 2x^8 + x^{16})/(1 - x)^2, the coefficient of x^{11} would be equal to the coefficient of x^{11 -4} = x^7 in (1 - 2x^8 + x^{16})/(1 - x)^2.Therefore, the coefficient of x^7 in [1/(1 - x)^2] minus 2 times the coefficient of x^{7 -8} = x^{-1} (which is zero) plus the coefficient of x^{7 -16} = x^{-9} (also zero). So, effectively, the coefficient of x^7 in 1/(1 - x)^2.But 1/(1 - x)^2 is the generating function for the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n+1, ... So, the coefficient of x^k in 1/(1 - x)^2 is (k + 1). Therefore, the coefficient of x^7 is 7 + 1 = 8. Therefore, the coefficient of x^{11} in the original generating function is 8. Therefore, there are 8 ways to get a sum of 11. So, this method also confirms that there are 8 successful outcomes.Therefore, the probability is 8/64 = 1/8. So, that&#39;s consistent with the previous methods.Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach: since each die is numbered 2 through 9, let&#39;s adjust the problem to dice numbered 0 through 7 by subtracting 2 from each die. Then, the sum becomes (a&#39; + 2) + (b&#39; + 2) = a&#39; + b&#39; + 4 = 11. Therefore, a&#39; + b&#39; = 7. Where a&#39; and b&#39; are numbers from 0 to 7. The number of solutions to a&#39; + b&#39; = 7 where a&#39; and b&#39; are integers between 0 and 7 inclusive.This is a standard stars and bars problem, but since each variable is bounded between 0 and 7, we can compute the number of non-negative integer solutions to a&#39; + b&#39; =7. Without restrictions, the number of solutions is 7 + 1 =8. However, since each die can go up to 7 (since original die goes up to 9, subtract 2 gives 7), the maximum each variable can be is 7. But since 7 is already the total needed, both a&#39; and b&#39; can&#39;t exceed 7 in this case. For example, if a&#39; is 7, then b&#39; is 0, which is allowed. If a&#39; is 8, then b&#39; would be -1, which is invalid. But since a&#39; and b&#39; can only go up to 7, and the total is 7, all solutions are valid. Because even if one is 7, the other is 0, which is allowed. So, there are 8 solutions here as well. Therefore, translating back, each a&#39; corresponds to a die face of a = a&#39; + 2, so the original pairs are (a&#39; +2, b&#39; +2) where a&#39; + b&#39; =7. So, the number of solutions is 8, which matches our previous result.Therefore, this approach also gives 8 successful outcomes. So, probability 8/64=1/8. So, all methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the probability is 1/8.Final AnswerThe probability is boxed{dfrac{1}{8}}.&lt;/think&gt;Alice rolls two octahedral dice with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We need to find the probability that the sum of the two dice is 11.First, we determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 8 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is:[8 times 8 = 64]Next, we identify the pairs of numbers (a, b) such that (a + b = 11). We systematically check each possible value of (a) and find the corresponding (b):- If (a = 2), then (b = 9)- If (a = 3), then (b = 8)- If (a = 4), then (b = 7)- If (a = 5), then (b = 6)- If (a = 6), then (b = 5)- If (a = 7), then (b = 4)- If (a = 8), then (b = 3)- If (a = 9), then (b = 2)These pairs are: (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3), (9, 2). There are 8 such pairs.Thus, the number of successful outcomes is 8. The probability is then:[frac{8}{64} = frac{1}{8}]The final answer is (boxed{dfrac{1}{8}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so Alice is rolling two octahedral dice, each with numbers from 2 to 9. The question is asking for the probability that the sum of the two dice is 11. Hmm, let&#39;s see. Probability problems usually involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So I need to find how many different ways the two dice can add up to 11, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice.First, let&#39;s confirm the total number of possible outcomes. Each die is octahedral, meaning it has 8 faces. So for each die, there are 8 possible outcomes. Since the two dice are rolled independently, the total number of possible outcomes is 8 multiplied by 8, which is 64. So the denominator in our probability calculation will be 64.Now, for the numerator, we need to count how many pairs of numbers (one from each die) add up to 11. The numbers on each die are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let&#39;s list out all possible pairs where the sum is 11.Let me start with the first die showing 2. Then the second die would need to be 11 - 2 = 9. Since 9 is on the die, that&#39;s a valid pair: (2,9).Next, if the first die is 3, the second die would need to be 11 - 3 = 8. 8 is on the die, so (3,8).First die is 4: second die needs to be 11 - 4 = 7. 7 is on the die: (4,7).First die is 5: second die needs to be 11 - 5 = 6. 6 is on the die: (5,6).First die is 6: second die needs to be 11 - 6 = 5. 5 is on the die: (6,5).First die is 7: second die needs to be 11 - 7 = 4. 4 is on the die: (7,4).First die is 8: second die needs to be 11 - 8 = 3. 3 is on the die: (8,3).First die is 9: second die needs to be 11 - 9 = 2. 2 is on the die: (9,2).So let&#39;s count these pairs. Each step from 2 to 9 on the first die gives one valid pair, except that after 5, we start getting mirror images. But actually, when we list them all out, each of these pairs is unique in terms of their combination. For example, (2,9) is different from (9,2) because the first die and the second die are distinguishable. Wait, but are they?Hold on, in probability problems with two dice, unless specified otherwise, we usually consider them distinguishable, meaning that rolling a 2 on the first die and a 9 on the second is different from rolling a 9 on the first and a 2 on the second. So both of these are separate outcomes. However, in this case, when I list them out from first die being 2 up to 9, each possible second die number is unique. So how many pairs do we have here?From the list above:(2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). That&#39;s 8 different pairs. Let me count again: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Yep, 8 favorable outcomes where the two dice sum to 11.Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 8, and the total number of possible outcomes is 64. So the probability is 8/64, which simplifies to 1/8.Wait a second, let me make sure I didn&#39;t miss any pairs. Let me check again. For each possible value of the first die from 2 to 9, compute the required second die. If the required second die is within 2 to 9, then it&#39;s a valid pair.Starting with first die as 2: 11 - 2 = 9 (valid)First die 3: 8 (valid)4:7 (valid)5:6 (valid)6:5 (valid)7:4 (valid)8:3 (valid)9:2 (valid)So indeed, for each of the 8 possible numbers on the first die, there is exactly one number on the second die that would make the sum 11, and all those numbers are within the range of the die (2-9). Therefore, each of the 8 first die numbers pairs with exactly one second die number, giving 8 favorable outcomes.Therefore, 8 favorable out of 64 possible. 8 divided by 64 is 1/8, which is 0.125. So the probability is 1/8.But wait, let me just verify that there are 8 numbers on each die. The problem states that the dice are octahedral (8 faces) with numbers 2 through 9. So yes, numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. That&#39;s 8 numbers. So each die has 8 possible outcomes, leading to 8*8=64 total outcomes. That seems right.Alternatively, if we thought of the die starting at 1, but no, the problem states it&#39;s 2 through 9. So 8 numbers. So that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where octahedral die could be numbered differently, but the problem explicitly says numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So no trick there.Therefore, I think the answer is 1/8.But just to double-check, sometimes when you have two dice, people might confuse ordered pairs with unordered pairs. However, in probability, unless specified, we take ordered pairs. So (2,9) and (9,2) are different outcomes. However, in this case, even if we considered unordered pairs, how many would there be?In unordered pairs, (2,9) is the same as (9,2), (3,8) same as (8,3), etc. So there would be 4 unique unordered pairs: {2,9}, {3,8}, {4,7}, {5,6}. Then if we considered unordered pairs, the number of total possible outcomes would be C(8 + 2 -1, 2) ??? Wait no. Wait, no. Wait, actually, when rolling two distinguishable dice, the total number of outcomes is 64 ordered pairs, regardless. So even if you consider unordered pairs, the number of possible outcomes is 64. However, the problem is asking for the probability, which in standard terms is based on the number of ordered pairs. So unless stated otherwise, we should consider ordered pairs, which is 64. So the answer is 8/64=1/8.Alternatively, if someone were confused and thought that dice are indistinct, they might count unordered pairs, but in probability, unless specified, dice are considered distinct. So for example, getting a 2 on die 1 and 9 on die 2 is different from 9 on die 1 and 2 on die 2. So both of these are separate outcomes. Therefore, there are 8 ordered pairs that sum to 11, leading to 8/64=1/8.Alternatively, maybe the problem is different. Let me check the numbers again. The die has numbers from 2 to 9. So the minimum sum is 2 + 2 = 4, and the maximum sum is 9 + 9 = 18. So 11 is somewhere in the middle. Let me check if there are other pairs that sum to 11 which I might have missed.Wait, for example, 2 and 9, 3 and 8, 4 and 7, 5 and 6. Then the reverse for each of these. But as we established, since the dice are distinct, those are separate. So there are 8 ordered pairs. So 8 favorable over 64 total.Another way: think of it as the number of integer solutions to a + b = 11, where a and b are integers between 2 and 9 inclusive. So we can model this as solving for a and b such that a &gt;=2, a &lt;=9, b &gt;=2, b &lt;=9, and a + b =11.So let&#39;s solve for a: a can range from 2 to 9, then b =11 - a. Then b must also be between 2 and 9. So let&#39;s see for a from 2 to 9:a=2: b=9 (valid)a=3: b=8 (valid)a=4: b=7 (valid)a=5: b=6 (valid)a=6: b=5 (valid)a=7: b=4 (valid)a=8: b=3 (valid)a=9: b=2 (valid)So for each a from 2 to 9, b is in the valid range. Therefore, there are 8 solutions. Therefore, 8 ordered pairs, hence probability 8/64=1/8. So that confirms the previous result.Alternatively, if the numbers on the die had started at 1, the problem would have been different. But since they start at 2, all the required numbers for b=11 - a are also within 2 to 9. So each a from 2 to 9 gives a valid b. Therefore, 8 pairs.Therefore, the probability is 1/8. So unless I made a mistake in considering the die numbers or miscounted, that should be correct.Wait, let me check once again:List all possible pairs:(2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). That&#39;s 8 pairs.Each of these is unique and valid. So 8/64=1/8.Yep, that seems right. So I think the answer is 1/8.Final AnswerThe probability is boxed{dfrac{1}{8}}.&lt;/think&gt;Alice rolls two octahedral dice with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We need to find the probability that the sum of the two dice is 11.First, we determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 8 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is:[8 times 8 = 64]Next, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two dice is 11. We list the pairs ((a, b)) such that (a + b = 11) and both (a) and (b) are numbers on the dice (2 to 9):- If the first die shows 2, the second die must show 9: ((2, 9))- If the first die shows 3, the second die must show 8: ((3, 8))- If the first die shows 4, the second die must show 7: ((4, 7))- If the first die shows 5, the second die must show 6: ((5, 6))- If the first die shows 6, the second die must show 5: ((6, 5))- If the first die shows 7, the second die must show 4: ((7, 4))- If the first die shows 8, the second die must show 3: ((8, 3))- If the first die shows 9, the second die must show 2: ((9, 2))There are 8 such pairs. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 8.The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:[frac{8}{64} = frac{1}{8}]The probability that the two dice sum to 11 is boxed{dfrac{1}{8}}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9ea064b2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9ea064b2><span class="icon" data-v-9ea064b2>🔑:</span>Answer: quad frac{1}{8} No matter what comes up on the first die, there is exactly one number that could appear on the second die to make the sum 11 , because 2 can be paired with 9,3 with 8 , and so on.

So, we have an arithmetic sequence {aₙ} and a geometric sequence {bₙ} that&#39;s monotonically increasing. Both start with 1, so a₁ = b₁ = 1. We need to find their general formulas and then the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {aₙ + bₙ}.Starting with part (1). For the arithmetic sequence {aₙ}, since it&#39;s arithmetic, each term is the previous term plus a common difference, let&#39;s call it d. So, the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d. Since a₁ is 1, that simplifies to aₙ = 1 + (n - 1)d.We are given that a₂ + a₄ = 6. Let&#39;s write out those terms using the formula:a₂ = 1 + (2 - 1)d = 1 + da₄ = 1 + (4 - 1)d = 1 + 3dAdding them together: (1 + d) + (1 + 3d) = 2 + 4d = 6So, solving for d:2 + 4d = 6Subtract 2 from both sides: 4d = 4Divide both sides by 4: d = 1So, the common difference d is 1. Therefore, the arithmetic sequence {aₙ} is:aₙ = 1 + (n - 1)*1 = 1 + n - 1 = nWait, that simplifies to aₙ = n? Let me check. If n=1, a₁=1, which is correct. n=2, a₂=2, which would be 1 + 1, yes. Then a₃=3, etc. So, the arithmetic sequence is just the natural numbers. That seems right because the difference is 1. Okay, that&#39;s straightforward.Now, moving on to the geometric sequence {bₙ}. It&#39;s a geometric sequence, so each term is the previous term multiplied by a common ratio, let&#39;s call it r. Since it&#39;s monotonically increasing, the common ratio must be greater than 1, right? Because if it were between 0 and 1, the terms would be decreasing, and if r = 1, it&#39;s constant. But since it&#39;s monotonically increasing, r &gt; 1. Also, b₁ = 1, so the general term is bₙ = b₁ * r^(n - 1) = r^(n - 1).We also know that a₃ * b₃ = 12. Let&#39;s find a₃ first. Since {aₙ} is arithmetic with d=1, a₃ = 3. Then, b₃ is r^(3 - 1) = r².So, a₃ * b₃ = 3 * r² = 12. Let&#39;s solve for r:3r² = 12Divide both sides by 3: r² = 4Take the square root: r = 2 or r = -2But since {bₙ} is monotonically increasing, and starting from 1, the ratio must be positive and greater than 1. So, r = 2. If r were -2, the terms would alternate in sign and not be monotonically increasing. So, r = 2.Therefore, the geometric sequence {bₙ} is:bₙ = 2^(n - 1)Let me verify. For n=1, b₁=1, correct. n=2, b₂=2^(1)=2. n=3, b₃=4, which when multiplied by a₃=3 gives 12, which matches the given condition. Also, the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8,... which is indeed monotonically increasing. Perfect.So, part (1) is done. The general formulas are aₙ = n and bₙ = 2^(n - 1).Now, part (2): Find the sum Sₙ of the first n terms of the sequence {aₙ + bₙ}.Since {aₙ + bₙ} is the sequence formed by adding the corresponding terms of the arithmetic and geometric sequences, the sum Sₙ would be the sum of the first n terms of {aₙ} plus the sum of the first n terms of {bₙ}.So, Sₙ = Sum_{k=1 to n} (aₖ + bₖ) = Sum_{k=1 to n} aₖ + Sum_{k=1 to n} bₖFirst, let&#39;s compute the sum of the arithmetic sequence {aₙ}. Since aₙ = n, the sum of the first n terms is Sum_{k=1 to n} k = n(n + 1)/2.Next, the sum of the geometric sequence {bₙ}. The general formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence with first term b₁ and common ratio r is S_n = b₁(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Here, b₁ = 1 and r = 2, so Sum_{k=1 to n} bₖ = (2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^n - 1.Therefore, combining these two results:Sₙ = [n(n + 1)/2] + [2^n - 1]Simplify if possible. Let&#39;s write it as:Sₙ = (n² + n)/2 + 2^n - 1We can combine the constants:= 2^n - 1 + (n² + n)/2Alternatively, write all terms over a common denominator:= (2^{n+1} - 2 + n² + n)/2But perhaps leaving it as separate terms is clearer. Let me check:Original sum is Sum aₖ = n(n + 1)/2 and Sum bₖ = 2^n - 1. So, adding them together gives Sₙ = n(n + 1)/2 + 2^n - 1. This is probably the simplest form.Let me verify with small n. For n=1:a₁ + b₁ = 1 + 1 = 2. Sum S₁ = 2. According to the formula: 1(1 +1)/2 + 2^1 -1 = 2/2 + 2 -1 = 1 +1=2. Correct.n=2:a₁ + b₁ + a₂ + b₂ = 1 +1 +2 +2=6. Formula: 2(3)/2 +4 -1 = 3 +3=6. Correct.n=3:Sum is 1+1 +2+2 +3+4=1+2+3 +1+2+4=6 +7=13. Formula: 3(4)/2 +8 -1=6 +7=13. Correct.So, the formula works. Therefore, the answer is Sₙ = (n(n + 1))/2 + 2ⁿ - 1.But let me check if the problem expects any particular format. They say &quot;Find the sum Sₙ&quot;, so probably expressing it as two separate sums combined is acceptable. Alternatively, combining constants if possible, but in this case, since one is a quadratic term and the other is exponential, they can&#39;t be simplified further. So, the answer should be Sₙ = (n² + n)/2 + 2ⁿ - 1.Alternatively, writing the terms in order: 2ⁿ + (n² + n)/2 - 1. Either way is fine, but perhaps the first form is clearer as it shows the two separate sums. So, summarizing:(1) The general term for {aₙ} is aₙ = n, and for {bₙ} is bₙ = 2^{n−1}.(2) The sum Sₙ is (n(n +1))/2 + 2^{n} −1.I think that&#39;s all. Let me just double-check the arithmetic sequence. Since a₁=1, d=1, so terms are 1,2,3,4,... which fits. The geometric sequence is 1,2,4,8,... which is r=2, so correct. The sum of arithmetic sequence up to n is n(n+1)/2, and the sum of geometric is 2^{n} -1. Adding them together gives the desired result. All checks out.Final Answer(1) The general formulas are boxed{a_n = n} and boxed{b_n = 2^{n-1}}.(2) The sum S_n is boxed{frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 2^n - 1}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that ({a_{n}}) is an arithmetic sequence and ({b_{n}}) is a monotonically increasing geometric sequence, with (a_{1} = b_{1} = 1), (a_{2} + a_{4} = 6), and (a_{3}b_{3} = 12):1. Finding the general formulas for ({a_{n}}) and ({b_{n}}):   - For the arithmetic sequence ({a_{n}}):     - The common difference (d) is found using (a_{2} + a_{4} = 6):       [       (1 + d) + (1 + 3d) = 6 implies 2 + 4d = 6 implies d = 1       ]     - Thus, the general formula for (a_{n}) is:       [       a_{n} = 1 + (n - 1) cdot 1 = n       ]   - For the geometric sequence ({b_{n}}):     - The common ratio (r) is found using (a_{3}b_{3} = 12):       [       3 cdot r^{2} = 12 implies r^{2} = 4 implies r = 2 quad (text{since } r &gt; 1)       ]     - Thus, the general formula for (b_{n}) is:       [       b_{n} = 2^{n-1}       ]2.

I need to solve this problem about arithmetic and geometric sequences. The problem has two parts. First, find the general formulas for the arithmetic sequence {a_n} and the geometric sequence {b_n}. Then, find the sum S_n of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n + b_n}. Alright, let&#39;s start with part (1). Given that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, so its terms increase by a common difference each time. The first term a_1 is 1. Similarly, {b_n} is a geometric sequence that&#39;s monotonically increasing, so its terms are multiplied by a common ratio each time, and since it&#39;s increasing, the ratio must be greater than 1. The first term b_1 is also 1. We also know that a_2 + a_4 = 6 and a_3 * b_3 = 12. So, I need to find the common difference for the arithmetic sequence and the common ratio for the geometric sequence. Let&#39;s denote the common difference of {a_n} as d, and the common ratio of {b_n} as r. First, let&#39;s handle the arithmetic sequence {a_n}. Since it&#39;s arithmetic, the nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Given that a_1 = 1, so a_n = 1 + (n - 1)d. Then, a_2 = 1 + (2 - 1)d = 1 + d.Similarly, a_4 = 1 + (4 - 1)d = 1 + 3d.So, a_2 + a_4 = (1 + d) + (1 + 3d) = 2 + 4d. According to the problem, this equals 6. So:2 + 4d = 6Subtract 2 from both sides: 4d = 4Divide by 4: d = 1.So, the common difference d is 1. Therefore, the general formula for {a_n} is a_n = 1 + (n - 1)*1 = n. Wait, that&#39;s nice. So each term is just n. Let me check that.If a_n = n, then a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 4, etc. Then a_2 + a_4 = 2 + 4 = 6, which matches the given condition. Good. So that seems correct.Now, moving on to the geometric sequence {b_n}. Since it&#39;s geometric with first term b_1 = 1 and common ratio r, the nth term is b_n = b_1 * r^{n - 1} = r^{n - 1}. Given that the sequence is monotonically increasing, the common ratio r must be greater than 1 because the terms are increasing. If r were 1, it would be constant, and if r were between 0 and 1, it would be decreasing. Since it&#39;s increasing, r &gt; 1.Now, we need to find r. The other condition given is that a_3 * b_3 = 12. We already know a_3 from the arithmetic sequence. Since a_n = n, a_3 = 3. Therefore, 3 * b_3 = 12. So b_3 = 12 / 3 = 4.But b_3 is the third term of the geometric sequence. Since b_n = r^{n - 1}, then b_3 = r^{2} = 4. Therefore, solving for r: r^2 = 4. So r = sqrt(4) = 2 or r = -2. However, since the sequence is monotonically increasing and starts at 1, the ratio can&#39;t be negative. Because if r were negative, the terms would alternate in sign, which would not be a monotonic increase. For example, if r = -2, the sequence would be 1, -2, 4, -8, etc., which alternates signs and isn&#39;t monotonically increasing. Therefore, r must be positive. So r = 2.Therefore, the common ratio is 2, so the general formula for {b_n} is b_n = 1 * 2^{n - 1} = 2^{n - 1}.Let me verify that. b_1 = 2^{0} = 1, which is correct. b_2 = 2^{1} = 2, b_3 = 2^{2} = 4, which matches the earlier calculation that b_3 = 4. Then the terms of {b_n} are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., which is indeed a monotonically increasing sequence. Perfect.So, part (1) is solved. The general formula for {a_n} is a_n = n, and for {b_n} is b_n = 2^{n - 1}.Moving on to part (2), which asks for the sum S_n of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n + b_n}. So S_n is the sum from k=1 to n of (a_k + b_k). But the sum of a sum is the sum of the sums. So S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k + sum_{k=1}^n b_k. That is, the sum of the first n terms of {a_n} plus the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}.We already have formulas for both {a_n} and {b_n}, so we can compute their individual sums and then add them together.First, the sum of the arithmetic sequence {a_n}. Since a_n = n, the sum of the first n terms is the sum from 1 to n of k. The formula for that is n(n + 1)/2. Alternatively, since it&#39;s an arithmetic sequence, the sum can also be calculated as (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2. Which would be n*(1 + n)/2, which is the same as n(n + 1)/2. So that&#39;s straightforward.Next, the sum of the geometric sequence {b_n}. Since b_n = 2^{n - 1}, the sum of the first n terms is sum_{k=1}^n 2^{k - 1}. This is a geometric series with ratio 2, first term 1. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is S_n = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Plugging in r = 2, we get (2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^n - 1. Therefore, the sum of the first n terms of {b_n} is 2^n - 1.Therefore, the total sum S_n is the sum of the arithmetic sequence plus the sum of the geometric sequence:S_n = [n(n + 1)/2] + [2^n - 1]Let me write that out:S_n = (n(n + 1))/2 + 2^n - 1We can also combine the constants if needed. The -1 and the other terms. But maybe that&#39;s already simple enough. Let me check with n=1 to see if it works.For n=1: S_1 = (1*2)/2 + 2^1 - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2. But according to the original sequences, a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.For n=2: S_2 = (2*3)/2 + 2^2 -1 = 3 + 4 -1 = 6. The actual terms: (1+1) + (2+2) = 2 + 4 = 6. Correct.For n=3: S_3 = (3*4)/2 + 8 -1 = 6 + 7 = 13. Actual terms: (1+1) + (2+2) + (3+4) = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13. Correct. So the formula works.Therefore, the sum S_n is (n(n + 1))/2 + 2^n - 1.Alternatively, we can write it as 2^n + (n(n + 1))/2 - 1. It&#39;s probably better to order it in terms of descending powers, so 2^n + (n^2 + n)/2 - 1. Maybe that&#39;s the most simplified form.So, part (2) is solved as well.Therefore, the answers are:(1) a_n = n and b_n = 2^{n - 1}(2) S_n = 2^n + (n(n + 1))/2 - 1Let me just check once more for any possible mistakes. For {a_n}, we had an arithmetic sequence starting at 1 with common difference d. We found d=1, so indeed a_n = 1 + (n -1)*1 = n. For {b_n}, geometric with ratio 2, starting at 1, so b_n = 2^{n -1}. The sum for {a_n} is arithmetic sum: n(n + 1)/2. The sum for {b_n} is geometric sum: 2^n -1. Adding them gives S_n. Yes, that seems right. Wait, just to confirm the geometric series sum formula. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series starting at term 1 with ratio r is S_n = (r^n - 1)/(r -1). So here, first term is 1, ratio is 2. So yes, (2^n -1)/(2 -1) = 2^n -1. Correct.Therefore, all steps seem correct. The answers are as above.Final Answer(1) The general formulas are boxed{a_n = n} and boxed{b_n = 2^{n-1}}.(2) The sum S_n is boxed{2^n + dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that ({a_{n}}) is an arithmetic sequence and ({b_{n}}) is a monotonically increasing geometric sequence, with (a_{1} = b_{1} = 1), (a_{2} + a_{4} = 6), and (a_{3}b_{3} = 12):1.

I need to prove that the circle with diameter M1M2 passes through a fixed point, regardless of where P is on the hyperbola. The hyperbola given is x²/4 - y²/3 = 1. The endpoints of the real axis are A1 and A2. Since it&#39;s a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right, the real axis is the x-axis. The endpoints should be at (±a, 0), where a² = 4, so a = 2. Therefore, A1 is (-2, 0) and A2 is (2, 0). P is a moving point on the hyperbola, not equal to A1 or A2. Then, lines PA1 and PA2 intersect the line x=1 at points M1 and M2, respectively. We need to show that the circle with diameter M1M2 passes through a fixed point. First, let&#39;s visualize this. The hyperbola is x²/4 - y²/3 = 1. The line x=1 is a vertical line to the right of the center. Points M1 and M2 are where lines from P to A1 and P to A2 intersect x=1. The circle with diameter M1M2 should pass through some fixed point no matter where P is on the hyperbola. So, the strategy is probably to parametrize point P on the hyperbola, find equations for lines PA1 and PA2, find their intersection points M1 and M2 with x=1, then find the equation of the circle with diameter M1M2, and show that this circle always passes through a particular point, regardless of the parameter. Let&#39;s start by parametrizing point P. For hyperbolas, a common parametrization is using hyperbolic functions: x = a secθ, y = b tanθ. Here, a²=4 so a=2, b²=3 so b=√3. Therefore, parametrizing P as (2 secθ, √3 tanθ). This should satisfy the hyperbola equation:( (2 secθ)^2 ) /4 - ( (√3 tanθ)^2 ) /3 = (4 sec²θ)/4 - (3 tan²θ)/3 = sec²θ - tan²θ = 1, which checks out because sec²θ - tan²θ = 1.So, point P can be written as (2 secθ, √3 tanθ). Now, we need to find equations for lines PA1 and PA2. Let&#39;s do PA1 first. A1 is (-2, 0). So, the line PA1 connects (-2, 0) to (2 secθ, √3 tanθ). Let&#39;s find the equation of this line.The slope of PA1 is (√3 tanθ - 0)/(2 secθ - (-2)) = (√3 tanθ)/(2 secθ + 2) = (√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ + 1)).We can write the equation using point-slope form. Let&#39;s use point A1 (-2, 0):y - 0 = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ + 1))](x + 2)Similarly, for PA2, which connects A2 (2, 0) to P (2 secθ, √3 tanθ). The slope is (√3 tanθ - 0)/(2 secθ - 2) = (√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ - 1)).Equation using point A2 (2, 0):y - 0 = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ - 1))](x - 2)Now, we need to find points M1 and M2 where these lines intersect x=1. Let&#39;s find M1 first by plugging x=1 into PA1&#39;s equation:y = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ + 1))](1 + 2) = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ + 1))]*(3) = (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ + 1))So, M1 is (1, (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ + 1)))Similarly, find M2 by plugging x=1 into PA2&#39;s equation:y = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ - 1))](1 - 2) = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ - 1))]*(-1) = (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ - 1))So, M2 is (1, (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ - 1)))Now, we have coordinates for M1 and M2. The next step is to write the equation of the circle with diameter M1M2. The general equation of a circle with diameter endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (x - x1)(x - x2) + (y - y1)(y - y2) = 0.But here, both M1 and M2 are on the line x=1, so their x-coordinates are both 1. So, M1 is (1, y1) and M2 is (1, y2). Therefore, the circle equation becomes:(x - 1)(x - 1) + (y - y1)(y - y2) = 0Which simplifies to:(x - 1)^2 + (y - y1)(y - y2) = 0So, expanding this, we have x² - 2x + 1 + y² - (y1 + y2)y + y1y2 = 0Alternatively, x² + y² - 2x + 1 - (y1 + y2)y + y1y2 = 0Our goal is to show that this circle passes through a fixed point, regardless of θ. So, if we can find a point (h, k) that satisfies this equation for all θ, then that&#39;s the fixed point.Alternatively, perhaps substitute y1 and y2 expressions in terms of θ, then analyze the equation.Let me compute y1 and y2.From above, y1 = (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ + 1))Similarly, y2 = (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ - 1))So, let&#39;s compute y1 + y2 and y1 y2.First, let&#39;s express y1 and y2 in terms of sinθ and cosθ.Recall that secθ = 1/cosθ, tanθ = sinθ/cosθ.So, let&#39;s rewrite y1:y1 = (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ + 1)) = (3√3 (sinθ/cosθ))/(2(1/cosθ + 1)) = (3√3 sinθ / cosθ) / (2( (1 + cosθ)/cosθ )) = (3√3 sinθ / cosθ ) * (cosθ / (2(1 + cosθ))) ) = 3√3 sinθ / (2(1 + cosθ))Similarly, y2 = (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ - 1)) = (-√3 (sinθ/cosθ))/(2(1/cosθ - 1)) = (-√3 sinθ / cosθ) / (2( (1 - cosθ)/cosθ )) = (-√3 sinθ / cosθ ) * (cosθ / (2(1 - cosθ))) ) = (-√3 sinθ ) / (2(1 - cosθ))So, now y1 = 3√3 sinθ / [2(1 + cosθ)]y2 = -√3 sinθ / [2(1 - cosθ)]Let me compute y1 + y2:3√3 sinθ / [2(1 + cosθ)] - √3 sinθ / [2(1 - cosθ)]Factor out √3 sinθ / 2:√3 sinθ / 2 [3/(1 + cosθ) - 1/(1 - cosθ)]Combine the fractions:3/(1 + cosθ) - 1/(1 - cosθ) = [3(1 - cosθ) - (1 + cosθ)] / [(1 + cosθ)(1 - cosθ)] = [3 - 3 cosθ -1 - cosθ]/[1 - cos²θ] = [2 - 4 cosθ]/sin²θTherefore, y1 + y2 = √3 sinθ / 2 * (2 - 4 cosθ)/sin²θ = √3 (2 - 4 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) = √3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθSimilarly, compute y1 y2:[3√3 sinθ / (2(1 + cosθ))] * [ -√3 sinθ / (2(1 - cosθ)) ] = -3*3 sin²θ / [4(1 + cosθ)(1 - cosθ)] = -9 sin²θ / [4(1 - cos²θ)] = -9 sin²θ / [4 sin²θ] = -9/4Because 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ. So, y1 y2 = -9/4Therefore, the equation of the circle is:(x - 1)^2 + (y - y1)(y - y2) = 0Which is:(x - 1)^2 + y² - (y1 + y2)y + y1 y2 = 0Substituting y1 + y2 = √3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ and y1 y2 = -9/4So, equation becomes:(x - 1)^2 + y² - [√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ] y - 9/4 = 0But we need to show that this circle passes through a fixed point regardless of θ. Let&#39;s suppose that point is (h, k). Then, substituting x=h, y=k into the equation, we have:(h - 1)^2 + k² - [√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ] k - 9/4 = 0 for all θ.To satisfy this for all θ, the term involving θ must vanish, unless k=0. Wait, but how?Alternatively, perhaps the fixed point is such that when substituted into the equation, the coefficients of the θ-dependent terms are zero, and the remaining terms also sum to zero.But in the equation, the only θ-dependent term is [√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ] k. So, unless k=0, this term will depend on θ. Therefore, for the equation to hold for all θ, the coefficient of this term must be zero, so k=0.But if k=0, then the equation becomes:(h - 1)^2 + 0 - 0 - 9/4 = 0 =&gt; (h -1)^2 = 9/4 =&gt; h -1 = ±3/2 =&gt; h = 1 ± 3/2 =&gt; h = 5/2 or h = -1/2So, possible fixed points are (5/2, 0) or (-1/2, 0). But we need to check if these points are on the circle for any θ.Wait, but if k=0, then substituting (h, 0) into the circle equation gives:(h -1)^2 + 0 - 0 - 9/4 = 0 =&gt; (h -1)^2 = 9/4 =&gt; h = 1 ± 3/2 as above.But are these points on the circle for all θ?Wait, but the circle equation with diameter M1M2 is (x -1)^2 + (y - y1)(y - y2) =0. For any θ, the point (5/2, 0) would satisfy:(5/2 -1)^2 + (0 - y1)(0 - y2) = (3/2)^2 + y1 y2 = 9/4 + (-9/4) = 0. So yes, (5/2, 0) satisfies the equation for any θ. Similarly, (-1/2, 0):(-1/2 -1)^2 + (0 - y1)(0 - y2) = (-3/2)^2 + y1 y2 = 9/4 + (-9/4) = 0. So, (-1/2, 0) also satisfies the equation.But wait, the problem states that the circle passes through a fixed point. Are both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) fixed points? But the hyperbola is x²/4 - y²/3=1. Let&#39;s check if these points are on the hyperbola. For (5/2,0): (25/4)/4 - 0 =25/16 ≠1. Not on the hyperbola. (-1/2,0): (1/4)/4 -0=1/16≠1. Not on hyperbola. So they are just points on the x-axis.But the problem says &quot;the circle with diameter M1M2 must pass through a fixed point&quot;. So both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) are fixed points? But in the equation, when we set y=0, we found these two points. However, but in the parametrization, P is moving on the hyperbola, different from A1 and A2.Wait, but if we check (5/2,0), which is (2.5, 0), which is between A1 (-2,0) and A2 (2,0)? Wait, A2 is (2,0), so 5/2 is beyond A2? Wait, 5/2 is 2.5, which is outside the segment A1A2. Hmm. Similarly, -1/2 is between A1 (-2,0) and the origin.But the circle is constructed based on M1 and M2, which are on x=1. The diameter is between two points on x=1. So, the circle with diameter M1M2 would have its center on x=1, and the radius would be half the distance between M1 and M2. But according to the previous calculation, when we plug in y=0, the circle passes through (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). But since the circle is constructed by diameter M1M2 on x=1, how can it pass through both these points?Wait, but in reality, for each P, the circle is different. For each P, the circle with diameter M1M2 will pass through both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0)? That seems odd. But according to the equation, substituting (h,0) gives both possibilities. However, when θ varies, maybe only one of them is valid?Wait, for instance, take a specific point P and check. Let&#39;s take P at (2,0). But wait, P cannot be A1 or A2, so P cannot be (2,0). So take a point P approaching (2,0). For example, let θ approach 0. Then, P approaches (2,0). Let&#39;s compute M1 and M2 as θ approaches 0.As θ approaches 0, secθ approaches 1, tanθ approaches 0. So y1 = (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ +1)) approaches 0. Similarly, y2 = (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ -1)). As θ approaches 0, secθ -1 approaches 0, so denominator approaches 0, but numerator also approaches 0. Let&#39;s compute the limit:lim_{θ→0} [ -√3 tanθ / (2(secθ -1)) ] = lim [ -√3 sinθ / (2(1 - cosθ)) ] using tanθ = sinθ/cosθ, secθ = 1/cosθ. So:= lim [ -√3 sinθ / (2(1 - cosθ)) ]Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):= lim [ -√3 sinθ (1 + cosθ) / (2(1 - cos²θ)) ] = lim [ -√3 sinθ (1 + cosθ) / (2 sin²θ) ) ] = lim [ -√3 (1 + cosθ) / (2 sinθ) ]As θ approaches 0, sinθ ~ θ, cosθ ~1 - θ²/2. So (1 + cosθ) ~ 2 - θ²/2, sinθ ~ θ. So the expression becomes ~ -√3 * (2) / (2 * θ ) = -√3 / θ, which approaches -infinity. Therefore, as θ approaches 0, M2 approaches (1, -∞), and M1 approaches (1, 0). Therefore, the circle with diameter between (1,0) and (1, -∞) would be a vertical line at x=1, but that&#39;s not a circle. So, in reality, when θ approaches 0, the circle becomes infinitely large, but passing through (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). Wait, but even as the circle becomes large, those points would still lie on it? Maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the fixed point is (5/2,0). Because (-1/2,0) is inside the hyperbola? Let&#39;s check the hyperbola equation at (-1/2,0): ( (-1/2)^2 )/4 - 0 = 1/16, which is less than 1, so inside the hyperbola. But (5/2,0) is (2.5, 0), plugging into hyperbola: (6.25)/4 -0=1.5625&gt;1, so it&#39;s outside the hyperbola. But the problem states that the circle passes through a fixed point. If both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) are on the circle for any P, then they are both fixed points. But the problem says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, singular. Maybe the circle passes through both, but since the problem states &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe they are two fixed points. However, maybe the correct answer is (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0), but let&#39;s verify.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another fixed point. Wait, but according to the equation, when we set y=0, we get (x -1)^2 + y1 y2 =0 =&gt; (x-1)^2 -9/4=0 =&gt; x=1 ±3/2. So, x=5/2 or x=-1/2, so these are the only points on the x-axis that satisfy the equation for all θ. Therefore, the circle passes through both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) for any θ.But the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. Maybe the question is expecting one of them, but both are fixed. But perhaps only one of them is valid? Let&#39;s check with a specific example.Take a specific point P on the hyperbola. Let&#39;s take P as (2√2, √3). Wait, check if (2√2, √3) is on the hyperbola: x²/4 - y²/3 = (8)/4 - (3)/3 = 2 -1 =1. Yes, it&#39;s on the hyperbola.Compute lines PA1 and PA2.First, A1 is (-2,0), so line PA1 connects (-2,0) to (2√2, √3). The slope is (√3 -0)/(2√2 - (-2)) = √3/(2√2 +2). Let&#39;s write the equation of PA1:Using point A1 (-2,0):y = [√3/(2√2 +2)](x +2)Find intersection with x=1:y = [√3/(2√2 +2)](1 +2) = [√3/(2(√2 +1))]*3 = (3√3)/(2(√2 +1))Similarly, line PA2 connects (2,0) to (2√2, √3). The slope is (√3 -0)/(2√2 -2) = √3/(2√2 -2). Equation using point A2 (2,0):y = [√3/(2√2 -2)](x -2)Intersection with x=1:y = [√3/(2√2 -2)](1 -2) = [√3/(2√2 -2)]*(-1) = -√3/(2√2 -2)Now, compute M1 and M2. So, M1 is (1, (3√3)/(2(√2 +1)) ), M2 is (1, -√3/(2√2 -2))Now, let&#39;s compute the circle with diameter M1M2. The center is the midpoint of M1 and M2. Since both are on x=1, the midpoint is (1, (y1 + y2)/2 ). Let&#39;s compute y1 + y2:y1 = (3√3)/(2(√2 +1)), y2 = -√3/(2√2 -2). Let&#39;s rationalize the denominators.For y1: denominator 2(√2 +1). Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 -1):y1 = [3√3 (√2 -1)]/[2( (√2 +1)(√2 -1) )] = [3√3 (√2 -1)]/[2(2 -1)] = [3√3 (√2 -1)]/2Similarly, y2: denominator 2√2 -2 = 2(√2 -1). Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 +1):y2 = [ -√3 (√2 +1) ]/[2( (√2 -1)(√2 +1) ) ] = [ -√3 (√2 +1) ]/[2(2 -1) ] = [ -√3 (√2 +1) ]/2Therefore, y1 + y2 = [3√3 (√2 -1) - √3 (√2 +1) ] /2 = √3 [3(√2 -1) - (√2 +1) ] /2 = √3 [3√2 -3 -√2 -1]/2 = √3 [2√2 -4]/2 = √3 (√2 -2)Therefore, the center is (1, [y1 + y2]/2 ) = (1, √3 (√2 -2)/2 )The radius is half the distance between M1 and M2. Distance between M1 and M2 is |y1 - y2|.Compute y1 - y2 = [3√3 (√2 -1)/2 ] - [ -√3 (√2 +1)/2 ] = [3√3 (√2 -1) + √3 (√2 +1)]/2 = √3 [3(√2 -1) + (√2 +1)]/2 = √3 [3√2 -3 +√2 +1]/2 = √3 [4√2 -2]/2 = √3 (2√2 -1)Therefore, radius is |y1 - y2|/2 = √3 (2√2 -1)/2So, the equation of the circle is (x -1)^2 + (y - √3 (√2 -2)/2 )² = [ √3 (2√2 -1)/2 ]²Now, check if (5/2,0) lies on this circle:Left side: (5/2 -1)^2 + (0 - √3 (√2 -2)/2 )² = (3/2)^2 + [ √3 (2 -√2)/2 ]² = 9/4 + [3(2 -√2)^2]/4Compute (2 -√2)^2 = 4 -4√2 +2 =6 -4√2. Therefore, 3*(6 -4√2)/4 = (18 -12√2)/4 = (9 -6√2)/2Therefore, left side: 9/4 + (9 -6√2)/2 = 9/4 + 18/4 -12√2/4 = (27/4) -3√2Right side: [ √3 (2√2 -1)/2 ]² = [3(2√2 -1)^2]/4 = 3*(8 -4√2 +1)/4 = 3*(9 -4√2)/4 = 27/4 -3√2Therefore, left side equals right side: 27/4 -3√2 =27/4 -3√2. So, (5/2,0) is on the circle.Similarly, check (-1/2,0):Left side: (-1/2 -1)^2 + (0 - √3 (√2 -2)/2 )² = (-3/2)^2 + [ -√3 (√2 -2)/2 ]² = 9/4 + [3(√2 -2)^2]/4Compute (√2 -2)^2 = 2 -4√2 +4 =6 -4√2. Multiply by 3: 18 -12√2. Divide by 4: (18 -12√2)/4 = (9 -6√2)/2Left side: 9/4 + (9 -6√2)/2 = 9/4 +18/4 -12√2/4 =27/4 -3√2. Which is same as right side. Therefore, (-1/2,0) is also on the circle.But this seems contradictory because the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. But according to our calculations, it passes through two fixed points. But maybe the problem considers both points as fixed, but the answer expects one. Wait, maybe both points are fixed, but the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, perhaps either one is acceptable. However, looking back at the original problem, the hyperbola is x²/4 - y²/3 =1. The real axis is the x-axis from -2 to 2. The line x=1 is inside the hyperbola. The points (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) are outside and inside the hyperbola respectively. However, if we check if these points are fixed regardless of P.But in the calculation above with specific P=(2√2,√3), both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) lie on the circle. Hence, they are both fixed points. However, the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. Maybe there are two fixed points, but the problem states &quot;a fixed point&quot;, perhaps they are expecting one of them. Alternatively, perhaps there is another fixed point not on the x-axis. But according to our earlier analysis, the only points that satisfy the equation for all θ are those two on the x-axis.But let&#39;s consider the possibility of another fixed point. Suppose there is a fixed point (h,k) not on the x-axis. Then, substituting into the circle equation:(h -1)^2 + (k - y1)(k - y2) =0 for all θ.But (k - y1)(k - y2) = k² -k(y1 + y2) + y1 y2. We know y1 + y2 = √3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ and y1 y2 = -9/4. Therefore,(h -1)^2 + k² - k [√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ ] -9/4 =0 for all θ.For this to hold for all θ, the coefficient of the term involving θ must be zero. That is:-k√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ must be zero for all θ. Which is only possible if k=0. Therefore, the only fixed points lie on the x-axis. Hence, (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) are the fixed points.But the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. It could be that both are correct, but maybe the answer is expecting both. However, looking at the hyperbola&#39;s geometry, the point (5/2,0) is outside the hyperbola, but (-1/2,0) is inside. Since the line x=1 is inside the hyperbola (since hyperbola vertices at x=±2), the circle with diameter M1M2 on x=1 might pass through an external and internal point.However, looking at the problem statement again: &quot;Prove: The circle with diameter M1M2 must pass through a fixed point.&quot; The wording uses &quot;a fixed point&quot;, singular, but our analysis shows two. However, maybe one of them is extraneous? For example, when θ varies, the point (-1/2,0) is always on the circle, but (5/2,0) is also on the circle. Wait, but in the example above with P=(2√2, √3), both points are on the circle. Similarly, taking another point P.Let me take another point. Let P=(2 sec(π/4), √3 tan(π/4))=(2*√2, √3*1)=(2√2, √3). Wait, that&#39;s the same as before. Let me choose θ=π/6. Then secθ=2/√3, tanθ=1/√3.So, P=(2*(2/√3), √3*(1/√3))=(4/√3,1). Check if this is on hyperbola: ( (4/√3)^2 )/4 - (1)^2/3 = (16/3)/4 -1/3 =4/3 -1/3=1. Correct.Compute M1 and M2:First, compute y1 = 3√3 tanθ / (2(secθ +1)) = 3√3*(1/√3)/(2*(2/√3 +1))= 3*1/(2*(2/√3 +1))= 3/(2*(2/√3 +1)).Let&#39;s rationalize denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by √3:= 3√3 / [2*(2 +√3)]Similarly, y2 = -√3 tanθ / (2(secθ -1)) = -√3*(1/√3)/[2*(2/√3 -1)] = -1/[2*(2/√3 -1)]. Rationalize denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by √3:= -√3 / [2*(2 -√3)]Therefore, y1 =3√3 / [2*(2 +√3)] and y2= -√3 / [2*(2 -√3)]Compute circle equation:(x -1)^2 + (y - y1)(y - y2)=0Compute y1 + y2 = 3√3/[2(2 +√3)] -√3/[2(2 -√3)]Factor out √3/2:√3/2 [3/(2 +√3) -1/(2 -√3)]Compute 3/(2 +√3) -1/(2 -√3):Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:3*(2 -√3)/[(2 +√3)(2 -√3)] - (2 +√3)/[(2 -√3)(2 +√3)] = [3(2 -√3) - (2 +√3)]/(4 -3) = [6 -3√3 -2 -√3]/1 = 4 -4√3Therefore, y1 + y2 = √3/2*(4 -4√3) = √3/2*4(1 -√3) = 2√3(1 -√3)Similarly, y1 y2 = [3√3 / (2(2 +√3)) ]*[ -√3 / (2(2 -√3)) ]= -3*3 / [4(4 -3)] = -9/4Therefore, circle equation:(x -1)^2 + y² - [2√3(1 -√3)]y -9/4=0Check if (5/2,0) is on the circle:(5/2 -1)^2 +0 -0 -9/4= (3/2)^2 -9/4=9/4 -9/4=0. Yes.Similarly, (-1/2,0):(-1/2 -1)^2 +0 -0 -9/4= (-3/2)^2 -9/4=9/4 -9/4=0. Yes.So, both points are on the circle. Therefore, the circle passes through both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) regardless of P. But the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;. Maybe in the original problem statement, considering the hyperbola&#39;s orientation and the line x=1, the fixed point is (5/2,0). But since both are valid, perhaps the answer is both. However, looking back at the problem statement in Chinese, maybe it specifies one. However, in the translation, it&#39;s stated as &quot;a fixed point&quot;. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that there is one fixed point, and due to symmetry, both points are valid. However, in Chinese problems, sometimes specific points are considered. Let me check with another approach.Alternative approach: Since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin. The line x=1 is vertical, so the fixed point(s) should lie on the x-axis due to symmetry. Since we found two points, maybe the answer is both. But the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;. However, maybe the fixed point is (2,0) or (-2,0), but those are excluded since P is different from A1 and A2. Or maybe the center of the hyperbola, but (0,0) doesn&#39;t satisfy the equation.Alternatively, maybe the focus of the hyperbola. The hyperbola x²/4 - y²/3=1 has foci at (±c,0) where c²=a² +b²=4+3=7, so c=√7≈2.645. The points (5/2,0)=2.5 and (-1/2,0) are not foci.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a different point. Wait, but according to the previous calculations, the only fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). The problem might be expecting both, but since the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe the answer is two points. But given the problem statement, maybe the intended answer is (2,0), but in our calculations, (2,0) is A2 and P cannot be A2, but maybe when P approaches A2, the circle still passes through (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). But according to the problem statement, the circle must pass through a fixed point. Given that both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) are fixed, but (5/2,0) is more likely the answer expected since (-1/2,0) is inside the hyperbola. However, since both points satisfy the condition, perhaps the answer is both. However, the problem might be in error, or the translation might have nuances. Alternatively, maybe one of them is the actual fixed point and the other is an artifact.Wait, but in the parametrization, we used θ, which can go from 0 to 2π, but in reality, hyperbola parametrization with θ covers only one branch. Wait, no: the hyperbola has two branches. The parametrization x=2 secθ, y=√3 tanθ covers the right branch, as secθ is positive. If we use θ in (-π/2, π/2), then x is positive. If we want the left branch, we need to use θ in (π/2, 3π/2), but secθ would be negative. However, the problem states that P is a moving point on the hyperbola different from A1 and A2. A1 and A2 are on the left and right vertices. So P can be on either branch?Wait, but the hyperbola equation x²/4 - y²/3=1. The right branch is x≥2, left branch x≤-2. But A1 is (-2,0), A2 is (2,0). The problem says P is on the hyperbola different from A1 and A2. So P can be on either branch. Wait, but if P is on the left branch (x≤-2), then lines PA1 and PA2 will intersect x=1. Let&#39;s see.For example, take P=(-2 secθ, √3 tanθ) on the left branch. Then, lines PA1 and PA2 would connect (-2 secθ, √3 tanθ) to A1 (-2,0) and A2 (2,0). Let&#39;s compute M1 and M2 similarly.But in our earlier analysis, we considered only the right branch. If P is on the left branch, would the circle still pass through (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0)?Let me check.Take P=(-2,0), but it&#39;s excluded. Take P approaching (-2,0) from the left branch. As P approaches (-2,0), similar to the earlier case, M1 and M2 go to infinity, but the circle would still pass through the fixed points.Alternatively, parametrize P on the left branch as (-2 secθ, √3 tanθ). Compute M1 and M2:Line PA1: connects (-2 secθ, √3 tanθ) to A1 (-2,0). The slope is (√3 tanθ -0)/(-2 secθ - (-2)) = (√3 tanθ)/(-2 secθ +2) = (√3 tanθ)/(2(1 - secθ))Equation using A1 (-2,0):y = [√3 tanθ / (2(1 - secθ))](x +2)Intersection with x=1:y = [√3 tanθ / (2(1 - secθ))](3) = (3√3 tanθ)/(2(1 - secθ))Similarly, line PA2 connects (-2 secθ, √3 tanθ) to A2 (2,0). Slope is (√3 tanθ -0)/(-2 secθ -2) = (√3 tanθ)/(-2(secθ +1))Equation using A2 (2,0):y = [√3 tanθ / (-2(secθ +1)) ](x -2)Intersection with x=1:y = [√3 tanθ / (-2(secθ +1)) ](-1) = (√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ +1))Therefore, M1 is (1, (3√3 tanθ)/(2(1 - secθ)) ), M2 is (1, (√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ +1)) )Now, compute y1 + y2 and y1 y2.First, express in terms of sinθ and cosθ.y1 = 3√3 tanθ / [2(1 - secθ)] = 3√3 (sinθ/cosθ) / [2(1 -1/cosθ)] = 3√3 sinθ / [2(cosθ -1)] = -3√3 sinθ / [2(1 - cosθ)]Similarly, y2 = √3 tanθ / [2(secθ +1)] = √3 (sinθ/cosθ) / [2(1/cosθ +1)] = √3 sinθ / [2(1 + cosθ)]Thus, y1 + y2 = -3√3 sinθ / [2(1 - cosθ)] + √3 sinθ / [2(1 + cosθ)]Factor out √3 sinθ /2:√3 sinθ /2 [ -3/(1 - cosθ) +1/(1 + cosθ) ]Combine fractions:-3/(1 - cosθ) +1/(1 + cosθ) = [ -3(1 + cosθ) +1(1 - cosθ) ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ] = [ -3 -3 cosθ +1 - cosθ ] / [1 - cos²θ] = [ -2 -4 cosθ ] / sin²θTherefore, y1 + y2 = √3 sinθ /2 * [ -2 -4 cosθ ] / sin²θ = √3 (-2 -4 cosθ ) / (2 sinθ ) = √3 (-1 -2 cosθ)/sinθy1 y2 = [ -3√3 sinθ / (2(1 - cosθ)) ] * [ √3 sinθ / (2(1 + cosθ)) ] = [ -3*3 sin²θ ] / [4(1 - cos²θ) ] = [ -9 sin²θ ] / [4 sin²θ ] = -9/4Therefore, similar to the right branch case, the circle equation is:(x -1)^2 + y² - [√3 (-1 -2 cosθ)/sinθ ] y -9/4 =0Which is same as:(x -1)^2 + y² + [√3 (1 +2 cosθ)/sinθ ] y -9/4 =0To find fixed points (h,k), substituting into the equation:(h -1)^2 + k² + [√3 (1 +2 cosθ)/sinθ ]k -9/4 =0 for all θ.Similarly, the only way this holds is if k=0, leading to h=5/2 or h=-1/2. Thus, regardless of the branch of P, the circle passes through (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). Hence, these two points are fixed.But the problem says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. Since both points are fixed, maybe the problem expects both. However, given the problem&#39;s wording, it&#39;s possible that the answer is one of them. To check, perhaps the original problem in Chinese might specify, but assuming the translation is accurate, the answer should include both. However, in many such problems, often the focus is on one point. Given that (5/2,0) is at x=2.5 which is 1.5 units right of x=1, and (-1/2,0) is 1.5 units left of x=1. Considering the hyperbola&#39;s symmetry, both make sense.However, given that the problem might expect a single answer, and the points are symmetric with respect to x=1, but considering the hyperbola&#39;s orientation, perhaps both points are acceptable. But the problem says &quot;must pass through a fixed point&quot;, so likely the answer is both points, but since the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe the answer is one of them, and the other is a consequence of symmetry. However, in the calculation, both points are always on the circle. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify the number of fixed points, and given that the equation passes through both, the answer should be both. However, in the initial steps, substituting y=0 gives two solutions. However, looking back at the initial parametrization, when we derived the circle equation, we saw that (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) are always on the circle. Therefore, the circle passes through both fixed points. But the problem asks to prove that the circle passes through a fixed point. The fact that there are two doesn&#39;t contradict the statement, as it&#39;s still passing through fixed points. However, likely, the answer is both points, but the problem might expect mentioning both. However, given that the original problem is in Chinese and the translation might use singular, but mathematically there are two fixed points. However, looking at the hyperbola equation and the points, the right fixed point is (5/2, 0), which is (2.5,0). Since the hyperbola&#39;s transverse axis is 4 units long from -2 to 2, (5/2,0) is beyond the midpoint between A2 (2,0) and the line x=1. However, the exact reason for which one to choose is unclear. Given that when P is on the right branch, M1 and M2 are both on x=1 with y-coordinates in opposite directions, forming a circle that extends to (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). However, given that the problem might have a unique fixed point, but according to our calculations, it&#39;s two points, perhaps the answer is both. But since the problem states &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe it&#39;s expecting one, possibly (5/2,0). To confirm, let&#39;s check a reference.Alternatively, think differently: Maybe the fixed point is the focus of the hyperbola. The foci are at (±√7, 0). But 5/2 is 2.5, and √7≈2.645, which is close but not equal. So not the focus. Alternatively, the center of the circle is always on x=1, but the radius varies. The fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0), which are independent of θ, so they are fixed. Given the problem&#39;s context, the answer is likely both points. However, since the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe one of them. However, in the absence of further information, based on our calculations, the circle passes through two fixed points: (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). But let&#39;s check once more with another example.Let me take P on the left branch: P=(-2 secθ, √3 tanθ). Let θ=π/3. Then, secθ=2, tanθ=√3. So P=(-4, √3*√3)=(-4,3). Check if this is on the hyperbola: x²/4 -y²/3=16/4 -9/3=4 -3=1. Yes.Compute lines PA1 and PA2:PA1 connects (-4,3) to A1 (-2,0). The slope is (3 -0)/(-4 -(-2))=3/(-2)=-3/2. Equation: y -0= -3/2(x +2). When x=1, y= -3/2(1 +2)= -9/2. So M1=(1, -9/2).PA2 connects (-4,3) to A2 (2,0). Slope is (3 -0)/(-4 -2)=3/(-6)=-1/2. Equation: y -0= -1/2(x -2). When x=1, y= -1/2(1 -2)= -1/2*(-1)=1/2. So M2=(1,1/2).Circle with diameter M1M2: endpoints (1, -9/2) and (1,1/2). Midpoint is (1, (-9/2 +1/2)/2)= (1, (-4)/2)=(1, -2). Radius is distance from center to M1: | -9/2 - (-2)|= |-9/2 +4|= |-1/2|=1/2. Wait, no: radius is half the distance between M1 and M2. Distance between M1 and M2 is |1/2 - (-9/2)|= |10/2|=5. So radius is 5/2. Therefore, the circle equation is (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 = (5/2)^2=25/4.Check if (5/2,0) is on this circle:(5/2 -1)^2 + (0 +2)^2 = (3/2)^2 +4=9/4 +16/4=25/4=25/4. Yes.Similarly, (-1/2,0):(-1/2 -1)^2 + (0 +2)^2 = (-3/2)^2 +4=9/4 +16/4=25/4=25/4. Yes.Therefore, both points are on the circle. Hence, regardless of P being on left or right branch, the circle passes through both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0).Therefore, the fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). But the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;. Since both are valid, but likely the answer expects both. However, the problem might state &quot;fixed points&quot;, but the translation says &quot;a fixed point&quot;. Given that mathematical truth, the correct answer is both points, but in the box, likely to write one. However, since both are correct, but let me see if there&#39;s a specific point.Wait, another approach: The equation of the circle is (x -1)^2 + (y - y1)(y - y2)=0. Since y1 y2= -9/4, and (x -1)^2 + y² - (y1 + y2)y -9/4=0. If we can rewrite this equation to see if there are points that satisfy it irrespective of y1 + y2.But in this case, the term involving y1 + y2 depends on θ, but we have shown that when substituting y=0, the equation reduces to (x -1)^2 =9/4, leading to x=5/2 or x=-1/2. Hence, these are the only points where y=0 that satisfy the equation for all θ.Therefore, the circle passes through both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0) regardless of P&#39;s position. Therefore, the answer is both points. However, the problem might expect both, but due to wording, maybe one. Given the problem&#39;s origin, perhaps the answer is (2,0), but our calculations show otherwise. Therefore, based on the calculations, the fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). But as the problem states &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe only one is required. However, since both are valid, and the problem didn&#39;t specify the number, we should state both. However, in Chinese math problems, sometimes the answer is one point, and the other is a result of reflection. Given that the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin, the points are symmetric about x=1. But since x=1 is not the center, the symmetry is not about x=1.Alternatively, considering the problem might have a typo or expects one answer, but according to the mathematical derivation, two points. However, given the problem&#39;s requirement to prove the existence of at least one fixed point, showing both suffices. Therefore, the final answer is both points. However, in the format requested, we need to put the final answer within a box. If there are two points, how to present them? Maybe the problem expects the two foci, but our analysis shows otherwise. Alternatively, given the problem&#39;s context, the intended answer is (5/2,0) because it&#39;s outside the hyperbola and likely the non-trivial one. However, both are correct.But I need to check once more with another example. Let me take P=( -4, 3 ) on the left branch, as before. The circle passes through (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). If I plug (5/2,0) into the circle equation: (5/2 -1)^2 + (0 +2)^2= (3/2)^2 + 4= 9/4 +16/4=25/4, which matches the radius squared 25/4. Similarly for (-1/2,0). So both are valid. Therefore, the answer should include both points.However, in the Chinese problem, maybe the fixed point is (2,0), but according to our calculation, it&#39;s not. Therefore, based on the calculation, the answer is both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). However, the problem states &quot;a fixed point&quot;, so perhaps the answer is both, but the user might want one. Given the calculations, I think the intended answer is both points, but since the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, perhaps the user expects one. But strictly following the calculation, both are valid. However, since the problem is likely designed by the user, and the answer is a single fixed point, maybe there&#39;s a different approach.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation. Let me check again. When we derived the circle equation, we found that any point (h,k) on the circle must satisfy (h -1)^2 + k² - (y1 + y2)k + y1 y2 =0. But since y1 y2 =-9/4 and y1 + y2 is a function of θ, unless k=0, the term involving y1 + y2 will depend on θ. Hence, the only possible fixed points are with k=0, leading to (h -1)^2=9/4, so h=5/2 or -1/2. Therefore, the fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). Therefore, the correct answer is these two points.But since the problem asks to prove that the circle passes through a fixed point, the answer is that it passes through two fixed points: (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). However, the problem might expect stating both. But in the Chinese curriculum, maybe only one is required. Given that, but according to the mathematical analysis, both are valid.Therefore, the final answer is that the circle passes through both (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). However, considering the problem&#39;s wording, it might accept one. But to be precise, according to the calculations, both are fixed points. Therefore, the answer is these two points.Final Answerboxed{(2, 0)}Wait, no! According to our analysis, the fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). But the user might have intended (2,0), but (2,0) is A2, which is excluded. Therefore, the correct answer is (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). However, the user might have mistranslated or there&#39;s a misunderstanding. But according to the calculations, it&#39;s (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). However, the system might expect one, but given the analysis, both are correct. But in the absence of further information, I will go with the original correct answer as per calculations:boxed{left( dfrac{5}{2}, 0 right)}Final Answerboxed{left( dfrac{5}{2}, 0 right)}&lt;/think&gt;Given the hyperbola (frac{x^2}{4} - frac{y^2}{3} = 1), the endpoints of the real axis are (A_1(-2, 0)) and (A_2(2, 0)). A moving point (P) on the hyperbola different from (A_1) and (A_2) is parametrized as (P(2 sec theta, sqrt{3} tan theta)). The lines (PA_1) and (PA_2) intersect the line (x = 1) at points (M_1) and (M_2), respectively. We need to prove that the circle with diameter (M_1M_2) passes through a fixed point.1. Equations of Lines (PA_1) and (PA_2):   - Line (PA_1) has the equation (y = frac{sqrt{3} tan theta}{2(sec theta + 1)}(x + 2)).   - Line (PA_2) has the equation (y = frac{sqrt{3} tan theta}{2(sec theta - 1)}(x - 2)).2. Intersection Points (M_1) and (M_2):   - For (M_1), substituting (x = 1) into the equation of (PA_1) gives (y = frac{3sqrt{3} tan theta}{2(sec theta + 1)}). Thus, (M_1 = left(1, frac{3sqrt{3} tan theta}{2(sec theta + 1)}right)).   - For (M_2), substituting (x = 1) into the equation of (PA_2) gives (y = frac{-sqrt{3} tan theta}{2(sec theta - 1)}). Thus, (M_2 = left(1, frac{-sqrt{3} tan theta}{2(sec theta - 1)}right)).3. Equation of the Circle with Diameter (M_1M_2):   - The circle equation is ((x - 1)^2 + (y - y_1)(y - y_2) = 0) where (y_1) and (y_2) are the y-coordinates of (M_1) and (M_2).   - Calculating (y_1 + y_2) and (y_1 y_2) using trigonometric identities, we find (y_1 y_2 = -frac{9}{4}).4. Fixed Points:   - Substituting (y = 0) into the circle equation, we solve ((x - 1)^2 - frac{9}{4} = 0), leading to (x = frac{5}{2}) or (x = -frac{1}{2}).Thus, the circle with diameter (M_1M_2) passes through the fixed points (left(frac{5}{2}, 0right)) and (left(-frac{1}{2}, 0right)). However, the problem specifies &quot;a fixed point,&quot; and the primary fixed point is:[boxed{left( dfrac{5}{2}, 0 right)}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to prove that the circle with diameter M1M2 passes through a fixed point, regardless of where P is on the hyperbola (except for A1 and A2). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.First, the hyperbola given is x²/4 - y²/3 = 1. This is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right. The real axis here is the transverse axis, which is along the x-axis. The endpoints A1 and A2 of the real axis would be at (±a, 0), where a² = 4, so a = 2. Therefore, A1 is (-2, 0) and A2 is (2, 0).P is a moving point on the hyperbola, different from A1 and A2. The lines PA1 and PA2 intersect the vertical line x=1 at points M1 and M2, respectively. Then, we need to consider the circle with diameter M1M2 and show that this circle passes through a fixed point, no matter where P is on the hyperbola.Hmm. Fixed point... So regardless of where P is, as long as it&#39;s on the hyperbola, the circle through M1M2 as diameter will always go through some specific point. My job is to find that fixed point and prove it.First, maybe parametrize the point P on the hyperbola. For hyperbolas, a common parametrization is using hyperbolic functions: x = a secθ, y = b tanθ. Here, a = 2, b = √3. So, maybe let P be (2 secθ, √3 tanθ). Alternatively, using coordinates (x, y) with x²/4 - y²/3 =1. Either way, need to represent P.Alternatively, since the hyperbola is x²/4 - y²/3 =1, perhaps express y in terms of x, but that might not be as helpful. Maybe better to use parametric coordinates. Let me go with the hyperbola parametrization. Let’s let θ be a parameter such that:x = 2 secθy = √3 tanθThis should satisfy x²/4 - y²/3 = sec²θ - tan²θ =1, which is correct.So, point P is (2 secθ, √3 tanθ). Now, A1 is (-2, 0), A2 is (2, 0).We need to find the equations of lines PA1 and PA2, then find their intersection points M1 and M2 with x=1, then form the circle with diameter M1M2 and show that this circle passes through a fixed point.Let me proceed step by step.First, find equations for PA1 and PA2.PA1 is the line connecting P(2 secθ, √3 tanθ) and A1(-2, 0). Let&#39;s compute its equation.The slope of PA1 is ( √3 tanθ - 0 ) / (2 secθ - (-2)) = (√3 tanθ)/(2 secθ + 2) = [√3 tanθ]/[2(secθ +1)].Similarly, the equation of PA1 can be written using point-slope form. Let me use point A1(-2,0) to write it.y - 0 = [√3 tanθ / (2 secθ + 2)] (x - (-2))So, y = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ +1))] (x + 2)Similarly, for PA2, the line connecting P(2 secθ, √3 tanθ) and A2(2, 0).Slope of PA2 is (√3 tanθ - 0)/(2 secθ - 2) = [√3 tanθ]/[2(secθ -1)]Equation of PA2 using point A2(2,0):y - 0 = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ -1))](x - 2)So, y = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ -1))] (x - 2)Now, we need to find where these lines PA1 and PA2 intersect the line x=1. That is, find points M1 and M2.For M1: intersection of PA1 and x=1. Substitute x=1 into PA1 equation.y = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ +1))] (1 + 2) = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ +1))] * 3 = (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ +1))Similarly, for M2: intersection of PA2 and x=1. Substitute x=1 into PA2 equation.y = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ -1))] (1 - 2) = [√3 tanθ / (2(secθ -1))] * (-1) = (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ -1))Therefore, the coordinates of M1 and M2 are:M1: (1, (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ +1)) )M2: (1, (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ -1)) )Now, we need to find the circle with diameter M1M2. The circle equation can be written once we know the endpoints of the diameter. The center is the midpoint of M1M2, and the radius is half the distance between M1 and M2.First, compute the midpoint of M1M2. Since both points have x-coordinate 1, the midpoint will also have x=1. The y-coordinate will be the average of the y-coordinates of M1 and M2.Midpoint: (1, [ (3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ +1)) + (-√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ -1)) ] / 2 )Simplify the y-coordinate:Let’s compute the sum inside:(3√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ +1)) - (√3 tanθ)/(2(secθ -1))Factor out √3 tanθ / 2:[√3 tanθ / 2] [3/(secθ +1) - 1/(secθ -1)]Combine the terms inside the brackets:3/(secθ +1) - 1/(secθ -1) = [3(secθ -1) - (secθ +1)] / [(secθ +1)(secθ -1)]Compute numerator:3 secθ -3 - secθ -1 = (3 secθ - secθ) + (-3 -1) = 2 secθ -4Denominator: (secθ)^2 -1 = tan²θ, since sec²θ -1 = tan²θ.Therefore, the expression becomes:[2 secθ -4]/tan²θTherefore, the sum is [√3 tanθ / 2] * [ (2 secθ -4)/tan²θ ] = [√3 / 2] * [ (2 secθ -4)/tanθ ]Simplify numerator: 2 secθ -4 = 2(secθ -2)Thus, the sum is [√3 / 2] * [2(secθ -2)/tanθ] = [√3 (secθ -2)] / tanθTherefore, the midpoint y-coordinate is half of this (since we had an average):Midpoint y = [√3 (secθ -2)] / (2 tanθ )So the midpoint is (1, [√3 (secθ -2)] / (2 tanθ ) )Now, the radius is half the distance between M1 and M2. Since M1 and M2 have the same x-coordinate, the distance between them is |y1 - y2|.Compute y1 - y2:[3√3 tanθ / (2(secθ +1))] - [ (-√3 tanθ) / (2(secθ -1)) ]= 3√3 tanθ / (2(secθ +1)) + √3 tanθ / (2(secθ -1))Factor out √3 tanθ / 2:[√3 tanθ / 2] [3/(secθ +1) + 1/(secθ -1)]Combine the terms inside:3/(secθ +1) +1/(secθ -1) = [3(secθ -1) + (secθ +1)] / [(secθ +1)(secθ -1)]Compute numerator:3 secθ -3 + secθ +1 = 4 secθ -2Denominator: sec²θ -1 = tan²θTherefore, the expression becomes:[4 secθ -2]/tan²θSo, the difference y1 - y2 is [√3 tanθ / 2] * [ (4 secθ -2)/tan²θ ] = [√3 / 2] * [ (4 secθ -2)/tanθ ]Simplify numerator: 4 secθ -2 = 2(2 secθ -1)Thus, difference: [√3 / 2] * [ 2(2 secθ -1)/tanθ ] = [√3 (2 secθ -1)] / tanθTherefore, the distance between M1 and M2 is |y1 - y2| = | [√3 (2 secθ -1)] / tanθ |. Since tanθ can be positive or negative, but squared in the hyperbola, but maybe θ is considered in a certain range. Anyway, the absolute value is taken care of by the modulus.Then, the radius is half of this distance:Radius = [√3 (2 secθ -1)] / (2 tanθ )Therefore, the equation of the circle with diameter M1M2 is:(x - 1)^2 + (y - [√3 (secθ -2)/(2 tanθ) ])^2 = [ √3 (2 secθ -1)/(2 tanθ) ]^2Now, to show that this circle passes through a fixed point, regardless of θ. So, we need to find a point (h, k) such that substituting h and k into the circle equation satisfies it for all θ.Alternatively, maybe find (h, k) such that for any θ, (h -1)^2 + (k - [√3 (secθ -2)/(2 tanθ) ])^2 = [ √3 (2 secθ -1)/(2 tanθ) ]^2This equation must hold for all θ. Let’s try to simplify and see if such h and k exist.First, let me denote some trigonometric expressions in terms of sinθ and cosθ to simplify.We know that secθ = 1/cosθ, tanθ = sinθ / cosθ.Let’s rewrite the midpoint y-coordinate:√3 (secθ -2)/(2 tanθ) = √3 (1/cosθ -2)/(2 (sinθ / cosθ)) = √3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ )Similarly, the radius squared term:[ √3 (2 secθ -1)/(2 tanθ) ]^2 = [ √3 (2/cosθ -1)/(2 (sinθ / cosθ)) ]^2 = [ √3 (2 - cosθ)/(2 sinθ) ]^2 = (3 (2 - cosθ)^2)/(4 sin²θ )So, substituting back into the circle equation:(x -1)^2 + ( y - [√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) ] )^2 = 3(2 - cosθ)^2/(4 sin²θ )Now, we need to find (h, k) such that:(h -1)^2 + ( k - [√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) ] )^2 = 3(2 - cosθ)^2/(4 sin²θ )This must hold for all θ. Let me rearrange terms:Left-hand side (LHS): (h -1)^2 + k² - 2k [√3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) ] + [ √3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) ]²Right-hand side (RHS): 3(4 -4 cosθ + cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ )Simplify both sides.First, expand the LHS:(h -1)^2 + k² - [ √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ) / sinθ ] + [ 3(1 - 4 cosθ + 4 cos²θ) / (4 sin²θ) ]Wait, [ √3 (1 - 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) ]² = 3(1 - 4 cosθ +4 cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ )So, combining all terms:LHS = (h -1)^2 + k² - [ √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ ] + 3(1 -4 cosθ +4 cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ )RHS = 3(4 -4 cosθ + cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ )Set LHS = RHS:(h -1)^2 + k² - [ √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ ] + 3(1 -4 cosθ +4 cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ ) = 3(4 -4 cosθ + cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ )Subtract RHS from both sides:(h -1)^2 + k² - [ √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ ] + 3(1 -4 cosθ +4 cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ ) - 3(4 -4 cosθ + cos²θ)/(4 sin²θ ) =0Compute the difference between the two fractions:3/(4 sin²θ ) [ (1 -4 cosθ +4 cos²θ ) - (4 -4 cosθ + cos²θ ) ]Simplify inside the brackets:1 -4 cosθ +4 cos²θ -4 +4 cosθ - cos²θ = (1 -4) + (-4 cosθ +4 cosθ) + (4 cos²θ - cos²θ ) = -3 + 0 +3 cos²θ = 3 cos²θ -3 = 3(cos²θ -1 ) = -3 sin²θTherefore, the difference is:3/(4 sin²θ ) * (-3 sin²θ ) = -9/4So, equation becomes:(h -1)^2 + k² - [ √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ ) / sinθ ] -9/4=0Thus:(h -1)^2 + k² -9/4 - [ √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ ) / sinθ ]=0Now, the term [ √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ ) / sinθ ] must be equal to zero for all θ, because the other terms are constants. Otherwise, since θ varies, unless the coefficient is zero, this term would depend on θ, leading to a contradiction.Therefore, to satisfy the equation for all θ, we must have both:1. The coefficient of the varying term must be zero.2. The constant terms must sum to zero.So first, set the coefficient of [ (1 - 2 cosθ ) / sinθ ] to zero:√3 k * coefficient =0 for all θ.But (1 - 2 cosθ)/sinθ varies with θ unless k=0.Therefore, √3 k (1 - 2 cosθ ) / sinθ must be zero for all θ. The only way this can happen is if k=0, because (1 -2 cosθ)/sinθ is not identically zero.So set k=0.Then, substitute back into the equation:(h -1)^2 + 0 -9/4 -0=0 =&gt; (h -1)^2 =9/4 =&gt; h -1=±3/2 =&gt; h=1±3/2 =&gt; h=5/2 or h=-1/2.But we need to check if both solutions are valid. However, the problem states that the circle must pass through a fixed point regardless of P. Let&#39;s test both h=5/2 and h=-1/2 with k=0.But first, check if (5/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0) are candidates.Wait, but let&#39;s think about the original setup. The hyperbola is x²/4 - y²/3=1. The points A1 and A2 are (-2,0) and (2,0). The line x=1 is vertical line to the right of the center but left of A2(2,0). The points M1 and M2 are on x=1.The circle with diameter M1M2, which is vertical line segments on x=1. The fixed point must lie somewhere. If we found that k=0, so the fixed point is on the x-axis. Let me check which of h=5/2 or h=-1/2 is plausible.But x=5/2 is 2.5, which is beyond A2(2,0). x=-1/2 is -0.5, between A1(-2,0) and the center. However, considering the hyperbola is opening left and right, maybe the fixed point is at the center? Wait, the center is (0,0). But (h,k)=(-1/2,0) or (5/2,0). Alternatively, maybe both points? But the problem says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, so likely one.Wait, but let&#39;s check with an example. Let’s choose a specific point P on the hyperbola, compute M1 and M2, then the circle, and see which fixed point it passes through.Let’s take θ=0. Wait, but θ=0 would give x=2 sec0=2*1=2, y=√3 tan0=0. But that&#39;s point A2(2,0), which is excluded. So, θ can&#39;t be 0. Similarly, θ=π would give x=2 secπ=2*(-1)=-2, which is A1. So θ can&#39;t be π. Let&#39;s pick θ=π/3, for example.For θ=π/3:secθ = 2, so x=2*2=4, y=√3 tan(π/3)=√3*(√3)=3. So point P is (4,3).Wait, but x²/4 - y²/3=16/4 -9/3=4-3=1, which is correct.Now, find M1: intersection of PA1 and x=1.PA1 connects (-2,0) and (4,3). The slope is (3-0)/(4 - (-2))=3/6=1/2. Equation: y= (1/2)(x +2). At x=1, y=(1/2)(3)=3/2. So M1=(1, 3/2).Similarly, PA2 connects (2,0) and (4,3). Slope is (3-0)/(4-2)=3/2. Equation: y=(3/2)(x -2). At x=1, y=(3/2)(-1)= -3/2. So M2=(1, -3/2).Thus, the circle with diameter M1M2 has endpoints at (1, 3/2) and (1, -3/2). The midpoint is (1,0), and the radius is 3/2. The circle is (x -1)^2 + y^2 = (3/2)^2=9/4.So, the circle equation is (x-1)^2 + y^2=9/4.Now, check if this circle passes through (-1/2,0):Left side: (-1/2 -1)^2 +0= (-3/2)^2=9/4. Right side:9/4. Yes, passes through (-1/2,0).Check (5/2,0):Left side: (5/2 -1)^2 +0=(3/2)^2=9/4. Right side:9/4. Also passes through (5/2,0).Wait, so both points (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) lie on the circle. But in the problem statement, it says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. But in this example, the circle passes through both. However, let me check another point P.Take θ=π/6. Let&#39;s compute:θ=π/6, secθ=2/√3, tanθ=1/√3Therefore, P=(2*(2/√3), √3*(1/√3))=(4/√3,1). Then, coordinates of P: (4/√3,1). Let&#39;s compute lines PA1 and PA2.PA1 connects (-2,0) and (4/√3,1). The slope is (1 -0)/(4/√3 +2)=1/(4/√3 +2). Let me rationalize denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by √3: √3/(4 + 2√3). Then, the equation of PA1 is y= [√3/(4 + 2√3)](x +2).At x=1, y= [√3/(4 + 2√3)]*(3). So compute 3√3 / (4 +2√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 -2√3):3√3*(4 -2√3)/[(4 +2√3)(4 -2√3)] = 3√3*(4 -2√3)/(16 -12)=3√3*(4 -2√3)/4= (12√3 -6*3)/4=(12√3 -18)/4=(6√3 -9)/2≈ let&#39;s not compute numerically.Similarly, PA2 connects (2,0) and (4/√3,1). The slope is (1 -0)/(4/√3 -2)=1/(4/√3 -2). Rationalize denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by √3: √3/(4 -2√3). Equation: y= [√3/(4 -2√3)](x -2). At x=1, y= [√3/(4 -2√3)]*(-1)= -√3/(4 -2√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 +2√3):-√3*(4 +2√3)/[(4)^2 - (2√3)^2]= -√3*(4 +2√3)/(16 -12)= -√3*(4 +2√3)/4= (-4√3 -6)/4= (-2√3 -3)/2.Therefore, M1=(1, (6√3 -9)/2 ) Wait, no, earlier step:Wait, when I computed PA1 intersection:y= [√3/(4 + 2√3)]*(3)= 3√3/(4 +2√3). Then, after rationalizing, it becomes (12√3 -18)/4= (6√3 -9)/2≈ ?Wait, let me re-express:3√3/(4 +2√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 -2√3):3√3*(4 -2√3)/[ (4)^2 - (2√3)^2 ]=3√3*(4 -2√3)/(16 -12)=3√3*(4 -2√3)/4= (12√3 -6*3)/4=(12√3 -18)/4= 3(4√3 -6)/4= same as before.Similarly for PA2: -√3/(4 -2√3)= after rationalization: (-4√3 -6)/4= (-2√3 -3)/2.So, points M1=(1, (12√3 -18)/4 ) and M2=(1, (-2√3 -3)/2 )Wait, maybe better to keep as fractions:M1=(1, [3√3(4 -2√3)] /4 )Wait, perhaps not. Let&#39;s compute the circle with diameter M1M2.Midpoint: x=1, y= average of M1 and M2 y-coordinates.Compute M1&#39;s y: (12√3 -18)/4 = (6√3 -9)/2 ≈ (6*1.732 -9)/2≈ (10.392 -9)/2≈1.392/2≈0.696M2&#39;s y: (-2√3 -3)/2 ≈ (-3.464 -3)/2≈-6.464/2≈-3.232Midpoint y≈ (0.696 -3.232)/2≈-2.536/2≈-1.268. But exact value?Wait, exact calculation:Midpoint y = [ (6√3 -9)/2 + (-2√3 -3)/2 ] /2 = [ (6√3 -9 -2√3 -3)/2 ] /2 = [ (4√3 -12)/2 ] /2 = (4√3 -12)/4 = (√3 -3 )Wait, let me check:Original M1 y: (12√3 -18)/4 = 3*(4√3 -6)/4M2 y: (-2√3 -3)/2 = (-2√3 -3)/2Midpoint y= [ (12√3 -18)/4 + (-2√3 -3)/2 ] /2Convert to common denominator:= [ (12√3 -18)/4 + (-4√3 -6)/4 ] /2= [ (12√3 -18 -4√3 -6)/4 ] /2= [ (8√3 -24)/4 ] /2= (8√3 -24)/8= (√3 -3 )So midpoint is (1, √3 -3 )Radius is half the distance between M1 and M2.Distance between M1 and M2:| y1 - y2 | = | (12√3 -18)/4 - (-2√3 -3)/2 | = | (12√3 -18)/4 + (4√3 +6)/4 | = | (16√3 -12)/4 | = |4√3 -3|.Wait, compute:(12√3 -18)/4 - (-2√3 -3)/2 = (12√3 -18)/4 + (2√3 +3)/1* (2/2) = same as before. Wait, maybe better:Wait, M1 y1=(12√3 -18)/4, M2 y2=(-2√3 -3)/2.Difference: y1 - y2= (12√3 -18)/4 - (-2√3 -3)/2 = (12√3 -18)/4 + (4√3 +6)/4 = (16√3 -12)/4 = (4√3 -3)Therefore, distance is |4√3 -3|, and radius is (4√3 -3)/2.But since the circle is centered at (1, √3 -3 ) with radius (4√3 -3)/2, the equation is (x -1)^2 + (y - (√3 -3 ))^2 = [ (4√3 -3)/2 ]^2.Now, check if (-1/2,0) is on this circle:Left-hand side: (-1/2 -1)^2 + (0 - (√3 -3 ))^2 = (-3/2)^2 + ( -√3 +3 )^2 = 9/4 + (3 -√3 )²Compute (3 -√3 )²=9 -6√3 +3=12 -6√3Thus, LHS=9/4 +12 -6√3=9/4 +48/4 -6√3=57/4 -6√3≈14.25 -10.392≈3.858Right-hand side: [ (4√3 -3)/2 ]^2= (16*3 -24√3 +9)/4=(48 -24√3 +9)/4=(57 -24√3)/4≈(57 -41.568)/4≈15.432/4≈3.858. So equal.Therefore, (-1/2,0) is on the circle. Check (5/2,0):Left-hand side: (5/2 -1)^2 + (0 - (√3 -3 ))^2=(3/2)^2 + (-√3 +3)^2=9/4 + same as before 12 -6√3= same result, 57/4 -6√3. Which equals RHS. So (5/2,0) is also on the circle.Wait, but in the first example with θ=π/3, the circle passed through both (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). However, in the problem statement, it says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. But in reality, the circle passes through two fixed points?Wait, but in the previous example with θ=π/3, the circle was (x -1)^2 + y²=9/4. So, substituting x=-1/2: (-1/2 -1)^2 +0=9/4, yes. Similarly, x=5/2: (5/2 -1)^2 +0=9/4. So, in this case, both (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) lie on the circle. But in the second example with θ=π/6, the circle equation is more complicated, but when evaluated at (-1/2,0), it satisfies. However, (5/2,0) was not checked in the second example. Let me check.For the second example, θ=π/6, the circle equation is (x-1)^2 + (y - (√3 -3 ))^2 = [ (4√3 -3)/2 ]^2. Let&#39;s check (5/2,0):Left side: (5/2 -1)^2 + (0 - (√3 -3 ))^2 = (3/2)^2 + (3 -√3 )^2 =9/4 +9 -6√3 +3=9/4 +12 -6√3= as before 57/4 -6√3≈14.25 -10.392≈3.858Right side: [ (4√3 -3)/2 ]^2=(57 -24√3)/4≈ same as above≈3.858. So yes, (5/2,0) is also on the circle.But in the first example, the circle was (x-1)^2 + y²=9/4, which is symmetric about x=1, so points (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) are symmetric with respect to x=1. So, perhaps both points are fixed points through which the circle passes. However, the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, so maybe the question is referring to both, but in Chinese problems, sometimes they might consider two points but due to symmetry, perhaps one is the reflection of the other, but maybe the answer is expecting both? But let me check.Wait, but in the second example, the circle passes through both points. So if the circle passes through both (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) for any P, then those are fixed points. But the problem says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, so maybe the intended answer is one of them? Or maybe both. However, in our earlier algebra, we found that k must be zero, leading to h=5/2 or h=-1/2. So both points lie on the x-axis, and are fixed. However, depending on P&#39;s position, perhaps these are always on the circle.But in the problem statement, it&#39;s stated as &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, so maybe the answer is both, but in the problem statement, maybe only one is required? But since both are fixed, perhaps the question is expecting both. However, looking back at the problem statement:&quot;Prove: The circle with diameter M1M2 must pass through a fixed point.&quot;It says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, singular. But in reality, as we saw, it passes through two fixed points. However, when parametrizing with θ, perhaps depending on θ, one of them is always there? Wait no, in both examples, both points are on the circle. Therefore, the circle passes through two fixed points. However, the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, so maybe one of them is intended.Looking back at the hyperbola equation, x²/4 - y²/3=1. The foci are located at (±c,0), where c²=a² +b²=4 +3=7, so foci at (±√7,0). But √7≈2.645, so 5/2=2.5 is less than √7, so (5/2,0) is between center and focus. (-1/2,0) is on the left side of the center.But since both points are fixed and lie on the x-axis, maybe the answer expects both? But the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;. Hmm.Wait, but let&#39;s look back at our algebra. When we derived the condition, we found that k must be zero, and h=5/2 or h=-1/2. So both points are fixed, and the circle passes through both regardless of P.But maybe in the problem&#39;s perspective, since a circle passing through two fixed points, but maybe the question considers the pair as a single entity? Or maybe there&#39;s an error in my reasoning.Wait, in the first example, the circle was (x-1)^2 + y²=9/4, which is symmetric with respect to x=1, and passes through (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). In the second example, the circle is not symmetric, but still passes through both points. So regardless of where P is, the circle with diameter M1M2 passes through both (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). Therefore, these are two fixed points. But the problem states &quot;a fixed point&quot;, so perhaps the answer requires both? But the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually expects a single point. Wait, maybe I need to check which of these points is valid.Wait, but let&#39;s test another point P. Take θ=π/4.θ=π/4, secθ=√2, tanθ=1.So P=(2√2, √3*1)=(2√2, √3).Compute PA1: connecting (-2,0) and (2√2,√3). The slope is (√3 -0)/(2√2 +2)=√3/(2(√2 +1)). Equation: y= [√3/(2(√2 +1))](x +2). At x=1, y= [√3/(2(√2 +1))]*(3)= 3√3/(2(√2 +1)).Similarly, PA2: connecting (2,0) and (2√2,√3). Slope: (√3 -0)/(2√2 -2)=√3/(2(√2 -1)). Equation: y= [√3/(2(√2 -1))](x -2). At x=1, y= [√3/(2(√2 -1))]*(-1)= -√3/(2(√2 -1)).Compute M1=(1, 3√3/(2(√2 +1)) ), M2=(1, -√3/(2(√2 -1)) ).Find the circle with diameter M1M2.Midpoint: (1, [3√3/(2(√2 +1)) -√3/(2(√2 -1))]/2 )Simplify the y-coordinate:First, factor out √3/2:[3/(√2 +1) -1/(√2 -1)] * √3/2 * (1/2 )Compute the bracket:3/(√2 +1) -1/(√2 -1) = [3(√2 -1) - (√2 +1)] / [ (√2 +1)(√2 -1) ] = [3√2 -3 -√2 -1]/ (2 -1 ) = (2√2 -4)/1=2(√2 -2)Thus, the midpoint y-coordinate is:√3/2 * 2(√2 -2)/1 *1/2 = √3(√2 -2)/2So midpoint is (1, √3(√2 -2)/2 )The distance between M1 and M2:|y1 - y2|= |3√3/(2(√2 +1)) + √3/(2(√2 -1)) | = √3/2 [3/(√2 +1) +1/(√2 -1) ]Compute the bracket:3/(√2 +1) +1/(√2 -1) = [3(√2 -1) + (√2 +1)] / (2 -1 ) = [3√2 -3 +√2 +1 ] =4√2 -2Thus, distance= √3/2 * (4√2 -2 )= √3*(2√2 -1 )Radius= distance/2= √3*(2√2 -1 )/2Thus, the circle equation: (x -1)^2 + (y - √3(√2 -2)/2 )^2= [ √3*(2√2 -1 )/2 ]^2Now, check if (-1/2,0) is on this circle:Left-hand side: (-1/2 -1)^2 + (0 - √3(√2 -2)/2 )^2= (-3/2)^2 + [ -√3(√2 -2)/2 ]^2=9/4 + [ 3( (√2 -2)^2 ) /4 ]Compute (√2 -2)^2=2 -4√2 +4=6 -4√2Thus, Left-hand side=9/4 + (3*(6 -4√2))/4=9/4 + (18 -12√2)/4= (9 +18 -12√2)/4=(27 -12√2)/4≈(27 -16.97)/4≈10.03/4≈2.507Right-hand side: [ √3*(2√2 -1 )/2 ]^2=3*( (2√2 -1)^2 )/4=3*(8 -4√2 +1)/4=3*(9 -4√2)/4=(27 -12√2)/4≈ same as above≈2.507. So yes, (-1/2,0) is on the circle.Similarly, check (5/2,0):Left-hand side: (5/2 -1)^2 + (0 - √3(√2 -2)/2 )^2= (3/2)^2 + same term as before=9/4 + [3(6 -4√2)/4 ]= same as before=27/4 -12√2/4= same result. So (5/2,0) is also on the circle.Therefore, both points (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) are fixed points through which the circle passes, regardless of P. However, the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, singular. This might be an oversight in the problem statement, or maybe due to the fact that in the hyperbola&#39;s context, one of these points is significant. Let me check.Given the hyperbola is x²/4 - y²/3=1, which has foci at (±√7, 0)≈(±2.645,0). The points (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) are at x=-0.5 and x=2.5, which are both inside the foci. However, maybe the intended answer is the other focus or something else, but our calculations clearly show both (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) are fixed points. But let me check with the equation.Going back to the algebra, we had:The fixed points are (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). Therefore, the circle passes through both points. Since the problem asks to prove that the circle passes through a fixed point, and we found two, but likely the answer expects both. However, in Chinese mathematical problems, sometimes they refer to &quot;the&quot; fixed point, which might be the one with smaller x-coordinate or something. But let me see if there&#39;s another approach.Alternatively, perhaps notice that the circle passing through both points could mean that the fixed points are these two, but the problem might accept either. Let me verify with another example.Take P at a very large x. Let’s say P approaches infinity. On the hyperbola x²/4 - y²/3=1, as x becomes very large, y≈±(√3/2)x. Let&#39;s take P=(2 secθ, √3 tanθ) as θ approaches π/2, so secθ approaches infinity, tanθ approaches infinity.But parametrizing θ approaching π/2 from below. So secθ=1/cosθ, as θ→π/2, cosθ→0, secθ→∞. Similarly, tanθ→∞.So, point P approaches (∞, ∞). The lines PA1 and PA2 would approximate the asymptotes. Wait, the hyperbola&#39;s asymptotes are y=±(√3/2)x.PA1, as P approaches infinity, the line PA1 would approximate the asymptote y=(√3/2)(x +2). Similarly, PA2 would approximate y=(√3/2)(x -2).Intersecting these asymptotes with x=1:For PA1 approximation: y=(√3/2)(1 +2)= (3√3)/2. So M1 approaches (1, 3√3/2 )For PA2 approximation: y=(√3/2)(1 -2)= -√3/2. So M2 approaches (1, -√3/2 )Thus, the circle with diameter between (1,3√3/2) and (1,-√3/2) would have midpoint at (1, (3√3/2 -√3/2)/2 )=(1, √3/2 ). The radius would be (3√3/2 +√3/2)/2= (4√3/2)/2=√3.So the circle equation would be (x -1)^2 + (y - √3/2 )²= (√3 )²=3.Check if (-1/2,0) is on this circle:(-1/2 -1)^2 + (0 - √3/2 )²= (-3/2)^2 + (√3/2 )²=9/4 +3/4=12/4=3. Yes, so (-1/2,0) is on the circle.Similarly, (5/2,0):(5/2 -1)^2 + (0 - √3/2 )²=(3/2)^2 +3/4=9/4 +3/4=12/4=3. Also yes.Therefore, even in the limit as P approaches infinity, the circle passes through both points. Hence, these are indeed the two fixed points.However, the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;. Since both points are fixed, and the problem might be expecting both, but in the answer, usually, we need to box both points? Or maybe the question assumes that the circle passes through two fixed points, but since it&#39;s a circle, passing through two fixed points implies an infinite number of circles passing through them, but in our case, the circle is defined by M1M2 diameter, which changes, but always passes through both points. However, the answer might be either of them, but the problem might have a typo. But according to our calculations, both points are valid.But looking back to the original problem statement: it says &quot;the circle with diameter M1M2 must pass through a fixed point&quot;. Singular. Hmm. Maybe the problem is translated from Chinese, and in the original problem, it might be specified which point, but in translation, it&#39;s ambiguous. However, given the calculations, both points are fixed. But in the first example, the circle equation is (x-1)^2 + y²=9/4, which is symmetric about x=1, so both points are symmetric with respect to x=1, which is the line we are dealing with. Hence, these two points are mirror images over x=1. However, in our parametrization, the hyperbola is symmetric over x-axis and y-axis. Therefore, both points are valid.But the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, so maybe the answer is one of them, and the problem is considered to have either as the solution. But in the problem&#39;s perspective, since the hyperbola is centered at the origin, maybe the circle passes through the origin? Wait, in our previous examples, the origin (0,0) is not on the circle. For example, in the first example, (0,0) plugged into (x-1)^2 + y²=9/4 gives 1 +0=1≠9/4. So no. So not the origin.Alternatively, check the foci. The foci are at (±√7,0). Let&#39;s see in the first example, the circle passes through (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0), which are not the foci. √7≈2.645, which is close to 5/2=2.5, but not exactly. So not the foci.Alternatively, check the other vertices or something else. But given the algebra and examples, the fixed points are (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). But the problem mentions &quot;a fixed point&quot;. Perhaps the problem expects the answer as two points, but the instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually boxes a single expression. This is confusing.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let&#39;s see:Earlier, when solving for (h,k), we set k=0 and got h=5/2 and h=-1/2. So the fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). So the circle passes through both these points regardless of P. Therefore, these are two fixed points. The problem might be inaccurately translated, and in Chinese, it might specify two points, but translated as &quot;a fixed point&quot;. But since we have to provide an answer in boxed notation, and the problem says &quot;must pass through a fixed point&quot;, maybe the answer is both points, but how to represent that? Or perhaps one of them.But in the problem statement, when it says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, maybe they are referring to one of them. For example, the point (-1/2,0) is on the left side of the hyperbola, whereas (5/2,0) is on the right. But since P is any moving point on the hyperbola, perhaps the circle must pass through both. However, in the examples, the circle passes through both.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the pair as a single fixed point, but no, points are distinct.Alternatively, maybe the circle passes through another fixed point not on the x-axis? Let me think.Wait, in our algebra, we forced k=0, leading to h=5/2 or h=-1/2. Therefore, the only possible fixed points are on the x-axis. Therefore, the answer must be one or both of these.Given the problem&#39;s requirement to box the answer, and since both points are valid, maybe the answer is both. But how to write that? The problem might expect one, but due to symmetry, both are valid.However, since the problem says &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, and if we consider the general case, each circle passes through two fixed points. So, the answer is that the circle passes through two fixed points, (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). But since the question says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, perhaps either is acceptable. But in China&#39;s education system, sometimes problems like this expect one answer, so maybe they consider the intersection point other than the two obvious ones? No, in our examples, only those two points.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the original statement in Chinese, it&#39;s a different fixed point, but due to translation, it&#39;s unclear. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check another example.Take P=(2,0), but P cannot be A2. Take P approaching A2, like P=(2+ε, y), but P must be on the hyperbola. When P approaches A2, the line PA2 becomes tangent to the hyperbola at A2, but since A2 is a vertex, the tangent line is vertical? Wait, no.Wait, the hyperbola x²/4 - y²/3=1 has at A2(2,0) the tangent line is x=2, which is vertical. Therefore, if P approaches A2 along the hyperbola, the line PA2 approaches the vertical tangent line x=2, which does not intersect x=1. Therefore, M2 would go to infinity. Similarly, M1 would approach some finite point.But as P approaches A2, the line PA1 would be connecting (-2,0) to (2+ε, y). The slope would be y/(4 +ε). As ε approaches 0, y approaches 0. So, the line PA1 approaches the line connecting (-2,0) to (2,0), which is the x-axis. Therefore, the intersection M1 approaches (1,0).Meanwhile, PA2 approaches the vertical line x=2, so M2 approaches infinity. Therefore, the circle diameter M1M2 would have M1 approaching (1,0) and M2 approaching infinity, so the circle would become a vertical line at x=1, but in the limit, it&#39;s not a circle. However, since P is different from A1 and A2, we can&#39;t have P=A2.But in any case, as P approaches A2, the circle becomes larger, but still passing through (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). In the limit, the circle becomes the vertical line x=1 union the line at infinity, but in real terms, the circle still passes through the fixed points.Therefore, all examples confirm that the circle passes through (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0). Therefore, these are the fixed points.However, the problem asks to prove that the circle passes through a fixed point, which might be a translation issue. Given that, the answer is likely both points, but in the required format, since the problem asks for a fixed point, maybe it&#39;s sufficient to state one of them, but in reality, both are fixed points. However, the problem might consider the pair as a single answer. Wait, but the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually boxes a single answer. But in Chinese exams, sometimes answers are a set of points. However, in the original problem, maybe the fixed point is the focus or something else, but according to our calculations, it&#39;s (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0).But let me see the algebraic conclusion. We derived that the fixed points are (5/2,0) and (-1/2,0). Therefore, the answer should be both points, but since the problem states &quot;a fixed point&quot;, and given the system&#39;s requirement, perhaps the answer is one of them. However, in the problem&#39;s hyperbola, x=1 is a vertical line left of the right vertex. The points (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) are symmetric with respect to x=1. Because 1 - (-1/2) = 3/2, and 5/2 -1=3/2. So, they are symmetric across x=1. Therefore, the circle with diameter on x=1 must be symmetric with respect to x=1, hence passing through both points. But since the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, but we have two, maybe the answer is one of them, but both are correct. However, given that the problem might expect one answer, and the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, I need to choose one. But I need to verify which one is correct.Wait, in the first example, P=(4,3), the circle passes through both. But also, if we consider the reflection of the hyperbola, maybe the point (-1/2,0) is special.Wait, let me compute the power of point A1 or A2 with respect to the circle. The power of a point (x0,y0) with respect to the circle is (x0 - h)^2 + (y0 -k)^2 - r^2. If the power is zero, the point lies on the circle.But for fixed points, the power should be zero for all circles. But as A1 and A2 are on the hyperbola, but not sure.Alternatively, think of the fixed points as related to the hyperbola&#39;s properties. But I can&#39;t recall a property that links this.Alternatively, notice that the points (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) are the centers of the circles with diameters A1A1 and A2A2... No, not necessarily.Alternatively, recall that the circle with diameter M1M2 passes through (-1/2,0) and (5/2,0) for any P. So, these two points are the fixed points.Given that the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, but we found two, I think the intended answer is one of them, but since both are valid, maybe the problem is ill-posed. However, given the examples, both are correct. But in the first example, the circle passes through both. Since the problem is from a Chinese source, which often has meticulous problem statements, maybe there&#39;s an error in my reasoning.Wait, let&#39;s review the algebra:We set up the circle equation and found that the fixed points must satisfy k=0 and h=5/2 or -1/2, so both points are valid. Therefore, the circle passes through both fixed points. However, the problem states &quot;passes through a fixed point&quot;, which is technically correct as it passes through at least one (in reality, two) fixed points. Therefore, the answer is both points, but since the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe the answer is either. But given the calculation and examples, I will list both points.However, in the problem statement, it&#39;s possible that the fixed point is ( (A1 + A2)/2 ) but (A1 + A2)/2 is (0,0), which is the center, but the center is not on the circle unless the circle is centered at origin with radius including it. But in our examples, the circle was not passing through the origin.Alternatively, maybe the answer is the other focus, but foci are at (±√7,0), which are approximately ±2.645, but 5/2=2.5 is close but not equal. So no.Therefore, based on calculations, the fixed points are (-1/2, 0) and (5/2, 0). Since the problem says &quot;a fixed point&quot;, maybe the answer expects one, but in reality, there are two. However, given the problem statement, maybe the intended answer is one of them. But since both are valid, I&#39;ll provide both in the answer.Final AnswerThe fixed points are boxed{left( -dfrac{1}{2}, 0 right)} and boxed{left( dfrac{5}{2}, 0 right)}.However, since the problem asks for &quot;a fixed point&quot;, and considering the system&#39;s requirement for a single boxed answer, it&#39;s possible that the intended answer is one of them. But based on the thorough analysis showing two points, I will present both.Final AnswerThe circle must pass through the fixed points boxed{left( -dfrac{1}{2}, 0 right)} and boxed{left( dfrac{5}{2}, 0 right)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the hyperbola (frac{x^2}{4} - frac{y^2}{3} = 1), the endpoints of the real axis are (A_1(-2, 0)) and (A_2(2, 0)). A moving point (P) on the hyperbola different from (A_1) and (A_2) is considered. The lines (PA_1) and (PA_2) intersect the line (x = 1) at points (M_1) and (M_2), respectively. We need to prove that the circle with diameter (M_1M_2) must pass through a fixed point.1. Parametrization of Point (P):   - Using hyperbolic functions, (P) can be parametrized as ((2 sec theta, sqrt{3} tan theta)).2. Equations of Lines (PA_1) and (PA_2):   - The line (PA_1) has the equation (y = frac{sqrt{3} tan theta}{2 (sec theta + 1)} (x + 2)).   - The line (PA_2) has the equation (y = frac{sqrt{3} tan theta}{2 (sec theta - 1)} (x - 2)).3. Finding Intersection Points (M_1) and (M_2):   - For (M_1) (intersection of (PA_1) with (x = 1)):     [     y = frac{3 sqrt{3} tan theta}{2 (sec theta + 1)}     ]   - For (M_2) (intersection of (PA_2) with (x = 1)):     [     y = frac{-sqrt{3} tan theta}{2 (sec theta - 1)}     ]4. Midpoint and Radius of the Circle:   - Midpoint of (M_1M_2) is ((1, frac{sqrt{3} (sec theta - 2)}{2 tan theta})).   - Radius is half the distance between (M_1) and (M_2).5. Circle Equation:   - The circle equation is derived and simplified to show that it must pass through the fixed points ((- frac{1}{2}, 0)) and ((frac{5}{2}, 0)) regardless of (theta).6. Verification with Examples:   - Specific examples and limit cases confirm that the circle passes through both fixed points for any (P) on the hyperbola.Conclusion:The circle with diameter (M_1M_2) must pass through the fixed points (boxed{left( -dfrac{1}{2}, 0 right)}) and (boxed{left( dfrac{5}{2}, 0 right)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9ea064b2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9ea064b2><span class="icon" data-v-9ea064b2>🔑:</span>Three, 13. Given, let A_{1}(-2,0), A_{2}(2,0), and a moving point Pleft(x_{0}, y_{0}right) on the hyperbola with y_{0} neq 0. Thus,frac{x_{0}^{2}}{4}-frac{y_{0}^{2}}{3}=1.Also, l_{P A_{1}}: y=frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}+2}(x+2),l_{P A_{2}}: y=frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}-2}(x-2),then M_{1}left(1, frac{3 y_{0}}{x_{0}+2}right), M_{2}left(1, frac{-y_{0}}{x_{0}-2}right).For any point Q(x, y) on the circle Gamma with diameter M_{1} M_{2}, by overrightarrow{M_{1} Q} cdot overrightarrow{M_{2} Q}=0, we knowthe circle Gamma :(x-1)(x-1)+left(y-frac{3 y_{0}}{x_{0}+2}right)left(y-frac{-y_{0}}{x_{0}-2}right)=0.Let y=0, substituting into the above equation gives(x-1)^{2}-frac{3 y_{0}^{2}}{x_{0}^{2}-4}=0.From frac{x_{0}^{2}}{4}-frac{y_{0}^{2}}{3}=1 Rightarrow frac{y_{0}^{2}}{x_{0}^{2}-4}=frac{3}{4}.Thus, (x-1)^{2}-frac{9}{4}=0 Rightarrow x=frac{5}{2} or x=-frac{1}{2}.Therefore, the circle with diameter M_{1} M_{2} must pass through the two fixed points left(-frac{1}{2}, 0right),left(frac{5}{2}, 0right).</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-726bf6f9><span data-v-726bf6f9>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
