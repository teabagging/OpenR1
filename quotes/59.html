There are two cyclists starting from points A and B towards each other. They first meet 70 km from A. Then they keep going, reach their respective destinations (A and B), turn around, and meet again 90 km from B. We need to find the distance between A and B.Hmm, let&#39;s start by visualizing the problem. Let&#39;s denote the distance between A and B as D. So the first meeting point is 70 km from A, which means the first cyclist (from A) has traveled 70 km, and the second cyclist (from B) has traveled D - 70 km. Since they started at the same time and met each other, they must have been traveling for the same amount of time until that meeting point. So their speeds must be in the ratio of the distances they&#39;ve covered. Let me write that down.Let the speed of cyclist A be v_A and cyclist B be v_B. The time taken until they meet the first time is t1. So:v_A = 70 / t1v_B = (D - 70) / t1Therefore, the ratio of their speeds is v_A / v_B = 70 / (D - 70). Got that.Now, after meeting the first time, they continue to their destinations. Cyclist A has to cover the remaining distance to B, which is D - 70 km, and cyclist B has to cover the remaining distance to A, which is 70 km. The time taken for cyclist A to reach B would be (D - 70) / v_A, and for cyclist B to reach A would be 70 / v_B.Once they reach their destinations, they immediately turn around and start heading back. Then they meet again 90 km from B. So the second meeting point is 90 km from B, which means it&#39;s D - 90 km from A.We need to figure out the total time elapsed until the second meeting and set up equations based on their speeds and distances.Let me break down the timeline:1. First, both cyclists start moving towards each other and meet at 70 km from A. Time taken: t1.2. Then, cyclist A continues to B, taking time t2 = (D - 70) / v_A.3. Cyclist B continues to A, taking time t3 = 70 / v_B.4. After reaching their destinations, they turn around and start moving back towards each other. They meet again 90 km from B. The time taken from the start until this second meeting is t1 + t2 + t4, where t4 is the time from when they start moving back towards each other until they meet again.Alternatively, since they might not necessarily take the same time to reach their destinations. Wait, cyclist A takes t2 time to go from meeting point to B, cyclist B takes t3 time to go from meeting point to A. So depending on which is longer, one cyclist might have to wait for the other to turn around. Wait, no, actually, once they reach their destinations, they immediately turn around, so the total time until they start moving towards each other again is max(t2, t3). Wait, no, actually, each cyclist has their own timeline. For example, cyclist A&#39;s timeline is t1 (time to first meeting) + t2 (time to reach B) + t4 (time moving back towards A until second meeting). Similarly, cyclist B&#39;s timeline is t1 + t3 (time to reach A) + t4 (time moving back towards B until second meeting). But since they meet at the same time, these total times must be equal. Therefore, t1 + t2 + t4 = t1 + t3 + t4, which would imply t2 = t3, but that might not necessarily be true. Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong here.Alternatively, maybe after the first meeting, they each go to the opposite city, turn around, and then meet again. The total distance each has traveled until the second meeting can be considered.Let me try another approach. Let&#39;s consider the total distance covered by each cyclist until the second meeting.From the first meeting to the second meeting:- Cyclist A travels from the first meeting point (70 km from A) to B (which is D - 70 km), then turns around and travels 90 km towards A. So total distance cyclist A travels after the first meeting is (D - 70) + 90 = D + 20 km.- Cyclist B travels from the first meeting point (D - 70 km from B) to A (70 km), then turns around and travels D - 90 km towards B (since the second meeting is 90 km from B). So total distance cyclist B travels after the first meeting is 70 + (D - 90) = D - 20 km.Since they both start moving towards each other again immediately after reaching their destinations, the time taken after the first meeting until the second meeting should be the same for both cyclists. Therefore, the time taken by cyclist A to travel D + 20 km at speed v_A should equal the time taken by cyclist B to travel D - 20 km at speed v_B.But we also know from the first meeting that v_A / v_B = 70 / (D - 70). Let&#39;s denote this ratio as 70 / (D - 70) = k. So v_A = k * v_B.Therefore, the time taken by cyclist A is (D + 20) / v_A = (D + 20) / (k * v_B).The time taken by cyclist B is (D - 20) / v_B.Since these times are equal:(D + 20) / (k * v_B) = (D - 20) / v_BWe can cancel out v_B from both sides:(D + 20) / k = D - 20But k is 70 / (D - 70), so:(D + 20) / (70 / (D - 70)) = D - 20Multiply both sides by 70 / (D - 70):(D + 20) = (D - 20) * (70 / (D - 70))Wait, let me write that again.Left side: (D + 20) divided by (70 / (D - 70)) is equal to (D + 20) * (D - 70) / 70.Right side: D - 20.Therefore:(D + 20)(D - 70)/70 = D - 20Multiply both sides by 70:(D + 20)(D - 70) = 70(D - 20)Expand the left side:D^2 - 70D + 20D - 1400 = 70D - 1400Simplify:D^2 - 50D - 1400 = 70D - 1400Bring all terms to left side:D^2 - 50D - 1400 - 70D + 1400 = 0Simplify:D^2 - 120D = 0Factor:D(D - 120) = 0So solutions are D = 0 or D = 120. Since D can&#39;t be zero, the answer is 120 km.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify.Let me check with D = 120 km.First meeting at 70 km from A, so cyclist A has traveled 70 km, cyclist B has traveled 120 - 70 = 50 km. So their speed ratio is 70:50 = 7:5.Then, cyclist A has to go another 50 km to reach B. At speed 7, time taken is 50/7.Cyclist B has to go another 70 km to reach A. At speed 5, time taken is 70/5 = 14.So cyclist A reaches B after 50/7 ≈7.1429 hours, turns around. Cyclist B reaches A after 14 hours, turns around.But the second meeting happens when they start moving towards each other again. Wait, but in my previous calculation, we assumed that after the first meeting, they continue to their destinations, then immediately turn around, and the time taken for cyclist A to go from first meeting to B and back to second meeting is (D - 70) + 90 = D + 20. But if D = 120, then cyclist A travels 50 km to B, then 90 km back towards A, so total 140 km. At speed 7, time is 140 /7 = 20 hours.Cyclist B travels 70 km to A, then 30 km back towards B (since 90 km from B is 120 - 90 = 30 km from A). So total distance is 70 + 30 = 100 km. At speed 5, time is 100 /5 = 20 hours. So times are equal, which checks out.But wait, when they start moving towards each other again after reaching their destinations, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting is 20 hours. But in reality, cyclist A took 50/7 ≈7.1429 hours to reach B, then started back. Cyclist B took 14 hours to reach A, then started back. So after the first meeting, cyclist A starts moving towards B, takes 50/7 hours to reach B, then immediately turns around and starts moving back towards A at speed 7. Cyclist B continues moving towards A, reaches A at 14 hours, then turns around and moves back towards B at speed 5.So the time between the first meeting and the second meeting is not directly 20 hours. Instead, after the first meeting, cyclist A arrives at B at 50/7 hours, then starts back. Cyclist B arrives at A at 14 hours, then starts back. The time between the first meeting and when cyclist A starts back is 50/7 hours, and when cyclist B starts back is 14 hours. So there&#39;s a time difference between when they start moving towards each other again.Therefore, perhaps my previous approach is oversimplified because it assumes that both cyclists start moving towards each other immediately after the first meeting, but in reality, they start moving towards each other only after each has reached their respective destinations and turned around, which may happen at different times.Therefore, my initial calculation might be incorrect because it didn&#39;t account for the different times they take to reach the destinations. So let&#39;s try a different approach.Let me denote:- Let D be the distance between A and B.- Let v_A and v_B be the speeds of cyclists A and B.First meeting:They start at the same time, meet 70 km from A. So:Time taken until first meeting: t1 = 70 / v_A = (D - 70) / v_BTherefore, v_A / v_B = 70 / (D - 70). This is the same as before.After the first meeting:Cyclist A has to cover D - 70 km to reach B. Time taken: t2 = (D - 70) / v_A.Cyclist B has to cover 70 km to reach A. Time taken: t3 = 70 / v_B.After reaching their destinations, they turn around and start moving back. Let&#39;s compute the times when they start moving back.For cyclist A: total time from start until starting back is t1 + t2.For cyclist B: total time from start until starting back is t1 + t3.The difference in their start times for the return journey is |t2 - t3|. Depending on who is faster, one may start earlier.Once they start moving back, their speeds are still v_A and v_B, but now moving towards each other again. The distance between them when they both start moving back needs to be considered.Wait, when cyclist A starts moving back, cyclist B might still be traveling towards A or might have already started moving back. Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the total time from the start until the second meeting.Let T be the total time from start until the second meeting.In time T, cyclist A travels 70 km to the first meeting, then D - 70 km to B, then some distance back towards A. Similarly, cyclist B travels D - 70 km to the first meeting, then 70 km to A, then some distance back towards B.The total distance cyclist A travels is 70 + (D - 70) + x, where x is the distance from B to the second meeting point. Since the second meeting is 90 km from B, x = 90 km. Wait, no. If the second meeting is 90 km from B, then from B&#39;s perspective, cyclist B has traveled 70 km to A, then turned around and traveled 90 km towards B. Wait, no. The second meeting is 90 km from B, which is D - 90 km from A.Wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s track each cyclist&#39;s position over time.Let me use D = 120 km as found before to check if it works. Let&#39;s see.If D = 120 km, then the first meeting is at 70 km from A. Cyclist A&#39;s speed is 70 / t1, cyclist B&#39;s speed is (120 - 70) / t1 = 50 / t1. So speed ratio 7:5.Cyclist A&#39;s speed: 7k, cyclist B&#39;s speed: 5k for some k.Time to reach destinations after first meeting:Cyclist A needs to go 50 km at 7k: time = 50 / (7k).Cyclist B needs to go 70 km at 5k: time = 70 / (5k) = 14 / k.So cyclist A arrives at B at time t1 + 50/(7k).Cyclist B arrives at A at time t1 + 14/k.But t1 is the time to first meeting. Since t1 = 70 / (7k) = 10 / k. So cyclist A arrives at B at 10/k + 50/(7k) = (10 + 50/7)/k = (70 + 50)/7k = 120/(7k).Cyclist B arrives at A at 10/k + 14/k = 24/k.So cyclist A arrives at B at 120/(7k) ≈17.1429/k, and cyclist B arrives at A at 24/k. So cyclist A has already turned around and started moving back towards A at 120/(7k), while cyclist B is still moving towards A until 24/k. So between 120/(7k) and 24/k, cyclist A is moving back towards A alone, and cyclist B is still moving towards A. Then, at 24/k, cyclist B turns around and starts moving back towards B.Wait, this seems complicated. Let&#39;s compute the exact times.First, total time until cyclist A starts moving back: 10/k + 50/(7k) = (70 + 50)/7k = 120/7k ≈17.1429/k.Total time until cyclist B starts moving back: 10/k + 14/k = 24/k.So cyclist A starts moving back at 120/(7k), and cyclist B starts moving back at 24/k.So the time difference between them starting back is 24/k - 120/(7k) = (168 - 120)/7k = 48/(7k) ≈6.8571/k.During this time, cyclist A is moving towards A at speed 7k, so covers distance 7k * 48/(7k) = 48 km. So from B, cyclist A is moving towards A and has already covered 48 km by the time cyclist B starts moving back.Therefore, when cyclist B starts moving back, cyclist A is 48 km away from B towards A. The distance between them at that moment is 48 km. Now, both are moving towards each other: cyclist A moving towards A at 7k, cyclist B moving towards B at 5k. Wait, no. Wait, cyclist A is moving towards A, so direction towards A, speed 7k. Cyclist B is moving towards B, so direction towards B, speed 5k. So they are moving towards each other? Wait, if cyclist A is moving towards A and cyclist B is moving towards B, they are moving away from each other. Wait, no. Wait, cyclist A is moving from B towards A, and cyclist B is moving from A towards B. So they are moving towards each other. Wait, no. Cyclist A is going from B to A, cyclist B is going from A to B. So they are moving towards each other. The distance between them when cyclist B starts moving back is 48 km, and they are moving towards each other with combined speed 7k + 5k = 12k. Therefore, the time until they meet is 48 km / 12k = 4/k.Therefore, the second meeting occurs at time 24/k + 4/k = 28/k.Now, let&#39;s check where they meet. From the point when cyclist B starts moving back, cyclist A has already covered 48 km towards A. Then, in the next 4/k hours, cyclist A covers 7k * 4/k = 28 km towards A. So cyclist A&#39;s total distance from B is 48 km + 28 km = 76 km from B, which is 120 - 76 = 44 km from A. Wait, but the problem states they meet 90 km from B. Hmm, this contradicts. Therefore, D=120 km seems incorrect?Wait, this is confusing. If according to the previous calculation, D=120 km leads to the second meeting 76 km from B, which is 44 km from A, but the problem states it should be 90 km from B, which is D - 90 = 30 km from A. Therefore, something&#39;s wrong here.So my initial approach assuming (D + 20)/v_A = (D - 20)/v_B gives D=120, but when actually calculating the positions considering different turn-around times, the meeting point is different. Therefore, my first approach was flawed.Thus, I need to re-examine the problem.Alternative approach: Let’s consider the total distance covered by both cyclists until the second meeting.When they meet the first time, together they have covered D km. By the time they meet the second time, they would have covered 3D km in total (since they each go to the opposite end and then meet again). This is a known approach in meeting problems where the total distance covered between meetings is a multiple of D.First meeting: total distance = D.Second meeting: total distance = 3D.Therefore, the ratio of distances covered by each cyclist between the first and second meeting should be the same as their speed ratio.From the first meeting to the second meeting, cyclist A would have covered 2(D - 70) + x, where x is the distance from B to the second meeting point. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Wait, total distance covered by both cyclists by the second meeting is 3D. Since at first meeting, they covered D together, then after that, they each cover another 2D (to reach the ends and come back), but they meet before covering the entire 2D. Wait, perhaps.Alternatively, the total distance covered by both until the second meeting is 3D. Therefore, the first cyclist (A) would have covered 3D * (v_A / (v_A + v_B)). Similarly for cyclist B.But from the problem, we know specific distances from A and B at the meetings. At the first meeting, cyclist A has covered 70 km, so total distance covered by A is 70 km, and by B is D - 70 km. So total D. Therefore, speed ratio v_A / v_B = 70 / (D - 70).At the second meeting, total distance covered is 3D. Therefore, cyclist A has covered 3D * (70 / (70 + (D - 70))) = 3D * (70 / D) = 210 km.Similarly, cyclist B has covered 3D * ((D - 70)/D) = 3(D - 70).But according to the problem, the second meeting is 90 km from B, so cyclist A has traveled D + (D - 90) = 2D - 90 km. Wait, because cyclist A goes from A to first meeting (70 km), then to B (D - 70 km), then back towards A (D - 90 km). So total distance: 70 + (D - 70) + (D - 90) = 2D - 90 km.Similarly, cyclist B has traveled (D - 70) + 70 + 90 = D + 90 km.But according to the total distance covered, cyclist A has covered 210 km (if D = 120, 210 = 2*120 - 90 = 240 -90=150 km, which doesn&#39;t match). Wait, this seems conflicting.Wait, maybe the total distance covered by cyclist A until the second meeting is 2D - 90 km, which equals 3D * (v_A / (v_A + v_B)).Similarly, cyclist B has covered D + 90 km = 3D * (v_B / (v_A + v_B)).But we also have v_A / v_B = 70 / (D - 70).Let me set up the equations.From the first meeting:v_A / v_B = 70 / (D - 70) =&gt; v_A = (70 / (D - 70)) * v_B.From the total distance covered by each cyclist until the second meeting:For cyclist A: 2D - 90 = 3D * (v_A / (v_A + v_B)).For cyclist B: D + 90 = 3D * (v_B / (v_A + v_B)).But since 2D - 90 + D + 90 = 3D, which checks out.So substituting v_A = (70 / (D - 70)) * v_B into the first equation:2D - 90 = 3D * ( (70 / (D - 70)) * v_B ) / ( (70 / (D - 70)) * v_B + v_B )Simplify denominator:(70 / (D - 70) + 1 ) * v_B = ( (70 + D - 70) / (D - 70) ) * v_B = (D / (D - 70)) * v_BTherefore, the equation becomes:2D - 90 = 3D * (70 / (D - 70) * v_B ) / (D / (D - 70) * v_B )Simplify fractions:The (D - 70) and v_B terms cancel out:2D - 90 = 3D * (70 / D )So:2D - 90 = 210Thus:2D = 210 + 90 = 300 =&gt; D = 150Wait, so D=150 km. Let me check this.If D=150 km.First meeting at 70 km from A. So cyclist A traveled 70 km, cyclist B traveled 80 km. Therefore, speed ratio 70:80 = 7:8.Then, cyclist A needs to travel another 80 km to B, cyclist B needs to travel 70 km to A.Time for cyclist A to reach B: 80 / 7k.Time for cyclist B to reach A: 70 / 8k.Total time until both have turned around:For cyclist A: t1 + t2 = (70 / 7k) + (80 / 7k) = 150 /7k ≈21.4286/k.For cyclist B: t1 + t3 = (80 /8k) + (70 /8k) = 150 /8k =18.75/k.Wait, so cyclist B arrives at A faster and turns around earlier. The difference in time is 21.4286/k -18.75/k ≈2.6786/k.During this time, cyclist B is moving back towards B at speed 8k. So distance covered by cyclist B in that time: 8k * 2.6786/k ≈21.428 km.Therefore, when cyclist A starts moving back towards A, cyclist B is already 21.428 km from A towards B.The distance between them at that moment is D - 21.428 km =150 -21.428≈128.571 km.Now, both cyclists are moving towards each other: cyclist A at speed 7k towards A, cyclist B at speed 8k towards B. Wait, no, cyclist A is moving towards A (direction from B to A) at 7k, and cyclist B is moving towards B (direction from A to B) at 8k. So they are moving towards each other, with combined speed 7k +8k=15k.The distance between them is≈128.571 km. Time until meeting:128.571 /15k≈8.5714/k.Therefore, total time until second meeting:For cyclist A:21.4286/k +8.5714/k≈30/k.Distance cyclist A traveled after turning around:7k *8.5714/k≈60 km. Since cyclist A started from B, moving towards A, so 60 km from B is 150 -60=90 km from A. Wait, but the problem states the second meeting is 90 km from B. Wait, no. Wait, the second meeting is 90 km from B, which would be 150 -90=60 km from A. But according to this, cyclist A has traveled 60 km from B, which is 90 km from A. Wait, no, 150 -60=90. Wait, yes, if starting from B, moving towards A, 60 km from B is 90 km from A. But the problem states the second meeting is 90 km from B, which is 60 km from A. Wait, conflict here.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in directions.If cyclist A is moving from B towards A, starting at B, then distance from A is decreasing. So if cyclist A travels 60 km from B towards A, he is 60 km away from B, which is 150 -60=90 km from A. But the problem states the second meeting is 90 km from B, which is 60 km from A. Therefore, this contradicts.Wait, this suggests a miscalculation. Let&#39;s re-express.Wait, when cyclist A starts moving back from B towards A at time≈21.4286/k, cyclist B had already turned around at A and is moving towards B. At the moment cyclist A starts moving back, cyclist B is already 21.428 km from A towards B. So the distance between A and cyclist B is 21.428 km, meaning the distance between cyclist A (at B) and cyclist B (21.428 km from A) is D -21.428=150 -21.428≈128.571 km.Then, they move towards each other: cyclist A moving towards A at 7k, cyclist B moving towards B at 8k. Wait, no, if cyclist A is moving towards A from B, and cyclist B is moving towards B from A, they are moving in opposite directions, not towards each other. Wait, that&#39;s a mistake.Wait, if cyclist A is going from B to A (towards A), and cyclist B is going from A to B (towards B), then they are moving away from each other. Therefore, the distance between them increases. Therefore, this can&#39;t be. But according to the problem, they meet again, so they must be moving towards each other. Therefore, there must be an error in the direction assumptions.Wait, no. After reaching their destinations, they turn around. So cyclist A, upon reaching B, turns around and starts moving back towards A. Cyclist B, upon reaching A, turns around and starts moving back towards B. Therefore, their directions are:- Cyclist A: B -&gt; A- Cyclist B: A -&gt; BSo they are moving towards each other again. Wait, no. If cyclist A is moving from B to A, and cyclist B is moving from A to B, they are moving towards each other. Wait, no, if both are moving towards their original starting points, they are moving towards each other. Wait, no, if cyclist A is going from B to A, and cyclist B is going from A to B, they are moving towards each other. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So they are approaching each other again.Therefore, their combined speed is 7k +8k=15k. The distance between them when they start moving towards each other again is 128.571 km. Therefore, time until meeting is 128.571 /15k≈8.5714/k. During this time:Cyclist A travels 7k *8.5714/k≈60 km from B towards A, ending up at 60 km from B, which is 150 -60=90 km from A.Cyclist B travels 8k *8.5714/k≈68.571 km from A towards B, ending up at 21.428 +68.571≈90 km from A towards B, which is 150 -90=60 km from B.Wait, this is contradictory. According to this, cyclist A is 90 km from A (60 km from B), and cyclist B is 90 km from A towards B (60 km from B). So they meet at 60 km from B, which is 90 km from A. But the problem states the second meeting is 90 km from B. So this is a conflict. Therefore, D=150 km is incorrect.Wait, I&#39;m confused. Let me check the problem statement again: &quot;they met for the second time 90 km from B&quot;. So the second meeting is 90 km away from B, meaning it&#39;s 90 km from B towards A, which is D -90 km from A.If D=150, then 90 km from B is 60 km from A. But according to the previous calculation, they meet at 60 km from B (90 km from A). So something is wrong here.Alternatively, maybe my assumption that the total distance covered until the second meeting is 3D is incorrect.Wait, let me consider the total distance covered by both cyclists until the second meeting. They start at A and B, meet once, then continue to the ends, turn around, and meet again. So:First meeting: combined distance D.Then, each continues to the opposite end: combined distance D (since A goes to B, B goes to A).Then, they turn around and meet again: combined distance x. So total combined distance is D + D + x = 2D +x.But if they meet again, x would be the distance between the two ends minus the distance they covered moving towards each other. Wait, this is getting too vague.Alternative method: Let&#39;s use the concept of relative speed.But first, let me check with D=150 km. If D=150 km, speed ratio 7:8.First meeting at 70 km from A.Then cyclist A goes to B (80 km) at 7k, time=80/(7k).Cyclist B goes to A (70 km) at 8k, time=70/(8k)=8.75/k.Total time until cyclist B starts back: t1 +70/(8k). t1 is time until first meeting:70/(7k)=10/k. So total time:10/k +8.75/k=18.75/k.Cyclist A arrives at B at t1 +80/(7k)=10/k +80/(7k)= (70 +80)/7k=150/(7k)≈21.4286/k.So cyclist B starts back at 18.75/k, cyclist A starts back at≈21.4286/k.From 18.75/k to21.4286/k, cyclist B is moving towards B alone. Time difference≈2.6786/k. Distance covered by cyclist B:8k *2.6786/k≈21.428 km. So when cyclist A starts back, cyclist B is21.428 km from A towards B.Distance between them:150 -21.428≈128.572 km.Now both are moving towards each other: cyclist A at7k, cyclist B at8k. Combined speed15k. Time to meet:128.572/(15k)≈8.5714/k.In this time, cyclist A travels7k *8.5714/k≈60 km from B towards A, ending at60 km from B, which is90 km from A.Cyclist B travels8k *8.5714/k≈68.571 km from21.428 km mark towards B, so total distance from A is21.428 +68.571≈90 km, which is60 km from B.Therefore, they meet at60 km from B (90 km from A). But the problem states the second meeting is90 km from B. So this does not match. Therefore, D=150 km is incorrect.Therefore, my previous approach using the total distance covered being 3D is flawed.Alternative approach:Let’s let the distance between A and B be D.First meeting: Cyclist A has traveled70 km, cyclist B has traveledD-70 km. Speeds are in ratio70/(D-70).Let’s denote speeds as7k and (D-70)k, where k is a constant. Wait, no. Let me set cyclist A&#39;s speed asv, cyclist B&#39;s speed asu.From first meeting:70/v = (D-70)/u =&gt; u = (D-70)v /70.After the first meeting, cyclist A travels remainingD-70 km to B, which takes time t2=(D-70)/v.Cyclist B travels remaining70 km to A, which takes timet3=70/u=70/( (D-70)v/70 )=70^2/( (D-70)v ).After reaching their destinations, they turn around immediately.The total time from start until cyclist A starts back ist1 + t2=70/v + (D-70)/v=(70 +D -70)/v=D/v.The total time from start until cyclist B starts back ist1 + t3=70/v +70^2/( (D-70)v ).Therefore, the time difference between cyclist A and cyclist B starting back is:t_diff= [70/v +70^2/( (D-70)v ) ] - D/v = [70 +70^2/(D -70) -D ] /v.This time difference multiplied by their speeds will give the distance between them when the later cyclist starts back.Assuming cyclist A starts back first (ifD/v &lt; [70/v +70^2/( (D-70)v ) ]), which depends on D.But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the positions as functions of time.Let’s let t=0 be the start time.Position of cyclist A: until first meeting at time t1=70/v, position=70 km.After that, cyclist A moves to B, arriving at time t1 + t2=70/v + (D-70)/v=D/v.Then cyclist A turns around and moves back towards A with speedv.Position of cyclist A: For t &gt;=D/v, position= D -v(t -D/v)=2D -vt.Similarly, position of cyclist B: until first meeting at time t1=70/v, position=D -70 km.After that, cyclist B moves to A, arriving at time t1 + t3=70/v +70/u=70/v +70^2/( (D-70)v ).Then cyclist B turns around and moves back towards B with speedu.Position of cyclist B: For t &gt;= t1 + t3, position=0 +u(t - (t1 + t3))=u(t -70/v -70^2/( (D-70)v )).The second meeting occurs when their positions are equal:2D -vt =u(t -70/v -70^2/( (D-70)v )).This is a complex equation, but let&#39;s substituteu=(D-70)v/70.So:2D -vt= ( (D-70)v/70 )(t -70/v -70^2/( (D-70)v )).Let me simplify the right-hand side:First, compute t -70/v -70^2/( (D-70)v ):= t -70/v -70^2/( (D-70)v )= t - [70/(v) + 70^2/( (D -70)v ) ]= t - [70(D -70) +70^2 ] / [ (D -70)v ]= t - [70D -4900 +4900 ] / [ (D -70)v ]= t -70D / [ (D -70)v ]Therefore, the right-hand side becomes:( (D -70)v /70 ) * [ t -70D / ( (D -70)v ) ]= ( (D -70)v /70 ) * t - ( (D -70)v /70 ) * (70D / ( (D -70)v ) )= ( (D -70)v t ) /70 - (70D /70 )= ( (D -70)v t ) /70 - DTherefore, the equation is:2D -vt = ( (D -70)v t ) /70 - DBring all terms to left side:2D -vt - ( (D -70)v t ) /70 + D =0Combine like terms:3D -vt - ( (D -70)v t ) /70 =0Factor outvt:3D -vt[1 + (D -70)/70 ]=0Simplify the bracket:1 + (D -70)/70 = (70 +D -70)/70 =D/70Therefore:3D -vt*(D/70)=0Thus:3D = vt*(D/70)=&gt; vt=3D*(70/D)=210Therefore, vt=210.But vt is the distance cyclist A has traveled from the moment he turned around (at time D/v) until meeting again. Since his speed isv, the time taken after turning around is210 /v, but this conflicts with previous definitions.Alternatively, let me check:From the equation:3D = vt*(D/70)So vt=3D*(70/D)=210.But vt is the term from cyclist A&#39;s position equation:2D -vt=... meaning position=2D -vt.But when vt=210, position=2D -210.But the second meeting is supposed to be at90 km from B, which isD -90 from A. Therefore:2D -vt= D -90But vt=210, so:2D -210= D -90=&gt;2D -D=210 -90=&gt;D=120 km.But this contradicts the previous check where D=120 km leads to second meeting at44 km from A. Wait, but according to this equation, if D=120 km, then position=2*120 -210=240 -210=30 km from A, which is D -30=90 km from B. Ah! Therefore, the second meeting is at30 km from A, which is90 km from B. Which matches the problem statement.Therefore, the answer is D=120 km.Wait, but earlier when I tried D=120 km, the calculation suggested they meet at44 km from A. Where is the discrepancy?Ah, because when I used D=120 km with speed ratio7:5, the detailed timeline didn&#39;t match, but according to this equation, it does. Therefore, perhaps my previous detailed calculation was incorrect.Let me recast with D=120 km, speeds7k and5k.First meeting at70 km from A. Time taken:70/(7k)=10/k.In this time, cyclist B travels5k*10/k=50 km, so meets at70+50=120 km=D. Correct.Then, cyclist A continues to B: remaining50 km at7k, time=50/(7k)≈7.1428/k.Cyclist B continues to A: remaining70 km at5k, time=70/(5k)=14/k.Cyclist A arrives at B at10/k +50/(7k)= (70+50)/7k=120/7k≈17.1428/k.Cyclist B arrives at A at10/k +14/k=24/k.So cyclist B has to wait at A for24/k -17.1428/k≈6.8572/k. No, cyclists don&#39;t wait; they turn around immediately upon arrival.Therefore, cyclist A starts moving back at17.1428/k, cyclist B starts moving back at24/k.At time17.1428/k, cyclist A starts back towards A at7k speed.From17.1428/k to24/k, cyclist A is moving alone towards A.Time difference=24/k -17.1428/k≈6.8572/k.Distance covered by cyclist A in this time:7k*6.8572/k=48 km.Therefore, at24/k, cyclist A is48 km from B towards A, which is120 -48=72 km from A.At24/k, cyclist B starts moving back towards B at5k speed.Now, the distance between cyclist A (72 km from A) and cyclist B (at A) is72 km. They are moving towards each other: cyclist A towards A at7k, cyclist B towards B at5k. Wait, no. Cyclist A is moving towards A, away from B. Cyclist B is moving towards B, away from A. So they are moving in opposite directions. The distance between them increases. This can&#39;t lead to a meeting. Contradiction.Wait, something&#39;s wrong here. If after turning around, cyclist A is moving towards A and cyclist B is moving towards B, they are moving away from each other, so they can&#39;t meet again. Therefore, my previous model is incorrect.But according to the equation derived earlier, D=120 km satisfies the condition. However, in the timeline calculation, it leads to them moving away from each other. Therefore, there must be an error in assumptions.Wait, no. After reaching their destinations, they turn around and start moving back towards their original starting points. Wait, no. If cyclist A was going from A to B, upon reaching B, turns around and goes back to A. Similarly, cyclist B goes from B to A, upon reaching A, turns around and goes back to B. So when they turn around, they are both heading back to their original starting points. Therefore, after turning around, cyclist A is moving from B to A, and cyclist B is moving from A to B. Therefore, they are moving towards each other again. Therefore, my previous assertion that they are moving away is incorrect.Wait, cyclist A is moving from B to A, and cyclist B is moving from A to B. Therefore, they are moving towards each other. Therefore, the distance between them when they start moving towards each other again is:At24/k time, cyclist B starts moving back towards B from A. At that moment, cyclist A is48 km from B towards A, which is72 km from A. The distance between them is72 km. They are moving towards each other with combined speed7k +5k=12k. Time to meet:72 /12k=6/k.Therefore, second meeting occurs at24/k +6/k=30/k.Position of cyclist A:72 km from A +7k*(6/k)=72 +42=114 km from A, which is6 km from B. Wait, no. Wait, cyclist A is moving towards A, so from48 km from B (which is72 km from A), moving towards A at7k for6/k hours: distance covered=7k*(6/k)=42 km. Therefore, new position:72 km from A +42 km towards A=114 km from A, which is6 km from B.But cyclist B is moving from A towards B at5k for6/k hours:5k*(6/k)=30 km. So position:0 +30 km=30 km from A towards B, which is90 km from B. So they meet at30 km from A and90 km from B. Which matches the problem statement. Therefore, D=120 km is correct.But in this case, the second meeting is at30 km from A, which is90 km from B. Therefore, the answer is D=120 km.But why did my initial timeline calculation give a different position? Because I misunderstood the direction of movement after turning around. Initially, I thought cyclist A was moving towards A (correct) and cyclist B moving towards B (correct), but failed to realize that from their respective positions, this means they are moving towards each other. Therefore, the distance between them when cyclist B starts moving back is72 km, and they meet at30 km from A (90 km from B), as required.Therefore, the correct answer is120 km.Final AnswerThe distance from ( A ) to ( B ) is (boxed{120}) kilometers.&lt;/think&gt;Let the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) be ( D ). 1. First Meeting:   - The cyclists meet 70 km from ( A ).    - Cyclist from ( A ) has traveled 70 km, and cyclist from ( B ) has traveled ( D - 70 ) km.   - The ratio of their speeds is ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{70}{D - 70} ).2. Second Meeting:   - After meeting, cyclist ( A ) travels ( D - 70 ) km to ( B ), turns around, and meets cyclist ( B ) again 90 km from ( B ).   - Cyclist ( B ) travels 70 km to ( A ), turns around, and meets cyclist ( A ) again 90 km from ( B ).3. Total Distance Covered:   - By the second meeting, the total distance covered by both cyclists together is ( 3D ).   - Cyclist ( A ) travels ( 70 + (D - 70) + (D - 90) = 2D - 90 ).   - Cyclist ( B ) travels ( (D - 70) + 70 + 90 = D + 90 ).4. Using Speed Ratios:   - The ratio of speeds ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{70}{D - 70} ).   - Using the total distances covered by each cyclist until the second meeting:     - For cyclist ( A ): ( 2D - 90 = 3D cdot frac{70}{D} )     - For cyclist ( B ): ( D + 90 = 3D cdot frac{D - 70}{D} )5. Solving the Equation:   - Substituting the speed ratio into the equations:     [     2D - 90 = 210 implies 2D = 300 implies D = 150     ]   - However, this leads to a contradiction. Re-evaluating using the correct approach:     - The correct equation derived from the positions and speeds gives ( D = 120 ) km.6. Verification:   - Checking the timeline and positions with ( D = 120 ) km confirms the second meeting is 90 km from ( B ).Thus, the distance from ( A ) to ( B ) is (boxed{120}) kilometers.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the distance between points A and B based on the information given about two cyclists meeting each other twice. Hmm, so both cyclists start at the same time from A and B, moving towards each other. They first meet 70 km from A. Then they keep moving, reach their respective destinations (A and B), turn around immediately, and meet again 90 km from B. The question is to find the total distance between A and B.Alright, let&#39;s break this down step by step. Let me denote the distance between A and B as D. That&#39;s what we need to find. Let&#39;s call the two cyclists Cyclist 1 (starting from A) and Cyclist 2 (starting from B).First, they meet 70 km from A. So, when they meet the first time, Cyclist 1 has traveled 70 km, and Cyclist 2 has traveled D - 70 km. Since they started at the same time and met each other, the time taken for both to meet would be the same. Let&#39;s denote their speeds as v1 and v2 respectively.So, time taken until first meeting: t1 = 70 / v1 = (D - 70) / v2.That gives us the ratio of their speeds. Let&#39;s write that down:v1 / v2 = 70 / (D - 70).Okay, so the ratio of their speeds is 70 to (D - 70). That might be useful later.Now, after the first meeting, they continue to their respective destinations. Cyclist 1 has to cover the remaining D - 70 km to reach B, and Cyclist 2 has to cover 70 km to reach A. Then they turn around immediately and start moving back towards each other again. Then they meet the second time 90 km from B, which is D - 90 km from A.Wait, hold on. The second meeting is 90 km from B, so that&#39;s 90 km away from point B, which is the same as D - 90 km from point A. So, the second meeting point is D - 90 km from A.But let me confirm: if the distance from B is 90 km, then from A it&#39;s total distance minus 90. Yeah, that&#39;s right.So, to find D, we need to analyze both meetings.First, let&#39;s recap:First meeting:- Cyclist 1 has traveled 70 km.- Cyclist 2 has traveled D - 70 km.- Time taken: t1 = 70 / v1 = (D - 70) / v2.After the first meeting:- Cyclist 1 continues to B, which is D - 70 km away. So, the time taken for Cyclist 1 to reach B after the first meeting is (D - 70) / v1.- Similarly, Cyclist 2 continues to A, which is 70 km away. So, time taken for Cyclist 2 to reach A after the first meeting is 70 / v2.Then, both cyclists turn around immediately and start heading back. So, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting is the time it takes for Cyclist 1 to go from first meeting point to B and turn around, plus the time until they meet again. Wait, no. Wait, actually, after the first meeting, each cyclist continues to their destination, turns around, and starts moving back. So the time between the first meeting and the second meeting would be the time for each cyclist to reach their respective destinations and then start moving back until they meet again.Wait, but they might not reach their destinations at the same time. So Cyclist 1 takes (D - 70)/v1 time to reach B after the first meeting, and Cyclist 2 takes 70/v2 time to reach A after the first meeting. If these times are different, one cyclist will have to wait for the other? Wait, no. The problem says they continue to move at the same speeds, reached A and B, and turned back. So, they don&#39;t wait; they just turn around immediately upon reaching their destinations. So, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting would be the maximum of (D - 70)/v1 and 70/v2, but since they start moving back immediately after reaching their destinations, the time until their second meeting would involve both cyclists traveling towards each other again after their respective turn-around points.Hmm, this is a bit more complex. Maybe instead of breaking it into intervals, I should consider the total distance each cyclist has traveled by the time of the second meeting.Alternatively, think about the total time elapsed until the second meeting and the total distance each has covered.Let me try this approach.First, let&#39;s denote the total time until the first meeting as t1. Then, after the first meeting, each cyclist takes some time to reach their destinations (t2 for Cyclist 1 to reach B and t3 for Cyclist 2 to reach A). Then, they start moving back and meet again after another time interval t4. So the total time until the second meeting is t1 + t2 + t3 + t4. But this seems complicated because t2 and t3 could be different.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way. Let&#39;s consider that from the start until the second meeting, the total distance covered by both cyclists together is 3D. Because, first they cover D together to meet the first time. Then, each goes to the opposite end (another D each, so 2D combined), and then they start moving towards each other again and meet after covering some distance. Wait, but when they meet the second time, the total distance covered by both would be 3D. Is that right?Wait, let&#39;s think. When two objects move towards each other, the first meeting happens when their combined distance is D. After that, they continue moving away from each other until they reach the ends (combined distance D again). Then they turn around and move towards each other again, so the next meeting would occur when they cover another D together. So total combined distance would be 3D at the second meeting. Therefore, the time taken for the second meeting would be 3 times the time taken for the first meeting. But is this accurate?Wait, let&#39;s check. Suppose the first meeting happens after time t1, where combined distance is D. Then, after that, they move away from each other, each reaching the end. The combined distance when they reach the ends would be 2D. Then they turn around and start moving towards each other again. The next meeting would happen when they cover another D, so total combined distance 3D. Therefore, if their speeds are constant, the total time until the second meeting would be 3t1. But is this true?But in reality, after the first meeting, the cyclists continue to their respective destinations, which are at different distances (Cyclist 1 has D - 70 km to go, Cyclist 2 has 70 km to go). Therefore, the time it takes each to reach their destinations is different. So the combined distance after the first meeting until they reach the ends is (D - 70) + 70 = D, so total combined distance becomes D + D = 2D. Then, when they turn around and move back, they need to cover another D to meet again, making the total combined distance 3D, but the time might not be simply 3t1 because the time taken to cover the D after turning around might be different?Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the total combined distance covered by both cyclists until the second meeting is indeed 3D. Because first D to meet, then each goes to the end (another D total), then they meet again after another D. So total 3D. Since their speeds are constant, the total time would be 3t1. Therefore, the time until the second meeting is three times the time until the first meeting.But wait, if that&#39;s the case, then the distance each cyclist has covered until the second meeting would be three times the distance they covered until the first meeting. But is that true?Wait, let&#39;s test with an example. Suppose D is 140 km. Then first meeting at 70 km from A, so Cyclist 1 has gone 70 km, Cyclist 2 has gone 70 km. Wait, that would be D = 140. Then, if they continue, Cyclist 1 goes another 70 km to B, turns around, and Cyclist 2 goes another 70 km to A, turns around. Then they start moving towards each other again. Since they both have 70 km to go to meet again. Wait, but in this case, they would meet again at the midpoint, which is 70 km from A and 70 km from B. But the problem states that the second meeting is 90 km from B, which would be D - 90 = 50 km from A if D is 140. So that&#39;s not matching.Wait, maybe the assumption that total combined distance is 3D is not correct here. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the ratio of their speeds is important here.From the first meeting, we have v1/v2 = 70/(D - 70). Let&#39;s keep that in mind.Now, let&#39;s think about the total distance each cyclist has traveled by the time of the second meeting.Cyclist 1: From A to first meeting (70 km), then from first meeting to B (D - 70 km), then from B back to the second meeting point (90 km). So total distance: 70 + (D - 70) + 90 = D + 90 km.Cyclist 2: From B to first meeting (D - 70 km), then from first meeting to A (70 km), then from A back to the second meeting point (D - 90 km). So total distance: (D - 70) + 70 + (D - 90) = 2D - 90 km.Since they started at the same time and met the second time, the total time elapsed is the same for both cyclists. Therefore, the total time can be expressed as the total distance divided by their respective speeds.So:For Cyclist 1: Total time = (D + 90) / v1For Cyclist 2: Total time = (2D - 90) / v2Since these times are equal:(D + 90)/v1 = (2D - 90)/v2But from the first meeting, we have v1/v2 = 70/(D - 70)Therefore, v2 = v1*(D - 70)/70Substitute this into the equation:(D + 90)/v1 = (2D - 90)/(v1*(D - 70)/70)Multiply both sides by v1:(D + 90) = (2D - 90)/( (D - 70)/70 )Simplify the right-hand side:(2D - 90) * (70 / (D - 70)) = 70*(2D - 90)/(D - 70)Therefore, equation becomes:D + 90 = 70*(2D - 90)/(D - 70)Now, multiply both sides by (D - 70):(D + 90)(D - 70) = 70*(2D - 90)Expand the left-hand side:D*(D - 70) + 90*(D - 70) = D^2 - 70D + 90D - 6300 = D^2 + 20D - 6300Right-hand side: 70*(2D - 90) = 140D - 6300So equation is:D^2 + 20D - 6300 = 140D - 6300Subtract 140D - 6300 from both sides:D^2 + 20D - 6300 - 140D + 6300 = 0Simplify:D^2 - 120D = 0Factor:D(D - 120) = 0Solutions are D = 0 or D = 120. Since D is a distance between two points, it must be positive, so D = 120 km.Let me check if this answer makes sense with the problem.If D = 120 km:First meeting at 70 km from A, so Cyclist 1 has traveled 70 km, Cyclist 2 has traveled 50 km. So the ratio of their speeds is 70:50 = 7:5.Then, Cyclist 1 continues to B, which is another 50 km. At speed 7 units, time taken is 50/7.Cyclist 2 continues to A, which is another 70 km. At speed 5 units, time taken is 70/5 = 14 units.So Cyclist 1 reaches B in 50/7 ≈7.14 units, turns around, and starts back. Cyclist 2 reaches A in 14 units, turns around, and starts back.So the time difference between them starting back is 14 - 50/7 ≈14 -7.14≈6.86 units. Wait, that might complicate things. But perhaps instead of looking at the time intervals, look at the total distance each has traveled until the second meeting.If D = 120 km:Total distance for Cyclist 1 until second meeting: 70 + 50 + 90 = 210 km. Wait, 70 to first meeting, 50 to B, then 90 back towards A. So total 70 + 50 + 90 = 210.Total distance for Cyclist 2 until second meeting: 50 + 70 + (120 - 90) = 50 +70 +30 = 150 km. Wait, 50 to first meeting, 70 to A, then 30 back towards B (since second meeting is 90 km from B, which is 120 -90=30 km from A). So total 50 +70 +30=150 km.Now, the ratio of their total distances should be equal to the ratio of their speeds, which was 7:5.210:150 = 7:5. Because 210 divided by 30 is 7, 150 divided by 30 is 5. So yes, 7:5. So that checks out.Alternatively, check the total time:For Cyclist 1: 210 km at speed 7 units. So time = 210 /7 = 30 units.For Cyclist 2: 150 km at speed 5 units. Time = 150 /5 =30 units. So both have the same total time, which is consistent.Therefore, D=120 km is correct.So the answer is 120 km.Final AnswerThe distance from ( A ) to ( B ) is boxed{120} kilometers.&lt;/think&gt;Let the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) be ( D ). The first meeting occurs 70 km from ( A ), so Cyclist 1 (starting from ( A )) travels 70 km, and Cyclist 2 (starting from ( B )) travels ( D - 70 ) km. The ratio of their speeds is given by:[frac{v_1}{v_2} = frac{70}{D - 70}]After the first meeting, Cyclist 1 travels the remaining ( D - 70 ) km to ( B ), turns around, and Cyclist 2 travels the remaining 70 km to ( A ), turns around. They meet again 90 km from ( B ), which is ( D - 90 ) km from ( A ).By the time of the second meeting, Cyclist 1 has traveled ( 70 + (D - 70) + 90 = D + 90 ) km, and Cyclist 2 has traveled ( (D - 70) + 70 + (D - 90) = 2D - 90 ) km. The total time taken for both cyclists to meet the second time must be equal. Using the ratio of their speeds:[frac{D + 90}{v_1} = frac{2D - 90}{v_2}]Substituting ( v_2 = frac{(D - 70)}{70} v_1 ):[frac{D + 90}{v_1} = frac{2D - 90}{frac{(D - 70)}{70} v_1}]Simplifying:[(D + 90)(D - 70) = 70(2D - 90)]Expanding and solving:[D^2 + 20D - 6300 = 140D - 6300][D^2 - 120D = 0][D(D - 120) = 0]Thus, ( D = 120 ) km (since ( D ) must be positive).The distance from ( A ) to ( B ) is boxed{120} kilometers.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-516ba452></div><p class="review-content" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>🔑:</span>7.4.

Hmm, let me think. I remember from my math class that differentiation is about finding the rate at which a function changes, right? The derivative gives the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve. Alright, the function here is y = x². I think the derivative of this function will give me another function that tells me the slope at any x-value. But how exactly do I do that? I recall something about limits being involved in the process. Maybe I should start by remembering the formal definition of a derivative. The derivative of a function f(x) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(x + h) - f(x)] divided by h. So, applying that to y = x², let&#39;s write that out. First, f(x) is x², so f(x + h) would be (x + h) squared. Let me expand that. (x + h)² is x² + 2xh + h². Then, subtracting f(x), which is x², so f(x + h) - f(x) would be x² + 2xh + h² - x². The x² terms cancel out, leaving 2xh + h². Then, divide that by h. So, [2xh + h²]/h. Let me factor out an h from the numerator: h(2x + h)/h. The h cancels out, leaving 2x + h. Now, take the limit as h approaches 0. So, as h gets really close to 0, the term h in 2x + h becomes negligible. Therefore, the limit as h approaches 0 of 2x + h is just 2x. So, the derivative of x² is 2x. Let me check if that makes sense. If I plug in x = 1, the original function y = 1, and the derivative there would be 2(1) = 2. So, the slope at x = 1 should be 2. If I plot y = x², at the point (1,1), the tangent line should have a slope of 2. That seems right because the parabola gets steeper as x increases, and at x=0, the slope would be 0, which is also correct. Wait, maybe I should verify using another method. I remember there are some shortcut rules for differentiation, like the power rule. The power rule states that if y = x^n, then the derivative dy/dx = n*x^(n-1). Applying that here, n is 2, so the derivative should be 2*x^(2-1) = 2x. Yep, that matches what I got using the limit definition. So, that must be the correct derivative. Both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence. Let me think if there&#39;s another way to check. Maybe using a graphing calculator or plotting the function and its derivative. But since I don&#39;t have one handy, I&#39;ll rely on the two methods I&#39;ve used. Alternatively, I can consider the concept of the derivative as the instantaneous rate of change. If I take two points close to each other on the parabola y = x², compute the slope between them, and see what happens as the points get closer. For example, take x and x + h. The change in y is (x + h)^2 - x^2, which is 2xh + h². The change in x is h. So, the slope is (2xh + h²)/h = 2x + h. As h approaches zero, this slope approaches 2x, which again confirms the derivative. I think that&#39;s solid. So, regardless of the approach—using the limit definition, the power rule, or the average rate of change—the derivative of y = x² is 2x. Just to recap, steps using the limit definition:1. Start with f(x) = x².2. Compute f(x + h) = (x + h)² = x² + 2xh + h².3. Find the difference quotient [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h = [x² + 2xh + h² - x²] / h = (2xh + h²)/h = 2x + h.4. Take the limit as h approaches 0: lim(h→0) (2x + h) = 2x.Alternatively, using the power rule:1. Identify the exponent n = 2.2. Multiply the coefficient by n: 1*2 = 2.3. Decrease the exponent by 1: 2 - 1 = 1.4. So, the derivative is 2x^1 = 2x.Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, the derivative of y = x² is dy/dx = 2x. I don&#39;t see any mistakes in my reasoning. All steps follow logically, and both methods confirm the answer. Maybe I can think of a real-world example. If y = x² represents the position of an object, then the derivative, 2x, would represent its velocity. For instance, at time x = 2 seconds, the velocity is 4 units per second. That seems reasonable if the object is accelerating. Wait, actually, the derivative of position is velocity, and the derivative of velocity is acceleration. So, if the velocity is 2x, then the acceleration is constant at 2 units per second squared. Yeah, that aligns with the second derivative being 2. So, everything checks out in terms of calculus concepts. Another angle: if I use the product rule. Since x squared is x times x, maybe differentiating using the product rule. Let&#39;s try that. The product rule says that the derivative of u*v is u’v + uv’. Let u = x and v = x. Then, u’ = 1 and v’ = 1. So, the derivative is (1)(x) + (x)(1) = x + x = 2x. Again, same answer. So, whether I use the limit definition, power rule, or product rule, I end up with 2x. That must be the correct derivative. I think I&#39;m confident now. The key takeaway is that the derivative measures how the function changes, and for a parabola, the slope at any point is proportional to x, which makes sense since it&#39;s symmetric around the vertex and the steepness increases as you move away from the vertex. In summary, after multiple methods and checks, the derivative of y = x² is 2x. No conflicting results, so I can be sure this is correct.Final AnswerThe derivative of the function is boxed{2x}.&lt;/think&gt;To differentiate the function ( y = x^2 ), we can use the power rule, which states that if ( y = x^n ), then the derivative ( frac{dy}{dx} = n cdot x^{n-1} ).1. Identify the exponent: In the function ( y = x^2 ), the exponent ( n ) is 2.2. Apply the power rule: Multiply the coefficient by ( n ) and decrease the exponent by 1.   [   frac{dy}{dx} = 2 cdot x^{2-1} = 2x   ]To verify, we can also use the limit definition of the derivative:1. Compute ( f(x + h) ):   [   f(x + h) = (x + h)^2 = x^2 + 2xh + h^2   ]2. Find the difference quotient:   [   frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h} = frac{2xh + h^2}{h} = 2x + h   ]3. Take the limit as ( h ) approaches 0:   [   lim_{h to 0} (2x + h) = 2x   ]Both methods confirm that the derivative of ( y = x^2 ) is ( 2x ). Final AnswerThe derivative of the function is boxed{2x}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the derivative of the function y equals x squared. Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember from class that derivatives have something to do with the rate of change or the slope of the tangent line to the function at a point. But how do I actually compute it?Wait, the problem says to differentiate y = x². I think there&#39;s a rule for differentiating functions like this. Maybe the power rule? Yeah, the power rule sounds familiar. Let me recall. The power rule states that if you have a function of the form x raised to the nth power, then its derivative is n times x raised to the (n minus one) power. So, in mathematical terms, if y = xⁿ, then dy/dx = n x^(n-1). Right?So applying that to y = x², where n is 2. Then the derivative should be 2 times x^(2-1), which is 2x. Wait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think through the definition of a derivative to confirm.The derivative of a function at a point is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(x + h) - f(x)] divided by h. So, let&#39;s use this limit definition to verify.Given f(x) = x², then f(x + h) would be (x + h)². Expanding that, it&#39;s x² + 2xh + h². So plugging into the definition:lim(h→0) [ (x² + 2xh + h² - x²) / h ]Simplifying the numerator: x² cancels out, so we have 2xh + h². Then divide by h:lim(h→0) [ 2xh / h + h² / h ] = lim(h→0) [2x + h]As h approaches 0, the term h goes to 0, so the limit is 2x. So that matches what I got using the power rule. Okay, so both methods give me the same answer. That’s reassuring.I wonder if there are any exceptions or special cases here. But x² is a simple polynomial function, so the power rule should apply without any issues. Maybe if the exponent was negative or a fraction, there would be more considerations, but here it&#39;s a positive integer exponent. So, straightforward application.Let me also recall that the derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function. So, for y = x², which is a parabola, the slope at any point x is 2x. That makes sense because as x increases, the parabola gets steeper, and the slope becomes more positive. If x is negative, the slope is negative, which also makes sense since the parabola is decreasing on the left side of the y-axis.Is there another way to check this result? Maybe using graphing. If I graph y = x², the tangent line at x = 1 should have a slope of 2(1) = 2. Let&#39;s see: at x = 1, y = 1. The tangent line there would be y = 2(x - 1) + 1. Simplifying, y = 2x - 2 + 1 = 2x - 1. If I plot that, it should just touch the parabola at (1,1) and have the correct slope. Similarly, at x = 0, the slope should be 0, which is the vertex of the parabola. That checks out too.Another thought: what if I use the product rule? Since x squared is x multiplied by x. The product rule states that the derivative of f(x)g(x) is f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x). Let&#39;s try that. Let f(x) = x and g(x) = x. Then f&#39;(x) = 1 and g&#39;(x) = 1. Plugging into the product rule:1 * x + x * 1 = x + x = 2x. So that gives the same result. Cool, so the product rule also confirms the derivative is 2x.Just to cover all bases, what if I use logarithmic differentiation? Although that might be overcomplicating things for such a simple function, but let&#39;s see. Taking natural logarithm of both sides: ln y = ln(x²) = 2 ln x. Then differentiate both sides with respect to x. The left side becomes (1/y) dy/dx, and the right side is 2*(1/x). So:(1/y) dy/dx = 2/xMultiply both sides by y:dy/dx = y * 2/x = x² * 2/x = 2x. Again, same result. So even with logarithmic differentiation, which is usually used for more complicated functions, it still works here.So after checking with the limit definition, power rule, product rule, and logarithmic differentiation, all methods consistently give the derivative as 2x. Therefore, I can be confident that the derivative of y = x² is indeed dy/dx = 2x.Just to recap: When differentiating a function like x squared, which is a basic monomial, the power rule is the most straightforward method. It&#39;s efficient because you bring down the exponent as a coefficient, reduce the exponent by one, and simplify. For more complex functions, other rules like the product, quotient, or chain rule might be necessary, but in this case, the power rule suffices.Also, understanding that the derivative 2x tells us how the function y = x² changes at any given point x. For instance, at x = 3, the slope of the tangent line is 6, meaning the function is increasing six times as fast as x at that point. Conversely, at x = -2, the slope is -4, indicating the function is decreasing there. This aligns with the graph of the parabola, which is symmetric about the y-axis and has its vertex at the origin where the slope is zero.In summary, through multiple methods and checks, the differentiation of y = x² yields the derivative dy/dx = 2x. This problem reinforces the application of fundamental differentiation rules and the importance of verifying results through different techniques to ensure accuracy.Final AnswerThe derivative of the function is boxed{2x}.&lt;/think&gt;To differentiate the function ( y = x^2 ), we can use the power rule, which states that if ( y = x^n ), then the derivative ( frac{dy}{dx} = nx^{n-1} ). Here, ( n = 2 ), so applying the power rule gives:[frac{dy}{dx} = 2x^{2-1} = 2x]To verify, we use the limit definition of the derivative:[lim_{h to 0} frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h} = lim_{h to 0} frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h} = lim_{h to 0} frac{2xh + h^2}{h} = lim_{h to 0} (2x + h) = 2x]Using the product rule, where ( f(x) = x ) and ( g(x) = x ):[frac{d}{dx}[x cdot x] = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x) = 1 cdot x + x cdot 1 = x + x = 2x]Logarithmic differentiation confirms the result as well. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:[ln y = ln(x^2) = 2 ln x]Differentiating both sides:[frac{1}{y} frac{dy}{dx} = frac{2}{x} implies frac{dy}{dx} = y cdot frac{2}{x} = x^2 cdot frac{2}{x} = 2x]All methods consistently yield the derivative ( 2x ).[boxed{2x}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-516ba452></div><p class="review-content" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>🔑:</span>Solution. 1^{0} . y_{text {n }}=(x+Delta x)^{2}=x^{2}+2 x Delta x+(Delta x)^{2}.2^{0} .

I need to find three prime numbers a, b, c such that when I multiply them together, the product is equal to five times the sum of the primes. So, the equation is abc = 5(a + b + c). And I need to figure out what these primes are, in ascending order. Alright, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Since the primes are multiplied together and the product is 5 times their sum, I guess one of the primes has to be 5? Because 5 is a prime number and it&#39;s on the right side of the equation as a coefficient. Maybe that&#39;s a clue. Let me check that. If none of the primes were 5, then the left side (abc) would not have a factor of 5, but the right side is 5 times something. So, unless the sum (a + b + c) has a factor of 5, but primes other than 5 can sum to a multiple of 5. Hmm, maybe. Let&#39;s think.But if none of a, b, c is 5, then the left side is a product of primes none of which is 5, so 5 doesn&#39;t divide abc. But the right side is 5(a + b + c), so 5 divides the right side. But if 5 doesn&#39;t divide abc, then 5 must divide (a + b + c). However, if none of the primes are 5, then a, b, c are primes from 2,3,7,11,... Let me see if their sum can be a multiple of 5. For example, 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, which is a multiple of 5. But 5 is one of the primes here, so that case includes 5. If I take primes 2,3,7: sum is 12, not a multiple of 5. 2,3,11: 16, nope. 3,7,11: 21, nope. 2,7,11: 20, which is a multiple of 5. So 2 + 7 + 11 = 20. Then abc would be 2*7*11 = 154. And 5*(20) = 100. But 154 ≠ 100. So that doesn&#39;t work. So even if the sum is a multiple of 5, the product might not equal 5 times the sum.Alternatively, if one of the primes is 5, then the left side (abc) would include 5 as a factor, and the right side is also 5 times something, so that makes sense. So maybe one of the primes has to be 5. Let&#39;s suppose that one of them is 5. Let&#39;s say, without loss of generality, that c = 5. Then the equation becomes ab*5 = 5(a + b + 5). Dividing both sides by 5, we get ab = a + b + 5. Then rearranging, ab - a - b = 5. Which can be written as (a - 1)(b - 1) = 6. Because ab - a - b + 1 = (a - 1)(b - 1). So adding 1 to both sides, ab - a - b + 1 = 6. Therefore, (a - 1)(b - 1) = 6.So now, we need to find primes a and b such that (a - 1)(b - 1) = 6. Let&#39;s note that a and b are primes greater than or equal to 2, so (a - 1) and (b - 1) are integers greater than or equal to 1. So, the pairs of integers that multiply to 6 are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). So, let&#39;s consider each pair:1. (1,6): So (a - 1) = 1 and (b - 1) = 6. Then a = 2, b = 7. Both 2 and 7 are primes. So that&#39;s a possible solution.2. (6,1): Similarly, (a - 1) = 6 and (b - 1) = 1. Then a = 7, b = 2. Since we can arrange them in ascending order later, this is the same as the first case.3. (2,3): (a - 1) = 2 and (b - 1) = 3. So a = 3, b = 4. But 4 is not a prime. So this pair is invalid.4. (3,2): (a - 1) = 3 and (b - 1) = 2. Then a = 4, b = 3. Again, 4 is not a prime. So this is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution here is a = 2, b = 7, c = 5. But since we need them in ascending order, that would be 2, 5, 7. Let me verify this. 2*5*7 = 70. The sum is 2 + 5 + 7 = 14. Then 5*14 = 70. Yes, that works. So that&#39;s a valid solution.But wait, the problem says &quot;three prime numbers,&quot; so there could be other possibilities. Maybe with two 5s? Let me check. Suppose two of the primes are 5. Let’s say a = 5 and b = 5, then c would be such that 5*5*c = 5(5 + 5 + c). Simplify left side: 25c. Right side: 5*(15 + c) = 75 + 5c. So, 25c = 75 + 5c. Subtract 5c: 20c = 75. Then c = 75/20 = 15/4. Which is 3.75, not a prime. So that&#39;s invalid. So two 5s don&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe all three primes are 5? Then 5*5*5 = 125, and 5*(5+5+5) = 5*15 = 75. 125 ≠ 75. So that&#39;s invalid.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another prime besides 5? Let&#39;s consider if two primes are 2. Let&#39;s say a = 2, b = 2. Then c would need to satisfy 2*2*c = 5*(2 + 2 + c). So 4c = 5*(4 + c) =&gt; 4c = 20 + 5c =&gt; -c = 20 =&gt; c = -20. Not a prime. Not valid. Similarly, other duplicates. If a = 2, b = 3, c = something else. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s suppose c is not 5, but maybe 2,3, and another prime. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s possible.Wait, if none of the primes is 5, then as we saw earlier, the sum (a + b + c) must be a multiple of 5, since the right side is 5 times that sum. So even if none of the primes is 5, but their sum is a multiple of 5, then it could work. Let&#39;s check. For example, take primes 2, 3, 5. But wait, 5 is included here. Wait, but if we take primes 2, 3, 7: sum is 12, which is not a multiple of 5. 2,3,11: 16, nope. 2,7,11: 20, which is a multiple of 5. Let&#39;s check that. 2*7*11 = 154. 5*(2 + 7 + 11) = 5*20 = 100. 154 ≠ 100. So that&#39;s not equal. How about 3,7,11: sum is 21, 5*21 = 105. 3*7*11 = 231 ≠ 105. Nope. 2,5,7: sum is 14, product is 70. 5*14 = 70. Oh, that&#39;s the same as earlier. So that&#39;s the case when one of the primes is 5.Another example: primes 2, 5, 7. Sum 14, product 70. 5*14=70. Correct. So that works.What about primes 5, 5, 2? But 5,5,2: product is 50, sum is 12. 5*12=60. Not equal. Doesn&#39;t work.How about 2,2,5: product is 20, sum is 9. 5*9=45. Not equal.So maybe the only solution is 2,5,7. Let&#39;s check another possibility. Suppose the primes are 2, 3, 5. Then product is 30, sum is 10. 5*10=50. Not equal.Primes 2,5,11: product 110, sum 18. 5*18=90. Not equal.Primes 3,5,7: product 105, sum 15. 5*15=75. Not equal.Primes 2,5,13: product 130, sum 20. 5*20=100. Not equal.Hmm. Let&#39;s see. If we take primes where one of them is 5, and then the other two primes multiply to (a + b + 5). So, from earlier, when c=5, we had ab = a + b +5, leading to (a-1)(b-1)=6, which gave 2,7. So that seems unique. Are there other possibilities where one of the primes is 5 but not c? For example, if a=5. Then the equation becomes 5bc =5(5 + b + c). Dividing both sides by 5: bc =5 + b + c. Then rearranged: bc - b - c =5. Then adding 1 to both sides: bc - b - c +1=6. So (b -1)(c -1)=6. Same as before. So same solutions. So b and c would be 2 and 7 again. So primes 2,5,7 again. So regardless of which prime is 5, the other two would be 2 and 7. So the ascending order is 2,5,7.Is there another set of primes where one of them is 5 but a different pair? Let me check. Suppose (a -1)(b -1) =6. The possible factor pairs are 1&amp;6, 2&amp;3. So primes a and b would be 2&amp;7, 3&amp;4, 4&amp;3, 7&amp;2. But 3&amp;4 or 4&amp;3 are invalid because 4 is not prime. Therefore, the only valid pair is 2&amp;7. So regardless, the only primes would be 2,5,7.Wait, let me confirm if there&#39;s another possible case where two primes are 5. But earlier that didn&#39;t work. For example, two primes as 5 and the third some other prime. Let&#39;s take a=5, b=5, then 5*5*c=5(5+5+c). So 25c=5*(10 + c). Divide both sides by 5: 5c=10 +c. Then 4c=10. c=2.5. Not a prime. So invalid.Alternatively, a=5, b=2, c=?Wait, if we set a=5, then the equation is 5bc=5(5 + b + c) =&gt; bc=5 + b + c. Which is the same as before. So same solution. So if a=5, then (b-1)(c-1)=6. So again, primes b and c would be 2 and 7. So 5,2,7. Which in order is 2,5,7. So same as before.Alternatively, if we consider a different starting point. Let&#39;s assume that two primes are even. But wait, the only even prime is 2. So there can be only one even prime in the set. So if two primes are even, they would have to be 2, but 2 is the only even prime. So the primes must include at most one 2. So possible combinations: either two primes are odd and one is 2, or all three are odd.But if all three are odd primes, then their sum is odd + odd + odd = odd, and their product is odd*odd*odd = odd. But the right side is 5*(sum). If sum is odd, then 5*(sum) is odd*5 = multiple of 5 and odd. But left side is odd. However, 5 is odd, so 5*odd is odd, and the product of three odds is odd. So possible. However, in this case, if all three primes are odd and not including 2, let&#39;s see if such a triplet exists.Wait, for example, primes 3,5,7. Product is 105. Sum is 15. 5*15=75. 105≠75. Not equal. Primes 3,5,11: product 165, sum 19. 5*19=95. Nope. Primes 5,7,11: product 385, sum 23. 5*23=115. Nope. So it&#39;s not working. So maybe there is no solution with all three primes being odd. Let&#39;s check.Suppose all three primes are odd. So a, b, c are odd primes. Then the product abc is odd, and the sum a + b + c is odd + odd + odd = odd. Therefore, 5(a + b + c) is 5*odd = odd. So both sides are odd. So that&#39;s possible. But does such a triplet exist?Let&#39;s see. Let me pick small primes. Let&#39;s take 3, 5, 7. Product is 105, sum is 15. 5*15=75. Not equal. Next, 3, 5, 11. Product 165, sum 19. 5*19=95. No. 3,5,13: product 195, sum 21. 5*21=105. No. 5,7,11: 385 vs 5*23=115. Nope. 3,7,11: 231 vs 5*21=105. No. So it&#39;s not happening. So maybe there is no triplet of all odd primes that satisfies this condition.Alternatively, let&#39;s see if the triplet must include 2. If that&#39;s the case, then with 2 included, let&#39;s see. So 2 is the only even prime, so if we include 2, then the product becomes even, and the sum becomes even + odd + odd = even. So 5*(even) is even. Therefore, both sides are even, which is possible. So maybe the triplet must include 2 and 5. Wait, but in the previous case where we had 2,5,7, that worked. Let&#39;s see if there are other triplets with 2 but not 5.Wait, if we have 2, another prime, and another prime. Let&#39;s say a=2, then the equation is 2bc =5(2 + b + c). Let&#39;s rearrange this: 2bc =10 +5b +5c. Then 2bc -5b -5c =10. Hmm, not sure how to factor this. Maybe try some small primes for b and c.Let me try b=3. Then plug in: 2*3*c -5*3 -5c =10 =&gt; 6c -15 -5c =10 =&gt; c -15=10 =&gt; c=25. 25 is not a prime. So invalid.Next, b=5. Then 2*5*c -5*5 -5c =10 =&gt;10c -25 -5c=10 =&gt;5c -25=10 =&gt;5c=35 =&gt;c=7. Which is prime. So here, a=2, b=5, c=7. Which is the same triplet as before. So that works.Next, try b=7. Then 2*7*c -5*7 -5c =10 =&gt;14c -35 -5c=10 =&gt;9c -35=10 =&gt;9c=45 =&gt;c=5. Which is prime. So again, same triplet: 2,5,7.If b=11: 2*11*c -5*11 -5c =10 =&gt;22c -55 -5c=10 =&gt;17c=65 =&gt;c=65/17≈3.823. Not a prime.If b=13: 2*13*c -5*13 -5c =10 =&gt;26c -65 -5c=10 =&gt;21c=75 =&gt;c=75/21≈3.571. Not a prime.If b=2: Let&#39;s see. Then a=2, b=2, so 2*2*c -5*2 -5c=10 =&gt;4c -10 -5c=10 =&gt;-c -10=10 =&gt;-c=20 =&gt;c=-20. Not prime.So in this case, the only valid solution when a=2 is when b=5 and c=7 or b=7 and c=5. Either way, the triplet is 2,5,7.Alternatively, suppose a=2, and try c=3. Then the equation is 2*b*3=5(2 + b + 3). So 6b =5(5 + b) =&gt;6b=25 +5b =&gt;b=25. Which is not prime.If c=5: 2*b*5=5(2 + b +5) =&gt;10b=5(7 + b) =&gt;10b=35 +5b =&gt;5b=35 =&gt;b=7. Which is prime. So again, triplet 2,5,7.If c=7: 2*b*7=5(2 + b +7) =&gt;14b=5(9 + b) =&gt;14b=45 +5b =&gt;9b=45 =&gt;b=5. Prime. So again, 2,5,7.If c=11: 2*b*11=5(2 + b +11) =&gt;22b=5(13 + b) =&gt;22b=65 +5b =&gt;17b=65 =&gt;b=65/17≈3.823. Not prime.So seems like the only solution with a=2 is the triplet 2,5,7. So, this seems to be the unique solution.But let&#39;s check another case where two primes are 2. Wait, primes can repeat? The problem says &quot;three prime numbers,&quot; but doesn&#39;t specify they have to be distinct. So maybe duplicates are allowed. Let&#39;s check. Suppose two of them are 2. Then the equation becomes 2*2*c=5(2 + 2 + c). So 4c=5(4 + c) =&gt;4c=20 +5c =&gt;-c=20 =&gt;c=-20. Not a prime. So invalid.If two primes are 3. Let&#39;s say a=3, b=3. Then equation is 3*3*c=5(3 + 3 + c) =&gt;9c=5(6 + c) =&gt;9c=30 +5c =&gt;4c=30 =&gt;c=7.5. Not prime.If two primes are 5. As we saw before, 5*5*c=5(5 +5 +c) =&gt;25c=5(10 +c) =&gt;5c=10 +c =&gt;4c=10 =&gt;c=2.5. Not prime.If two primes are 7. 7*7*c=5(7 +7 +c) =&gt;49c=5(14 +c) =&gt;49c=70 +5c =&gt;44c=70 =&gt;c=70/44≈1.59. Not prime.So duplicates don&#39;t work. Therefore, the primes must be distinct. So the only possible triplet is 2,5,7.Another check: Let&#39;s suppose the primes are 2,5,7. Product is 2*5*7=70. Sum is 2+5+7=14. 5*14=70. Yep, that&#39;s correct.Is there another triplet where the product is 5 times the sum? Let&#39;s check another possible case. Suppose a=2, b=3, c=5. Then product=30, sum=10. 5*10=50. Not equal. 30≠50.a=2, b=3, c=7. Product=42, sum=12. 5*12=60. Not equal.a=2, b=3, c=11. Product=66, sum=16. 5*16=80. Not equal.a=2, b=5, c=11. Product=110, sum=18. 5*18=90. Not equal.a=2, b=7, c=11. Product=154, sum=20. 5*20=100. Not equal.a=3, b=5, c=7. Product=105, sum=15. 5*15=75. Not equal.a=3, b=5, c=11. Product=165, sum=19. 5*19=95. Not equal.a=5, b=7, c=11. Product=385, sum=23. 5*23=115. Not equal.So seems like none of these work. Therefore, the only triplet that works is 2,5,7. Hence, the answer is these three primes in ascending order: 2,5,7.Final AnswerThe three prime numbers in ascending order are boxed{2}, boxed{5}, and boxed{7}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation (abc = 5(a + b + c)) where (a), (b), and (c) are prime numbers, we need to find these primes in ascending order.1. Identify the necessity of including the prime number 5:   - The right-hand side of the equation is (5(a + b + c)), which is a multiple of 5. Therefore, at least one of the primes (a), (b), or (c) must be 5 to ensure the left-hand side is also a multiple of 5.2. Assume one of the primes is 5:   - Let (c = 5). The equation simplifies to (ab cdot 5 = 5(a + b + 5)). Dividing both sides by 5, we get (ab = a + b + 5).   - Rearranging, we have (ab - a - b = 5). Adding 1 to both sides, we get ((a - 1)(b - 1) = 6).3. Solve for primes (a) and (b):   - The pairs of integers that multiply to 6 are ((1, 6)), ((2, 3)), ((3, 2)), and ((6, 1)).   - Converting these pairs to primes:     - ((a - 1, b - 1) = (1, 6)) gives (a = 2) and (b = 7) (both primes).     - Other pairs result in non-prime values for (a) or (b).4. Verify the solution:   - The primes (a = 2), (b = 7), and (c = 5) give the product (2 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 70) and the sum (2 + 5 + 7 = 14).   - Checking the equation: (5 times 14 = 70), which holds true.5. Check for other possible combinations:   - Considering other combinations of primes (including duplicates or different primes) either results in non-prime values or does not satisfy the equation.Thus, the three prime numbers in ascending order are (boxed{2}), (boxed{5}), and (boxed{7}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about finding three prime numbers a, b, c such that their product is equal to five times their sum. So, the equation given is abc = 5(a + b + c). And we need to find these primes in ascending order. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. First, since the product of the three primes is 5 times their sum, one of the primes must be 5 because the product is a multiple of 5. Because 5 is a prime number, and primes can&#39;t be factored into smaller numbers, so at least one of a, b, or c has to be 5. So, without loss of generality, let&#39;s assume that c = 5. Then the equation becomes ab*5 = 5(a + b + 5). Dividing both sides by 5, we get ab = a + b + 5. So now, we need to find primes a and b such that ab = a + b + 5. Let&#39;s rearrange this equation. Let&#39;s subtract a and b from both sides: ab - a - b = 5. Then, adding 1 to both sides: ab - a - b + 1 = 6. This can be factored as (a - 1)(b - 1) = 6. Oh, that&#39;s clever. Because (a - 1)(b - 1) = 6. Now, since a and b are primes, and primes are at least 2, so a - 1 and b - 1 are at least 1. So, we need two integers greater than or equal to 1 that multiply to 6, and then add 1 to each to get the primes. So, factors of 6 are 1*6, 2*3, 3*2, 6*1. Let&#39;s check each pair. First pair: (1,6). Then a = 1 + 1 = 2, and b = 6 + 1 = 7. Both 2 and 7 are primes. So this is a possible solution. Second pair: (2,3). Then a = 2 + 1 = 3, b = 3 + 1 = 4. But 4 is not a prime. So this pair is invalid. Third pair: (3,2). Similarly, a = 3 + 1 = 4 (not prime), b = 2 + 1 = 3 (prime). But since a is 4, which isn&#39;t prime, this is invalid. Fourth pair: (6,1). Then a = 6 + 1 = 7, b = 1 + 1 = 2. Both 7 and 2 are primes. But since we assumed ascending order, maybe we need to order them. But in terms of the equation, order doesn&#39;t matter. So, this is another solution, but it&#39;s the same primes as the first pair, just reversed. So, the possible primes a and b are 2 and 7. Therefore, the three primes are 2, 5, 7. Let me check if this satisfies the original equation. Calculating abc: 2 * 5 * 7 = 70. Calculating 5(a + b + c): 5*(2 + 5 + 7) = 5*14 = 70. So yes, 70 = 70. So that works. But wait, are there other possibilities? Let me check again. Because maybe we considered c = 5, but maybe a or b could be 5 instead. Let&#39;s see. Suppose a = 5. Then the equation becomes 5*b*c = 5(5 + b + c). Dividing both sides by 5: bc = 5 + b + c. Then, rearranging: bc - b - c = 5. Adding 1 to both sides: bc - b - c + 1 = 6. Which factors as (b - 1)(c - 1) = 6. So same as before. So factors of 6 again. So again, possible pairs: (1,6), (2,3), etc. So, (1,6): b = 2, c = 7. So primes 5, 2, 7. Which is the same set as before. Similarly, (6,1): b = 7, c = 2. So again, same primes. If we take (2,3): b = 3, c = 4. But 4 is not prime. So same issue. So no new primes here. Similarly, if we set b = 5, then same process. So regardless of which prime we set as 5, the other two primes are 2 and 7, so the triplet is 2,5,7. But wait, maybe there&#39;s another prime number that when multiplied gives the same result. Let&#39;s check if there could be another prime number involved. For example, if all three primes are 5. Then 5*5*5 = 125. 5*(5 + 5 +5) = 5*15 = 75. Not equal. So that&#39;s not a solution. What if two of them are 5? Let&#39;s say a = 5, b =5. Then the equation becomes 5*5*c = 5*(5 +5 +c). Simplify: 25c = 5*(10 + c) =&gt; 25c = 50 + 5c =&gt; 20c = 50 =&gt; c = 50/20 = 2.5, which is not a prime. So invalid. What if all three primes are different? Well, we already considered that. So 2,5,7. Are there other primes? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s check the next primes. Let&#39;s suppose one of the primes is 3. Let me try assuming a different approach. Let me suppose that one of the primes is 3. Let me see if that works. Suppose c = 3. Then the equation becomes ab*3 = 5(a + b +3). So 3ab = 5a + 5b + 15. Let&#39;s rearrange: 3ab -5a -5b = 15. Hmm, this seems a bit more complicated. Maybe we can try to factor this equation. Let&#39;s see. 3ab -5a -5b = 15. Let&#39;s add 25/3 to both sides? Wait, maybe use the method of Simon&#39;s Favorite Factoring Trick. Let me see. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the coefficients: 9ab -15a -15b = 45. Then add 25 to both sides: 9ab -15a -15b +25 = 70. Hmm, not sure if that factors neatly. Alternatively, let&#39;s try to factor. Alternatively, maybe pick some primes. Let&#39;s suppose a = 2. Then plug into equation: 3*2*b -5*2 -5b = 15. So 6b -10 -5b =15. So (6b -5b) = b. So b -10 =15. So b=25. But 25 is not a prime. So that&#39;s invalid. If a=3, then 3*3*b -5*3 -5b =15. So 9b -15 -5b =15. So 4b -15=15. 4b=30. b=7.5. Not prime. If a=5, then 3*5*b -5*5 -5b=15. So 15b -25 -5b=15. So 10b -25=15. 10b=40. b=4. Not prime. If a=7, then 3*7*b -5*7 -5b=15. 21b -35 -5b=15. 16b=50. b=50/16=25/8. Not integer. So, seems like when c=3, there&#39;s no solution. Similarly, let&#39;s check c=7. So, equation becomes ab*7 =5(a + b +7). So 7ab =5a +5b +35. Then, 7ab -5a -5b =35. Again, this might be tricky. Let&#39;s try some small primes. Let a=2. Then 7*2*b -5*2 -5b=35. 14b -10 -5b=35. 9b=45. b=5. Which is prime. So a=2, b=5, c=7. Which is the same solution as before. So abc=2*5*7=70. 5*(2+5+7)=5*14=70. So that&#39;s the same solution. If a=3, then 7*3*b -5*3 -5b=35. 21b -15 -5b=35. 16b=50. b=50/16=25/8. Not prime. If a=5, then 7*5*b -5*5 -5b=35. 35b -25 -5b=35. 30b=60. b=2. Which is prime. So again, a=5, b=2, c=7. Same trio. So, regardless of which prime we fix, the solution ends up being 2,5,7. Alternatively, let&#39;s check if c=2. Then equation becomes ab*2=5(a + b +2). So 2ab =5a +5b +10. Let&#39;s rearrange: 2ab -5a -5b =10. Let&#39;s try to factor this. Again, maybe use Simon&#39;s Trick. Multiply both sides by 2: 4ab -10a -10b =20. Then add 25: 4ab -10a -10b +25=45. Now, factor the left side: (2a -5)(2b -5)=45. So, (2a -5)(2b -5)=45. Factors of 45 are 1*45, 3*15, 5*9, 9*5, 15*3, 45*1. Let&#39;s check each pair. First pair: 1*45. So, 2a -5=1 =&gt; 2a=6 =&gt;a=3. 2b -5=45 =&gt;2b=50 =&gt;b=25. Not prime. Second pair: 3*15. 2a -5=3 =&gt;2a=8 =&gt;a=4. Not prime. Third pair: 5*9. 2a -5=5 =&gt;2a=10 =&gt;a=5. 2b -5=9 =&gt;2b=14 =&gt;b=7. Both primes. So a=5, b=7. Then c=2. So primes 2,5,7. Same as before. Fourth pair:9*5. 2a -5=9 =&gt;2a=14 =&gt;a=7. 2b -5=5 =&gt;2b=10 =&gt;b=5. Primes again. Fifth pair:15*3. 2a -5=15 =&gt;a=10. Not prime. Sixth pair:45*1. 2a -5=45 =&gt;a=25. Not prime. So again, the solution is 2,5,7. So, regardless of which prime we fix as c=2,5, or7, we end up with the same trio. Therefore, the only solution is 2,5,7. Let me check if there&#39;s a possibility with higher primes. Let&#39;s suppose that one of the primes is 11. Let&#39;s try c=11. Then the equation is ab*11=5(a + b +11). So 11ab =5a +5b +55. Let&#39;s rearrange:11ab -5a -5b=55. Trying to factor this seems complicated, but let&#39;s attempt to use Simon&#39;s Trick. Multiply through by 11: 121ab -55a -55b = 605. Then add 25 to both sides:121ab -55a -55b +25=630. Then factor: (11a -5)(11b -5)=630. Now, 630 has factors like 1*630, 2*315, 3*210, 5*126, 6*105, 7*90, 9*70, 10*63, 14*45, 15*42, 18*35, 21*30, etc. Let&#39;s check some of these. Take (11a -5)=10 and (11b -5)=63. Then 11a=15 =&gt; a=15/11, not integer. Or (11a -5)=14, (11b -5)=45. 11a=19 =&gt;a=19/11, nope. (11a -5)=15, (11b -5)=42. 11a=20 =&gt;a=20/11, nope. (11a -5)=21, (11b -5)=30. 11a=26 =&gt;a=26/11. Not integer. Alternatively, (11a -5)=5, (11b -5)=126. Then 11a=10 =&gt;a=10/11. Not prime. (11a -5)=1, (11b -5)=630. 11a=6 =&gt;a=6/11. Nope. Similarly, trying other factor pairs leads to fractional a or b, which are not primes. So, c=11 doesn&#39;t seem to yield any solutions. Similarly, trying c=13. The equation would be ab*13=5(a + b +13). 13ab -5a -5b=65. Again, using Simon&#39;s Trick: Multiply by 13: 169ab -65a -65b=845. Add 25:169ab -65a -65b +25=870. Factor: (13a -5)(13b -5)=870. Factor pairs of 870... This might take a while, but likely to result in non-integer primes. Alternatively, pick a small prime for a. Let a=2. Then 13*2*b -5*2 -5b=65. 26b -10 -5b=65. 21b=75. b=75/21≈3.57. Not prime. a=3. 13*3*b -5*3 -5b=65. 39b -15 -5b=65. 34b=80. b=80/34≈2.35. Not prime. a=5. 13*5*b -5*5 -5b=65. 65b -25 -5b=65. 60b=90. b=1.5. Not prime. a=7. 13*7*b -5*7 -5b=65. 91b -35 -5b=65. 86b=100. b≈1.16. Not prime. So, c=13 also gives no solution. Given that when c increases, the product abc grows much faster than 5(a + b +c). For example, if primes are 2,5,7, sum is 14, product is 70, which is 5 times 14. If we take larger primes, the product would be way larger than 5 times the sum. For example, primes 2,5,11: product is 110, sum is 18, 5*18=90. 110≠90. So, too big. Similarly, 2,5,13: product 130, sum 20, 5*20=100. Still bigger. So, the trend is that as primes get larger, the product increases much more rapidly than the sum. Hence, the only possible solution is the small primes 2,5,7. Therefore, the three primes in ascending order are 2,5,7.Final AnswerThe three prime numbers in ascending order are boxed{2}, boxed{5}, and boxed{7}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation (abc = 5(a + b + c)) where (a), (b), and (c) are prime numbers, we need to find these primes in ascending order.1. Identify the prime factor 5: Since the product (abc) is a multiple of 5, one of the primes must be 5. Assume (c = 5). The equation simplifies to:   [   ab cdot 5 = 5(a + b + 5) implies ab = a + b + 5   ]   Rearranging gives:   [   ab - a - b = 5 implies (a - 1)(b - 1) = 6   ]   The factors of 6 are (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (6, 1). Testing these pairs:   - ((a - 1, b - 1) = (1, 6)) gives (a = 2) and (b = 7)   - Other pairs result in non-prime numbers.2. Verify the solution: The primes (a = 2), (b = 7), and (c = 5) satisfy the original equation:   [   2 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 70 quad text{and} quad 5(2 + 5 + 7) = 70   ]3. Check other permutations: Considering different positions for the prime 5 (as (a) or (b)) and verifying with the same method leads to the same primes 2, 5, and 7.4. Conclusion: Testing higher primes shows that the product grows too rapidly compared to the sum, confirming that the only solution is with the primes 2, 5, and 7.Thus, the three prime numbers in ascending order are (boxed{2}), (boxed{5}), and (boxed{7}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-516ba452></div><p class="review-content" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>🔑:</span>6. 2,5,7.From a b c=5(a+b+c) and a, b, c are all prime numbers, we know that one of these three numbers must be equal to 5.Without loss of generality, let a=5, and b&gt;c.

Some boys danced with some girls, and each pair danced no more than once. After the ball, each person told their parents how many times they danced. The question is asking for the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned. Hmm, right. So basically, we need to figure out the maximum number of distinct dance counts that the boys and girls could have had. Since each dance involves one boy and one girl, the total number of dances is limited by the number of possible pairs, but also by the fact that each dance is counted once per person involved. Let me start by recalling some concepts. This seems related to bipartite graphs, where we have two sets of nodes (boys and girls) and edges representing dances between them. The problem is then about assigning degrees to the nodes such that the number of distinct degrees is maximized. However, there are constraints: the degrees on the boys&#39; side (29 nodes) and the girls&#39; side (15 nodes) must form a bipartite graph, which means that the sum of the degrees on the boys&#39; side must equal the sum of the degrees on the girls&#39; side. That’s the handshaking lemma, right?So, our goal is to maximize the number of distinct degrees across all 29 boys and 15 girls. But the degrees have to satisfy that the sum for boys equals the sum for girls. Also, each dance is between a boy and a girl, so the degrees for each boy can range from 0 to 15 (since there are 15 girls), and the degrees for each girl can range from 0 to 29. Wait, but since we want as many different numbers as possible, we need to arrange the degrees so that the boys have as many distinct degrees as possible and the girls also have as many distinct degrees as possible, but without overlapping numbers? Or maybe overlapping is allowed, but we need the union of their degrees to be as large as possible. Let me clarify.The problem says, &quot;What is the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned?&quot; Since the children include both boys and girls, it&#39;s the total number of distinct numbers mentioned by all 44 children. So, if a number is mentioned by both a boy and a girl, it still counts as one distinct number. Therefore, we need the union of the degrees of boys and girls to have as many elements as possible.Therefore, our task is to assign degrees to boys and girls such that:1. The sum of the boys&#39; degrees equals the sum of the girls&#39; degrees.2. Each boy&#39;s degree is between 0 and 15 (inclusive).3. Each girl&#39;s degree is between 0 and 29 (inclusive).4. The union of the set of boys&#39; degrees and the set of girls&#39; degrees has maximum possible size.So, to maximize the number of distinct numbers, we need as many different degrees as possible on both sides, but making sure that the sum of degrees on both sides is equal.This seems like a problem where we have to interleave the possible degrees on the boys and girls sides as much as possible to avoid overlap, but also respecting the constraints on their maximum degrees.Let me think about how to approach this. Let&#39;s consider that boys can have degrees from 0 to 15, and girls from 0 to 29. If we can arrange the degrees so that the boys use numbers 0 to 15 and the girls use numbers 16 to 29, then we can have 30 distinct numbers (0-29). However, is that possible? Because the problem is that the girls can go up to 29, but boys can only go up to 15. But the girls can have higher degrees, but the boys can&#39;t. So if we want the girls to have degrees from 16 to 29, that&#39;s 14 numbers (16-29 inclusive), but girls are only 15 in number. Wait, 16 to 29 is 14 numbers. But there are 15 girls. So if each girl has a unique degree from 16 to 29, but there are only 14 numbers there, so one girl would have to repeat a number. So that might not work. Alternatively, maybe starting at a different point.Alternatively, perhaps arrange the girls&#39; degrees from 0 to 14 and boys&#39; degrees from 15 to 29. But boys can only have degrees up to 15, so 15 is their maximum. So that doesn&#39;t work. So maybe the boys can have degrees 0 to 15 (16 distinct numbers) and the girls can have degrees 0 to 29 (30 distinct numbers). But the problem is the overlap between 0 to 15. So if the boys use 0 to 15 and the girls use 0 to 29, the total distinct numbers would be 30 (0-29). However, we need the union, so if the boys use some numbers and the girls use others, but overlapping. Wait, but if the girls use 0-29 and the boys use 0-15, then the union is 0-29, which is 30 numbers. But can we actually achieve that?Wait, but the girls can&#39;t have degrees higher than 29, which they can, since there are 29 boys. So a girl can dance with up to 29 boys. So a girl&#39;s degree can be from 0 to 29. Similarly, a boy can dance from 0 to 15. So if we have boys with degrees 0-15 and girls with degrees 0-29, then the union is 0-29, which is 30 numbers. But can such a configuration exist where boys have degrees 0-15 (each number appearing at least once) and girls have degrees 0-29 (each number appearing at least once), and the sums match?Wait, that seems impossible because the boys are only 29. If the boys have degrees from 0-15, so 16 different degrees. But there are 29 boys. So by the pigeonhole principle, some degrees must be repeated among the boys. Similarly, the girls are 15, so if we want the girls to have degrees from 0-29, but there are only 15 girls, we can have at most 15 different degrees for the girls. So even if we tried, the maximum number of distinct degrees for girls is 15. Therefore, the maximum possible union would be boys having 16 distinct degrees (0-15) and girls having 15 distinct degrees, none overlapping. Then the total would be 16 + 15 = 31. But is this possible?Wait, but if we have boys with degrees 0-15 (16 distinct numbers) and girls with degrees 16-30 (15 distinct numbers), but girls can only go up to 29. So 16-29 is 14 numbers. Wait, 16 to 29 is 14 numbers. So girls can have 14 distinct degrees if we go from 16-29, but there are 15 girls. So one girl would have to repeat a degree. So that&#39;s 15 girls with 14 distinct degrees. Alternatively, maybe girls can have degrees 15-29. But 15 is overlapping with the boys&#39; maximum degree of 15. So that would be 15 distinct degrees for girls (15-29), but 15-29 is 15 numbers. But there are 15 girls, so each girl can have a unique degree from 15-29. However, the boys also have degree 15. So the union would be boys: 0-15 (16 numbers) and girls:15-29 (15 numbers). So the total distinct numbers would be 0-29, which is 30 numbers. But can such a configuration exist where boys have 0-15 and girls have 15-29, with the sums matching?Wait, but the sum of the boys&#39; degrees would be the sum of 0 to 15, but multiplied by how many boys have each degree. Wait, but we have 29 boys. If we want each degree from 0 to 15 to be used at least once, we need to have 16 different degrees. So 29 boys, 16 degrees. So some degrees will have to be used multiple times. Similarly, the girls have 15 girls, and if we use degrees 15 to 29, that&#39;s 15 degrees. So each girl can have a unique degree from 15 to 29.So let&#39;s suppose the boys have degrees 0 to 15. To cover 29 boys, we need to assign 16 different degrees, each at least once. So 16 boys have degrees 0 to 15 (one each), and the remaining 13 boys would need to have degrees that are duplicates. Similarly, the girls have degrees 15 to 29, each of the 15 girls has a unique degree from 15 to 29.Now, the key is whether the sum of the boys&#39; degrees can equal the sum of the girls&#39; degrees. Let&#39;s compute these sums.Sum of girls&#39; degrees: 15 + 16 + ... + 29. That&#39;s an arithmetic series from 15 to 29 inclusive. There are 15 terms. The sum is (15 + 29) * 15 / 2 = 44 * 15 / 2 = 22 * 15 = 330.Sum of boys&#39; degrees: If we have one boy for each degree from 0 to 15, that&#39;s 16 boys with sum 0 + 1 + ... +15 = (15*16)/2 = 120. Then we have 29 - 16 = 13 more boys. To maximize the total sum, we would want to assign the highest possible degrees to the extra boys. Since the maximum degree a boy can have is 15, each of these 13 boys would add 15 to the sum. So total sum would be 120 + 13*15 = 120 + 195 = 315.But 315 is less than 330, which is the sum of the girls&#39; degrees. So the sums don&#39;t match. Therefore, this configuration is invalid.Alternatively, maybe the girls can&#39;t have such a high sum. Wait, but if the girls have degrees 15 to 29, their sum is fixed at 330, but the boys can&#39;t reach that sum unless we adjust their degrees.Alternatively, perhaps if we adjust the boys&#39; degrees higher. Wait, but the boys can&#39;t go beyond 15. So the maximum sum the boys can have is if all 29 boys danced 15 times. That would be 29*15 = 435. But the girls&#39; sum in this case is 330, which is less. So in this case, the boys&#39; sum is higher. Wait, but in our previous example, when we tried to have boys with 0-15 and girls with 15-29, the boys&#39; sum was 315 and girls&#39; was 330, which is a problem because they need to be equal.Hmm. So perhaps that approach doesn&#39;t work. Maybe we need a different way to assign degrees so that the sums can match.Alternatively, maybe overlap some degrees between boys and girls to allow the sums to be adjusted.For example, if both boys and girls have some overlapping degrees, then we can adjust the number of people with those degrees to make the sums match.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that the maximum number of distinct degrees possible is the sum of the maximum distinct degrees possible on each side, but subtracting overlaps. However, in order to maximize the total distinct numbers, we need to minimize overlaps. But due to the constraints on the sums, maybe some overlaps are necessary.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s better to model this as an optimization problem where we try to maximize the number of distinct degrees, given the constraints on the sums.Wait, perhaps we can model this as two sequences: one for boys and one for girls. Each sequence must consist of integers within their respective ranges (0-15 for boys, 0-29 for girls), and the sum of the boys&#39; sequence must equal the sum of the girls&#39; sequence.We need to find two such sequences where the union of their elements has maximum size.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of degree sequences in bipartite graphs. The question then becomes, what is the maximum number of distinct degrees possible in a bipartite graph with partitions of size 29 and 15, where one partition has degrees between 0 and 15 and the other between 0 and 29.But I might need to recall some theorems or algorithms related to degree sequences in bipartite graphs. For a bipartite graph with partitions A and B, a pair of sequences (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) and (b_1, b_2, ..., b_m) is graphical if and only if the sum of the a_i equals the sum of the b_j, and for every k, the sum of the first k a_i sorted in non-increasing order is less than or equal to the sum of the first k b_j sorted in non-increasing order, plus the sum of the remaining b_j. Wait, maybe that&#39;s the Gale-Ryser theorem.Yes, the Gale-Ryser theorem states that for two partitions of sizes n and m, a pair of non-increasing sequences (a_1 &gt;= a_2 &gt;= ... &gt;= a_n) and (b_1 &gt;= b_2 &gt;= ... &gt;= b_m) is graphical if and only if the sum of the a_i equals the sum of the b_j, and for all 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n, the sum of the first k a_i &lt;= sum_{j=1}^m min(b_j, k).But perhaps applying this theorem here would be complicated. However, maybe we can think heuristically. To maximize the number of distinct degrees, we need as many different degrees as possible on both sides. So, for the boys, since there are 29 of them and they can have degrees from 0 to 15, the maximum number of distinct degrees they can have is 16 (0-15). Similarly, the girls, with 15 girls, can have up to 15 distinct degrees (from 0 to 29). However, if we try to have 16 distinct degrees for boys and 15 for girls, we need to check if such sequences can coexist with the sum condition.But as we saw earlier, the problem arises when trying to match the sums. So perhaps we need to find the maximum number of distinct degrees such that the sum of the boys&#39; degrees can equal the sum of the girls&#39; degrees.Alternatively, maybe we can construct such sequences. Let me try to think step by step.Suppose we try to have as many distinct degrees as possible. Let&#39;s start with the boys. Since there are 29 boys, and their degrees can be from 0 to 15, the maximum number of distinct degrees is 16 (0-15). However, to have all 16 degrees, we need at least one boy for each degree. Then, the remaining 29 - 16 = 13 boys can have any degrees, preferably repeating the higher degrees to maximize the sum. But as before, the sum of the boys&#39; degrees would be 0 + 1 + ... + 15 + 13*15 = 120 + 195 = 315.For the girls, to have as many distinct degrees as possible, there are 15 girls, so they can have 15 distinct degrees. To maximize the number of distinct degrees, they could have degrees from 0 to 14, but that would only give 15 distinct numbers. Alternatively, maybe spread them out more. For example, if we have girls with degrees from 15 to 29, but 15 to 29 is 15 numbers, so each girl can have a unique degree from 15 to 29. The sum would be 15 + 16 + ... + 29. Let&#39;s calculate that.The sum from 15 to 29 inclusive is equal to the sum from 1 to 29 minus the sum from 1 to 14. So that&#39;s (29*30)/2 - (14*15)/2 = 435 - 105 = 330. So girls&#39; sum would be 330.But boys&#39; sum in this case is 315, which is less than 330. So the sums don&#39;t match. So this is a problem.Alternatively, if we can adjust the girls&#39; degrees to have a sum of 315. But if the girls have 15 distinct degrees, the minimal sum would be 0 + 1 + ... +14 = (14*15)/2 = 105. The maximum sum would be 15 + 16 + ... +29 = 330 as above.But 315 is between 105 and 330. So can we arrange 15 distinct degrees for girls that sum to 315? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s suppose the girls have degrees from x to x + 14, where x is some starting number. The sum would be 15x + (0 + 1 + ... +14) = 15x + 105. We need 15x + 105 = 315. So 15x = 210 =&gt; x = 14. Therefore, degrees 14 to 28. Sum is 15*14 + 105 = 210 + 105 = 315. Perfect. So if the girls have degrees 14 to 28, each girl having a unique degree, the sum is 315, matching the boys&#39; sum.Wait, but girls can have degrees up to 29, so 14 to 28 is within their range. But then the boys have degrees 0 to 15 (sum 315), girls have degrees 14 to 28 (sum 315). Then the union of degrees is 0 to 15 and 14 to 28. So overlapping at 14 and 15. Therefore, the distinct numbers are 0 to 28, which is 29 numbers. But let&#39;s check:Boys: 0-15 (16 numbers)Girls:14-28 (15 numbers)Overlap:14 and15Total distinct numbers:16 +15 -2 =29.So 29 distinct numbers. Is this achievable?Wait, let&#39;s check the details. For the boys: 29 boys. We need to have each degree from 0 to15 represented at least once. That&#39;s 16 degrees. Then, the remaining 13 boys can have degrees from 0 to15. To get the total sum of 315, as before, the initial 16 boys (0-15) sum to 120, and the remaining 13 boys need to add 315 -120 =195. Since each of these 13 boys can have at most 15, 13*15=195. So exactly, each of the remaining 13 boys must have degree 15. So the boys&#39; degrees would be: 0,1,2,...,15 (each once) and 15 thirteen times. So the boys have degrees: 0,1,2,...,15,15,...,15 (with 13 extra 15s). So in total, the boys have 16 distinct degrees:0-15.The girls have degrees 14-28, each once. So that&#39;s 15 distinct degrees:14-28.So the union of boys&#39; and girls&#39; degrees is 0-28, except that 14 and15 are included in both. So total distinct numbers mentioned are 0-28, which is 29 numbers. Wait, 0 to28 is 29 numbers. So 29 different numbers. Is this the maximum possible?But earlier I thought that girls could have degrees up to29, so if we can include 29 somehow. But in this configuration, the girls&#39; highest degree is28. If we could have a girl with degree29, but still have the sum match. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we try to adjust the girls&#39; degrees to include29. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s have 14 girls with degrees14 to27, and one girl with degree29. Then the sum would be (14+27)*14/2 +29 = (41*14)/2 +29= 287 +29=316. But the boys&#39; sum is315. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe adjust differently.Alternatively, let&#39;s have girls with degrees15 to29. Their sum would be (15+29)*15/2 =44*15/2=330. But boys&#39; sum is315, which is less. So not matching.Alternatively, if we decrease one of the girls&#39; degrees by1, making her degree14 instead of15. Then the sum becomes330 -1=329. Still higher than315.Alternatively, decrease more. Suppose we take the girls&#39; degrees as x to28, with one at29. Let me think. Maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider another approach. Let&#39;s say the boys have degrees0 to14 (15 distinct numbers) and the girls have degrees15 to29 (15 distinct numbers). Then the union is0-29, which is30 numbers. Wait, boys:0-14 (15 numbers), girls:15-29 (15 numbers). So total distinct numbers30. But can we have such a configuration where the sums match?Sum of boys&#39; degrees:0+1+...+14=105. But there are29 boys. If boys are to have degrees0-14, each at least once, that&#39;s15 boys. The remaining14 boys would need to have degrees from0-14. Let&#39;s assume they all take the maximum possible, which is14. Then the total sum would be105 +14*14=105 +196=301.Sum of girls&#39; degrees:15+16+...+29=330. 301 vs330. Doesn&#39;t match.Alternatively, if we let the boys have higher degrees. Wait, but boys can only go up to15. Wait, in this case, the boys have degrees0-14. If we allow one boy to have15, then the degrees for boys would be0-15 (16 numbers). But then the girls would have15-29. Let me check:Boys:0-15 (16 distinct degrees). Let&#39;s have one boy for each degree0-15 (16 boys), and remaining13 boys have15. Sum:0+1+...+15 +13*15=120+195=315.Girls:15-29 (15 distinct degrees). Sum:15+16+...+29=330. Doesn&#39;t match. Wait, same as before.But if girls can have degrees14-28, sum315. Then union is0-15 and14-28, overlapping at14 and15. So total29 distinct numbers. Alternatively, can we adjust girls to have14-28 except one has29? Let&#39;s see:Girls&#39; degrees:14,15,...,27,29 (14 degrees from14-27, which is14 numbers, plus29). So total15 girls. The sum would be(14+27)*14/2 +29= (41*14)/2 +29= 287 +29=316. Boys&#39; sum is315. Close but not equal.Alternatively, decrease one girl&#39;s degree by1: So one girl has28 instead of29. Then sum is316 -1=315. So girls&#39; degrees:14,15,...,27,28. Wait, but14-28 is15 numbers. Exactly. So 14-28 inclusive is15 numbers. So sum would be(14+28)*15/2=42*15/2=315. Ah, perfect.So girls&#39; degrees14-28, sum315. Boys&#39; degrees:0-15 (16 degrees) with sum315. So union of degrees is0-28. Because boys have0-15 and girls have14-28. Overlap at14 and15. So total distinct numbers0-28, which is29 numbers. So this seems to work. So boys:0-15 (each at least once, with 13 extra boys at15). Girls:14-28 (each once). Sum for both is315. So the distinct numbers mentioned are0-28, total29.Is there a way to get30 distinct numbers? That would require having all numbers from0-29 mentioned. But girls can go up to29, boys can go up to15. So to get29 mentioned, we need a girl to have29. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible.Suppose one girl dances29 times. Then her degree is29. The remaining14 girls need to have degrees such that the total sum is315 (to match the boys&#39; sum). So sum of girls&#39; degrees would be29 + sum of other14 girls. So sum of other14 girls is315 -29=286.Now, the remaining14 girls need to have degrees between0 and28 (since one girl is already using29), and their sum is286. What&#39;s the maximum possible sum for14 girls? If each dances28 times, sum is14*28=392, which is more than286. The minimum sum is0. So 286 is feasible. But can we arrange14 girls with degrees from0-28 (each at least0, at most28) summing to286, and also having all degrees from0-28 except29? Wait, but there are14 girls. To get as many distinct degrees as possible for the girls, we would need each of the14 girls to have a unique degree. But since we have14 girls, they can have14 distinct degrees. Let&#39;s say they have degrees0-13. Then their sum is0+1+...+13=91. 91 +29=120. Which is way below315. Not enough. Alternatively, if they have degrees15-28. That&#39;s14 numbers. Sum from15-28: (15+28)*14/2=43*7=301. 301 +29=330. Which is higher than315. Not good.Alternatively, degrees14-27. Sum from14-27: (14+27)*14/2=41*7=287. 287 +29=316. Still higher than315. If we reduce one girl&#39;s degree by1, making her26 instead of27. Then sum is287 -1=286. So girls&#39; degrees would be14-26 and28, with one girl at28? Wait, no. Let me recast.If we have one girl at29, and the other14 girls need to sum to286. Let&#39;s try to have the other14 girls with degrees as high as possible but without overlapping the boys&#39; degrees. Wait, but boys have degrees0-15. If the girls (other than the one with29) have degrees16-28, that&#39;s13 degrees (16-28). But there are14 girls. So one girl would need to have a duplicate or go lower.Alternatively, have14 girls with degrees16-29, but one is already at29, so the rest are16-28. But 16-28 is13 numbers, so one girl would have to repeat a degree. So they can&#39;t all be unique. Therefore, maximum distinct degrees here would be13 for these14 girls. So the total distinct degrees for girls would be1 (for29) +13 (for16-28) =14. But the boys have degrees0-15 (16 numbers). So the union would be0-15 and16-29, which is0-29, except that the girls have14 degrees (16-29) but one is missing. Wait, because girls have degrees16-28 (13 numbers) plus29, so14-28 is15 numbers. Wait, confusion here.Wait, if we have one girl at29, and the other14 girls have degrees16-28, which is13 numbers. Since there are14 girls, one degree would have to be repeated. So they can&#39;t all be unique. Therefore, the girls would have degrees16-28 (13 distinct) plus29, and one duplicate. So total distinct degrees for girls is14. Boys have0-15 (16). The union is0-15 and16-29, but since girls have16-28 and29, and boys have0-15, the union is0-29, which is30 numbers. However, the problem is that the girls can&#39;t actually cover16-28 and29 with distinct degrees because there are14 girls. So one degree is missing between16-28. Therefore, the union would be missing that number. For example, if one girl is at29, and the other14 girls are16-28 except for one missing number. Suppose they are16-28 without17. Then the union would be0-29 except17, which is29 numbers. Alternatively, maybe the duplicated degree is within16-28, so the union is still0-29. Wait, no. If you have one girl at29, and 14 girls with degrees16-28 with one duplicate, then the duplicated degree is within16-28, so all numbers16-28 are covered except one. Wait, no. If you have14 girls and13 degrees (16-28), by pigeonhole principle, one degree is used twice. Therefore, all degrees16-28 are covered except for one, which is omitted. So the union would be0-15 (boys),16-28 except one, and29. So total distinct numbers:16 +13 +1=30. Wait,16 (boys) +13 (girls&#39; degrees16-28 except one) +1 (29) =30. But since one number is missing from16-28, so the total is16 + (14 -1) +1=30. Wait, maybe.Wait, let me do an example. Suppose we have one girl at29, and the other14 girls have degrees16-28. Since16-28 is13 numbers, one of them has to be duplicated. For example, two girls have degree16, and one each from17-28. Then the girls&#39; degrees are16,16,17-28,29. So the distinct degrees are16-29, except that16 is duplicated. So the distinct numbers are16-29 (14 numbers) plus29, but wait,16-29 is14 numbers (16 to29 inclusive is14 numbers). Wait, no. 16 to29 is14 numbers. Wait, 29 -16 +1=14. So16-29 is14 numbers. But if we have two girls at16 and one each from17-28, then the distinct degrees are16-29, which is14 numbers. So the union with the boys&#39; degrees0-15 would be0-29, which is30 numbers. But wait, the girls have16-29 (14 numbers) and the boys have0-15 (16 numbers). So union is0-29. But how?Wait,16-29 is14 numbers. 0-15 is16 numbers. Together, they make0-29, which is30 numbers. Therefore, if the girls can have16-29, even with duplicates, but all numbers16-29 are present at least once, then the union would be0-29. However, in reality, in our scenario, the girls have degrees16-29 but with one number missing. Wait, no. Wait, girls have14 girls. If we want all numbers16-29 (14 numbers), then each girl can have a unique degree from16-29. Then the girls&#39; degrees would be16-29, each once. Then the sum would be16+17+...+29. Let&#39;s calculate that.Sum from16-29: (16+29)*14/2=45*7=315. Boys&#39; sum is315 as well. Wait, this works!Wait, if girls have degrees16-29 (14 numbers) but there are15 girls. Wait, 16-29 is14 numbers. So one girl would have to have a duplicate degree. Wait, but we have15 girls. If we have one girl at29 and the other14 girls from16-28 (13 numbers). Wait, this is confusing.Wait, wait. Let&#39;s recast. If girls have degrees16-29, which is14 numbers (16,17,...,29). To have each degree represented once, we need14 girls. But we have15 girls. So one girl has to have a duplicate. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible for girls to have all degrees16-29. They can have14 distinct degrees and one duplicate. Therefore, the union would include all degrees16-29 except one, which is missing. Therefore, the total distinct numbers would be0-15 (16 numbers) and16-29 except one (13 numbers), totaling16+13=29. Plus the missing one is not included. So total29. However, if we have one girl at29, and the other14 girls have degrees16-28 (13 numbers) with one duplicate. Then girls&#39; degrees are16-28 (13 numbers) with one duplicate and29. Then the union is0-15 (boys) and16-28,29 (girls). So total distinct numbers0-28 and29, which is30. Wait, 0-28 is29 numbers, plus29 is already included. So actually, 0-29, which is30 numbers. Wait, but girls have16-28 (13 numbers) with one duplicate and29. So the union is0-15 (from boys) and16-28,29 (from girls). Therefore, all numbers0-29 are covered. Because16-28 and29 are included in the girls, and0-15 in the boys. So the union is0-29. Therefore, 30 distinct numbers. But is this possible?Wait, let&#39;s check the sum. If girls have degrees16-28 (13 numbers) with one duplicate and29. Let&#39;s say one girl is29, two girls are16, and one girl each from17-28. Then the sum is29 +16*2 +17+18+...+28. Let&#39;s compute that.Sum of17-28 is(17+28)*12/2=45*6=270. Then add29 and16*2: 270 +29 +32=331. But the boys&#39; sum is315. Doesn&#39;t match.Alternatively, if the girls have degrees16-29, each once. But that requires14 girls. But we have15 girls. So impossible. Alternatively, can we have girls with degrees0-14 and boys with15-29? But boys can&#39;t go beyond15. So boys can have0-15, girls15-29. Wait, but that overlaps at15.Wait, let&#39;s try this. Boys have0-15 (16 distinct degrees) with sum315. Girls have15-29 (15 distinct degrees). The sum of girls&#39; degrees is15+16+...+29=330. Doesn&#39;t match.But if girls have14-28, sum315. Union is0-15 and14-28. Overlap at14-15. So union is0-28. 29 numbers.Alternatively, girls have15-29. Sum330. Boys have0-15. Sum315. Not equal. Not possible.But earlier, if we have girls with16-29 (14 distinct degrees) and one duplicate, sum would depend on which number is duplicated. For example, if we duplicate the highest possible, say two girls have29. Then sum is29*2 +16+17+...+28. Sum from16-28 is(16+28)*13/2=44*13/2=286. So total sum286 +58=344. Which is way higher than315.Alternatively, duplicate a lower number. Let&#39;s say two girls have16. Then sum is16*2 +17+...+29. Sum from17-29 is(17+29)*13/2=46*13/2=299. Total sum299 +32=331. Still higher than315.Alternatively, if we have one girl at29, and the other14 girls have degrees15-28. So sum is29 +15+16+...+28. Sum from15-28 is(15+28)*14/2=43*7=301. Total sum301 +29=330. Still higher than315.Alternatively, decrease some degrees. Let&#39;s have one girl at29, and the rest have degrees15-27. So sum is29 +15+16+...+27. Sum from15-27 is(15+27)*13/2=42*13/2=273. Total sum273 +29=302. Boys&#39; sum is315. Still not matching.Alternatively, this seems too time-consuming. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter way.Wait, earlier configuration where boys have0-15 and girls have14-28 gives a union of0-28 (29 numbers) with sums matching. If we can find a configuration where girls include29 without messing up the sum, then we can have30 distinct numbers. Is that possible?Suppose we have one girl at29, and the other14 girls have degrees such that the total sum is315 -29=286. So the other14 girls need to sum to286. If we can arrange14 girls with degrees0-28 summing to286. To maximize the number of distinct degrees, we can spread their degrees as much as possible. For example, if we have degreesx, x+1,...,x+13, then the sum is14x + (0+1+...+13)=14x +91. Set this equal to286:14x=195→x≈13.928. Not integer. So not possible.Alternatively, use higher degrees. Suppose the girls have degrees from16-29. Wait, but we tried that. Alternatively, use degrees15-28. Sum15-28 is301. 301 +29=330. No.Alternatively, girls have degrees14-27 (14 numbers) plus29. Sum14-27 is(14+27)*14/2=41*7=287. 287 +29=316. Boys&#39; sum315. Close.If we reduce one girl&#39;s degree by1, making it26 instead of27. Sum becomes287 -1 +29=315. So girls&#39; degrees are14-26,28,29. Wait, but14-26 is13 numbers, plus28 and29. That&#39;s15 girls. Wait,14-26 is13 numbers, and28,29 are two more. So total15 girls. But that&#39;s13 +2=15. So each girl has a unique degree. Sum is14+15+...+26 +28 +29. Let&#39;s compute:Sum from14-26: (14+26)*13/2=40*13/2=260.Sum of28 and29:57.Total sum:260 +57=317. Still not 315.Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe another approach is needed.Wait, perhaps the maximum number of distinct numbers is29. Which is achieved by the configuration where boys have0-15 and girls have14-28. Union is0-28 (29 numbers). And sums match at315. So this is feasible.But is there a way to get30? Suppose a girl dances29 times. Then, as before, the other14 girls must sum to286. Let&#39;s see if we can have those14 girls have degrees0-28, summing to286, and including all numbers from0-28 except some. But since they are14 girls, if they have14 distinct degrees, they can cover14 numbers. So if we have one girl at29, and14 girls with distinct degrees from0-28, then the union would be0-29. But the boys have degrees0-15. So the girls can cover16-29. Wait, but girls have degrees from0-28 (14 girls) and29. If the girls&#39; degrees are16-29 (14 girls) and29 (1 girl), but there are15 girls. Wait, 16-29 is14 numbers. So one girl is29, and the other14 have16-28. Wait,16-28 is13 numbers. So one duplicate.So girls have degrees:16-28 (13 distinct) and two girls at29? No, only one girl at29. So one girl at29, and14 girls with degrees16-28. Since16-28 is13 numbers, one degree is duplicated. Hence, the girls&#39; degrees are16-28 (13 numbers) with one duplicated, and29. So union is16-28,29. So combined with boys&#39; degrees0-15, the total union is0-29. But the duplicated degree in16-28 is counted once. So total distinct numbers is30.But sum: girls&#39; sum is29 + sum(16-28) + duplicated degree. Wait, sum(16-28) is(16+28)*13/2=44*13/2=286. So girls&#39; sum is286 +29 +d, where d is the duplicated degree. Wait, no. If the girls have degrees16-28 (13 numbers) each once, and one duplicated degree. So total sum is sum(16-28) + duplicated degree +29. Sum(16-28)=286. So total sum is286 +d +29=315. Therefore,286 +d +29=315→d=0. But duplicated degree is d, which must be one of16-28. But 286 +0 +29=315 implies d=0, which is not in16-28. Contradiction. So impossible.Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Hence, it&#39;s impossible to have girls&#39; degrees sum to315 while having a girl at29. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct numbers is29, achieved by boys having0-15 and girls having14-28, overlapping at14 and15, resulting in union0-28. But let&#39;s verify this configuration again. Boys:0-15, each at least once, with13 extra boys at15. Sum:0+1+...+15 +13*15=120+195=315. Girls:14-28, each once. Sum:14+15+...+28. Let&#39;s compute this sum. From14-28 inclusive, that&#39;s15 numbers. Sum=(14+28)*15/2=42*15/2=315. Perfect. So sums match. Boys have degrees0-15 (16 distinct), girls have degrees14-28 (15 distinct). Overlap at14 and15. Total distinct numbers:16+15-2=29. So the answer is29.But wait, the problem is asking for the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned. So in this case,29. But I need to check if there&#39;s a way to get more. For example, maybe some other configuration where the overlap is less.Suppose boys have degrees0-14 and girls have degrees15-29. Then the union is0-29,30 numbers. But does the sum allow this?Sum of boys:0+1+...+14 +14*14=105 +196=301. Sum of girls:15+16+...+29=330. Doesn&#39;t match.Alternatively, boys have0-14 (15 distinct) and some higher degrees. But boys can&#39;t go above15.Alternatively, boys have0-15 and girls have0-29, but overlapping. But due to the sum constraints, as we saw earlier, it&#39;s not possible to have all30 numbers.Hence, the maximum seems to be29. But let me check literature or similar problems. In bipartite graphs, the maximum number of distinct degrees is limited by the sizes of the partitions and the possible degrees. For boys (29) with max degree15, the maximum distinct degrees is16 (0-15). For girls (15) with max degree29, the maximum distinct degrees is15. To maximize the union, we need to minimize overlap. The minimum overlap ismax(0,16 +15 -30)=1. Wait, the inclusion-exclusion principle. The maximum union is16 +15 - overlap. To maximize union, minimize overlap. The minimum possible overlap ismax(0,16 +15 - (15 +29 +1))? Wait, no. Wait, the possible degrees for boys are0-15, girls are0-29. The total possible degrees are0-29 (30 numbers). The boys can have16 distinct degrees (0-15), girls can have up to30, but limited by their count. Since there are15 girls, they can have at most15 distinct degrees. Therefore, the maximum union is16 +15 - overlap. The minimum overlap ismax(0,16 +15 -30)=1. So theoretically, the maximum possible union is16 +15 -1=30. But is this achievable?But according to our earlier attempt, it&#39;s not possible due to sum constraints. But maybe there is a way. Wait, let&#39;s try.Suppose boys have degrees0-15 (16 distinct) and girls have degrees16-30. But girls can only go up to29. So degrees16-29 (14 numbers). But there are15 girls. So one girl must have a duplicate. So girls can have14 distinct degrees and one duplicate. So the union is0-15 and16-29, which is0-29 (30 numbers). But can the sums match?Sum of boys:0+1+...+15 +13*15=120 +195=315.Sum of girls:16-29 (14 numbers) each once, plus one duplicate. Let&#39;s say duplicated degree is16. Then sum is16*2 +17+...+29. Sum from17-29 is(17+29)*13/2=46*13/2=299. Total sum299 +32=331. Not matching315.If duplicated degree is29, sum is29*2 +16+...+28. Sum16-28 is(16+28)*13/2=44*13/2=286. Total sum286 +58=344. Not315.If duplicated degree is somewhere in the middle. Let&#39;s say duplicated degree is22. Then sum is22*2 +16+17+...+21 +23+...+29. Let&#39;s compute:Sum from16-21: (16+21)*6/2=37*3=111.Sum from23-29: (23+29)*7/2=52*3.5=182.Total sum:111 +182 +44=337. Still not315.This approach isn&#39;t working. Alternatively, maybe the duplicated degree is lower. Let&#39;s duplicate15. But girls can&#39;t have15, since we are trying to have girls from16-29. Wait, no. If girls have16-29 and one duplicate, they can&#39;t include15. So the overlap between boys and girls is zero. Boys have0-15, girls have16-29. But girls can&#39;t have15. So the union is0-29, which is30 numbers. But is this possible?Wait, boys have0-15, sum315. Girls have16-29. To have girls&#39; sum315, with15 girls. Let&#39;s see, the minimal sum for girls is16*15=240, maximum is29*15=435. 315 is within this range. Can we have15 girls with degrees16-29 (each girl can have any degree16-29) summing to315?We need to find15 numbers between16 and29 inclusive that sum to315. The average is315/15=21. So we need to have some girls above21 and some below. Let&#39;s try to construct such a sequence.To have15 numbers averaging21, we can have a symmetric distribution around21. For example, use degrees21-21 (all21s). Sum is21*15=315. So if all girls dance21 times, sum is315. But then girls&#39; degrees are all21, so only one distinct number. So union with boys&#39; degrees0-15 is17 numbers. Not good.Alternatively, use a range of degrees. For example, let&#39;s spread the degrees as much as possible while summing to315. Let&#39;s try to have as many distinct degrees as possible.Start with the minimal distinct degrees. Let&#39;s have degrees16-29. There are14 numbers. To get15 girls, we need to duplicate one degree. Let&#39;s duplicate the average one. If we have degrees16-29 (14 numbers) and duplicate21. Then sum is(16+29)*14/2 +21=315 +21=336. Too high.Alternatively, duplicate a lower degree. Let&#39;s duplicate16. Sum is(16+29)*14/2 +16=315 +16=331. Still too high.Alternatively, subtract some degrees. Let&#39;s take the sum of16-29=315. Wait, sum16-29 is(16+29)*14/2=45*7=315. Exactly! But16-29 is14 numbers. So if we have14 girls with degrees16-29 (each once) and one more girl. But we have15 girls. So we need to add one more girl. Wait, but how? If we have14 girls with degrees16-29 summing to315, adding one more girl would require increasing the sum. But we need the total sum to be315. Contradiction.Wait, this suggests that if we have15 girls, it&#39;s impossible to have degrees16-29 (14 distinct) and sum315. Because14 girls with degrees16-29 sum to315, adding a15th girl would require her to have degree0, which is not allowed (as degrees are16-29). Therefore, it&#39;s impossible.Therefore, the earlier configuration where girls have degrees14-28 and boys have0-15 is the only one that allows the sum to match while having a union of29 distinct numbers. Hence, the answer is29.But let me think once more. Suppose boys have degrees1-16 and girls have1-15. Wait, boys can&#39;t have16, but they can have15. Maybe this is another way. No, similar issues.Alternatively, boys have0-14 and15, girls have0-13 and14-28. Not sure.Wait, no. The key is that in the configuration where boys have0-15 and girls have14-28, the overlapping numbers are14 and15. Thus, the total distinct numbers are29. Since this configuration is achievable with matching sums, and attempting to include29 for girls breaks the sum equality, it seems this is the maximum possible.Therefore, the answer should be29, soboxed{29}。Final Answerboxed{29}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned, we need to consider the degrees of the boys and girls in a bipartite graph where each dance is an edge between a boy and a girl. The goal is to maximize the number of distinct degrees mentioned by both boys and girls while ensuring the sum of the degrees on both sides is equal.1. Boys&#39; Degrees: There are 29 boys, each can dance from 0 to 15 times. To maximize distinct degrees, boys can have degrees 0 to 15 (16 distinct numbers). However, since there are 29 boys, some degrees must be repeated. The sum of the boys&#39; degrees can be calculated as follows:   - The sum of degrees 0 to 15 is ( frac{15 times 16}{2} = 120 ).   - The remaining 13 boys can each have the maximum degree 15, contributing ( 13 times 15 = 195 ).   - Total sum for boys: ( 120 + 195 = 315 ).2. Girls&#39; Degrees: There are 15 girls, each can dance from 0 to 29 times. To maximize distinct degrees without overlapping with boys&#39; degrees as much as possible, girls can have degrees 14 to 28 (15 distinct numbers). The sum of these degrees is:   - The sum of degrees 14 to 28 is ( frac{(14 + 28) times 15}{2} = frac{42 times 15}{2} = 315 ).3. Union of Degrees: The boys&#39; degrees are 0 to 15 (16 distinct numbers), and the girls&#39; degrees are 14 to 28 (15 distinct numbers). The overlapping degrees are 14 and 15. Therefore, the total number of distinct degrees mentioned is:   - Boys&#39; distinct degrees: 16 (0-15)   - Girls&#39; distinct degrees: 15 (14-28)   - Overlap: 2 (14 and 15)   - Total distinct numbers: ( 16 + 15 - 2 = 29 ).Thus, the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned is (boxed{29}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about a ball where 29 boys and 15 girls arrived. They danced in pairs, each pair dancing no more than once. After the ball, each person told their parents how many times they danced. The question is asking for the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned. So, basically, we need to figure out how many distinct dance counts (numbers) can exist among all the children (boys and girls combined) when we maximize that number.First, let me rephrase the problem in my own words to make sure I understand. We have two sets: one with 29 boys and another with 15 girls. Each boy can dance with any number of girls, and each girl can dance with any number of boys, but each pair can only dance once. After dancing, each child (both boys and girls) counts how many partners they had. The goal is to maximize the number of distinct counts. So, we want as many different numbers as possible in the combined list of dance counts from all 44 children.Hmm. So, the key here is that the dance counts for boys and girls must form a bipartite graph where the degrees on each side are as varied as possible. But we need to make sure that the degrees on one side (boys) and the degrees on the other side (girls) are feasible. Because in a bipartite graph, the sum of the degrees on one side must equal the sum of the degrees on the other side. So, the total number of dances that boys participated in must equal the total number of dances that girls participated in.Therefore, when trying to maximize the number of different degrees (numbers mentioned), we need to ensure that the sum of all degrees on the boys&#39; side equals the sum on the girls&#39; side. Also, since each dance is between a boy and a girl, the maximum possible degree for a boy is 15 (since there are 15 girls), and the maximum possible degree for a girl is 29 (since there are 29 boys). But since we want different numbers, we need to assign degrees to the boys and girls such that there&#39;s as much variation as possible, while still keeping the total number of dances consistent.So, let&#39;s think step by step.First, for the boys: there are 29 boys. To maximize the number of different degrees, ideally, we want each boy to have a distinct number of dances. However, since the maximum number of dances a boy can have is 15 (because there are 15 girls), the possible distinct degrees for boys could range from 0 to 15, but that&#39;s 16 different numbers. But we have 29 boys, which is more than 16, so some numbers would have to repeat. Wait, but the problem says &quot;different numbers the children could have mentioned&quot;. So, children include both boys and girls. So, perhaps the boys can have some numbers and the girls can have others, and we need to maximize the total distinct numbers across both groups.Therefore, maybe the boys can have degrees from 0 to 15 (16 numbers), and the girls can have degrees from 0 to 29 (30 numbers). But of course, the sum of the boys&#39; degrees must equal the sum of the girls&#39; degrees. So, if we try to assign as many distinct degrees as possible to both boys and girls, we need to check if the sums can be made equal.But perhaps there&#39;s a limitation here. For example, if boys have degrees 0 to 15, that would require each number from 0 to 15 appearing at least once among the boys. Similarly, girls having degrees 0 to 29 would require each number from 0 to 29 appearing at least once. However, there are only 15 girls, so girls can&#39;t have 30 distinct numbers (0-29). The maximum number of distinct degrees for girls would be 15 (since there are 15 girls), so numbers from 0 to 14, for example, but again, that&#39;s only 15 numbers. But maybe some girls can have higher degrees, but there&#39;s a conflict because the boys can only have up to 15. Wait, a girl can dance with up to 29 boys, but each boy can only dance with up to 15 girls. So, the maximum degree for a girl is 29, but how does that interact with the boys&#39; degrees?Wait, maybe there&#39;s a way to overlap the ranges. Let me think. For example, if some girls dance with many boys, which would require those boys to have danced with multiple girls, but since boys can only dance up to 15 times, but there are 29 boys. So, maybe if a girl dances with 29 boys, but each of those boys can only dance up to 15 times. But if a girl dances with 29 boys, each of those boys must have at least one dance (with her). But then, those boys could also dance with other girls. However, if a girl dances with all 29 boys, but each boy can only dance up to 15 times, then those boys have 14 more dances left with other girls. Hmm, but the other girls would have to dance with those boys as well.But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let&#39;s approach this methodically.We need to assign degrees to boys and girls such that:1. Each boy&#39;s degree is between 0 and 15.2. Each girl&#39;s degree is between 0 and 29.3. The sum of all boys&#39; degrees equals the sum of all girls&#39; degrees.We need to maximize the number of distinct degrees across all boys and girls.So, the maximum number of distinct degrees would be the union of the distinct degrees from boys and girls. To maximize this, we need to maximize the number of distinct degrees on both sides, making sure that their union is as large as possible.But since the boys can have degrees from 0 to 15 and girls from 0 to 29, the union could potentially be 0 to 29, which is 30 numbers. However, there might be overlaps. For example, 0 is common to both. But perhaps we can arrange the degrees so that the boys cover 0 to 15, and the girls cover 16 to 29, which would give us 30 distinct numbers (0-29). But is that possible?Wait, if the girls are to have degrees from 16 to 29, each of those degrees would require a girl to dance with 16 to 29 boys. However, each boy can only dance up to 15 times. So, for a girl to dance with 16 boys, each of those boys would need to have danced at least once (with her). But those boys could also dance with other girls. However, since each boy can dance up to 15 times, but if they dance with one girl, they can dance with 14 others. However, if a girl dances with 16 boys, those 16 boys would need to have at least 1 dance each. If the boys are allowed to dance multiple times (with different girls), then their degrees can be higher.Wait, but if we want girls to have degrees from 16 to 29, each of those girls is dancing with 16 to 29 boys. Each of those boys would have to dance at least once (with that girl), but since there are 29 boys, if a girl dances with 16 boys, that&#39;s 16 boys, but there are 29 in total.But if we have girls with degrees 16 to 29, that would require each of those girls to dance with 16 to 29 boys. However, each boy can only dance up to 15 times. So, if a girl dances with a boy, that counts as one dance for the boy, but the boy can dance up to 14 more times. But if a girl dances with 29 boys, that&#39;s each boy once. But since there are 29 boys, a girl dancing with 29 boys would mean each boy dances with her once, so each boy&#39;s degree is at least 1, but they can dance up to 14 more times. However, if we have another girl who also wants to dance with 29 boys, but the boys can&#39;t dance with her if they already danced 15 times. Wait, this seems conflicting.Alternatively, maybe the girls with high degrees (16-29) would require the boys they dance with to have higher degrees as well. But the boys can only go up to 15. So, for a girl dancing with k boys (where k is between 16 and 29), each of those k boys must have danced at least once (with her). But since the boys can have degrees up to 15, those k boys could have degrees from 1 to 15. However, if a girl dances with 29 boys, then each of those 29 boys has at least 1 dance. If we have multiple girls dancing with subsets of boys, overlapping or not, but each time, the boys&#39; degrees are incremented.But this is getting complex. Let me think of it another way.If we want to have girls with degrees from 16 to 29, that&#39;s 14 distinct numbers (16,17,...,29). But there are only 15 girls. So, maybe 15 girls can have degrees from 15 to 29, which is 15 numbers. Wait, 15 to 29 is 15 numbers (including both 15 and 29). But girls can&#39;t have degree higher than 29, which they can&#39;t anyway because there are 29 boys. Wait, no, a girl can dance with up to 29 boys, so degree 29 is possible.But if we want the girls to have degrees 15 to 29, that&#39;s 15 different numbers, which matches the number of girls. Then, each girl could have a distinct degree from 15 to 29. Then, for the boys, since each dance with a girl corresponds to a dance with a boy, the sum of the girls&#39; degrees (which would be the sum from 15 to 29) must equal the sum of the boys&#39; degrees.Let&#39;s compute the sum of the girls&#39; degrees if they are 15 to 29. The sum is (15 + 29) * 15 / 2 = (44)*15/2 = 22*15 = 330. So, the total number of dances is 330. Therefore, the sum of the boys&#39; degrees must also be 330. There are 29 boys, so the average degree per boy is 330 / 29 ≈ 11.38. Since we can&#39;t have fractions of dances, but individual boys can have integer degrees. However, the key point is whether it&#39;s possible to assign degrees to the boys such that their degrees are all distinct and sum to 330, with each degree between 0 and 15.Wait, but if we want the boys to have as many distinct degrees as possible, they could range from 0 to 15, which is 16 different numbers. However, there are 29 boys, so we need to repeat some degrees. However, if we have some degrees on the boys&#39; side and some on the girls&#39; side, maybe we can maximize the total distinct numbers.Wait, but if girls have degrees from 15 to 29 (15 distinct numbers), and boys have degrees from 0 to 15 (16 distinct numbers), but the boys&#39; degrees must sum to 330. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s possible.The maximum possible sum for boys&#39; degrees is 29*15 = 435. The minimum possible sum is 0. But we need the sum to be 330. So, we need to assign degrees to 29 boys such that the sum is 330, and the degrees are between 0 and 15, inclusive. If we try to use as many distinct degrees as possible for boys, say 0 to 15, but with 29 boys, we need to repeat degrees. The question is, can we arrange the degrees such that the sum is 330?Alternatively, maybe the boys don&#39;t need to have all degrees from 0 to 15. Maybe if we have higher degrees for boys, but constrained by the girls&#39; degrees.Wait, but if the girls have degrees from 15 to 29, each girl must dance with 15 to 29 boys. Each boy can dance up to 15 times, so a boy can be dancing with up to 15 girls. But each girl is dancing with at least 15 boys, so each boy is going to be dancing multiple times. Wait, but if each girl dances with 15 boys, and there are 15 girls, then each boy could be dancing with up to 15 girls. But this might not add up.Wait, let&#39;s think with the girls having degrees from 15 to 29. Let&#39;s suppose each girl has a unique degree from 15 to 29. That would be 15 girls with degrees 15,16,...,29. The total number of dances is sum from 15 to 29, which is 330 as calculated earlier. Therefore, the boys must have a total degree of 330. Each boy can dance up to 15 times.To get the boys&#39; degrees to sum to 330, we need to distribute 330 dances among 29 boys, each dancing between 0 and 15 times. Let&#39;s see what the average would be: 330 / 29 ≈ 11.38. So, on average, each boy dances about 11.38 times.But we need to assign integer values to each boy such that the sum is 330. If we try to maximize the number of distinct degrees among the boys, we would need to use as many different numbers as possible. Since the maximum degree for a boy is 15, and the minimum is 0, the possible distinct degrees are 0-15 (16 numbers). However, with 29 boys, we can&#39;t have all 16 degrees represented only once; we have to repeat some. But if we aim to have as many distinct degrees as possible, perhaps we can cover all 16 degrees (0-15) and then repeat the remaining 13 boys with some degrees. However, the problem is that the sum needs to be 330. If we use 0-15, the sum of these 16 numbers is (15*16)/2 = 120. But we have 29 boys, so we need 29 -16 =13 more boys. If we assign the remaining 13 boys with the highest possible degrees (to reach the total sum of 330), but we need to check if that&#39;s feasible.Wait, let me try to compute this. Suppose we have one boy for each degree from 0 to 15 (16 boys) summing to 120. Then we have 13 more boys. To reach a total sum of 330, the remaining 13 boys need to contribute 330 - 120 = 210. So, each of these 13 boys would need to have, on average, 210 /13 ≈16.15. But wait, the maximum degree a boy can have is 15. So that&#39;s impossible. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work.So, if we try to include 0-15 degrees for boys, we can&#39;t reach the required total sum because the remaining boys would need to exceed the maximum degree. Therefore, this method is invalid. So, maybe we need a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps we can have the boys have degrees from, say, 1 to 15, excluding 0. Then the sum would be higher. Let&#39;s compute. The sum from 1 to 15 is (15*16)/2 = 120. If we have 15 boys with degrees 1-15, sum is 120. Then we have 29 -15=14 boys left. If we assign the remaining 14 boys the maximum degree of 15, their total would be 14*15=210. So, total sum would be 120 +210=330, which matches the required total. Wait, that works!So, if we have 15 boys with degrees 1 to 15 (each distinct), and 14 boys with degree 15, then the total sum is 15*16/2 +14*15 =120 +210=330. Perfect. So, in this case, the boys&#39; degrees are 1,2,...,15 and fourteen 15s. So, the distinct degrees among the boys are 1-15 (15 numbers) and 15 is repeated. So, total distinct degrees for boys:15. But if we include 0, but we didn&#39;t use 0 here. Wait, but in this case, we have all boys dancing at least once. But is that necessary?Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t state that every child must dance; they can have 0 dances. So, perhaps we can have some boys with 0 dances. But in the above scenario, all boys are dancing at least once. However, if we include a 0, then perhaps we can have more distinct degrees, but the sum would decrease, which would conflict with the required total of 330.Wait, let&#39;s check. Suppose we have one boy with 0 dances, and then 16 boys with degrees 1-15 (but there are only 15 numbers here). Wait, 0,1,2,...,15 would be 16 distinct degrees. If we have one boy at 0, 15 boys with degrees 1-15 (each unique), and then the remaining 29 -1 -15=13 boys. Then, the sum would be 0 + sum(1-15) + sum(remaining 13 boys). Sum(1-15)=120, as before. So, total required is 330, so remaining 13 boys need to contribute 330 -0 -120=210. Again, 210/13≈16.15, which is impossible. So, same problem. Hence, including a 0 would require the remaining boys to have even higher degrees, which is impossible.Therefore, it seems that if we want the boys&#39; degrees to sum to 330, we cannot include 0. So, the maximum number of distinct degrees for boys would be 15 (1-15), with 14 boys having the maximum degree 15. Thus, the boys have 15 distinct numbers:1-15.On the girls&#39; side, if we have 15 girls with degrees 15-29, each unique, summing to 330. So, the girls would have degrees 15,16,...,29 (15 distinct numbers). Therefore, the total distinct numbers mentioned by all children would be boys&#39; degrees (1-15) and girls&#39; degrees (15-29). The overlap is 15. So, total distinct numbers would be (1-29) excluding duplicates. Wait, boys have 1-15, girls have 15-29. So, combined, it&#39;s 1-29, with 15 included in both. Therefore, total distinct numbers are 29 (from1-29). But wait, 0 is missing. Wait, in the boys&#39; side, we don&#39;t have 0, and in the girls&#39; side, we don&#39;t have 0 either? Because all girls have degrees from15-29. So, 0 is not included. Therefore, the total distinct numbers would be 1-29, which is 29 numbers. But wait, let&#39;s count. From1-15 (boys) and15-29 (girls). So, 1-14,15,16-29. So, total numbers:14 (1-14) +1 (15) +14 (16-29)=14+1+14=29. So, 29 distinct numbers.But wait, the problem says &quot;different numbers the children could have mentioned&quot;. If 0 is not included, then the maximum is 29. But can we include 0 somehow?If we can have a girl or a boy with 0 dances, then we can include 0. But in the above setup, all girls are dancing between15-29 times, and all boys are dancing between1-15 times. So, no one has 0. Therefore, 0 is not included. If we can adjust the setup to include 0, then the total distinct numbers would be 30 (0-29). But how?Suppose we have one boy who doesn&#39;t dance (0), and adjust the other boys&#39; degrees accordingly. Let&#39;s try.Total required sum for boys:330. If one boy is 0, then the remaining 28 boys need to sum to330. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s the maximum sum for 28 boys with max degree15:28*15=420, which is more than330. So, it&#39;s feasible.But to maximize the number of distinct degrees, we need to have as many distinct degrees as possible among the 28 boys. Let&#39;s try to have 0,1,2,...,15 for the boys (16 numbers). But we have 28 boys. So, one boy is 0, then 15 boys with degrees1-15 (sum=120), and remaining 28-15-1=12 boys. Their degrees need to sum to330 -0 -120=210. So, 210 over12 boys:17.5 per boy on average, which is impossible, since maximum is15. Therefore, again, can&#39;t do this.Alternatively, if we have one boy at0, and then try to spread the remaining 330 across28 boys. If we assign the remaining boys degrees from1 to15, but such that their sum is330. Let&#39;s see, what&#39;s the minimal sum with maximum distinct degrees. If we have degrees1-15, sum is120. Then, remaining 28-15=13 boys would need to sum to330-120=210. Again, same problem as before. So, this approach isn&#39;t feasible.Alternatively, maybe if we don&#39;t use the full1-15 for boys, but instead include some higher numbers? Wait, boys can&#39;t have higher than15. So, no.Alternatively, maybe we can have some girls with0 dances. Wait, but in our previous setup, all girls are dancing15-29 times. If we have a girl with0 dances, then we need to reduce the total sum by the degree she would have had. For example, if we set one girl to0 instead of15, then the total sum becomes330-15=315. Then, the boys&#39; sum must also be315. But the boys can have degrees0-15. So, perhaps this way, the boys can have a lower total sum, allowing for some0s. But this seems messy.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider whether it&#39;s possible to have both0 and29 in the numbers.If we want to have0, then someone must have0 dances, and someone else must have29 dances. For example, a girl dancing29 times (with all29 boys). Then, that girl has degree29. The boys she danced with each have at least1 dance. But then, if we have a boy who danced0 times, he couldn&#39;t have danced with that girl, but the girl danced with all29 boys, so all boys must have danced at least once. Therefore, if a girl dances29 times, all boys must have danced at least once, so no boy can have0. Conversely, if a boy has0 dances, then no girl can have danced with him, so all girls have degrees at most28. Therefore, if we want to have both0 and29 in the numbers, we need:- A girl with29 dances (dancing with all29 boys). Therefore, all boys have at least1 dance.- A boy with0 dances. But this is impossible because the girl with29 dances danced with all29 boys, so all boys have at least1 dance. Contradiction.Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have both0 and29. Similarly, if a girl has29, all boys have at least1. If a boy has0, then all girls have at most28. Therefore,0 and29 cannot coexist.Similarly, if we have a boy with15 dances (the maximum), and a girl with15 dances, that&#39;s okay. But 0 and29 cannot coexist.Therefore, if we want to include0, we have to exclude29. Similarly, if we want to include29, we have to exclude0. Therefore, the maximum range of numbers is either0-28 or1-29. Each has29 numbers. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct numbers is29. But can we actually achieve29?Wait, if we can have numbers from1-29, that&#39;s29 numbers. To do this, we need a girl with29 dances, which requires all29 boys to dance at least1 time. Then, the other girls can have degrees from1-28. However, there are15 girls. So, one girl dances29 times, and the remaining14 girls can have degrees from1-28. But14 girls can&#39;t cover28 numbers. So, maybe not.Alternatively, if we have a girl with29, which uses up all29 boys. Then, the remaining14 girls can dance with subsets of the boys. Each boy has already danced once, so they can dance up to14 more times. So, the maximum degree for a boy would be15 (1+14). Therefore, the boys can have degrees from1-15. If we arrange the boys to have degrees1-15, with some repetitions, and the girls to have degrees1-29, with some repetitions. Wait, but the girls can only be15 in total. So, how can they cover1-29? They can&#39;t. There are only15 girls, so maximum distinct degrees for girls is15. So, even if one girl is29, the remaining14 can have14 distinct degrees, say1-14. Then, the girls would have degrees1-14 and29. So, total distinct degrees for girls:15. For boys, if they have degrees1-15 (15 distinct numbers). So, combined, the distinct numbers would be1-15 (boys) and1-14,29 (girls). So, total distinct numbers:1-15 (15 numbers) +29 (1 number) =16 numbers. Wait, that&#39;s worse than the previous approach where we had29 numbers. So, that&#39;s not good.Alternatively, if we have girls with degrees15-29 (15 numbers) and boys with degrees1-15 (15 numbers). So, combined, it&#39;s1-29, but overlapping at15. So, total distinct numbers:29. But how?Wait, girls have15-29 (15 numbers:15,16,...,29). Boys have1-15 (15 numbers:1,2,...,15). Combined, these give1-29, because15 is included in both. So, total numbers from1-29, which is29 distinct numbers. So, that&#39;s possible.But how is this achieved? As we calculated before, girls with degrees15-29 sum to330, and boys with degrees1-15 (15 boys) and14 boys with15 sum to330. Therefore, boys have degrees1-15 and15, and girls have degrees15-29. Then, the union is1-29. So, 29 distinct numbers. But is0 excluded? Yes, because all boys are dancing at least1 time, and all girls are dancing at least15 times. Therefore, 0 is not included. So, total distinct numbers is29.Alternatively, if we can include0 by having some child not dance, we might get30 numbers. But as we saw earlier, if a girl dances29 times, all boys must dance at least once, so0 can&#39;t be included. Alternatively, if we don&#39;t have a girl dancing29 times, but have a girl dancing0 times, then we can have0, but then the maximum degree for a girl is28. Let&#39;s see.If one girl dances0 times, then the remaining14 girls must account for the total sum. The boys can then have degrees0-15. Let&#39;s attempt this.Total sum required: boys&#39; sum = girls&#39; sum.Girls: one girl with0, and14 girls. Let&#39;s say those14 girls have degrees from16-29 (14 numbers). Wait,16-29 is14 numbers (16,17,...,29). So, the sum would be sum(16-29). Let&#39;s compute that: sum from1-29 minus sum1-15. So, (29*30)/2 - (15*16)/2 =435 -120=315. Therefore, total sum for girls is0 +315=315. Therefore, boys must also sum to315.There are29 boys. If we want to maximize the number of distinct degrees, we can have boys with degrees0-15 (16 numbers). Let&#39;s see:If we have boys with0-15, that&#39;s16 distinct degrees. To cover29 boys, we need13 more boys. Assign those13 boys to the highest possible degree, which is15. Then, the total sum would be sum(0-15) +13*15.Sum(0-15)=120, sum(13*15)=195, total=120+195=315. Perfect. So, total sum is315, which matches the girls&#39; sum.Therefore, in this case, the boys have degrees0-15 (16 numbers) and13 duplicates of15. The girls have degrees0 (1 girl) and16-29 (14 girls). Therefore, the union of degrees is0-15 and16-29. That&#39;s0-29, which is30 distinct numbers.Wait, that&#39;s brilliant! So, by having one girl with0 dances and the other14 girls with16-29, and boys with0-15 (with13 boys repeating15), we get all numbers from0-29, which is30 distinct numbers. But is this possible?Let&#39;s verify.Girls:- 1 girl dances0 times.- 14 girls dance16,17,...,29 times (each distinct).Total sum for girls:0 + sum(16 to29). Sum(16 to29)= sum(1 to29) - sum(1 to15)=435 -120=315. So, total sum for girls is315.Boys:- 16 boys with degrees0,1,2,...,15 (distinct).- 29 -16=13 boys with degree15.Total sum for boys: sum(0-15) +13*15=120 +195=315.So, the sums match. Now, we need to check if such a bipartite graph is possible.For the girls:- The girl with0 dances doesn&#39;t dance with anyone.- The girl who dances29 times needs to dance with all29 boys. However, in this setup, boys have degrees0-15. But the girl dancing29 times must dance with29 boys. Each of those boys must have danced at least once (with her). However, in the boys&#39; degrees, we have some boys with0 degrees. Wait, contradiction! Because the girl who dances29 times must dance with all29 boys, but there&#39;s a boy with0 dances. That&#39;s impossible. Because if a girl dances29 times, she must dance with all29 boys, meaning each boy has at least1 dance. Therefore, we cannot have a boy with0 dances if a girl dances29 times. Therefore, this setup is impossible.Ah, there&#39;s the problem. So, in this case, we have a girl dancing29 times, which requires all boys to have at least1 dance, but we also have a boy with0 dances, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this configuration is invalid.Therefore, we cannot have both0 and29 in the degrees. Therefore, the previous approach where girls have15-29 and boys have1-15 gives us1-29 (29 numbers), but no0. Alternatively, if we try to include0, we have to exclude29, so we get0-28 (29 numbers). But can we do that?Let&#39;s try:Girls:- 1 girl with0 dances.- 14 girls with15-28 dances (14 numbers:15,16,...,28). Sum: sum(15-28)= sum(1-28) - sum(1-14)= (28*29)/2 - (14*15)/2=406 -105=301. Total sum for girls:0 +301=301.Boys need to sum to301. There are29 boys. Let&#39;s try to assign degrees0-14 (15 numbers). Then, 29 -15=14 boys left. Assign them the maximum degree14. Total sum: sum(0-14) +14*14=105 +196=301. Perfect.So, girls have degrees0,15-28 (total15 distinct numbers). Boys have degrees0-14 (15 numbers) and14 boys with14 (so degrees0-14 and14). Therefore, the union of degrees is0-14 (from boys) and15-28 (from girls), plus0 from the girl. So, total distinct numbers0-28, which is29 numbers.Alternatively, if we arrange girls to have0 and15-28 (15 girls), and boys to have0-14 and14 (29 boys). So, boys have0-14, girls have0,15-28. Therefore, combined distinct numbers0-28 (29 numbers). So, this gives us29 distinct numbers.But previously, the other approach gave us1-29 (29 numbers). So, which is better? They both give29 numbers. But the problem says &quot;different numbers the children could have mentioned&quot;. So, whether it&#39;s0-28 or1-29, both have29 numbers. So, the maximum number is29.But wait, can we do better? Is there a way to have30 numbers? If we can have0-29, but as we saw earlier, it&#39;s impossible because having0 and29 requires a contradiction.But maybe if we have some girls with high degrees but not29, and some boys with0.Let me think.Suppose we have:- 1 boy with0 dances.- Some girls with high degrees, but not29.Then, the girls can have degrees from1-28, and the boys can have0-15. If we arrange girls to have degrees from, say,16-30, but wait, girls can&#39;t have more than29. So, degrees16-29 (14 numbers). But there are15 girls. If one girl has0, and the other14 have16-29, that&#39;s15 girls. Then boys have0-15. But as before, the girl with0 would allow a boy with0, but the girls with16-29 would require the boys they dance with to have at least1 dance. However, the boy with0 can&#39;t dance with them. Let&#39;s see.Total sum for girls:0 + sum(16-29)=0 +315=315.Total sum for boys: sum(0-15) +13*15=120 +195=315.But if we have a boy with0 dances, but the girls with16-29 each dance with at least16 boys. For example, the girl with16 dances needs to dance with16 boys. Since there are29 boys, one of whom is0, the other28 have at least1 dance. The girl with16 can dance with16 of the28 boys who have at least1 dance. Similarly, the girl with17 dances can dance with17 boys, etc. However, each time a girl dances with a boy, that boy&#39;s degree increases. But since the boys can have up to15 dances, we need to make sure that no boy exceeds15.But if a boy starts at0, but he can&#39;t dance with any girl. The other28 boys start at1-15. Wait, no. Wait, the total degrees for boys is315. With29 boys, one at0, the rest28 have degrees summing to315. If we try to spread that over28 boys with max15 each.The maximum possible sum for28 boys is28*15=420. We need only315, which is less. So, it&#39;s feasible.But how to arrange the degrees. Let&#39;s try:Boys:- 1 boy:0.- 16 boys:1-15 (distinct degrees). Sum=120.- Remaining28 -1 -16=11 boys. Sum=315 -0 -120=195. Assign these11 boys the maximum degree15. 11*15=165. 195-165=30. So, we need an additional30. So, distribute that as 30 spread over the11 boys. Wait, this might complicate things. Maybe this approach is not straightforward.Alternatively, boys:- 1 boy:0.- Let&#39;s have boys with degrees0,1,2,...,15. That&#39;s16 boys. Sum=0+1+2+...+15=120.- Remaining29-16=13 boys. Need to sum to315-120=195. Assign these13 boys the maximum degree15. 13*15=195. Perfect.Therefore, boys have:- 0,1,2,...,15 (16 distinct degrees).- 13 boys with15.Girls have:- 0,16,17,...,29 (15 distinct degrees:0 and16-29).Therefore, the union of degrees is0,1,2,...,29, except for15. Wait, girls have0,16-29, and boys have0-15. So, combined degrees are0-15 and16-29. The overlap is0. So, total distinct numbers0-29 except15? Wait, no. Girls have0 and16-29, boys have0-15. So, combined, it&#39;s0-15 and16-29. So, 0-15 (16 numbers) and16-29 (14 numbers). Total distinct numbers16+14=30. But wait, 0 is included in both girls and boys? Wait, no. The girls have one girl with0, and the boys have one boy with0. So, 0 is mentioned by both a boy and a girl. But the distinct numbers are still0-15 and16-29, which is0-29. Wait, 0-15 is16 numbers,16-29 is14 numbers. Total numbers:16+14=30. But 0-29 is30 numbers (0,1,2,...,29). Wait, 0-29 inclusive is30 numbers. Yes. So, if we have boys with0-15 and girls with0,16-29, then the combined distinct numbers are0-29. Wait, but how?Wait, boys have0-15 (including0) and girls have0 and16-29. So, the distinct numbers mentioned are0-15 and16-29. That&#39;s0-29 except for15 overlapping? Wait, no. Boys have0-15, girls have0 and16-29. So, combining them, we have0-15 and16-29. So, 0-29 except that15 is included in boys, and16-29 in girls. So, it&#39;s0-29. Therefore,30 distinct numbers. But how is this possible?Wait, boys have0-15. Girls have0 and16-29. Therefore:- 0 is mentioned by a boy and a girl.-1-15 mentioned by boys.-16-29 mentioned by girls.Therefore, all numbers0-29 are covered. Therefore,30 distinct numbers. But is this configuration possible?But earlier, we saw a problem: the girl who is supposed to dance16 times needs to dance with16 boys. However, there&#39;s a boy with0 dances. If the girl dances with16 boys, those boys must have at least1 dance. However, the boy with0 dances is not among them. But the other28 boys can be the ones she dances with. Since there are29 boys total, one has0, the other28 have1-15. So, the girl dancing16 times can dance with16 of the28 boys who have non-zero degrees. Similarly, the girl dancing17 times can dance with17 of those28 boys. And so on up to the girl dancing29 times, but wait, in this setup, the girls have degrees up to29. But there are only28 non-zero boys. Therefore, a girl cannot dance29 times because there are only28 boys available (excluding the0 one). So, this is a problem.Specifically, in this configuration:- Girls have degrees0,16-29.- Boys have degrees0,1-15, and13 boys with15.But there are29 boys:1 with0,1-15 (15 boys), and13 with15. Total1+15+13=29.The total sum of boys&#39; degrees:0 + sum(1-15) +13*15=0 +120 +195=315.Girls&#39; total sum:0 + sum(16-29)=0 +315=315.But the girl who is supposed to dance29 times needs to dance with29 boys, but there&#39;s a boy with0 dances, so only28 boys are available. Therefore, she can&#39;t dance29 times. Contradiction. Therefore, the girl cannot have29 dances. Therefore, the maximum degree a girl can have is28. Therefore, our earlier calculation is invalid.Therefore, the girls cannot have degrees up to29 if there&#39;s a boy with0. Hence, the maximum degree a girl can have is28. Therefore, the girls would have degrees0,16-28. That&#39;s14 girls: one0 and13 with16-28. But there are15 girls. So, maybe one more degree. Wait, 16-28 is13 numbers. So, with one girl at0 and13 girls at16-28, that&#39;s14 girls. We need15 girls. Therefore, we need one more girl. So, perhaps degrees0,15-28. But then15 is already covered by the boys. Let&#39;s see.Wait, girls:- 1 girl:0- 14 girls:15-28. But15-28 is14 numbers. So, girls have0,15-28 (15 girls).Sum for girls:0 + sum(15-28). Sum(15-28)= sum(1-28) - sum(1-14)= (28*29)/2 - (14*15)/2=406 -105=301. So total sum301.Boys need to sum to301. There are29 boys. Assign degrees0-14 and15. Let&#39;s try:- Boys:0,1-14 (15 degrees), and14 boys with15.Sum:0 + sum(1-14) +14*15=0 +105 +210=315. Not 301. Doesn&#39;t match.Alternatively:- Boys:0,1-13 (14 degrees), and15 boys with14.Sum:0 + sum(1-13) +15*14=0 +91 +210=301. Perfect.So, boys:- 1 boy:0- 13 boys:1-13 (each distinct)- 15 boys:14Total boys:1+13+15=29.Sum:0 + sum(1-13)=91 +15*14=210 → Total301.Girls:- 1 girl:0- 14 girls:15-28 (each distinct)Sum:0 + sum(15-28)=0 +301=301.Therefore, this works. Now, the distinct numbers mentioned are:Boys:0,1-13,14.Girls:0,15-28.Combined, the distinct numbers are0-28. That&#39;s29 numbers.Therefore, in this configuration, we have29 distinct numbers.But previously, we had another configuration where girls had15-29 and boys had1-15, giving1-29 (29 numbers). So, both configurations give29 distinct numbers.Is there a way to get30? If we can&#39;t have0 and29, but can we have0-28 and29 in separate configurations? For example, have some girls with29, but no0, and others with0 but no29. But that would require different configurations, but in a single setup, we can&#39;t have both.Alternatively, perhaps not using contiguous ranges. For example, boys have0-14 and girls have15-29, but some numbers overlapping or missing. But that might not increase the total count.Wait, if boys have0-14 and girls have15-29, combined that&#39;s0-29, but if there&#39;s no overlap. But there is no overlap between0-14 and15-29. But boys can&#39;t have15-29. So, if girls have15-29 and boys have0-14, combined it&#39;s0-29. That&#39;s30 numbers. But is this possible?Wait, if girls have15-29 and boys have0-14. Total sum for girls: sum(15-29)=330. Total sum for boys: sum(0-14)=105. But 330≠105. Therefore, not possible.Alternatively, if girls have15-28 and boys have0-14. Total sum for girls: sum(15-28)=301. Boys sum0-14=105. Doesn&#39;t match. Not possible.Therefore, to have girls and boys with non-overlapping ranges, the sums don&#39;t match. Therefore, we need some overlap.The previous working configurations either have:1. Girls15-29 and boys1-15 with overlap at15, total distinct1-29 (29 numbers).2. Girls0,15-28 and boys0-14,14 with overlap at0 and15-14, giving0-28 (29 numbers).Therefore, both give29 numbers. So, the maximum is29.But wait, there&#39;s another way. Suppose we have girls with degrees1-15 and boys with1-29. But girls can only have up to29 dances, but there are15 girls. Wait, boys can only have up to15 dances. So, boys can&#39;t have degrees beyond15. So, impossible.Alternatively, girls have1-29 and boys1-15. But girls can&#39;t have29 distinct degrees because there are only15 girls. So, maximum girls can have15 distinct degrees. If we have girls with1-15 and boys with1-29, but boys can&#39;t go beyond15. So, impossible.Therefore, it seems that the maximum number of distinct numbers is29.But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another possible configuration.Suppose we have some girls with high degrees and some with low, and boys spread out.For example, let’s say we have:- Some girls with high degrees (say15-29) and some with low degrees (0-14).- Boys have degrees that fill in the gaps.But we need to ensure the sum of degrees on both sides match.But this might not necessarily increase the total distinct numbers beyond29.Alternatively, suppose we have girls with degrees0,1,...,14 and boys with15-29. But girls have15 girls, so they can have0-14 (15 numbers). Boys have29 boys. To have degrees15-29 (15 numbers), but with29 boys, need to repeat. The sum would be girls: sum(0-14)=105. Boys: sum(15-29)*k, but there are29 boys. To get the sum to105, but boys can&#39;t have degrees lower than15. So, impossible.Therefore, this approach is invalid.Therefore, after considering various configurations, the maximum number of distinct numbers is29, achieved either by:- Girls having degrees15-29 and boys1-15, with overlap at15, total distinct1-29.- Girls having degrees0,15-28 and boys0-14,14, with overlap at0 and15-14, total distinct0-28.Both configurations result in29 distinct numbers.But wait, in the first configuration, girls have15-29 (15 numbers), boys have1-15 (15 numbers). Combined, they have1-29, which is29 numbers. Similarly, in the second configuration, girls have0,15-28 (15 numbers), boys have0-14 (15 numbers). Combined,0-28 (29 numbers). So, both give29.Therefore, the answer should be29.But let me check one more thing. If we have boys from1-15 and girls from15-29, overlapping at15. So, the total distinct numbers are1-29. But can we actually have a girl with15 dances and a boy with15 dances?Yes. For example, a girl dances15 times with15 different boys. Each of those boys dances with her once. They can also dance with other girls. Since the boys can dance up to15 times, they can dance with other girls. Similarly, the girl with15 dances can dance with15 boys, each of whom can dance up to15 times. So, this is possible.Similarly, the configuration with girls0,15-28 and boys0-14,14. The girl with0 dances doesn&#39;t dance with anyone. The boys with0 dance also don&#39;t dance. The other girls have15-28 dances. Each of those girls dances with boys who have at least1 dance. The boys with degrees1-14 and14 can accommodate the girls&#39; dances. The sum checks out, so it&#39;s possible.Therefore, both configurations are valid, and each gives29 distinct numbers. Since the problem asks for the maximum number of different numbers, the answer is29.Final Answerboxed{29}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of different dance counts mentioned by the children, we need to consider the degrees of the boys and girls in a bipartite graph where each dance is an edge between a boy and a girl. The key is to maximize the number of distinct degrees while ensuring the sum of the degrees on both sides (boys and girls) are equal.1. Girls&#39; Degrees:    - If we assign degrees from 15 to 29 to the 15 girls, each girl will have a unique degree. The sum of these degrees is:     [     sum_{i=15}^{29} i = frac{(15 + 29) times 15}{2} = 330     ]   - This sum must equal the sum of the boys&#39; degrees.2. Boys&#39; Degrees:   - To match the sum of 330, we need to assign degrees to 29 boys. The degrees can range from 1 to 15.    - We can have 15 boys with distinct degrees from 1 to 15, and the remaining 14 boys with the maximum degree of 15. The sum of these degrees is:     [     sum_{i=1}^{15} i + 14 times 15 = 120 + 210 = 330     ]   - This results in boys having degrees 1 to 15 (15 distinct numbers) and 14 boys with degree 15.3. Combined Distinct Numbers:   - The girls&#39; degrees range from 15 to 29 (15 distinct numbers).   - The boys&#39; degrees range from 1 to 15 (15 distinct numbers).   - The overlapping degree is 15, so the combined distinct numbers are 1 to 29, resulting in 29 distinct numbers.4. Verification:   - Another configuration where girls have degrees 0, 15-28 and boys have degrees 0-14, 14 also results in 29 distinct numbers (0-28), but this configuration overlaps at 0 and 15-14, resulting in 29 distinct numbers as well.Thus, the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned is (boxed{29}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-516ba452></div><p class="review-content" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>🔑:</span>Answer: 29.Solution. The largest possible number that could have been named is 29 (in the case where there is a girl who danced with all the boys), and the smallest is 0. Thus, we have that the number of different numbers named is no more than 30.We will prove that it cannot be exactly 30. Suppose the opposite, that all numbers from 0 to 29 were named. Then the numbers from 16 to 29 were named only by girls (this is already 14 numbers). The number 0 was definitely not named by a boy, since there is a girl who danced with all the boys. This means that the girls must have named exactly fifteen numbers: 0, 16, 17, 18, ..., 29.At the same time, the number 15 was not named by any of the girls, since it is already known which numbers they named. If the number 15 was named by a boy, it would mean that he danced with all the girls. But there is a girl who named the number 0, who did not dance with anyone. Contradiction.Now we will show how 29 different numbers could have been named. Let&#39;s number the girls from 1 to 15 and the boys from 1 to 29. Let boy i dance with girl j if and only if i geqslant j.We can illustrate this example with a 15 times 29 table: we will assign a column of the table to each boy and a row to each girl; if a boy danced with a girl, we will color the cell at the intersection of the corresponding row and column. In Fig. 4, above each column is written how many cells are colored in it; to the left of each row is written how many cells are colored in it.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_6da73bfd3e09e8b55e3fg-36.jpg?height=448&amp;width=779&amp;top_left_y=1112&amp;top_left_x=337)Fig. 4: example for the solution to problem 9.6</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-f1f3de79 data-v-516ba452><div class="review" data-v-516ba452><div class="review-title" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>❓:</span>XLVI OM - I - Zadanie 1Wyznaczyć wszystkie pary  (x,y)  liczb naturalnych, dla których liczby  frac{x+1}{y}  oraz  frac{y+1}{x}  są naturalne.</div><div class="divider" data-v-516ba452></div><p class="review-content" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find all pairs of natural numbers (x, y) such that both (x + 1)/y and (y + 1)/x are natural numbers. Hmm, natural numbers here mean positive integers, right? So x and y are positive integers, and when we divide x + 1 by y, we get another positive integer, same with (y + 1)/x. Let me think about how to approach this.First, since both (x + 1)/y and (y + 1)/x must be integers, that means y divides x + 1 and x divides y + 1. So mathematically, y | x + 1 and x | y + 1. Which also implies that there are integers k and m such that x + 1 = k * y and y + 1 = m * x. So maybe I can set up these equations and solve for x and y in terms of k and m.Let me write down the equations:1. x + 1 = k * y2. y + 1 = m * xSince x and y are natural numbers, k and m must also be positive integers. Now, I can substitute one equation into the other to eliminate a variable. For example, from equation 1, x = k * y - 1. Then substitute this into equation 2:y + 1 = m * (k * y - 1)Let me expand that:y + 1 = m * k * y - mNow, let&#39;s bring all terms to one side:y + 1 + m = m * k * yThen, rearrange terms:m * k * y - y = m + 1Factor out y:y * (m * k - 1) = m + 1Therefore, solving for y:y = (m + 1) / (m * k - 1)Since y must be a natural number, the denominator (m * k - 1) must divide (m + 1) exactly. Also, m * k - 1 must be a positive integer, so m * k - 1 &gt; 0 =&gt; m * k &gt; 1. Since m and k are positive integers, the smallest possible values for m and k are 1, but if m = 1 and k = 1, then m * k = 1, which would make the denominator 0. So m and k can&#39;t both be 1. Therefore, at least one of m or k must be greater than 1.Similarly, since x is also a natural number, x = k * y - 1 must be positive. So k * y - 1 ≥ 1 =&gt; k * y ≥ 2. Since y is at least 1, k must be at least 2 if y = 1, but if y is larger, k could be 1. So there&#39;s some interplay here between k and y.Alternatively, maybe I can substitute the other way. Let&#39;s try substituting equation 2 into equation 1. From equation 2, y = m * x - 1. Substitute into equation 1:x + 1 = k * (m * x - 1)Expanding:x + 1 = k * m * x - kBring all terms to one side:x + 1 + k = k * m * xRearranged:k * m * x - x = k + 1Factor out x:x * (k * m - 1) = k + 1Therefore, x = (k + 1)/(k * m - 1)Again, similar structure. So both x and y can be expressed in terms of k and m, with the denominators needing to divide the numerators.So for both x and y to be natural numbers, (m + 1) must be divisible by (m * k - 1) and (k + 1) must be divisible by (k * m - 1). Wait, actually, in the first substitution, we have y = (m + 1)/(m * k - 1), and in the second substitution, x = (k + 1)/(k * m - 1). But since k and m are positive integers, and denominators must divide numerators, we need to find all pairs (k, m) such that m * k - 1 divides both m + 1 and k + 1. Wait, that seems complicated, but maybe there&#39;s some symmetry here.Alternatively, perhaps instead of dealing with both variables at once, I can look for small values of x and y and see if a pattern emerges. Let&#39;s try some small natural numbers.Start with x = 1:If x = 1, then from the second equation, (y + 1)/1 must be natural, which it is for any y. But from the first equation, (1 + 1)/y = 2/y must be natural, so y must divide 2. Thus, possible y values are 1 and 2.So if x = 1, possible y = 1 or 2.Check y = 1: Then (1 + 1)/1 = 2 (natural), and (1 + 1)/1 = 2 (natural). So (1,1) is a solution? Wait, (y + 1)/x = (1 + 1)/1 = 2, which is natural. So (1,1) is a solution.Check y = 2: (1 + 1)/2 = 1 (natural), and (2 + 1)/1 = 3 (natural). So (1,2) is also a solution. Wait, but according to the problem statement, both (x + 1)/y and (y + 1)/x must be natural. For x=1 and y=2, (1+1)/2 = 1 is natural, and (2+1)/1=3 is natural. So yes, (1,2) is a solution.Okay, so x=1 gives two solutions: (1,1) and (1,2).Now check x=2:If x=2, then (2 + 1)/y must be natural, so y divides 3. Therefore, y=1, 3.First, y=1: (2 + 1)/1 = 3 (natural), and (1 + 1)/2 = 1 (natural). So (2,1) is a solution.y=3: (2 + 1)/3 = 1 (natural), and (3 + 1)/2 = 2 (natural). So (2,3) is a solution.Thus, x=2 gives two solutions: (2,1) and (2,3).Next, x=3:(y + 1)/3 must be natural, so y + 1 must be divisible by 3. Therefore, y = 3k - 1, where k is a positive integer. So possible y values are 2, 5, 8, etc. But also, (3 + 1)/y must be natural, so y divides 4. Thus, possible y is 1, 2, 4.But y must satisfy both conditions: y divides 4 and y is of the form 3k - 1. So y can be 2 (since 2 divides 4 and 2=3*1 -1). y=2 is a possible candidate.Check y=2:(3 + 1)/2 = 2 (natural), and (2 + 1)/3 = 1 (natural). So (3,2) is a solution.y=1: Check (3 + 1)/1 =4 (natural), but (1 + 1)/3 ≈ 0.666, not natural. So y=1 is invalid.y=4: Check if 4 is of the form 3k -1. 3k -1=4 =&gt; 3k=5 =&gt; k=5/3, not integer. So y=4 is not of the form 3k -1, so it&#39;s excluded.Thus, only y=2 is valid, so (3,2) is a solution.Moving to x=4:First, (4 + 1)/y must be natural, so y divides 5. Possible y=1,5.Also, (y + 1)/4 must be natural, so y + 1 must be divisible by 4. Thus, y=3,7,11,... but y must also divide 5. The common possibilities are y=1 and y=5.Check y=1: (4 +1)/1=5 (natural), (1 +1)/4=0.5 (not natural). Invalid.Check y=5: (4 +1)/5=1 (natural), (5 +1)/4=1.5 (not natural). So y=5 is invalid.Thus, x=4 gives no solutions.x=5:Similarly, (5 +1)/y must be natural, so y divides 6. Possible y=1,2,3,6.Also, (y +1)/5 must be natural, so y +1 must be divisible by 5. So y=4,9,14,... but y must divide 6. The common possibilities are y=4 (but 4 doesn&#39;t divide 6) or none. Wait, y has to be a divisor of 6 and also y ≡4 mod 5. Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. Let&#39;s check:y=1: (1 +1)/5 = 0.4 (invalid)y=2: (2 +1)/5 = 0.6 (invalid)y=3: (3 +1)/5 = 0.8 (invalid)y=6: (6 +1)/5 = 1.4 (invalid)So none of these y satisfy both conditions. Therefore, x=5 has no solutions.x=6:(6 +1)/y must be natural =&gt; y divides 7. So y=1,7.Also, (y +1)/6 must be natural =&gt; y +1 divisible by 6. Thus, y=5,11,17,... but y must be 1 or 7.Check y=1: (1 +1)/6 ≈ 0.333 (invalid)y=7: (7 +1)/6 ≈ 1.333 (invalid)Thus, no solutions for x=6.x=3: Already checked, gives (3,2).x=4,5,6: No solutions. Let&#39;s try x=7.x=7:(7 +1)/y must be natural =&gt; y divides 8. So y=1,2,4,8.Also, (y +1)/7 must be natural =&gt; y +1 divisible by 7. So y=6,13,20,... but y must divide 8. Check possible y:y=1: (1+1)/7 ≈0.285 (invalid)y=2: (2+1)/7≈0.428 (invalid)y=4: (4+1)/7≈0.714 (invalid)y=8: (8+1)/7≈1.285 (invalid)No solutions for x=7.x=8:(8 +1)/y divides 9. So y=1,3,9.Also, (y +1)/8 must be natural. So y +1 divisible by 8. Thus, y=7,15,23,... but y must be 1,3,9.Check y=1: (1+1)/8=0.25 (invalid)y=3: (3+1)/8=0.5 (invalid)y=9: (9+1)/8=1.25 (invalid)No solutions for x=8.Hmm, it seems like after x=3, there are no solutions up to x=8. Let&#39;s check x=9:x=9:(9 +1)/y=10/y must be natural =&gt; y divides 10. y=1,2,5,10.Also, (y +1)/9 must be natural =&gt; y +1 divisible by 9. So y=8,17,26,... but y must be 1,2,5,10.Check y=8: Not in divisors of 10. So no solutions.Wait, check y=1: (1+1)/9≈0.222 (invalid)y=2: (2+1)/9≈0.333 (invalid)y=5: (5+1)/9≈0.666 (invalid)y=10: (10+1)/9≈1.222 (invalid)No solutions for x=9.x=10:(10 +1)/y=11/y. y divides 11. So y=1,11.Also, (y +1)/10 must be natural. So y +1 divisible by 10 =&gt; y=9,19,29,... but y must be 1 or 11.Check y=1: (1+1)/10=0.2 (invalid)y=11: (11+1)/10=1.2 (invalid)No solutions.So up to x=10, the solutions we have are:(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).Wait, let&#39;s check x=3 and y=2:(3 +1)/2=2 (natural), (2 +1)/3=1 (natural). Yep, that works.Similarly, (2,3):(2 +1)/3=1 (natural), (3 +1)/2=2 (natural). Also works.(2,1):(2 +1)/1=3 (natural), (1 +1)/2=1 (natural). Correct.(1,1):(1 +1)/1=2, (1 +1)/1=2. Correct.(1,2):(1 +1)/2=1, (2 +1)/1=3. Correct.So far, these are the solutions. Let me check if there are more solutions with higher x and y. Maybe there&#39;s a symmetry here. For example, if (x, y) is a solution, then maybe (y, x) is also a solution? Let&#39;s see.From our solutions:(1,1) is symmetric.(1,2) and (2,1) are symmetric.(2,3) and (3,2) are symmetric.So perhaps the solutions come in such pairs. Let&#39;s check if there are any more beyond that.Wait, maybe x and y are related through the equations:From x + 1 = k * y and y + 1 = m * x, substituting each other.For example, if we take x and y such that x divides y + 1 and y divides x + 1.Suppose we have x ≤ y. Let&#39;s see if this assumption helps.If x ≤ y, then since y divides x + 1, and x + 1 ≤ y + 1, because x ≤ y. So y divides x + 1, which is less than or equal to y +1. So possible cases:Either x + 1 = y, or x +1 = something smaller.Wait, if x ≤ y, then y divides x +1. Since x +1 ≤ y +1, the possible divisors of x +1 would be 1, 2,..., x +1. But since y ≥ x, the only possibilities are y = x +1 or y divides x +1 and y = x +1.Wait, not necessarily. For example, if x=1, y can be 2 (which is x +1) or 1 (divides 2). But in the case x=1, y=1 is allowed.Wait, maybe considering x ≤ y and x divides y +1. Let me see.Case 1: x = y.If x = y, then (x +1)/x must be an integer. So x divides x +1. Which implies x divides 1. Therefore, x = 1. So (1,1) is the only solution where x = y.Case 2: x &lt; y.If x &lt; y, then since y divides x +1, and y &gt; x, then y must be equal to x +1. Because if y divides x +1 and y &gt; x, the only divisor of x +1 greater than x is x +1 itself. So y = x +1.But then, substituting y = x +1 into the second condition: x divides (y +1) = (x +1) +1 = x + 2. So x divides x + 2. Therefore, x divides 2. Thus, x can be 1 or 2.If x=1, then y=2. Check the original conditions: (1 +1)/2=1, (2 +1)/1=3. Both natural. So (1,2) is a solution.If x=2, then y=3. (2 +1)/3=1, (3 +1)/2=2. Both natural. So (2,3) is a solution.So in the case where x &lt; y, the solutions are (1,2) and (2,3).Case 3: x &gt; y.Similarly, if x &gt; y, then since x divides y +1, and x &gt; y, x must be equal to y +1. Because x divides y +1 and x &gt; y, so the only divisor of y +1 greater than y is y +1 itself. So x = y +1.Substituting into the first condition: y divides (x +1) = (y +1) +1 = y +2. Therefore, y divides y +2, so y divides 2. Therefore, y can be 1 or 2.If y=1, then x=2. Check conditions: (2 +1)/1=3, (1 +1)/2=1. Both natural. So (2,1) is a solution.If y=2, then x=3. (3 +1)/2=2, (2 +1)/3=1. Both natural. So (3,2) is a solution.So in the case where x &gt; y, the solutions are (2,1) and (3,2).Therefore, combining all cases, the solutions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). But wait, according to this analysis, that&#39;s all. Let me confirm if these are all.But when we checked x=3, y=2, that&#39;s covered. Are there any other solutions outside these?Suppose we assume that x and y are both greater than 3. Let&#39;s see if such a solution exists.Suppose x ≥4 and y ≥4. Let&#39;s see if such a pair is possible.Let’s assume x ≥4 and y ≥4.From the first equation, x +1 must be divisible by y. Since y ≥4 and x ≥4, x +1 ≥5, but y divides x +1, so y ≤x +1. Similarly, from the second equation, y +1 must be divisible by x. Since x ≥4, y +1 ≥5, and x divides y +1, so x ≤ y +1.So we have:y divides x +1 =&gt; y ≤ x +1x divides y +1 =&gt; x ≤ y +1So both x and y are within 1 of each other? Not necessarily, but they can&#39;t be too far apart.Let me suppose that x and y satisfy both y ≤ x +1 and x ≤ y +1. This implies that |x - y| ≤1. So either x = y, x = y +1, or y = x +1.But we already considered these cases. When x = y, we get x = y =1. When x = y +1 or y = x +1, we get the solutions (2,1), (1,2), (3,2), (2,3).So if |x - y| ≤1, then the only possible solutions are those we already found. However, if |x - y| &gt;1, then the conditions y divides x +1 and x divides y +1 can&#39;t both hold, because y would be larger than x +1 or vice versa. Hence, such pairs can&#39;t exist.Therefore, there are no solutions with |x - y| &gt;1, which would require x and y both being greater than or equal to 4. So all solutions are indeed the ones found earlier: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).Wait, but let me check if (2,3) and (3,2) are actually different solutions. Yes, since order matters here. So all these pairs are distinct.But wait, let me check another way. Let&#39;s use the equations:x +1 = k * yy +1 = m * xWe can substitute x from the first equation into the second equation:y +1 = m * (k * y -1)Which gives:y +1 = m*k*y - mRearranged:m*k*y - y = m +1y*(m*k -1) = m +1So y = (m +1)/(m*k -1)Similarly, x = (k +1)/(m*k -1)But since x and y are positive integers, the denominator m*k -1 must divide both m +1 and k +1.Therefore, m*k -1 divides m +1 and m*k -1 divides k +1.Let me denote d = m*k -1. Then d divides m +1 and d divides k +1. Therefore, d divides (m +1) and (k +1). So d divides their linear combinations.Compute (m +1) - k*(k +1) ?Wait, perhaps not the best approach. Alternatively, since d divides both m +1 and k +1, d must divide their greatest common divisor. Let’s compute gcd(m +1, k +1). But since d = m*k -1, which is equal to (m*k -1). Hmm, this might be a bit tricky.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider possible small values of k and m.Case when k=1:Then from the first equation, x +1 = y. Then substitute into the second equation:y +1 = m*x =&gt; (x +1) +1 = m*x =&gt; x +2 = m*x =&gt; 2 = (m -1)*x.Since x is a natural number, (m -1) must divide 2. So m -1 can be 1 or 2, leading to m=2 or m=3.If m=2: Then 2 = (2 -1)*x =&gt; x=2. Then y = x +1 =3. So pair (2,3).If m=3: Then 2 = (3 -1)*x =&gt; x=1. Then y= x +1=2. So pair (1,2).Case when m=1:From the second equation, y +1 = x. Substitute into the first equation:x +1 =k*y =&gt; (y +1) +1 =k*y =&gt; y +2 =k*y =&gt; 2 = (k -1)*y.Thus, (k -1) divides 2. So k -1=1 or 2, leading to k=2 or 3.If k=2: 2 =1*y =&gt; y=2. Then x= y +1=3. Pair (3,2).If k=3: 2 =2*y =&gt; y=1. Then x=1 +1=2. Pair (2,1).Case when k=2:From first equation: x +1 =2y. From second equation: y +1 =m*x.Express x=2y -1. Substitute into second equation:y +1 =m*(2y -1)Expand:y +1 =2m*y -mBring terms with y to one side:2m*y - y = m +1y*(2m -1)=m +1Thus, y=(m +1)/(2m -1). Since y is natural, denominator 2m -1 must divide numerator m +1. So 2m -1 divides m +1.Let’s compute 2m -1 | m +1.Let’s write m +1 = q*(2m -1) for some integer q.Then m +1 = 2q*m - qBring terms with m to left:m -2q*m = -q -1m*(1 -2q) = - (q +1)Multiply both sides by -1:m*(2q -1) = q +1Thus, m = (q +1)/(2q -1)Since m must be a positive integer, denominator 2q -1 must divide q +1, and 2q -1 &gt;0 =&gt; q ≥1.Let’s check possible q values:q=1: m=(1 +1)/(2*1 -1)=2/1=2. So m=2.Then y=(m +1)/(2m -1)=(2 +1)/(4 -1)=3/3=1. So y=1. Then x=2y -1=2*1 -1=1. So pair (1,1). Let&#39;s check:(x +1)/y=(1 +1)/1=2 (natural), (y +1)/x=(1 +1)/1=2 (natural). So (1,1) is a solution.q=2: m=(2 +1)/(4 -1)=3/3=1. So m=1. Then y=(1 +1)/(2*1 -1)=2/1=2. Then x=2*2 -1=3. Pair (3,2). Already found.q=3: m=(3 +1)/(6 -1)=4/5. Not integer. So invalid.q≥3: denominator 2q -1 &gt; numerator q +1, so no integer solutions. Hence, q=1 and q=2 are the only possibilities, leading to m=2 and m=1. So (1,1) and (3,2) are solutions here.Similarly, for m=2 and k=2.Case when k=3:From first equation: x +1=3y. From second equation: y +1=m*x.Express x=3y -1. Substitute into second equation:y +1 =m*(3y -1)Expand:y +1=3m*y -mBring terms with y to left:3m*y - y = m +1y*(3m -1)=m +1Thus, y=(m +1)/(3m -1). Need 3m -1 divides m +1.Similarly, set m +1 = q*(3m -1)Then m +1=3q*m - qRearranged:3q*m -m = q +1m*(3q -1)=q +1So m=(q +1)/(3q -1)Since m must be a positive integer, denominator 3q -1 must divide q +1, and 3q -1 &gt;0 =&gt; q ≥1.Check q=1: m=(1 +1)/(3 -1)=2/2=1. Then y=(1 +1)/(3*1 -1)=2/2=1. Then x=3*1 -1=2. Pair (2,1). Check:(2 +1)/1=3, (1 +1)/2=1. Correct.q=2: m=(2 +1)/(6 -1)=3/5. Not integer.q≥2: Denominator 3q -1 exceeds numerator q +1, so no integer solutions. Hence, only q=1 gives m=1, leading to pair (2,1).Similarly, other k and m values can be checked, but likely they result in no new solutions.Therefore, compiling all solutions from the different cases, we have:(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). These are all possible pairs.Let me just confirm that there are no other solutions. For example, if we set k=4:From x +1=4y, so x=4y -1. Substitute into y +1=m*x:y +1=m*(4y -1)=&gt; y +1=4m y -m=&gt; 4m y - y = m +1=&gt; y*(4m -1) = m +1=&gt; y=(m +1)/(4m -1)Need 4m -1 divides m +1. Let’s see if this is possible.Set m +1 = q*(4m -1)Then m +1=4q m - q=&gt; 4q m -m = q +1=&gt; m*(4q -1)=q +1=&gt; m=(q +1)/(4q -1)Check q=1: m=2/3, not integer.q=2: m=3/7, nope.q=3: m=4/11, nope. So no solutions here.Thus, no solutions for k=4.Similarly, higher k values won&#39;t work as denominators would only get larger.Therefore, the complete list of solutions is the five pairs mentioned above. To make sure, let&#39;s check each of them:(1,1):(1 +1)/1=2, (1 +1)/1=2. Both natural. Correct.(1,2):(1 +1)/2=1, (2 +1)/1=3. Correct.(2,1):(2 +1)/1=3, (1 +1)/2=1. Correct.(2,3):(2 +1)/3=1, (3 +1)/2=2. Correct.(3,2):(3 +1)/2=2, (2 +1)/3=1. Correct.All of these check out. Since we have exhausted all possibilities by considering the cases where x = y, x = y +1, y = x +1, and using substitutions leading to the equations, and found no other solutions, these must be the only ones.Final AnswerThe natural number pairs are boxed{(1, 1)}, boxed{(1, 2)}, boxed{(2, 1)}, boxed{(2, 3)}, and boxed{(3, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find all pairs ((x, y)) of natural numbers such that both (frac{x+1}{y}) and (frac{y+1}{x}) are natural numbers, we start by noting that (y) must divide (x + 1) and (x) must divide (y + 1). This leads to the equations:1. (x + 1 = k cdot y)2. (y + 1 = m cdot x)where (k) and (m) are positive integers. Substituting (x = k cdot y - 1) into the second equation, we get:[y + 1 = m cdot (k cdot y - 1)]Expanding and rearranging terms, we find:[y cdot (m cdot k - 1) = m + 1]Thus, (y = frac{m + 1}{m cdot k - 1}). Similarly, substituting (y = m cdot x - 1) into the first equation, we get:[x cdot (k cdot m - 1) = k + 1]Thus, (x = frac{k + 1}{k cdot m - 1}). Both (x) and (y) must be natural numbers, leading to the conditions that (m cdot k - 1) must divide both (m + 1) and (k + 1).By analyzing small values and considering the symmetry between (x) and (y), we find the following pairs:1. When (x = y), the only solution is ((1, 1)).2. When (x &lt; y), we find ((1, 2)) and ((2, 3)).3. When (x &gt; y), we find ((2, 1)) and ((3, 2)).Checking these pairs confirms they satisfy the conditions:- ((1, 1)): (frac{1+1}{1} = 2) and (frac{1+1}{1} = 2)- ((1, 2)): (frac{1+1}{2} = 1) and (frac{2+1}{1} = 3)- ((2, 1)): (frac{2+1}{1} = 3) and (frac{1+1}{2} = 1)- ((2, 3)): (frac{2+1}{3} = 1) and (frac{3+1}{2} = 2)- ((3, 2)): (frac{3+1}{2} = 2) and (frac{2+1}{3} = 1)Thus, the natural number pairs are (boxed{(1, 1)}), (boxed{(1, 2)}), (boxed{(2, 1)}), (boxed{(2, 3)}), and (boxed{(3, 2)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find all pairs of natural numbers (x, y) such that both (x + 1)/y and (y + 1)/x are natural numbers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since x and y are natural numbers, they have to be positive integers. The conditions require that y divides x + 1 and x divides y + 1. So, another way to put it is:1. y | x + 1 ⇒ x + 1 = k * y for some natural number k.2. x | y + 1 ⇒ y + 1 = m * x for some natural number m.So, we have two equations:x + 1 = k * y  ...(1)y + 1 = m * x  ...(2)Our goal is to find all (x, y) in natural numbers satisfying both equations.Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let&#39;s try substituting x from equation (1) into equation (2).From equation (1): x = k * y - 1Plug this into equation (2):y + 1 = m * (k * y - 1)Expanding the right-hand side:y + 1 = m * k * y - mLet&#39;s collect terms with y on one side:y - m * k * y = -m -1Factor y:y * (1 - m * k) = - (m + 1)Multiply both sides by -1:y * (m * k - 1) = m + 1Therefore:y = (m + 1) / (m * k - 1)Since y must be a natural number, the denominator (m * k - 1) must divide (m + 1). Also, denominator must be a positive integer because y is positive, so:m * k - 1 &gt; 0 ⇒ m * k &gt; 1Similarly, m and k are natural numbers. So, m and k are at least 1. But if m = k = 1, then m * k = 1, which gives denominator 0, which is invalid. So, at least one of m or k must be greater than 1.Let me write down possible values for m and k. Since m and k are natural numbers, let&#39;s consider small values first and see if we can find a pattern or get all possible solutions.Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution in another way. Let&#39;s try substituting equation (1) and (2) into each other. Let me write:From (1): x = k * y - 1From (2): y = m * x - 1Substituting x from (1) into (2):y = m * (k * y - 1) - 1Expanding:y = m * k * y - m - 1Bring all terms with y to left:y - m * k * y = -m -1Factor y:y * (1 - m * k) = - (m + 1)Which is the same equation as before, leading to:y = (m + 1)/(m * k - 1)So, that&#39;s the same expression. So, since y must be a natural number, (m * k - 1) must divide (m + 1). Therefore, (m * k - 1) | (m + 1). Let&#39;s denote d = m * k - 1. Then d divides m + 1, so d is a positive divisor of m + 1. Since d = m * k - 1, we can write m * k = d + 1. So, m * k = d + 1. But since d divides m + 1, we can write m + 1 = d * t for some natural number t.Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe try small values of m and k?Alternatively, note that since x divides y + 1 and y divides x + 1, perhaps x and y are close to each other. Let&#39;s consider some small natural numbers and check.Case 1: x = yIf x = y, then from equation (1): x + 1 = k * x ⇒ x(k - 1) = 1. Since x is natural, x = 1 and k -1 = 1 ⇒ k = 2. Similarly, from equation (2): y + 1 = m * y ⇒ same thing, y = 1, m = 2. So x = y = 1. Let&#39;s check:(1 + 1)/1 = 2, which is natural, and (1 + 1)/1 = 2, also natural. So (1,1) is a solution.Case 2: x ≠ y. Let&#39;s assume x &gt; y. Then, from equation (1): x + 1 = k * y. Since x &gt; y, k must be at least 1. Let&#39;s suppose k = 1. Then x + 1 = y. Then from equation (2): y + 1 = m * x. Substituting y = x + 1 into equation (2):(x + 1) + 1 = m * x ⇒ x + 2 = m * x ⇒ x(m - 1) = 2.Since x is natural, m - 1 must divide 2. So m -1 can be 1 or 2. Hence m = 2 or 3.If m = 2: x = 2. Then y = x + 1 = 3. Check: (2 +1)/3 = 1, natural. (3 +1)/2 = 2, natural. So (2,3) is a solution.If m = 3: x = 2 / (3 -1) = 1. Wait, x(m -1) = 2 ⇒ x = 2/(m -1). For m=3, x=1. Then y = x +1 = 2. Check: (1 +1)/2 = 1, natural. (2 +1)/1 = 3, natural. So (1,2) is a solution. But here, x=1, y=2, so x &lt; y, but we assumed x &gt; y earlier. Hmm, so maybe my assumption that x &gt; y was not necessary. Let&#39;s correct that.So, if k =1, then y = x +1. Then in equation (2), y = x +1, so (x +1) +1 = m *x ⇒ x +2 = m *x ⇒ x(m -1)=2. Which gives x=1, m=3 or x=2, m=2. Therefore, leading to pairs (1,2) and (2,3). But then, since x and y are interchangeable in the problem (the equations are symmetric if we swap x and y), so if (x,y) is a solution, then (y,x) should also be a solution. Wait, let&#39;s check.Suppose (x,y) is a solution, so (x+1)/y and (y+1)/x are natural. Then, swapping x and y, we have (y+1)/x and (x+1)/y, which are the same as the original, so yes, symmetric. Therefore, if (x,y) is a solution, then (y,x) is also a solution. So, if (2,3) is a solution, then (3,2) should be a solution. Let me check (3,2):(3 +1)/2 = 4/2 = 2, natural. (2 +1)/3 = 1, natural. So (3,2) is a solution. Similarly, (1,2) swaps to (2,1). Check (2,1):(2 +1)/1 = 3, natural. (1 +1)/2 = 1, natural. So (2,1) is also a solution. Wait, but earlier when k=1, we only got (1,2) and (2,3). So maybe there are more solutions when k is greater than 1.Let me check k=2. Let&#39;s suppose k=2. Then from equation (1): x +1 = 2y ⇒ x = 2y -1. Substitute into equation (2): y +1 = m * x = m*(2y -1). So:y +1 = 2m y - mBring terms with y to the left:y - 2m y = -m -1y(1 - 2m) = -m -1Multiply both sides by -1:y(2m -1) = m +1So, y = (m +1)/(2m -1)Since y must be natural, denominator 2m -1 must divide m +1, and 2m -1 &gt;0 ⇒ m ≥1. Let&#39;s check m=1:y=(1+1)/(2*1 -1)=2/1=2. Then x=2y -1=4 -1=3. So (3,2), which we already have.m=2:y=(2+1)/(4 -1)=3/3=1. Then x=2*1 -1=1. So (1,2), which is also already found.m=3:y=(3+1)/(6 -1)=4/5. Not natural. Disregard.m=4:y=(4+1)/(8 -1)=5/7. Not natural. So no solution here. Similarly, higher m would result in denominator larger than numerator, so no natural numbers.So for k=2, we only get existing solutions. What about k=3?If k=3, then from equation (1): x +1 =3y ⇒ x=3y -1. Substitute into equation (2):y +1 =m*(3y -1)Expanding:y +1 =3m y -mBring terms with y to left:y -3m y = -m -1y(1 -3m) = -m -1Multiply by -1:y(3m -1) = m +1Therefore, y = (m +1)/(3m -1)Again, y must be natural. So denominator 3m -1 must divide m +1. Let&#39;s check m=1:y=(1+1)/(3*1 -1)=2/2=1. Then x=3*1 -1=2. So (2,1), which is known.m=2:y=(2+1)/(6 -1)=3/5. Not natural.m=3:y=(3+1)/(9 -1)=4/8=0.5. Not natural. So no solutions here.Similarly, higher m would make denominator larger, so no.So for k=3, only m=1 gives a solution we already have.Similarly, for k=4:x +1 =4y ⇒x=4y -1. Substitute into equation (2):y +1 =m*(4y -1)y +1=4m y -mBring terms:y -4m y = -m -1y(1 -4m)= -m -1Multiply by -1:y(4m -1)=m +1Thus, y=(m +1)/(4m -1)Check m=1:y=(1+1)/(4 -1)=2/3. Not natural.m=2:y=3/(8 -1)=3/7. Not natural.m=3:4/11. Not natural. So no solutions here.Therefore, k=4 gives no new solutions. It seems that for k≥2, the only solutions we get are the ones we already found when k=1 or k=2. Maybe all solutions are generated when k=1 and k=2.Wait, but perhaps we need to check m and k in another way. Let&#39;s try to find possible values for m and k such that (m * k -1) divides (m +1). From the equation y=(m +1)/(m * k -1). So, since m and k are natural numbers ≥1, let&#39;s consider possible divisors.Let me think of (m * k -1) as a divisor of (m +1). So for each m, possible divisors d of (m +1) must satisfy d = m * k -1. Hence, m * k = d +1. Since d divides m +1, then d ≤ m +1. So, m * k -1 ≤ m +1 ⇒ m *k ≤ m +2 ⇒ m(k -1) ≤ 2.Since m and k are natural numbers. Let&#39;s analyze this inequality: m(k -1) ≤ 2.Possible cases:Case 1: k -1 =0 ⇒ k=1. Then m*0 ≤2 ⇒ always true. So k=1. Then, for k=1, we have:From equation (1): x +1 =1*y ⇒ x = y -1From equation (2): y +1 = m *x = m*(y -1)So:y +1 = m(y -1)Rearranged:y +1 = m y -mBring terms with y to left:y - m y = -m -1 ⇒ y(1 - m) = -m -1 ⇒ y = (m +1)/(m -1)Since y must be natural, (m -1) divides (m +1). Let&#39;s compute (m +1)/(m -1). Let&#39;s denote t = m -1, so m = t +1. Then:(m +1)/(m -1) = (t +2)/t = 1 + 2/tSo, 2/t must be an integer. Therefore, t must be a divisor of 2. Since t is a natural number (as m ≥1, t = m -1 ≥0, but m must be at least 2 because denominator m -1 must be at least 1 (since y must be natural). Therefore, t ≥1. So, t divides 2, t=1 or t=2.Therefore:t=1 ⇒ m=2 ⇒ y=(2 +1)/(2 -1)=3/1=3. Then x = y -1=2. So (x,y)=(2,3). Which is already found.t=2 ⇒ m=3 ⇒ y=(3 +1)/(3 -1)=4/2=2. Then x=2 -1=1. So (1,2). Also known.So, k=1 gives us solutions (1,2) and (2,3). Which is consistent with previous findings.Case 2: k -1 =1 ⇒k=2. Then m*1 ≤2 ⇒m ≤2. So m=1 or m=2.For k=2, m=1:From equation (1): x +1=2y ⇒x=2y -1From equation (2): y +1=1*x =2y -1So, y +1 =2y -1 ⇒y=2. Then x=2*2 -1=3. So (3,2). Already found.For k=2, m=2:From equation (1): x +1=2yFrom equation (2): y +1=2xSo, we have:x =2y -1y +1=2*(2y -1) ⇒y +1=4y -2 ⇒3y=3 ⇒y=1. Then x=2*1 -1=1. So (1,1). Which is also a known solution.Case3: k -1=2 ⇒k=3. Then m*2 ≤2 ⇒m ≤1. But m is natural, so m=1.For k=3, m=1:From equation (1): x +1=3y ⇒x=3y -1From equation (2): y +1=1*x=3y -1So, y +1=3y -1 ⇒2y=2 ⇒y=1. Then x=3*1 -1=2. Check:(x +1)/y=(2+1)/1=3, natural.(y +1)/x=(1+1)/2=1, natural. So (2,1) which is a swap of (1,2). But we already have this.Thus, the only solutions obtained from k=3, m=1 is (2,1). Which is already known.Case4: k -1≥3, but m(k-1) ≤2. Since m is natural, m ≥1. If k -1≥3, then m*3 ≤2 ⇒m ≤2/3, which is impossible. Therefore, no solutions in this case.Therefore, all possible solutions are covered by the cases above. So, the solutions are:(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).Wait, but (1,1) was found when x=y=1. Then (1,2) and (2,1), (2,3) and (3,2). Let&#39;s check if there are any other solutions.Wait, when we considered k=1, we found (1,2) and (2,3). Then swapping gives (2,1) and (3,2). Also, (1,1) is a solution. Are there any more solutions?Let me check x=2, y=3. Then (2+1)/3=1, natural. (3+1)/2=2, natural. Yes. Then x=3, y=2. Similarly, (3+1)/2=2, (2+1)/3=1. Correct.x=1,y=2: (1+1)/2=1, (2+1)/1=3. Correct.x=2,y=1: (2+1)/1=3, (1+1)/2=1. Correct.x=1,y=1: (1+1)/1=2, (1+1)/1=2. Correct.But let&#39;s check if there are other possible solutions. Let&#39;s try x=4,y=?If x=4, then from equation (2): y +1 must be divisible by 4. So y +1=4m ⇒y=4m -1. Then substitute into equation (1): x +1 =k * y ⇒4 +1 =k*(4m -1) ⇒5 =k*(4m -1). So 4m -1 must divide 5. Divisors of 5 are 1,5.Case 1: 4m -1=1 ⇒4m=2 ⇒m=0.5. Not natural.Case2:4m -1=5 ⇒4m=6 ⇒m=1.5. Not natural.Thus, no solutions with x=4.Similarly, check x=3. If x=3, then y +1 must be divisible by 3. So y=3m -1. Then from equation (1): x +1 =k * y ⇒4 =k*(3m -1). So 3m -1 divides 4. Divisors of 4:1,2,4.3m -1=1 ⇒3m=2 ⇒m=2/3. Not natural.3m -1=2 ⇒3m=3 ⇒m=1. Then y=2. So (3,2). Already known.3m -1=4 ⇒3m=5 ⇒m=5/3. Not natural.Thus, no new solutions here.Similarly, if x=5, then y +1=5m ⇒y=5m -1. Substitute into equation (1):5 +1=6=k*y=k*(5m -1). So 6 must be divisible by 5m -1. So 5m -1 divides 6. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6.Case1:5m -1=1 ⇒5m=2 ⇒m=2/5. Not natural.Case2:5m -1=2 ⇒5m=3 ⇒m=3/5. Not natural.Case3:5m -1=3 ⇒5m=4 ⇒m=4/5. Not natural.Case4:5m -1=6 ⇒5m=7 ⇒m=7/5. Not natural.No solutions.Similarly, check x=5, etc., but seems no solutions. So, perhaps there are only the solutions we found.Thus, the solutions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).Wait, but when we started, we considered x=y=1. Then, when k=1, m=2 and m=3 gave (1,2) and (2,3). Then swapping gives (2,1) and (3,2). So, total of five solutions. Wait, but (1,1) is another one. Let&#39;s confirm (1,1):(1+1)/1=2, which is natural. Similarly, (1+1)/1=2. So yes, (1,1) is valid.Is there another solution where x= y &gt;1? For example, x=y=2. Then check:(2+1)/2=1.5, not natural. So invalid.x=y=3:(3+1)/3 ≈1.333, not natural. So no.Thus, only x=y=1 works.Therefore, all solutions are:(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).But wait, let&#39;s check if (3,2) leads to another solution. If x=3, y=2, then (3+1)/2=2 and (2+1)/3=1, so that&#39;s okay. So yes.Wait, let me check if there&#39;s a case where m and k are higher, but perhaps with different combinations. Suppose m=1, k=4. Then, from equation y=(m +1)/(m *k -1)=2/(4 -1)=2/3. Not natural. Similarly, other combinations may not work.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Let me consider the equations:From y divides x +1 and x divides y +1, so we can say:x ≤ y +1 and y ≤ x +1. So x and y are within 1 of each other or something. But maybe not.But more precisely, since y divides x +1, y ≤ x +1. Similarly, x ≤ y +1. So combining these, we have y ≤ x +1 and x ≤ y +1 ⇒ |x - y| ≤1. Therefore, either x = y, x = y +1, or y = x +1.Thus, possible cases:Case1: x = y. Then (x +1)/x must be natural. So (x +1)/x =1 +1/x. This is natural only if 1/x is integer. Since x is natural, x must divide 1. Thus, x=1. Therefore, (1,1) is the only solution here.Case2: x = y +1. Then, from equation (1): x +1 = y +2. Since y divides x +1, which is y +2. So y divides y +2 ⇒ y divides 2. Therefore, possible y=1,2.If y=1: x=2. Then check equation (2): y +1 =2, which must divide x=2. So 2 divides 2. Yes. So (2,1) is a solution.If y=2: x=3. Then equation (2): y +1=3 must divide x=3. Yes, 3 divides 3. So (3,2) is a solution.Case3: y =x +1. Then, similar to Case2. From equation (2): y +1 =x +2. Since x divides y +1 =x +2. So x divides x +2 ⇒x divides 2. Therefore, x=1,2.If x=1: y=2. Check equation (1): x +1=2 divides y=2. Yes. So (1,2).If x=2: y=3. Check equation (1): x +1=3 divides y=3. Yes. So (2,3).Therefore, all solutions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). So that&#39;s five solutions.Hence, these are all possible pairs.Final AnswerThe natural number pairs are boxed{(1, 1)}, boxed{(1, 2)}, boxed{(2, 1)}, boxed{(2, 3)}, and boxed{(3, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find all pairs of natural numbers ((x, y)) such that both (frac{x+1}{y}) and (frac{y+1}{x}) are natural numbers, we start by noting that these conditions imply (y) divides (x + 1) and (x) divides (y + 1). This translates to the equations:1. (x + 1 = k cdot y) for some natural number (k)2. (y + 1 = m cdot x) for some natural number (m)We substitute (x) from the first equation into the second and vice versa, leading to the analysis of possible values for (k) and (m). Through detailed case analysis and substitution, we find the following key steps:1. Case (x = y):   - The equation (frac{x+1}{x}) must be natural, leading to (x = 1). Thus, ((1, 1)) is a solution.2. Case (x = y + 1):   - Substituting (x = y + 1) into the equations, we find (y) must divide 2, leading to (y = 1) or (y = 2). This gives pairs ((2, 1)) and ((3, 2)).3. Case (y = x + 1):   - Substituting (y = x + 1) into the equations, we find (x) must divide 2, leading to (x = 1) or (x = 2). This gives pairs ((1, 2)) and ((2, 3)).4. Symmetry Consideration:   - Since the problem is symmetric in (x) and (y), if ((x, y)) is a solution, then ((y, x)) is also a solution. This gives the pairs ((2, 1)) and ((3, 2)) from the previous steps.After verifying all possible cases and ensuring no other solutions exist, we conclude the pairs of natural numbers ((x, y)) that satisfy the given conditions are:[boxed{(1, 1)}, boxed{(1, 2)}, boxed{(2, 1)}, boxed{(2, 3)}, boxed{(3, 2)}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-516ba452></div><p class="review-content" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>🔑:</span>Niech  (x,y)  będzie jedną z szukanych par.

I need to find the limit of this sequence as n approaches infinity: [(2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1)]^(3n² - 7). Hmm, limits involving exponents can be tricky. Maybe I can simplify the expression inside the brackets first?So, the base is (2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1). Both the numerator and the denominator are quadratic polynomials in n. As n becomes very large, the leading terms should dominate, right? So both the numerator and denominator are approximately 2n², so the base is roughly 2n²/2n² = 1. But since it&#39;s raised to the power of something that&#39;s growing like 3n², which also goes to infinity, this seems like a 1^∞ indeterminate form. I remember that for limits of the form [1 + f(n)]^g(n), where f(n) approaches 0 and g(n) approaches infinity, the limit can sometimes be e^{lim f(n)*g(n)}. Maybe that applies here?Let me try to rewrite the base as 1 + something. Let&#39;s compute the difference between the numerator and the denominator: (2n² + 2n + 3) - (2n² + 2n + 1) = 2. So the numerator is denominator + 2. Therefore, the base can be written as 1 + 2/(2n² + 2n + 1). So the expression becomes [1 + 2/(2n² + 2n + 1)]^(3n² - 7). Now, let&#39;s denote a_n = 2/(2n² + 2n + 1) and b_n = 3n² - 7. Then our expression is (1 + a_n)^{b_n}. If a_n approaches 0 and b_n approaches infinity, then the limit might be e^{lim (a_n * b_n)}. Let me check if that works here.First, compute lim (a_n * b_n) as n approaches infinity. So that&#39;s lim [2/(2n² + 2n + 1)] * (3n² - 7). Let&#39;s simplify this expression:First, let&#39;s factor out n² from the denominator and numerator. For the denominator: 2n² + 2n + 1 = n²(2 + 2/n + 1/n²). For the numerator of a_n: 2. For b_n: 3n² - 7 = n²(3 - 7/n²).So multiplying them together: [2 / (n²(2 + 2/n + 1/n²)))] * [n²(3 - 7/n²)] = [2 * n²(3 - 7/n²)] / [n²(2 + 2/n + 1/n²))] ].The n² cancels out: 2*(3 - 7/n²) / (2 + 2/n + 1/n²). Now take the limit as n approaches infinity. The terms with 1/n and 1/n² go to 0, so we get 2*3 / 2 = 6/2 = 3. So lim (a_n * b_n) = 3. Therefore, the original limit should be e^3.Wait, but let me verify this step-by-step. Maybe I should compute the limit more carefully. Let&#39;s do it without substituting variables.Original expression: [ (2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1) ]^(3n² -7)First, write the fraction as 1 + [ (2n² + 2n + 3 - (2n² + 2n + 1)) / (2n² + 2n + 1) ) ] = 1 + [2 / (2n² + 2n + 1)].So it&#39;s [1 + 2/(2n² + 2n + 1)]^(3n² -7). Let&#39;s take the natural logarithm to simplify the limit. Let L be the limit we want. Then ln L = lim (3n² -7) * ln[1 + 2/(2n² + 2n +1)].We can use the approximation that ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... for small x. Since as n approaches infinity, 2/(2n² + 2n +1) is approximately 1/n², which tends to 0. So ln(1 + x) ≈ x for small x. Therefore, ln L ≈ lim (3n² -7) * [2/(2n² + 2n +1)].Now compute this limit: lim (3n² -7) * [2/(2n² + 2n +1)].Multiply numerator and denominator: [2(3n² -7)] / (2n² + 2n +1). Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by n²:Numerator: [2(3 -7/n²)] / [2 + 2/n +1/n²]. As n approaches infinity, the terms with 1/n² and 1/n go to 0, so this becomes [2*3]/[2] = 6/2 = 3. Therefore, ln L = 3, so L = e^3.Therefore, the limit is e³. Let me check if there&#39;s another way to approach this. Maybe using the standard limit lim (1 + a/n²)^(n²) = e^a as n approaches infinity. Here, if we can write the expression in the form (1 + a/n²)^(n² * b), then the limit would be e^(a*b). Let&#39;s see.Original expression: [1 + 2/(2n² + 2n +1)]^(3n² -7). Let&#39;s approximate the denominator 2n² + 2n +1 as 2n²(1 + 1/n + 1/(2n²)). So 2/(2n² + 2n +1) ≈ 2/(2n²(1 + 1/n + 1/(2n²))) = (1/n²) * [1/(1 + 1/n + 1/(2n²))]. Then, using the expansion 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x for small x, so [1/(1 + 1/n + 1/(2n²))] ≈ 1 - 1/n -1/(2n²) + (1/n)^2 + ... Hmm, but this might complicate things. Maybe my initial approach was better.Alternatively, note that as n approaches infinity, 2n² +2n +1 ≈ 2n², so 2/(2n² +2n +1) ≈ 2/(2n²) = 1/n². Then the base is 1 + 1/n², and the exponent is 3n². So (1 +1/n²)^{3n²} approaches e^{3}, since lim (1 +1/n²)^{n²} = e. So raising that to the 3rd power gives e³. But here, the exponent is 3n² -7 instead of 3n², but the -7 is negligible compared to 3n² as n approaches infinity. So the limit should still be e³.Alternatively, to be precise, let&#39;s write the exponent as 3n²(1 - 7/(3n²)). Then, the entire expression is [1 +1/n² * (1/(1 + 1/n + 1/(2n²)))]^{3n²(1 -7/(3n²))}. Hmm, but maybe this is overcomplicating. Since the dominant term in the exponent is 3n², and the correction term -7 becomes negligible as n grows.Therefore, combining the approximations, the limit is e³. So I think that&#39;s the answer. Let me confirm with another method. Suppose we take the logarithm:Let me set L = lim_{n→∞} [(2n² + 2n +3)/(2n² +2n +1)]^{3n² -7}Take natural log:ln L = lim_{n→∞} (3n² -7) * ln[(2n² +2n +3)/(2n² +2n +1)]Let me compute the logarithm term:ln[(2n² +2n +3)/(2n² +2n +1)] = ln[1 + 2/(2n² +2n +1)]As before, for large n, 2/(2n² +2n +1) ≈ 1/n². Then ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ..., so for small x, ln(1 +x) ≈ x. So:ln[1 + 2/(2n² +2n +1)] ≈ 2/(2n² +2n +1) ≈ 1/n².Therefore, ln L ≈ lim (3n² -7)*(1/n²) = lim (3 -7/n²) = 3. Hence, ln L =3, so L= e³. So same result.Alternatively, more rigorously, perhaps using Taylor series expansion for the logarithm.Let me denote x_n = 2/(2n² +2n +1). Then as n→infty, x_n ~ 1/n². Then ln(1 +x_n) = x_n - x_n²/2 + x_n³/3 - ... So:ln L = lim (3n² -7)[x_n - x_n²/2 + ...]Compute term by term:First term: (3n² -7)*x_n = (3n² -7)*(2)/(2n² +2n +1). As before, divide numerator and denominator by n²:(3 -7/n²)*(2)/(2 +2/n +1/n²) → (3)*(2)/2 = 3.Second term: - (3n² -7)*x_n²/2. Let&#39;s compute x_n²: [2/(2n² +2n +1)]² ≈ (2/(2n²))² = (1/n²)² =1/n⁴. Then (3n² -7)*x_n² ≈ 3n²*(1/n⁴) =3/n². So the second term is - (3n² -7)*(1/n⁴)* (2)^2/(2n² +2n +1)^2? Wait, maybe better to compute exactly.Wait x_n = 2/(2n² +2n +1), so x_n² =4/( (2n² +2n +1)^2 ). Then (3n² -7)*x_n² =4(3n² -7)/(2n² +2n +1)^2. Let&#39;s approximate denominator: (2n²)^2 =4n⁴. So approximately, numerator is 4*3n², denominator is 4n⁴, so the term is (12n²)/(4n⁴) =3/n². So (3n² -7)*x_n² ≈3/n². Therefore, the second term is - (3n² -7)*x_n²/2 ≈ - (3/n²)/2, which tends to 0 as n approaches infinity.Similarly, higher order terms will involve higher powers of 1/n² multiplied by n², so they will tend to 0. Therefore, ln L =3 +0 +0 +...=3. So L=e³.Therefore, all methods point to the limit being e cubed. So I&#39;m pretty confident the answer is e³.Final AnswerThe limit is boxed{e^3}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the limit of the sequence:lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+3}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)^{3 n^{2}-7}we start by rewriting the base of the expression. The numerator and denominator are both quadratic polynomials, and as ( n ) approaches infinity, the dominant terms are ( 2n^2 ). We express the base as:1 + frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}This transforms the original expression into:left(1 + frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}right)^{3n^2 - 7}Recognizing this as a ( 1^infty ) indeterminate form, we use the property that if ( a_n to 0 ) and ( b_n to infty ), then ( (1 + a_n)^{b_n} approx e^{a_n b_n} ). Here, ( a_n = frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1} ) and ( b_n = 3n^2 - 7 ).We compute the limit of ( a_n cdot b_n ):lim_{n to infty} left( frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1} cdot (3n^2 - 7) right)Simplifying this expression, we divide the numerator and denominator by ( n^2 ):lim_{n to infty} left( frac{2 cdot (3 - frac{7}{n^2})}{2 + frac{2}{n} + frac{1}{n^2}} right) = frac{2 cdot 3}{2} = 3Thus, the limit of ( a_n cdot b_n ) is 3. Therefore, the original limit is ( e^3 ).To confirm, we take the natural logarithm of the expression and use the approximation ( ln(1 + x) approx x ) for small ( x ):ln L = lim_{n to infty} (3n^2 - 7) cdot lnleft(1 + frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}right) = lim_{n to infty} (3n^2 - 7) cdot frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}This simplifies to the same limit as before, confirming that ( ln L = 3 ) and hence ( L = e^3 ).The final answer is:boxed{e^3},&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the limit of this sequence as n approaches infinity: [(2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1)]^(3n² - 7). Hmm. So, it&#39;s like a fraction raised to the power of a quadratic term. Limits involving exponents often involve using the exponential function and logarithms, right? Maybe I can take the natural logarithm, find the limit of that, and then exponentiate the result. Let me try that approach.First, let me denote the sequence as a_n = [(2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1)]^(3n² - 7). Then, if I take ln(a_n), that would be (3n² - 7) * ln[(2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1)]. So, I need to compute the limit of this expression as n approaches infinity, and then exponentiate the result.Let me focus on the logarithm part first: ln[(2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1)]. Let me write that as ln(1 + [ (2n² + 2n + 3) - (2n² + 2n + 1) ] / (2n² + 2n + 1)). Simplifying the numerator inside the logarithm: (2n² + 2n + 3) - (2n² + 2n + 1) = 2. So, the expression becomes ln(1 + 2 / (2n² + 2n + 1)).So, ln(1 + 2/(2n² + 2n + 1)). Now, when n is very large, 2/(2n² + 2n + 1) is very small, right? Because the denominator is quadratic. So, maybe I can use the approximation that ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... for small x. Since x is going to be very small here, maybe I can approximate ln(1 + x) ≈ x. Let me check if that&#39;s valid here. The error term would be on the order of x², which for x ~ 1/n² would be 1/n⁴. So, if I multiply that by (3n² - 7), which is ~3n², then the error term would be ~3n²*(1/n⁴) = 3/n², which goes to zero. So, maybe using the first term of the expansion is sufficient here.Therefore, ln(1 + 2/(2n² + 2n + 1)) ≈ 2/(2n² + 2n + 1). Therefore, ln(a_n) ≈ (3n² - 7) * [2/(2n² + 2n + 1)]. Now, let&#39;s compute this expression.First, simplify 2/(2n² + 2n + 1). Let me factor out n² from the denominator: 2/(n²(2 + 2/n + 1/n²)) = 2/(n² * [2 + 2/n + 1/n²]). Then, 2 divided by n² times that term. So, 2/(2n² + 2n + 1) = (2/n²) / [2 + 2/n + 1/n²].But maybe another approach: let&#39;s write both numerator and denominator in terms of leading terms. So, the denominator is 2n² + 2n + 1. For large n, this is approximately 2n². Similarly, the numerator of the original fraction was 2n² + 2n + 3, which is also approximately 2n². So, their ratio is approximately 1, but with a small difference.But let&#39;s get back to the logarithm approximation. So, ln(a_n) ≈ (3n² -7) * [2/(2n² + 2n + 1)]. Let&#39;s write that as:Multiply numerator and denominator by 1/n² to make it easier. Let me do that:Numerator: 3n² - 7 = n²(3 - 7/n²)Denominator: 2n² + 2n + 1 = n²(2 + 2/n + 1/n²)So, ln(a_n) ≈ [n²(3 - 7/n²)] * [2 / (n²(2 + 2/n + 1/n²))]Simplify: The n² in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving [3 - 7/n²] * [2 / (2 + 2/n + 1/n²)]Now, as n approaches infinity, 7/n² approaches 0, 2/n approaches 0, and 1/n² approaches 0. Therefore, this expression simplifies to [3] * [2 / 2] = 3 * 1 = 3. Therefore, the limit of ln(a_n) as n approaches infinity is 3. Therefore, the limit of a_n is e³.Wait, but let me check that step again. So, the expression after canceling n² was [3 - 7/n²] * [2 / (2 + 2/n + 1/n²)]. Taking the limit as n approaches infinity, yes, each of the terms with 1/n or 1/n² go to zero, so this becomes 3 * (2 / 2) = 3. Therefore, the limit of ln(a_n) is 3, so the limit of a_n is e³. So, the answer is e³.But let me verify this again step by step because sometimes these approximations can be tricky. Let&#39;s re-express the original expression:First, the base of the exponent is (2n² + 2n + 3)/(2n² + 2n + 1). Let&#39;s write this as 1 + [2]/[2n² + 2n + 1]. So, it&#39;s 1 + 2/(2n² + 2n + 1). Then, raising this to the power of (3n² -7).We know that for large n, expressions of the form (1 + a/n²)^(n²) tend to e^a. But here, the exponent is 3n² -7, and the denominator in the base is 2n² + 2n +1. So, perhaps we can manipulate it into the standard form (1 + 1/k)^k.Let me see. Let&#39;s denote:Let’s set the term inside the brackets as 1 + x_n, where x_n = 2/(2n² + 2n +1). Then, the expression becomes (1 + x_n)^{3n² -7}.We can write this as [(1 + x_n)^{1/x_n}]^{x_n*(3n² -7)}. Then, as n approaches infinity, if x_n approaches 0, which it does, then (1 + x_n)^{1/x_n} approaches e. Therefore, the entire expression would approach e^{lim_{n→∞} x_n*(3n² -7)}.Therefore, we need to compute lim_{n→∞} x_n*(3n² -7) = lim_{n→∞} [2/(2n² + 2n +1)]*(3n² -7).Compute this limit:First, write numerator and denominator in terms of n²:Numerator: 2*(3n² -7) = 6n² -14Denominator: 2n² + 2n +1Therefore, the expression is (6n² -14)/(2n² + 2n +1). Divide numerator and denominator by n²:(6 -14/n²)/(2 + 2/n +1/n²). As n approaches infinity, this becomes 6/2 = 3. Therefore, the limit is 3, so the original expression tends to e³. Therefore, the answer is e³.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute it directly without substitution. The expression [ (2n² + 2n +3)/(2n² + 2n +1) ]^(3n² -7). Let&#39;s write the base as 1 + 2/(2n² + 2n +1). Then, as n becomes large, 2/(2n² + 2n +1) ~ 2/(2n²) = 1/n². So, the base is approximately 1 + 1/n². Then, raising this to the power of 3n². Then, using the approximation (1 + a/n²)^{bn²} ≈ e^{ab} as n→∞. Here, a =1, b=3, so e^{1*3}=e³. That matches the previous result.Alternatively, using logarithms as before. Let me do that again step by step to confirm.Let’s compute lim_{n→∞} (3n² -7) * ln[(2n² + 2n +3)/(2n² + 2n +1)]Let’s compute the logarithm term:ln[(2n² + 2n +3)/(2n² + 2n +1)] = ln[1 + 2/(2n² + 2n +1)]As n approaches infinity, 2/(2n² + 2n +1) ≈ 1/n². So, the logarithm is approximately 1/n². Then, multiplying by (3n² -7) gives approximately (3n²)(1/n²) = 3, so the limit is 3, and the exponential is e³.Therefore, all approaches lead to the conclusion that the limit is e³. Therefore, the answer should be e³.But just to be thorough, let me check using another method. Let&#39;s write the expression in the form exp( (3n² -7) * ln(1 + 2/(2n² +2n +1)) ). Then, expand the logarithm as a Taylor series.So, ln(1 + x) = x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ..., where x = 2/(2n² +2n +1). Therefore,ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...Thus, (3n² -7) * [x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...] ≈ (3n² -7)x - (3n² -7)x²/2 + ...Compute term by term:First term: (3n² -7)x = (3n² -7)*(2)/(2n² +2n +1). As n→∞, this is approximately (3n²)*(2)/(2n²) = 3*2/2=3. The exact limit was computed earlier as 3.Second term: -(3n² -7)x²/2. Let&#39;s compute x²:x = 2/(2n² +2n +1), so x² = 4/(2n² +2n +1)^2 ≈ 4/(4n⁴) = 1/n⁴. Therefore, x² ≈ 1/n⁴. Then, (3n² -7)x² ≈ (3n²)(1/n⁴) = 3/n². Therefore, the second term is approximately - (3/n²)/2 = -3/(2n²). As n→∞, this term goes to 0.Similarly, higher-order terms will involve higher powers of 1/n², multiplied by n² (from 3n² -7), but each term will be of lower order and vanish. Therefore, the dominant term is 3, and the next terms vanish. Therefore, the total limit of the logarithm is 3, so the exponential is e³. So, the limit is indeed e³.Alternatively, maybe using substitution to make it look like the standard (1 + 1/k)^k. Let me try that.Let’s set k = n². Then, as n approaches infinity, k approaches infinity. But not sure. Alternatively, set m = n², but not sure. Alternatively, manipulate the expression.Wait, another approach: write the fraction as [1 + (2)/(2n² +2n +1)] and then raise it to (3n² -7). Let me denote the term inside as 1 + a_n, where a_n = 2/(2n² +2n +1). Then, the expression is (1 + a_n)^{3n² -7}. Let me write this as [(1 + a_n)^{1/a_n}]^{a_n*(3n² -7)}. Then, as n approaches infinity, a_n approaches 0, so (1 + a_n)^{1/a_n} approaches e. Therefore, the limit becomes e^{lim_{n→∞} a_n*(3n² -7)}.Compute lim_{n→∞} a_n*(3n² -7):a_n = 2/(2n² +2n +1)Multiply by (3n² -7):2*(3n² -7)/(2n² +2n +1). Divide numerator and denominator by n²:2*(3 -7/n²)/(2 +2/n +1/n²). As n approaches infinity, this becomes 2*3 /2 = 3. Therefore, the limit is e³. Same result.Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is e³. Therefore, I&#39;m confident that the limit is e cubed.Final AnswerThe limit of the sequence is boxed{e^3}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the limit of the sequence:lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+3}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)^{3 n^{2}-7}we start by rewriting the expression inside the limit as ( a_n = left(frac{2n^2 + 2n + 3}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}right)^{3n^2 - 7} ).Taking the natural logarithm of ( a_n ):ln(a_n) = (3n^2 - 7) lnleft(frac{2n^2 + 2n + 3}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}right)Simplifying the argument of the logarithm:lnleft(1 + frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}right)For large ( n ), the term ( frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1} ) is small, so we use the approximation ( ln(1 + x) approx x ) for small ( x ):lnleft(1 + frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}right) approx frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}Thus,ln(a_n) approx (3n^2 - 7) cdot frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}Simplifying the expression:(3n^2 - 7) cdot frac{2}{2n^2 + 2n + 1} = frac{2(3n^2 - 7)}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}Dividing the numerator and denominator by ( n^2 ):frac{2(3 - 7/n^2)}{2 + 2/n + 1/n^2}As ( n to infty ), the terms ( 7/n^2 ), ( 2/n ), and ( 1/n^2 ) approach 0, so the expression simplifies to:frac{2 cdot 3}{2} = 3Therefore, the limit of ( ln(a_n) ) as ( n to infty ) is 3. Exponentiating this result gives the limit of ( a_n ):lim_{n to infty} a_n = e^3Thus, the limit of the sequence is:boxed{e^3}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-516ba452></div><p class="review-content" data-v-516ba452><span class="icon" data-v-516ba452>🔑:</span>## Solutionbegin{aligned}&amp; lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+3}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)^{3 n^{2}-7}=lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+1+2}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)^{3 n^{2}-7}= &amp; =lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(1+frac{2}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)^{3 n^{2}-7}=end{aligned}begin{aligned}&amp; =lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(1+frac{1}{left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}{2}right)}right)^{3 n^{2}-7}= &amp; =lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(1+frac{1}{left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}{2}right)}right)^{left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}{2}right)left(frac{2}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)left(3 n^{2}-7right)}= &amp; =left(lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(1+frac{1}{left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}{2}right)}right)^{left(frac{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}{2}right)}right)^{lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{2}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)left(3 n^{2}-7right)} &amp; ={text { Using the second remarkable limit }}= &amp; =e^{lim _{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{2}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}right)left(3 n^{2}-7right)}=e^{lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{6 n^{2}-14}{2 n^{2}+2 n+1}}= &amp; =e^{lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{frac{1}{n^{2}}left(6 n^{2}-14right)}{frac{1}{n^{2}}left(2 n^{2}+2 n+1right)}}=e^{lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{6-frac{14}{n^{2}}}{2+frac{2}{n}+frac{1}{n^{2}}}}=e^{frac{6-0}{2+0+0}}=e^{3}end{aligned}## Problem Kuznetsov Limits 7-29</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-f1f3de79><span data-v-f1f3de79>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
