Hmm, let&#39;s start by visualizing the problem. First, the square is 4x4, so the total area is 16 square centimeters. We need to divide this into four regions, each with an integer area. Each of these regions must be a rectangle, and the divisions are made by two line segments that are parallel to the sides. That means we can have either horizontal or vertical lines, or one of each. But since it&#39;s two line segments, they could both be horizontal, both vertical, or one horizontal and one vertical. Wait, but the problem says &quot;split into four rectangular regions using two line segments parallel to the sides.&quot; Hmm, so maybe each line segment can be either horizontal or vertical, but two lines in total. Wait, but two lines would split the square into four regions only if they are perpendicular. For example, one horizontal and one vertical. If both lines are horizontal, then they would split the square into three regions, right? Similarly, two vertical lines would split into three regions. So, maybe the problem requires two line segments, which could be in any orientation, but such that they split the square into four regions. Therefore, likely, one horizontal and one vertical line. Let me confirm. If you have two lines, both horizontal, then you have three regions stacked vertically. Similarly, two vertical lines would give three regions side by side. So to have four regions, you need one horizontal and one vertical line. So, the two line segments must be one horizontal and one vertical. That makes sense. So, the square is divided into four smaller rectangles by one horizontal line and one vertical line.Now, each of these four regions must have an integer area. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of positions for the horizontal and vertical lines such that all four resulting rectangles have integer areas.First, let&#39;s consider the horizontal line. Suppose the horizontal line divides the square into a top part and a bottom part. Similarly, the vertical line divides it into a left and right part. Then, the four regions are: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Each of these must have integer areas.Let me denote the coordinates where the lines are drawn. Since the square is 4 cm on each side, the horizontal line can be at some y-coordinate between 0 and 4, and the vertical line can be at some x-coordinate between 0 and 4. However, the lines can&#39;t be at 0 or 4 because then they would be on the edge, and we wouldn&#39;t have four regions. So, the horizontal line must be at some y = a, where 0 &lt; a &lt; 4, and the vertical line must be at some x = b, where 0 &lt; b &lt; 4. Both a and b must be such that the resulting rectangles have integer areas.Let&#39;s denote the horizontal line splits the square into two heights: a and (4 - a). Similarly, the vertical line splits the square into two widths: b and (4 - b). Then, the four regions will have areas:- Top-left: a * b- Top-right: a * (4 - b)- Bottom-left: (4 - a) * b- Bottom-right: (4 - a) * (4 - b)All four of these products must be integers. Since a and b can be any real numbers between 0 and 4, but we need each area to be integer. However, since the original square has integer side lengths, and we&#39;re cutting it at positions a and b, the problem is essentially finding all pairs (a, b) such that a, 4 - a, b, and 4 - b are rational numbers that make the products integers. But wait, maybe a and b must be rational numbers? Because if a and b are irrational, then the products could still be integers only if the irrational parts cancel out, but that&#39;s highly unlikely. So perhaps a and b must be rational. Let&#39;s assume that a and b are rational numbers. However, the problem is presented in terms of integer areas, not necessarily integer dimensions. So, the sides don&#39;t need to be integers, but the areas must be integers.But let&#39;s think in terms of the dimensions. Let me consider a and b as the height and width splits. So, for example, if the horizontal line is at height a, then the top rectangle has height a and the bottom one has height 4 - a. Similarly, vertical line at width b gives left width b and right width 4 - b. Then, all four areas are a*b, a*(4 - b), (4 - a)*b, and (4 - a)*(4 - b). Each of these must be integers.So, the problem is equivalent to finding pairs (a, b) in (0,4) x (0,4) such that:1. a*b is integer,2. a*(4 - b) is integer,3. (4 - a)*b is integer,4. (4 - a)*(4 - b) is integer.Alternatively, since all four areas must be integers, we can note that the sum of the top two areas (a*b + a*(4 - b)) = a*4, which must also be integer. Similarly, the sum of the left two areas (a*b + (4 - a)*b) = 4*b, which must be integer. Therefore, 4*a and 4*b must be integers. Wait, that&#39;s a good point. Because the sum of the top areas is 4a, and the sum of the left areas is 4b. So if all individual areas are integers, then their sums 4a and 4b must also be integers. Therefore, 4a and 4b are integers. Therefore, a and b must be rational numbers with denominators dividing 4. That is, a = k/4 and b = m/4, where k and m are integers between 1 and 15 (since a and b are between 0 and 4). Wait, but 4a is integer, so a must be a multiple of 1/4. Similarly, b must be a multiple of 1/4.So, a can be written as a = k/4 where k is an integer from 1 to 15 (since 0 &lt; a &lt; 4 implies 0 &lt; k &lt; 16, so k=1,...,15). Similarly, b = m/4 where m=1,...,15. However, even if 4a and 4b are integers, the products a*b, a*(4 - b), etc., need not necessarily be integers. For example, if a = 1/4 and b = 1/4, then a*b = 1/16, which is not integer. So, just having 4a and 4b as integers is necessary but not sufficient. Therefore, we need a stronger condition.So, let&#39;s formalize this. Let’s let a = p/4 and b = q/4, where p and q are integers from 1 to 15. Then, 4a = p and 4b = q are integers. Then, the areas are:- Top-left: (p/4)*(q/4) = pq/16- Top-right: (p/4)*(4 - q/4) = p/4*(16 - q)/4 = p(16 - q)/16- Bottom-left: (4 - p/4)*(q/4) = (16 - p)/4 * q/4 = q(16 - p)/16- Bottom-right: (4 - p/4)*(4 - q/4) = (16 - p)/4 * (16 - q)/4 = (16 - p)(16 - q)/16Each of these must be integers. Therefore, pq/16, p(16 - q)/16, q(16 - p)/16, and (16 - p)(16 - q)/16 must all be integers.Therefore, the conditions translate to:1. 16 divides pq,2. 16 divides p(16 - q),3. 16 divides q(16 - p),4. 16 divides (16 - p)(16 - q).Since p and q are integers between 1 and 15, 16 - p and 16 - q are integers between 1 and 15 as well.Let’s analyze the first condition: 16 divides pq. Since p and q are integers between 1 and 15, their product pq can be divisible by 16 only if at least one of p or q is a multiple of 16. But since p and q are less than 16, this is impossible. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong here.Wait, pq must be divisible by 16. Since p and q are integers from 1 to 15, how can their product be divisible by 16? Let&#39;s factor 16: 2^4. So, the product pq must have at least four factors of 2. Since p and q are both less than 16, which is 2^4, the possible factors of 2 in p and q are limited. Let’s consider the prime factorization of p and q. For example, if p is divisible by 2^a and q is divisible by 2^b, then a + b &gt;= 4. Since p and q are between 1 and 15, their possible exponents of 2 are:Possible values for a: 0, 1, 2, 3 (since 8 is 2^3, 16 is too big)Similarly for b: 0, 1, 2, 3.Therefore, to have a + b &gt;= 4, given a, b &lt;= 3.So possible pairs (a, b):(3,1): 3 + 1 = 4(3,2): 5, which is more than 4(3,3): 6Similarly, (2,2): 4(2,3):5(1,3):4So, the pairs where a + b &gt;=4.So, the possible p and q must have factors of 2 such that their exponents add up to at least 4. Therefore, p and q must be such that one is divisible by 8 (2^3) and the other is divisible by 2, or both divisible by 4 (2^2). So, possible cases:Case 1: p is divisible by 8 and q is divisible by 2.Case 2: p is divisible by 2 and q is divisible by 8.Case 3: p and q are both divisible by 4.Similarly, let&#39;s check.If p is divisible by 8, then p can be 8 in 1-15. Similarly, q divisible by 2 can be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14.Similarly, if p divisible by 2 and q divisible by 8.Case 3: p and q both divisible by 4. So p can be 4,8,12 and q can be 4,8,12.However, we need to check if these conditions satisfy all four divisibility requirements. Because even if pq is divisible by 16, the other products p(16 - q), q(16 - p), and (16 - p)(16 - q) must also be divisible by 16.Wait, maybe we need a different approach. Let&#39;s note that all four areas must be integers, so:1. pq/16 must be integer,2. p(16 - q)/16 must be integer,3. q(16 - p)/16 must be integer,4. (16 - p)(16 - q)/16 must be integer.So, each of these terms must be integers. Let&#39;s denote that.Let’s take the first condition: pq divisible by 16.Second condition: p(16 - q) divisible by 16.Third condition: q(16 - p) divisible by 16.Fourth condition: (16 - p)(16 - q) divisible by 16.So, all four products must be divisible by 16.So, for each pair (p, q), we need all four of these divisibility conditions. Let&#39;s see if we can find p and q such that all four products are divisible by 16.Alternatively, maybe we can model this as p and q must be such that both p and q are multiples of 4? Let&#39;s check.Suppose p is 4, 8, or 12 (divisible by 4), and same for q.Then pq is divisible by 16 (since 4*4=16). Then, p(16 - q) is 4*(16 - q). Since q is divisible by 4, 16 - q is 16 - 4k = 4(4 - k), so still divisible by 4. Therefore, p(16 - q) is 4*(4*(4 - k)) = 16*(4 - k), which is divisible by 16. Similarly, q(16 - p) is 4*(16 - p), which is divisible by 16. Finally, (16 - p)(16 - q) is (4*(4 - k))*(4*(4 - m)) = 16*(4 - k)*(4 - m), which is divisible by 16. Therefore, if p and q are both multiples of 4, then all four areas are integers. So, this is one set of solutions.But there could be other solutions where p and q are not both divisible by 4, but still satisfy all four conditions. Let&#39;s check.Suppose p is 8 and q is 2. Then, pq = 16, which is divisible by 16. Then p(16 - q) = 8*14 = 112, which is divisible by 16? 112/16 = 7, which is integer. Then q(16 - p) = 2*8 = 16, which is divisible by 16. Then (16 - p)(16 - q) = 8*14 = 112, which is divisible by 16. So in this case, even though q is 2 (not divisible by 4), all four conditions are satisfied. Therefore, this is another valid solution.Similarly, if p is 2 and q is 8, same result.So, there are solutions where one of p or q is divisible by 8 and the other is divisible by 2.Similarly, let&#39;s check p=8 and q=6. Then pq=48, which is divisible by 16? 48/16=3, yes. p(16 - q)=8*10=80, which is 5*16, so divisible by 16. q(16 - p)=6*8=48, divisible by 16? 48/16=3, yes. (16 - p)(16 - q)=8*10=80, divisible by 16. So this also works. Wait, but q=6 is divisible by 2 but not by 4 or 8. Hmm, but p=8 is divisible by 8. So, perhaps if p is divisible by 8, then q just needs to be even? Let&#39;s check.If p=8 and q is even (i.e., divisible by 2), then:- pq=8*q is divisible by 16 since 8*2=16, so if q is even, 8*q is divisible by 16.- p(16 - q)=8*(16 - q). Since q is even, 16 - q is even, so 8*even=16k, which is divisible by 16.- q(16 - p)=q*(8). Since q is even, 8*q is divisible by 16.- (16 - p)(16 - q)=8*(16 - q). Since 16 - q is even, 8*even=16k, divisible by 16.Therefore, if p is divisible by 8 and q is even, all four areas are integers.Similarly, if q is divisible by 8 and p is even, same thing.Therefore, there are two cases where solutions exist:1. Both p and q are divisible by 4.2. One of p or q is divisible by 8 and the other is divisible by 2.Therefore, the possible values of p and q can be categorized as:Case 1: p ≡ 0 mod 4 and q ≡ 0 mod 4.Case 2: p ≡ 0 mod 8 and q ≡ 0 mod 2.Case 3: p ≡ 0 mod 2 and q ≡ 0 mod 8.But we need to ensure that in Cases 2 and 3, p and q are between 1 and 15. Let&#39;s enumerate the possible values.First, Case 1: p and q divisible by 4. The possible p and q are 4, 8, 12. So 3 choices for p and 3 choices for q. Therefore, 3*3=9 possibilities.Case 2: p divisible by 8 and q divisible by 2. Possible p: 8. Because 16 is excluded (since p &lt;16). So p=8. q can be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14. But wait, in Case 2, q is even but not necessarily divisible by 4. Wait, but if q is divisible by 4, then it&#39;s already covered in Case 1. So, to avoid overlap, maybe in Case 2, q is divisible by 2 but not by 4. Similarly, in Case 3, p is divisible by 2 but not by 4. Wait, but the original division into cases was:- Case 1: both divisible by 4.- Case 2: p divisible by 8 and q divisible by 2 (regardless of q being divisible by 4 or not).But if q is divisible by 4, then that pair (p=8, q=4) would also be in Case 1. So, we have overlapping cases here. Therefore, perhaps we need to adjust.Let’s think of the three cases as:1. Both p and q divisible by 4.2. p divisible by 8 and q even but not divisible by 4.3. q divisible by 8 and p even but not divisible by 4.But then, this would avoid overlaps, but maybe it complicates. Alternatively, accept that some pairs are counted in multiple cases and use inclusion-exclusion.But perhaps an alternative approach is better.Let me try to count all pairs (p, q) where:Either both p and q are divisible by 4,Or p is divisible by 8 and q is even,Or q is divisible by 8 and p is even.But in this case, pairs where both p and q are divisible by 8 would be counted in all three cases. Wait, for example, if p=8 and q=8, then they are in Case 1 (since 8 is divisible by 4) and also in Case 2 and Case 3. So, overlapping. Therefore, to count correctly, we need to use inclusion-exclusion.Let’s formalize:Let A be the set of pairs where p ≡ 0 mod 4 and q ≡ 0 mod 4.B be the set where p ≡ 0 mod 8 and q ≡ 0 mod 2.C be the set where q ≡ 0 mod 8 and p ≡ 0 mod 2.We need |A ∪ B ∪ C|.Using inclusion-exclusion:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.Compute each term.First, |A|: p divisible by 4, q divisible by 4. p can be 4,8,12; q can be 4,8,12. So 3*3=9.|B|: p divisible by 8, q divisible by 2. p can be 8; q can be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14. So 1*7=7.|C|: q divisible by 8, p divisible by 2. Similarly, q can be 8; p can be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14. So 1*7=7.Now, |A ∩ B|: pairs where p ≡ 0 mod 4 and q ≡ 0 mod 4 (so A) and also p ≡ 0 mod 8 and q ≡ 0 mod 2 (so B). But if p is divisible by 8 (which is a subset of divisible by 4) and q is divisible by 2. But since A requires q divisible by 4, then A ∩ B is pairs where p divisible by 8 and q divisible by 4. So p=8; q=4,8,12. So |A ∩ B|=1*3=3.Similarly, |A ∩ C|: pairs where q divisible by 8 (subset of divisible by 4) and p divisible by 2. But A requires p divisible by 4, so p must be divisible by 4 and 2, which is p divisible by 4. But since q is divisible by 8, and p is in A (divisible by 4). So p=4,8,12; q=8. So |A ∩ C|=3*1=3.|B ∩ C|: pairs where p ≡0 mod 8 and q≡0 mod 2 (B) and q≡0 mod 8 and p≡0 mod 2 (C). So p must be divisible by both 8 and 2 (which is p divisible by 8), and q must be divisible by both 2 and 8 (q divisible by 8). So p=8; q=8. So |B ∩ C|=1*1=1.|A ∩ B ∩ C|: pairs where p and q are in all three sets. So p divisible by 8, q divisible by 8. So p=8, q=8. So only 1 pair.Therefore, applying inclusion-exclusion:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = 9 + 7 + 7 - 3 - 3 - 1 + 1 = 9 +7+7=23; 23 -3-3-1=16; 16 +1=17.Wait, 9 +7 +7 = 2323 -3 -3 -1 = 23 -7 =1616 +1=17.Therefore, 17 pairs.But wait, let me double-check:Original |A| =9, |B|=7, |C|=7.Intersections:A∩B=3, A∩C=3, B∩C=1.Intersection of all three is 1.So total is 9+7+7 -3 -3 -1 +1 = 9+7+7=23; 23 -3-3-1=16; 16 +1=17.So 17 pairs (p, q). Each pair corresponds to a unique way of dividing the square? Wait, but p and q are from 1 to 15, with p=4k, etc. But actually, each pair (p, q) corresponds to a unique division. However, since a and b are determined by p and q as a = p/4 and b = q/4, different (p, q) pairs give different positions for the lines. However, some different (p, q) pairs might result in the same division. For example, if p=4 and q=12, versus p=12 and q=4, the divisions are different (the horizontal line is at different positions). Similarly, p=8 and q=2 versus p=2 and q=8. So, unless there is symmetry, each pair is unique.But the problem asks for the number of ways to do this. Since the line segments are distinguishable (one horizontal, one vertical), and their positions are determined by a and b, which are determined by p and q. Therefore, different (p, q) pairs correspond to different ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 17. Wait, but let me verify with examples.Wait, let&#39;s take p=8 and q=2. This gives a=8/4=2 cm, b=2/4=0.5 cm. So horizontal line at 2 cm, vertical line at 0.5 cm. Then the areas are:Top-left: 2*0.5=1 cm²Top-right: 2*(4 -0.5)=7 cm²Bottom-left: (4 -2)*0.5=1 cm²Bottom-right: 2*3.5=7 cm²Wait, but 2*3.5 is 7? Wait, 4 -0.5=3.5. So yes, all areas are integers. Similarly, other pairs.But according to inclusion-exclusion, there are 17 such pairs. However, when I think about the case where both p and q are divisible by 4, we have 3*3=9 pairs. Then, in case where p=8 and q is even (but not divisible by 4), how many pairs are there?Wait, in |B| we considered q divisible by 2, which includes q=4,8,12, which are already in Case 1. So when we subtracted the intersections, we accounted for overlaps. Therefore, the total 17 is the correct count.But let me list them out to be sure.Case 1: p and q divisible by 4. p can be 4,8,12; q can be 4,8,12. So 9 pairs.Case 2: p=8 and q even. q can be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14. But we need to subtract the ones where q is divisible by 4, which are 4,8,12. So 7 -3=4 pairs where q is divisible by 2 but not by 4. Therefore, 4 pairs here: q=2,6,10,14.Similarly, Case 3: q=8 and p even. p=2,4,6,8,10,12,14. Subtract p divisible by 4: 4,8,12. So 4 pairs: p=2,6,10,14.So total in Case 1:9, Case 2:4, Case3:4. But 9+4+4=17. However, when we consider that in Case 2, p=8 and q=2,6,10,14 (4 pairs), and in Case 3, q=8 and p=2,6,10,14 (4 pairs). Additionally, in Case1, we have p=4,8,12 and q=4,8,12. So, for example, p=8 and q=8 is already in Case1.Therefore, total pairs: 9 +4 +4=17. Therefore, 17 different (p,q) pairs. Each pair gives a unique division. Therefore, the answer is 17. However, wait, but let me check for p=8 and q=8. Is that included in Case1? Yes, because p and q are both divisible by 4. So when we count Case2 and Case3, we have overlaps with Case1. But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, we subtracted overlaps, leading to 17. But in the alternative approach where we break into non-overlapping cases, 9 +4 +4=17.But let&#39;s check if all these 17 pairs actually satisfy all four area conditions.Take for example, p=8 and q=2. We saw earlier that all areas are integers. Similarly, p=2 and q=8. Similarly, p=8 and q=6: areas would be (8*6)/16=3, (8*10)/16=5, (6*8)/16=3, (10*8)/16=5. All integers. Similarly, p=8 and q=10: (8*10)/16=5, (8*6)/16=3, (10*8)/16=5, (6*8)/16=3. Similarly for 14. Similarly, p=12 and q=4: areas 12*4/16=3, 12*12/16=9, 4*4/16=1, 12*4/16=3. Wait, (4 - a) where a=12/4=3, so 4 -3=1, so (4 -a)=1. So bottom-left is 1* (q=4/4=1) =1*1=1. Bottom-right is 1*(4 -1)=3. So yes, 1,3,1,3. But 1 and 3 are integers.Wait, so all these pairs seem to work. So, 17 is the total number of such pairs. Therefore, the answer should be 17. But let me check for p=4 and q=4. Areas are 4*4/16=1, 4*12/16=3, 4*4/16=1, 12*12/16=9. Wait, 12*12=144, 144/16=9. So yes, all integers. Similarly, p=4 and q=8: 4*8/16=2, 4*8/16=2, 12*8/16=6, 12*8/16=6. All integers.Therefore, all 17 pairs are valid. Therefore, the number of ways is 17. But wait, before finalizing, let me confirm with another example.Take p=2 and q=8. a=0.5, b=2. Areas: top-left 0.5*2=1, top-right 0.5*(4 -2)=1, bottom-left 3.5*2=7, bottom-right 3.5*2=7. All integers. Correct.Another example: p=6 and q=8. Wait, wait, p=6 is even, q=8. So a=6/4=1.5, b=8/4=2. Areas: top-left=1.5*2=3, top-right=1.5*2=3, bottom-left=2.5*2=5, bottom-right=2.5*2=5. All integers. Correct.Wait, p=6 and q=8 is in Case3 (q divisible by8, p even). So, this is a valid case.But according to our previous count, in Case3, q=8 and p=2,6,10,14. So p=6 is allowed. So, yes, this is counted.Therefore, all 17 pairs are valid, giving 17 different ways. Therefore, the answer is 17. But wait, wait, hold on. The problem says &quot;two line segments parallel to the sides&quot;. Does the orientation of the lines matter? For instance, is a horizontal line at a=2 and vertical line at b=2 considered the same as another configuration if you swap horizontal and vertical? But in the problem statement, since the square is symmetric, swapping horizontal and vertical might result in different regions but perhaps similar configurations. However, the problem counts different arrangements as distinct if the positions of the lines are different. Since the lines are placed at different positions, each (a, b) pair is unique, even if mirrored or rotated. Wait, no, because in the square, rotating would make horizontal lines into vertical lines, but the problem allows both horizontal and vertical lines. So, each split is determined by where you place the horizontal and vertical lines. Therefore, two different pairs (a, b) and (b, a) would result in different splits, unless a = b. But even if a = b, it&#39;s still a unique split. Therefore, all 17 pairs are unique splits. Therefore, the answer is 17.But wait, let me check again. The initial inclusion-exclusion gave 17. Then, breaking into non-overlapping cases gives 9 +4 +4=17. But I need to make sure that there are no duplicates. For example, the pair p=8, q=8 is included in Case1, and also in Case2 and Case3, but we subtracted overlaps. So, in the inclusion-exclusion, it&#39;s counted once. Similarly, other overlaps are handled.Alternatively, think of p and q each ranging from 1 to15, and count all pairs where:Either (p divisible by 4 and q divisible by 4),Or (p divisible by8 and q divisible by2 but not by4),Or (q divisible by8 and p divisible by2 but not by4).Therefore, total:- 3*3=9,- 1*4=4 (p=8, q=2,6,10,14),- 1*4=4 (q=8, p=2,6,10,14),Total 9+4+4=17.Yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the number of ways is 17. However, wait, the answer seems a bit high. Let me check once again with another perspective.Suppose we think of all possible positions for the horizontal and vertical lines. Since the square is 4x4, and the lines must be at integer multiples of 0.25 cm (since p and q are multiples of 1/4 cm). But how does that relate to the areas?Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as tiling the square with four rectangles with integer areas. Each rectangle&#39;s sides must divide the square&#39;s sides into segments. For the horizontal line at a and vertical line at b, we need that a and b are such that a*b, a*(4 -b), etc., are integers.But since we already considered that 4a and 4b must be integers, meaning a and b are multiples of 1/4, then with p=4a and q=4b, we get p and q integers from 1 to15. Then, the four areas being integers is equivalent to pq, p(16 - q), q(16 - p), and (16 - p)(16 - q) all divisible by16. Which leads us back to the same problem.Therefore, I think 17 is the correct answer. However, looking up similar problems, sometimes the answer is 17, but sometimes people might have different interpretations. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says &quot;two line segments parallel to the sides&quot;. So, the two lines are one horizontal and one vertical. Each line is parallel to the sides, so one is horizontal, splitting the square into top and bottom, and one is vertical, splitting into left and right. Therefore, the two lines are perpendicular, intersecting somewhere inside the square, creating four rectangles. So, in this case, the positions of the lines are independent, so the number of ways is the number of valid (a, b) pairs, which we found to be 17.But let me check another resource or example. For instance, in a 2x2 square, similar problem: how many ways to split into four rectangles with integer areas. Following similar logic, the answer would be different. But perhaps in our case, 17 is correct.Alternatively, let me count all possible (p, q) pairs:Case1: p and q divisible by 4: 3*3=9.Case2: p=8 and q=2,6,10,14: 4.Case3: q=8 and p=2,6,10,14:4.Total 17.Yes. So, the answer is 17. Therefore, the number of ways is 17. So, the answer is boxed{17}.Final Answerboxed{17}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of splitting a (4 mathrm{~cm} times 4 mathrm{~cm}) square into four rectangular regions with integer areas using two line segments parallel to the sides, we need to consider the positions of the horizontal and vertical lines. 1. Key Observations:   - The total area of the square is 16 square centimeters.   - Each region must have an integer area.   - The horizontal and vertical line segments divide the square into four regions with areas (a cdot b), (a cdot (4 - b)), ((4 - a) cdot b), and ((4 - a) cdot (4 - b)), where (a) and (b) are the positions of the horizontal and vertical lines, respectively.2. Necessary Conditions:   - The products (a cdot b), (a cdot (4 - b)), ((4 - a) cdot b), and ((4 - a) cdot (4 - b)) must all be integers.   - This implies that (4a) and (4b) must be integers, leading to (a = frac{p}{4}) and (b = frac{q}{4}) where (p) and (q) are integers between 1 and 15.3. Divisibility Requirements:   - The products (pq), (p(16 - q)), (q(16 - p)), and ((16 - p)(16 - q)) must all be divisible by 16.4. Cases Analysis:   - Case 1: Both (p) and (q) are divisible by 4. This gives 3 choices for (p) (4, 8, 12) and 3 choices for (q), resulting in (3 times 3 = 9) pairs.   - Case 2: (p) is divisible by 8 and (q) is even but not divisible by 4. This gives 4 choices for (q) (2, 6, 10, 14) and 1 choice for (p) (8), resulting in (1 times 4 = 4) pairs.   - Case 3: (q) is divisible by 8 and (p) is even but not divisible by 4. This gives 4 choices for (p) (2, 6, 10, 14) and 1 choice for (q) (8), resulting in (1 times 4 = 4) pairs.5. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:   - Considering overlaps and using inclusion-exclusion, the total number of valid pairs ((p, q)) is calculated as (9 + 4 + 4 = 17).Thus, the number of ways to split the square into four regions with integer areas is (boxed{17}).[boxed{17}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to figure out how many ways there are to split a 4 cm by 4 cm square into four rectangular regions using two line segments parallel to the sides, such that each region has an integer area. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.First, the square is 4x4, so the total area is 16 square centimeters. We need to divide this into four regions, each with an integer area. Since the square is being split by two line segments parallel to the sides, I assume that means one horizontal line and one vertical line? Or maybe two horizontal lines or two vertical lines? Wait, the problem says &quot;two line segments parallel to the sides.&quot; So, they could be both horizontal, both vertical, or one of each. But splitting into four regions would require two cuts, so if both are horizontal, they would divide the square into three horizontal strips, but then how do we get four regions? Similarly, two vertical lines would divide into three vertical strips. Wait, maybe one horizontal and one vertical? Then that would divide the square into four regions: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. So maybe that&#39;s the case. The problem says &quot;using two line segments parallel to the sides.&quot; So, if they are both horizontal, then you can&#39;t get four regions. Similarly, both vertical. So maybe they have to be one horizontal and one vertical. Let me confirm.If you have a horizontal line segment and a vertical line segment, intersecting inside the square, that would split the square into four regions. Yes, that makes sense. So, each line is parallel to a side, meaning one is horizontal (parallel to the top and bottom sides) and one is vertical (parallel to the left and right sides). Therefore, the two line segments divide the square into four rectangles. The positions of these lines will determine the areas of each region.We need each of the four regions to have an integer area. Since the total area is 16, each region must have an area between 1 and 16, but since there are four regions, each area must be at least 1, and the sum must be 16. So possible areas could be combinations like 1, 1, 1, 13; but that seems too varied. But we have to think about how the lines divide the square.Let me think: if the vertical line is at position x cm from the left, and the horizontal line is at position y cm from the bottom, then the four regions will have dimensions:Top-left: x by (4 - y)Top-right: (4 - x) by (4 - y)Bottom-left: x by yBottom-right: (4 - x) by yTherefore, the areas would be:Top-left: x*(4 - y)Top-right: (4 - x)*(4 - y)Bottom-left: x*yBottom-right: (4 - x)*yEach of these four areas must be an integer. Since x and y are lengths in centimeters, they can be any real numbers between 0 and 4. But since we need the areas to be integers, and the areas are products of x and y terms, we need x and y such that x*(4 - y), (4 - x)*(4 - y), x*y, and (4 - x)*y are all integers.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s better to model this by considering that x and y must be such that x and y divide the sides into integer areas when multiplied by the corresponding heights or widths. Let me think. For example, if we take the vertical line at x, then the left side is width x, and the right side is width 4 - x. Similarly, the horizontal line at y gives the bottom height y and the top height 4 - y.So, for the areas to be integers:Left-bottom area: x * y must be integer.Left-top area: x * (4 - y) must be integer.Right-bottom area: (4 - x) * y must be integer.Right-top area: (4 - x) * (4 - y) must be integer.Therefore, all four products must be integers. So, x and y must be such that both x and 4 - x divide into lengths that when multiplied by y and 4 - y give integers. Alternatively, maybe x and y must be rational numbers with denominators dividing into the numerators appropriately. Hmm, this seems a bit abstract. Maybe it&#39;s better to model this in terms of possible integer dimensions.Wait, let&#39;s think in terms of x and y. Let me suppose that x and y are rational numbers. Let me express x as a fraction a/b and y as c/d, where a, b, c, d are integers, but since the square is 4 cm, x and y must be between 0 and 4. However, for the products x*y, x*(4 - y), etc., to be integers, perhaps x and y must be such that x and y are both fractions with denominators dividing into 4? Wait, maybe not necessarily, but such that their products with each other and (4 - each other) result in integers. Hmm.Alternatively, suppose that x is a rational number such that x = p/m and 4 - x = q/m, where p + q = 4m. Then, for x*y to be integer, y must be a multiple of m/p, but this seems complicated.Alternatively, think of x as a fraction where x = k/n and y = l/n for some integer n, then compute the areas. But this might not necessarily lead to integer areas unless k, l, and n are chosen appropriately.Alternatively, perhaps x and y must be integers. But if x and y are integers between 1 and 3, then 4 - x and 4 - y are also integers. Then all products x*y, x*(4 - y), (4 - x)*y, and (4 - x)*(4 - y) would be integers. But x and y don&#39;t have to be integers. For example, x could be 2.5 and y could be 1.6, but then the products would be 2.5*1.6 = 4, which is integer, 2.5*(4 - 1.6) = 2.5*2.4 = 6, which is integer, (4 - 2.5)*1.6 = 1.5*1.6 = 2.4, which is not integer. So in this case, not all areas would be integers. Therefore, x and y need not be integers, but their products with each other and with (4 - x) and (4 - y) must be integers.This seems a bit complex. Let me see if there&#39;s a better approach.Let me denote the vertical split at position x (from the left) and horizontal split at position y (from the bottom). Then:Area1 = x * y (bottom-left)Area2 = x * (4 - y) (top-left)Area3 = (4 - x) * y (bottom-right)Area4 = (4 - x) * (4 - y) (top-right)Each of these areas must be an integer. Let me denote:Let a = x, b = 4 - x, c = y, d = 4 - y.Then, the areas are:a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d.Each of these must be integers. So, a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d are integers.Since a + b = 4 and c + d = 4, we have that a and b are positive real numbers summing to 4, and c and d are positive real numbers summing to 4.Given that a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d are integers.From a*c and a*d being integers, we can factor out a:a*(c + d) = a*4 must be an integer. But c + d = 4, so a*4 is integer. Therefore, 4a must be integer. Similarly, from b*c and b*d being integers, same logic:b*(c + d) = b*4 must be integer. Therefore, 4b must be integer. Since a + b = 4, and 4a and 4b are integers, let me set 4a = m and 4b = n, where m and n are integers such that m + n = 16 (since a + b = 4, so 4a + 4b = 16). Therefore, m and n are positive integers summing to 16, so m can range from 1 to 15, and n = 16 - m. So, a = m/4 and b = n/4 = (16 - m)/4 = 4 - m/4.Similarly, looking at c and d. Let&#39;s consider the areas a*c and b*c. From a*c and b*c being integers, then:(a + b)*c = 4*c must be integer. So 4c is integer, let 4c = p, where p is integer between 1 and 15 (since c = p/4 and c &lt; 4). Similarly, 4d = q, where q = 16 - p, so d = q/4.Therefore, c = p/4 and d = q/4, with p + q = 16.Therefore, substituting back:a = m/4, b = (16 - m)/4c = p/4, d = (16 - p)/4Therefore, the areas:a*c = (m/4)*(p/4) = (m*p)/16a*d = (m/4)*((16 - p)/4) = (m*(16 - p))/16b*c = ((16 - m)/4)*(p/4) = ((16 - m)*p)/16b*d = ((16 - m)/4)*((16 - p)/4) = ((16 - m)*(16 - p))/16All of these areas must be integers. So, (m*p)/16, (m*(16 - p))/16, ((16 - m)*p)/16, and ((16 - m)*(16 - p))/16 must all be integers.Since m and p are integers between 1 and 15, and m + p &lt;= 15 + 15 = 30, but since m + p isn&#39;t directly constrained except through the areas. However, for the fractions above to be integers, we need:1. m*p ≡ 0 mod 162. m*(16 - p) ≡ 0 mod 163. (16 - m)*p ≡ 0 mod 164. (16 - m)*(16 - p) ≡ 0 mod 16So, each product must be divisible by 16.Let me analyze each condition:1. m*p divisible by 162. m*(16 - p) divisible by 163. (16 - m)*p divisible by 164. (16 - m)*(16 - p) divisible by 16So, m and p are integers from 1 to 15.Let me note that 16 = 2^4. So, each product must have at least four factors of 2.So, for each product, the exponents of 2 in m and in the other term (p, 16 - p, etc.) must add up to at least 4.Similarly, 16 - p = 16 - p, which is equal to 16 - p. Since p is between 1 and 15, 16 - p is between 1 and 15 as well.So, for each pair (m, p), we need:- m*p divisible by 16- m*(16 - p) divisible by 16- (16 - m)*p divisible by 16- (16 - m)*(16 - p) divisible by 16This is a lot to handle. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.Alternatively, note that if m is even, then 16 - m is also even, and similarly for p.Alternatively, maybe m and p must both be multiples of 8? Let&#39;s check.If m = 8, then 16 - m = 8. If p = 8, then 16 - p = 8. Then:m*p = 64, which is 16*4: divisible by 16.m*(16 - p) = 8*8 = 64, same.(16 - m)*p = 8*8 = 64, same.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 8*8 = 64, same.So, that works. But maybe other m and p can also work.Suppose m = 4 and p = 4.Then:m*p = 16, which is divisible by 16.m*(16 - p) = 4*12 = 48, which is 16*3, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*p = 12*4 = 48, same.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 12*12 = 144, which is 16*9, which is 144, which is divisible by 16? Wait, 16*9 = 144, which is 144/16 = 9, which is integer. Wait, 144 is divisible by 16? Wait, 16*9 = 144, yes. So 144 ÷ 16 = 9, so yes, divisible by 16. Wait, but 144 divided by 16 is 9, which is an integer, so yes. So, m = 4 and p = 4 works.Similarly, m = 12 and p = 12:m*p = 144, divisible by 16.m*(16 - p) = 12*4 = 48, divisible by 16.Similarly, (16 - m)*p = 4*12 = 48, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 4*4 = 16, divisible by 16. So that works.Wait, so m and p can be 4, 8, 12? Let&#39;s see.Wait, m and p need to be such that all four products are divisible by 16.So, for example, m = 8, p = 4:m*p = 32, which is divisible by 16.m*(16 - p) = 8*12 = 96, divisible by 16 (96 ÷ 16 = 6)(16 - m)*p = 8*4 = 32, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 8*12 = 96, divisible by 16. So that works.Similarly, m = 8, p = 12:m*p = 96, divisible by 16.m*(16 - p) = 8*4 = 32, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*p = 8*12 = 96, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 8*4 = 32, divisible by 16. So that works too.Similarly, m = 4, p = 8:m*p = 32, divisible by 16.m*(16 - p) = 4*8 = 32, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*p = 12*8 = 96, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 12*8 = 96, divisible by 16. So that works.Similarly, m = 4, p = 12:m*p = 48, divisible by 16? 48 ÷ 16 = 3, so no. 48 is not divisible by 16. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Let&#39;s check:If m = 4, p = 12:m*p = 4*12 = 48, which is 16*3, which is 48. But 48 ÷ 16 = 3, which is integer. Wait, 48 is divisible by 16? No, 16*3 = 48, but 16 divides 48 exactly 3 times. So yes, it is divisible by 16. Hmm, but 48 ÷ 16 = 3, which is integer. So 48 is divisible by 16. Wait, 16 × 3 = 48. So yes, it&#39;s divisible. So then:m*(16 - p) = 4*4 = 16, divisible by 16.(16 - m)*p = 12*12 = 144, divisible by 16 (144 ÷ 16 = 9, which is integer? Wait, 16 × 9 = 144. Yes, so divisible.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 12*4 = 48, divisible by 16. So, that works.Wait, so m and p can be multiples of 4? Let&#39;s check.Take m = 4 and p = 4: works.m = 4, p = 8: works.m = 4, p = 12: works.Similarly, m = 8, p = 4: works.m = 8, p = 8: works.m = 8, p = 12: works.m = 12, p = 4: works.m = 12, p = 8: works.m = 12, p = 12: works.So, maybe all m and p that are multiples of 4? Let&#39;s check m = 4k, p = 4l, where k and l are integers from 1 to 3 (since m and p are from 1 to 15). So, m can be 4, 8, 12 and p can be 4, 8, 12. So, 3 choices for m and 3 choices for p, leading to 9 possibilities. But wait, earlier when m = 4 and p = 4, that gives a vertical split at x = 4/4 = 1 cm and horizontal split at y = 4/4 = 1 cm, so each region is 1x1, 1x3, 3x1, 3x3, but wait, no. Wait, x = m/4, so m = 4 gives x = 1. Similarly, p = 4 gives y = 1. Then, the areas would be 1*1 = 1, 1*3 = 3, 3*1 = 3, and 3*3 = 9. All integers, so that works.Similarly, m = 4 and p = 8: x = 1, y = 2. Then areas: 1*2 = 2, 1*2 = 2, 3*2 = 6, 3*2 = 6. All integers. That works.Wait, but if m and p are multiples of 4, then x = m/4 and y = p/4, which would be integers. But x and y can be fractions as long as the areas are integers. So, maybe there&#39;s a larger set of possibilities where m and p are such that m*p is divisible by 16, etc.Wait, let me test m = 2 and p = 8. Then:m = 2, p = 8:Check the four products:m*p = 16: 16 is divisible by 16: yes.m*(16 - p) = 2*8 = 16: divisible by 16: yes.(16 - m)*p = 14*8 = 112: 112 ÷ 16 = 7: yes.(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 14*8 = 112: same as above. So, all four products are divisible by 16. So m = 2 and p = 8 works.Similarly, m = 8 and p = 2:Same logic: m*p = 16, etc., all products divisible by 16.Therefore, m and p need not necessarily be multiples of 4. So, my initial thought was incomplete.So, perhaps m and p are such that m and p are such that when multiplied, they give a multiple of 16, and similar for the other products. So, perhaps m and p can be any pair where m and p are such that m and 16 - m divide 16 when multiplied by p and 16 - p. This is getting too vague.Alternatively, perhaps approach this by considering that for all four products to be divisible by 16, the exponents of 2 in m, 16 - m, p, and 16 - p must satisfy certain conditions.Since 16 is 2^4, each of the four products (m*p, m*(16-p), (16-m)*p, (16-m)*(16-p)) must have at least 4 factors of 2.Let me analyze the prime factors.First, note that m and 16 - m are complementary: m + (16 - m) = 16. Similarly for p and 16 - p.Let’s denote:Let v2(n) denote the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of n.Then, for the product m*p to be divisible by 16 = 2^4, we need v2(m) + v2(p) ≥ 4.Similarly:v2(m) + v2(16 - p) ≥ 4v2(16 - m) + v2(p) ≥ 4v2(16 - m) + v2(16 - p) ≥ 4Therefore, we need all four of these inequalities to hold.But m and 16 - m are complementary, as are p and 16 - p.Let’s note that v2(16 - m) is determined by m, and v2(16 - p) is determined by p.This seems complicated. Let me see if there is a pattern.Note that 16 is a power of 2. If m is even, then 16 - m is also even.Similarly, if m is odd, then 16 - m is odd.So, if m is odd, then v2(m) = 0, and v2(16 - m) = 0 (since 16 - m is odd). Then, for the products involving m or 16 - m, we need the other factor to contribute all 4 factors of 2. But if m is odd, then for m*p to be divisible by 16, p must have v2(p) ≥ 4. But p is between 1 and 15, so the maximum p is 15, so the maximum v2(p) is 3 (for p=8). So, if m is odd, then even if p=8 (v2(p)=3), v2(m) + v2(p) = 0 + 3 = 3 &lt; 4. Therefore, m*p would not be divisible by 16. Hence, m cannot be odd. Similarly, p cannot be odd.Therefore, m and p must both be even numbers. Let’s verify this.Suppose m is even. Then, 16 - m is even. Similarly, p is even, so 16 - p is even. Therefore, all four numbers m, 16 - m, p, 16 - p are even. Therefore, each has at least a factor of 2. Let&#39;s denote m = 2m&#39;, p = 2p&#39;, then 16 - m = 2(8 - m&#39;), 16 - p = 2(8 - p&#39;). Then, the products become:m*p = 4m&#39;p&#39;m*(16 - p) = 4m&#39;(8 - p&#39;)(16 - m)*p = 4(8 - m&#39;)p&#39;(16 - m)*(16 - p) = 4(8 - m&#39;)(8 - p&#39;)Each of these products must be divisible by 16. Therefore, each 4m&#39;p&#39;, 4m&#39;(8 - p&#39;), etc., must be divisible by 16. Dividing each by 4, we have:m&#39;p&#39; must be divisible by 4m&#39;(8 - p&#39;) must be divisible by 4(8 - m&#39;)p&#39; must be divisible by 4(8 - m&#39;)(8 - p&#39;) must be divisible by 4Therefore, each of these four terms must be divisible by 4. So, m&#39;, p&#39;, (8 - m&#39;), (8 - p&#39;) are integers from 1 to 7 (since m and p are even numbers from 2 to 14, so m&#39; and p&#39; are from 1 to 7).So, the conditions are:1. m&#39;p&#39; ≡ 0 mod 42. m&#39;(8 - p&#39;) ≡ 0 mod 43. (8 - m&#39;)p&#39; ≡ 0 mod 44. (8 - m&#39;)(8 - p&#39;) ≡ 0 mod 4Again, similar structure as before. Let me analyze these.Since m&#39; and p&#39; are integers from 1 to 7, let&#39;s consider their possible factors.Each term must be divisible by 4. Let&#39;s consider each condition.1. m&#39;p&#39; ≡ 0 mod 4. So, either m&#39; or p&#39; must be divisible by 4, or both m&#39; and p&#39; are even.But since m&#39; and p&#39; are from 1 to 7, if m&#39; is divisible by 4, then m&#39; can be 4. Similarly for p&#39;.Alternatively, if m&#39; is even (but not divisible by 4) and p&#39; is even (but not divisible by 4), then m&#39;p&#39; would be divisible by 4. For example, m&#39; = 2, p&#39; = 2: 2*2 = 4, which is divisible by 4. Similarly, m&#39; = 2, p&#39; = 6: 2*6 = 12, divisible by 4? 12 ÷ 4 = 3, yes. So, 12 is divisible by 4. Wait, 12 is 4*3, so yes. So, even if m&#39; and p&#39; are both even, their product is divisible by 4.Wait, but if m&#39; is even and p&#39; is even, then m&#39;p&#39; is divisible by 4. If one is divisible by 4 and the other is even, then m&#39;p&#39; is divisible by 8. If both are divisible by 4, then m&#39;p&#39; is divisible by 16. So, to satisfy m&#39;p&#39; divisible by 4, we need that m&#39; and p&#39; are not both odd. Either at least one is divisible by 4, or both are even.But since m&#39; and p&#39; are from 1 to 7, possible even m&#39; and p&#39; are 2, 4, 6. So, m&#39; and p&#39; can be 2, 4, 6. So, for m&#39; and p&#39; both even (2, 4, 6), their product is divisible by 4. If one is even and the other is divisible by 4, same. If both are divisible by 4, product divisible by 16. So, for condition 1, m&#39; and p&#39; can&#39;t both be odd. So, m&#39; and p&#39; must be such that at least one is even.Similarly, condition 2: m&#39;(8 - p&#39;) divisible by 4. Let&#39;s see:If m&#39; is even, then 8 - p&#39; can be even or odd. If m&#39; is even, then m&#39;(8 - p&#39;) is even*(8 - p&#39;). For this to be divisible by 4, either m&#39; is divisible by 4, or (8 - p&#39;) is even. Since m&#39; is even, m&#39; = 2,4,6. If m&#39; is divisible by 4 (m&#39; =4), then regardless of (8 - p&#39;), the product will be divisible by 4. If m&#39; is 2 or 6, then (8 - p&#39;) must be even. Since m&#39; is even, if m&#39; is 2 or 6, then (8 - p&#39;) must be even. Therefore, 8 - p&#39; even implies p&#39; even. Therefore, if m&#39; is 2 or 6, then p&#39; must be even. Similarly, for condition 3: (8 - m&#39;)p&#39; divisible by 4.If p&#39; is even, then 8 - m&#39; must be even if p&#39; is 2 or 6 (i.e., even but not divisible by 4). If p&#39; is divisible by 4 (p&#39; =4), then regardless of 8 - m&#39;, the product is divisible by 4.Condition 4: (8 - m&#39;)(8 - p&#39;) divisible by 4.Here, (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are integers. For their product to be divisible by 4, at least one of them must be even. But since m&#39; and p&#39; are between 1 and7, 8 - m&#39; and 8 - p&#39; are between 1 and7. Therefore, 8 - m&#39; and 8 - p&#39; are from 1 to7. For their product to be divisible by 4, at least one of them must be divisible by 4, or both even.But 8 - m&#39; and 8 - p&#39; can be written as:If m&#39; is even, 8 - m&#39; is even if m&#39; is even (since 8 is even). Similarly, 8 - p&#39; is even if p&#39; is even.Wait, if m&#39; is even, then 8 - m&#39; is even. If m&#39; is odd, 8 - m&#39; is odd. Similarly for p&#39;.Therefore, if m&#39; is even, 8 - m&#39; is even. Similarly for p&#39;.Therefore, (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are both even if m&#39; and p&#39; are even. If m&#39; is even and p&#39; is odd, then 8 - m&#39; is even and 8 - p&#39; is odd, so their product is even. Similarly, if m&#39; is odd and p&#39; is even, product is even. If both are odd, product is odd*odd=odd.So, for condition 4: (8 - m&#39;)(8 - p&#39;) divisible by 4.If m&#39; and p&#39; are both even: (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are both even, so their product is divisible by 4.If one is even and the other is odd: (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) would be one even and one odd, so their product is even but not divisible by 4.If both are odd: their product is odd, not divisible by 4.Therefore, to satisfy condition 4, m&#39; and p&#39; must both be even. Because if either is odd, then (8 - m&#39;)*(8 - p&#39;) is either even (if one is even) or odd (if both are odd), but not divisible by 4. Therefore, only when both m&#39; and p&#39; are even does condition 4 hold.Therefore, combining all four conditions:From condition 4, m&#39; and p&#39; must both be even. So, m&#39;, p&#39; ∈ {2,4,6}.Then, with m&#39; and p&#39; even, let&#39;s check the other conditions.Condition 1: m&#39;p&#39; divisible by 4. Since m&#39; and p&#39; are even, m&#39; = 2a, p&#39; = 2b, where a,b ∈ {1,2,3}. Then, m&#39;p&#39; = 4ab, which is divisible by 4. So condition 1 holds.Condition 2: m&#39;(8 - p&#39;) divisible by 4. m&#39; is even, and 8 - p&#39; is even (since p&#39; is even). So, m&#39;(8 - p&#39;) = 2a*(8 - 2b) = 2a*2*(4 - b) = 4a*(4 - b), which is divisible by 4. So condition 2 holds.Similarly, condition 3: (8 - m&#39;)p&#39; divisible by 4. Same logic: (8 - 2a)*2b = 2*(4 - a)*2b = 4b*(4 - a), divisible by 4. So condition 3 holds.Therefore, all four conditions are satisfied if and only if m&#39; and p&#39; are even numbers between 1 and7, i.e., m&#39;, p&#39; ∈ {2,4,6}.Therefore, m&#39; can be 2,4,6 and p&#39; can be 2,4,6. Hence, m = 2m&#39; gives m ∈ {4,8,12} and p = 2p&#39; gives p ∈ {4,8,12}. Therefore, m and p can be 4,8,12. Therefore, there are 3 choices for m and 3 choices for p, leading to 9 possible pairs (m,p).However, wait, but earlier when I considered m=2 and p=8, which corresponds to m&#39;=1 and p=8, but according to this logic, m and p must be multiples of 4,8,12. But no, wait, in the previous step, when we set m&#39; and p&#39; as even numbers (2,4,6), then m = 2m&#39; gives m = 4,8,12, and p = 2p&#39; gives p = 4,8,12. Therefore, m and p can only be 4,8,12. Therefore, the example with m=2 and p=8 would correspond to m&#39;=1 (which is not allowed, since m&#39; must be even). Therefore, our conclusion is that m and p must be 4,8,12. But earlier, when I considered m=2 and p=8, which should not be allowed according to this, but actually, in that case, m=2 and p=8 would correspond to m&#39;=1 and p&#39;=4, but according to the above reasoning, m&#39; and p&#39; must be even. So there is a contradiction here.Wait, I think the confusion comes from the translation between m and m&#39;. Let me double-check.Original substitution: m and p are even numbers between 2 and14 (since m and p must be even, as established earlier). Then, m = 2m&#39;, p = 2p&#39;, where m&#39; and p&#39; are integers from 1 to7. Then, after analyzing, we found that m&#39; and p&#39; must be even (i.e., m&#39; ∈ {2,4,6} and p&#39; ∈ {2,4,6}), leading to m = 4,8,12 and p = 4,8,12.But earlier, I considered m=2 and p=8. However, m=2 would correspond to m&#39;=1, which is odd, which is invalid according to our conclusion. So, that example is actually not allowed because m=2 (m&#39;=1) is odd, which would violate condition 4. Therefore, my previous example was incorrect. Wait, but when I tested m=2 and p=8 earlier, all four products were divisible by 16. Let me check again:If m=2 and p=8:Then, 16 - m =14, 16 - p=8.So:m*p=16, divisible by16: yes.m*(16 - p)=2*8=16, yes.(16 - m)*p=14*8=112, which is 16*7: yes.(16 - m)*(16 - p)=14*8=112: yes.So, all four products are divisible by16. But according to our previous logic, m=2 is even but m&#39;=1 is odd, which should not be allowed. Hence, there is a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Therefore, the conclusion that m&#39; and p&#39; must both be even is incorrect.Therefore, my mistake was in analyzing the conditions. Let&#39;s go back.We had m and p even, which led to m = 2m&#39;, p = 2p&#39;, m&#39;, p&#39; from1 to7.Then, substituting into the four conditions:1. m&#39;p&#39; divisible by4.2. m&#39;(8 - p&#39;) divisible by4.3. (8 - m&#39;)p&#39; divisible by4.4. (8 - m&#39;)(8 - p&#39;) divisible by4.But we concluded that for condition4, since (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) need to multiply to something divisible by4, and since m&#39; and p&#39; are from1 to7, (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are from1 to7. Therefore, for their product to be divisible by4, either one of them is divisible by4, or both are even.But if m&#39; is even, 8 - m&#39; is even (since m&#39; even, 8 - even = even). Similarly, if p&#39; is even, 8 - p&#39; is even.Wait, so if m&#39; is even, 8 - m&#39; is even. If m&#39; is odd, 8 - m&#39; is odd. Similarly for p&#39;.Therefore, (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are both even if and only if m&#39; and p&#39; are both even. If m&#39; and p&#39; are both even, then (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are both even, so their product is divisible by4. If one of m&#39; or p&#39; is odd, then one of (8 - m&#39;) or (8 - p&#39;) is odd, so their product is even (if the other is even) or odd (if the other is odd). So, for their product to be divisible by4, both (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) must be even (i.e., m&#39; and p&#39; even), or one of them divisible by4.Wait, suppose m&#39; is even, p&#39; is odd. Then, 8 - m&#39; is even, 8 - p&#39; is odd. So, their product is even*odd = even, which is divisible by2 but not necessarily by4. Similarly, if m&#39; is odd and p&#39; is even, same.If m&#39; is odd and p&#39; is odd, then (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are odd, so product is odd, not divisible by2.Alternatively, if either (8 - m&#39;) or (8 - p&#39;) is divisible by4, then their product would be divisible by4.So, for condition4, (8 - m&#39;)(8 - p&#39;) divisible by4.Therefore, either:- Both (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are even (i.e., m&#39; and p&#39; even), making their product divisible by4.- Or one of (8 - m&#39;) or (8 - p&#39;) is divisible by4.Similarly, (8 - m&#39;) divisible by4 implies that 8 - m&#39; =4 or 8 - m&#39;=8, but since m&#39; is from1 to7, 8 - m&#39;=4 implies m&#39;=4, and 8 - m&#39;=8 implies m&#39;=0, which is invalid. Therefore, 8 - m&#39;=4 ⇒ m&#39;=4. Similarly, 8 - p&#39;=4 ⇒ p&#39;=4.Therefore, if either m&#39;=4 or p&#39;=4, then (8 - m&#39;) or (8 - p&#39;) is divisible by4, making the product divisible by4.Therefore, condition4 is satisfied if:Either:1. m&#39; and p&#39; are both even (so (8 - m&#39;) and (8 - p&#39;) are both even, product divisible by4).Or,2. m&#39;=4 (so (8 - m&#39;)=4, which is divisible by4) regardless of p&#39;.Or,3. p&#39;=4 (so (8 - p&#39;)=4) regardless of m&#39;.Therefore, condition4 is satisfied in three cases:Case 1: m&#39; and p&#39; both even.Case 2: m&#39;=4.Case 3: p&#39;=4.Therefore, the earlier conclusion was incomplete, only considering Case1. Therefore, m&#39; and p&#39; can be:- Both even (m&#39;,p&#39; ∈ {2,4,6}).- m&#39;=4, p&#39; arbitrary.- p&#39;=4, m&#39; arbitrary.But m&#39; and p&#39; are from1 to7.Therefore, we need to consider all possible pairs where either:1. m&#39; and p&#39; are both even (2,4,6), or2. m&#39;=4, p&#39; can be any from1 to7, or3. p&#39;=4, m&#39; can be any from1 to7.But we also need to satisfy conditions1,2,3.So let&#39;s proceed.First, Case1: m&#39; and p&#39; both even (2,4,6).Then, as before, conditions1-4 are satisfied.Therefore, these pairs are valid. There are 3 choices for m&#39; and 3 for p&#39;, so 9 pairs.Case2: m&#39;=4, p&#39; arbitrary (1-7).Now, check conditions1-3.Condition1: m&#39;p&#39; =4*p&#39; must be divisible by4 ⇒ 4p&#39; divisible by4 ⇒ p&#39; can be any integer (since 4p&#39; is always divisible by4). So, okay.Condition2: m&#39;(8 - p&#39;)=4*(8 - p&#39;) must be divisible by4 ⇒ 4*(8 - p&#39;) divisible by4 ⇒ yes, since 4*(8 - p&#39;) is divisible by4 regardless of p&#39;.Condition3: (8 - m&#39;)p&#39; = (8 -4)*p&#39; =4*p&#39; must be divisible by4 ⇒ same as condition1: okay.Condition4: already satisfied because m&#39;=4.Therefore, when m&#39;=4, p&#39; can be any from1 to7. Similarly, since m&#39;=4 is allowed, and p&#39; can be any from1 to7. However, note that in this case, m=2m&#39;=8, and p=2p&#39;, where p&#39; is from1 to7. So p can be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14. But wait, p=2p&#39;, p&#39; is from1 to7, so p can be 2,4,6,8,10,12,14. But p must be between1 and15, so these are valid. But recall that in our earlier step, we had m and p even, so m=8 (from m&#39;=4) and p even (from p&#39;=1-7 gives p even). So, these are valid.However, we need to ensure that the original four products (m*p etc.) are divisible by16. Wait, in this case, m=8, p=2p&#39;.So, m*p=8*(2p&#39;)=16p&#39;, which is divisible by16.m*(16 - p)=8*(16 - 2p&#39;)=8*(16 -2p&#39;)=128 -16p&#39;, which is divisible by16.(16 - m)*p=(16 -8)*2p&#39;=8*2p&#39;=16p&#39;, divisible by16.(16 - m)*(16 - p)=8*(16 -2p&#39;)=128 -16p&#39;, divisible by16.Therefore, all four areas are integers. So, yes, m&#39;=4 allows p&#39; to be any from1 to7 (i.e., p=2,4,...,14), but since p must be between1 and15, these are valid. Wait, but earlier we had p as even numbers? Wait, no, m and p were even. Wait, no: in this case, m=8 (even) and p=2p&#39;, which is even (since p&#39; is integer). So p is even. So p can be 2,4,...,14. Therefore, there are7 possibilities for p when m&#39;=4. Similarly, when p&#39;=4, m can be 2,4,...,14 (7 possibilities). However, we have to check if these overlap with Case1.For example, if m&#39;=4 and p&#39;=4, then this is included in both Case2 and Case3 and also in Case1 (since 4 is even). So, we need to be careful not to double-count.Therefore, total number of pairs:Case1: 3*3=9 (m&#39;,p&#39; both even).Case2: m&#39;=4, p&#39;=1-7. However, when p&#39; is even (p&#39;=2,4,6), these are already included in Case1. Therefore, unique pairs in Case2 are when p&#39;=1,3,5,7 (odd p&#39;). Similarly, Case3: p&#39;=4, m&#39;=1-7. Unique pairs here are m&#39;=1,3,5,7 (odd m&#39;).Therefore, total number of pairs:Case1:9Case2:4 (p&#39;=1,3,5,7)Case3:4 (m&#39;=1,3,5,7)Total:9+4+4=17.But wait, let&#39;s verify:In Case2: m&#39;=4, p&#39;=1-7. Total7 pairs. But p&#39;=2,4,6 are already in Case1 (since m&#39;=4 is even and p&#39;=2,4,6 are even). Therefore, unique to Case2: p&#39;=1,3,5,7 (4 pairs).Similarly, Case3: p&#39;=4, m&#39;=1-7. Total7 pairs. m&#39;=2,4,6 are in Case1 (since p&#39;=4 is even and m&#39;=2,4,6 are even). Unique to Case3: m&#39;=1,3,5,7 (4 pairs).Therefore, total unique pairs:9 (Case1) +4 (Case2) +4 (Case3) =17.Therefore, there are17 possible (m&#39;,p&#39;) pairs, leading to m=2m&#39; and p=2p&#39; pairs. Each of these corresponds to a different (m,p) pair, hence different (x,y) splits.But wait, but m and p are determined by m&#39; and p&#39; as m=2m&#39;, p=2p&#39;. So, for each of the17 (m&#39;,p&#39;) pairs, we have different (m,p):Case1: m&#39;=2,4,6 and p&#39;=2,4,6: m=4,8,12 and p=4,8,12. So, 3*3=9 pairs.Case2: m&#39;=4 (so m=8) and p&#39;=1,3,5,7 (so p=2,6,10,14). Therefore, m=8, p=2,6,10,14: 4 pairs.Case3: p&#39;=4 (so p=8) and m&#39;=1,3,5,7 (so m=2,6,10,14). Therefore, p=8, m=2,6,10,14:4 pairs.Therefore, total (m,p) pairs are9+4+4=17.However, we need to check whether these pairs lead to distinct splits (x,y). Since x = m/4 and y = p/4. So, for each (m,p), x = m/4, y = p/4.Therefore, for example, in Case1:m=4, p=4: x=1, y=1.m=4, p=8: x=1, y=2.m=4, p=12: x=1, y=3.Similarly for other m and p. In Case2:m=8, p=2: x=2, y=0.5.m=8, p=6: x=2, y=1.5.m=8, p=10: x=2, y=2.5.m=8, p=14: x=2, y=3.5.Similarly, Case3:m=2, p=8: x=0.5, y=2.m=6, p=8: x=1.5, y=2.m=10, p=8: x=2.5, y=2.m=14, p=8: x=3.5, y=2.Therefore, these are all distinct splits, leading to different x and y positions.Therefore, total number of ways is17.Wait, but the answer might be different because some splits could lead to the same configuration. For example, x=1, y=1 and x=3, y=3 might result in congruent regions, but since the problem doesn&#39;t consider rotations or reflections as the same, each distinct x and y is a different way.The problem states &quot;how many ways are there to do this&quot;, and since the line segments are positioned at different x and y, each distinct (x,y) is a different way. Therefore, all17 are distinct.But wait, let&#39;s check the areas for one of the Case2 examples. For example, m=8 (x=2) and p=2 (y=0.5):Areas:Bottom-left:2*0.5=1Top-left:2*(4 -0.5)=2*3.5=7Bottom-right:(4 -2)*0.5=2*0.5=1Top-right:(4 -2)*(4 -0.5)=2*3.5=7So, areas:1,7,1,7. All integers.Similarly, m=8, p=14 (y=3.5):Areas:Bottom-left:8/4*14/4=2*3.5=7Top-left:2*(4 -3.5)=2*0.5=1Bottom-right: (4 -2)*3.5=2*3.5=7Top-right:2*(0.5)=1Same areas:7,1,7,1. So, same as the previous, but mirrored. But since the positions are different, it&#39;s considered a different way.Similarly, m=2 (x=0.5), p=8 (y=2):Areas:Bottom-left:0.5*2=1Top-left:0.5*(4 -2)=0.5*2=1Bottom-right:(4 -0.5)*2=3.5*2=7Top-right:3.5*2=7Same areas:1,1,7,7. Different arrangement.So, all these are distinct in terms of the positions of the lines, hence different ways.But wait, the problem says &quot;using two line segments parallel to the sides&quot;. So, even if the areas are the same but the positions are different, they are considered different. For example, splitting vertically at1 cm and horizontally at1 cm is different from splitting vertically at3 cm and horizontally at3 cm, even though the areas would be same but arranged differently. Since the problem doesn&#39;t specify that configurations that can be rotated or reflected are considered the same, we have to count all distinct positions.Therefore, the total number of ways is17.But let&#39;s check if there are any other possibilities. Earlier, when I thought of m=2 and p=8, which is part of Case3, and that was valid. So, according to this, total is17.But let me verify with another example from Case2. Take m=8 (x=2), p=6 (y=1.5):Areas:Bottom-left:2*1.5=3Top-left:2*(4 -1.5)=2*2.5=5Bottom-right:2*1.5=3Top-right:2*2.5=5All integers:3,5,3,5. Okay.Another example: m=8, p=10 (y=2.5):Areas:Bottom-left:2*2.5=5Top-left:2*(4 -2.5)=2*1.5=3Bottom-right:2*2.5=5Top-right:2*1.5=3Same as before, different arrangement.Similarly, in Case3: m=14 (x=3.5), p=8 (y=2):Areas:Bottom-left:3.5*2=7Top-left:3.5*2=7Bottom-right:0.5*2=1Top-right:0.5*2=1Which is same as another case.Therefore, all these cases are valid and give four regions with integer areas.Hence, the total number of ways is17.However, this contradicts my initial thought of9, but through this detailed analysis, it seems17 is the answer.But to double-check, let&#39;s list all17 possibilities:Case1: m=4,8,12 and p=4,8,12:That&#39;s3x3=9:(4,4), (4,8), (4,12),(8,4), (8,8), (8,12),(12,4), (12,8), (12,12).Case2: m=8, p=2,6,10,14:So, (8,2), (8,6), (8,10), (8,14).Case3: m=2,6,10,14, p=8:So, (2,8), (6,8), (10,8), (14,8).Total:9+4+4=17.But wait, (8,8) is already included in Case1. Similarly, (4,8) is in Case1, and (8,4) is in Case1. So, no overlaps between the cases except for (8,8), which is in Case1. Therefore, the total unique pairs are indeed17.Therefore, the answer is17.However, let me verify with an alternative approach.Alternative approach:Since the vertical and horizontal splits must be such that all four areas are integers, and the splits can be at integer or non-integer positions.But we found that the splits x and y must satisfy that4x and4y are integers (from the earlier substitution where m =4x and p=4y). Wait, no, earlier substitution was m=4x and p=4y? Wait, no:Wait, initial substitution was:a = x, b=4 -x, c=y, d=4 -y.Then, we set4a = m,4b = n,4c = p,4d = q, where m + n =16 and p + q =16.Therefore, x = m/4, y = p/4.Therefore, x and y are rational numbers with denominator dividing4. Therefore, x and y can be expressed as fractions with denominator1,2, or4. That is, x and y can be integers, halves, or quarters.But according to the previous analysis, m and p must be even numbers (from2 to14) leading tox and y being multiples of0.5, or m and p being4,8,12 leading tox and y being integers. But in the17 cases found, x and y are either integers, halves, or in the cases like m=8 and p=14, y=3.5 which is7/2, so multiples of0.5.Wait, but3.5 is7/2, which is a multiple of0.5.Wait, but if x and y are required to be such that their products with (4 -x) and (4 - y) are integers, but x and y can be any real numbers, but we found through substitution that x = m/4 and y = p/4, where m and p satisfy certain divisibility conditions.But according to the analysis, m and p must be even numbers (2-14) with additional conditions, leading to17 possible pairs. However, if x and y must be multiples of0.5, then possible x positions are0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5, and similarly for y. So, x can be from0.5 to3.5 in0.5 increments, and same for y. That&#39;s8 possible positions forx and8 fory, leading to64 possible splits. But obviously, most of these won&#39;t satisfy the integer area condition. However, according to our previous analysis, there are17 valid splits.But let&#39;s check a few of them:x=0.5,y=2: Areas0.5*2=1,0.5*2=1,3.5*2=7,3.5*2=7: works.x=1,y=1: Areas1,3,3,9: works.x=1,y=2: Areas2,2,6,6: works.x=2,y=2: Areas4,4,4,4: works.x=2,y=0.5: Areas1,7,1,7: works.x=2,y=1.5: Areas3,5,3,5: works.x=2,y=2.5: Areas5,3,5,3: works.x=2,y=3.5: Areas7,1,7,1: works.Similarly forx=0.5,y=8/4=2, which isx=0.5,y=2 as above.x=3.5,y=2: similar to x=0.5,y=2 but mirrored.So, all these work, and there are17 such positions. Therefore, the answer should be17.But the problem might have a different answer. Wait, let me check with a different method.Alternative approach:The areas are:A1 =x*y,A2 =x*(4 -y),A3 =(4 -x)*y,A4 =(4 -x)*(4 -y).All must be integers.Given x and y between0 and4.We need to find the number of ordered pairs(x,y) such that all four areas are integers.But since x and y are continuous variables, there could be infinite solutions, but given the problem&#39;s context, likely x and y are rational numbers with limited denominators.But according to our previous analysis, x and y must be multiples of0.5, but even that might not be sufficient.Wait, no, x and y can be fractions. For example, x=1/3 and y=3, then A1=1, A2=1/3*(1)=1/3, which is not integer. So, fractions might not work.But in our earlier analysis, we found that x and y are of the form m/4 and p/4, where m and p satisfy certain conditions.Therefore, x and y are rational numbers with denominator dividing4, i.e., x = k/4, y = l/4, where k and l are integers from1 to15.Then, the four areas are:A1 = (k/4)*(l/4) = kl/16,A2 = (k/4)*(16 - l)/4 = k(16 - l)/16,A3 = (16 - k)/4*(l/4) = (16 - k)l/16,A4 = (16 - k)(16 - l)/16.For all these to be integers, kl, k(16 - l), (16 - k)l, and(16 -k)(16 -l) must be divisible by16.Therefore, kl ≡0 mod16,k(16 - l) ≡0 mod16,(16 -k)l ≡0 mod16,(16 -k)(16 -l) ≡0 mod16.This is the same as the previous analysis with m =k and p =l.Therefore, the number of solutions is the number of pairs(k,l) where1 ≤k,l ≤15 and the four conditions above are satisfied.This is exactly what we analyzed earlier, leading to17 solutions.Therefore, the answer is17.But to confirm, let me check if the total number of possible (k,l) pairs is17.But in the earlier analysis, we had:Case1: k and l multiples of4: k=4,8,12 and l=4,8,12:3x3=9.Case2: k=8 and l=2,6,10,14:4.Case3: l=8 and k=2,6,10,14:4.Total:9+4+4=17.Yes, that&#39;s correct. Therefore, the number of ways is17.However, another perspective: Each split is determined by the vertical positionx and horizontal positiony. Each such split is unique unless x=4 -x ory=4 -y, which would meanx=2 ory=2. But even then, the areas would be symmetric but still count as different.Therefore, the answer should be17.But I recall that in some similar problems, the answer is9 or something else. Let me check with the total number of integer solutions.Alternatively, since each area must be at least1, the possible areas are positive integers such thatA1 +A2 +A3 +A4 =16.But each area is of the formx*y, etc., so the areas are related by:A1 +A2 =x*4,A1 +A3 =y*4,Therefore, x*4 andy*4 must be integers. Hence, x and y must be rational numbers with denominator dividing4.Therefore, x =a/4 andy =b/4, wherea andb are integers from1 to15.Then, A1 = (a/4)(b/4)=ab/16,A2 = (a/4)(4 -b/4)=a(16 -b)/16,A3 = (4 -a/4)(b/4)=b(16 -a)/16,A4 = (4 -a/4)(4 -b/4)= (16 -a)(16 -b)/16.Therefore, similar to before, ab, a(16 -b), b(16 -a), (16 -a)(16 -b) must be multiples of16.Which brings us back to the same conditions. Therefore, the answer is17.Therefore, the final answer isboxed{17}.Final Answerboxed{17}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of splitting a (4 mathrm{~cm} times 4 mathrm{~cm}) square into four rectangular regions with integer areas using two line segments parallel to the sides, we need to consider the positions of the vertical and horizontal line segments. These positions determine the areas of the four regions, which must all be integers.1. Key Insight:   - The vertical line segment is at position (x) cm from the left, and the horizontal line segment is at position (y) cm from the bottom.   - The areas of the four regions are given by:     - Top-left: (x cdot (4 - y))     - Top-right: ((4 - x) cdot (4 - y))     - Bottom-left: (x cdot y)     - Bottom-right: ((4 - x) cdot y)   - Each of these areas must be an integer.2. Substitution and Analysis:   - Let (a = x), (b = 4 - x), (c = y), and (d = 4 - y). The areas become (a cdot c), (a cdot d), (b cdot c), and (b cdot d).   - We need these products to be integers. By analyzing the prime factors and divisibility conditions, we find that (x) and (y) must be such that (4x) and (4y) are integers. This leads to (x = frac{m}{4}) and (y = frac{p}{4}) where (m) and (p) are integers.3. Conditions for Integer Areas:   - The products (m cdot p), (m cdot (16 - p)), ((16 - m) cdot p), and ((16 - m) cdot (16 - p)) must all be divisible by 16.   - This leads to three cases:     1. Both (m) and (p) are even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14).     2. (m = 8) and (p) is an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7).     3. (p = 8) and (m) is an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7).4. Counting Valid Pairs:   - Case 1: (m) and (p) are both even (4, 8, 12) leading to 9 pairs.   - Case 2: (m = 8) and (p) is odd (1, 3, 5, 7) leading to 4 pairs.   - Case 3: (p = 8) and (m) is odd (1, 3, 5, 7) leading to 4 pairs.Summing these cases, we get (9 + 4 + 4 = 17) valid pairs. Each pair corresponds to a unique way to split the square, leading to the final answer:[boxed{17}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ace701f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>🔑:</span>SolutionLet the lengths of the sides of the regions be k mathrm{~cm}, ell mathrm{cm}, a mathrm{~cm} and b mathrm{~cm}, as shown. We know that each of these is less than 4 mathrm{~cm}.Then the regions have areas k a mathrm{~cm}^{2}, k b mathrm{~cm}^{2}, ell a mathrm{~cm}^{2} and ell b mathrm{~cm}^{2} respectively, and thus each of k a, k b, ell a and ell b is an integer.Hence k a+k b=k(a+b)=4 k is an integer, so that k is an integer multiple of frac{1}{4}. Similarly, each of ell, a and b is an integer multiple of frac{1}{4}.However, none of k, ell, a and b is an integer multiple of 4 , because each is between 0 and 4 . Hence each of them has to be an integer multiple of frac{1}{2} in order that each of k a, k b, ell a and ell b is an integer.If both a and k are integersthen clearly all four rectangles have integer area. In this case we have three choices for a(1, 2 and 3 ) and three choices for k (also 1,2 and 3 ), giving 3 times 3=9 choices.If one of a or k is not an integer (that is, an odd multiple of frac{1}{2} )then the other is 2 , otherwise k a is not an integer.

The conditions are that each ai is between 2 and 166, inclusive, and for each i from 1 to 7, the congruence ai^bi ≡ a_{i+1}^2 mod 167 holds. Also, when i=7, a8 is supposed to be a1, so it wraps around. The goal is to compute the minimum possible value of the product b1b2...b7 multiplied by the sum b1 + b2 + ... + b7. First, I need to understand what&#39;s going on here. The modulus is 167, which is a prime number since 167 is not divisible by any primes less than its square root (which is around 12.9). So 167 is prime. That means the multiplicative group modulo 167 is cyclic of order 166. So every element except 0 can be written as some power of a primitive root modulo 167. Given that each ai is between 2 and 166, they are all invertible modulo 167. So each ai can be represented as g^{k_i} for some integer k_i, where g is a primitive root modulo 167. Similarly, a_{i+1} can be written as g^{k_{i+1}}. Then, the congruence ai^{b_i} ≡ a_{i+1}^2 mod 167 translates to (g^{k_i})^{b_i} ≡ (g^{k_{i+1}})^2 mod 167, which simplifies to g^{k_i b_i} ≡ g^{2k_{i+1}}} mod 167. Since g is primitive, the exponents must be congruent mod 166 (since the order of the group is 166). So we get:k_i b_i ≡ 2 k_{i+1} mod 166 for each i from 1 to 7, with k_8 = k_1.So now, the problem reduces to finding exponents k1, k2, ..., k7 and integers b1, ..., b7 such that each k_i is in the range corresponding to ai between 2 and 166 (but since exponents can wrap around modulo 166, maybe k_i can be any integer mod 166 except those corresponding to 0 or 1? Wait, no. Because ai is between 2 and 166, which modulo 167 is equivalent to 1 ≤ ai ≤ 166, but since ai is at least 2, ai is between 2 and 166. However, the multiplicative group modulo 167 includes all residues from 1 to 166. So when ai is represented as g^{k_i}, k_i can be any integer from 0 to 165, but since ai is at least 2, k_i cannot be 0 (since g^0 = 1), so k_i must be between 1 and 165. So each k_i is in 1 to 165, and corresponds to ai = g^{k_i} which is at least 2.So the key equations are:For each i, k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 166.But these are equations in the exponents. So we can think of this as a cyclic system of congruences. The variables are k1, k2, ..., k7 and b1, ..., b7. We need to find such variables where each k_i is between 1 and 165, and each b_i is a positive integer (since they are positive integers, so at least 1), but we need to minimize the product b1...b7 times the sum b1 + ... + b7.But the problem is that we have these cyclic equations. Let&#39;s see. If we can express k_{i+1} in terms of k_i and b_i, then maybe we can find some cyclic condition on the exponents. Let&#39;s write each congruence as:k_{i+1} ≡ (k_i * b_i) / 2 mod 83.Wait, 166 is 2*83, which is prime factors. Hmm. Wait, 166 = 2 * 83, where 83 is prime. So mod 166, but the exponent equation is k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 166. Let me consider splitting this into mod 2 and mod 83.So, the equation k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 2 and mod 83.First, modulo 2: Since 2 is a factor of 166, so mod 2:k_i * b_i ≡ 0 mod 2, because 2 * k_{i+1} ≡ 0 mod 2. So k_i * b_i must be even. Since 2 divides k_i * b_i, which implies that either k_i is even or b_i is even.Similarly, modulo 83: the equation is k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 83.So for each i, we have:1. Either k_i is even or b_i is even (mod 2 condition)2. k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 83But since we have 7 such equations, when we go around the cycle, we need that after 7 steps, the exponent comes back to itself. So starting with k1, we get k2 ≡ (k1 * b1)/2 mod 83, then k3 ≡ (k2 * b2)/2 mod 83, etc., until k8 = k1 ≡ (k7 * b7)/2 mod 83.Therefore, combining all these, we have:k1 ≡ (k7 * b7)/2 mod 83k7 ≡ (k6 * b6)/2 mod 83...k2 ≡ (k1 * b1)/2 mod 83Multiplying all these equations together, perhaps?Wait, let&#39;s consider substituting each equation into the next. For example, k2 ≡ (k1 * b1)/2 mod 83k3 ≡ (k2 * b2)/2 ≡ ((k1 * b1)/2 * b2)/2 ≡ k1 * b1 * b2 / 2^2 mod 83Similarly, k4 ≡ (k3 * b3)/2 ≡ k1 * b1 * b2 * b3 / 2^3 mod 83Continuing this way, after 7 steps, we get:k8 ≡ k1 * b1 * b2 * ... * b7 / 2^7 mod 83But since k8 = k1, we have:k1 ≡ k1 * B / 2^7 mod 83, where B = b1 * b2 * ... * b7Subtracting, we get:k1 (1 - B / 2^7) ≡ 0 mod 83Since 83 is prime, and we can assume k1 is not 0 mod 83 (since k1 is between 1 and 165, so if k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, then k1 = 83, but that would correspond to ai = g^{83}, which is a quadratic residue? Not sure. But regardless, k1 can be any number between 1 and 165, so possibly 0 mod 83. Wait, but 83 is prime, so k1 can be 0 mod 83, but 0 mod 83 would correspond to k1 = 83, since k1 is between 1 and 165. So if k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, then k1 = 83.But let&#39;s see. The equation is k1 (1 - B / 2^7) ≡ 0 mod 83. So either k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, in which case 83 divides k1, or 1 - B / 2^7 ≡ 0 mod 83. So if k1 is not 0 mod 83, then we must have 1 - B / 2^7 ≡ 0 mod 83, which implies B ≡ 2^7 mod 83. Let&#39;s compute 2^7 = 128. Then 128 mod 83 is 128 - 83 = 45. So B ≡ 45 mod 83. Therefore, either k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, or B ≡ 45 mod 83.But since we need this to hold for all ki&#39;s, but the key is that the cyclic product leads to B ≡ 2^7 mod 83, unless some ki ≡ 0 mod 83. However, if k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, then let&#39;s see how that propagates. If k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, then from the equation k1 * b1 ≡ 2 * k2 mod 166. If k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, then k1 is 83 or 166, but since k1 ≤ 165, k1 is 83. Then, 83 * b1 ≡ 2 * k2 mod 166. Let&#39;s compute 83 * b1 mod 166. Since 83 is odd (83 = 2*41 + 1), so 83 * b1 ≡ 83 b1 mod 166. Then 83 b1 ≡ 2 k2 mod 166. So dividing both sides by gcd(83, 166) = 83. Then, this equation reduces to b1 ≡ 2 k2 / 83 mod 2. Wait, 83 and 166: 166 = 2*83. So mod 2, 83 ≡ 1, so 83 b1 ≡ b1 mod 2. Then 2 k2 mod 166 is equivalent to 2 k2 mod 2, which is 0. Therefore, 83 b1 ≡ 0 mod 2. Since 83 is odd, this implies b1 must be even. So if k1 ≡ 0 mod 83, then b1 must be even.But then k2 ≡ (83 * b1)/2 mod 83. Let&#39;s compute (83 * b1)/2 mod 83. Since 83 ≡ 0 mod 83, (0 * b1)/2 ≡ 0 mod 83. So k2 ≡ 0 mod 83. Therefore, k2 is also 83. Then similarly, from k2 = 83, we have that b2 must be even, and k3 = 83, and so on. So all ki would be 83, and all bi must be even. So in this case, each ai = g^{83}, which is a quadratic residue, since (g^{83})^2 = g^{166} ≡ 1 mod 167. So ai = g^{83} is a square root of 1 mod 167, which is either 1 or -1. But since ai is between 2 and 166, ai must be 166, which is -1 mod 167. So all ai would be 166. Then, ai^bi = (-1)^bi ≡ a_{i+1}^2 mod 167. But a_{i+1}^2 is (-1)^2 = 1 mod 167. So (-1)^bi ≡ 1 mod 167, which implies that bi must be even. Therefore, all bi are even, and each ai is 166. So this is a possible solution.In this case, all bi are even, so the product b1...b7 is at least 2^7 = 128, and the sum is at least 7*2 = 14, so the product times the sum is at least 128 * 14 = 1792. However, we might be able to find a lower value if we don&#39;t have all ki ≡ 0 mod 83.Alternatively, if none of the ki ≡ 0 mod 83, then we must have B ≡ 45 mod 83. So B = 45 + 83*t for some integer t. Since each bi is a positive integer, B is at least 1^7 = 1. The minimal B satisfying B ≡ 45 mod 83 is 45 if 45 ≥ 1, which it is. So B could be 45, but we need to check if it&#39;s possible to have b1*b2*...*b7 = 45 with each bi such that when multiplied together, they equal 45, and also satisfy the cyclic conditions.But 45 factors into integers in different ways. Since we have 7 factors (b1 to b7), each at least 1, but they have to multiply to 45. The prime factors of 45 are 3^2 * 5. So we need to distribute these prime factors among 7 numbers. The minimal product is achieved when we have the factors as small as possible. So possible factorizations could be 45 = 1*1*1*1*1*3*15, but the product of these is 45, and the sum would be 1+1+1+1+1+3+15=23. Then the product times sum is 45*23=1035. Alternatively, maybe a better factorization. For example, 45=3*3*5*1*1*1*1, product 45, sum 3+3+5+1+1+1+1=15, so product times sum is 45*15=675. Even better. Or maybe 5*3*3*1*1*1*1, same thing. Alternatively, 3*3*5*1*1*1*1. The sum is 3+3+5=11 plus 4 ones, total 15. So that&#39;s better than 23. Alternatively, if we can have exponents with higher multiplicities. Wait, but 45 is 3^2*5, so perhaps if we can split 45 into 3,3,5,1,1,1,1. That gives sum 15. Alternatively, can we do 9,5,1,... but 9*5=45, rest 1s. Then sum is 9+5+5*1=9+5=14? Wait, 9+5+1+1+1+1+1=19. So that&#39;s worse. So 3,3,5,1,... seems better.Alternatively, if we use 5,3,3,1,... with sum 15, which gives 45*15=675. But maybe we can get even smaller? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we can have some exponents larger than 1 but overlapping factors. But since 45 is 3^2*5, we can&#39;t really make more factors. So the minimal sum is 15 when distributing as 3,3,5, and the rest 1s. So 15 is the minimal sum for the product 45. Thus, the product times sum would be 45*15=675.But we need to check if such a factorization is possible given the constraints of the problem. That is, with these bi&#39;s, does there exist exponents ki such that the congruences hold?Alternatively, maybe the minimal B is 45, but we need to verify if such bi&#39;s and ki&#39;s can exist.Alternatively, perhaps even if B=45, the sum could be lower. Wait, but the sum of 7 numbers multiplying to 45, with each number at least 1. The minimal sum is achieved when the numbers are as equal as possible. For 45, with 7 numbers, but 45 is 3^2*5. So distributing the factors as evenly as possible. The closest is 3,3,5,1,1,1,1. Sum 15. If you try to make numbers more equal, like 5,3,3,1,1,1,1, same sum. There&#39;s no way to get the factors smaller than 3,3,5 without introducing fractions. So 15 seems minimal. Therefore, 45*15=675. However, we need to check if this is achievable in the context of the problem.But before jumping to conclusions, let&#39;s analyze the problem in more depth. The key is that each bi must satisfy the congruence k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 166. However, since we split into mod 2 and mod 83, we have for each i:- If we are in the case where none of the ki are 0 mod 83, then B = b1*b2*...*b7 ≡ 45 mod 83, and also each k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 2 and mod 83.But maybe the bi&#39;s have to satisfy some other conditions. For example, considering the equations modulo 2. For each i, either k_i is even or b_i is even.If we can set all k_i odd, then all b_i must be even. But that would make the product B = product of b_i&#39;s even^7, which is at least 2^7 = 128, which is larger than 45. So in that case, B would be 128, but 128 mod 83 is 128 - 83 = 45. So 128 ≡ 45 mod 83. So in that case, B=128 would satisfy the condition B ≡ 45 mod 83. Wait, but B is 128. But earlier, we thought that if we have ki all odd, then all bi must be even. So B would be at least 2^7 = 128, which is congruent to 45 mod 83. So this is a possible scenario. So in this case, if all ki are odd, then all bi must be even. Then B=128, which satisfies B ≡ 45 mod 83, and the product times sum is 128*(2*7) = 128*14=1792. However, in the previous case where B=45, but that would require some bi&#39;s to be odd, which would require that some ki&#39;s are even. However, if some ki are even, then the corresponding bi can be odd. Let&#39;s see.So let&#39;s consider two cases:1. All ki ≡ 0 mod 83. Then as discussed earlier, all ai=166, all bi even, product=128, sum=14, total=1792.2. None of the ki ≡ 0 mod 83. Then B ≡ 45 mod 83, which could be 45, 128, 211, etc. Since 45 is smaller, perhaps 45 is possible. But need to check if 45 can be achieved. But how can B=45? Let&#39;s see. If we set B=45, which is 45 mod 83. Then, each bi must be a factor in 45. So the bi&#39;s are factors of 45, but multiplied together equal 45, with 7 factors. As before, that would be 3,3,5,1,1,1,1. So two 3&#39;s, one 5, and four 1&#39;s. However, the 1&#39;s might be a problem. Because if bi=1, then the congruence for that i becomes k_i * 1 ≡ 2 k_{i+1} mod 166, which means k_i ≡ 2 k_{i+1} mod 166. So k_{i+1} ≡ k_i / 2 mod 83. Wait, but k_i must be even for k_{i+1} to be integer. Because if bi=1, then k_i must be even, since k_i ≡ 2 k_{i+1} mod 166. So k_i must be even, so that 2 divides k_i. Therefore, if we have bi=1, then ki must be even. But in the case where we have some bi=1, the corresponding ki must be even, which allows ki to be even, and thus bi=1 can be allowed.So in the case of B=45 with some bi=1, we have that for each bi=1, ki must be even. However, for other bi&#39;s (3,3,5), we can have ki even or odd, but if bi is odd, then ki must be even. Wait, no. The condition is that for each i, either ki is even or bi is even. So if bi is odd, then ki must be even. Therefore, for the bi&#39;s that are odd (3,3,5), the corresponding ki must be even. For the bi&#39;s that are 1 (which is odd), the ki must also be even. Wait, bi=1 is odd, so ki must be even. Similarly, bi=3,5 are odd, so ki must be even. Therefore, in this case, all ki&#39;s corresponding to odd bi&#39;s must be even. The only bi&#39;s that are even would allow ki&#39;s to be odd. But in the case of B=45, all bi&#39;s are odd (since 45 is odd, product of odd numbers is odd), so all bi&#39;s are odd, which would require all ki&#39;s to be even. Therefore, all ki&#39;s must be even. So each ki is even. Then, let&#39;s see.If all ki are even, then we can write ki = 2 ci, where ci is an integer. Then, substituting into the equation:ki * bi ≡ 2 k_{i+1} mod 166So 2 ci * bi ≡ 2 * 2 c_{i+1} mod 166Divide both sides by 2:ci * bi ≡ 2 c_{i+1} mod 83So now we have a similar system, but modulo 83, with ci instead of ki.Then, following the same logic as before, after 7 steps:c1 ≡ c1 * B / 2^7 mod 83Which gives c1 (1 - B / 128) ≡ 0 mod 83Since 128 ≡ 45 mod 83, as 128 - 83 = 45. So 1 - B / 128 ≡ 1 - B / 45 mod 83? Wait, no. Wait, B is 45, so 45 / 128 mod 83. Wait, but this is getting confusing. Let me think again.We have:After substituting ki = 2 ci, the equation becomes ci * bi ≡ 2 c_{i+1} mod 83.Then, similar to before, combining all 7 equations:c1 ≡ (c7 * b7) / 2 mod 83c7 ≡ (c6 * b6) / 2 mod 83...c2 ≡ (c1 * b1) / 2 mod 83Multiplying all these together, after substitution:c1 ≡ c1 * (b1 b2 ... b7) / 2^7 mod 83So c1 * (1 - B / 128) ≡ 0 mod 83Since B = 45, which is the product of the bi&#39;s. Then:1 - 45 / 128 ≡ 0 mod 83?Wait, 45 / 128 mod 83. To compute 45 / 128 mod 83, first find the inverse of 128 mod 83.128 mod 83 is 128 - 83 = 45. So 45^{-1} mod 83. Since 45 and 83 are coprime, we can find the inverse. Let&#39;s compute it.Find x such that 45x ≡ 1 mod 83.Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:83 = 1*45 + 3845 = 1*38 + 738 = 5*7 + 37 = 2*3 + 13 = 3*1 + 0Backwards:1 = 7 - 2*3But 3 = 38 - 5*7, so:1 = 7 - 2*(38 - 5*7) = 11*7 - 2*38But 7 = 45 - 1*38, so:1 = 11*(45 - 38) - 2*38 = 11*45 - 13*38But 38 = 83 - 45, so:1 = 11*45 -13*(83 -45) = 24*45 -13*83Therefore, 45^{-1} mod 83 is 24. So 45 * 24 = 1080. 1080 mod 83: 83*13=1079, so 1080 ≡1 mod83. Correct.So 45 / 128 ≡ 45 * (128)^{-1} ≡ 45 * 45^{-1} ≡ 1 mod 83. Wait, 128 ≡45 mod83, so 128^{-1} ≡45^{-1}≡24 mod83. Therefore, 45 *24 ≡1 mod83. So 45/128 ≡1 mod83. Therefore, 1 - 45 /128 ≡1 -1=0 mod83. Therefore, the equation becomes c1*0 ≡0 mod83, which is always true. Therefore, there is no restriction on c1. Therefore, as long as B=45 and all bi&#39;s are odd (which requires all ki&#39;s to be even, leading to ci&#39;s being integers), we can find such ci&#39;s. So it&#39;s possible.Therefore, in this case, B=45, which is achievable with bi&#39;s 3,3,5,1,1,1,1 and sum 15. Thus, the product times the sum is 45*15=675. But wait, we need to check if such a configuration actually works. That is, can we assign the bi&#39;s as 3,3,5,1,1,1,1 in some order and find exponents ci&#39;s that satisfy the equations ci * bi ≡2 c_{i+1} mod83.Given that the system is cyclic, the order might matter. Let&#39;s see. Suppose we have one bi=5, two bi=3, and four bi=1. Let&#39;s arrange them in a cycle. Let&#39;s assign b1=5, b2=3, b3=3, and b4 to b7=1. Then, starting with some c1, we can compute c2, c3, etc., and check if it cycles back.But since it&#39;s a bit complex, maybe there&#39;s a better approach. Let&#39;s note that when bi=1, the equation becomes ci *1 ≡2 c_{i+1} mod83, so ci ≡2 c_{i+1} mod83. Therefore, c_{i+1} ≡ci * 1/2 mod83. Since 2^{-1} mod83 is 42 (since 2*42=84≡1 mod83). Therefore, c_{i+1} ≡ci *42 mod83.Similarly, when bi=3, the equation is ci*3 ≡2 c_{i+1} mod83, so c_{i+1} ≡ (3/2) ci ≡3*42 ci=126 ci mod83. 126 mod83 is 126-83=43. So c_{i+1}≡43 ci mod83.When bi=5, the equation is ci*5 ≡2 c_{i+1} mod83, so c_{i+1}≡(5/2) ci ≡5*42 ci=210 ci mod83. 210 mod83: 83*2=166, 210-166=44, so c_{i+1}≡44 ci mod83.Therefore, each bi corresponds to a multiplier:- bi=1: multiplier=42- bi=3: multiplier=43- bi=5: multiplier=44So the overall transformation after 7 steps is a product of these multipliers. To have the cycle close, the product of the multipliers must be ≡1 mod83.So let&#39;s compute the product of the multipliers corresponding to the bi&#39;s. In our case, we have bi=5,3,3,1,1,1,1. So the multipliers are 44,43,43,42,42,42,42. The product is 44 *43 *43 *42^4 mod83.Let&#39;s compute this step by step.First, compute 42 mod83=42.42^2=1764. 1764 divided by83: 83*21=1743, 1764-1743=21. So 42^2≡21 mod83.42^4=(42^2)^2≡21^2=441. 441-5*83=441-415=26 mod83.42^4≡26 mod83.Now, compute 43*43 mod83. 43^2=1849. 1849 divided by83: 83*22=1826, 1849-1826=23. So 43^2≡23 mod83.Then, 44*43*43=44*23. Compute 44*23=1012. 1012 mod83: 83*12=996, 1012-996=16. So 44*43*43≡16 mod83.Now multiply by 42^4≡26: 16*26=416. 416 mod83: 83*5=415, 416-415=1. So total product≡1 mod83.Wow, that&#39;s convenient. Therefore, if we arrange the multipliers in the order 44,43,43,42,42,42,42, the product is 1 mod83. Therefore, starting with any c1, after applying these multipliers, we get back to c1. Therefore, such a configuration is possible. Therefore, we can choose c1=1, then compute the other ci&#39;s:Let&#39;s go through the steps. Let&#39;s set c1=1.b1=5: c2≡44*c1=44*1=44 mod83.b2=3: c3≡43*c2=43*44. Compute 43*44=1892. 1892 mod83: 83*22=1826, 1892-1826=66. So c3≡66 mod83.b3=3: c4≡43*c3=43*66. 43*60=2580, 43*6=258, total 2580+258=2838. 2838 mod83: 83*34=2822, 2838-2822=16. So c4≡16 mod83.b4=1: c5≡42*c4=42*16=672. 672 mod83: 83*8=664, 672-664=8. So c5≡8 mod83.b5=1: c6≡42*c5=42*8=336. 336 mod83: 83*4=332, 336-332=4. So c6≡4 mod83.b6=1: c7≡42*c6=42*4=168. 168 mod83=168-2*83=168-166=2. So c7≡2 mod83.b7=1: c8≡42*c7=42*2=84≡84-83=1 mod83. So c8≡1 mod83, which is equal to c1. Therefore, the cycle closes. Therefore, this works!Therefore, the configuration with bi&#39;s [5,3,3,1,1,1,1] gives a valid solution with product 5*3*3*1*1*1*1=45 and sum 5+3+3+1+1+1+1=15, so product times sum is 45*15=675. Therefore, this is a valid solution.Now, comparing with the previous case where all ai=166 and bi=2, product=128, sum=14, total=1792. So 675 is lower. Therefore, 675 is a better solution.But wait, can we do even better? Let&#39;s see. For B=45, sum=15 gives 675. Is there a way to get B=45 with a lower sum? For example, if we can find a factorization of 45 into 7 factors with a smaller sum. But as we saw earlier, the minimal sum is 15. Because 45 factors into primes as 3^2*5. To distribute these into 7 factors with each at least 1, the minimal sum is achieved by having the factors as close as possible. So 3,3,5,1,1,1,1 sums to 15. Any other factorization would have a larger sum. For example, 5,3,3,1,1,1,1 is the same. If we tried to use larger factors, like 9,5,1,... the sum increases. So 15 seems minimal.But let&#39;s verify. Suppose we try another factorization: 15,3,1,1,1,1,1. The product is 15*3=45. The sum is 15+3+5*1=18. That&#39;s higher than 15. So worse.Alternatively, 5,3,3,1,1,1,1 is the same as before. So 15 is indeed minimal.Therefore, 675 is the minimal value in this case.But wait, is there a B less than 45 that is ≡45 mod83? For example, B=45-83= -38, but since B must be positive, the next possible lower B would be 45-83= -38, which is invalid. So the minimal positive B is 45. Therefore, B=45 is the minimal possible product.Therefore, the minimal value is 675.But before finalizing, let&#39;s check if there are any other configurations with B=45 but different bi arrangements that might result in a smaller sum. However, given the factorization constraints, it seems 15 is the minimal sum.Alternatively, is there a way to have some bi=1 and others larger, but with a smaller sum? For example, if we have more bi=1&#39;s but the non-1 bi&#39;s are smaller. But 45&#39;s prime factors are 3,3,5. So we can&#39;t make them smaller than 3. Hence, the minimal non-1 factors are 3 and 5. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed 15.Therefore, the minimal possible value is 675.But let&#39;s confirm that in this configuration, the ki&#39;s are within the required range. Recall that ki=2 ci, and ci&#39;s are computed as follows:c1=1, so k1=2*1=2.c2=44, so k2=2*44=88.c3=66, so k3=2*66=132.c4=16, k4=2*16=32.c5=8, k5=2*8=16.c6=4, k6=2*4=8.c7=2, k7=2*2=4.All these ki&#39;s are between 2 and 165, which is good. Then, the ai&#39;s are g^{ki} mod167. Since g is a primitive root, these are distinct elements, but since we only need them to be between 2 and 166, which they are, as ki ranges from 2 to 132, which are all exponents corresponding to elements from g^2 up to g^{132}. Since 167 is prime, g^{132} is not 1, so it&#39;s within the range. Therefore, all ai&#39;s are valid.Therefore, this configuration works, and the minimal value is 675.But to ensure there isn&#39;t a lower value, let&#39;s consider another case where B=45 +83=128. Then, the product is 128, sum could be lower? Wait, if B=128, which is 2^7, so all bi=2, sum=14, product*sum=128*14=1792, which is higher than 675. So worse. Alternatively, B=45 +83*2=211. Product=211, which is prime, so sum=211 +1*6=217. 211*217 is way larger. So no, 675 is better.Another case: if some ki=0 mod83. As we saw earlier, if one ki=83, then all must be 83, leading to bi even, product=128, sum=14, total=1792, which is worse.Therefore, 675 is indeed the minimal possible value.Final Answerboxed{675}&lt;/think&gt;Given positive integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7, b_1, b_2, ldots, b_7) such that (2 leq a_i leq 166) and (a_i^{b_i} equiv a_{i+1}^2 pmod{167}) for each (1 leq i leq 7) (where (a_8 = a_1)), we need to compute the minimum possible value of (b_1b_2 cdots b_7(b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7)).1. Primitive Root and Exponents:   - Since 167 is a prime number, the multiplicative group modulo 167 is cyclic of order 166. Let (g) be a primitive root modulo 167.   - Each (a_i) can be written as (g^{k_i}) for some integer (k_i) (mod 166). The congruence (a_i^{b_i} equiv a_{i+1}^2 pmod{167}) translates to (k_i b_i equiv 2k_{i+1} pmod{166}).2. Modular Equations:   - The equations (k_i b_i equiv 2k_{i+1} pmod{166}) must hold for all (i). This splits into modulo 2 and modulo 83 conditions:     - Modulo 2: (k_i b_i equiv 0 pmod{2}), implying either (k_i) is even or (b_i) is even.     - Modulo 83: (k_i b_i equiv 2k_{i+1} pmod{83}).3. Cyclic System:   - Combining the equations modulo 83 for all (i), we get (k_1 equiv k_1 cdot frac{b_1 b_2 cdots b_7}{2^7} pmod{83}). This simplifies to (b_1 b_2 cdots b_7 equiv 2^7 equiv 45 pmod{83}).4. Minimizing the Product and Sum:   - The product (B = b_1 b_2 cdots b_7) must be congruent to 45 modulo 83. The smallest positive (B) is 45.   - Factorizing 45 into 7 integers, the minimal sum is achieved with factors 3, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, giving a sum of 15.5. Verification:   - The configuration (b_i = [5, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]) results in a valid cyclic system with exponents (k_i) within the required range. The product is 45 and the sum is 15, leading to (45 times 15 = 675).Thus, the minimum possible value of (b_1b_2 cdots b_7(b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7)) is (boxed{675}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here with these positive integers a₁, a₂, ..., a₇ and b₁, b₂, ..., b₇. The conditions are that each a_i is between 2 and 166 inclusive, and for each i from 1 to 7, the congruence a_i^{b_i} ≡ a_{i+1}² mod 167 holds, where a₈ is a₁. The goal is to compute the minimum possible value of the product b₁b₂...b₇ multiplied by the sum b₁ + b₂ + ... + b₇. First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It seems like we have a cyclic system of congruences modulo 167, which is a prime number because 167 is a prime (I remember that 160 is 16*10, so 167 is between 160 and 170, and since it&#39;s not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13—maybe 13*12 is 156, 13*13 is 169, which is over, so yes, 167 is prime). So mod 167 is a field, which might be helpful.Each a_i is in the range 2 to 166, so they are all non-zero modulo 167. Since 167 is prime, the multiplicative group modulo 167 is cyclic of order 166. That might be key here. So every non-zero element modulo 167 can be written as a power of some primitive root g. Let&#39;s denote the multiplicative group as G = (ℤ/167ℤ)^*, which is cyclic of order 166. Therefore, for each a_i, we can write a_i ≡ g^{k_i} mod 167 for some integer k_i between 0 and 165.Given that, the congruence a_i^{b_i} ≡ a_{i+1}² mod 167 translates to (g^{k_i})^{b_i} ≡ g^{2k_{i+1}} mod 167. Since g is a primitive root, exponents work modulo 166 (the order of the group). So this gives us the equation:k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 166for each i from 1 to 7. Since it&#39;s cyclic, after i=7, we go back to i=1, so k₈ = k₁.So we have a system of 7 equations:1. k₁b₁ ≡ 2k₂ mod 1662. k₂b₂ ≡ 2k₃ mod 1663. k₃b₃ ≡ 2k₄ mod 1664. k₄b₄ ≡ 2k₅ mod 1665. k₅b₅ ≡ 2k₆ mod 1666. k₆b₆ ≡ 2k₇ mod 1667. k₇b₇ ≡ 2k₁ mod 166Our variables here are the k_i and b_i. But the a_i are between 2 and 166, so the k_i must be such that g^{k_i} is at least 2. However, since g is a primitive root, its powers generate all residues from 1 to 166. So technically, each k_i can be any integer from 0 to 165, but a_i = g^{k_i} mod 167 must be at least 2. But since g^0 = 1 mod 167, which is excluded (since a_i ≥ 2), so k_i must be between 1 and 165. Therefore, each k_i is in [1, 165].But we need to find the minimal value of the product of the b_i multiplied by their sum. So we need to find integers b_i ≥ 1 (since they are positive integers) and k_i in [1, 165] such that the above congruences hold, and then compute the minimal value of (b₁b₂...b₇)(b₁ + b₂ + ... + b₇).To minimize this expression, we need to minimize both the product and the sum. Since the product is multiplied by the sum, we need a balance between making the b_i small and keeping their sum small as well. However, since the product tends to grow faster, it&#39;s likely that the minimal value occurs when all the b_i are as small as possible, but subject to the congruence conditions.Let me think about the system of congruences. Let&#39;s try to solve for the k_i in terms of k₁. Suppose we chain the equations together. Let&#39;s start with the first equation:k₁b₁ ≡ 2k₂ mod 166 ⇒ k₂ ≡ (k₁b₁)/2 mod 83 (since 2 and 166 have gcd 2, so dividing both sides by 2 gives modulo 83). Wait, perhaps it&#39;s better to express each subsequent k_i in terms of the previous.Alternatively, if we multiply all the congruences together. Let&#39;s see:From each equation:k_i b_i ≡ 2k_{i+1} mod 166Multiply all 7 equations together:(k₁k₂...k₇)(b₁b₂...b₇) ≡ 2^7 k₂k₃...k₈ mod 166^7But since k₈ = k₁, this becomes:(k₁k₂...k₇)(b₁b₂...b₇) ≡ 2^7 k₁k₂...k₇ mod 166^7Assuming that k₁k₂...k₇ is invertible modulo 166^7, which it is if each k_i is coprime to 166. However, 166 factors as 2*83. So if any k_i is even or divisible by 83, then k₁k₂...k₇ might not be invertible. But since k_i are between 1 and 165, they can be even or odd, and might be divisible by 83. But maybe we can cancel out the k_i terms.Dividing both sides by k₁k₂...k₇ (assuming they are coprime to 166), we get:b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 2^7 mod 166But 166 is 2*83, so modulus 166, 2^7 = 128. Therefore, b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 128 mod 166. But since the b_i are positive integers, the product is at least 1^7 = 1, but modulo 166, it&#39;s 128. Therefore, the minimal possible product is 128 + 166*t for some integer t ≥ 0. The minimal possible product would be 128 if that&#39;s achievable with all b_i satisfying the individual congruences.Wait, but 128 is 2^7, so perhaps the product of the b_i is 128? But 128 is 2^7, so if each b_i is 2, the product would be 2^7 = 128. Hmm. Maybe that&#39;s possible. Let&#39;s check.If each b_i = 2, then we would have:k_i * 2 ≡ 2k_{i+1} mod 166 ⇒ k_i ≡ k_{i+1} mod 83, because dividing both sides by 2 (since 2 and 166 have gcd 2, so modulus becomes 83). Therefore, k_{i+1} ≡ k_i mod 83. So if we set k_{i+1} = k_i + 83*m_i for some integer m_i. But since k_i and k_{i+1} are between 1 and 165, the only possible values are k_{i+1} = k_i or k_i ± 83.But since we need this to cycle back after 7 steps, starting from k₁, we have k₁ ≡ k₂ ≡ ... ≡ k₇ ≡ k₁ mod 83. Therefore, all k_i must be congruent modulo 83. Let&#39;s suppose that all k_i ≡ c mod 83 for some c. So each k_i = c + 83*d_i, where d_i is 0 or 1, since k_i ≤ 165. Because 83*2 = 166, which is beyond 165, so d_i can be 0 or 1. Therefore, each k_i is either c or c + 83.But we need to ensure that when we go through each step, k_{i+1} = (k_i * b_i)/2 mod 83. Wait, if b_i = 2, then k_{i+1} ≡ k_i mod 83. So if we start with k₁ = c + 83*d₁, then k₂ ≡ k₁ mod 83, so k₂ is c + 83*d₂, where d₂ can be 0 or 1. But to maintain consistency through all 7 steps, all k_i must have the same d_i? Or can they alternate?Wait, let me think. If we have k₁ = c + 83*d₁, then k₂ ≡ k₁ mod 83 ⇒ k₂ ≡ c mod 83 ⇒ k₂ = c + 83*d₂. Then k₃ ≡ k₂ mod 83 ⇒ k₃ = c + 83*d₃, and so on. So each k_i can independently be c or c + 83. However, when we get back to k₈ = k₁, we need k₇*b₇ ≡ 2k₁ mod 166. Since b₇ = 2, this gives k₇*2 ≡ 2k₁ mod 166 ⇒ k₇ ≡ k₁ mod 83. Which is already satisfied since all k_i ≡ c mod 83.But k₇ can be c + 83*d₇, and k₁ = c + 83*d₁. So k₇ ≡ k₁ mod 83 ⇒ d₇ ≡ d₁ mod 1, which is always true. Therefore, the d_i can be arbitrary 0 or 1 as long as when you go around the cycle, the exponents can be consistent. But maybe the actual values of k_i depend on these d_i.But the problem is that the a_i must be between 2 and 166. If k_i = c + 83*d_i, then a_i = g^{k_i} mod 167. Since g is a primitive root, g^83 has order 2 in the multiplicative group, because the order of g is 166, so g^83 has order 166 / gcd(83,166) = 166 / 83 = 2. Therefore, g^83 ≡ -1 mod 167. Therefore, a_i = g^{c}*(g^{83})^{d_i} ≡ g^c*(-1)^{d_i} mod 167.Therefore, each a_i is either g^c mod 167 or -g^c mod 167. Since a_i must be between 2 and 166, and 167 is prime, -g^c mod 167 is equivalent to 167 - g^c, which would be between 1 and 165. But we need a_i ≥ 2, so as long as g^c ≠ 1 mod 167, which is true since k_i ≥ 1 and g is primitive, so g^c ≠ 1. Similarly, 167 - g^c would be between 1 and 165, so to ensure a_i ≥ 2, we need g^c ≠ 166 mod 167. But 166 ≡ -1 mod 167, so g^c ≡ -1 mod 167 would mean that c ≡ 83 mod 166, but since c is modulo 83, wait, c is between 1 and 165, but with k_i = c + 83*d_i. Wait, this might be getting complicated.Alternatively, since we can choose c such that g^c is not 1 or 166. Since c is between 1 and 82 (because if c is in 1 to 82, then k_i can be c or c + 83, which is between 1 and 165). So as long as c is between 1 and 82, then g^c is not 1 or -1 (since the order of g is 166, so g^c = 1 would require c ≡ 0 mod 166, but c is at least 1; similarly, g^c = -1 would require c ≡ 83 mod 166, but c is at most 82). Therefore, choosing c between 1 and 82 ensures that g^c is between 2 and 166, and -g^c mod 167 is also between 1 and 165. But since a_i must be at least 2, we need to ensure that when d_i = 1 (i.e., k_i = c + 83), then a_i = g^{c + 83} = g^c * g^{83} = g^c * (-1) ≡ -g^c mod 167. So as long as -g^c mod 167 ≥ 2, which is equivalent to g^c ≤ 165. Since g is a primitive root, g^c cycles through all residues except 0, so g^c can be anything from 1 to 166. But c is between 1 and 82, so g^c is not 1 or -1, so g^c is between 2 and 166, excluding 166 only if c ≠ 83. But c is at most 82, so g^c is between 2 and g^{82}. Since 83 is the exponent that gives -1, g^{82} = g^{-1}, which is the inverse of g. So unless g is 2 or something, g^{82} could be some other number. Anyway, regardless, -g^c mod 167 is 167 - g^c, which is between 1 and 165. But we need a_i ≥ 2, so 167 - g^c ≥ 2 ⇒ g^c ≤ 165. Since g is a primitive root, and c ≥ 1, g^c ≥ 2 (since g^1 is at least 2). Therefore, 167 - g^c is between 2 and 165. For example, if g^c = 2, then 167 - 2 = 165; if g^c = 165, then 167 - 165 = 2. So depending on c, the a_i can be either g^c or 167 - g^c, both of which are between 2 and 165. So that&#39;s acceptable.Therefore, in this scenario where all b_i = 2, it&#39;s possible to choose the k_i such that each a_i is either g^c or 167 - g^c, and the system of congruences holds. Therefore, the product b₁b₂...b₇ = 2^7 = 128, and the sum b₁ + b₂ + ... + b₇ = 7*2 = 14, so the value would be 128*14 = 1792. But the problem asks for the minimal possible value. Maybe we can get a lower product or sum by choosing some b_i larger than 2, but others smaller? Wait, but the b_i are positive integers, so they must be at least 1. However, if we set some b_i to 1, let&#39;s see what happens.Suppose we set a b_i = 1. Then the congruence becomes k_i * 1 ≡ 2k_{i+1} mod 166 ⇒ k_i ≡ 2k_{i+1} mod 166. Then k_{i+1} ≡ k_i / 2 mod 83. But since we are dealing with integers, if k_i is even, then k_{i+1} = k_i / 2 mod 83. If k_i is odd, then 2k_{i+1} ≡ k_i mod 166 would require that k_i is even, otherwise there&#39;s no solution. Wait, modulo 166, if k_i is odd, then 2k_{i+1} ≡ odd mod 166, but 2k_{i+1} is always even, so this is impossible. Therefore, if we set any b_i = 1, then k_i must be even. So in that case, k_{i+1} ≡ k_i / 2 mod 83. But k_i is between 1 and 165, so even k_i is between 2 and 164 (step 2). Then k_{i+1} = k_i / 2 or (k_i / 2) + 83, depending on mod 166.But this complicates the system. If one of the b_i is 1, then we have to ensure that k_i is even, and then k_{i+1} is determined. But this might propagate constraints around the cycle. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we try to set one of the b_i to 1, say b₁=1. Then k₁ must be even, and k₂ ≡ k₁ / 2 mod 83. Then for the next equation, k₂b₂ ≡ 2k₃ mod 166. If we set b₂=2, then k₂*2 ≡ 2k₃ mod 166 ⇒ k₂ ≡ k₃ mod 83. So k₃ ≡ k₂ mod 83. Then k₃ = k₂ + 83*m₃. But k₃ must be between 1 and 165. If k₂ is between 1 and 83, then k₃ could be k₂ or k₂ + 83. If k₂ is between 84 and 165, then k₃ would be k₂ - 83. But since k₂ ≡ k₁ / 2 mod 83, and k₁ is even between 2 and 164, k₁ / 2 is between 1 and 82, so k₂ is between 1 and 82. Therefore, k₃ can be k₂ or k₂ + 83. If we choose k₃ = k₂, then proceeding, we might end up with similar constraints. Alternatively, if we set some b_i to 1 and others to 2, perhaps we can reduce the overall product and sum.But this seems complicated. Let&#39;s check if b_i=1 is possible. Suppose we try to set all b_i=1. Then the congruences would be k_i ≡ 2k_{i+1} mod 166. But starting from k₁ ≡ 2k₂ mod 166, k₂ ≡ 2k₃ mod 166, ..., k₇ ≡ 2k₁ mod 166. Multiplying all together, we have k₁k₂...k₇ ≡ 2^7 k₂k₃...k₁ mod 166^7. Canceling terms, we get 1 ≡ 2^7 mod (166^7 / gcd(k₁k₂...k₇, 166^7)). But this is likely impossible because 2^7 = 128, and 1 ≡ 128 mod something? Not unless 127 ≡ 0 mod that something, which is not the case here. So likely, there&#39;s no solution with all b_i=1. Therefore, some b_i must be greater than 1.Alternatively, trying to set some b_i=1 and others=2. Suppose we have a mix. Let&#39;s say for some i, b_i=1, which forces k_i even and k_{i+1}=k_i / 2 mod 83, and for others, b_i=2, which forces k_{i} ≡ k_{i+1} mod 83. This could create a system where some k_i are determined by others, but it&#39;s not clear if this can cycle back properly.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the exponents. Since the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 166, each element a_i can be written as g^{k_i}, and the equations relate the exponents. The key is that the product of the exponents (times b_i) relates to twice the next exponent. Let&#39;s write each congruence as:k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 166If we consider this as a linear congruence, then for each i, we can write:2 * k_{i+1} ≡ b_i * k_i mod 166Which can be rewritten as:2 * k_{i+1} - b_i * k_i ≡ 0 mod 166This is a system of linear congruences. To solve such a system, we might need to consider the relationships between the k_i and b_i. However, this seems quite involved.Alternatively, since we have a cyclic system, maybe we can express all k_i in terms of k₁. Let&#39;s try to do that.From the first equation:k₁ * b₁ ≡ 2 * k₂ mod 166 ⇒ k₂ ≡ (b₁ / 2) * k₁ mod 83Wait, since 2 and 166 have gcd 2, so dividing both sides by 2, we get:k₂ ≡ (b₁ / 2) * k₁ mod 83But (b₁ / 2) must be an integer, which implies that b₁ must be even. Wait, no. If we have the equation 2 * k₂ ≡ b₁ * k₁ mod 166, then 2 divides b₁ * k₁. So either b₁ is even or k₁ is even. If b₁ is odd, then k₁ must be even. If b₁ is even, then k₁ can be even or odd. So depending on the parity of b₁ and k₁, we can have different possibilities.This complicates things. Maybe another approach is needed.Let me recall that in cyclic systems like this, the product of all the multipliers (b₁b₂...b₇) relates to the product of the coefficients (2^7) modulo the group order (166). Earlier, we saw that multiplying all the equations gives:(b₁b₂...b₇) ≡ 2^7 mod 166But 2^7 = 128 mod 166. So the product of the b_i must be congruent to 128 modulo 166. The minimal possible product is the smallest positive integer congruent to 128 mod 166. Since 128 is less than 166, the minimal product is 128, provided that such a product is achievable with b_i ≥ 1 integers. If 128 can be expressed as a product of 7 positive integers (each at least 1), then that&#39;s the minimal product. However, since each b_i must be at least 1, and we need the product to be 128. The prime factorization of 128 is 2^7, so the only way to write it as a product of 7 positive integers is seven 2s. Therefore, the minimal product is indeed 128 when each b_i=2. So in that case, the sum is 14, and the product times the sum is 128*14=1792.But is there a way to have the product be 128 but with some b_i larger than 2 and others smaller, which might reduce the sum? Wait, but since we need the product to be exactly 128, and 128=2^7, the only way to factor 128 into 7 integers greater than or equal to 1 is all 2s. If we try to use a 1, then we would need another 2^6=64, but 64*1=64, which is less than 128. Wait, no. If you have one 1 and six 2s, the product is 1*2^6=64, which is not 128. To get 128 as a product of 7 numbers, you need each to be 2, because 2^7=128. If you use a 4, then you have to reduce the number of 2s, but 4*2^5=128, but that&#39;s 6 factors, and we need 7. So 4*2^5 would require six factors, but we need seven. Therefore, you can&#39;t do that. Similarly, 8*2^4=128, but that&#39;s five factors. So no, the only way to express 128 as a product of seven positive integers is seven 2s. Therefore, the minimal product is 128 with all b_i=2, leading to the sum 14, so total 1792.But wait, the problem says &quot;compute the minimum possible value of b₁b₂...b₇(b₁ + b₂ + ...+ b₇)&quot;. So even if we could have a different combination where the product is higher but the sum is much lower, maybe the product*sum is lower. For example, suppose we have some b_i=1 and others=3. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we set one b_i=1 and another b_j=4, keeping the rest as 2. Then the product would be 1*4*2^5=128, same as before. The sum would be 1 + 4 + 5*2 = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15, which is higher than 14. So the product*sum would be 128*15=1920, which is higher than 1792. Similarly, if we set two b_i=4 and five b_i=2, but that would need the product to still be 128. Wait, 4*4*2^5=4^2*2^5=16*32=512, which is way higher than 128. So that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, if we set some b_i=1 and compensate with others. But since the product must be 128, any 1s would require the other b_i to multiply to 128, which would require the remaining 6 b_i to multiply to 128, which would be 2^7=128, but divided by 1, so still 128. But with 6 numbers, so 2^7 /1=128, which would require the other six b_i to multiply to 128. But 128=2^7, so distributing seven 2s over six numbers would require some numbers to have higher exponents. For example, one number would be 4 (2^2) and the rest 2 (2^1). Then the product is 4*2^5=128. But then we have one b_i=1 and six b_i with product 128, which would require six numbers multiplying to 128. As above, that would require 4*2^5, which is six numbers: one 4 and five 2s. Then the total sum would be 1 + 4 + 5*2 = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15, which again is higher than 14.Therefore, any introduction of a 1 into the b_i requires other b_i to be larger to maintain the product at 128, which results in a higher sum. Therefore, the minimal sum when the product is 128 is indeed 14, achieved by all b_i=2.But wait, the problem doesn&#39;t state that the product has to be exactly 128 mod 166, but from the earlier reasoning, when we multiplied all the congruences, we concluded that the product of the b_i must be congruent to 128 mod 166. However, the actual product could be larger, as long as it&#39;s congruent to 128 mod 166. For example, 128 + 166 = 294, 294 + 166 = 460, etc. However, the problem asks for the minimal possible value of the product times the sum. So if we can have a product smaller than 128 that still satisfies the congruence modulo 166, that would be better. But 128 is the minimal positive integer congruent to 128 mod 166. Since the product has to be a positive integer, the minimal possible product is 128. Therefore, we cannot have a smaller product. Hence, the minimal product is 128, achieved when all b_i=2, leading to the minimal product*sum of 1792.But wait, let me double-check this reasoning. Suppose there exists a solution where the product of the b_i is less than 128 but congruent to 128 mod 166. However, since 128 is less than 166, the minimal positive solution is 128. Therefore, there are no smaller positive integers congruent to 128 mod 166. Therefore, the minimal possible product is indeed 128. Hence, the minimal value is 128*14=1792.But to be thorough, let&#39;s confirm that such a solution exists where all b_i=2. As we considered earlier, setting all b_i=2 leads to the system of congruences k_i ≡ k_{i+1} mod 83 for each i. This allows us to choose each k_i ≡ c mod 83 for some fixed c. Then, choosing each k_i to be either c or c + 83, as needed, to ensure that a_i = g^{k_i} is between 2 and 166. For example, if we set c=1, then k_i can be 1 or 84. Then a_i = g^1 or g^84 = -g^1 mod 167. Since g is a primitive root, g^1 is some generator between 2 and 166, and -g^1 is 167 - g^1, which is also between 1 and 165. As long as g^1 ≠ 1 or 166, which it isn&#39;t, both a_i values are valid. Therefore, such a solution exists.Therefore, the minimal possible value is 1792. However, let me check once more if there&#39;s a way to have a lower product*sum by having some b_i=1 with a different modulus or something.Wait, suppose that instead of working modulo 166, we can have some exponents being multiples of 83 or 2. Wait, 166 factors into 2 and 83. So maybe we can consider the congruences modulo 2 and modulo 83 separately, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.Let&#39;s split each congruence k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 2 and mod 83.First modulo 2:k_i * b_i ≡ 0 mod 2 (since 2 * k_{i+1} ≡ 0 mod 2). Therefore, either k_i is even or b_i is even. So for each i, either k_i is even or b_i is even.Similarly, modulo 83:k_i * b_i ≡ 2 * k_{i+1} mod 83Since 83 is prime, and 2 is invertible modulo 83 (gcd(2,83)=1), we can write:k_{i+1} ≡ (b_i / 2) * k_i mod 83Here, dividing by 2 modulo 83 is equivalent to multiplying by the inverse of 2 mod 83. The inverse of 2 mod 83 is 42, since 2*42=84≡1 mod 83. Therefore:k_{i+1} ≡ 42 * b_i * k_i mod 83Therefore, the system modulo 83 is:k₂ ≡ 42 * b₁ * k₁ mod 83k₃ ≡ 42 * b₂ * k₂ mod 83...k₁ ≡ 42 * b₇ * k₇ mod 83Chaining all these together, we get:k₁ ≡ 42^7 * b₁b₂...b₇ * k₁ mod 83Assuming k₁ is not ≡ 0 mod 83 (which it can&#39;t be, since k₁ is between 1 and 165), we can divide both sides by k₁:1 ≡ 42^7 * b₁b₂...b₇ mod 83Therefore:42^7 * b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 1 mod 83We need to compute 42^7 mod 83.First, compute 42 mod 83 = 42.42^2 = 1764. 1764 ÷ 83: 83*21=1743, 1764-1743=21. So 42^2 ≡ 21 mod 83.42^4 = (42^2)^2 ≡ 21^2 = 441 ≡ 441 - 5*83 = 441 - 415 = 26 mod 83.42^6 = 42^4 * 42^2 ≡ 26 * 21 = 546 ≡ 546 - 6*83 = 546 - 498 = 48 mod 83.42^7 = 42^6 * 42 ≡ 48 * 42 = 2016. 2016 ÷ 83: 83*24=1992, 2016-1992=24. So 42^7 ≡ 24 mod 83.Therefore, the equation becomes:24 * b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 1 mod 83 ⇒ b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 24^{-1} mod 83Find the inverse of 24 modulo 83. 24x ≡ 1 mod 83.Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:83 = 3*24 + 1124 = 2*11 + 211 = 5*2 + 12 = 2*1 + 0Backwards:1 = 11 - 5*2= 11 - 5*(24 - 2*11)= 11 - 5*24 + 10*11= 11*11 - 5*24= (83 - 3*24)*11 - 5*24= 83*11 - 33*24 - 5*24= 83*11 - 38*24Therefore, -38*24 ≡ 1 mod 83 ⇒ 24^{-1} ≡ -38 ≡ 45 mod 83.Therefore, b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 45 mod 83.But earlier, from the modulus 166 condition, we have b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 128 mod 166. Since 166=2*83, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, the product must satisfy:b₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 128 mod 2andb₁b₂...b₇ ≡ 45 mod 83But 128 mod 2 is 0, so the product must be even. And 45 mod 83 is 45. So we need to solve for x ≡ 0 mod 2 and x ≡ 45 mod 83. The smallest such x is 45 + 83 = 128, which is even. Therefore, the minimal product is indeed 128, as previously concluded. Therefore, the product must be 128, and this is the minimal possible value.Therefore, the minimal product is 128, achieved when all b_i=2, leading to sum 14, and the total value 128*14=1792.But to be absolutely sure, let&#39;s check if there are other solutions where the product is higher but the sum is lower, leading to a lower total value. For example, suppose the product is 128 + 166 = 294, which is the next possible product. 294 is congruent to 128 mod 166. Then, the product is 294, and we need to factor 294 into 7 positive integers. The prime factorization of 294 is 2 * 3 * 7^2. To distribute this into 7 numbers, we might have numbers like 2, 3, 7, 7, 1, 1, 1. The sum would be 2 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22. Then the product*sum would be 294*22=6468, which is much higher than 1792. Similarly, higher products would lead to higher sums and thus higher total values. Therefore, the minimal total value is indeed achieved at the minimal product 128 with the minimal sum 14, giving 1792.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{1792}.Final Answerboxed{1792}&lt;/think&gt;Given positive integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7, b_1, b_2, ldots, b_7) satisfying (2 leq a_i leq 166) and (a_i^{b_i} equiv a_{i+1}^2 pmod{167}) for each (1 leq i leq 7) (where (a_8 = a_1)), we need to compute the minimum possible value of (b_1b_2 cdots b_7(b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7)).1.

Congruence Transformation: The given congruences translate to (k_i b_i equiv 2k_{i+1} pmod{166}) for each (i). This forms a system of linear congruences.3. Product and Sum Analysis: Multiplying all congruences gives ((b_1b_2 cdots b_7) equiv 2^7 pmod{166}). The minimal product congruent to 128 modulo 166 is 128 itself, achievable by setting all (b_i = 2).4. Sum Calculation: With all (b_i = 2), the sum (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7 = 14).5. Resulting Value: The product of the (b_i) is (128) and the sum is (14), leading to (128 times 14 = 1792).Thus, the minimum possible value is (boxed{1792}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ace701f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>🔑:</span>1. Understanding the problem and initial conditions:   - We are given positive integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7, b_1, b_2, ldots, b_7) such that (2 leq a_i leq 166).   - The condition (a_i^{b_i} equiv a_{i+1}^2 pmod{167}) holds for each (1 leq i leq 7) with (a_8 = a_1).   - We need to compute the minimum possible value of (b_1 b_2 cdots b_7 (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7)).2. Analyzing the modular condition:   - Since (167) is a prime number, we can use properties of modular arithmetic.   - The given condition can be rewritten as:     [     a_i^{b_i} equiv a_{i+1}^2 pmod{167}     ]   - By iterating this condition, we get:     [     a_1^{b_1} equiv a_2^2 pmod{167}     ]     [     a_2^{b_2} equiv a_3^2 pmod{167}     ]     [     vdots     ]     [     a_7^{b_7} equiv a_1^2 pmod{167}     ]3. Combining the conditions:   - Combining all these congruences, we get:     [     a_1^{b_1 b_2 cdots b_7} equiv a_1^{2^7} pmod{167}     ]   - Simplifying, we have:     [     a_1^{b_1 b_2 cdots b_7} equiv a_1^{128} pmod{167}     ]   - This implies:     [     a_1^{b_1 b_2 cdots b_7 - 128} equiv 1 pmod{167}     ]4. Considering the order of (a_1) modulo (167):   - The order of (a_1) modulo (167) must divide (166) (since (167) is prime, the order must divide (167-1)).   - The possible orders are (1, 2, 83, 166).5. Case 1: (a_1 = 166):   - If (a_1 = 166), then (166 equiv -1 pmod{167}).   - For (a_i = 166), we have:     [     (-1)^{b_i} equiv (-1)^2 pmod{167}     ]   - This implies (b_i) must be even for all (i).   - Therefore, (b_1 b_2 cdots b_7) is even, and the minimum value is (2^7 = 128).   - The sum (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7) is minimized when each (b_i = 2), giving (7 times 2 = 14).   - Thus, the product is:     [     128 times 14 = 1792     ]6. Case 2: (a_1 neq 166):   - The order of (a_1) modulo (167) is either (83) or (166).   - This implies:     [     b_1 b_2 cdots b_7 equiv 128 pmod{83}     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     b_1 b_2 cdots b_7 equiv 45 pmod{83}     ]   - To minimize (b_1 b_2 cdots b_7 (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7)), we assume (b_1 b_2 cdots b_7 = 45).7. Minimizing the sum (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7):   - We need to find the combination of (b_i) that multiplies to (45) and minimizes the sum.   - The prime factorization of (45) is (3^2 times 5).   - The optimal combination is (1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5), giving:     [     b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_7 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 15     ]   - Thus, the product is:     [     45 times 15 = 675     ]Conclusion:[boxed{675}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c67266a5 data-v-2ace701f><div class="review" data-v-2ace701f><div class="review-title" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>❓:</span>Let M=5a^2-a+1, N=4a^2+a-1, then the relationship between M and N is.</div><div class="divider" data-v-2ace701f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the relationship between M and N, where M is 5a² - a + 1 and N is 4a² + a - 1. Hmm, let me start by writing down both expressions clearly so I can see them side by side.M = 5a² - a + 1  N = 4a² + a - 1The question is asking about the relationship between M and N. I think this means I need to compare them somehow. Maybe subtract one from the other to see if one is greater than the other, or if there&#39;s some equality under certain conditions. Let me try that.First, let&#39;s compute M - N. That should help me see the difference between them.M - N = (5a² - a + 1) - (4a² + a - 1)Let me distribute the negative sign to each term in N:= 5a² - a + 1 - 4a² - a + 1Now combine like terms:The a² terms: 5a² - 4a² = a²  The a terms: -a - a = -2a  The constants: 1 + 1 = 2So M - N = a² - 2a + 2Hmm, so the difference between M and N is a quadratic expression: a² - 2a + 2. Now, I wonder if this quadratic is always positive, always negative, or changes sign depending on the value of a. That could tell me if M is always greater than N, always less than N, or sometimes greater and sometimes less.To check if a quadratic is always positive or negative, I can look at its discriminant. The discriminant D = b² - 4ac. For the quadratic a² - 2a + 2, the coefficients are:a (quadratic term) = 1  b (linear term) = -2  c (constant term) = 2So D = (-2)² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4Since the discriminant is negative (-4), the quadratic has no real roots and since the coefficient of a² is positive (1), the quadratic opens upwards. That means the quadratic is always positive for all real values of a. Therefore, M - N = a² - 2a + 2 is always positive, so M &gt; N for all real numbers a.Wait, let me verify that. If the quadratic is always positive, then M - N &gt; 0 implies M &gt; N always. Let me test with a specific value of a to confirm.Let&#39;s take a = 0. Then:M = 5*(0)^2 - 0 + 1 = 1  N = 4*(0)^2 + 0 - 1 = -1  So M - N = 1 - (-1) = 2, which is positive. That checks out.Another value, say a = 1:M = 5*(1)^2 - 1 + 1 = 5 -1 +1 = 5  N = 4*(1)^2 +1 -1 = 4 +1 -1 = 4  M - N = 5 -4 =1, positive again.How about a = 2:M =5*4 -2 +1=20-2+1=19  N=4*4 +2 -1=16+2-1=17  M - N=19-17=2, positive.Another test with a negative value, a = -1:M =5*(-1)^2 -(-1) +1=5+1+1=7  N=4*(-1)^2 + (-1) -1=4 -1 -1=2  M - N=7-2=5, positive.Hmm, all these tests show M - N is positive. So it seems like M is always greater than N regardless of the value of a. Therefore, the relationship between M and N is that M is always greater than N for all real numbers a.But just to be thorough, let me check a case where the quadratic a² - 2a + 2 reaches its minimum. The vertex of the quadratic is at a = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1)=1. So at a=1, the minimum value is f(1)= (1)^2 -2*1 +2=1 -2 +2=1. Which is still positive. So the minimum difference is 1, which is positive, confirming that M - N is always positive.Therefore, the conclusion is that M is always greater than N. So the relationship is M &gt; N for all real a.Final AnswerThe relationship between ( M ) and ( N ) is that ( M ) is always greater than ( N ), so boxed{M &gt; N}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the relationship between ( M ) and ( N ), we start by computing the difference ( M - N ):[M - N = (5a^2 - a + 1) - (4a^2 + a - 1)]Distributing the negative sign and combining like terms:[M - N = 5a^2 - a + 1 - 4a^2 - a + 1 = a^2 - 2a + 2]Next, we analyze the quadratic expression ( a^2 - 2a + 2 ). The discriminant ( D ) of this quadratic is calculated as follows:[D = (-2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 2 = 4 - 8 = -4]Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots and opens upwards (as the coefficient of ( a^2 ) is positive). This means ( a^2 - 2a + 2 ) is always positive for all real values of ( a ).To confirm, we check the minimum value of the quadratic at its vertex ( a = frac{-b}{2a} = 1 ):[1^2 - 2 cdot 1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1]The minimum value is 1, which is positive. Therefore, ( M - N ) is always positive, implying ( M &gt; N ) for all real ( a ).Testing specific values of ( a ) (0, 1, 2, -1) confirms that ( M - N ) is always positive. Thus, the relationship between ( M ) and ( N ) is:[boxed{M &gt; N}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the relationship between M and N, where M is 5a² - a + 1 and N is 4a² + a - 1. Hmm, let&#39;s see. Maybe I should start by simplifying both expressions or subtracting one from the other to see how they compare. Let me write them down again:M = 5a² - a + 1N = 4a² + a - 1First thought: Maybe subtract N from M to see if there&#39;s a straightforward relationship. Let&#39;s try that.M - N = (5a² - a + 1) - (4a² + a - 1)Let me distribute the negative sign to N:= 5a² - a + 1 - 4a² - a + 1Now combine like terms:5a² - 4a² = a²- a - a = -2a1 + 1 = 2So, M - N = a² - 2a + 2Hmm, that&#39;s a quadratic expression. Not sure if that helps directly. Maybe factor it or see if it&#39;s always positive or something?Let me check the discriminant of a² - 2a + 2. The discriminant is (-2)² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, this quadratic doesn&#39;t cross the x-axis and since the coefficient of a² is positive, it&#39;s always positive. So M - N is always positive. Therefore, M &gt; N for all real a.Wait, is that the case? Let me test with a specific value. Let&#39;s pick a = 0.M at a=0: 5*(0)^2 - 0 +1 = 1N at a=0: 4*(0)^2 +0 -1 = -1So M - N = 1 - (-1) = 2, which is positive. Okay.Another value, like a=1.M: 5*1 -1 +1=5 -1 +1=5N:4*1 +1 -1=4 +1 -1=4M -N=5-4=1&gt;0Another test, a=2.M:5*(4) -2 +1=20-2+1=19N:4*(4) +2 -1=16+2-1=1719-17=2&gt;0How about a negative value, a=-1.M:5*(1) -(-1) +1=5+1+1=7N:4*(1) + (-1) -1=4-1-1=27-2=5&gt;0.So in all these cases, M is greater than N. And since the quadratic M - N is always positive (as discriminant is negative), that would mean M &gt; N for all real numbers a.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another relationship, like M = N + something, but I think the key point here is that M is always larger than N.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the relationship between M and N is.&quot; So maybe it&#39;s asking for an inequality, like M &gt; N for all real a? Or perhaps another type of relationship?Alternatively, maybe they can be expressed in terms of each other. Let&#39;s see. Let me try to express M in terms of N.We have N = 4a² + a -1.Let me solve for a² in terms of N:4a² = N - a +1So a² = (N - a +1)/4Now substitute this into M:M = 5a² -a +1 = 5*( (N - a +1)/4 ) -a +1= (5/4)(N - a +1) -a +1= (5/4)N - (5/4)a + 5/4 -a +1Combine like terms:= (5/4)N - (5/4 a + 4/4 a) + (5/4 + 4/4)= (5/4)N - (9/4)a + 9/4Hmm, that introduces a term with &#39;a&#39;, so not sure if that helps. Maybe not the right approach.Alternatively, maybe solve for a from one equation and substitute into the other, but that might complicate things. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, think of M and N as quadratic functions of a, and compare their graphs. Since both are quadratics opening upwards (coefficient of a² is positive), but M has a larger coefficient (5 vs. 4), so M&#39;s graph is steeper. However, we already saw that M - N is always positive, so M is always above N. So regardless of the value of a, M is greater than N.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a specific answer like M = N + (a² - 2a + 2), but since we already saw that M - N is always positive, the relationship is M &gt; N for all real a.But let me check the problem statement again: &quot;the relationship between M and N is.&quot; So in Chinese math problems, this often expects an inequality or an equation. Since M - N is a quadratic that&#39;s always positive, then M &gt; N for all real a. Therefore, the answer should be M &gt; N.Wait, but let me verify once more with another value. Let&#39;s pick a=0.5.M:5*(0.25) -0.5 +1=1.25 -0.5 +1=1.75N:4*(0.25) +0.5 -1=1 +0.5 -1=0.51.75 -0.5=1.25&gt;0.Another test: a=10.M:5*100 -10 +1=500-10+1=491N:4*100 +10 -1=400+10-1=409491-409=82&gt;0.Alright, so all these tests confirm that M - N is always positive. Therefore, the relationship is M &gt; N.Final AnswerThe relationship between ( M ) and ( N ) is boxed{M &gt; N}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the relationship between ( M ) and ( N ), we start by subtracting ( N ) from ( M ):[M - N = (5a^2 - a + 1) - (4a^2 + a - 1)]Distributing the negative sign and combining like terms:[M - N = 5a^2 - a + 1 - 4a^2 - a + 1 = a^2 - 2a + 2]Next, we analyze the quadratic expression ( a^2 - 2a + 2 ). The discriminant of this quadratic is calculated as follows:[text{Discriminant} = (-2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 2 = 4 - 8 = -4]Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic expression ( a^2 - 2a + 2 ) has no real roots and is always positive because the coefficient of ( a^2 ) is positive. This means ( M - N ) is always positive for all real values of ( a ).Testing specific values of ( a ) (such as ( a = 0 ), ( a = 1 ), ( a = 2 ), ( a = -1 ), ( a = 0.5 ), and ( a = 10 )) confirms that ( M ) is always greater than ( N ).Thus, the relationship between ( M ) and ( N ) is (boxed{M &gt; N}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ace701f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>🔑:</span>To solve, we find M-N=5a^2-a+1-(4a^2+a-1)=a^2-2a+2=(a-1)^2+1geq1&gt;0,  Therefore, M&gt;N.

I need to find the value of &#39;a&#39; first, and then determine the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [0, 2]. Let me try to work through this step by step.Starting with part 1: Find the value of &#39;a&#39;. Since x=1 is an extremum point, that means the derivative of f(x) at x=1 should be zero, right? Because extrema occur where the derivative is zero or undefined, but since this is a polynomial function, the derivative will be defined everywhere. So, first, I should compute the derivative of f(x).The derivative f&#39;(x) is 3x² - a. Then, setting this equal to zero at x=1: 3*(1)² - a = 0. That simplifies to 3 - a = 0, so a = 3. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Wait, let me check that again. If f&#39;(1) = 0, then 3*1 - a = 0, which gives a = 3. Yeah, that&#39;s correct. So part 1&#39;s answer should be a = 3.Now, moving on to part 2: Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [0, 2]. Once we have a = 3, the function becomes f(x) = x³ - 3x. To find the extrema on a closed interval, I remember that we need to check the critical points inside the interval and also the endpoints. The critical points are where the derivative is zero or undefined, but again, since it&#39;s a polynomial, it&#39;s never undefined.So first, let&#39;s confirm the critical points. The derivative is f&#39;(x) = 3x² - 3. Setting this equal to zero: 3x² - 3 = 0 → 3x² = 3 → x² = 1 → x = ±1. But our interval is [0, 2], so x = -1 is not in the interval. Therefore, the critical points in the interval are x = 1. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. The only critical point in [0, 2] is x=1. So, the endpoints are x=0 and x=2, and the critical point is x=1.Therefore, to find the maximum and minimum values, we need to evaluate f(x) at these three points: x=0, x=1, and x=2.Calculating each:1. At x=0: f(0) = 0³ - 3*0 = 0 - 0 = 0.2. At x=1: f(1) = 1³ - 3*1 = 1 - 3 = -2.3. At x=2: f(2) = 2³ - 3*2 = 8 - 6 = 2.So, comparing the three values: f(0)=0, f(1)=-2, f(2)=2. Therefore, the maximum value on the interval is 2 at x=2, and the minimum value is -2 at x=1.But wait, let me verify that there are no other critical points. Since f&#39;(x)=3x² -3, the critical points are indeed at x=1 and x=-1. Since x=-1 is outside the interval [0,2], we don&#39;t consider it. So yes, the only critical point in [0,2] is x=1. Therefore, evaluating at the endpoints and that critical point gives us all possible extrema.Therefore, the maximum is 2 and the minimum is -2. That seems right. Let me also check the behavior of the function. Since it&#39;s a cubic function with a positive leading coefficient, it tends to infinity as x approaches infinity and negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity. But on the interval [0, 2], it&#39;s increasing from x=1 onwards because after the critical point at x=1 (which is a local minimum), the derivative becomes positive again. Let me check the derivative values:For x in (0,1), say x=0.5: f&#39;(0.5) = 3*(0.25) -3 = 0.75 -3 = -2.25 &lt;0, so decreasing.For x in (1,2), say x=1.5: f&#39;(1.5)=3*(2.25) -3 =6.75 -3=3.75&gt;0, so increasing.Therefore, the function decreases from x=0 to x=1, reaching a minimum at x=1, then increases from x=1 to x=2. So indeed, the minimum is at x=1, and the maximum is at x=2. The endpoint at x=0 is 0, which is higher than the minimum but lower than the maximum. So, the conclusion seems correct.Just to make sure I didn&#39;t make any arithmetic mistakes:f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. Correct.f(1) = 1 - 3 = -2. Correct.f(2) = 8 - 6 = 2. Correct.Yes, so the maximum is 2, minimum is -2.So summarizing:1. a = 3.2. Maximum value is 2 at x=2; minimum value is -2 at x=1.Final Answer1. The value of ( a ) is boxed{3}.2. The maximum value of the function is boxed{2} and the minimum value is boxed{-2}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that ( x = 1 ) is an extremum point of the function ( f(x) = x^3 - ax ):1. To find the value of ( a ):   - The derivative of ( f(x) ) is ( f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - a ).   - Since ( x = 1 ) is an extremum, we set ( f&#39;(1) = 0 ):     [     3(1)^2 - a = 0 implies 3 - a = 0 implies a = 3     ]   - Therefore, the value of ( a ) is (boxed{3}).2. To find the maximum and minimum values of ( f(x) ) on the interval ([0, 2]):   - With ( a = 3 ), the function becomes ( f(x) = x^3 - 3x ).   - We evaluate ( f(x) ) at the critical points and endpoints within the interval ([0, 2]).   - The critical points are found by setting ( f&#39;(x) = 0 ):     [     3x^2 - 3 = 0 implies x^2 = 1 implies x = pm 1     ]     - Only ( x = 1 ) is within the interval ([0, 2]).   - Evaluating ( f(x) ) at ( x = 0 ), ( x = 1 ), and ( x = 2 ):     [     f(0) = 0^3 - 3 cdot 0 = 0     ]     [     f(1) = 1^3 - 3 cdot 1 = 1 - 3 = -2     ]     [     f(2) = 2^3 - 3 cdot 2 = 8 - 6 = 2     ]   - The maximum value is ( 2 ) at ( x = 2 ), and the minimum value is ( -2 ) at ( x = 1 ).Therefore, the maximum value of the function is (boxed{2}) and the minimum value is (boxed{-2}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. It says that x=1 is an extremum point of the function f(x) = x³ - a x, where a is a parameter. Then there are two parts: first, find the value of a, and second, find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) when x is in the interval [0, 2]. Alright, let me tackle this step by step.Starting with part 1: Find the value of a. Since x=1 is an extremum point, that means the derivative of the function at x=1 should be zero, right? Because extrema occur where the derivative is zero or undefined. In this case, the function is a polynomial, so its derivative should exist everywhere. So, I need to compute f&#39;(x), set it equal to zero at x=1, and solve for a.Let me compute the derivative of f(x). The derivative of x³ is 3x², and the derivative of -a x is -a. So f&#39;(x) = 3x² - a. Now, set this equal to zero at x=1. So:3*(1)² - a = 0Simplify that:3*1 - a = 03 - a = 0So, solving for a, we get a = 3.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if that makes sense. If a is 3, then the function becomes f(x) = x³ - 3x. Let&#39;s see if x=1 is indeed an extremum here. Let&#39;s take the derivative again: f&#39;(x) = 3x² - 3. Setting that equal to zero: 3x² - 3 = 0 ⇒ x² = 1 ⇒ x = ±1. So, yes, x=1 is a critical point. Now, to confirm whether it&#39;s a maximum or minimum, maybe we can do the second derivative test. The second derivative of f(x) is f&#39;&#39;(x) = 6x. At x=1, f&#39;&#39;(1) = 6*1 = 6, which is positive. So that means the function is concave upward at x=1, so it&#39;s a local minimum. So, okay, x=1 is indeed an extremum (a local minimum) when a=3. So part 1 seems done; a=3.Now, moving on to part 2: Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) when x is in the interval [0, 2]. Since we found that a=3, the function becomes f(x) = x³ - 3x. We need to find the maximum and minimum of this function on the closed interval [0, 2]. For continuous functions on a closed interval, the extreme values occur either at critical points within the interval or at the endpoints. So first, let me find all critical points in [0, 2]. Critical points are where the derivative is zero or undefined. Since the derivative f&#39;(x) = 3x² - 3 is defined everywhere, we just need to find where f&#39;(x)=0.Set f&#39;(x) = 0:3x² - 3 = 03x² = 3x² = 1x = ±1But our interval is [0, 2], so x=1 is in the interval, but x=-1 is not. So the only critical point in [0, 2] is x=1. Therefore, the candidates for maximum and minimum are x=0, x=1, and x=2. Let&#39;s compute f(x) at each of these points.First, at x=0:f(0) = (0)^3 - 3*(0) = 0 - 0 = 0At x=1:f(1) = (1)^3 - 3*(1) = 1 - 3 = -2At x=2:f(2) = (2)^3 - 3*(2) = 8 - 6 = 2So, the function values at the critical point and endpoints are 0, -2, and 2. Therefore, the maximum value on [0, 2] is 2 at x=2, and the minimum value is -2 at x=1. Wait, but let me verify this. Let me check if there are any other critical points in the interval. We found x=1, and the other critical point is at x=-1, which is outside the interval. So, yes, the only critical point inside [0,2] is x=1. Then, since the endpoints are 0 and 2, those are the only three points we need to check.So, comparing f(0)=0, f(1)=-2, and f(2)=2, the maximum is 2 at x=2 and the minimum is -2 at x=1. Hmm, seems straightforward. But wait, let me just make sure there&#39;s no mistake in the calculations.Calculating f(0): 0³ is 0, 3*0 is 0, so 0 - 0 = 0. Correct.f(1): 1 - 3 = -2. Correct.f(2): 8 - 6 = 2. Correct. Alright, that seems right.Wait, but another thought: sometimes, even if a critical point is a local minimum or maximum, the endpoints could still be higher or lower. But in this case, since we have only one critical point inside the interval, and the function is a cubic, which tends to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity and positive infinity as x approaches positive infinity. But on the interval [0,2], the function is going from 0 at x=0, down to -2 at x=1, then up to 2 at x=2. So the graph is decreasing from 0 to 1, then increasing from 1 to 2. So yes, that would make x=1 the minimum, and the maximums at the endpoints. Since f(0)=0 and f(2)=2, the maximum is at x=2. So that checks out.Therefore, the maximum value is 2 and the minimum is -2. So part 2 is done.But wait, let me double-check by graphing the function mentally. The function f(x) = x³ - 3x. At x=0, it&#39;s 0. At x=1, it&#39;s -2. At x=2, it&#39;s 2. Between 0 and 1, derivative is negative (since at x=0.5, f&#39;(0.5)=3*(0.25) -3=0.75-3=-2.25&lt;0), so decreasing. Between 1 and 2, derivative at x=1.5 is 3*(2.25) -3=6.75-3=3.75&gt;0, so increasing. So yes, decreasing then increasing, with critical point at x=1. Therefore, the minimum is at x=1, and maximum at x=2. And at x=0, it&#39;s in between. So that makes sense. Alright, so I think that&#39;s correct.So summarizing:1. The value of a is 3.2. The maximum value of f(x) on [0,2] is 2 at x=2, and the minimum value is -2 at x=1.I think that&#39;s it. Let me check once more if there&#39;s any possible mistake.Wait, for part 1, we were told that x=1 is an extremum. We found a=3, and confirmed that x=1 is a local minimum. So that&#39;s correct. If a were different, x=1 might not be a critical point. For example, if a was something else, then setting f&#39;(1)=0 would require a=3. So that&#39;s solid.For part 2, plugging a=3 into the function, evaluated at the critical point and endpoints, and got the max and min. All steps seem logical and checked. So I think that&#39;s correct.Final Answer1. The value of ( a ) is (boxed{3}).2. The maximum value of the function on ([0, 2]) is (boxed{2}) and the minimum value is (boxed{-2}).&lt;/think&gt;Given that ( x = 1 ) is an extremum point of the function ( f(x) = x^3 - ax ):1. To find the value of ( a ):   - Compute the derivative of ( f(x) ): ( f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - a ).   - Since ( x = 1 ) is an extremum, set ( f&#39;(1) = 0 ):     [     3(1)^2 - a = 0 implies 3 - a = 0 implies a = 3     ]   - Therefore, the value of ( a ) is (boxed{3}).2. To find the maximum and minimum values of ( f(x) ) when ( x in [0, 2] ):   - With ( a = 3 ), the function becomes ( f(x) = x^3 - 3x ).   - Find the critical points by setting ( f&#39;(x) = 0 ):     [     3x^2 - 3 = 0 implies x^2 = 1 implies x = pm 1     ]   - Within the interval ([0, 2]), the critical point is ( x = 1 ).   - Evaluate ( f(x) ) at the critical point and the endpoints ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2 ):     [     f(0) = 0^3 - 3 cdot 0 = 0     ]     [     f(1) = 1^3 - 3 cdot 1 = 1 - 3 = -2     ]     [     f(2) = 2^3 - 3 cdot 2 = 8 - 6 = 2     ]   - The maximum value is ( 2 ) at ( x = 2 ) and the minimum value is ( -2 ) at ( x = 1 ).Therefore, the maximum value of the function on ([0, 2]) is (boxed{2}) and the minimum value is (boxed{-2}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ace701f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>🔑:</span>1. Since we know f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - a,  Because x=1 is an extremum point of the function f(x), we have f&#39;(1) = 0.  Therefore, we get a = 3.  2. Solving f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 3 &gt; 0, we find x &gt; 1 or x &lt; -1,  Thus, (-infty, -1) and (1, +infty) are the intervals where the function f(x) is increasing; the interval (-1, 1) is where the function f(x) is decreasing.  Therefore, when x in [0, 2], the minimum value of the function f(x) is f(1) = -2;  Also, since f(0) = 0 and f(2) = 2, when x in [0, 2], the maximum value of the function f(x) is f(2) = 2.  Thus, when x in [0, 2], the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) are 2 and -2, respectively.Therefore, the value of a is boxed{3}, and when x in [0, 2], the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) are boxed{2} and boxed{-2}, respectively.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c67266a5 data-v-2ace701f><div class="review" data-v-2ace701f><div class="review-title" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>❓:</span>Example 22 (2001 Guangdong College Entrance Examination Question) In the quadrilateral pyramid S-ABCD with a right trapezoid base, angle ABC= 90^{circ}, SA perp plane ABCD, SA=AB=BC=1, AD=frac{1}{2}, find the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by faces SCD and SBA.</div><div class="divider" data-v-2ace701f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by the faces SCD and SBA in this quadrilateral pyramid. Let me start by visualizing the figure. The base is a right trapezoid ABCD with angle ABC = 90 degrees. SA is perpendicular to the plane ABCD, and SA, AB, BC are all length 1. AD is 1/2. First, I should probably sketch this out. Since it&#39;s a right trapezoid, sides AB and BC are perpendicular. Let me consider the base ABCD. Let&#39;s place point A at the origin (0,0,0). Then AB is along the x-axis, BC is along the y-axis. Since AB = 1, BC = 1, so point B is (1,0,0), point C is (1,1,0). Now, AD is 1/2. Since ABCD is a right trapezoid, AD must be parallel to BC. Wait, but BC is vertical here (from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0)), so AD should also be vertical? But AD is connected from A to D. If AD is parallel to BC, which is vertical, then AD would also be vertical. But if ABC is 90 degrees, then the trapezoid has sides AB and BC perpendicular. So sides AB and AD are adjacent, but AD is not necessarily vertical. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the configuration.Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at B, so angle ABC is 90 degrees. So AB and BC are perpendicular. Then, since ABCD is a trapezoid, two sides must be parallel. In a trapezoid, the two parallel sides are called the bases. Since it&#39;s a right trapezoid, one of the non-parallel sides is perpendicular to the bases. So, if angle ABC is 90 degrees, then AB and BC are perpendicular. Therefore, the bases must be AB and CD, or AD and BC? Wait, if ABCD is a trapezoid, the two parallel sides could be AD and BC. If AD is parallel to BC, then since BC is of length 1 (from B(1,0,0) to C(1,1,0)), then AD should also be vertical. But AD is given as length 1/2. So point D would be (0,0,0) + some vertical movement? Wait, but point A is at (0,0,0). If AD is vertical, then D would be (0,0 + 1/2, 0)? But then BC is vertical from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0), and AD is vertical from (0,0,0) to (0,1/2,0). Then the two parallel sides AD and BC are both vertical, but of different lengths (1/2 and 1). Then AB is horizontal from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0), and CD would connect (1,1,0) to (0,1/2,0). Hmm, that seems possible. Wait, but then CD would be slanting. Let me confirm the coordinates:Points:A: (0,0,0)B: (1,0,0) (since AB =1)C: (1,1,0) (since BC =1 and angle at B is 90 degrees)D: Since AD =1/2 and AD is parallel to BC, which is vertical (from y=0 to y=1 at x=1), then AD should also be vertical. So starting at A(0,0,0), moving up 1/2 in the y-direction, so D is (0,1/2,0).Wait, but then BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0), and AD is from (0,0,0) to (0,1/2,0). Then the two parallel sides are AD and BC. Then the other sides AB and CD. AB is from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0). CD is from (1,1,0) to (0,1/2,0). Let me check the length of CD: sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (1 - 1/2)^2] = sqrt[1 + 1/4] = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2. Okay, that&#39;s fine.So the base ABCD is a right trapezoid with bases AD (length 1/2) and BC (length 1), legs AB (length 1) and CD (length sqrt(5)/2). Then SA is perpendicular to the plane ABCD, SA = 1. So point S is (0,0,1) because SA is from A(0,0,0) upwards in the z-direction.Wait, but SA is length 1, so yes, S would be at (0,0,1). Now, the problem is to find the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by faces SCD and SBA.First, let&#39;s recall that a dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. So we need to find the angle between the planes SCD and SBA.To find the dihedral angle, one method is to find the angle between the normal vectors of the two planes. Alternatively, we can find a line of intersection and then find the angle using the edges perpendicular to the line of intersection.Alternatively, another method is to find the angle between the two planes by considering a point on their line of intersection and drawing lines in each plane perpendicular to the intersection line, then measuring the angle between those two lines.First, let&#39;s determine the line of intersection between the two planes SCD and SBA.Plane SBA: points S, B, A. Since S is (0,0,1), B is (1,0,0), and A is (0,0,0). So this plane is the triangle formed by these three points. Let me see: points S(0,0,1), B(1,0,0), A(0,0,0). So the plane SBA is the x-z plane at y=0? Wait, because all points have y=0 except maybe S? Wait, S is (0,0,1), which is (x=0,y=0,z=1), so yes, all points in SBA have y=0. So plane SBA is the plane y=0.Wait, but point B is (1,0,0), A is (0,0,0), S is (0,0,1). So these three points lie in the plane y=0. So the plane SBA is the plane y=0. So the plane SBA is the x-z plane, restricted to the area of the triangle SBA.Plane SCD: points S(0,0,1), C(1,1,0), D(0,1/2,0). Let&#39;s find the equation of this plane.First, find two vectors in the plane SCD. For example, vectors SC and SD.Vector SC = C - S = (1,1,0) - (0,0,1) = (1,1,-1)Vector SD = D - S = (0,1/2,0) - (0,0,1) = (0,1/2,-1)Then the normal vector to plane SCD is the cross product of SC and SD.Compute cross product SC × SD:SC = (1,1,-1)SD = (0,1/2,-1)Cross product:|i     j     k||1     1   -1||0   1/2 -1|= i*(1*(-1) - (-1)*(1/2)) - j*(1*(-1) - (-1)*0) + k*(1*(1/2) - 1*0)= i*(-1 + 1/2) - j*(-1 - 0) + k*(1/2 - 0)= (-1/2)i + 1j + (1/2)kSo normal vector n1 = (-1/2, 1, 1/2)Plane SBA is y=0, whose normal vector is (0,1,0) because the plane y=0 has equation y=0, so normal vector in the positive y-direction.Wait, but dihedral angle between two planes can be found using the angle between their normal vectors. However, we have to be careful because the angle between the normals could be the supplement of the dihedral angle. The dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes, which can be found by taking the angle between the normals or 180 minus that, depending on orientation.But the tangent of the dihedral angle can be found by the formula involving the normals.Alternatively, since one of the planes is y=0, which has normal vector (0,1,0), and the other plane SCD has normal vector (-1/2, 1, 1/2). The angle between the normals is given by the dot product:cosθ = (n1 • n2) / (|n1| |n2|)But n2 is (0,1,0). So n1 • n2 = (-1/2)(0) + (1)(1) + (1/2)(0) = 1.|n1| = sqrt( (-1/2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 1 + 1/4) = sqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2) = (√6)/2.|n2| = 1.So cosθ = 1 / ( (√6)/2 * 1 ) = 2/√6 = √6/3.Thus, θ = arccos(√6/3).But the dihedral angle might be this angle or its supplement. However, since both normals are pointing &quot;upwards&quot; relative to their planes, probably the angle between the normals is equal to the dihedral angle. Wait, but plane SBA is y=0, and normal vector (0,1,0) is pointing in the positive y-direction. The normal vector for plane SCD is (-1/2, 1, 1/2). The y-component is positive, so it&#39;s also pointing upwards in y. Therefore, the angle between them is acute, which is the dihedral angle. So θ = arccos(√6/3). Then tanθ = sqrt(1 - (√6/3)^2) / (√6/3). Let&#39;s compute that.First, (√6/3)^2 = 6/9 = 2/3. So sqrt(1 - 2/3) = sqrt(1/3) = 1/√3. Therefore tanθ = (1/√3) / (√6/3) = (1/√3) * (3/√6) = 3 / (√3 * √6) = 3 / √18 = 3 / (3√2) = 1/√2 = √2/2. Wait, that gives tanθ = √2/2. Hmm, but I need to check if this is correct.Wait, but maybe this approach is not correct because the dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes, but when we take the normals, the angle between normals can be the same or supplementary to the dihedral angle. Wait, according to some sources, the dihedral angle is equal to the angle between the normals if they are pointing towards each other, otherwise, it&#39;s 180 minus that angle. But in this case, both normals are pointing upwards (since plane SBA&#39;s normal is (0,1,0) and plane SCD&#39;s normal is (-1/2,1,1/2), which also has positive y-component). So maybe the angle between the normals is indeed the dihedral angle. Therefore, the tangent is √2/2. But I need to verify.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the normal vectors. Let&#39;s think differently. Another way to compute the dihedral angle is to find the angle between the two planes along their line of intersection. So first, find the line of intersection between planes SCD and SBA.Plane SBA is y=0. Plane SCD is the plane containing points S(0,0,1), C(1,1,0), D(0,1/2,0). So what is the line of intersection between these two planes?Since plane SBA is y=0, and plane SCD contains points S(0,0,1), C(1,1,0), D(0,1/2,0). To find their line of intersection, we need to find points that are common to both planes. The plane SBA is y=0, so any point on both planes must satisfy y=0 and lie on plane SCD.Let me parametrize plane SCD. Let&#39;s find the equation of plane SCD. We already found the normal vector n1 = (-1/2, 1, 1/2). So the equation of plane SCD is:-1/2(x - 0) + 1(y - 0) + 1/2(z - 1) = 0Simplifying:-1/2 x + y + 1/2 z - 1/2 = 0Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fractions:- x + 2y + z - 1 = 0So equation of plane SCD: -x + 2y + z = 1Now, plane SBA is y=0. The line of intersection is the set of points satisfying both y=0 and -x + 2y + z = 1. Substituting y=0 into the second equation:-x + 0 + z = 1 ⇒ -x + z = 1 ⇒ z = x + 1So the line of intersection is parametrized by x = t, y=0, z = t + 1, where t is a parameter.Thus, the line is (t, 0, t + 1). So direction vector of the line is (1,0,1). To find the dihedral angle between the two planes, we can find two vectors, one in each plane, that are perpendicular to the line of intersection. The angle between these vectors will be the dihedral angle.In plane SBA (which is y=0), a vector perpendicular to the line of intersection (1,0,1) can be found by taking a vector in the plane SBA that&#39;s perpendicular to (1,0,1). Since plane SBA is y=0, which is the x-z plane, vectors in this plane have y=0. So let&#39;s take a vector in SBA that&#39;s perpendicular to (1,0,1). Let&#39;s call this vector v1.To find v1, we can take a vector in plane SBA (y=0) such that v1 • (1,0,1) = 0.Let v1 = (a, 0, b). Then:a*1 + 0*0 + b*1 = 0 ⇒ a + b = 0 ⇒ b = -a.So v1 can be (1, 0, -1) for simplicity.In plane SCD, we need a vector perpendicular to the line of intersection (1,0,1). Let&#39;s find a vector in plane SCD that&#39;s perpendicular to (1,0,1). Let&#39;s call this vector v2.First, plane SCD has normal vector n1 = (-1/2, 1, 1/2). Any vector in plane SCD must satisfy the plane equation. Let&#39;s take a vector in plane SCD that is perpendicular to the line&#39;s direction vector (1,0,1). Let me represent vector v2 as (c, d, e). Then:v2 must lie in plane SCD: (-1/2)c + 1*d + 1/2*e = 0 (since the normal vector dotted with the vector is zero).Also, v2 must be perpendicular to (1,0,1), so:c*1 + d*0 + e*1 = 0 ⇒ c + e = 0 ⇒ e = -c.So substituting e = -c into the plane equation:-1/2 c + d + 1/2*(-c) = 0 ⇒ -1/2 c - 1/2 c + d = 0 ⇒ -c + d = 0 ⇒ d = c.Thus, vector v2 can be (c, c, -c). Let&#39;s choose c=1 for simplicity, so v2 = (1,1,-1).Now, we have vectors v1 = (1,0,-1) in plane SBA and v2 = (1,1,-1) in plane SCD, both perpendicular to the line of intersection (1,0,1). The angle between v1 and v2 will be the dihedral angle.Compute the angle between v1 and v2:cosφ = (v1 • v2) / (|v1| |v2|)v1 • v2 = (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2|v1| = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)|v2| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(3)Thus, cosφ = 2 / (sqrt(2)sqrt(3)) = 2 / sqrt(6) = sqrt(6)/3Therefore, φ = arccos(sqrt(6)/3). Then, tanφ = sqrt(1 - (6/9)) / (sqrt(6)/3) = sqrt(3/9) / (sqrt(6)/3) = (sqrt(3)/3) / (sqrt(6)/3) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(2)/2.So tanφ = sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately 0.707. Therefore, the tangent of the dihedral angle is sqrt(2)/2.But let me cross-verify with another approach to ensure correctness.Alternative method: Using coordinates, find two points on each plane, then compute the angle.Alternatively, since the dihedral angle is formed by the two planes, we can find two lines, one on each plane, intersecting at the line of intersection and perpendicular to it, then compute the angle between these two lines.Alternatively, since we have the normal vectors, perhaps we can use another formula involving the tangent. Wait, we found the angle between the normals gives us an angle θ with cosθ = sqrt(6)/3, so tanθ = sqrt(2)/2. Wait, but is θ the dihedral angle or its complement?Wait, the dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, which can be found by the angle between their normals or 180 minus that angle. However, depending on the orientation of the normals. If the normals are pointing towards each other, the angle between normals is the dihedral angle. If they are pointing away, it&#39;s 180 minus that. Since in our case, both normals are pointing upwards (normal of SBA is (0,1,0), normal of SCD is (-1/2,1,1/2) which has positive y and z components), so the angle between them is acute, which should be the dihedral angle. Hence, the previous calculation gives tanφ = sqrt(2)/2. However, when I computed using the vectors in the plane, I also got tanφ = sqrt(2)/2. So seems consistent.Wait, but in the first approach, we computed θ as the angle between normals with cosθ = sqrt(6)/3, which gives tanθ = sqrt(2)/2, which matches the other method. Therefore, both methods confirm that the tangent is sqrt(2)/2.But just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Let&#39;s find the dihedral angle by finding the angle between the edges.Alternatively, since the dihedral angle is formed by the two planes SCD and SBA along their line of intersection. Let&#39;s consider a point on the line of intersection and then find two lines, each in one plane, perpendicular to the line of intersection, and then compute the angle between those two lines.We already found that the line of intersection is parametrized as (t,0,t+1). Let&#39;s take a specific point on this line. Let&#39;s take t=0: point (0,0,1), which is point S. Wait, but S is part of both planes. However, if we take another point, say when t=1: (1,0,2). But this point (1,0,2) is not part of the original figure. Wait, the line of intersection is (t,0,t+1). Let&#39;s check if this line passes through point S: when t=0, z=1, which is S(0,0,1). Also, when t=-1, we get (-1,0,0). But that point is not part of the original figure. However, the line extends beyond the figure. But in our case, since we are dealing with planes, the dihedral angle is determined by the orientation of the planes, regardless of the specific figures.But maybe it&#39;s better to take point S(0,0,1) on the line of intersection. Then, in plane SBA, the line from S along the direction v1 = (1,0,-1). So starting at S(0,0,1), moving along (1,0,-1) brings us to point (1,0,0), which is point B. Similarly, in plane SCD, starting at S(0,0,1), moving along v2 = (1,1,-1) brings us to point (1,1,0), which is point C. So the angle between vectors SB and SC?Wait, point S to B is vector SB = (1,0,-1), and point S to C is vector SC = (1,1,-1). Then the angle between SB and SC is the same as the angle between vectors (1,0,-1) and (1,1,-1).Compute the cosine of the angle:cosφ = (1*1 + 0*1 + (-1)*(-1)) / (sqrt(1+0+1) * sqrt(1+1+1)) = (1 + 0 + 1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) = 2/(sqrt(6)) = sqrt(6)/3So angle φ = arccos(sqrt(6)/3), same as before. Then tanφ = sqrt(2)/2. So this is consistent.Therefore, regardless of the method, the tangent of the dihedral angle is sqrt(2)/2.But let me verify with coordinate geometry. Let&#39;s find two points on each plane, not on the line of intersection, and project them appropriately. Alternatively, perhaps construct a common perpendicular line.Alternatively, since we are dealing with a dihedral angle, another approach is to find the angle between the two planes by considering the height from a point to the line of intersection.Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of all points, maybe we can compute the angle by finding the coordinates of certain lines or using vectors.Wait, another way: the dihedral angle can be found by considering the angle between the two planes when looking along the line of intersection. To compute this, we can choose a point on the line of intersection and then compute the angle between two lines, each lying on a respective plane and perpendicular to the line of intersection.We already did this with vectors v1 and v2, resulting in tanφ = sqrt(2)/2.Alternatively, we can use the formula for the dihedral angle in terms of coordinates. The formula using coordinates of the points. Let&#39;s consider points in each plane.But given that all these methods lead to the same answer, I think it&#39;s safe to conclude that the tangent of the dihedral angle is sqrt(2)/2.However, to be 100% sure, let&#39;s check once more with coordinates.Take the line of intersection as found earlier: parametrized by (t,0,t+1). Let&#39;s take two points on this line: when t=0, point S(0,0,1), and when t=1, point (1,0,2). Although (1,0,2) is not part of the original figure, it&#39;s on the line of intersection.Now, in plane SBA (y=0), take a direction perpendicular to the line of intersection. The direction vector of the line is (1,0,1). So a perpendicular direction in plane SBA would be, as before, (1,0,-1). So from point S(0,0,1), moving along (1,0,-1) lands at (1,0,0) which is point B.In plane SCD, from point S(0,0,1), moving along direction (1,1,-1) lands at (1,1,0), which is point C.So the angle between SB and SC is the dihedral angle.As computed before, vectors SB(1,0,-1) and SC(1,1,-1) have an angle with cosφ = sqrt(6)/3, so tanφ = sqrt(2)/2.Therefore, all methods converge to the same answer, which gives me confidence that the tangent of the dihedral angle is indeed sqrt(2)/2.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To find the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by the faces (SCD) and (SBA) in the quadrilateral pyramid (S-ABCD), we start by analyzing the given coordinates and geometry of the figure.1. Coordinates of Points:   - (A(0, 0, 0))   - (B(1, 0, 0))   - (C(1, 1, 0))   - (D(0, frac{1}{2}, 0))   - (S(0, 0, 1))2. Plane Equations:   - Plane (SBA) is the x-z plane ((y = 0)).   - Plane (SCD) has normal vector computed using points (S), (C), and (D):     - Vectors (SC = (1, 1, -1)) and (SD = (0, frac{1}{2}, -1))     - Normal vector (n_1 = (-frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{1}{2}))     - Equation: (-x + 2y + z = 1)3. Line of Intersection:   - Intersection of planes (SBA) ((y = 0)) and (SCD) ((-x + 2y + z = 1)):   - Parametrized as ((t, 0, t + 1)) with direction vector ((1, 0, 1)).4. Vectors Perpendicular to Line of Intersection:   - In plane (SBA), vector (v_1 = (1, 0, -1))   - In plane (SCD), vector (v_2 = (1, 1, -1))5. Angle Between Vectors:   - Dot product: (v_1 cdot v_2 = 2)   - Magnitudes: (|v_1| = sqrt{2}), (|v_2| = sqrt{3})   - Cosine of angle: (cos phi = frac{2}{sqrt{6}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3})   - Tangent of angle: (tan phi = frac{sqrt{2}}{2})Thus, the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by faces (SCD) and (SBA) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It&#39;s about a quadrilateral pyramid S-ABCD with a right trapezoid base. The given information is angle ABC is 90 degrees, SA is perpendicular to the plane ABCD, SA equals AB equals BC equals 1, and AD is 1/2. I need to find the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by the faces SCD and SBA. Hmm, okay.First, let me visualize the figure. The base is a right trapezoid ABCD, with angle ABC being 90 degrees. That means sides AB and BC are perpendicular. SA is perpendicular to the base, so point S is above the base, connected to A. The lengths given are SA=AB=BC=1, and AD=1/2. So, AB is 1, BC is 1, AD is 1/2. Since ABCD is a right trapezoid, AD must be parallel to BC. Wait, because in a trapezoid, two sides are parallel. Since angle ABC is 90 degrees, and BC is one of the legs, the other base AD should be parallel to BC. But BC is 1, AD is 1/2. So, maybe ABCD has bases AD and BC, with AD=1/2 and BC=1. Then, AB is the height between them, which is 1. Wait, but AB is given as 1. Let me confirm.So, if ABCD is a right trapezoid with angle ABC=90°, then sides AB and BC are perpendicular. The other two sides are AD and DC. Since it&#39;s a trapezoid, AD must be parallel to BC. Therefore, AD is parallel to BC. Given that AD=1/2 and BC=1, the lengths of the two bases are different. So the trapezoid has bases AD (1/2) and BC (1), with legs AB (1) and DC. Hmm, need to figure out the coordinates or the positions of the points.Maybe assigning coordinates would help. Let&#39;s set point A at the origin (0,0,0). Since SA is perpendicular to the base and SA=1, then S would be at (0,0,1). Now, AB is 1, and angle ABC is 90°, so if A is (0,0,0), then B is (1,0,0). Then BC is 1, so since angle ABC is 90°, from B, moving along BC (which is perpendicular to AB) would be in the y-direction. So point C would be (1,1,0). Now, AD is 1/2. Since AD is a base of the trapezoid and is parallel to BC, which is along the y-axis (since BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0)), so AD should also be vertical? Wait, no. Wait, AD is parallel to BC. Since BC is from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0), which is along the y-axis. So BC is vertical. Then AD should also be vertical. But AD is from point A (0,0,0) to D. So if AD is vertical, then D would be (0, something, 0). But given that AD is 1/2 in length. So D would be (0, 1/2, 0). Wait, but is that correct?Wait, if AD is parallel to BC, which is vertical (along the y-axis), then AD should also be vertical. So if A is at (0,0,0), then D would be (0, 1/2, 0). Then, the trapezoid ABCD would have vertices at A(0,0,0), B(1,0,0), C(1,1,0), D(0,1/2,0). Let me check if the sides AD and BC are parallel. The vector AD is (0,1/2,0) - (0,0,0) = (0,1/2,0). The vector BC is (1,1,0) - (1,0,0) = (0,1,0). So yes, they are parallel because BC is (0,1,0) and AD is (0,1/2,0), which are scalar multiples (so direction is same). Wait, but BC is length 1 and AD is length 1/2, so they are parallel but not equal. Therefore, ABCD is a right trapezoid with bases AD (length 1/2) and BC (length 1), and legs AB (length 1) and DC. Now, point D is (0,1/2,0). Then point C is (1,1,0), so DC would be from D(0,1/2,0) to C(1,1,0). The vector DC is (1,1/2,0), so its length is sqrt(1² + (1/2)²) = sqrt(1 + 1/4) = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2. So that&#39;s the length of DC. So that&#39;s the trapezoid.Now, the pyramid S-ABCD has apex S at (0,0,1). Now, I need to find the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by faces SCD and SBA. Dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. So the two planes are SCD and SBA. Each plane is a face of the pyramid. The dihedral angle between them can be found by finding the angle between their normal vectors or using some other method.First, let&#39;s identify the faces SCD and SBA. Face SCD consists of points S, C, D. Face SBA consists of points S, B, A.Wait, but SBA is the face with points S, B, A. That&#39;s a triangle. Similarly, SCD is the triangle with points S, C, D. So the dihedral angle is along the line of intersection of these two planes. Wait, but the two planes SCD and SBA: do they intersect along a common edge?Let me check. Plane SBA contains points S, B, A. Plane SCD contains points S, C, D. The common point is S. So their line of intersection is the line through S and... is there another common point? Let&#39;s see: Plane SBA is spanned by vectors SA and SB. Plane SCD is spanned by vectors SC and SD. Since points A, B, C, D are all on the base, and S is the apex. The line of intersection between the two planes would be the line containing S and the intersection of the two planes. But since the two planes are SBA and SCD, which don&#39;t share another common point except S, unless their lines in the base intersect. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the dihedral angle is formed along the line where the two planes meet. Since S is the only common point, maybe the line of intersection is not an edge but a line that connects S to some point where the two planes intersect. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.Alternatively, perhaps the dihedral angle is formed along the edge where the two faces meet. But in this case, the faces SCD and SBA don&#39;t share a common edge. The edges of SCD are SC, CD, SD. The edges of SBA are SB, BA, SA. They only share the vertex S. So, the dihedral angle between two planes that intersect only at a point? Wait, no. Dihedral angles are between two planes that intersect along a line. If two planes only intersect at a point, then they are not forming a dihedral angle. So maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, the problem says &quot;the dihedral angle formed by faces SCD and SBA&quot;. Since these are two faces of the pyramid, they must intersect along a line. Wait, let&#39;s check again. The face SBA is triangle S-B-A. The face SCD is triangle S-C-D. The only common point between these two faces is point S. So they don&#39;t share an edge. Therefore, how can there be a dihedral angle between them? Dihedral angles are between adjacent faces that share an edge. Maybe there&#39;s a misunderstanding here.Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the dihedral angle between the planes containing these two faces, regardless of whether they share an edge. In that case, even if they don&#39;t share an edge, we can still find the dihedral angle between the two planes. So the dihedral angle between two planes is the angle between them, which can be found by the angle between their normal vectors or using some other geometric method.But to find the tangent of that dihedral angle. Let me recall that the dihedral angle can be found using the angle between the two planes. The tangent can be calculated using the ratio of the height to the base in some triangle, or using vectors.Maybe the best approach here is to find the normal vectors to the planes SCD and SBA, then compute the angle between those normal vectors. The tangent of the dihedral angle would be related to the cross product or dot product of these normals.Alternatively, another method for finding the dihedral angle is to find a line perpendicular to the line of intersection of the two planes and lying on each plane, then measuring the angle between those two lines. But since the line of intersection isn&#39;t obvious here, perhaps the normal vector method is better.First, let&#39;s assign coordinates to all the points to make it easier. Let&#39;s set point A at (0,0,0). Then, since SA is perpendicular to the base and SA=1, point S is at (0,0,1). AB is 1, so point B is (1,0,0). BC is 1 and angle ABC is 90 degrees, so point C is (1,1,0). AD is 1/2. Since AD is parallel to BC, and AD is a vertical line (since BC is vertical), then point D is (0, 1/2, 0). Let me confirm that: AD is from (0,0,0) to (0,1/2,0), which is length 1/2, as given.So the coordinates are:A: (0,0,0)B: (1,0,0)C: (1,1,0)D: (0,1/2,0)S: (0,0,1)Now, we need to find the dihedral angle between the planes SCD and SBA.First, let&#39;s find the equations of the planes SCD and SBA.For plane SBA: points S(0,0,1), B(1,0,0), A(0,0,0). So three points are S, B, A. Since A and B are on the x-axis, and S is above A. The plane SBA is the plane containing points S, B, A. Let me find two vectors in this plane. Vector SB is B - S = (1,0,0) - (0,0,1) = (1,0,-1). Vector SA is A - S = (0,0,0) - (0,0,1) = (0,0,-1). Alternatively, vectors AB and AS. AB is (1,0,0), AS is (0,0,1). Wait, maybe I need to compute the normal vector.Let me compute the normal vector to plane SBA. Using points S, B, A.Vectors SB = (1,0,-1) and SA = (0,0,-1). The normal vector is SB × SA.Compute cross product:i  j  k1  0 -10  0 -1= i*(0*(-1) - (-1)*0) - j*(1*(-1) - (-1)*0) + k*(1*0 - 0*0)= i*(0 - 0) - j*(-1 - 0) + k*(0 - 0)= 0i + 1j + 0k = (0,1,0)So the normal vector to plane SBA is (0,1,0), which is the unit vector in the y-direction. That makes sense because plane SBA lies in the x-z plane (since all points have y=0 except S, but actually S is at (0,0,1), so no. Wait, points S, B, A: S is (0,0,1), B is (1,0,0), A is (0,0,0). So these points are in the x-z plane (since y=0 for all). Wait, no, point S has coordinates (0,0,1), so it&#39;s along the z-axis. So actually, the plane SBA is the x-z plane. Therefore, its normal vector is in the y-direction, which is (0,1,0), as calculated.Now, for plane SCD: points S(0,0,1), C(1,1,0), D(0,1/2,0). Let me find two vectors in this plane. For example, vectors SC and SD.Vector SC = C - S = (1,1,0) - (0,0,1) = (1,1,-1)Vector SD = D - S = (0,1/2,0) - (0,0,1) = (0,1/2,-1)Compute the normal vector to plane SCD by taking the cross product of SC and SD.SC × SD = |i   j   k|             1   1   -1             0  1/2 -1= i*(1*(-1) - (-1)*(1/2)) - j*(1*(-1) - (-1)*0) + k*(1*(1/2) - 1*0)= i*(-1 + 1/2) - j*(-1 - 0) + k*(1/2 - 0)= (-1/2)i + 1j + (1/2)kSo the normal vector to plane SCD is (-1/2, 1, 1/2). Let me write that as N = (-1, 2, 1) after multiplying by 2 to eliminate fractions. But actually, the normal vector can be scaled, so direction is important.Now, the normal vector to plane SBA is (0,1,0). The normal vector to plane SCD is (-1/2, 1, 1/2). The dihedral angle between the two planes is equal to the angle between their normal vectors. However, we need to be careful because the dihedral angle could be the angle or its supplement, depending on the orientation. But since we need the tangent of the dihedral angle, we can compute it using the formula involving the cross product and dot product.Recall that the cosine of the angle θ between two vectors N1 and N2 is given by:cosθ = (N1 · N2) / (|N1| |N2|)And the sine of the angle is given by:sinθ = |N1 × N2| / (|N1| |N2|)Therefore, tanθ = sinθ / cosθ = |N1 × N2| / (N1 · N2)So let&#39;s compute both the dot product and cross product of the normal vectors.First, N1 = (0,1,0), N2 = (-1/2, 1, 1/2)Dot product N1 · N2 = 0*(-1/2) + 1*1 + 0*(1/2) = 1The magnitude of N1 is |N1| = sqrt(0² + 1² + 0²) = 1The magnitude of N2 is |N2| = sqrt((-1/2)² + 1² + (1/2)²) = sqrt(1/4 + 1 + 1/4) = sqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2) = (√6)/2Wait:(-1/2)^2 = 1/41^2 = 1(1/2)^2 = 1/4Sum: 1/4 + 1 + 1/4 = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2So |N2| = sqrt(3/2) = (√6)/2 ≈ 1.2247Now, cross product N1 × N2:N1 is (0,1,0), N2 is (-1/2,1,1/2)Compute:i   j   k0   1   0-1/2 1 1/2= i*(1*(1/2) - 0*1) - j*(0*(1/2) - 0*(-1/2)) + k*(0*1 - 1*(-1/2))= i*(1/2 - 0) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(0 + 1/2)= (1/2)i - 0j + (1/2)kSo N1 × N2 = (1/2, 0, 1/2)The magnitude of this cross product is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + 0^2 + (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 0 + 1/4) = sqrt(1/2) = (√2)/2Therefore, sinθ = |N1 × N2| / (|N1| |N2|) = (√2/2) / (1 * √6/2) ) = (√2/2) * (2/√6) ) = √2 / √6 = (√2)/(√6) = 1/√3And cosθ = (N1 · N2) / (|N1| |N2|) = 1 / (1 * √6/2) ) = 2/√6 = √6/3Therefore, tanθ = sinθ / cosθ = (1/√3) / (√6/3) ) = (1/√3) * (3/√6) ) = 3 / (√3 * √6) ) = 3 / √18 = 3 / (3√2) ) = 1/√2 = √2/2Wait, but that&#39;s strange because the tangent of the dihedral angle is √2/2. But let me check my steps again.Wait, let&#39;s recast the calculations:First, N1 is (0,1,0), N2 is (-1/2,1,1/2)Dot product: 0*(-1/2) + 1*1 + 0*(1/2) = 1|N1| = 1, |N2| = sqrt( ( (-1/2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/2)^2 )) = sqrt(1/4 + 1 + 1/4 ) = sqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2)Then, cosθ = 1 / sqrt(3/2) = sqrt(2/3) = same as 2/√6, which is √6/3 when rationalized.Cross product N1 × N2 is (1/2, 0, 1/2), magnitude sqrt( (1/2)^2 + 0 + (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2) = √2/2Then, sinθ = |N1 × N2| / (|N1| |N2| ) = (√2/2) / (1 * sqrt(3/2)) ) = (√2/2) / (sqrt(3)/sqrt(2)) ) = (√2/2) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)) ) = (2/2) / sqrt(3) ) = 1/sqrt(3)Thus, tanθ = sinθ / cosθ = (1/sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(6)/3 )Wait, sqrt(6)/3 is the same as sqrt(6)/3. Let&#39;s compute:sqrt(6)/3 = (sqrt(6)/sqrt(9)) = sqrt(6/9) = sqrt(2/3). Wait, but sqrt(6)/3 is equal to (sqrt(6)/3).But 1/sqrt(3) divided by sqrt(6)/3 is equal to (1/sqrt(3)) * (3/sqrt(6)) ) = 3 / (sqrt(3)*sqrt(6)) ) = 3 / sqrt(18) = 3 / (3*sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.Yes, so tanθ = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.But let me think again: dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. The normal vectors are (0,1,0) and (-1/2,1,1/2). The angle between normals is θ, but the dihedral angle could be θ or π - θ. However, since we are talking about the tangent, which is positive in the first and third quadrants. But since dihedral angles are between 0 and π, so the tangent would be positive if the angle is acute, negative if obtuse, but since tangent is asked, perhaps they want the absolute value.But according to our calculation, tanθ = sqrt(2)/2. But let&#39;s verify this with another approach, to be safe.Alternative method: To find the dihedral angle between two planes, another approach is to find two lines, one on each plane, that are both perpendicular to the line of intersection of the planes. Then the angle between those two lines is the dihedral angle.But in this case, the line of intersection between the two planes SBA and SCD. Since plane SBA has normal vector (0,1,0) and plane SCD has normal vector (-1/2,1,1/2). The line of intersection of the two planes can be found by solving the equations of the two planes.But since we already have the normals, perhaps another way. Wait, the line of intersection direction is given by the cross product of the two normal vectors. Wait, the direction vector of the line of intersection is N1 × N2.Wait, but the direction vector of the line of intersection of two planes is along the cross product of their normal vectors. So if N1 and N2 are normals, then the direction is N1 × N2. Which in our case is (1/2, 0, 1/2), as calculated earlier. So the line of intersection is along the vector (1,0,1) (if we multiply by 2). So direction vector (1,0,1). So the line of intersection of the two planes SBA and SCD is a line with direction vector (1,0,1). Since both planes pass through point S(0,0,1), the line of intersection is the line through S(0,0,1) in the direction (1,0,1). Wait, but let&#39;s check.Equation of plane SBA: normal vector (0,1,0), passes through S(0,0,1). So the equation is 0(x - 0) + 1(y - 0) + 0(z - 1) = 0 ⇒ y = 0. Wait, but plane SBA: points S(0,0,1), B(1,0,0), A(0,0,0) all lie on the plane y=0. So plane SBA is y=0.Equation of plane SCD: normal vector (-1/2,1,1/2), passes through S(0,0,1). The equation is (-1/2)(x - 0) + 1(y - 0) + (1/2)(z - 1) = 0 ⇒ -1/2 x + y + 1/2 z - 1/2 = 0 ⇒ Multiply both sides by 2: -x + 2y + z - 1 = 0 ⇒ -x + 2y + z = 1.So the line of intersection is the set of points satisfying both y=0 and -x + 2*0 + z = 1 ⇒ -x + z = 1. So parametric equations: let x = t, then z = 1 + t, y=0. So the line is (t, 0, 1 + t). Therefore, direction vector is (1,0,1), as we found before.So the line of intersection is parametrized as (t, 0, 1 + t). So to find two lines, one on each plane, perpendicular to this line of intersection, we can proceed as follows.On plane SBA (y=0), we need a line that is perpendicular to the direction vector (1,0,1). Since plane SBA is y=0 (the x-z plane), a line in this plane perpendicular to (1,0,1) must have direction vector perpendicular to (1,0,1) and lying on the x-z plane. Let&#39;s compute a direction vector perpendicular to (1,0,1) in the x-z plane.Let the direction vector be (a,0,b). The dot product with (1,0,1) must be zero: a*1 + 0*0 + b*1 = 0 ⇒ a + b = 0. So a = -b. So direction vector could be (1,0,-1).Similarly, on plane SCD, we need a line perpendicular to (1,0,1). The plane SCD has equation -x + 2y + z = 1. Let&#39;s find a direction vector in this plane that is perpendicular to (1,0,1). Let the direction vector be (c,d,e). It must satisfy two conditions: it lies on the plane SCD, so it must satisfy -c + 2d + e = 0 (since direction vectors are differences of points on the plane, which satisfy -Δx + 2Δy + Δz = 0). And it must be perpendicular to (1,0,1), so c*1 + d*0 + e*1 = 0 ⇒ c + e = 0.So we have:-c + 2d + e = 0c + e = 0From the second equation, e = -c. Substitute into first equation:-c + 2d + (-c) = 0 ⇒ -2c + 2d = 0 ⇒ d = c.So direction vector is (c, c, -c). Let&#39;s take c=1, then direction vector is (1,1,-1).Therefore, on plane SBA, direction vector (1,0,-1); on plane SCD, direction vector (1,1,-1).Now, the angle between these two direction vectors will be the dihedral angle. So compute the angle between vectors (1,0,-1) and (1,1,-1).Compute the dot product:(1)(1) + (0)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2The magnitude of the first vector: sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = sqrt(2)The magnitude of the second vector: sqrt(1² + 1² + (-1)²) = sqrt(3)Therefore, cosφ = 2 / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(3)) = 2 / sqrt(6) = sqrt(6)/3Then, sinφ = sqrt(1 - (sqrt(6)/3)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 6/9) = sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3)Therefore, tanφ = sinφ / cosφ = (1/sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(6)/3) ) = same as before, equals sqrt(2)/2So both methods give the same result: tanφ = sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, the tangent of the dihedral angle is sqrt(2)/2.But let me check once again with another method to be absolutely sure. Maybe by constructing a triangle where we can measure the tangent directly.Alternatively, since the dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, we can also find a line in each plane, both perpendicular to the line of intersection, and then the angle between these lines is the dihedral angle. Wait, that&#39;s what we just did.Alternatively, we can use the formula for the dihedral angle in terms of coordinates. Let&#39;s consider two adjacent edges or something else. But given that we have consistent results from two different methods, both leading to tanφ = sqrt(2)/2, I think this is correct.But let me just verify with coordinate geometry. Let&#39;s pick a point on the line of intersection, say point S(0,0,1). Then, in plane SBA, take a direction (1,0,-1) as before, and in plane SCD, take direction (1,1,-1). The angle between these two vectors is the dihedral angle. As calculated, tan of that angle is sqrt(2)/2.Alternatively, imagine projecting onto a plane perpendicular to the line of intersection. The dihedral angle can be found by looking at the angle between the projections of the two planes onto this perpendicular plane. But perhaps that&#39;s more complicated.Alternatively, consider the following: in the plane SBA, which is y=0, we can take a point moving along the direction (1,0,-1) from S. For example, from S(0,0,1), moving to (1,0,0) which is point B. Wait, actually, vector SB is (1,0,-1). Similarly, in plane SCD, direction (1,1,-1). From S(0,0,1), moving along direction (1,1,-1) would reach point (1,1,0), which is point C. Wait, but point C is (1,1,0), so vector SC is (1,1,-1). Therefore, the angle between vectors SB and SC is the dihedral angle?Wait, but SB is (1,0,-1) and SC is (1,1,-1). The angle between SB and SC would be the angle between these two vectors. Let&#39;s compute that.Dot product: (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2Magnitude of SB: sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2)Magnitude of SC: sqrt(1² + 1² + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(3)Therefore, cosθ = 2/(sqrt(2)sqrt(3)) = sqrt(6)/3, same as before. Then tanθ = sqrt(2)/2. So this is the same angle as before.But wait, the angle between vectors SB and SC is the same as the dihedral angle? Not exactly, because SB and SC are edges of the pyramid, but they are not both perpendicular to the line of intersection. However, in this case, since we chose vectors SB and SC which lie on their respective planes and are both emanating from S, the angle between them is related to the dihedral angle. But since we already verified using two methods that the tangent is sqrt(2)/2, and this third method also gives the same result when calculating tanθ, perhaps this is correct.Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(2)/2, which can be written as boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}}.Final AnswerThe tangent of the dihedral angle is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the tangent of the dihedral angle formed by the faces (SCD) and (SBA) in the quadrilateral pyramid (S-ABCD) with a right trapezoid base, we start by assigning coordinates to the vertices based on the given information.1. Assigning Coordinates:   - (A(0, 0, 0))   - (B(1, 0, 0))   - (C(1, 1, 0))   - (D(0, frac{1}{2}, 0))   - (S(0, 0, 1))2. Finding Normal Vectors:   - Plane (SBA): Points (S(0, 0, 1)), (B(1, 0, 0)), (A(0, 0, 0)).

The normal vector is calculated using the cross product of vectors (SC) and (SD):     [     text{Normal vector} = left(-frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{1}{2}right)     ]3. Calculating the Angle Between Normal Vectors:   - Dot Product:     [     left(0, 1, 0right) cdot left(-frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{1}{2}right) = 1     ]   - Magnitudes:     [     |(0, 1, 0)| = 1, quad left|left(-frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{1}{2}right)right| = sqrt{frac{3}{2}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{2}     ]   - Cross Product:     [     (0, 1, 0) times left(-frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{1}{2}right) = left(frac{1}{2}, 0, frac{1}{2}right)     ]   - Magnitude of Cross Product:     [     left|left(frac{1}{2}, 0, frac{1}{2}right)right| = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}     ]4. Calculating Sine and Cosine:   - Sine:     [     sin theta = frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{1 cdot frac{sqrt{6}}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{6}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}     ]   - Cosine:     [     cos theta = frac{1}{1 cdot frac{sqrt{6}}{2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{6}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}     ]5.

So we have a quadratic function f(x) = ax² - 2ax + c. The problem says it&#39;s monotonically decreasing in the interval [0, 1], and we need to find the range of the real number n such that f(n) ≤ f(0). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.First, since it&#39;s a quadratic function, its graph is a parabola. The general form is ax² + bx + c, so in this case, the coefficients are: a (the coefficient of x²), -2a (the coefficient of x), and c (the constant term). The first thing I remember is that the direction the parabola opens depends on the coefficient a. If a is positive, it opens upwards, and if a is negative, it opens downwards.Next, the problem mentions that the function is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0, 1]. Monotonic decreasing means that as x increases, f(x) decreases. For a quadratic function, the function will decrease on one side of the vertex and increase on the other. Since it&#39;s a parabola, the vertex is the point where it changes direction. So, if the function is decreasing on [0, 1], that interval must lie on the side of the vertex where the function is decreasing.To find where the function is increasing or decreasing, we can look at the derivative. Let me compute the derivative of f(x):f&#39;(x) = 2ax - 2a.Since the function is decreasing on [0, 1], the derivative must be less than or equal to zero in that interval. So, for all x in [0, 1], 2ax - 2a ≤ 0. Let&#39;s simplify that inequality:2a(x - 1) ≤ 0.Dividing both sides by 2 (which is positive, so inequality direction stays the same):a(x - 1) ≤ 0.So, in the interval [0, 1], (x - 1) ranges from -1 (when x=0) to 0 (when x=1). So (x - 1) is negative or zero in [0,1].Therefore, for a(x - 1) ≤ 0 in [0,1], since (x - 1) is negative or zero, the product a(x - 1) will be ≤ 0 only if a is positive. Because a positive number multiplied by a negative number (x -1) is negative, which is ≤0. If a were negative, then a(x -1) would be positive (since negative times negative is positive), which would not satisfy the inequality. So, this tells me that a must be positive.Therefore, a &gt; 0.So, the parabola opens upwards, and since the derivative is 2a(x -1), the vertex is at x =1. Because the derivative is zero when x =1. So the vertex is at x=1. Since a &gt;0, the parabola opens upwards, so the function decreases to the left of the vertex (x=1) and increases to the right. Therefore, on the interval [0,1], which is to the left of the vertex, the function is decreasing. That makes sense with the given information.Now, the next part is that f(n) ≤ f(0). We need to find the range of n for which this holds.First, let&#39;s compute f(0). Plugging x=0 into f(x):f(0) = a*(0)^2 - 2a*(0) + c = c.So f(0) = c.Now, we need f(n) ≤ c. Let&#39;s write out f(n):f(n) = a*n² - 2a*n + c.So the inequality is:a*n² - 2a*n + c ≤ c.Subtract c from both sides:a*n² - 2a*n ≤ 0.Factor out a*n:a*n(n - 2) ≤ 0.So, the inequality a*n(n - 2) ≤ 0.We already know that a &gt; 0 from earlier. Since a is positive, we can divide both sides of the inequality by a without changing the inequality direction:n(n - 2) ≤ 0.So, we need to solve n(n - 2) ≤ 0.This is a quadratic inequality. Let&#39;s find the critical points where the expression equals zero:n(n - 2) = 0 =&gt; n = 0 or n = 2.These points divide the number line into intervals. Let&#39;s test the intervals:1. When n &lt; 0: Let&#39;s pick n = -1. Then (-1)(-1 - 2) = (-1)(-3) = 3 &gt; 0.2. When 0 &lt; n &lt; 2: Let&#39;s pick n = 1. Then (1)(1 - 2) = (1)(-1) = -1 &lt; 0.3. When n &gt; 2: Let&#39;s pick n = 3. Then (3)(3 - 2) = 3*1 = 3 &gt; 0.So, the inequality n(n - 2) ≤ 0 holds when n is between 0 and 2, inclusive. So the solution is 0 ≤ n ≤ 2.But wait, we need to check if this is correct in the context of the function&#39;s behavior. Let me think again.Given that the function is decreasing on [0, 1], and we found that a &gt;0, vertex at x=1, decreasing to the left of the vertex (so for x &lt;1). Since the parabola opens upwards, after the vertex (x &gt;1), the function starts increasing.So, f(n) ≤ f(0) = c. Since the function decreases from x approaching 1 from the left, reaching the minimum at x=1, then increases again. So f(1) is the minimum value. Therefore, the function&#39;s value at x=1 is the smallest, and as we move left from x=1 to x=0, the function increases (since it&#39;s decreasing on [0,1], wait, no, if it&#39;s decreasing on [0,1], then moving from x=0 to x=1, the function decreases. Wait, but since the vertex is at x=1, the function decreases all the way to x=1. So from x approaching negative infinity up to x=1, the function is decreasing? Wait, but the derivative is 2a(x -1). If a &gt;0, then the derivative is negative when x &lt;1 (since x-1 is negative), zero at x=1, and positive when x &gt;1. Therefore, the function is decreasing for x &lt;1 and increasing for x &gt;1. So on the interval (-∞, 1) it&#39;s decreasing, and (1, ∞) increasing. Therefore, the function&#39;s minimum is at x=1.But the problem states that it is monotonically decreasing on [0,1]. Which is consistent with the above, since [0,1] is within (-∞,1). So the function is decreasing on [0,1], reaches its minimum at x=1, and then starts increasing.Therefore, the function&#39;s value at x=0 is c, as we saw, then decreases to f(1), then increases again. Therefore, if we want f(n) ≤ f(0) = c, then n must be in the region where the function is less than or equal to c. Since the function decreases from x=0 to x=1, so between x=0 and x=1, f(n) is less than or equal to c (since it&#39;s decreasing). Then, after x=1, the function starts increasing. So once it starts increasing, will it ever exceed c again?Wait, let&#39;s check. At x=1, f(1) = a(1)^2 -2a(1) + c = a -2a + c = -a + c. Since a &gt;0, f(1) = c - a &lt; c. Then, as x increases beyond 1, the function increases. So when x=2, f(2) = a(4) -2a(2) + c = 4a -4a + c = c. So f(2) = c. Then, for x &gt;2, since the function is increasing, f(x) will be greater than c. For x between 1 and 2, the function increases from f(1) = c -a to f(2) = c. So between x=1 and x=2, the function is increasing from c -a to c. So, in that interval, f(n) is between c -a and c. Therefore, for n in [1, 2], f(n) ≤ c.Wait, but at x=2, f(2) = c. So f(n) ≤ c holds for n ≤2? Wait, but when n &lt;0, as in the previous analysis, we saw that for n &lt;0, the expression n(n-2) is positive, so a*n(n -2) ≤0 would require a*n(n -2) ≤0. But since a &gt;0, then n(n -2) ≤0. So when n &lt;0, n(n -2) is positive, so that would not satisfy the inequality. So for n &lt;0, f(n) = a*n² -2a*n +c. Let&#39;s take a specific example. Let&#39;s say a=1, c=0. Then f(n) = n² -2n. Then f(0)=0. So f(n) ≤0 would be n² -2n ≤0, which is n(n -2) ≤0, so 0 ≤n ≤2, which is consistent. If we take n=-1, then f(-1) =1 +2=3, which is greater than 0. So even though the function is decreasing on [0,1], when we go left of 0 (n &lt;0), the function is increasing because the function is decreasing on (-∞,1). Wait, but if the function is decreasing on (-∞,1), then as x increases towards 1, the function decreases. So, as x decreases (goes left from 1), the function increases. Therefore, for n &lt;0, as n decreases (more negative), the function value increases. Therefore, f(n) would be greater than f(0)=c when n &lt;0, so those points would not satisfy f(n) ≤ c. Therefore, the only n where f(n) ≤ c are those where n is between 0 and 2, inclusive. Because from n=0 to n=1, the function decreases to c -a at n=1, then increases back to c at n=2. So between 0 and 2, the function is ≤c. For n &gt;2, the function increases beyond c, and for n &lt;0, the function also is greater than c. So the solution is 0 ≤n ≤2.But wait, the original problem says &quot;the quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 - 2ax + c is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0, 1]&quot;. So we need to confirm that our analysis holds here. Since the function is decreasing on [0,1], and as we saw, the function is decreasing on (-∞,1), so it&#39;s decreasing on [0,1] as a subset. Then, the function&#39;s minimum is at x=1, and it&#39;s c - a. Then, as x increases past 1, the function increases back to c at x=2. So, for all n between 0 and 2, inclusive, f(n) ≤ c. Hence, the range of n is [0, 2].Therefore, the answer should be 0 ≤n ≤2, or in interval notation [0,2]. Let me verify with an example. Let&#39;s take a=1, c=0. Then f(x)=x² -2x. f(0)=0. The function is decreasing on (-∞,1), so certainly on [0,1]. Then f(n)=n² -2n ≤0. So n² -2n ≤0 → n(n-2) ≤0 → 0≤n≤2. Which matches. If I take a=2, c=5, then f(x)=2x² -4x +5. Then f(0)=5. Then f(n)=2n² -4n +5 ≤5. Subtract 5: 2n² -4n ≤0 → 2n(n -2) ≤0. Since 2 is positive, divide both sides: n(n -2) ≤0 → same result, 0≤n≤2. So regardless of a&gt;0 and c, the result is the same. Therefore, the range is [0,2].Final AnswerThe range of the real number ( n ) is boxed{[0, 2]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the quadratic function ( f(x) = ax^2 - 2ax + c ), we know it is monotonically decreasing in the interval ([0, 1]). To determine the range of ( n ) such that ( f(n) leq f(0) ):1. Derivative Analysis:   - The derivative of ( f(x) ) is ( f&#39;(x) = 2ax - 2a ).   - For ( f(x) ) to be monotonically decreasing in ([0, 1]), ( f&#39;(x) leq 0 ) in this interval.   - Simplifying ( 2a(x - 1) leq 0 ) leads to ( a &gt; 0 ).2. Vertex and Behavior:   - The vertex of the parabola is at ( x = 1 ).   - Since ( a &gt; 0 ), the parabola opens upwards, decreasing for ( x &lt; 1 ) and increasing for ( x &gt; 1 ).3. Function Values:   - ( f(0) = c ).   - We need ( f(n) leq c ). Substituting ( f(n) ) gives ( an^2 - 2an + c leq c ).   - Simplifying, we get ( an(n - 2) leq 0 ). Since ( a &gt; 0 ), this reduces to ( n(n - 2) leq 0 ).4. Solving the Inequality:   - The critical points are ( n = 0 ) and ( n = 2 ).   - The inequality ( n(n - 2) leq 0 ) holds for ( 0 leq n leq 2 ).Thus, the range of the real number ( n ) is (boxed{[0, 2]}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the range of the real number n such that f(n) ≤ f(0) for the quadratic function f(x) = ax² - 2ax + c. Also, it&#39;s given that the function is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0,1]. Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding what each part means.First, the function is quadratic. The general form is f(x) = ax² + bx + c. In this case, it&#39;s given as ax² - 2ax + c. So, comparing to the standard form, the coefficients are: a (same as given), b = -2a, and c is the constant term.Since it&#39;s a quadratic function, its graph is a parabola. The direction in which the parabola opens (upward or downward) depends on the coefficient a. If a &gt; 0, it opens upward; if a &lt; 0, it opens downward.Now, the problem states that the function is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0,1]. Monotonic decreasing means that as x increases, f(x) decreases. For a quadratic function, which has a vertex, the function is decreasing on one side of the vertex and increasing on the other. So, the interval [0,1] must lie entirely on the decreasing side of the parabola.First, let&#39;s find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex for a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c is given by -b/(2a). In our case, b is -2a, so:x_vertex = -(-2a)/(2a) = 2a/(2a) = 1.So, the vertex is at x = 1. Since the vertex of a parabola is where it changes direction, this means that if a &gt; 0, the parabola opens upward, and the function is decreasing to the left of the vertex and increasing to the right. Conversely, if a &lt; 0, it opens downward, decreasing to the right of the vertex and increasing to the left.But wait, the problem says the function is monotonically decreasing in [0,1]. So, the interval [0,1] must be on the side of the vertex where the function is decreasing. Let&#39;s analyze this.If the vertex is at x = 1, then:- If a &gt; 0: The parabola opens upward. So, the function is decreasing on (-∞, 1] and increasing on [1, ∞). But the interval [0,1] is just to the left of the vertex. So in this case, the function is decreasing on [0,1], which matches the problem&#39;s condition.- If a &lt; 0: The parabola opens downward. Then the function is increasing on (-∞, 1] and decreasing on [1, ∞). So, the interval [0,1] would be on the increasing side if a &lt; 0, which contradicts the given that it&#39;s decreasing on [0,1]. Therefore, a must be positive.Therefore, we can conclude that a &gt; 0.So, a &gt; 0, and the vertex is at x = 1. Since a &gt; 0, the parabola opens upward, decreasing on (-∞, 1] and increasing on [1, ∞). Therefore, in the interval [0,1], which is entirely to the left of the vertex, the function is decreasing, which matches the problem&#39;s statement.So, we know a &gt; 0.Now, the problem asks for the range of real number n such that f(n) ≤ f(0). Let&#39;s compute f(0) first.f(0) = a*(0)^2 - 2a*(0) + c = c.So, f(0) = c. Therefore, we need to find all real numbers n where f(n) ≤ c.So, f(n) = a*n² - 2a*n + c ≤ c. Let&#39;s subtract c from both sides:a*n² - 2a*n ≤ 0.Factor out a:a(n² - 2n) ≤ 0.Since a &gt; 0 (from earlier), we can divide both sides by a without changing the inequality direction:n² - 2n ≤ 0.So, n² - 2n ≤ 0. Let&#39;s solve this inequality.First, factor the quadratic:n(n - 2) ≤ 0.To solve n(n - 2) ≤ 0, find the critical points where the expression equals zero: n = 0 and n = 2.These points divide the real line into three intervals:1. n &lt; 0,2. 0 &lt; n &lt; 2,3. n &gt; 2.Test each interval to see where the product is ≤ 0.- For n &lt; 0: Let&#39;s pick n = -1. (-1)(-1 - 2) = (-1)(-3) = 3 &gt; 0.- For 0 &lt; n &lt; 2: Let&#39;s pick n = 1. (1)(1 - 2) = (1)(-1) = -1 &lt; 0.- For n &gt; 2: Let&#39;s pick n = 3. (3)(3 - 2) = (3)(1) = 3 &gt; 0.So, the inequality n(n - 2) ≤ 0 holds when 0 ≤ n ≤ 2. Including the endpoints because the inequality is ≤ 0, and at n = 0 and n = 2, the expression equals 0.Therefore, the solution to the inequality is n ∈ [0, 2]. So, does that mean the range of n is [0, 2]?Wait a minute, but let me make sure. The function f(n) ≤ f(0) would correspond to n values where the parabola is below or equal to f(0) = c.But since the parabola opens upward (a &gt; 0), its minimum is at the vertex x = 1. The value at the vertex is f(1) = a*(1)^2 - 2a*(1) + c = a - 2a + c = -a + c.Since the parabola opens upward, the function decreases from x = -∞ up to x = 1, reaching the minimum at x =1, then increases towards +∞. Therefore, the values of f(n) will be less than or equal to f(0) only between the points where f(n) = f(0). Since f(0) = c, and the function is decreasing from -∞ to 1, then increasing from 1 onwards, the equation f(n) = c will have two solutions: one at n = 0 and another at n = 2.Wait, let&#39;s check that. If we set f(n) = c:a*n² - 2a*n + c = cSubtract c from both sides:a*n² - 2a*n = 0Factor:a*n(n - 2) = 0Since a ≠ 0 (as a &gt; 0), the solutions are n = 0 and n = 2.Therefore, the parabola crosses the line y = c at n = 0 and n = 2. Since the parabola opens upwards, between these two points, the function is below y = c. So, the inequality f(n) ≤ c holds for n between 0 and 2. Therefore, n ∈ [0, 2].But wait, the problem says &quot;the quadratic function is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0,1]&quot;. We already considered that and found a &gt; 0. So, is there any other condition that might affect the range of n?Wait, the problem is asking for all real numbers n where f(n) ≤ f(0). From our analysis, this is n ∈ [0, 2]. But let me visualize the parabola to check.The vertex is at x =1, which is the minimum point since a &gt; 0. The function decreases from left (x approaching -∞) up to x =1, then increases. So, when x approaches -∞, the function tends to +∞ because a &gt; 0. So, the function decreases from +∞ to the minimum at x =1, then increases back to +∞.At x =0, f(0) = c. At x =2, f(2) = a*(4) - 2a*(2) + c = 4a -4a + c = c. Therefore, the points x=0 and x=2 both have the same function value c, which is higher than the minimum at x=1 (which is c -a). Therefore, the graph of the function is a U-shaped curve opening upwards, with vertex at (1, c -a), crossing y = c at x=0 and x=2. Therefore, between x=0 and x=2, the function is below or equal to c, which is f(0). So, indeed, the solution is n ∈ [0,2].But wait, the problem statement says &quot;the quadratic function is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0,1]&quot;. Since we found that a &gt;0 and the function is decreasing on (-∞,1], which includes [0,1], that&#39;s consistent. So, given that, the answer should be n ∈ [0,2].But let me check again.Wait, if the function is decreasing on [0,1], and since the vertex is at x=1, then from x=1 onwards, the function starts increasing. So, for x &gt;1, the function increases. Therefore, after x=1, as n increases beyond 1, f(n) increases. Since f(1) is the minimum value. So, to find n such that f(n) ≤ f(0) = c, we have two intervals:From x approaching -∞ to x=0, the function is decreasing from +∞ down to f(0)=c. Then from x=0 to x=1, it continues decreasing to the minimum at x=1. Then from x=1 to x=2, it increases back up to f(2)=c, and then continues increasing to +∞.Wait, hold on. If the vertex is at x=1, and the parabola opens upwards, then from x=-∞ to x=1, it&#39;s decreasing, and from x=1 to x=+∞, it&#39;s increasing. Therefore, when moving from left to right:- Before x=0, the function is decreasing. At x=0, it&#39;s at c. Then from x=0 to x=1, it continues decreasing to the minimum at x=1 (which is c - a), then increases back to c at x=2, and beyond.Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, no. If the vertex is at x=1, then the function is decreasing on (-∞,1], so from x=-∞ to x=1, it&#39;s decreasing. Then increasing on [1, ∞). So, at x=0, which is left of the vertex, it&#39;s decreasing. So, as x increases from -∞ to 1, f(x) decreases. Therefore, at x=0, the function value is higher than at x=1. Then, as x increases past 1, the function increases again.Therefore, f(0) = c, f(1) = c -a, f(2) = c. So, between x=0 and x=2, the function goes from c down to c -a and back up to c. So, the graph is a U-shape with the bottom at x=1. Therefore, the function is ≤ c between x=0 and x=2. Therefore, for all n between 0 and 2, f(n) ≤ c = f(0). So, the range is [0,2].But wait, is that correct? Let&#39;s check with specific numbers. Suppose a=1, c=0. So, f(x) = x² - 2x. Then f(0) = 0. f(n) = n² -2n. We want n² -2n ≤ 0. Solving n(n-2) ≤0, which gives 0 ≤n ≤2. The vertex is at x=1, f(1)= -1. So, between x=0 and x=2, the function is below or equal to 0. That&#39;s correct.Therefore, the answer should be n ∈ [0,2]. So, the range is from 0 to 2, including the endpoints.Therefore, the range of the real number n is [0,2].Final AnswerThe range of the real number ( n ) is boxed{[0, 2]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the quadratic function ( f(x) = ax^2 - 2ax + c ) which is monotonically decreasing in the interval ([0, 1]), we need to determine the range of the real number ( n ) such that ( f(n) leq f(0) ).1. Vertex Calculation:   - The vertex of the quadratic function ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ) is at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ).   - For the given function, ( b = -2a ), so the vertex is at ( x = frac{-(-2a)}{2a} = 1 ).2. Monotonicity Analysis:   - Since the function is monotonically decreasing in ([0, 1]), the parabola must open upwards (i.e., ( a &gt; 0 )). This is because a parabola opening upwards decreases to the left of the vertex and increases to the right.3. Function Values:   - The value of the function at ( x = 0 ) is ( f(0) = c ).   - We need to find ( n ) such that ( f(n) leq c ).4. Solving the Inequality:   - Set ( f(n) leq f(0) ):     [     an^2 - 2an + c leq c     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     an^2 - 2an leq 0 implies a(n^2 - 2n) leq 0     ]   - Since ( a &gt; 0 ), divide both sides by ( a ):     [     n^2 - 2n leq 0 implies n(n - 2) leq 0     ]5. Solving the Quadratic Inequality:   - The critical points are ( n = 0 ) and ( n = 2 ).   - The inequality ( n(n - 2) leq 0 ) holds for ( 0 leq n leq 2 ).6. Conclusion:   - The function ( f(n) leq f(0) ) for ( n ) in the interval ([0, 2]).Thus, the range of the real number ( n ) is (boxed{[0, 2]}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2ace701f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2ace701f><span class="icon" data-v-2ace701f>🔑:</span>The range of n is boxed{[0, 2]}.Key Point: Properties of quadratic functions.Special Topic: Calculation problems; properties and applications of functions.Analysis: The axis of symmetry of the graph of the quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 - 2ax + c is x = 1; hence, we can deduce that a &gt; 0.

The axis of symmetry of the graph of the quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 - 2ax + c is x = 1;Since the quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 - 2ax + c is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0, 1],It follows that a &gt; 0;Therefore, from f(n) leq f(0), we know|n - 1| leq |0 - 1|;Hence, the range of the real number n is [0, 2],So, the answer is boxed{[0, 2]}.Review: This question examines the properties of quadratic functions and the judgment and application of their graphs, belonging to a basic problem.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-c67266a5><span data-v-c67266a5>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
