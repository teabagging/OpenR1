Hmm, I remember there&#39;s something called the ballot theorem or something like that in probability. Maybe that&#39;s related?Let me recall. The ballot problem, right? The classic question is: if candidate A gets n votes and candidate B gets m votes, what&#39;s the probability that A is always ahead of B when counting the votes. The formula for that, if I remember correctly, is (n - m)/(n + m). Wait, is that the probability or the number of ways? Maybe it&#39;s the number of favorable paths divided by the total number of paths. Let me check my reasoning.First, the total number of possible ways to count the votes is the combination of (n + m) votes taken n at a time, which is C(n + m, n). Because you&#39;re essentially arranging n votes for A and m votes for B in some order.Now, the number of favorable sequences where A is always ahead. The formula from the ballot theorem says that the number of such sequences is (n - m)/(n + m) multiplied by the total number of sequences. Wait, no, the ballot theorem states that the probability is (n - m)/(n + m). Let me verify.Ballot theorem: If candidate A receives n votes and candidate B receives m votes with n &gt; m, then the number of ways to arrange the votes such that A is always ahead in the count is (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). Therefore, the probability would be this divided by C(n + m, n), which simplifies to (n - m)/(n + m). So yes, the probability is (n - m)/(n + m).But wait, let me think through why that is the case. I want to make sure I&#39;m not just recalling the formula but actually understanding it. Maybe I can use reflection principle or something similar.The reflection principle is often used in combinatorics for problems involving paths that cross a certain boundary. For instance, in the classic problem of the number of paths from (0,0) to (a,b) that don&#39;t cross a certain line. Here, we can model the vote counting as a path where each step is +1 in the x-direction for a vote for A and +1 in the y-direction for a vote for B. We start at (0,0) and end at (n,m). The condition that A is always ahead translates to the path never touching the line y = x (except at the start). Wait, actually, since we want A&#39;s cumulative count to always exceed B&#39;s, that would mean the path stays strictly above the line y = x - 1? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let&#39;s see.If we consider the vote count as a sequence, each vote for A increases A&#39;s count by 1, each vote for B increases B&#39;s count by 1. At any point, the cumulative votes for A must be greater than for B. So, after k votes, if there are a votes for A and b votes for B, we need a &gt; b for all k. Since a + b = k, this translates to a &gt; k/2. So, the path must never reach a point where B&#39;s votes are equal to or exceed A&#39;s votes.This is similar to Dyck paths but with different parameters. In Dyck paths, we have paths that stay above the diagonal, which is similar but for a different ratio. The standard Dyck path problem is when you have an equal number of up and down steps, but here n and m can be different.The formula from the ballot theorem is indeed (n - m)/(n + m) for the probability. But let me try to derive it to make sure.Using the reflection principle: the total number of paths is C(n + m, n). The number of paths where A is always ahead can be calculated by subtracting the number of bad paths (those where B ties or overtakes A at some point) from the total.To compute the number of bad paths, we can use the reflection principle. For any bad path, there is a first point where B catches up to A. If we reflect the path from that point onward, swapping A and B steps, we get a path that ends at (n - 1, m + 1). Wait, this might be similar to the original reflection principle argument.In the reflection principle, the number of bad paths that cross the boundary can be reflected to a different endpoint. The formula for the number of such paths is C(n + m, m - 1). Therefore, the number of good paths is C(n + m, n) - C(n + m, m - 1). Then the probability is [C(n + m, n) - C(n + m, m - 1)] / C(n + m, n).Simplifying that expression: [C(n + m, n) - C(n + m, m - 1)] / C(n + m, n) = 1 - [C(n + m, m - 1)/C(n + m, n)].But C(n + m, m - 1) = C(n + m, n + 1), because C(a, b) = C(a, a - b). So, substituting:1 - [C(n + m, n + 1)/C(n + m, n)].Calculating the ratio C(n + m, n + 1)/C(n + m, n):C(n + m, n + 1) = (n + m)! / [(n + 1)! (m - 1)!] and C(n + m, n) = (n + m)! / [n! m!].So the ratio is [ (n + m)! / ((n + 1)! (m - 1)!)) ] / [ (n + m)! / (n! m!) ) ] = [n! m!] / [ (n + 1)! (m - 1)! ) ] = [m / (n + 1)].Therefore, the probability is 1 - [m / (n + 1)] = (n + 1 - m)/(n + 1). Wait, but this contradicts the ballot theorem formula I mentioned earlier. Hmm, so maybe my reflection principle approach is missing something.Wait, perhaps the reflection principle is applied differently here. Let me check another source.Actually, in the standard ballot theorem, the number of paths where A is always ahead is (n - m)/n * C(n + m, n). But that doesn&#39;t seem right. Wait, no.Wait, let me refer back to the correct formula. The ballot theorem states that the number of ways that A is always ahead is (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). Therefore, the probability is (n - m)/(n + m). However, my reflection principle approach gave me (n + 1 - m)/(n + 1). These are different. So where did I go wrong?Wait, perhaps my reflection principle was applied incorrectly. Let me think again.The reflection principle for the ballot problem: Suppose we want to count the number of paths that reach (n, m) without ever crossing the line y = x. The formula for that is C(n + m, m) - C(n + m, m - 1). Wait, but in this case, our condition is that A is always strictly ahead, which is equivalent to the path never touching the line y = x. So the number of such paths is C(n + m, m) - C(n + m, m - 1). Then the probability is [C(n + m, m) - C(n + m, m - 1)] / C(n + m, m).But C(n + m, m) is the same as C(n + m, n). So substituting, the probability is [C(n + m, n) - C(n + m, n + 1)] / C(n + m, n). Which is 1 - [C(n + m, n + 1)/C(n + m, n)].As before, that ratio is [C(n + m, n + 1)/C(n + m, n)] = [ (n + m)! / ( (n + 1)! (m - 1)! ) ) ] / [ (n + m)! / (n! m! ) ] = (n! m!) / ( (n + 1)! (m - 1)! ) ) = (m) / (n + 1).Therefore, the probability is 1 - m/(n + 1) = (n + 1 - m)/ (n + 1). But according to the ballot theorem, the probability should be (n - m)/(n + m). These two expressions are different. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning here.Wait, maybe the problem is that the reflection principle is being applied to a different problem. Let me check.The standard ballot theorem says: In an election where candidate A receives n votes and candidate B receives m votes with n &gt; m, the number of ways the votes can be ordered so that A is always ahead of B during the count is (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). Therefore, the probability is (n - m)/(n + m).But according to the reflection principle approach I tried earlier, the probability is (n + 1 - m)/(n + 1). These two can&#39;t both be right. So where is the disconnect?Wait, perhaps the reflection principle applies to a different problem. Let&#39;s check the assumptions. In the problem I considered, we have a path from (0,0) to (n, m), staying above the line y = x. But in reality, the condition is that at every step, the number of A votes exceeds the number of B votes. That is, after k votes, A has more votes than B. So, for each k, if we let a be the number of A votes and b be the number of B votes after k votes, then a &gt; b. Since a + b = k, this implies that a &gt; k/2, so A must have more than half of the votes at every stage. But this is only possible if n &gt; m, which is given.But how does this relate to the reflection principle? Let&#39;s see.In the reflection principle for the ballot problem: For any path that starts at (0,0) and ends at (n,m) with n &gt; m, the number of such paths that cross the line y = x can be calculated by reflecting the path at the first point where it touches the line. The number of such reflected paths is equal to the number of paths that start at (0,0) and end at (m - 1, n + 1). Wait, perhaps?Alternatively, in the standard reflection principle for walks starting at (0,0) and ending at (n,m), the number of paths that touch or cross the line y = x + t can be calculated by some reflection.Wait, maybe I need to adjust the reflection principle here. Let me recall.In the classic ballot problem, the probability that A stays ahead of B throughout the counting is (n - m)/(n + m). The formula can be derived using the principle of inclusion-exclusion with reflections.Alternatively, there&#39;s a proof by Dvoretzky and Motzkin which uses a cyclic argument.Wait, another way to think about this is to consider all permutations of the votes. The total number is (n + m)!/(n! m!) as combinations. The number of favorable permutations is equal to the total number minus the number of permutations where at some point B is ahead or tied.But calculating that directly is tricky. However, using the reflection principle, when you have a path that at some point reaches a tie, you can reflect the path after the first tie to get a correspondence with some other paths.Wait, let me try again. Suppose we have a path where A&#39;s votes are never ahead. Then the first vote must be for B. But in our problem, we need paths where A is always ahead. So the first vote must be for A. Then, after that, at no point does B&#39;s count equal or exceed A&#39;s.But maybe using the reflection principle, the number of such paths is equal to the total number of paths starting with A minus the number of paths that at some point reach a tie.Alternatively, using André&#39;s reflection method. Let&#39;s see.In the André reflection method for the ballot problem, the number of paths from (0,0) to (n,m) that never touch the line y = x is given by C(n + m - 1, m - 1) - C(n + m - 1, m). Wait, no, that seems off.Alternatively, the formula for the number of paths that never cross the diagonal is C(n + m, m) - C(n + m, m - 1). Then, the probability is [C(n + m, m) - C(n + m, m - 1)] / C(n + m, m) = 1 - [C(n + m, m - 1)/C(n + m, m)] = 1 - [m/(n + 1)].Wait, so that gives the probability as (n + 1 - m)/(n + 1), which is different from the ballot theorem&#39;s (n - m)/(n + m). So clearly, I&#39;m mixing up different problems here.Wait, maybe the difference is in the model. In some versions, the paths are constrained to start with a vote for A, but in others, they can start with either. Wait, in our problem, since we require that A is always ahead, the first vote must be for A. Otherwise, if the first vote is for B, then at that point, B is ahead, which violates the condition. Therefore, the first vote must be for A. Then, we have to count the number of paths from (1,0) to (n,m) that never touch the line y = x - 1. Hmm, because after the first vote for A, we are at (1,0), and we need to ensure that for all subsequent steps, the number of A votes remains greater than B votes. So, the remaining votes are (n - 1) A&#39;s and m B&#39;s, and we need the path from (1,0) to (n,m) to never touch the line y = x - 1. Because at any point, the number of A votes is x and B votes is y, so x &gt; y =&gt; x - 1 &gt;= y. So the line is y = x - 1.So now, applying the reflection principle for paths from (1,0) to (n,m) that never touch y = x - 1. The number of such paths is equal to the total number of paths from (1,0) to (n,m) minus the number of paths that do touch y = x - 1.To compute the number of paths that touch y = x - 1, we can reflect the starting point over the line y = x - 1. The reflection of (1,0) over the line y = x - 1 is found by switching x and y and adjusting for the line. Let me recall how reflection works. For a point (a,b), its reflection over the line y = x - c would be (b + c, a - c). Wait, maybe? Let me check.Alternatively, the line y = x - 1 can be rewritten as x - y = 1. The reflection of a point (p, q) across the line ax + by + c = 0 is given by a formula. But maybe this is getting too complicated.Alternatively, consider that a path starting at (1,0) and touching the line y = x - 1 must first touch that line at some point. Reflecting the portion of the path from the start to that first touch across the line y = x - 1 would give a path starting at a different point. Let me try to visualize.Suppose the original path starts at (1,0) and first touches y = x - 1 at point (k, k - 1). Reflecting the path from (1,0) to (k, k - 1) across the line y = x - 1 would map it to a path from some other starting point to (k, k - 1). What&#39;s the reflection of (1,0) over y = x - 1?To find the reflection of the point (1,0) over the line y = x - 1, we can use the formula for reflecting a point over a line. The formula is:If we have a line ax + by + c = 0, then the reflection of a point (x0, y0) is:( x0 - 2a(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²), y0 - 2b(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²) )The line y = x - 1 can be rewritten as x - y - 1 = 0. So a = 1, b = -1, c = -1.So the reflection of (1,0):Compute ax0 + by0 + c = 1*1 + (-1)*0 -1 = 1 - 0 -1 = 0. Wait, that&#39;s zero, meaning the point is on the line. But (1,0) is not on the line y = x -1. Wait, plugging into y = x -1: 0 = 1 -1 = 0. Oh, actually, (1,0) is on the line y = x -1. Wait, because y = 0, x -1 = 0, so x =1. So (1,0) is on the line. Therefore, reflecting (1,0) over the line y = x -1 would give the same point. That complicates things.Hmm, perhaps this approach isn&#39;t correct. Maybe I need a different method.Wait, another way to approach this is to use the formula for the ballot problem directly. The standard ballot theorem states that if candidate A receives n votes and candidate B receives m votes with n &gt; m, then the number of ways the votes can be ordered such that A is always ahead in the count is (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). Therefore, the probability is (n - m)/(n + m).But how is this derived? Let me check the proof.One classic proof uses the concept of &quot;excess&quot; votes. The idea is that for A to stay ahead throughout the counting, the number of votes for A must always exceed the number for B. The first vote must be for A. Then, after the first vote, we have a situation where there are n -1 votes for A and m votes for B left, and we need the remaining sequence to never let B catch up.But how does that lead to the formula?Alternatively, consider the total number of sequences where A is always ahead. The reflection principle states that the number of such sequences is equal to the total number of sequences starting with A minus the number of sequences that, after some point, B overtakes A. But how to count those?Alternatively, use a recursive approach. Let P(n, m) be the number of sequences where A is always ahead. The first vote must be for A, so P(n, m) = P(n -1, m) + ... Wait, but that might not be straightforward.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach inspired by the Catalan numbers. In the case where n = m, the number of sequences where A is never behind is the Catalan number C_m. But in this case, n &gt; m.But the formula given by the ballot theorem is (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). Let me test this with small numbers.Suppose n = 2, m =1. Then the probability should be (2 -1)/(2 +1) = 1/3.Total number of sequences: C(3,2) = 3. The possible sequences are AAB, ABA, BAA. Now, check which ones have A always ahead.- AAB: After first vote A (1-0), second vote A (2-0), third vote B (2-1). Always ahead. Good.- ABA: After first A (1-0), then B (1-1) which is tied, so not allowed. So this is bad.- BAA: First vote B (0-1), which is already bad. So only one good sequence: AAB. So probability 1/3, which matches (2 -1)/(2 +1) = 1/3. That works.Another test case: n =3, m=1. Probability should be (3 -1)/(3 +1)= 2/4=1/2.Total sequences: C(4,3)=4. The sequences are AAAB, AABA, ABAA, BAAA.Check which are valid:- AAAB: After each step: 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 3-1. All good.- AABA: After first A (1-0), second A (2-0), third B (2-1), fourth A (3-1). All good.Wait, wait, no. Wait, third step is B, so after third vote it&#39;s 2-1. A is still ahead, so that&#39;s okay.Wait, AABA: Step 1: A (1-0), step 2: A (2-0), step3: B (2-1), step4: A (3-1). All steps A is ahead. So that&#39;s good.ABAA: Step1: A (1-0), step2: B (1-1), which is a tie. So invalid.BAAA: Step1: B (0-1), invalid.So out of 4 sequences, 2 are valid: AAAB and AABA. Thus, probability 2/4=1/2, which matches the formula (3-1)/(3+1)=1/2.Good. Another test case: n=3, m=2. Probability (3-2)/(3+2)=1/5.Total sequences: C(5,3)=10. Let&#39;s list them:1. AAABB2. AABAB3. ABAAB4. BAAAB5. AABBA6. ABABA7. BAABA8. ABBAA9. BABAA10. BBAAANow, check which sequences have A always ahead.1. AAABB: Count as we go:- A (1-0)- A (2-0)- A (3-0)- B (3-1)- B (3-2). All steps A is ahead. Good.2. AABAB:- A (1-0)- A (2-0)- B (2-1)- A (3-1)- B (3-2). All steps A is ahead. Good.3. ABAAB:- A (1-0)- B (1-1) → Tie. Bad.4. BAAAB:- B (0-1) → Bad.5. AABBA:- A (1-0)- A (2-0)- B (2-1)- B (2-2) → Tie. Bad.6. ABABA:- A (1-0)- B (1-1) → Tie. Bad.7. BAABA:- B (0-1) → Bad.8. ABBAA:- A (1-0)- B (1-1) → Tie. Bad.9. BABAA:- B (0-1) → Bad.10. BBAAA:- B (0-1) → Bad.So only two sequences are valid: 1. AAABB and 2. AABAB. So 2/10=1/5, which matches the formula. Therefore, the formula (n - m)/(n + m) seems correct.So even though my reflection principle approach gave me (n +1 -m)/(n +1), which didn&#39;t match the test cases, the correct answer is indeed (n - m)/(n + m). Therefore, the initial reflection principle approach must have a mistake in the model or the reflection.Perhaps the key difference is in the starting point. In the problem, the first vote must be for A, so the reflection principle needs to account for that. Alternatively, the formula derived from the reflection principle for paths that start with a vote for A and never touch the line y = x.Alternatively, the formula can be derived using generating functions or recursive relations, but given that the test cases confirm the ballot theorem&#39;s formula, I should trust that.Therefore, the probability that A&#39;s cumulative vote count always exceeds B&#39;s during the counting process is (n - m)/(n + m).Final AnswerThe probability is boxed{dfrac{n - m}{n + m}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the probability that candidate A&#39;s cumulative vote count always exceeds candidate B&#39;s cumulative vote count during the vote counting process, we can use the ballot theorem. The ballot theorem states that if candidate A receives ( n ) votes and candidate B receives ( m ) votes with ( n &gt; m ), the probability that A is always ahead in the count is given by:[frac{n - m}{n + m}]This result is derived from the reflection principle in combinatorics, which is used to count the number of paths that stay above a certain line. The key steps are as follows:1. Total Number of Paths: The total number of ways to arrange the votes is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{n + m}{n} ).2. Favorable Paths: The number of favorable paths where A is always ahead can be calculated using the ballot theorem. The theorem states that the number of such paths is ( frac{n - m}{n + m} times binom{n + m}{n} ).3. Probability: The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable paths to the total number of paths. This simplifies to ( frac{n - m}{n + m} ).Testing this formula with small values of ( n ) and ( m ) confirms its correctness. For example:- When ( n = 2 ) and ( m = 1 ), the probability is ( frac{1}{3} ), which matches the manual count.- When ( n = 3 ) and ( m = 1 ), the probability is ( frac{1}{2} ), which also matches the manual count.- When ( n = 3 ) and ( m = 2 ), the probability is ( frac{1}{5} ), which again matches the manual count.Thus, the probability that A&#39;s cumulative vote count always exceeds B&#39;s cumulative vote count during the vote counting process is:[boxed{dfrac{n - m}{n + m}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here about an election between two candidates, A and B. A gets n votes and B gets m votes, and n is greater than m. The question is asking for the probability that during the entire vote counting process, A&#39;s cumulative votes are always more than B&#39;s. Hmm, interesting. I think this is related to some classic probability problems, maybe like the ballot theorem? Let me recall.First, let me try to visualize the problem. Imagine votes are being counted one by one, and we keep a running total for both A and B. We want to make sure that at every step, A&#39;s total is always ahead of B&#39;s. So, for example, if the first vote counted is for A, then A is leading 1-0. If the next vote is for B, then it&#39;s 1-1, which means A is not ahead anymore. So that particular sequence would already fail the condition. But if the first two votes are both for A, then A is leading 2-0, and so on.So the problem reduces to counting all possible sequences of the votes where A is always leading, and then dividing by the total number of possible sequences. The total number of sequences is straightforward: it&#39;s the number of ways to arrange n A votes and m B votes, which is (n + m)! / (n! m!). Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many of these sequences have the property that A is always leading. This seems similar to problems I&#39;ve heard about before, like the Catalan numbers. The Catalan numbers count the number of Dyck paths, which are paths that never dip below the diagonal. Translating that into vote counting terms, it&#39;s like A never trails B. But in our case, we want A to always be strictly ahead, not just not trailing. Wait, but maybe it&#39;s the same as the Dyck path condition? Let me check.The classic ballot theorem states that the number of ways candidate A is always leading in the count is (n - m)/(n + m) multiplied by the total number of ways. Wait, is that right? Let me recall the exact statement. Yes, the ballot theorem says that if candidate A receives n votes and candidate B receives m votes with n &gt; m, then the probability that A is always ahead in the count is (n - m)/(n + m). So is that the answer here? Wait, but I need to confirm this. Let me think through a simple example.Suppose n = 2 and m = 1. Then total sequences are 3: AAB, ABA, BAA. Now, let&#39;s see which sequences have A always leading. AAB: First vote A (1-0), second vote A (2-0), third vote B (2-1). Always leading. ABA: First vote A (1-0), second vote B (1-1), which is a tie. So this doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition.BAA: First vote B (0-1), so already B is leading. So this doesn&#39;t satisfy.So only 1 out of 3 sequences. According to the formula (n - m)/(n + m), that would be (2 - 1)/(2 + 1) = 1/3, which matches. So that works. Let&#39;s check another example.n = 3, m = 1. Total sequences: 4. Let&#39;s list them:AAAB, AABA, ABAA, BAAA.Now check each:AAAB: All A&#39;s first, so always leading. Good.AABA: First A, second A, third B (2-1), fourth A (3-1). But wait, after third vote, it&#39;s 2-1. Wait, actually, after each vote:First vote: A (1-0)Second vote: A (2-0)Third vote: B (2-1)Fourth vote: A (3-1)So yes, always leading. So AABA is okay?Wait, after third vote, A has 2 and B has 1, so A is still leading. So that&#39;s okay. So AABA is acceptable.ABAA: First A (1-0), second B (1-1), which is a tie. So that&#39;s not allowed.BAAA: First B (0-1), so already trailing. Not allowed.So out of 4 sequences, 2 are valid. According to the formula (3 - 1)/(3 + 1) = 2/4 = 1/2. Which matches. So seems correct.Another example: n = 3, m = 2. Then formula gives (3 - 2)/(3 + 2) = 1/5. Let&#39;s check.Total sequences: 5!/(3!2!) = 10. That&#39;s a bit tedious, but let&#39;s try.Possible sequences where A is always leading:We need to list all permutations of AAA BB where at every point, the number of A&#39;s exceeds the number of B&#39;s.First vote must be A. Then, after that, each subsequent vote must maintain A&#39;s lead.This is similar to the Dyck path problem but adjusted for different numbers. The number of such sequences should be equal to the Catalan-like number given by the formula (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). Let me compute that.(n - m)/(n + m) * (n + m)! / (n! m!) = (1/5) * 10 = 2. So according to the formula, there should be 2 valid sequences. Let&#39;s verify.List all sequences starting with A:A _ _ _ _Since first vote is A, remaining votes are AA BB.Possible sequences:1. A A A B B2. A A B A B3. A A B B A4. A B A A B5. A B A B A6. A B B A ANow check each:1. A A A B B:- After 1st vote: A (1-0)- 2nd: A (2-0)- 3rd: A (3-0)- 4th: B (3-1)- 5th: B (3-2). Always leading. So valid.2. A A B A B:- 1: A (1-0)- 2: A (2-0)- 3: B (2-1)- 4: A (3-1)- 5: B (3-2). At every step, A is leading. Valid.3. A A B B A:- 1: A (1-0)- 2: A (2-0)- 3: B (2-1)- 4: B (2-2). Tie here, so invalid.4. A B A A B:- 1: A (1-0)- 2: B (1-1). Tie, invalid.5. A B A B A:- 1: A (1-0)- 2: B (1-1). Tie, invalid.6. A B B A A:- 1: A (1-0)- 2: B (1-1). Tie, invalid.So only sequences 1 and 2 are valid. That&#39;s 2 out of 10 total sequences, which matches the formula&#39;s 1/5 probability (2/10 = 1/5). So that works.Therefore, it seems that the formula given by the ballot theorem is indeed correct for this problem. The probability is (n - m)/(n + m). But wait, let me check the exact statement of the ballot theorem to make sure.The classical ballot theorem states that the number of ways that candidate A is always leading in the count is (n - m)/(n + m) multiplied by the total number of sequences. Hence, the probability is (n - m)/(n + m). So that&#39;s the answer here. But wait, the problem states &quot;the probability that A&#39;s cumulative vote count always exceeds B&#39;s cumulative vote count during the vote counting process&quot;. So yes, exactly the ballot problem.Therefore, the answer should be (n - m)/(n + m). But let me think again.Wait, another way to approach this problem is using reflection principle. Maybe I can derive it.The total number of sequences where A is always ahead can be calculated using the reflection principle. The idea is that any sequence where A is not always ahead can be &quot;reflected&quot; to count the number of bad paths.The formula for the number of such sequences is C(n + m - 1, n - 1) - C(n + m - 1, n). Wait, but that might not be directly. Let me recall.In the reflection principle for paths that stay above the x-axis, the number of paths from (0,0) to (a,b) that never dip below the x-axis is C(a + b, a) - C(a + b, a - 1). But in our case, it&#39;s a bit different.Alternatively, the formula is (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). So that gives the number of favorable sequences, and the probability is that divided by C(n + m, n), so (n - m)/(n + m).Yes, that seems to align with the examples. Therefore, the answer is (n - m)/(n + m). Therefore, the probability is (n - m)/(n + m).But let me just verify with another example where n = 4, m = 2. Then the probability should be (4 - 2)/(4 + 2) = 2/6 = 1/3.Total sequences: 6!/(4!2!) = 15. Number of favorable sequences: (4 - 2)/(4 + 2) * 15 = 5. Let&#39;s see.List all sequences starting with A:First vote is A, remaining votes are AAA B B.Total sequences: 5!/(3!2!) = 10. Wait, total sequences starting with A would be C(5,3) = 10. So total favorable sequences are 5? Let&#39;s check.But this is getting complicated, maybe another way.Alternatively, using the formula for the number of favorable sequences: (n - m)/(n + m) * C(n + m, n). For n=4, m=2: (4-2)/(4+2) * C(6,4) = 2/6 * 15 = 5. So there should be 5 sequences where A is always leading.To verify, let&#39;s attempt to count them. The sequences are permutations of AAAABB where A is always leading.Start with A. Then the remaining votes are AAA BB.We need to ensure that in every prefix, the number of A&#39;s is greater than the number of B&#39;s.This is similar to the problem of balanced parentheses or Dyck paths, but with different numbers.The number of such sequences is given by the Catalan trapezoid or some other formula, but in this case, since n &gt; m, and the difference is 2, maybe the number is 5. Let&#39;s see.Possible sequences starting with A:1. A A A A B B2. A A A B A B3. A A A B B A (But wait, after fifth vote: A A A B B, which is 3 A&#39;s and 2 B&#39;s, so count is 3-2. Then sixth vote A. So during the fifth vote, it&#39;s 3-2, which is still leading. So this is acceptable?Wait, let&#39;s check each step:Sequence 3: A A A B B A- Vote 1: A (1-0)- Vote 2: A (2-0)- Vote 3: A (3-0)- Vote 4: B (3-1)- Vote 5: B (3-2)- Vote 6: A (4-2)At every step, A is leading. So yes, this is valid.4. A A B A A BCheck steps:- Vote 1: A (1-0)- Vote 2: A (2-0)- Vote 3: B (2-1)- Vote 4: A (3-1)- Vote 5: A (4-1)- Vote 6: B (4-2). All steps, A is leading. Valid.5. A A B A B ACheck steps:- Vote 1: A (1-0)- Vote 2: A (2-0)- Vote 3: B (2-1)- Vote 4: A (3-1)- Vote 5: B (3-2)- Vote 6: A (4-2). All steps, A is leading. Valid.6. A A B B A ACheck steps:- Vote 1: A (1-0)- Vote 2: A (2-0)- Vote 3: B (2-1)- Vote 4: B (2-2). Tie here. Invalid.7. A B A A A BCheck steps:- Vote 1: A (1-0)- Vote 2: B (1-1). Tie. Invalid.8. A B A A B AVote 2: B (1-1). Tie. Invalid.9. A B A B A AVote 2: B (1-1). Tie. Invalid.10. A B B A A AVote 2: B (1-1). Tie. Invalid.So the valid sequences are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That&#39;s 5 sequences, which is 5 out of 15 total sequences, so 5/15 = 1/3, which matches the formula (n - m)/(n + m) = 2/6 = 1/3. Therefore, the formula holds here as well.Therefore, after verifying with multiple examples, I can confirm that the probability is indeed (n - m)/(n + m). So the answer should be boxed{dfrac{n - m}{n + m}}.Final AnswerThe probability is boxed{dfrac{n - m}{n + m}}.&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves determining the probability that candidate A&#39;s cumulative vote count always exceeds candidate B&#39;s cumulative vote count during the entire vote counting process, given that A receives ( n ) votes and B receives ( m ) votes with ( n &gt; m ).To solve this, we use the classical ballot theorem, which states that the probability that candidate A is always leading in the count is given by the formula:[frac{n - m}{n + m}]This result can be verified through several examples and by considering the reflection principle, which counts the number of valid sequences where A is always ahead. The total number of sequences of votes is (binom{n + m}{n}), and the number of favorable sequences is given by (frac{n - m}{n + m} times binom{n + m}{n}). Dividing the number of favorable sequences by the total number of sequences yields the probability (frac{n - m}{n + m}).Thus, the probability that A&#39;s cumulative vote count always exceeds B&#39;s cumulative vote count during the vote counting process is:[boxed{dfrac{n - m}{n + m}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-09220ead></div><p class="review-content" data-v-09220ead><span class="icon" data-v-09220ead>🔑:</span>8. frac{m-n}{m+n}Analysis: The ballot counting record is represented by an (m+n)-tuple of real numbers left(a_{1}, a_{2}, mathrm{~L}, a_{m+n}right).

If a natural number can be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and also as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers, it is called a &quot;good number.&quot; Please find the &quot;good number&quot; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.</div><div class="divider" data-v-09220ead></div><p class="review-content" data-v-09220ead><span class="icon" data-v-09220ead>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s try to figure out which of these numbers—2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, or 1011—is a &quot;good number.&quot; From the problem statement, a good number must be expressible both as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers. First, let me make sure I understand what &quot;sum of two consecutive natural numbers&quot; means. If we have two consecutive numbers, like n and n+1, their sum would be n + (n+1) = 2n + 1. So, any number that can be written in the form 2n + 1, where n is a natural number, can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive numbers. That means such numbers are odd numbers because 2n is even and adding 1 makes it odd. Therefore, only odd numbers can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers. Wait, but hold on, let me check that again. Suppose n is 1: 1 + 2 = 3, which is 2*1 + 1 = 3. If n is 2: 2 + 3 = 5 = 2*2 +1=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum of two consecutive numbers is always an odd number. Therefore, any good number must be odd because it has to be expressible as the sum of two consecutive numbers. So looking at the given numbers: 2007 is odd, 2008 even, 2009 odd, 2010 even, 1011 odd. So we can immediately eliminate 2008, 2010 since they are even and can&#39;t be written as the sum of two consecutive numbers. So the candidates are 2007, 2009, and 1011.Now, the good number also needs to be expressible as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers. Let&#39;s figure out what form such a number takes. Let the three consecutive numbers be k, k+1, k+2. Their sum is k + (k+1) + (k+2) = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1). So the sum of three consecutive natural numbers is three times some natural number (k+1). Therefore, any number that can be written as the sum of three consecutive numbers must be divisible by 3. So, for a number to be a good number, it must be both odd (from the two consecutive numbers) and divisible by 3 (from the three consecutive numbers). Therefore, we need to check which of the remaining candidates (2007, 2009, 1011) are divisible by 3.Let&#39;s check divisibility by 3. The rule is that if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3. Starting with 2007: 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9. 9 is divisible by 3, so 2007 is divisible by 3. 2009: 2 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 11. 11 is not divisible by 3, so 2009 is not divisible by 3. 1011: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3. 3 is divisible by 3, so 1011 is divisible by 3. Therefore, both 2007 and 1011 are odd and divisible by 3, so they are candidates. But the problem states that there is one good number among these. So maybe both are good numbers? Wait, the problem lists 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. So maybe both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. But let me check if that&#39;s the case or if I made a mistake. Wait, the problem says &quot;Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among...&quot; so maybe there&#39;s only one. Let me check again.Wait, maybe my reasoning is flawed. Let me verify each candidate step by step.First, confirm if 2007 can be written as the sum of two consecutive numbers. Since it&#39;s odd, that should be possible. Let&#39;s find n such that 2n + 1 = 2007. So 2n = 2006, so n = 1003. So the two consecutive numbers are 1003 and 1004. 1003 + 1004 = 2007. That works.Then, check if 2007 can be written as the sum of three consecutive numbers. Since it&#39;s divisible by 3, let&#39;s find k such that 3(k + 1) = 2007. So k + 1 = 2007 / 3 = 669. Therefore, k = 668. So the three numbers are 668, 669, 670. Let&#39;s check: 668 + 669 + 670 = 668 + 669 is 1337, plus 670 is 2007. Perfect. So 2007 is a good number.Now check 1011. First, as the sum of two consecutive numbers. 2n +1 =1011. 2n=1010, n=505. So the numbers are 505 and 506. 505 +506=1011. Correct.Then, as the sum of three consecutive numbers. 3(k +1)=1011. k +1=337, so k=336. Therefore, numbers 336,337,338. Sum: 336+337=673 +338=1011. Correct. So 1011 is also a good number. But the problem lists five numbers, and maybe both 2007 and 1011 are good. However, the problem says &quot;the &#39;good number&#39;&quot;, implying perhaps only one. Let me check the problem statement again.The problem says: &quot;Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot; So maybe there&#39;s a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me verify again.Wait, let&#39;s check 1011 as the sum of three consecutive numbers. The sum is 3(k+1), so 1011 divided by 3 is 337, so k+1=337, k=336. So numbers are 336,337,338. Their sum is 336 +337 +338. Let&#39;s compute that: 336+337=673, 673+338=1011. Correct. So 1011 is indeed expressible as the sum of three consecutive numbers, and also as the sum of two consecutive numbers. Therefore, 1011 is a good number. Similarly, 2007 is also a good number. So why does the problem say &quot;the good number&quot;? Maybe because among the given numbers, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. Wait, but the original list is 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. So according to my calculations, 2007 and 1011 are both good numbers. However, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Let me check once more.Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read it: &quot;If a natural number can be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and also as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers, it is called a &#39;good number.&#39; Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot;So according to the problem, perhaps only one of them is a good number. But according to my analysis, two of them are. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation.Wait, perhaps when the problem says &quot;natural numbers,&quot; does it include zero or not? Because sometimes natural numbers start at 1, sometimes at 0. If natural numbers here start at 1, then when we consider the three consecutive numbers, k must be at least 1. But in our previous calculation, k=336 is okay. So 336,337,338 are all natural numbers (if starting at 1). Similarly, n=505 gives 505 and 506, which are natural numbers. So 1011 is okay.Similarly, for 2007, k=668 gives numbers 668,669,670, which are natural numbers. So both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. But the problem lists 2007,2008,2009,2010,1011 and asks to &quot;find the good number,&quot; implying singular. So maybe the problem is designed in a way that only one of them is a good number. Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the number is expressible as the sum of two consecutive numbers and as the sum of three consecutive numbers, but when I checked 2007 and 1011, both satisfy. So maybe the answer is both, but since the problem says &quot;the good number,&quot; maybe the correct answer is both, but in the given choices, maybe only one is presented. Wait, let me check again the problem statement.Wait, the problem lists 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 1011. So 2007, 2009, 1011 are odd, and among them 2007 and 1011 are divisible by 3, so they should be good numbers. But in the problem&#39;s list, 1011 is the last number. Maybe the answer is both, but in the original problem, perhaps there is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe my approach is missing something.Wait, let&#39;s try a different approach. Let&#39;s check each number one by one.Starting with 2007:Sum of two consecutive numbers: find n such that n + (n+1) = 2n +1 =2007. So 2n=2006, n=1003. So yes, 1003 +1004=2007.Sum of three consecutive numbers: find k such that k + (k+1) + (k+2) =3k +3=2007. So 3k=2004, k=668. Then numbers 668,669,670 sum to 2007. Correct. So 2007 is good.2008: Even, so cannot be written as sum of two consecutive numbers. Eliminate.2009: Odd. Let&#39;s check if it can be written as sum of two consecutive numbers. 2n +1=2009. So 2n=2008, n=1004. So numbers 1004 and 1005. 1004 +1005=2009. So yes. Then check if it can be written as sum of three consecutive numbers. Sum is 3(k +1). 2009 divided by3 is 669.666..., so not an integer. So 2009 is not divisible by3. Thus, cannot be written as sum of three consecutive numbers. Therefore, 2009 is not a good number.2010: Even, eliminated.1011: As before, sum of two consecutive numbers: 505 +506=1011. Sum of three consecutive numbers:336 +337 +338=1011. So 1011 is a good number.So both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. But the problem says &quot;the good number,&quot; which is confusing. Maybe the problem expects only one answer, so perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, let&#39;s check again the original problem.Original problem: &quot;If a natural number can be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and also as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers, it is called a &#39;good number.&#39; Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot;So, the problem is in Chinese, maybe the translation is a bit off. But according to the English translation here, it&#39;s asking for the &quot;good number&quot; (singular) among the list. But according to our analysis, there are two: 2007 and 1011. However, perhaps in the original problem, there is only one, but the translation or the list is different. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering 1011. Wait, 1011 is listed last, perhaps it&#39;s a typo for 2011? But the user wrote 1011. Alternatively, maybe in the problem&#39;s context, natural numbers start at a different point. Wait, natural numbers are typically considered starting at 1. So when we express numbers as sums of consecutive natural numbers, they must start from 1 or higher. Let me check again for 1011.Expressed as two consecutive numbers: 505 and 506. Both are natural numbers. Expressed as three consecutive numbers:336,337,338. All natural numbers. So that&#39;s okay. So 1011 is indeed a good number. So according to this, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. But the problem provides five numbers and asks to find the good number, which might imply only one. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I need to check if there&#39;s a different interpretation.Wait, another way: maybe the problem requires that the number can be written as the sum of two consecutive numbers in at least one way and as the sum of three consecutive numbers in at least one way, regardless of divisibility. But from the analysis, the conditions for that are that the number must be odd (for two consecutive numbers) and divisible by3 (for three consecutive numbers). Therefore, the good numbers are numbers that are odd and divisible by3, which are numbers congruent to 3 modulo 6. Because odd and divisible by3: 3,9,15,... So numbers that are multiples of3 and odd.But 2007: 2007 /3=669, which is odd. 1011/3=337, which is also odd. So both are 3 multiplied by an odd number. Therefore, they fit.But perhaps in the problem, the correct answer is both, but in the given options, maybe only one is intended. Wait, let me check the numbers again:2007: 2+0+0+7=9 → divisible by3, odd. Good.2008: even, nope.2009: sum digits 11→not divisible by3, odd. Nope.2010: even, nope.1011: sum digits 1+0+1+1=3→divisible by3, odd. Good.So yes, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. But the problem lists them among five numbers and asks to find the good number. If the original problem is from a source that expects a single answer, maybe there&#39;s a mistake. But according to the mathematical analysis, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. However, looking back at the numbers, 1011 is much smaller than the others. Maybe I need to check if 1011 is indeed in the list. The user lists: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. Yes, 1011 is there. So perhaps the correct answers are both, but the problem might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers numbers as sums of consecutive numbers in a different way.Wait, perhaps my initial reasoning is flawed. Let me think again.Sum of two consecutive numbers: n + (n+1) = 2n +1. So any number that is odd can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive numbers. So that&#39;s correct.Sum of three consecutive numbers: n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n +3 =3(n +1). So numbers divisible by3. So a number that is both odd and divisible by3 is a good number.Therefore, the &quot;good numbers&quot; are numbers that are ≡3 mod6 (since divisible by3 and odd). Let&#39;s check:2007 ÷6= 334.5. 6*334=2004, 2004+3=2007. So 2007≡3 mod6. Similarly, 1011 ÷6=168.5, 6*168=1008, 1008+3=1011. So 1011≡3 mod6. Therefore, both are ≡3 mod6. So both are good numbers.Therefore, according to mathematical reasoning, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. However, the problem asks to &quot;find the good number&quot; among the list, implying there is only one. Therefore, there might be an error in either the problem or my analysis. Let me check once again for each number.For 2007:- Two consecutive numbers: 1003 +1004=2007. Correct.- Three consecutive numbers: 668 +669 +670=2007. Correct.For 1011:- Two consecutive numbers:505 +506=1011. Correct.- Three consecutive numbers:336 +337 +338=1011. Correct.Therefore, both numbers satisfy the conditions, so both are good numbers. Hence, the answer should include both. But the problem may have intended only one, perhaps there&#39;s a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as 2010, which is even and divisible by3. Wait, 2010 is divisible by3 (2+0+1+0=3), but it&#39;s even, so it cannot be expressed as the sum of two consecutive numbers. Therefore, 2010 is not a good number.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that &quot;sum of three consecutive numbers&quot; can also be written as 3n +3, which includes all multiples of3, regardless of their parity. But since a good number must also be expressible as the sum of two consecutive numbers (which requires it to be odd), the only numbers that satisfy both are multiples of3 that are odd, hence numbers congruent to3 mod6. Hence, 2007 and 1011.Therefore, the answer should be both 2007 and 1011. But since the problem lists them as separate options and asks to &quot;find the good number,&quot; maybe in the original problem, only one is correct, perhaps a translation error. But according to the mathematical analysis, both are correct.However, looking back at the numbers provided: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 1011. If the problem is from an exam or a specific source, maybe only one is intended, but based on the criteria, two are correct. Therefore, unless there&#39;s a restriction I&#39;m missing, the answer should be both. But since the user might expect a single answer, maybe I need to check if I&#39;ve made a mistake.Wait, let&#39;s check 1011 again. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the sum:336 +337 +338 = 336 +337 is 673, plus 338 is 1011. Correct.505 +506 =1011. Correct.Similarly, 2007:1003 +1004=2007. Correct.668 +669 +670=2007. Correct.Therefore, both numbers satisfy the conditions. Hence, the answer should be both 2007 and 1011. However, the problem might have a typo, or maybe the original problem in Chinese had different numbers. But as per the given numbers, two are good numbers.But given that the user has listed the numbers as 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011, and the final instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually expects a single answer. So perhaps the intended answer is 2010, but that&#39;s even, so no. Wait, 2010 is even and divisible by3. But since it&#39;s even, it can&#39;t be written as the sum of two consecutive numbers, so it&#39;s not a good number.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers zero as a natural number. If zero is allowed, then the sum of two consecutive numbers including zero would be 0 +1=1, which is odd. But even if zero is allowed, for a number to be expressed as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers (including zero), it still needs to be odd. Similarly, for three consecutive numbers including zero: 0 +1 +2=3, which is divisible by3. But even if zero is considered, the logic remains the same. Hence, numbers must be odd and divisible by3.Therefore, the conclusion is that 2007 and 1011 are both good numbers. But since the problem asks for the good number (singular), maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement. However, given the options, I have to choose between the five numbers. Since both 2007 and 1011 qualify, but the problem might expect only one, perhaps the answer is 2010? No, because it&#39;s even. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the divisibility by3 for 2009. Wait, 2009: sum of digits is2+0+0+9=11, not divisible by3. Correct. 1011: digits sum to3, divisible by3. So both are good numbers.Given that, maybe the answer is both, but the standard practice in such multiple-choice questions is to pick all that apply. However, since the user hasn&#39;t specified the format for multiple answers and asks to put the final answer within a single box, maybe the intended answer is 2010, but that&#39;s not possible. Alternatively, since 2007 and 1011 are both correct, but the problem might have a different intended answer.Wait, let me check once again if there&#39;s any other condition. For example, maybe the problem requires the number to be expressible as both sums in different ways, but I think we&#39;ve already covered that. Alternatively, maybe the problem defines natural numbers as starting from a different point. For example, in some contexts, natural numbers start from1, so when we take three consecutive numbers, the smallest sum would be1+2+3=6, so any good number must be at least6. But 1011 is much larger than6, so that&#39;s okay.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a upper limit, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention that. Therefore, I think the correct answers are 2007 and 1011. However, given that the problem lists them as separate options and the user might expect one answer, but in the absence of further information, I&#39;ll have to state both. However, since the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which typically is used for a single answer, maybe the problem expects only one, and I have to check if there&#39;s an error in my analysis.Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem requires the number to be expressible as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers, but not necessarily requiring the two conditions to be related. However, that&#39;s what I already checked. So unless there&#39;s a different interpretation, I think both 2007 and 1011 are correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation, and &quot;natural number&quot; in the original problem refers to positive integers, which is the same as our analysis. Therefore, the answer should be both. But since the options given include both, and the user might expect multiple answers, but the final answer format is a single box, maybe the problem expects both, but written as two boxed answers. However, the instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, so likely expecting one.Given that, maybe the problem has a mistake, but according to the mathematical analysis, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. However, since the problem lists 1011 at the end, which is much smaller, maybe I made a mistake with that. Let me check 1011 again:As sum of two consecutive numbers:505 +506=1011. Correct.As sum of three consecutive numbers:336 +337 +338=1011. Correct.Yes, that&#39;s correct. So both numbers are good numbers. Therefore, the answer should be both. But since the problem asks for &quot;the good number,&quot; maybe there&#39;s a cultural context or a specific reason. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is from a specific source where the answer is 2007. But without more information, I have to go with the mathematical conclusion. Therefore, the good numbers are 2007 and 1011. But since the user might expect one answer, I might need to check if the problem had a typo, but given the information, both are correct.But given that this is likely a problem from a competition or textbook, and considering the numbers, 2007 might be the intended answer. Wait, let me check the year numbers:2007,2008,2009,2010, which are consecutive years, and then 1011. Maybe 1011 is a distractor. But why would 1011 be there? Anyway, according to the math, both are good numbers. Therefore, the correct answers are boxed{2007} and boxed{1011}. However, if only one is expected, I&#39;ll go with both.But in the initial analysis, the user might expect a single answer. Let me see the difference between 2007 and 1011. Maybe 1011 is also a good number, but the problem wants the one in the sequence of years. However, without explicit instructions, I can&#39;t assume that. Therefore, both are correct.But since the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, and it&#39;s possible to have multiple boxed answers, perhaps:The good numbers are boxed{2007} and boxed{1011}.However, if the system expects a single answer, maybe the first one, which is 2007. But since I have to be precise, I think both are correct. Therefore, I&#39;ll present both answers.Final AnswerThe good numbers are boxed{2007} and boxed{1011}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine which of the given numbers (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011) is a &quot;good number,&quot; we need to check if each number can be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers.1. Sum of two consecutive natural numbers:   - This sum is of the form (2n + 1), which must be an odd number.   - From the given numbers, 2007, 2009, and 1011 are odd.2. Sum of three consecutive natural numbers:   - This sum is of the form (3k + 3), which must be divisible by 3.   - Checking divisibility by 3:     - 2007: (2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9) (divisible by 3)     - 2009: (2 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 11) (not divisible by 3)     - 1011: (1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3) (divisible by 3)3. Verification:   - 2007:     - Sum of two consecutive numbers: (1003 + 1004 = 2007)     - Sum of three consecutive numbers: (668 + 669 + 670 = 2007)   - 1011:     - Sum of two consecutive numbers: (505 + 506 = 1011)     - Sum of three consecutive numbers: (336 + 337 + 338 = 1011)Both 2007 and 1011 satisfy the conditions of being a &quot;good number.&quot; Therefore, the final answers are:[boxed{2007} text{ and } boxed{1011}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of these numbers—2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011—is a &quot;good number.&quot; A good number is defined as a natural number that can be written both as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, let me recall what it means for a number to be the sum of two consecutive natural numbers. Let&#39;s say the two consecutive numbers are n and n+1. Then their sum would be n + (n + 1) = 2n + 1. So any number that can be expressed as 2n + 1 for some natural number n is a sum of two consecutive numbers. Wait a second, 2n + 1 is always an odd number because it&#39;s 2 times an integer plus 1. That means that any odd number can be written as the sum of two consecutive numbers. For example, 3 = 1 + 2, 5 = 2 + 3, etc. So the first part of being a &quot;good number&quot; is that the number must be odd. Let me check the given numbers:2007: odd2008: even2009: odd2010: even1011: oddSo right away, the even numbers—2008, 2010—are out of the running for being good numbers because they can&#39;t be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers. So we can narrow it down to 2007, 2009, and 1011. That reduces the possibilities.Now, the second condition is that the number must also be expressible as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers. Let me think about how that works. Let the three consecutive numbers be m, m+1, and m+2. Then their sum is m + (m + 1) + (m + 2) = 3m + 3 = 3(m + 1). So the sum of three consecutive numbers is 3 times some natural number (since m is a natural number, m + 1 is also a natural number). Therefore, any number that can be written as the sum of three consecutive numbers must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the number has to be a multiple of 3.So, putting it all together: a good number must be odd (from the two consecutive numbers condition) and divisible by 3 (from the three consecutive numbers condition). So we need to check among the remaining candidates—2007, 2009, 1011—which ones are divisible by 3.Let me check divisibility by 3 for each of these numbers. The rule for divisibility by 3 is that if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3.Starting with 2007: 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9. 9 is divisible by 3 (9 ÷ 3 = 3), so 2007 is divisible by 3. Okay, that&#39;s a candidate.Next, 2009: 2 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 11. 11 is not divisible by 3 (11 ÷ 3 is 3 with a remainder of 2), so 2009 is not divisible by 3. So 2009 is out.Then 1011: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3. 3 is divisible by 3, so 1011 is divisible by 3. So 1011 is also a candidate.Therefore, the possible good numbers are 2007 and 1011, as they satisfy both conditions: being odd and divisible by 3.But wait, let&#39;s confirm that these numbers can indeed be expressed as both the sum of two consecutive numbers and three consecutive numbers. Just to make sure there&#39;s no mistake.Starting with 2007. First, as the sum of two consecutive numbers: since it&#39;s odd, we can write it as 2n + 1. Solving for n: n = (2007 - 1)/2 = 2006/2 = 1003. So the two consecutive numbers are 1003 and 1004. Let&#39;s check: 1003 + 1004 = 2007. That works.Now, as the sum of three consecutive numbers: Since it&#39;s divisible by 3, we can write it as 3(m + 1). Let m + 1 = 2007 / 3 = 669. Therefore, m = 668. So the three consecutive numbers are 668, 669, 670. Let&#39;s check: 668 + 669 + 670. Let&#39;s compute that: 668 + 669 = 1337, then 1337 + 670 = 2007. Perfect, that works. So 2007 is indeed a good number.Now let&#39;s check 1011. First, as the sum of two consecutive numbers: n = (1011 - 1)/2 = 1010/2 = 505. So the numbers are 505 and 506. Check: 505 + 506 = 1011. Correct.As the sum of three consecutive numbers: m + 1 = 1011 / 3 = 337, so m = 336. Therefore, the numbers are 336, 337, 338. Adding them up: 336 + 337 = 673, then 673 + 338 = 1011. That&#39;s correct too. So 1011 is also a good number.Wait a second, the problem lists the numbers 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. So according to my reasoning, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. But the problem says &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39; among...&quot;, implying there might be only one. Did I make a mistake?Let me check the problem statement again. It says: &quot;it is called a &#39;good number.&#39; Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot; So maybe both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers, but let&#39;s check if perhaps one of them isn&#39;t.Wait, but according to my calculations, both satisfy both conditions. Let me double-check the three consecutive numbers for 1011 again. 336 + 337 + 338. Let me add them step by step: 336 + 337 = 673; 673 + 338 = 1011. Yes, correct.Similarly, 2007: 668 + 669 + 670. 668 + 669 is 1337, plus 670 is 2007. Correct. So both numbers do fit both conditions.But let me check if perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in my reasoning. The problem states &quot;natural numbers,&quot; which are positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...). So when we split into consecutive numbers, we need to ensure that the starting numbers are natural numbers (i.e., positive integers). For example, if when solving for m, we get m = 0, then the numbers would be 0, 1, 2, but 0 is not a natural number. So we need to confirm that m and n are natural numbers (i.e., starting from 1).In our case, for 2007:Two consecutive numbers: n = 1003, which is natural. So numbers 1003 and 1004, both natural.Three consecutive numbers: m = 668, so numbers 668, 669, 670, all natural. So that&#39;s okay.For 1011:Two consecutive numbers: n = 505, so numbers 505 and 506, both natural.Three consecutive numbers: m = 336, so numbers 336, 337, 338, all natural. So both 2007 and 1011 are valid.But the problem lists 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. So unless the problem expects only one answer, but according to the criteria, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. However, maybe I made a mistake in the initial reasoning.Wait, let&#39;s check again. The first step: sum of two consecutive numbers is 2n + 1, which must be odd. So that&#39;s correct. The sum of three consecutive numbers is 3(m + 1), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the number must be divisible by 3 and odd. So both 2007 and 1011 are odd and divisible by 3.But let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;a natural number can be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and also as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers, it is called a &#39;good number.&#39;&quot; So indeed, both 2007 and 1011 meet the criteria.However, the problem asks to &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39; among&quot; the given options. The options are 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. So unless there&#39;s a translation error or maybe I miscalculated the divisibility by 3.Wait, let me check 1011 again. 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is divisible by 3, so 1011 ÷ 3 = 337. So 3*337 = 1011. Correct.2007 ÷ 3 is 669. So 3*669 = 2007. Correct.So both numbers are divisible by 3 and are odd, hence both are good numbers. But the problem lists both of them as options. Wait, the problem says &quot;Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot; So maybe the answer is both 2007 and 1011? But the way the question is phrased, &quot;the good number,&quot; suggests perhaps only one. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let me check another angle. Maybe the sum of three consecutive numbers isn&#39;t necessarily only numbers divisible by 3. Wait, when we have three consecutive numbers: m, m+1, m+2. The sum is 3m + 3 = 3(m + 1). So that&#39;s correct, it&#39;s a multiple of 3. So any sum of three consecutive numbers is a multiple of 3. So the number must be divisible by 3. So 2007 and 1011 are both divisible by 3 and odd.But perhaps the problem is that when you write it as three consecutive numbers, m must be a natural number (i.e., starting from 1). Wait, m is the first number. For example, if the number is 3, then m=0, but 0 isn&#39;t a natural number. But in our cases:For 2007: m = 668, which is natural.For 1011: m = 336, which is natural. So both are okay.Therefore, both numbers should be considered good numbers.But looking back at the problem statement: &quot;Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot; So possibly, the answer is both 2007 and 1011, but maybe the problem expects only one. Wait, looking at the original problem again:Original problem: &quot;7. If a natural number can be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and also as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers, it is called a &#39;good number.&#39; Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot;The Chinese translation might be clearer, but assuming the translation is accurate, the problem is giving five numbers and asking for which one is a good number. But according to the analysis, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. However, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I made an error.Wait, let&#39;s check once again if 2007 and 1011 are actually both good numbers. Let&#39;s check another way.For 2007:Sum of two consecutive numbers: 2007 = x + (x + 1) =&gt; 2x + 1 = 2007 =&gt; x = (2007 - 1)/2 = 2006/2 = 1003. So 1003 + 1004 = 2007. Correct.Sum of three consecutive numbers: 2007 = y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) =&gt; 3y + 3 = 2007 =&gt; 3y = 2004 =&gt; y = 668. So 668 + 669 + 670 = 2007. Correct.For 1011:Sum of two consecutive numbers: 1011 = a + (a + 1) =&gt; 2a + 1 = 1011 =&gt; a = 505. 505 + 506 = 1011. Correct.Sum of three consecutive numbers: 1011 = b + (b + 1) + (b + 2) =&gt; 3b + 3 = 1011 =&gt; 3b = 1008 =&gt; b = 336. 336 + 337 + 338 = 1011. Correct.Therefore, both numbers are indeed good numbers. However, the original problem lists both 2007 and 1011 among the options, so unless the problem is designed to have multiple correct answers, but in the given list, perhaps only one of them is intended. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the numbers given are 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 1011. So both 2007 and 1011 are present. The problem asks to &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39; among&quot; these. If the problem is expecting a single answer, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem&#39;s wording or my reasoning.Alternatively, maybe the problem requires the number to be expressible as both sums, but perhaps there&#39;s an overlap or some other constraint. Wait, no. The definition is straightforward: being expressible as both sums. So both 2007 and 1011 satisfy that. Unless there&#39;s a miscalculation here.Wait, perhaps the problem was translated incorrectly, and the original Chinese problem had different numbers? But I can&#39;t check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from an exam where only one answer is expected, and the test-taker is supposed to choose one. But according to the mathematical reasoning, both are correct. Maybe in the source problem, only one was correct, but here both are.Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the definitions. Let me check again. The sum of two consecutive natural numbers: yes, 2n + 1, so odd numbers. Sum of three consecutive numbers: 3(m + 1), so divisible by 3. Therefore, the number must be odd and divisible by 3. Both 2007 and 1011 satisfy this. So both are good numbers.But since the problem gives five options and asks to &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39;&quot;, maybe it&#39;s expecting multiple answers. However, the way the question is phrased (&quot;the good number&quot;) might imply singular, but the problem statement says &quot;a good number&quot;, not &quot;the good number&quot;. Wait, looking back: &quot;it is called a &#39;good number.&#39; Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among...&quot;. So the term is &quot;good number&quot;, and they want which one of the listed numbers is a good number.Therefore, if both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers, and both are listed, then both should be the answers. However, since the user instruction here says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which typically is used for a single answer. But maybe in the original problem, only one is intended. Let me check the divisibility again.Wait, 1011: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3. 3 is divisible by 3, so 1011 ÷ 3 = 337. So 337 x 3 = 1011. Correct.2007: 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9. 9 ÷ 3 = 3, so 2007 ÷ 3 = 669. Correct.So both are divisible by 3 and odd. Therefore, both are good numbers. Therefore, the answer should be both 2007 and 1011. However, given the way the question is presented, perhaps I need to check if the problem considers 0 as a natural number. In some definitions, natural numbers start at 0, but in others, they start at 1. However, the problem specifies &quot;natural numbers&quot;, and in the context of these problems, natural numbers usually start at 1.But even if natural numbers started at 0, the consecutive numbers would still need to be non-negative. For instance, if a number can be written as the sum of two consecutive numbers including zero, but in our case, the numbers we found (1003, 1004, etc.) are all positive, so even if natural numbers start at 1, these are valid. Therefore, the two numbers 2007 and 1011 are both good numbers.But since the problem includes both in the options and asks to &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39;&quot;, maybe the answer is both. But in Chinese exams, sometimes they list multiple correct answers but expect you to select all that apply. However, since this is presented as a single problem with five options, and the user instruction here is to put the final answer within a box, maybe the answer is multiple numbers. But typically, in such problems, there is only one correct answer. Let me check once again.Wait, maybe I miscalculated something. Let me check 1011 again. If it&#39;s the sum of three consecutive numbers: 336 + 337 + 338 = 1011. Correct. Sum of two consecutive numbers: 505 + 506 = 1011. Correct. So that&#39;s valid.Similarly, 2007: 1003 + 1004 = 2007; 668 + 669 + 670 = 2007. Correct.But perhaps the problem wants the largest such number or something else? The problem just says &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39;&quot;, so if both are present, both should be answers. But in the original list: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. Both 2007 and 1011 are present. Therefore, the answer should be both.But since the user might expect a single answer, maybe there is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the sum of three consecutive numbers must be 3m, not 3(m + 1). Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the three consecutive numbers.If the three consecutive numbers are m, m + 1, m + 2, then their sum is 3m + 3 = 3(m + 1). So it&#39;s 3 times (m + 1). Therefore, the sum is divisible by 3. So for example, 6 can be written as 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is 3*2. So m + 1 = 2, m = 1. So 1, 2, 3. That&#39;s correct.But 3 itself: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. But if natural numbers start at 1, then 0 is excluded. Therefore, 3 cannot be written as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers (since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6). Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Wait, 3 cannot be written as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers starting from 1. So maybe my previous reasoning is flawed. Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, if natural numbers start at 1, then three consecutive natural numbers would be 1, 2, 3; 2, 3, 4; etc. The sums would be 6, 9, 12, etc. So 3 cannot be written as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers if natural numbers start at 1. Therefore, my previous reasoning that the sum of three consecutive natural numbers is 3(m + 1) is correct only if m is allowed to be zero. But if natural numbers start at 1, then m must be at least 1. Therefore, the sum would be 3(m + 1) where m &gt;=1, so the sums would be 6, 9, 12, etc. So numbers must be divisible by 3 and at least 6.Wait, this is a critical point. If natural numbers start at 1, then the smallest sum of three consecutive natural numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the sum of three consecutive natural numbers must be divisible by 3 and greater than or equal to 6. Similarly, the sum of two consecutive natural numbers is 2n + 1, starting from n=1: 1 + 2 = 3, which is 3; 2 + 3 = 5, etc. So sums are 3, 5, 7, 9, etc., the odd numbers starting from 3.Therefore, a good number must be an odd number (at least 3) and divisible by 3 (at least 6). So the numbers must be odd multiples of 3. So 3, 9, 15, 21, etc. But 3 cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers (since that would require 0 + 1 + 2, but 0 isn&#39;t a natural number). Therefore, the smallest good number is 9 (sum of two consecutive numbers: 4 + 5 = 9; sum of three consecutive numbers: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9). So 9 is a good number.But in this problem, the numbers given are 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. All of these are greater than 6, so the earlier constraint is satisfied. So if the numbers are large enough, the requirement is just that they are odd and divisible by 3. So 2007 and 1011.But why does the problem list both? Perhaps the answer is both. However, if we check the original problem statement again: it says &quot;Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among...&quot;, which might be singular. But in Chinese, sometimes plural and singular aren&#39;t distinguished as clearly as in English. So maybe the problem allows multiple answers.However, in the context of such problems, especially in exams like the Chinese Gaokao or Olympiads, often there is a single correct answer. Therefore, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let&#39;s check if 1011 can indeed be written as the sum of three consecutive numbers. 336 + 337 + 338 = 1011. Correct. But if natural numbers start at 1, then 336 is a natural number, so that&#39;s okay.Same with 2007: 668 + 669 + 670 = 2007. Correct. Both starting numbers are natural numbers. Therefore, both are valid.Therefore, I think the correct answer is both 2007 and 1011. But since the problem lists them as separate options, and if the user expects a single answer, perhaps there&#39;s an error. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where multiple answers are allowed. In the absence of further information, based on the mathematical reasoning, both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers.But checking back with the initial problem statement, the numbers are 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 1011. So both 2007 and 1011 are in the list, and both are good numbers. Therefore, the answer is both. However, since the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually indicates a single answer. Maybe in the original problem, only one is correct due to a typo, but according to the analysis here, two numbers fit.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be written as multiple boxed numbers. But standard practice for such problems is to box one answer. Given that, perhaps I need to check again.Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum for 1011.Let me check 336 + 337 + 338:336 + 337 = 673673 + 338: 673 + 300 = 973, 973 + 38 = 1011. Correct.And 505 + 506 = 1011. Correct.So no mistake there.Similarly for 2007, 1003 + 1004 = 2007, and 668 + 669 + 670 = 2007. Correct.Therefore, both numbers are indeed good numbers. If the problem allows multiple answers, then both 2007 and 1011 are correct. But if only one is expected, maybe the problem had a typo. However, given the information provided, both are correct.Wait, but looking at the numbers: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011. The number 1011 is much smaller, but it&#39;s included in the options. So unless there&#39;s a specific reason to choose one over the other, but according to the definition, both are good numbers. Therefore, the answer should be both.But given that the user might expect a single answer, maybe I need to confirm once more.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different interpretation of &quot;consecutive natural numbers&quot;. For example, perhaps &quot;consecutive&quot; in the case of three numbers refers to consecutive even or odd numbers? But no, the problem states &quot;three consecutive natural numbers,&quot; which would be m, m+1, m+2.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers &quot;consecutive&quot; as starting from a different point. But no, consecutive natural numbers are sequential numbers.Therefore, my conclusion is that both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers. However, since the problem lists them as separate options and asks to &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39;&quot;, the answer is both. But given that the user might require a single answer, perhaps there&#39;s an error. But according to the analysis, both are correct.Given that, but to comply with the user&#39;s request to put the final answer within a single box, perhaps the problem expects both. But typically, multiple answers are boxed separately. Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different intended answer. Let me check once again.Wait, another way to check is to note that a number that is the sum of two consecutive numbers is odd, and the sum of three consecutive numbers is divisible by 3. So the number must be an odd multiple of 3. So numbers like 3, 9, 15, 21, ..., 2007, 2013, etc. Therefore, among the given numbers, 2007 and 1011 are both odd multiples of 3, hence good numbers.Therefore, both are correct. If the problem allows multiple answers, then both are correct. If the problem expects one, perhaps the larger one is intended. But without further information, both are correct.Given that, I&#39;ll present both answers, but check the problem&#39;s origin. Since the problem is presented as a single question with five options, it&#39;s possible that both 2007 and 1011 are correct. However, in many standardized tests, sometimes only the largest number is given as an option if multiple answers exist, but in this case, both are present.Therefore, the correct answers are 2007 and 1011. If the system allows multiple answers, I&#39;ll box both. Otherwise, I need to check if there&#39;s any other constraint.But re-reading the problem: it says &quot;Please find the &#39;good number&#39; among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 1011.&quot; So if I have to choose from these, and both 2007 and 1011 are good numbers, then both are correct. However, considering standard test conventions, sometimes problems like this might have a unique answer due to a specific reason. Wait, let&#39;s check if perhaps 1011 is not a good number. Let me verify again:Sum of two consecutive numbers: 505 + 506 = 1011. Correct.Sum of three consecutive numbers: 336 + 337 + 338 = 1011. Correct.Yes, so it&#39;s a good number. Similarly for 2007. Therefore, the answer is both.But the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. Typically, boxed{} is used for a single answer. If multiple answers are expected, they can be boxed separately. However, since this is a single problem, perhaps the answer is multiple. But the way the problem is phrased, &quot;find the &#39;good number&#39;&quot;, maybe it&#39;s expecting multiple. However, in Chinese math problems, sometimes multiple correct answers are presented, and the correct one is the one that&#39;s listed. Given the options, both 2007 and 1011 are listed, so both should be correct.But since the original problem is in Chinese and the translation might have nuances, but given the analysis, both numbers are good numbers. Therefore, the final answer is both 2007 and 1011. If the system allows multiple boxed answers, I can present both. Otherwise, I might need to indicate both.However, given the ambiguity and the standard practice, I&#39;ll check online if such problems usually have multiple answers. But since I can&#39;t access external resources, I&#39;ll proceed with what I have.In conclusion, both 2007 and 1011 meet the criteria of being good numbers. Therefore, the answer is both.But given the possible expectation of a single answer, perhaps there&#39;s an oversight. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the number that can be expressed as both sums in different ways. But both can. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation. However, after checking multiple times, both numbers satisfy the conditions.Therefore, I think the correct answers are 2007 and 1011. If multiple answers are allowed, both should be boxed. If not, perhaps the problem has a typo, but based on the given information, both are correct.Final AnswerThe good numbers are boxed{2007} and boxed{1011}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine which numbers among 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 1011 are &quot;good numbers,&quot; we need to check if they can be written as the sum of two consecutive natural numbers and also as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers.1.

The formula is (2n + 1) for some natural number (n).   - From the given numbers, the odd numbers are 2007, 2009, and 1011.2. Sum of three consecutive natural numbers:   - A number can be written as the sum of three consecutive natural numbers if it is divisible by 3. The formula is (3(m + 1)) for some natural number (m).   - Checking divisibility by 3:     - 2007: Sum of digits (2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9), which is divisible by 3.     - 2009: Sum of digits (2 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 11), which is not divisible by 3.     - 1011: Sum of digits (1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3), which is divisible by 3.3. Verification:   - 2007:     - Sum of two consecutive numbers: (1003 + 1004 = 2007)     - Sum of three consecutive numbers: (668 + 669 + 670 = 2007)   - 1011:     - Sum of two consecutive numbers: (505 + 506 = 1011)     - Sum of three consecutive numbers: (336 + 337 + 338 = 1011)Both 2007 and 1011 satisfy the conditions of being odd and divisible by 3, making them good numbers.

The options are whether 1, 2, 3, or 4 of them are correct, with the answer choices being A through D. Let me go through each statement one by one and analyze them.Starting with statement ①: If AB = BC = CA, then triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle. Hmm, well, an equilateral triangle is defined as a triangle where all three sides are equal. So if all sides are equal, then by definition, it&#39;s equilateral. So this seems straightforward. So ① is correct.Moving on to statement ②: If angle A = angle B = angle C, then triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle. Okay, so all angles are equal. In Euclidean geometry, the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. If all three angles are equal, each angle would be 60 degrees. Now, in a triangle, if all angles are equal, does that necessarily mean all sides are equal? I remember that in a triangle, equal angles correspond to equal sides opposite them. So if all three angles are 60 degrees, then all three sides opposite those angles must be equal. Therefore, the triangle would be equilateral. So ② is also correct.Now statement ③: A triangle with two angles both equal to 60 degrees is an equilateral triangle. Let&#39;s see. If two angles are 60 degrees, then the third angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the two from 180. So 180 - 60 - 60 = 60 degrees. Therefore, the third angle is also 60 degrees. So all three angles are 60 degrees, which, as per statement ②, would make it equilateral. So ③ is correct as well.Statement ④: An isosceles triangle with one angle of 60 degrees is an equilateral triangle. Let&#39;s unpack this. An isosceles triangle has at least two equal sides. The angles opposite those sides are equal. Now, if one angle is 60 degrees, there are two cases: either the two equal angles are 60 degrees, or the unequal angle is 60 degrees.Case 1: The two equal angles are 60 degrees. Then the third angle is 180 - 60 - 60 = 60 degrees. So all angles are 60, making it equilateral.Case 2: The unequal angle is 60 degrees. Then the other two angles are equal. Let the two equal angles be x. Then x + x + 60 = 180. So 2x = 120, so x = 60. Therefore, all angles are 60 degrees again, making it equilateral.Wait, so in both cases, if an isosceles triangle has one angle of 60 degrees, it must be equilateral. Therefore, statement ④ is correct.So all four statements seem to be correct. Let me verify again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.For statement ①: Sides equal → equilateral. That&#39;s the definition. Correct.Statement ②: All angles equal → equilateral. Since angles sum to 180, each is 60, so sides opposite are equal. Correct.Statement ③: Two angles 60 → third angle 60, so all angles 60, hence equilateral. Correct.Statement ④: Isosceles with one angle 60. Whether the 60 is the unique angle or one of the two equal angles, in either case, all angles become 60, hence equilateral. Correct.Therefore, all four conclusions are correct. So the answer should be D: 4 correct.But wait, let me check for possible exceptions or special cases. For example, in statement ④, could there be a non-equilateral isosceles triangle with a 60 degree angle? Suppose the triangle has sides AB = AC, angle at A is 60. Then angles at B and C are equal. Sum of angles: 60 + 2x = 180 → x = 60. So all angles are 60, so triangle is equilateral. If instead, the base angle is 60, say angle B = 60. Since AB = AC, angles at B and C are equal. If angle B is 60, then angle C is 60, so angle A is 60. Again, equilateral. So regardless of where the 60 degree angle is in the isosceles triangle, it leads to all angles being 60. Therefore, ④ is indeed correct.So all four statements are correct. The answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which conclusions about equilateral triangles are correct, we analyze each statement:1. Statement ①: If ( AB = BC = CA ), then ( triangle ABC ) is an equilateral triangle.     - This is correct by definition, as an equilateral triangle has all sides equal.2. Statement ②: If ( angle A = angle B = angle C ), then ( triangle ABC ) is an equilateral triangle.     - Since the sum of angles in a triangle is ( 180^circ ), each angle must be ( 60^circ ). All sides opposite equal angles are equal, making the triangle equilateral. This is correct.3. Statement ③: A triangle with two angles both equal to ( 60^circ ) is an equilateral triangle.     - If two angles are ( 60^circ ), the third angle is ( 180^circ - 60^circ - 60^circ = 60^circ ). All angles are ( 60^circ ), making the triangle equilateral. This is correct.4. Statement ④: An isosceles triangle with one angle of ( 60^circ ) is an equilateral triangle.     - If the ( 60^circ ) angle is the unique angle, the other two angles are ( 60^circ ). If the ( 60^circ ) angle is one of the two equal angles, the third angle is also ( 60^circ ). In both cases, all angles are ( 60^circ ), making the triangle equilateral. This is correct.All four statements are correct. Therefore, the answer is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. We have four statements about triangles, and we need to determine which ones are correct. The options are that 1, 2, 3, or all 4 of them are correct. Let me go through each statement one by one, think through them carefully, and see if I can figure out the right answer.First, let&#39;s recall some basic properties of triangles, especially equilateral and isosceles triangles. An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal and all three angles equal to 60 degrees. An isosceles triangle has at least two sides equal and the angles opposite those sides are equal. So, if a triangle is equilateral, it&#39;s also isosceles, but not all isosceles triangles are equilateral. Alright, with that in mind, let&#39;s look at each statement.Statement ①: If AB=BC=CA, then triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle.Hmm, this seems straightforward. If all three sides of a triangle are equal, then by definition, it&#39;s an equilateral triangle. In Euclidean geometry, a triangle with all sides equal is called equilateral. So, statement ① should be correct. There&#39;s no doubt here. If all three sides are equal, the triangle must be equilateral. So I can check this one as correct.Statement ②: If angle A = angle B = angle C, then triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle.Okay, angles. In a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. If all three angles are equal, then each angle must be 180 divided by 3, which is 60 degrees. So all angles are 60 degrees. Now, does having all angles equal to 60 degrees necessarily mean the triangle is equilateral?Yes, I think so. In Euclidean geometry, if a triangle is equiangular (all angles equal), then it is also equilateral. The converse is also true. So if all three angles are 60 degrees, the sides must all be equal. Therefore, statement ② should also be correct. Wait, but I need to be careful here. Is there a case where angles are all equal but sides aren&#39;t? Hmm, in similar triangles, angles are equal, but sides can be different. But in a single triangle, if all three angles are equal, they must all be 60 degrees, and the triangle must be equilateral. Because in a single triangle, you can&#39;t have different side lengths with all angles equal. So yes, statement ② is correct.Statement ③: A triangle with two angles both equal to 60 degrees is an equilateral triangle.Alright, if a triangle has two angles equal to 60 degrees, then the third angle must be 180 minus 60 minus 60, which is 60 degrees. Therefore, all three angles are 60 degrees. So by the same logic as statement ②, this triangle must be equilateral. Therefore, statement ③ is correct. Wait, let&#39;s think again. Suppose we have two angles of 60 degrees. Then the third angle is 60, so all angles are equal, hence the triangle is equilateral. Therefore, yes, this statement is correct. So ③ is correct.Statement ④: An isosceles triangle with one angle of 60 degrees is an equilateral triangle.Hmm, this is interesting. An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal angles. If one angle is 60 degrees, we need to check if the triangle must be equilateral.First, in an isosceles triangle, the two equal angles are called the base angles. If the 60-degree angle is one of the base angles, then the other base angle is also 60 degrees. Then the third angle would be 180 minus 60 minus 60, which is 60 degrees. Therefore, all angles are 60 degrees, so the triangle is equilateral.Alternatively, if the 60-degree angle is the vertex angle (the angle between the two equal sides), then the two base angles would each be (180 - 60)/2 = 60 degrees. Therefore, again, all angles are 60 degrees, so the triangle is equilateral.Wait, so in either case, whether the 60-degree angle is a base angle or the vertex angle, the other angles also become 60 degrees. Therefore, the triangle must be equilateral. So statement ④ is correct.Therefore, all four statements are correct?Wait, but let me check again. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose I have a triangle with sides AB = AC = 2, and angle at A is 60 degrees. Then, using the Law of Cosines, the side BC would be sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 - 2*2*2*cos(60)). Cos(60) is 0.5, so BC = sqrt(4 + 4 - 8*0.5) = sqrt(8 - 4) = sqrt(4) = 2. Therefore, BC is 2, so all sides are equal. Hence, it&#39;s equilateral.Alternatively, if the 60-degree angle is at B, so angles at B and C are 60 degrees, then the triangle is equilateral. So regardless of where the 60-degree angle is in the isosceles triangle, the triangle ends up being equilateral. Therefore, statement ④ is correct.Therefore, all four statements are correct. So the answer should be D: 4 correct.Wait, but let me double-check statement ③ again. The problem states: &quot;a triangle with two angles both equal to 60 degrees is an equilateral triangle.&quot; If two angles are 60, the third is 60, so all three are 60. Hence, equilateral. So yes, that&#39;s correct. So ③ is correct.So, all four statements are correct. So the answer is D. But let me check the answer options again. The options are:A: 1 correctB: 2 correctC: 3 correctD: 4 correctSo according to my analysis, all four statements are correct, so D is the answer. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in one of them? Let me check each one again.Statement ①: AB=BC=CA implies equilateral. That&#39;s definitionally correct.Statement ②: All angles equal. Since in Euclidean geometry, equiangular triangles are equilateral, yes.Statement ③: Two angles 60 degrees. Then third angle must be 60, so all angles equal. Hence, equilateral. Correct.Statement ④: Isosceles with one angle 60. Whether the 60 is the vertex or base angle, the other angles become 60, so equilateral. Correct.Therefore, all four are correct, so the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Let&#39;s analyze each statement about triangle triangle ABC:1. Statement ①: If AB = BC = CA, then triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle.     - This is true by definition, as an equilateral triangle has all sides equal.     Conclusion: Correct.2. Statement ②: If angle A = angle B = angle C, then triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle.     - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ. If all angles are equal, each angle is 60^circ. An equiangular triangle is also equilateral.     Conclusion: Correct.3. Statement ③: A triangle with two angles both equal to 60^circ is an equilateral triangle.     - If two angles are 60^circ, the third angle is 180^circ - 60^circ - 60^circ = 60^circ. All angles are 60^circ, making it equilateral.     Conclusion: Correct.4. Statement ④: An isosceles triangle with one angle of 60^circ is an equilateral triangle.     - If the 60^circ angle is a base angle, the other base angle is 60^circ, leaving 60^circ for the third angle. If the 60^circ angle is the vertex angle, the base angles are (180^circ - 60^circ)/2 = 60^circ. In both cases, all angles are 60^circ, making it equilateral.

Hmm, let me recall some logarithm properties. Maybe I can convert them to the same base to compare more easily? Or perhaps use natural logarithms? Let&#39;s see.First, I remember that log_b a can be written as (ln a)/(ln b). So, log₃4 is ln4/ln3, and log₄5 is ln5/ln4. So, if I compute both of these values, I can compare them. But since I don&#39;t have a calculator, maybe there&#39;s another way.Alternatively, maybe I can compare them by cross-multiplying. Let&#39;s denote A = log₃4 and B = log₄5. Then:A = ln4 / ln3B = ln5 / ln4To compare A and B, let&#39;s see if A &gt; B. That would mean:ln4 / ln3 &gt; ln5 / ln4Cross-multiplying (assuming all logarithms are positive, which they are here since 3,4,5 are greater than 1):(ln4)^2 &gt; ln3 * ln5So, if (ln4)^2 is greater than ln3*ln5, then log₃4 is greater. Otherwise, log₄5 is greater.Now, let&#39;s compute approximate values. But without a calculator, maybe estimate the natural logs.I know that ln3 ≈ 1.0986, ln4 ≈ 1.3863, ln5 ≈ 1.6094. Wait, these are approximate values I remember. Let me check:ln2 ≈ 0.6931, so ln4 = 2 ln2 ≈ 1.3862ln3 is about 1.0986 because e^1 = 2.718..., so e^1.1 ≈ 3? Wait, no. Wait, e^1.0986 ≈ 3. That&#39;s correct because ln3 ≈ 1.0986.Similarly, ln5 is approximately 1.6094 because e^1.6094 ≈ 5.So, ln4 ≈ 1.3863, so (ln4)^2 ≈ (1.3863)^2. Let&#39;s compute that:1.3863 * 1.3863. Let&#39;s do this step by step.First, 1 * 1.3863 = 1.38630.3 * 1.3863 = 0.415890.08 * 1.3863 = 0.1109040.006 * 1.3863 = 0.00831780.0003 * 1.3863 = 0.00041589Adding these up:1.3863 + 0.41589 = 1.802191.80219 + 0.110904 = 1.9130941.913094 + 0.0083178 ≈ 1.92141181.9214118 + 0.00041589 ≈ 1.9218277So, approximately 1.9218.Now, ln3 * ln5 ≈ 1.0986 * 1.6094.Let&#39;s compute that:1 * 1.6094 = 1.60940.0986 * 1.6094 ≈ 0.0986*1.6 = 0.15776, and 0.0986*0.0094≈0.000928, so total ≈ 0.15776 + 0.000928 ≈ 0.158688Adding to 1.6094: 1.6094 + 0.158688 ≈ 1.768088.So, (ln4)^2 ≈ 1.9218 and ln3*ln5 ≈ 1.7681. Therefore, (ln4)^2 &gt; ln3*ln5, which implies that A &gt; B, so log₃4 &gt; log₄5.But wait, just to be sure, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check again.First, (ln4)^2: ln4 is 1.386294..., so squaring that:1.386294 * 1.386294. Let&#39;s use a better method.(1.386294)^2 = (1 + 0.386294)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.386294 + (0.386294)^2= 1 + 0.772588 + 0.149223= 1 + 0.772588 = 1.7725881.772588 + 0.149223 ≈ 1.921811So, that&#39;s correct.ln3*ln5 ≈ 1.0986 * 1.6094. Let me compute 1.0986 * 1.6094:First, multiply 1 * 1.6094 = 1.6094Then, 0.0986 * 1.6094:Compute 0.09 * 1.6094 = 0.1448460.0086 * 1.6094 ≈ 0.013840Adding those: 0.144846 + 0.013840 ≈ 0.158686So total is 1.6094 + 0.158686 ≈ 1.768086Thus, 1.9218 &gt; 1.7681, so indeed (ln4)^2 &gt; ln3*ln5, so log₃4 &gt; log₄5.Alternatively, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s consider the function f(x) = log_x (x+1). We need to see if this function is increasing or decreasing. If it&#39;s decreasing, then log₃4 &gt; log₄5. Let&#39;s check.Take derivative of f(x) = ln(x+1)/lnx.Compute derivative using quotient rule:f&#39;(x) = [ (1/(x+1)) * lnx - ln(x+1) * (1/x) ] / (lnx)^2Simplify numerator:[ lnx / (x+1) - ln(x+1)/x ]Not sure about the sign. Maybe test for x=3 and x=4.But perhaps this is more complicated. Alternatively, consider the difference between log₃4 and log₄5.Alternatively, use change of base to same base and compare.Wait, another idea. Let&#39;s raise both numbers to some power to compare.But since they are logarithms, maybe exponentiate them with base 3 and base 4 respectively.Wait, if A = log₃4, then 3^A = 4.Similarly, B = log₄5, then 4^B = 5.So, we can compare 3^A = 4 vs. 4^B =5. But how does that help? Maybe compare 3^A and 4^B.But 3^A =4 and 4^B=5, so 3^A=4, 4^B=5. So, 3^A *4^B =4*5=20. Not sure.Alternatively, maybe find integers such that 3^m vs 4^n? Not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s compare the exponents required for 3 and 4 to reach 4 and 5. So, 3^A=4, which is 3^(log₃4)=4. Similarly, 4^B=5.But how do these relate? Maybe if we can compare A and B in terms of exponents. For example, if we can find a common exponent where 3^something and 4^something can be compared, but not sure.Alternatively, maybe consider the function f(x) = log_x (x+1) and see if it&#39;s decreasing. If f(3) &gt; f(4), then log₃4 &gt; log₄5.Let me compute f(3) = log_3 4 ≈ 1.26186, f(4) = log_4 5 ≈ 1.16096. So, f(3) &gt; f(4). So, the function is decreasing. Therefore, as x increases, f(x) decreases. Therefore, log₃4 is greater than log₄5.But how do I know the function is decreasing? Maybe compute derivative.As above, f(x) = ln(x+1)/lnx. Then f&#39;(x) = [ (1/(x+1) * lnx - ln(x+1)/x ) ] / (lnx)^2.The sign of f&#39;(x) depends on the numerator: (lnx)/(x+1) - ln(x+1)/x.Let me check for x=3:Numerator: (ln3)/4 - (ln4)/3 ≈ (1.0986)/4 - (1.3863)/3 ≈ 0.27465 - 0.4621 ≈ -0.18745 &lt;0Therefore, f&#39;(3) &lt;0, so function is decreasing at x=3.Similarly, for x=4:Numerator: (ln4)/5 - (ln5)/4 ≈1.3863/5 -1.6094/4≈0.27726 -0.40235≈-0.12509 &lt;0So, derivative is negative, so function is decreasing. Therefore, since the function f(x) = log_x(x+1) is decreasing, then f(3) &gt; f(4), so log_34 &gt; log_45.Therefore, the answer is log base 3 of 4 is greater.Alternatively, another way: note that log_b a is the exponent needed for b to reach a. So, log_3 4 is how many times we need to multiply 3 to get 4. Similarly, log_4 5 is the exponent for 4 to reach 5.But maybe it&#39;s difficult to compare directly.Alternatively, use inequalities. For example, log_3 4 vs log_4 5.Note that log_b a = 1 / log_a b. So, log_3 4 = 1 / log_4 3. Wait, but not sure.Alternatively, use the change of base formula to base 10.log_3 4 = log10 4 / log10 3 ≈ 0.60206 / 0.47712 ≈ 1.26186log_4 5 = log10 5 / log10 4 ≈ 0.69897 / 0.60206 ≈ 1.16096Therefore, 1.26186 &gt; 1.16096, so log_3 4 is greater.But since the problem doesn&#39;t allow using calculators, but perhaps I can estimate these values.Alternatively, approximate logarithms.For log_3 4: since 3^1 =3, 3^1.26186≈4. Let&#39;s see, 3^1 =3, 3^(1.26186). How to estimate this? Maybe note that 3^(1/2) = sqrt(3) ≈1.732, 3^1=3, 3^(1.26186). Alternatively, 3^(1 + log_3 4/3). Not sure.Alternatively, use the fact that 3^1.26186≈4. Let&#39;s see, 3^1.2 is 3^(1 + 0.2) =3 *3^0.2. 3^0.2 is e^(0.2 ln3) ≈1 +0.2 ln3 + ... Maybe approximate with Taylor series, but this might be complicated.Alternatively, note that 3^1 =3, 3^1.1≈3*3^0.1≈3*1.116≈3.348, 3^1.2≈3.348*1.116≈3.742, 3^1.3≈3.742*1.116≈4.177. So, 3^1.3≈4.177&gt;4. So, log_34 is between 1.2 and1.3, closer to 1.26.Similarly, log_45: 4^1=4, 4^1.1≈4*4^0.1. 4^0.1 is approximately e^(0.1 ln4)≈1 +0.1*1.386 + ...≈1.1386. So, 4*1.1386≈4.554. 4^1.1≈4.554. 4^1.15≈4*4^0.15. 4^0.15≈e^(0.15*1.386)≈e^0.2079≈1.230. So, 4*1.230≈4.920. So, 4^1.15≈4.92, which is close to 5. Therefore, log_45≈1.15.Therefore, log_34≈1.26 vs log_45≈1.15. So, log_34 is greater.Alternatively, another approach: consider the numbers 3,4,5.Let’s see:log_3 4 = 1 + log_3 (4/3) ≈1 + log_3(1.333)Similarly, log_45 =1 + log_4(5/4)=1 + log_4(1.25)Compare log_3(1.333) and log_4(1.25). Which is bigger?But log_b(1 + x) for x small. Maybe approximate with natural logs.log_3(1.333)= ln(1.333)/ln3≈0.2877/1.0986≈0.262So log_34≈1.262log_4(1.25)= ln(1.25)/ln4≈0.2231/1.3863≈0.161So log_45≈1.161Therefore, again, log_34 is bigger.Alternatively, another method: cross-exponiate.Let me see: Compare A = log_34 and B = log_45.Suppose we compare 3^B and 4^A. Wait, 3^B vs 4^A. Since 3^B =3^(log_45) and 4^A=4^(log_34)= (4^log_34)= (3^log_34)^log_34= not sure.Alternatively, use the identity that a^(log_b c) = c^(log_b a). Hmm.Wait, 3^B =3^(log_45). Let me compute that. 3^(log_45) = e^(ln3 * log_45) = e^(ln3 * (ln5/ln4)) )=5^(ln3/ln4). Similarly, 4^A=4^(log_34)= e^(ln4 * log_34)= e^(ln4 * (ln4/ln3))= e^((ln4)^2 / ln3)=3^((ln4)^2 / (ln3)^2). Wait, this seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps use the inequality between arithmetic and geometric mean. Let&#39;s see.We have two numbers ln4 and ln4. Wait, perhaps not.Alternatively, consider the numbers ln3, ln4, ln5. Let me think.Wait, since (ln4)^2 vs ln3*ln5. If we can show (ln4)^2 &gt; ln3*ln5, which we did numerically before.Alternatively, using the fact that ln4 is the average of ln3 and ln5? Let&#39;s check:Average of ln3 and ln5 is (1.0986 +1.6094)/2≈1.354, while ln4≈1.3863. So, ln4 is larger than the average. So, (ln4)^2 compared to (average)^2 vs ln3*ln5.Since ln4 &gt; average, (ln4)^2 &gt; (average)^2. But (average)^2 = ((ln3 + ln5)/2)^2. And by AM ≥ GM, (ln3 + ln5)/2 ≥ sqrt(ln3*ln5). So, (average)^2 ≥ ln3*ln5. Therefore, since (ln4)^2 &gt; (average)^2 ≥ ln3*ln5, we have (ln4)^2 &gt; ln3*ln5. Therefore, log_34 &gt; log_45.This is a better approach, using inequalities.Therefore, since ln4 is greater than the average of ln3 and ln5, then (ln4)^2 is greater than the product ln3*ln5, hence log_34 &gt; log_45.Hence, the answer is log base 3 of 4 is greater.Final AnswerThe greater value is boxed{log_{3}4}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether (log_{3} 4) or (log_{4} 5) is greater, we start by converting these logarithms to natural logarithms:[log_{3} 4 = frac{ln 4}{ln 3} quad text{and} quad log_{4} 5 = frac{ln 5}{ln 4}]We need to compare (frac{ln 4}{ln 3}) and (frac{ln 5}{ln 4}). Cross-multiplying gives us the inequality:[(ln 4)^2 quad text{vs} quad ln 3 cdot ln 5]We approximate the natural logarithms:- (ln 3 approx 1.0986)- (ln 4 approx 1.3863)- (ln 5 approx 1.6094)Calculating ((ln 4)^2):[(1.3863)^2 approx 1.9218]Calculating (ln 3 cdot ln 5):[1.0986 cdot 1.6094 approx 1.7681]Since (1.9218 &gt; 1.7681), we conclude that ((ln 4)^2 &gt; ln 3 cdot ln 5). Therefore, (frac{ln 4}{ln 3} &gt; frac{ln 5}{ln 4}), which means (log_{3} 4 &gt; log_{4} 5).Additionally, considering the function (f(x) = log_x (x+1)) is decreasing, we confirm that (f(3) &gt; f(4)), further supporting that (log_{3} 4) is greater.Thus, the greater value is (boxed{log_{3}4}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out whether log base 3 of 4 is greater than log base 4 of 5, or the other way around. Hmm, comparing logarithms with different bases can be tricky. Let me think about the methods I know for comparing logarithms.One approach might be to convert both logarithms to the same base so I can compare them directly. Since natural logarithm or common logarithm can be used, maybe I can use the change of base formula. The change of base formula says that log_b a = (ln a) / (ln b). So, if I apply that here:log₃4 = ln4 / ln3log₄5 = ln5 / ln4So now I need to compare ln4 / ln3 and ln5 / ln4. Let me compute the numerical values of these. But wait, maybe I can do this without a calculator? Let me see.Alternatively, another method is to use the property that if log_b a &gt; log_c d, then when converted to exponents, it&#39;s equivalent to comparing b^{log_c d} and a. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe cross-multiplying the fractions?Since we have two fractions: (ln4 / ln3) vs (ln5 / ln4). If I cross-multiply, the inequality would hold the same direction if all terms are positive, which they are here because logarithms of numbers greater than 1 are positive. So cross-multiplying gives (ln4)^2 vs (ln3)(ln5). So if (ln4)^2 &gt; (ln3)(ln5), then log₃4 &gt; log₄5, and vice versa.So, the problem reduces to comparing (ln4)^2 and (ln3)(ln5). Let me compute approximate values for these.First, let me recall natural logarithm values:ln2 ≈ 0.6931ln3 ≈ 1.0986ln4 = 2ln2 ≈ 1.3862ln5 ≈ 1.6094So, compute (ln4)^2 ≈ (1.3862)^2 ≈ 1.3862 * 1.3862Let me calculate that:1.3862 * 1.3862First, 1 * 1.3862 = 1.38620.3 * 1.3862 = 0.415860.08 * 1.3862 = 0.1108960.0062 * 1.3862 ≈ 0.008594Adding them together: 1.3862 + 0.41586 = 1.80206; +0.110896 = 1.912956; +0.008594 ≈ 1.92155So approximately 1.9216Now, compute (ln3)(ln5) ≈ 1.0986 * 1.6094Let&#39;s do this multiplication:1 * 1.6094 = 1.60940.0986 * 1.6094First, 0.09 * 1.6094 = 0.144846Then, 0.0086 * 1.6094 ≈ 0.013840Adding these: 0.144846 + 0.013840 ≈ 0.158686So total is 1.6094 + 0.158686 ≈ 1.768086So approximately 1.7681Comparing the two results: (ln4)^2 ≈ 1.9216 and (ln3)(ln5) ≈ 1.7681. Since 1.9216 &gt; 1.7681, therefore (ln4)^2 &gt; (ln3)(ln5), which implies that log₃4 &gt; log₄5.Wait, but let me verify if my calculations are correct. Maybe I made an approximation error.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way without approximating. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, consider the function f(x) = log_x (x+1). We can analyze whether this function is increasing or decreasing. If it&#39;s decreasing, then log_3 4 &gt; log_4 5, since as x increases, f(x) decreases.To check if f(x) is increasing or decreasing, let&#39;s take the derivative. Let’s set f(x) = ln(x+1)/lnx. Compute its derivative.Using the quotient rule: f’(x) = [ (1/(x+1) * lnx - ln(x+1) * (1/x) ) ] / (lnx)^2Simplify numerator:[ lnx / (x + 1) - ln(x + 1)/x ]To check the sign of the derivative, which would determine if f is increasing or decreasing.But maybe it&#39;s complicated to analyze. Alternatively, compute f(3) and f(4). If f(3) &gt; f(4), then log_3 4 &gt; log_4 5.But that&#39;s what we are trying to find in the first place. So maybe this approach is circular.Alternatively, another method: express both logarithms in terms of exponents. For log_3 4, it&#39;s the number x such that 3^x = 4. For log_4 5, it&#39;s the number y such that 4^y = 5. So compare x and y.So, if we can compare 3^x = 4 and 4^y = 5, perhaps take both equations and manipulate them.Alternatively, use the inequality between arithmetic and geometric mean. Not sure.Alternatively, raise both sides to some power. For example, if we let a = log_3 4, then 3^a = 4. Let b = log_4 5, then 4^b = 5. We need to compare a and b.So, 3^a = 4 and 4^b = 5. Let’s express 5 in terms of 3. 4^b = 5 → (3^a)^b = 5 → 3^{ab} = 5. So, 3^{ab} = 5. Take log base 3: ab = log_3 5 ≈ 1.4649...But a = log_3 4 ≈ 1.26186. Then, if ab ≈ 1.4649, then b ≈ 1.4649 / 1.26186 ≈ 1.161. Meanwhile, log_4 5 ≈ 1.1606. So, according to this, it&#39;s approximately equal? Wait, but when I calculated earlier, the cross-multiplied values gave that (ln4)^2 ≈ 1.9216 and (ln3)(ln5) ≈1.7681, which suggested log_3 4 is bigger. But maybe my approximate calculations were off.Wait, perhaps my approximated values for ln3, ln4, ln5 are okay, but when multiplied, maybe they accumulate errors. Let me check with more precise values.Looking up exact values:ln3 ≈ 1.098612289ln4 ≈ 1.386294361ln5 ≈ 1.609437912Compute (ln4)^2: 1.386294361^2Let me compute this more accurately:1.386294361 * 1.386294361First, compute 1 * 1.386294361 = 1.3862943610.3 * 1.386294361 = 0.41588830830.08 * 1.386294361 = 0.11090354890.006294361 * 1.386294361 ≈ Let&#39;s compute 0.006 * 1.386294361 = 0.008317766Plus 0.000294361 * 1.386294361 ≈ 0.00040813So total ≈ 0.008317766 + 0.00040813 ≈ 0.008725896Adding all parts: 1.386294361 + 0.4158883083 = 1.802182669+ 0.1109035489 = 1.913086218+ 0.008725896 ≈ 1.921812114So (ln4)^2 ≈ 1.921812114Now compute (ln3)(ln5):1.098612289 * 1.609437912Let&#39;s compute this step by step:1 * 1.609437912 = 1.6094379120.098612289 * 1.609437912First, compute 0.09 * 1.609437912 = 0.1448494120.008612289 * 1.609437912 ≈ 0.013852649Adding those: 0.144849412 + 0.013852649 ≈ 0.158702061So total is 1.609437912 + 0.158702061 ≈ 1.768139973So (ln3)(ln5) ≈ 1.768139973Comparing 1.921812114 vs 1.768139973, clearly the first is larger. Therefore, (ln4)^2 &gt; (ln3)(ln5), which implies that ln4 / ln3 &gt; ln5 / ln4, so log₃4 &gt; log₄5.Therefore, the answer is that log base 3 of 4 is greater than log base 4 of 5.Alternatively, to confirm, let me compute approximate decimal values for both logarithms.log₃4 = ln4 / ln3 ≈ 1.386294361 / 1.098612289 ≈ 1.261859507log₄5 = ln5 / ln4 ≈ 1.609437912 / 1.386294361 ≈ 1.160964047Comparing 1.261859507 and 1.160964047, yes, log base 3 of 4 is indeed larger.Therefore, the conclusion is correct.Final AnswerThe greater value is boxed{log _{3} 4}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether (log_{3} 4) or (log_{4} 5) is greater, we can use the change of base formula to convert both logarithms to natural logarithms and compare them:[log_{3} 4 = frac{ln 4}{ln 3} quad text{and} quad log_{4} 5 = frac{ln 5}{ln 4}]We need to compare (frac{ln 4}{ln 3}) and (frac{ln 5}{ln 4}). Cross-multiplying the fractions, we compare ((ln 4)^2) and ((ln 3)(ln 5)).Using approximate values for the natural logarithms:- (ln 3 approx 1.0986)- (ln 4 approx 1.3863)- (ln 5 approx 1.6094)Calculating ((ln 4)^2):[(ln 4)^2 approx (1.3863)^2 approx 1.9218]Calculating ((ln 3)(ln 5)):[(ln 3)(ln 5) approx 1.0986 times 1.6094 approx 1.7681]Since (1.9218 &gt; 1.7681), we conclude that ((ln 4)^2 &gt; (ln 3)(ln 5)), which implies (frac{ln 4}{ln 3} &gt; frac{ln 5}{ln 4}). Therefore, (log_{3} 4) is greater than (log_{4} 5).Additionally, converting the logarithms to decimal form confirms this result:- (log_{3} 4 approx 1.2619)- (log_{4} 5 approx 1.1610)Thus, the greater value is (boxed{log_{3} 4}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-09220ead></div><p class="review-content" data-v-09220ead><span class="icon" data-v-09220ead>🔑:</span>Given the equalities log _{3} 4=x and log _{4} 5=y, we have: 3^{x}=4,4^{y}=5, x&gt;1, y&gt;1.

First, problem (1) has two parts: finding the complement of the intersection of A and B, and then finding the union of the complement of B and A. Let me start by understanding what the sets A and B are.Set A is defined as {x | 3 ≤ x &lt; 6}. So this includes all real numbers from 3 up to but not including 6. Similarly, set B is {x | 2 &lt; x &lt; 9}, which includes all real numbers greater than 2 and less than 9. First, I need to find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are in both A and B. Since A starts at 3 (including 3) and goes up to 6, while B starts just above 2 and goes up to 9, their intersection should be the overlapping part of both sets. So the intersection would start at 3 (since A starts at 3 and B includes numbers greater than 2, so 3 is included) and end at 6 (since A stops before 6 and B goes up to 9, so the overlapping upper bound is 6). Therefore, A ∩ B should be [3, 6). Wait, but actually, A is [3,6) and B is (2,9), so their intersection is [3,6). Hmm, is that correct? Because in B, it&#39;s open at 2, so 2 is not included, but since A starts at 3, which is included, the intersection starts at 3, closed at 3, and goes up to 6, open at 6. So yes, A ∩ B = [3,6).Now, the complement of A ∩ B in R. The complement of a set in R would be all real numbers not in that set. So, the complement of [3,6) would be (-∞, 3) ∪ [6, ∞). Let me confirm. Since [3,6) is all numbers from 3 to 6, including 3 but not 6. So the complement is everything less than 3, or greater or equal to 6. Yep, that&#39;s right. So ∁ℝ(A ∩ B) = (-∞,3) ∪ [6, ∞).Now the second part of (1): (∁ℝ B) ∪ A. Let&#39;s break this down. First, find the complement of B. B is (2,9), so its complement in R is (-∞,2] ∪ [9, ∞). Then, take the union of that complement with set A, which is [3,6). So let&#39;s see. The complement of B is (-∞,2] ∪ [9, ∞). Union with A [3,6) would connect the two intervals. Let&#39;s visualize:- The first part of the complement is (-∞,2], and the second part is [9, ∞). Then A is [3,6). So combining (-∞,2] with [3,6) gives (-∞,6), because between 2 and 3, there&#39;s a gap from (2,3). Wait, no. Wait, hold on. If we take (-∞,2] ∪ [9, ∞) and union with [3,6), then we have (-∞,2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞). Because [3,6) doesn&#39;t overlap with (-∞,2] or [9, ∞). So the union would just be those three intervals combined. Let me check. So the union is all numbers less than or equal to 2, or between 3 and 6 (including 3, not 6), or greater or equal to 9. So between 2 and 3, there&#39;s a gap (2,3). So the union isn&#39;t a continuous interval. Therefore, the answer is (-∞,2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞). Is that correct? Let me make sure.Original sets: ∁ℝ B is (-∞,2] ∪ [9, ∞). A is [3,6). When you take the union, you combine all elements that are in either set. So numbers ≤2, or between 3 and 6, or ≥9. Yes, that&#39;s right. So (∁ℝ B) ∪ A = (-∞,2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞).So that&#39;s part (1). Now part (2): Given C = {x | a &lt; x &lt; a + 1}, if C is a subset of B, find the set of values for the real number a.First, set C is an interval from a to a+1, open at both ends. So it&#39;s all real numbers between a and a+1. Set B is (2,9). So we need to find all a such that the interval (a, a+1) is entirely contained within (2,9). To have (a, a+1) ⊆ (2,9), we need two conditions:1. The left endpoint a must be greater than or equal to 2. But since the interval is open at a, if a is 2, then the interval starts just above 2, which is okay because B starts at just above 2. Wait, but B is (2,9), which is open at 2 and 9. So if a is 2, then C would be (2,3), which is entirely within B. Similarly, if a is 8, then C is (8,9), which is still within B. If a is 8.5, then C is (8.5,9.5), but 9.5 is outside of B&#39;s upper limit of 9, so that&#39;s not allowed. So, to ensure that the entire interval (a, a+1) is within (2,9), the left endpoint a must be ≥2 and the right endpoint a+1 must be ≤9. But since intervals are open, even if a is exactly 2, as long as a+1 is less than 9, but wait: If a +1 ≤9, then a ≤8. But if a is 8, then a+1 is 9, but since the interval is open at a+1=9, which is the same as B being open at 9. So (8,9) is okay. Wait, but B is open at 9, so C=(8,9) is entirely within B, because B is up to but not including 9. Similarly, if a=8, then C=(8,9) is okay. If a=7.5, C=(7.5,8.5), which is fine. So the constraints are:a ≥2 (so that the left side of C is at least 2), and a +1 ≤9 (so that the right side of C is at most 9, but since it&#39;s open, it&#39;s okay if a+1=9? Wait, but a+1 has to be less than or equal to 9? Wait, no. Since C is (a, a+1), and B is (2,9), for C to be entirely within B, we need that a ≥2 and a+1 ≤9. Because even if a=2, then C=(2,3) which is in B. If a=8, then a+1=9, so C=(8,9) which is still in B because B doesn&#39;t include 9. However, if a=8.1, then a+1=9.1, so C=(8.1,9.1), which is not entirely in B=(2,9) because from 9 to 9.1 is outside. Therefore, to ensure that a+1 ≤9, a must be ≤8. Therefore, combining both conditions, a must satisfy 2 ≤a ≤8.Wait, but let me test with a=8. Then C=(8,9), which is entirely in B=(2,9). Correct. If a=2, C=(2,3), also in B. If a=7.9, C=(7.9,8.9), which is in B. If a=8.0, C=(8.0,9.0), which is in B. But if a=8.0, a+1=9.0, but since the interval is open, 9.0 is not included, so it&#39;s okay. So the upper limit for a is a ≤8, because if a=8, then a+1=9, which is the upper limit of B, but since B is open at 9, C=(8,9) is still within B. So the constraints should be 2 ≤a ≤8.Hence, the set of possible a is [2,8].Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with a=2. If a=2, then C=(2,3). B is (2,9), so (2,3) is entirely in B. Good. If a=8, C=(8,9), which is entirely in B. If a is slightly less than 2, like a=1.9, then C=(1.9,2.9). But B starts at 2, so the interval (1.9,2.9) includes numbers less than 2, which are not in B. Therefore, a must be at least 2. Similarly, if a is 8.1, then C=(8.1,9.1), which includes numbers up to 9.1, which are not in B. Therefore, a must be at most 8.Therefore, the set of possible a is [2,8]. So a can be any real number between 2 and 8, inclusive. Wait, but the interval C is defined as a &lt; x &lt; a+1. So if a=2, then C=(2,3). Since B is (2,9), which is also open at 2, but the point is, C starts at 2, but open, so it&#39;s okay. Since B is open at 2, but C is also open at 2, so (2,3) is entirely within (2,9). Similarly, if a=8, C=(8,9), which is entirely within (2,9). So yes, a can be 2 or 8. Therefore, the values of a are from 2 to 8, inclusive.Therefore, the answer for part (2) is a ∈ [2,8].Let me recap:Problem (1):1. ∁ℝ(A ∩ B) = ∁ℝ([3,6)) = (-∞,3) ∪ [6, ∞)2. (∁ℝ B) ∪ A = (-∞,2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞)Problem (2):C is a subset of B when a is between 2 and 8, inclusive. So a ∈ [2,8]I think that&#39;s correct. Let me double-check.For problem (1):First part: A ∩ B is [3,6), complement is everything not in that interval. So numbers less than 3 or greater or equal to 6. Correct.Second part: Complement of B is (-∞,2] ∪ [9, ∞). Then union with A [3,6). So combining those gives (-∞,2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞). Correct.For problem (2):To ensure that the entire interval (a, a+1) is inside (2,9), the left endpoint a must be at least 2, and the right endpoint a+1 must be at most 9. So solving 2 ≤ a and a+1 ≤9 gives 2 ≤a ≤8. So a ∈ [2,8]. Correct.Yes, I think that&#39;s all correct.Final Answer(1) boxed{(-infty, 3) cup [6, infty)} and boxed{(-infty, 2] cup [3, 6) cup [9, infty)};  (2) boxed{[2, 8]}&lt;/think&gt;Given sets ( A = {x mid 3 leq x &lt; 6} ) and ( B = {x mid 2 &lt; x &lt; 9} ):1. Finding (complement_{mathbb{R}}(A cap B)) and ((complement_{mathbb{R}} B) cup A):   - Intersection (A cap B):      - ( A = [3, 6) ) and ( B = (2, 9) )     - The intersection ( A cap B ) is ( [3, 6) )     - Complement of ( [3, 6) ) in (mathbb{R}) is ( (-infty, 3) cup [6, infty) )     - (boxed{(-infty, 3) cup [6, infty)})   - Complement of (B) and union with (A):     - Complement of ( B = (2, 9) ) in (mathbb{R}) is ( (-infty, 2] cup [9, infty) )     - Union with ( A = [3, 6) ) results in ( (-infty, 2] cup [3, 6) cup [9, infty) )     - (boxed{(-infty, 2] cup [3, 6) cup [9, infty)})2. Finding values of (a) such that (C = {x mid a &lt; x &lt; a + 1} subseteq B):   - ( C ) must be entirely within ( B = (2, 9) )   - For ( C subseteq B ), the conditions are ( a geq 2 ) and ( a + 1 leq 9 )   - Solving these gives ( 2 leq a leq 8 )   - (boxed{[2, 8]}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have two sets A and B defined as intervals. A is from 3 to 6, including 3 but not 6. B is from 2 to 9, not including either 2 or 9. The first part of the problem asks me to find the complement of the intersection of A and B, and then the union of the complement of B and A. Then the second part is about another set C, which is an interval from a to a+1, and I need to find the values of a such that C is a subset of B. Alright, let&#39;s take it step by step.Starting with part (1). The first thing is to find A intersection B. Since both A and B are intervals, their intersection should be the overlap between the two intervals. Let me write down their definitions again:A = {x | 3 ≤ x &lt; 6}B = {x | 2 &lt; x &lt; 9}So A starts at 3, including 3, and goes up to 6, not including 6. B starts after 2 and goes up to 9. The overlap between these two intervals would be from 3 to 6, right? Because A is entirely within B except for the part before 3. But since A starts at 3 and B starts after 2, their intersection should be A itself. Wait, let me confirm.The intersection of A and B is the set of all x that are in both A and B. Since A is [3, 6) and B is (2, 9), the numbers from 3 to 6 are in both A and B. Because B starts at 2, which is less than 3, and ends at 9, which is greater than 6. So the overlapping region is exactly A. Therefore, A ∩ B = A. Is that correct? Wait, but A includes 3, and B doesn&#39;t include 2, but does B include 3? Wait, B is defined as 2 &lt; x &lt; 9, so 3 is included in B since 3 is greater than 2. So A is [3,6), B is (2,9). Therefore, the intersection is [3,6) ∩ (2,9) = [3,6). Because all elements in [3,6) are in (2,9). So yes, A ∩ B = A. Wait, but is that true? Let&#39;s check an endpoint. The lower bound of A is 3, which is included in A. Since B is (2,9), 3 is included in B because 3 &gt; 2. So 3 is in both A and B. The upper bound of A is 6, which is excluded. The upper bound of B is 9, which is also excluded. So the intersection is all x such that 3 ≤ x &lt; 6, which is exactly A. Therefore, A ∩ B = A. Therefore, the complement of A ∩ B would be the complement of A in R.But wait, the problem says &quot;complement_R&quot;, which I assume is the complement with respect to the real numbers. So the complement of a set S in R is R  S. So, complement_R(A ∩ B) is R  (A ∩ B) = R  A, since A ∩ B = A.So, R  A is all real numbers less than 3 or greater or equal to 6. So written in interval notation, that would be (-∞, 3) ∪ [6, ∞). Is that right? Let me confirm. A is [3,6), so its complement is everything outside of that interval. So yes, numbers less than 3, and numbers 6 or greater. Since 6 is not included in A, it is included in the complement. So that seems correct.Now moving on to the second part of (1): (complement_R B) ∪ A.First, let&#39;s find complement_R B. B is (2,9), so its complement is (-∞, 2] ∪ [9, ∞). Because B is all real numbers between 2 and 9, not including 2 and 9. Therefore, the complement is everything outside, which includes 2 and 9.Then, we need to take the union of complement_R B and A. So, complement_R B is (-∞, 2] ∪ [9, ∞), and A is [3,6). So the union of these two sets would be (-∞, 2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞). Wait, is that correct?Wait, let&#39;s see. The union of (-∞, 2] ∪ [9, ∞) and [3,6). Since [3,6) is between 2 and 9, but complement_R B doesn&#39;t include (2,9). So when we take the union, we&#39;re adding [3,6) to the complement of B. So the resulting set would be (-∞, 2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞). Because between 2 and 3, there&#39;s a gap from (2,3), which is not included in either complement_R B or A. Then from 3 to 6, it&#39;s included in A, so that&#39;s added. Then from 6 to 9, it&#39;s not included in either, so that&#39;s still part of the original complement. Wait, no. Wait, complement_R B is (-∞, 2] ∪ [9, ∞). Then we take the union with A = [3,6). So the union is all points that are in either (-∞, 2] ∪ [9, ∞) or in [3,6). So yes, combining those intervals, since [3,6) is between 2 and 9, which is not overlapping with (-∞, 2] or [9, ∞), so the union is three separate intervals: (-∞, 2], [3,6), and [9, ∞). Therefore, written as (-∞, 2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞). Is that the final answer? Let me check again. If I take (-∞, 2] union [3,6), that gives (-∞, 2] ∪ [3,6), and then union [9, ∞). Yes, that&#39;s correct.So part (1) answers are complement_R(A ∩ B) = (-∞, 3) ∪ [6, ∞) and (complement_R B) ∪ A = (-∞, 2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞).Now moving on to part (2). Given C = {x | a &lt; x &lt; a + 1}, which is an interval from a to a+1, open interval. We need to find the set of values for real number a such that C is a subset of B. Recall that B is (2,9). So, we need to ensure that the entire interval C lies within B. So, for C to be a subset of B, every element of C must be in B. Therefore, the interval (a, a+1) must be entirely contained within (2,9). So that means the lower bound of C, which is a, must be greater than or equal to the lower bound of B, which is 2. But since B is open at 2, C must start at a point where a is at least 2. However, since C is open at a, even if a is 2, the interval (2,3) is within B, which is (2,9). Wait, but B is (2,9), so 2 is excluded. However, if a is 2, then C is (2,3), which is okay because B is (2,9), so all elements in (2,3) are in B. Similarly, the upper bound of C is a+1, which must be less than or equal to 9. But since B is open at 9, a+1 must be less than or equal to 9. Wait, no, because C is open at a+1, so if a+1 is 9, then C is (8,9), which is still within B. But if a+1 is 9, then C is (8,9), which is fine. If a+1 is greater than 9, then C would include numbers up to a+1, which is beyond 9, so that&#39;s not allowed. Therefore, to have C ⊆ B, the interval (a, a+1) must be entirely within (2,9). Therefore, the conditions are:1. a ≥ 2 (since the lower bound of C, which is a, must be at least 2. But since C is open at a, even if a is 2, C starts just above 2, which is within B&#39;s lower bound of 2, which is open. Wait, but actually, if a is 2, then C is (2, 3). Since B is (2,9), which does not include 2, but C is (2,3), which is entirely within B. Similarly, the upper bound a+1 must be ≤ 9. But since C is open at a+1, even if a+1 is 9, C is (8,9), which is okay because B is open at 9.Wait, let&#39;s formalize this. For (a, a+1) ⊆ (2,9), we need:a ≥ 2 (since the left endpoint a must be ≥ 2 to ensure that the interval starts at or after 2. But since (a, a+1) is open at a, even if a is 2, it&#39;s okay.Similarly, the right endpoint a+1 must be ≤ 9. Because if a+1 were greater than 9, then the interval would include numbers up to a+1, which would exceed 9, which is not allowed. Since B is open at 9, the maximum a+1 can be is 9, because (a,9) would still be within (2,9). Therefore:a ≥ 2 and a + 1 ≤ 9.Solving these inequalities:From a + 1 ≤ 9, subtract 1: a ≤ 8.Therefore, combining with a ≥ 2, we get 2 ≤ a ≤ 8.But wait, let me verify with an example. If a = 2, then C = (2,3), which is in B. If a = 8, then C = (8,9), which is in B. If a = 8.5, then C = (8.5, 9.5), which would go up to 9.5, which is outside of B. But a = 8.5 is not allowed because a +1 = 9.5 &gt; 9. Therefore, a must be ≤8. So the condition is 2 ≤ a ≤8.But wait, hold on, is a allowed to be exactly 2? If a is 2, then C is (2,3). Since B is (2,9), which does not include 2, but C is (2,3) which is entirely within B. So yes, a = 2 is okay.Similarly, if a =8, C is (8,9), which is entirely within B. So a=8 is okay.But what if a is less than 2? Let&#39;s say a=1. Then C=(1,2), but B starts at 2, so (1,2) is not entirely within B. So a must be at least 2.Similarly, if a is 8.1, then a+1=9.1, which is outside of B, so that&#39;s not allowed. Therefore, the maximum a can be is 8. So the values of a are from 2 to 8, inclusive.Therefore, the set of values for a is [2,8].But let me double-check. Suppose a is 2. Then C is (2,3), which is in B. Correct. If a is 8, then C is (8,9), which is in B. Correct. If a is 2.5, then C is (2.5,3.5), which is in B. Correct. If a is slightly more than 8, say 8.1, then C is (8.1,9.1), which is not entirely in B. Correct. So yes, a must be between 2 and 8, inclusive. Therefore, the answer is a ∈ [2,8].But wait, let me confirm with another perspective. The interval C is (a, a+1). For this interval to be entirely within B=(2,9), we need:The left endpoint a must satisfy a &gt; 2? Wait, but B is (2,9), so any x in C must satisfy 2 &lt; x &lt;9. But since C is (a, a+1), the smallest element in C is just above a, and the largest is just below a+1. Therefore, to ensure that all x in C satisfy 2 &lt; x &lt;9, we must have:The smallest element in C must be &gt;2, so a ≥2. Because if a were less than 2, then even though the interval is open at a, the elements would approach a from the right, but if a is less than 2, say a=1, then C includes numbers greater than 1 but less than 2, which are not in B. So to ensure that all elements of C are &gt;2, a must be ≥2.Similarly, the largest element in C is just below a+1, which must be &lt;9. Therefore, a+1 ≤9, so a ≤8.Therefore, combining these, a must be ≥2 and ≤8. So the set of a is [2,8]. Hence, the answer is a ∈ [2,8].Yes, that seems consistent.So summarizing:1. (Complement of A intersect B) is (-∞, 3) ∪ [6, ∞)2. (Complement of B) union A is (-∞, 2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞)3. The set of values for a is [2,8]I think that&#39;s all. Let me just check once more.For part (1), since A ∩ B = A, complement is R  A = (-∞,3) ∪ [6, ∞). Correct.Then complement of B is (-∞,2] ∪ [9, ∞). Union with A [3,6) gives (-∞,2] ∪ [3,6) ∪ [9, ∞). Correct.For part (2), C must fit entirely within B=(2,9), so the left end a must be ≥2 and the right end a+1 ≤9 ⇒ a ≤8. So a ∈ [2,8]. Correct.Final Answer(1) boxed{(-infty, 3) cup [6, infty)} and boxed{(-infty, 2] cup [3, 6) cup [9, infty)};(2) boxed{[2, 8]}&lt;/think&gt;Given sets ( A = {x mid 3 leq x &lt; 6} ) and ( B = {x mid 2 &lt; x &lt; 9} ):1.

The problem says that a pair [A₁, A₂] is a subset partition if A₁ ∪ A₂ = A, and that [A₁, A₂] is the same as [A₂, A₁]. So, order doesn&#39;t matter here. First, let me make sure I understand what a subset partition is. It&#39;s a pair of subsets whose union is the entire set A. But they don&#39;t necessarily have to be disjoint, right? Because a partition usually requires disjoint sets, but the problem here just says their union is A. So maybe they can overlap. Hmm. Wait, the term &quot;subset partition&quot; is given a special definition here: it&#39;s a pair of subsets whose union is A, and the order doesn&#39;t matter. So, for example, if A₁ is {1,2} and A₂ is {2,3}, then their union is {1,2,3}, so that&#39;s a valid pair. But since [A₁, A₂] is the same as [A₂, A₁], swapping them doesn&#39;t create a new pair.So the task is to count all such pairs where the two subsets cover the entire set when unioned, considering that swapping the subsets doesn&#39;t count as a new pair. Let me think about how to approach this. Since the set A has 3 elements, each element can be in either A₁, A₂, or both. Wait, but since the union must be A, every element has to be in at least one of the subsets. So for each element, there are three possibilities: only in A₁, only in A₂, or in both. So for each of the 3 elements, there are 3 choices. That would lead to 3^3 = 27 possible ordered pairs (A₁, A₂). But since the problem considers [A₁, A₂] the same as [A₂, A₁], we need to divide by 2 in some way, but maybe not all of them are unique when considering unordered pairs. However, some pairs might be symmetric, meaning A₁ = A₂, so dividing by 2 would not account for those. Therefore, maybe I need to use inclusion-exclusion or another combinatorial approach.Alternatively, maybe we can model this as the number of equivalence classes under the swapping relation. Each unordered pair {A₁, A₂} corresponds to two ordered pairs unless A₁ = A₂. So the total number of unordered pairs is (number of ordered pairs + number of symmetric pairs)/2. Wait, that might be a standard combinatorial technique. Let me recall: if you have a set of ordered pairs and you want unordered pairs where order doesn&#39;t matter, then the number is (total ordered pairs + number of unordered pairs where both elements are the same)/2. Wait, actually, no. The standard formula is that the number of unordered pairs is equal to (number of ordered pairs - number of symmetric pairs)/2 + number of symmetric pairs. Because for the non-symmetric pairs, each unordered pair corresponds to two ordered pairs, so you subtract the symmetric ones, divide by 2, then add back the symmetric ones. So:Number of unordered pairs = (Total ordered pairs - Number of symmetric pairs)/2 + Number of symmetric pairs = (Total ordered pairs + Number of symmetric pairs)/2.Yes, that seems right. So if we denote S as the number of ordered pairs where A₁ = A₂, then the number of unordered pairs would be (27 + S)/2. So we need to compute S, the number of pairs where A₁ = A₂. But wait, A₁ and A₂ must satisfy A₁ ∪ A₂ = A. If A₁ = A₂, then their union is A₁ (since they&#39;re equal), so A₁ must equal A. So the only symmetric pair is [A, A]. Therefore, S = 1. Therefore, the number of unordered pairs would be (27 + 1)/2 = 28/2 = 14. But wait, is that correct?Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s verify this. If S is the number of ordered pairs where A₁ = A₂ and A₁ ∪ A₂ = A, then A₁ must equal A₂ and A₁ must be A. Therefore, there is only one such pair: (A, A). Therefore, S = 1. So the total number of unordered pairs is (27 + 1)/2 = 14. But wait, let&#39;s check this with an example. Let&#39;s take a smaller set, say A = {1}. Then the number of ordered pairs would be 3^1 = 3. The unordered pairs would be [ {1}, {1} ], [ {1}, A ], and [ A, {1} ] but since unordered, the last two are the same. Wait, no. Wait, for A = {1}, the possible subset pairs (A₁, A₂) where A₁ ∪ A₂ = A.Possible subsets of A are {}, {1}. But since A₁ and A₂ must satisfy A₁ ∪ A₂ = {1}, so neither A₁ nor A₂ can be empty. Because the union must be {1}. So possible subsets for A₁ and A₂ are {1} only. Wait, no. Wait, subsets can be {} or {1}, but if A₁ or A₂ is empty, then their union would be the other subset. So to have the union be {1}, at least one of A₁ or A₂ must be {1}. So possible ordered pairs are ({1}, {1}), ({1}, {}), ({}, {1}). But {} is not allowed because if A₁ is {} and A₂ is {1}, then their union is {1}, which is okay. Wait, but the problem says &quot;subset partitions&quot;, but didn&#39;t specify that the subsets have to be non-empty. Wait, the problem statement just says &quot;subset partitions&quot; where the union is A. So empty subsets are allowed as long as their union is A. Wait, but if one of the subsets is empty, the other must be A. So for A = {1}, the possible ordered pairs are:1. ({1}, {1})2. ({1}, {})3. ({}, {1})4. ({}, {}) but this union is {}, which is not A. So only the first three. Wait, but the union must be A. So the pair ({}, {}) is invalid. So for A = {1}, there are 3 ordered pairs: ({1}, {1}), ({1}, {}), ({}, {1}). So the number of ordered pairs is 3, but the number of unordered pairs would be 2: [{1}, {1}] and [{1}, {}], because ({}, {1}) is the same as ({1}, {}). Then according to the formula, S would be 1 (the pair where A₁ = A₂ = {1}), so the number of unordered pairs is (3 + 1)/2 = 2, which matches. So in this case, the formula works.Similarly, for A = {1, 2}. Let&#39;s compute manually. The number of ordered pairs where A₁ ∪ A₂ = A. Each element can be in A₁, A₂, or both. So for each element, 3 choices, so 3^2 = 9 ordered pairs. Then S, the number of pairs where A₁ = A₂. If A₁ = A₂, then A₁ ∪ A₂ = A₁, so A₁ must be A. So S = 1. Therefore, the number of unordered pairs would be (9 + 1)/2 = 5. Let&#39;s verify:Possible unordered pairs:1. [A, A]2. [A, {1}]3. [A, {2}]4. [A, {1,2}]Wait, but maybe not. Wait, actually, subsets can be any combination as long as their union is A. Let me list all possible ordered pairs and then group them into unordered pairs.Ordered pairs where union is A:1. ({1,2}, {1,2})2. ({1,2}, {1})3. ({1,2}, {2})4. ({1,2}, {})5. ({1}, {1,2})6. ({1}, {2})7. ({1}, {1,2})Wait, no, this is getting confusing. Let&#39;s be systematic.Each element must be in at least one of A₁ or A₂. For each element, the possibilities are:- Only in A₁- Only in A₂- In both A₁ and A₂So for two elements, each with three choices, that&#39;s 3^2 = 9 ordered pairs. Let&#39;s list them:1. A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {1,2} (both elements in both)2. A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {1} (element 1 in both, element 2 only in A₁)3. A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {2} (element 2 in both, element 1 only in A₁)4. A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {} (elements 1 and 2 only in A₁)5. A₁ = {1}, A₂ = {1,2} (same as 2 but swapped)6. A₁ = {1}, A₂ = {2} (element 1 in A₁, element 2 in A₂)7. A₁ = {1}, A₂ = {1,2} (same as 2 again? Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, let&#39;s make this clearer.Wait, perhaps using a different approach. For each element, decide which subsets it is in. For element 1:- Only in A₁- Only in A₂- In bothSame for element 2. So for each element, 3 choices, independent, so 3^2 = 9.So the ordered pairs (A₁, A₂) can be generated by these choices. Let&#39;s list all 9:1. Both elements in both subsets: A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {1,2}2. Element 1 in both, element 2 only in A₁: A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {1}3. Element 1 in both, element 2 only in A₂: A₁ = {1}, A₂ = {1,2}4. Element 2 in both, element 1 only in A₁: A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {2}5. Element 2 in both, element 1 only in A₂: A₁ = {2}, A₂ = {1,2}6. Element 1 only in A₁, element 2 only in A₁: A₁ = {1,2}, A₂ = {}7. Element 1 only in A₁, element 2 only in A₂: A₁ = {1}, A₂ = {2}8. Element 1 only in A₂, element 2 only in A₁: A₁ = {2}, A₂ = {1}9. Element 1 only in A₂, element 2 only in A₂: A₁ = {}, A₂ = {1,2}Wait, okay, that&#39;s 9 ordered pairs. Now grouping them into unordered pairs:1. [{1,2}, {1,2}]2. [{1,2}, {1}] and [{1}, {1,2}] which are the same3. [{1,2}, {2}] and [{2}, {1,2}] which are the same4. [{1,2}, {}] and [{}, {1,2}] which are the same5. [{1}, {2}] and [{2}, {1}] which are the same6. [{1}, {1}] but wait, in our list above, is there a case where A₁ = A₂ other than the first one? Wait, no. The first one is the only case where A₁ = A₂ = {1,2}. The others have different subsets. So S = 1 here. Then according to the formula, the number of unordered pairs is (9 + 1)/2 = 5. Let&#39;s see:- [{1,2}, {1,2}]- [{1,2}, {1}]- [{1,2}, {2}]- [{1,2}, {}]- [{1}, {2}]Yes, that&#39;s 5. Which matches. So the formula works here. So for A = {1,2}, the answer would be 5. If I manually count, these are the 5 unordered pairs.Therefore, applying the same logic to A = {1,2,3}, the total ordered pairs would be 3^3 = 27. The number of symmetric pairs S is 1, since the only pair where A₁ = A₂ is when both are A. Therefore, the number of unordered pairs would be (27 + 1)/2 = 14. So the answer is 14. But wait, let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything.Alternatively, since each element can be in A₁ only, A₂ only, or both, and the pair [A₁, A₂] is unordered, we can model each pair as a function from A to the set {A₁, A₂, both}, but since the pair is unordered, the labels A₁ and A₂ don&#39;t matter. So essentially, for each element, we can assign it to one of three possibilities: in the first subset only, in the second subset only, or in both. However, since the pair is unordered, swapping the roles of the first and second subsets doesn&#39;t create a new pair.This is similar to counting the number of distinct colorings of the set A with three colors where swapping two colors (A₁ and A₂) doesn&#39;t count as a new coloring. The colors are &quot;only A₁&quot;, &quot;only A₂&quot;, &quot;both&quot;. So the count would be the number of orbits under the action of swapping A₁ and A₂. Using Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of unordered pairs is equal to (number of colorings fixed by swapping + total colorings)/2. The total colorings are 3^3 = 27. The number of colorings fixed by swapping A₁ and A₂ would be those colorings where swapping A₁ and A₂ labels results in the same coloring. That happens when for each element, if it was assigned to &quot;only A₁&quot;, it must be swapped to &quot;only A₂&quot;, but to remain the same coloring, the number of elements assigned to &quot;only A₁&quot; must equal the number assigned to &quot;only A₂&quot;. However, since the assignments are per element, the only way the entire coloring is fixed under swapping is if for each element, it is either in both subsets or in neither. Wait, but &quot;neither&quot; is not allowed because the union must be A. Wait, actually, the color assignments are &quot;only A₁&quot;, &quot;only A₂&quot;, &quot;both&quot;. If we swap A₁ and A₂, then &quot;only A₁&quot; becomes &quot;only A₂&quot; and vice versa, while &quot;both&quot; remains &quot;both&quot;. Therefore, a coloring is fixed under swapping only if for every element, it is either in both subsets or it is assigned symmetrically to both subsets. But since assignments are per element, the only way the coloring is fixed is if for every element, it is either in both or in neither. But &quot;neither&quot; is impossible because the union must cover all elements. Therefore, the only fixed colorings are those where every element is in both subsets. Which corresponds to the pair [A, A]. Therefore, there is only 1 fixed coloring. Therefore, by Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of unordered pairs is (27 + 1)/2 = 14. Which confirms the previous result.Therefore, the answer should be 14. But let me try to list them for A = {1,2,3} to see if that makes sense.First, list all possible unordered pairs [A₁, A₂] where A₁ ∪ A₂ = A. The possible cases can be categorized based on the sizes of A₁ and A₂. Since order doesn&#39;t matter, we can assume |A₁| ≤ |A₂|.But maybe a better way is to think about the different ways the elements can be distributed:1. All three elements are in both subsets: [A, A]2. Two elements in both subsets, one element only in A₁ or A₂3. One element in both subsets, two elements only in A₁ or A₂4. All three elements only in A₁ or A₂, with some distribution.But this seems complicated. Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the possible pairs:First, the pair where both subsets are the entire set: [A, A].Then, pairs where one subset is the entire set and the other is a smaller subset. For example, [A, {1}], [A, {2}], [A, {3}], [A, {1,2}], [A, {1,3}], [A, {2,3}], [A, {}]. But since [A, B] is the same as [B, A], and since A ∪ B = A, which implies B can be any subset, but A is fixed. Wait, but actually, if we have [A, B], then since A ∪ B = A, B must be a subset of A, which it is. So all pairs where one of the subsets is A. Since the other subset can be any subset of A. But since order doesn&#39;t matter, these pairs are [A, B] where B is any subset of A. The number of subsets of A is 8, so there are 8 such pairs. But [A, A] is one of them, so excluding that, there are 7 pairs where one is A and the other is a proper subset. However, in our count, we need to include all pairs where the union is A, not necessarily requiring one of them to be A. Wait, actually, if we take any two subsets whose union is A, they could both be proper subsets. For example, [{1,2}, {2,3}] is a pair where neither is A, but their union is A.So perhaps we need a different approach. Let&#39;s enumerate all possible pairs.Start with the pair [A, A]. Then pairs where one subset is A and the other is a subset. Then pairs where both subsets are proper subsets.First, pairs where one subset is A:- [A, A]- [A, {}]- [A, {1}]- [A, {2}]- [A, {3}]- [A, {1,2}]- [A, {1,3}]- [A, {2,3}]But since [A, B] is the same as [B, A], but since A is the entire set, these are unique. However, we need to check if any of these are duplicates. For example, [A, {}] is the same as [{}, A], but since we&#39;re considering unordered pairs, they are the same. So these are 8 pairs. However, in our formula, the total was 14, so the remaining 6 pairs must come from pairs where neither subset is A.So now, let&#39;s list the pairs where both subsets are proper subsets of A, but their union is A. For example:- [{1,2}, {1,3}]- [{1,2}, {2,3}]- [{1,3}, {2,3}]- [{1}, {2,3}]- [{2}, {1,3}]- [{3}, {1,2}]- [{1}, {2}, {3}] but no, we need pairs. Wait, no, the pair must be two subsets. So let&#39;s see:Wait, how many pairs of proper subsets have union A?Let&#39;s consider pairs where both subsets are of size 2. For example:- {1,2} and {1,3}: union is {1,2,3}- {1,2} and {2,3}: union is {1,2,3}- {1,3} and {2,3}: union is {1,2,3}These are three pairs.Then pairs where one subset is a singleton and the other is a pair that includes the other two elements:- {1} and {2,3}: union is A- {2} and {1,3}: union is A- {3} and {1,2}: union is AThese are three pairs.Then pairs where one subset is a singleton and the other is a pair that includes the singleton:Wait, for example, {1} and {1,2}: union is {1,2}, which is not A. So that doesn&#39;t work. Similarly, {1} and {1,3}: union is {1,3}, not A. So those don&#39;t work.Then pairs where both subsets are singletons:- {1} and {2}: union is {1,2}, not A- {1} and {3}: union is {1,3}, not A- {2} and {3}: union is {2,3}, not ASo those don&#39;t work.Pairs where one subset is a singleton and the other is a three-element set, but we already considered when the three-element set is A, but A is not a proper subset.Then pairs where both subsets are of size 2, which we already considered.Any other pairs?What about a subset of size 2 and a subset of size 1, but their union is A. For example:- {1,2} and {3}: union is A- {1,3} and {2}: union is A- {2,3} and {1}: union is AWait, but these are the same as the pairs where one subset is a singleton and the other is a pair of the other two elements. So these are the same as the three pairs mentioned earlier: [{1}, {2,3}], etc.Additionally, pairs where both subsets are of size 2 overlapping: like {1,2} and {1,3}, which we already considered.So total pairs where both are proper subsets: 3 (both size 2) + 3 (one size 1, one size 2) = 6. Then pairs where one subset is A: 8 (including [A, A]). So total pairs would be 8 + 6 = 14. Which matches our formula.Therefore, the answer is 14. Let&#39;s verify the enumeration:Pairs with one subset being A:1. [A, A]2. [A, {}]3. [A, {1}]4. [A, {2}]5. [A, {3}]6. [A, {1,2}]7. [A, {1,3}]8. [A, {2,3}]Pairs with both subsets being proper subsets:9. [{1,2}, {1,3}]10. [{1,2}, {2,3}]11. [{1,3}, {2,3}]12. [{1}, {2,3}]13. [{2}, {1,3}]14. [{3}, {1,2}]Yep, that&#39;s 14 pairs. So that confirms the answer is 14.Final AnswerThe number of different pairs of subset partitions of ( A ) is boxed{14}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( A = {1, 2, 3} ), we need to find the number of different pairs of subset partitions ([A_1, A_2]) such that ( A_1 cup A_2 = A ) and ([A_1, A_2]) is considered the same as ([A_2, A_1]).1. Understanding Subset Partitions:   - A pair ([A_1, A_2]) is a subset partition if ( A_1 cup A_2 = A ).   - Order does not matter, so ([A_1, A_2]) and ([A_2, A_1]) are considered the same.2. Total Ordered Pairs:   - Each element in ( A ) can be in ( A_1 ), ( A_2 ), or both. For 3 elements, there are ( 3^3 = 27 ) ordered pairs.3. Symmetric Pairs:   - Symmetric pairs are those where ( A_1 = A_2 ). The only such pair is ([A, A]), so there is 1 symmetric pair.4. Applying Burnside&#39;s Lemma:   - The number of unordered pairs is calculated by considering the equivalence classes under the swapping relation. Using Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of unordered pairs is (frac{27 + 1}{2} = 14).5. Verification by Enumeration:   - Pairs where one subset is ( A ): 8 pairs (including ([A, A])).   - Pairs where both subsets are proper subsets: 6 pairs (3 pairs of size 2 subsets and 3 pairs of one singleton and one size 2 subset).Thus, the number of different pairs of subset partitions of ( A ) is (boxed{14}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out how many different pairs of subset partitions of set A = {1,2,3} there are. The problem says that a pair [A1, A2] is a subset partition if A1 union A2 equals A, and that [A1, A2] is the same as [A2, A1]. So, we need to count all such pairs where the order doesn&#39;t matter. First, let me make sure I understand what a subset partition is. It&#39;s two subsets whose union is A. But they don&#39;t necessarily have to be disjoint, right? Because it&#39;s just a union, not a partition in the usual sense where the subsets are disjoint. Wait, no, actually in standard terminology, a partition requires the subsets to be disjoint and their union to be the entire set. But here, the problem says &quot;subset partitions&quot; where A1 union A2 is A. Hmm, the problem might be using &quot;subset partition&quot; in a non-standard way. Let me check the exact wording again.It says: &quot;If sets A1 and A2 satisfy A1 ∪ A2 = A, then we denote [A1, A2] as a pair of subset partitions of A.&quot; So, according to this, a pair of subset partitions is just two subsets whose union is A. They don&#39;t have to be disjoint. So, A1 and A2 can overlap. So, for example, if A1 = A and A2 = A, then their union is A, so [A, A] is a valid pair. Similarly, if A1 is empty and A2 is A, then their union is A, so [∅, A] is also a valid pair. But the problem says that [A1, A2] and [A2, A1] are considered the same. So, order doesn&#39;t matter. Therefore, we have to count unordered pairs {A1, A2} where A1 ∪ A2 = A.Therefore, the task is: count the number of unordered pairs {A1, A2} (where A1 and A2 can be the same or different) such that their union is A. Then, since [A1, A2] is the same as [A2, A1], we need to avoid counting duplicates.First, let&#39;s note that the total number of ordered pairs (A1, A2) where A1 ∪ A2 = A is equal to 3^n, where n is the number of elements in A. Wait, for each element in A, it can be in A1 only, A2 only, or both. Since there are 3 elements, the total number of ordered pairs is 3^3 = 27. But this counts ordered pairs where order matters. However, the problem asks for unordered pairs, so we need to adjust for that.But maybe we can approach this directly. Let&#39;s list all possible unordered pairs {A1, A2} where A1 ∪ A2 = A. Since A has 3 elements, subsets can range from the empty set to the entire set. Let me list all possible subsets of A first. There are 2^3 = 8 subsets:∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}Now, we need to find all unordered pairs {A1, A2} such that A1 ∪ A2 = A. Let&#39;s think about how to count these.First, let&#39;s consider that for each pair {A1, A2}, their union must be A. So, A1 and A2 can be any subsets where together they cover all elements of A. Since order doesn&#39;t matter, we can assume without loss of generality that A1 is a subset of A2, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, we can categorize them based on the sizes of A1 and A2.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s easier to think in terms of ordered pairs first and then divide by 2 where necessary, but we have to be careful because some pairs might be symmetric (i.e., A1 = A2), so those would only count once. So, the total number of unordered pairs would be equal to (number of ordered pairs + number of symmetric pairs)/2. Wait, no. Let me recall that formula.In general, the number of unordered pairs is equal to C(n, 2) + n, where n is the number of elements. But in this case, n would be the number of ordered pairs where A1 ∪ A2 = A. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.Suppose S is the set of all ordered pairs (A1, A2) where A1 ∪ A2 = A. Then, the number of unordered pairs is (|S| + c)/2, where c is the number of unordered pairs where A1 = A2. Because for each unordered pair {A1, A2} where A1 ≠ A2, there are two ordered pairs (A1, A2) and (A2, A1). For the case where A1 = A2, there&#39;s only one ordered pair. Therefore, the total number of unordered pairs is (|S| + c)/2, where c is the number of ordered pairs where A1 = A2.But first, let&#39;s compute |S|, the number of ordered pairs. As I thought before, each element must be in A1, A2, or both. Since the union is A, each element must be in at least one of A1 or A2. Therefore, for each element, there are 3 choices: in A1 only, in A2 only, or in both. Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs is 3^3 = 27. So |S| = 27.Now, the number c is the number of ordered pairs where A1 = A2. That is, the number of subsets A1 such that A1 ∪ A1 = A. But A1 ∪ A1 is just A1, so this requires A1 = A. Therefore, the only ordered pair where A1 = A2 is (A, A). Therefore, c = 1.Therefore, the number of unordered pairs is (27 + 1)/2 = 28/2 = 14. So, 14 unordered pairs.Wait, but let&#39;s check if that&#39;s correct. Let&#39;s list them to confirm.First, when A1 = A2 = A. That&#39;s one pair: {A, A}.Then, pairs where A1 and A2 are different. Each of these would contribute two ordered pairs but one unordered pair. So, total number of unordered pairs where A1 ≠ A2 is (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Then, total unordered pairs is 13 + 1 = 14.But let&#39;s check with A = {1,2,3}.Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, but let&#39;s verify by enumerating.Let me try to list all possible unordered pairs {A1, A2} with A1 ∪ A2 = A.First, note that A1 and A2 must each be subsets of A, and their union is A. Let&#39;s consider different cases based on the size of A1.Case 1: A1 = A. Then, A2 can be any subset of A, because A ∪ A2 = A. But since the pair is unordered, {A, A2} is the same as {A2, A}. However, in this case, since A1 is fixed as A, the pairs would be {A, A2} where A2 is any subset. But since order doesn&#39;t matter, {A, A2} is the same as {A2, A}, but since A is fixed, how many unique pairs are there where one of the subsets is A?If A1 = A, then A2 can be any subset (since union with A is A). But since the pair is unordered, each such pair is {A, X} where X is a subset of A. However, the problem is that some of these pairs might be duplicates when X is different but combined with A. Wait, no, {A, X} is unique for each X. However, if we consider that {A, X} and {A, Y} are different if X ≠ Y. But we need to check if any of these pairs could be duplicates in another case.Wait, perhaps not. So, if A1 = A, then the pairs are {A, X} for all X. Similarly, if A2 = A, then the pairs are {X, A}, which are the same as {A, X}. So, the number of pairs where at least one subset is A is equal to the number of subsets X of A, which is 8. However, since {A, A} is one of them, the rest are {A, X} where X is a proper subset. However, we might have overlapping counts with other cases.Wait, perhaps this approach is not efficient. Let me try a different approach.Instead of listing all possible pairs, maybe categorize them based on the subsets.Note that for each pair {A1, A2}, their union is A. So, A1 and A2 must cover all elements of A. Let&#39;s think of each element in A. Each element can be in:- Only A1- Only A2- Both A1 and A2But since the pair is unordered, swapping A1 and A2 doesn&#39;t create a new pair. Therefore, the assignment of elements to &quot;only A1&quot;, &quot;only A2&quot;, or &quot;both&quot; should be considered up to swapping A1 and A2.Therefore, for each element, the possibilities are:1. In both A1 and A2.2. In only A1.3. In only A2.But since the pair is unordered, cases 2 and 3 are equivalent. Therefore, for each element, we can assign it to either both or one of the subsets, but considering that assigning to only A1 is the same as assigning to only A2 when considering unordered pairs.Therefore, the number of unordered pairs is equal to the number of ways to assign each element to either both subsets or one of the subsets, divided by 2 for the symmetry, but we have to account for assignments where all elements are assigned symmetrically.Wait, this seems complicated, but maybe we can model it as follows.Each element has two possibilities: either it is in both subsets or it is in exactly one. However, because the pair is unordered, the distinction between being in A1 only or A2 only is not relevant. Therefore, for each element, we can think of two cases:- The element is in both subsets.- The element is in exactly one subset, but since the pair is unordered, we don&#39;t care which one.However, this might not capture the entire picture. Let&#39;s think again.Suppose we have n elements. For each element, there are three possibilities in an ordered pair: in A1 only, in A2 only, or in both. Since the pair is unordered, the distinction between A1 only and A2 only disappears. So, for each element, the number of choices is two: either the element is in both subsets or it is in exactly one subset. Therefore, for each element, two choices, leading to 2^n unordered pairs. But wait, that would be 2^3 = 8 for n=3. But we know that the number of unordered pairs should be 14, which is more than 8. So this reasoning must be flawed.Alternatively, maybe this approach is incorrect because the assignments are not independent when considering unordered pairs. For example, even if each element is independently assigned to both or one, swapping A1 and A2 would affect multiple elements at once. Therefore, the orbits under the swapping action need to be considered.This is getting into group theory and Burnside&#39;s lemma. Let me recall that.Burnside&#39;s lemma states that the number of distinct configurations under a group action is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group elements. In this case, the group is of order 2: the identity and the swap of A1 and A2. So, applying Burnside&#39;s lemma:Number of unordered pairs = (number of ordered pairs fixed by identity + number of ordered pairs fixed by swapping) / 2.The number fixed by identity is all ordered pairs, which is 27. The number fixed by swapping is the number of ordered pairs where swapping A1 and A2 leaves the pair unchanged, i.e., A1 = A2. As we saw before, the only such pair is when A1 = A2 = A, so there&#39;s 1 such pair.Wait, but actually, if we consider ordered pairs fixed by swapping, that would be the number of ordered pairs (A1, A2) such that (A1, A2) = (A2, A1). Which implies A1 = A2. So, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of subsets A1 where A1 ∪ A1 = A, which as before, requires A1 = A. Therefore, only 1 pair: (A, A).Therefore, by Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of unordered pairs is (27 + 1)/2 = 14, which matches the earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 14.But let me verify this by enumerating all possible unordered pairs for A = {1,2,3}.First, list all subsets of A:1. ∅2. {1}3. {2}4. {3}5. {1,2}6. {1,3}7. {2,3}8. {1,2,3}Now, we need to find all unordered pairs {A1, A2} such that A1 ∪ A2 = A.Let&#39;s start by considering pairs where one of the subsets is A itself. As mentioned before, {A, X} where X is any subset. Since A ∪ X = A regardless of X, these are all valid. There are 8 such pairs:1. {A, ∅}2. {A, {1}}3. {A, {2}}4. {A, {3}}5. {A, {1,2}}6. {A, {1,3}}7. {A, {2,3}}8. {A, A}Now, that&#39;s 8 pairs. But according to our earlier calculation, there should be 14, so we need 6 more pairs where neither subset is A.So, next, let&#39;s consider pairs where neither A1 nor A2 is A. So, both A1 and A2 are proper subsets, but their union is A.Let&#39;s list these. Let&#39;s consider pairs of subsets whose union is A. For example, { {1,2}, {1,3} } because their union is {1,2,3}. But let&#39;s check:Wait, {1,2} ∪ {1,3} = {1,2,3}, yes. Similarly, {1}, {2,3} would also union to A. Let&#39;s see.First, let&#39;s consider all possible pairs of subsets where neither is A, and their union is A. Let&#39;s list them.First, pairs where one subset is a singleton and the other is a two-element set.For example:- { {1}, {2,3} } union is {1,2,3}- { {2}, {1,3} } union is {1,2,3}- { {3}, {1,2} } union is {1,2,3}Each of these is a valid pair.Then, pairs where both subsets are two-element sets. For example:- { {1,2}, {1,3} } union is {1,2,3}- { {1,2}, {2,3} } union is {1,2,3}- { {1,3}, {2,3} } union is {1,2,3}Additionally, pairs where one subset is a two-element set and the other is a one-element set not included in the two-element set. Wait, we already considered those above.Wait, { {1,2}, {3} } is the same as { {3}, {1,2} }, which we already listed.Also, pairs where both subsets are one-element sets. But the union of two singletons can&#39;t be A unless they are the same element, but since they are different subsets, their union would have two elements. So, for example, { {1}, {2} } union is {1,2}, which is not A. Similarly, { {1}, {1} } is just {1}, which is not A. So, such pairs don&#39;t contribute.Another case: pairs where one subset is a two-element set and the other is a two-element set overlapping with it, as we listed above.Additionally, pairs where one subset is a three-element set, but we already considered those with A.Wait, let&#39;s see. So far, we have:From the singleton and two-element set pairs:1. { {1}, {2,3} }2. { {2}, {1,3} }3. { {3}, {1,2} }From the two two-element sets:4. { {1,2}, {1,3} }5. { {1,2}, {2,3} }6. { {1,3}, {2,3} }Additionally, is there a pair where both subsets are single-element sets but different? No, as their union would have two elements. Similarly, pairs where one is a single-element set and the other is a different single-element set, but as above, their union is not A. Similarly, pairs where one is a single-element set and the other is a two-element set that doesn&#39;t include it. Wait, for example, { {1}, {2,3} } is already considered. What about { {1}, {1,2} }? Their union is {1,2}, which is not A. So that&#39;s invalid.Similarly, { {1}, {1,3} } union is {1,3}, not A. So, those are invalid. So only the pairs where the singleton is not in the two-element set would union to A. Wait, but in the case of { {1}, {2,3} }, 1 is not in {2,3}, so their union is A. Similarly, { {1}, {1,2} } union is {1,2}, which is missing 3. So only when the singleton is not in the two-element set does the union become A. Therefore, the three pairs listed above are the only ones where a singleton and a two-element set union to A.Then, the pairs of two two-element sets that union to A. Each pair of two-element sets that together cover all elements. For example, {1,2} and {1,3} cover 1,2,3. Similarly for the others. There are three such pairs.So, total of 3 + 3 = 6 pairs where neither subset is A. Adding to the 8 pairs where one subset is A, we get 14 pairs. That matches our earlier calculation.Let me list them all:Pairs where one subset is A (8 pairs):1. {∅, A}2. {{1}, A}3. {{2}, A}4. {{3}, A}5. {{1,2}, A}6. {{1,3}, A}7. {{2,3}, A}8. {A, A}Pairs where neither subset is A (6 pairs):9. {{1}, {2,3}}10. {{2}, {1,3}}11. {{3}, {1,2}}12. {{1,2}, {1,3}}13. {{1,2}, {2,3}}14. {{1,3}, {2,3}}Yes, that&#39;s 14 pairs in total. Therefore, the number of different pairs of subset partitions of A is 14.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there are any other pairs we missed.For example, could there be a pair where one subset is a three-element set and the other is a two-element set? But A is the only three-element set, so that&#39;s already included in the first 8 pairs.What about pairs where both subsets are three-element sets? But since the only three-element set is A, this is the same as {A, A}, which is already counted.What about pairs where one subset is a two-element set and the other is a one-element set that is included in the two-element set? For example, {{1}, {1,2}}. As before, their union is {1,2}, which is not A, so they are invalid.Similarly, pairs where one subset is a two-element set and the other is a different two-element set that overlaps partially. For example, {{1,2}, {2,3}} is already counted in pair 13.Wait, yes, that was already considered. So, all possible pairs are accounted for.Therefore, the answer should be 14.Final AnswerThe number of different pairs of subset partitions of (A) is boxed{14}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the set (A = {1, 2, 3}), we need to find the number of different pairs of subset partitions ([A_1, A_2]) such that (A_1 cup A_2 = A) and considering ([A_1, A_2]) and ([A_2, A_1]) as the same pair.1. Understanding the Problem:   - A pair ([A_1, A_2]) is a subset partition if (A_1 cup A_2 = A).   - Order does not matter, so ([A_1, A_2]) is the same as ([A_2, A_1]).2. Total Ordered Pairs:   - Each element in (A) can be in (A_1), (A_2), or both. This gives (3^3 = 27) ordered pairs.3. Unordered Pairs Calculation:   - Using Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of unordered pairs is (frac{text{number of ordered pairs} + text{number of symmetric pairs}}{2}).   - The number of symmetric pairs (where (A_1 = A_2)) is 1 (only when (A_1 = A_2 = A)).   - Thus, the number of unordered pairs is (frac{27 + 1}{2} = 14).4. Verification by Enumeration:   - Pairs where one subset is (A): 8 pairs (including ({A, A})).   - Pairs where neither subset is (A): 6 pairs (combinations of singletons and two-element sets, and pairs of two-element sets).Listing all pairs:- Pairs with one subset as (A): ({A, emptyset}), ({A, {1}}), ({A, {2}}), ({A, {3}}), ({A, {1, 2}}), ({A, {1, 3}}), ({A, {2, 3}}), ({A, A}).- Pairs with neither subset as (A): ({{1}, {2, 3}}), ({{2}, {1, 3}}), ({{3}, {1, 2}}), ({{1, 2}, {1, 3}}), ({{1, 2}, {2, 3}}), ({{1, 3}, {2, 3}}).Thus, the number of different pairs of subset partitions of (A) is (boxed{14}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-09220ead></div><p class="review-content" data-v-09220ead><span class="icon" data-v-09220ead>🔑:</span>12. 14.Divide into three categories.First category: When at least one of A_{1} and A_{2} is A (let&#39;s assume A_{1}=A), then A_{2} can be any subset of A, for a total of 8 different subset decompositions.Second category: A_{1} and A_{2} are one-element and two-element subsets, respectively, with the following three subset decompositions.(1) A_{1}={1}, A_{2}={2,3};(2) A_{1}={2}, A_{2}={1,3};(3) A_{1}={3}, A_{2}={1,2}.Third category: A_{1} and A_{2} are both two-element subsets, with the following three subset decompositions.(1) A_{1}={1,2}, A_{2}={1,3};(2) A_{1}={2,3}, A_{2}={2,1};(3) A_{1}={3,1}, A_{2}={3,2}.In summary, there are 8+3+3=14 different subset decompositions.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-ddf3a350><span data-v-ddf3a350>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
