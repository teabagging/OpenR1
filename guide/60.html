The options are A through D, with different coordinates. Hmm, let me recall what I know about parabolas and their foci.First, I remember that the standard form of a parabola that opens upwards or downwards is usually written as (x - h)² = 4p(y - k), where the vertex is at the point (h, k) and the focus is at (h, k + p). Conversely, if the parabola opens to the side, the equation would be (y - k)² = 4p(x - h), with the focus at (h + p, k). In the given equation, y = x², which can be rewritten as x² = y. Comparing this to the standard form (x - h)² = 4p(y - k), I can see that h = 0 and k = 0 because there are no shifts in the equation. So the vertex of this parabola is at the origin (0, 0). Now, the coefficient in front of the y term in the standard form is 4p, but in the given equation, the coefficient is 1. Therefore, 4p = 1. Solving for p gives p = 1/4. Since the parabola opens upwards (because the coefficient is positive), the focus is located p units above the vertex. The vertex is at (0, 0), so adding p to the y-coordinate gives the focus at (0, 0 + 1/4) = (0, 1/4). Looking at the options provided, option B is (0, 1/4). So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn&#39;t mix up the direction or the formula. Wait, another way to remember the focus of y = ax² is that the focus is at (0, 1/(4a)). In this case, a = 1, so it would be (0, 1/4), which matches what I found earlier. Okay, that seems consistent.I think I got this right. So the answer should be B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To find the coordinates of the focus of the parabola given by the equation ( y = x^2 ), we start by rewriting the equation in standard form. The given equation can be rewritten as ( x^2 = y ), which is comparable to the standard form of a parabola that opens upwards or downwards: ( (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k) ). Here, the vertex ((h, k)) is ((0, 0)) because there are no shifts in the equation.In the standard form, the coefficient of the ( y ) term is ( 4p ). For the given equation ( x^2 = y ), this coefficient is 1. Therefore, we have:[4p = 1 implies p = frac{1}{4}]Since the parabola opens upwards, the focus is located ( p ) units above the vertex. The vertex is at ((0, 0)), so adding ( p ) to the y-coordinate gives the focus at:[(0, 0 + frac{1}{4}) = (0, frac{1}{4})]Thus, the coordinates of the focus are (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here: &quot;The coordinates of the focus of the parabola (y = x^2) are ((quad)). The options are A: ((0, dfrac{1}{2})), B: ((0, dfrac{1}{4})), C: ((dfrac{1}{2},0)), and D: ((dfrac{1}{4},0)).&quot; Hmm, I need to find the focus of the parabola given by the equation (y = x^2). Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that parabolas can be expressed in different forms, and one of the standard forms is useful for identifying the focus and the directrix. The standard form for a parabola that opens upward or downward is usually written as ((x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)), where ((h, k + p)) is the focus and the directrix is the line (y = k - p). If I can rewrite the given equation (y = x^2) into this standard form, I can easily identify the value of (p) and thus find the coordinates of the focus.Let me start by rearranging the given equation. The equation is (y = x^2). If I move the (x^2) to the left side, I get (x^2 = y). Comparing this to the standard form ((x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)), I can see that (h = 0) and (k = 0) because there are no shifts in the equation. So the vertex of the parabola is at ((0, 0)), which makes sense since the graph of (y = x^2) is a parabola opening upwards with vertex at the origin.Now, in the standard form, the coefficient on the right side is (4p). In my equation, (x^2 = y), the coefficient on the right side is 1. Therefore, setting (4p = 1), I can solve for (p):(4p = 1)Divide both sides by 4:(p = dfrac{1}{4})In the standard form, the focus is located at ((h, k + p)). Since (h = 0) and (k = 0), substituting the values gives the focus at ((0, 0 + dfrac{1}{4})), which simplifies to ((0, dfrac{1}{4})).Looking at the answer choices, option B is ((0, dfrac{1}{4})), so that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me verify this another way to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Alternatively, I recall that for a parabola in the form (y = ax^2 + bx + c), the focus can be found using the formula ((dfrac{-b}{2a}, c + dfrac{1 - b^2}{4a})). However, in this case, since the equation is (y = x^2), which simplifies to (y = 1x^2 + 0x + 0), so (a = 1), (b = 0), and (c = 0). Plugging these into the formula, the x-coordinate of the focus is (-0/(2*1) = 0), and the y-coordinate is (0 + (1 - 0^2)/(4*1) = 1/4). So again, the focus is at ((0, 1/4)), which matches option B.Wait, so that seems consistent. Let me think if there&#39;s another method to confirm this. Maybe using the definition of a parabola? A parabola is the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point called the focus and a fixed line called the directrix. For the parabola (y = x^2), the vertex is at the origin, and it opens upward. The directrix should be a horizontal line below the vertex, and the focus is above the vertex.If the focus is at ((0, p)), then the directrix is the line (y = -p). Let&#39;s take a point on the parabola, say (1, 1). The distance from this point to the focus ((0, p)) should be equal to its distance to the directrix (y = -p). Let&#39;s compute both distances.Distance from (1, 1) to focus (0, p):Using the distance formula: sqrt[(1 - 0)^2 + (1 - p)^2] = sqrt[1 + (1 - p)^2]Distance from (1, 1) to directrix y = -p:Since the directrix is a horizontal line, the distance is the vertical distance between the point and the line. The y-coordinate of the point is 1, and the directrix is at y = -p, so the distance is |1 - (-p)| = |1 + p|Set these two distances equal:sqrt[1 + (1 - p)^2] = |1 + p|Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root and absolute value:1 + (1 - p)^2 = (1 + p)^2Expand both sides:Left side: 1 + (1 - 2p + p^2) = 1 + 1 - 2p + p^2 = 2 - 2p + p^2Right side: (1 + p)^2 = 1 + 2p + p^2Set them equal:2 - 2p + p^2 = 1 + 2p + p^2Subtract p^2 from both sides:2 - 2p = 1 + 2pSubtract 1 from both sides:1 - 2p = 2pAdd 2p to both sides:1 = 4pSo p = 1/4Therefore, the focus is at (0, p) = (0, 1/4), which again is option B. This method also confirms the same result. So even using the definition of the parabola, the focus is at (0, 1/4). Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is B.Just to ensure that I didn&#39;t overlook anything, let me check another point on the parabola. Let&#39;s take (0, 0), the vertex. The distance from the vertex to the focus (0, 1/4) is 1/4. The distance from the vertex to the directrix y = -1/4 is also 1/4. That checks out. So the vertex is equidistant from the focus and directrix, which is another property of parabolas. So that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, if I had to derive the formula from scratch, starting with the definition. Let&#39;s suppose the focus is (0, p) and the directrix is y = -p. Then, for any point (x, y) on the parabola, the distance to the focus equals the distance to the directrix. So:sqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - p)^2] = |y + p|Square both sides:x^2 + (y - p)^2 = (y + p)^2Expand both sides:x^2 + y^2 - 2py + p^2 = y^2 + 2py + p^2Subtract y^2 and p^2 from both sides:x^2 - 2py = 2pyBring terms involving y to one side:x^2 = 4pySo, solving for y:y = x^2/(4p)Comparing this with the given equation y = x^2, we have 1/(4p) = 1, so 4p = 1, which gives p = 1/4. Therefore, the focus is at (0, p) = (0, 1/4). So again, same result.Therefore, regardless of the method used—comparing to standard form, using the vertex form focus formula, applying the definition of the parabola with distances, or deriving the equation from scratch—the focus of the parabola y = x^2 is at (0, 1/4). Therefore, the correct answer is option B.I think that&#39;s thorough enough. All approaches lead to the same conclusion, so I can be confident that option B is the right choice.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To find the coordinates of the focus of the parabola (y = x^2), we start by rewriting the equation in the standard form of a parabola that opens upward or downward. The standard form is ((x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)), where ((h, k + p)) is the focus. Given (y = x^2), we can rewrite it as (x^2 = y). Comparing this to the standard form ((x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)), we identify (h = 0), (k = 0), and (4p = 1). Solving for (p), we get (p = dfrac{1}{4}).The focus of the parabola is at ((h, k + p)), which is ((0, 0 + dfrac{1}{4})) or ((0, dfrac{1}{4})).To verify, we use the definition of a parabola: the set of all points equidistant from the focus and the directrix. For a point ((x, y)) on the parabola, the distance to the focus ((0, dfrac{1}{4})) must equal the distance to the directrix (y = -dfrac{1}{4}). Using the distance formula and squaring both sides confirms that the focus is indeed ((0, dfrac{1}{4})).Thus, the coordinates of the focus are (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>AnalysisThis question examines the basic properties of a parabola.

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s restate the condition to make sure I understand it. For any integers m and n, f(m) + f(n) must be equal to whichever is larger between f(m + n) and f(m - n). So, for every pair m, n, the sum of their function values is the maximum of the function evaluated at their sum and their difference. That seems like a pretty strict condition. Maybe constant functions work? Let me check.Suppose f is a constant function, say f(k) = c for all integers k. Then, the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation would be c + c = 2c. The right-hand side (RHS) would be max(c, c) = c. So, 2c = c implies c = 0. So, the zero function might be a solution. Let&#39;s note that: f(k) = 0 for all k is a possible candidate.Wait, but maybe there are other functions. Let&#39;s think about linear functions. Suppose f(k) = ak + b, where a and b are integers. Let&#39;s see if such a function can satisfy the condition. Let&#39;s compute LHS: f(m) + f(n) = a(m) + b + a(n) + b = a(m + n) + 2b. RHS: max(f(m + n), f(m - n)) = max(a(m + n) + b, a(m - n) + b) = max(a(m + n), a(m - n)) + b. So, set LHS equal to RHS:a(m + n) + 2b = max(a(m + n), a(m - n)) + b.Simplify: a(m + n) + b = max(a(m + n), a(m - n)).Hmm. Let&#39;s rearrange:If a(m + n) ≥ a(m - n), then RHS is a(m + n), so equation becomes a(m + n) + b = a(m + n) ⇒ b = 0.If a(m - n) &gt; a(m + n), then RHS is a(m - n), so equation becomes a(m + n) + b = a(m - n) ⇒ a(m + n) - a(m - n) + b = 0 ⇒ a(2n) + b = 0.But this must hold for all integers m, n. Wait, if we fix a and b, can this hold?First, if b = 0, as per the first case, then we need that if a(m - n) &gt; a(m + n), then a(m + n) = a(m - n). But if a ≠ 0, then this would require that for some m, n, a(m - n) &gt; a(m + n) but also a(m + n) = a(m - n) which is a contradiction unless a = 0. Hence, if a ≠ 0, even with b = 0, the second case would require a(2n) = 0 for all n, which implies a = 0. Therefore, the only linear function possible is f(k) = 0 for all k. Which is the same as the constant function we considered earlier.So, maybe the only solution is the zero function. But before concluding that, let&#39;s test some other functions.What about absolute value function? But since the domain is integers, the absolute value function maps integers to non-negative integers. Let&#39;s check if f(k) = |k| satisfies the condition. Take m = 1, n = 1. Then LHS is |1| + |1| = 2. RHS is max(|2|, |0|) = max(2, 0) = 2. So, in this case, it works. Let&#39;s try m = 1, n = -1. Then LHS is |1| + | -1| = 2. RHS is max(|0|, |2|) = 2. Still works. How about m = 2, n = 1. LHS is 2 + 1 = 3. RHS is max(|3|, |1|) = 3. Okay. What if m = 2, n = 3. LHS is 2 + 3 = 5. RHS is max(5, |-1|) = 5. Hmm, still holds. Wait, maybe absolute value works? Wait, but let&#39;s test another case. Let m = 1, n = 2. LHS: 1 + 2 = 3. RHS: max(3, |-1|) = 3. Still okay. Wait, so is f(k) = |k| a solution? Let me check a different case where maybe the maximum is not just the sum. For example, m = 3, n = -1. LHS: 3 + 1 = 4. RHS: max(2, 4) = 4. Okay. What if m = -3, n = -3. LHS: 3 + 3 = 6. RHS: max(|-6|, |0|) = 6. Hmm, seems to work. Wait, but is f(k) = |k| really satisfying the condition for all integers m, n?Wait a second, let&#39;s test m = 0, n = 0. LHS: 0 + 0 = 0. RHS: max(0, 0) = 0. That&#39;s okay. How about m = 0, n = 5. LHS: 0 + 5 = 5. RHS: max(5, 5) = 5. Still works. Hmm. Wait, maybe f(k) = |k| is a solution? But the problem says &quot;functions mapping integers to integers&quot;, which absolute value does. But earlier when we tried linear functions, the only solution was zero function. Wait, but f(k) = |k| is not linear. So maybe non-linear functions can be solutions?But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a case where f(m) + f(n) is not equal to max(f(m + n), f(m - n)). Let&#39;s try m = 1, n = -2. Then LHS: |1| + | -2| = 1 + 2 = 3. RHS: max(|-1|, |3|) = max(1, 3) = 3. That works. How about m = 2, n = -3. LHS: 2 + 3 = 5. RHS: max(|-1|, |5|) = 5. Still works. Wait, maybe all cases work? Wait, is this possible? Let me check m = 1, n = 1. LHS: 2, RHS: 2. m = 1, n = 2. LHS: 3, RHS: 3. m = 1, n = -1. LHS: 2, RHS: 2. Wait, maybe f(k) = |k| does satisfy the condition? But according to the problem, the answer is supposed to be found, and maybe the zero function is another solution. Wait, but let&#39;s check m = 1, n = -1 for f(k) = |k|. Then f(1) + f(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. On the RHS, we have max(f(0), f(2)) = max(0, 2) = 2. So that works. But wait, if f(k) = |k|, then for m = n, f(m) + f(n) = 2|m|, and max(f(2m), f(0)) = max(2|m|, 0) = 2|m|. So that works. For m and n with opposite signs, say m positive and n negative, then m + n could be less than m - n (if n is negative, m - n = m + |n|). So f(m) + f(n) = |m| + |n|. On the RHS, max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Since m and n have opposite signs, |m + n| = | |m| - |n| |, and |m - n| = |m| + |n|. Therefore, the maximum of those two is |m| + |n|, which matches the LHS. If m and n are both positive or both negative, then m + n has the same sign, so |m + n| = |m| + |n| if they are same sign, and |m - n| = ||m| - |n||. Therefore, the maximum of |m + n| and |m - n| would be |m| + |n|, which again matches the LHS. Therefore, f(k) = |k| seems to satisfy the condition.Wait, so is the absolute value function a solution? Then why did the linear function approach only give the zero function? Because absolute value is not linear. So perhaps the zero function and the absolute value function are both solutions. Wait, but wait, let&#39;s check if there are more solutions. For example, maybe f(k) = c|k| where c is a constant. Let&#39;s test that.Suppose f(k) = c|k|. Then LHS is c|m| + c|n|. RHS is max(c|m + n|, c|m - n|). If c is positive, then max(c|m + n|, c|m - n|) = c * max(|m + n|, |m - n|). But the LHS is c(|m| + |n|). For equality, we need |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Wait, when is that true?Wait, take m and n both positive: |m| + |n| = m + n. max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = m + n. So equality holds. If one is positive and the other negative, say m positive, n negative: |m| + |n| = m + |n|. max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = max(|m - |n||, |m + |n||) = |m + |n|| = m + |n|, since m and |n| are non-negative. So equality holds. If both m and n are negative, similar to both positive. So yes, for any c ≥ 0, |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Wait, but if c is positive, then f(k) = c|k| would satisfy f(m) + f(n) = c(|m| + |n|) = c * max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = max(c|m + n|, c|m - n|). Therefore, f(k) = c|k| would satisfy the condition as long as c is a non-negative integer. Wait, but the problem states that the function maps integers to integers. So if c is a positive integer, then f(k) = c|k| maps integers to integers. For example, c = 1: f(k) = |k|. c = 2: f(k) = 2|k|, which also maps integers to integers. So perhaps there are infinitely many solutions of the form f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer. Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s test with c = 2. Take m = 1, n = 1. LHS: 2|1| + 2|1| = 4. RHS: max(2|2|, 2|0|) = max(4, 0) = 4. That works. How about m = 1, n = -1. LHS: 2 + 2 = 4. RHS: max(2|0|, 2|2|) = max(0, 4) = 4. Still works. If c = 0, then it&#39;s the zero function, which also works. So maybe all functions of the form f(k) = c|k| for non-negative integers c are solutions.But wait, could there be other functions that are not of this form? Let&#39;s think. For example, suppose f(k) = |k| for even k and f(k) = 0 for odd k. Let&#39;s test if this works. Take m = 2 (even) and n = 2 (even). Then LHS: |2| + |2| = 4. RHS: max(|4|, |0|) = 4. Since 4 is even, f(4) = 4. So that&#39;s okay. Now take m = 1 (odd) and n = 1 (odd). LHS: 0 + 0 = 0. RHS: max(f(2), f(0)) = max(2, 0) = 2. But 0 ≠ 2. So that doesn&#39;t work. So such a function wouldn&#39;t satisfy the condition. So maybe only functions linear in |k| work.Alternatively, maybe step functions? Suppose f(k) is a constant multiple of |k|. But maybe with some other modifications? Let&#39;s see. Suppose f(k) = c|k| + d. Let&#39;s test this. Then LHS: c|m| + d + c|n| + d = c(|m| + |n|) + 2d. RHS: max(c|m + n| + d, c|m - n| + d) = c max(|m + n|, |m - n|) + d. So set equal:c(|m| + |n|) + 2d = c max(|m + n|, |m - n|) + d.Thus,c(|m| + |n| - max(|m + n|, |m - n|)) + d = 0.But we know that |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|) as established earlier. Therefore, this simplifies to c*0 + d = 0 ⇒ d = 0. So f(k) = c|k|. So only functions of this form with d = 0 are possible. Hence, the general solution is f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer. Wait, but does c have to be a non-negative integer? The problem states that the function maps integers to integers, so if c is a positive integer, then c|k| is integer for all integer k. If c is a non-integer, say c = 1/2, then f(k) would not necessarily be integer. Therefore, c must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the solutions are all functions f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer.Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s check c = 0: the zero function. c = 1: absolute value. c = 2: twice absolute value. These all work. What if we take c negative? For example, c = -1. Then f(k) = -|k|. Let&#39;s test m = 1, n = 1. LHS: -1 -1 = -2. RHS: max(f(2), f(0)) = max(-2, 0) = 0. So -2 ≠ 0. Hence, negative c does not work. Therefore, c must be non-negative.Therefore, the general solution is all functions f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer. But wait, let&#39;s confirm with another example. Take c = 3. Then f(k) = 3|k|. Let&#39;s test m = 2, n = -3. LHS: 3*2 + 3*3 = 6 + 9 = 15. RHS: max(3|2 + (-3)|, 3|2 - (-3)|) = max(3*1, 3*5) = max(3, 15) = 15. So 15 = 15, which works. How about m = 0, n = 0: LHS = 0 + 0 = 0, RHS = max(0, 0) = 0. Good. m = 1, n = -1: LHS = 3 + 3 = 6, RHS = max(0, 6) = 6. Correct. So yes, functions of the form c|k| with non-negative integers c work. Are there any other functions?Suppose there is a function f that is not of the form c|k|. For example, suppose f(0) = something. Wait, let&#39;s think about f(0). Let&#39;s set m = 0, n = 0. Then f(0) + f(0) = max(f(0), f(0)) ⇒ 2f(0) = f(0) ⇒ f(0) = 0. So f(0) must be zero. That&#39;s a key point. So any solution must satisfy f(0) = 0. Also, let&#39;s set n = 0 in the original equation. Then f(m) + f(0) = max(f(m), f(m)) ⇒ f(m) + 0 = f(m) ⇒ which is always true. So no additional info there.What if we set n = m? Then the equation becomes f(m) + f(m) = max(f(2m), f(0)) ⇒ 2f(m) = max(f(2m), 0). Since f(0) = 0. So, 2f(m) = max(f(2m), 0). This gives us a relation between f(2m) and f(m). For example, if f(m) is non-negative, then f(2m) must be 2f(m). Similarly, if f(m) is negative, then max(f(2m), 0) must equal 2f(m). But 2f(m) would be negative, but the maximum of f(2m) and 0 is at least 0. Hence, if f(m) is negative, 2f(m) ≤ 0, so max(f(2m), 0) must equal 0. Therefore, if f(m) &lt; 0, then 2f(m) = 0 ⇒ f(m) = 0, which contradicts f(m) &lt; 0. Therefore, f(m) cannot be negative. Therefore, all functions f must be non-negative. Therefore, f(m) ≥ 0 for all integers m.So, this restricts f to non-negative functions. Therefore, f: ℤ → ℕ ∪ {0}. Also, from the earlier relation, 2f(m) = f(2m) since if f(m) is non-negative, then max(f(2m), 0) = f(2m). So, 2f(m) = f(2m) for all m. So f is a function where the value at 2m is twice the value at m. This is similar to the properties of linear functions, but over integers. However, over integers, such functions can have different behaviors. For example, if f(m) = c|m|, then f(2m) = c|2m| = 2c|m| = 2f(m), so that works. So the condition 2f(m) = f(2m) is satisfied by such functions.But are there any other functions that satisfy 2f(m) = f(2m) for all m, and the original equation? Let&#39;s suppose there is a function f such that f(2m) = 2f(m) for all m, and f is non-negative. Let&#39;s see if such a function must be linear in |m|.Suppose f(1) = c, then f(2) = 2c, f(4) = 4c, etc. Similarly, f(-1) = c, f(-2) = 2c, etc. But what about f(3)? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s try to use the original condition to relate f(3) to other values. Let’s take m = 2, n = 1. Then f(2) + f(1) = max(f(3), f(1)). Since f(2) = 2c, f(1) = c. So 2c + c = 3c = max(f(3), c). Therefore, 3c must equal max(f(3), c). Since f(3) is non-negative, if f(3) ≥ c, then max(f(3), c) = f(3), so 3c = f(3). If f(3) ≤ c, then max(f(3), c) = c, so 3c = c ⇒ 2c = 0 ⇒ c = 0. But if c = 0, then f is the zero function, which is already a solution. So either f(3) = 3c or c = 0. Therefore, if c ≠ 0, f(3) must equal 3c. Similarly, taking m = 3 and n = 1: f(3) + f(1) = max(f(4), f(2)) = max(4c, 2c) = 4c. So 3c + c = 4c, which holds. Similarly, m = 3, n = 2: f(3) + f(2) = 3c + 2c = 5c. RHS: max(f(5), f(1)) = max(f(5), c). So 5c = max(f(5), c). Again, since f(5) is non-negative, if f(5) ≥ c, then f(5) = 5c. If f(5) ≤ c, then 5c = c ⇒ 4c = 0 ⇒ c = 0. So again, unless c = 0, f(5) must be 5c. Continuing this pattern, it seems that for positive integers, f(k) = c|k|. Similarly, for negative integers, since f(-k) = f(k) by the following reasoning: take m = k, n = 0. Then f(k) + f(0) = max(f(k), f(k)) ⇒ f(k) = f(k). Doesn&#39;t help. But if we take m = k, n = -k. Then f(k) + f(-k) = max(f(0), f(2k)) = max(0, 2f(k)). Since f(k) is non-negative, 2f(k) ≥ 0, so max(0, 2f(k)) = 2f(k). Therefore, f(k) + f(-k) = 2f(k) ⇒ f(-k) = f(k). Therefore, the function is even: f(-k) = f(k). Therefore, f is entirely determined by its values on non-negative integers. For non-negative integers, we can see that f(k) must be linear in k. For if we assume f(1) = c, then f(2) = 2c, f(3) = 3c, etc., and f(0) = 0. So f(k) = ck for k ≥ 0, and f(k) = c|k| for all integers k. Since f must be even.But wait, does this hold for all integers? For example, if we have f(k) = c|k|, then yes, it&#39;s linear on positive and negative sides separately. But the key is that the function is linear with respect to |k|, which is not linear over all integers, but piecewise linear. But from the earlier analysis, the function must satisfy f(k) = c|k| for some non-negative integer c. Therefore, this seems to cover all possibilities. Since any deviation from this would break the condition 2f(m) = f(2m), or the original equation. For example, suppose f(1) = c, f(2) = 2c, f(3) = 3c, etc., but suppose f(4) ≠ 4c. Then, taking m = 2, n = 2: f(2) + f(2) = 4c, RHS: max(f(4), f(0)) = max(f(4), 0). Therefore, 4c = max(f(4), 0). Since f(4) must be non-negative, if f(4) ≠ 4c, then 4c = f(4) or 4c = 0. Hence, f(4) must be 4c or c = 0. So unless c = 0, f(4) = 4c. Therefore, f(k) = c|k| is enforced for all k by induction. For example, using m = k, n = 1, we can derive f(k + 1) in terms of f(k) and other terms.Wait, let&#39;s try to use induction. Suppose for all integers up to some n, f(k) = c|k|. Then, can we show f(n + 1) = c(n + 1)? Let&#39;s take m = n and n = 1. Then f(n) + f(1) = max(f(n + 1), f(n - 1)). If n is positive, then f(n) = cn, f(1) = c. So cn + c = max(f(n + 1), c(n - 1)). But since f(n + 1) must be ≥ c(n - 1) because max(f(n + 1), c(n - 1)) = cn + c. Since cn + c ≥ c(n - 1) (because c ≥ 0), the maximum is either f(n + 1) or c(n - 1). But cn + c ≥ c(n - 1) simplifies to c(n + 1) ≥ c(n - 1). If c &gt; 0, then n + 1 ≥ n - 1, which is always true. So the max is f(n + 1). Therefore, we have cn + c = f(n + 1). Therefore, f(n + 1) = c(n + 1). Thus, by induction, all positive integers satisfy f(n) = cn. Similarly, since the function is even, f(-n) = f(n) = cn = c|n|. Therefore, f(k) = c|k| for all integers k. Hence, the only solutions are functions of the form f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer.Therefore, the answer should be all functions f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer. Let me verify once more with an edge case. Let’s take c = 2, m = 1, n = -1. Then f(1) + f(-1) = 2 + 2 = 4. RHS: max(f(0), f(2)) = max(0, 4) = 4. Correct. If c = 0, then it&#39;s the zero function. Let’s take c = 3, m = -3, n = 2. Then f(-3) + f(2) = 9 + 6 = 15. RHS: max(f(-1), f(-5)) = max(3, 15) = 15. Correct. Another test: c = 1, m = 5, n = 3. LHS: 5 + 3 = 8. RHS: max(8, 2) = 8. Correct. All tests seem to check out.So, in conclusion, all functions satisfying the condition are scalar multiples of the absolute value function with non-negative integer coefficients. Therefore, the solutions are f(k) = c|k| for some non-negative integer c.Final AnswerThe functions satisfying the condition are precisely those of the form boxed{f(x) = c|x|} where ( c ) is a non-negative integer.&lt;/think&gt;To find all functions ( f ) mapping integers to integers such that for all integers ( m ) and ( n ), ( f(m) + f(n) = max(f(m+n), f(m-n)) ), we start by analyzing the given condition.1. Testing Constant Functions:   - If ( f ) is a constant function, say ( f(k) = c ), then ( 2c = c ) implies ( c = 0 ). Thus, the zero function ( f(k) = 0 ) is a solution.2. Testing Linear Functions:   - Suppose ( f(k) = ak + b ). This leads to contradictions unless ( a = 0 ) and ( b = 0 ), so the only linear solution is the zero function.3. Considering Absolute Value Function:   - Testing ( f(k) = |k| ) shows it satisfies the condition. For example, ( f(m) + f(n) = |m| + |n| ) and ( max(|m+n|, |m-n|) = |m| + |n| ).4. Generalizing to Scalar Multiples:   - Functions of the form ( f(k) = c|k| ) for non-negative integers ( c ) are tested. These satisfy ( f(m) + f(n) = c(|m| + |n|) ) and ( max(c|m+n|, c|m-n|) = c max(|m+n|, |m-n|) ), which holds since ( |m| + |n| = max(|m+n|, |m-n|) ).5. Verification and Induction:   - Using induction and properties of the function, it is shown that ( f(2m) = 2f(m) ) and ( f ) must be non-negative and even. This leads to the conclusion that ( f(k) = c|k| ) for some non-negative integer ( c ).6. Conclusion:   - All functions satisfying the condition are scalar multiples of the absolute value function with non-negative integer coefficients.Thus, the functions are precisely those of the form (boxed{f(x) = c|x|}) where ( c ) is a non-negative integer.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find all functions f from integers to integers such that for any integers m and n, the sum f(m) + f(n) equals the maximum of f(m+n) and f(m-n). Hmm, interesting. Let me start by trying to understand what the problem is asking. The function f takes an integer and returns an integer, and this condition has to hold for all integers m and n. That means whatever f is, when I add f(m) and f(n), it should be equal to whichever is larger between f(m+n) and f(m-n). First, maybe I can check some simple functions to see if they work. The most straightforward ones are constant functions. Let&#39;s suppose f is a constant function, say f(k) = c for all integers k, where c is some integer. Then f(m) + f(n) would be 2c. On the other hand, max(f(m+n), f(m-n)) would be max(c, c) = c. So 2c = c implies c = 0. So the zero function, f(k) = 0 for all k, is a solution. That&#39;s one possible function.Next, maybe linear functions? Let&#39;s suppose f(k) = ak + b. Let&#39;s test if such a function could satisfy the condition. Then f(m) + f(n) = a(m + n) + 2b. The right-hand side is max(f(m+n), f(m-n)) = max(a(m+n) + b, a(m - n) + b). So that would be max(a(m+n), a(m - n)) + b. Therefore, the equation becomes:a(m + n) + 2b = max(a(m+n), a(m - n)) + bSubtracting b from both sides:a(m + n) + b = max(a(m+n), a(m - n))So, depending on the sign of a, the max function would pick either a(m + n) or a(m - n). Let&#39;s consider different cases for a.Case 1: a = 0. Then the function is constant, which we already did. That gives b = 0, so f(k) = 0. Which works.Case 2: a &gt; 0. Then for the max function, we need to compare a(m + n) and a(m - n). Since a is positive, the max is a times the maximum of (m + n) and (m - n). Therefore:max(a(m + n), a(m - n)) = a * max(m + n, m - n)But according to the equation, this should equal a(m + n) + b. Therefore:a * max(m + n, m - n) = a(m + n) + bDividing both sides by a (since a ≠ 0):max(m + n, m - n) = m + n + b/aBut the left-hand side is either m + n or m - n, depending on which is larger. So, if m + n ≥ m - n, then max(m + n, m - n) = m + n, which would require m + n = m + n + b/a, leading to b/a = 0, so b = 0. But if m + n &lt; m - n, then max(m + n, m - n) = m - n, so substituting into the equation:m - n = m + n + b/aWhich simplifies to:-2n = b/aBut this has to hold for all integers m and n. However, n can be any integer, so unless a = 0, which we already considered, this equation can&#39;t hold for all n. Therefore, if a &gt; 0, even if b = 0, we run into a problem when m + n &lt; m - n. For example, take n positive. Then m + n &lt; m - n implies that n &lt; 0, which contradicts n being positive. Wait, hold on. Let me think again.Wait, the inequality m + n &lt; m - n simplifies to 2n &lt; 0, so n &lt; 0. So if n is negative, then m + n could be less than m - n (if n is negative, m - n is m + |n|). So in that case, the max would be m - n. Then according to the equation, we have:max(m + n, m - n) = m + n + b/aBut if n is negative, then max(m + n, m - n) = m - n. Then:m - n = m + n + b/aWhich gives:-2n = b/aBut this has to hold for any negative integer n. However, the left-hand side is -2n, which can be any positive even integer (since n is negative), but the right-hand side is a constant b/a. Unless b/a is a variable, which it isn&#39;t. Therefore, unless a = 0, which would make the function constant, this equation can&#39;t hold. Therefore, for a &gt; 0, we must have b = 0, but even then, when n is negative, the equation fails. Therefore, a &gt; 0 does not work.Case 3: a &lt; 0. Similarly, let&#39;s consider a negative a. Then the max(a(m + n), a(m - n)) would be a times the minimum of (m + n) and (m - n) because a is negative. So, max(a(m + n), a(m - n)) = a * min(m + n, m - n). Then the equation becomes:a(m + n) + b = a * min(m + n, m - n)Again, rearranging:a(m + n) + b = a * min(m + n, m - n)Subtract a(m + n):b = a (min(m + n, m - n) - (m + n))Let&#39;s analyze the term min(m + n, m - n) - (m + n). If m + n ≤ m - n, then min is m + n, so the term becomes (m + n) - (m + n) = 0. If m + n &gt; m - n, then min is m - n, so the term becomes (m - n) - (m + n) = -2n. Therefore, we have:b = a * [ 0 if m + n ≤ m - n else -2n ]But m + n ≤ m - n implies 2n ≤ 0, so n ≤ 0. Therefore, when n ≤ 0, the term is 0, so b = 0. When n &gt; 0, the term is -2n, so b = -2a n. However, b is supposed to be a constant, not depending on n. Therefore, unless a = 0, which would make the function constant, this can&#39;t hold. So again, only a = 0 works, leading to the constant function zero. Therefore, linear functions other than the zero function don&#39;t work.Hmm, so linear functions apart from the zero function are out. Let me try other simple functions. Maybe quadratic? For example, f(k) = k². Let&#39;s test this. Take m = n = 1. Then f(1) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. The right-hand side is max(f(2), f(0)) = max(4, 0) = 4. But 2 ≠ 4, so quadratic function doesn&#39;t work. How about absolute value? Let&#39;s try f(k) = |k|. Then f(m) + f(n) = |m| + |n|. The right-hand side is max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Let me check if |m| + |n| equals max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Let&#39;s take m = 1, n = 1. Left-hand side: 1 + 1 = 2. Right-hand side: max(2, 0) = 2. Okay, that works. Another example, m = 1, n = -1. Left-hand side: 1 + 1 = 2. Right-hand side: max(0, 2) = 2. That works. How about m = 2, n = 1. Left: 2 + 1 = 3. Right: max(3, 1) = 3. Hmm, works. m = 2, n = -1. Left: 2 + 1 = 3. Right: max(1, 3) = 3. Still works. What about m = 1, n = 2. Left: 1 + 2 = 3. Right: max(3, -1) = 3. Hmm. Wait, but if m = 3, n = -2. Left: 3 + 2 = 5. Right: max(1, 5) = 5. Still works. Wait a second, is |m| + |n| always equal to max(|m + n|, |m - n|)? Let me check.Wait, consider m = 1, n = 3. Left: 1 + 3 = 4. Right: max(4, 2) = 4. Still equal. What if m and n have different signs? Let&#39;s take m = 3, n = -2. Left: 3 + 2 = 5. Right: max(1, 5) = 5. Still equal. Wait, maybe this is a general property?Wait, actually, for any integers m and n, is |m| + |n| equal to max(|m + n|, |m - n|)? Let&#39;s check with m = 0, n = 0: 0 + 0 = 0, max(0, 0) = 0. m = 0, n = 5: 0 + 5 = 5, max(5, 5) = 5. Hmm. Wait, m = 1, n = 1: 2 vs 2. m = 1, n = -1: 2 vs 2. Wait, but let me try m = 2, n = 3. |2| + |3| = 5. max(|5|, |-1|) = 5. So that&#39;s equal. m = 2, n = -3. |2| + |3| = 5. max(|-1|, |5|) = 5. Still equal. Wait, is this a known identity? Hmm, let&#39;s see.Wait, let&#39;s suppose that |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Let me check whether this is always true. Let me take m and n both positive. Then |m| + |n| = m + n, and |m + n| = m + n, |m - n| = |m - n|. So max(m + n, |m - n|). Since m and n are positive, if m ≥ n, then |m - n| = m - n, so max(m + n, m - n) = m + n. Similarly, if n &gt; m, max(m + n, n - m) = m + n. So in either case, the max is m + n. So for m and n both positive, equality holds. Similarly, if both negative, |m| + |n| = (-m) + (-n) = -(m + n). Then |m + n| = |m + n|, which if they are both negative, m + n is negative, so |m + n| = -(m + n). |m - n| would be |m - n|. If m and n are both negative, say m = -a, n = -b, with a, b positive. Then |m + n| = | -a -b | = a + b, and |m - n| = | -a + b | = |b - a|. Then max(a + b, |b - a|). Since a + b is always greater than or equal to |b - a|, because a + b - |b - a| is equal to 2 min(a, b) ≥ 0. Therefore, the max is a + b, which is equal to |m| + |n|. So equality holds here as well.If m and n have different signs, let&#39;s say m positive, n negative. Let m = a, n = -b, with a, b positive. Then |m| + |n| = a + b. |m + n| = |a - b|, |m - n| = |a + b|. So max(|a - b|, a + b). Since a + b ≥ |a - b|, the max is a + b, so equality holds again. Similarly if m is negative and n positive.Therefore, in all cases, |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Therefore, if we take f(k) = |k|, then f(m) + f(n) = |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = max(f(m + n), f(m - n)). Therefore, f(k) = |k| is a solution.Wait, but the problem says &quot;functions mapping integers to integers&quot;. The absolute value function does map integers to integers, so that&#39;s okay. So f(k) = |k| is another solution. So now we have at least two solutions: the zero function and the absolute value function. Wait, but maybe there are more? Let me see.Wait, let me check if constant multiples of |k| work. Suppose f(k) = c|k|, where c is an integer constant. Then f(m) + f(n) = c|m| + c|n| = c(|m| + |n|). On the other hand, max(f(m + n), f(m - n)) = max(c|m + n|, c|m - n|). If c is positive, then this is c * max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = c(|m| + |n|), which equals f(m) + f(n). Wait, but from the previous identity, |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|). Therefore, if c is positive, then f(m) + f(n) = c(|m| + |n|) and max(f(m + n), f(m - n)) = c max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = c(|m| + |n|). Therefore, equality holds. So if f(k) = c|k| for any non-negative integer c, then this should work. Wait, but c is an integer, but since f maps integers to integers, c can be any integer. Wait, but if c is negative, let&#39;s test.Suppose c is negative. Let&#39;s take f(k) = -|k|. Then f(m) + f(n) = -|m| - |n|. The right-hand side is max(-|m + n|, -|m - n|). Since both -|m + n| and -|m - n| are less than or equal to zero, their maximum is the one closer to zero, i.e., the negative number with the smaller magnitude. For example, take m = 1, n = 1. Then f(1) + f(1) = -1 -1 = -2. The right-hand side is max(-2, -0) = 0. But -2 ≠ 0, so that doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, if c is negative, it&#39;s not a solution. Therefore, only non-negative constants c. But wait, the problem states that the function maps integers to integers, so c must be an integer. Therefore, possible solutions are f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer. Let&#39;s verify this.Take c = 2. Then f(k) = 2|k|. Then f(m) + f(n) = 2|m| + 2|n| = 2(|m| + |n|). The max(f(m + n), f(m - n)) = max(2|m + n|, 2|m - n|) = 2 max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = 2(|m| + |n|). Therefore, equality holds. Similarly, for any non-negative integer c, it works. If c = 0, that&#39;s the zero function. If c is positive integer, then f(k) = c|k| is a solution. Therefore, these are all solutions? Wait, but maybe there are other functions besides these linear functions scaled by constants?Wait, suppose we have f(k) = c|k| + d. Let&#39;s test if this works. Then f(m) + f(n) = c|m| + d + c|n| + d = c(|m| + |n|) + 2d. The right-hand side is max(c|m + n| + d, c|m - n| + d) = c max(|m + n|, |m - n|) + d. From the previous identity, max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = |m| + |n|. Therefore, the right-hand side becomes c(|m| + |n|) + d. Comparing to the left-hand side, which is c(|m| + |n|) + 2d. Therefore, we need 2d = d, so d = 0. Therefore, adding a constant d ≠ 0 breaks the equality, so only functions of the form f(k) = c|k| with c non-negative integer are possible.Wait, but can there be other functions that are not of this form? For example, piecewise functions. Suppose f(k) is defined as |k| for even k and 0 for odd k. Let&#39;s test if this works. Take m = 1 (odd), n = 1 (odd). Then f(1) + f(1) = 0 + 0 = 0. The right-hand side is max(f(2), f(0)). Since 2 is even, f(2) = 2, and f(0) = 0. So max(2, 0) = 2. But 0 ≠ 2, so this function doesn&#39;t work. How about another piecewise function. Suppose f(k) = |k| when k ≠ 0 and f(0) = something else. Let&#39;s see. Let f(0) = c. Then for m = 0, n = 0: f(0) + f(0) = 2c. The right-hand side is max(f(0), f(0)) = c. So 2c = c implies c = 0. Therefore, f(0) must be 0. So any deviation at zero is not allowed. Therefore, if the function is |k| except at some points, it might not work.Alternatively, perhaps functions that are linear combinations or have different slopes for positive and negative numbers. Wait, suppose f(k) = a k for k ≥ 0 and f(k) = b k for k &lt; 0, where a and b are non-negative integers. Let me check. Let&#39;s first check the case a = b, which reduces to f(k) = a|k|, which we already know works. If a ≠ b, let&#39;s see. Take m = 1, n = -1. Then f(1) + f(-1) = a(1) + b(-1) = a - b. The right-hand side is max(f(0), f(2)) = max(0, 2a). Since a and b are non-negative integers. So the equation becomes a - b = max(0, 2a). If a &gt; 0, then max(0, 2a) = 2a. So a - b = 2a implies -b = a, which would require a and b to be negative, but they are non-negative. Therefore, this is impossible unless a = 0. If a = 0, then f(k) = 0 for k ≥ 0 and f(k) = b(-k) for k &lt; 0, so f(k) = b|k|. Which is similar to the previous case. But if a = 0, then f(1) + f(-1) = 0 + b(1) = b. The right-hand side is max(f(0), f(2)) = max(0, 0) = 0. Therefore, b = 0. Therefore, only the zero function. Hence, such piecewise linear functions with different slopes don&#39;t work unless a = b, leading back to the absolute value scaled by a constant.Alternatively, maybe functions that are zero for some inputs and absolute value for others? For example, f(k) = |k| if k is even, and 0 if k is odd. Let&#39;s test this. Take m = 2 (even), n = 2 (even). Then f(2) + f(2) = 2 + 2 = 4. The right-hand side is max(f(4), f(0)) = max(4, 0) = 4. That works. Now take m = 1 (odd), n = 1 (odd). Then f(1) + f(1) = 0 + 0 = 0. The right-hand side is max(f(2), f(0)) = max(2, 0) = 2. 0 ≠ 2, so that doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, this function is invalid. So such piecewise functions may not work unless the pieces align in a way that preserves the additive property. It seems difficult to construct such functions.Another idea: maybe all solutions are of the form f(k) = c|k| for non-negative integers c. So far, we have the zero function and scaled absolute values. Let me check if there are any other functions. Suppose we have a function f that is additive, but with a maximum. Wait, but the condition is f(m) + f(n) = max(f(m + n), f(m - n)). So, for example, if I fix m and vary n, or fix n and vary m.Let me consider specific values. Let me set m = n. Then f(m) + f(m) = max(f(2m), f(0)). Since f maps to integers, f(0) must be an integer. Let me analyze f(0). If I set m = 0 and n = 0, the equation becomes f(0) + f(0) = max(f(0), f(0)), so 2f(0) = f(0), which implies f(0) = 0. So f(0) must be zero. That&#39;s a useful piece of information.Now, set n = 0 in the original equation. Then f(m) + f(0) = max(f(m), f(m)). Which simplifies to f(m) + 0 = f(m), which is always true. So that doesn&#39;t give new information.Next, set n = m. Then f(m) + f(m) = max(f(2m), 0). Since f(0) = 0. So 2f(m) = max(f(2m), 0). So f(2m) must be less than or equal to 2f(m), and if f(2m) is positive, then 2f(m) = f(2m). If f(2m) is non-positive, then 2f(m) must be less than or equal to 0, so f(m) ≤ 0. But since 2f(m) is the maximum of f(2m) and 0, which is at least 0, so 2f(m) ≥ 0. Therefore, 2f(m) is equal to max(f(2m), 0) and must be non-negative. Therefore, 2f(m) ≥ 0 ⇒ f(m) ≥ 0 for all m. Wait, so all functions f must be non-negative. Because if for some m, f(m) were negative, then 2f(m) would be negative, but max(f(2m), 0) is non-negative, so 2f(m) = max(f(2m), 0) ≥ 0 ⇒ f(m) ≥ 0. Therefore, f is non-negative everywhere.That&#39;s an important observation. So f(k) ≥ 0 for all integers k. Also, from the case when n = m, we have 2f(m) = max(f(2m), 0). But since f(2m) is non-negative, this simplifies to 2f(m) = f(2m). So f(2m) = 2f(m). Therefore, for any integer m, f(2m) is twice f(m). Interesting. That&#39;s a sort of homogeneity property.Similarly, perhaps we can find more properties. Let me set n = k and m = k. Then f(k) + f(k) = max(f(2k), 0) ⇒ 2f(k) = f(2k). As established. So f is linear on even numbers in some sense. Also, if I set n = 1 and m = 1: f(1) + f(1) = max(f(2), f(0)) ⇒ 2f(1) = f(2). But since f(2) = 2f(1), this is consistent. Similarly, n = 1, m = 2: f(2) + f(1) = max(f(3), f(1)). Since f(2) = 2f(1), this becomes 3f(1) = max(f(3), f(1)). Since f(3) ≥ 0, the maximum is either f(3) or f(1). If f(3) ≥ f(1), then 3f(1) = f(3). If f(1) ≥ f(3), then 3f(1) = f(1) ⇒ 3f(1) = f(1) ⇒ 2f(1) = 0 ⇒ f(1) = 0. But if f(1) = 0, then f(2) = 2f(1) = 0, and so on. Let&#39;s explore both possibilities.Case 1: f(1) = 0. Then from the above, f(2) = 2f(1) = 0. Similarly, setting m = 2, n = 1: f(2) + f(1) = 0 + 0 = 0 = max(f(3), f(1)) = max(f(3), 0). Therefore, 0 = max(f(3), 0) ⇒ f(3) ≤ 0. But since f is non-negative, f(3) = 0. Similarly, by induction, maybe f(k) = 0 for all k. So this leads to the zero function.Case 2: f(3) = 3f(1). Then from the equation 3f(1) = f(3). So if f(3) = 3f(1), and f(1) is non-negative, let&#39;s proceed. Let&#39;s suppose f(1) = c, a non-negative integer. Then f(2) = 2c, f(3) = 3c, etc. Maybe f(k) = c|k| for all integers k? Let&#39;s test this.If f(k) = c|k|, then for any m, n, f(m) + f(n) = c|m| + c|n| = c(|m| + |n|). On the other hand, max(f(m + n), f(m - n)) = max(c|m + n|, c|m - n|) = c max(|m + n|, |m - n|) = c(|m| + |n|). Therefore, equality holds. Therefore, if we assume f(k) is linear with respect to |k| scaled by a constant, then the equality holds. But how do we know there aren&#39;t other functions?Wait, perhaps f(k) is non-linear but still satisfies the additive condition. Let&#39;s see. Suppose f(k) is arbitrary but satisfies f(m) + f(n) = max(f(m + n), f(m - n)) for all m, n. And we know f(k) is non-negative and f(0) = 0. Let me check if f(k) must be multiplicative or something. Wait, no. The key is that when you add f(m) and f(n), you get the maximum of f(m + n) and f(m - n). Since f is non-negative, and from the earlier identity |m| + |n| = max(|m + n|, |m - n|), if we suppose that f(k) is proportional to |k|, then the equation holds. But could there be a function that isn&#39;t proportional to |k| but still satisfies the condition?Suppose f(1) = c, f(-1) = c, f(2) = 2c, f(-2) = 2c, etc., but f(3) = something else. Wait, but from the case when m = 2, n = 1: f(2) + f(1) = 2c + c = 3c. The right-hand side is max(f(3), f(1)) = max(f(3), c). Therefore, 3c = max(f(3), c). This requires that f(3) = 3c. Similarly, m = 3, n = 1: f(3) + f(1) = 3c + c = 4c. The right-hand side is max(f(4), f(2)) = max(f(4), 2c). Therefore, 4c = max(f(4), 2c). So f(4) must be 4c. Continuing this way, by induction, f(k) = c|k| for all integers k. Because each time, when you take m = k and n = 1, you get f(k) + f(1) = max(f(k + 1), f(k - 1)). Assuming f(k) = c|k| and f(k - 1) = c|k - 1|, then:If k is positive, then f(k) = ck, f(k + 1) = c(k + 1), f(k - 1) = c(k - 1). Then max(f(k + 1), f(k - 1)) = c(k + 1). So ck + c = c(k + 1), which holds. If k is negative, similar. Therefore, by induction, starting from f(1) = c, f(0) = 0, we can build up f(k) = c|k| for all integers k. Hence, the only solutions are f(k) = c|k| for non-negative integers c. Therefore, the functions are all scalar multiples of the absolute value function with non-negative integer coefficients.Wait, but let me verify with another example. Suppose c = 2. Then f(k) = 2|k|. Let&#39;s take m = 3, n = 2. Then f(3) + f(2) = 6 + 4 = 10. The right-hand side is max(f(5), f(1)) = max(10, 2) = 10. It works. Another example, m = -3, n = 2. f(-3) + f(2) = 6 + 4 = 10. The right-hand side is max(f(-1), f(-5)) = max(2, 10) = 10. It works. If m = 1, n = -1: f(1) + f(-1) = 2 + 2 = 4. The right-hand side is max(f(0), f(2)) = max(0, 4) = 4. Good. So seems consistent.But wait, what if c is not an integer? The problem states that the function maps integers to integers. Therefore, c must be an integer. Moreover, since f(k) must be an integer for all integer k, and if c is a non-negative integer, then f(k) = c|k| will map integers to integers. If c were a non-integer, say c = 1/2, then f(k) would not necessarily be integer. Therefore, c must be a non-negative integer.Therefore, the solutions are all functions of the form f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer. But wait, let&#39;s confirm there are no other functions. Suppose someone defines f(k) = |k| for k ≠ 5 and f(5) = something else. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible. Suppose f(5) = 6 instead of 5. Then take m = 3, n = 2. Then f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5. The right-hand side is max(f(5), f(1)) = max(6, 1) = 6. But 5 ≠ 6, so this function doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, changing the value at any point breaks the condition. Therefore, the function must be exactly c|k| for some non-negative integer c. Hence, these are the only solutions.To recap, the key steps were:1. Test constant functions: only f(k) = 0 works.2. Test linear functions: only f(k) = 0 works.3. Test absolute value function: works, and more generally, scalar multiples with non-negative integer coefficients work.4. Show that any deviation from scalar multiples of absolute value function leads to contradictions.5. Use induction and specific cases to demonstrate that f(k) must be linear in |k|.Therefore, all solutions are functions f(k) = c|k| where c is a non-negative integer.Final AnswerThe functions satisfying the condition are all non-negative integer multiples of the absolute value function. Thus, the solutions are boxed{f(n) = c|n|} for some non-negative integer ( c ).&lt;/think&gt;To find all functions ( f ) mapping integers to integers such that for all integers ( m ) and ( n ), ( f(m) + f(n) = max(f(m+n), f(m-n)) ), we proceed as follows:1. Constant Function Check:   - If ( f ) is a constant function, ( f(k) = c ), then ( 2c = c ) implies ( c = 0 ). Thus, the zero function ( f(k) = 0 ) is a solution.2. Linear Function Check:   - Testing linear functions ( f(k) = ak + b ) leads to contradictions unless ( a = 0 ), which reduces to the zero function.3. Absolute Value Function Check:   - Testing ( f(k) = |k| ) shows it satisfies the condition. For any integers ( m ) and ( n ), ( |m| + |n| = max(|m+n|, |m-n|) ).4. Generalizing to Scaled Absolute Values:   - Considering functions ( f(k) = c|k| ) for non-negative integers ( c ), we verify that these satisfy the condition. For any ( m ) and ( n ), ( c|m| + c|n| = c max(|m+n|, |m-n|) ).5. Non-Negativity and Homogeneity:   - Proving ( f ) must be non-negative and satisfy ( f(2m) = 2f(m) ). By induction, this leads to ( f(k) = c|k| ) for some non-negative integer ( c ).6. Excluding Other Functions:   - Any deviation from ( f(k) = c|k| ) leads to contradictions, confirming no other functions satisfy the condition.Thus, the solutions are all functions of the form ( f(n) = c|n| ) where ( c ) is a non-negative integer.[boxed{f(n) = c|n|}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>1. Claim: The function ( f(x) = k|x| ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer satisfies the given functional equation. We will verify this claim and then show that it is the only solution.2. Verification:    - For ( f(x) = k|x| ), we need to check if ( f(m) + f(n) = max(f(m+n), f(m-n)) ) holds for all integers ( m ) and ( n ).   - Substituting ( f(x) = k|x| ) into the equation, we get:     [     k|m| + k|n| = max(k|m+n|, k|m-n|)     ]   - We need to consider different cases based on the signs of ( m ) and ( n ):     - If ( m ) and ( n ) have the same sign, then ( |m+n| = |m| + |n| ) and ( |m-n| = ||m| - |n|| ). Thus, ( max(k|m+n|, k|m-n|) = k|m| + k|n| ).     - If ( m ) and ( n ) have opposite signs, then ( |m+n| = ||m| - |n|| ) and ( |m-n| = |m| + |n| ). Thus, ( max(k|m+n|, k|m-n|) = k|m| + k|n| ).   - In both cases, the equation holds, so ( f(x) = k|x| ) satisfies the functional equation.3. Uniqueness: We now show that ( f(x) = k|x| ) is the only solution.   - Let ( P(m, n) ) denote the assertion ( f(m) + f(n) = max(f(m+n), f(m-n)) ).   - Step 1: Evaluate ( P(0, 0) ):     [     f(0) + f(0) = max(f(0), f(0)) implies 2f(0) = f(0) implies f(0) = 0     ]   - Step 2: Evaluate ( P(m, m) ) and ( P(m, -m) ):     [     P(m, m) implies f(m) + f(m) = max(f(2m), f(0)) implies 2f(m) = max(f(2m), 0)     ]     Since ( f(m) geq 0 ), we have ( 2f(m) = f(2m) ) and ( f(m) geq 0 ).     [     P(m, -m) implies f(m) + f(-m) = max(f(0), f(2m)) implies f(m) + f(-m) = f(2m)     ]     Since ( f(2m) = 2f(m) ), we get ( f(m) + f(-m) = 2f(m) implies f(-m) = f(m) ). Thus, ( f ) is an even function.4. Induction: We will prove by induction that ( f(x) = kx ) for all ( x geq 0 ).   - Base Case: Let ( f(1) = k ). Then ( f(2) = 2f(1) = 2k ).   - Inductive Step: Assume ( f(n) = kn ) and ( f(n-1) = k(n-1) ). We need to show ( f(n+1) = k(n+1) ).     [     P(n, 1) implies f(n) + f(1) = max(f(n+1), f(n-1)) implies kn + k = max(f(n+1), k(n-1))     ]     Since ( kn + k &gt; k(n-1) ), we must have ( f(n+1) = k(n+1) ).5. By induction, ( f(x) = kx ) for all ( x geq 0 ). Since ( f ) is even, ( f(x) = k|x| ) for all ( x ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = k|x| } ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-2507025c data-v-94f6092c><div class="review" data-v-94f6092c><div class="review-title" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>❓:</span>Given f(x) = |ax + 1| (a in mathbb{R}), the solution set of the inequality f(x) leq 3 is {x | -2 leq x leq 1}.

The problem states that the solution set of the inequality f(x) ≤ 3 is {x | -2 ≤ x ≤ 1}. The options given are A: 2, B: 4, C: -2, D: -1. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that when dealing with absolute value inequalities like |ax + 1| ≤ 3, the solution set is the range of x values that satisfy the inequality. The absolute value expression |ax + 1| represents the distance from ax + 1 to 0 on the number line, so saying it&#39;s less than or equal to 3 means that ax + 1 must be between -3 and 3. That translates to the compound inequality:-3 ≤ ax + 1 ≤ 3Now, to solve for x, I can subtract 1 from all parts of the inequality:-3 - 1 ≤ ax ≤ 3 - 1Which simplifies to:-4 ≤ ax ≤ 2Next, I need to divide by &#39;a&#39; to solve for x. But here&#39;s the catch: the direction of the inequality signs depends on the sign of &#39;a&#39;. If &#39;a&#39; is positive, the inequality signs stay the same when dividing. If &#39;a&#39; is negative, the inequality signs reverse. Since we don&#39;t know the value of &#39;a&#39; yet, this adds a bit of complexity. However, the solution set given is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1, which is a closed interval from -2 to 1. So I need to make sure that after dividing by &#39;a&#39;, the resulting inequalities give x between -2 and 1.Let me write down the two possibilities based on the sign of &#39;a&#39;:Case 1: a &gt; 0In this case, dividing by &#39;a&#39; doesn&#39;t change the inequality direction. So:-4/a ≤ x ≤ 2/aBut according to the problem, the solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. Therefore, we can set up equations:-4/a = -2 and 2/a = 1Solving the first equation: -4/a = -2 ⇒ Multiply both sides by a: -4 = -2a ⇒ Divide by -2: a = 2Solving the second equation: 2/a = 1 ⇒ Multiply both sides by a: 2 = a ⇒ So a = 2Both equations give a = 2, which is consistent. So if a is 2, then the solution set would be from -4/2 = -2 to 2/2 = 1, which matches the given interval. So a = 2 is a candidate. Let&#39;s check if this is one of the options. Option A is 2, so that&#39;s possible.Case 2: a &lt; 0If &#39;a&#39; is negative, then dividing by &#39;a&#39; would reverse the inequality signs. So starting from:-4 ≤ ax ≤ 2Dividing by &#39;a&#39; (negative) gives:-4/a ≥ x ≥ 2/aWhich can be rewritten as:2/a ≤ x ≤ -4/aBut the given solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So we have:2/a = -2 and -4/a = 1Solving the first equation: 2/a = -2 ⇒ Multiply both sides by a: 2 = -2a ⇒ Divide by -2: a = -1Solving the second equation: -4/a = 1 ⇒ Multiply both sides by a: -4 = a ⇒ So a = -4But here, we have a conflict. The first equation gives a = -1, the second gives a = -4. This inconsistency suggests that there&#39;s no solution in this case where &#39;a&#39; is negative. Therefore, the only valid solution is when a is positive, which gives a = 2.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check that. If a is negative, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me try again.If a is negative, then the original inequality after dividing by &#39;a&#39; (negative) reverses the inequalities:-4/a ≥ x ≥ 2/aWhich is equivalent to 2/a ≤ x ≤ -4/aGiven that the solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1, so:2/a = -2 and -4/a = 1First equation: 2/a = -2 ⇒ a = 2 / (-2) = -1Second equation: -4/a = 1 ⇒ a = -4 / 1 = -4So as before, conflicting results. So if a were -1, then 2/a = 2/(-1) = -2, which is correct. Then -4/a = -4/(-1) = 4, but the upper bound is supposed to be 1, so that&#39;s not matching. Therefore, if a = -1, the solution set would be -2 ≤ x ≤ 4, which is not the given interval. So a = -1 is invalid.Similarly, if a = -4, then 2/a = 2/(-4) = -0.5 and -4/a = -4/(-4) = 1, so the solution set would be -0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1, which doesn&#39;t include -2. So that&#39;s not correct either.Therefore, in the case where a is negative, there&#39;s no value that satisfies both endpoints. Hence, the only possible value is a = 2. So answer A: 2.But wait, hold on. The options include C: -2 and D: -1. Maybe I did something wrong here. Let me check with the options given.Wait, if a = -2, let&#39;s test that. If a = -2, then the original inequality is | -2x + 1 | ≤ 3.Solving this:-3 ≤ -2x + 1 ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ -2x ≤ 2Divide by -2, reversing inequalities:(-4)/(-2) ≥ x ≥ 2/(-2)Which simplifies to:2 ≥ x ≥ -1Or written as -1 ≤ x ≤ 2. But the given solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So that&#39;s not matching. Hence, a = -2 would result in the interval [-1, 2], which is different. So C: -2 is incorrect.If a = -1, then the inequality becomes | -x + 1 | ≤ 3Solving:-3 ≤ -x + 1 ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ -x ≤ 2Multiply by -1, reversing inequalities:4 ≥ x ≥ -2Which is -2 ≤ x ≤ 4. But the given solution is up to 1, so that&#39;s not matching. Therefore, D: -1 is incorrect.If a = 4, let&#39;s check:Original inequality: |4x + 1| ≤ 3Solving:-3 ≤ 4x + 1 ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ 4x ≤ 2Divide by 4: -1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5But the given interval is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So that doesn&#39;t match. Hence, B: 4 is incorrect.Therefore, the only possible correct answer is A: 2.Wait, but earlier when we checked a = 2, the solution was from -2 to 1, which matches exactly. So why is the system showing this? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first case?Wait, let&#39;s verify again with a = 2.f(x) = |2x + 1| ≤ 3Solving:-3 ≤ 2x + 1 ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ 2x ≤ 2Divide by 2: -2 ≤ x ≤ 1Yes, that&#39;s exactly the given interval. So a = 2 is correct. Therefore, answer A: 2.But wait, the options are A:2, B:4, C:-2, D:-1. So according to this, answer should be A.But let me check once more. Because the problem says the solution set is -2 ≤x ≤1. So when a is 2, solving gives that interval. So that&#39;s correct. Therefore, the answer is A:2.But wait, hold on. The system might have different options. Wait, the user listed the options as A:2, B:4, C:-2, D:-1. So A is 2. So seems correct.But wait, wait, the original problem says &quot;the solution set of the inequality f(x) ≤3 is {x | -2 ≤x ≤1}&quot;. So when a=2, the solution is indeed -2≤x≤1. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the answer should be A:2.Wait, but the options include C:-2. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem? Wait, let&#39;s check again.Wait, maybe there is a different approach. Let me think.Suppose the solution set is -2 ≤x ≤1. So the roots of the equation |ax +1| =3 must be x=-2 and x=1. Therefore, solving |ax +1|=3 gives:ax +1 =3 or ax +1=-3So ax=2 or ax=-4Therefore, x=2/a or x=-4/aNow, since the solution set is between -2 and1, then the roots must be at x=-2 and x=1. Therefore:Either:x=2/a=1 and x=-4/a=-2Or:x=2/a=-2 and x=-4/a=1Wait, that&#39;s a different approach. Let me elaborate.When we solve |ax +1|=3, the solutions are x = (3 -1)/a = 2/a and x= (-3 -1)/a = -4/a. These are the endpoints of the interval where |ax +1| ≤3.But according to the problem, the endpoints are x=-2 and x=1. So either:Case 1:2/a =1 and -4/a=-2Solving 2/a=1 gives a=2Then check -4/a= -4/2=-2, which matches the left endpoint. So this works.Case 2:2/a=-2 and -4/a=1Solving 2/a=-2 gives a= -1Then check -4/a= -4/(-1)=4, which does not equal 1. So this doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the only valid case is Case 1, where a=2. Therefore, the answer is A:2.Therefore, the correct answer is A:2. So why does the initial thought process even consider negative a? Because if the problem had different endpoints, maybe a negative a could work, but in this case, it&#39;s not necessary. Therefore, the answer is A:2.But wait, the options given by the user are A:2, B:4, C:-2, D:-1, so A is correct.But wait, I just noticed that the original problem statement in Chinese might have been translated, but the user provided the problem in English already. So, according to the calculations, the answer is 2, which is option A. Therefore, the correct choice is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given ( f(x) = |ax + 1| ) where ( a in mathbb{R} ), the solution set of the inequality ( f(x) leq 3 ) is ( {x | -2 leq x leq 1} ). We need to find the value of ( a ).First, we start with the inequality:[|ax + 1| leq 3]This translates to the compound inequality:[-3 leq ax + 1 leq 3]Subtracting 1 from all parts:[-4 leq ax leq 2]Next, we divide by ( a ). The direction of the inequality signs depends on the sign of ( a ).Case 1: ( a &gt; 0 )Dividing by ( a ) (positive, so inequality signs remain the same):[-frac{4}{a} leq x leq frac{2}{a}]Given the solution set ( -2 leq x leq 1 ), we equate:[-frac{4}{a} = -2 quad text{and} quad frac{2}{a} = 1]Solving these:[frac{4}{a} = 2 implies a = 2 quad text{and} quad frac{2}{a} = 1 implies a = 2]Both equations give ( a = 2 ), which is consistent.Case 2: ( a &lt; 0 )Dividing by ( a ) (negative, so inequality signs reverse):[frac{-4}{a} geq x geq frac{2}{a}]Rewriting this interval:[frac{2}{a} leq x leq frac{-4}{a}]Given the solution set ( -2 leq x leq 1 ), we equate:[frac{2}{a} = -2 quad text{and} quad frac{-4}{a} = 1]Solving these:[frac{2}{a} = -2 implies a = -1 quad text{and} quad frac{-4}{a} = 1 implies a = -4]These results are inconsistent, so no valid ( a ) exists in this case.Verifying the roots of ( |ax + 1| = 3 ):- Solving ( ax + 1 = 3 ) gives ( x = frac{2}{a} )- Solving ( ax + 1 = -3 ) gives ( x = frac{-4}{a} )Given the endpoints ( x = -2 ) and ( x = 1 ):- ( frac{2}{a} = 1 implies a = 2 )- ( frac{-4}{a} = -2 implies a = 2 )Both equations confirm ( a = 2 ).Thus, the value of ( a ) is (boxed{A}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of &#39;a&#39; such that the solution set of the inequality |ax + 1| ≤ 3 is the interval from -2 to 1. Hmm, let me think about how absolute value inequalities work. First, the inequality |ax + 1| ≤ 3 means that the expression inside the absolute value, which is ax + 1, must be between -3 and 3. So, I can rewrite the inequality as:-3 ≤ ax + 1 ≤ 3Now, to solve for x, I should subtract 1 from all parts of the inequality:-3 - 1 ≤ ax ≤ 3 - 1Which simplifies to:-4 ≤ ax ≤ 2Then, to isolate x, I need to divide all parts by &#39;a&#39;. But here&#39;s the thing: if &#39;a&#39; is positive, the direction of the inequalities doesn&#39;t change, but if &#39;a&#39; is negative, dividing by a negative number would reverse the inequality signs. Hmm, so I need to consider the sign of &#39;a&#39; here. The problem says &#39;a&#39; is a real number, so it could be positive or negative. Let&#39;s keep that in mind.But wait, the solution set given is from -2 to 1. So, the inequality in terms of x is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. That must come from dividing the inequality -4 ≤ ax ≤ 2 by &#39;a&#39;. Depending on the sign of &#39;a&#39;, the order of the inequalities might switch.Let me denote the original inequality after subtracting 1: -4 ≤ ax ≤ 2.Case 1: a &gt; 0If &#39;a&#39; is positive, dividing by &#39;a&#39; preserves the inequality direction:-4/a ≤ x ≤ 2/aBut according to the problem, the solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So, this would mean:-4/a = -2 and 2/a = 1Let me check these equations. Starting with the upper bound: 2/a = 1. Solving for &#39;a&#39; gives a = 2. Then checking the lower bound: -4/a = -4/2 = -2, which matches the given lower bound. So, if a is 2, which is positive, then this works. So, 2 is a possible answer (option A).Case 2: a &lt; 0If &#39;a&#39; is negative, dividing by &#39;a&#39; reverses the inequality signs. So, starting from -4 ≤ ax ≤ 2, dividing by a negative &#39;a&#39; gives:-4/a ≥ x ≥ 2/aWhich can be rewritten as:2/a ≤ x ≤ -4/aBut the solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So, comparing these:2/a = -2 and -4/a = 1Let me solve these equations. Starting with 2/a = -2:Multiply both sides by &#39;a&#39;: 2 = -2aThen, divide by -2: a = -1Check the other equation: -4/a = 1Substitute a = -1: -4/(-1) = 4 = 1? Wait, that&#39;s not true. 4 ≠ 1. So, this gives a contradiction. So, a cannot be -1.Wait, maybe I messed up the order? Let&#39;s double-check. If a is negative, the original inequality is -4 ≤ ax ≤ 2. Let&#39;s write it again:Since a is negative, let me denote a = -k where k &gt; 0. Then, substituting:-4 ≤ -k x ≤ 2Divide all parts by -k (which is negative), so inequalities reverse:(-4)/(-k) ≥ x ≥ 2/(-k)Which is 4/k ≥ x ≥ -2/kSo, written as -2/k ≤ x ≤ 4/kComparing this to the solution set -2 ≤ x ≤ 1:So, -2/k = -2 and 4/k = 1First equation: -2/k = -2 ⇒ 2/k = 2 ⇒ k = 1. Then, substitute into second equation: 4/k = 4/1 = 4 ≠ 1. Contradiction again.Alternatively, maybe I should set the endpoints equal. So, the solution set is x from -2 to 1. So, if we have in the case a &lt; 0, then:From the inequality after dividing by a negative number:Lower bound: 2/a = -2 ⇒ a = -1Upper bound: -4/a = 1 ⇒ a = -4But a cannot be both -1 and -4. So, this is inconsistent. Therefore, there&#39;s no solution when a is negative? Wait, but option C is -2 and D is -1. Maybe I did something wrong here.Wait, let me try again. Let&#39;s suppose a is negative. Then:Original inequality: |ax + 1| ≤ 3 ⇒ -3 ≤ ax + 1 ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ ax ≤ 2Since a is negative, solving for x would reverse inequalities:Divide by a (negative):Lower bound: (-4)/a ≥ xUpper bound: 2/a ≤ xBut the solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So, equating:(-4)/a = 1 and 2/a = -2First equation: (-4)/a = 1 ⇒ a = -4Second equation: 2/a = -2 ⇒ a = -1Again, conflicting values. So, no solution when a is negative. Hence, only possible solution is a = 2. So, the answer is A: 2.But wait, let me check with a = 2.f(x) = |2x + 1|The inequality |2x + 1| ≤ 3.Which is -3 ≤ 2x + 1 ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ 2x ≤ 2Divide by 2: -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. Exactly the given solution set. So, yes, a = 2 works.But let me check the other options just in case. Option C: a = -2.Let me test a = -2.f(x) = |-2x + 1| = |1 - 2x|Inequality: |1 - 2x| ≤ 3Which is -3 ≤ 1 - 2x ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ -2x ≤ 2Divide by -2 (reverse inequalities):(-4)/(-2) ≥ x ≥ 2/(-2)Which is 2 ≥ x ≥ -1, so -1 ≤ x ≤ 2. But the given solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So, this doesn&#39;t match. So, a = -2 is not correct.Option D: a = -1.f(x) = |-1x + 1| = |1 - x|Inequality: |1 - x| ≤ 3Which is -3 ≤ 1 - x ≤ 3Subtract 1: -4 ≤ -x ≤ 2Multiply by -1 (reverse inequalities):4 ≥ x ≥ -2, so -2 ≤ x ≤ 4. But the given solution set is -2 ≤ x ≤ 1. So, this is not matching either.So, only a = 2 works. So, answer is A.But wait, the problem states the solution set is {x | -2 ≤ x ≤ 1}, which is exactly what we get when a = 2, so yes. So, the answer is A:2.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given ( f(x) = |ax + 1| ) where ( a in mathbb{R} ), we need to find the value of ( a ) such that the solution set of the inequality ( f(x) leq 3 ) is ( {x | -2 leq x leq 1} ).The inequality ( |ax + 1| leq 3 ) can be rewritten as:[-3 leq ax + 1 leq 3]Subtracting 1 from all parts, we get:[-4 leq ax leq 2]To isolate ( x ), we divide by ( a ). We need to consider the sign of ( a ):1. Case 1: ( a &gt; 0 )   - Dividing by ( a ) preserves the inequality direction:     [     -frac{4}{a} leq x leq frac{2}{a}     ]   - Given the solution set ( -2 leq x leq 1 ), we equate:     [     -frac{4}{a} = -2 quad text{and} quad frac{2}{a} = 1     ]   - Solving ( frac{2}{a} = 1 ) gives ( a = 2 ). Checking the lower bound:     [     -frac{4}{2} = -2     ]   - Both conditions are satisfied, so ( a = 2 ) is a valid solution.2. Case 2: ( a &lt; 0 )   - Dividing by ( a ) reverses the inequality direction. However, solving the resulting inequalities leads to contradictions, as shown in the detailed steps. No valid solution for ( a &lt; 0 ) exists.Testing other options (C: -2 and D: -1) confirms they do not satisfy the given solution set. Therefore, the correct value is ( a = 2 ).[boxed{A}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>From the given information, we have the inequality |ax + 1| leq 3,  which implies -3 leq ax + 1 leq 3, i.e., -4 leq ax leq 2, i.e., -2 leq x leq 1,  Therefore, a = 2,  Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{A}.

The store has a scale, but the weights they have can only measure between 50 to 70 kilograms. The question is asking for the minimum number of weighings needed to determine the weight of each individual bag. The options are 4, 5, 6, or 7 times. Hmm, let&#39;s try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the constraints. Each bag is between 25 and 30 kg. So, each bag is at least 25 kg and at most 30 kg. The scale can only measure weights between 50 and 70 kg. That means we can&#39;t weigh just one bag because one bag is 25-30 kg, which is below the minimum weight the scale can measure. So, we have to combine multiple bags to get a total weight within 50-70 kg.The goal is to determine the exact weight of each of the five bags. So, we need to find a way through weighing combinations of these bags such that we can set up equations and solve for each individual weight. Each weighing gives us the sum of the weights of a subset of bags. If we can set up enough equations (i.e., weigh enough subsets) such that each bag&#39;s weight can be uniquely determined, then that&#39;s the number of weighings needed.Let me think. Let&#39;s denote the bags as A, B, C, D, E. Each of these has an unknown weight between 25 and 30 kg. We need to find A, B, C, D, E.Since each weighing can only measure between 50 and 70 kg, the minimum number of bags we can weigh together is 2 (since 2*25=50) and the maximum number is 2 (since 3*25=75, which is over 70). Wait, hold on. Wait, 3 bags each at 25 kg would be 75 kg, which is over the 70 kg limit. So actually, the maximum number of bags we can weigh together is 2, because 3 bags would exceed the scale&#39;s capacity. Wait, but 2 bags would be between 50 and 60 kg (since each is up to 30 kg). Wait, 2*30=60. But the scale can measure up to 70 kg. Wait, no. Wait, the bags are 25-30 kg each. So, two bags would be 50-60 kg, which is within the scale&#39;s 50-70 kg range. Three bags would be 75-90 kg, which exceeds the scale&#39;s maximum capacity of 70 kg. So, actually, we can only weigh two bags at a time. Wait, but 2 bags would be 50-60 kg, which is within the 50-70 kg range. So, actually, three bags would start at 75 kg, which is over 70 kg. Therefore, the maximum number of bags we can weigh at once is two. So, each weighing can only consist of one or two bags? Wait, but one bag is 25-30 kg, which is below the scale&#39;s minimum of 50 kg. Therefore, we must weigh at least two bags each time. So, each weighing must be exactly two bags, giving a total between 50 and 60 kg. Therefore, each weighing gives the sum of two bags.So, the problem reduces to: given five unknown quantities (A, B, C, D, E), each between 25 and 30, we can only take pairwise sums (each between 50 and 60). We need to find the minimal number of such pairwise weighings needed to uniquely determine all five quantities.Hmm, okay. So, in linear algebra terms, each weighing is an equation: A + B = some value, C + D = another value, etc. The question is, how many such equations are needed to solve for all five variables. Normally, with five variables, you need five equations. However, these equations are not arbitrary; they are sums of pairs. Also, we have bounds on each variable (25-30), which might help in reducing the number of weighings needed.But perhaps not. Let me think. If we can set up equations such that each equation involves two variables, and the system of equations is solvable. But with five variables, how many equations do we need? If each equation gives information about two variables, the number of equations needed would generally be at least five, but depending on the structure, maybe fewer. However, because each equation only links two variables, and the variables are interrelated, maybe we can do it with fewer weighings. Wait, but in linear algebra terms, if we have a system of equations where each equation is the sum of two variables, then the system&#39;s rank depends on how the equations are connected. For example, if we have equations A+B, B+C, C+D, D+E, then we can solve step by step. But even so, each equation introduces a new variable. But in this case, with five variables, maybe we need four equations? Wait, no. Let me think. If you have five variables, you need five independent equations. If each equation is a sum of two variables, then each equation relates two variables. So, the number of equations needed would depend on the structure.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way. For example, if we use the fact that all variables are within a known range, we can use that to deduce possible values. For example, if we weigh A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, then we can subtract those sums from each other to get B-C, B-D, B-E, etc. But that requires multiple weighings involving the same bag. However, each time we weigh a pair, we have to consider that each weighing must be two bags. So, if we want to weigh A+B, then A+C, then A+D, etc., that would require multiple weighings where bag A is weighed with different bags. But is that allowed? The problem doesn&#39;t say that we can&#39;t reuse bags in different weighings. So, perhaps we can do that.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of combinations. How many unique pairs can we have from five bags? That&#39;s C(5,2)=10 pairs. But we don&#39;t need to weigh all of them. We need to find a minimal set of pairs such that the resulting system of equations can be solved uniquely, given the constraints on each variable (25-30). So, perhaps there is a way to choose a subset of these pairs such that the equations can be solved with the fewest weighings.Alternatively, perhaps we can use a method similar to binary search or some other strategy. Let me think.Alternatively, consider that if you have five variables, each between 25-30. If we can find the total weight of all five bags, then along with some individual sums, we can solve for each. But to weigh all five bags together, their total weight would be 125-150 kg. But the scale can only measure up to 70 kg, so we can&#39;t weigh all five at once. However, if we can find the total weight by summing up multiple weighings. For example, if we have a set of weighings that cover all bags, and sum those weighings appropriately. Wait, but if we have overlapping weighings, how can we get the total? For example, if we weigh A+B, C+D, E+A, B+C, D+E... Hmm, overlapping pairs would complicate summing.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of weighings is 4. Let me see. Suppose we weigh four different pairs, such that each bag is weighed twice. For example:Weigh A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E. Then, we have four equations:1. A + B = S12. A + C = S23. A + D = S34. A + E = S4From these four equations, we can express B, C, D, E in terms of A:B = S1 - AC = S2 - AD = S3 - AE = S4 - AThen, if we can find another equation involving B, C, D, or E, we can solve for A. But we need a fifth equation. However, we only have four weighings here. Alternatively, maybe we can use the total weight. But without knowing the total weight, we can&#39;t. Wait, but if we can find the total weight by some other means. If we have four equations, but we have five variables, we need a fifth equation. So, unless there&#39;s a way to deduce A from the constraints of the weights (25-30). Let&#39;s see.Suppose we have A + B = S1 (between 50-60)Similarly, A + C = S2, A + D = S3, A + E = S4.Then, B = S1 - A, C = S2 - A, D = S3 - A, E = S4 - A.Each of B, C, D, E must be between 25-30. Therefore, S1 - A ≥25 ⇒ A ≤ S1 -25Similarly, S1 - A ≤30 ⇒ A ≥ S1 -30Same for the others:A ≤ S2 -25A ≥ S2 -30A ≤ S3 -25A ≥ S3 -30A ≤ S4 -25A ≥ S4 -30So, combining all these inequalities, A must satisfy:A ≥ max(S1 -30, S2 -30, S3 -30, S4 -30)andA ≤ min(S1 -25, S2 -25, S3 -25, S4 -25)Given that S1, S2, S3, S4 are each between 50-60, so S_i -30 would be between 20-30, and S_i -25 would be between 25-35.But since A is between 25-30, the lower bounds would be max(S1 -30, ..., 25). Wait, since S_i -30 could be as low as 20, but A must be at least 25, so the lower bound is 25.Similarly, upper bound is min(S1 -25, ..., 30). Because S_i -25 could be up to 35, but A can&#39;t exceed 30. So, A is between 25 and 30.But unless these inequalities narrow down A to a unique value, we can&#39;t determine A exactly. So, unless the combination of these inequalities gives a unique A, which would only happen if the ranges from each equation overlap on a single value.But given that each S_i is known (from the weighings), the inequalities could potentially narrow down A to a specific value. For example, suppose S1=55, S2=56, S3=57, S4=58.Then:A ≤55-25=30A ≤56-25=31 → 30A ≤57-25=32 →30A ≤58-25=33 →30A ≥55-30=25A ≥56-30=26A ≥57-30=27A ≥58-30=28So combining these, A must be ≥28 and ≤30. But since A is an integer? Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the weights are integers. So, they could be real numbers between 25 and 30. Therefore, A is in [28,30]. Then, B =55 - A, which would be in [55 -30, 55 -28] = [25,27]. Similarly, C=56 - A, which is [56 -30, 56 -28] = [26,28], D=57 - A = [27,29], E=58 - A = [28,30]. However, each of B, C, D, E must also be between 25 and 30. So, these ranges are all within the allowed 25-30 except maybe D and E. Wait, D=57 - A. If A is between 28-30, then D is between 27-29. But since D must be at least 25, that&#39;s okay. Similarly, E=58 - A is 28-30, which is acceptable.But in this case, A is still not uniquely determined; it could be anywhere from 28 to 30. So, unless we have additional information, we can&#39;t determine A exactly. Therefore, with four weighings of A with each other bag, we can narrow down A to a range, but not a specific value.Therefore, we need at least one more weighing to determine A. For example, if we weigh B + C. Then, B + C = (S1 - A) + (S2 - A) = S1 + S2 - 2A. If we know B + C, then we can solve for A: A = (S1 + S2 - (B + C))/2. But since we&#39;ve weighed B + C, we can substitute that in. Wait, but if we weigh B + C, that&#39;s another weighing. So, with five weighings, we can set up five equations:1. A + B = S12. A + C = S23. A + D = S34. A + E = S45. B + C = S5Then, from equations 1 and 2, we can subtract them: B - C = S1 - S2. From equation 5: B + C = S5. Then, we can solve for B and C:Adding the two equations:(B - C) + (B + C) = (S1 - S2) + S5 ⇒ 2B = S1 - S2 + S5 ⇒ B = (S1 - S2 + S5)/2Similarly, subtracting:(B + C) - (B - C) = S5 - (S1 - S2) ⇒ 2C = S5 - S1 + S2 ⇒ C = (S5 - S1 + S2)/2Once we have B and C, we can get A from equation 1: A = S1 - BThen, D and E from equations 3 and 4: D = S3 - A, E = S4 - ASo, with five weighings, this system can be solved. But the question is asking for the minimal number. The options are 4,5,6,7. So, is five the answer? But the options include 4, which makes me think maybe there&#39;s a smarter way.Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that all bags are within a specific range, so differences can be calculated. Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose we do four weighings, each combining different bags such that each bag is weighed twice. For example:Weighing 1: A + BWeighing 2: C + DWeighing 3: A + CWeighing 4: B + DThen, we can set up equations:1. A + B = S12. C + D = S23. A + C = S34. B + D = S4We have four equations with four variables (A, B, C, D). Then, the fifth variable E can be determined by another weighing, say E + something. Wait, but we can&#39;t weigh E alone. So, perhaps fifth weighing is E + another bag, but since E hasn&#39;t been involved in any previous weighings, we need to involve it. Wait, but in this case, E hasn&#39;t been weighed yet, so we need a fifth weighing that includes E. So, maybe:Weighing 5: E + ABut then, with five weighings, we can solve for all variables. But the question is, can we do it in fewer?Alternatively, think of it as a graph where each weighing is an edge connecting two nodes (bags). To solve for all variables, the graph must be connected and have enough edges to form a rigid structure. In graph terms, for five nodes, a connected graph requires at least four edges (a tree). But with four edges, you can only connect all five nodes in a tree structure, but each edge gives an equation of the sum of two nodes. However, with a tree structure, you can express variables in terms of others, but without additional edges (equations), you cannot determine the absolute values because you have a system with one free variable. Therefore, to resolve the absolute values, you need additional edges (equations).But given that each variable has known bounds (25-30), perhaps those bounds can help in determining the exact values. For example, if you have a tree with four edges, you can express all variables in terms of one variable, say A. Then, using the bounds on each variable (25-30), you can narrow down the possible value of A. If the intersection of all these bounds results in a unique value for A, then you can determine all variables with just four weighings. Otherwise, you need more.Let&#39;s test this idea. Suppose we have four weighings forming a tree. For example:Weighing 1: A + B = S1Weighing 2: B + C = S2Weighing 3: C + D = S3Weighing 4: D + E = S4This is a chain: A-B-C-D-E. Each subsequent weighing adds a new bag. Now, we can express all variables in terms of A.From Weighing 1: B = S1 - AFrom Weighing 2: C = S2 - B = S2 - (S1 - A) = S2 - S1 + AFrom Weighing 3: D = S3 - C = S3 - (S2 - S1 + A) = S3 - S2 + S1 - AFrom Weighing 4: E = S4 - D = S4 - (S3 - S2 + S1 - A) = S4 - S3 + S2 - S1 + ANow, we have expressions for B, C, D, E in terms of A. Each of these must satisfy 25 ≤ B, C, D, E ≤30. So:For B: 25 ≤ S1 - A ≤30 ⇒ A ≥ S1 -30 and A ≤ S1 -25For C: 25 ≤ S2 - S1 + A ≤30 ⇒ 25 - S2 + S1 ≤ A ≤30 - S2 + S1For D: 25 ≤ S3 - S2 + S1 - A ≤30 ⇒ S3 - S2 + S1 -30 ≤ A ≤ S3 - S2 + S1 -25For E: 25 ≤ S4 - S3 + S2 - S1 + A ≤30 ⇒25 - S4 + S3 - S2 + S1 ≤ A ≤30 - S4 + S3 - S2 + S1Also, A itself must be between 25 and 30.So, combining all these inequalities, we can find the possible range for A. If this range is a single value, then A is uniquely determined, and so are all others. If not, then we can&#39;t determine A uniquely, requiring additional weighings.But whether this range collapses to a single value depends on the specific values of S1, S2, S3, S4. However, since S1, S2, S3, S4 are measurements we take, they are known. Therefore, after performing these four weighings, we can compute the range for A and see if it&#39;s unique.But is it possible that for any possible weights of the bags (within 25-30), the resulting ranges for A would always collapse to a single value? Or is there a possibility that A could still be in a range, necessitating another weighing?Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose all bags are exactly 25 kg. Then:Weighing 1: A+B=50Weighing 2: B+C=50Weighing 3: C+D=50Weighing 4: D+E=50Expressing in terms of A:B =50 - AC=50 - B=50 - (50 - A)=AD=50 - C=50 - AE=50 - D=50 - (50 - A)=ASo, variables are:A, 50 - A, A, 50 - A, AGiven that each variable must be 25, we have A=25, 50 - A=25 ⇒ A=25. So, in this case, the range for A would collapse to 25.But suppose the bags have different weights. Let&#39;s take another example where A=25, B=25, C=25, D=25, E=30. But wait, E=30 is allowed. Let&#39;s see:Weighing 1: A+B=50Weighing 2: B+C=50Weighing 3: C+D=50Weighing 4: D+E=55 (since D=25, E=30)Expressing in terms of A:B=50 - AC=50 - B=50 - (50 - A)=AD=50 - C=50 - AE=55 - D=55 - (50 - A)=5 + ABut E must be 30, so 5 + A=30 ⇒ A=25. Which works. Then, B=25, C=25, D=25, E=30. So, A is uniquely determined.Another example: Let’s say A=26, B=24. Wait, no, B must be at least 25. So, all bags are between 25-30. Let&#39;s pick A=26, B=24. Not allowed. Let&#39;s pick A=26, B=25. Then:Weighing 1: A+B=51Weighing 2: B+C= S2. If B=25, then C= S2 -25. Suppose C=25, so S2=50Weighing 3: C+D=50. If C=25, then D=25Weighing 4: D+E=55 (D=25, so E=30)Expressing in terms of A:B=51 - AC=50 - B=50 - (51 - A)=A -1D=50 - C=50 - (A -1)=51 - AE=55 - D=55 - (51 - A)=4 + AConstraints:B=51 - A must be ≥25 and ≤30 ⇒ A ≤26 and A ≥21. But A must be ≥25, so 25 ≤A ≤26C=A -1 must be ≥25 ⇒ A ≥26. So, A must be exactly 26.Thus, A=26. Then:B=51 -26=25C=26 -1=25D=51 -26=25E=4 +26=30All variables are within 25-30. So, here, the constraints forced A to be 26.Another example where maybe A isn&#39;t uniquely determined? Let&#39;s try.Suppose A=27, B=24. No, B must be ≥25. Let&#39;s try A=27, B=25 (since 27+25=52)Weighing 1: A+B=52Weighing 2: B+C= S2. Let’s say B=25, so C=S2 -25. Suppose C=25, so S2=50Weighing 3: C+D=50. If C=25, D=25Weighing 4: D+E=55. D=25 ⇒ E=30Expressing in terms of A:B=52 -AC=50 - B=50 - (52 - A)=A -2D=50 - C=50 - (A -2)=52 - AE=55 - D=55 - (52 - A)=3 + AConstraints:B=52 - A ≥25 ⇒ A ≤27B=52 - A ≤30 ⇒ A ≥22 ⇒ A ≥25 (since A≥25)C=A -2 ≥25 ⇒ A ≥27C=A -2 ≤30 ⇒ A ≤32 ⇒ A ≤30Thus, A must be exactly 27.Then:B=52 -27=25C=27 -2=25D=52 -27=25E=3 +27=30Again, A is uniquely determined.Hmm, interesting. So, in these examples, even with four weighings arranged in a chain, the constraints force A to be a unique value. Is this always the case?Suppose we have A=25, B=30 (allowed, since 25+30=55)Weighing 1: A+B=55Weighing 2: B+C= S2. If B=30, then C= S2 -30. Let&#39;s say C=25, so S2=55Weighing 3: C+D=50 (C=25 ⇒ D=25)Weighing 4: D+E=55 (D=25 ⇒ E=30)Expressing in terms of A:B=55 -AC=55 - B=55 - (55 -A)=AD=50 - C=50 -AE=55 - D=55 - (50 -A)=5 + AConstraints:B=55 -A must be between 25-30 ⇒ 25 ≤55 -A ≤30 ⇒25 ≤55 -A ⇒A ≤30; and 55 -A ≤30 ⇒A ≥25. So A is between25-30C=A must be between25-30 ⇒ A between25-30D=50 -A must be between25-30 ⇒ 25 ≤50 -A ≤30 ⇒20 ≤A ≤25. But since A ≥25, A=25Thus, A=25, leading to B=30, C=25, D=25, E=30So again, the constraints force A=25.Another example with more variation. Suppose A=28, B=27 (total 55)Weighing1: A+B=55Weighing2: B+C= let&#39;s say B=27, so C=25, S2=52Weighing3: C+D=50 ⇒ D=25Weighing4: D+E=55 ⇒ E=30Expressing in terms of A:B=55 -AC=52 - B=52 - (55 -A)=A -3D=50 - C=50 - (A -3)=53 - AE=55 - D=55 - (53 - A)=2 + AConstraints:B=55 -A ≥25 ⇒A ≤30B=55 -A ≤30 ⇒A ≥25C=A -3 ≥25 ⇒A ≥28C=A -3 ≤30 ⇒A ≤33 ⇒A ≤30Thus, A must be ≥28 and ≤30D=53 - A ≥25 ⇒A ≤28D=53 - A ≤30 ⇒A ≥23 ⇒A ≥25Therefore, A must be exactly 28Thus, A=28, B=27, C=25, D=25, E=30So, even with more variation, the constraints narrow down A uniquely.Therefore, in these examples, using four weighings arranged in a chain allows us to determine all variables due to the overlapping constraints narrowing down the possible values of A to a single number. Therefore, maybe four weighings are enough.Wait, but in all these examples, the chain was A-B-C-D-E, and each subsequent weighing introduced a new bag. But in the problem, there are five bags. If we use four weighings in a chain, we can cover all five bags. Wait, no. A chain of four weighings connects five bags. For example:Weighing1: A+BWeighing2: B+CWeighing3: C+DWeighing4: D+EThis connects all five bags in a chain. Then, as shown earlier, expressing everything in terms of A and using the constraints to solve for A. If this works, then four weighings are sufficient.But in the previous examples, it did work. But is there a scenario where four weighings aren&#39;t enough? Let&#39;s try.Suppose the actual weights are:A=25, B=30, C=25, D=30, E=25Weighing1: A+B=55Weighing2: B+C=55Weighing3: C+D=55Weighing4: D+E=55Expressing variables:B=55 -AC=55 - B=55 - (55 -A)=AD=55 - C=55 -AE=55 - D=55 - (55 -A)=AThus, variables are:A, 55 -A, A, 55 -A, AConstraints:A must be between25-3055 -A must be between25-30 ⇒A between25-30 (since55 -30=25, 55-25=30)Thus, A can be any value between25-30, and all other variables would be within the required range. Wait, but in this case, we can&#39;t determine A uniquely because there&#39;s a symmetry. For example, if A=25, then B=30, C=25, D=30, E=25. If A=30, then B=25, C=30, D=25, E=30. Both satisfy all four weighings.Therefore, in this case, four weighings aren&#39;t enough to determine the exact weights because there are multiple solutions within the constraints. Therefore, we need an additional weighing to break the symmetry.So, in this scenario, with four weighings arranged as a chain, we end up with two possible solutions: one where A=25 and the other where A=30. Therefore, we need a fifth weighing to differentiate between these two possibilities.For example, if we add a fifth weighing, say Weighing5: A + C. In the first case (A=25), A + C=25+25=50. In the second case (A=30), A + C=30+30=60. So, weighing A + C would give either 50 or 60, thus determining the actual value of A.Alternatively, if we choose a different fifth weighing, like B + D. In the first case, B + D=30+30=60. In the second case, B + D=25+25=50. So, again, this would resolve the ambiguity.Therefore, in cases where the weighings result in symmetries or multiple possible solutions, an additional weighing is needed. Hence, the minimal number of weighings required is five.But the options given are (A)4, (B)5, (C)6, (D)7. So, the answer should be 5? But wait, in the previous examples, sometimes four weighings were sufficient, but in the case with alternating weights, four weren&#39;t enough. Therefore, depending on the actual weights, four might not be enough, so we need to consider the worst-case scenario. Since the problem asks for &quot;at least ( ) times of weighing are needed,&quot; meaning the minimal number that works in all cases, regardless of the actual weights. So, if there exists a case where four weighings aren&#39;t enough, then the answer must be higher.In the example I constructed, four weighings weren&#39;t sufficient because there were two possible solutions. Therefore, to cover all possible cases, we need at least five weighings.But wait, maybe there&#39;s a different strategy of choosing weighings that avoids such symmetries. For example, instead of a chain, use a star pattern where one bag is weighed with all others. As I considered earlier.So, weigh A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E. Then, as I discussed earlier, you can express B, C, D, E in terms of A. Then, using the constraints that each of B, C, D, E must be between25-30, you can narrow down A&#39;s possible range. In the previous example where A=25 and all others are 25 or 30 alternately, this method would have:Weighings:A+B=55A+C=50A+D=55A+E=50Thus:B=55 -AC=50 -AD=55 -AE=50 -AConstraints:B=55 -A must be between25-30 ⇒A between25-30C=50 -A must be between25-30 ⇒A between20-25. But since A≥25, A=25Similarly, D=55 -A must be between25-30 ⇒A=25-30E=50 -A must be between25-30 ⇒A=20-25 ⇒A=25Therefore, A must be25, which then gives B=30, C=25, D=30, E=25. So, in this case, even with four weighings arranged as a star, the constraints force A=25, thus uniquely determining all variables.Wait, but in this case, even though there was a symmetry in B and D, and C and E, the constraints forced A to be25. So, maybe arranging the weighings as a star (weighing one bag against all others) allows the constraints to narrow down A uniquely?Let me test with the previous example where there was ambiguity in the chain method.Suppose the actual weights are A=25, B=30, C=25, D=30, E=25.Weighings:1. A+B=552. A+C=503. A+D=554. A+E=50Expressing:B=55 -AC=50 -AD=55 -AE=50 -AConstraints:B=55 -A ≥25 ⇒A ≤30B=55 -A ≤30 ⇒A ≥25C=50 -A ≥25 ⇒A ≤25C=50 -A ≤30 ⇒A ≥20 ⇒A=25Similarly, D=55 -A same as B: A between25-30E=50 -A same as C: A=25Therefore, combining all constraints, A must be25. Therefore, even in this case, four weighings arranged as a star uniquely determine A=25, leading to all other variables. So, maybe four weighings are sufficient?Wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier chain example where four weighings led to ambiguity. But in the star arrangement, four weighings seem to resolve the ambiguity.So, the difference is in how the weighings are structured. If we use a star pattern (one central bag weighed with all others), the constraints on each secondary bag (must be between25-30) force the central bag&#39;s weight to a unique value. Whereas in the chain pattern, there can be ambiguities.Therefore, maybe the key is to use a star pattern with four weighings, leading to unique determination.But wait, there are five bags. If we weigh one bag with each of the other four, that&#39;s four weighings. Then, we have four equations:A+B=S1A+C=S2A+D=S3A+E=S4From these, as previously, we can express B, C, D, E in terms of A. Then, using the constraints that each must be between25-30, we can solve for A. As in the example above, this can force A to a unique value.But does this always work? Let&#39;s test with another example.Suppose A=27, B=28, C=25, D=26, E=29.Weighings:1. A+B=552. A+C=523. A+D=534. A+E=56Expressed:B=55 -AC=52 -AD=53 -AE=56 -AConstraints:B=55 -A: 25 ≤55 -A ≤30 ⇒25 ≤A ≤30C=52 -A:25 ≤52 -A ≤30 ⇒22 ≤A ≤27D=53 -A:25 ≤53 -A ≤30 ⇒23 ≤A ≤28E=56 -A:25 ≤56 -A ≤30 ⇒26 ≤A ≤31Combining all constraints:From C: A ≤27From D: A ≤28From E: A ≥26From A itself:25 ≤A ≤30Thus, combining these, A must be between26 ≤A ≤27But A can be 26 or27? Let&#39;s check:If A=26:B=55 -26=29C=52 -26=26D=53 -26=27E=56 -26=30All weights:26,29,26,27,30. All within 25-30. Valid.If A=27:B=55 -27=28C=52 -27=25D=53 -27=26E=56 -27=29All weights:27,28,25,26,29. All within25-30. Valid.So, in this case, with four weighings, we still have two possible solutions: A=26 or A=27. Therefore, four weighings are insufficient to uniquely determine the weights. Hence, we need an additional weighing.Therefore, this example shows that four weighings in the star pattern may not always be sufficient. Therefore, a fifth weighing is necessary to disambiguate.For instance, if we add a fifth weighing, say B + C. In the case where A=26:B=29, C=26 ⇒ B + C=55If A=27:B=28, C=25 ⇒ B + C=53Thus, weighing B + C would give either55 or53, allowing us to determine whether A is26 or27.Therefore, in this case, a fifth weighing is required. Hence, the minimal number of weighings needed is five.But then, the problem is asking for &quot;at least () times of weighing are needed,&quot; which implies the minimal number that works in all cases. Since there exist cases where four weighings are insufficient, the answer must be five.But wait, the options are (A)4, (B)5, (C)6, (D)7.However, in the initial examples, sometimes four weighings sufficed, but in others, they didn&#39;t. Since the problem is asking for the minimal number that works for any possible weight distribution (within 25-30), we have to consider the worst-case scenario. Therefore, the answer must be five.But let me think again. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to choose the weighings such that four are enough. For example, instead of a star or chain, use a different combination.Suppose we use the following four weighings:1. A + B2. A + C3. A + D4. B + C + DWait, but weighing three bags would be 75 kg at minimum (3*25), which exceeds the scale&#39;s maximum of70 kg. So, we can&#39;t weigh three bags together. Therefore, all weighings must be pairs. So, any combination must be two bags. Therefore, we can&#39;t weigh three or more bags at once. So, all weighings are pairs.Therefore, any strategy must use pairs. So, perhaps a combination of weighings that forms a connected graph with cycles, allowing more constraints.For example, weigh the following pairs:1. A + B2. B + C3. C + D4. D + E5. E + ABut this is five weighings. However, maybe with four weighings that form a cycle?For example:1. A + B2. B + C3. C + D4. D + AThis forms a cycle with four weighings. Then, we can solve for A, B, C, D in terms of each other, but E is left out. So, we need a fifth weighing for E.Alternatively, use four weighings that include E.But I need to think if there&#39;s a way to cover all five bags with four weighings such that the system of equations can be solved uniquely.But in general, with five variables and each equation being a sum of two variables, we need at least five equations to have a chance at solving the system, unless the structure of the equations allows for some variables to be expressed in terms of others with overlapping constraints. However, in the example above, with four weighings in a star pattern, we could sometimes determine unique values, but other times not. Similarly, with four weighings in a chain, there were ambiguities.Therefore, to guarantee that we can always solve for all five bags, regardless of their weights within 25-30, we need to have enough weighings such that the system of equations is overdetermined, allowing the constraints to force unique solutions.Given that in some cases four weighings are sufficient and in others not, the minimal number that works for all cases is five. Therefore, the answer should be (B)5.But let me check once more. Suppose we use four weighings in a star pattern, and in case there&#39;s ambiguity, use the constraints to narrow down. But in the example where A could be26 or27, with four weighings, we had two possibilities. However, the problem states that the weights are &quot;each weighing between25 to30kg&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify that they are integers. Therefore, the weights could be real numbers. In such a case, the range for A could be a continuous interval, and unless the constraints collapse it to a single point, we can&#39;t determine A uniquely.But in the real number case, if A can take any value in [26,27], then B, C, D, E would also take continuous ranges. Therefore, without an additional weighing, we can&#39;t determine the exact weights. Therefore, even in the star pattern, four weighings aren&#39;t enough. Hence, five weighings are necessary.Thus, the answer is five weighings, option (B).Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the weight of each bag of flour, we need to consider the constraints: each bag weighs between 25 to 30 kg, and the scale can only measure weights between 50 to 70 kg. This means each weighing must involve exactly two bags (since three bags would exceed the scale&#39;s capacity).The goal is to find the minimum number of weighings needed to determine the exact weight of each of the five bags. Here are the key steps:1. Weighing Strategy:   - We need to set up a system of equations where each equation represents the sum of two bags.   - Each weighing gives an equation involving the sum of two bags, and we need enough equations to solve for all five variables.2. Example Scenarios:   - We considered different strategies such as weighing in a chain (A+B, B+C, C+D, D+E) and weighing in a star pattern (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E).   - In some cases, four weighings were sufficient, but in others, they led to ambiguities due to overlapping constraints.3. Key Insight:   - Using a star pattern (weighing one bag with all others) allows expressing all other bags in terms of one variable (A). However, constraints on the weights (25-30 kg) can narrow down the possible values of A.   - However, even with four weighings, there can be cases where the constraints do not uniquely determine A, necessitating an additional weighing.4. Conclusion:   - To guarantee a unique solution for any possible weight distribution, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where four weighings might not be sufficient. Therefore, five weighings are required to ensure all variables can be uniquely determined.Thus, the minimum number of weighings needed is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so here&#39;s this problem about a store with five bags of flour, each weighing between 25 to 30 kilograms. The store has a scale but only weights that can measure 50 to 70 kilograms. The question is asking for the minimum number of weighings needed to determine the weight of each bag. The options are 4, 5, 6, or 7. Hmm, let&#39;s try to figure this out step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are five bags, each between 25-30 kg. The scale can only use weights in the range of 50-70 kg. So, when they say &quot;measure 50~70 kg,&quot; does that mean the scale can only measure weights in that range? So, if I put something on the scale that&#39;s less than 50 kg or more than 70 kg, it won&#39;t work? So, the total weight you can measure at one time must be between 50 and 70 kg. That complicates things because each bag is 25-30 kg. So, if I put two bags on the scale, the total would be between 50 kg (25+25) and 60 kg (30+30). Wait, 30+30 is 60, which is within the 50-70 kg range. If I put three bags, that would be 75-90 kg, which is over 70, so the scale can&#39;t measure that. Similarly, one bag is 25-30 kg, which is below 50 kg, so the scale can&#39;t measure that either. So, the only possible way to use the scale is by weighing two bags at a time. Because three is too much, and one is too little. So, each weighing has to be exactly two bags. Therefore, the problem reduces to: determine the individual weights of five bags by only weighing them two at a time, with each weighing giving a total between 50 and 70 kg. The question is, how many weighings are needed at minimum to figure out each bag&#39;s exact weight. The options are 4, 5, 6, or 7. Hmm. So, this seems like a system of equations problem. Each weighing gives us the sum of two bags. If we can set up enough equations to solve for the individual weights, then we can determine the minimum number needed. With five variables (the weights of the five bags), we need at least five equations, right? But maybe some weighings can overlap in a way that allows us to create more equations. Wait, but each weighing is a combination of two bags. So, maybe if we do certain combinations, we can set up equations that can be solved. But how many weighings are necessary?Let me think. If we have five bags, let&#39;s call them A, B, C, D, E. Each weighing gives us the sum of two of them. So, for example, if we weigh A+B, then A+C, then A+D, then A+E, then B+C, etc. Each of these would give us different sums. But the problem is, if we have five variables, we need five independent equations to solve for them. However, each weighing gives us one equation (the sum of two variables). Therefore, in theory, if we have five equations (five weighings), and they are independent, then we could solve for all five variables. But wait, is that really the case?Wait, actually, with five variables (A, B, C, D, E), each equation is a sum of two variables. So, each equation is linear. If we can set up a system of linear equations where each equation is the sum of two variables, then the question is whether this system has a unique solution. However, in linear algebra terms, the system might not be full rank. For example, if all the equations are sums of pairs, but there&#39;s some dependency among them. So, maybe five weighings are not enough? Or maybe they are?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a combinatorial approach here. Let&#39;s think about how combinations work. With five bags, the number of unique pairs is C(5,2) = 10. So, there are 10 possible different pairs. But we need to determine which pairs to weigh such that the resulting equations can be solved uniquely for each bag&#39;s weight. But since each weighing is a pair, and each pair gives the sum, how many weighings do we need? The answer options suggest that it&#39;s between 4 to 7. Since 5 variables might need 5 equations, but perhaps more because each equation is a combination of two variables, so maybe more equations are needed to resolve interdependencies. Let me check.Suppose we have four weighings. Let&#39;s say we weigh A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E. Then we have four equations:1. A + B = S12. A + C = S23. A + D = S34. A + E = S4Then, if we subtract each equation from the first one, we can get B - C = S1 - S2, B - D = S1 - S3, B - E = S1 - S4. However, this gives us differences between B, C, D, E, but without another equation involving B, C, D, E without A, we can&#39;t determine the exact values. So, with four equations, we might not have enough information. For example, if we don&#39;t weigh B+C or something else, we might not be able to resolve the differences. So, maybe four weighings aren&#39;t enough. Alternatively, what if we use a different combination. For example, weigh A+B, B+C, C+D, D+E. Then, we have four equations:1. A + B = S12. B + C = S23. C + D = S34. D + E = S4But again, with four equations and five variables, we can&#39;t solve for all variables uniquely. There&#39;s still one degree of freedom left. So, we need at least five equations.If we do five weighings, then perhaps we can have a system of five equations. Let&#39;s try:1. A + B = S12. A + C = S23. A + D = S34. A + E = S45. B + C = S5Now, with five equations. Let&#39;s see if we can solve for all variables.From equations 1 and 2: S2 - S1 = C - B. From equation 5: B + C = S5. So, if we have S2 - S1 = C - B, and B + C = S5, we can solve for B and C.Let me denote D1 = S2 - S1 = C - B.So, C = B + D1.Substitute into equation 5: B + (B + D1) = S5 =&gt; 2B + D1 = S5 =&gt; B = (S5 - D1)/2.Then C = (S5 - D1)/2 + D1 = (S5 + D1)/2.Once we have B and C, we can get A from equation 1: A = S1 - B.Then, from equation 3: D = S3 - A.From equation 4: E = S4 - A.So, with five equations, this seems solvable. So, five equations might be sufficient. But wait, does this hold?Wait, but in reality, each equation is a measured value. So, if we can actually set up these equations, then theoretically, we can solve for all variables. So, maybe five weighings are enough? Then why is the answer not B) 5? The options given are A)4, B)5, C)6, D)7.But the answer might be more than five. Maybe the problem is that even though mathematically five equations could be enough, in practice, the way you combine the weighings might not allow you to solve the equations uniquely. Because in some cases, the system of equations might have multiple solutions due to dependencies. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different approach here. Let&#39;s think about information theory. Each weighing gives us a certain amount of information. Each bag&#39;s weight is between 25 and 30 kg. So, each weight can be any real number in that interval. However, if we consider that the weights are integers, which is not stated here, but perhaps in the problem&#39;s context, they might be. Wait, the problem says &quot;each weighing between 25 to 30 kg,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t specify that they&#39;re integers. So, they could be real numbers. But in reality, flour bags are usually whole numbers, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify. Hmm.Assuming they can be any real numbers, then even with five equations, the system might not be solvable if there&#39;s a linear dependency. But if the equations are independent, then five equations would suffice for five variables. However, each equation is a sum of two variables. So, each equation is a linear equation. So, we need to have five independent equations.But in the example I had earlier, the five equations (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, B+C) are independent. Let me check the rank of the matrix.The system would be:1. A + B = S12. A + C = S23. A + D = S34. A + E = S45. B + C = S5Let&#39;s write the coefficient matrix:Equation 1: 1 1 0 0 0Equation 2: 1 0 1 0 0Equation 3: 1 0 0 1 0Equation 4: 1 0 0 0 1Equation 5: 0 1 1 0 0Let&#39;s construct this matrix:Row1: [1,1,0,0,0]Row2: [1,0,1,0,0]Row3: [1,0,0,1,0]Row4: [1,0,0,0,1]Row5: [0,1,1,0,0]Let&#39;s compute the rank of this matrix. If the rank is 5, then the system is solvable. Let&#39;s perform row operations.Subtract Row1 from Rows2,3,4:Row2_new = Row2 - Row1: [0, -1, 1, 0, 0]Row3_new = Row3 - Row1: [0, -1, 0, 1, 0]Row4_new = Row4 - Row1: [0, -1, 0, 0, 1]Row5 remains: [0,1,1,0,0]Now, the matrix is:Row1: [1,1,0,0,0]Row2: [0,-1,1,0,0]Row3: [0,-1,0,1,0]Row4: [0,-1,0,0,1]Row5: [0,1,1,0,0]Now, let&#39;s handle Rows2-5.Let&#39;s take Row2: [0,-1,1,0,0]Multiply by -1: [0,1,-1,0,0]Add to Row5: Row5_new = Row5 + [0,1,-1,0,0] = [0,1+1,1-1,0+0,0+0] = [0,2,0,0,0]Wait, let&#39;s do that step by step.Original Row5: [0,1,1,0,0]Add Row2 multiplied by -1: [0,1,1,0,0] + [0,1,-1,0,0] = [0,2,0,0,0]So, Row5 becomes [0,2,0,0,0]Then, divide Row5 by 2: [0,1,0,0,0]Now, the matrix is:Row1: [1,1,0,0,0]Row2: [0,-1,1,0,0]Row3: [0,-1,0,1,0]Row4: [0,-1,0,0,1]Row5: [0,1,0,0,0]Now, let&#39;s use Row5 to eliminate the other entries in column2.Row1: [1,1,0,0,0] - Row5: [0,1,0,0,0] =&gt; Row1_new: [1,0,0,0,0]Row2: [0,-1,1,0,0] + Row5: [0,1,0,0,0] =&gt; Row2_new: [0,0,1,0,0]Row3: [0,-1,0,1,0] + Row5: [0,1,0,0,0] =&gt; Row3_new: [0,0,0,1,0]Row4: [0,-1,0,0,1] + Row5: [0,1,0,0,0] =&gt; Row4_new: [0,0,0,0,1]So now, the matrix is:Row1: [1,0,0,0,0]Row2: [0,0,1,0,0]Row3: [0,0,0,1,0]Row4: [0,0,0,0,1]Row5: [0,1,0,0,0]So, after these operations, we have a matrix with rank 5. Therefore, the system is full rank, meaning the equations are independent and the system has a unique solution. Therefore, in theory, five weighings could be sufficient if we set up the equations properly. So, why is the answer possibly not B) 5? Maybe there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing here.Wait, but in reality, when you do weighings, you can&#39;t choose the same bag in multiple weighings unless you have a way to combine them. Wait, no, actually, you can weigh different combinations. Each weighing is separate, so you can reuse the same bags in different combinations. For example, you can weigh A+B, then A+C, then A+D, etc. So, as long as each weighing is a different pair, you can do that. So, there&#39;s no restriction on reusing bags in different weighings. Therefore, the previous system is possible, right? So, if you can weigh A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, and B+C, then you can solve for all five variables. Therefore, five weighings should be sufficient.But the answer isn&#39;t B)5? The options are given as (A)4, (B)5, (C)6, (D)7. The problem is from an Olympiad, likely, so maybe there&#39;s a trick here. Let me think again.Wait, maybe the problem is not just about setting up equations, but about uniquely determining each weight given the possible ranges. Because if the weights are in intervals, even with equations, you might have overlapping ranges that make it impossible to distinguish. Wait, but the problem says &quot;to determine the weight of each bag of flour,&quot; so you need exact values. If the weighings give you exact sums, then the equations would give you exact values. But the problem is, how do you know that the weighings give you enough information to find exact values. If all the equations are independent, then yes. But maybe there&#39;s a different approach.Wait, maybe the issue is that you don&#39;t know which bag corresponds to which weight. For example, suppose you weigh A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, and B+C, but after solving, you get the values of A, B, C, D, E. But how do you know which physical bag is which? Wait, but in the problem statement, do they need to determine the weight of each individual bag, meaning they need to know the weight corresponding to each specific bag, not just the multiset of weights. So, for example, if you have five bags, you need to know that bag 1 is 27 kg, bag 2 is 28 kg, etc. So, if the weighings are designed in such a way that each bag is uniquely identified through the weighings, then you can assign the weights correctly. But if the weighings don&#39;t allow you to track which bag is which, then maybe you can&#39;t determine the exact weight of each specific bag, only the set of weights. But in the problem statement, it says &quot;determine the weight of each bag of flour,&quot; which probably means knowing each individual bag&#39;s weight. Therefore, you need to not only find the numerical weights but also associate them with each specific bag.Wait, but if you are doing the weighings yourself, you can keep track of which bags are being weighed each time. Therefore, you can associate the results with the specific combinations, allowing you to solve for each individual bag. Therefore, the equations would let you solve for each variable (A, B, C, D, E) as distinct entities, so you can then label each bag accordingly. Therefore, in that case, five weighings should suffice. But why is the answer not B)5? Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a practical consideration. For example, when you have five equations, even if they are solvable in theory, in practice, you might need additional weighings to confirm the results. But the problem is asking for the minimum number, so theoretically, five should be enough. However, maybe there&#39;s a different approach.Wait, let me think of another way. Suppose you have five bags. Each weighing can measure two bags at a time. Each weighing gives you the sum of two bags. To uniquely determine each bag&#39;s weight, you need each bag to be part of at least two weighings. Otherwise, if a bag is only weighed once, its weight is only determined by that one equation, which might not be sufficient. Wait, but in the previous system, each bag is weighed multiple times. For example, in the five equations I set up, bag A is in four weighings (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E), and bag B is in two weighings (A+B, B+C). Similarly, bag C is in two weighings (A+C, B+C), and bags D and E are each in one weighing (A+D, A+E). Wait, but in that case, bags D and E are each only weighed once. So, their weights are determined solely by their sum with A. But if A is determined from the other equations, then D and E can be determined. So, in that case, even if they are only weighed once, as long as A is known, their individual weights can be found. But is that valid?Yes, because once you know A from the first four equations (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E), but wait, actually, A is determined using the fifth equation as well. Wait, in the previous system, we needed five equations. So, in that case, even though D and E are only in one equation each, the fifth equation (B+C) is necessary to solve for B and C, which then allows solving for A, which in turn allows solving for D and E. So, all variables are determined through the system. Therefore, even if some variables are only in one equation, the system can still be solved as a whole.Therefore, in this case, five weighings should be sufficient. So, why is the answer not B)5? Hmm. Maybe the answer is 5, but given the options, maybe I&#39;m missing something here.Wait, let me check again. The problem says &quot;to determine the weight of each bag of flour, at least ( ) times of weighing are needed.&quot; So, the minimum number. If five is possible, then the answer should be B)5. But maybe in Chinese competitions, sometimes these problems require considering that you can&#39;t do certain combinations or that you need to verify.Wait, but let&#39;s take a concrete example. Suppose the actual weights are A=25, B=26, C=27, D=28, E=29 kg. Then, let&#39;s do the five weighings:1. A+B = 25+26 = 51 kg2. A+C = 25+27 = 52 kg3. A+D = 25+28 = 53 kg4. A+E = 25+29 = 54 kg5. B+C = 26+27 = 53 kgNow, let&#39;s try solving these equations.From equation 1: A + B = 51From equation 2: A + C = 52Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: C - B = 1 =&gt; C = B + 1From equation 5: B + C = 53Substitute C = B + 1 into equation 5: B + (B + 1) = 53 =&gt; 2B + 1 = 53 =&gt; 2B = 52 =&gt; B = 26Then, C = 26 + 1 = 27From equation 1: A = 51 - B = 51 - 26 = 25From equation 3: D = 53 - A = 53 -25 = 28From equation 4: E = 54 - A = 54 -25 = 29So, we get all the weights correctly. Therefore, with five weighings, we can determine each bag&#39;s weight. So, why would the answer be more than five?Alternatively, maybe in some cases, the equations might not be solvable uniquely. For example, if the weighings are not chosen carefully, there might be multiple solutions. But if the weighings are chosen to ensure that the system of equations is full rank, as in the previous example, then five weighings suffice. Therefore, theoretically, five should be possible, so the answer should be B)5. But the options are given, and the answer is one of them. Maybe there&#39;s a different approach here.Wait, let&#39;s think combinatorially. Each weighing gives us the sum of two bags. Each bag must be weighed at least once, right? Because if a bag is never weighed, we can&#39;t determine its weight. Since there are five bags, and each weighing includes two bags, the minimum number of weighings needed just to include all bags at least once is three. Because with two weighings, you can weigh four bags, leaving one out. With three weighings, you can weigh six bags, but since there are only five, you can cover all five with three weighings. However, just being included in a weighing doesn&#39;t determine the weight. So, even if a bag is weighed once, its weight is only known relative to the other bag it was weighed with. So, to determine each bag&#39;s weight uniquely, more weighings are needed.Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the classic coin problem where you have to determine the individual weights using balance scales, but in this case, it&#39;s a regular scale that can measure total weight. The classic problem for determining individual weights with a scale usually involves something like n weighings for n items, but depending on the constraints.Wait, here&#39;s another thought. Since each weighing is a pair of bags, and each weighing gives a sum. If we can find a set of pairs such that each bag is included in exactly two weighings, then we can set up a system where each bag&#39;s weight appears in two equations. For five bags, each in two weighings, that would require (5*2)/2 = 5 weighings. Wait, 5 weighings, each involving two bags, so total of 10 bag participations. Since there are five bags, each in two weighings, 5*2=10. So, that&#39;s possible. For example, arrange the weighings such that each bag is weighed exactly twice. Then, we have five weighings, each of two bags, and each bag is in two weighings. Then, the system would have five equations with each variable appearing twice. However, solving such a system requires that the equations are independent.But if each bag is in two weighings, and the weighings are set up as a cycle, like A+B, B+C, C+D, D+E, E+A, then each bag is in two weighings, but the system is not full rank. For example:1. A + B = S12. B + C = S23. C + D = S34. D + E = S45. E + A = S5This system has five equations, but if you add all equations, you get (A + B + C + D + E) = (S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 + S5)/2. So, you can find the total sum, but each individual equation is part of a cyclic chain, leading to dependencies. Therefore, the system is underdetermined. For example, you can express each variable in terms of the previous one:From equation 1: A = S1 - BFrom equation 2: C = S2 - BFrom equation 3: D = S3 - C = S3 - S2 + BFrom equation 4: E = S4 - D = S4 - S3 + S2 - BFrom equation 5: E + A = S5 =&gt; (S4 - S3 + S2 - B) + (S1 - B) = S5So, S4 - S3 + S2 - B + S1 - B = S5Which gives: S1 + S2 + S4 - S3 - 2B = S5Thus, 2B = S1 + S2 + S4 - S3 - S5Therefore, B = (S1 + S2 + S4 - S3 - S5)/2Once B is known, all others can be found. So, even though it&#39;s a cyclic system, it can still be solved. So, in this case, five weighings can work. Therefore, five weighings are sufficient even in a cyclic system.But maybe there&#39;s a different issue. Let me think again. The problem states that the scale can only measure between 50 to 70 kg. So, each weighing must be of two bags (since one bag is 25-30, two bags are 50-60, which is within 50-70; three bags would be 75-90, which is over 70). Therefore, each weighing must be exactly two bags. So, no single bag can be weighed alone, and no three or more bags can be weighed together.So, the weighings are restricted to exactly two bags each time. Therefore, the previous examples are valid. If you do five weighings in a way that each bag is involved in two weighings (as in the cycle), then you can solve the system. Alternatively, if you do five weighings in a star pattern (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, B+C), as before, which also allows solving.But perhaps in practice, you need more weighings because you need to check consistency or because the equations might have multiple solutions if not chosen carefully. But in the theoretical sense, if you choose five independent weighings, you can solve it. So, why is the answer not five?Wait, maybe the answer is more than five because when you weigh two bags together, the scale only gives you the total weight, but since each bag is between 25-30, the total of two bags is between 50-60. However, the scale can measure up to 70 kg. But since two bags can only sum up to 60, the extra capacity of the scale doesn&#39;t help. Therefore, each weighing gives a number between 50 and 60.But does that affect the number of weighings? I don&#39;t think so. Each weighing still gives exact information about the sum, regardless of the scale&#39;s maximum capacity. So, even if the scale can measure up to 70, but the actual sum is 50-60, it&#39;s still a precise measurement.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and there was a mistranslation, but assuming the translation is accurate, the answer should be five. However, the options given include 4,5,6,7. Maybe there&#39;s another angle.Wait, think about this: if you have five bags, each between 25-30 kg. If you weigh all possible pairs, you get C(5,2)=10 measurements. But you need the minimal number. However, the problem is not about identifying which bag is which in terms of their weights, but determining their exact weights. If the weights are all distinct, then maybe you can use the sums to figure out which is which. But if they are not necessarily distinct, then you need more information.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t state that the weights are distinct. So, they could be all 25 kg, for example. But in that case, all the weighings would result in 50 kg, and you couldn&#39;t tell the individual weights apart. Wait, but if all bags are 25 kg, then every weighing of two bags would be 50 kg. Therefore, if you do multiple weighings and they all result in 50 kg, you can conclude that all bags are 25 kg. Similarly, if all weighings give 60 kg, then all bags are 30 kg. But if there is variation, then the sums would vary.But to determine each individual weight, you need to have each bag involved in enough weighings so that its unique contribution can be identified. If a bag is paired with different bags, then the variation in the sums can help determine its weight.Wait, perhaps an information theory approach: each weighing provides a certain number of bits of information. But since the weights are continuous between 25-30, it&#39;s actually an analog measurement, so the information is infinite in theory. But in practice, since the problem is about mathematical determination, not physical measurement precision, we can assume exact values.Therefore, returning to the linear algebra approach: five independent equations (weighings) should suffice to solve for five variables. So, answer B)5. But the given answer is not clear. Wait, maybe the original problem is in Chinese, and there&#39;s a translation issue. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects you to consider that each weighing can only be done with the given weights, but the problem says &quot;the store has a scale, but it only has weights that can measure 50~70 kg&quot;. Wait, maybe the scale is a balance scale, where you need to put weights on one side and the flour bags on the other? If that&#39;s the case, then the weights mentioned (50-70 kg) are the counterweights. So, to weigh something, you need to put flour bags on one side and the counterweights on the other side. Therefore, the total weight of the flour bags must be equal to the weight you put on the other side. Therefore, each weighing compares a combination of flour bags against a known weight between 50-70 kg.Wait, this is a different interpretation. If the scale is a balance scale, and the store has weights from 50 to 70 kg, then you can only measure combinations of flour bags against these weights. So, for example, you can put some bags on one side and a 50 kg weight on the other side to see if they balance. But in that case, you can only measure if the total weight of the flour bags equals one of the weights (50-70 kg). But since the flour bags are 25-30 kg each, combinations of two bags would be 50-60 kg, so you could use the 50-60 kg weights to measure them. However, if the scale is a balance scale, you can only check for equality, not measure the exact weight. Therefore, you can only determine if a certain combination of bags equals a specific weight. Therefore, each weighing would be a comparison: put two bags on one side and a 50 kg weight on the other, and see if they balance. If they do, the total is 50 kg; if not, you try a higher weight.But in this case, the problem becomes similar to a balance scale problem where you have to determine individual weights by comparing combinations against known weights. This is different from a regular scale that gives you the exact weight. If the scale is a balance scale, then each weighing only tells you whether the total is equal to the weight you put on the other side. Therefore, to find the exact weight, you would have to perform multiple trials. For example, weigh two bags against 50 kg: if they balance, their total is 50 kg; if not, try 51 kg, etc., until you find the exact weight.But this complicates the problem because now, each exact measurement (determining the sum of two bags) could require multiple weighings (one for each possible weight from 50 to 70). However, the problem states that the store has weights that can measure 50~70 kg. So, perhaps they can only use those weights to measure exact amounts. So, if you put two bags on one side and a 50 kg weight on the other, and it balances, you know the total is 50 kg. Similarly, if you use a 51 kg weight and it balances, the total is 51 kg, etc. But each such balancing is a separate weighing.Therefore, to measure the sum of any two bags, you might need multiple weighings (testing different weights) until you find the one that balances. However, the problem is asking for the number of weighings needed to determine each bag&#39;s weight, not the number of weight comparisons. Wait, but in Chinese, the term &quot;weighing&quot; might refer to each time you use the scale, regardless of how many weights you try. But this is unclear.Alternatively, if the scale is a digital scale that can only display weights between 50-70 kg, then putting less than 50 kg or more than 70 kg would give an error or be unmeasurable. Therefore, to use the scale, you must put a combination of bags that totals between 50-70 kg. Since each bag is 25-30 kg, two bags total 50-60 kg, which is within the scale&#39;s capability. Three bags would be 75-90 kg, which is over the limit. Therefore, only combinations of two bags can be weighed.Therefore, the problem reduces to: determine the individual weights of five bags by weighing them two at a time, using a scale that gives exact readings for each weighing. In this case, each weighing gives the exact sum of two bags. Then, the minimum number of weighings required to uniquely determine all five individual weights.In this case, as we discussed earlier, five weighings can suffice if the weighings are chosen such that the resulting system of equations is full rank. However, maybe there is a reason why more weighings are needed. For example, maybe the problem requires that each bag is weighed at least twice, leading to more weighings. But in our earlier example, some bags are only weighed once. However, in reality, if a bag is only weighed once, its weight is determined by that one equation, but dependent on the other equations. For instance, if we have:Weighings: A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, B+CIn this case, bags D and E are only weighed once each. If there&#39;s any error or uncertainty in the weighing of A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, or B+C, then D and E&#39;s weights would be affected. But the problem assumes perfect measurements, so no error. Therefore, even with D and E only being weighed once, their weights can be exactly determined once A is known.However, if there is a possibility that two different sets of weights could produce the same set of weighings, then more weighings are necessary to resolve the ambiguity. For example, suppose there are two different sets of bag weights that result in the same sums for the five weighings. In that case, five weighings wouldn&#39;t be sufficient. But in our previous example, with specific weighings, we could solve uniquely. Therefore, it&#39;s possible that five weighings can be enough, but it&#39;s also possible that with a different set of five weighings, you might not have unique solutions.Therefore, to guarantee that any possible set of weights can be uniquely determined, you might need more weighings. However, the problem is asking for the minimal number of weighings needed, not the number needed to guarantee determination regardless of the weighing strategy. So, if there exists a strategy that can determine the weights in five weighings, then the answer is five. Otherwise, it&#39;s higher.Given that we constructed a concrete example where five weighings sufficed, the answer should be five. However, looking up similar problems, sometimes in these kinds of combinatorial weighing problems, the answer is more due to the need for overlapping weighings to create a solvable system. But in our case, we have a solvable system with five weighings.Wait, but let&#39;s think about degrees of freedom. Each bag has a weight between 25-30 kg. So, each has a range of 5 kg. If we consider that the weights are real numbers, there are infinitely many possibilities. However, with five independent weighings, we can pin down each weight exactly. Therefore, if the weighings are chosen to give independent equations, five weighings are enough.Alternatively, if the problem expects whole numbers, which is common in such problems, then perhaps you can use the integer nature of the weights to reduce the number of weighings. For example, if you know that all weights are integers, then the sums will also be integers, and you can use the chinese remainder theorem or other methods. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the weights are integers, so we can&#39;t assume that.Given all of this, I think the answer should be five weighings. Therefore, the correct option is B)5.But the options given are (A)4, (B)5, (C)6, (D)7. However, according to some sources I recall, similar problems often require n(n-1)/2 weighings, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s similar to a graph where each weighing is an edge, and you need the graph to be connected with certain properties. For five nodes, the minimal number of edges to make it connected is four, but to have each node degree two, it&#39;s five edges. But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, here&#39;s another way. If you consider each weighing as an edge in a graph connecting two nodes (bags), then to determine the weights, the graph must be such that the system of equations is solvable. For that, the graph must be connected and have enough edges to eliminate all degrees of freedom. For five nodes, a connected graph requires at least four edges, but four edges would mean a tree structure, which is minimally connected. However, a tree structure (four edges) would leave one bag connected to only one other bag. For example:A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E. In this case, each bag is connected in a chain. The system of equations would be:A+B = S1B+C = S2C+D = S3D+E = S4This is four equations. However, with five variables, this system is underdetermined. You can express A = S1 - B, C = S2 - B, D = S3 - C = S3 - S2 + B, E = S4 - D = S4 - S3 + S2 - B. But then you have one free variable, B, which can&#39;t be determined. So, you need an additional equation to determine B. Therefore, five edges (weighings) are needed to make the system determined. Therefore, maybe the answer is five. So, I think the correct answer is B)5. However, the options include 4,5,6,7. But in Chinese math problems, sometimes the answer is different. Maybe I need to verify again.Wait, another approach: think of the problem as solving for variables where each equation is a sum of two variables. The number of equations needed is equal to the number of variables if each equation provides independent information. However, in reality, the sum equations are not all independent. For example, if you have equations A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, B+C, as before, you can solve for all variables. But if you have a different set, like A+B, B+C, C+D, D+E, E+A, which is a cycle, you can also solve, as shown earlier. Therefore, five equations are enough.But then, why is the answer not five? Maybe in the problem statement, it says &quot;at least () times of weighing are needed,&quot; meaning that regardless of the method, you can&#39;t do it in fewer than a certain number. So, maybe there&#39;s a lower bound that makes it necessary to use, say, seven weighings. But from our previous example, five is possible. Therefore, the minimal number is five. So, the answer should be B)5.But let me check with another example. Suppose we have five bags: 25,26,27,28,29 kg. Suppose I use the following weighings:1. A+B=512. A+C=523. A+D=534. A+E=545. B+C=53As before, solving these gives us all individual weights. Therefore, five weighings suffice.Alternatively, what if I use four weighings? Let&#39;s see if it&#39;s possible. Suppose we do four weighings:1. A+B=512. A+C=523. A+D=534. A+E=54Then, we can solve for B, C, D, E in terms of A:B=51 - AC=52 - AD=53 - AE=54 - ABut we have no equation involving B, C, D, or E without A. Therefore, we can&#39;t determine the value of A. So, there are infinitely many solutions depending on the value of A. For example, if A=25, then B=26, C=27, D=28, E=29. If A=26, then B=25, C=26, D=27, E=28. But in this case, the bags must each be between 25-30 kg. So, if A=26, then B=25 (valid), C=26 (valid), D=27 (valid), E=28 (valid). But the problem didn&#39;t state that all bags have distinct weights. Therefore, both solutions are possible. Hence, with four weighings, we can&#39;t uniquely determine the weights because there are multiple solutions within the allowed weight ranges. Therefore, four weighings are insufficient.Therefore, at least five weighings are needed. Hence, the answer is B)5.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the weight of each bag of flour, we need to consider the constraints of the scale, which can only measure weights between 50 kg and 70 kg. Each bag weighs between 25 kg and 30 kg, so the only feasible way to use the scale is by weighing two bags at a time. This gives us the sum of two bags&#39; weights, which will be between 50 kg and 60 kg.We need to set up a system of linear equations where each equation represents the sum of two bags. With five bags (A, B, C, D, E), we need at least five independent equations to solve for the five variables. For example, if we weigh the following combinations:1. ( A + B = S_1 )2. ( A + C = S_2 )3. ( A + D = S_3 )4. ( A + E = S_4 )5. ( B + C = S_5 )These equations allow us to solve for each variable:- From equations 1 and 2, we can find ( C - B ).- Using equation 5, we can solve for ( B ) and ( C ).- Once ( B ) is known, we can find ( A ) from equation 1.- Then, ( D ) and ( E ) can be determined from equations 3 and 4.This system of equations is full rank, meaning it has a unique solution. Therefore, five weighings are sufficient to determine the individual weights of all five bags. After verifying with concrete examples and considering the constraints, the minimum number of weighings needed is determined to be 5.boxed{B}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>10.

And the a_i are also in [0,1]. Hmm. So, essentially, I need to choose positions a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ within [0,1] such that no matter how someone else places their ordered points x₁ to xₙ in [0,1], at least one of those x&#39;s will be within λ of its corresponding a. And I need the smallest possible λ. Let me think. Maybe this is a covering problem? Like, the intervals [a_i - λ, a_i + λ] need to cover the entire interval [0,1], but with the constraint that the a_i are ordered? Wait, but the x_i are also ordered. So it&#39;s not exactly covering in the usual sense because the x_i have to be ordered. So even if the a_i are spread out, the x_i could bunch up in a way that they are all close to some a_i. Wait, no. The problem says that for any x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ ... ≤ xₙ in [0,1], the minimum distance between x_i and a_i (for i=1 to n) is ≤ λ. So for each set of ordered x&#39;s, at least one x_i is within λ of a_i. But the a_i are fixed beforehand. So we need to place a₁,...,aₙ in [0,1] such that any increasing sequence x₁,...,xₙ in [0,1] has at least one x_i within λ of a_i. And we need the minimal such λ.So, equivalently, the maximum over all possible x sequences of the minimal distance from x_i to a_i, and we need to minimize that maximum by choosing the a_i&#39;s appropriately. So it&#39;s a minimax problem.How can I approach this? Maybe start with small n and see a pattern.Let&#39;s take n=1. Then we need to place a₁ in [0,1] such that for any x₁ in [0,1], |x₁ - a₁| ≤ λ. The minimal λ here is 1/2, achieved by setting a₁ = 0.5. Then the maximum distance is 0.5.For n=2. We need to place a₁ and a₂ in [0,1] such that for any x₁ ≤ x₂ in [0,1], either |x₁ - a₁| ≤ λ or |x₂ - a₂| ≤ λ. We need to minimize λ. What&#39;s the optimal placement here? If we set a₁ and a₂ at 1/4 and 3/4, then the maximum distance would be 1/4. Let me check. Suppose x₁ and x₂ are both in [0,1/4]. Then |x₁ - 1/4| ≤ 1/4, but x₁ is in [0,1/4], so the distance is at most 1/4. Wait, but x₂ can be anywhere from x₁ to 1. If x₂ is in [0,1/4], then |x₂ - 3/4| is larger, but x₁ is already within 1/4 of a₁. So maybe this works. Similarly, if x₁ and x₂ are in [3/4,1], then x₂ is within 1/4 of a₂. If they are in between, say [1/4, 3/4], then x₁ could be up to 1/4 away from a₁ if x₁ is at 1/2, but no, wait. If a₁ is 1/4, then x₁ in [1/4, 3/4] would have distance up to 3/4 - 1/4 = 1/2. Wait, that&#39;s not right. Wait, no. If a₁ is at 1/4 and a₂ at 3/4. Let&#39;s take the worst case where x₁ and x₂ are both in the middle. Suppose x₁ = x₂ = 1/2. Then |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4 and |1/2 - 3/4| = 1/4. So the minimal distance is 1/4. If x₁ is 1/4 + λ and x₂ is 3/4 - λ, then the minimal distance would be λ. Wait, but if λ is 1/4, then even if x₁ is 1/2, the distance to a₁ is 1/4. Wait, but x₁ can be as far as 1/2 from a₁ if a₁ is at 0. But if a₁ is at 1/4, the maximum distance from a₁ would be if x₁ is at 1, but x₁ can&#39;t be after a₂. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, for n=2, maybe the optimal λ is 1/3. Let me think. If we set a₁ at 1/3 and a₂ at 2/3. Then any x₁ ≤ x₂. If x₁ is in [0,1/3], then |x₁ - a₁| ≤ 1/3. If x₂ is in [2/3,1], then |x₂ - a₂| ≤ 1/3. What if both x₁ and x₂ are in [1/3, 2/3]. Then x₁ is at least 0 distance from a₁, but if x₁ is 1/3 and x₂ is 2/3, then the minimal distance is 0. If they are somewhere in the middle, say x₁ = x₂ = 1/2. Then |1/2 - 1/3| = 1/6 and |1/2 - 2/3| = 1/6. So the minimal distance is 1/6. Wait, that&#39;s less than 1/3. Hmm. So maybe λ can be smaller? But wait, the problem states that for any x sequence, the minimal distance is &lt;= λ. So if the minimal distance in the worst case is 1/6, then λ can be 1/6? But that seems too optimistic.Wait, no. If a₁ and a₂ are at 1/3 and 2/3, then for x₁ = 0 and x₂ = 1, the minimal distances are |0 - 1/3| = 1/3 and |1 - 2/3| = 1/3. So λ would be at least 1/3 here. But in the middle, the minimal distance is smaller. But λ has to cover the worst case. So in this case, the worst case is 1/3. But maybe there&#39;s a better arrangement? If we set a₁ and a₂ somewhere else.Alternatively, suppose we set a₁ = a₂ = 1/2. Then, if x₁ and x₂ are both at 0, the minimal distance is 1/2. That&#39;s worse. So definitely, spacing them apart is better.Wait, another thought: for n=2, the minimal λ is 1/3. Let me check with another example. Suppose a₁=1/3, a₂=2/3. Suppose the x₁ and x₂ are as follows: x₁=1/3 - ε, x₂=2/3 + ε. Then |x₁ - a₁| = ε, |x₂ - a₂| = ε. So minimal distance is ε, which can be as small as possible. But the problem states that the minimal of |x_i - a_i| over i must be &lt;= λ. So even if some x_i is very close, but we need that the minimal is at most λ. Wait, but in this case, the minimal distance is ε, which is approaching 0. But the worst case is when the x&#39;s are as far as possible from the a&#39;s. For example, x₁ and x₂ placed exactly midway between a₁ and a₂. Wait, but there is no midway if a₁ and a₂ are at 1/3 and 2/3. Midway would be at 1/2. If x₁ and x₂ are both at 1/2, then |1/2 - 1/3| = 1/6 and |1/2 - 2/3| = 1/6. So minimal distance is 1/6. So in this case, the minimal distance is 1/6. But then, this is better than 1/3. Wait, so maybe the worst case isn&#39;t when x&#39;s are at the ends? Hmm. Then perhaps my initial reasoning was wrong.Wait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum over all possible x sequences of the minimal distance. So the maximum of the minimal distances. So the worst case is when that minimal distance is as large as possible. So we need to arrange a_i such that this maximum is as small as possible.So in the previous example with a₁=1/3 and a₂=2/3, the maximum minimal distance occurs when x₁ and x₂ are at 1/2, giving minimal distance 1/6. Wait, but if x₁=1/3 - λ and x₂=2/3 + λ, then as λ increases, these points move away from the a_i&#39;s. However, since x₁ must be &lt;= x₂, x₁ can&#39;t exceed x₂. Wait, but if x₁ is approaching 1/3 from below and x₂ is approaching 2/3 from above, then the minimal distance for x₁ is approaching 0, and similarly for x₂. So actually, the minimal distance in this case approaches 0. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps the worst case is when all x_i are as far as possible from their corresponding a_i. But given that x_i must be in order, how can they be arranged to be as far as possible?Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the covering problem where you need to place points such that the maximum distance between any point in [0,1] and the nearest a_i is minimized. In that case, the optimal is to place the a_i at (2k - 1)/(2n) for k from 1 to n, which gives a minimal λ of 1/(2n). But in our problem, the x_i are ordered, so maybe the strategy is different.Wait, but in the covering problem, the points can be anywhere, but here, the x_i are ordered. So perhaps the worst case is when the x_i are equally spaced between the a_i? Hmm.Alternatively, think about the problem as a game: an adversary chooses x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ ... ≤xₙ in [0,1], trying to maximize the minimal distance to your a_i&#39;s. You choose the a_i&#39;s to minimize this maximal minimal distance.So, in order to minimize the adversary&#39;s maximal minimal distance, you need to arrange your a_i&#39;s such that no matter how the adversary places their ordered x_i&#39;s, at least one x_i is close to an a_i.This seems similar to the concept of a &quot;Hitting Set&quot; or something like that. But in a continuous setting.Alternatively, maybe consider that the a_i&#39;s divide the interval [0,1] into n+1 subintervals. If we place the a_i&#39;s optimally, the maximum length of these subintervals would be minimized. But in the standard covering problem, this is indeed 1/(n+1), achieved by spacing the a_i&#39;s evenly. But in our case, since the x_i&#39;s are ordered, maybe the problem is different.Wait, for example, if n=2, if we place a₁ and a₂ at 1/3 and 2/3, then the intervals between them are [0,1/3], [1/3,2/3], [2/3,1]. Each of length 1/3. So if the adversary places x₁ and x₂ both in the middle interval, then the minimal distance would be 1/6. But maybe that&#39;s not the worst case.Alternatively, if the adversary places x₁ at 0 and x₂ at 1, then the minimal distance is 1/3 for both. So in that case, λ is 1/3. If the adversary places x₁ and x₂ in the middle, then λ is 1/6. So the maximum over these is 1/3. Wait, but the problem states that for any x&#39;s, the minimal distance is &lt;= λ. So if in some cases it&#39;s 1/3 and in others it&#39;s 1/6, then λ must be at least 1/3. So in that case, 1/3 would be the required λ. But is there a way to make λ smaller?Suppose instead we place a₁ and a₂ at 1/4 and 3/4. Then the intervals are [0,1/4], [1/4,3/4], [3/4,1]. The middle interval is 1/2 long. If the adversary puts x₁ and x₂ in the middle interval, say at 1/2, then the minimal distance is 1/4. If they put x₁=0 and x₂=1, then the minimal distance is 1/4. Wait, |0 - 1/4| = 1/4 and |1 - 3/4| = 1/4. So in this case, λ is 1/4. Wait, but previously, with a₁=1/3 and a₂=2/3, the λ was 1/3. So this seems better. But why?Wait, maybe I need to find a way to place a_i&#39;s such that the maximum distance from any x in [0,1] to the nearest a_i is minimized. But in this case, the standard covering problem gives λ=1/(2n). But here, since the x_i are ordered, maybe the optimal λ is 1/(2n). But when n=1, it&#39;s 1/2, which matches. For n=2, 1/4. But with a₁=1/4 and a₂=3/4, the maximum minimal distance is 1/4. Which is indeed 1/(2*2). So maybe for general n, the minimal λ is 1/(2n). But I need to check.Wait, if n=3, then placing a_i&#39;s at 1/6, 3/6, 5/6. Then the maximum distance would be 1/6, which is 1/(2*3). But let&#39;s see. If the adversary places x₁, x₂, x₃ all at the midpoint between 1/6 and 3/6, which is 2/6=1/3. Then the distances would be |1/3 -1/6|=1/6, |1/3 -3/6|=1/6, |1/3 -5/6|=1/2. Wait, but the minimal distance here is 1/6. Similarly, if they place x&#39;s at the ends, the minimal distance is 1/6. Wait, but if the adversary puts x₁=0, x₂=1/3, x₃=2/3. Then |0 -1/6|=1/6, |1/3 -3/6|=1/6, |2/3 -5/6|=1/6. So all distances are 1/6. So in this case, the minimal distance is 1/6. If the adversary wants to maximize the minimal distance, they can&#39;t get more than 1/6. So maybe this works.But wait, suppose n=2. If we place a₁=1/4 and a₂=3/4, then the maximum minimal distance is 1/4. But if the adversary chooses x₁=1/4 and x₂=3/4, then the minimal distance is 0. So that&#39;s not helpful. But if they choose x&#39;s midway between the a_i&#39;s, like x₁=1/2 and x₂=1/2, but x₂ has to be &gt;=x₁. So x₁=1/2, x₂=1/2. Then |1/2 -1/4|=1/4, |1/2 -3/4|=1/4. So minimal distance is 1/4. If the adversary places x&#39;s at 0 and 1, the minimal distances are 1/4. So in that case, λ=1/4. If we use the 1/(2n) formula, that gives 1/4 for n=2, which matches. For n=1, 1/2. For n=3, 1/6. So maybe the general formula is λ=1/(2n).But let me test for n=3. Suppose a₁=1/6, a₂=3/6, a₃=5/6. Now, if the adversary places x₁, x₂, x₃ all at 1/2. Then |1/2 -1/6|=1/3, |1/2 -3/6|=0, |1/2 -5/6|=1/3. So the minimal distance is 0. But if the adversary wants to maximize the minimal distance, they would place x_i as far as possible from all a_i&#39;s. For example, place x₁, x₂, x₃ at 1/12, 3/12, 5/12. Wait, but those are not ordered in [0,1]. Wait, maybe place them between the a_i&#39;s. The midpoints between a₁ and a₂ is 2/6=1/3, and between a₂ and a₃ is 4/6=2/3. If the adversary places x₁=1/3, x₂=1/3, x₃=2/3. Then |1/3 -1/6|=1/6, |1/3 -3/6|=1/6, |2/3 -5/6|=1/6. So minimal distance is 1/6. Similarly, if they place x&#39;s at the midpoints, they can get minimal distance 1/6. If they place x&#39;s at 0, the minimal distance is 1/6. So λ=1/6 works here. So maybe the formula is indeed λ=1/(2n).But wait, let&#39;s think again. If I use a_i=(2i-1)/(2n), then the maximum distance from any point in [0,1] to the nearest a_i is 1/(2n). But in our problem, the x_i are ordered. Does this ordering constraint affect the maximal minimal distance?Wait, in the standard covering problem, the worst case is a point midway between two a_i&#39;s, giving distance 1/(2n). But in our problem, since x_i&#39;s are ordered, the adversary can&#39;t necessarily place all x_i&#39;s at that midpoint. For example, if n=2, and a₁=1/4, a₂=3/4. The adversary could place x₁ and x₂ at 1/2. Then the minimal distance is 1/4. But if they place x₁ at 0 and x₂ at 1, the minimal distance is 1/4. So in both cases, the maximum minimal distance is 1/4. So for ordered x_i&#39;s, the worst case seems to be the same as the covering problem. Therefore, maybe the minimal λ is 1/(2n). But wait, in that case, for general n, placing the a_i&#39;s at (2i-1)/(2n) would give λ=1/(2n). But let&#39;s check with n=3.If a_i&#39;s are at 1/6, 3/6, 5/6. Then the maximal minimal distance is 1/6. If the adversary places x_i&#39;s at 0, 1/3, 2/3. Then |0 -1/6|=1/6, |1/3 -3/6|=1/6, |2/3 -5/6|=1/6. So the minimal distance is 1/6. If they place x_i&#39;s at midpoints between a_i&#39;s, which are 1/3 and 2/3. But x_i&#39;s have to be ordered. If they place all x_i&#39;s at 1/3, then the minimal distance is 1/6. If they spread them out, they still have to be within 1/6 of some a_i. So seems like 1/(2n) works.But let me consider n=2 again. Suppose we use a_i=(2i-1)/(2n) which would be 1/4 and 3/4. Then, if the adversary places x₁=1/4 - λ and x₂=3/4 + λ. Then |x₁ - a₁|=λ and |x₂ - a₂|=λ. So if λ=1/4, then x₁=0 and x₂=1, which gives distance 1/4. So in this case, the maximum minimal distance is 1/4. If they place x₁ and x₂ in the middle, at 1/2. Then distances are 1/4. So regardless, the maximum is 1/4, which is 1/(2n). So seems to hold.Therefore, perhaps in general, the minimal λ is 1/(2n). But wait, let me check n=3 again. If the a_i&#39;s are at 1/6, 3/6, 5/6. Suppose the adversary places x₁, x₂, x₃ all at 1/2. Then |1/2 -1/6|=1/3, |1/2 -3/6|=0, |1/2 -5/6|=1/3. So the minimal distance is 0, which is fine. If the adversary tries to place x_i&#39;s as far as possible, they might place x₁=1/6 - ε, x₂=3/6 - ε, x₃=5/6 - ε. But since x₁ ≤x₂ ≤x₃, this would require 5/6 - ε &gt;=3/6 - ε &gt;=1/6 - ε. But if ε is positive, x₁ would be less than 1/6, x₂ less than 3/6, x₃ less than 5/6. The minimal distances would be ε for x₁, (3/6 - (3/6 - ε))=ε for x₂, similar for x₃. So the minimal distance is ε, approaching 0. So that&#39;s not the worst case.Wait, maybe the worst case is when the adversary places the x_i&#39;s exactly at the midpoints between a_i&#39;s. For n=3, midpoints between a₁ and a₂ is 2/6=1/3, between a₂ and a₃ is 4/6=2/3. So if the adversary places x₁=1/3, x₂=1/3, x₃=2/3. Then the minimal distances are |1/3 -1/6|=1/6, |1/3 -3/6|=1/6, |2/3 -5/6|=1/6. So minimal distance is 1/6. If they place x₁=1/3, x₂=2/3, x₃=2/3, similar result. So in that case, the minimal distance is 1/6. So the maximum minimal distance is 1/6. So this seems to hold.Alternatively, suppose the adversary places x₁=0, x₂=1/3, x₃=2/3. Then the minimal distances are |0 -1/6|=1/6, |1/3 -3/6|=1/6, |2/3 -5/6|=1/6. Again, 1/6. So regardless of how they place the x_i&#39;s, as long as they are ordered, the minimal distance cannot exceed 1/(2n). Therefore, perhaps the minimal λ is 1/(2n).But wait, let me think again. Suppose n=4. Then a_i&#39;s would be at 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8. Then the midpoints are at 2/8=1/4, 4/8=1/2, 6/8=3/4. If the adversary places x_i&#39;s at these midpoints: x₁=1/4, x₂=1/2, x₃=3/4, x₄=1. Then the minimal distances would be |1/4 -1/8|=1/8, |1/2 -3/8|=1/8, |3/4 -5/8|=1/8, |1 -7/8|=1/8. So the minimal distance is 1/8, which is 1/(2*4). So that works. So again, λ=1/(2n) seems to hold.Therefore, perhaps the answer is λ=1/(2n). But I need to verify this.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of it as an interval covering problem with the a_i&#39;s as centers of intervals of radius λ. The union of these intervals must cover [0,1]. But in our case, the x_i&#39;s are ordered. Wait, but the x_i&#39;s can be anywhere in [0,1] as long as they&#39;re ordered. So even if we cover [0,1] with the intervals around a_i&#39;s, the adversary could choose x_i&#39;s that are all in the same interval. But the minimal distance would then be at most λ. However, the adversary&#39;s goal is to choose x_i&#39;s such that all |x_i -a_i| are as large as possible, but since they have to be ordered, maybe the worst case is when the x_i&#39;s are placed in the gaps between the a_i&#39;s. But if we space the a_i&#39;s evenly at intervals of 1/(n), then the maximum distance from any point to the nearest a_i is 1/(2n). So that would give λ=1/(2n). But in the ordered case, the adversary can&#39;t place all x_i&#39;s in the same gap. Because x_i&#39;s have to be ordered. For example, for n=2, if a₁=1/4 and a₂=3/4, the gaps are [0,1/4], [1/4,3/4], [3/4,1]. The adversary could place x₁ in [0,1/4] and x₂ in [3/4,1], but then x₁ is close to a₁ and x₂ is close to a₂. If they place both x_i&#39;s in the middle gap, then x₁ is at least 0 distance from a₁, but since they are in the middle, the distance is up to 1/4. Wait, but the middle gap is 1/2 in length. If they place x₁ and x₂ in the middle, like x₁=1/2 - ε and x₂=1/2 + ε, then |x₁ -a₁|=1/2 - ε -1/4=1/4 - ε, and |x₂ -a₂|=3/4 - (1/2 + ε)=1/4 - ε. So the minimal distance is 1/4 - ε. As ε approaches 0, the minimal distance approaches 1/4. So the maximum minimal distance here is 1/4. But 1/(2n)=1/4 for n=2. So that works.So in general, if we space the a_i&#39;s at (2i-1)/(2n), then the maximum distance from any point in [0,1] to the nearest a_i is 1/(2n). Since the adversary has to place x_i&#39;s in [0,1], ordered, then each x_i would be within 1/(2n) of some a_i. But since the x_i&#39;s are ordered, maybe they can be arranged such that each x_i is in a different interval. But since the a_i&#39;s are ordered as well, this would mean that each x_i is close to its corresponding a_i. Wait, but the x_i&#39;s don&#39;t have to correspond to the a_i&#39;s in order. For example, x₁ could be close to a₂, and x₂ close to a₁, but since x₁ ≤x₂ and a₁ ≤a₂, this is not possible. Wait, actually, since both the x_i&#39;s and a_i&#39;s are ordered, the minimal distance for x_i would more naturally correspond to a_i.But maybe not necessarily. For example, x₁ could be closest to a₂, but since x₁ &lt;=x₂, and a₁ &lt;=a₂, if x₁ is closest to a₂, then x₂ must be &gt;=x₁, so it&#39;s possible that x₂ is even closer to a₂. But in that case, the minimal distance would be the distance from x₂ to a₂. So perhaps the worst case is when each x_i is as far as possible from a_i, considering the ordering.Alternatively, if we think of the a_i&#39;s dividing the interval into n+1 segments, each of length 1/(n+1). Then, the maximum distance from any a_i would be 1/(2(n+1)). But that&#39;s different. Wait, no. If you have n points, the maximum interval between them is 1/(n+1) if you place them at equal intervals. For example, n=2, intervals of 1/3. But in our previous example, placing a_i&#39;s at 1/4 and 3/4 gives intervals of 1/4, 1/2, 1/4. So the maximum interval is 1/2. Which is worse than equal division. So maybe that&#39;s not the right approach.Wait, going back. The problem requires that for any ordered x_i&#39;s, at least one x_i is within λ of its corresponding a_i. So if we fix the a_i&#39;s, then for any increasing sequence x₁,...,xₙ, there exists some i where |x_i -a_i| &lt;=λ. So it&#39;s not about covering the entire interval, but rather ensuring that in the ordered set of x_i&#39;s, at least one is close to its respective a_i.This seems different from the covering problem. For example, suppose n=2, a₁=0.4, a₂=0.6. Then, if the adversary chooses x₁=0.5, x₂=0.5. Then |0.5 -0.4|=0.1 and |0.5 -0.6|=0.1. So the minimal distance is 0.1. But if λ needs to be the maximum over all such minimal distances, then in this case, λ would be 0.1. But if the adversary chooses x₁=0 and x₂=1, then the minimal distance is max(|0-0.4|, |1-0.6|)=0.4. So λ would have to be at least 0.4. Which is worse than the evenly spaced case. So this suggests that placing a_i&#39;s in the middle of the interval isn&#39;t the optimal.Wait, this is confusing. Earlier, when I thought of placing a_i&#39;s at (2i-1)/(2n), like for n=2 at 1/4 and 3/4, then the maximum minimal distance was 1/4. But in the example above with a₁=0.4, a₂=0.6, the maximum minimal distance is 0.4. So clearly, the placement affects the result. Therefore, the initial thought of placing a_i&#39;s at (2i-1)/(2n) gives a better λ.So perhaps the optimal placement is at positions (2i-1)/(2n), leading to λ=1/(2n). But why in the previous example with a₁=1/4 and a₂=3/4, the maximum minimal distance was 1/4, which is indeed 1/(2n). So that works.But in another example, if I place a_i&#39;s at 1/3 and 2/3 for n=2, then the maximum minimal distance is 1/3, which is worse. So clearly, the placement is crucial.Therefore, the optimal placement is to have the a_i&#39;s at (2i-1)/(2n), spaced evenly with intervals of 1/n between each a_i, and the first a_i at 1/(2n), the next at 3/(2n), etc., up to (2n-1)/(2n). This way, the maximum distance from any point in [0,1] to the nearest a_i is 1/(2n). Therefore, no matter where the adversary places the ordered x_i&#39;s, each x_i is within 1/(2n) of some a_i. Wait, but the x_i&#39;s are ordered. Does this affect the maximum minimal distance?Wait, suppose the adversary wants to place x_i&#39;s such that each x_i is as far as possible from a_i. But since x_i&#39;s are ordered and a_i&#39;s are ordered, the worst case would be when each x_i is just at the midpoint between a_i and a_{i+1}. But in our placement, the midpoints are at i/n for i=1 to n-1. The distance from a_i to the midpoint is 1/(2n). So if the adversary places x_i at the midpoints, then |x_i -a_i|=1/(2n). Therefore, in that case, the minimal distance is 1/(2n). Similarly, placing x_i&#39;s at the ends would also result in distance 1/(2n). So regardless of how the adversary arranges the x_i&#39;s, as long as they are ordered, the minimal distance can&#39;t exceed 1/(2n). Therefore, λ=1/(2n) is achievable.To confirm that this is indeed the minimal possible λ, suppose there exists a placement of a_i&#39;s with λ &lt;1/(2n). Then, the intervals around each a_i of radius λ would not cover the entire interval [0,1]. Specifically, the gaps between consecutive a_i&#39;s would be larger than 2λ. Therefore, the adversary could place x_i&#39;s in these gaps, such that each x_i is in the gap between a_i and a_{i+1}, and thus |x_i -a_i|&gt;λ for all i. This would violate the condition. Therefore, λ must be at least half the distance between consecutive a_i&#39;s. To minimize the maximal λ, the a_i&#39;s should be equally spaced, with spacing 1/n. Therefore, the minimal λ is 1/(2n).Therefore, the answer should be λ=1/(2n).Final AnswerThe smallest real number (lambda) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2n}}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest real number (lambda) such that for any positive integer (n), there exist real numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) in the interval ([0, 1]) such that for any real numbers (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) satisfying (0 leqslant x_1 leqslant x_2 leqslant cdots leqslant x_n leqslant 1), the minimum distance (min_{1 leq i leq n} |x_i - a_i| leqslant lambda), we need to consider the optimal placement of the points (a_i).The key idea is to place the points (a_i) such that the maximum distance from any point in the interval ([0, 1]) to the nearest (a_i) is minimized. This is achieved by placing the points (a_i) at equal intervals. Specifically, the points (a_i) should be placed at positions (frac{2i - 1}{2n}) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, n). This placement ensures that the maximum distance from any point in ([0, 1]) to the nearest (a_i) is (frac{1}{2n}).By spacing the (a_i) points evenly in this manner, the interval ([0, 1]) is divided into (n) equal segments, each of length (frac{1}{n}). The midpoint of each segment is at (frac{2i - 1}{2n}), and the maximum distance from any point in ([0, 1]) to the nearest (a_i) is half the length of these segments, which is (frac{1}{2n}).Thus, the smallest real number (lambda) such that for any ordered sequence (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) in ([0, 1]), the minimum distance (min_{1 leq i leq n} |x_i - a_i| leqslant lambda) is (frac{1}{2n}).[boxed{dfrac{1}{2n}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the smallest real number λ such that for any set of numbers x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ … ≤ xₙ in [0,1], the minimum of |x_i - a_i| for i from 1 to n is less than or equal to λ. And I have to choose the a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ in [0,1] to make this λ as small as possible. Hmm, let me think.First, maybe I should start with small n to get an idea. Let&#39;s take n=1. Then we have a single point a₁ in [0,1], and for any x₁ in [0,1], |x₁ - a₁| ≤ λ. The smallest λ here would be 1/2, achieved by choosing a₁ = 1/2. Because then the maximum distance from 1/2 to either 0 or 1 is 1/2. That seems straightforward.What about n=2? Now, we need two points a₁ and a₂ in [0,1]. For any x₁ ≤ x₂ in [0,1], either |x₁ - a₁| or |x₂ - a₂| must be ≤ λ. To minimize the maximum of these minimums. How should I place a₁ and a₂?If I place them equally spaced, maybe? Let&#39;s say a₁ = 1/3 and a₂ = 2/3. Then the maximum distance from any x in [0,1] to the nearest a_i would be 1/3. Wait, but the problem is not covering the interval [0,1], but rather for any two points x₁ ≤ x₂, at least one of them is within λ of their corresponding a_i. Wait, the correspondence is by index. So x₁ is compared to a₁, x₂ to a₂, etc. So even if x₁ is close to a₂, it doesn&#39;t count unless x₁ is compared to a₁.Wait, right. The minimum is over each |x_i - a_i|, so each x_i is only compared to its own a_i. So the problem is: for any non-decreasing sequence x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ in [0,1], at least one of the |x_i - a_i| is ≤ λ. And we need to choose a_i&#39;s in [0,1] such that this λ is minimized.So for n=2, we need to place a₁ and a₂ such that for any x₁ ≤ x₂, either x₁ is within λ of a₁ or x₂ is within λ of a₂. What&#39;s the optimal placement?If I place a₁ and a₂ such that their intervals [a₁ - λ, a₁ + λ] and [a₂ - λ, a₂ + λ] cover all possible x₁ and x₂. But since x₁ ≤ x₂, maybe overlapping is necessary. Wait, but how?Alternatively, maybe arrange the a_i&#39;s such that the leftmost a₁ covers the left part of the interval, and a₂ covers the right part. But since x₁ can be anywhere from 0 to x₂, and x₂ can be up to 1, maybe the worst case is when x₁ is as far left as possible from a₁ and x₂ as far right as possible from a₂. But in that case, we need to make sure that either x₁ is close to a₁ or x₂ is close to a₂.Wait, perhaps the worst case is when x₁ is as far left as possible from a₁, and x₂ is as far right as possible from a₂. But since x₁ ≤ x₂, if we set a₁ and a₂ in the middle, maybe?Wait, for n=2, let&#39;s suppose a₁ is at λ and a₂ is at 1 - λ. Then, for x₁ ≤ x₂, if x₁ is in [0, 2λ], then |x₁ - a₁| ≤ λ. If x₂ is in [1 - 2λ, 1], then |x₂ - a₂| ≤ λ. But we need to cover all possible x₁ ≤ x₂. So the gap between 2λ and 1 - 2λ must be covered by either x₁ or x₂. Wait, but if x₁ is in [0, 2λ], then x₂ can be anywhere from x₁ to 1. If x₂ is in [1 - 2λ, 1], then even if x₁ is not covered, x₂ is. But if the middle region is from 2λ to 1 - 2λ, then if x₁ is in that middle region, then x₁ ≥ 2λ, so x₂ ≥ x₁ ≥ 2λ. But then x₂ is in [2λ, 1], which might not be covered unless a₂ is such that [a₂ - λ, a₂ + λ] covers [2λ, 1]. If a₂ = 1 - λ, then [a₂ - λ, a₂ + λ] is [1 - 2λ, 1]. So the middle region from 2λ to 1 - 2λ is uncovered. Wait, if x₁ and x₂ are both in that middle region, then |x₁ - a₁| would be x₁ - λ (since a₁ = λ), so x₁ - λ ≥ 2λ - λ = λ. Similarly, |x₂ - a₂| would be (1 - λ) - x₂ ≥ (1 - λ) - (1 - 2λ) = λ. So both distances are at least λ. But the problem requires that the minimum of these distances is ≤ λ. Therefore, in this case, the minimum would be exactly λ, which is okay. Wait, but if x₁ is exactly 2λ and x₂ is exactly 1 - 2λ, then |x₁ - a₁| = |2λ - λ| = λ, and |x₂ - a₂| = |(1 - 2λ) - (1 - λ)| = | -λ | = λ. So the minimum is λ. But if x₁ and x₂ are in between 2λ and 1 - 2λ, then the distances would be greater than λ. For example, suppose λ = 1/4. Then a₁ = 1/4, a₂ = 3/4. The middle region is from 1/2 to 1/2, which is just a point. Wait, no, if λ = 1/4, then 2λ = 1/2, 1 - 2λ = 1/2. So the middle region is empty. Wait, actually, if λ = 1/4, then a₁ = 1/4, a₂ = 3/4. Then for any x₁ ≤ x₂, either x₁ ≤ 1/2, so |x₁ - 1/4| ≤ 1/4 if x₁ is in [0, 1/2], or x₂ ≥ 1/2, so |x₂ - 3/4| ≤ 1/4 if x₂ is in [1/2, 1]. But if x₁ is in [0,1/2] and x₂ is in [1/2,1], then both are covered. However, if x₁ and x₂ are both in [0,1/2], then x₂ is covered by a₁&#39;s interval? Wait, no. For x₂ in [0,1/2], |x₂ - a₂| = |x₂ - 3/4| ≥ 1/4. But x₁ is covered by a₁&#39;s interval [0,1/2], so |x₁ - 1/4| ≤ 1/4, so the minimum would be the distance for x₁, which is ≤ 1/4. Similarly, if x₁ and x₂ are both in [1/2,1], then x₁ is covered by a₂&#39;s interval [1/2,1], since |x₁ - 3/4| ≤ 1/4 if x₁ is in [1/2,1]. Wait, but 1/2 is 1/4 away from 3/4? No, 1/2 is 1/4 away from 3/4: |1/2 - 3/4| = 1/4. So yes, if x₁ is in [1/2,1], then |x₁ - 3/4| ≤ 1/4. So in that case, x₁ is covered. Therefore, in all cases, either x₁ is within 1/4 of a₁ or x₂ is within 1/4 of a₂. Therefore, λ=1/4 works for n=2. But can we do better? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we try λ=1/5. Then a₁=1/5, a₂=4/5. Then the intervals are [0, 2/5] for a₁ and [3/5,1] for a₂. The middle region is (2/5, 3/5). If x₁ and x₂ are in (2/5, 3/5), then |x_i - a_i| would be greater than 1/5. So for example, if x₁=2/5+ε and x₂=3/5-ε, then |x₁ - a₁| = (2/5 + ε) - 1/5 = 1/5 + ε &gt; 1/5, and |x₂ - a₂| = 4/5 - (3/5 - ε) = 1/5 + ε &gt; 1/5. Therefore, the minimum is greater than 1/5, so λ=1/5 is insufficient. Hence, λ=1/4 is the minimal for n=2.Wait, but is there a better arrangement of a₁ and a₂? Suppose a₁ and a₂ are not symmetric. Let&#39;s say a₁ is at λ and a₂ is at something else. Let&#39;s suppose a₁ = λ, a₂ = 1 - λ. Then the intervals [0, 2λ] and [1 - 2λ,1]. To cover all possible x₁ ≤ x₂, the union of these intervals must cover [0,1] in some way. But if 2λ + 2λ ≥1, that is, 4λ ≥1, then λ ≥1/4. So if λ=1/4, then the intervals [0,1/2] and [1/2,1], which just meet at 1/2. So there&#39;s no gap. Therefore, any x₁ ≤ x₂ must have x₁ in [0,1/2] or x₂ in [1/2,1]. If x₁ is in [0,1/2], then |x₁ - a₁| ≤1/4. If x₂ is in [1/2,1], then |x₂ - a₂| ≤1/4. If both x₁ and x₂ are in [1/2,1], then x₁ is within 1/4 of a₂. Similarly, if both are in [0,1/2], then x₂ is within 1/4 of a₁. Wait, but x₂ could be in [0,1/2], so |x₂ - a₁| might be up to |1/2 -1/4|=1/4. Wait, if a₁ is at 1/4, then [0,1/2] is covered. So x₂ in [0,1/2] would be at most 1/4 away from a₁. Similarly, x₁ in [1/2,1] is covered by a₂. So it seems symmetric.So for n=2, λ=1/4 is possible, and you can&#39;t get lower because of the middle point. So maybe for general n, the minimal λ is 1/(2n). Wait, but for n=1, it&#39;s 1/2, n=2, it&#39;s 1/4. Hmm, 1/(2n). Wait, 1/(2n) for n=1 is 1/2, n=2 is 1/4. That seems plausible. Maybe in general, λ=1/(2n). Let me check for n=3.For n=3, if we set a₁=1/6, a₂=3/6, a₃=5/6. Then the intervals would be [0, 2/6], [2/6,4/6], [4/6,1]. Each of length 2/6=1/3. Then the maximum distance is 1/6. Wait, but let&#39;s see. For any x₁ ≤x₂ ≤x₃, we need that at least one x_i is within 1/6 of a_i. If we set a_i = (2i-1)/(2n). For n=3, that would be 1/6, 3/6, 5/6. Then each a_i is centered in an interval of length 1/3. So the maximum distance from any point in the interval to a_i is 1/6. But since the x_i&#39;s are ordered, we need to cover all possible ordered triples. Wait, but maybe overlapping is an issue.Suppose x₁, x₂, x₃ are all in [0,1/3]. Then the a₁ is at 1/6, so |x₁ -1/6| ≤1/6 implies x₁ is in [0,1/3]. Similarly, x₂ and x₃ would be compared to a₂=1/2 and a₃=5/6. But if x₂ and x₃ are in [0,1/3], then their distances to a₂ and a₃ would be larger than 1/6. But since x₁ is within 1/6 of a₁, the minimum is satisfied. Similarly, if all x_i are in [1/3,2/3], then x₂ would be compared to a₂=1/2. The maximum distance from [1/3,2/3] to 1/2 is 1/6. So x₂ is within 1/6 of a₂. Similarly, if all x_i are in [2/3,1], then x₃ is within 1/6 of a₃=5/6. So it seems that in all cases, the minimum distance is ≤1/6. Therefore, for n=3, λ=1/6.So generalizing, for each n, if we set a_i = (2i-1)/(2n), then each a_i is at the center of an interval of length 1/n, and the maximum distance from any point in that interval to a_i is 1/(2n). So for any x in [0,1], x is in one of these intervals, so the corresponding a_i is within 1/(2n). But since the x_i&#39;s are ordered, we need to ensure that for any ordered sequence x₁ ≤x₂ ≤…≤xₙ, each x_i is in the i-th interval. Wait, but if the intervals are [0,1/n], [1/n,2/n], …, [(n-1)/n,1], then x_i must be in the i-th interval. But since the x_i&#39;s are ordered, x₁ is in [0,1/n], x₂ in [1/n,2/n], etc. But this would require that x_i is exactly in the i-th interval. However, the problem states &quot;for any real numbers x_i satisfying 0 ≤x₁ ≤x₂ ≤…≤xₙ ≤1&quot;. So even if someone chooses x_i&#39;s that are not aligned with these intervals, we still need that for at least one i, |x_i -a_i| ≤λ.Wait, but if we set a_i = (2i-1)/(2n), then each a_i is the midpoint of the interval [(i-1)/n, i/n]. So if we have a set of points x₁ ≤x₂ ≤…≤xₙ, each x_i must lie in some interval [(j-1)/n, j/n]. If they are spread out such that each x_i is in a different interval, then each |x_i -a_i| ≤1/(2n). But if multiple x_i&#39;s are in the same interval, then the corresponding a_i might not align. Wait, no, because the x_i&#39;s are ordered. For example, suppose n=3, and someone chooses x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = 1/2. Then, |x₁ -a₁| = |1/2 -1/6| = 1/3, |x₂ -a₂| = |1/2 -3/6|=0, |x₃ -a₃| = |1/2 -5/6|=1/3. So the minimum is 0, which is okay. If someone clusters all x_i&#39;s in the middle interval, then x₂ would be close to a₂. If they cluster all in the first interval, then x₁ is close to a₁. If spread across multiple intervals, then each x_i is in its own interval and close to a_i. So in all cases, the minimal distance is at most 1/(2n). Therefore, λ=1/(2n) is achievable.But is this the minimal possible? Suppose we try to make λ smaller than 1/(2n). Then the intervals around each a_i would be smaller, so there might be gaps between them. For example, with n=2, if λ=1/5, as before, there is a gap in the middle. Similarly, for general n, if we take λ &lt;1/(2n), the total length covered by all intervals would be 2λn &lt;1, so there must be some point in [0,1] not covered by any interval. Therefore, someone could choose all x_i&#39;s to be in that gap, and then all |x_i -a_i| &gt;λ. Hence, λ cannot be smaller than 1/(2n). Therefore, the minimal λ is 1/(2n).Wait, let me verify with n=3. Suppose λ=1/(2*3)=1/6. The intervals around each a_i would be [a_i -1/6, a_i +1/6]. For a₁=1/6, the interval is [0,1/3], for a₂=3/6=1/2, the interval is [1/3,2/3], for a₃=5/6, the interval is [2/3,1]. So these intervals exactly cover [0,1] without gaps. Therefore, any x in [0,1] is in one of the intervals, so for any set x₁ ≤x₂ ≤x₃, each x_i is in one of the intervals, hence at least one of them is within 1/6 of its corresponding a_i. Therefore, λ=1/6 works. If we tried λ=1/(2n) - ε, then the intervals would not cover the entire [0,1], so there would be a gap where all x_i&#39;s could be placed, leading to all |x_i -a_i| &gt;λ. Hence, 1/(2n) is indeed minimal.Therefore, the minimal λ is 1/(2n), achieved by setting a_i=(2i-1)/(2n) for i=1,2,...,n.Final AnswerThe smallest real number (lambda) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2n}}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest real number (lambda) such that for any positive integer (n) and any real numbers (x_1 leq x_2 leq cdots leq x_n) in the interval ([0, 1]), there exist real numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) in ([0, 1]) such that (min_{1 leq i leq n} |x_i - a_i| leq lambda), we need to consider the optimal placement of the points (a_i).1. Understanding the Problem: The goal is to place points (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) in ([0, 1]) such that the maximum distance from any ordered set of points (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) to their corresponding (a_i) is minimized.2. Case Analysis for Small (n):   - For (n = 1), the optimal (lambda) is (frac{1}{2}) by placing (a_1) at the midpoint of ([0, 1]).   - For (n = 2), placing (a_1 = frac{1}{4}) and (a_2 = frac{3}{4}) results in (lambda = frac{1}{4}).3. General Case Analysis:   - For general (n), placing each (a_i) at the midpoint of intervals of length (frac{1}{n}) ensures coverage of the entire interval ([0, 1]). Specifically, setting (a_i = frac{2i - 1}{2n}) places each (a_i) at the center of the interval (left[frac{i-1}{n}, frac{i}{n}right]).4. Verification:   - Each interval (left[frac{i-1}{n}, frac{i}{n}right]) has a midpoint (frac{2i - 1}{2n}) and radius (frac{1}{2n}). This ensures that any point within the interval is at most (frac{1}{2n}) away from the midpoint.   - For any ordered set (x_1 leq x_2 leq cdots leq x_n), each (x_i) must lie within one of these intervals, ensuring (min_{1 leq i leq n} |x_i - a_i| leq frac{1}{2n}).5. Conclusion:   - If (lambda) were smaller than (frac{1}{2n}), the intervals around each (a_i) would not cover the entire ([0, 1]), leading to possible gaps where all (|x_i - a_i| &gt; lambda).Thus, the smallest real number (lambda) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2n}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>The smallest real number lambda is frac{1}{2 n}.(1) lambda can take frac{1}{2 n}.Let a_{i}=frac{2 i-1}{2 n}.Below, we show: For any0 leqslant x_{1} leqslant x_{2} leqslant cdots leqslant x_{n} leqslant 1,there always exists an i such thatbegin{array}{l}left|x_{i}-a_{i}right| leqslant frac{1}{2 n} . text { Let } I_{1}=left[0, frac{1}{n}right], I_{2}=left(frac{1}{n}, frac{2}{n}right], cdots, I_{n}=left(frac{n-1}{n}, 1right] .end{array}Define the function f:{1,2, cdots, n} rightarrow{1,2, cdots, n}: if x_{i} in I_{k_{i}}, then let f(i)=k_{i}.Below, we prove: f(x) has a fixed point, i.e., there exists an i in {1,2, cdots, n} such that f(i)=i.Proof by contradiction.If not, for any i in{1,2, cdots, n}, we have f(i) neq i.Since x_{1} leqslant x_{2} leqslant cdots leqslant x_{n}, it follows thatk_{1} leqslant k_{2} leqslant cdots leqslant k_{n} text {. }And f(i)=k_{i}, by assumption, k_{i} neq i.Then there exists a j leqslant n-1, such thatf(n)=k_{n}=j leqslant n-1 text {. }Thus, for any i in{1,2, cdots, n-1}, we havef(i) leqslant j-1 text {. }This leads to the existence of a t, such thatf(t)=t text { or } f(1) leqslant 0 text {, }which is a contradiction.(2) Show that lambda geqslant frac{1}{2 n}.Proof by contradiction.If not, suppose a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} and lambda^{prime}&lt;frac{1}{2 n} satisfy the requirement.Notice that, the union of n closed intervals centered at a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} with radius lambda^{prime} has a total length of no more than n cdot 2 lambda^{prime}&lt;1.Thus, there must exist a point x^{prime} in[0,1] that does not fall into any of the above closed intervals.Taking x_{1}=x_{2}=cdots=x_{n}=x^{prime}, we reach a contradiction.In conclusion, the smallest real number lambda is frac{1}{2 n}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-2507025c data-v-94f6092c><div class="review" data-v-94f6092c><div class="review-title" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>❓:</span>Given a &gt; 0, functions f(x)=ax^{2}-x, g(x)=ln x.(1) If a=1, find the extreme value of the function y=f(x)-3g(x);(2) Does there exist a real number a such that f(x)geqslant g(ax) holds?

Let me start with the first part. Problem 1: If ( a = 1 ), find the extreme value of the function ( y = f(x) - 3g(x) ).First, let me recall what the functions ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are. Given ( f(x) = ax^2 - x ) and ( g(x) = ln x ). Since ( a = 1 ), then ( f(x) ) becomes ( x^2 - x ). So, substituting into ( y ), we have:( y = x^2 - x - 3ln x )Now, I need to find the extreme value of this function. Extreme values occur where the derivative is zero or undefined, right? So, first, I should compute the derivative of ( y ) with respect to ( x ).Let&#39;s compute ( y&#39; ):The derivative of ( x^2 ) is ( 2x ).The derivative of ( -x ) is ( -1 ).The derivative of ( -3ln x ) is ( -3 times frac{1}{x} = -frac{3}{x} ).So putting it all together:( y&#39; = 2x - 1 - frac{3}{x} )To find critical points, set ( y&#39; = 0 ):( 2x - 1 - frac{3}{x} = 0 )Hmm, let&#39;s solve this equation for ( x ). Since ( x ) is in the domain of the original function, and since ( ln x ) requires ( x &gt; 0 ), we know ( x &gt; 0 ). So, we can multiply both sides by ( x ) to eliminate the denominator:( 2x^2 - x - 3 = 0 )Now, we have a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ). Let&#39;s solve for ( x ):Using the quadratic formula, ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 2 ), ( b = -1 ), ( c = -3 ).So,( x = frac{-(-1) pm sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 times 2 times (-3)}}{2 times 2} )Simplify:( x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 24}}{4} = frac{1 pm sqrt{25}}{4} = frac{1 pm 5}{4} )Thus, two solutions:1. ( x = frac{1 + 5}{4} = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2} )2. ( x = frac{1 - 5}{4} = frac{-4}{4} = -1 )But ( x = -1 ) is not in the domain ( x &gt; 0 ), so we discard that. The only critical point is at ( x = frac{3}{2} ).Now, to confirm whether this critical point is a minimum or maximum, we can use the second derivative test.First, compute the second derivative ( y&#39;&#39; ):The derivative of ( y&#39; = 2x - 1 - 3/x ) is:( y&#39;&#39; = 2 + frac{3}{x^2} )Since ( x &gt; 0 ), ( frac{3}{x^2} ) is always positive, so ( y&#39;&#39; = 2 + text{positive} ), which is always positive. Therefore, the function is concave upward at ( x = frac{3}{2} ), so this critical point is a local minimum.Hence, the extreme value is a minimum at ( x = frac{3}{2} ). To find the value of ( y ) at this point:Compute ( yleft(frac{3}{2}right) ):First, ( x^2 = left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 = frac{9}{4} )Then, ( -x = -frac{3}{2} )Then, ( -3ln x = -3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) )So,( y = frac{9}{4} - frac{3}{2} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) )Simplify the constants:( frac{9}{4} - frac{3}{2} = frac{9}{4} - frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{4} )Thus,( y = frac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) )Alternatively, factoring out the 3:( y = frac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) = 3left(frac{1}{4} - lnleft(frac{3}{2}right)right) )But maybe it&#39;s better to leave it as ( frac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) ). Let me check if this can be simplified more. Alternatively, using logarithm properties:( lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) = ln 3 - ln 2 ), so:( y = frac{3}{4} - 3(ln 3 - ln 2) = frac{3}{4} - 3ln 3 + 3ln 2 )But unless the problem requires a specific form, either expression is acceptable. The question says &quot;find the extreme value&quot;, so probably either form is okay, but maybe the first form is preferable.So, that&#39;s part (1). The extreme value is a minimum at ( x = frac{3}{2} ), and the value is ( frac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) ).Wait, but maybe they want the answer as just the value? So, boxed:( boxed{frac{3}{4} - 3ln frac{3}{2}} )I think that&#39;s part (1). Let me double-check.Wait, let me verify the computation steps again.Starting from ( y = x^2 - x - 3ln x ).First derivative: ( 2x -1 -3/x ), correct.Setting to zero: ( 2x -1 -3/x =0 ), multiplied by x: 2x² -x -3=0. Quadratic equation, correct. Solutions x=(1 ±sqrt(1 +24))/4 = (1 ±5)/4. So x= 3/2 and x=-1. Correct. Disregard x=-1.Second derivative: 2 + 3/x², which is always positive, so concave up. So minimum at x=3/2. Correct.Then, computing y(3/2):(3/2)^2 = 9/4, subtract (3/2), subtract 3 ln(3/2). 9/4 - 3/2 is 9/4 - 6/4 = 3/4. So yes, 3/4 -3 ln(3/2). That seems right.Okay, part (1) seems done.Problem 2: Does there exist a real number ( a ) such that ( f(x) geqslant g(ax) ) holds? If so, find the set of values for ( a ); otherwise, explain the reason.Given that ( a &gt; 0 ), as per the problem statement. Wait, in the problem statement, it&#39;s given that ( a &gt; 0 ). Wait, the original problem says &quot;Given ( a &gt; 0 ), functions ( f(x) = ax² - x ), ( g(x) = ln x ). Then, part (2) asks if there exists a real number ( a ) such that ( f(x) ≥ g(ax) ). Wait, but in the problem statement, it&#39;s mentioned &quot;Given ( a &gt; 0 )&quot;, but part (2) is asking about existence of a real number ( a ). Hmm, maybe the &quot;Given ( a &gt; 0 )&quot; is for both parts, but part (2) is asking if there exists such an ( a ), possibly relaxing the condition? Wait, the original problem says:&quot;Given ( a &gt; 0 ), functions ( f(x) = ax² - x ), ( g(x) = ln x ).(1) If ( a=1 ), find the extreme value of the function ( y = f(x) - 3g(x) );(2) Does there exist a real number ( a ) such that ( f(x) ≥ g(ax) ) holds? If so, find the set of values for ( a ); otherwise, explain the reason.&quot;So, in part (2), the &quot;real number ( a )&quot; might not necessarily be positive? Wait, but ( g(ax) = ln(ax) ), which requires ( ax &gt; 0 ). Since ( g(ax) ) is defined only when ( ax &gt; 0 ). If ( a ) is a real number, then ( ax &gt; 0 ) implies that ( a ) and ( x ) have the same sign. But the original function ( f(x) = ax² - x ). Since ( x² geq 0 ), if ( a ) is allowed to be negative, then the quadratic term could be negative. But the problem statement initially says &quot;Given ( a &gt; 0 )&quot;, but part (2) is asking about existence of a real number ( a ), so perhaps ( a ) can be any real number, not necessarily positive. However, ( g(ax) = ln(ax) ) requires ( ax &gt; 0 ). So, depending on the domain of ( x ), but the original problem didn&#39;t specify a domain for ( x ). However, since ( f(x) ) is defined for all real numbers, but ( g(ax) ) is only defined for ( ax &gt; 0 ). So, for ( f(x) geq g(ax) ) to hold, the inequality must hold for all ( x ) where ( ax &gt; 0 ). Wait, but does the problem require the inequality to hold for all ( x ) or for some ( x )? The problem states &quot;Does there exist a real number ( a ) such that ( f(x) geqslant g(ax) ) holds?&quot;Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. In mathematics, when they say &quot;f(x) ≥ g(ax) holds&quot;, without specifying &quot;for all x&quot; or &quot;there exists x&quot;, usually it&#39;s implied &quot;for all x in the domain&quot;. But the domains of f and g(ax) need to be considered. Since f(x) is defined for all real x, but g(ax) is only defined for ax &gt; 0. So, if a is positive, then ax &gt; 0 when x &gt; 0. If a is negative, then ax &gt; 0 when x &lt; 0. If a = 0, then g(0x) = g(0), but ln(0) is undefined. So, a cannot be zero. So, depending on the sign of a, the domain of x is different.But the question is whether there exists a real number a (so a can be positive or negative) such that f(x) ≥ g(ax) holds. If &quot;holds&quot; is meant for all x in the domain where ax &gt; 0, then we have to ensure that for all x where ax &gt; 0, the inequality f(x) ≥ ln(ax) is true.Alternatively, if the problem is asking if there exists a real number a such that there exists an x where f(x) ≥ g(ax), but that seems trivial because for any a, we can choose x such that ax &gt; 0 and f(x) is large enough. But I think the problem is more likely asking if there exists an a such that f(x) ≥ g(ax) for all x in the domain where ax &gt; 0. That is, for all x such that ax &gt; 0, f(x) ≥ ln(ax). So, the inequality must hold for all x where ax &gt; 0. So, depending on the sign of a, the domain of x is either x &gt; 0 (if a &gt; 0) or x &lt; 0 (if a &lt; 0). However, the original function f(x) = ax² - x. Let&#39;s analyze both cases.First, let&#39;s consider a &gt; 0. Then, ax &gt; 0 implies x &gt; 0. So, the inequality becomes:For all x &gt; 0, ax² - x ≥ ln(ax).Alternatively, if a &lt; 0, then ax &gt; 0 implies x &lt; 0. Then, the inequality becomes:For all x &lt; 0, ax² - x ≥ ln(ax).But ax is positive, so if a is negative, then x must be negative, so ax is positive. However, ax²: since x² is positive, but a is negative, so ax² is negative. Then, ax² - x: x is negative, so -x is positive. So, ax² - x is negative + positive. Depending on the magnitude, but maybe this is possible. Let&#39;s check.But first, let&#39;s check if a can be positive. Let&#39;s suppose a &gt; 0 first, since the original problem mentions a &gt; 0. But part (2) is asking for existence of real number a, so possibly a can be positive or negative. Let&#39;s analyze both cases.Case 1: a &gt; 0Then, the domain is x &gt; 0. The inequality is:( ax^2 - x geq ln(ax) ) for all x &gt; 0.We need to find all a &gt; 0 such that this inequality holds for all x &gt; 0.Alternatively, perhaps rephrase the inequality.Let me define t = ax, but since a &gt; 0 and x &gt; 0, t &gt; 0. Let me see:Let t = ax, so x = t/a. Then, substitute into the inequality:( a(t/a)^2 - (t/a) geq ln t )Simplify:( a(t²/a²) - t/a geq ln t )Which is:( t²/a - t/a geq ln t )Factor out 1/a:( (t² - t)/a geq ln t )Multiply both sides by a (since a &gt; 0, inequality direction remains):( t² - t geq a ln t )So, for all t &gt; 0, the inequality ( t² - t geq a ln t ) must hold.Wait, but t is a substitution for ax, and since x &gt; 0 and a &gt; 0, t can be any positive real number. Therefore, the inequality ( t² - t geq a ln t ) must hold for all t &gt; 0.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a &gt; 0 such that for all t &gt; 0, t² - t ≥ a ln t.Alternatively, for each t &gt; 0, the inequality is equivalent to a ≤ (t² - t)/ln t, when ln t ≠ 0.But ln t can be positive or negative. Let&#39;s analyze.First, note that ln t is defined for t &gt; 0. The expression (t² - t)/ln t.But we need to ensure that t² - t ≥ a ln t for all t &gt; 0. Let&#39;s consider different intervals for t.First, note that t² - t = t(t - 1). So, the left-hand side is a quadratic function in t, which is zero at t = 0 and t = 1, but since t &gt; 0, it&#39;s zero at t = 1. For t &gt; 1, t² - t is positive and increasing. For 0 &lt; t &lt; 1, t² - t is negative.The right-hand side, a ln t: ln t is negative when 0 &lt; t &lt; 1, zero at t = 1, and positive for t &gt; 1. So, we have different cases:1. For t &gt; 1: ln t &gt; 0, so the inequality becomes t² - t ≥ a ln t. Since both sides are positive here, we need this to hold for all t &gt; 1.2. For t = 1: Both sides are zero (t² - t = 0, ln t = 0), so equality holds.3. For 0 &lt; t &lt; 1: ln t &lt; 0, and the left-hand side t² - t is also negative. So, the inequality t² - t ≥ a ln t would be a negative number ≥ another negative number. The question is, for which a does this hold?Let&#39;s analyze each interval.Case 1: t &gt; 1We need t² - t ≥ a ln t. Let&#39;s solve for a:a ≤ (t² - t)/ln t for all t &gt; 1.Thus, the maximum possible a is the infimum of (t² - t)/ln t over t &gt; 1.Similarly, for t approaching 1 from above, (t² - t)/ln t. Let&#39;s compute the limit as t → 1⁺.Let t = 1 + ε, where ε → 0⁺.Compute numerator: (1 + ε)^2 - (1 + ε) = 1 + 2ε + ε² - 1 - ε = ε + ε².Denominator: ln(1 + ε) ≈ ε - ε²/2 + ε³/3 - ...So, (ε + ε²)/(ε - ε²/2 + ...) ≈ (1 + ε)/(1 - ε/2 + ...) ≈ 1 + (3/2)ε + ... as ε → 0.Therefore, the limit as t →1⁺ is 1.Similarly, as t → ∞, let&#39;s see the behavior of (t² - t)/ln t. The numerator is ~ t², denominator ~ ln t. So, the ratio ~ t²/ln t → ∞ as t → ∞. Therefore, for t → ∞, (t² - t)/ln t tends to infinity. Hence, the infimum over t &gt; 1 is the minimal value of (t² - t)/ln t on t &gt; 1. Since as t approaches 1 from above, the ratio approaches 1, and as t increases, the ratio increases to infinity. Therefore, the infimum is 1. Hence, the maximum a that satisfies the inequality for t &gt;1 is a ≤1.Wait, but we need to check if (t² - t)/ln t achieves its minimum at t approaching 1, which is 1. So, to ensure that a ≤ (t² - t)/ln t for all t &gt;1, a must be ≤ the minimal value of that expression on t &gt;1, which is 1. Hence, a ≤1.Case 2: 0 &lt; t &lt;1Here, ln t &lt;0, and t² - t &lt;0. The inequality t² - t ≥ a ln t is equivalent to (t² - t)/ln t ≤ a, since we are dividing both sides by a negative number (ln t), which reverses the inequality. But note that (t² - t) is negative and ln t is negative, so their ratio is positive. Therefore, the inequality becomes:(t² - t)/ln t ≤ aBut since we need this to hold for all t in (0,1), the minimal a must be greater or equal to the supremum of (t² - t)/ln t over t ∈ (0,1).So, let&#39;s find the supremum of (t² - t)/ln t for 0 &lt; t &lt;1.Again, analyze the function h(t) = (t² - t)/ln t for 0 &lt; t &lt;1.First, compute the limit as t approaches 1 from below:As t →1⁻, t =1 - ε, ε→0⁺.Numerator: (1 - ε)^2 - (1 - ε) =1 -2ε + ε² -1 + ε= -ε + ε².Denominator: ln(1 - ε) ≈ -ε - ε²/2 - ε³/3 - ...So, h(t) ≈ (-ε + ε²)/(-ε - ε²/2) ≈ (1 - ε)/(1 + ε/2) ≈1 - (3/2)ε as ε→0. Therefore, the limit as t →1⁻ is 1.As t approaches 0⁺, let&#39;s see:Numerator: t² - t ≈ -t (since t² is negligible compared to t)Denominator: ln t → -inftySo, h(t) ≈ (-t)/(-infty) ≈ 0. So, the limit as t→0⁺ is 0.Therefore, h(t) increases from 0 to 1 as t approaches 1 from below. Wait, but let&#39;s check the behavior in between.Take derivative of h(t) = (t² - t)/ln t for 0 &lt; t &lt;1.Let’s compute h’(t):Using quotient rule:h’(t) = [ (2t -1) ln t - (t² - t)(1/t) ] / (ln t)^2Simplify numerator:(2t -1) ln t - (t² - t)/t = (2t -1) ln t - (t -1)So, h’(t) = [ (2t -1) ln t - t +1 ] / (ln t)^2We need to analyze the sign of the numerator.Let’s denote N(t) = (2t -1) ln t - t +1We need to see if N(t) is positive or negative in (0,1).This seems complicated. Maybe we can check some intermediate points.At t approaching 1⁻, t =1 - ε:N(t) ≈ [2(1 - ε) -1] ln(1 - ε) - (1 - ε) +1= (1 - 2ε)(-ε - ε²/2) -1 + ε +1≈ (1 - 2ε)(-ε) + ε= -ε + 2ε² + ε= ( -ε + ε ) + 2ε² = 2ε² → 0 as ε→0.So, near t=1, the numerator approaches 0.At t=0.5:Compute N(0.5):(2*(0.5) -1) ln 0.5 - 0.5 +1 = (1 -1) ln 0.5 -0.5 +1 = 0 -0.5 +1 = 0.5 &gt;0So, N(0.5)=0.5&gt;0, so h’(0.5) &gt;0.At t approaching 0⁺:N(t) = (2t -1) ln t -t +1. As t→0⁺, ln t → -infty, so (2t -1) ln t ≈ -1*(-infty) = +infty, and -t +1 ≈1, so N(t)→ +infty. Therefore, h’(t) → +infty / ( (ln t)^2 ) which is +infty / +infty, but since numerator grows faster (due to ln t term), it&#39;s positive.But actually, let&#39;s see more carefully:As t→0⁺,(2t -1) ≈ -1,so (2t -1) ln t ≈ -ln t → +infty,and -t +1 ≈1,so N(t) ≈ +infty +1 → +infty. Therefore, N(t) → +infty, so h’(t) = N(t)/(ln t)^2 ≈ +infty / ( (ln t)^2 ). Since (ln t)^2 → +infty as t→0⁺, but N(t) is growing as +infty, but how?Let’s compare the rates:Let’s let t→0⁺, set u = ln t → -infty.Then, N(t) ≈ (-1)u -0 +1 ≈ -u.Thus, N(t) ≈ -u, and (ln t)^2 = u².Therefore, h’(t) ≈ (-u)/u² = -1/u →0⁺ as u→ -infty.Wait, that contradicts the earlier thought. Wait, perhaps my substitution is better.Let t = e^s, where s → -infty as t→0⁺.Then, N(t) = (2e^s -1)s - e^s +1As s→ -infty,2e^s ≈0,so N(t) ≈ (-1)s -0 +1 ≈ -s +1 → +infty,and (ln t)^2 = s².Therefore, h’(t) ≈ (-s)/s² = -1/s →0⁺ as s→ -infty.Therefore, h’(t) approaches 0 from the positive side as t→0⁺.Therefore, h(t) is increasing near t=0 and near t=1, but does it have a maximum somewhere in between?We saw at t=0.5, h’(t)=0.5&gt;0. Wait, but that was the numerator. Wait, no, h’(t) at t=0.5 is [ (2*(0.5)-1) ln 0.5 -0.5 +1 ] / (ln 0.5)^2.Wait, actually, let&#39;s compute h’(0.5):Numerator:(2*0.5 -1) ln 0.5 -0.5 +1 = (1 -1) ln 0.5 -0.5 +1 = 0 -0.5 +1 = 0.5.Denominator: (ln 0.5)^2 ≈ ( -0.6931 )² ≈0.4804.Thus, h’(0.5) ≈ 0.5 /0.4804 ≈1.04 &gt;0. So, derivative is positive at t=0.5.Wait, but if the derivative is positive throughout (0,1), then h(t) is increasing on (0,1). But at t approaching 1, h(t) approaches 1, and as t approaches 0, h(t) approaches 0. But wait, earlier analysis suggested that near t=0, h(t) approaches 0, and h(t) increases to 1 as t approaches 1. But with h’(t) being positive over the entire interval, that would imply h(t) is increasing on (0,1). However, when I computed N(t) at t=0.5, I got N(t)=0.5&gt;0, but let&#39;s check another point, say t=0.25.Compute N(0.25):(2*0.25 -1) ln 0.25 -0.25 +1 = (0.5 -1) ln 0.25 -0.25 +1 = (-0.5)(-1.3863) -0.25 +1 ≈0.6931 -0.25 +1≈1.4431&gt;0So, N(t) &gt;0 at t=0.25, so h’(t) &gt;0 there. Similarly, at t=0.75:N(0.75)= (1.5 -1) ln 0.75 -0.75 +1=0.5*(-0.2877) -0.75 +1≈ -0.1438 -0.75 +1≈0.1062&gt;0Hence, it seems that N(t) &gt;0 for all t ∈(0,1). Therefore, h’(t) &gt;0 for all t ∈(0,1), so h(t) is strictly increasing on (0,1). Therefore, the supremum of h(t) on (0,1) is the limit as t approaches1⁻, which is1, and the infimum is the limit as t approaches0⁺, which is0.Therefore, in the interval 0 &lt; t &lt;1, we have h(t) increasing from 0 to1. Therefore, the inequality (t² -t)/ln t ≤ a for all t ∈(0,1) requires that a ≥1, since the supremum is1.But wait, this is conflicting with the previous case. Wait, in Case 1 (t &gt;1), we needed a ≤1. In Case2 (0 &lt; t &lt;1), we need a ≥1. So, combining both, the only possible a is1.But let&#39;s verify. If a=1, then in the original inequality for all x &gt;0 (since a=1&gt;0), we have f(x)=x² -x ≥ ln(x). Wait, the original inequality with a=1 would be x² -x ≥ ln x for all x &gt;0.But is this true?Wait, let&#39;s test x=1: x² -x =1 -1=0, ln x=0. So equality holds.At x=2: 4 -2=2 vs ln2≈0.693, so 2≥0.693, true.At x approaching0⁺: x² -x ≈-x, which approaches0 from below, and ln x approaches -infty. So, x² -x -ln x approaches +infty, so the inequality holds for x near0.But wait, but x² -x is negative for x ∈(0,1), and ln x is also negative there. So, even though x² -x is negative, perhaps it&#39;s greater than ln x?Wait, let&#39;s pick x=0.5: x² -x=0.25 -0.5=-0.25; ln0.5≈-0.693. So, -0.25 ≥ -0.693. Yes, because -0.25 is greater than -0.693. Similarly, at x=0.1: x² -x=0.01 -0.1=-0.09; ln0.1≈-2.302. So, -0.09 ≥-2.302, which is true.Hence, even though x² -x is negative for x ∈(0,1), it&#39;s greater than ln x (which is more negative). Therefore, the inequality x² -x ≥ ln x holds for all x &gt;0 when a=1.But let me check if there&#39;s any x where x² -x &lt; ln x. For example, x=0.4:x² -x=0.16 -0.4=-0.24; ln0.4≈-0.916. So, -0.24 ≥ -0.916, which is true. How about x=0.9:x² -x=0.81 -0.9=-0.09; ln0.9≈-0.105. So, -0.09 ≥ -0.105. Yes, because -0.09 is greater than -0.105.Wait, interesting. So, at x approaching1 from below, say x=0.99:x² -x=0.9801 -0.99≈-0.0099; ln0.99≈-0.01005. So, -0.0099 ≥-0.01005. Yes, since -0.0099 is slightly greater than -0.01005.So, very close to 1, the left-hand side is slightly greater than the right-hand side.At x=1, both sides are 0. So, the inequality holds as equality.Therefore, if a=1, the inequality holds for all x &gt;0. Hence, a=1 is a possible value.But in our previous analysis for Case1 (t &gt;1), we found that a must be ≤1, and in Case2 (0 &lt; t &lt;1), a must be ≥1. Therefore, the only possible a is1.But wait, let&#39;s check for a=1, the original inequality f(x) ≥g(ax). Here, a=1, so g(ax)=g(x)=ln x. So, the inequality is x² -x ≥ ln x for all x &gt;0, which we saw holds.Now, what if a &gt;1? Let&#39;s test a=2. Then, the inequality becomes 2x² -x ≥ln(2x). Let&#39;s check x=1: 2 -1=1 vs ln2≈0.693, so 1 ≥0.693, true. At x=0.5: 2*(0.25) -0.5=0.5 -0.5=0 vs ln(1)=0. So equality holds. At x approaching0⁺: 2x² -x≈ -x vs ln(2x)=ln2 + lnx≈lnx→-infty. So, -x ≥-infty, which is always true. But for x&gt;0, do we have 2x² -x ≥ln(2x)?Let&#39;s check x=0.4:2*(0.16) -0.4=0.32 -0.4=-0.08; ln(0.8)≈-0.223. So, -0.08 ≥-0.223, true.x=0.6:2*(0.36)-0.6=0.72 -0.6=0.12; ln(1.2)≈0.182. So, 0.12 ≥0.182? No, 0.12 &lt;0.182. Therefore, the inequality fails at x=0.6 when a=2. Therefore, a=2 does not satisfy the inequality for all x&gt;0.Therefore, a cannot be greater than1. Similarly, if a &lt;1, let&#39;s test a=0.5. Then the inequality is0.5x² -x ≥ln(0.5x). Let&#39;s pick x=2:0.5*(4) -2=2 -2=0 vs ln(1)=0. Equality holds. x=3:0.5*9 -3=4.5 -3=1.5 vs ln(1.5)≈0.405, true. x=1:0.5 -1=-0.5 vs ln(0.5)≈-0.693, so -0.5 ≥-0.693, true.But let&#39;s check x=0.5:0.5*(0.25) -0.5=0.125 -0.5=-0.375; ln(0.25)= -1.386, so -0.375 ≥-1.386, true.But check x approaching infinity: 0.5x² -x vs ln(0.5x). The left-hand side is 0.5x² -x which tends to infinity, while the right-hand side is ln(0.5x)=ln0.5 +lnx, which tends to infinity but much slower. Therefore, for large x, the inequality holds.But wait, check if there&#39;s any x where 0.5x² -x &lt; ln(0.5x).Let’s pick x=0.6:0.5*(0.36) -0.6=0.18 -0.6=-0.42; ln(0.3)≈-1.203. So, -0.42 ≥-1.203, true.x=0.8:0.5*(0.64) -0.8=0.32 -0.8=-0.48; ln(0.4)≈-0.916, so -0.48 ≥-0.916, true.x=1.5:0.5*(2.25) -1.5=1.125 -1.5=-0.375; ln(0.75)≈-0.2877. So, -0.375 ≥-0.2877? No, because -0.375 &lt; -0.2877. So, the inequality fails at x=1.5 for a=0.5.Therefore, a=0.5 doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, if a &lt;1, then there exists some x &gt;0 where the inequality fails. Similarly, if a &gt;1, as we saw, the inequality also fails. Therefore, only a=1 works when a &gt;0.But the problem says &quot;real number a&quot;, not necessarily positive. Let&#39;s check if a can be negative.Case 2: a &lt;0Then, ax &gt;0 implies x &lt;0. So, the inequality becomes:For all x &lt;0, ax² -x ≥ ln(ax)But since a &lt;0 and x &lt;0, ax is positive. However, ax²: x² is positive, multiplied by a negative a, so ax² is negative. Then, -x: x is negative, so -x is positive. Therefore, ax² -x is negative + positive.The right-hand side is ln(ax) = ln(a) + ln(x). But x &lt;0 and a &lt;0, so ax is positive, but ln(ax) is defined. However, x &lt;0, but ln(x) is undefined. Wait, no: wait, x is a real number here. Wait, if a is negative and x is negative, then ax is positive. However, the original function f(x) is defined for all real x, but g(ax) = ln(ax) requires ax &gt;0. So, if a is negative, x must be negative. So, the domain here is x &lt;0. But x is negative, so ln(ax) is ln(positive number). But in the left-hand side, f(x) = ax² -x, with a &lt;0 and x &lt;0. So, ax² is negative (since a &lt;0), and -x is positive (since x &lt;0). So, f(x) is a negative term plus a positive term.But the question is whether there exists a real number a such that for all x &lt;0 (since a &lt;0), ax² -x ≥ ln(ax).So, let&#39;s try to analyze this.Let me make substitution similar to before. Let t = ax. Since a &lt;0 and x &lt;0, t = ax &gt;0. So, t &gt;0. Then, x = t/a. Since a &lt;0 and x &lt;0, t/a = x &lt;0 ⇒ t/a &lt;0 ⇒ since t &gt;0, a must be negative, which it is. So, substituting x = t/a into the inequality:a*(t/a)^2 - (t/a) ≥ ln tSimplify:a*(t²/a²) - t/a ≥ ln tWhich is:(t²)/a - t/a ≥ ln tFactor out 1/a:(t² - t)/a ≥ ln tBut since a &lt;0, multiplying both sides by a (negative) reverses the inequality:t² - t ≤ a ln tBut t &gt;0. So, we need t² - t ≤ a ln t for all t &gt;0, where a &lt;0.Wait, this seems complicated. Let&#39;s analyze this inequality:Given a &lt;0, find a such that for all t &gt;0, t² - t ≤ a ln t.But since a &lt;0, and ln t can be positive or negative, depending on t.Let me see:For t &gt;1: ln t &gt;0, so a ln t &lt;0. But t² -t is positive for t &gt;1. So, the inequality t² -t ≤ a ln t would require a positive number ≤ a negative number, which is impossible. Therefore, for a &lt;0, when t &gt;1, the inequality cannot hold because left-hand side is positive, right-hand side is negative. Therefore, there&#39;s no a &lt;0 for which the inequality holds for all x &lt;0 (i.e., for all t &gt;0). Hence, a cannot be negative.Therefore, only a=1 is possible. Hence, the answer is that there exists a real number a, which is a=1.Wait, but the problem asks &quot;Does there exist a real number a such that f(x) ≥ g(ax) holds? If so, find the set of values for a; otherwise, explain the reason.&quot;But from our analysis, only a=1 works. So, the set of values is {1}. But let me verify once more.If a=1, then for all x &gt;0, x² -x ≥ ln x. As we checked with various x, this holds. For x &gt;0, x² -x -ln x ≥0. Let&#39;s consider the function h(x)=x² -x -ln x. We can check its minimum.Compute derivative h’(x)=2x -1 -1/x. Set to zero:2x -1 -1/x=0. Multiply by x:2x² -x -1=0.Solutions: x=(1 ±√(1 +8))/4=(1 ±3)/4. So x=1 or x=-0.5. Disregard x=-0.5. So critical point at x=1.Second derivative h&#39;&#39;(x)=2 +1/x²&gt;0, so minimum at x=1. h(1)=1 -1 -0=0. So the minimum value is0, achieved atx=1. Hence, h(x)≥0 for allx &gt;0. Therefore, x² -x ≥ln x for allx &gt;0. Therefore, when a=1, the inequality holds for allx &gt;0. Therefore, a=1 is valid.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is that the set of values for a is {1}, i.e., a=1.But the problem says &quot;find the set of values for a&quot;, which could be a singleton set. So, yes, there exists a real number a=1, so the set is {1}.Final Answer(1) The extreme value is (boxed{dfrac{3}{4} - 3ln dfrac{3}{2}}).(2) The set of values for (a) is (boxed{1}).&lt;/think&gt;Given (a &gt; 0), functions (f(x) = ax^2 - x) and (g(x) = ln x):1. If (a = 1), find the extreme value of the function (y = f(x) - 3g(x)):   Substituting (a = 1) into (f(x)) and (g(x)), we get:   [   y = x^2 - x - 3ln x   ]   To find the critical points, we compute the first derivative:   [   y&#39; = 2x - 1 - frac{3}{x}   ]   Setting (y&#39; = 0):   [   2x - 1 - frac{3}{x} = 0 implies 2x^2 - x - 3 = 0   ]   Solving the quadratic equation:   [   x = frac{1 pm sqrt{25}}{4} = frac{1 pm 5}{4}   ]   The valid solution for (x &gt; 0) is (x = frac{3}{2}). Using the second derivative test:   [   y&#39;&#39; = 2 + frac{3}{x^2}   ]   Since (y&#39;&#39; &gt; 0) for all (x &gt; 0), the function has a local minimum at (x = frac{3}{2}). Evaluating (y) at this point:   [   yleft(frac{3}{2}right) = left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 - frac{3}{2} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) = frac{9}{4} - frac{3}{2} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) = frac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right)   ]   The extreme value is (boxed{frac{3}{4} - 3ln frac{3}{2}}).2. Determine if there exists a real number (a) such that (f(x) geqslant g(ax)):   We need to check if (ax^2 - x geq ln(ax)) for all (x) in the domain where (ax &gt; 0).    - For (a &gt; 0), the domain is (x &gt; 0). Substituting (t = ax), the inequality becomes:     [     t^2 - t geq a ln t     ]     Analyzing the function (h(t) = frac{t^2 - t}{ln t}) for (t &gt; 0), we find that the minimum value of (h(t)) as (t to 1) is 1. Thus, (a leq 1) for (t &gt; 1) and (a geq 1) for (0 &lt; t &lt; 1). The only value satisfying both conditions is (a = 1).   - For (a &lt; 0), the domain is (x &lt; 0). The inequality (ax^2 - x geq ln(ax)) fails for (t &gt; 1) since the left-hand side is positive and the right-hand side is negative.   Therefore, the only valid value is (a = 1). The set of values for (a) is (boxed{1}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here with two parts. Let me start with part (1). First, given that a=1, I need to find the extreme value of the function y = f(x) - 3g(x). The functions f(x) and g(x) are given as f(x) = ax² - x and g(x) = ln x. Since a=1, f(x) becomes x² - x. And g(x) is ln x, so 3g(x) would be 3 ln x. Therefore, the function y becomes y = x² - x - 3 ln x. To find the extreme value, I need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of y with respect to x and setting it to zero. Let&#39;s compute that derivative. The derivative of x² is 2x, the derivative of -x is -1, and the derivative of -3 ln x is -3*(1/x). So, y&#39; = 2x - 1 - 3/x. Now, set this derivative equal to zero to find critical points: 2x - 1 - 3/x = 0. Hmm, this equation might be a bit tricky. Let me multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator. That gives: 2x² - x - 3 = 0. Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let&#39;s solve it using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is 2x² - x - 3 = 0. The discriminant D is b² - 4ac, where a=2, b=-1, c=-3. So D = (-1)² - 4*2*(-3) = 1 + 24 = 25. Square root of D is 5. Therefore, the solutions are x = [1 ± 5]/4. So, x = (1 + 5)/4 = 6/4 = 3/2, and x = (1 - 5)/4 = -4/4 = -1. But wait, the original function y has a ln x term, which is only defined for x &gt; 0. Therefore, x = -1 is not in the domain, so the only critical point is at x = 3/2. Now, to confirm if this critical point is a minimum or maximum, I can check the second derivative. Let&#39;s compute the second derivative y&#39;&#39;. The first derivative was y&#39; = 2x - 1 - 3/x. So the derivative of 2x is 2, derivative of -1 is 0, and derivative of -3/x is 3/x². Therefore, y&#39;&#39; = 2 + 3/x². Since x² is always positive for x ≠ 0, and we&#39;re considering x = 3/2 which is positive, so y&#39;&#39; is definitely positive here. Hence, the function has a local minimum at x = 3/2. Therefore, the extreme value is a minimum at x = 3/2. To find the value, substitute x = 3/2 into the original function y. Compute y(3/2): First, x² = (3/2)² = 9/4. Then, -x = -3/2. Then, -3 ln x = -3 ln(3/2). So, y = 9/4 - 3/2 - 3 ln(3/2). Convert 3/2 to 6/4, so 9/4 - 6/4 = 3/4. Therefore, y = 3/4 - 3 ln(3/2). We can factor out the 3: 3(1/4 - ln(3/2)). But maybe it&#39;s better to write it as 3/4 - 3 ln(3/2). Alternatively, we can write it as 3(1/4 - ln(3/2)) or 3/4 - 3 ln(3/2). Either way, that&#39;s the value. But the question says &quot;find the extreme value&quot;. Since it&#39;s a minimum, this is the extreme value. So, unless they want it expressed differently, that should be the answer. Let me check the calculations again to be safe. First, derivative: 2x -1 -3/x. Correct. Setting to zero gives 2x² -x -3=0. Solutions x=3/2 and x=-1. Correct. Discarding x=-1. Second derivative is 2 + 3/x², positive. Therefore, minimum. Then substituting x=3/2 into y. Yes, x² is 9/4, subtract x which is 3/2 (so 9/4 - 3/2 = 9/4 - 6/4 = 3/4), subtract 3 ln(3/2). So total y = 3/4 - 3 ln(3/2). That&#39;s the extreme value. Okay, part (1) seems manageable. Now moving to part (2). The question is: Does there exist a real number a such that f(x) ≥ g(ax) holds? If so, find the set of values for a; otherwise, explain the reason. Given that a &gt; 0 (from the problem statement). The functions are f(x) = a x² - x and g(ax) = ln(ax). So the inequality is a x² - x ≥ ln(ax) for all x where ax &gt; 0 (since ln(ax) requires ax &gt; 0). Since a &gt; 0, ax &gt; 0 implies x &gt; 0. Therefore, the domain we are considering is x &gt; 0. So we need to find all real numbers a &gt; 0 such that for all x &gt; 0, a x² - x ≥ ln(ax). Alternatively, the inequality can be rewritten. Let me first write down the inequality:a x² - x ≥ ln(a x) for all x &gt; 0.I can split ln(a x) into ln a + ln x. So the inequality becomes:a x² - x - ln a - ln x ≥ 0 for all x &gt; 0.But perhaps that&#39;s not the most straightforward way. Let me see. Maybe it&#39;s better to fix x and analyze the inequality. But since the inequality must hold for all x &gt; 0, we need to ensure that for all x &gt; 0, a x² - x - ln(ax) ≥ 0. Alternatively, define h(x) = a x² - x - ln(ax). We need h(x) ≥ 0 for all x &gt; 0. So, find the values of a &gt; 0 such that h(x) ≥ 0 for all x &gt; 0. To find such a, maybe we can find the minimum of h(x) and ensure that the minimum is non-negative. So, first, let&#39;s compute the derivative of h(x) to find critical points. h(x) = a x² - x - ln(ax)First, compute h&#39;(x):The derivative of a x² is 2a x, derivative of -x is -1, derivative of -ln(ax) is - (1/(ax)) * a = -1/x. Because d/dx ln(ax) = (1/(ax)) * a = 1/x. Therefore, derivative of -ln(ax) is -1/x. Therefore, h&#39;(x) = 2a x - 1 - 1/x. Set h&#39;(x) = 0:2a x - 1 - 1/x = 0.Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:2a x² - x - 1 = 0.So, 2a x² - x - 1 = 0.This is a quadratic in terms of x. Let me write it as:2a x² - x - 1 = 0.We can solve for x:x = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8a)] / (4a).But since x must be positive, we take the positive root:x = [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)] / (4a).The other root is [1 - sqrt(1 + 8a)] / (4a). Since sqrt(1 + 8a) &gt; sqrt(1) = 1, the numerator would be negative, so x would be negative. Therefore, the only critical point is x = [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)] / (4a). Let&#39;s denote this critical point as x_c. Now, to check whether h(x) has a minimum at x_c, we can check the second derivative. Let&#39;s compute h&#39;&#39;(x):h&#39;(x) = 2a x - 1 - 1/x.Therefore, h&#39;&#39;(x) = 2a + 1/x².Since a &gt; 0 and x &gt; 0, h&#39;&#39;(x) is always positive. Therefore, the function h(x) is convex on its domain, so any critical point is a minimum. Therefore, the critical point x_c is the location of the global minimum. Therefore, to ensure that h(x) ≥ 0 for all x &gt; 0, it suffices to ensure that the minimum value h(x_c) is non-negative. Therefore, compute h(x_c) and set it greater than or equal to zero, then solve for a. But this seems complicated because x_c is expressed in terms of a. Let&#39;s try to compute h(x_c). First, let&#39;s express h(x):h(x) = a x² - x - ln(ax).At x = x_c, which is [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)] / (4a). Let&#39;s denote sqrt(1 + 8a) as s for simplicity. Then, s = sqrt(1 + 8a), and x_c = (1 + s)/(4a). So, h(x_c) = a x_c² - x_c - ln(a x_c).Let me compute each term step by step. First, compute x_c²:x_c = (1 + s)/(4a), so x_c² = (1 + s)^2 / (16a²).Then, a x_c² = a * (1 + 2s + s²)/(16a²) ) = (1 + 2s + s²)/(16a).But s² = 1 + 8a. Therefore:a x_c² = [1 + 2s + (1 + 8a)] / (16a) = [2 + 2s + 8a] / (16a) = [2(1 + s) + 8a]/(16a) = [2(1 + s) + 8a]/(16a).Wait, this seems messy. Maybe a different approach. Let&#39;s recall that at the critical point x_c, h&#39;(x_c) = 0. Therefore, from the derivative equation:2a x_c - 1 - 1/x_c = 0.Therefore, 2a x_c = 1 + 1/x_c.Multiply both sides by x_c:2a x_c² = x_c + 1.Thus, 2a x_c² = x_c + 1. Therefore, a x_c² = (x_c + 1)/2.So, a x_c² is (x_c + 1)/2. Let&#39;s use this in h(x_c):h(x_c) = a x_c² - x_c - ln(a x_c) = (x_c + 1)/2 - x_c - ln(a x_c) = (-x_c + 1)/2 - ln(a x_c).Simplify:h(x_c) = (1 - x_c)/2 - ln(a x_c).Now, need to express ln(a x_c). Since x_c = [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)]/(4a), then a x_c = [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)]/4.Therefore, ln(a x_c) = ln( [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)] / 4 ).Therefore, h(x_c) = (1 - x_c)/2 - ln( [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)] / 4 ).But x_c is [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)]/(4a), so substituting back:h(x_c) = [1 - (1 + sqrt(1 + 8a))/(4a)] / 2 - ln( [1 + sqrt(1 + 8a)] / 4 )This is getting complicated. Maybe we can make a substitution. Let’s let t = sqrt(1 + 8a). Then, t² = 1 + 8a =&gt; a = (t² -1)/8.Then, x_c = (1 + t)/(4a) = (1 + t)/(4*(t² -1)/8) = (1 + t)/( (t² -1)/2 ) = 2(1 + t)/(t² -1).But t² -1 = (t -1)(t +1), so x_c = 2(1 + t)/[(t -1)(t +1)] = 2/(t -1).Therefore, x_c = 2/(t -1).Then, ln(a x_c) = ln( [ (t² -1)/8 ] * [2/(t -1)] ) = ln( [ (t² -1) * 2 / (8(t -1)) ] ) = ln( [ (t +1)(t -1) * 2 / (8(t -1)) ] ) = ln( [ (t +1) * 2 / 8 ] ) = ln( (t +1)/4 ).Therefore, h(x_c) becomes:h(x_c) = (1 - x_c)/2 - ln(a x_c) = [1 - 2/(t -1)] /2 - ln( (t +1)/4 ).Let me compute each term:First term: [1 - 2/(t -1)] / 2Let’s combine the terms in the numerator:1 - 2/(t -1) = [ (t -1) - 2 ] / (t -1 ) = (t -3)/(t -1)Therefore, the first term is (t -3)/[2(t -1)]Second term: - ln( (t +1)/4 ) = - [ ln(t +1) - ln4 ] = -ln(t +1) + ln4Therefore, h(x_c) = (t -3)/[2(t -1)] - ln(t +1) + ln4So, putting it all together:h(x_c) = (t -3)/(2(t -1)) - ln(t +1) + ln4But remember, h(x_c) must be ≥ 0. So, we need:(t -3)/(2(t -1)) - ln(t +1) + ln4 ≥ 0But this substitution might not be helpful. Maybe we can set t = 3? Wait, but t = sqrt(1 + 8a). Let me check for t = 3.If t = 3, then sqrt(1 +8a) =3 =&gt; 1 +8a=9 =&gt; 8a=8 =&gt; a=1. Let&#39;s check if a=1 satisfies the original inequality.But first, let me see what happens when t=3:h(x_c) = (3 -3)/(2(3 -1)) - ln(3 +1) + ln4 = 0 - ln4 + ln4 = 0. So, when a=1, h(x_c) =0.Therefore, when a=1, the minimum value of h(x) is zero. Therefore, the inequality h(x) ≥0 holds for all x&gt;0 when a=1. Therefore, a=1 is a possible value.But is this the only value? Let&#39;s check for a=1, but maybe there are other a&#39;s.Suppose a &gt;1. Let&#39;s pick a=2. Then, compute h(x_c). Let&#39;s compute t = sqrt(1 +8a) = sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17). Then, h(x_c) = (sqrt(17) -3)/(2(sqrt(17)-1)) - ln(sqrt(17)+1) + ln4. Let&#39;s compute this numerically.Compute sqrt(17) ≈4.1231So, (4.1231 -3)/(2*(4.1231 -1)) ≈1.1231/(2*3.1231)≈1.1231/6.2462≈0.18Then, ln(4.1231 +1)=ln(5.1231)≈1.634ln4≈1.386Therefore, h(x_c)≈0.18 -1.634 +1.386≈0.18 -0.248≈-0.068, which is negative. So h(x_c) is negative when a=2, which means the inequality does not hold for all x&gt;0. Hence, a=2 is not valid.Similarly, if a=0.5, then t = sqrt(1 +8*0.5)=sqrt(5)≈2.236Compute h(x_c):(t -3)/(2(t -1)) - ln(t +1) + ln4(2.236 -3)/(2*(2.236 -1))≈(-0.764)/(2*1.236)≈-0.764/2.472≈-0.309Then, ln(t +1)=ln(3.236)≈1.174ln4≈1.386Thus, h(x_c)= -0.309 -1.174 +1.386≈-0.309 -1.174= -1.483 +1.386≈-0.097, which is still negative. Therefore, a=0.5 also gives h(x_c) negative.Wait, but when a=1, h(x_c)=0. Let&#39;s try a slightly higher than 1, say a=1.1.t= sqrt(1+8*1.1)=sqrt(1 +8.8)=sqrt(9.8)≈3.1305h(x_c)= (3.1305 -3)/(2*(3.1305 -1))≈0.1305/(2*2.1305)=0.1305/4.261≈0.0306Then, ln(t +1)=ln(4.1305)≈1.418ln4≈1.386Thus, h(x_c)=0.0306 -1.418 +1.386≈0.0306 -0.032≈-0.0014. Almost zero, but slightly negative. So a=1.1 gives a slightly negative h(x_c). So, h(x_c) is negative here.Similarly, for a=0.9:t= sqrt(1 +8*0.9)=sqrt(8.2)=2.8636h(x_c)= (2.8636 -3)/(2*(2.8636 -1))≈(-0.1364)/(2*1.8636)≈-0.1364/3.727≈-0.0366ln(t +1)=ln(3.8636)≈1.351ln4≈1.386h(x_c)= -0.0366 -1.351 +1.386≈-0.0366 +0.035≈-0.0016, also slightly negative.So, both a=1.1 and a=0.9 give h(x_c)≈-0.001, which is negative. But when a=1, h(x_c)=0. So, it seems that a=1 is the only value where the minimum is zero, and for a&gt;1 or a&lt;1, the minimum becomes negative, which would violate the inequality. Therefore, perhaps a=1 is the only possible value.Wait, but the question says &quot;does there exist a real number a&quot; and &quot;find the set of values for a&quot;. So maybe only a=1 works.But let&#39;s check a different approach. Let&#39;s assume that the inequality holds for all x&gt;0. Then, in particular, as x approaches 0+ and x approaches infinity, the inequality must hold. First, consider x approaching 0+.As x approaches 0 from the right, ax² - x approaches 0 -0 =0 (since ax² goes to 0 and x goes to 0). But ln(ax) approaches ln(0+) which is -infinity. Therefore, the left-hand side (ax² -x) approaches 0, and the right-hand side (ln(ax)) approaches -infty. Therefore, 0 ≥ -infty, which is true. So, near x=0, the inequality holds.As x approaches infinity, ax² - x grows to infinity (since ax² dominates), while ln(ax) grows like ln x, which is much slower. Therefore, ax² -x - ln(ax) tends to infinity, so the inequality holds for large x. Therefore, the problem must be in the intermediate x values, which is why the minimum at x_c is crucial.Since we found that when a=1, the minimum is zero, so the inequality holds. For a≠1, even slightly different, the minimum becomes negative, so the inequality fails. Therefore, only a=1 is the solution.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is that yes, there exists such a real number a, and the set of values is {1}, i.e., a=1.But let me double-check. Suppose a=1, then the inequality is x² -x ≥ ln(x). Wait, no: f(x) = a x² -x = x² -x, and g(ax) = ln(a x) = ln(1*x)=ln x. So the inequality is x² -x ≥ ln x for all x &gt;0. Is this true?Wait, let&#39;s test x=1: 1 -1 -0=0 ≥ ln1=0. So equality holds at x=1. Wait, but earlier, when a=1, we found that the minimum occurs at x=3/2. Let me check x=3/2:Left-hand side: (3/2)^2 -3/2 = 9/4 - 3/2 = 9/4 -6/4=3/4.Right-hand side: ln(3/2)≈0.405.So 3/4≈0.75 ≥0.405, which is true. But according to part (1), when a=1, the extreme value of y = x² -x -3 ln x is 3/4 - 3 ln(3/2). Wait, but in part (2), the inequality is x² -x ≥ ln x, which is different. Wait, I think I made a mistake here.Wait, part (2) is asking about f(x) ≥ g(ax). Given f(x)=a x² -x and g(ax)=ln(ax). So when a=1, the inequality is x² -x ≥ ln(x). So, in part (1) the function considered was different, y = f(x)-3g(x) = x² -x -3 ln x. So, in part (2), the inequality is f(x) ≥ g(ax), which is x² -x ≥ ln x when a=1.But earlier analysis when a=1, h(x)=x² -x - ln x. The minimum of h(x) is at x_c. Wait, but for part (2), the inequality is x² -x ≥ ln x for all x&gt;0. So, when a=1, is this true? Let me check x=1: 0 ≥0. x=2: 4 -2=2 ≥ ln2≈0.693. True. x=1/2: (1/4) -1/2= -1/4 ≥ ln(1/2)= -ln2≈-0.693. So, -1/4≈-0.25 ≥ -0.693. True. Also, at x=3/2, as before: 3/4≈0.75 ≥ ln(3/2)≈0.405. True. The minimal value of h(x)=x² -x -lnx occurs at x where h&#39;(x)=2x -1 -1/x=0.Which is same as in part (1) except without the 3 coefficient. Let&#39;s solve h&#39;(x)=0:2x -1 -1/x=0.Multiply by x: 2x² -x -1=0.Solutions: x=(1±sqrt(1 +8))/4=(1±3)/4.So x=1 or x=-0.5. Disregard negative x. So critical point at x=1.Then, h&#39;&#39;(x)=2 +1/x²&gt;0, so minimum at x=1.Compute h(1)=1 -1 -ln1=0. Therefore, the minimum value is zero. So h(x)=x² -x -lnx ≥0 for all x&gt;0. Hence, when a=1, the inequality holds for all x&gt;0.But in part (1), when a=1, the function considered was y=x² -x -3 lnx, which had a minimum at x=3/2 with value 3/4 -3 ln(3/2). But in part (2), the inequality is x² -x ≥ lnx for all x&gt;0, which is indeed true since the minimum of x² -x -lnx is zero at x=1.Therefore, my initial analysis was correct. When a=1, the inequality holds for all x&gt;0. For other values of a, the minimum becomes negative, so the inequality fails. Therefore, the only possible a is 1.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is that yes, a=1.But wait, earlier when I tried a=1, I considered the function h(x)=a x² -x -ln(ax). When a=1, h(x)=x² -x -lnx. The minimum of this function is zero at x=1, as shown. Therefore, the inequality holds. For other a, as tested, the minimum is negative, so the inequality does not hold. Therefore, only a=1 works.Hence, the answer to part (2) is that the set of values is {1}, i.e., a=1.Therefore, the answers are:(1) The extreme value is 3/4 -3 ln(3/2), which is a minimum.(2) Yes, a=1.Final Answer(1) The extreme value is boxed{dfrac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(dfrac{3}{2}right)}.(2) The set of values for (a) is boxed{1}.&lt;/think&gt;Given (a &gt; 0), functions (f(x) = ax^2 - x) and (g(x) = ln x):1. Extreme Value of (y = f(x) - 3g(x)) when (a = 1):   - When (a = 1), the function (y) becomes (y = x^2 - x - 3ln x).   - To find the critical points, compute the first derivative:     [     y&#39; = 2x - 1 - frac{3}{x}     ]   - Setting (y&#39; = 0) gives the quadratic equation:     [     2x^2 - x - 3 = 0     ]   - Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:     [     x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 24}}{4} = frac{1 pm 5}{4}     ]   - The valid critical point (since (x &gt; 0)) is (x = frac{3}{2}).   - The second derivative (y&#39;&#39; = 2 + frac{3}{x^2}) is positive, indicating a local minimum at (x = frac{3}{2}).   - Substituting (x = frac{3}{2}) into (y):     [     yleft(frac{3}{2}right) = left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 - frac{3}{2} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) = frac{9}{4} - frac{3}{2} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) = frac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(frac{3}{2}right)     ]   - The extreme value is (boxed{dfrac{3}{4} - 3lnleft(dfrac{3}{2}right)}).2. Existence of (a) such that (f(x) geqslant g(ax)):   - The inequality (ax^2 - x geq ln(ax)) must hold for all (x &gt; 0).   - Define (h(x) = ax^2 - x - ln(ax)). We need (h(x) geq 0) for all (x &gt; 0).   - Compute the first derivative:     [     h&#39;(x) = 2ax - 1 - frac{1}{x}     ]   - Setting (h&#39;(x) = 0) gives:     [     2ax^2 - x - 1 = 0     ]   - Solving for (x), the valid critical point is (x = frac{1 + sqrt{1 + 8a}}{4a}).   - The second derivative (h&#39;&#39;(x) = 2a + frac{1}{x^2}) is positive, indicating a local minimum.   - Evaluating (h(x)) at the critical point, we find that when (a = 1), the minimum value of (h(x)) is zero, confirming (x^2 - x geq ln x) for all (x &gt; 0).   - For other values of (a), the minimum value of (h(x)) is negative, thus the inequality fails.   - Therefore, the set of values for (a) is (boxed{1}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>(1) When a=1, y=f(x)-3g(x)=x^{2}-x-3ln x,The derivative y′=2x-1- frac{3}{x}= frac{(x+1)(2x-3)}{x},Since x &gt; 0, y′  0 when x &gt; frac{3}{2},Therefore, the function y=f(x)-3g(x) reaches its minimum value at x= frac{3}{2}, which is f( frac{3}{2})-3g( frac{3}{2})= frac{9}{4}- frac{3}{2}-3ln frac{3}{2}= frac{3}{4}-3ln frac{3}{2},The function y=f(x)-3g(x) has no maximum value;(2) Assume that f(x)geqslant g(ax) holds.Let h(x)=f(x)-g(ax)=ax^{2}-x-ln (ax), i.e., h(x)_{min}geqslant 0,Then h′(x)=2ax-1- frac{1}{x}= frac{2ax^{2}-x-1}{x},Let p(x)=2ax^{2}-x-1, triangle =1+8a &gt; 0,So p(x)=0 has two distinct roots x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{1} x_{2}=- frac{1}{2a}, without loss of generality, assume x_{1} &lt; 0 &lt; x_{2},Then h(x) is decreasing on (0,x_{2}), and increasing on (x_{2},+infty),So h(x_{2})=ax_{2}^{2}-x_{2}-ln (ax_{2})geqslant 0 holds,Since p(x_{2})=2ax_{2}^{2}-x_{2}-1=0,Then ax_{2}= frac{1+x_{2}}{2x_{2}},So h(x_{2})= frac{1-x_{2}}{2}-ln frac{1+x_{2}}{2x_{2}}geqslant 0,Let k(x)= frac{1-x}{2}-ln frac{1+x}{2x}= frac{1-x}{2}+ln 2x-ln (1+x),k′(x)=- frac{1}{2}+ frac{1}{x}- frac{1}{x+1}=- frac{(x-1)(x+2)}{2x(x+1)},So k(x) is increasing on (0,1), and decreasing on (1,+infty),So k(x_{2})leqslant k(1)=0, and h(x_{2})= frac{1-x_{2}}{2}-ln frac{1+x_{2}}{2x_{2}}geqslant 0,So x_{2}=1 and substitute into ax_{2}= frac{1+x_{2}}{2x_{2}}, we get a=1,Hence, ain{1}.Therefore, the set of real numbers a such that f(x)geqslant g(ax) holds is boxed{{1}}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-2507025c><span data-v-2507025c>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
