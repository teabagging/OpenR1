A, B, C three people went to Teacher D&#39;s house to play. Teacher D gave each of them a hat and wrote a four-digit number on each hat. It is known that these three four-digit numbers are all perfect squares (for example, 4=2^{2}, 100=10^{2}, 4.100 are all squares of some number, such numbers are called perfect squares), and the tens digit of these three four-digit numbers is 0, and the units digit is not 0. Each child can only see the numbers on others&#39; hats. These three children are very smart and honest, and the following conversation took place:A said: “The units digit of the numbers on B and C&#39;s hats are the same.”B and C said at the same time: “After hearing what A said, I know my number.”A said: “After hearing what B and C said, I also know my number, and the units digit of my number is an even number.”Find: The sum of the numbers on A, B, C&#39;s hats.</div><div class="divider" data-v-43575fad></div><p class="review-content" data-v-43575fad><span class="icon" data-v-43575fad>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have three people, A, B, and C, each wearing a four-digit perfect square number on their hats. The numbers have a tens digit of 0 and a units digit that&#39;s not 0. Each person can see the others&#39; numbers but not their own. There&#39;s a conversation where A first says that B and C have the same units digit. Then B and C both say they now know their numbers. Finally, A says that after hearing B and C, he also knows his number, and the units digit is even. We need to find the sum of all three numbers.First, let&#39;s break down the constraints:1. All three numbers are four-digit perfect squares.2. Each number has a tens digit of 0 and a units digit not equal to 0. So the numbers must be of the form XY0Z where X and Y are digits, the tens place is 0, and Z is a non-zero digit. But since they are four-digit numbers, the thousands digit can&#39;t be 0. So, the structure is [1-9][0-9]0[1-9].Since they are perfect squares, let&#39;s think about four-digit squares. The four-digit numbers range from 1000 to 9999. The square roots of these numbers are from 32 (since 32²=1024) up to 99 (since 99²=9801). But we need squares where the tens digit is 0. So, the number must end with 0 in the tens place and some non-zero digit in the units place. Let me list all four-digit perfect squares that end with a non-zero digit and have 0 in the tens place. So, numbers like x0y where y is 1, 4, 5, 6, 9? Wait, since the units digit of a square can only be 0,1,4,5,6,9. But since the units digit can&#39;t be 0 (as per the problem), possible units digits are 1,4,5,6,9. Also, the tens digit must be 0. So numbers ending with 01, 04, 05, 06, 09. Hmm.Wait, so let&#39;s consider numbers of the form AB0C where C is 1,4,5,6,9. Let&#39;s find all four-digit squares that fit this pattern.First, let&#39;s note that the square numbers ending with 0 must have the last two digits as 00. But in this case, the tens digit is 0, but the units digit is not 0, so the last two digits are 0C where C is non-zero. But if a square ends with 0C, then the square root must end with a digit that when squared gives C in the units place. But since the tens digit is 0, maybe the square is such that when you square a number ending with, say, 1 or 9, you get something ending with 01 or 81? Wait, 1²=1, 9²=81, 11²=121, etc. Wait, but the tens digit here is 2 in 121. Hmm, maybe this approach isn&#39;t straightforward.Wait, actually, let&#39;s think about the square numbers. The last two digits of a square number can only be certain combinations. Since the tens digit here is 0, the last two digits must be 0 followed by a non-zero digit. So possible candidates are numbers ending with 01, 04, 05, 06, 09? Let&#39;s check which of these are possible for square numbers.Looking up the possible last two digits of square numbers: a square number can end with 00, 01, 04, 09, 16, 21, 24, 25, 29, 36, 41, 44, 49, 56, 61, 64, 69, 76, 81, 84, 89, 96. So the ones ending with 0 followed by a non-zero digit would be 00 (but units digit is 0 here, which is not allowed), 01, 04, 05 isn&#39;t in the list, 06 isn&#39;t, 09. Wait, from the list, the possible last two digits with tens digit 0 are 00, 01, 04, 09. But since the units digit can&#39;t be 0, only 01, 04, 09. Wait, but 25 is in the list, but that&#39;s 2 and 5. Hmm, so maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, perhaps the tens digit is 0, but the units digit is non-zero. So, the square number ends with 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81. Wait, but the tens digit must be 0. So, actually, the last two digits of the number must be 0 followed by a non-zero digit, but how can that be? For example, 01, 04, 09. Wait, but 01 is possible, like 11²=121, but 121 is a three-digit number. For four-digit numbers, 101²=10201, which is five digits. Hmm. Wait, maybe this is impossible? Wait, but the problem states that such numbers exist, so maybe I need to check again.Wait, perhaps the tens digit is 0, but the hundreds digit can be non-zero. For example, a four-digit number like 1001? Wait, 1001 is not a perfect square. Let me check some squares:32² = 1024: last two digits 24. Not 0 in tens.33² = 1089: last two digits 89.34² = 1156: 56.35² = 1225: 25.36² = 1296: 96.37² = 1369: 69.38² = 1444: 44.39² = 1521: 21.40² = 1600: 00. Units digit 0, which is invalid.41² = 1681: 81.42² = 1764: 64.43² = 1849: 49.44² = 1936: 36.45² = 2025: 25.46² = 2116: 16.47² = 2209: 09.48² = 2304: 04.49² = 2401: 01.50² = 2500: 00. Invalid.51² = 2601: 01.52² = 2704: 04.53² = 2809: 09.54² = 2916: 16.55² = 3025: 25.56² = 3136: 36.57² = 3249: 49.58² = 3364: 64.59² = 3481: 81.60² = 3600: 00. Invalid.61² = 3721: 21.62² = 3844: 44.63² = 3969: 69.64² = 4096: 96.65² = 4225: 25.66² = 4356: 56.67² = 4489: 89.68² = 4624: 24.69² = 4761: 61.70² = 4900: 00. Invalid.71² = 5041: 41.72² = 5184: 84.73² = 5329: 29.74² = 5476: 76.75² = 5625: 25.76² = 5776: 76.77² = 5929: 29.78² = 6084: 84.79² = 6241: 41.80² = 6400: 00. Invalid.81² = 6561: 61.82² = 6724: 24.83² = 6889: 89.84² = 7056: 56.85² = 7225: 25.86² = 7396: 96.87² = 7569: 69.88² = 7744: 44.89² = 7921: 21.90² = 8100: 00. Invalid.91² = 8281: 81.92² = 8464: 64.93² = 8649: 69.94² = 8836: 36.95² = 9025: 25.96² = 9216: 16.97² = 9409: 09.98² = 9604: 04.99² = 9801: 01.Looking through these, the four-digit perfect squares with tens digit 0 and units digit not 0 are those ending with 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81. Wait, but wait, the tens digit is 0. Wait, in the above list, for example, 49²=2401, which ends with 01. So here, the tens digit is 0, units digit is 1. Similarly, 48²=2304 ends with 04 (tens digit 0, units digit 4). 47²=2209 ends with 09 (tens 0, units 9). 53²=2809 ends with 09. 51²=2601 ends with 01. 57²=3249 ends with 49 (tens 4, units 9) so that&#39;s not. Wait, hold on, we need the tens digit to be 0, so only numbers ending with 01, 04, 09. Let&#39;s check:Looking at all squares from 32² to 99²:Ending with 01:49² = 240151² = 260199² = 980173²=5329? No, 5329 ends with 29. Wait, 2401, 2601, 9801. Also, 101²=10201, but that&#39;s five digits.Ending with 04:48²=230452²=270498²=9604Ending with 09:47²=220953²=280997²=9409So these are the four-digit squares with tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero. So the possible numbers are:Ending with 01: 2401, 2601, 9801Ending with 04: 2304, 2704, 9604Ending with 09: 2209, 2809, 9409So the possible numbers are these nine. Each of A, B, C has one of these numbers. Now, the conversation happens as follows:1. A says that B and C have the same units digit. Since A can see B and C&#39;s numbers, he can see their units digits and notices they are the same. So B and C&#39;s numbers must both end with 1, 4, or 9.But wait, the possible units digits are 1, 4, 9 (from the numbers above). So A&#39;s statement tells us that B and C&#39;s units digits are the same. So, for example, if B ends with 1 and C ends with 1, or both end with 4, or both end with 9.2. Then B and C both say that after hearing A, they know their numbers. So based on A&#39;s statement and seeing the other person&#39;s number, each can deduce their own number.3. Then A says that after hearing B and C, he also knows his number, and his number&#39;s units digit is even. Since possible even units digits in the possible numbers are 4 (from 2304, 2704, 9604). The others end with 1 or 9, which are odd.So, the final answer must be a sum where A&#39;s number ends with 4, and B and C&#39;s numbers have the same units digit (either both 1, both 4, or both 9). But B and C, after hearing that their units digits are the same, can figure out their own numbers. So, let&#39;s try to figure out what B and C could have.First, let&#39;s think about the possible numbers again. Let&#39;s list all the numbers:Ending with 01: 2401, 2601, 9801Ending with 04: 2304, 2704, 9604Ending with 09: 2209, 2809, 9409Each person has one of these numbers. Let&#39;s consider the perspective of B. B can see A and C&#39;s numbers. After A says that B and C have the same units digit, B knows that C&#39;s number has the same units digit as his own. So, since B can see C&#39;s number, he knows what the units digit of his own number is. Wait, but if B sees C&#39;s number, and A says that their units digits are the same, then B knows his own units digit must be the same as C&#39;s. But B can see C&#39;s number, so he immediately knows his own units digit. But how does that help him know his own number?Wait, maybe the idea is that if B&#39;s number must end with the same digit as C&#39;s, which B can see. So if B sees that C&#39;s number ends with, say, 1, then B knows his own number must also end with 1, so his number is one of 2401, 2601, 9801. But how can B deduce exactly which one it is? Perhaps by considering the possible numbers that he could have, given what he sees on A&#39;s head.Wait, for example, suppose B sees that A&#39;s number is, say, 2304 (ending with 4) and C&#39;s number is 2401 (ending with 1). Then A says that B and C have the same units digit. But C&#39;s number ends with 1, so B knows his own number must end with 1. But B also sees A&#39;s number. So B can consider: &quot;My number must end with 1, and given that A&#39;s number is 2304, which is one of the possible numbers, what could my number be?&quot; But unless there&#39;s only one possible number ending with 1 that is compatible with A&#39;s number, B can&#39;t be sure. So perhaps the key is that after hearing A&#39;s statement, B and C can each eliminate possibilities based on seeing the other&#39;s number.Wait, let&#39;s think through an example. Suppose B sees that C&#39;s number is 2401 (ending with 1) and A&#39;s number is, say, 2304. Then B knows his number must end with 1. The possible numbers ending with 1 are 2401, 2601, 9801. But B can see A&#39;s number is 2304, so B knows that 2304 is taken by A, so his own number can&#39;t be 2304. But his possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. But how does he know which one he has? Unless there is some uniqueness.Alternatively, maybe if seeing the other person&#39;s number allows B to deduce his own number because there&#39;s only one possible number with that units digit that isn&#39;t already taken by A or C. But since all three numbers are different (presumably), B can eliminate the numbers he sees on A and C, but since the numbers must be distinct, if there&#39;s only one remaining number with the required units digit, then he can know.But in the problem, it&#39;s not stated that the numbers are distinct. Wait, but in most such puzzles, the numbers are distinct unless stated otherwise, but maybe here they could be the same? Hmm, the problem says &quot;three four-digit numbers,&quot; but doesn&#39;t specify they are distinct. However, since they are given to three different people, it&#39;s possible that the numbers are distinct, but maybe not. However, given that all three are very smart and honest, and the conversation happens, likely the numbers are distinct. So let&#39;s assume they are distinct.So, suppose B sees A&#39;s number and C&#39;s number, and after knowing that his own number must have the same units digit as C&#39;s, he can figure out his own number. So, for example, if C&#39;s number is 2401 (ending with 1) and A&#39;s number is 2304 (ending with 4), then B&#39;s number must end with 1, so possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. But since C is already 2401, B&#39;s number can&#39;t be 2401 (if numbers are distinct), so it must be 2601 or 9801. But then B wouldn&#39;t know for sure. Therefore, this scenario doesn&#39;t allow B to know his number. Therefore, perhaps in the actual case, there&#39;s a unique number possible for B after considering the numbers on A and C.So, maybe the key is that when B looks at C&#39;s number, and hears that his own number has the same units digit, and given the numbers already present (A&#39;s number), there is only one possible number left. Let&#39;s try to see.Let&#39;s list all possible numbers again:Ending with 01: 2401, 2601, 9801Ending with 04: 2304, 2704, 9604Ending with 09: 2209, 2809, 9409So, total 9 numbers.Assuming that all three numbers are distinct, then each of A, B, C has a unique number from this list.Now, let&#39;s suppose that A&#39;s number is one of the numbers ending with 4 (since in the end, A says his units digit is even, which is 4). So A&#39;s number is either 2304, 2704, or 9604.But first, let&#39;s consider the first statement: A says that B and C have the same units digit. Therefore, B and C&#39;s numbers both end with 1, both end with 4, or both end with 9.But B and C, upon hearing this, can figure out their own numbers. Let&#39;s consider how.Take B&#39;s perspective: B sees A&#39;s number and C&#39;s number. A&#39;s number is, say, one of the numbers ending with 4, 1, or 9. Wait, but actually, A&#39;s number could be any of the nine numbers, right? But in the final statement, A says his units digit is even, so it must be 4. So A&#39;s number is 2304, 2704, or 9604.But before that, B and C deduce their numbers based on A&#39;s first statement.So, let&#39;s think of it step by step.First, all three know the list of possible numbers (the nine numbers above). A sees B and C&#39;s numbers and notices that their units digits are the same.Then B and C, knowing that their units digits are the same (from A&#39;s statement), can deduce their own numbers. How?Let&#39;s take B&#39;s perspective. B knows that his number must end with the same digit as C&#39;s. Since B can see C&#39;s number, he knows what digit that is. So, for example, if C&#39;s number ends with 1, B knows his own number must end with 1. Then, given that he can see A&#39;s number, he can figure out which number he has by eliminating the ones already seen.But if there are multiple possibilities, he can&#39;t be sure. So for B to know his number uniquely, there must be only one possible number left that ends with the same digit as C&#39;s and isn&#39;t A&#39;s number or C&#39;s number.Similarly for C.Therefore, the key is that for each pair of units digits (1,4,9), the set of numbers with that units digit must be such that, given two numbers (A and the other person), there&#39;s only one possible number left for the third person.Alternatively, maybe each units digit group has a unique number that can be determined if you know the other two numbers.Wait, but there are three numbers in each group (for 1,4,9). So unless some numbers are excluded based on what&#39;s visible.Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are such that when you know the other two numbers, you can deduce your own. Let&#39;s consider an example.Suppose B sees that A has 2304 (ending with 4) and C has 2401 (ending with 1). Then A says that B and C have the same units digit. But C&#39;s number ends with 1, so B&#39;s number must also end with 1. However, the possible numbers ending with 1 are 2401, 2601, 9801. Since C is already 2401, B&#39;s number must be 2601 or 9801. But B can&#39;t know which one, so he can&#39;t determine his number. Therefore, this scenario doesn&#39;t work.But in the problem, B and C both figure out their numbers after A&#39;s statement. Therefore, the actual configuration must be such that when B sees C&#39;s number and A&#39;s number, and knowing that his own number has the same units digit as C&#39;s, he can uniquely determine his number. Similarly for C.Therefore, let&#39;s look for numbers where, for each possible pair (A and C for B&#39;s case), there&#39;s only one possible number left for B.Let me try to find such triplets.Case 1: B and C&#39;s numbers both end with 1.Possible numbers: 2401, 2601, 9801.If A&#39;s number is, say, 2304 (ending with 4). Then B sees A&#39;s 2304 and C&#39;s, say, 2401. Then B knows his own number must end with 1. The remaining numbers ending with 1 are 2601 and 9801 (since 2401 is taken by C). But B can&#39;t know which one. So this doesn&#39;t work.But if A&#39;s number is, say, 9604, and C&#39;s number is 2401. Then B sees A=9604 and C=2401. Then B&#39;s number must end with 1. The possible numbers are 2401 (taken by C), 2601, 9801. So again two options. Doesn&#39;t help.Wait, maybe if A&#39;s number is one that, when combined with C&#39;s number, leaves only one possible number for B.Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304 (ending with 4) and C&#39;s number is 9801 (ending with 1). Then B knows his number must end with 1. The available numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. But 9801 is taken by C, so B&#39;s number is either 2401 or 2601. If B sees that A is 2304, then 2401 is 2401, which is different from 2304. But how does he know if it&#39;s 2401 or 2601?Wait, maybe if the hundreds digit is determined by some other factor.Alternatively, maybe the key is that if B&#39;s number has to be such that when C looks at A&#39;s number, C can also deduce his own number. So the pair (A&#39;s number, B&#39;s number) must also allow C to deduce his number uniquely.This seems complicated. Maybe we need to look for numbers where for each units digit group (1,4,9), the numbers in that group have unique hundreds digits or something.Looking at the numbers:Ending with 01: 2401 (hundreds digit 4), 2601 (6), 9801 (8)Ending with 04: 2304 (3), 2704 (7), 9604 (6)Ending with 09: 2209 (2), 2809 (8), 9409 (4)So, for example, if someone has a number ending with 01, the hundreds digit is 4,6,8. For ending with 04: 3,7,6. Ending with 09: 2,8,4.If B sees that A&#39;s number has a hundreds digit of, say, 3 (2304), and C&#39;s number ends with 01, which has hundreds digit 4,6,8. Then if B knows his own number ends with 1, and sees that A&#39;s hundreds digit is 3, but how does that help?Alternatively, maybe the uniqueness comes from the thousands digit? Let&#39;s check the thousands digits:Ending with 01:2401: thousands digit 22601: 29801: 9Ending with 04:2304: 22704: 29604: 9Ending with 09:2209: 22809: 29409: 9So, the thousands digits for numbers ending with 01,04,09 are either 2 or 9. Except for 9801, 9604, 9409, which have thousands digit 9.So if someone sees a number with thousands digit 9, they know it&#39;s one of those three. If they see thousands digit 2, it&#39;s one of the others.But not sure if that helps.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. If B sees that A&#39;s number is, say, 2304 (ending with 04) and C&#39;s number is 2401 (ending with 01). Then B knows his own number must end with 01. The possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. But since C is 2401, B&#39;s number is either 2601 or 9801. If B can see A&#39;s number is 2304, he might think: &quot;If my number were 2601, then the thousands digit is 2, same as A&#39;s 2304. But A&#39;s number is 2304, which is also thousands digit 2. However, since the numbers are distinct, maybe 2601 is possible. 9801 has thousands digit 9, which is different. But how does B know which one he has?&quot;Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way. Suppose that for B to determine his number uniquely, the units digit group must have only one number that hasn&#39;t been ruled out by A&#39;s number.For example, suppose A&#39;s number is 2304 (ending with 04) and C&#39;s number is 9801 (ending with 01). Then B knows his number must end with 01. The possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. But 9801 is taken by C, so B&#39;s number is either 2401 or 2601. However, if B&#39;s number were 2401, then the thousands digit is 2, which is same as A&#39;s 2304. But is there a reason why B can eliminate 2401? Not unless there&#39;s a duplicate thousands digit, but the problem doesn&#39;t state that thousands digits must be unique.Alternatively, if B&#39;s number is 2401, then A&#39;s number is 2304. Both start with 2, but maybe that&#39;s allowed. So B still can&#39;t determine. Therefore, this case doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, let&#39;s suppose that B and C&#39;s numbers both end with 4. So units digit 4. The possible numbers are 2304, 2704, 9604. But A&#39;s statement says B and C have the same units digit, so if B and C both end with 4, then A&#39;s number must end with either 1 or 9.But in the end, A&#39;s number must end with 4. So this case is impossible because A later says his units digit is even (4), so A&#39;s number is in the 04 group. Therefore, in this case, if B and C also had numbers ending with 4, then all three numbers would end with 4, but A&#39;s number ends with 4, which is even. However, the problem states that the units digit of these numbers is not 0, but they can be 4. However, in this case, if B and C both had numbers ending with 4, then A, seeing that, would have said their units digits are same (both 4), then B and C, knowing their own units digits are 4, would look at A&#39;s number (which is also ending with 4), and try to deduce their own numbers. But since all three numbers are from the 04 group, but there are three numbers in that group (2304, 2704, 9604), but there are three people, so each could have one. But if B sees A&#39;s number (say 2304) and C&#39;s number (say 2704), then B knows his number must end with 4. The remaining number is 9604. So B can deduce his number is 9604. Similarly, C, seeing A&#39;s 2304 and B&#39;s 9604, can deduce his own number is 2704. But in this case, B and C could figure out their numbers. Then A, knowing that B and C figured out their numbers, could also figure out his own number. However, A&#39;s number must end with an even digit, which is 4 in this case. But does this fit?But let&#39;s check if this scenario works.Suppose the numbers are:A: 2304B: 9604C: 2704Then, A sees B and C&#39;s numbers, both ending with 04. So A says, &quot;The units digits of B and C are the same.&quot; Then B, seeing A=2304 and C=2704, knows his own number must end with 4. The possible numbers are 2304, 2704, 9604. Since A is 2304 and C is 2704, B&#39;s number must be 9604. Similarly, C, seeing A=2304 and B=9604, knows his number must be 2704. Then A, hearing that B and C know their numbers, can deduce that since B and C were able to figure theirs out, A&#39;s number must be the remaining one, which is 2304, with units digit 4. This seems to work.But wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#39;s see. Suppose the numbers are:A: 2704B: 2304C: 9604Then A sees B and C both ending with 04, says their units digits are the same. B, seeing A=2704 and C=9604, knows his number must end with 4. The possible numbers are 2304, 2704, 9604. Since A is 2704 and C is 9604, B&#39;s number must be 2304. Similarly, C, seeing A=2704 and B=2304, deduces his own number is 9604. Then A knows his number is 2704. This also works.Similarly, if A is 9604, B is 2304, C is 2704, same thing.So in all these cases, if all three numbers are from the 04 group, then the conversation could happen as described. But then, in this case, the sum would be 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = let&#39;s calculate: 2304+2704=5008; 5008+9604=14612.But wait, but the problem states that after A&#39;s first statement, B and C can figure out their numbers. However, in this scenario, if all three numbers are from the 04 group, then when A says that B and C have the same units digit (which is 4), then B and C, seeing each other&#39;s numbers (which are also ending with 4), can figure out their own numbers by elimination. But in this case, since there are three numbers in the group, and each person has one, then yes, they can deduce their own number by seeing the other two.However, another case: suppose B and C&#39;s numbers end with 9. Let&#39;s check.If B and C&#39;s numbers both end with 9, possible numbers: 2209, 2809, 9409.Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304 (ending with 4). Then B sees A&#39;s number and C&#39;s number. Suppose C&#39;s number is 2209. B knows his number must end with 9. The possible numbers are 2209 (taken by C), 2809, 9409. So B&#39;s number is either 2809 or 9409. If B sees that A&#39;s number is 2304, which is thousands digit 2, and C&#39;s number is 2209, thousands digit 2. Then B&#39;s number could be 2809 (thousands digit 2) or 9409 (thousands digit 9). If thousands digits can repeat, then B can&#39;t know. So this case doesn&#39;t allow B to determine his number. Therefore, this scenario might not work.Alternatively, if A&#39;s number is 9409 (ending with 9), but no, because in the end A says his units digit is even, so A&#39;s number must end with 4. So A cannot have a number ending with 9.Therefore, the only possible case is when B and C&#39;s numbers both end with 4, and A&#39;s number is also ending with 4. But wait, but in the problem, the units digit of A&#39;s number is even, which is 4, and B and C&#39;s numbers also end with 4. But in this case, all three numbers end with 4, which is allowed. But does the problem allow all three numbers to have the same units digit? It doesn&#39;t prohibit it. It just says that each number&#39;s units digit is not 0, and the tens digit is 0.But let&#39;s check if this is the only possible scenario. Suppose instead that B and C&#39;s numbers end with 1. Let&#39;s see.Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304 (ending with 4). B and C&#39;s numbers end with 1: 2401, 2601, 9801. Suppose B sees that C is 2401 and A is 2304. Then B knows his number must end with 1. Possible numbers: 2401 (taken by C), 2601, 9801. So B&#39;s number is either 2601 or 9801. But how can he know which one? If he sees A&#39;s number is 2304 (thousands digit 2), then 2601 is thousands digit 2, but 9801 is thousands digit 9. If numbers can have the same thousands digit, then B can&#39;t know. Unless there&#39;s a uniqueness in thousands digits. But the problem doesn&#39;t state that. Therefore, B can&#39;t determine, so this case doesn&#39;t work.Similarly, if B and C&#39;s numbers end with 9, same problem.Therefore, the only viable case is when all three numbers end with 4. Then, since there are exactly three numbers ending with 4 (2304, 2704, 9604), each person has one of them. Then, when A says that B and C have the same units digit (which is 4), B and C can each look at the other&#39;s number and deduce their own. For example, if B sees that C has 2304 and A has 2704, he knows his own number must be 9604. Then, after B and C figure out their numbers, A can deduce that his number is the remaining one, which must end with 4.But wait, but in the problem statement, A says that after hearing B and C, he also knows his number, and the units digit is even (which is 4). So yes, this fits.But let&#39;s confirm with an example:If the numbers are A:2304, B:2704, C:9604.Wait, no, wait, all three must be from the ending with 04 group. So possible triplet: 2304, 2704, 9604.But let&#39;s assign them to A, B, C.Suppose A has 2304, B has 2704, C has 9604.A sees B and C&#39;s numbers, both ending with 04, so he says their units digits are the same (4). Then B, seeing A=2304 and C=9604, knows his own number must be the remaining one in the 04 group, which is 2704. Similarly, C sees A=2304 and B=2704, and deduces his own number is 9604. Then A, knowing that B and C figured out their numbers, knows his own number is 2304, with units digit 4. This works.Alternatively, if A has 9604, B has 2304, C has 2704. Same reasoning.However, the problem states that the units digits of B and C are the same. In this case, they are all 4. Then A&#39;s units digit is also 4, which is even. So this seems to fit.But wait, the problem says &quot;the units digit of these three four-digit numbers is not 0&quot;. It doesn&#39;t say they are different. So all three can have units digit 4. However, the problem also says &quot;these three children are very smart and honest&quot;, implying that they can deduce their numbers only if the information is sufficient. If all three numbers are from the 04 group, then after A&#39;s statement, B and C can indeed deduce their numbers by elimination. Then A, hearing that, knows his own number is the remaining one. Therefore, this seems to fit.But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another possible group. For example, if B and C&#39;s numbers end with 1, but with some specific numbers that allow deduction.Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304 (ending with 4). B and C&#39;s numbers end with 1. Suppose B sees C&#39;s number is 2401 and A&#39;s number is 2304. Then B knows his number must end with 1. Possible numbers: 2401 (taken by C), 2601, 9801. B sees A&#39;s number is 2304. If B&#39;s number were 2601, then thousands digit is 2, same as A. But 2304 and 2601 both start with 2. But there&#39;s no rule against that. So B can&#39;t eliminate 2601. Similarly, 9801 starts with 9. But unless B knows something else, he can&#39;t determine. Therefore, this case doesn&#39;t allow B to know.Alternatively, suppose B and C&#39;s numbers are 2601 and 9801. If A&#39;s number is 2304. Then B sees C=9801 (ending with 1), so B&#39;s number must end with 1. The possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. Since C is 9801, B&#39;s number is either 2401 or 2601. If B sees A=2304, which is 2xxx, then maybe he thinks his number is 2401 or 2601. But still two options. So no.Therefore, the only viable case is when all three numbers are from the 04 group. Therefore, the sum is 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 2304+2704=5008; 5008+9604=14612.But wait, let&#39;s verify this. If the numbers are 2304, 2704, 9604, sum is 14612. However, let&#39;s check if there could be other combinations.Wait, but suppose the numbers are from different groups. For example, A&#39;s number is 2304, B&#39;s number is 2401, C&#39;s number is 2601. Then A sees B and C both ending with 01, so he says their units digits are same. Then B, seeing A=2304 and C=2601, knows his own number must end with 01. The possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. C is 2601, so B&#39;s number is 2401 or 9801. If B&#39;s number were 2401, then the thousands digit is 2, same as A&#39;s 2304. If it&#39;s 9801, thousands digit is 9. But B can&#39;t know. Similarly, C can&#39;t know. So this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if A&#39;s number is 9604, B&#39;s number is 2401, C&#39;s number is 9801. A sees both ending with 01, says so. Then B sees A=9604 and C=9801. B&#39;s number must end with 01. Possible numbers: 2401, 2601, 9801. C has 9801, so B&#39;s number is 2401 or 2601. B sees A=9604 (thousands digit 9), so if B&#39;s number is 2401 or 2601 (thousands digit 2), how does he know? He can&#39;t. So this doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the only possible scenario is when all three numbers are from the 04 group. Therefore, the sum is 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612.But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another possible triplet. For example, A=2704, B=2304, C=9604. Sum is same.Yes, regardless of permutation, the sum is the same. So the answer should be 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612.But let&#39;s confirm with the problem&#39;s final statement. After B and C figure out their numbers, A says he knows his number and its units digit is even. If all three numbers are from the 04 group, then yes, A&#39;s number has units digit 4, which is even. So this fits.However, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another possibility where B and C&#39;s numbers end with the same units digit (1 or 9), but still allow B and C to deduce their numbers, and A&#39;s number ends with 4.Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304 (ending with 4). B and C&#39;s numbers end with 9. The possible numbers ending with 9 are 2209, 2809, 9409. Suppose B sees that C has 9409 and A has 2304. B knows his number must end with 9. The possible numbers are 2209, 2809, 9409. Since C is 9409, B&#39;s number is 2209 or 2809. B sees A&#39;s number is 2304 (thousands digit 2). If B&#39;s number is 2209, thousands digit 2; if 2809, thousands digit 2. So both start with 2. So B can&#39;t determine. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Similarly, if C&#39;s number is 2209, B&#39;s number is 2809 or 9409. If B sees A=2304 (thousands digit 2), and C=2209 (thousands digit 2), then B&#39;s number could be 2809 (thousands digit 2) or 9409 (thousands digit 9). If B&#39;s number is 2809, same thousands digit as A and C. If 9409, different. But unless there&#39;s a rule against same thousands digits, B can&#39;t know. So this case doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the only possible solution is when all three numbers are from the 04 group. Thus, their sum is 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612.But let&#39;s verify once more:2304: 48²2704: 52²9604: 98²All are four-digit squares ending with 04, tens digit 0, units digit 4 (non-zero). Then the conversation proceeds as follows:A sees B and C&#39;s numbers, both ending with 04, so he states their units digits are the same. B, seeing A and C&#39;s numbers, deduces his own by elimination. Similarly for C. Then A knows his number is the remaining one, which ends with 4. This fits perfectly.Therefore, the sum is 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612.Final Answerboxed{14612}&lt;/think&gt;Given three people (A), (B), and (C) each wearing a four-digit perfect square number on their hats, with the tens digit being 0 and the units digit not being 0, we need to determine the sum of their numbers based on their conversation.1. Identify Possible Numbers:   - Four-digit perfect squares ending with non-zero units digits and tens digit 0 are:     - Ending with 01: 2401, 2601, 9801     - Ending with 04: 2304, 2704, 9604     - Ending with 09: 2209, 2809, 94092. Analyze Statements:   - (A) states that (B) and (C) have the same units digit.   - (B) and (C) deduce their numbers after hearing (A).   - (A) then knows his number has an even units digit (4).3. Deduction Process:   - Since (A)&#39;s units digit is even (4), his number must be one of 2304, 2704, 9604.   - (B) and (C), knowing their units digits are the same, deduce their numbers by elimination. If their units digits were 1 or 9, they couldn&#39;t uniquely determine their numbers due to multiple possibilities. Hence, their units digits must be 4.   - This leaves (A), (B), and (C) each with one of the numbers 2304, 2704, 9604.4. Sum Calculation:   - Summing these numbers: (2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612).Thus, the sum of the numbers on (A), (B), and (C)&#39;s hats is (boxed{14612}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem step by step. It&#39;s a bit complex, but I&#39;ll take it one piece at a time. So, we have three people: A, B, and C, each wearing a four-digit perfect square number on their hats. The numbers have a tens digit of 0 and a units digit that&#39;s not 0. Each person can see the others&#39; numbers but not their own. There&#39;s a conversation where A first says that B and C have the same units digit. Then B and C both figure out their numbers based on that. Then A figures out their own number with the additional clue that the units digit is even. We need to find the sum of all three numbers.First, let&#39;s break down the constraints:1. Four-digit perfect squares: So the numbers are between 1000 and 9999. The square roots of these numbers will be between 32 (since 32² = 1024) and 99 (since 99² = 9801). Wait, 100² is 10000, which is five digits, so the maximum square root is 99.2. Tens digit is 0: So the number looks like XY0Z, where XY are the first two digits and Z is the units digit. Since the tens digit is 0, the number is divisible by 10, but the units digit is not 0, so it&#39;s not divisible by 10 entirely. For example, 100 is divisible by 10, but here the units digit isn&#39;t 0, so the number is like 1024, but wait, 1024 has a tens digit of 2, which isn&#39;t 0. Wait, so the numbers must be such that when squared, the tens place is 0. So we need to find four-digit squares where the tens digit is 0 and the units digit is non-zero.3. Units digit is not 0: So the possible units digits are 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 because those are the possible units digits of perfect squares. But since the tens digit is 0, we need squares ending with 0 in the tens place and one of these digits in the units place. So numbers like ...0Z where Z is 1,4,5,6,9.First, let&#39;s list all four-digit perfect squares with tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero.To do that, we can consider numbers from 32 to 99, square them, and check if the tens digit is 0 and the units digit is non-zero.Let me start by recalling that when squaring numbers, the last two digits of the square depend only on the last two digits of the original number. So maybe we can find possible endings.We need squares ending with 01, 04, 05, 06, 09, 21, 24, 25, 26, 29, etc., but actually, since the tens digit is 0, the last two digits must be 0X, where X is non-zero. So the squares must end with 01, 04, 05, 06, 09. Wait, but wait, let&#39;s check which squares end with 0X where X is non-zero.Wait, the square ends with &#39;0&#39; in the tens place and some non-zero digit in the units. So possible endings are X0Y where Y is non-zero. Wait, no, the number is four digits, with the tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero. So the last two digits are 0X, where X is 1,4,5,6,9.But let&#39;s check which squares have last two digits as 01, 04, 05, 06, 09,  etc., with the tens digit 0.Let me recall that squares modulo 100 can be calculated. Let&#39;s find all squares mod 100 that have tens digit 0. So, numbers ending with 01, 04, 05, 06, 09, etc.But first, let&#39;s list all possible two-digit endings (mod 100) of squares. The possible units digits of squares are 0,1,4,5,6,9. But since the tens digit is 0 and the units digit isn&#39;t 0, the last two digits must be 01, 04, 05, 06, 09.Wait, let&#39;s check which squares mod 100 are 01, 04, 05, 06, 09.Let me compute squares of numbers from 0 to 99 mod 100 and see which ones have tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero.For example:- 1² = 01 → tens digit 0, units digit 1- 2² = 04 → tens digit 0, units digit 4- 3² = 09 → tens digit 0, units digit 9- 5² = 25 → tens digit 2, units digit 5 → not suitable- 7² = 49 → tens digit 4, units digit 9 → not suitable- 10² = 00 → units digit 0 → not allowed- 11² = 21 → units digit 1, tens digit 2 → not suitable- 12² = 44 → tens digit 4 → not suitable- 13² = 69 → tens digit 6 → not suitable- 14² = 96 → tens digit 9 → not suitable- 15² = 25 → same as 5²- 16² = 56 → tens digit 5 → not suitable- 17² = 89 → tens digit 8 → not suitable- 18² = 24 → tens digit 2 → not suitable- 19² = 61 → tens digit 6 → not suitable- 20² = 00 → units digit 0 → not allowed- 21² = 41 → tens digit 4 → not suitable- 22² = 84 → tens digit 8 → not suitable- 23² = 29 → tens digit 2 → not suitable- 24² = 76 → tens digit 7 → not suitable- 25² = 25 → same as 5²- 26² = 76 → same as 24²- 27² = 29 → same as 23²- 28² = 84 → same as 22²- 29² = 41 → same as 21²- 30² = 00 → invalid- 31² = 61 → same as 19²- 32² = 24 → same as 18²- 33² = 89 → same as 17²- 34² = 56 → same as 16²- 35² = 25 → same as 5²- 36² = 96 → same as 14²- 37² = 69 → same as 13²- 38² = 44 → same as 12²- 39² = 21 → same as 11²- 40² = 00 → invalid- 41² = 81 → tens digit 8 → not suitable- 42² = 64 → tens digit 6 → not suitable- 43² = 49 → same as 7²- 44² = 36 → tens digit 3 → not suitable- 45² = 25 → same as 5²- 46² = 16 → tens digit 1 → not suitable- 47² = 09 → tens digit 0, units digit 9- 48² = 04 → tens digit 0, units digit 4- 49² = 01 → tens digit 0, units digit 1- 50² = 00 → invalid- 51² = 01 → same as 49²- 52² = 04 → same as 48²- 53² = 09 → same as 47²- 54² = 16 → same as 46²- 55² = 25 → same as 5²- 56² = 36 → same as 44²- 57² = 49 → same as 43²- 58² = 64 → same as 42²- 59² = 81 → same as 41²- 60² = 00 → invalid- 61² = 21 → same as 11²- 62² = 44 → same as 12²- 63² = 69 → same as 13²- 64² = 96 → same as 14²- 65² = 25 → same as 5²- 66² = 56 → same as 16²- 67² = 89 → same as 17²- 68² = 24 → same as 18²- 69² = 61 → same as 19²- 70² = 00 → invalid- 71² = 41 → same as 21²- 72² = 84 → same as 22²- 73² = 29 → same as 23²- 74² = 76 → same as 24²- 75² = 25 → same as 5²- 76² = 76 → same as 24²- 77² = 29 → same as 23²- 78² = 84 → same as 22²- 79² = 41 → same as 21²- 80² = 00 → invalid- 81² = 61 → same as 19²- 82² = 24 → same as 18²- 83² = 89 → same as 17²- 84² = 56 → same as 16²- 85² = 25 → same as 5²- 86² = 96 → same as 14²- 87² = 69 → same as 13²- 88² = 44 → same as 12²- 89² = 21 → same as 11²- 90² = 00 → invalid- 91² = 81 → same as 41²- 92² = 64 → same as 42²- 93² = 49 → same as 43²- 94² = 36 → same as 44²- 95² = 25 → same as 5²- 96² = 16 → same as 46²- 97² = 09 → same as 47²- 98² = 04 → same as 48²- 99² = 01 → same as 49²So, from this, the squares that end with 0X (tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero) occur when the square ends with 01, 04, 05, 06, 09? Wait, wait, from the above, we see that squares can end with 01, 04, 09, 25, 16, 36, etc. But in the cases where the tens digit is 0, the last two digits are:- 01 (from 1, 49, 51, 99)- 04 (from 2, 48, 52, 98)- 09 (from 3, 47, 53, 97)- 05 is not possible because 25 has tens digit 2, 05 would be if the tens digit is 0, but 05 is not a possible ending for squares. Because squaring numbers ending with 5 gives 25. So 05 is not possible. Similarly, 06: there&#39;s 16, 36, etc., but those have tens digits 1 and 3. So, the only possible endings with tens digit 0 are 01, 04, 09.Wait, so from the above, the squares that end with 01, 04, 09 have tens digit 0. Wait, but looking at the numbers:- 1² = 01 (tens 0, units 1)- 2² = 04 (tens 0, units 4)- 3² = 09 (tens 0, units 9)- 47² = 2209 → ends with 09 (tens 0, units 9)- 48² = 2304 → ends with 04 (tens 0, units 4)- 49² = 2401 → ends with 01 (tens 0, units 1)- Similarly, 51² = 2601, 52² = 2704, 53² = 2809, 97²=9409, 98²=9604, 99²=9801.So all four-digit squares ending with 01, 04, 09, and have tens digit 0. So units digits can be 1,4,9.Wait, but the problem states that the units digit is not 0. So possible units digits are 1,4,9. Wait, but the problem says &quot;the units digit is not 0&quot;. But according to our analysis, the possible units digits are 1,4,9. Because squares can end with 1,4,5,6,9, but if the tens digit is 0, then the only possible units digits are 1,4,9. Let me check:For example, 25 has tens digit 2, 36 has tens digit 3, 16 has tens digit 1, etc. So if the tens digit is 0, then the units digit must be 1,4,9. So that&#39;s a key point.Therefore, the four-digit numbers on the hats must be squares ending with 01, 04, or 09, i.e., units digits 1,4,9. So first, let&#39;s list all four-digit squares with tens digit 0 and units digit 1,4,9.Starting from 32²=1024 (ends with 24, tens digit 2 → not suitable)33²=1089 (ends with 89, tens 8 → not)34²=1156 (ends with 56, tens 5 → no)35²=1225 (ends with 25, tens 2 → no)36²=1296 (ends with 96, tens 9 → no)37²=1369 (ends with 69, tens 6 → no)38²=1444 (ends with 44, tens 4 → no)39²=1521 (ends with 21, tens 2 → no)40²=1600 (ends with 00 → invalid)41²=1681 (ends with 81, tens 8 → no)42²=1764 (ends with 64, tens 6 → no)43²=1849 (ends with 49, tens 4 → no)44²=1936 (ends with 36, tens 3 → no)45²=2025 (ends with 25, tens 2 → no)46²=2116 (ends with 16, tens 1 → no)47²=2209 (ends with 09, tens 0 → valid, units digit 9)48²=2304 (ends with 04, tens 0 → valid, units digit 4)49²=2401 (ends with 01, tens 0 → valid, units digit 1)50²=2500 (invalid)51²=2601 (ends with 01, valid)52²=2704 (ends with 04, valid)53²=2809 (ends with 09, valid)54²=2916 (ends with 16, no)55²=3025 (ends with 25, no)56²=3136 (ends with 36, no)57²=3249 (ends with 49, no)58²=3364 (ends with 64, no)59²=3481 (ends with 81, no)60²=3600 (invalid)61²=3721 (ends with 21, no)62²=3844 (ends with 44, no)63²=3969 (ends with 69, no)64²=4096 (ends with 96, no)65²=4225 (ends with 25, no)66²=4356 (ends with 56, no)67²=4489 (ends with 89, no)68²=4624 (ends with 24, no)69²=4761 (ends with 61, no)70²=4900 (invalid)71²=5041 (ends with 41, no)72²=5184 (ends with 84, no)73²=5329 (ends with 29, no)74²=5476 (ends with 76, no)75²=5625 (ends with 25, no)76²=5776 (ends with 76, no)77²=5929 (ends with 29, no)78²=6084 (ends with 84, no)79²=6241 (ends with 41, no)80²=6400 (invalid)81²=6561 (ends with 61, no)82²=6724 (ends with 24, no)83²=6889 (ends with 89, no)84²=7056 (ends with 56, no)85²=7225 (ends with 25, no)86²=7396 (ends with 96, no)87²=7569 (ends with 69, no)88²=7744 (ends with 44, no)89²=7921 (ends with 21, no)90²=8100 (invalid)91²=8281 (ends with 81, no)92²=8464 (ends with 64, no)93²=8649 (ends with 49, no)94²=8836 (ends with 36, no)95²=9025 (ends with 25, no)96²=9216 (ends with 16, no)97²=9409 (ends with 09, valid)98²=9604 (ends with 04, valid)99²=9801 (ends with 01, valid)So the valid four-digit squares with tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero are:47² = 2209 (ends 09)48² = 2304 (ends 04)49² = 2401 (ends 01)51² = 2601 (ends 01)52² = 2704 (ends 04)53² = 2809 (ends 09)97² = 9409 (ends 09)98² = 9604 (ends 04)99² = 9801 (ends 01)Wait, let&#39;s list all of them:- 2209 (47²)- 2304 (48²)- 2401 (49²)- 2601 (51²)- 2704 (52²)- 2809 (53²)- 9409 (97²)- 9604 (98²)- 9801 (99²)So there are nine numbers in total. Each of A, B, C has one of these nine numbers. Now, let&#39;s note their units digits:- 2209: 9- 2304: 4- 2401: 1- 2601: 1- 2704: 4- 2809: 9- 9409: 9- 9604: 4- 9801: 1So the possible units digits are 1, 4, 9.Now, let&#39;s go back to the conversation.First, A says: &quot;The units digit of the numbers on B and C&#39;s hats are the same.&quot;So A sees B and C&#39;s numbers, and notices that both have the same units digit.Given that the units digits can be 1,4,9, this means that B and C&#39;s numbers both end with 1, both end with 4, or both end with 9.Then, after A&#39;s statement, B and C both figure out their own numbers. So each of them, knowing that the other has the same units digit as them (because A said so), can deduce their own number.Then A, after hearing that B and C figured out their numbers, can deduce their own number, which has an even units digit (so 4, since 1 and 9 are odd). So A&#39;s number ends with 4.Our task is to find the three numbers and their sum.Let&#39;s try to model the reasoning step by step.First, from A&#39;s first statement: B and C&#39;s numbers have the same units digit. So possible pairs (for B and C) are:- Both ending with 1: possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801- Both ending with 4: possible numbers are 2304, 2704, 9604- Both ending with 9: possible numbers are 2209, 2809, 9409So, B and C each see each other&#39;s numbers. Let&#39;s take B&#39;s perspective: B sees C&#39;s number. After A says that both have the same units digit, B knows that their own number must have the same units digit as C&#39;s. So if C&#39;s number ends with, say, 1, then B&#39;s number must also end with 1. Similarly for 4 and 9.But B can deduce their own number uniquely based on this information. Therefore, for each possible units digit (1,4,9), there must be only one possible number that B could have, given that they see C&#39;s number.Similarly for C: seeing B&#39;s number, knowing that they have the same units digit, they can deduce their own number uniquely.So the key here is that for each units digit, the numbers with that units digit must be uniquely identifiable when considering the other person&#39;s number.Wait, let&#39;s think about this. Suppose B sees that C&#39;s number is, say, 2401 (ending with 1). Then B knows that their own number must end with 1 as well. But there are three numbers ending with 1: 2401, 2601, 9801. If B can deduce their own number, that must mean that based on C&#39;s number, there&#39;s only one possible number that B could have.But how? Unless there&#39;s some uniqueness in the hundreds or thousands digits.Wait, let&#39;s list all numbers grouped by units digit:Units digit 1:- 2401 (49²)- 2601 (51²)- 9801 (99²)Units digit 4:- 2304 (48²)- 2704 (52²)- 9604 (98²)Units digit 9:- 2209 (47²)- 2809 (53²)- 9409 (97²)Each group has three numbers.If B sees that C&#39;s number is, say, 2401 (units digit 1), then B knows their own number must also end with 1. But there are three possibilities. However, B can only figure out their own number if there&#39;s something unique about the combination.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s about the other digits. For example, if B&#39;s number is one of the three ending with 1, but when combined with C&#39;s number, only one of them is possible. But how?Alternatively, perhaps for each pair of numbers with the same units digit, there&#39;s only one possible pair such that each can deduce their own number when they see the other&#39;s.Alternatively, if the numbers in each units digit group are such that when a person sees another number in the same group, they can deduce their own number because it&#39;s the only one that&#39;s compatible.Wait, for example, let&#39;s take the units digit 1 group: 2401, 2601, 9801.Suppose B sees that C has 2401. Then B knows their own number must end with 1, so possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. But B cannot have 2401 because that&#39;s C&#39;s number (assuming all three numbers are different? Wait, the problem says &quot;three four-digit numbers&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t specify if they are distinct. Hmm, the problem says &quot;these three four-digit numbers are all perfect squares&quot;, so maybe they can be the same? But usually, in these hat problems, the numbers are distinct. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify. Wait, let me check the original problem statement again.It says: &quot;Teacher D gave each of them a hat and wrote a four-digit number on each hat. It is known that these three four-digit numbers are all perfect squares...&quot; So &quot;three four-digit numbers&quot; - the wording doesn&#39;t specify they are distinct. So they could potentially be the same. However, in most logic puzzles like this, the numbers are distinct, but we need to confirm.But given that A, B, C are different people, it&#39;s possible they could have the same number. But let&#39;s see. If two people had the same number, then when A looks at B and C, he might see two numbers with the same digits, but the problem statement says &quot;the units digit of the numbers on B and C&#39;s hats are the same&quot;. If B and C had the same number, then their units digits would be the same, but A&#39;s statement would still hold. However, in the subsequent reasoning, B and C figure out their numbers. If B and C had the same number, then when B sees C&#39;s number, which is the same as theirs, they would know their own number immediately, but perhaps that&#39;s possible.But given that the problem says &quot;three four-digit numbers&quot;, and in the end, we need to find the sum of the numbers. If two are the same, the sum would be different. So we need to check both possibilities.But let&#39;s first assume that all three numbers are distinct. Then, when A says that B and C have the same units digit, then B and C know that their own number must be in the same group (1,4,9) as the other. Then, if when B sees C&#39;s number, they can deduce their own number uniquely, that must mean that for each number in a group, seeing another number in the same group allows only one possibility for their own number.Wait, but how?Alternatively, perhaps each number in a group is uniquely determined by the other numbers. For example, if the numbers in a group are such that each pair can only correspond to a unique third number (for A). But not sure.Alternatively, maybe after A&#39;s statement, B and C can eliminate some possibilities. Let&#39;s take an example.Suppose B sees that C&#39;s number is 2401 (units digit 1). Then B knows their own number must end with 1. So possible numbers: 2401, 2601, 9801. But B also knows that A&#39;s number must be one of the remaining numbers (since all three numbers are in the list of nine). Wait, but A&#39;s number is a four-digit square with tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero. So A&#39;s number is also one of the nine numbers. So if B and C&#39;s numbers are both in the units digit 1 group, then A&#39;s number must be in either the 4 or 9 group. But A later says that their units digit is even, so it must be 4.But before that, B needs to figure out their own number. So how can B, knowing that their own number ends with 1 (same as C&#39;s), and seeing C&#39;s number, deduce their own number.Wait, perhaps the key is that if B sees that C&#39;s number is, say, 2401, then B considers the possible own numbers: 2401, 2601, 9801. But if B had 2401, then C would see 2401 and would have to deduce their own number. But C, seeing B&#39;s 2401, would also consider 2401, 2601, 9801. But unless there&#39;s some uniqueness, they can&#39;t deduce. So maybe only certain numbers allow this deduction.Alternatively, maybe the numbers in each units digit group have unique thousands digits or something. Let&#39;s look at the units digit 1 group:- 2401: thousands digit 2- 2601: thousands digit 2- 9801: thousands digit 9Wait, 2401 and 2601 both start with 2, but have different hundreds digits (4 and 6). If B sees that C&#39;s number is 2401, and knows their own number ends with 1, then B&#39;s number could be 2401, 2601, or 9801. But if B had 2401, then C would be seeing 2401 and would have the same problem. Wait, but if the numbers have to be distinct, then if B sees C&#39;s number as 2401, B would know they can&#39;t have 2401 as well, so their number must be 2601 or 9801. But how would they choose between those?But the problem doesn&#39;t state that numbers are distinct. Hmm.Wait, the problem says &quot;three four-digit numbers&quot;, but not necessarily distinct. So perhaps two people can have the same number. However, in the conversation, A says that B and C&#39;s units digits are the same. If B and C have the same number, then their units digits are the same, which is allowed. However, in the subsequent reasoning, B and C both figure out their numbers. If they have the same number, then when B sees C&#39;s number, which is the same as their own, they would know their own number immediately. But is that the case?But even if numbers can be the same, let&#39;s suppose they are distinct. The problem probably intends them to be distinct, given the nature of such puzzles. So assuming distinct numbers.Therefore, if B sees that C&#39;s number is 2401, then B knows their own number must be either 2601 or 9801 (since 2401 is already taken by C). But how can B determine which one?Similarly, if B sees that C&#39;s number is 2601, then B&#39;s number could be 2401 or 9801.If B sees that C&#39;s number is 9801, then B&#39;s number could be 2401 or 2601.But in none of these cases can B uniquely determine their own number. So maybe this line of reasoning isn&#39;t correct.Wait, perhaps the key is that after A&#39;s statement, both B and C can deduce their numbers, so it must be that for each of them, the seen number allows only one possibility for their own number in their units digit group.Which would mean that in each units digit group, the numbers are such that each number can only pair with one other number to allow unique deduction.Alternatively, maybe the numbers in each units digit group have unique leading digits or something. For example, in the units digit 4 group:- 2304 (thousands digit 2)- 2704 (thousands digit 2)- 9604 (thousands digit 9)Similarly, units digit 1 group has two numbers starting with 2 and one with 9. Units digit 9 group:- 2209 (22)- 2809 (28)- 9409 (94)Hmm. Let&#39;s think. Suppose B sees that C&#39;s number is 2304 (units digit 4). Then B knows their own number must be 2304, 2704, or 9604. But if the numbers are distinct, then B can eliminate 2304 (if they see it on C&#39;s head), leaving 2704 or 9604. How can B decide between them? Similarly, unless there&#39;s another clue.Wait, but the key is that after A&#39;s statement, both B and C can figure out their numbers. So if B and C can both figure out their numbers, it&#39;s likely that for each units digit group, the numbers are arranged such that if two people have numbers from the same group, seeing each other&#39;s numbers allows them to deduce their own. Maybe each group has numbers that are unique in some way.Wait, let&#39;s consider the units digit 4 group: 2304, 2704, 9604.If B sees that C&#39;s number is 2304, then B knows their own number must be 2304, 2704, or 9604. If they are distinct, B&#39;s own number can&#39;t be 2304, so it&#39;s either 2704 or 9604. But how does B choose? Similarly, if C sees B&#39;s number as 2304, same problem.Wait, unless there is only one possible number in the group that is compatible with the fact that A can later deduce their own number. But perhaps not.Alternatively, maybe the numbers in each group are such that given any two numbers in the group, the third number (A&#39;s number) is uniquely determined. But since there are three numbers in each group, but three people, this might not hold.Alternatively, maybe the fact that both B and C can deduce their numbers implies that their numbers are uniquely determined by seeing each other&#39;s numbers. So, for example, if B sees C&#39;s number as X, and given that their own number must have the same units digit as X, there is only one possible number they could have.But in the current setup, with three numbers per group, this would require that for each number in the group, there&#39;s only one other number such that the pair allows deduction. But unless the numbers are arranged in a way that each number can only pair with one other number for deduction.Alternatively, perhaps there is only one pair in each group where each person can deduce their own number uniquely. For example, in the units digit 4 group: 2304, 2704, 9604.Suppose B sees C&#39;s number is 2304. Then B&#39;s number could be 2704 or 9604. But if 9604 is paired with 2304, does that leave A&#39;s number as 2704? But A&#39;s number must be in a different group (since all three are in the same group? No, A&#39;s number can be in any group. Wait, no: the three numbers can be in different groups. Wait, but A&#39;s number could be in any group. Wait, no: A&#39;s number is a four-digit square with tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero. So A&#39;s number could be in any of the three groups (1,4,9). However, in the final statement, A says that their units digit is even, so it must be 4. Therefore, A&#39;s number must be in the units digit 4 group.Wait, that&#39;s a key point. At the end, A says: &quot;After hearing what B and C said, I also know my number, and the units digit of my number is an even number.&quot;So A&#39;s number must end with 4. Therefore, A&#39;s number is one of 2304, 2704, 9604. So the three numbers are: A&#39;s number (ending with 4), and B and C&#39;s numbers (ending with the same digit, either 1,4,9). But since A&#39;s number ends with 4, B and C&#39;s numbers cannot end with 4 (because all three numbers are four-digit squares with tens digit 0 and non-zero units digits, but if A&#39;s number ends with 4, then B and C&#39;s numbers must end with 1 or 9, since A said they have the same units digit, and if they had 4, then all three numbers would end with 4, but A&#39;s number is already 4. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t say the numbers are distinct. So if A&#39;s number is 2304, and B and C both have 2304, that&#39;s allowed, but unlikely in a puzzle. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify.However, given that B and C were able to deduce their numbers after A&#39;s statement, if B and C had the same number as A, which ends with 4, then B and C would see that A&#39;s number ends with 4 and their own numbers would have to end with 4 as well, but A said that B and C&#39;s units digits are the same, so if A&#39;s number is 4, then B and C&#39;s numbers must be same as each other, but not necessarily same as A&#39;s. However, if A&#39;s number is 4, then B and C&#39;s numbers could be 4 as well, but that would mean three numbers ending with 4, but the problem allows that. But since in the end, A is able to deduce their number after B and C deduced theirs, maybe the numbers are distinct.But let&#39;s think again. If A&#39;s number ends with 4, and B and C&#39;s numbers end with the same digit, which is either 1 or 9 (since if they ended with 4, then A&#39;s statement would be that B and C have the same units digit as each other, which is 4, but since A&#39;s number is 4, maybe they could also be 4. However, in the conversation, A says &quot;the units digit of the numbers on B and C&#39;s hats are the same&quot;. A doesn&#39;t mention their own number. So even if B and C also had 4, A&#39;s statement would still be true. But then, if B and C had 4, then after A&#39;s statement, they would know their own number is 4. But since there are three numbers ending with 4 (2304, 2704, 9604), if B and C both had 2304, they would see each other&#39;s number and know their own is 2304. But how?Wait, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s try to approach this methodically.Given that A&#39;s number ends with 4 (from the final statement), so A has 2304, 2704, or 9604.B and C have numbers ending with the same digit (either 1,4,9). But if B and C&#39;s numbers ended with 4, then A&#39;s number would also be 4, but then all three numbers would end with 4. However, the problem doesn&#39;t prohibit this. However, given that B and C could figure out their numbers after A&#39;s statement, let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible.Case 1: B and C&#39;s numbers end with 1.Then B and C each have one of 2401, 2601, 9801. When A says that their units digits are the same, B sees C&#39;s number and C sees B&#39;s number. For them to deduce their own numbers uniquely, there must be some uniqueness in the numbers. For example, if B sees that C has 2401, then B knows their own number is either 2601 or 9801 (assuming distinct numbers). But how can they know which one?Similarly, if B sees that C has 9801, then their own number is either 2401 or 2601.But unless there&#39;s some additional information, they can&#39;t determine their own number. So maybe this case is impossible.Case 2: B and C&#39;s numbers end with 9.Similarly, their numbers could be 2209, 2809, 9409. Again, the same problem: seeing one of these, how do they deduce their own?Case 3: B and C&#39;s numbers end with 4.Then their numbers are 2304, 2704, 9604. If A&#39;s number is also 4, then all three numbers end with 4. But if B sees that C has, say, 2304, then B knows their own number is either 2304, 2704, or 9604. If they are distinct, B can eliminate 2304 (C&#39;s number), leaving 2704 or 9604. But again, no way to choose.But wait, the key is that after A&#39;s statement, both B and C can figure out their numbers. So in whichever case we&#39;re in, both B and C must be able to uniquely determine their numbers. Therefore, there must be a unique solution where, for B and C, seeing each other&#39;s number and knowing they have the same units digit allows them to deduce their own number.Therefore, we need to find a pair of numbers (for B and C) such that when each looks at the other&#39;s number, they can deduce their own number uniquely.Let&#39;s consider possible pairs.First, consider pairs ending with 1:Possible pairs (B,C) are:(2401, 2401), but duplicate.(2401, 2601)(2401, 9801)(2601, 2401)(2601, 2601)(2601, 9801)(9801, 2401)(9801, 2601)(9801, 9801)But assuming distinct numbers, possible pairs are:(2401,2601), (2401,9801), (2601,9801)Now, suppose B sees 2401 on C. Then B&#39;s number could be 2601 or 9801. How can B know? Unless there&#39;s something else. Similarly, if B sees 2601, their own number could be 2401 or 9801. If B sees 9801, their own number could be 2401 or 2601. No unique determination.Similarly for pairs ending with 9:Possible pairs:(2209,2809), (2209,9409), (2809,9409)Same issue.For pairs ending with 4:(2304,2704), (2304,9604), (2704,9604)Again, same problem.But wait, maybe if the numbers in a pair have a unique property that allows deduction.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Suppose that for a pair of numbers in the same units digit group, the numbers are such that the other number in the pair is the only one that allows deduction. For example, if B sees that C has 2304, and knows their own number must end with 4, then B&#39;s number could be 2704 or 9604. But if 2704 is the only number that, when combined with 2304, allows A to later deduce their number, then B would know. But this seems too vague.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s only one pair where both B and C can deduce their numbers. Let&#39;s check.Suppose B and C both have 2304. Then when A says they have the same units digit, B and C, seeing each other&#39;s 2304, would know their own number is 2304. But this requires that duplicates are allowed, which they might be. But then A&#39;s number would have to be one of the remaining numbers ending with 4 (2704 or 9604), but since A&#39;s number must end with 4, which it does. However, in this case, A would see two 2304s and know that their own number is 2704 or 9604. But then A couldn&#39;t determine which one unless there&#39;s more info. However, in the problem, after B and C deduce their numbers, A can also deduce theirs. So if B and C both have 2304, then A&#39;s number must be either 2704 or 9604. But how does A deduce which one? There&#39;s no info given to A except that B and C have the same units digit, which they do (4). Then A, knowing that their own number ends with an even digit (4), which it does, but they already knew that. Wait, no: A first says that B and C have the same units digit. Then, after B and C figure out their numbers, A can deduce their own number. If A&#39;s number is 2704 or 9604, how can they know which one?This seems stuck. Maybe we need to look for numbers where, given that B and C can deduce theirs, A can then deduce theirs uniquely.Let&#39;s think of a possible triplet: A has a number ending with 4, B and C have numbers ending with the same digit (1,4,9). Let&#39;s try to find such triplets.Suppose A has 2304. Then B and C must have numbers ending with same digit. Suppose they end with 1: possible numbers 2401, 2601, 9801. If B and C have, say, 2401 and 2601. When A says they have the same units digit, B sees 2601 (ends with 1) and knows their own must end with 1. The possible numbers are 2401, 2601, 9801. But since B sees 2601 on C, and assuming numbers are distinct, B&#39;s number is either 2401 or 9801. But B cannot determine which. Similarly, C sees 2401 and can&#39;t determine. So this triplet doesn&#39;t work.Another triplet: A has 2304, B and C both have 2401 (ending with 1). Then B sees 2401 on C, knows their own number ends with 1. If duplicates are allowed, B can have 2401. Then A&#39;s number is 2304. Then when A hears that B and C figured out their numbers, A knows that B and C have 2401 each (if duplicates are allowed). Then A, knowing their own number ends with 4 (from their final statement), but A already knew that. But how does A deduce their own number? They already knew their number ends with 4. Wait, no: A didn&#39;t know their own number initially. Wait, no: the problem says each child can see the others&#39; numbers. So A sees B and C&#39;s numbers, which are both 2401. Then A says that B and C&#39;s units digits are the same (which they are, 1). Then B and C, each seeing the other&#39;s 2401, and hearing A&#39;s statement, can deduce their own number. If duplicates are allowed, then B (seeing C&#39;s 2401) might think, &quot;If my number is also 2401, then C would see mine and know theirs is 2401. But if my number is different, like 2601 or 9801, then C would see that and not know.&quot; But this is getting too convoluted.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of unique numbers. Suppose there is only one pair of numbers in the same units digit group where each person can deduce their number. For example, consider the pair 2601 and 9801. Both end with 1. If B sees 9801 on C, then B knows their own number must end with 1. The possibilities are 2401, 2601, 9801. If B&#39;s number were 9801, then C would see 9801 and have the same problem. But if B&#39;s number is 2601, then C sees 2601 and can deduce their own number is 9801. Wait, this might not hold.Alternatively, maybe the numbers 2601 and 9801 are the only two in the units digit 1 group with different thousands digits. If B sees that C&#39;s number is 9801 (thousands digit 9), then B knows their own number must be 2401 or 2601 (thousands digit 2). But B can&#39;t determine which. Similarly, C sees B&#39;s 2601 (thousands digit 2) and knows their own is 2401 or 9801. No unique determination.This is quite challenging. Let&#39;s try a different approach.Since A is able to deduce their number after hearing B and C, it means that there&#39;s only one possible number for A that is consistent with B and C&#39;s numbers and the fact that B and C could deduce theirs.Let&#39;s suppose that B and C have numbers ending with 9. Then their numbers are 2209, 2809, 9409.If A&#39;s number ends with 4 (2304, 2704, 9604), then let&#39;s see:If B and C have 2209 and 2809, for example. When A says that their units digits are the same, B sees 2809 and knows their own must end with 9. Possible numbers: 2209, 2809, 9409. If B has 2209 or 9409, but how do they decide?Alternatively, if B and C have 2209 and 9409. B sees 9409 and knows their own number must be 2209 or 2809. Again, no way to decide.Alternatively, if B and C have 2809 and 9409. Similar problem.So maybe units digit 9 group doesn&#39;t work. How about units digit 1?If B and C have 2401 and 9801. When B sees 9801, they know their own number must be 2401 or 2601. But without more info, they can&#39;t decide.Similarly for other pairs.Now let&#39;s consider units digit 4. If B and C have numbers ending with 4, and A also has a number ending with 4. For example, B has 2304, C has 2704, A has 9604. But then when A says that B and C have the same units digit (4), then B sees C&#39;s 2704 and knows their own number must end with 4. Possible numbers: 2304, 2704, 9604. If B has 2304 or 9604. But how do they decide? Similarly for C.Alternatively, if B and C both have 2304. Then when A says they have the same units digit, B and C each see 2304 and know their own number is 2304 (if duplicates allowed). Then A, knowing that their own number ends with 4 (from their final statement), would have 2704 or 9604. But how does A decide? They see two 2304s. The remaining numbers are 2704 and 9604. But unless there&#39;s something else, A can&#39;t decide.This is really tricky. Maybe we need to look for numbers where, given that B and C can deduce theirs, there&#39;s only one possibility for A.Wait, let&#39;s consider the following:If B and C have numbers such that when they see each other&#39;s number, there&#39;s only one possible number they could have, leading to A&#39;s number being uniquely determined.For example, suppose B and C have 2401 and 2601. Both end with 1. When B sees 2601, they know their own number must end with 1. The possibilities are 2401, 2601, 9801. If B&#39;s number were 2401, then C would see 2401 and have to choose between 2601 and 9801. But since both B and C can figure out their numbers, maybe there&#39;s a unique solution.Wait, but how? This seems like a dead end.Alternatively, maybe the numbers 2601 and 9801 have a unique property. For example, 2601 is 51² and 9801 is 99². If B sees 9801, which is the largest number in the group, maybe they can deduce that their own number must be 2601 because 2401 is smaller, but there&#39;s no basis for that assumption.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a number that is the only one with a certain hundreds digit. For example, in the units digit 1 group:- 2401: hundreds digit 4- 2601: hundreds digit 6- 9801: hundreds digit 8If B sees that C&#39;s number has hundreds digit 8 (9801), then B knows their own number must have hundreds digit 4 or 6. But without more info, they can&#39;t decide.Alternatively, maybe the numbers have unique square roots. For example, 2401 is 49², 2601 is 51², 9801 is 99². If the square roots have certain properties, but I don&#39;t see how that helps.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. When A says that B and C&#39;s units digits are the same, B and C know that their numbers are in the same group. If the numbers in that group have unique properties such that, given the other person&#39;s number, there&#39;s only one possible own number.For example, in the units digit 4 group:- 2304 (48²)- 2704 (52²)- 9604 (98²)If B sees that C&#39;s number is 9604, then B knows their own number must be 2304 or 2704. But 9604 is the only number in the group with thousands digit 9. If B&#39;s number is in the same group (units digit 4), but B sees that C&#39;s number is 9604, which is unique in the group, then B might reason that if their own number were 9604, C would see that and not be able to determine their own number. Therefore, B can eliminate 9604 and conclude their own number is 2304 or 2704. But this still doesn&#39;t help.Alternatively, maybe if B sees that C&#39;s number is 2304, and B knows that if their own number were 2304, then C would be seeing 2304 and could not determine their own number. Therefore, B must have the other number. Wait, this is similar to the blue-eyed islanders problem.Wait, maybe this is a case of mutual knowledge. Let&#39;s suppose that all numbers are distinct. If B sees that C&#39;s number is 2304, B considers whether their own number is 2304 or 2704 or 9604. If B&#39;s number were 2304, then C would be seeing 2304 and would have the same problem: C would consider 2304, 2704, 9604. But since B knows that they are both logical, if B&#39;s number were 2304, C would not be able to deduce their number. However, since C did deduce their number, B can conclude that their own number is not 2304, hence must be 2704 or 9604. Similarly, C does the same reasoning. But this requires multiple levels of reasoning.Wait, this might be the case. Let&#39;s formalize it.Suppose the true numbers are A: 2704, B: 2304, C: 9604. But all three end with 4. But A&#39;s number must end with 4, and B and C&#39;s numbers also end with 4. Then A&#39;s statement is that B and C&#39;s units digits are the same (true). Then B sees C&#39;s 9604 and knows their own number must be 2304, 2704, or 9604. If B&#39;s number were 9604, then C would see 9604 and have to choose between 2304, 2704, 9604. If C&#39;s number were 9604, same issue. But since both B and C can deduce their numbers, perhaps this is possible.But this seems too vague. Let&#39;s try with actual numbers.Let&#39;s consider that A&#39;s number is 2304, and B and C have 2704 and 9604.Wait, no, A&#39;s number must be one of the units digit 4 numbers. Suppose A has 2304, B has 2704, and C has 9604. Then A sees B and C&#39;s numbers (2704 and 9604), which both end with 4. So A says their units digits are the same. Then B sees A&#39;s 2304 and C&#39;s 9604. B knows their own number must end with 4 (per A&#39;s statement), so possibilities: 2304, 2704, 9604. Since B sees 2304 and 9604 on A and C, their own number must be 2704. Similarly, C sees A&#39;s 2304 and B&#39;s 2704, and deduces their own number is 9604. Then A, hearing that B and C figured out their numbers, knows that B and C must have 2704 and 9604. Since A sees B and C&#39;s numbers (2704 and 9604), A can deduce their own number is the remaining one, which is 2304, and since the units digit is 4 (even), this fits. So this seems to work.Wait, let&#39;s check this scenario:- A has 2304, B has 2704, C has 9604.A sees B&#39;s 2704 and C&#39;s 9604, both ending with 4, so A says the units digits are the same.B sees A&#39;s 2304 and C&#39;s 9604. B knows their own number must end with 4 (from A&#39;s statement), so possibilities: 2304, 2704, 9604. Since B sees 2304 and 9604, their own number must be 2704.C sees A&#39;s 2304 and B&#39;s 2704. Similarly, C deduces their own number is 9604.Then A, knowing that B and C have figured out their numbers, knows that B and C must have 2704 and 9604. Since A sees both, A can deduce their own number is the remaining one, 2304, which ends with 4 (even). This fits all conditions.Similarly, let&#39;s check if there are other possible triplets.Suppose A has 2704, B has 2304, C has 9604.A sees B and C&#39;s numbers (2304 and 9604), both ending with 4. Says so.B sees A&#39;s 2704 and C&#39;s 9604. Knows their own number must be 2304, 2704, 9604. Since they see 2704 and 9604, their own number is 2304.C sees A&#39;s 2704 and B&#39;s 2304. Knows their own number is 9604.A, hearing that B and C figured out their numbers, knows their own number is 2704, which ends with 4. This also works.Similarly, if A has 9604, B has 2304, C has 2704.A sees B and C&#39;s numbers (2304 and 2704), both ending with 4. Says so.B sees A&#39;s 9604 and C&#39;s 2704. Deduces own number is 2304.C sees A&#39;s 9604 and B&#39;s 2304. Deduces own number is 2704.A then knows their number is 9604, which ends with 4.So all three permutations of the triplet (2304, 2704, 9604) work. However, the problem states that the sum of the numbers is required. Since all permutations sum to the same total, the answer would be 2304 + 2704 + 9604.Let&#39;s compute that:2304 + 2704 = 50085008 + 9604 = 14612But wait, let&#39;s check if there are other possible triplets.Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304, B and C both have 2304 (duplicates). Then A sees two 2304s, says their units digits are the same. B sees C&#39;s 2304 and deduces their own is 2304 (if duplicates allowed). C same. Then A, hearing that, knows their own number is either 2704 or 9604. But since A&#39;s number must end with even digit (4), which both do, but A can&#39;t determine which. So this triplet doesn&#39;t work because A can&#39;t figure out their number uniquely.Similarly, if A&#39;s number is 2304, and B and C have 2304 and 2704. But then A sees two numbers, one ending with 4 and one ending with 4. Says so. B sees 2304 and 2704, deduces own number is 2304 or 9604. Can&#39;t determine. So this triplet doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the only valid triplet is when all three numbers are distinct and are 2304, 2704, 9604. But wait, what if the numbers are in the units digit 1 or 9 groups?Wait, suppose A&#39;s number is 2304, and B and C have numbers ending with 1. For example, B has 2401 and C has 2601. Then A sees both ending with 1, says so. B sees C&#39;s 2601 and knows their own number must end with 1. The possibilities are 2401, 2601, 9801. B can&#39;t determine. Similarly, C can&#39;t determine. So this triplet doesn&#39;t work.Similarly for units digit 9.Therefore, the only possible triplet that works is when A, B, C have 2304, 2704, 9604 in some order. The sum is 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612.But let&#39;s check if there are other triplets in other groups.Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304, B&#39;s number is 2401, C&#39;s number is 2401. Then A sees two 2401s, says units digits are the same. B sees A&#39;s 2304 and C&#39;s 2401, deduces own number is 2401 (since units digit must be 1). Similarly, C deduces own number is 2401. Then A, knowing that B and C have 2401, can deduce their own number is 2304, which ends with 4. But this requires duplicates. If duplicates are allowed, this works. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify that numbers must be distinct, but typically in such puzzles, they are. Also, the sum would be 2304 + 2401 + 2401 = 7106, which is different.But the problem says &quot;three four-digit numbers&quot;, and if duplicates are allowed, there could be multiple solutions. However, the problem states that the children are honest, but it doesn&#39;t mention whether the numbers are distinct. However, in the initial analysis, when we considered that B and C can deduce their numbers uniquely, the only way this works is if the numbers are in the units digit 4 group, leading to the triplet 2304, 2704, 9604.But another possible triplet: A has 2704, B has 2304, C has 9604, sum 14612.But let&#39;s verify if this is the only solution.Suppose A&#39;s number is 9604, B&#39;s number is 2304, C&#39;s number is 2704. Then:- A sees 2304 and 2704, both ending with 4, says so.- B sees 9604 and 2704, deduces own number is 2304.- C sees 9604 and 2304, deduces own number is 2704.- A hears B and C deduce theirs, so A knows their own number must be 9604, which ends with 4.This works.Similarly, any permutation of these three numbers works, sum 14612.Are there any other triplets?Let&#39;s consider if A&#39;s number is 2704, B&#39;s number is 2304, and C&#39;s number is 9604. This is the same as above.Is there another triplet where B and C can deduce their numbers?Suppose A&#39;s number is 9604, B&#39;s number is 2704, and C&#39;s number is 2304. Same sum.Are there triplets outside the units digit 4 group?Suppose A&#39;s number is 2304, B&#39;s number is 2209, C&#39;s number is 9409. Both B and C&#39;s numbers end with 9.A sees 2209 and 9409, says units digits are the same (9).B sees A&#39;s 2304 and C&#39;s 9409. B knows their own number must end with 9 (from A&#39;s statement), so possibilities: 2209, 2809, 9409. B sees C&#39;s 9409, so their own number could be 2209 or 2809. How can B decide? If B&#39;s number were 2209, then C would see A&#39;s 2304 and B&#39;s 2209, and C&#39;s number must end with 9. C&#39;s possibilities: 2209, 2809, 9409. C sees 2209 and 2304, so own number is 2809 or 9409. C can&#39;t determine. So this triplet doesn&#39;t work because B and C can&#39;t deduce their numbers.Similarly, if B&#39;s number is 2809 and C&#39;s is 9409:A&#39;s number is 2304. B sees 2304 and 9409, own number must be 2209, 2809, 9409. Since B sees 9409, own number could be 2209 or 2809. Can&#39;t determine. So this doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the only valid triplet is the one in the units digit 4 group: 2304, 2704, 9604, sum 14612.But let&#39;s confirm one more time.Another possible triplet: A has 2304, B has 2704, C has 9604.A says B and C&#39;s units digits are the same (4).B sees A&#39;s 2304 and C&#39;s 9604. B&#39;s possible numbers: 2304, 2704, 9604. Seeing A and C&#39;s numbers, B eliminates 2304 and 9604, so own number is 2704.Similarly, C sees A&#39;s 2304 and B&#39;s 2704, eliminates 2304 and 2704, own number is 9604.A then knows their number is 2304, which ends with 4.This works.If we try any other triplet outside this group, B and C can&#39;t deduce their numbers uniquely. Therefore, the sum is 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612.However, let&#39;s check the units digit of A&#39;s number. The problem states that A&#39;s number has an even units digit. In this case, all three numbers end with 4, which is even. So A&#39;s number is one of them, which fits.Therefore, the answer should be 2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612.But let&#39;s compute the sum:2304 + 2704 = 50085008 + 9604 = 14612.Yes.But let me check if there are other triplets in the units digit 4 group.The units digit 4 group has 2304, 2704, 9604. So the only possible triplets are permutations of these three numbers. Since there are three people, each wearing one of these numbers. Therefore, the sum is always the same, 14612.Therefore, the final answer is 14612.Final Answerboxed{14612}&lt;/think&gt;Given three people (A), (B), and (C) each wearing a four-digit perfect square number on their hats, with the tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero, we need to determine the sum of their numbers based on their conversation.1. Identify Possible Numbers:   - The numbers must be four-digit perfect squares with tens digit 0 and units digit non-zero.   - Possible units digits are 1, 4, 9 (since these are the units digits of perfect squares ending in 0X where X is non-zero).   - Valid numbers: 2209, 2304, 2401, 2601, 2704, 2809, 9409, 9604, 9801.2. Analyze Conversation:   - (A) states that (B) and (C) have the same units digit.   - (B) and (C) deduce their numbers after hearing (A)&#39;s statement.   - (A) then deduces their number, which has an even units digit (4).3. Deduction Process:   - (A)&#39;s number must end in 4 (even units digit).   - Possible numbers for (A): 2304, 2704, 9604.   - (B) and (C) must have numbers ending in the same units digit (1, 4, or 9). However, since (A)&#39;s number ends in 4, (B) and (C) must also end in 4 for their units digits to be the same.4. Determine Valid Triplet:   - If (B) and (C) have numbers ending in 4, they must be from the set {2304, 2704, 9604}.   - (B) and (C) can each deduce their number uniquely by seeing the other&#39;s number and knowing the units digit must be 4.5. Sum Calculation:   - The valid triplet is 2304, 2704, and 9604.   - Sum: (2304 + 2704 + 9604 = 14612).[boxed{14612}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-43575fad></div><p class="review-content" data-v-43575fad><span class="icon" data-v-43575fad>🔑:</span>【Answer】 14612【Solution】Assume overline{c b 0 a}=(overline{e f})^{2}=(10 e+f)^{2}=100 e^{2}+20 e f+f^{2}(a neq 0 Rightarrow f neq 0), taking the modulo 100 on both sides, we get 20 e f+f^{2} equiv a(bmod 100), which means the tens digit of 20 e f+f^{2} is 0. Clearly, the tens digit of 20 e f is definitely even, so the tens digit of f^{2} must also be even, and the values of f that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.(1) When f=1, 2, 3, to make the tens digit of 20 e f+f^{2} 0, then e=5.

According to the third statement by A, we know that these three numbers are (2704,2304,9604), so the sum of these three numbers is 2704+2304+9604=14612.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-95c350c8 data-v-43575fad><div class="review" data-v-43575fad><div class="review-title" data-v-43575fad><span class="icon" data-v-43575fad>❓:</span>Given the function f(x)=Asin(wx+phi) (A &gt; 0, w &gt; 0) has a maximum point at left(frac{pi}{2}, sqrt{2}right), and the curve from this point to the adjacent minimum point intersects the x-axis at left(frac{3pi}{2}, 0right).

There are three parts: find the expression for f(x), find its range on [0, π], and then determine the range of m such that |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 for all x in [0, π]. Let me start with part (1).First, the function is given as A sin(wx + φ), with A &gt; 0 and w &gt; 0. It has a maximum point at (π/2, √2). Since it&#39;s a sine function, the maximum value should be A, right? Because the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, so multiplying by A scales it to between -A and A. So if the maximum is √2, then A must be √2. So I can write A = √2. That&#39;s straightforward.Next, the maximum occurs at x = π/2. For the sine function sin(θ), the maximum occurs at θ = π/2 + 2πk, where k is an integer. In our case, θ is wx + φ. So at x = π/2, we have w*(π/2) + φ = π/2 + 2πk. Since the problem mentions it&#39;s the adjacent maximum and then the adjacent minimum, maybe k = 0 here because the phase shift shouldn&#39;t be too big. Let&#39;s assume k = 0 for simplicity. Then:w*(π/2) + φ = π/2So that gives an equation: (wπ/2) + φ = π/2. Let&#39;s note that equation (1).Then, the curve from this maximum point (π/2, √2) to the adjacent minimum intersects the x-axis at (3π/2, 0). So between the maximum at π/2 and the next minimum, there is an x-intercept at 3π/2. Let&#39;s think about the sine curve. Normally, the sine curve goes from maximum to zero to minimum, etc. But here, the maximum is at π/2, then the next minimum would be at a point further along. However, the x-intercept is at 3π/2. So maybe the period is such that between π/2 and the next minimum, it crosses the x-axis at 3π/2.Wait, in the standard sine function, after a maximum, the next zero crossing is at (3/4) period. Hmm, but maybe here the period is different. Let me think.The function is A sin(wx + φ). The period is 2π/w. The maximum occurs at wx + φ = π/2. Then, the next minimum occurs at wx + φ = 3π/2. Let&#39;s find the x-coordinate of that minimum.So solving wx + φ = 3π/2. From the maximum at x = π/2, which gives w*(π/2) + φ = π/2. So if we subtract these two equations:(wx + φ) - [w*(π/2) + φ] = 3π/2 - π/2w(x - π/2) = πTherefore, x - π/2 = π/w =&gt; x = π/2 + π/w.So the minimum occurs at x = π/2 + π/w. Now, the problem says that between the maximum at (π/2, √2) and the adjacent minimum, the curve intersects the x-axis at (3π/2, 0). So the x-intercept is at 3π/2. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the minimum should be after 3π/2. Wait, but the x-intercept is between the maximum and the minimum. So between π/2 and π/2 + π/w, the curve crosses the x-axis at 3π/2. So 3π/2 is between π/2 and π/2 + π/w. Therefore:π/2 &lt; 3π/2 &lt; π/2 + π/wWait, but 3π/2 is greater than π/2, obviously. Then π/2 + π/w must be greater than 3π/2. So:π/2 + π/w &gt; 3π/2Subtract π/2:π/w &gt; πDivide both sides by π (since π &gt; 0):1/w &gt; 1 =&gt; w &lt; 1.But the problem states that w &gt; 0. So w is between 0 and 1.But also, the x-intercept at 3π/2 is between π/2 and the minimum at π/2 + π/w. So, the zero crossing occurs when the sine function goes from √2 (maximum) down to -√2 (minimum), crossing zero at 3π/2.In the standard sine function, the zero crossing after the maximum is at (max + min)/2 in terms of x. Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that between the maximum and the minimum, the function crosses zero when the argument is π. Because sin(π) = 0. So maybe wx + φ = π.Let me check. Let&#39;s suppose that at x = 3π/2, the function is zero. Therefore:f(3π/2) = √2 sin(w*(3π/2) + φ) = 0.So sin(w*(3π/2) + φ) = 0. Therefore, w*(3π/2) + φ = nπ, where n is an integer.Similarly, we have from the maximum at x = π/2:w*(π/2) + φ = π/2 + 2πk.Let me consider n and k. Let&#39;s pick n = 1, maybe. Let&#39;s see.From the zero crossing:w*(3π/2) + φ = π + 2πm, where m is an integer. Because sin(θ) = 0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, etc. Since the function is going from maximum to minimum, the zero crossing in between would be when the argument is π. So perhaps m = 0, so:w*(3π/2) + φ = π.From the maximum, we have:w*(π/2) + φ = π/2.So we have two equations:1) (wπ/2) + φ = π/22) (3wπ/2) + φ = πLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:[3wπ/2 + φ] - [wπ/2 + φ] = π - π/2(3wπ/2 - wπ/2) = π/2(2wπ/2) = π/2wπ = π/2 =&gt; w = 1/2.So w is 1/2. Then, substitute back into equation 1:( (1/2)*π/2 ) + φ = π/2( π/4 ) + φ = π/2φ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4.So φ is π/4, which is within (-π/2, π/2), so that&#39;s okay.Therefore, A = √2, w = 1/2, φ = π/4.So f(x) = √2 sin( (1/2)x + π/4 ). Let me check if this works.At x = π/2:(1/2)(π/2) + π/4 = π/4 + π/4 = π/2. sin(π/2) = 1. So √2*1 = √2. Correct, the maximum is there.At x = 3π/2:(1/2)(3π/2) + π/4 = 3π/4 + π/4 = π. sin(π) = 0. Correct, the x-intercept is there.Then, the next minimum should be at x = π/2 + π/w. Wait, w = 1/2, so π/w = 2π. So π/2 + 2π = 5π/2. Wait, but the next minimum would be when the argument is 3π/2:(1/2)x + π/4 = 3π/2Multiply both sides by 2:x + π/2 = 3πx = 3π - π/2 = 5π/2. Yes, so that&#39;s correct. So between π/2 and 5π/2, the function goes from maximum to minimum, crossing zero at π. But according to the problem, it crosses the x-axis at 3π/2. Wait, 3π/2 is 3π/2, not π. Wait, there&#39;s a problem here.Wait, when I plugged x = 3π/2 into the equation, I got sin(π) = 0, which is correct. But in the standard sine function, between the maximum at π/2 and the minimum at 5π/2, the zero crossing is at π. But according to the problem, the zero crossing is at 3π/2. Wait, this seems contradictory.Wait, maybe my assumption about which zero crossing is happening here is wrong. Let me think again.Wait, let&#39;s plot the function f(x) = √2 sin( (1/2)x + π/4 ).The phase shift is π/4, so the function is shifted left by π/4 divided by w. Since w = 1/2, the phase shift is φ/w = (π/4)/(1/2) = π/2. So the function is shifted left by π/2. So the original sine function without phase shift would be sin( (1/2)x ), but shifted left by π/2.But maybe that&#39;s complicating. Alternatively, let&#39;s look at the critical points. The maximum at π/2, then the next zero crossing at 3π/2. Then the minimum at 5π/2. But wait, the distance from π/2 to 3π/2 is π, and from 3π/2 to 5π/2 is another π. So the period is 4π? Wait, because the period is 2π/w. w = 1/2, so period is 2π/(1/2) = 4π. That&#39;s correct. So the function has a period of 4π. Therefore, between π/2 (maximum) and 5π/2 (minimum), the zero crossing is at 3π/2. That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s given. So that is correct.So the function is f(x) = √2 sin( (1/2)x + π/4 ). So part (1) is solved. Let me just write that as the answer.For part (2), find the range of f(x) on [0, π]. So we need to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [0, π].First, let&#39;s consider the function f(x) = √2 sin( (1/2)x + π/4 ). Let&#39;s find its critical points in [0, π] by taking the derivative.f&#39;(x) = √2 * (1/2) cos( (1/2)x + π/4 ) = (√2/2) cos( (1/2)x + π/4 )Set derivative to zero:cos( (1/2)x + π/4 ) = 0So (1/2)x + π/4 = π/2 + kπ, k integer.Solve for x:(1/2)x = π/2 - π/4 + kπ = π/4 + kπMultiply both sides by 2:x = π/2 + 2kπSo critical points at x = π/2 + 2kπ. Within [0, π], the only critical point is x = π/2. Because if k = 0, x = π/2. If k = 1, x = π/2 + 2π, which is outside [0, π]. So the only critical point in [0, π] is at x = π/2, which is the maximum given in the problem.Therefore, the maximum on [0, π] is at x = π/2, which is √2. The minimum would be at one of the endpoints, x = 0 or x = π.Compute f(0):√2 sin( (0) + π/4 ) = √2 sin(π/4) = √2*(√2/2) = 1.Compute f(π):√2 sin( (1/2)π + π/4 ) = √2 sin( π/2 + π/4 ) = √2 sin(3π/4) = √2*(√2/2) = 1.Wait, so both endpoints are 1. The maximum is √2 at π/2, and the minimum is 1? That can&#39;t be right. Wait, sin(3π/4) is √2/2, so √2*(√2/2) = (2)/2 = 1. Correct.But that&#39;s strange because the function has a maximum of √2 at π/2 and both endpoints at 1. So the range would be [1, √2]. Wait, but is that the case? Let me check.Wait, maybe there&#39;s another critical point I missed. Wait, we found critical points at x = π/2 + 2kπ. But in the interval [0, π], only x = π/2 is present. So the function increases from x=0 to x=π/2, reaching the maximum, then decreases from x=π/2 to x=π. But since both endpoints are at 1, then the minimum on the interval is 1, and the maximum is √2. Therefore, the range is [1, √2].Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute f(x) at a point between π/2 and π, say at x = 3π/4.f(3π/4) = √2 sin( (1/2)(3π/4) + π/4 ) = √2 sin( 3π/8 + π/4 ) = √2 sin(5π/8). 5π/8 is in the second quadrant, sin(5π/8) is sin(π - 3π/8) = sin(3π/8) ≈ 0.9239. Therefore, √2 * 0.9239 ≈ 1.306, which is between 1 and √2 (~1.414). So indeed, the function decreases from √2 at π/2 to 1 at π. Similarly, from 0 to π/2, it goes from 1 to √2. Therefore, the range is [1, √2].So part (2)&#39;s answer is [1, √2].For part (3), we need to find the range of m such that |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 for all x in [0, π]. So |√2 sin( (1/2)x + π/4 ) - m| &lt; 2. Which must hold for all x in [0, π].First, let&#39;s understand what this inequality means. For all x in [0, π], the value f(x) is within (m - 2, m + 2). So the entire range of f(x) on [0, π] must lie within the interval (m - 2, m + 2). From part (2), the range of f(x) is [1, √2]. Therefore, we need [1, √2] ⊂ (m - 2, m + 2). So the interval (m - 2, m + 2) must contain the interval [1, √2].Therefore, m - 2 &lt; 1 and m + 2 &gt; √2. Wait, but since (m - 2, m + 2) needs to cover [1, √2], the lower bound of (m - 2) must be less than 1, and the upper bound (m + 2) must be greater than √2. However, also, the entire interval [1, √2] must lie within (m - 2, m + 2). So:m - 2 &lt; 1 and m + 2 &gt; √2.But that&#39;s not sufficient. For example, if m - 2 is less than 1, but m + 2 could be just slightly larger than √2, but maybe 1 is still inside (m - 2, m + 2). Wait, but since the entire interval [1, √2] must be inside (m - 2, m + 2), we need:m - 2 &lt; 1 and m + 2 &gt; √2.But also, m - 2 must be less than the lower bound of f(x), which is 1, and m + 2 must be greater than the upper bound of f(x), which is √2. Wait, no. Wait, if [1, √2] must be a subset of (m - 2, m + 2), then:The entire interval [1, √2] must be between m - 2 and m + 2. Therefore:m - 2 &lt; 1 and m + 2 &gt; √2.But also, we need that the lower bound of (m - 2, m + 2) is less than 1, and the upper bound is greater than √2. However, since (m - 2, m + 2) is an open interval, we need to make sure that 1 and √2 are strictly inside this interval.Therefore:m - 2 &lt; 1 and m + 2 &gt; √2Solving these inequalities:From first inequality: m &lt; 3From second inequality: m &gt; √2 - 2But √2 ≈ 1.414, so √2 - 2 ≈ -0.586Therefore, m must be in (√2 - 2, 3). But since the problem states that the inequality must hold for all x in [0, π], we need to check if this is indeed sufficient.Wait, but let&#39;s verify. Suppose m is in (√2 - 2, 3). Then:The lower bound of the interval (m - 2, m + 2) is m - 2. Since m &gt; √2 - 2, then m - 2 &gt; (√2 - 2) - 2 = √2 - 4 ≈ -2.586. But we need m - 2 &lt; 1, so m &lt; 3, which is already considered.But the critical points are 1 and √2. To have [1, √2] ⊂ (m - 2, m + 2), we need:m - 2 &lt; 1 and m + 2 &gt; √2Which gives m &lt; 3 and m &gt; √2 - 2. Therefore, m ∈ (√2 - 2, 3). But wait, let&#39;s see with m=2. Let&#39;s take m=2. Then the interval (0, 4). The range [1, √2] is within (0,4), which is true. If m=1, interval (-1, 3). The range [1, √2] is within (-1,3). That&#39;s okay. If m=√2 - 2 + ε, where ε is a small positive number, then the upper bound is (√2 - 2 + ε) + 2 = √2 + ε, which is just above √2. The lower bound is (√2 - 2 + ε) - 2 = √2 - 4 + ε. Since √2 ≈1.414, √2 -4 ≈-2.586, which is less than 1, so [1, √2] is inside (√2 -4 + ε, √2 + ε). But since √2 + ε must be greater than √2, but the upper bound of the range is √2, so as long as m + 2 &gt; √2, which is m &gt; √2 - 2, then upper part is okay. Similarly, since m - 2 can be very low, but as long as it is less than 1, which is already satisfied because m &lt; 3. So even if m - 2 is less than 1, the lower bound of the range [1, √2] is 1, so as long as m - 2 &lt; 1, which is m &lt; 3, then 1 is inside (m - 2, m + 2). Similarly, since m + 2 &gt; √2, √2 is inside (m -2, m +2). Therefore, the entire interval [1, √2] is inside (m -2, m +2) when m ∈ (√2 - 2, 3). Therefore, the range of m is (√2 - 2, 3). But since m is a real number, and the inequality is strict (i.e., &lt; 2), the interval is open.But let me confirm with an example. Let m = √2 - 2 + 0.1. Then m ≈ -0.586 + 0.1 ≈ -0.486. Then m -2 ≈ -2.486, m +2 ≈ 1.514. The range [1, 1.414] is inside (-2.486, 1.514)? Wait, but 1.414 &gt; 1.514? No, 1.514 is approximately m +2, which is √2 - 2 + 0.1 + 2 ≈ √2 + 0.1 ≈ 1.514. But √2 is about 1.414, so 1.514 is greater than √2. Therefore, the upper bound is 1.514, which is greater than √2, so √2 is inside. The lower bound is -2.486, so 1 is greater than that. So the interval [1, √2] is inside (-2.486, 1.514). Wait, but √2 ≈1.414 is less than 1.514, so it&#39;s inside. Similarly, 1 is inside since 1 &gt; -2.486. So yes, it works.Another example: m = 2.9. Then m -2 = 0.9, m +2 = 4.9. The interval (0.9, 4.9). The range [1, √2] is inside (0.9, 4.9). Correct.But if m = √2 - 2 exactly, then m +2 = √2, so the interval becomes (√2 - 2 -2, √2) = (√2 -4, √2). The upper bound is √2, but since the original range is [1, √2], the point √2 is not inside the open interval (√2 -4, √2), since √2 is excluded. Therefore, m must be greater than √2 - 2. Similarly, if m = 3, the interval is (1, 5). The original range [1, √2] is not entirely inside (1,5) because 1 is excluded. Therefore, m must be less than 3. So the open interval (√2 -2, 3).Therefore, the range of m is (√2 -2, 3).But let me check another edge case. Suppose m = 1. Then the interval is (-1, 3). The range [1, √2] is inside (-1, 3). Since 1 is included in (-1,3) and √2 ≈1.414 is also included. So that works. Similarly, m=1.5, interval (-0.5, 3.5). Also works.So I think the correct range is (√2 -2, 3). Therefore, part (3)&#39;s answer is (√2 -2, 3).Final Answer(1) The expression for ( f(x) ) is (boxed{sqrt{2} sinleft(frac{1}{2}x + frac{pi}{4}right)}).(2) The range of ( f(x) ) on ([0, pi]) is (boxed{[1, sqrt{2}]}).(3) The range of the real number ( m ) is (boxed{(sqrt{2} - 2, 3)}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = A sin(wx + phi) ) with ( A &gt; 0 ), ( w &gt; 0 ), and ( phi in left(-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right) ):1. Finding the expression for ( f(x) ):   - The maximum value of the function is ( sqrt{2} ), so ( A = sqrt{2} ).   - The maximum occurs at ( x = frac{pi}{2} ), leading to the equation ( w left(frac{pi}{2}right) + phi = frac{pi}{2} ).   - The function intersects the x-axis at ( x = frac{3pi}{2} ), leading to the equation ( w left(frac{3pi}{2}right) + phi = pi ).   - Solving these equations, we find ( w = frac{1}{2} ) and ( phi = frac{pi}{4} ).   - Therefore, the function is ( f(x) = sqrt{2} sinleft(frac{1}{2}x + frac{pi}{4}right) ).2. Finding the range of ( f(x) ) on ([0, pi]):   - The critical points in ([0, pi]) are at ( x = frac{pi}{2} ) (maximum) and the endpoints ( x = 0 ) and ( x = pi ).   - Evaluating ( f(x) ) at these points, we find ( f(0) = 1 ), ( fleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = sqrt{2} ), and ( f(pi) = 1 ).   - Therefore, the range of ( f(x) ) on ([0, pi]) is ([1, sqrt{2}]).3. Finding the range of ( m ):   - The inequality ( |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 ) must hold for all ( x in [0, pi] ).   - The range of ( f(x) ) is ([1, sqrt{2}]), so this interval must lie within ( (m - 2, m + 2) ).   - Solving ( m - 2 &lt; 1 ) and ( m + 2 &gt; sqrt{2} ), we find ( m in (sqrt{2} - 2, 3) ).Final Answers:1. The expression for ( f(x) ) is (boxed{sqrt{2} sinleft(frac{1}{2}x + frac{pi}{4}right)}).2. The range of ( f(x) ) on ([0, pi]) is (boxed{[1, sqrt{2}]}).3. The range of the real number ( m ) is (boxed{(sqrt{2} - 2, 3)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a function f(x) = A sin(wx + φ), where A is positive, w is positive, and φ is between -π/2 and π/2. The function has a maximum at (π/2, √2), and between this maximum and the adjacent minimum, the curve intersects the x-axis at (3π/2, 0). We need to find the expression for f(x), its range on [0, π], and the range of m such that |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 for all x in [0, π].Starting with part (1): finding f(x). Let&#39;s recall that the general sine function is A sin(wx + φ), which has amplitude A, angular frequency w, and phase shift φ. The maximum value of the sine function is A, so if there&#39;s a maximum at (π/2, √2), that suggests A = √2? Wait, but maybe not necessarily. Wait, the maximum of the sine function is indeed A, so if the maximum point is at √2, then A must be √2. Let me confirm: the maximum value of A sin(θ) is A, so yes, if the maximum is √2, then A = √2. So that&#39;s one parameter found.Next, the function has a maximum at x = π/2. The sine function reaches its maximum when its argument is π/2 + 2πk, where k is an integer. So, for f(x) = A sin(wx + φ), the maximum occurs when wx + φ = π/2 + 2πk. Since this maximum is at x = π/2, plugging in, we get w*(π/2) + φ = π/2 + 2πk. Hmm, but we don&#39;t know k. However, since the problem says &quot;adjacent minimum point&quot; intersects the x-axis at 3π/2, maybe the period can be determined from the distance between maximum and minimum?Wait, between a maximum and the adjacent minimum, the x-distance is half the period. Because the sine function goes from maximum to minimum in half a period. So if the maximum is at π/2, then the adjacent minimum would be at π/2 + (T/2), where T is the period. Then, the curve from the maximum to the minimum intersects the x-axis at 3π/2. So the point where it crosses the x-axis is between π/2 and π/2 + T/2. Wait, but the given intersection is at (3π/2, 0). Let&#39;s see.If the maximum is at π/2, and the adjacent minimum is at π/2 + T/2, then between these two points, the curve crosses the x-axis once. The midpoint between maximum and minimum would be the point where the sine curve crosses the equilibrium point (the x-axis if there&#39;s no vertical shift). Wait, but if the maximum is at (π/2, √2) and the minimum is at (π/2 + T/2, -√2), then halfway between π/2 and π/2 + T/2 would be π/2 + T/4. If the crossing point is at 3π/2, then π/2 + T/4 = 3π/2. Therefore, T/4 = π, so T = 4π. Therefore, the period is 4π. Since period T = 2π/w, so 4π = 2π/w ⇒ w = 2π/(4π) = 1/2. So w = 1/2.Wait, let&#39;s check this again. If the maximum is at π/2, then the adjacent minimum is T/2 after that, so at π/2 + T/2. The curve crosses the x-axis between π/2 and π/2 + T/2. If that crossing is at 3π/2, then the time from π/2 to 3π/2 is π. So the time from maximum to x-intercept is π. In a standard sine curve, from maximum to x-intercept is T/4. So in this case, T/4 = π ⇒ T = 4π. Then, yes, w = 2π / T = 2π / 4π = 1/2. So w is 1/2. So that gives us w.So far, we have A = √2, w = 1/2, so the function is √2 sin(x/2 + φ). Now, we need to find φ. We know that at x = π/2, the function reaches its maximum. So substituting x = π/2 into the argument of sine: (1/2)(π/2) + φ = π/2 + 2πk. Let&#39;s compute that:(1/2)(π/2) = π/4. So π/4 + φ = π/2 + 2πk. Solving for φ: φ = π/2 - π/4 + 2πk = π/4 + 2πk. But φ is given to be between -π/2 and π/2. So k = 0 gives φ = π/4, which is within (-π/2, π/2). If k were 1, φ would be π/4 + 2π, which is outside the range. If k = -1, φ = π/4 - 2π, also outside. So φ = π/4.Therefore, the function is f(x) = √2 sin(x/2 + π/4). Let me verify this.First, check that at x = π/2, the function is maximum. Let&#39;s compute f(π/2) = √2 sin( (π/2)/2 + π/4 ) = √2 sin(π/4 + π/4) = √2 sin(π/2) = √2 * 1 = √2. Correct. So that&#39;s the maximum. Then, the next minimum point should be at x = π/2 + T/2 = π/2 + 4π/2 = π/2 + 2π = 5π/2. Wait, but the curve intersects the x-axis at 3π/2. Wait, maybe my earlier reasoning about the period was incorrect.Wait, if the period is 4π, then the function completes a full cycle every 4π. So from the maximum at π/2, the next minimum would be at π/2 + 2π (half period), which is 5π/2. However, the curve crosses the x-axis at 3π/2, which is between π/2 and 5π/2. Let&#39;s check where the function crosses zero.Set f(x) = 0: √2 sin(x/2 + π/4) = 0 ⇒ sin(x/2 + π/4) = 0 ⇒ x/2 + π/4 = nπ ⇒ x/2 = nπ - π/4 ⇒ x = 2nπ - π/2. So for n = 1, x = 2π - π/2 = 3π/2. So the zero crossing is at 3π/2. So between π/2 and 5π/2, the zero crossing is at 3π/2. So that&#39;s correct. The maximum is at π/2, then crosses zero at 3π/2, then goes to minimum at 5π/2. So the intersection point given is correct. Therefore, this function satisfies the given conditions. So the answer to part (1) is f(x) = √2 sin(x/2 + π/4).Now, part (2): Find the range of f(x) on [0, π]. So we need to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [0, π]. Since f(x) is a sinusoidal function, its range over an interval can be found by looking at critical points and endpoints.First, let&#39;s note that the function is f(x) = √2 sin(x/2 + π/4). The derivative is f’(x) = √2 * (1/2) cos(x/2 + π/4) = (√2 / 2) cos(x/2 + π/4). To find critical points, set f’(x) = 0:cos(x/2 + π/4) = 0 ⇒ x/2 + π/4 = π/2 + kπ ⇒ x/2 = π/2 - π/4 + kπ ⇒ x/2 = π/4 + kπ ⇒ x = π/2 + 2kπ.Within the interval [0, π], possible critical points occur when k = 0: x = π/2. For k = 1: x = π/2 + 2π, which is outside [0, π]. For k = -1: x = π/2 - 2π, also outside. So the only critical point in [0, π] is x = π/2, which is already given as the maximum point. Then, we need to check the endpoints x = 0 and x = π, as well as the critical point x = π/2.Compute f(0): √2 sin(0 + π/4) = √2 sin(π/4) = √2*(√2/2) = 1.Compute f(π/2): √2 sin(π/4 + π/4) = √2 sin(π/2) = √2*1 = √2.Compute f(π): √2 sin(π/2 + π/4) = √2 sin(3π/4) = √2*(√2/2) = 1.Wait, so the maximum value on [0, π] is √2 at x = π/2, and the minimum values are 1 at both endpoints x = 0 and x = π. So the range is [1, √2]. Hmm, but let me confirm if there are any other minima or maxima.Wait, we found that the only critical point in [0, π] is x = π/2, which is the maximum. The function is increasing from 0 to π/2, then decreasing from π/2 to π. Therefore, the minimums are indeed at the endpoints. So yes, the range is [1, √2].But wait, let&#39;s verify the value at x = π. Plugging x = π into f(x): √2 sin(π/2 + π/4) = √2 sin(3π/4) = √2*(√2/2) = 1. So yes, correct. So the minimum is 1, maximum √2. Therefore, the range is [1, √2].Now part (3): If for any real number x, the inequality |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 always holds on [0, π], find the range of m. Wait, but the problem says &quot;for any real number x, the inequality |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 always holds on [0, π]&quot;. So m must be chosen such that |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 for all x in [0, π]. So we need to find all real numbers m such that the distance between f(x) and m is less than 2 for all x in [0, π].First, since f(x) has range [1, √2] on [0, π], then f(x) varies between 1 and √2. So the maximum value of f(x) is √2 ≈ 1.414, and the minimum is 1. So |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 for all x in [0, π]. That inequality can be rewritten as -2 &lt; f(x) - m &lt; 2 ⇒ f(x) - 2 &lt; m &lt; f(x) + 2. But since this must hold for all x in [0, π], m must be greater than f(x) - 2 for all x, and less than f(x) + 2 for all x. Therefore, m must be greater than the maximum of (f(x) - 2) over [0, π], and less than the minimum of (f(x) + 2) over [0, π].So first, compute max{f(x) - 2} over [0, π]. Since f(x) is between 1 and √2, f(x) - 2 is between 1 - 2 = -1 and √2 - 2 ≈ -0.5858. So the maximum of f(x) - 2 is √2 - 2 ≈ -0.5858.Similarly, compute min{f(x) + 2} over [0, π]. Since f(x) is between 1 and √2, f(x) + 2 is between 1 + 2 = 3 and √2 + 2 ≈ 3.414. The minimum of these is 3.Therefore, m must satisfy:max{f(x) - 2} &lt; m &lt; min{f(x) + 2}Which is:√2 - 2 &lt; m &lt; 3But wait, the problem says |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 for all x in [0, π]. So the condition is equivalent to m being in the interval (f(x) - 2, f(x) + 2) for every x. So m must lie in the intersection of all these intervals for x in [0, π]. The intersection of intervals (f(x) - 2, f(x) + 2) across x in [0, π] is (max_x {f(x) - 2}, min_x {f(x) + 2}).Since f(x) ranges from 1 to √2:- The maximum of f(x) - 2 is √2 - 2.- The minimum of f(x) + 2 is 1 + 2 = 3.Therefore, the intersection interval is (√2 - 2, 3). But the inequality is strict: |f(x) - m| &lt; 2, so m cannot equal √2 - 2 or 3. However, since √2 - 2 ≈ -0.5858 and 3 is 3, so the range of m is (√2 - 2, 3).But let me confirm. If m is greater than √2 - 2 and less than 3, then for all x in [0, π], |f(x) - m| &lt; 2. Let&#39;s check the extremes.When f(x) is at its minimum, 1. Then |1 - m| &lt; 2 ⇒ -2 &lt; 1 - m &lt; 2 ⇒ -3 &lt; -m &lt; 1 ⇒ -1 &lt; m &lt; 3. But since m has to satisfy this for all x, when f(x) is at its maximum, √2. So |√2 - m| &lt; 2 ⇒ -2 &lt; √2 - m &lt; 2 ⇒ √2 - 2 &lt; m &lt; √2 + 2. So intersecting the two intervals:From the minimum f(x)=1: m ∈ (-1, 3)From the maximum f(x)=√2: m ∈ (√2 - 2, √2 + 2) ≈ (-0.586, 3.414)The intersection of these two is (√2 - 2, 3), because √2 - 2 ≈ -0.586 is greater than -1, and 3 is less than √2 + 2 ≈ 3.414. Therefore, m must be greater than √2 - 2 and less than 3. Hence, the range is (√2 - 2, 3). Since the original problem says &quot;the inequality |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 always holds&quot;, m must lie in this open interval.Therefore, part (3) answer is (√2 - 2, 3).Let me recap all steps to check for errors.Part (1): Correctly found A = √2 from maximum value. Determined w by considering the distance from maximum to x-intercept as half-period? Wait, earlier reasoning was that between maximum and adjacent minimum, the curve crosses the x-axis at 3π/2. The maximum is at π/2, then crosses zero at 3π/2. Then from maximum to zero is a quarter period? Wait, in a sine wave, from maximum to zero is T/4. So from π/2 to 3π/2 is a distance of π, which would be T/4. Therefore, T/4 = π ⇒ T = 4π. Hence, w = 2π / T = 2π / 4π = 1/2. Correct. Then phase shift φ: using the maximum at x = π/2, we set (1/2)(π/2) + φ = π/2 + 2πk. Solving gives φ = π/4. All steps correct. Hence f(x) = √2 sin(x/2 + π/4).Part (2): Calculated range on [0, π]. Checked critical points, found maximum at π/2, and endpoints at 0 and π. Values at 0 and π are 1, maximum at √2. So range [1, √2]. Correct.Part (3): To ensure |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 for all x in [0, π]. Found that m must be greater than the maximum of (f(x) - 2) and less than the minimum of (f(x) + 2). Since f(x) ranges from 1 to √2, maximum of (f(x) - 2) is √2 - 2, minimum of (f(x) + 2) is 3. Hence, m ∈ (√2 - 2, 3). Correct.Thus, all three parts seem correct.Final Answer(1) boxed{f(x) = sqrt{2} sinleft( frac{x}{2} + frac{pi}{4} right)}(2) boxed{[1, sqrt{2}]}(3) boxed{(sqrt{2} - 2, 3)}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = Asin(wx + phi) ) with ( A &gt; 0 ), ( w &gt; 0 ), and ( phi in left( -frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2} right) ), we need to find the expression for ( f(x) ), the range of ( f(x) ) on ( [0, pi] ), and the range of ( m ) such that ( |f(x) - m| &lt; 2 ) for all ( x in [0, pi] ).1.

Let me start by recalling what sufficient and necessary conditions mean. A sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the statement must be true, but the statement might also be true even if the condition isn&#39;t met. A necessary condition means that if the statement is true, then the condition must have been met, but meeting the condition doesn&#39;t necessarily guarantee the statement is true. If it&#39;s both necessary and sufficient, then they imply each other. If it&#39;s neither, then the condition doesn&#39;t really affect the statement in either direction.First, let&#39;s consider the given condition a + b = 1. The problem is asking whether this condition is sufficient, necessary, etc., for 4ab ≤ 1. So maybe I should explore the relationship between a + b and ab. I remember that for real numbers a and b, there&#39;s the AM-GM inequality, which states that (a + b)/2 ≥ √(ab), but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I can express ab in terms of a + b. Let me try that.If a + b = 1, then we can express ab in terms of one variable. Let me set b = 1 - a. Then ab = a(1 - a) = a - a². So 4ab = 4a - 4a². Now, let&#39;s find the maximum value of 4ab given a + b = 1. To find the maximum of 4a - 4a², take the derivative with respect to a: d/da (4a - 4a²) = 4 - 8a. Setting this equal to zero gives a = 4/8 = 1/2. So the maximum occurs at a = 1/2, which gives b = 1/2. Then 4ab = 4*(1/2)*(1/2) = 4*(1/4) = 1. So when a + b = 1, the maximum value of 4ab is 1. Therefore, 4ab ≤ 1 whenever a + b = 1. So this tells me that a + b = 1 is a sufficient condition for 4ab ≤ 1, because whenever a + b = 1 holds, 4ab is at most 1.But is it a necessary condition? In other words, does 4ab ≤ 1 imply that a + b must equal 1? To check this, I need to see if there are real numbers a and b where a + b ≠ 1 but 4ab ≤ 1 still holds. For example, take a = 0 and b = 0. Then 4ab = 0 ≤ 1, and a + b = 0 ≠ 1. So here, 4ab ≤ 1 is true, but a + b = 1 is false. Therefore, the condition a + b = 1 is not necessary. Therefore, the answer should be A: Sufficient but not necessary condition.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there&#39;s a case where even if a + b is not 1, 4ab can still be greater than 1. For example, take a = 2 and b = 2. Then a + b = 4, and ab = 4, so 4ab = 16, which is way greater than 1. So in that case, 4ab exceeds 1 even when a + b isn&#39;t 1. But the point is, the condition a + b = 1 ensures 4ab ≤ 1, but there are other cases where 4ab ≤ 1 without a + b being 1. So indeed, a + b = 1 is sufficient but not necessary.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to characterize all real numbers a and b where 4ab ≤ 1. Maybe there&#39;s a relationship here. Suppose we fix a + b = s. Then, similar to earlier, ab can be expressed as (s² - (a - b)²)/4. But since (a - b)² is always non-negative, ab ≤ s²/4. Therefore, 4ab ≤ s². So, if we want 4ab ≤ 1, then s² ≥ 4ab. Wait, this might not be the right direction. Wait, if 4ab ≤ s², then for 4ab ≤ 1, it suffices that s² ≥ 4ab, but I need to reverse that. Wait, maybe not. Let me see. If I have 4ab ≤ s², then if s² ≤ 1, then 4ab ≤ 1. Wait, no, this is getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently.Suppose we consider variables a and b. Let&#39;s fix ab. To maximize 4ab given a + b = s, we saw that the maximum is s². Wait, no. Wait, if a + b = s, then the maximum of ab is s²/4. Therefore, 4ab ≤ s². So if s² ≤ 1, then 4ab ≤ s² ≤ 1. Therefore, if a + b = s and s² ≤ 1, then 4ab ≤ 1. So in that case, a + b being less than or equal to 1 in absolute value (since s is real, s² ≤1 implies |s| ≤1) would make 4ab ≤1. But the original problem says &quot;a + b =1&quot;. Wait, but s here is a + b. So if a + b =1, then s =1, so 4ab ≤1. So that&#39;s the case where s=1. But if s is something else, like s=0, then 4ab ≤0, which is also ≤1, but s=0. So in that case, a + b=0 would still satisfy 4ab ≤1. So even if a + b is not 1, 4ab can still be ≤1. Therefore, the condition a + b =1 is only a sufficient condition, not necessary.Alternatively, maybe if I approach this by considering the inequality 4ab ≤1. Let&#39;s see what values of a and b satisfy this. Let&#39;s rearrange it as ab ≤1/4. So the product of a and b is at most 1/4. So, for example, if a and b are both non-negative, then by AM-GM, (a + b)/2 ≥√(ab), so ab ≤ (a + b)² /4. So if (a + b)² /4 ≥ ab, then 4ab ≤ (a + b)². Therefore, if (a + b)² ≥4ab, which is always true, but to have 4ab ≤1, it suffices that (a + b)² ≥4ab and 4ab ≤1. Wait, this seems redundant. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps if I fix ab ≤1/4. Then, if I want to relate this to a + b, maybe for different values of a + b, the maximum ab can be different. For example, as we saw, when a + b =1, the maximum ab is 1/4, so 4ab is 1. So in that case, 4ab ≤1 is exactly achieved when a = b =1/2. But if a + b is larger than 1, say a + b =2, then the maximum ab is (2)^2 /4 =1, so 4ab would be 4*1=4, which is greater than 1. So in this case, when a + b is larger, you can have 4ab exceeding 1. On the other hand, if a + b is smaller, say a + b=0, then ab can be negative, so 4ab could be negative, which is ≤1. So in such cases, even with a + b not equal to1, 4ab can be ≤1. So the key is, when a + b is fixed at 1, the maximum ab is 1/4, so 4ab is exactly 1, and otherwise, depending on a + b, 4ab can be higher or lower.But since when a + b=1, 4ab ≤1 always holds, but even when a + b is not 1, 4ab can be ≤1 (for example, when a and b are both 0, a + b=0, 4ab=0≤1). Therefore, the condition a + b=1 is sufficient, but not necessary. So the answer is A.Wait, but maybe to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there are cases where a + b=1 but 4ab is not ≤1. Wait, no. When a + b=1, the maximum ab is 1/4, so 4ab is 1. So 4ab=1 in that case. So 4ab is exactly 1 when a =b=1/2, and less than 1 otherwise. So when a + b=1, 4ab ≤1 holds. So that&#39;s sufficient. But necessary? Since as we saw, there are cases where a + b is not 1, but 4ab ≤1. So not necessary. Therefore, A is correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to see if a + b=1 is necessary. Suppose 4ab ≤1. Does that imply that a + b=1? Well, take a=0, b=0. Then 4ab=0≤1, but a + b=0≠1. So no, it&#39;s not necessary. Therefore, the answer is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given (a, b in mathbb{R}), we need to determine whether the condition (a + b = 1) is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for (4ab leq 1).1. Sufficient Condition Check:   - If (a + b = 1), we can express (ab) in terms of one variable. Let (b = 1 - a), then (ab = a(1 - a) = a - a^2).   - The expression (4ab = 4a - 4a^2). To find the maximum value, take the derivative: (frac{d}{da}(4a - 4a^2) = 4 - 8a). Setting this to zero gives (a = frac{1}{2}).   - At (a = frac{1}{2}), (b = frac{1}{2}), so (4ab = 4 left(frac{1}{2}right) left(frac{1}{2}right) = 1). Therefore, (4ab leq 1) when (a + b = 1). Hence, (a + b = 1) is a sufficient condition.2. Necessary Condition Check:   - We need to check if (4ab leq 1) implies (a + b = 1). Consider (a = 0) and (b = 0). Here, (4ab = 0 leq 1) but (a + b = 0 neq 1). Thus, (a + b = 1) is not a necessary condition.3. Conclusion:   - The condition (a + b = 1) is sufficient because it guarantees (4ab leq 1), but it is not necessary because (4ab leq 1) can hold without (a + b = 1).Thus, the answer is (boxed{A}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out whether the condition &quot;a + b = 1&quot; is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither for the inequality &quot;4ab ≤ 1&quot; to hold. Let me start by recalling what these terms mean. A sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the statement is definitely true. However, the statement might also be true even if the condition isn&#39;t met. On the other hand, a necessary condition means that if the statement is true, then the condition must have been met. So, necessary is like a requirement, but just meeting the requirement doesn&#39;t necessarily guarantee the statement. If it&#39;s both necessary and sufficient, then they imply each other. If it&#39;s neither, then the condition doesn&#39;t really affect the statement in a direct way.Alright, let&#39;s get into the problem. The statement in question is &quot;4ab ≤ 1&quot;, and we need to see how &quot;a + b = 1&quot; relates to it. First, let&#39;s consider if &quot;a + b = 1&quot; is a sufficient condition. That would mean that whenever a + b = 1, then 4ab must be ≤ 1. Let&#39;s test that. If a + b = 1, can we express ab in terms of a or b? Maybe using substitution. Let me set b = 1 - a. Then ab = a(1 - a) = a - a². So 4ab = 4(a - a²) = 4a - 4a². Let&#39;s see if this expression is always ≤ 1. To find the maximum of 4a - 4a², since it&#39;s a quadratic function opening downward (because the coefficient of a² is negative), the vertex will give the maximum value. The vertex of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, the quadratic is -4a² + 4a, so a = -4, b = 4. Therefore, the maximum occurs at a = -4/(2*(-4)) = -4 / (-8) = 0.5. Plugging a = 0.5 into 4ab: 4*(0.5)*(1 - 0.5) = 4*(0.5)*(0.5) = 4*(0.25) = 1. So the maximum value of 4ab when a + b = 1 is 1. Therefore, 4ab ≤ 1 is always true if a + b = 1. So that means &quot;a + b = 1&quot; is a sufficient condition for &quot;4ab ≤ 1&quot; because whenever a + b =1, 4ab is ≤1.But now, is it a necessary condition? That would mean that if 4ab ≤1, then a + b must equal 1. To check this, we need to see if there are real numbers a and b where 4ab ≤1 but a + b ≠1. For example, take a = 0 and b = 0. Then 4ab = 0 ≤1, but a + b = 0 ≠1. So that&#39;s a counterexample. Therefore, &quot;a + b =1&quot; is not a necessary condition. Therefore, the answer should be A: Sufficient but not necessary condition.Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I need to consider other possibilities. Let&#39;s see another example. Suppose a = 2 and b = 0. Then 4ab = 0 ≤1, and a + b =2 ≠1. So again, 4ab ≤1 but a + b ≠1. So yes, definitely not necessary. Therefore, the answer is A. But just to be thorough, is there a case where 4ab &gt;1? Let&#39;s take a = 2 and b = 2. Then 4ab = 16 &gt;1. But here a + b =4 ≠1. But what if a and b are such that a + b is something else but 4ab still exceeds 1? For example, a = 3 and b =1. Then ab =3, 4ab=12&gt;1. But a + b=4. So even when a + b is not 1, 4ab can be greater than 1. So, the inequality 4ab ≤1 can hold or not hold independently of a + b. So the condition a + b=1 is sufficient to guarantee 4ab ≤1, but not necessary because 4ab can be ≤1 even when a + b is not 1. Therefore, A is correct.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether the condition (a + b = 1) is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither for the inequality (4ab leq 1), we analyze the relationship between these two statements.1. Sufficient Condition Check:   - If (a + b = 1), we substitute (b = 1 - a) into the expression (4ab):     [     4ab = 4a(1 - a) = 4a - 4a^2     ]   - This quadratic function (4a - 4a^2) opens downward, with its maximum at (a = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{-4}{2(-4)} = 0.5).   - Substituting (a = 0.5) into (4ab) gives:     [     4 cdot 0.5 cdot (1 - 0.5) = 1     ]   - Thus, the maximum value of (4ab) when (a + b = 1) is 1, meaning (4ab leq 1) is always true. Therefore, (a + b = 1) is a sufficient condition.2. Necessary Condition Check:   - We need to check if (4ab leq 1) implies (a + b = 1). Consider counterexamples:     - If (a = 0) and (b = 0), then (4ab = 0 leq 1) but (a + b = 0 neq 1).     - If (a = 2) and (b = 0), then (4ab = 0 leq 1) but (a + b = 2 neq 1).   - These examples show that (4ab leq 1) can hold without (a + b = 1), so (a + b = 1) is not a necessary condition.Since (a + b = 1) is sufficient but not necessary for (4ab leq 1), the answer is (boxed{A}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-43575fad></div><p class="review-content" data-v-43575fad><span class="icon" data-v-43575fad>🔑:</span>If &quot;a+b=1&quot;, then 4ab=4a(1-a)=-4(a-frac{1}{2})^2+1 leq 1;  If &quot;4ab leq 1&quot;, take a=-4, b=1, then a+b=-3, which means &quot;a+b=1&quot; does not hold;  Therefore, &quot;a+b=1&quot; is a sufficient but not necessary condition for &quot;4ab leq 1&quot;.  Hence, the answer is boxed{A}.  To determine whether it&#39;s a necessary condition, sufficient condition, or both, we look at sufficiency by converting the given equation involving two variables into an inequality involving a single variable, and then apply knowledge of finding the extremum of a univariate quadratic function.

Susan is playing this game where she rolls two six-sided dice, and she wins if one number is three times the other. She plays three times, and we need to find the probability she wins at least once. Hmm. Alright, so first, maybe I should figure out the probability that she wins in a single game. Then, since she plays three times, I can use that to find the probability of winning at least once. Right?So, starting with the first part: probability of winning on a single roll. When she rolls two dice, there are 6 sides on each die, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36. That makes sense. Each die is independent, so each outcome is equally likely.Now, she wins if one die is three times the other. Let me think. So, possible pairs where one is three times the other. Let&#39;s list them out. The numbers on the dice are from 1 to 6. So, what numbers can be three times another number within that range?Well, let&#39;s see:If one die is 1, then three times that is 3. So, (1, 3) or (3, 1).If one die is 2, three times that is 6. So, (2, 6) or (6, 2).If one die is 3, three times that is 9, but 9 is not on a die. Similarly, 4 * 3 = 12, which is too big. 5 * 3 = 15, too big. 6 * 3 = 18, nope. So, the only possible pairs where one is three times the other are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2).Is that all? Let me double-check. Let&#39;s check both possibilities for each number:- For 1: 1*3 = 3, so pairs (1,3) and (3,1)- For 2: 2*3 = 6, so pairs (2,6) and (6,2)- For 3: 3*3 = 9, which isn&#39;t on a die- For 4: 4*3 = 12, nope- For 5: 15, nope- For 6: 18, nopeSo, yes, only the pairs (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). That&#39;s 4 favorable outcomes.Wait, hold on. Let me check if maybe I missed any where the other number is a third. For example, if a die shows 3, then a third would be 1. Similarly, if a die shows 6, a third is 2. So, that&#39;s already covered in the above pairs. So, no other possibilities. So, total favorable outcomes are 4.Therefore, the probability of winning on a single roll is 4/36, which simplifies to 1/9. Wait, 4 divided by 36 is 1/9. That seems correct.But wait, hold on. Let me make sure. Let&#39;s list all possible winning pairs:(1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). Are there any others? Let&#39;s see. If we take 3 and 1, 6 and 2. 3*1=3, 1*3=3. Wait, but the numbers on the dice are 1 through 6, so 3 is a valid number, but 1*3 is 3. Similarly, 2*3 is 6. The other way around, 3 is three times 1, and 6 is three times 2. So, the pairs are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). So, yes, that&#39;s 4. Therefore, 4 favorable outcomes. So, 4/36 = 1/9. So the probability of winning a single game is 1/9.Now, the problem says Susan plays the game three times. We need to compute the probability that she wins at least once. Hmm. So, when dealing with probabilities of &quot;at least one success&quot; in multiple trials, it&#39;s often easier to calculate the complement probability, which is the probability of never succeeding (i.e., losing all three times), and then subtracting that from 1.So, the formula would be:P(at least one win) = 1 - P(losing all three times)So, first, compute the probability of losing a single game, then raise that to the power of 3 (since she plays three times), and subtract from 1.Given that the probability of winning a single game is 1/9, the probability of losing a single game is 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.Therefore, the probability of losing all three games is (8/9)^3.Therefore, the probability of winning at least once is 1 - (8/9)^3.Now, let&#39;s compute that. First, calculate (8/9)^3.8/9 cubed is (8^3)/(9^3) = 512/729.Therefore, 1 - 512/729 = (729 - 512)/729 = 217/729.So, the probability Susan wins at least once in three games is 217/729.But wait, let me check if I did that arithmetic correctly.729 - 512. Let&#39;s subtract: 729 - 500 = 229, then subtract 12 more: 229 - 12 = 217. Yes, so 217/729. Let me confirm that 217 and 729 have no common factors. Let&#39;s see:217 divided by 7: 7*30=210, 217-210=7, so 7*31=217. So 217=7*31.729 divided by 7: 7*104=728, so 729 is 7*104 +1, so not divisible by 7. Divided by 31: 31*23=713, 31*24=744, which is too big. So, 729 is 3^6, since 9^3=729, and 9 is 3^2. So 729=3^6. 217 is 7*31, which are primes. So, 217/729 is in simplest terms. Therefore, the answer is 217/729.But just to recap, let&#39;s go through the steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything.First, single game: find pairs where one die is three times the other. We found (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). That&#39;s 4 outcomes. 4/36=1/9 chance to win. Then, three games, so the chance to lose all three is (8/9)^3=512/729. Subtract that from 1 to get 217/729. Seems correct.Alternatively, another way to check is to compute the probability directly, but that&#39;s more complicated. The direct way would be P(win at least once) = P(win first) + P(win second but not first) + P(win third but not first or second). But that&#39;s 1/9 + (8/9)(1/9) + (8/9)^2(1/9). Let&#39;s compute that:1/9 + 8/81 + 64/729. Convert all to 729 denominator:1/9 = 81/729,8/81 = 72/729,64/729 = 64/729.Adding up: 81 + 72 = 153, +64 = 217. So total is 217/729. Same result. Therefore, confirms that 217/729 is correct.So, the answer is 217/729.Final AnswerThe probability that Susan wins at least once in three games is boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}.&lt;/think&gt;Susan plays a game where she rolls two six-sided dice and wins if one number is three times the other. We need to compute the probability that she wins at least once in three games.First, we determine the probability of winning a single game. The favorable outcomes are pairs where one number is three times the other: (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 6), and (6, 2). This gives 4 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes, resulting in a probability of:[frac{4}{36} = frac{1}{9}]The probability of losing a single game is:[1 - frac{1}{9} = frac{8}{9}]The probability of losing all three games is:[left( frac{8}{9} right)^3 = frac{512}{729}]Thus, the probability of winning at least once in three games is:[1 - frac{512}{729} = frac{729 - 512}{729} = frac{217}{729}]The final answer is:[boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this probability problem. So, Susan is playing a game where she rolls two six-sided dice, and she wins if one die is three times the other. She plays three times, and we need to find the probability that she wins at least once out of those three tries. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, I need to figure out the probability that Susan wins on a single play. Once I have that, since she plays three times, I can use that probability to calculate the chance of her winning at least once. I remember that &quot;at least once&quot; problems often use the complement rule, where you subtract the probability of never winning from 1. So, the plan is:1. Find the probability of winning a single game.2. Find the probability of not winning a single game.3. Raise that probability to the power of 3 (since she plays three times) to find the probability of not winning all three times.4. Subtract that result from 1 to get the probability of winning at least once.Let me start with step 1: calculating the probability of winning in a single roll. To do this, I need to find all the possible outcomes where one die is three times the other. Since the dice are standard six-sided, the numbers on each die can be 1 through 6.Let&#39;s list all possible pairs (a, b) where either a is three times b or b is three times a. Let&#39;s consider each possible number and see if multiplying by 3 gives another number on the die.Starting with the smallest number, 1. Three times 1 is 3. So, the pairs (1, 3) and (3, 1) would work. Next, 2. Three times 2 is 6. So, pairs (2, 6) and (6, 2). Then 3. Three times 3 is 9, but 9 isn&#39;t on a die, so no pairs here. Similarly, 4 times 3 is 12, which is too big. 5 times 3 is 15, also too big. 6 times 3 is 18, which is way beyond. So, the only valid pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 6), and (6, 2).Wait, but let me verify that. Let&#39;s check all numbers from 1 to 6:For each number x on the first die, check if 3x is on the second die.- x=1: 3*1=3, which is valid. So (1,3)- x=2: 3*2=6, valid. So (2,6)- x=3: 3*3=9, invalid.- x=4: 3*4=12, invalid.- x=5: 3*5=15, invalid.- x=6: 3*6=18, invalid.Similarly, check if the second die is three times the first die. So for each number y on the second die, check if 3y is on the first die.- y=1: 3*1=3, valid. So (3,1)- y=2: 3*2=6, valid. So (6,2)- y=3: 3*3=9, invalid.- y=4: 3*4=12, invalid.- y=5: 3*5=15, invalid.- y=6: 3*6=18, invalid.So, combining these, the winning pairs are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). That&#39;s 4 favorable outcomes.But wait, hold on, when you roll two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6*6=36, right? Each die is independent, so each outcome is equally likely.So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4. Therefore, the probability of winning on a single roll is 4/36, which simplifies to 1/9.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check. Is there another pair that I missed?Suppose one die is 3 and the other is 1. Then 3 is three times 1, which we have. Similarly, 6 and 2. What about numbers like 4 and 12? But 12 isn&#39;t on a die. So, no, I think those four are the only ones. So, 4 favorable outcomes.So, the probability of winning on a single play is 4/36 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111.Okay, so that&#39;s the probability of winning once. Then, the probability of not winning once is 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.Now, since Susan plays three times, and each play is independent, the probability of not winning all three times is (8/9)^3.Then, the probability of winning at least once is 1 - (8/9)^3.Let me compute that:First, compute (8/9)^3:8/9 * 8/9 * 8/9 = (8^3)/(9^3) = 512/729.So, 1 - 512/729 = (729 - 512)/729 = 217/729.So, the probability that Susan wins at least once in three tries is 217/729.But wait, let me check my calculations again to be sure.First, confirm the number of favorable outcomes. The pairs are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). So four outcomes. 4 out of 36, which is indeed 1/9. That seems right.Then, probability of not winning once: 8/9. Three times: (8/9)^3 = 512/729. Then subtract from 1: 1 - 512/729. Let me compute 729 - 512. 729 - 500 is 229, then subtract 12 more: 229 -12 = 217. So, 217/729. Correct.But let me verify if 217 and 729 have any common factors. Let&#39;s see.217 divided by 7 is 31, because 7*30=210, 217-210=7, so 7*31=217. So, 217=7*31.729 is 9^3=3^6. So, factors of 729 are powers of 3. 31 is a prime number, 7 is a prime number. So, no common factors. Therefore, 217/729 is in simplest terms.Therefore, the probability is 217/729.Alternatively, if we want to write it as a decimal, that would be approximately 0.2976, so about 29.76%.But since the question asks for the answer in a boxed fraction, 217/729 is the answer.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check once again if there are any other winning pairs that I might have missed. For example, if both dice show the same number, like (3,3), but 3 is not three times 3. Similarly, (6,6): 6 isn&#39;t three times 6. So, those are not valid.What about numbers like 4 and 12? But 12 is not on a die. Similarly, 5 and 15. Nope. So, the only pairs where one is three times the other are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). So, 4 outcomes. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe using permutations. For the numbers where one is three times the other: (1,3) and (3,1); (2,6) and (6,2). So, two distinct number pairs, each with two permutations. So, 2*2=4. Yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the initial calculation is correct.Alternatively, another way to compute the probability is to think: For any die roll, the probability that the other die is three times or one-third.So, suppose we fix the first die. Let&#39;s say the first die is 1. Then, the second die needs to be 3. Probability 1/6.If the first die is 2, the second die needs to be 6. Probability 1/6.If the first die is 3, the second die needs to be 1. Probability 1/6.If the first die is 6, the second die needs to be 2. Probability 1/6.For the first die being 4, 5, or 3 already considered? Wait, no. Wait, if the first die is 3, the second needs to be 1. If the first die is 1, second needs to be 3. Similarly for 2 and 6.But also, the other way around: if the second die is 1, first die needs to be 3; if second die is 3, first die needs to be 1; if second die is 2, first die needs to be 6; if second die is 6, first die needs to be 2. Wait, but we already counted those in the permutations.Alternatively, the total probability is the probability that the first die is 1 and the second is 3, plus the first is 3 and the second is 1, plus first is 2 and second is 6, plus first is 6 and second is 2. So, 4*(1/6)*(1/6)=4/36=1/9. Same as before.So, that&#39;s correct. So, the probability is indeed 1/9 for a single game.Therefore, moving forward, the probability of not winning a single game is 8/9, so three games would be (8/9)^3, so 1 - (8/9)^3 = 217/729 ≈ 0.2976.Therefore, the answer is 217/729. Wait, but let me verify once again.Wait, (8/9)^3 is (8*8*8)/(9*9*9) = 512/729. 729 - 512 = 217. So yes, 217/729. Correct.Alternatively, 217 divided by 729: Let me check if that reduces. As I thought before, 217 is 7*31, and 729 is 3^6, so no common factors. So, yes, reduced form.Therefore, the answer is 217/729. Therefore, boxed answer is boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}.Final AnswerThe probability that Susan wins at least once in three games is boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the probability that Susan wins at least once in three games, we first calculate the probability of her winning a single game. Susan wins if one die is three times the other. The valid pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 6), and (6, 2), giving us 4 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Thus, the probability of winning a single game is:[frac{4}{36} = frac{1}{9}]The probability of not winning a single game is:[1 - frac{1}{9} = frac{8}{9}]The probability of not winning all three games is:[left( frac{8}{9} right)^3 = frac{512}{729}]Therefore, the probability of winning at least once in three games is:[1 - frac{512}{729} = frac{729 - 512}{729} = frac{217}{729}]The final answer is:[boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this probability problem. So Susan is playing a game where she rolls two standard six-sided dice, and she wins if one die is three times the other. She plays three times, and we need to find the probability that she wins at least once out of those three games. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.First, I need to find the probability that Susan wins in a single game. Then, since she plays three times, I can use that probability to find the chance she wins at least once. I remember that for problems where you want the probability of at least one success in multiple trials, it&#39;s often easier to calculate the complement probability (i.e., the probability of not winning at all) and then subtract that from 1. So maybe that&#39;s the approach here. Let me confirm that logic. If I let P(win) be the probability she wins a single game, then the probability she loses a single game is 1 - P(win). Then, the probability she loses all three games would be (1 - P(win))^3, and so the probability she wins at least once is 1 - (1 - P(win))^3. Yep, that seems right. So first, I need to find P(win).To find P(win), I need to figure out all the possible outcomes where one die is three times the other. Let&#39;s recall that when rolling two dice, there are 6 sides on each die, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36. Each outcome is equally likely, with a probability of 1/36.Now, let&#39;s list out all the possible winning combinations. The problem states that one die must be three times the other. So, let&#39;s think of possible pairs (a, b) where either a = 3b or b = 3a. Since each die can be 1 through 6, let&#39;s see which numbers can be three times another number in that range.Starting with the smaller numbers:If one die is 1, then three times that is 3. So (1,3) and (3,1) are winning combinations.If one die is 2, three times that is 6. So (2,6) and (6,2) are winning combinations.If one die is 3, three times that is 9, but 9 isn&#39;t on a die. Similarly, if one die is 4, three times is 12, which is too big. Same for 5 and 6. So the possible pairs where one is three times the other are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), and (6,2). Let me check if there are any others. If the die shows 3, three times that is 9, which isn&#39;t possible. Similarly, 4*3=12, 5*3=15, 6*3=18—none of those are on the die. So only the pairs where the smaller numbers are 1 and 2. So, that&#39;s 4 outcomes.Wait, but let me double-check. What about (3,1)? That&#39;s already included. Similarly, (6,2). So total of 4. But wait, hold on. Is there a case where both numbers are the same? For example, if both dice are 3, then 3 is not three times 3. So no, there&#39;s no case where both numbers are the same and one is three times the other. So only those four combinations: (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). Each of these is distinct. So that&#39;s 4 winning outcomes. Therefore, the probability of winning on a single roll is 4/36, which simplifies to 1/9. Wait, 4 divided by 36 is indeed 1/9. So P(win) = 1/9.But wait a second, let me verify again. Let&#39;s list all possible pairs:1 and 3: (1,3) and (3,1)2 and 6: (2,6) and (6,2)3 and 9: Not possible4 and 12: Not possible5 and 15: Not possible6 and 18: Not possibleSo yeah, only those four combinations. So 4/36 = 1/9. That seems correct.But wait, another thought: if one die is three times the other, does the order matter? Since we&#39;re considering two dice, the order does matter in the sense that rolling a 1 then a 3 is different from rolling a 3 then a 1. So both (1,3) and (3,1) are separate outcomes. Similarly for (2,6) and (6,2). So yes, four outcomes in total. So 4 out of 36. Therefore, probability of winning is 1/9.So, P(win) = 1/9, so P(lose) = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.Now, Susan plays three times. We need the probability that she wins at least once. As I thought earlier, the complement is her losing all three times. So the probability of losing all three games is (8/9)^3. Therefore, the probability of winning at least once is 1 - (8/9)^3.Let me compute that. First, calculate (8/9)^3. 8 cubed is 512, and 9 cubed is 729. So (8/9)^3 = 512/729. Then, 1 - 512/729 = (729 - 512)/729 = 217/729.Therefore, the probability Susan wins at least once in three games is 217/729.Wait, but let me check if I did that calculation correctly. 729 - 512 is 217? Let me verify:729 - 500 = 229229 - 12 = 217. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So 217/729 is the probability.But hold on, is 217 and 729 divisible by any common factors? Let&#39;s check. 217 divided by 7 is 31, 7*31 = 217? Wait, 7*30=210, 7*31=217. Yes. So 217 = 7*31. 729 divided by 7? 7*104=728, so no. So 729 is 9^3, which is 3^6. So prime factors of 217 are 7 and 31, which don&#39;t divide into 729. So the fraction 217/729 is in simplest terms.Therefore, the answer is 217/729.But wait, let me make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes in the initial calculation of the winning combinations. Let me list all possible outcomes where one die is three times the other:First die: 1, second die: 3 → (1,3)First die: 3, second die: 1 → (3,1)First die: 2, second die: 6 → (2,6)First die: 6, second die: 2 → (6,2)Are there any others? Let&#39;s see:If first die is 3, second die would need to be 9, which isn&#39;t possible. Similarly, first die 4, second die 12, nope. First die 5, second die 15, nope. First die 6, second die 18, nope. So no other combinations. Therefore, only those four. Therefore, 4/36 is correct. So, no mistake there.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different way to think about it. For example, suppose we fix one die and check if the other die is three times. So for each possible value of die 1, we check if die 2 is three times or one-third.For die1 = 1: die2 needs to be 3. So 1 outcome.For die1 = 2: die2 needs to be 6. 1 outcome.For die1 = 3: die2 needs to be 1. 1 outcome.For die1 = 6: die2 needs to be 2. 1 outcome.For die1 = 4, 5: no possible die2.Similarly, die2 can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For each die2, check die1. But this is symmetric. So total 4 outcomes. So yeah, same result. Therefore, 4/36.Hence, the rest of the calculation follows. So 1 - (8/9)^3 = 217/729 ≈ 0.2976, which is approximately 29.76% chance.So, as a probability, 217/729 is the exact value.Therefore, the answer is 217/729.But let me just cross-verify once more. Another way to compute the probability of winning at least once is to compute the probability of winning exactly once, exactly twice, or exactly three times, and sum them up. Let&#39;s see if that gives the same answer.The probability of winning exactly once is C(3,1)*(1/9)*(8/9)^2 = 3*(1/9)*(64/81) = 3*(64)/(9*81) = 192/729.Probability of exactly two wins: C(3,2)*(1/9)^2*(8/9) = 3*(1/81)*(8/9) = 24/729.Probability of exactly three wins: C(3,3)*(1/9)^3 = 1*(1/729) = 1/729.Adding them up: 192 + 24 + 1 = 217. So total 217/729. Yep, same result. So that confirms the answer is correct.Therefore, the probability that Susan wins at least once in three games is 217/729.Final AnswerThe probability that Susan wins at least once is boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the probability that Susan wins at least once in three games, we first calculate the probability of her winning a single game. Susan wins if the number on one die is three times the number on the other die. The valid pairs (a, b) are (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 6), and (6, 2). There are 4 winning outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Thus, the probability of winning a single game is:[P(text{win}) = frac{4}{36} = frac{1}{9}]The probability of losing a single game is:[P(text{lose}) = 1 - P(text{win}) = 1 - frac{1}{9} = frac{8}{9}]The probability of losing all three games is:[left( frac{8}{9} right)^3 = frac{512}{729}]Therefore, the probability of winning at least once is the complement of losing all three games:[1 - left( frac{8}{9} right)^3 = 1 - frac{512}{729} = frac{729 - 512}{729} = frac{217}{729}]Thus, the probability that Susan wins at least once is:[boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so Susan is playing this game where she rolls two standard six-sided dice, and she wins if one of the numbers is three times the other. She plays three times, and we need to find the probability that she wins at least once out of those three tries. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, I need to figure out the probability that Susan wins in a single play. Then, once I have that, since she plays three times, I can use that probability to find the chance she wins at least once. The standard way to approach &quot;at least once&quot; probability problems is to calculate the complement probability—that is, the probability that she doesn&#39;t win at all in three tries—and subtract that from 1. So, the formula would be 1 minus the probability of losing all three times. That seems manageable.But first, let&#39;s tackle the probability of winning a single game. So, rolling two dice, each die has numbers from 1 to 6. We need to find the number of favorable outcomes where one die is three times the other. Let&#39;s list all possible pairs (a, b) where either a is three times b or b is three times a.Let me think. Let&#39;s start by considering all possible pairs where one number is three times the other. Let&#39;s list them:If the first die is 1, then the second die needs to be 3 (since 1*3=3). Similarly, if the first die is 2, then the second die would need to be 6 (since 2*3=6). For the first die being 3, the second die would need to be 1 (since 3*1=3). If the first die is 4, then 4*3=12, but the die only goes up to 6, so that&#39;s not possible. Similarly, 5 and 6 would also result in numbers beyond 6 when tripled, so those don&#39;t work. Now, reversing the roles, if the second die is three times the first. So, if the first die is 3, the second die can be 1. Wait, but we already counted (3,1) when we considered the first die being 3. Similarly, (1,3) and (3,1) are different outcomes, right? Wait, in dice rolls, (a, b) is different from (b, a) unless a = b. So, for example, (1,3) and (3,1) are two separate outcomes.So, let&#39;s list all possible favorable outcomes:1. (1,3)2. (3,1)3. (2,6)4. (6,2)5. (3,9) – Wait, hold on. No, the die only has up to 6. So, tripling 3 would be 9, which isn&#39;t on the die, so that doesn&#39;t work. So actually, 3 can only be paired with 1. Similarly, 4, 5, and 6 when tripled would exceed 6, so they can&#39;t be paired with anything. So, only the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are involved in these pairs.Wait, let&#39;s check again. Let me list all possible numbers on the first die and see what numbers on the second die would satisfy the condition.First die: 1. Then second die must be 3 (1*3). So (1,3).First die: 2. Second die must be 6 (2*3). So (2,6).First die: 3. Second die must be 1 (3/3=1). So (3,1).First die: 4. 4*3=12, which is invalid. 4 divided by 3 is not an integer, so no.First die: 5. Similarly, 5*3=15, invalid, and 5/3 isn&#39;t integer.First die: 6. 6 divided by 3 is 2, so second die must be 2. So (6,2).Similarly, if we fix the second die and check the first die, but we already covered those pairs.So, the favorable outcomes are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). That&#39;s four outcomes.Wait, but wait, hold on. Let me make sure we didn&#39;t miss any. Let&#39;s see:Is there a case where both dice can satisfy the condition? For example, if she rolled (3,3), but 3 is not three times 3, so that&#39;s not a win. Similarly, (6,6) would not work. So, no, all the favorable ones are the four we listed.But hold on, is there another number that can be three times another number within 1-6? Let&#39;s check:Possible triples: 1*3=3, 2*3=6, 3*3=9 (invalid), 4*3=12 (invalid), etc. So only 1 and 2 can be tripled to get another number on the die. Similarly, numbers that are triples of others: 3 is triple of 1, 6 is triple of 2. So, the possible pairs are (1,3), (3,1), (2,6), (6,2). That&#39;s four. So, 4 favorable outcomes.But wait, wait. Wait, each die is distinguishable. So, in total, when rolling two dice, there are 6*6=36 possible outcomes, each equally likely.So, if there are 4 favorable outcomes, then the probability of winning on a single roll is 4/36, which simplifies to 1/9. Is that correct?Wait, but let me double-check. For example, (1,3): first die 1, second die 3. Then (3,1): first die 3, second die 1. Similarly, (2,6) and (6,2). So, yes, four outcomes. So, 4/36=1/9≈0.1111.But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have two dice, red and blue. So, red=1 and blue=3 is different from red=3 and blue=1, so they are separate. So, yes, four outcomes.Wait, but hold on. Suppose someone rolled (3,3). Then, is 3 equal to 3 times 3? No. So, that&#39;s not a win. Similarly, if you rolled (1,1), not a win. So, only those four distinct pairs where one is three times the other. So, 1/9 probability.Wait, but wait, hold on. Let me think again. Is there any other number that could be three times another? For example, 3 is three times 1, 6 is three times 2. So, those are the only possible combinations. So, 1 with 3, and 2 with 6. So, both orders, so four outcomes. So, yes, 4/36=1/9. So, the probability of winning on a single play is 1/9.Therefore, the probability of losing on a single play is 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.Since she plays three times, the probability of losing all three times would be (8/9)^3. Therefore, the probability of winning at least once is 1 - (8/9)^3.Let me compute that. First, compute (8/9)^3. 8^3=512, 9^3=729. So, 512/729. Then, 1 - 512/729 = (729 - 512)/729 = 217/729.Therefore, the probability that Susan wins at least once in three tries is 217/729.Wait, but let me double-check the initial step where we found four favorable outcomes. Because maybe I missed something. Let me list all possible pairs again.First die: 1. Second die: 3. (1,3).First die: 3. Second die: 1. (3,1).First die: 2. Second die: 6. (2,6).First die: 6. Second die: 2. (6,2).Any others? Let&#39;s check. For first die: 3. If second die is 1, that&#39;s covered. 3 can&#39;t be tripled to get another die number. Similarly, 6 divided by 3 is 2, which is covered. What about 4? 4 is not a multiple of 3, and tripling 4 is 12. 5? 5 is not a multiple of 3, tripling gives 15. 6? 6 divided by 3 is 2, which is covered. So, no, there are no other possible pairs.So, 4 favorable outcomes. 4/36=1/9. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe another way to calculate it is: For any die roll, the probability that one die is three times the other. Since the dice are independent, we can compute it as follows:Pick one die to be the first one, the other to be the second. Wait, but actually, since the dice are indistinct in the problem statement—no, wait, the problem states &quot;the number on one of the dice is three times the number on the other die.&quot; So, order doesn&#39;t matter here. Wait, but in terms of counting outcomes, whether order matters depends on how we model it. Wait, when rolling two dice, even if they are indistinct, the outcomes are usually considered as ordered pairs, so (a,b) where a can be from 1-6 and b can be from 1-6, so 36 outcomes. So, even if the dice are identical, the outcomes are considered distinct based on their numbers. So, for example, (1,3) and (3,1) are separate outcomes. So, the count is correct.But let me consider another approach. Suppose we don&#39;t care about order. So, how many unique pairs are there where one number is three times the other? In that case, the pairs would be {1,3} and {2,6}. But since each pair can occur in two different orders, when considering unordered pairs, there are two. But when considering ordered pairs, there are four. Since in the context of dice rolls, they are ordered, so we have four outcomes.Therefore, the probability is indeed 4/36=1/9.Therefore, proceeding as before, the probability of winning at least once in three tries is 1 - (8/9)^3 = 217/729.But let me compute 8/9 to the third power:(8/9)^3 = 8*8*8 / 9*9*9 = 512 / 729.1 - 512/729 = (729 - 512)/729 = 217/729.217 divided by 729. Let me check if this can be simplified. Let&#39;s see. 217: factors. 217 divided by 7 is 31, since 7*31=217. 729 divided by 7 is 104.142... So, 217 is 7*31, 729 is 9^3=3^6. So, 31 is a prime number. Therefore, 217/729 is in simplest terms.So, the probability is 217/729.But let me just verify once more that we have the correct number of favorable outcomes. Let&#39;s list all possible dice rolls where one is three times the other.1 and 3: (1,3), (3,1)2 and 6: (2,6), (6,2)That&#39;s it. So, 4 outcomes. 4 out of 36. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So, 1/9.Therefore, the rest of the calculation is correct. So, 1 - (8/9)^3 = 217/729.Therefore, the answer should be 217/729. So, boxed, that would be boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}.Final AnswerThe probability that Susan wins at least once in three tries is boxed{dfrac{217}{729}}.&lt;/think&gt;Susan plays a game where she rolls two fair six-sided dice and wins if one die is three times the other.

The possible winning pairs are:   [   (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 6), (6, 2), (3, 9), (9, 3)   ]   However, since the dice are standard six-sided dice, the pairs ((3, 9)) and ((9, 3)) are not possible.

So there&#39;s this problem about the Running Family passing through 7 doors. The challenge is to figure out how many different seven-digit numbers can be formed based on the order they went through the doors. Each door is numbered, I assume from 1 to 7, arranged in some figure. The first person can choose any door, and after they complete it, the adjacent doors get activated. Then the next person has to choose an unchallenged door from the activated ones, and so on, until all seven doors are done. The order they choose the doors in forms a seven-digit number, and we need to find how many different such numbers exist.First, let me try to visualize the doors. The problem mentions a figure, but since it&#39;s not provided, I need to assume the doors are arranged in a line? Or maybe a circle? Hmm. Wait, the problem says that after completing a door, it activates the adjacent doors on both sides. If the doors are in a line, then the first door would only have one adjacent door, but if they&#39;re in a circle, every door has two adjacent doors. But the problem mentions &quot;adjacent doors on both sides,&quot; which suggests that each door has two adjacent doors, so maybe they are arranged in a circle. Wait, but if it&#39;s a line, the end doors would only have one adjacent door. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s check the problem statement again. It says &quot;after completing the challenge, it will activate the adjacent doors on both sides.&quot; So if a door is in the middle of a line, it has two adjacent doors. If it&#39;s at the end, it only has one. But since the family has to go through all seven doors, and each subsequent person can only choose from activated doors, which are adjacent to previously challenged ones.Wait, maybe the doors are arranged in a straight line. Let&#39;s think of doors 1 to 7 in a line. Then starting from any door, activating adjacent doors. For example, if the first person chooses door 4, then doors 3 and 5 get activated. Then the next person can choose either 3 or 5. Suppose they choose 3, then activating 2 (since 1 is not adjacent to any activated doors yet). Wait, but door 3 is adjacent to door 4 (already challenged) and door 2. So after challenging door 3, door 2 becomes activated. Then the next person can choose door 2, 5, or maybe 4 again? But no, the problem says &quot;unchallenged door from the activated doors.&quot; So once a door is challenged, it can&#39;t be chosen again. So once door 4 is done, doors 3 and 5 are activated. Then if door 3 is chosen next, door 2 is activated. Then next choices would be door 2 or door 5. If someone chooses door 5 next, then door 6 is activated. And so on.Alternatively, if they start at door 1, then door 2 is activated. Then the next person has to choose door 2, which would activate door 3. Then next person chooses door 3, activating door 4, etc., leading to a sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Similarly, starting from door 7 would give the reverse. But starting from door 4 allows more flexibility.But the problem is asking for all possible sequences, so the number of different seven-digit numbers possible.This seems similar to permutations with certain constraints, where each subsequent number must be adjacent to at least one of the previously chosen numbers.Wait, actually, this is similar to counting the number of linear extensions of some sort, or the number of possible permutations generated by a specific graph traversal where each step must be adjacent to the already visited nodes.Wait, more specifically, the problem resembles finding the number of possible permutations of the doors where each door (after the first) is adjacent to at least one door that was chosen before it. This is known as the number of &quot;linear arrangements&quot; or &quot;permutations generated by a graph&quot;. In this case, the graph is a path graph (if doors are in a line) or a cycle graph (if doors are arranged in a circle). But the problem statement mentions activating &quot;adjacent doors on both sides&quot;, which might imply that each door has two sides. If it&#39;s a line, the end doors only have one adjacent door, so activating both sides would still just activate the existing adjacent door. But the problem says &quot;adjacent doors on both sides&quot; after completing a challenge. So maybe regardless of the door&#39;s position, activating both sides, but if there&#39;s no door on one side, then nothing happens there.Therefore, maybe the doors are arranged in a line, and each door when activated, activates the doors immediately next to it on the left and right. If you challenge a door, then the adjacent doors become activated. Then the next person can challenge any of the activated doors that haven&#39;t been challenged yet. So starting from any door, then the activated doors are the adjacent ones, and so on.This is similar to a graph where each node is connected to its neighbors, and you are performing a breadth-first search or depth-first search, but choosing the next node freely among the activated (discovered) nodes.Wait, but the exact process is: the first person picks any door, challenging it, which activates the adjacent doors. Then the next person can pick any of the activated doors (which are adjacent to the first door), challenging it, which activates its other adjacent doors (if any). Then the third person can pick any of the activated doors (which are adjacent to either of the first two doors), and so on.Therefore, this is similar to building a permutation where each subsequent element is adjacent to at least one of the previous elements. This is known in combinatorics as the number of &quot;linear permutations&quot; or &quot;permutations by adjacent transpositions&quot;. Wait, but more specifically, it&#39;s the number of possible permutations generated by a graph where each new element is adjacent to the existing set.In graph theory, this is called the number of &quot;labelings&quot; or &quot;linear extensions&quot; of the graph, but I need to recall the exact term.Alternatively, the problem is similar to counting the number of possible breadth-first search orderings of a path graph, but allowing any choice among the activated nodes.Wait, actually, in this problem, the activation propagates outward as you challenge doors. Each time you challenge a door, you activate its neighbors. But once a door is activated, it remains activated. So the set of activated doors grows as you challenge doors adjacent to them.Therefore, the process is equivalent to building a permutation where each element (after the first) is adjacent to at least one of the previously chosen elements. This is exactly the definition of a &quot;linear extension&quot; for a graph, but more precisely, it&#39;s called a &quot;linear ordering generated by graph neighbors&quot;.In the case where the graph is a path (i.e., doors in a straight line), the number of such permutations is known. For a path graph with n nodes, the number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}. But wait, that can&#39;t be right because for n=7, it would give 64, which is much lower than the possible permutations. Wait, no, that formula might be incorrect.Wait, let me think. For a path graph, starting at one end, you can only go in one direction, so there are two possible permutations (starting from left or right). But if you can start anywhere, then the number increases.Wait, for example, with 3 doors: 1-2-3.If you start at 2, then you can go to 1 or 3 next. If you go to 1, then the last must be 3. If you go to 3 next, then the last must be 1. So starting at 2 gives two permutations: 2,1,3 and 2,3,1. Starting at 1, you have to go 1,2,3. Starting at 3, you have to go 3,2,1. So total permutations are 2 (from middle) + 2 (from ends) = 4. But 3 doors, 4 permutations? Wait, 3 doors can normally have 6 permutations, but here only 4 are possible. So 4 = 2^{3-1} + something? Hmm, not exactly.Alternatively, for a path graph, the number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}. But for n=3, 2^{2}=4, which matches. For n=2, 2^{1}=2, which is correct. For n=1, 1. But in our case, when starting from any node, maybe the count is different. Wait, no, in the problem, the first person can choose any door. So starting positions are not fixed.Wait, in the problem, the first person can choose any door. Then each subsequent person must choose a door adjacent to any of the previously chosen doors. Wait, but in the problem, the activation happens as follows: when you challenge a door, you activate the adjacent doors. Then the next person can choose any of the activated doors. So the set of activated doors is the union of the neighbors of all challenged doors. Therefore, the process is similar to a graph search where each step you can choose any node adjacent to the already chosen nodes.This is equivalent to building a permutation where each new element is adjacent to at least one of the previously chosen elements. The number of such permutations is known as the number of &quot;linear arrangements&quot; or &quot;possible search orders&quot; of the graph.For a path graph (doors in a line), the number of such permutations is known. Let&#39;s see for small n.n=1: 1 permutation.n=2: 2 permutations: [1,2] and [2,1].n=3: Let&#39;s see. Start at 1: Then next must be 2, then 3. So [1,2,3].Start at 2: Next can be 1 or 3. If next is 1, then last is 3. If next is 3, then last is 1. So [2,1,3] and [2,3,1].Start at 3: Then next must be 2, then 1. So [3,2,1].Total permutations: 4. Which is 2^{3-1} = 4. So matches.n=4: Let&#39;s see.Start at 1: Then sequence must be 1,2,3,4.Start at 4: Similarly, 4,3,2,1.Start at 2: Next can be 1 or 3.If start at 2, next 1: Then activated doors are 1 and 3. Then next can be 3 (since 1 is already done). Then 3 activates 4. So sequence: 2,1,3,4.If start at 2, next 3: Then activated doors are 1 and 4. Then next can be 1 or 4.If next is 1: Then sequence: 2,3,1,4? Wait, after 2 and 3, activated doors are 1,4. Then next is 1, which activates nothing new. Then last is 4. So 2,3,1,4.If next is 4: Then sequence: 2,3,4,1. Wait, but after 2,3,4, activated doors are 1. So then 1 is last. So 2,3,4,1.Similarly, starting at 2, we have sequences: 2,1,3,4; 2,3,1,4; 2,3,4,1.Similarly, starting at 3:Start at 3: Next can be 2 or 4.If next is 2: Then activated doors are 1 and 4. Then next can be 1 or 4. If 1, then next is 4. If 4, then next is 1. So sequences: 3,2,1,4 and 3,2,4,1.If next is 4: Similar to starting at 3, next 4, sequences: 3,4,2,1 and 3,4,2,1? Wait, no. Wait, start at 3, next 4: activated doors are 2 and 5 (but n=4, so maybe doors 1-4). Wait, no, n=4, doors 1-4. So after challenging 3 and 4, activated doors are 2 (from 3) and nothing from 4 (since 4 is the end). So after starting at 3 and choosing 4 next, activated doors are 2 (from 3) and 3 is already done. Wait, no, challenging 3 activates 2 and 4. Then challenging 4 activates 3 (already done) and 5 (which doesn&#39;t exist). So next after 3 and 4 is 2. So sequence would be 3,4,2,1. Similarly, starting at 3, next 2: 3,2,1,4 or 3,2,4,1.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s count all permutations for n=4.Start at 1: 1,2,3,4.Start at 4: 4,3,2,1.Start at 2:- 2,1,3,4- 2,3,1,4- 2,3,4,1Start at 3:- 3,2,1,4- 3,2,4,1- 3,4,2,1So total permutations: 2 (from ends) + 3 + 3 = 8. Which is 2^{4-1} = 8. So that seems to hold.Similarly, n=1:1=2^{0}, n=2:2=2^{1}, n=3:4=2^{2}, n=4:8=2^{3}, so the pattern seems to hold that for a path graph with n nodes, the number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}. Therefore, for n=7, it would be 2^{6}=64. But wait, in our problem, the first person can choose any door, not just the ends. Wait, in the previous examples, starting from the middle gives more permutations. Wait, but in the n=3 case, starting from the middle gave two permutations, starting from the ends gave one each, totaling 4=2^{2}. For n=4, starting from the middle nodes (2 and 3) gave 3 permutations each, and starting from ends gave 1 each, totaling 8=2^{3}. So seems like regardless of starting position, the total number is 2^{n-1}. Therefore, perhaps the formula holds.But wait, how does starting from any node still give 2^{n-1} permutations? For example, in n=3, starting from the middle gives 2 permutations, and starting from the ends gives 1 each. So total 4=2^{2}. Similarly, n=4, total 8=2^{3}.So the formula is indeed 2^{n-1}, regardless of the starting point? Wait, but how is that possible? Because starting from the middle allows more possibilities.Wait, actually, in the problem, the starting door can be any of the n doors. So for n=3, the total permutations are 4, which is 2^{3-1}. Similarly, for n=4, it&#39;s 8=2^{4-1}. So maybe for any n, the number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}. Therefore, for n=7, it would be 2^{6}=64. But wait, the problem mentions seven-digit numbers, so 7 doors, which would be 64 different numbers. But 64 seems low. Wait, but let&#39;s check with n=3.Wait, for n=3, starting at door 2, you have two permutations: 2,1,3 and 2,3,1. Starting at door 1: 1,2,3. Starting at door 3:3,2,1. So total 4 permutations. Which is 2^{3-1}=4. Similarly, for n=4, starting at 2 and 3, each gives 3 permutations, but total is 8=2^{4-1}=8. So yes, the formula seems to hold. So perhaps the answer is 2^{7-1}=64.But wait, let&#39;s think again. Is the formula really 2^{n-1} for a path graph? Because in some references, the number of such permutations where each element is adjacent to the previous one is 2^{n-1}, but in our problem, the adjacency is to any of the previous elements. So it&#39;s a different problem. Wait, for example, in a path graph, the number of possible permutations where each new element is adjacent to at least one of the previously chosen elements is actually more than 2^{n-1}? Wait, in our earlier example with n=3, it&#39;s 4, which is 2^{3-1}. But if you have a star graph, the number would be higher. Wait, maybe for a path graph it&#39;s 2^{n-1}.Wait, let me check a reference. Wait, unfortunately, I can&#39;t look it up, but I can try to reason.Suppose we model the doors as nodes in a path graph. The process is equivalent to building a permutation where each new node is adjacent to at least one node already in the permutation. This is similar to the number of possible ways to order the nodes such that the subgraph induced by the first k nodes is connected for each k. This is known as the number of &quot;linear extensions&quot; or &quot;connected labelings&quot;. For a path graph, this number is indeed 2^{n-1}. Because at each step after the first, you have a choice to extend the current interval to the left or the right.Wait, actually, no. If the nodes are in a path, once you start somewhere in the middle, you can choose to go left or right, but once you&#39;ve gone left, you can&#39;t go right unless you have a connected component. Wait, maybe not. Wait, let&#39;s think of the permutation as starting at any node, and each subsequent node must be adjacent to the existing connected component.In that case, the number of such permutations is equal to the number of linear extensions of the path graph, which is known to be 2^{n-1}.Wait, for example, with n=3, you can start at any node. If you start at 2, then you can go left or right next. If you start at 1, you have to go right; starting at 3, you have to go left. So total number of permutations is 2^{n-1}=4.Similarly, for n=4, starting at 2, you can go left or right, and each choice then determines the direction. But wait, actually, once you start in the middle, you have more flexibility. Wait, maybe it&#39;s more complicated.Alternatively, think recursively. Let’s denote f(n) as the number of such permutations for a path of n doors.If you start at one end, say door 1, then the next door must be 2, then 3, etc., leading to only 1 permutation starting from each end. If you start somewhere in the middle, say door k (1 &lt; k &lt; n), then after choosing door k, you can choose either k-1 or k+1 next. Each choice splits the remaining doors into two segments, left and right, and each segment can be considered independently. Wait, but actually, once you choose a direction, the rest of the permutation is determined in that direction, but perhaps you can interleave.Wait, actually, the number of permutations can be calculated as follows: for each position after the first, you have two choices: extend to the left or extend to the right. But once you have started in a direction, you have to continue in that direction until the end. Wait, no, that&#39;s not true. For example, in a path of 4 doors: 1-2-3-4.If you start at 2, then you can go to 1 or 3. Suppose you go to 1: then the remaining doors are 3 and 4, which have to be traversed in order 3,4. So the permutation would be 2,1,3,4. If you start at 2 and go to 3: then the remaining doors are 1 and 4. You can go to 4 first, then 1, or go to 1 first, then 4. Wait, but after 2 and 3, door 4 is activated (adjacent to 3), and door 1 is activated (adjacent to 2). So you can choose either 1 or 4 next. If you choose 1, then door 4 is still activated, so last is 4. If you choose 4, then door 1 is still activated, last is 1. So starting at 2, the permutations are 2,1,3,4; 2,3,1,4; 2,3,4,1. That&#39;s three permutations from starting at 2. Similarly, starting at 3 gives three permutations. Starting at 1 or 4 gives one each. Total 8=2^{4-1}.So the number of permutations is doubling with each additional door. Hence, for n=7, it&#39;s 2^{6}=64. Therefore, the answer is 64.But let me check for n=5. If the formula holds, it should be 16 permutations.Start at door 3 (middle). Then you can go left or right. Suppose you go left to 2, then you can go left to 1 or right to 4. If you go left to 1, then remaining doors are 4,5. You can choose 4 then 5. If you go right to 4 from 2, then remaining doors are 1 and 5. You can choose 1 or 5 next. Similarly, starting at 3 and going right first, similar options. This seems to branch more, but according to the formula, it should be 16. But manually counting is tedious.Alternatively, since for each step after the first, you have a binary choice of going left or right, but once you choose a direction, you have to continue in that direction. Wait, no, actually, after starting in the middle, you can alternate directions. Wait, but in the example with n=4, starting at 2, you had three permutations. Which is not exactly 2^{3}=8. Wait, but no, for n=4, the total was 8 permutations. Hmm.Wait, maybe the formula is indeed 2^{n-1}. Because for each door after the first, you have two choices: extend to the leftmost or rightmost activated door. Wait, but how?Alternatively, think of the permutation as building the sequence by always choosing to take the leftmost or the rightmost available activated door. But in reality, you can choose any activated door, not just the ends. Wait, but maybe the key is that once you have a contiguous block of challenged doors, the activated doors are the two ends of the block. So each time you can choose to extend either the left end or the right end. Therefore, starting from any door, you can consider the permutation as building a contiguous block by expanding to the left or right at each step. But if you start in the middle, you first create a block, then expand to either side.Wait, but in reality, you don&#39;t have to create a contiguous block. For example, if you start at door 2 in 1-2-3-4, then go to door 4, then door 3, then door 1. That would be permutation 2,4,3,1, which skips around, but in the problem&#39;s rules, this is allowed because door 4 is adjacent to door 3, which was previously challenged. Wait, but door 4 is adjacent to door 3, but door 3 wasn&#39;t challenged yet. Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:If the first challenge is door 2, activating doors 1 and 3. Then the next challenge can be door 1 or 3. If you choose door 3 next, activating doors 4. Then next challenge can be door 4 or door 1. So you can go 2,3,4,1. But door 1 is adjacent to door 2, which was already challenged, so it&#39;s activated. Therefore, this is allowed.But in this case, the challenged doors form non-contiguous blocks? Wait, no. Once you challenge door 2 and door 3, the activated doors are 1,4. Challenging door 4 next, then activated door is 5 (if exists). But in the case of n=4, challenging door 4 activates door 5 which doesn&#39;t exist, so only door 3 is already challenged. Then the remaining door is 1. So permutation 2,3,4,1 is valid.But in this case, the challenged doors after 2,3,4 are contiguous (doors 2,3,4), and door 1 is separate but adjacent to door 2. So you can still challenge door 1. But in the problem, once a door is activated (i.e., adjacent to a challenged door), it remains activated. Therefore, once door 2 is challenged, door 1 and 3 are activated. Then door 3 is challenged, activating door 4. Then door 4 is challenged, but since door 5 doesn&#39;t exist, no new doors activated. Then door 1 is still activated, so it can be challenged last.But in terms of the sequence, the order is 2,3,4,1. However, this sequence is possible because each subsequent door is adjacent to at least one previously challenged door.But in this case, the challenged doors don&#39;t form a single contiguous block until the end. Wait, but in the problem, once you challenge a door, its adjacent doors become activated, so the activation spreads outward. However, even if there are multiple separate activated regions, as long as the next door is adjacent to any previously challenged door, it&#39;s allowed. Wait, but in the path graph, once you have a challenged door, the adjacent doors are activated. If you challenge a door in a separate part, but in a path graph, the doors are in a line, so separate parts would have to be non-overlapping. Wait, no, in a path graph, once you challenge a door, you can only activate its immediate neighbors. Therefore, if you have two separate challenged doors with unchallenged doors in between, those in between won&#39;t be activated until the challenged doors connect.Wait, for example, suppose in doors 1-2-3-4-5. Start at door 1, challenge it, activate door 2. Then challenge door 3 (but door 3 isn&#39;t adjacent to door 1). Wait, no, you can&#39;t challenge door 3 next because it&#39;s not activated. Door 1 activates door 2. So the next challenge can only be door 2. Then door 2 activates door 3. Then challenge door 3, etc. So in a path graph, you can&#39;t skip doors. Wait, this contradicts my previous thought. So maybe once you challenge a door, you can only activate its immediate neighbors, and the next challenge has to be among the activated doors. So if you start at door 2 in 1-2-3-4, challenging door 2 activates doors 1 and 3. Then you can challenge door 1 or 3. If you challenge door 1 next, then door 0 doesn&#39;t exist, so no new activations. Then the next challenge must be door 3, which activates door 4. Then challenge door 4. So sequence 2,1,3,4.Alternatively, challenging door 3 next, which activates door 4. Then challenge door 4, then door 1. So sequence 2,3,4,1. Or challenge door 3, then door 1, then door 4. Sequence 2,3,1,4.Wait, but after challenging door 2 and 3, door 1 and 4 are activated. So you can choose either 1 or 4 next, regardless of their position. So you can interleave the challenges. Therefore, the activation doesn&#39;t have to be contiguous. Therefore, the earlier idea that it&#39;s 2^{n-1} is incorrect, because you can have interleaved choices.But in that case, how many permutations are there? For n=3, we saw 4 permutations. For n=4, 8 permutations. So maybe it is 2^{n-1}.Wait, but in the case of n=4, starting at door 2, we have three permutations:2,1,3,42,3,1,42,3,4,1Similarly, starting at door 3:3,2,1,43,4,2,13,2,4,1Plus starting at 1 and 4 gives 2 more. Total 8=2^{3}=8. So for n=4, 8=2^{4-1}.Similarly, for n=5, it would be 16=2^{5-1}.Thus, for n=7, it&#39;s 2^{7-1}=64.Therefore, the number of different seven-digit numbers is 64, so the answer is 64, which is 2^6.But wait, I need to make sure this holds for another example.Take n=2: doors 1-2.Start at 1: sequence 1,2.Start at 2: sequence 2,1.Total 2=2^{2-1}=2. Correct.n=1: only 1 permutation. 2^{0}=1. Correct.Therefore, the pattern seems to hold. Hence, the answer should be 64, which is 2^6. Therefore, the number of different seven-digit numbers is 64.Final Answerboxed{64}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves determining the number of different seven-digit numbers formed by the order in which the seven members of the Running Family pass through 7 doors arranged in a line. Each door, once challenged, activates its adjacent doors, and subsequent challenges must be from the activated doors.Key steps:1. Understanding the Activation Process: Each door, when challenged, activates its adjacent doors. The next challenge must be from the activated doors.2. Graph Representation: The doors can be represented as nodes in a path graph. Each subsequent challenge must be adjacent to at least one previously challenged door.3. Permutations and Activation: The problem reduces to counting permutations where each subsequent element is adjacent to at least one previous element. This is equivalent to the number of linear extensions of a path graph.4. Pattern Recognition: For a path graph with ( n ) nodes, the number of such permutations is ( 2^{n-1} ). This pattern holds for small values of ( n ) (verified for ( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 )).5. Application to 7 Doors: For ( n = 7 ), the number of permutations is ( 2^{7-1} = 2^6 = 64 ).Thus, the number of different possible seven-digit numbers is (boxed{64}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. So, the problem is about the Running Family passing through 7 doors arranged in some figure. The rules are a bit specific. The first person can choose any door to activate. After they complete the challenge, it activates the adjacent doors on both sides. Then the next person has to choose an unchallenged door from the activated ones, and after completing, it activates the unactivated adjacent doors. This continues until all seven doors have been challenged. The question is asking how many different seven-digit numbers can be formed by the order in which the doors are challenged.Hmm. First, I need to visualize the figure with the 7 doors. The problem mentions &quot;the figure,&quot; but since it&#39;s not provided, maybe it&#39;s a standard arrangement? Probably, the doors are arranged in a straight line or a circle. Since the problem talks about adjacent doors on both sides, it might be a line. If it were a circle, each door would have two adjacent doors, but in a line, the first and last doors would only have one adjacent door. Wait, but the problem says &quot;adjacent doors on both sides&quot; after the first challenge. So if the first door is in the middle, it would activate both left and right doors. If the first door is at the end, it would only activate one adjacent door.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the first person can choose any door to activate, and after completing the challenge, it will activate the adjacent doors on both sides&quot;. So regardless of which door is chosen first, activating it will activate both adjacent doors. Then the next person can choose any unchallenged door from the activated doors. Then, after completing, activate the unactivated adjacent doors. So maybe the doors are arranged in a circle? Because if it&#39;s a line, then the end doors would only have one adjacent door. But if it&#39;s a circle, all doors have two adjacent doors. However, the problem mentions &quot;adjacent doors on both sides,&quot; which might not necessarily imply a circle. Let me check the problem statement again.Wait, the problem says &quot;the first person can choose any door to activate, and after completing the challenge, it will activate the adjacent doors on both sides&quot;. So even if it&#39;s a line, if the first door is somewhere in the middle, activating both adjacent doors. If the first door is at the end, then only one adjacent door is activated. Wait, but the problem says &quot;adjacent doors on both sides&quot;. Hmm. Maybe the figure is a line with doors 1 to 7 in order, where each door except 1 and 7 has two adjacent doors, and 1 and 7 have one. But the problem says &quot;activate the adjacent doors on both sides&quot;. So if the first door is door 4, it would activate doors 3 and 5. If the first door is door 1, then activating door 1 would activate door 2. But the problem says &quot;adjacent doors on both sides,&quot; which would only make sense if the doors are arranged in a circle. Otherwise, doors at the ends can&#39;t have both sides.Therefore, maybe the figure is a circle with 7 doors. Then, each door has two adjacent doors. So activating any door would activate its two neighbors. Then, the next person can choose any of the activated doors (which are the first door&#39;s neighbors), and after completing, activate their other neighbors. Wait, but the problem says &quot;activate the unactivated adjacent doors on both sides&quot;. So when you challenge a door, you activate the unactivated adjacent doors. So, after challenging a door, you activate the doors adjacent to it that haven&#39;t been activated yet. Hmm. Let me parse that again.First person chooses any door. After challenging it, it activates the adjacent doors on both sides. So initially, only that door is activated? Wait, no. Wait, the first person can choose any door to activate. So activating a door allows challenging it. Then, after completing the challenge, it activates the adjacent doors on both sides. So the first door is chosen, challenged, then its adjacent doors become activated. Then the next person can choose any unchallenged door from the activated doors (which are the adjacent ones). Then, after challenging that door, you activate the unactivated adjacent doors on both sides. So each time you challenge a door, you then activate the adjacent doors that haven&#39;t been activated yet.Wait, so the process is:1. Start with all doors deactivated.2. First person chooses any door to activate and challenge. So they activate that door, challenge it, and then activate its adjacent doors on both sides.3. Now, the activated doors are the first door and its two adjacent doors. But the first door has already been challenged, so the next person must choose from the activated doors that are unchallenged, which are the two adjacent doors.4. After challenging one of those, say the left adjacent door, then you activate the unactivated adjacent doors of that door. Since it&#39;s adjacent to the first door, which was already activated, but the other side might not be. So if you challenge door 2 (assuming doors are labeled 1-7), then door 2 is challenged, and then activate doors 1 and 3. But door 1 was already activated and challenged, so door 3 is activated if not already.Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to model this step by step.Assume the doors are arranged in a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7.First, choose door 4. Challenge it. Then activate doors 3 and 5. Now activated doors are 3,4,5. But door 4 is already challenged. So next person can choose door 3 or 5. Suppose they choose door 3. Challenge door 3. Then activate its adjacent doors, which are 2 and 4. But door 4 is already activated, so door 2 is activated. Now activated doors are 2,3,4,5. Next person can choose from doors 2,5 (since 3 and 4 are challenged). Choose door 5. Challenge door 5. Activate doors 4 and 6. Door 4 is already activated, so door 6 is activated. Now activated doors are 2,3,4,5,6. Next person can choose door 2 or 6. Choose door 2. Challenge door 2. Activate doors 1 and 3. Door 3 is already activated, so door 1 is activated. Now activated doors are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Next person can choose door 1 or 6. Choose door 6. Challenge door 6. Activate doors 5 and 7. Door 5 is activated, so door 7 is activated. Now activated doors are all except door 7? Wait, no. Wait, after challenging door 6, you activate doors 5 and 7. Door 5 was already activated, so door 7 becomes activated. Now, activated doors are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Challenged doors so far: 4,3,5,2,6. Remaining activated and unchallenged doors are 1 and 7. Next person can choose door 1 or 7. Then challenge them, but since they don&#39;t have any unactivated adjacent doors, nothing else is activated. Then finally challenge the remaining door.Wait, but this example path gives an order: 4,3,5,2,6,1,7. Is that a valid sequence? Let&#39;s check.Start with door 4. Activated doors after first challenge: 3,4,5. Challenged: 4.Next, choose door 3. Activated doors after challenging 3: 2 and 4. But 4 is already activated, so activate door 2. Now activated doors: 2,3,4,5. Challenged: 4,3.Next, choose door 5. Activate doors 4 and 6. 4 is activated, so activate 6. Activated doors: 2,3,4,5,6. Challenged: 4,3,5.Next, choose door 2. Activate 1 and 3. 3 is activated, so activate 1. Activated doors: 1,2,3,4,5,6. Challenged: 4,3,5,2.Next, choose door 6. Activate 5 and 7. 5 is activated, so activate 7. Activated doors: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Challenged: 4,3,5,2,6.Next, choose door 1. Activate doors 0 (invalid) and 2. 2 is already activated. So nothing new. Challenged: 4,3,5,2,6,1.Finally, challenge door 7. Activated doors: 6 and 8 (invalid). So done. Order: 4,3,5,2,6,1,7. So that&#39;s a valid seven-digit number.But the problem states that all seven members completed the challenge, so all doors are challenged in some order. The question is, how many different possible seven-digit numbers (permutations) can be formed this way.So the problem reduces to counting the number of possible sequences in which the doors can be challenged, following the activation rules.This seems similar to a graph traversal problem where each node can be visited only after it&#39;s been activated, and activation happens by visiting adjacent nodes. But the exact rules need to be clarified.Let me rephrase the rules as per the problem:1. The first person can choose any door to activate (i.e., the first door can be any door from 1 to 7). After challenging it, the adjacent doors on both sides are activated.2. The next person must choose an unchallenged door from the activated doors. After challenging it, the unactivated adjacent doors on both sides are activated.3. This process continues until all doors are challenged.So, each time a door is challenged, its adjacent doors are activated if they haven&#39;t been activated yet. Activated doors are those that are either challenged or have been activated by a previous challenge.Wait, but the problem says &quot;unchallenged door from the activated doors&quot;. So activated doors are those that have been either challenged or activated by adjacency. So activated doors form a set that grows as challenges proceed. Once a door is activated, it remains activated, but once it&#39;s challenged, it&#39;s removed from the available choices (since you have to choose unchallenged doors from the activated ones).Therefore, the process is similar to a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) but with specific rules. Each time you visit a node (challenge a door), you activate its neighbors, making them available for future visits. The next node to visit must be chosen from the currently activated but unchallenged nodes. The order in which you choose the nodes determines the permutation.This problem is equivalent to counting the number of possible breadth-first search orderings of a linear graph (if doors are in a line) or a circular graph. But the problem mentions &quot;the figure,&quot; which might be a line. However, the initial analysis suggests that if it&#39;s a line, the activation depends on the position. But the problem mentions &quot;adjacent doors on both sides,&quot; which for a line would only apply to doors with two neighbors, but for the end doors, only one side.Alternatively, if the doors are arranged in a circle, then each door has two neighbors, and activating a door would always activate two doors. However, the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify the figure. But given that the problem is from a competition, maybe it&#39;s a standard setup. In Chinese competitions, sometimes such problems refer to a line of doors. But given the ambiguity, maybe we need to confirm.Wait, the original problem is in Chinese, translated to English. The mention of &quot;the figure&quot; probably refers to a specific figure that&#39;s part of the problem, but since it&#39;s not included here, we have to assume. Given that the answer is a seven-digit number, and there are seven doors, likely arranged in a straight line, as doors 1 to 7. If it were a circle, the number might be different. But since the problem is from a past competition, perhaps it&#39;s similar to linear arrangements.Alternatively, maybe the doors are arranged in a circle. Let me check the possible difference.If the doors are in a circle, then each door has two neighbors. Activating a door would activate both neighbors. Then, challenging a door would activate its neighbors. The next choices are the activated doors. But if it&#39;s a line, the end doors only activate one neighbor. However, in the problem statement, after the first challenge, it activates &quot;the adjacent doors on both sides&quot;. If the doors are in a line, and you pick an end door, it would have only one adjacent door, so only that one is activated. If you pick a middle door, both sides are activated. Then, as you continue, each challenged door activates its adjacent doors that haven&#39;t been activated yet.Therefore, the figure is probably a line with doors 1 through 7 in a straight line. Let&#39;s confirm with an example.If we start with door 1. Challenge it, then activate door 2. Then next person can choose door 2. Challenge door 2, activate door 3. Next person chooses door 3, challenge it, activate door 4, etc. This would result in the sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Similarly, starting from door 4, we can have sequences that spread outwards.Alternatively, starting from door 4, challenge 4, activate 3 and 5. Then choose 3, challenge 3, activate 2. Then choose 5, challenge 5, activate 6. Then choose 2, challenge 2, activate 1. Then choose 6, challenge 6, activate 7. Then challenge 1 and 7. So the order would be 4,3,5,2,6,1,7. Another possible order starting from 4 could be 4,5,3,6,2,7,1, but wait, after challenging 5, you activate 4 and 6. 4 is already challenged, so activate 6. Then next choices are 3 and 6. If you choose 6, challenge 6, activate 5 and 7. 5 is already challenged, so activate 7. Then you have 3 and 7. So maybe 4,5,6,3,7,2,1. Wait, but challenging 3 would activate 2 and 4. 4 is already challenged, so activate 2. Then you can choose 2 or 7. So possible order: 4,5,6,3,2,7,1. Alternatively, 4,5,6,7,3,2,1.Wait, but challenging 7 would require that 6 is already activated. So if you challenge 6, then activate 5 and 7. Then 7 is activated. So after challenging 6, you can challenge 7. Then challenging 7 would not activate anything new, since 6 is already challenged. Then remaining activated doors would be 3,2,1. Hmm, this is getting complex.Therefore, the problem is essentially counting the number of possible sequences in which the doors can be challenged, following the rule that each door must be activated (either by being challenged or by being adjacent to a challenged door) before it can be challenged. This is similar to counting the number of linear extensions of a certain poset (partially ordered set), where the activation imposes dependencies.However, linear extensions are difficult to count, especially for larger posets, but maybe there&#39;s a pattern here.Alternatively, think of the doors as nodes in a graph, and each time you challenge a door, you can challenge any activated door, and then activate its neighbors. So the process is similar to constructing the graph by activating neighbors step by step, and the order of challenging is the order in which nodes are visited, with the constraint that a node can only be visited if it&#39;s been activated (either by being adjacent to a visited node or being the initial one).This is equivalent to the number of possible search orders starting from any node and expanding to neighbors, similar to BFS or DFS, but allowing any order as long as each node is visited after at least one neighbor has been visited (except the first one).However, this is more general than BFS or DFS. It&#39;s called the number of &quot;possible sequences&quot; or &quot;search orders&quot; of a graph, starting from a single node and adding nodes adjacent to already visited ones. This is known as the number of breadth-first search orderings or the number of possible sequences in which nodes can be discovered in a graph. However, in this case, the graph is a path graph (linear) or a cycle graph.But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify the figure, but mentions &quot;adjacent doors on both sides,&quot; maybe it&#39;s a cycle. Let me check.If it&#39;s a cycle (doors 1-7 arranged in a circle), then each door has two neighbors. Then, starting from any door, challenging it activates two doors. Then, each subsequent challenge activates two more doors (if not already activated). Wait, no. Each challenge activates the adjacent doors. But once a door is activated, challenging it doesn&#39;t reactivate anything. So the activation is only when you challenge a door, you activate the adjacent doors if they haven&#39;t been activated yet.Wait, no. The problem says: &quot;the first person can choose any door to activate, and after completing the challenge, it will activate the adjacent doors on both sides&quot;. So &quot;activate&quot; here probably means making them available for future challenges. Then &quot;activated doors&quot; are the ones that have been either challenged or activated by adjacency. So the set of activated doors grows as you challenge doors and activate their neighbors.This is equivalent to building a connected component: starting from a single node, each step you visit a node in the current connected component (activated doors), and then add its neighbors to the connected component. The number of possible orderings is the number of possible ways to traverse the graph in this manner.For a path graph (linear), this is similar to the number of linear extensions where each door must be visited after at least one of its neighbors. For a cycle graph, it&#39;s similar but with the additional connection between door 1 and door 7.But since the problem is about seven doors and the answer is a seven-digit number, which is the count of such permutations, we need to figure out the number for either a path or cycle graph.Given that the problem comes from a Chinese competition, and often such problems use a linear arrangement unless specified otherwise. However, the problem mentions &quot;adjacent doors on both sides,&quot; which for a linear arrangement would only apply to doors with two neighbors. For doors at the ends, they only have one adjacent door, so activating them would only activate one side. However, the problem says &quot;activate the adjacent doors on both sides&quot; regardless of position, which suggests that maybe the doors are arranged in a circle.But if it&#39;s a circle, then each door has two neighbors, so activating any door would always activate two doors. However, if it&#39;s a line, activating an end door would only activate one door. The problem states &quot;activate the adjacent doors on both sides,&quot; which might imply that even if a door is at the end, it still has two sides, but one side is a wall or something. But the problem doesn&#39;t mention anything about walls. So maybe the doors are arranged in a circle.Wait, but if they are arranged in a circle, starting from any door, you activate two doors. Then, the next person can choose either of those two doors. If they choose one, then challenging that door would activate its other neighbor (since in a circle, each door has two neighbors). Wait, let&#39;s take an example.Suppose the doors are arranged in a circle: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1.First, choose door 1. Challenge it. Activate doors 7 and 2. Activated doors: 1 (challenged), 2, 7. Next person can choose 2 or 7. Suppose they choose 2. Challenge door 2. Activate doors 1 and 3. Door 1 is already activated, so activate door 3. Now activated doors: 1,2 (challenged), 3,7. Next person can choose 3 or 7. Suppose they choose 3. Challenge 3. Activate doors 2 and 4. Door 2 is already activated, so activate door 4. Activated doors: 1,2,3 (challenged),4,7. Next choices: 4 or 7. Choose 4. Challenge 4. Activate doors 3 and 5. Door 3 is activated, so activate 5. Now activated doors: 1,2,3,4 (challenged),5,7. Next choices:5 or7. Choose5. Challenge5. Activate doors4 and6. Door4 is activated, so activate6. Activated doors:1,2,3,4,5 (challenged),6,7. Next choices:6 or7. Choose6. Challenge6. Activate doors5 and7. Door5 is activated, activate7. Now activated doors: all except 7, which is already activated. Wait, 7 was activated at the beginning. So challenge 6, activate 7. Now 7 is activated. Next person can choose 7. Challenge7. Activate doors6 and1. Both are already activated. Done. Order:1,2,3,4,5,6,7.Alternatively, different choices could lead to different permutations. For example, starting with door1, then choosing door7 instead of door2. Let&#39;s try:Challenge door1. Activate7 and2. Next choose7. Challenge7. Activate6 and1. Door1 is already challenged, so activate6. Activated doors:1,2,6,7. Next choices:2 or6. Choose6. Challenge6. Activate5 and7. Door7 is challenged, so activate5. Activated doors:1,2,5,6,7. Next choices:2 or5. Choose5. Challenge5. Activate4 and6. Door6 is challenged, so activate4. Activated doors:1,2,4,5,6,7. Next choices:2 or4. Choose4. Challenge4. Activate3 and5. Door5 is challenged, so activate3. Activated doors:1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Next choices:2 or3. Choose3. Challenge3. Activate2 and4. Door4 is challenged, so activate2. Activated doors: all except2, which is already activated. Challenge2. Then challenge the remaining doors? Wait, after challenging3, activated doors are 2 and4. But door2 was already activated from the start, so door2 is already activated but unchallenged. So after challenging3, the next choices are door2 and any other activated doors. Wait, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a mathematical way to calculate the number of such permutations. Let&#39;s consider that the problem is similar to building a permutation where each element (after the first) is adjacent to at least one of the previously chosen elements. This is known in combinatorics as a &quot;linear extension&quot; for a certain poset, but I need to verify.Alternatively, the problem resembles the number of possible ways to traverse a graph starting from a single node, with each subsequent node adjacent to the already traversed subgraph. This is equivalent to the number of possible search orderings, which is known as the number of &quot;BFS orderings&quot; or &quot;DFS orderings&quot;, but since the choice at each step is arbitrary (any activated node), it&#39;s more general.For a linear graph (path graph), the number of such permutations is known. For a path graph with n nodes, the number of such permutations starting from any node is 2^{n-1}. But wait, that can&#39;t be, since for n=7, it would be 64, which is too low. Wait, maybe not.Wait, actually, for a linear graph, the number of such permutations where each subsequent element is adjacent to at least one previous is similar to the number of linear extensions of the poset where each element must come after its neighbors. But I need to check.Alternatively, for a linear arrangement of doors, starting from any door, the number of possible permutations is 2^{n-1} for each starting position. For example, starting in the middle, you can choose left or right at each step. But this is not exactly the case here, because once you activate doors, you can choose any activated door, not just the most recent one.Wait, this seems similar to the number of possible ways to arrange the doors such that each door is adjacent to at least one door that comes before it in the sequence. This is similar to permutations with the consecutive element property. However, the exact count is non-trivial.I recall that for a linear graph (path), the number of such permutations starting from one end is 1 (only increasing order), but starting from the middle, it&#39;s more complex. However, the problem allows starting from any door. So total permutations would be the sum over each starting door of the number of permutations starting from that door.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s a recursive formula. Let&#39;s denote that for a segment of doors from i to j, the number of permutations starting with door k (where i ≤ k ≤ j) is equal to the product of the number of permutations for the left segment (i to k-1) and the right segment (k+1 to j), multiplied by the combination of steps interleaving left and right.This is similar to the number of ways to traverse a line graph by choosing a starting point and then at each step choosing to go left or right, but allowing any order as long as you expand from the activated doors.This is actually equivalent to the number of linear extensions of the poset where each door must come after its adjacent doors. However, in our case, the constraints are that each door must come after at least one of its neighbors. This is similar to the number of ways to order the doors such that the order forms a &quot;linear extension&quot; where each element is greater than at least one of its neighbors.But I&#39;m not sure about the exact terminology here. Alternatively, this problem is analogous to the number of possible ways to perform a &quot;sink&quot; or &quot;source&quot; traversal in a graph, but again, not sure.Wait, let&#39;s think recursively. Suppose we have a line of n doors. The number of possible sequences starting from door k is equal to the number of interleavings of the sequences for the left part (doors 1 to k-1) and the right part (doors k+1 to n). Each time, after choosing the starting door k, the next doors must be chosen from the activated doors, which would be the neighbors of the already chosen doors.This is similar to the number of ways to interleave two sequences, where the left sequence is the permutation of doors 1 to k-1, and the right sequence is the permutation of doors k+1 to n. However, the constraint is that each subsequent door must be adjacent to an already chosen door.Wait, this is exactly the number of ways to arrange the left and right segments, where each segment must be traversed in a way that each next door is adjacent to the already traversed doors. Therefore, for each starting door k, the number of permutations is C(n-1, k-1) * 2^{n-1}, but I need to check.Wait, actually, this is similar to the number of &quot;linear arrangements&quot; where you start at a point and spread out. For a line of n doors, starting at position k, the number of possible permutations is 2^{n-1}. Because after choosing the starting door, each subsequent door can be added to the left or right of the current interval. For example, starting at door 4 in a 7-door line, the next door can be 3 or 5. If you choose 3, then next can be 2 or 5, etc. So each time, you have a choice between expanding left or right. Therefore, for each starting position, the number of permutations is 2^{n-1}. However, if you start at an end, like door 1, then you can only expand to the right, so the number of permutations is 1 (only increasing order). Similarly, starting at door 7, only decreasing order. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, if starting at door 1, you can only challenge door 2 next, then door 3, etc. So the only permutation starting at door 1 is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Similarly, starting at door 7, only 7,6,5,4,3,2,1. But if starting at door 4, you can interleave left and right expansions. So the number of permutations starting at door k is 2^{k-1} * 2^{n - k} } = 2^{n-1} when starting in the middle. Wait, no. Wait, if starting at position k in a line of n doors, the number of possible permutations is C(n-1, k-1). Because after choosing the starting door, you have to decide the order in which you traverse the left and right segments. Each permutation corresponds to a sequence of choices between left and right.For example, in a line of 7 doors, starting at door 4, you have 3 doors on the left and 3 on the right. The number of permutations is the number of interleavings of left and right expansions. This is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange 3 left moves and 3 right moves, which is C(6,3) = 20. Therefore, starting at position k in an n-door line, the number of permutations is C(n-1, k-1). Wait, but for n=7 and k=4, it would be C(6,3)=20. But that seems too low. Wait, perhaps it&#39;s 2^{n-1} for each starting position except the ends. For example, starting at door 4, after each challenge, you can choose to go left or right. So after the first door (4), you have two choices (3 or5). Then, depending on your choice, you again have two choices (if you went to 3, next can be 2 or5; if you went to5, next can be3 or6), etc. But this leads to a binary tree of choices, and the number of paths would be 2^{n-1}. For n=7, starting at the middle door, it would be 2^{6} =64. But starting at the middle, you have 6 choices left, each with two options, so 2^6=64. But when you get closer to the ends, the number of choices reduces. Wait, but actually, once you reach an end, you can&#39;t go further in that direction. So maybe the total number is not simply 2^{n-1}.Wait, let&#39;s consider a smaller example. Let&#39;s take n=3 doors: 1,2,3.If we start at door 2:1. Challenge door2. Activate 1 and3.Next, choose between 1 and3. Suppose we choose1:Challenge door1. Then activate door0 (invalid) and door2 (already challenged). So next, only door3 is activated. Challenge door3. So order:2,1,3.Alternatively, after door2, choose3:Challenge door3. Then activate door2 (already challenged) and door4 (invalid). Next challenge door1. Order:2,3,1.Alternatively, after door2, challenge1, then challenge3:2,1,3.Or after door2, challenge3, then challenge1:2,3,1. So starting at door2, there are 2 permutations.But according to 2^{n-1} =2^{2}=4, which is incorrect. So the formula isn&#39;t 2^{n-1}.Alternatively, maybe for a linear graph with n nodes, starting at position k, the number of permutations is C(n-1, k-1). For n=3, starting at door2 (k=2), C(2,1)=2, which matches. For starting at door1, C(2,0)=1, which matches the single permutation 1,2,3. Similarly for door3, C(2,2)=1:3,2,1.So for n=3, total permutations are 1+2+1=4.For n=5, starting at door3: C(4,2)=6 permutations. Starting at door2: C(4,1)=4. Starting at door4: same as door2. Doors1 and5 have 1 each. Total permutations:1+4+6+4+1=16=2^{4}=16.Similarly, for n=7, the total permutations would be the sum over k=1 to7 of C(6, k-1). Since n=7, sum_{k=1}^7 C(6,k-1) = sum_{m=0}^6 C(6,m) =2^6=64.Wait, but wait. For n=3, sum_{k=1}^3 C(2,k-1)=1+2+1=4=2^2=4. For n=5, sum=16=2^4. For n=7, sum=64=2^6. Therefore, the total number of permutations is 2^{n-1}.But wait, this would mean that for a line of n doors, the total number of possible permutations is 2^{n-1}. Because starting at each door k, you have C(n-1,k-1) permutations, and sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1,k-1)=2^{n-1}.But in our problem, the starting door can be any door, and the total number of permutations is the sum over all starting positions of the number of permutations starting at that position. Therefore, for n=7, the total number is 2^{6}=64. However, in the n=3 case, the total permutations are 4=2^{2}, which matches. Similarly, n=5 gives 16=2^{4}.But wait, this contradicts the earlier example for n=3 where starting at door2 gives 2 permutations, and starting at doors1 and3 gives 1 each, totaling 4, which is 2^{2}. So yes, for n doors, the total number is 2^{n-1}. Therefore, for n=7, the answer is 2^{6}=64. However, in the problem statement, the answer is supposed to be a seven-digit number, which would be a number like 64, but 64 is a two-digit number. Wait, no, the problem says that sorting the numbers of the seven doors according to the order they were challenged results in a seven-digit number. Wait, no, the problem says &quot;Sorting the numbers of the seven doors according to the order they were challenged will result in a seven-digit number&quot;. Wait, that might be a translation issue. Does it mean that the sequence in which the doors are challenged forms a seven-digit number, where each digit is the door number? For example, if the order is 4,3,5,2,6,1,7, then the seven-digit number is 4352617. The question is asking how many different such seven-digit numbers are possible.Therefore, the answer is the number of possible permutations, which for a line of 7 doors would be 2^{6}=64. But wait, in the previous examples, starting from the middle door gives more permutations than starting from the ends. However, according to the earlier logic, the total permutations are 2^{n-1}. However, in the problem statement, the family has seven members, each challenging a door in sequence. The first person can choose any door. Then, each subsequent person chooses an unchallenged door from the activated doors. Therefore, the process is equivalent to a connected graph traversal where each new node is adjacent to the already visited subgraph.This is known as the number of &quot;possible sequences&quot; or &quot;permutation generated by breadth-first search with arbitrary choice&quot;, but for a linear graph. However, according to the OEIS sequence A000245, which counts the number of permutations of n letters that avoid the consecutive pattern 132, but that might not be relevant here.Wait, another approach: for a linear graph of n nodes, the number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}. As per the earlier examples:n=1:1=2^0n=2:2=2^1 (1,2 and 2,1)n=3:4=2^2n=4:8=2^3So yes, for n nodes, it&#39;s 2^{n-1}.But wait, for n=3, starting at door2 gives 2 permutations, starting at doors1 and3 gives 1 each, total 4=2^{2}. For n=4, starting at door2 and door3 each give 3 permutations, starting at doors1 and4 give 1 each. Total 1+3+3+1=8=2^{3}. So the pattern holds. Therefore, for n=7, total permutations would be 2^{6}=64.But the problem says &quot;there are qquad different possible seven-digit numbers&quot;. If the answer is 64, then it&#39;s 64. However, in the Chinese competition problems, sometimes the answer is larger. Maybe the doors are arranged in a circle.If the doors are arranged in a circle, then each door has two neighbors, so activating a door activates two doors. Then, the number of permutations is different. For a circular graph, the number of possible permutations is n * 2^{n-1}. Because you can start at any door (n choices), and then at each step, choose to go clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, for n=3, it would be 3*2^{2}=12 permutations, but that contradicts with the linear case. Wait, no, in a circle, once you choose a direction, you can&#39;t go back. Wait, no, in a circle, you can still choose to go in either direction at each step.Wait, but in a circular arrangement, starting from any door, after challenging it, you activate two neighbors. Then, each subsequent challenge can choose either of the activated doors. However, since it&#39;s a circle, activating a door might connect back to previously activated doors. This complicates the count.Alternatively, for a circular graph, the number of such permutations is n * 2^{n-1}. For example, n=3:3*4=12 permutations. However, manually counting permutations for a circle with 3 doors:Start at door1. Activated doors:2 and3. Next, choose door2 or3. If choose door2: activated doors1 (challenged),3 (activated), and door3&#39;s neighbor door4 (but n=3, so door3&#39;s neighbors are door2 and door1). Wait, in a circle of 3 doors, each door&#39;s neighbors are the other two. So challenging door1 activates doors2 and3. Then challenging door2 activates doors1 and3. But door1 is already challenged, so activate door3. Now, activated doors are 1,2,3. Then challenge door3. So the order would be1,2,3. Similarly, starting at door1, choosing door3 next:1,3,2. Then start at door2, choosing door1 or3 next, etc. So for each starting door, there are 2 permutations (choosing left or right), leading to n*2 permutations. For n=3, 3*2=6 permutations. But wait, that contradicts the previous idea.Wait, actually, for a circular graph with 3 doors, starting at any door, you have two choices for the next door, and then the last door is fixed. So total permutations are 3 (starting points) * 2 (directions) =6. Similarly, for n=4, it would be 4*2=8 permutations? But wait, let&#39;s check.For n=4, arranged in a circle:1-2-3-4-1.Start at door1. Challenge1, activate2 and4. Next choose2 or4. If choose2: activate3. Next choose3 or4. If choose3: activate4. Then choose4. Order:1,2,3,4. If after choosing2, then choose4: activate3. Then choose3. Order:1,2,4,3. Similarly, starting at1 and choosing4 first:1,4,3,2 or1,4,2,3. So starting at1, there are2*2=4 permutations. Similarly for each starting door, so total permutations would be4*4=16. But wait, for n=4, starting at each door gives 4 permutations, leading to 16 total. However, according to the formula n*2^{n-1}, for n=4, it would be4*8=32, which is too high.This suggests that the formula is different for circular graphs. Therefore, it&#39;s unclear whether the doors are arranged in a line or a circle. Since the problem statement mentions &quot;adjacent doors on both sides&quot;, which for a linear arrangement would only apply to middle doors, but the problem didn&#39;t specify the figure. Therefore, this ambiguity makes it difficult to answer.However, given that the problem is from a competition where often such problems assume a linear arrangement unless stated otherwise, and given that the answer for a linear arrangement is 2^{n-1}, which for n=7 is 64. However, in our earlier analysis, starting from different doors gives different numbers of permutations, and the total is the sum over all starting positions. For a linear arrangement with n=7, sum_{k=1}^7 C(6,k-1)=2^6=64.Therefore, if the doors are arranged in a line, the total number of permutations is64. If arranged in a circle, it would be higher. But since the problem mentions &quot;adjacent doors on both sides&quot; when activating, which makes more sense in a circle, but activation in a line still works if interpreted as activating both sides regardless of the door&#39;s position. Wait, but in a line, a door at the end only has one adjacent door. So if the problem says &quot;activate the adjacent doors on both sides&quot;, even for an end door, that would be impossible, implying that the doors are arranged in a circle.But if it&#39;s a circle, then the total number of permutations is different. For a circular graph, the number of such permutations is n*2^{n-1}. For n=7, this would be7*64=448. However, this is likely too high. Alternatively, for a circular graph, the number might be similar to the linear case but multiplied byn because you can start anywhere. But in the linear case, you can also start anywhere.Wait, confusion arises because the starting point is arbitrary. In the linear case, the total number is2^{n-1}, regardless of starting point. But in the circular case, starting at any door, you have2^{n-1} permutations as well, but multiplied byn? Wait, no. For example, in a circular graph with3 doors, starting at each door gives2 permutations (left or right), totaling3*2=6 permutations. Similarly, for n=4, starting at each door gives2^{3}=8 permutations, totaling4*8=32. But this doesn&#39;t align with manual counts.Given the confusion and lack of a clear figure, but considering that in most problems like this without a specified figure, a linear arrangement is assumed. Therefore, the answer is likely2^{n-1}=64 for n=7. Hence, the number of different seven-digit numbers is64.However, I recall that in similar problems, the number of permutations is actually n! divided by something, but given the constraints, it&#39;s restricted.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 2^{n-1}=64, but I need to verify with n=3.For n=3, linear arrangement: doors1-2-3.Total permutations:Starting at1:1,2,3Starting at2:2,1,3 and2,3,1Starting at3:3,2,1Total:4 permutations, which is2^{2}=4. This matches.For n=4, starting at1:1,2,3,4Starting at2:2,1,3,4;2,3,1,4;2,3,4,1Starting at3:3,2,1,4;3,4,2,1;3,4,1,2Starting at4:4,3,2,1Total permutations:1+3+3+1=8=2^{3}=8. So yes, for n=4, it&#39;s8. Therefore, the formula holds.Thus, for n=7, the total number of permutations is2^{6}=64. Therefore, the answer is64.But wait, the problem states that the first person can choose any door to activate. So starting from any door, and the total is the sum over all starting positions of the number of permutations starting at that position. But according to the previous logic, the total number is2^{n-1}. For n=7, that&#39;s64. However, in the linear case, the number of permutations starting at positionk isC(n-1,k-1), and the sum overk is2^{n-1}. Therefore, the answer is64.But I need to check whether the problem allows starting at any door, hence sum over all starting positions. If so, then the total number is2^{n-1}.Yes, because the problem says &quot;the first person can choose any door to activate&quot;, so the starting door can be any of the7 doors. Therefore, the total number of permutations is the sum over each starting door of the number of permutations starting from that door. As we saw, for a line, this sum is2^{n-1}.Therefore, for n=7, the answer is64. Thus, the number of different seven-digit numbers is64.Final Answerboxed{64}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves the seven members of the Running Family passing through 7 doors arranged in a line. The first person can choose any door to activate, and after completing the challenge, it activates the adjacent doors on both sides. Subsequent members must choose an unchallenged door from the activated doors, which then activates the unactivated adjacent doors. The goal is to determine the number of different seven-digit numbers formed by the order in which the doors are challenged.Key steps:1. Activation Rules: Each door, when challenged, activates its adjacent doors if they haven&#39;t been activated yet.2. Permutations: The problem is equivalent to counting the number of valid permutations of the doors where each door is challenged after at least one of its adjacent doors has been activated.3. Linear Arrangement: The doors are assumed to be in a line, given the problem&#39;s context and the mention of adjacent doors on both sides.4. Recursive Analysis: For a linear arrangement of ( n ) doors, the number of valid permutations starting from any door is ( 2^{n-1} ). This is derived from the fact that each subsequent choice can expand either left or right from the current activated segment.5. Total Permutations: For ( n = 7 ), the total number of permutations is ( 2^{6} = 64 ).Thus, the number of different possible seven-digit numbers is (boxed{64}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-43575fad></div><p class="review-content" data-v-43575fad><span class="icon" data-v-43575fad>🔑:</span>【Answer】Solution: According to the problem, each choice situation must correspond to a seven-digit number. After the first person makes a choice, the next six people only need to choose &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;. The door chosen by the first person can be completely deduced from the total situation of the next six people&#39;s &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; choices. That is, each of the next six people has two choices. Therefore, arranging the numbers of the seven doors in the order of their challenges will result in a seven-digit number, which has a total of 2^{6}=64 different possibilities.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what this inequality is saying. On the left side, we have 1 plus the square of (x + y), and on the right side, it&#39;s C multiplied by the product of (1 + x²) and (1 + y²). The goal is to determine the minimal C that makes this true for any real x and y.First, maybe I should try expanding the right-hand side to see if that gives me some insight. Let&#39;s compute (1 + x²)(1 + y²). If I multiply that out, it becomes 1*1 + 1*y² + x²*1 + x²*y², which simplifies to 1 + x² + y² + x²y². So the inequality becomes:1 + (x + y)^2 ≤ C*(1 + x² + y² + x²y²)Now, let&#39;s expand the left-hand side. (x + y)^2 is x² + 2xy + y², so adding 1 gives:1 + x² + 2xy + y² ≤ C*(1 + x² + y² + x²y²)Hmm, okay. So if I write both sides out:Left: 1 + x² + y² + 2xyRight: C*(1 + x² + y² + x²y²)Therefore, the inequality can be rewritten as:1 + x² + y² + 2xy ≤ C*(1 + x² + y² + x²y²)I need to find the smallest C such that this holds for all real x and y. Maybe I can rearrange terms to isolate C? Let me see:Divide both sides by (1 + x² + y² + x²y²):(1 + x² + y² + 2xy) / (1 + x² + y² + x²y²) ≤ CSo, C must be at least as large as the maximum value of the left-hand fraction over all real numbers x and y. Therefore, the smallest such C is the supremum (maximum) of that expression over all real x and y. So, my task reduces to finding the maximum value of f(x, y) = [1 + x² + y² + 2xy] / [1 + x² + y² + x²y²].Alright, so maybe I can analyze this function f(x, y) and find its maximum. To find the maximum, perhaps we can use calculus, setting partial derivatives to zero. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a substitution or symmetry we can exploit here.Looking at the numerator: 1 + x² + y² + 2xy = 1 + (x + y)^2. Wait, that&#39;s exactly the original left-hand side. So the expression we need to maximize is [1 + (x + y)^2] / [(1 + x²)(1 + y²)]. Hmm, interesting.I wonder if we can substitute variables here. Let me set u = x + y and v = xy. But I&#39;m not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe polar coordinates? Let&#39;s see. If we set x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ, but since x and y can vary independently, polar coordinates might not be the best approach here.Alternatively, maybe setting t = x + y and s = x - y? Not sure. Let me think.Alternatively, since the expression is symmetric in x and y in some way, perhaps we can set x = y? Let&#39;s test that. If x = y, then the expression becomes:Numerator: 1 + (2x)^2 = 1 + 4x²Denominator: (1 + x²)^2 = 1 + 2x² + x^4So f(x, x) = (1 + 4x²)/(1 + 2x² + x^4). Let&#39;s analyze this function of x. Let me set z = x², so z ≥ 0. Then f(z) = (1 + 4z)/(1 + 2z + z²). To find its maximum, take derivative with respect to z:f&#39;(z) = [4*(1 + 2z + z²) - (1 + 4z)(2 + 2z)] / (1 + 2z + z²)^2Compute numerator:4(1 + 2z + z²) - (1 + 4z)(2 + 2z)First, compute 4(1 + 2z + z²) = 4 + 8z + 4z²Then compute (1 + 4z)(2 + 2z) = 2 + 2z + 8z + 8z² = 2 + 10z + 8z²Subtract the second from the first:[4 + 8z + 4z²] - [2 + 10z + 8z²] = 4 - 2 + 8z -10z +4z² -8z² = 2 - 2z -4z²So f&#39;(z) = ( -4z² -2z + 2 ) / (denominator squared). Set numerator equal to zero:-4z² -2z + 2 = 0 ⇒ 4z² + 2z -2 =0 ⇒ 2z² + z -1=0.Solving quadratic equation: z = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +8)] /4 = [-1 ±3]/4. So z=(2)/4=0.5 or z=(-4)/4=-1. Discard negative z, so z=0.5. So critical point at z=0.5. Let&#39;s check value at z=0.5.f(0.5) = (1 +4*(0.5))/(1 +2*(0.5) + (0.5)^2) = (1 + 2)/(1 +1 +0.25) = 3 / 2.25 = 1.333... So 4/3 ≈1.333. So when x = y, the maximum ratio is 4/3. But is this the global maximum?Wait, perhaps when x and y are not equal, the ratio could be higher. Let&#39;s check another case. Suppose x = -y. Then x + y =0, so numerator is 1 +0=1. Denominator is (1 +x²)(1 + y²). Since y = -x, denominator becomes (1 +x²)^2. So f(x, -x) =1/(1 +x²)^2. The maximum of this is at x=0, which is 1. So in this case, the ratio is 1, which is less than 4/3. So maybe when x = y, we get a higher ratio.What about other possibilities? Let&#39;s consider x =0. Then the expression becomes:Numerator:1 + (0 + y)^2 =1 + y²Denominator: (1 +0)(1 + y²)=1*(1 + y²)=1 + y²So f(0, y)= (1 + y²)/(1 + y²)=1. So ratio is 1. Similarly, if y=0, ratio is 1. So in cases where one variable is zero, ratio is 1.What if x is very large and y is adjusted accordingly? Let&#39;s see. Suppose x approaches infinity, and let&#39;s set y = kx for some constant k. Then as x→∞, we can analyze the leading terms.Numerator:1 + (x + y)^2 =1 +x²(1 + k)^2Denominator: (1 +x²)(1 + y²)= (1 +x²)(1 +k²x²)≈x² * k²x² =k²x^4 for large x.So numerator ≈x²(1 +k)^2, denominator≈k²x^4. Therefore, the ratio ≈ [x²(1 +k)^2]/[k²x^4] = (1 +k)^2/(k²x²). As x→∞, this tends to zero. So for large x with y proportional to x, the ratio tends to zero. So the maximum isn&#39;t achieved at infinity.Alternatively, maybe when one variable is large and the other is something else. Let&#39;s try setting y =1/x, assuming x≠0. Then:Numerator:1 + (x +1/x)^2 =1 + x² + 2 + 1/x² =3 +x² +1/x²Denominator: (1 +x²)(1 + (1/x)^2)= (1 +x²)(1 +1/x²)= (1 +x²)(1 +1/x²)= (1 +x² +1/x² +1)=2 +x² +1/x²Therefore, f(x,1/x)= [3 +x² +1/x²]/[2 +x² +1/x²]. Let’s let z =x² +1/x². Then z ≥2 by AM ≥GM. Then numerator is z +3 -2? Wait, wait, original numerator is 3 +x² +1/x² =3 + z. Denominator is 2 + z. So f(z)=(3 + z)/(2 + z). As z ≥2, this function is increasing because derivative w.r. to z is (1*(2 + z) - (3 + z)*1)/(2 + z)^2)= (2 + z -3 -z)/(denominator squared)= (-1)/(denominator squared) &lt;0. Wait, derivative is negative. So f(z) is decreasing in z. Therefore, maximum when z is minimal, which is z=2. Therefore, f(2)= (3 +2)/(2 +2)=5/4=1.25. Which is less than 4/3≈1.333. So even in this case, maximum ratio is 1.25, still less than 4/3.Hmm. So when we set y =x, we get a maximum ratio of 4/3. When y =1/x, maximum ratio 5/4. When x or y is zero, ratio 1. When x=-y, ratio 1. So maybe 4/3 is the maximum. But how can we be sure?Alternatively, perhaps consider variables substitution. Let me set a =x + y and b=xy. Then numerator is 1 +a². Denominator is (1 +x²)(1 +y²)=1 +x² + y² +x²y². Note that x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy =a² -2b. And x²y² =b². So denominator becomes 1 + a² -2b + b². Therefore, the ratio is [1 +a²]/[1 +a² -2b +b²]. So f(a,b)= [1 +a²]/[1 +a² -2b +b²]. But now, we need to relate a and b. Since for real numbers x and y, we have the relationship that a =x + y and b=xy. Then, the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be non-negative. That is, if we fix a and b, then x and y are roots of t² -at +b=0, which requires that a² -4b ≥0. So b ≤a²/4.Therefore, given a and b, with b ≤a²/4. So our function f(a,b)= [1 +a²]/[1 +a² -2b +b²]. To maximize this, given that b ≤a²/4.So perhaps, for a fixed a, find the value of b ≤a²/4 that maximizes f(a,b). Let&#39;s fix a, then f(a,b) = (1 +a²)/(1 +a² -2b +b²). Let me denote denominator D(a,b)=1 +a² -2b +b². So to maximize f(a,b), we need to minimize D(a,b).Therefore, for fixed a, minimize D(a,b)=1 +a² -2b +b² with respect to b, given that b ≤a²/4.So take derivative of D with respect to b: dD/db= -2 +2b. Setting to zero gives b=1. But we have the constraint b ≤a²/4. So if 1 ≤a²/4, i.e., a² ≥4, then the minimum occurs at b=1. Otherwise, the minimum occurs at b=a²/4.Wait, let&#39;s see:If we can choose b to be 1 (when allowed by the constraint), that would minimize D(a,b). But since b ≤a²/4, if a²/4 ≥1, then b can be as large as a²/4, but we need to see if 1 is within the allowed range. Wait, actually, if we are trying to find the minimal D(a,b), then for fixed a, D(a,b) is a quadratic in b: D= b² -2b + (1 +a²). The quadratic in b is minimized at b=1 (vertex at b=1), with minimal value D_min =1 -2*1 + (1 +a²)= a². However, if the constraint b ≤a²/4 affects this minimum. So if the unconstrained minimum b=1 is allowed, i.e., if 1 ≤a²/4, which is equivalent to a² ≥4, then D_min =a². If a² &lt;4, then the minimal D(a,b) under the constraint b ≤a²/4 occurs at b=a²/4, since the quadratic D(a,b) is convex (coefficient of b² is positive), so the minimum under the constraint is at the boundary b=a²/4.Therefore, for each a:If a² ≥4, then minimal D(a,b)=a².If a² &lt;4, then minimal D(a,b)= (a²/4)^2 -2*(a²/4) +1 +a²Let me compute that:For a² &lt;4, D_min = (a^4)/16 - (a²/2) +1 +a² = (a^4)/16 + (a²/2) +1Therefore, the minimal D(a,b) is:D(a) = { a², if a² ≥4; (a^4)/16 + (a²/2) +1, if a² &lt;4 }Therefore, the maximum of f(a,b)= (1 +a²)/D(a) is:For a² ≥4, f(a)= (1 +a²)/a² =1 +1/a². Since a² ≥4, this is ≤1 +1/4=1.25.For a² &lt;4, f(a)= (1 +a²)/[(a^4)/16 + (a²/2) +1]Therefore, the maximum of f(a,b) over all real x,y is the maximum between the maximum of 1 +1/a² over a² ≥4 (which is 1.25) and the maximum of (1 +a²)/[(a^4)/16 + (a²/2) +1] over a² &lt;4. We need to check which is larger.So let&#39;s compute the maximum of the function g(a²)= (1 +a²)/[(a^4)/16 + (a²/2) +1] for 0 ≤a² &lt;4.Let’s set t = a², so 0 ≤ t &lt;4. Then g(t) = (1 +t)/[(t^2)/16 + t/2 +1]Simplify denominator: (t^2)/16 + t/2 +1 = (t^2 +8t +16)/16 = (t +4)^2 /16Wait, is that correct?Wait, (t^2)/16 + t/2 +1 = (t² +8t +16)/16. Let&#39;s check:t²/16 +8t/16 +16/16 = t²/16 + t/2 +1. Yes, correct. So denominator is (t +4)^2 /16. Therefore, g(t) = (1 +t)/[(t +4)^2 /16] =16*(1 + t)/(t +4)^2.Therefore, g(t) =16*(1 + t)/(t +4)^2. So we need to find the maximum of this function for t ∈[0,4).Let’s compute derivative of g(t):g(t) =16*(1 + t)/(t +4)^2.Let’s compute g’(t):g’(t) =16*[ (1*(t +4)^2 - (1 + t)*2(t +4) ) ] / (t +4)^4Simplify numerator:(t +4)^2 -2(1 + t)(t +4) = (t +4)[(t +4) -2(1 + t)] = (t +4)[t +4 -2 -2t] = (t +4)(-t +2)Therefore, g’(t) =16*( - (t -2)(t +4) ) / (t +4)^4 )=16*(- (t -2))/(t +4)^3 )= -16(t -2)/(t +4)^3.Set derivative equal to zero:-16(t -2)/(t +4)^3 =0 ⇒ t -2=0 ⇒ t=2.So critical point at t=2. Check the endpoints t=0 and t=4 (though t=4 is not included as a² approaches 4 from below).Compute g(0)=16*(1 +0)/(0 +4)^2=16*1/16=1.Compute g(2)=16*(1 +2)/(2 +4)^2=16*3/36=16*1/12=4/3≈1.333.Compute limit as t→4 from the left: lim_{t→4^-} g(t)=16*(1 +4)/(4 +4)^2=16*5/64=80/64=5/4=1.25.So the maximum of g(t) on [0,4) is at t=2, which is 4/3. So for a² &lt;4, the maximum ratio is 4/3, which occurs at t=2, i.e., a²=2, so a=√2 or -√2. But since we are dealing with a², it&#39;s symmetric.Therefore, combining both cases:- For a² ≥4, maximum ratio is 1.25- For a² &lt;4, maximum ratio is 4/3≈1.333Therefore, the overall maximum of the ratio f(x,y) is 4/3, which occurs when a²=2, i.e., when x + y= ±√2, and b=a²/4=2/4=0.5. Recall that b=xy=0.5. So we have x + y=√2 and xy=0.5. Let&#39;s solve for x and y.From x + y=√2 and xy=0.5. The quadratic equation is t² -√2 t +0.5=0.Solutions:t=(√2 ±√(2 -2))/2=(√2 ±0)/2=√2/2. So x=y=√2/2.Similarly, for x + y=-√2, we get x=y=-√2/2.Therefore, the maximum occurs when x=y=√2/2 or x=y=-√2/2.Therefore, substituting back into the original expression:Numerator:1 + (x + y)^2=1 + (√2)^2=1 +2=3Denominator:(1 +x²)(1 +y²)= (1 + (√2/2)^2)^2= (1 +0.5)^2= (1.5)^2=2.25So 3/2.25=4/3, which checks out.Thus, the maximum value of the ratio is 4/3, so the smallest possible C is 4/3.Therefore, the answer is C=4/3.Final AnswerThe smallest constant is boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest constant ( C ) such that for all real ( x ) and ( y ),[1 + (x + y)^2 leq C cdot (1 + x^2) cdot (1 + y^2),]we start by expanding both sides of the inequality. The left-hand side becomes:[1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy,]and the right-hand side expands to:[C cdot (1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2).]We need to find the smallest ( C ) such that:[1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy leq C cdot (1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2).]Rewriting this, we need:[frac{1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy}{1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2} leq C.]To find the maximum value of the left-hand side ratio, we analyze the function ( f(x, y) = frac{1 + (x + y)^2}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)} ).By setting ( x = y ), we simplify the function to:[f(x, x) = frac{1 + 4x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2}.]Letting ( z = x^2 ), we get:[f(z) = frac{1 + 4z}{(1 + z)^2}.]Taking the derivative and solving for critical points, we find the maximum value occurs at ( z = 0.5 ), giving ( f(0.5) = frac{4}{3} ).Further analysis considering other cases (such as ( x = -y ), ( x = 0 ), ( y = 0 ), and large values of ( x ) and ( y )) shows that the maximum ratio remains ( frac{4}{3} ).By verifying with substitutions and solving the quadratic equation for ( x ) and ( y ), we confirm that the maximum value of the ratio is indeed ( frac{4}{3} ).Thus, the smallest constant ( C ) is:[boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the smallest constant C such that for all real numbers x and y, the inequality 1 + (x + y)^2 ≤ C * (1 + x^2)(1 + y^2) holds. Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, I should probably try to understand what this inequality is saying. On the left side, we have 1 plus the square of (x + y). On the right side, it&#39;s C multiplied by the product of (1 + x²) and (1 + y²). The goal is to find the smallest possible C that makes this true for any real x and y. Maybe I can start by expanding both sides to see if that simplifies things. Let&#39;s expand the left side first: 1 + (x + y)^2. Expanding (x + y)^2 gives x² + 2xy + y², so the left side becomes 1 + x² + 2xy + y².Now the right side: C*(1 + x²)*(1 + y²). Let&#39;s expand that. Multiplying (1 + x²) and (1 + y²) gives 1 + x² + y² + x²y². So the right side is C*(1 + x² + y² + x²y²).So rewriting the inequality with these expansions:1 + x² + 2xy + y² ≤ C*(1 + x² + y² + x²y²)Now, maybe I can rearrange this inequality to solve for C. Let&#39;s subtract the left side from both sides to see what we need:C*(1 + x² + y² + x²y²) - (1 + x² + y² + 2xy) ≥ 0Hmm, but that might not be the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, I can express C as:C ≥ [1 + x² + y² + 2xy] / [1 + x² + y² + x²y²]So C must be greater than or equal to this fraction for all real x and y. Therefore, the smallest such C is the supremum (the least upper bound) of this fraction over all real numbers x and y. So, essentially, I need to find the maximum value of [1 + x² + y² + 2xy] / [1 + x² + y² + x²y²] for real x and y. Then that maximum value will be the smallest C.So, the problem reduces to optimizing the function f(x, y) = [1 + x² + y² + 2xy] / [1 + x² + y² + x²y²]. Maybe I can simplify this expression or use some substitution.Looking at the numerator: 1 + x² + y² + 2xy. Notice that x² + y² + 2xy is (x + y)^2. So the numerator is 1 + (x + y)^2, which is exactly the left side of the original inequality. The denominator is (1 + x²)(1 + y²), which is the right side divided by C.Alternatively, maybe substituting variables. Let me think. Let’s set u = x + y and v = xy. Then, x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = u² - 2v. So numerator becomes 1 + u², and denominator becomes 1 + u² - 2v + v². Hmm, but not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe there&#39;s another way.Alternatively, notice that the denominator is 1 + x² + y² + x²y² = (1 + x²)(1 + y²). So maybe if I set t = x y, but not sure. Alternatively, consider polar coordinates. Let’s suppose that x and y are real numbers, maybe set x = tan a, y = tan b, since 1 + x² = sec² a, but that might be useful.Wait, let&#39;s try that substitution. Let’s set x = tan α and y = tan β, where α and β are real numbers. Then, 1 + x² = sec² α and 1 + y² = sec² β. So the denominator becomes sec² α * sec² β. The left side numerator is 1 + (tan α + tan β)^2. Let&#39;s compute that.First, compute (tan α + tan β)^2 = tan² α + 2 tan α tan β + tan² β. Then 1 + that is 1 + tan² α + tan² β + 2 tan α tan β. But 1 + tan² α = sec² α, so substituting that in, we have sec² α + tan² β + 2 tan α tan β. Hmm, not sure if that simplifies.Wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s note that 1 + (x + y)^2 = 1 + x² + y² + 2xy. And the denominator is (1 + x²)(1 + y²) = 1 + x² + y² + x² y². Therefore, the ratio is [1 + x² + y² + 2xy] / [1 + x² + y² + x² y²]. Let&#39;s denote S = x + y and P = xy. Then, x² + y² = S² - 2P. Therefore, the numerator becomes 1 + S² - 2P + 2P = 1 + S². The denominator becomes 1 + S² - 2P + P². So, f(x, y) = (1 + S²) / (1 + S² - 2P + P²). Hmm, interesting. So in terms of S and P, the function is (1 + S²) / (1 + S² - 2P + P²). But how do we relate S and P? For given S, P can vary. For example, given S = x + y, the maximum possible P is S² / 4 (by AM-GM), but since x and y can be any real numbers, P can be anything from negative infinity up to S² / 4. Hmm.Wait, but maybe instead of substituting S and P, we can consider that for fixed x, y can vary, or maybe use symmetry. Let&#39;s see if the maximum occurs when x = y. Maybe test some specific cases.First, let&#39;s try x = y. Let x = y = t. Then the function becomes [1 + (2t)^2] / [(1 + t²)^2] = (1 + 4t²) / (1 + 2t² + t⁴). Let&#39;s compute this for some t. When t = 0, it&#39;s 1/1 = 1. When t approaches infinity, the leading terms are 4t² / t⁴ = 4 / t², which approaches 0. So maybe the maximum is at some finite t. Take derivative with respect to t to find maximum.Let’s compute derivative of f(t) = (1 + 4t²)/(1 + 2t² + t⁴). Let’s set f(t) = numerator / denominator. Then f’(t) = [ (8t)(denominator) - (1 + 4t²)(4t + 4t³) ] / denominator².Compute numerator:8t*(1 + 2t² + t⁴) - (1 + 4t²)*(4t + 4t³)First term: 8t + 16t³ + 8t^5Second term: (1)(4t) + (1)(4t³) + (4t²)(4t) + (4t²)(4t³) = 4t + 4t³ + 16t³ + 16t^5 = 4t + 20t³ + 16t^5So subtract second term from first term:(8t + 16t³ + 8t^5) - (4t + 20t³ + 16t^5) = (8t - 4t) + (16t³ - 20t³) + (8t^5 - 16t^5) = 4t - 4t³ - 8t^5Set this equal to zero: 4t - 4t³ - 8t^5 = 0 =&gt; t(4 - 4t² - 8t^4) = 0Solutions: t = 0, or 4 - 4t² - 8t^4 = 0 =&gt; divide by 4: 1 - t² - 2t^4 = 0 =&gt; 2t^4 + t² - 1 = 0Let u = t², so 2u² + u -1 =0. Solve quadratic equation:u = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / (4) = [-1 ± 3]/4So u = (2)/4 = 1/2 or u = (-4)/4 = -1. Discard negative solution, so u = 1/2. Therefore t² = 1/2, so t = ±1/√2.So critical points at t = 0, t = ±1/√2. We already saw that t=0 gives 1, t approaching infinity gives 0. Let&#39;s check t=1/√2:f(1/√2) = (1 + 4*(1/2)) / (1 + 2*(1/2) + (1/2)^2) = (1 + 2) / (1 + 1 + 1/4) = 3 / (2.25) = 3 / (9/4) = 12/9 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...So when x = y =1/√2, the ratio is 4/3. So maybe 4/3 is a candidate. But is this the maximum? Or could there be a higher value when x and y are not equal?Let me test another case. Suppose x = -y. Then, x + y =0, so numerator becomes 1 +0=1. Denominator becomes (1 +x²)(1 + y²)= (1 +x²)^2. So the ratio is 1/(1 + x²)^2. This is maximized when x=0, giving 1, which is less than 4/3. So that case doesn&#39;t give a higher value.What if we set y = kx for some constant k, then try to optimize over k and x? Let’s try that substitution. Let y = kx. Then, f(x, kx) = [1 + (x + kx)^2] / [(1 + x²)(1 + (k x)^2)] = [1 + x²(1 + k)^2] / [(1 + x²)(1 + k² x²)].Let’s denote t = x². Since x is real, t ≥0. Then, the function becomes [1 + t(1 + k)^2] / [(1 + t)(1 + k² t)].Now, we can treat this as a function of t for fixed k, and try to find the maximum over t ≥0. Then, maybe take the derivative with respect to t and set to zero.Alternatively, perhaps set k=1, which is the case we considered earlier (x=y). But maybe for other k values, the maximum is higher.Let’s pick k=2. Then f(t) = [1 + t*(3)^2]/[(1 + t)(1 +4t)] = [1 +9t]/[(1 + t)(1 +4t)]. Let’s compute this at t=0: 1/(1*1)=1. As t→∞, numerator ~9t, denominator ~4t², so ratio ~9/(4t) →0. So maximum somewhere in between.Take derivative: Let’s compute f(t) = (1 +9t)/[(1 + t)(1 +4t)]. Let’s denote numerator N=1+9t, denominator D=(1+t)(1+4t)=1 +5t +4t². Then f(t)=N/D. The derivative f’(t)=(N’ D - N D’)/D².Compute N’=9, D’=5 +8t. Therefore,f’(t)= [9*(1 +5t +4t²) - (1 +9t)*(5 +8t)] / (D²)Compute numerator:9*(1 +5t +4t²) =9 +45t +36t²(1 +9t)*(5 +8t) =5 +8t +45t +72t² =5 +53t +72t²Subtract: [9 +45t +36t²] - [5 +53t +72t²] =4 -8t -36t²Set equal to zero: 4 -8t -36t² =0 =&gt; 36t² +8t -4=0. Divide by 4:9t² +2t -1=0.Solution: t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 36)] / (18) = [-2 ± sqrt(40)] /18 = [-2 ± 2*sqrt(10)] /18 = [-1 ± sqrt(10)] /9.Only positive solution is t = [ -1 + sqrt(10) ] /9 ≈ (-1 +3.162)/9≈2.162/9≈0.24.Compute f(t) at t≈0.24:N=1 +9*0.24≈1 +2.16=3.16D=(1 +0.24)(1 +4*0.24)=1.24*(1 +0.96)=1.24*1.96≈2.4304So ratio≈3.16 /2.4304≈1.299. Which is approximately 1.3, which is slightly less than 4/3≈1.333. So in this case, the maximum for k=2 is less than 4/3.Maybe test another k. Let&#39;s try k=3. Then f(t) = [1 + t*(4)^2]/[(1 +t)(1 +9t)] = [1 +16t]/[(1 +t)(1 +9t)]. Compute the derivative:N=1+16t, D=(1 +t)(1 +9t)=1 +10t +9t²N’=16, D’=10 +18tf’(t)= [16*(1 +10t +9t²) - (1 +16t)*(10 +18t)] / D²Compute numerator:16*(1 +10t +9t²)=16 +160t +144t²(1 +16t)*(10 +18t)=10 +18t +160t +288t²=10 +178t +288t²Subtract: (16 +160t +144t²) - (10 +178t +288t²)=6 -18t -144t²Set to zero: 6 -18t -144t²=0 =&gt; 144t² +18t -6=0 =&gt; divide by 6:24t² +3t -1=0Solutions: t = [-3 ± sqrt(9 +96)] /48 = [-3 ± sqrt(105)] /48 ≈ [-3 ±10.24695]/48. Positive solution: (7.24695)/48≈0.151.Compute f(t) at t≈0.151:N=1 +16*0.151≈1 +2.416≈3.416D=(1 +0.151)(1 +9*0.151)=1.151*(1 +1.359)=1.151*2.359≈2.716So ratio≈3.416 /2.716≈1.258. Which is less than 4/3.Hmm, so as k increases, the maximum ratio seems to decrease. Similarly, if k is between 0 and1, perhaps.Let’s try k=0.5. So y=0.5x. Then, f(t)= [1 + (x +0.5x)^2]/[(1 +x²)(1 +0.25x²)] = [1 + (1.5x)^2]/[(1 +x²)(1 +0.25x²)] = [1 +2.25x²]/[ (1 +x²)(1 +0.25x²) ]Let t =x², so f(t)= [1 +2.25t]/[(1 +t)(1 +0.25t)]. Compute derivative:N=1 +2.25t, D=(1 +t)(1 +0.25t)=1 +1.25t +0.25t²N’=2.25, D’=1.25 +0.5tf’(t)= [2.25*(1 +1.25t +0.25t²) - (1 +2.25t)*(1.25 +0.5t)] / D²Compute numerator:2.25*(1 +1.25t +0.25t²) =2.25 +2.8125t +0.5625t²(1 +2.25t)*(1.25 +0.5t) =1*1.25 +1*0.5t +2.25t*1.25 +2.25t*0.5t =1.25 +0.5t +2.8125t +1.125t²=1.25 +3.3125t +1.125t²Subtract: [2.25 +2.8125t +0.5625t²] - [1.25 +3.3125t +1.125t²] = (2.25 -1.25) + (2.8125t -3.3125t) + (0.5625t² -1.125t²) =1 -0.5t -0.5625t²Set equal to zero:1 -0.5t -0.5625t²=0. Multiply by -16 to eliminate decimals: -16 +8t +9t²=0 =&gt;9t² +8t -16=0Solutions: t = [ -8 ± sqrt(64 + 576) ] /18= [ -8 ± sqrt(640) ] /18= [ -8 ± 8*sqrt(10) ] /18= [ -1 ± sqrt(10) ] / (2.25). Wait, let me check:Wait, sqrt(640)=sqrt(64*10)=8*sqrt(10). So:t = [ -8 ±8sqrt(10) ] /18= [ -4 ±4sqrt(10) ] /9. Only positive solution is [ -4 +4sqrt(10) ] /9≈ [ -4 +12.649 ] /9≈8.649/9≈0.961.Compute f(t) at t≈0.961:N=1 +2.25*0.961≈1 +2.162≈3.162D=(1 +0.961)(1 +0.25*0.961)=1.961*(1 +0.240)=1.961*1.240≈2.432Ratio≈3.162 /2.432≈1.3. Still less than 4/3≈1.333.So, so far, when x=y, we have a higher ratio. Let me check another case where x and y are not equal but perhaps with different signs. Suppose x=1 and y is some variable. Let’s set x=1 and vary y. Then the function becomes [1 + (1 + y)^2]/[(1 +1)(1 + y²)] = [1 +1 +2y + y²]/[2(1 + y²)] = [2 + 2y + y²]/[2(1 + y²)] = [y² +2y +2]/[2y² +2].Simplify: (y² +2y +2)/(2y² +2) = (y² +2y +2)/(2(y² +1)). Let’s denote this as f(y).Find the maximum of f(y). Take derivative:f’(y)= [ (2y +2)(2y² +2) - (y² +2y +2)(4y) ] / [2(y² +1)]²Compute numerator:(2y +2)(2y² +2) =4y³ +4y +4y² +4(y² +2y +2)(4y) =4y³ +8y² +8ySubtract: [4y³ +4y +4y² +4] - [4y³ +8y² +8y] = (0y³) + (-4y²) + (-4y) +4Set to zero: -4y² -4y +4=0 =&gt; divide by -4: y² + y -1=0. Solutions: y = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +4)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(5)]/2.Approximately, y≈[-1 +2.236]/2≈1.236/2≈0.618 or y≈-1.618.Compute f(y) at y≈0.618:y≈0.618. Compute numerator: (0.618)^2 +2*0.618 +2≈0.618²≈0.381 +1.236 +2≈3.617. Denominator:2*(0.618² +1)≈2*(0.381 +1)=2*1.381≈2.762. So ratio≈3.617/2.762≈1.309.At y≈-1.618:y≈-1.618. Compute numerator: (-1.618)^2 +2*(-1.618) +2≈2.618 -3.236 +2≈1.382. Denominator:2*((-1.618)^2 +1)=2*(2.618 +1)=2*3.618≈7.236. Ratio≈1.382/7.236≈0.191. So maximum here is≈1.309, still less than 4/3≈1.333.Hmm, so even when fixing x=1, the maximum ratio is about1.309. So still, when x=y=1/√2, we get 4/3≈1.333, which is higher.Wait, maybe try another substitution. Let’s suppose that we set x = y, but not necessarily both equal to t. Wait, we already did that. Alternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum of f(x,y)=[1 + (x + y)^2]/[(1 +x²)(1 + y²)].Set up the function f(x, y) = [1 + (x + y)^2]/[(1 +x²)(1 + y²)]. We need to find its maximum over real x and y.Taking partial derivatives with respect to x and y, setting them equal to zero.But this might be complicated, but let&#39;s try.First, compute partial derivative of f with respect to x.Let’s denote numerator N=1 + (x + y)^2, denominator D=(1 +x²)(1 + y²). Then f = N/D.Compute ∂f/∂x = (D*N’_x - N*D’_x)/D²Compute N’_x = 2(x + y)Compute D’_x = 2x(1 + y²)So,∂f/∂x = [2(x + y)(1 +x²)(1 + y²) - N*2x(1 + y²)] / D²Factor out 2(1 + y²):= [2(1 + y²)[(x + y)(1 +x²) - xN]] / D²But N =1 + (x + y)^2. Let’s expand (x + y)(1 +x²):= x + y + x³ +x² yThen subtract xN:= x + y + x³ +x² y -x[1 + (x + y)^2]= x + y + x³ +x² y -x -x(x² + 2xy + y²)= y +x³ +x² y -x³ -2x² y -x y²= y -x² y -x y²= y(1 -x² -x y)Thus, ∂f/∂x = [2(1 + y²)* y(1 -x² -x y)] / D²Similarly, ∂f/∂y will be symmetric:∂f/∂y = [2(1 +x²)* x(1 -y² -x y)] / D²Setting these partial derivatives to zero:For ∂f/∂x =0: Either y=0 or (1 -x² -x y)=0Similarly, ∂f/∂y=0: Either x=0 or (1 -y² -x y)=0So critical points occur when either x or y is zero, or when both 1 -x² -x y=0 and 1 -y² -x y=0.Case 1: y=0.Then f(x,0)= [1 +x²]/[(1 +x²)(1 +0)]=1. So value is 1.Case 2: x=0.Similarly, f(0,y)=1.Case3: Both 1 -x² -x y=0 and 1 -y² -x y=0.From these two equations:1 -x² -x y=0 (1)1 -y² -x y=0 (2)Subtracting (2)-(1): -y² +x² =0 =&gt;x² = y² =&gt; y=±x.Subcases:Subcase3a: y =xThen plug into equation (1):1 -x² -x²=0 =&gt;1 -2x²=0 =&gt;x²=1/2 =&gt;x=±1/√2.Thus, points (1/√2,1/√2) and (-1/√2,-1/√2). Compute f at these points:f(1/√2,1/√2)= [1 + (2/√2)^2]/[(1 +1/2)^2]= [1 + (√2*2)^2 /2 ] Wait, wait. Wait, (x + y)=2*(1/√2)=√2. Then (x + y)^2=2. So numerator=1 +2=3.Denominator=(1 + (1/2))*(1 + (1/2))= (3/2)*(3/2)=9/4. So f=3/(9/4)=12/9=4/3≈1.333.Similarly for (-1/√2,-1/√2): same value since squares.Subcase3b: y = -xThen plug into equation (1):1 -x² -x*(-x)=1 -x² +x²=1=0. But 1=0 is impossible. Contradiction. Thus, no solution in this subcase.Therefore, the only critical points with non-zero x and y are when y=x=±1/√2. And at these points, the ratio is 4/3. Other critical points (x or y zero) give ratio 1.Therefore, the maximum of f(x, y) is 4/3, which is achieved at x=y=1/√2 and x=y=-1/√2.Hence, the smallest constant C is 4/3.But wait, let me check if there are any other critical points that I might have missed. For example, when both partial derivatives are zero due to the other factors. Wait, in the partial derivatives, the factors were y(1 -x² -x y) and x(1 -y² -x y). So, for both partial derivatives to be zero, either:- y=0 and x=0: which gives f(0,0)=1/(1*1)=1.- y=0 and (1 -y² -x y)=0: if y=0, then the second equation becomes 1=0, impossible.Similarly, x=0 and (1 -x² -x y)=0: x=0 leads to 1=0, impossible.Or both (1 -x² -x y)=0 and (1 -y² -x y)=0, which gives us the previous case y=±x.Therefore, the only critical points are the ones considered, leading to the maximum of 4/3.Therefore, the minimal constant C is 4/3.Final AnswerThe smallest constant is boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest constant ( C ) such that for all real ( x ) and ( y ), the inequality[ 1 + (x + y)^2 leq C cdot (1 + x^2) cdot (1 + y^2) ]holds, we start by expanding both sides of the inequality. The left side becomes:[ 1 + (x + y)^2 = 1 + x^2 + 2xy + y^2. ]The right side expands to:[ C cdot (1 + x^2) cdot (1 + y^2) = C cdot (1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2). ]We need to find the smallest ( C ) such that:[ 1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy leq C cdot (1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2). ]Rewriting this inequality to solve for ( C ), we get:[ C geq frac{1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy}{1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2}. ]We need to find the maximum value of the right-hand side expression for all real ( x ) and ( y ). By substituting ( x = y ), we simplify the expression:[ frac{1 + (2x)^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = frac{1 + 4x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2}. ]Taking the derivative and finding critical points, we determine that the maximum value occurs at ( x = pm frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). Substituting ( x = y = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) into the expression, we get:[ frac{1 + (2 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}})^2}{(1 + (frac{1}{sqrt{2}})^2)^2} = frac{1 + 2}{(1 + frac{1}{2})^2} = frac{3}{(frac{3}{2})^2} = frac{3}{frac{9}{4}} = frac{4}{3}. ]Using Lagrange multipliers and checking other critical points, we confirm that the maximum value of the expression is indeed ( frac{4}{3} ), achieved when ( x = y = pm frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ).Thus, the smallest constant ( C ) is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-43575fad></div><p class="review-content" data-v-43575fad><span class="icon" data-v-43575fad>🔑:</span>1. We start with the given inequality:   [   1 + (x + y)^2 leq C cdot (1 + x^2) cdot (1 + y^2)   ]   We need to find the smallest constant ( C ) such that this inequality holds for all real ( x ) and ( y ).2. Expand both sides of the inequality:   [   1 + (x + y)^2 = 1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy   ]   [   (1 + x^2)(1 + y^2) = 1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2   ]   Thus, the inequality becomes:   [   1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy leq C (1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2)   ]3. To find the smallest ( C ), we consider the ratio:   [   frac{1 + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy}{1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2} leq C   ]   Let ( A = x^2 + y^2 ). Then the inequality becomes:   [   frac{1 + A + 2xy}{1 + A + x^2y^2} leq C   ]4. To maximize the left-hand side (LHS), we need to minimize ( A ). Note that ( x^2 + y^2 geq 2xy ) by the AM-GM inequality. Let ( x^2 + y^2 = 2xy = a ). Then ( x^2y^2 = left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 = frac{a^2}{4} ).5. Substitute ( a ) into the inequality:   [   frac{1 + a + a}{1 + a + frac{a^2}{4}} = frac{1 + 2a}{1 + a + frac{a^2}{4}}   ]6. To find the maximum value of this expression, we take the derivative with respect to ( a ):   [   L(a) = frac{1 + 2a}{1 + a + frac{a^2}{4}}   ]   [   frac{dL}{da} = frac{(1 + a + frac{a^2}{4}) cdot 2 - (1 + 2a) cdot left(1 + frac{a}{2}right)}{left(1 + a + frac{a^2}{4}right)^2}   ]   Simplify the numerator:   [   2(1 + a + frac{a^2}{4}) - (1 + 2a)(1 + frac{a}{2}) = 2 + 2a + frac{a^2}{2} - (1 + 2a + frac{a}{2} + a^2) = 1 - frac{a^2}{2}   ]   Set the numerator to zero to find the critical points:   [   1 - frac{a^2}{2} = 0 implies a^2 = 2 implies a = sqrt{2}   ]7. Substitute ( a = sqrt{2} ) back into the expression for ( L(a) ):   [   L(sqrt{2}) = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1 + sqrt{2} + frac{(sqrt{2})^2}{4}} = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1 + sqrt{2} + frac{2}{4}} = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1 + sqrt{2} + frac{1}{2}} = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1.5 + sqrt{2}}   ]8. Simplify the expression:   [   L(sqrt{2}) = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1.5 + sqrt{2}} = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1.5 + sqrt{2}} = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1.5 + sqrt{2}} = frac{1 + 2sqrt{2}}{1.5 + sqrt{2}}   ]9. The maximum value of ( L(a) ) is found to be ( frac{4}{3} ). Therefore, the smallest constant ( C ) is:   [   C = frac{4}{3}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{4}{3}}).</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-95c350c8><span data-v-95c350c8>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
