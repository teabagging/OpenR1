First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. So, we have a football league with n teams, each playing every other team exactly once. Wins give 3 points, draws 1, and losses 0. After the league ends, some teams might be disqualified, which cancels their match results. The remaining teams have their scores recalculated, and the highest scorer among them is the champion. The function f_i(T) is the minimum number of teams that need to be disqualified so that team i becomes the champion. Then F(T) is the sum of all f_i(T) for each team. We need to find the maximum and minimum possible values of F(T) when n is at least 5.Hmm. So, for each team, we have to figure out the smallest number of teams to disqualify so that when we recalculate the points, that team has the highest score. Then add all those minimal numbers up for all teams, and find the maximum and minimum possible sums across all possible tournaments T.First, let&#39;s think about the minimal number of disqualifications needed for a particular team to become champion. To make team i the champion, we need to ensure that all other teams have a lower score than team i in the recalculated standings. Since disqualifying a team cancels all their matches, this can affect the points of the remaining teams. So, if team j has earned points from matches against team k, and team k is disqualified, those points from their match against k are erased.Therefore, when we disqualify teams, we might be reducing the points of other teams, which could help team i become the champion. However, we need to do this with as few disqualifications as possible.To minimize the number of disqualifications for making team i the champion, we probably need to identify the teams that have higher original scores than team i, or teams that even after some disqualifications could still have higher scores. Then, disqualify those teams. Alternatively, maybe we can disqualify teams that have beaten team i, but I need to think carefully.Wait, but disqualifying a team affects the points of other teams. For example, if team A beat team B, and we disqualify team B, then team A loses the 3 points they earned from that match. So, disqualifying a team can lower the points of other teams. But it can also remove points that other teams earned against the disqualified team.So, if team i has a certain number of points, and other teams have more points, we might need to disqualify some teams to lower the other teams&#39; points below team i&#39;s recalculated points.But team i&#39;s points might also be affected by disqualifications. For instance, if team i earned points from matches against teams that are disqualified, those points would be canceled. So, to maximize team i&#39;s points after disqualifications, we should avoid disqualifying teams that team i has beaten or drawn with, because that would remove team i&#39;s points from those matches.Therefore, perhaps the optimal strategy for minimizing the number of disqualifications needed for team i to be champion is to disqualify teams that have higher original points than team i, and also teams that, even after some disqualifications, still have points higher than team i. But this might get complicated.Alternatively, maybe the minimal number of disqualifications required for team i is equal to the number of teams that have a strictly higher score than team i, plus possibly some others whose disqualification would lower the scores of the remaining teams below team i&#39;s score. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s take a simple example. Suppose there are 5 teams. Let’s say team 1 has 10 points, teams 2, 3, 4, 5 have 12, 11, 9, 8 points respectively. Then, to make team 1 the champion, we need to disqualify teams 2 and 3 because they have higher points. So f_1(T) would be 2. But maybe if disqualifying team 2 also causes team 3&#39;s points to decrease? For example, if team 3 had a win against team 2, then disqualifying team 2 would remove 3 points from team 3. If team 3&#39;s original points were 11, and after disqualifying team 2, they lose 3 points, their new score is 8, which is below team 1&#39;s 10. So in this case, f_1(T) would only require disqualifying team 2, because team 3&#39;s points would drop below team 1&#39;s. Therefore, f_i(T) isn&#39;t necessarily just the number of teams above team i, but depends on how disqualifying certain teams affects the others.Therefore, the problem becomes more complex because disqualifying one team can lower the points of multiple other teams, potentially reducing the number of teams that need to be disqualified. So, perhaps the minimal number of disqualifications is not straightforward.To formalize, for each team i, we need a set S of teams to disqualify such that:1. Team i is not in S.2. After disqualifying all teams in S, team i&#39;s score is higher than all other remaining teams.3. The size of S is minimized.So, the key is to find the smallest S such that all teams not in S ∪ {i} have a score less than team i&#39;s score after recalculating.But team i&#39;s score after disqualifying S is equal to their original score minus the points they earned from matches against teams in S. Similarly, the other teams not in S ∪ {i} have their scores reduced by the points they earned from matches against teams in S.Therefore, to ensure that team i&#39;s remaining score is greater than all other remaining teams, we have to make sure that for each other team j not in S, the score of j minus points from matches against S is less than team i&#39;s score minus points from matches against S.Wait, so team i&#39;s remaining score is: original score - points from matches against teams in S.Similarly, team j&#39;s remaining score is: original score - points from matches against teams in S.Therefore, to have team i&#39;s remaining score &gt; team j&#39;s remaining score for all j not in S, we need:(Original score of i - points from S) &gt; (Original score of j - points from S) for all j ≠ i, j not in S.Which simplifies to:Original score of i - Original score of j &gt; (points from S of i - points from S of j).But the points from S of i and j can be different. Let&#39;s denote P_i(S) as the points team i earned from matches against teams in S. Then the inequality becomes:(Original score of i - P_i(S)) &gt; (Original score of j - P_j(S)) for all j ≠ i, j not in S.So, rearranged:Original score of i - Original score of j &gt; P_i(S) - P_j(S).But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe there&#39;s another way to look at it.Alternatively, the remaining score of team i is S_i = Original score of i - P_i(S).Similarly, remaining score of team j is S_j = Original score of j - P_j(S).We need S_i &gt; S_j for all j ≠ i, j not in S.So, S_i - S_j &gt; 0.Which is (Original score of i - P_i(S)) - (Original score of j - P_j(S)) &gt; 0.Which simplifies to (Original score of i - Original score of j) - (P_i(S) - P_j(S)) &gt; 0.Therefore, (Original score of i - Original score of j) &gt; (P_i(S) - P_j(S)).Hmm. So, the difference in original scores between i and j must be greater than the difference in points they earned from the disqualified teams.This is a bit tricky. Let&#39;s see if we can find a way to model this.Suppose team i&#39;s original score is s_i, and team j&#39;s original score is s_j. Then, we need s_i - P_i(S) &gt; s_j - P_j(S).Which can be rewritten as (s_i - s_j) &gt; P_i(S) - P_j(S).But since S is a set of teams we are disqualifying, the points P_i(S) and P_j(S) depend on the matches between i and S, and j and S.Therefore, if we can choose S such that for each j, the difference (P_i(S) - P_j(S)) is less than (s_i - s_j), then team i will remain above team j.But this seems to be a per-team condition. However, S has to be a common set that works for all j not in S.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem or use some combinatorial optimization.Alternatively, maybe we can consider that for each team j that is a threat to team i (i.e., s_j &gt;= s_i or s_j can become higher after some disqualifications), we need to either disqualify j or disqualify teams that contribute to j&#39;s high score.But this is vague. Let&#39;s think of some examples.Suppose n=5. Let’s assume all teams have the same score. Then, if all teams have the same score, to make team i champion, we need to disqualify all other teams, because otherwise, they would have the same score as team i. So f_i(T) would be 4 in this case. Therefore, F(T) would be 5*4=20. But perhaps this is the maximum?But wait, maybe not. If all teams have the same score, then each f_i(T) is 4, so F(T)=4n. For n=5, that&#39;s 20. But if the tournament is structured such that for some teams, you can disqualify fewer teams to make them champion, then F(T) could be lower.Alternatively, if there&#39;s a tournament where one team is extremely strong, maybe f_i(T) for that team is 0 (since it&#39;s already the champion), and for the others, maybe you have to disqualify that strong team and perhaps others. But let&#39;s think.First, let&#39;s consider the minimal possible F(T). To minimize F(T), we need each f_i(T) to be as small as possible. So, ideally, for each team i, there&#39;s a small number of teams that need to be disqualified to make i champion.How can we arrange the tournament so that each team can become champion by disqualifying few teams?Perhaps if each team has a high score, but their scores are dependent on matches against specific other teams. So, if we can have each team&#39;s score be reducible by disqualifying one or two other teams.Alternatively, consider a tournament where each team has a unique set of teams they have defeated. For example, a cyclic pattern: team 1 beats team 2, team 2 beats team 3, ..., team n beats team 1, and all other matches are draws. In such a tournament, each team has 3 points from one win and 1 point from each draw with the remaining n-2 teams. So, each team&#39;s total score is 3 + (n-2)*1 = n+1 points.Wait, but if all teams have the same score, then as before, you need to disqualify all other teams to make any one team champion. Therefore, in this case, F(T) would be 4n, which for n=5 is 20. But perhaps this isn&#39;t the minimum.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a tournament setup where each team can become champion by disqualifying only one team. For example, suppose that for each team i, there is one other team j such that team i&#39;s score is just below team j&#39;s score. Then, disqualifying team j would make team i the champion. Then, f_i(T) =1 for each team i, so F(T) =n. But is this possible?Wait, let&#39;s see. Suppose n=5. If we arrange the tournament so that each team has a score slightly lower than the next team. For example, team 1 has 12 points, team 2 has 11, team 3 has 10, team 4 has 9, team 5 has 8. Then, to make team 5 the champion, you need to disqualify teams 1-4, which is 4 disqualifications. To make team 4 the champion, you need to disqualify teams 1-3, which is 3. Similarly, team 3 needs 2, team 2 needs 1, team 1 needs 0. Then, F(T) would be 0+1+2+3+4=10. Which is lower than the all-draws case. So, in this ordered tournament, the sum F(T) is the sum from 0 to n-1, which is n(n-1)/2. For n=5, that&#39;s 10. For general n, it&#39;s n(n-1)/2. But perhaps we can get even lower? Let&#39;s think. If we can have multiple teams where disqualifying one team allows multiple other teams to become champions. Wait, but each f_i(T) is the minimal number for each team. So, if the same disqualification set can be used for multiple teams, but since we are summing the minimal numbers for each team, we have to consider each team&#39;s individual minimal set.Wait, but in the ordered case where each team is just below the next, you have each f_i(T) = i-1 (assuming teams are ordered by rank). So sum is 0+1+2+3+4=10 for n=5. However, if you can arrange the tournament so that for each team, there is a single team above them, but that team is shared among multiple teams. Wait, but in football tournaments, the points are determined by their match results. So, it&#39;s not possible to have a team A above team B and team C, but team B and team C are independent. Because if team A has beaten both B and C, then B and C may have lost to A but could have other results against other teams.Alternatively, suppose we have a tournament where there&#39;s a hierarchy: Team 1 beats everyone, Team 2 beats everyone except Team 1, Team 3 beats everyone except Teams 1 and 2, etc. Then, each team&#39;s score would be 3*(n - their rank). So, Team 1 has 3(n-1), Team 2 has 3(n-2), ..., Team n has 0. But in reality, teams can also have draws, so it&#39;s not necessarily this linear. However, if all matches are decisive (no draws), then the scores would be as such.In such a tournament, to make Team k the champion, you need to disqualify all teams above them, i.e., Teams 1 to k-1. So, f_k(T) = k-1. Then, the sum F(T) would be 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1) = n(n-1)/2. So, same as the previous case. For n=5, it&#39;s 10.But can we have a tournament where F(T) is lower than n(n-1)/2? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we have a tournament where each team has a different number of points, but the difference between each team&#39;s score is more than 3 points. For example, Team 1 has 12, Team 2 has 8, Team 3 has 4, Team 4 has 0. Then, to make Team 2 the champion, you only need to disqualify Team 1, since even if Team 2&#39;s score is 8, and Team 3&#39;s is 4, Team 4&#39;s is 0. So, f_2(T)=1. Similarly, Team 3 would need to disqualify Teams 1 and 2. But if the differences are large enough, maybe each f_i(T) is the number of teams above them. But if the gaps are large enough, perhaps you don&#39;t have to worry about the lower teams overtaking after disqualifications. Wait, but in reality, when you disqualify a team, you also remove the points that other teams earned from them.Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Suppose Team 1 has 12 points, Team 2 has 8, Team 3 has 4, Team 4 has 0. If we disqualify Team 1, then Team 2&#39;s score might decrease because Team 2 might have earned points from Team 1. Suppose Team 2 lost to Team 1, so they got 0 points from that match. Then disqualifying Team 1 doesn&#39;t affect Team 2&#39;s score. But if Team 2 drew with Team 1, they earned 1 point, so disqualifying Team 1 would reduce Team 2&#39;s score by 1. Similarly, Team 3 and Team 4&#39;s scores could be affected if they had matches against Team 1.This complicates things. So, the impact of disqualifying a team depends on the results of the matches involving that team. Therefore, the structure of the tournament (who beat whom) affects how disqualifications influence the remaining teams&#39; scores.Therefore, perhaps the minimal sum F(T) occurs when the tournament is structured such that each team&#39;s score is only slightly higher than the next, and each team&#39;s score can be made the highest by disqualifying the minimal number of teams above them. Then, the sum would be n(n-1)/2.But maybe we can do better. For example, suppose the tournament is structured in such a way that disqualifying one team allows multiple teams to become champions. Wait, but since we need the minimal number for each team individually, maybe some teams can share the same set of disqualifications. However, since each f_i(T) is specific to team i, the minimal disqualifications for team i may overlap with those for team j.Alternatively, if we have a tournament where all teams except one have very low scores, but the top team has a high score. Then, for the top team, f_i(T)=0, and for the others, they need to disqualify the top team. However, once the top team is disqualified, maybe some other teams now have the next highest scores, so to make a lower team champion, you might need to disqualify more teams. For example, suppose Team 1 has a very high score, and Teams 2-5 have low scores. Then, to make Team 2 champion, you need to disqualify Team 1. To make Team 3 champion, you need to disqualify Team 1 and Team 2, etc. So, in this case, F(T) would be 0 +1 +2 +3 +4=10 for n=5. Which is the same as the previous cases.Alternatively, if the tournament is structured such that each team can be made champion by disqualifying just one other team. For example, if there&#39;s a cycle: Team 1 beats Team 2, Team 2 beats Team 3, ..., Team n beats Team 1, and all other matches are draws. Then, each team&#39;s score is 3 (from the one win) + 1*(n-2) (from the draws). So, total score is 3 + n - 2 = n + 1. All teams have the same score, so you need to disqualify all other teams to make any single team champion. Therefore, F(T) = 4n, which for n=5 is 20.But in this case, F(T) is higher. So, the sum F(T) can vary depending on the tournament structure.Wait, so maybe the minimal F(T) is n(n-1)/2 and the maximal is n(n-1). Let&#39;s check for n=5. Minimal would be 10, maximal would be 20. But wait, in the all-draw tournament, all teams have the same score, so f_i(T)=4 for each team, so F(T)=4*5=20. So, that&#39;s the maximum. But is there a tournament where F(T) is higher than 4n? For example, if in some tournaments, you have to disqualify more teams for some teams to become champions?Wait, no. Because in any tournament, the maximum number of teams you might need to disqualify to make team i champion is n-1 (all other teams). Therefore, for each team, f_i(T) ≤ n-1. But in reality, in the all-draw tournament, each f_i(T) =n-1. So, F(T) =n(n-1). But for n=5, that would be 5*4=20. However, in the ordered tournament, where teams are ranked and you just need to disqualify higher-ranked teams, F(T) =n(n-1)/2. So, perhaps the minimal value is n(n-1)/2 and the maximal is n(n-1).But let&#39;s verify for n=2. If n=2, each team plays once. If they draw, both have 1 point. Then, to make each champion, you need to disqualify the other. So, F(T)=1+1=2. Which is 2*1=2, the maximal. If one team wins, then F(T)=0+1=1, which is minimal. So, for n=2, the minimal F(T) is 1, maximal is 2.But according to our previous formula, n(n-1)/2 for n=2 would be 1, which matches the minimal. The maximal is n(n-1)=2, which also matches. So, perhaps this pattern holds. For n=3, the minimal F(T) would be 3, maximal 6.Wait, for n=3, let&#39;s see. If all teams draw each other, they each have 2 points. To make any team champion, disqualify the other two. So, F(T)=2+2+2=6. If it&#39;s a cyclic hierarchy: A beats B, B beats C, C beats A, and each loses to the other, then each has 3 points. So, same as all draws. If instead, one team wins both matches, say A beats B and C, B beats C. Then, A has 6 points, B has 3, C has 0. Then, f_A=0, f_B=1 (disqualify A), f_C=2 (disqualify A and B). So F(T)=0+1+2=3, which is n(n-1)/2=3. So, yes, in this case, minimal is 3, maximal is 6. So the formula seems to hold.Therefore, likely, for general n ≥2, the minimal F(T) is n(n-1)/2 and the maximal is n(n-1). Therefore, for n ≥5, the answer would be minimum F(T) = n(n-1)/2 and maximum F(T) =n(n-1).But let&#39;s check for n=4. If we have a hierarchy A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D, with each higher team beating the lower ones, and losing to none. Then, A has 9 points, B has 6, C has 3, D has 0. Then f_A=0, f_B=1 (disqualify A), f_C=2 (disqualify A,B), f_D=3 (disqualify A,B,C). So F(T)=0+1+2+3=6=4*3/2=6. If it&#39;s all draws, each team has 3 points, so F(T)=3*4=12=4*3=12. So again, minimal is 6, maximal is 12. So, the pattern holds.Therefore, it seems the minimal value of F(T) is n(n-1)/2, achieved when the tournament is a total order (each team can be ordered such that each team only needs to disqualify the ones above it), and the maximum value is n(n-1), achieved when all teams have equal points (so each team requires disqualifying all others).But the problem statement mentions n ≥5. So, the answer should be the maximum F(T) is n(n-1), and the minimum is n(n-1)/2.But let me think again. Is there a tournament structure where F(T) could be lower than n(n-1)/2? For example, if some teams can become champions without disqualifying all higher teams because disqualifying certain teams lowers the scores of multiple higher teams.Suppose in a tournament, team A has a high score because it beat teams B, C, D, E. Teams B, C, D, E all lost to A but drew with each other. So, team A has 12 points (4 wins *3), and teams B, C, D, E each have 3 points (from draws). Now, to make team B champion, you could disqualify team A. Then, team B&#39;s score would be 3 points (since their match against A is canceled). But teams C, D, E also have 3 points each. So, after disqualifying A, there are multiple teams with 3 points. Therefore, team B isn&#39;t the sole champion. So, to make team B champion, you need to disqualify A and all other teams except B. So, f_B(T)=4. Similarly for C, D, E. So, F(T)=0 +4+4+4+4=16. Which is higher than n(n-1)/2=10.But if we structure the tournament so that disqualifying one team lowers the points of multiple others, maybe we can have fewer disqualifications.Wait, let&#39;s try. Suppose Team A beats Teams B, C, D, E. Each of Teams B, C, D, E beat Team A in return? No, that&#39;s impossible because each pair plays only once. Wait, no, each pair plays once. So, if Team A beats B, C, D, E, then those teams lost to A. Suppose Teams B, C, D, E each drew with each other. Then, Team A has 12 points, Teams B, C, D, E have 3 + 3*1=6 points each (wait, no). Wait, each of B, C, D, E plays 4 matches: one against A (which they lost, 0 points) and three against the other three teams. If they drew all three, they get 1 point each, so 3 points. So, each of B, C, D, E has 0 + 3*1=3 points. So, Team A has 12, others have 3. Then, to make Team B champion, you need to disqualify Team A, which brings Team B&#39;s score to 3, but Teams C, D, E also have 3. So, you need to disqualify Teams C, D, E as well. So, f_B(T)=4. Similarly for others. So F(T)=0 +4+4+4+4=16, which is higher than n(n-1)/2=10. So, in this case, the sum is higher.But if we arrange a tournament where each team has a high score but depends on a unique set of other teams, so that disqualifying one team only affects one other team&#39;s score. For example, a cyclic dependency where Team 1&#39;s high score is due to beating Team 2, Team 2&#39;s high score is due to beating Team 3, etc. Then, to make Team i champion, you need to disqualify the team above them. But maybe this is similar to the hierarchy case.Wait, let&#39;s model a tournament where Team 1 beats Team 2, Team 2 beats Team 3, ..., Team n beats Team 1, and all other matches are draws. Then, each team has 3 points from their win and 1 point from each draw. There are n-2 draws per team. So, each team&#39;s total is 3 + (n - 2)*1 = n + 1 points. All teams have the same score. Therefore, to make any team champion, you have to disqualify all other teams. So, f_i(T)=n-1 for each i, and F(T)=n(n-1). So, this is the maximum.Alternatively, if we have a tournament where each team&#39;s score is uniquely determined and in a hierarchy, such that each team&#39;s score is just 1 point more than the next. Then, to make the lowest team champion, you need to disqualify all higher teams. But if the score differences are just 1 point, then maybe disqualifying a higher team might not be sufficient because the next higher team might still have a higher score. Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, consider a tournament where teams are arranged in a hierarchy, and each team&#39;s score is 3*(n - k) where k is their rank. Then, Team 1 has 3(n-1), Team 2 has 3(n-2), ..., Team n has 0. In this case, to make Team k champion, you need to disqualify Teams 1 to k-1. So, f_k(T)=k-1. Therefore, F(T)=0 +1 +2 +...+(n-1)=n(n-1)/2, which is the minimal sum.Therefore, it seems that depending on the tournament structure, the sum F(T) can vary between n(n-1)/2 and n(n-1). To confirm, let&#39;s consider that in the maximal case, all teams have the same score, so each f_i(T)=n-1, leading to F(T)=n(n-1). In the minimal case, the tournament is ordered such that each team only needs to disqualify the teams above them, leading to F(T)=n(n-1)/2.Therefore, for n ≥5, the maximum value of F(T) is n(n-1), and the minimum value is n(n-1)/2.Final AnswerThe maximum value of ( F(T) ) is (boxed{n(n-1)}) and the minimum value is (boxed{frac{n(n-1)}{2}}).&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum and minimum values of ( F(T) ), which is the sum of the minimum number of teams that must be disqualified to ensure each team becomes the champion.  Key Steps and Reasoning:1. Understanding ( f_i(T) ):   - ( f_i(T) ) is the minimum number of teams that must be disqualified to make team ( i ) the champion.   - Disqualifying a team affects the points of other teams by removing their match results against the disqualified team.2. Maximizing ( F(T) ):   - The maximum value occurs when all teams have the same score (e.g., all matches are draws). In this case, each team must disqualify all other teams to become champion.   - For each team ( i ), ( f_i(T) = n - 1 ), leading to ( F(T) = n(n - 1) ).3. Minimizing ( F(T) ):   - The minimum value occurs when the tournament is structured such that teams can be ordered hierarchically. Each team only needs to disqualify the teams above it to become champion.   - For a hierarchy where each team ( i ) needs to disqualify ( i - 1 ) teams, the sum ( F(T) ) is the sum of the first ( n - 1 ) integers, which is ( frac{n(n - 1)}{2} ). Conclusion:- Maximum ( F(T) ): This is achieved when all teams have equal scores, requiring each team to disqualify all others. The result is ( boxed{n(n-1)} ).- Minimum ( F(T) ): This is achieved with a hierarchical tournament structure, leading to the sum ( boxed{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} ).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem about football leagues and disqualifications. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.First, the setup: There are n football teams, each plays every other team exactly once. Wins give 3 points, draws 1, losses 0. After the league ends, some teams might be disqualified, which cancels all their match results. The remaining teams have their scores recalculated, and the highest scorer becomes champion. If only one team is left, they&#39;re automatically champion.Now, the function f_i(T) is defined as the minimum number of teams that need to be disqualified so that team i becomes champion. Then F(T) is the sum of all f_i(T) for each team. The question asks for the maximum and minimum possible values of F(T) when n is at least 5.Hmm. So I need to consider different possible tournaments T and figure out, for each, the sum of the minimal disqualifications needed for each team to be champion. Then find the maximum and minimum possible F(T) across all possible tournaments with n ≥5.Let me start by understanding f_i(T). For each team i, we need the smallest number of teams to disqualify so that when recalculating the points, team i has more points than any other remaining team. If we can make team i the champion by disqualifying k teams, then f_i(T) = k. The sum F(T) is adding all these k&#39;s for each team.To find the maximum and minimum of F(T), I need to construct tournaments where F(T) is as large as possible and as small as possible.Let me think about the minimal F(T) first. What would make the sum of f_i(T) as small as possible? Probably if each team can become champion by disqualifying as few teams as possible. So maybe if the tournament is structured such that each team is already strong, and only a few teams need to be removed for each to be on top.Alternatively, maybe if the tournament is very balanced, so that each team can become champion by just removing the top competitor, which might lead to low f_i(T) for each team.On the other hand, the maximum F(T) would occur when each team requires as many disqualifications as possible to become champion. That might be a tournament where each team is very weak compared to others, so you have to disqualify a lot of teams for them to be champion. But since each team has to have some score, maybe if the tournament is structured so that each team is only barely ahead of the next, requiring many disqualifications to make any team the champion.Wait, but how exactly does disqualification affect the scores? If you disqualify a team, all their matches are canceled. So for the remaining teams, their points are recalculated by removing all matches against disqualified teams. So if a team had beaten a disqualified team, they lose the 3 points from that match. Similarly, if they drew, they lose 1 point. So disqualifying a team can reduce the points of other teams.Therefore, to make team i the champion, you might need to disqualify teams that have higher points than i, but also teams that, when removed, increase i&#39;s relative standing. Alternatively, you could remove teams that have a lot of points from beating other teams, so that their removal reduces the points of other competitors.This is a bit complex. Let me try to think of small cases first, maybe n=5, and see if I can find patterns.Suppose n=5. Let&#39;s think about the minimal F(T). If in the tournament, each team has the same number of points, then for any team to be champion, you would need to disqualify all other teams except that one. So for each team i, f_i(T) would be 4, so F(T) would be 5*4=20. But this is probably not the minimal. Wait, if all teams have the same points, then you can&#39;t have any team be champion without disqualifying all others. But maybe if there&#39;s a hierarchy where each team can be made champion by just removing the team above them.Wait, for example, if the tournament is a cycle: A beats B, B beats C, C beats D, D beats E, E beats A, and all other matches are draws. Then each team has some points. But maybe by removing one team, you can break the cycle. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, if teams are ordered in a strict hierarchy, so that team 1 beats everyone, team 2 beats everyone except team 1, team 3 beats everyone except teams 1 and 2, etc. Then for team i to become champion, you need to disqualify teams 1 to i-1. So f_i(T) would be i-1. Then the sum F(T) would be sum_{i=1}^n (i-1) = n(n-1)/2. For n=5, that would be 10. But maybe this is the minimal F(T)? Because each team requires disqualifying only the teams above them. If the tournament is structured in a total order, maybe that&#39;s the minimal.Alternatively, if the tournament is such that each team can become champion without disqualifying any teams, which would mean that each team is already the champion. But that&#39;s impossible unless all teams have the same points, but then there&#39;s no champion until someone is disqualified. Wait, if all teams have the same points, then if you don&#39;t disqualify anyone, there&#39;s no champion. So in that case, you have to disqualify all but one to have a champion. So F(T) would be n*(n-1). For n=5, that&#39;s 20, which is higher than the previous case.So maybe the minimal F(T) occurs when the tournament is a strict hierarchy, where each team can be champion by just disqualifying the teams above it. So f_i(T) = i - 1. Hence the sum is n(n -1)/2. For n=5, that&#39;s 10, which is less than 20. So that might be the minimal.But wait, is that possible? Let&#39;s check with n=2. If there are 2 teams, A and B. If A beats B, then for A to be champion, f_A(T) = 0 (already champion). For B to be champion, f_B(T) = 1 (disqualify A). So F(T) = 0 + 1 = 1. Which is 2(2 -1)/2 = 1, so yes. For n=3. Suppose team 1 beats 2 and 3, team 2 beats 3, team 3 loses to everyone. Then for team 1, f_1 = 0. For team 2, they need to disqualify team 1, so f_2 =1. For team 3, they need to disqualify teams 1 and 2, so f_3=2. Sum is 0 +1 +2=3, which is 3(3 -1)/2=3. So that works. So seems like in this strict hierarchy, the sum is n(n -1)/2.Thus, perhaps the minimal F(T) is n(n -1)/2. So for each team i, f_i(T) is the number of teams above it in the hierarchy, which is i -1. Summing over all i gives the triangular number.But wait, but in a football tournament, it&#39;s possible for teams to have different point totals even if they are in a hierarchy. For instance, in a strict hierarchy where each higher team beats all lower teams, and there are no draws. Then the points would be:Team 1: 3*(n -1) points (beats all others)Team 2: 3*(n -2) points (beats all except team 1)...Team n: 0 points (loses all matches)In this case, the points are strictly decreasing. So to make team i champion, you need to disqualify all teams 1 to i -1. So f_i(T) = i -1. Then F(T) = sum_{i=1}^n (i -1) = n(n -1)/2. So this is a valid tournament structure where F(T) is n(n -1)/2. So that&#39;s a candidate for minimal F(T).Now, for the maximum F(T). To maximize the sum, we need each f_i(T) to be as large as possible. What&#39;s the maximum possible f_i(T) for a team?The maximum number of teams you can disqualify is n -1 (leaving only team i). But f_i(T) is the minimum number of disqualifications needed. So the worst case is that to make team i champion, you have to disqualify all other teams. But is that possible?Suppose all teams have very high points except team i. Then even if you disqualify some teams, the remaining teams might still have higher points than team i. So to make team i champion, you might have to disqualify all teams that have higher points. But if team i is the worst team, then all other teams have higher points. So f_i(T) would be n -1.But if that&#39;s the case for all teams, then F(T) would be n*(n -1). But is this possible? That would require that in the tournament, every team is the worst team, which is impossible. Because in reality, each team has some results against others. So it&#39;s not possible for all teams to have all other teams have higher points than them. At least one team must be the champion without any disqualifications.Wait, actually, in any tournament, there must be at least one team that has the maximum points. So for that team, f_i(T) is 0, since it&#39;s already the champion. Hence, F(T) can&#39;t be n*(n -1), since at least one term in the sum is 0.Therefore, the maximum F(T) must be less than n(n -1). But how much less?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a tournament where most teams require disqualifying almost all other teams. For example, suppose there&#39;s a tournament where one team is extremely strong, and all other teams are very weak, but among the weak teams, they have draws with each other. Then the strong team has high points, and the weak teams have low points. To make a weak team champion, you have to disqualify the strong team and possibly other weak teams that might still have higher points.Wait, let&#39;s try to construct such a tournament.Let team 1 be the strong team that beats all other teams. Then teams 2 to n all draw with each other. So team 1 has 3*(n -1) points. Each of the other teams has 0 points from losing to team 1, and (n -2) draws, so 1*(n -2) points. So each of teams 2 to n has (n -2) points.In this case, team 1 is the champion. For teams 2 to n to become champion, you need to disqualify team 1, but even after that, all teams 2 to n have (n -2) points each. So if you just disqualify team 1, there&#39;s a tie among all the remaining teams. But the problem states that the champion is the team with the most points. If there&#39;s a tie, I guess multiple teams would be champions? But the problem says &quot;the team with the most points will become the champion&quot;. So if multiple teams have the same highest score, do they all become champions? The problem statement isn&#39;t entirely clear. Wait, reading again: &quot;the team with the most points will become the champion&quot;. So if there are multiple teams with the same highest points, then there is no unique champion? But the problem says &quot;the team with the most points&quot;, implying singular. Hmm. Maybe in case of a tie, there is no champion, so you have to disqualify teams until there&#39;s a unique champion.But the problem says &quot;the team with the most points will become the champion (if only one team is not disqualified, then that team is the champion)&quot;. So if multiple teams are tied, but all others are disqualified, then the remaining teams are considered. If only one remains, it&#39;s champion. If multiple remain, but they have the same points, does that count? The problem says &quot;the team with the most points&quot;, so if multiple teams have the same highest points, perhaps none are champion. So to ensure that team i is the champion, we need that after disqualifications, team i has strictly more points than any other remaining team.Therefore, in the example where teams 2 to n all have (n -2) points after disqualifying team 1, you would need to disqualify all other teams except one. So for each team i (from 2 to n), to make them champion, you need to disqualify team 1 and all other teams except i. Therefore, f_i(T) = 1 (team 1) + (n -2) (other teams) = n -1. But wait, if you disqualify team 1 and all teams except i, then you&#39;re disqualifying n -1 teams. But if you just disqualify all teams except i, that would also work, right? Because if you disqualify all except i, then i is the only team left, hence champion. But the minimal number of disqualifications is n -1 (disqualify all others). But in this case, if you only need to disqualify team 1 and the other teams that have the same points as i, but since they all have same points, you have to disqualify all of them to leave only i. So f_i(T) would be (n -1). So for each of the teams 2 to n, f_i(T) = n -1. For team 1, f_1(T) = 0. So F(T) = 0 + (n -1)*(n -1) = (n -1)^2. For n=5, that would be 16. But is this the maximum?Wait, but in this case, each of the teams 2 to n would require disqualifying n -1 teams. But maybe there&#39;s a smarter way. If you only need to disqualify enough teams so that team i has more points than the remaining. Suppose after disqualifying team 1, teams 2 to n have (n -2) points each. If you disqualify all teams except i and one other team, say j. Then team i and j both have (n -2) - (number of matches against disqualified teams). Wait, no, when you disqualify a team, all matches involving them are canceled. So if you disqualify teams 1 and all except i and j, then teams i and j have their points recalculated by removing matches against teams 1, and the other disqualified teams.Wait, originally, teams i and j drew with each other and drew with all other teams except team 1. If we disqualify team 1 and all teams except i and j, then their recalculated points would be from the match between i and j, which was a draw. So each would have 1 point. So team i and j each have 1 point. So to make team i champion, you need to disqualify team j as well. Hence, f_i(T) is indeed n -1.Therefore, in this tournament structure, F(T) = (n -1)^2. For n=5, that&#39;s 16. But earlier, when all teams are equal, F(T) would be n(n -1) = 20 for n=5. Wait, but in that case, all teams have the same points, so for each team to be champion, you need to disqualify all others. Hence, f_i(T) = n -1 for each i. Hence, F(T) = n(n -1). But in the previous example with one strong team and the rest drawing, F(T) is (n -1)^2. So which is larger? For n ≥2, n(n -1) is larger than (n -1)^2. So actually, if all teams are tied, F(T) is n(n -1), which is larger. So that would be a higher F(T).But wait, in the all-draw tournament, every match is a draw. So each team plays n -1 matches, each a draw, so each team has (n -1) points. Therefore, all teams have equal points. Hence, to make any team champion, you need to disqualify all other n -1 teams. Hence, f_i(T) = n -1 for each i. Therefore, F(T) = n(n -1). For n=5, that&#39;s 5*4=20.But in the previous example, with one strong team and the rest drawing, F(T) is (n -1)^2 + 0 = 16 for n=5. So 20 is larger. Therefore, the all-draw tournament would give a higher F(T). So maybe the maximum F(T) is n(n -1), achieved when all teams have the same points. Because in that case, each team requires disqualifying all others to be champion.But wait, in the all-draw tournament, when all teams have the same points, then if you disqualify k teams, the remaining n -k teams still have the same points (since each has n -1 -k points from the remaining matches). So unless you disqualify all but one, there&#39;s no champion. Therefore, for each team, f_i(T) = n -1. Hence, F(T) = n(n -1). That seems to be the maximum possible.But is there a tournament where F(T) is even higher? For example, if each team requires disqualifying more than n -1 teams? But you can&#39;t disqualify more than n -1 teams, since that would leave only one team. So the maximum f_i(T) is n -1 for each team. Therefore, the maximum possible F(T) is n(n -1), achieved when every team requires all others to be disqualified. Which only happens if all teams have the same score. Because in any other tournament, there exists at least one team that is already the champion without disqualifications, so f_i(T) =0 for that team, reducing the total sum.Therefore, the maximum F(T) is n(n -1), and the minimum is n(n -1)/2. Wait, but let me verify.Wait, in the strict hierarchy tournament, F(T) is n(n -1)/2. For example, with n=5, it&#39;s 10. In the all-draw tournament, F(T) is 20, which is n(n -1). So for n=5, 20 is maximum, 10 is minimum. For general n, maximum is n(n -1), minimum is n(n -1)/2.But wait, is there a tournament where F(T) is lower than n(n -1)/2? For example, if some teams can become champion without disqualifying any teams, but others need to disqualify some. However, in the strict hierarchy, the top team needs 0 disqualifications, the next needs 1, etc. So the sum is triangular. But if you have a different structure where some teams can become champion with fewer disqualifications, maybe the total sum can be lower?Wait, suppose we have a tournament where each team can be champion by disqualifying just one team. For example, in a tournament where each team has a unique team that they need to disqualify to become champion. Then the sum would be n*1 = n. But is such a tournament possible?Let me think. Suppose n=3. If teams A, B, C. Suppose A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. All other matches are draws. Then each team has 3 points from a win and 1 point from a draw, total 4 points. So all teams have 4 points. Then to make any team champion, you have to disqualify the other two. So F(T)= 2+2+2=6. Which is higher than the strict hierarchy case of 3. So cycles might not help. Alternatively, if you have a tournament where each team&#39;s only loss is to one other team, forming a cycle. But in that case, their points would vary depending on other results.Alternatively, suppose in a tournament, each team has one team they can&#39;t beat, but can beat all others. Then, in a cyclic manner. For example, in n=4, A beats B, C, D; B beats C, D, A; C beats D, A, B; D beats A, B, C. Wait, that&#39;s impossible, because if A beats B, C, D, then B can&#39;t beat A. Wait, maybe a different structure. Let me think of a tournament where each team has one loss and the rest wins. For example, in n=4, A beats B, C, D; B beats C, D, A; but this is impossible because if A beats B, then B can&#39;t beat A. So maybe a cyclic pattern where each team beats one team and loses to another. For example, A beats B, B beats C, C beats D, D beats A. Then, in the remaining matches, perhaps all are draws. So each team has 3 points for the win, and 1 point for each draw. For n=4, each team plays 3 matches. So, for team A: beats B, draws with C and D: total 3 +1 +1=5. Similarly, team B: beats C, draws with A and D: 3 +1 +1=5. Similarly, all teams have 5 points. So again, all teams have equal points, leading to F(T)=4*3=12. Which is higher than the strict hierarchy case of 4*3/2=6. So cycles might not help in reducing F(T). Therefore, maybe the strict hierarchy is indeed the minimal. Because in that case, each team only needs to disqualify the teams above it, and the sum is the triangular number. Whereas in other tournaments, you might have higher sums.Alternatively, is there a tournament where F(T) is less than n(n -1)/2? For example, if some teams can become champion without disqualifying anyone, and others need to disqualify only a few. Wait, but in any tournament, there can be only one team with f_i(T) =0, since only one team can be the initial champion. So the minimal possible sum would be 0 +1 +2 +...+(n -1) = n(n -1)/2. Which is exactly the case in the strict hierarchy. Therefore, this is indeed the minimal.Hence, compiling this:- The minimal F(T) is n(n -1)/2, achieved by a strict hierarchy tournament where each team can be champion by disqualifying all higher-ranked teams.- The maximal F(T) is n(n -1), achieved by a tournament where all teams have equal points (all matches drawn), requiring each team to disqualify all others to become champion.Therefore, for n ≥5, the minimum value of F(T) is n(n -1)/2, and the maximum value is n(n -1).But wait, let me check if there are other tournaments where F(T) could be higher than n(n -1). For example, if in some tournaments, teams require more disqualifications than n -1. But as I thought earlier, the maximum number of teams you can disqualify is n -1 (leaving only the desired team). So f_i(T) can&#39;t exceed n -1. Hence, the maximum possible sum is n(n -1). Which is achieved in the all-draw tournament. So that must be the maximum.Therefore, the answer should be:Maximum F(T) = n(n -1)Minimum F(T) = n(n -1)/2So boxed answers:Minimum: boxed{dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}}Maximum: boxed{n(n-1)}Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( F(T) ) is boxed{dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}} and the maximum value is boxed{n(n-1)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a league with ( n ) football teams where each team plays every other team exactly once, we need to determine the maximum and minimum values of ( F(T) ), which is the sum of the minimum number of teams that must be disqualified to ensure each team becomes the champion. Key Steps and Reasoning:1. Understanding ( f_i(T) ):   - ( f_i(T) ) is the minimum number of teams to disqualify so that team ( i ) becomes the champion.   - The sum ( F(T) ) is the sum of ( f_i(T) ) for all teams ( i ).2. Minimum ( F(T) ):   - In a strict hierarchy tournament where each team beats all lower-ranked teams, each team ( i ) needs to disqualify ( i - 1 ) teams (all higher-ranked teams).   - The sum ( F(T) ) is the triangular number: ( sum_{i=1}^n (i - 1) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ).3. Maximum ( F(T) ):   - In a tournament where all matches are draws, all teams have equal points. To make any team ( i ) the champion, all other ( n - 1 ) teams must be disqualified.   - The sum ( F(T) ) is ( n times (n - 1) = n(n - 1) ). Conclusion:- Minimum Value: Achieved in a strict hierarchy tournament, resulting in ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ).- Maximum Value: Achieved in an all-draw tournament, resulting in ( n(n - 1) ). Final Answer:The minimum value of ( F(T) ) is boxed{dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}} and the maximum value is boxed{n(n-1)}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8520547b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>🔑:</span>Four Because f_{i}(T) leqslant n-1(i=1,2, cdots, n), so F(T) leqslant n(n-1). In addition, in the league T_{0}, all matches are draws, then the i-th team must disqualify the other n-1 teams to win the championship, so f_{i}left(T_{0}right)=n-1. Thus, Fleft(T_{0}right)=n(n-1).Therefore, the maximum value of F(T) is n(n-1).Next, we prove that the minimum value of F(T) is n.For the league T_{1}: the i-th team wins the i+1-th team (i=1,2, cdots, n-1), the n-th team wins the 1st team, and all other matches are draws. Clearly, disqualifying the i-1-th team can make the i-th team the champion (i=2,3, cdots, n), and disqualifying the n-th team can make the 1st team the champion, so f_{i}left(T_{1}right)=1, thus Fleft(T_{1}right)=n.If in the league T no team has more points than the others, then f_{i}(T) geqslant 1(i=1,2, cdots, n), therefore F(T) geqslant n.If in the league T one team has more points than the others, without loss of generality, assume the n-th team has more points than the others, then f_{n}(T)=0, f_{i}(T) geqslant 1(i=1,2, cdots, n-1). So F(T) geqslant n-1.If F(T)=n-1, then f_{i}(T)=1(i=1,2, cdots, n-1), f_{n}(T)=0. Let the i-th team win the championship, and the team disqualified is the a_{i}-th team, then when i neq j, a_{i} neq a_{j}. Thus, the a_{i}-th team must have lost to the n-th team (if a_{i} neq n). So the n-th team must have won at least n-2 matches. Thus, the team gets k_{n} geqslant 3(n-2) points, and the i-th team (i=1,2, cdots, n-1) gets k_{i} geqslant k_{n}-2 points. Therefore, in the league T, the total points of all teams arebegin{aligned}sum_{i=1}^{n} k_{i} &amp; =sum_{i=1}^{n-1} k_{i}+k_{n} &amp; geqslant sum_{i=1}^{n-1}left(k_{n}-2right)+k_{n}=n k_{n}-2(n-1) &amp; geqslant 3(n-2) n-2(n-1)=3 n^{2}-8 n+2 .end{aligned}On the other hand, sum_{i=1}^{n} k_{i} leqslant 3 cdot frac{n(n-1)}{2}, so3 cdot frac{n(n-1)}{2} geqslant 3 n^{2}-8 n+2 .This inequality does not hold when n geqslant 5, a contradiction.Therefore, the minimum value of F(T) is n.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-3f6ea659 data-v-8520547b><div class="review" data-v-8520547b><div class="review-title" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>❓:</span>Given a function f(x)=left{begin{array}{l}{x^{frac{1}{2}}}-2, x&gt;0{e^x}, xleq0end{array}right., then the value of fleft(fleft(4right)right) is ( )A: -2B: 0C: 1D: e</div><div class="divider" data-v-8520547b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The function f(x) is defined piecewise, which means it has different expressions depending on the value of x. So, for x greater than 0, f(x) is the square root of x minus 2, and for x less than or equal to 0, it&#39;s e raised to the power of x. The question is asking for the value of f(f(4)), which means we first need to compute f(4) and then plug that result back into f again. Let me break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s compute the inner function: f(4). Since 4 is the input here, and 4 is definitely greater than 0, we need to use the first part of the piecewise function. That part is x^(1/2) - 2. The square root of 4 is 2, right? So substituting 4 into that expression gives 2 - 2, which equals 0. So, f(4) is 0. Now, we need to find f(f(4)) which is f(0). Because we just found out that f(4) is 0, now we substitute 0 into the function f(x). Here, 0 is the boundary condition for the piecewise function. The function is defined as e^x for x ≤ 0. Since 0 is equal to 0, we use the second part of the function. Therefore, f(0) is e^0. I remember that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so e^0 should be 1. Therefore, f(0) is 1. Putting it all together, f(f(4)) is f(0) which is 1. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. First, f(4): 4 is positive, so square root of 4 is 2, minus 2 is 0. Then f(0): 0 is in the second part, so e^0 is 1. That seems correct. Wait, but let me confirm if the square root of 4 is indeed 2. Yes, because 2 squared is 4. So that part is right. Then subtracting 2 gives 0. Then plugging 0 into the exponential function gives 1. So the answer should be 1. Looking at the options, C is 1. Hmm, but let me check if there&#39;s any trick here. Sometimes piecewise functions can have tricky conditions. Let me verify the function definition again: for x &gt; 0, it&#39;s sqrt(x) - 2; for x ≤ 0, it&#39;s e^x. So 4 is greater than 0, so definitely use sqrt(4) - 2. Then 0 is less than or equal to 0, so use e^0. Yep, that seems right. Another thing to check: when we take the square root in the first part, is there a possibility of negative roots? But since x is greater than 0, the square root is defined as the principal (positive) root, so that&#39;s correct. So no issues there. So, final answer should be 1, which is option C. Let me look back at the options: A is -2, B is 0, C is 1, D is e. So yes, C is the correct choice. I think that&#39;s all. I don&#39;t see any mistakes in my reasoning.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of ( f(f(4)) ) for the given piecewise function ( f(x) ):1. Compute ( f(4) ):   - Since ( 4 &gt; 0 ), we use the first part of the function: ( f(x) = x^{frac{1}{2}} - 2 ).   - Calculate ( x^{frac{1}{2}} ) for ( x = 4 ): ( sqrt{4} = 2 ).   - Subtract 2: ( 2 - 2 = 0 ).   - Therefore, ( f(4) = 0 ).2. Compute ( f(f(4)) = f(0) ):   - Since ( 0 leq 0 ), we use the second part of the function: ( f(x) = e^x ).   - Calculate ( e^x ) for ( x = 0 ): ( e^0 = 1 ).   - Therefore, ( f(0) = 1 ).Thus, the value of ( f(f(4)) ) is (boxed{C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the value of f(f(4)) given the piecewise function f(x). The function f(x) is defined differently depending on whether x is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. The options are A: -2, B: 0, C: 1, D: e. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I should start by finding f(4). Since 4 is greater than 0, I need to use the first part of the piecewise function, which is x^(1/2) - 2. Wait, x^(1/2) is the square root of x, right? So, sqrt(4) - 2. Let me compute that.sqrt(4) is 2, so 2 - 2 equals 0. Therefore, f(4) is 0. Okay, so now I need to find f(f(4)) which is f(0). Alright, next step is to compute f(0). Since 0 is less than or equal to 0, I need to use the second part of the piecewise function, which is e^x. So, e^0. What&#39;s e^0? That&#39;s 1, right? Because any number to the power of 0 is 1. So, f(0) is 1. Therefore, f(f(4)) is 1. Looking at the options, C is 1. So the answer should be C.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Let&#39;s go through it again.First, f(4). Since 4 &gt; 0, use x^(1/2) - 2. sqrt(4) is 2, 2 - 2 is 0. So f(4) = 0. Then f(0). Since 0 &lt;= 0, use e^x. e^0 = 1. So f(0) = 1. Hence, f(f(4)) = 1. The options are A: -2, B: 0, C:1, D:e. So yes, C is the correct answer. Hmm, seems straightforward. Did I miss anything?Wait, let me check if the function is defined correctly. For x &gt; 0, it&#39;s x^(1/2) - 2. So square root minus 2. For x &lt;=0, it&#39;s e^x. So yes, when x is 0, we use the exponential part. So f(0) is e^0 = 1. That&#39;s right. So the answer is C. I think that&#39;s correct.I don&#39;t see any errors in my steps. Maybe check if there&#39;s a trick or something? The problem seems pretty direct. Compute f(4) first, then plug that result into f again. Since 4 is positive, first part, straightforward. Then 0 is non-positive, so second part, straightforward. So yeah, 1 is the answer. So option C. Alright, confident enough.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of ( f(f(4)) ) given the piecewise function ( f(x) ):1. Compute ( f(4) ):   - Since ( 4 &gt; 0 ), we use the first part of the function: ( x^{frac{1}{2}} - 2 ).   - ( sqrt{4} - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0 ).   - Therefore, ( f(4) = 0 ).2. Compute ( f(0) ):   - Since ( 0 leq 0 ), we use the second part of the function: ( e^x ).   - ( e^0 = 1 ).   - Therefore, ( f(0) = 1 ).Thus, the value of ( f(f(4)) ) is ( 1 ).[boxed{C}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8520547b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>🔑:</span>To solve for fleft(fleft(4right)right), we first need to find f(4).

Let me first recall that sec θ is 1/cos θ, so this sum is the same as 1/cos(2π/9) + 1/cos(4π/9) + 1/cos(6π/9) + 1/cos(8π/9). Hmm. Let me see. The angles here are multiples of 2π/9. Let me check each term:First term: sec(2π/9) = 1/cos(2π/9)Second term: sec(4π/9) = 1/cos(4π/9)Third term: sec(6π/9) = sec(2π/3). Wait, 6π/9 simplifies to 2π/3. I know that cos(2π/3) is equal to cos(120°), which is -1/2. So sec(2π/3) is 1/(-1/2) = -2.Fourth term: sec(8π/9) = 1/cos(8π/9). But 8π/9 is equal to π - π/9, so cos(8π/9) = -cos(π/9). Therefore, sec(8π/9) = -1/cos(π/9). Similarly, cos(2π/9) and cos(4π/9) might have some relationships as well.So, let me note that:sec(8π/9) = -sec(π/9)Similarly, sec(2π/9) = sec(2π/9), and sec(4π/9) = sec(4π/9). Also, the third term is sec(2π/3) = -2.So, perhaps the sum can be rewritten as:sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) - 2 - sec(π/9)But wait, that would be combining the terms. Let me check:Original sum: sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(6π/9) + sec(8π/9)= sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(2π/3) + sec(8π/9)= [sec(2π/9) + sec(8π/9)] + [sec(4π/9) + sec(2π/3)]But sec(8π/9) = -sec(π/9) as I mentioned, because cos(8π/9) = -cos(π/9), so sec(8π/9) = -1/cos(π/9) = -sec(π/9). Similarly, maybe there&#39;s symmetry here.Alternatively, since 8π/9 = π - π/9, and 2π/9 is in the first quadrant, so their secants are related. Similarly, 4π/9 is in the first quadrant, and 8π/9 is π - π/9, but 8π/9 is actually 8π/9, not π - 4π/9. Wait, π - 4π/9 is 5π/9. So maybe that&#39;s a different angle.Wait, maybe grouping terms differently. Let&#39;s see:Let me list all angles:2π/9, 4π/9, 6π/9, 8π/9.Note that 6π/9 is 2π/3, which we already know. 8π/9 is π - π/9, 4π/9 is just 4π/9, 2π/9 is 2π/9.Alternatively, perhaps notice that 2π/9, 4π/9, 6π/9, 8π/9 are angles that are multiples of 2π/9 from 1 to 4 times. But 6π/9 is 2π/3, which is a more familiar angle.Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity. Since sec θ is related to cosine, and the sum of secants might relate to some trigonometric identities or roots of equations.Let me think. The problem is asking for the sum of secants at these specific angles. Maybe there&#39;s a clever way to express this sum using known identities.Alternatively, consider that these angles might be related to the roots of a certain polynomial equation. For example, the ninth roots of unity. The solutions to z^9 = 1 are e^(2πik/9) for k = 0,1,...,8. But how does that relate to the cosines of these angles?Wait, cos(2πk/9) are the real parts of these roots. So maybe if we can relate the sum of secants to some expression involving these roots. But I&#39;m not sure yet. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for sum of secants when angles are in arithmetic progression, but I don&#39;t recall such an identity off the top of my head.Alternatively, consider that the angles 2π/9, 4π/9, 6π/9, 8π/9 can be paired as follows:2π/9 and 8π/9 (since they add up to 10π/9, but not sure if that helps)Alternatively, since cos(8π/9) = -cos(π/9), and cos(2π/9) is just cos(2π/9). Similarly, cos(4π/9) = cos(4π/9), and cos(6π/9) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2.So, writing all terms in terms of cos(π/9), cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9):The given sum is:1/cos(2π/9) + 1/cos(4π/9) + (-2) + (-1/cos(π/9))Therefore, the sum becomes:[1/cos(2π/9) + 1/cos(4π/9) - 1/cos(π/9)] - 2So, if I can compute the sum S = 1/cos(π/9) + 1/cos(2π/9) + 1/cos(4π/9), but actually in our case it&#39;s 1/cos(2π/9) + 1/cos(4π/9) -1/cos(π/9) -2.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a known value for the sum of 1/cos(π/9) + 1/cos(2π/9) + 1/cos(4π/9). Let me check my memory or think of a way to compute that.Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates the sum of secants in a trigonometric equation. Let me consider that.Let me recall that in some problems, sums of secants can be related to roots of certain equations. For example, if we can find an equation whose roots are cos(π/9), cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), then perhaps using Vieta&#39;s formula.Wait, cos(π/9), cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9) are related to the roots of the equation 8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0. Let me verify.Because, for a regular nonagon (9-sided polygon), the cosines of the angles π/9, 2π/9, 4π/9 are roots of certain Chebyshev polynomials or equations derived from multiple-angle identities.Let me recall that cos(3θ) = 4cos^3θ - 3cosθ. So, if we let θ = π/9, then 3θ = π/3, so cos(π/3) = 1/2 = 4cos^3(π/9) - 3cos(π/9). Similarly, this gives the equation 4x^3 - 3x = 1/2, where x = cos(π/9). Multiplying both sides by 2: 8x^3 - 6x -1 = 0. So, cos(π/9) is a root of 8x^3 -6x -1 =0.Similarly, if we take θ = 2π/9, then 3θ = 6π/9 = 2π/3, and cos(2π/3) = -1/2. So, 4cos^3(2π/9) -3cos(2π/9) = -1/2, which leads to 8x^3 -6x +1=0, where x=cos(2π/9). Similarly, for θ=4π/9, 3θ=12π/9=4π/3, and cos(4π/3)= -1/2. Thus, 4cos^3(4π/9)-3cos(4π/9)= -1/2, leading to 8x^3 -6x +1=0, same equation as for θ=2π/9. Therefore, the roots of the equation 8x^3 -6x +1=0 are cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), and cos(8π/9). Wait, cos(8π/9) is equal to -cos(π/9), but π/9 is a different angle. Wait, but 8π/9 is θ=8π/9, so 3θ=24π/9=8π/3, which is equivalent to 8π/3 - 2π = 2π/3, so cos(8π/3)=cos(2π/3)= -1/2. So, similar equation: 4cos^3θ -3cosθ= -1/2. Therefore, cos(8π/9) is also a root of 8x^3 -6x +1=0. But cos(8π/9)= -cos(π/9). Therefore, substituting x = -cos(π/9) into the equation 8x^3 -6x +1=0:8(-cos(π/9))^3 -6(-cos(π/9)) +1 = -8cos^3(π/9) +6cos(π/9) +1.But cos(π/9) is a root of 8x^3 -6x -1=0, so 8cos^3(π/9) -6cos(π/9) -1=0 → 8cos^3(π/9) =6cos(π/9) +1. Therefore, substituting back:-8cos^3(π/9) +6cos(π/9) +1 = -(6cos(π/9) +1) +6cos(π/9) +1= -6cos(π/9) -1 +6cos(π/9) +1=0. So yes, x=-cos(π/9) is a root of 8x^3 -6x +1=0. Therefore, the roots of 8x^3 -6x +1=0 are cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), and -cos(π/9). Therefore, the three roots are cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), cos(8π/9). Wait, but 8π/9 is π - π/9, so cos(8π/9) = -cos(π/9). Therefore, yes, the roots are cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), -cos(π/9). Therefore, the equation 8x^3 -6x +1=0 has roots cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), -cos(π/9). Therefore, if I let the three roots be r1, r2, r3 = cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), -cos(π/9). Then, by Vieta&#39;s formula:r1 + r2 + r3 = 0 (since the coefficient of x^2 is 0 in the equation 8x^3 -6x +1=0)r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = -6/8 = -3/4r1r2r3 = -1/8Hmm, so perhaps I can use these relationships to find the sum of reciprocals.Wait, the sum we need is sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9) + sec(6π/9). But sec(6π/9) is sec(2π/3)= -2 as established. So, the sum is [sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9)] -2.But sec(8π/9) = -sec(π/9). So, the sum becomes [sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) - sec(π/9)] -2.Alternatively, since the roots of 8x^3 -6x +1=0 are r1=cos(2π/9), r2=cos(4π/9), r3=-cos(π/9). Then, the reciprocals 1/r1, 1/r2, 1/r3 would be the secants except for r3 which is negative. So, 1/r1 = sec(2π/9), 1/r2 = sec(4π/9), 1/r3 = -sec(π/9). Therefore, the sum 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3 = sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) - sec(π/9). Which is exactly the bracketed part in our previous expression. So, if we can compute this sum, then subtract 2 to get the final answer.So, we need to compute S = 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3 where r1, r2, r3 are roots of 8x^3 -6x +1=0. To find S = (1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3).Recall that for a cubic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d =0 with roots r1, r2, r3, the sum 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3 is equal to -c/d, but wait, let&#39;s check.Vieta&#39;s formula tells us:r1 + r2 + r3 = -b/ar1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = c/ar1r2r3 = -d/aTherefore, sum of reciprocals:1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3 = (r2r3 + r1r3 + r1r2)/(r1r2r3) = (c/a)/(-d/a) = -c/d.But in our case, the cubic equation is 8x^3 -6x +1=0, so a=8, b=0, c=-6, d=1.Therefore, sum of reciprocals S = -c/d = -(-6)/1 =6. Wait, so 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3 =6.But wait, in our case, r1=cos(2π/9), r2=cos(4π/9), r3=-cos(π/9). Therefore, 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3= sec(2π/9)+sec(4π/9)-sec(π/9)=6.Therefore, our previous sum S = [sec(2π/9)+sec(4π/9)-sec(π/9)] -2 =6 -2=4.Wait, so the total sum is 6 -2=4? But let me verify that carefully.Wait, the cubic equation is 8x^3 -6x +1=0. Then, the sum 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3 is indeed (r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3)/(r1r2r3). From Vieta:r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = c/a = (-6)/8 = -3/4r1r2r3 = -d/a = -1/8Therefore, sum of reciprocals is (-3/4)/(-1/8)= (-3/4)*(-8/1)=6. Yes, so 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3=6.But in our case, the sum [sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9)] is equal to 1/r1 +1/r2 +1/r3=6. But wait, sec(8π/9)=1/cos(8π/9)=1/(-cos(π/9))= -sec(π/9). So, 1/r3=1/(-cos(π/9))=-sec(π/9). Therefore, the sum [sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9)] = sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) - sec(π/9)=6.Therefore, the original problem&#39;s sum is this 6 plus sec(6π/9). But wait, the original sum is sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(6π/9) + sec(8π/9)= [sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9)] + sec(6π/9)=6 + (-2)=4.Because sec(6π/9)=sec(2π/3)= -2. Therefore, total sum is 6 -2=4.Therefore, the answer is 4. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I made any mistakes here.First, we considered the cubic equation with roots cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), -cos(π/9). Then, using Vieta&#39;s formula, calculated the sum of reciprocals of these roots, which are 1/cos(2π/9) +1/cos(4π/9) -1/cos(π/9)=6. Then, the original sum is this 6 plus the sec(6π/9)=sec(2π/3)= -2. So 6 -2=4. Therefore, the final answer is 4. Hmm.Alternatively, let me verify numerically to check.Compute each term:First, calculate each secant:1. sec(2π/9): 2π/9 ≈ 0.6981 radians, cos(0.6981) ≈ 0.7660, so sec ≈1/0.7660≈1.30542. sec(4π/9): 4π/9≈1.3963 radians, cos≈0.1736, so sec≈5.75883. sec(6π/9)=sec(2π/3)=1/cos(2π/3)=1/(-0.5)= -24. sec(8π/9):8π/9≈2.7925 radians, which is in the second quadrant, cos(8π/9)=cos(π - π/9)= -cos(π/9)≈-0.9397, so sec≈1/(-0.9397)≈-1.0642Therefore, the sum is approximately 1.3054 +5.7588 -2 -1.0642≈1.3054+5.7588=7.0642; 7.0642 -2=5.0642; 5.0642 -1.0642≈4.0. So yes, the numerical approximation gives approximately 4. Therefore, the analytical answer of 4 is correct.Therefore, the answer is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;To calculate the sum (sec frac{2 pi}{9} + sec frac{4 pi}{9} + sec frac{6 pi}{9} + sec frac{8 pi}{9}), we start by noting the following:1. (sec frac{6 pi}{9} = sec frac{2 pi}{3} = -2) because (cos frac{2 pi}{3} = -frac{1}{2}).2. (sec frac{8 pi}{9} = -sec frac{pi}{9}) because (cos frac{8 pi}{9} = -cos frac{pi}{9}).Next, we consider the cubic equation (8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0) whose roots are (cos frac{2pi}{9}), (cos frac{4pi}{9}), and (-cos frac{pi}{9}). Using Vieta&#39;s formulas, we know the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of this equation is:[frac{1}{cos frac{2pi}{9}} + frac{1}{cos frac{4pi}{9}} - frac{1}{cos frac{pi}{9}} = 6]This is derived from the fact that for the cubic equation (8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0), the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is given by (frac{r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3}{r_1r_2r_3} = frac{-3/4}{-1/8} = 6).Including the term (sec frac{2pi}{3} = -2), the total sum is:[left( sec frac{2pi}{9} + sec frac{4pi}{9} - sec frac{pi}{9} right) + sec frac{2pi}{3} = 6 - 2 = 4]Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{4}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to calculate the sum of secants at different angles: sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(6π/9) + sec(8π/9). Hmm, first, let me recall what secant is. Secant is the reciprocal of cosine, so maybe it&#39;s easier to work with cosines first and then take reciprocals? Let me note that down.So, the problem is to find sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(6π/9) + sec(8π/9). Let me see if there&#39;s any symmetry or patterns in these angles. All the angles are multiples of 2π/9. Let&#39;s list them:- 2π/9- 4π/9- 6π/9- 8π/9Wait, 6π/9 simplifies to 2π/3, which is 120 degrees. That&#39;s a more familiar angle. The other angles are 40 degrees (2π/9), 80 degrees (4π/9), and 160 degrees (8π/9). Hmm, maybe there&#39;s a way to relate these angles through some trigonometric identities or roots of unity?Since these angles are all multiples of 2π/9, they might correspond to the ninth roots of unity. Let me recall that the ninth roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^9 = 1. These roots can be written as e^(2πik/9) for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8. However, since we are dealing with angles 2π/9, 4π/9, 6π/9, 8π/9, these correspond to k = 1, 2, 3, 4. But maybe there&#39;s a connection here with the roots of unity?Alternatively, maybe using the identity for sum of secants. I remember that there are some formulas for sums of secants in arithmetic progression, but I don&#39;t recall them exactly. Let me check my knowledge. Alternatively, perhaps express these secants in terms of cosines and then find a common denominator to add them up?But adding fractions with different denominators seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a clever trick. Let me consider that cos(6π/9) is cos(2π/3) which is equal to -1/2. So, sec(6π/9) is sec(2π/3) which is -2. That&#39;s simple. So that term is -2. Then the other terms: sec(2π/9), sec(4π/9), and sec(8π/9). Hmm. Let&#39;s note that 8π/9 is equal to π - π/9, so cos(8π/9) = -cos(π/9), hence sec(8π/9) = -sec(π/9). Similarly, 4π/9 is π/2 - π/18? Wait, no. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe use the identity that cos(π - x) = -cos(x). So cos(8π/9) = cos(π - π/9) = -cos(π/9). Similarly, cos(4π/9) = cos(π - 5π/9) = -cos(5π/9). Wait, 4π/9 is less than π/2? No, 4π/9 is 80 degrees, which is less than 90 degrees. Wait, π/2 is π/2 ≈ 1.57 radians, and 4π/9 ≈ 1.396 radians, so yes, 4π/9 is still less than π/2. Hmm, so maybe that approach isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, perhaps use multiple-angle identities or relate these angles to a known polynomial equation. For example, since these angles are related to the ninth roots of unity, perhaps their cosines satisfy certain equations. Let me recall that cos(θ) for θ = 2πk/9 can be related to the roots of the Chebyshev polynomials or minimal polynomials.Alternatively, consider that the sum we need is sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9) + sec(6π/9). Since sec(6π/9) is -2, we can write the sum as -2 + sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9). So maybe if we can find the sum of sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9), then subtract 2.Alternatively, maybe express these secants in terms of sines or other trigonometric functions. Wait, sec(x) = 1/cos(x). So perhaps using the identity for sum of 1/cos(x) terms. Hmm. Alternatively, use complex numbers. Let me recall Euler&#39;s formula: e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. So maybe expressing cosθ as (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2. Then, 1/cosθ = 2/(e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)). Not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps.Alternatively, consider the roots of some polynomial. For example, if we can find a polynomial whose roots are cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), cos(6π/9), cos(8π/9), then perhaps we can relate the sum of their reciprocals. Let me try that.First, note that cos(6π/9) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2, so that term is already known. The other angles: 2π/9, 4π/9, 8π/9. Wait, 8π/9 is equal to 2π - 10π/9, but maybe that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, note that 8π/9 is 2π/9 * 4. Hmm. Not sure.Alternatively, note that 2π/9, 4π/9, 8π/9 are angles that double each time: 2π/9, 4π/9, 8π/9 (which is 16π/18, but modulo 2π). Wait, 8π/9 is equivalent to 8π/9, not doubling. Hmm.Alternatively, think about the minimal polynomial for cos(2π/9). Let me recall that for a regular nonagon, the angles involved have cosines that satisfy certain cubic equations. Let me check.From some past knowledge, the minimal polynomial for cos(2π/9) is 8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0. Similarly, cos(4π/9) and cos(8π/9) are the other roots of this polynomial. Let me verify that. Let&#39;s denote θ = 2π/9. Then, using the identity cos(3θ) = 4cos^3θ - 3cosθ. Let&#39;s compute cos(3θ). Since θ = 2π/9, 3θ = 6π/9 = 2π/3. So cos(3θ) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2. Therefore, according to the triple angle formula:cos(3θ) = 4cos^3θ - 3cosθ = -1/2.So, 4cos^3θ - 3cosθ + 1/2 = 0. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:8cos^3θ - 6cosθ + 1 = 0.Therefore, cos(2π/9) is a root of 8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0. Similarly, cos(4π/9) and cos(8π/9) would also satisfy this equation because they are also of the form 2πk/9 where k = 2 and 4, and tripling those angles gives 6π/9 and 12π/9 (which is equivalent to 4π/3). Let me check for cos(4π/9):Let θ = 4π/9. Then 3θ = 12π/9 = 4π/3. cos(4π/3) = -1/2. So the same equation holds:4cos^3θ - 3cosθ = -1/2 =&gt; 8cos^3θ - 6cosθ + 1 = 0.Similarly, for θ = 8π/9, 3θ = 24π/9 = 8π/3, which is equivalent to 8π/3 - 2π = 2π/3. So cos(8π/3) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2. So again, the same equation applies. Therefore, cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), and cos(8π/9) are roots of the cubic equation 8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0.Therefore, the three cosines cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), cos(8π/9) are the roots of 8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0. Let&#39;s denote them as c1, c2, c3. Then, by Vieta&#39;s formula:c1 + c2 + c3 = 0 (since the coefficient of x^2 is 0),c1c2 + c1c3 + c2c3 = -6/8 = -3/4,and c1c2c3 = -1/8.Now, we need the sum of secants, which is 1/c1 + 1/c2 + 1/c3 + 1/c4, where c4 = cos(6π/9) = -1/2. So first, let&#39;s compute 1/c1 + 1/c2 + 1/c3, then add 1/c4.The sum 1/c1 + 1/c2 + 1/c3 can be expressed as (c2c3 + c1c3 + c1c2)/(c1c2c3). From Vieta&#39;s formulas, the numerator is c1c2 + c1c3 + c2c3 = -3/4, and the denominator is c1c2c3 = -1/8. Therefore, the sum is (-3/4)/(-1/8) = (-3/4) * (-8/1) = 24/4 = 6. So the sum of 1/c1 + 1/c2 + 1/c3 is 6.Then, adding 1/c4, which is 1/(-1/2) = -2. Therefore, the total sum is 6 + (-2) = 4. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, hold on. Wait, let me confirm.Wait, if c1, c2, c3 are the cosines, then their reciprocals are the secants. So 1/c1 + 1/c2 + 1/c3 = (c2c3 + c1c3 + c1c2)/(c1c2c3) = (-3/4)/(-1/8) = 6. Then, the other term is 1/c4 where c4 = cos(6π/9) = -1/2, so 1/c4 = -2. Therefore, the total sum is 6 + (-2) = 4.But wait, let me check that again. Wait, the original problem states sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(6π/9) + sec(8π/9). So we have four terms: three of them (2π/9, 4π/9, 8π/9) correspond to the roots c1, c2, c3 of the cubic equation, and the fourth term is sec(6π/9) = sec(2π/3) = -2. So the sum is indeed 6 - 2 = 4. So the answer should be 4? But let me verify this with another approach because sometimes these algebraic manipulations might have a mistake.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute the numerical values to check.First, compute each term:- sec(2π/9): 2π/9 ≈ 0.698 radians ≈ 40 degrees. cos(40°) ≈ 0.7660, so sec(40°) ≈ 1 / 0.7660 ≈ 1.3054.- sec(4π/9): 4π/9 ≈ 1.396 radians ≈ 80 degrees. cos(80°) ≈ 0.1736, so sec(80°) ≈ 1 / 0.1736 ≈ 5.7588.- sec(6π/9): 6π/9 = 2π/3 ≈ 2.094 radians ≈ 120 degrees. cos(120°) = -0.5, so sec(120°) = -2.- sec(8π/9): 8π/9 ≈ 2.792 radians ≈ 160 degrees. cos(160°) ≈ -0.9397, so sec(160°) ≈ 1 / (-0.9397) ≈ -1.0642.Wait, hold on, that seems conflicting. Wait, 160 degrees is in the second quadrant, where cosine is negative. So sec(160°) is negative. But according to the previous algebraic approach, the sum of sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9) was 6. But numerically, if we compute:1.3054 (sec40) + 5.7588 (sec80) + (-1.0642) (sec160) ≈ 1.3054 + 5.7588 - 1.0642 ≈ 6.0000.Wow, that actually adds up to approximately 6. Then adding the sec(120°) which is -2, gives 6 - 2 = 4. So numerically, the sum is approximately 4. So that&#39;s a good sign. So maybe the answer is indeed 4. But let me check with higher precision.Let&#39;s compute each term more accurately:- sec(2π/9):2π/9 ≈ 0.6981317007977318 radians.cos(2π/9) ≈ cos(0.6981317007977318) ≈ 0.766044443118978.sec(2π/9) ≈ 1 / 0.766044443118978 ≈ 1.305407289332278.- sec(4π/9):4π/9 ≈ 1.3962634015954636 radians.cos(4π/9) ≈ cos(1.3962634015954636) ≈ 0.17364817766693033.sec(4π/9) ≈ 1 / 0.17364817766693033 ≈ 5.758770483143631.- sec(8π/9):8π/9 ≈ 2.792526803190927 radians.cos(8π/9) ≈ cos(2.792526803190927) ≈ cos(π - π/9) = -cos(π/9) ≈ -0.9396926208.sec(8π/9) ≈ 1 / (-0.9396926208) ≈ -1.064177772.- sec(6π/9):6π/9 = 2π/3 ≈ 2.0943951023931953 radians.cos(2π/3) = -0.5, so sec(2π/3) = -2.Adding them up:1.305407289332278 + 5.758770483143631 + (-1.0641777724758923) + (-2) ≈(1.305407289332278 + 5.758770483143631) = 7.064177772475909Then, (-1.0641777724758923 - 2) = -3.0641777724758923Total sum: 7.064177772475909 - 3.0641777724758923 ≈ 4.000000000000017.Which is approximately 4, so that checks out.Therefore, the algebraic approach was correct. So the answer is 4.But let me also try to see if there&#39;s another way to get this result, maybe through another identity or formula.Alternatively, consider the identity for the sum of secants in an arithmetic sequence. However, the angles here are 2π/9, 4π/9, 6π/9, 8π/9, which is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2π/9. But I&#39;m not sure of a direct formula for the sum of secants in an arithmetic sequence. However, given that we have four terms, maybe splitting them into pairs.Note that sec(2π/9) + sec(8π/9) = sec(2π/9) + sec(π - π/9) = sec(2π/9) - sec(π/9). Similarly, sec(4π/9) + sec(6π/9) = sec(4π/9) + sec(2π/3) = sec(4π/9) - 2. Wait, but this might not help. Alternatively, since 8π/9 = π - π/9, so sec(8π/9) = -1/cos(π/9). Similarly, 4π/9 = π/2 - π/18, but that might not help either.Alternatively, note that the angles 2π/9, 4π/9, 8π/9 are related through doubling: 2π/9 doubled is 4π/9, doubled again is 8π/9, and doubled again is 16π/9, which is equivalent to 16π/9 - 2π = 16π/9 - 18π/9 = -2π/9, which is equivalent to 2π - 2π/9 = 16π/9 (Wait, perhaps not helpful). But maybe using some trigonometric identities related to doubling angles.Alternatively, using the identity for sum of secants. Let me think. If I have three terms: sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9), and I know they sum to 6, but how did we get that from the cubic equation? Let me recap.Since the cosines of those angles are roots of 8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0, let&#39;s denote them as c1, c2, c3. Then, we have:c1 + c2 + c3 = 0,c1c2 + c1c3 + c2c3 = -3/4,c1c2c3 = -1/8.Then, the sum of their reciprocals is (c2c3 + c1c3 + c1c2)/(c1c2c3) = (-3/4)/(-1/8) = 6. That&#39;s how we got 6. Then adding the -2 from sec(2π/3) gives 4.Alternatively, if we didn&#39;t know the cubic equation, could we derive this sum another way?Suppose we let S = sec(2π/9) + sec(4π/9) + sec(8π/9). Then, since these angles are related through the cubic equation, we can use that relationship to find S.Alternatively, maybe express S in terms of the roots of the cubic equation. Since c1, c2, c3 are roots of 8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0, then we have:8c1^3 - 6c1 + 1 = 0,8c2^3 - 6c2 + 1 = 0,8c3^3 - 6c3 + 1 = 0.From this, we can express 1/c1 = 8c1^2 - 6,Similarly, 1/c2 = 8c2^2 - 6,1/c3 = 8c3^2 - 6.Therefore, S = (8c1^2 - 6) + (8c2^2 - 6) + (8c3^2 - 6) = 8(c1^2 + c2^2 + c3^2) - 18.We can compute c1^2 + c2^2 + c3^2 using the identity:c1^2 + c2^2 + c3^2 = (c1 + c2 + c3)^2 - 2(c1c2 + c1c3 + c2c3).We know c1 + c2 + c3 = 0,so c1^2 + c2^2 + c3^2 = 0 - 2*(-3/4) = 3/2.Therefore, S = 8*(3/2) - 18 = 12 - 18 = -6. Wait, but this contradicts our previous result. Wait, this can&#39;t be. Wait, what&#39;s going on here.Wait, if 8c^3 -6c +1 =0, then 8c^3 = 6c -1 =&gt; c^3 = (6c -1)/8.But then, how do we get 1/c?If we start with 8c^3 -6c +1 =0,Divide both sides by c^3:8 -6/c^2 +1/c^3 =0 =&gt; 8 + (-6)/c^2 + 1/c^3 =0.Not sure if that&#39;s helpful. Alternatively, solving for 1/c:From 8c^3 -6c +1 =0,Divide both sides by c:8c^2 -6 + 1/c =0 =&gt; 1/c = -8c^2 +6.Therefore, 1/c = -8c^2 +6. Therefore, for each root c1, c2, c3,1/c1 = -8c1^2 +6,1/c2 = -8c2^2 +6,1/c3 = -8c3^2 +6.Therefore, the sum S = 1/c1 +1/c2 +1/c3 = -8(c1^2 +c2^2 +c3^2) + 18.Earlier, we found c1^2 +c2^2 +c3^2 = 3/2,Thus, S = -8*(3/2) +18 = -12 +18 =6, which matches the previous result.Therefore, this method gives S=6, and then adding the -2 gives 4. So that&#39;s consistent.Therefore, this confirms that the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the cubic equation 8x^3 -6x +1=0 is indeed 6, and thus the total sum is 4. So the answer is 4.Alternatively, is there a more geometric approach? For example, using the unit circle or some geometric constructions? But I think the algebraic approach using the cubic equation and Vieta&#39;s formulas is the most straightforward here.Therefore, after carefully considering the problem, applying knowledge of trigonometric identities, roots of unity, Vieta&#39;s formulas, and verifying with numerical calculations, I can confidently conclude that the value of the given sum is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;To calculate (sec frac{2 pi}{9} + sec frac{4 pi}{9} + sec frac{6 pi}{9} + sec frac{8 pi}{9}), we start by noting that (sec frac{6 pi}{9} = sec frac{2 pi}{3} = -2). Next, we consider the angles (frac{2 pi}{9}), (frac{4 pi}{9}), and (frac{8 pi}{9}). These angles correspond to the roots of the cubic polynomial (8x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0), which are (cos frac{2 pi}{9}), (cos frac{4 pi}{9}), and (cos frac{8 pi}{9}).

Let me start by understanding the problem. An eight-digit number means it&#39;s a number from 10,000,000 to 99,999,999. The challenge is to make sure exactly four of those digits are 4s, and the rest should be other digits. Also, it needs to be the smallest possible such number. First, to get the smallest number possible, we want the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. So, ideally, the first digit should be 1, but wait, the number is eight digits. The first digit can&#39;t be 0, so the smallest possible first digit is 1. However, if we put a 1 in the first position, we need to place the four 4s in the remaining seven digits. But if we use 1 as the first digit, then the rest of the digits can be arranged such that the next digits are as small as possible. Let me think step by step.Let&#39;s represent the number as D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8. Each Di is a digit from 0-9, with D1 ≠ 0.We need exactly four of these digits to be 4. To make the number as small as possible, we want the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. So starting with D1. The smallest D1 can be is 1, but if we set D1 to 1, then the remaining seven digits need to contain four 4s. Alternatively, if D1 is 4, then we would have three more 4s to distribute among the remaining seven digits, but starting with 4 might make the number larger. So probably starting with 1 is better. Let&#39;s check.If we set D1 to 1, then we need to place four 4s in D2 to D8. To make the number as small as possible, we want the next digits after D1 to be as small as possible. So we should place the 4s as far to the right as possible. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again.Actually, when constructing the smallest number, you want the leftmost possible digits to be as small as possible. So, even though we have to place four 4s, we should place them in the highest possible positions (closest to the left) but keeping the overall number as small as possible. Wait, that&#39;s a bit conflicting.Let me recall a similar problem. For example, if we want the smallest number with a certain number of digits and a specific number of a particular digit, say 1s. The strategy is to place the 1s as far to the right as possible. Wait, but that&#39;s when the digits are required to be 1s. But here, we have to have exactly four 4s. So, perhaps the approach is to place the 4s in the positions where they can be replaced by the smallest possible digits, but not conflicting with the requirement.Alternatively, think of the problem as starting with the smallest possible eight-digit number, which is 10,000,000, and then replacing four digits with 4s in such a way that the resulting number is as small as possible. But replacing which digits? If we replace the last four digits with 4s, we get 10,000,444. But that might not be the smallest. Because if we can replace some digits in the middle with 4s but keep the earlier digits smaller.Wait, let me test this. Suppose we take 10,000,000. If we need four 4s, we could replace the last four zeros with 4s: 10,000,444. Alternatively, if we replace some earlier digits. For instance, replacing the fourth digit from the left (the first digit of the number is 1, then three zeros). So 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. If we replace the fourth digit (D4) with 4, then we get 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 0. Then we still need three more 4s. If we place them towards the end, maybe 1 0 0 4 0 4 4 4. But that would be 10040444. Comparing that to 10000444. Which is smaller? Let&#39;s see:10040444 vs 10000444. The first difference is at the fourth digit: 0 vs 4. So 10000444 is smaller. Therefore, replacing the last digits is better. Wait, so in this case, putting the 4s as far to the right as possible gives a smaller number. So perhaps the strategy is to place the 4s in the rightmost positions possible. But then, what if we can&#39;t? Let&#39;s see.But in the above example, replacing the last four digits with 4s gives a valid number. However, 10,000,444 has four 4s. But we need to check if there is a smaller number with four 4s. For example, if we can place some 4s earlier but compensate with smaller digits elsewhere. Wait, if we place a 4 earlier but replace a higher digit with a smaller digit. Let me think.Suppose we have the number starting with 1, then next digits as 0s. So 1 followed by seven 0s. To add four 4s, replace the last four 0s with 4s: 10000444. Alternatively, replace three 0s with 4s at the end and one 4 earlier. For instance, 10004044. Let&#39;s compare:10000444 vs 10004044. Starting from the left, the first four digits are 1,0,0,0 vs 1,0,0,0. The fifth digit is 0 vs 4. So 10000444 is smaller. Similarly, if we place a 4 earlier, like in the third digit: 10040044. But again, comparing to 10000444, the third digit is 0 vs 0, fourth digit 0 vs 4, so 10000444 is still smaller.Alternatively, if we replace the second digit (which is 0) with a 4, but that would make the number start with 14..., which is 14,000,000, which is way larger than 10,000,444. So definitely not helpful.Therefore, placing the 4s as far to the right as possible gives a smaller number. So 10000444 is a candidate. But we need to check if that&#39;s indeed the case, or if there&#39;s a smaller number.Wait, another approach. Let&#39;s think of the number as starting with 1, then followed by as many 0s as possible. So to minimize the number, after the first digit, the next digits should be 0s, but we have to include four 4s. So the earliest 4s can be placed is starting from the second digit. But replacing a 0 with a 4 in an earlier digit would increase the number. For example, 10000444 is smaller than 10004044, which is smaller than 10040044, etc. So the strategy is to push the 4s as far to the right as possible.But let me confirm. Suppose we have two numbers: 10000444 and 10004440. Wait, but 10004440 has four 4s as well. Comparing these two: 10000444 vs 10004440. The first number is 10,000,444 and the second is 10,004,440. Which is smaller? Let&#39;s break it down:1 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 vs 1 0 0 0 4 4 4 0Looking at the fifth digit: 0 vs 4. The first number has 0 in the fifth position, which is smaller, so 10,000,444 is smaller. Therefore, having the 4s as far to the right as possible is better.Therefore, the number 10,000,444 seems to be the minimal. However, wait, but 10,000,444 is an eight-digit number with four 4s. But is that the minimal? Let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a number starting with 1, followed by three 0s, then a 4, but then followed by digits that are less than 4. Wait, but how?For example, 10004004. Let&#39;s see, that has 4s in the fourth and seventh positions. So only two 4s. Not enough. So to get four 4s, you need to have four digits as 4. If you try to spread them out, but each time you replace a 0 with a 4, you need to compensate by having smaller digits to the right, but since we can&#39;t have digits smaller than 0, which is already the minimum, perhaps the only way is to replace 0s with 4s as far right as possible.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another approach. Suppose instead of starting with 1, we have to have 4 in some positions. But starting with 1 is better because 1 is smaller than 4. Therefore, the first digit should be 1. Then the rest should be as small as possible with three more 4s. Wait, wait, no. The total number of 4s required is four. If the first digit is 1, then the remaining seven digits need to contain four 4s. If the first digit is 4, then the remaining seven digits need to contain three 4s. But starting with 4 would make the number larger. So 1 followed by four 4s in the last four digits would be 10000444. Let&#39;s check that.But wait, 10,000,444 has four 4s: digits 5,6,7,8. Wait, no. Wait, the digits are:D1:1, D2:0, D3:0, D4:0, D5:0, D6:4, D7:4, D8:4. Wait, that&#39;s three 4s. Wait, no! Wait, 10,000,444 is D1=1, D2=0, D3=0, D4=0, D5=0, D6=4, D7=4, D8=4. That&#39;s three 4s. Oh! So actually, that&#39;s only three 4s. So that&#39;s not enough. Oops, my mistake. So replacing the last three digits with 4s gives only three 4s. Therefore, we need one more 4 somewhere else.Therefore, 10,000,444 has only three 4s, so we need another 4. So to have four 4s, we need to replace one more 0 with a 4. So perhaps 10,000,444 becomes 10,004,444. Let&#39;s check:D1:1, D2:0, D3:0, D4:0, D5:4, D6:4, D7:4, D8:4. That&#39;s four 4s. But the number is 10,004,444. Is that the smallest? But earlier we thought that putting the 4s as far right as possible is better, but in this case, we have to have one 4 earlier. Let&#39;s see.If we have to have four 4s, and the first digit is 1, then the remaining seven digits must include four 4s. So the minimal number would be 1 followed by three 0s, then four 4s: 10004444. Wait, let&#39;s check:D1:1, D2:0, D3:0, D4:0, D5:4, D6:4, D7:4, D8:4. So that&#39;s 10,004,444. Alternatively, can we place the 4s in a way that the number is smaller? For example, instead of four consecutive 4s starting at D5, can we have a 4 earlier but then have smaller digits after that?Wait, suppose we place one 4 in D4, and the remaining three 4s in D6-D8. So the number would be 10040444. Let&#39;s compare 10040444 vs 10004444.Starting from the left:1 0 0 4 vs 1 0 0 0At D4, 4 vs 0. So 10004444 is smaller because the fourth digit is 0 instead of 4. So even though in 10040444 the next digits after D4 are smaller (0 instead of 4), the earlier digit being 0 makes 10004444 smaller. Therefore, 10004444 is smaller than 10040444. Therefore, placing the 4s starting from D5 is better.Alternatively, what if we spread out the 4s? For example, 10040444 has two 4s separated. But that seems not better.Wait, another approach: To minimize the number, after the first digit, we want the remaining digits to be as small as possible. Since we need four 4s in total, the first digit is 1, then we have seven digits left. To make the number as small as possible, the leftmost of these seven digits should be as small as possible. So we need to fit four 4s into the seven digits. To make the number as small as possible, we should place the 4s in the rightmost positions. So the earliest we can place a 4 is as far right as possible. Wait, but if we have four 4s, they need to occupy four positions among the seven digits. The minimal number would be when the non-4 digits are as left as possible and as small as possible (i.e., 0s). Therefore, the minimal number would be 1 followed by three 0s and then four 4s. Wait, that&#39;s 10004444. But let&#39;s check how many digits that is.Wait, 1 followed by three 0s: D1=1, D2=0, D3=0, D4=0, then D5=4, D6=4, D7=4, D8=4. So that&#39;s 10004444, which is eight digits. But let&#39;s check the count of 4s: four 4s (D5-D8). That&#39;s correct. So that&#39;s 10,004,444. Now, is this the minimal?Alternatively, if we can have a 4 in an earlier position but replace a higher digit with a lower digit. Wait, but all the digits after the first are 0s. If we replace a 0 with a 4 earlier, the number becomes larger. For example, 10004444 vs 10040444. The fourth digit in the first is 0, in the second is 4, so the first is smaller.Alternatively, can we have a number like 10004440? Wait, but that would have three 4s. Not enough. Similarly, 10004404 would have three 4s. So to get four 4s, we need to have four digits as 4 in the last four positions. Wait, but in 10004444, that&#39;s four 4s. So that&#39;s the minimal. But let&#39;s check another possibility.Suppose we start with 1, then have two 0s, a 4, and then three 0s, and then three 4s. Wait, that would be 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 4. But that&#39;s only two 4s. No, not enough. Alternatively, 1 0 0 4 0 4 4 4. That&#39;s four 4s. So 10040444. As we saw before, that&#39;s 10,040,444. Which is larger than 10,004,444. Therefore, 10,004,444 is smaller.Wait, another thought. If instead of placing all four 4s in the last four digits, can we place some 4s earlier but have a smaller digit after that? For example, if we have a 4 in D5, but then a 0 in D6. But then we need to compensate by having more 4s in the remaining digits. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we have D5=4, D6=0, then D7 and D8=4. That&#39;s three 4s. Then we need another 4. Let&#39;s put D4=4. So the number is 1 0 0 4 4 0 4 4, which is 10,044,044. Comparing to 10,004,444. Which is smaller? Starting from the left: 1,0,0,4 vs 1,0,0,0. The fourth digit is 4 vs 0, so 10,004,444 is smaller.Alternatively, trying to place a 4 in D2, but that would make the number start with 14..., which is 14 million something, which is way larger.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if 10,004,444 is indeed the minimal. Let&#39;s consider another candidate. Suppose we have the four 4s starting from D4: 1 0 0 4 4 4 4 0. Wait, that&#39;s 10,044,440. But this has four 4s (D4-D7). Comparing to 10,004,444: 10,004,444 vs 10,044,440. The first difference is at D4: 0 vs 4. So 10,004,444 is smaller.Another candidate: 1 0 4 0 0 4 4 4. That&#39;s 10,400,444. Which is obviously larger because the third digit is 4 vs 0 in 10,004,444.Alternatively, 1 4 0 0 0 4 4 4: 14,000,444. Again, starting with 14, which is larger than 10.So, seems like 10,004,444 is the minimal. But wait, wait a second. Let me check if there is a number smaller than 10,004,444 with four 4s.Wait, 10,000,444 has three 4s. If we add another 4 in D5, making it 10,004,444. That&#39;s the next possible. But is there a number between 10,000,444 and 10,004,444 that has four 4s? For example, 10,001,444. That has three 4s. 10,002,444: also three 4s. Similarly, 10,003,444: three 4s. Then 10,004,444 is the next with four 4s.But wait, what if we have a number like 10,000,444, which is three 4s, and then replace one of the earlier 0s with a 4. For example, 10,004,044. That has four 4s. But 10,004,044 is 10,004,044. Comparing to 10,004,444. Which one is smaller? The first difference is at D7: 0 vs 4. So 10,004,044 is smaller than 10,004,444. Wait, so 10,004,044 is smaller. Hmm, so maybe that&#39;s a better candidate. Let&#39;s check.Wait, 10,004,044: D1=1, D2=0, D3=0, D4=0, D5=4, D6=0, D7=4, D8=4. That&#39;s four 4s. So, the number is 10,004,044. Comparing to 10,004,444. Which is smaller? The first six digits are the same: 10,004. Then the seventh digit: 0 vs 4. So 10,004,044 is smaller. So that&#39;s a better candidate.Wait, so maybe the minimal number is 10,004,044. Let&#39;s check how many 4s that is. D5, D7, D8 are 4s. Wait, that&#39;s three 4s. Wait, no. D5=4, D7=4, D8=4. So three 4s. So that&#39;s not enough. Wait, D4=0. So only three 4s. So 10,004,044 has only three 4s. Therefore, that&#39;s invalid.Wait, so to have four 4s, we need four digits. So in 10,004,044, only three digits are 4. So that&#39;s insufficient. Therefore, my mistake. Then perhaps 10,004,444 is the next candidate. Let&#39;s check the count: D5=4, D6=4, D7=4, D8=4. So four 4s. So that&#39;s correct.But then, wait, can we spread the 4s in a way that some digits after an earlier 4 are smaller? For example, 10,004,404. Let&#39;s check the count: D5=4, D6=4, D7=0, D8=4. That&#39;s three 4s. Not enough. Similarly, 10,004,440: D5=4, D6=4, D7=4, D8=0. Three 4s. Not enough. So to have four 4s in the last four digits, it has to be D5=4, D6=4, D7=4, D8=4. So 10,004,444.But wait, what about 10,000,444? That has three 4s. So to get four 4s, we need to add one more 4. So we have to replace one more 0 with a 4. The question is, which 0 to replace. To keep the number as small as possible, we want to replace the rightmost possible 0 that&#39;s not already a 4. Wait, in 10,000,444, the digits are 1,0,0,0,0,4,4,4. To add another 4, we need to replace one of the first four 0s with a 4. But replacing an earlier 0 with a 4 would make the number larger. For example:Replacing D2 (the first 0) with 4: 14,000,444 – which is way larger. Replacing D3 with 4: 10,400,444 – larger. Replacing D4 with 4: 10,040,444 – larger. Replacing D5 with 4: 10,004,444. So replacing D5 (the fifth digit) with 4 gives us 10,004,444, which is the next possible number with four 4s. But wait, what if we replace D5 with 4 and then make the digits after that as small as possible? But after D5, if we replace D5 with 4, the remaining digits (D6, D7, D8) can be 0s, but we need three more 4s. Wait, no. If we replace D5 with 4, then we need three more 4s in D6-D8. But D6-D8 were already 4s in the original 10,000,444. So replacing D5 with 4 gives us four 4s. Thus, 10,004,444 is the minimal number.But let&#39;s check another approach. Suppose we don&#39;t fix the first digit as 1. Although 1 is the smallest possible first digit, perhaps by having a 4 in the first digit, we can have more flexibility in the other digits? But starting with 4 would make the number at least 40,000,000, which is way larger than 10,000,000. So that&#39;s not helpful. Therefore, the first digit must be 1.So with D1=1, we need four 4s in D2-D8. To make the entire number as small as possible, we want the leftmost of these four 4s to be as far to the right as possible. So we should place the 4s in the last four digits (D5-D8). But as we saw earlier, replacing D5-D8 with 4s gives us four 4s: 10,004,444. However, let&#39;s confirm:Wait, D1=1, D2=0, D3=0, D4=0, D5=4, D6=4, D7=4, D8=4. So yes, four 4s. The number is 10,004,444. But let me think if there&#39;s a way to have a smaller number by having a 4 in an earlier position but smaller digits following. For example, 10,004,144. Let&#39;s check: D5=4, D8=4, but D6=1, D7=4. So that&#39;s two 4s. Not enough. Or 10,004,414: two 4s. Still not enough. So unless we place multiple 4s in the later digits, but that would require replacing more 0s. Wait, but we need exactly four 4s.Wait another idea: What if instead of replacing D5-D8, we replace D4, D6, D7, D8. So 1,0,0,4,0,4,4,4. That&#39;s 10,040,444. But this is larger than 10,004,444. Similarly, replacing D3, D5, D6, D7: 1,0,4,0,4,4,4,4: 10,404,444. Which is even larger.Alternatively, what if we place three 4s at the end and one 4 somewhere else, but in a position where the digit is already low. Wait, for example, 10,000,444 plus a 4 in D2: 14,000,444 (too large). 10,400,444 (replaced D3 with 4). But that&#39;s larger. 10,040,444 (replaced D4 with 4). Still larger. So any replacement of an earlier 0 with a 4 increases the number. Therefore, the only way to have four 4s without increasing the number beyond 10,004,444 is to replace D5 with a 4 and keep D6-D8 as 4s. Therefore, 10,004,444 is the minimal.Wait, but let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a number with four 4s that is smaller than 10,004,444. Let&#39;s see. The number 10,004,444 is 1 followed by three 0s and four 4s. What if we can have a number where after the first digit, we have a 0, then a 4, but followed by smaller digits?For example, 1,0,4,0,0,0,4,4. That&#39;s 10,400,044. But that has three 4s. Not enough. 1,0,4,0,0,4,4,4: 10,400,444. Four 4s. But this is 10,400,444 which is larger than 10,004,444. Similarly, 1,0,0,4,0,4,4,4: 10,040,444. Larger. So all these numbers are larger.Alternatively, 1,0,0,0,4,0,4,4: 10,004,044. But that has three 4s. Not enough. 1,0,0,0,4,4,0,4: three 4s. Not enough.Wait, unless we have two 4s in the middle and two at the end. For example, 1,0,0,4,4,0,4,4. That&#39;s four 4s. The number is 10,044,044. Comparing to 10,004,444. The first difference is at D4: 0 vs 4. So 10,004,444 is smaller.Therefore, after checking various possibilities, it seems that 10,004,444 is indeed the smallest eight-digit number with exactly four 4s. However, wait a minute. Let&#39;s check the count again. The number 10,004,444 has four 4s in positions D5-D8. But what about numbers like 10,000,444 with three 4s and adding another 4 in an earlier position without increasing the number too much? But as we saw, adding a 4 earlier would require replacing a 0 with a 4, which would make that digit larger, thus increasing the overall number.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Maybe there&#39;s a way to have a smaller number by having a non-zero digit before the 4s, allowing the 4s to be placed further left but compensated by smaller digits after. For example, let&#39;s say the number is 10,001,444. But that only has three 4s. To get four 4s, we need another one. Replace the 1 with a 4: 10,004,444. Which brings us back to the same number.Alternatively, what if we have 10,002,444. That has three 4s. Replace a 2 with a 4: 10,004,244. But that&#39;s still three 4s. Replace another digit: 10,004,444. So again, we end up there.Alternatively, if we have digits other than 0 in the earlier positions. For example, 10,010,444. But replacing the 1 with a 4 gives 10,040,444, which is larger.Alternatively, using digits less than 4 in some positions. Wait, digits can be from 0-9, but to minimize the number, we want digits as small as possible. So using 0s is better. So replacing a 0 with a 4 is bad for minimizing, but we have to do it four times. So the minimal way is to replace the last four 0s with 4s. But in an eight-digit number starting with 1, the digits are 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Replacing the last four 0s gives 1,0,0,0,4,4,4,4. Which is 10,004,444. If we instead replace, say, the fourth 0 and the last three, we get 1,0,0,4,4,4,4,4. Wait, that&#39;s five 4s. Too many.Alternatively, replacing the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth digits: 10,004,444. Exactly four 4s. So that seems correct.Therefore, after considering various possibilities and ensuring that all other configurations either don&#39;t have enough 4s or result in a larger number, I conclude that the smallest eight-digit number with exactly four 4s is 10,004,444.But let me verify once more. Let&#39;s count the 4s in 10,004,444:- Position 5: 4- Position 6: 4- Position 7: 4- Position 8: 4That&#39;s four 4s. Correct. And the digits before that are all 0s except the first digit, which is 1. So the number is indeed 10,004,444. Comparing this with any other eight-digit number with four 4s, this should be the smallest because any other arrangement would have a larger digit in an earlier position, making the overall number larger.Therefore, the answer should be 10,004,444, which is 10004444, and in boxed form, that&#39;s boxed{10004444}.Final Answerboxed{10004444}&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest eight-digit number with exactly four digits that are 4, we start by noting that the number must begin with 1 (since starting with a smaller digit is impossible and starting with 4 or higher would result in a larger number). We need to place four 4s in the remaining seven digits. To minimize the number, we should place the 4s as far to the right as possible. The smallest number is achieved by replacing the last four digits with 4s. However, we need to ensure that exactly four digits are 4s.Starting with the number 10,000,000 (the smallest eight-digit number), we need to replace four 0s with 4s. The optimal way to do this without increasing the number is to replace the last four 0s. However, replacing the last four digits (positions 5 to 8) with 4s gives us the number 10,004,444. Verifying this:- The digits are 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4.- There are exactly four 4s in positions 5 to 8.- This number is indeed the smallest because any other placement of 4s would result in a larger digit in an earlier position, thus increasing the overall number.Thus, the smallest eight-digit number with exactly four digits being 4 is boxed{10004444}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the smallest eight-digit number that has exactly four digits which are 4. Let me start by understanding the problem properly.First, an eight-digit number means the number ranges from 10,000,000 to 99,999,999. The first digit can&#39;t be zero because otherwise, it wouldn&#39;t be an eight-digit number. Now, the requirement is that exactly four of these digits are 4s. The rest of the digits can be any other digit from 0-9 except 4, right? But we want the smallest possible number, so we need to arrange those four 4s in such a way that the number is as small as possible.Let me recall that to make the smallest number possible, we need the digits to be as small as possible from left to right. So the leftmost digit should be as small as possible, then the next, and so on. But since we have to include four 4s, we need to place them in the highest possible positions (closest to the left) where they can be replaced by the smallest digits possible. Wait, actually, no. Wait, if we place smaller digits to the left, the number becomes smaller. So maybe we should try to place the 4s as far to the right as possible? Hmm, perhaps.But let&#39;s think step by step. Let&#39;s consider that the number is eight digits: D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8. Each D is a digit from 0-9, with D1 ≠ 0.We need exactly four of these digits to be 4. To make the number as small as possible, we want the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. So ideally, D1 should be 1, then D2 should be 0 if possible, but D1 can&#39;t be 0. But wait, since we have to include four 4s, maybe we need to balance between making the left digits small and replacing some digits with 4s where necessary.Wait, for example, if we try to set the first few digits to the smallest possible, and then fill the remaining digits with 4s. But we need exactly four 4s. So perhaps the strategy is to place the 4s in the rightmost positions, replacing the higher digits. But I need to be careful here.Let me think. To minimize the number, we need the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. So the first digit should be 1, then the next digits should be 0s, then 4s. But wait, if we have four 4s, maybe the earliest we can place a 4 is when we can&#39;t have a smaller digit.Wait, perhaps the minimal number would start with 1 followed by as many 0s as possible, but then we have to include four 4s. Let&#39;s see. For example, if the number is 10000000, but that has zero 4s. So we need to replace four 0s with 4s. But if we replace the last four digits with 4s, we get 10004444. Is that the minimal?Wait, but maybe we can get a smaller number by placing the 4s earlier if that allows the digits after them to be smaller. Wait, let&#39;s test this.Suppose we have 10004444. Now, if we move a 4 to an earlier position, say, replacing the fourth digit (the first 0) with a 4, then the number becomes 10044440. Wait, but 10044440 is 10,044,440, which is larger than 10,004,444. Because comparing digit by digit: 1 vs 1, 0 vs 0, 0 vs 0, 0 vs 4, so 10,004,444 is smaller. So moving the 4s earlier actually makes the number bigger. So maybe putting the 4s as far to the right as possible is better.Alternatively, what if we have the first digit as 1, followed by three 0s, and then four 4s, but that would only be 8 digits. Wait, 1 followed by three 0s is four digits, then four 4s: 10004444. So that&#39;s eight digits. But is this the smallest?Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a number starting with 1, then some 0s, then some 4s, but with some non-4 digits after the 4s? For instance, 10004440 would have three 4s. So we need exactly four. So 10004444 is the first idea.But let&#39;s check. Suppose instead of replacing the last four 0s with 4s, we replace some other 0s. For example, replacing three 0s at the end and one 0 somewhere else. But if we replace an earlier 0 with a 4, then the number becomes larger. For example, 10040444 is larger than 10004444. So indeed, replacing the latest possible digits with 4s gives a smaller number.But perhaps even starting with a smaller first digit? Wait, the first digit has to be at least 1. So 1 is the smallest possible. So 1 followed by as many 0s as possible, then replacing the last four digits with 4s. But wait, if we have the first digit as 1, then the next three digits can be 0s, then the last four digits as 4s. That gives 10004444. But let&#39;s check how many digits are 4: four. So that&#39;s exactly four. But is there a smaller number?Wait, what if the first digit is 1, then some 0s, then some 4s, and then some other digits that are not 4s. But we need exactly four 4s. So maybe if we can have some digits after the 4s that are smaller than 4? But digits smaller than 4 would be 0,1,2,3. But if we put a digit smaller than 4 after a 4, that would mean the overall number is smaller. Wait, but if we have 4s followed by smaller digits, the number would be smaller. Wait, but how?For example, suppose we have 10004440. Then the last digit is 0, which is smaller than 4, but then the number of 4s is three. So we need to have four 4s. So perhaps 10004444 is the minimal. But let&#39;s see.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider numbers where some of the 4s are not at the end, but in the middle, but followed by digits lower than 4, but how does that work?Wait, if we have a 4 in an earlier position followed by a lower digit, the number would be larger than if the lower digit was first. For example, 10004444 vs 10004044. Wait, 10004044 is smaller? Let&#39;s check:10004044 vs 10004444. Let&#39;s compare digit by digit:1 0 0 0 4 0 4 4 vs 1 0 0 0 4 4 4 4. The first five digits are the same. The sixth digit is 0 vs 4. So 10004044 is smaller. But wait, but 10004044 has only three 4s. Wait, let&#39;s count:Digits: 1,0,0,0,4,0,4,4. That&#39;s three 4s. So we need exactly four. So in order to have four 4s, we need another 4. Let&#39;s try 10004404. That has 1,0,0,0,4,4,0,4. That&#39;s four 4s. Let&#39;s compare this with 10004444. The first five digits are the same. The sixth digit: 4 vs 4. Then the seventh digit: 0 vs 4. So 10004404 is smaller. Hmm, so maybe this is a better candidate.Wait, but let&#39;s verify. 10004404. That&#39;s 10,004,404. Compare with 10,004,444. Yes, 10,004,404 is smaller. But wait, in this case, the four 4s are at positions 5,6,8. Wait, no: positions 5,6,8. Wait, positions start from 1. So positions 5,6,8. That&#39;s three 4s. Wait, no: 1 (1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 0 (4), 4 (5), 4 (6), 0 (7), 4 (8). So that&#39;s three 4s. Wait, no. Wait, position 5 is 4, position 6 is 4, position 8 is 4. So that&#39;s three 4s. So 10004404 has three 4s. Therefore, that&#39;s not acceptable. So we need exactly four 4s.So if I have 1,0,0,0,4,4,4,4 that&#39;s four 4s. If I try to move one of the 4s earlier, but replace a later 4 with a smaller digit, but then we need to still have four 4s. So for example, if we have 1,0,0,4,0,4,4,4. Let&#39;s count the 4s: positions 4,6,7,8: four 4s. The number is 10,040,444. Compare that with 10,004,444. Which is smaller? 10,004,444 is smaller because the fourth digit is 0 vs 4. So moving the 4s to the left makes the number larger.Alternatively, maybe we can have 1,0,0,0,4,4,4,4 (10,004,444) versus another arrangement where a 4 is placed in a higher position but with a smaller digit after it. Wait, but if we place a 4 in a higher position, even if we put a smaller digit after it, the number would be larger. For example, 10,004,444 vs 10,004,344. Wait, 10,004,344 has three 4s. So to have four 4s, we need to have another 4. Let&#39;s see. Maybe 10,004,434. That still has three 4s. Hmm.Wait, maybe replacing some of the 0s with 4s but keeping the digits after as small as possible. For example, 10,004,444 is four 4s. If we can replace a later 0 with a 4 and an earlier 4 with a smaller digit, but since the digits before are already 0s, which are the smallest possible, except for the first digit.Wait, perhaps the minimal number is 10,004,444. But let&#39;s check another possibility. Suppose the first digit is 1, then the next three digits are 0s, then followed by four 4s. That&#39;s 10004444. But maybe if we have the first digit as 1, then two 0s, then a 4, and then some digits. Wait, but that would introduce a 4 earlier, making the number larger.For example, 10040004. Let&#39;s count the 4s: positions 4 and 8. Only two. So we need two more. Maybe 10044004. That&#39;s three 4s. Still not enough. 10044400: three 4s. Not enough. 10040444: four 4s. Let&#39;s check that. 10,040,444. That&#39;s four 4s. Comparing with 10,004,444. Which is smaller? 10,004,444 is smaller because the fourth digit is 0 vs 4. So even though 10,040,444 has a 4 earlier, making the number larger, the 10,004,444 is still smaller.Therefore, perhaps 10,004,444 is the smallest. But wait, let&#39;s see. What if we can have a number where some of the digits after the 4s are not 4, but smaller digits. However, since we need exactly four 4s, we have to have four 4s. So, for example, if we have 10004434, that&#39;s three 4s. Not enough. 10004443: three 4s. 10004444: four 4s. So perhaps 10004444 is indeed the smallest.But wait, let me check another arrangement. What if instead of having four 4s at the end, we place some 4s in the middle with smaller digits after them. For example, 10004440 is three 4s. If we change the last digit to a 4, we get 10004444. Alternatively, maybe 10004414. Wait, that has four 4s. Let&#39;s check:Digits: 1,0,0,0,4,4,1,4. So positions 5,6,8: three 4s. Wait, no. Wait, positions 5 is 4, 6 is 4, 8 is 4. Only three. So not enough. So to get four 4s, we need to have another 4. So perhaps 10004444 is the only way.Alternatively, maybe 10040444. Let&#39;s count: 1,0,0,4,0,4,4,4. That&#39;s four 4s (positions 4,6,7,8). So the number is 10,040,444. Comparing with 10,004,444. Which is smaller? 10,004,444 is smaller because the fourth digit is 0 instead of 4.Alternatively, 10014444. But that has four 4s at the end, but the fourth digit is 1. So 10,014,444. But that&#39;s larger than 10,004,444.Alternatively, 10044440. That has four 4s (positions 4,5,6,7). So the number is 10,044,440. Which is larger than 10,004,444.Alternatively, 10034444. But that would have three 4s. Wait, 1,0,0,3,4,4,4,4. So four 4s. The number is 10,034,444. Which is larger than 10,004,444. So 10,004,444 is still smaller.Wait, maybe even numbers starting with 1 followed by more 0s. But 1 followed by three 0s is the first four digits as 1,0,0,0. Then the remaining four digits have to be 4s. So 10004444. If we try to have more 0s after that, but since we have eight digits, the first four are 1,0,0,0, and then the next four have to be 4s.Alternatively, if we can have the 4s spread out in such a way that the number is smaller. For example, 10004444 vs 10004444. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a way to have the 4s in positions where they are followed by smaller digits. But given that we need four 4s, once you have a 4 in a certain position, all digits after that could be minimized. But the problem is that replacing a 4 with a smaller digit would reduce the count of 4s. So unless we can replace a 4 with a smaller digit and add another 4 somewhere else. But adding a 4 somewhere else would require putting it in a higher position, which would make the number larger.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. Suppose we have 10004444. Now, if we take the rightmost 4 and change it to a 0, but then we have to put a 4 in an earlier position to keep the count at four. But putting a 4 in an earlier position would make the number larger. For example, changing 10004444 to 10004440 and adding a 4 at position 5: 10044440. But as we saw before, 10044440 is larger than 10004444. So that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, what if we spread the 4s out more. For example, 10040444. That&#39;s 10,040,444, which is larger. Alternatively, 10004444 vs 10014444. Wait, 10014444 has four 4s but the fifth digit is 1, which is larger than 0. So 10014444 is larger than 10004444.Alternatively, maybe 10000444. Wait, that&#39;s only seven digits. So no. 10,000,444 is seven digits. So no.Alternatively, 10004444 is eight digits. So seems like 10004444 is the minimal.Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s check numbers where there are leading digits smaller than 1. But the first digit has to be at least 1. So 1 is the smallest possible. So the first digit is 1.Now, the second digit. If we can make the second digit 0, that would be better. Then third digit 0, fourth digit 0, fifth digit 0. Wait, but we need four 4s. So if we have 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, that&#39;s 10,000,000. But we need four 4s. So replacing four of the zeros with 4s. To keep the number as small as possible, replace the last four zeros with 4s. So 10,000,444. But wait, 10,000,444 is only seven digits. Wait, no. Wait, 10,000,444 is eight digits: 1,0,0,0,0,4,4,4. Wait, that&#39;s eight digits. Let me check. 10,000,444. Yes, that&#39;s eight digits. Wait, but the digits are 1,0,0,0,0,4,4,4. So only three 4s. So we need one more 4.So to have four 4s, we need another 4. So perhaps 10,000,4444. But that&#39;s nine digits. So invalid. Wait, so 10,000,444 is eight digits with three 4s. So to get four 4s, we need to replace another 0 with a 4. Let&#39;s do that. For example, replace the fifth digit (which is 0) with a 4. So the number becomes 10,004,444. Which is eight digits: 1,0,0,0,4,4,4,4. So that&#39;s four 4s.So 10,004,444. Is there a way to make this number smaller?For instance, can we rearrange the 4s to be in earlier positions but somehow have the overall number be smaller? As we saw earlier, putting 4s earlier tends to make the number larger. For example, 10,004,444 vs 10,000,444. Wait, 10,000,444 has three 4s. If we add a 4 in the fifth position, making it 10,004,444, which is still eight digits with four 4s. But 10,004,444 is larger than 10,000,444, but 10,000,444 only has three 4s.Wait, so perhaps 10,004,444 is the minimal. Alternatively, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a way to replace a different 0 with a 4 so that the number is smaller. For example, replacing the sixth digit instead of the fifth. Let&#39;s see: 10,000,444. If we replace the sixth digit (0) with a 4, we get 10,000,544? Wait, no. Wait, the digits are 1,0,0,0,0,4,4,4. If we replace the sixth digit (which is 0) with a 4, we get 1,0,0,0,0,4,4,4. Wait, but that&#39;s already the same as before. Wait, no. Wait, the original number is 10,000,444. Replacing the fifth digit (which is 0) with a 4 gives 10,004,444. If we replace the fourth digit (0) with a 4, we get 10,004,044. Wait, but 10,004,044 is eight digits: 1,0,0,4,0,4,4. Wait, no, that&#39;s only seven digits after the first 1. Wait, no. Wait, 10,004,044 is eight digits: 1,0,0,4,0,4,0,4. So that has three 4s. Not enough.Alternatively, replacing the third digit (0) with a 4: 10,040,044. That&#39;s 1,0,0,4,0,0,4,4. That&#39;s three 4s. Not enough.Alternatively, replacing the second digit (0) with a 4: 14,000,444. That&#39;s 1,4,0,0,0,4,4,4. Four 4s. But this number is 14,000,444, which is larger than 10,004,444. So that&#39;s worse.So replacing earlier digits with 4s makes the number larger. Therefore, the minimal number is 10,004,444.But wait, let&#39;s confirm. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a number with four 4s that&#39;s smaller than 10,004,444. For example, 10,001,444. Wait, that has three 4s. 10,002,444. Also three. 10,003,444. Three. 10,004,144. Four 4s. Let&#39;s check: 1,0,0,0,4,1,4,4. So positions 5,7,8: three 4s. Wait, no. Wait, the fifth digit is 4, seventh is 4, eighth is 4. So three 4s. Not enough.Wait, if we have 10,004,144, that&#39;s three 4s. If we have 10,004,414, that&#39;s three 4s. 10,004,441, three 4s. To get four 4s, we need another 4. So 10,004,444 is the only way.Alternatively, if we have 10,004,404. That&#39;s three 4s. 10,004,440. Three 4s. So no.Alternatively, 10,004,444 is the only eight-digit number starting with 1, followed by three 0s, then four 4s. So that seems to be the minimal.Wait, but what if there&#39;s a number starting with 1, followed by two 0s, a 4, and then other digits with three more 4s. For example, 1,0,0,4,0,4,4,4. Which is 10,040,444. But as we saw earlier, this is larger than 10,004,444.Alternatively, 1,0,4,0,0,4,4,4: 10,400,444. Which is larger. So yes, 10,004,444 is smaller.Alternatively, 1,0,0,0,4,4,4,4. So 10,004,444.Alternatively, is there a way to have a number with four 4s where some digits after the first few are lower than 4, but still maintaining four 4s? For example, 10,001,444. But that only has three 4s. To get four 4s, we need another 4. So maybe 10,001,444. But no, that&#39;s three. So maybe 10,001,444. If we add another 4, like 10,001,4444, but that&#39;s nine digits. So invalid.Alternatively, 10,004,444 is the smallest. Let me check another approach. Let&#39;s think of it as the minimal number is composed of the minimal possible digits from left to right, with exactly four 4s. So, the strategy is to place the 4s as far to the right as possible.So starting from the left, set each digit to the smallest possible (starting with 1, then 0s) until we need to place the 4s. Since we need four 4s, once we have set the first four digits to 1 followed by three 0s (total four digits), we have four remaining digits. If we set those remaining digits to 4s, we get 10004444. But wait, the first four digits are 1,0,0,0, then four 4s. That&#39;s correct.But actually, the total number of digits is eight. So after the first digit (1), we have seven digits left. We need four 4s. So to minimize the number, we should place as many 0s as possible before placing the 4s. So the earliest we can place the 4s is after the maximum number of 0s.So the number would be 1 followed by as many 0s as possible, then the remaining digits as 4s. So how many 0s can we place? We need to have four 4s. So the total digits after the first digit are seven. If we use three 0s, then the remaining four digits must be 4s. So that gives 1,0,0,0,4,4,4,4: 10004444. If we use more than three 0s, say four 0s, then we have only three digits left, which would need to be 4s, but that gives only three 4s, which is insufficient. So the maximum number of 0s we can place after the first digit is three, leaving four digits to be 4s. Therefore, 10004444 is indeed the minimal number.But let me just confirm once more. Suppose we try to place some non-4 digits after the 4s. For example, 10004440. But that only has three 4s. If we add another 4, we get 10004444. Alternatively, if we place a non-4 digit somewhere else but add a 4. For example, 10004434. But that has three 4s. So unless we replace another 0 with a 4, which would make the number larger.Alternatively, if we have 10004444, that&#39;s four 4s and the rest 0s and 1. So yes, this seems to be the minimal.Therefore, after considering various possibilities and ensuring that placing 4s earlier increases the number&#39;s value, while keeping the leftmost digits as small as possible, the conclusion is that 10004444 is the smallest eight-digit number with exactly four 4s.Final AnswerThe smallest eight-digit positive integer with exactly four digits that are 4 is boxed{10004444}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest eight-digit positive integer that has exactly four digits which are 4, we need to balance minimizing the leftmost digits while ensuring exactly four 4s. 1. An eight-digit number must start with a non-zero digit, so the first digit is 1.2. The remaining digits should be as small as possible (preferably 0s) to keep the number minimal.3. We need to place four 4s in the number. Placing 4s in the rightmost positions ensures the number remains as small as possible.Starting with the smallest possible number structure:- The first digit is 1.- The next three digits are 0s to keep the number small.- The remaining four digits are 4s to meet the requirement of exactly four 4s.This results in the number 10004444. Checking other configurations where 4s are placed earlier or with non-4 digits after them results in larger numbers. Therefore, the smallest eight-digit number with exactly four 4s is:[boxed{10004444}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8520547b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>🔑:</span>The smallest eight-digit number is 10000000 .The smallest 10000 eight-digit numbers are those of the form 1000 a b c d where a, b, c, and d are digits.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that when dealing with expressions involving variables constrained by a condition like x² + y² + z² = 1, methods like Lagrange multipliers might be useful. But since the problem mentions that x, y, z are positive, maybe there&#39;s a way to apply inequalities like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz. Let me explore both approaches.Starting with AM-GM inequality. The expression S has three terms, each of which is a product of two variables divided by the third. So each term is of the form (ab)/c where a, b, c are x, y, z in some order. Maybe I can apply AM-GM to these three terms. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. So, if I take the three terms (xy)/z, (yz)/x, (zx)/y, then:AM ≥ GM ⇒ [(xy/z + yz/x + zx/y)/3] ≥ ( (xy/z)(yz/x)(zx/y) )^(1/3)Let me compute the right-hand side. Multiply the three terms:(xy/z) * (yz/x) * (zx/y) = (xy * yz * zx) / (z * x * y) = (x^2 y^2 z^2) / (xyz) ) = xyz.Wait, that simplifies to xyz. So the geometric mean is (xyz)^(1/3). Therefore, the inequality gives:S/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3)But this tells me that S ≥ 3*(xyz)^(1/3). Hmm, but how does that help me find the minimum of S? Because xyz can vary, right? If xyz is larger, then S is larger, but if xyz is smaller, S is smaller. But since x, y, z are constrained by x² + y² + z² =1, there must be a relationship between their product and their squares.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider another inequality. Let&#39;s think about Cauchy-Schwarz. But Cauchy-Schwarz usually involves two vectors, and here I have three terms. Maybe I can use Hölder&#39;s inequality, which is a generalization.Hölder&#39;s inequality states that for positive real numbers a_i, b_i, c_i, and exponents p, q, r such that 1/p + 1/q +1/r =1, then the product sum is less than or equal to the product of the L^p, L^q, L^r norms. Not sure if that&#39;s directly applicable here.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz in the following way. Let&#39;s consider S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y. Maybe I can write S as (x^2 y^2)/(xyz) + (y^2 z^2)/(xyz) + (z^2 x^2)/(xyz) = (x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2)/(xyz). Wait, is that correct?Wait, let me check: (xy)/z = (x y)/z, and if I multiply numerator and denominator by xyz, I get (x y * xyz)/z * xyz? Hmm, maybe that&#39;s not the right approach.Wait, actually, (xy)/z = x y / z. Similarly for the others. So S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y. If I factor out 1/(xyz), perhaps? Let me see:Multiply numerator and denominator by xyz. Wait, S can be written as:[ (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 ] / xyz.Because:(xy)/z = (xy * xyz)/z * 1/xyz = x^2 y^2 * z / xyz = x y. Wait, no, this seems confusing. Let me do it properly.If I have (xy)/z, to write this over a common denominator xyz, it&#39;s (xy)/z = (x^2 y^2)/xyz. Wait, no. Let me think again.Suppose I let each term (xy)/z be multiplied by (xyz)/(xyz) =1. Then:(xy)/z = (xy * xyz)/z * 1/xyz = (x^2 y^2 z)/xyz = x y.Wait, that just gives me back the original term. That approach isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, perhaps consider each term:(xy)/z = x * y / z, and similarly for others. Maybe group variables. Let&#39;s see:Let me denote a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x. But this might complicate things.Alternatively, maybe homogenize the expression. Since we have the constraint x² + y² + z² =1, perhaps express S in terms of that.Let me consider squaring S to see if that helps. But S is a sum of terms, so squaring would lead to cross terms. Hmm.Alternatively, use substitution variables. Let me set a = x^2, b = y^2, c = z^2. Since x, y, z are positive, a, b, c are positive as well, and the constraint becomes a + b + c =1.Then, S can be rewritten in terms of a, b, c. Let&#39;s see:x = sqrt(a), y = sqrt(b), z = sqrt(c). Then:(xy)/z = (sqrt(a) * sqrt(b))/sqrt(c) = sqrt(ab)/sqrt(c) = sqrt(ab/c).Similarly, the other terms:(yz)/x = sqrt(bc)/sqrt(a) = sqrt(bc/a),(zx)/y = sqrt(ac)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(ac/b).Therefore, S = sqrt(ab/c) + sqrt(bc/a) + sqrt(ac/b).Hmm, this looks a bit more symmetric. Maybe easier to handle now. So we need to minimize sqrt(ab/c) + sqrt(bc/a) + sqrt(ac/b) under the condition a + b + c =1, with a, b, c &gt;0.Alternatively, square S to make it more manageable. Let&#39;s compute S²:[ sqrt(ab/c) + sqrt(bc/a) + sqrt(ac/b) ]²= ab/c + bc/a + ac/b + 2[ sqrt(ab/c * bc/a) + sqrt(ab/c * ac/b) + sqrt(bc/a * ac/b) ]Simplify each term:First, the squared terms:ab/c + bc/a + ac/bNow, cross terms:sqrt(ab/c * bc/a) = sqrt( (ab * bc) / (c * a) ) = sqrt( (b² c) / c ) = sqrt(b²) = bSimilarly, sqrt(ab/c * ac/b) = sqrt( (ab * ac) / (c * b) ) = sqrt( a² c / c ) = sqrt(a²) = aAnd sqrt(bc/a * ac/b) = sqrt( (bc * ac) / (a * b) ) = sqrt( c² a / a ) = sqrt(c²) = cTherefore, S² = ab/c + bc/a + ac/b + 2(a + b + c)But since a + b + c =1, this simplifies to:S² = ab/c + bc/a + ac/b + 2*1 = ab/c + bc/a + ac/b + 2So now, we need to minimize S, which is equivalent to minimizing S² since S is positive. Therefore, we can focus on minimizing ab/c + bc/a + ac/b.Let me denote T = ab/c + bc/a + ac/b. So we need to minimize T, given that a + b + c =1, and a, b, c &gt;0.Hmm, how to minimize T? Maybe use AM-GM on each term of T.Each term in T is of the form ab/c. Let me think. Let&#39;s consider the three terms ab/c, bc/a, ac/b. Maybe apply AM-GM:(ab/c + bc/a + ac/b)/3 ≥ ( (ab/c)(bc/a)(ac/b) )^(1/3)Compute the product inside the cube root:(ab/c)(bc/a)(ac/b) = (ab * bc * ac) / (c * a * b) ) = (a^2 b^2 c^2)/(a b c) ) = a b c.Therefore, AM ≥ GM implies:T/3 ≥ (a b c)^(1/3)So T ≥ 3 (a b c)^(1/3)But again, this relates T to the geometric mean of a, b, c, but we need a lower bound. Since a + b + c =1, by AM-GM, (a + b + c)/3 ≥ (a b c)^(1/3), so (1)/3 ≥ (a b c)^(1/3), which implies a b c ≤ (1/3)^3 = 1/27. Therefore, (a b c)^(1/3) ≤ 1/3. Hence, T ≥ 3*(a b c)^(1/3) ≥ 3*(something ≤1/3). Wait, but this gives T ≥ 3*(something up to 1/3), so T ≥ up to 1. But this seems not helpful, because the lower bound is not fixed.Alternatively, maybe we need to use Cauchy-Schwarz on T.Let me write T as ab/c + bc/a + ac/b. Let&#39;s consider each term:ab/c = (a b)/c. Similarly for others. Maybe we can consider variables such that terms can be grouped. Alternatively, use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:(ab/c + bc/a + ac/b)(c + a + b) ≥ (sqrt(ab) + sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac))²But since a + b + c =1, this gives T *1 ≥ (sqrt(ab) + sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac))²But then what? Let me compute the right-hand side:sqrt(ab) + sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac) ≤ ?Again, by AM-GM, sqrt(ab) ≤ (a + b)/2, similarly for others. So sqrt(ab) + sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac) ≤ (a + b)/2 + (b + c)/2 + (a + c)/2 = (2a + 2b + 2c)/2 = a + b + c =1. Therefore, the RHS is ≤1²=1. Therefore, T ≥ (something)², but this gives T ≥ (sqrt(ab) + sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac))². But if sqrt(ab) + sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac) ≤1, then T ≥ (something ≤1)^2 ≤1. But this seems to not help in finding a lower bound for T.Alternatively, maybe try substitution. Let me assume that a = b = c. If a = b = c, then since a + b + c =1, each is 1/3. Then, compute T:ab/c = (1/3)(1/3)/(1/3) =1/3. Similarly, each term is 1/3, so T=1. Therefore, in this case, S² = T + 2 =1 + 2=3, so S=√3. But is this the minimum? Wait, when a = b = c =1/3, then x = y = z = sqrt(1/3). Then, let&#39;s compute S:(xy)/z = ( (sqrt(1/3))^2 ) / sqrt(1/3) )= (1/3)/(1/√3) )= (1/3)*√3 = √3/3. Similarly, each term is √3/3, so S = 3*(√3/3) = √3. So that checks out. But is this the minimum?Wait, the question is to find the minimum value of S. If when a, b, c are equal, S=√3. But maybe there&#39;s a lower value. Let me test with some other values.Suppose I take a different set. Let me try a =1/2, b=1/2, c=0. But c must be positive, so let&#39;s take c approaching 0. Then, T = ab/c + bc/a + ac/b. If c approaches 0, then ab/c = (1/2 *1/2)/c =1/(4c), which tends to infinity. So T tends to infinity. Therefore, as c approaches 0, S tends to infinity. So making one variable very small increases S.What if we set two variables equal and the third different. Let&#39;s say a = b, and c =1 - 2a. Let&#39;s set a = b, so c=1 -2a. Then, T = ab/c + bc/a + ac/b = a²/(1 - 2a) + (a(1 - 2a))/a + (a(1 - 2a))/a. Wait, compute each term:First term: ab/c = a² / (1 - 2a)Second term: bc/a = a*(1 - 2a)/a = (1 - 2a)Third term: ac/b = a*(1 - 2a)/a = (1 - 2a)Therefore, T = a²/(1 - 2a) + (1 - 2a) + (1 - 2a) = a²/(1 - 2a) + 2(1 - 2a)So T = a²/(1 - 2a) + 2 -4aLet me set t = a, so 0 &lt; t &lt;1/2 (since c=1-2t must be positive). Let&#39;s compute T(t) = t²/(1 - 2t) + 2 -4tWe can take derivative of T with respect to t and find minimum.Compute derivative:dT/dt = [ (2t)(1 -2t) - t²*(-2) ] / (1 -2t)^2 -4= [ 2t(1 -2t) + 2t² ] / (1 -2t)^2 -4Simplify numerator:2t -4t² +2t² = 2t -2t² = 2t(1 - t)Therefore, dT/dt = [2t(1 - t)] / (1 -2t)^2 -4Set derivative to zero:[2t(1 - t)] / (1 -2t)^2 -4 =0So [2t(1 - t)] / (1 -2t)^2 =4Multiply both sides by (1 -2t)^2:2t(1 -t) =4(1 -2t)^2Expand RHS:4(1 -4t +4t²)So:2t -2t² =4 -16t +16t²Bring all terms to left side:2t -2t² -4 +16t -16t²=0Combine like terms:(2t +16t) + (-2t² -16t²) -4=018t -18t² -4=0Divide both sides by 2:9t -9t² -2=0Multiply by -1:9t² -9t +2=0Solve quadratic equation:t = [9 ± sqrt(81 -72)] /18 = [9 ± sqrt(9)]/18 = [9 ±3]/18Thus t=(12)/18=2/3 or t=(6)/18=1/3But t must be less than1/2, so t=1/3 is possible? Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.333, which is less than1/2=0.5, so okay. t=2/3 is more than1/2, so discard.Thus critical point at t=1/3. Let&#39;s check T at t=1/3.T(1/3)= ( (1/3)^2 )/(1 - 2*(1/3)) +2 -4*(1/3)Compute denominator:1 -2/3=1/3Thus first term: (1/9)/(1/3)= (1/9)*(3/1)=1/3Second term:2 -4/3=2/3Therefore, T=1/3 +2/3=1. So T=1. So at t=1/3, T=1. But when a=b=1/3, c=1 -2*(1/3)=1 -2/3=1/3. So a=b=c=1/3, which is the symmetric case. Therefore, this critical point is actually the symmetric case, giving T=1.Therefore, when we set two variables equal and the third different, the minimum is still at the symmetric point. So maybe the minimum of T is 1, achieved when a=b=c=1/3, leading to S²=1 +2=3, so S=√3≈1.732. But is this the minimum?Wait, let me check another case. Suppose we set variables such that one is larger and others smaller. For example, let’s take a=0.5, b=0.5, but then c=0, which is invalid. But take a=0.4, b=0.4, c=0.2. Then compute T:ab/c =0.4*0.4 /0.2=0.16/0.2=0.8bc/a=0.4*0.2 /0.4=0.08/0.4=0.2ac/b=0.4*0.2 /0.4=0.08/0.4=0.2So T=0.8+0.2+0.2=1.2. Which is larger than 1.If I take a=0.25, b=0.25, c=0.5:ab/c=0.0625/0.5=0.125bc/a=0.25*0.5/0.25=0.5ac/b=0.25*0.5/0.25=0.5T=0.125+0.5+0.5=1.125. Still larger than1.Alternatively, take a=0.6, b=0.2, c=0.2:ab/c=0.12/0.2=0.6bc/a=0.04/0.6≈0.0667ac/b=0.12/0.2=0.6T≈0.6+0.0667+0.6≈1.2667&gt;1.Alternatively, take a=0.1, b=0.1, c=0.8:ab/c=0.01/0.8=0.0125bc/a=0.08/0.1=0.8ac/b=0.08/0.1=0.8T≈0.0125+0.8+0.8≈1.6125&gt;1.So all these trials give T≥1, with equality only at the symmetric point. So perhaps T&#39;s minimum is 1, leading to S=√3. But wait, in the problem statement, are we supposed to find the minimum value of S? If S=√3≈1.732, but is this indeed the minimum?Wait, let&#39;s think again. Suppose that the variables are not all equal. Maybe there is a configuration where S is smaller. Let&#39;s try with x=1, y=1, z=0. But z must be positive. Let’s take z approaching 0. Then S=(xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y. As z approaches 0, (xy)/z approaches infinity, so S tends to infinity. Similarly, if one variable approaches zero, S becomes large. So minimum must occur somewhere where all variables are bounded away from zero.Alternatively, maybe consider another substitution. Let’s set u = x/y, v = y/z, w = z/x. But this might lead to cyclic dependencies.Alternatively, use Lagrange multipliers. Let me try that.We need to minimize S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y, given that x² + y² + z² =1.Set up the Lagrangian: L = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y - λ(x² + y² + z² -1)Take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and set them to zero.Compute ∂L/∂x:First term: d/dx [ (xy)/z ] = y/zSecond term: d/dx [ (yz)/x ] = -yz/x²Third term: d/dx [ (zx)/y ] = z/yFourth term: d/dx [ -λ(x² + y² + z² -1) ] = -2λxThus:∂L/∂x = y/z - yz/x² + z/y -2λx =0Similarly, compute ∂L/∂y:First term: d/dy [ (xy)/z ] = x/zSecond term: d/dy [ (yz)/x ] = z/xThird term: d/dy [ (zx)/y ] = -zx/y²Fourth term: -2λyThus:∂L/∂y = x/z + z/x - zx/y² -2λy =0Similarly, ∂L/∂z:First term: d/dz [ (xy)/z ] = -xy/z²Second term: d/dz [ (yz)/x ] = y/xThird term: d/dz [ (zx)/y ] = x/yFourth term: -2λzThus:∂L/∂z = -xy/z² + y/x + x/y -2λz =0So now, we have three equations:1. y/z - yz/x² + z/y -2λx =02. x/z + z/x - zx/y² -2λy =03. -xy/z² + y/x + x/y -2λz =0And the constraint x² + y² + z² =1.This system looks quite complicated, but maybe we can assume symmetry here. Suppose that x = y = z. Then, since x² + y² + z² =1, we have 3x²=1 ⇒ x=1/√3. Then, let&#39;s check if this satisfies the partial derivatives.Compute each derivative at x=y=z=1/√3:First, compute ∂L/∂x:y/z - yz/x² + z/y -2λxSince x=y=z, substitute:1 -1 +1 -2λx =1 -1 +1 -2λx=1 -2λxSet to zero: 1 -2λx=0 ⇒ λ=1/(2x)Similarly for ∂L/∂y and ∂L/∂z, same result. So indeed, if x=y=z=1/√3, then the partial derivatives will be zero with λ=1/(2x)=√3/2. So this is a critical point. Now, we need to check if this is a minimum.But is this the only critical point? If there&#39;s another critical point where x≠y≠z, then maybe the minimum is lower. But given the symmetry and the earlier trials, maybe not. Let&#39;s check for another possible symmetric case, like two variables equal and the third different.Assume x = y ≠ z. Let’s set x = y, so we have 2x² + z²=1. Let&#39;s try to see if the partial derivatives can be equal.Compute ∂L/∂x and ∂L/∂y. If x=y, then maybe ∂L/∂x = ∂L/∂y, but let&#39;s see.First, compute ∂L/∂x when x=y:From earlier, ∂L/∂x = y/z - yz/x² + z/y -2λxBut x=y, so:= x/z - xz/x² + z/x -2λx= x/z - z/x + z/x -2λx= x/z -2λxSimilarly, ∂L/∂y = x/z + z/x - zx/y² -2λy. Since x=y, this becomes:x/z + z/x - zx/x² -2λx= x/z + z/x - z/x -2λx= x/z -2λxSo ∂L/∂x = ∂L/∂y when x=y, as expected.Now, set ∂L/∂x =0 ⇒ x/z -2λx=0. If x ≠0, then:1/z -2λ=0 ⇒ λ=1/(2z)Similarly, compute ∂L/∂z:-xy/z² + y/x + x/y -2λzSince x=y, this becomes:-x²/z² +1 +1 -2λz= -x²/z² +2 -2λzSet this to zero:-x²/z² +2 -2λz=0But from ∂L/∂x=0, we have λ=1/(2z). Substitute λ:-x²/z² +2 -2*(1/(2z))*z= -x²/z² +2 -1= -x²/z² +1=0 ⇒ -x²/z² +1=0 ⇒ x²=z² ⇒x=z (since x,z&gt;0)But x=z and x=y implies x=y=z. Hence, even in the case where we assume two variables are equal, the only critical point is when all three are equal. Therefore, the only critical point under symmetry considerations is x=y=z=1/√3, which gives S=√3.Thus, based on both the Lagrange multiplier method and testing various points, it seems that the minimum value of S is √3. But wait, earlier when I used the substitution a,b,c and found T=1 leading to S=√3, but the problem says &quot;try to find the minimum value&quot;, and the answer seems to be √3. But let me check once again.Wait, actually, there&#39;s a mistake here. When I substituted variables as a=x², b=y², c=z², then S became sqrt(ab/c) + sqrt(bc/a) + sqrt(ac/b). Then, when I squared S, I got S² = T +2, where T=ab/c + bc/a + ac/b. Then, I found that T is minimized at1, leading to S=√3. However, when I used Lagrange multipliers, I found that x=y=z=1/√3 gives S=√3. So both methods agree. However, the problem says &quot;try to find the minimum value&quot;, so the answer should be √3.But wait, let me verify with another approach. Let me consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the original expression.Let’s write S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y. Let’s consider the vectors (xy, yz, zx) and (1/z, 1/x, 1/y). Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz:[ (xy/z + yz/x + zx/y ) ]^2 ≤ (x²y² + y²z² + z²x²)(1/z² +1/x² +1/y² )But this is an upper bound, but we need a lower bound. So this might not help.Alternatively, use Cauchy-Schwarz in a different form. Let me consider:S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/yLet me multiply numerator and denominator by z, x, y respectively to homogenize. Wait, the constraint is x² + y² + z²=1. Let me homogenize S by multiplying by (x² + y² + z²)^k such that the expression becomes homogeneous. Let&#39;s check the degrees.Original S has terms of degree (1+1 -1)=1 (since xy/z is x^1 y^1 z^{-1}), so each term is degree 1. The constraint x² + y² + z²=1 is degree 2. To homogenize S, we can write S as:S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y = (x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2 ) / (xyz )Wait, no:Wait, (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y = [x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2]/(xyz). Wait, how?Wait, actually, to add fractions:(xy)/z = (x^2 y^2)/ (xyz),Wait, no. Let me check:If you have (xy)/z = (xy * xyz)/z * (1/xyz) = (x^2 y^2 z)/ (xyz) = xy. No, this isn&#39;t correct. Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.Alternatively, homogenize S by multiplying by (x² + y² + z²)^{1/2}, but since x² + y² + z²=1, it might not help. Alternatively, use Hölder&#39;s inequality.Hölder&#39;s inequality states that (a1 b1 c1 + a2 b2 c2 + ... + an bn cn) ≤ (a1^p + a2^p + ... + an^p)^{1/p} (b1^q + ...)^{1/q} (c1^r + ...)^{1/r}} where 1/p +1/q +1/r=1.But in our case, S is a sum of three terms, each being (xy)/z. Let me try to apply Hölder&#39;s inequality for three terms.Wait, Hölder&#39;s in the form (sum a_i b_i) ≤ (sum a_i^p)^{1/p} (sum b_i^q)^{1/q}, but here we have three terms, each of which is a product. Maybe using Hölder&#39;s with exponents 3, 3, 3?Wait, perhaps think of S as sum_{cyc} (xy)/z. Let&#39;s consider each term (xy)/z. Let me raise both sides to some power.Alternatively, use AM-GM on the terms with the constraint.Let me consider the following approach. Since x² + y² + z²=1, let&#39;s denote t = xy + yz + zx. Then, we know that t ≤ x² + y² + z²=1 by Cauchy-Schwarz, but not sure.Alternatively, relate S to t. Since S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y. If I can express this in terms of t and other variables.Alternatively, use AM-GM on S and the constraint.Wait, another idea: Let me apply AM-GM to each term of S and the variables. For example:For each term (xy)/z, multiply by z². Then:(xy)/z * z² = xyz.So, S = (xyz)(1/z² +1/x² +1/y² )Wait, no. Let me explain:If I have (xy)/z = xyz * (1/z²). Similarly, (yz)/x = xyz*(1/x²), (zx)/y = xyz*(1/y²). Therefore, S = xyz (1/x² +1/y² +1/z² )So S = xyz (1/x² +1/y² +1/z² ) = xyz ( (y² z² + x² z² +x² y² ) / x² y² z² ) ) = (x y z ) ( (x² y² + y² z² + z² x² ) ) / (x² y² z² ) ) = (x² y² + y² z² + z² x² ) / (x y z )Therefore, S = (x² y² + y² z² + z² x² ) / (x y z )So we have S = (x² y² + y² z² + z² x² ) / (x y z )But this is the same expression I had earlier. So maybe now use AM-GM on the numerator and denominator.The numerator is x² y² + y² z² + z² x². By AM-GM, this is ≥ 3 (x² y² * y² z² * z² x² )^{1/3} =3 (x^4 y^4 z^4 )^{1/3}=3 x^{4/3} y^{4/3} z^{4/3}But denominator is x y z. So S ≥3 x^{4/3} y^{4/3} z^{4/3} / (x y z )=3 x^{1/3} y^{1/3} z^{1/3}=3 (x y z )^{1/3}But again, we have S ≥3 (x y z )^{1/3}But from AM-GM on the constraint x² + y² + z²=1, we have:(x² + y² + z²)/3 ≥ (x² y² z² )^{1/3} ⇒1/3 ≥(x² y² z² )^{1/3} ⇒ (x y z )^{2/3} ≤1/3 ⇒ (x y z )^{1/3} ≤1/√3Therefore, S ≥3*(1/√3)=√3Thus, by AM-GM, we have S ≥√3, with equality when x² y² = y² z² = z² x² and x² + y² + z²=1. The equality in AM-GM occurs when x² y² = y² z² = z² x² ⇒x= y= z. Hence, equality occurs when x=y=z=1/√3, leading to S=√3. Therefore, the minimum value of S is √3.Therefore, after multiple approaches—using substitution, Lagrange multipliers, AM-GM inequalities—it&#39;s confirmed that the minimal value of S is √3 when x=y=z=1/√3.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( S ) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given positive numbers (x, y, z) such that (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1), we need to find the minimum value of the expression (S = frac{xy}{z} + frac{yz}{x} + frac{zx}{y}).First, we use the AM-GM inequality on the terms of (S):[frac{frac{xy}{z} + frac{yz}{x} + frac{zx}{y}}{3} geq sqrt[3]{frac{xy}{z} cdot frac{yz}{x} cdot frac{zx}{y}}]Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:[sqrt[3]{frac{xy}{z} cdot frac{yz}{x} cdot frac{zx}{y}} = sqrt[3]{xyz}]Thus,[frac{S}{3} geq sqrt[3]{xyz} implies S geq 3sqrt[3]{xyz}]Next, we relate (xyz) to the given constraint (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1). Using the AM-GM inequality on (x^2, y^2, z^2):[frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{3} geq sqrt[3]{x^2y^2z^2} implies frac{1}{3} geq sqrt[3]{x^2y^2z^2} implies frac{1}{3} geq (xyz)^{2/3} implies (xyz)^{1/3} leq frac{1}{sqrt{3}}]Substituting this back into the inequality for (S):[S geq 3 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3}]To check if this bound is achievable, we consider the case when (x = y = z). Given (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1), we have (3x^2 = 1 implies x = y = z = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}). Substituting these values into (S):[S = frac{left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)}{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} + frac{left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)}{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} + frac{left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)}{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} = 3 cdot frac{frac{1}{3}}{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} = 3 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3}]Thus, the minimum value of (S) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y, given that x, y, z are positive numbers and x² + y² + z² = 1. Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem. First, all variables are positive, which is good because it means I don&#39;t have to worry about negative values complicating the expressions. The constraint is x² + y² + z² = 1, which is the equation of a unit sphere in three dimensions. The expression S involves cyclic permutations of the variables, each term being the product of two variables divided by the third. Since we’re dealing with a constrained optimization problem, my first thought is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers. That usually works for such problems where you have a function to optimize subject to a constraint. Let me recall how Lagrange multipliers work. If I have a function f(x, y, z) to minimize (or maximize) subject to a constraint g(x, y, z) = 0, then I can set up the equations ∇f = λ∇g, where λ is the Lagrange multiplier. So, I need to compute the gradients of S and the constraint function.Let me denote the constraint function as g(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z² - 1 = 0. Then, the gradients:First, compute the partial derivatives of S with respect to x, y, z.Let&#39;s compute ∂S/∂x:The terms in S are (xy)/z, (yz)/x, (zx)/y. Derivative of (xy)/z with respect to x is y/z.Derivative of (yz)/x with respect to x is -yz/x².Derivative of (zx)/y with respect to x is z/y.So, ∂S/∂x = y/z - yz/x² + z/y.Similarly, ∂S/∂y:Derivative of (xy)/z with respect to y is x/z.Derivative of (yz)/x with respect to y is z/x.Derivative of (zx)/y with respect to y is -zx/y².Thus, ∂S/∂y = x/z + z/x - zx/y².And ∂S/∂z:Derivative of (xy)/z with respect to z is -xy/z².Derivative of (yz)/x with respect to z is y/x.Derivative of (zx)/y with respect to z is x/y.Thus, ∂S/∂z = -xy/z² + y/x + x/y.The gradient of the constraint function g is (2x, 2y, 2z).According to the method, we set ∇S = λ∇g. Therefore:y/z - yz/x² + z/y = 2λx  ...(1)x/z + z/x - zx/y² = 2λy  ...(2)-xy/z² + y/x + x/y = 2λz  ...(3)And the constraint equation x² + y² + z² = 1 ...(4)Hmm, solving these equations seems quite complicated. Let me see if there&#39;s symmetry here. The problem is symmetric in x, y, z in some cyclic way. Maybe we can assume that x = y = z. Let&#39;s check if that gives a solution.If x = y = z, then from the constraint, 3x² = 1 =&gt; x = y = z = 1/√3.Then, compute S:Each term (xy)/z = (x²)/x = x, so each term is x, so total S = 3x = 3*(1/√3) = √3 ≈ 1.732.But is this the minimum? Maybe not. Let me check if unequal variables can give a smaller S.Alternatively, perhaps the minimum occurs when two variables are equal and the third is different. Let me suppose that x = y ≠ z. Then, let&#39;s see if we can find such a solution.Let’s set x = y. Then, the constraint becomes 2x² + z² = 1. Let’s denote x = y, so variables are x, x, z.Compute S in terms of x and z:S = (x*x)/z + (x*z)/x + (z*x)/x = x²/z + z + z = x²/z + 2z.So, S = x²/z + 2z.But since 2x² + z² = 1, we can express x² = (1 - z²)/2. Therefore, S becomes [(1 - z²)/2]/z + 2z = (1 - z²)/(2z) + 2z.Let me simplify that:(1/(2z) - z/2) + 2z = 1/(2z) - z/2 + 2z = 1/(2z) + (3z)/2.So, S = 1/(2z) + (3z)/2. Now, to find the minimum of S with respect to z. Since z is positive and from the constraint 2x² + z² = 1, z must be less than or equal to 1 (since z² &lt;=1). Also, x² must be positive, so z² &lt;1 =&gt; z &lt;1. So z is in (0,1).Take derivative of S with respect to z:dS/dz = -1/(2z²) + 3/2.Set derivative to zero:-1/(2z²) + 3/2 = 0 =&gt; 3/2 = 1/(2z²) =&gt; Multiply both sides by 2z²:3z² = 1 =&gt; z² = 1/3 =&gt; z = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577.So, then z = 1/√3, and x² = (1 - 1/3)/2 = (2/3)/2 = 1/3. So x = y = 1/√3. Therefore, this reduces back to the case where x = y = z. Therefore, even when we assume x = y, the minimum occurs when all variables are equal. So maybe the minimal S is indeed √3?Wait, but wait. Let me check with another approach. Maybe using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.Looking at S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y. Let me see if I can apply AM-GM here. The terms are (xy)/z, (yz)/x, (zx)/y. Let&#39;s compute the product of these three terms:[(xy)/z] * [(yz)/x] * [(zx)/y] = (xy * yz * zx) / (z * x * y) )= (x² y² z²) / (xyz) ) = xyz.So, the product of the terms is xyz. But AM ≥ GM tells us that (a + b + c)/3 ≥ (abc)^(1/3). So, S/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3). But this gives S ≥ 3 (xyz)^(1/3). Hmm, not sure if helpful yet.Alternatively, maybe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality? Let me consider the terms. Let me denote a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think of S as a sum of terms each of which is a product of two variables divided by the third. So, S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y. Let me rewrite each term as x/y * y/z * z/x but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps homogenize the expression using the constraint.Since x² + y² + z² =1, we can express S in terms of variables normalized by this constraint. Let me see. Homogenization involves scaling variables so that the constraint is absorbed into the expression. Let me consider scaling variables such that x² + y² + z² =1. Then, S is given as above.Alternatively, using Hölder&#39;s inequality. Hölder&#39;s inequality states that for positive real numbers, (a1^p + a2^p + ... + an^p)^(1/p) * (b1^q + b2^q + ... + bn^q)^(1/q) ≥ a1b1 + a2b2 + ... + anbn, where 1/p +1/q =1. Not sure if directly applicable here.Alternatively, maybe consider squaring S and applying Cauchy-Schwarz. Let me compute S^2:S² = [(xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y]^2.Expanding this:= (xy/z)^2 + (yz/x)^2 + (zx/y)^2 + 2[(xy/z)(yz/x) + (xy/z)(zx/y) + (yz/x)(zx/y)].Simplify each term:First, (xy/z)^2 = x² y² / z²,Similarly, (yz/x)^2 = y² z² / x²,(zx/y)^2 = z² x² / y².The cross terms:(xy/z)(yz/x) = (xy * yz)/(z x) = y²,Similarly, (xy/z)(zx/y) = (xy * zx)/(z y) = x²,(yz/x)(zx/y) = (yz * zx)/(x y) = z².Therefore, S² = (x² y² / z² + y² z² / x² + z² x² / y²) + 2(y² + x² + z²).But since x² + y² + z² =1, the cross terms sum up to 2*1=2. So, S² = (x² y² / z² + y² z² / x² + z² x² / y²) + 2.Now, we need to find the minimum of S, so we need to minimize S² as well. The first three terms in S² are similar to the terms in the AM-GM inequality. Let me denote A = x² y² / z², B = y² z² / x², C = z² x² / y². Then, by AM-GM inequality, (A + B + C)/3 ≥ (A B C)^(1/3). Let&#39;s compute A B C:A*B*C = (x² y² / z²)(y² z² / x²)(z² x² / y²) = (x² y² z²)^2 / (x² y² z²) )= x² y² z².Therefore, (A + B + C)/3 ≥ (x² y² z²)^(1/3).Hence, A + B + C ≥ 3 (x² y² z²)^(1/3).But then, S² = A + B + C + 2 ≥ 3 (x² y² z²)^(1/3) + 2.But I don&#39;t know how this helps. Maybe we need another relation between x² y² z² and the given constraint. Alternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers again but with more substitution.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that if x = y = z, then x² + y² + z² = 3x² =1, so x=1/√3. Then S = 3*(x^2)/x = 3x = √3 ≈1.732. But maybe there&#39;s a lower S when variables are not equal. Let me test some numerical examples.Suppose x is very small, approaching 0. Then, the terms (xy)/z and (zx)/y become small, but (yz)/x becomes large. Similarly, if one variable is small, one term in S becomes large. So, perhaps the minimal S occurs when variables are balanced, i.e., x=y=z. But let&#39;s test another case.Suppose x = y, but z different. Wait, we did that earlier and found that the minimum occurs at x=y=z. Alternatively, suppose two variables are equal, and the third is different but not going to extremes.Wait, let&#39;s take x = y = 1/2, then x² + y² = 1/4 +1/4=1/2, so z²=1 -1/2=1/2, z=√(1/2)=√2/2≈0.707. Then compute S:(xy)/z = (1/2 *1/2)/ (√2/2)= (1/4)/(√2/2)= (1/4)*(2/√2)=1/(2√2)≈0.353.(yz)/x = (1/2 * √2/2)/ (1/2)= (√2/4)/(1/2)= √2/2≈0.707.(zx)/y = same as (yz)/x, since x=y, so also √2/2≈0.707.Total S≈0.353+0.707+0.707≈1.767, which is larger than √3≈1.732. So, indeed, when variables are equal, S is smaller. Another test case: let x=0.6, y=0.6, then x²+y²=0.36+0.36=0.72, so z²=1 -0.72=0.28, z≈0.529.Compute S:(xy)/z = (0.6*0.6)/0.529≈0.36/0.529≈0.681.(yz)/x = (0.6*0.529)/0.6≈0.529.(zx)/y = same as above,≈0.529.Total S≈0.681 +0.529+0.529≈1.739, still slightly higher than √3≈1.732. Hmm, close but still higher. So maybe indeed x=y=z gives the minimal S. Alternatively, let&#39;s try another approach. Let me set t = x/y, s = y/z, r = z/x. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, use substitution variables. Let’s denote a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x. Then abc =1. Then, S = (xy)/z + (yz)/x + (zx)/y = x^2/(z a) + y^2/(x b) + z^2/(y c). Hmm, not sure if helpful. Alternatively, let&#39;s use substitution variables such that u = x^2, v = y^2, w = z^2. Then the constraint becomes u + v + w =1, and u, v, w &gt;0. Then, S = (sqrt(uv))/sqrt(w) + (sqrt(vw))/sqrt(u) + (sqrt(wu))/sqrt(v). Which simplifies to sqrt(uv/w) + sqrt(vw/u) + sqrt(wu/v). Hmm, so S = sqrt(u v / w) + sqrt(v w / u) + sqrt(w u / v). This expression is homogeneous of degree 0, since each term is sqrt( (u v)/w ) which is (u v w^{-1})^{1/2}, so degree (1 +1 -1)/2 = 1/2. But the sum would have degree 1/2, but since the constraint is u + v + w =1, maybe we can use scaling. Wait, but since we have u + v + w =1, perhaps we can proceed.Alternatively, let me set u = a^2, v = b^2, w = c^2. Then, the constraint is a^4 + b^4 + c^4 =1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe use Hölder&#39;s inequality. Wait, Hölder&#39;s inequality in the form (sum a_i b_i c_i) ≤ (sum a_i^p)^{1/p} (sum b_i^q)^{1/q} (sum c_i^r)^{1/r}} where 1/p +1/q +1/r =1. Maybe not directly applicable.Alternatively, let me consider S^2 again. Earlier, we found that S^2 = (x²y²/z² + y²z²/x² + z²x²/y²) + 2. Let me denote the terms as follows: Let’s let P = x²y²/z² + y²z²/x² + z²x²/y². So S² = P + 2. Therefore, to minimize S, we need to minimize P.So, if we can find the minimum of P, then we can find the minimum of S² and hence S.Let me attempt to find the minimum of P. Let me apply AM-GM on the three terms of P.By AM-GM, (x²y²/z² + y²z²/x² + z²x²/y²)/3 ≥ (x²y²/z² * y²z²/x² * z²x²/y²)^{1/3}.Compute the product inside the cube root:(x²y²/z²)(y²z²/x²)(z²x²/y²) = (x² y² z²)^2 / (x² y² z²) = x² y² z².Therefore, AM-GM gives P/3 ≥ (x² y² z²)^{1/3}, so P ≥ 3 (x² y² z²)^{1/3}.But we need to relate x² y² z² with the constraint x² + y² + z² =1. Let me denote t = (x² y² z²)^{1/3}. Then, by AM-GM, since x², y², z² are positive numbers, we have:(x² + y² + z²)/3 ≥ (x² y² z²)^{1/3} =&gt; 1/3 ≥ t, so t ≤1/3.Hence, P ≥ 3 t ≥ 3*(0) =0, but this gives a lower bound for P, but since t can be up to 1/3, but in our case, t is at most 1/3. Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, no, the AM-GM on x², y², z² gives that their geometric mean is ≤1/3. So t = (x² y² z²)^{1/3} ≤1/3, so P ≥ 3t. But since t ≤1/3, 3t ≤1. Therefore, this gives P ≥ 3t, but t ≤1/3. So, 3t ≤1. So, this line of reasoning might not help. Maybe we need another inequality.Alternatively, perhaps use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the terms of P. Let me see:Let’s consider P = x²y²/z² + y²z²/x² + z²x²/y². Let me apply Cauchy-Schwarz on these terms. For example, (x²y²/z² + y²z²/x² + z²x²/y²)(z² + x² + y²) ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2. Since (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(d^2 + e^2 + f^2) ≥ (ad + be + cf)^2. Let me take a = xy/z, b = yz/x, c = zx/y, and d = z, e = x, f = y. Then, the left side is P*(x² + y² + z²) = P*1 = P. The right side would be (xy/z * z + yz/x * x + zx/y * y)^2 = (xy + yz + zx)^2. Therefore, we have:P ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2.Therefore, S² = P + 2 ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2 + 2.But this might not be helpful directly. However, we know that (xy + yz + zx) ≤ x² + y² + z² =1, by Cauchy-Schwarz. Wait, actually, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx) ≤ 3(x² + y² + z²) =3. But that&#39;s not directly helpful. Wait, but (xy + yz + zx) can be at most 1 (since x² + y² + z² =1, and by Cauchy-Schwarz, xy + yz + zx ≤ x² + y² + z²). Wait, actually, no. For example, if x=y=z=1/√3, then xy + yz + zx =3*(1/√3)^2=1. So, the maximum of (xy + yz + zx) is1. So, (xy + yz + zx)^2 ≤1. Therefore, S² ≥1 +2=3, so S ≥√3. Wait, hold on! So we have P ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2. Then, since (xy + yz + zx)^2 ≤1, then P ≥ something that&#39;s ≤1. Wait, maybe I messed up. Let&#39;s see:From Cauchy-Schwarz: P*(x² + y² + z²) ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2. Therefore, since x² + y² + z²=1, we have P ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2. So, S² = P + 2 ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2 +2. But (xy + yz + zx) can be at most1, so (xy + yz + zx)^2 +2 ≤1 +2=3. Wait, but that&#39;s an upper bound. Wait, no, because S² ≥ (xy + yz + zx)^2 +2, but we need a lower bound for S². If (xy + yz + zx)^2 can be as small as? Wait, actually, (xy + yz + zx) can be as small as... Well, since x, y, z are positive, the minimum of (xy + yz + zx) given x² + y² + z²=1. Let me recall that for positive variables, the minimum of xy + yz + zx occurs when one variable approaches 1 and the other two approach 0. For example, if x approaches1, y,z approach0, then xy + yz + zx approaches0. So, the minimum of (xy + yz + zx) is 0. Therefore, (xy + yz + zx)^2 can be 0, so S² ≥0 +2=2, but that&#39;s not tight. So this approach doesn&#39;t give a useful lower bound. But wait, when x = y = z =1/√3, we have (xy + yz + zx)=1, so (xy + yz + zx)^2=1. Therefore, S² ≥1 +2=3, so S ≥√3. But in this case, S=√3, so equality holds. Therefore, the minimal value is √3. So, the minimal value of S is √3, achieved when x=y=z=1/√3. So, this is the minimal value. Hence, the answer is √3.But wait, earlier when I tried with x=0.6, y=0.6, z≈0.529, the S was approximately1.739, which is slightly higher than√3≈1.732. So that seems to support that √3 is indeed the minimum.Therefore, the answer should be √3.But let me verify again. Suppose x=y=z=1/√3, then x² + y² + z²=3*(1/3)=1, which satisfies the constraint. Then, S =3*( (1/√3)*(1/√3) )/(1/√3) ) = 3*( (1/3)/(1/√3) )=3*(1/3 *√3)=3*(√3/3)=√3. So, correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s check the partial derivatives in the case when x=y=z. Then, let&#39;s substitute x=y=z into equations (1), (2), (3):From equation (1):y/z - yz/x² + z/y = 2λx.If x=y=z, then each term becomes:y/z =1, yz/x² =1, z/y=1. So, 1 -1 +1=1=2λx. Therefore, 1=2λx. Similarly, equations (2) and (3) will also give 1=2λy and1=2λz. Therefore, x=y=z, and λ=1/(2x). Therefore, consistent. So, x=y=z=1/√3, and λ=√3/2.Thus, the solution x=y=z satisfies the Lagrange multiplier conditions. Therefore, it is indeed a critical point. Since our test cases with unequal variables gave higher S, this critical point is likely the minimum.Therefore, the minimal value of S is √3.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( S ) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given positive numbers (x, y, z) such that (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1), we need to find the minimum value of the expression (S = frac{xy}{z} + frac{yz}{x} + frac{zx}{y}).First, we consider the method of Lagrange multipliers. However, due to the complexity of solving the resulting equations, we explore symmetry and inequalities. We test the case where (x = y = z). Given the constraint (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1), if (x = y = z), then (3x^2 = 1) implies (x = y = z = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}). Substituting these values into (S):[S = 3 left( frac{left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)}{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} right) = 3 left( frac{frac{1}{3}}{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} right) = 3 left( frac{1}{3} cdot sqrt{3} right) = sqrt{3}]To verify if this is the minimum, we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We consider (S^2):[S^2 = left( frac{xy}{z} + frac{yz}{x} + frac{zx}{y} right)^2]Expanding and simplifying using the constraint (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1), we find:[S^2 = frac{x^2 y^2}{z^2} + frac{y^2 z^2}{x^2} + frac{z^2 x^2}{y^2} + 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)]Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the terms (frac{x^2 y^2}{z^2}), (frac{y^2 z^2}{x^2}), (frac{z^2 x^2}{y^2}), we find that the minimum value of (S) is achieved when (x = y = z). This confirms that the minimum value of (S) is indeed (sqrt{3}).Thus, the minimum value of (S) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8520547b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>🔑:</span>【Solution】 Squaring the expression, we getS^{2}=frac{x^{2} y^{2}}{z^{2}}+frac{y^{2} z^{2}}{x^{2}}+frac{z^{2} x^{2}}{y^{2}}+2left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}right),By the arithmetic mean and geometric mean inequality, we havebegin{array}{l}frac{1}{2}left(frac{x^{2} y^{2}}{z^{2}}+frac{y^{2} z^{2}}{x^{2}}right) geqslant y^{2}, frac{1}{2}left(frac{y^{2} z^{2}}{x^{2}}+frac{z^{2} x^{2}}{y^{2}}right) geqslant z^{2}, frac{1}{2}left(frac{z^{2} x^{2}}{y^{2}}+frac{x^{2} y^{2}}{z^{2}}right) geqslant x^{2},end{array}(1) + (2) + (3) givesfrac{x^{2} y^{2}}{z^{2}}+frac{y^{2} z^{2}}{x^{2}}+frac{z^{2} x^{2}}{y^{2}} geqslant x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}Thus,begin{array}{l}S^{2} geqslant 3left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}right)=3, S geqslant sqrt{3} .end{array}Furthermore, when x=y=z=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, the given condition x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1 is satisfied, and S=sqrt{3}.

Frank[/i]</div><div class="divider" data-v-8520547b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have portraits of famous scientists on a wall, all of whom lived between 1600 and 2008. None of them lived longer than 80 years. Vasya multiplied all their years of birth, and Petya multiplied all their years of death. The result is that Petya&#39;s product is exactly 5/4 times Vasya&#39;s product. We need to find the minimum number of portraits required for this to happen.First, let&#39;s parse the problem carefully. The key points are:1. Each scientist lived between 1600 and 2008. So, their birth year (B) is ≥1600, and death year (D) is ≤2008.2. None lived longer than 80 years. So, D - B ≤ 80.3. The product of death years (P) is 5/4 times the product of birth years (V). So, P = (5/4) * V.4. We need the minimum number of scientists (portraits) for this to be possible.Our goal is to find the smallest number of scientists such that when you multiply all their death years together and divide by the product of their birth years, the ratio is exactly 5/4. So, (D1 * D2 * ... * Dn) / (B1 * B2 * ... * Bn) = 5/4.To approach this, maybe we can think in terms of prime factors. Since 5/4 is a fraction, we need the death years to contribute a factor of 5 and the birth years to contribute a factor of 4, such that when divided, the ratio becomes 5/4. But since both birth and death years are integers, we need to manipulate their prime factors to achieve this ratio.But first, let&#39;s note that each scientist&#39;s D = B + age, where age ≤80. So, for each scientist, D = B + a, where a ≤80. Therefore, D/B = 1 + a/B. So, each death year is a bit larger than the birth year, but not by more than 80.However, when we take the product of all D&#39;s over the product of all B&#39;s, it&#39;s equal to the product of each D_i/B_i. So, (D1/B1)*(D2/B2)*...*(Dn/Bn) = 5/4. So, each individual ratio D_i/B_i is a little more than 1, but their product needs to be 5/4.To get a product of 5/4, we need to have factors in the numerators (death years) that contribute 5s and factors in the denominators (birth years) that contribute 4s, such that when divided, the 5s and 4s give 5/4, and the rest cancels out.But how can this happen? Let&#39;s think about prime factors.The ratio P/V = 5/4, so in prime factors, the death years should have an extra 5 and the birth years should have an extra 4 (i.e., 2^2). So, overall, the death years&#39; product should have one more 5 and two fewer 2s compared to the birth years&#39; product. Alternatively, we can balance the primes such that when you divide P by V, the exponents of primes in P minus those in V give +1 for 5 and -2 for 2.But how do we achieve this? Let&#39;s think of each scientist contributing to the exponents of primes in the birth and death years. If we can have a scientist whose death year contributes a 5 that isn&#39;t canceled by their birth year, and other scientists whose birth years contribute 2s that aren&#39;t canceled by their death years, then we can get the required ratio.Alternatively, maybe we can have one scientist whose death year is divisible by 5 and birth year is not, which would contribute a 5 in the numerator. Then, have two scientists whose birth years are divisible by 2 but their death years are not, which would contribute 2^2 in the denominator. The rest of the primes should cancel out, meaning that for other scientists, their death years and birth years have the same prime factors, so their ratio is 1. But this might not be possible because each D_i = B_i + a_i, so their prime factors might not cancel unless they are consecutive numbers or something, which is not necessarily the case.Wait, perhaps this approach is too vague. Let&#39;s think of specific years where the ratio D/B can contribute a factor of 5/4 when multiplied together. Since we need the total ratio to be 5/4, maybe we can find individual D/B ratios that multiply to 5/4. For example, if one scientist has D/B = 5/4, and others have D/B = 1, then the total ratio would be 5/4. But can a single scientist have D/B = 5/4?Let&#39;s check. Suppose a scientist&#39;s D/B = 5/4. Then 4D = 5B. So, 4D - 5B = 0. But since D = B + age, then 4(B + age) -5B = 0 =&gt; 4 age - B = 0 =&gt; B = 4 age.But age &lt;=80, so B = 4*age. Since B &gt;=1600, 4*age &gt;=1600 =&gt; age &gt;=400. But age must be &lt;=80. Contradiction. So, impossible. Therefore, a single scientist cannot have D/B =5/4.Therefore, we need multiple scientists whose D/B ratios multiply to 5/4. So, we need a combination where the product of (D_i / B_i) = 5/4.Since 5 and 4 are coprime, we need the numerator (product of D_i) to have an additional factor of 5, and the denominator (product of B_i) to have an additional factor of 4 (i.e., 2^2). So, the idea is that in the D_i, there&#39;s a multiple of 5 that&#39;s not present in the B_i, and in the B_i, there&#39;s a multiple of 4 (i.e., two factors of 2) that&#39;s not present in the D_i. The rest of the factors should cancel out.Therefore, to achieve this, we can have one scientist where D_i is a multiple of 5 and B_i is not, contributing a 5 in the numerator. Then, have two scientists where B_i is a multiple of 2 (but not 4) and D_i is not a multiple of 2, each contributing a 2 in the denominator. Alternatively, one scientist where B_i is a multiple of 4 and D_i is not, contributing two 2s in the denominator. Then, the rest of the factors should be such that the primes in D_i and B_i cancel out.But how can we ensure that the primes cancel out? For example, if a scientist has a birth year B and death year D, and if D and B share the same prime factors, then their ratio D/B would not introduce any new factors. However, since D = B + age, which is up to 80, D and B could share some factors but not all. For example, if B is even, then D = B + even age (if age is even) would be even, so D and B share the factor 2. But if age is odd, D would be odd if B is even, but age is up to 80, so age can be even or odd. Wait, but D must be at least B + 1 (since you can&#39;t die in the same year you&#39;re born), but the maximum age is 80, so D is at most B +80.Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s think of specific examples.First, to get an extra factor of 5 in the numerator (Petya&#39;s product) compared to the denominator (Vasya&#39;s product), we need a death year that is divisible by 5, but the corresponding birth year is not. So, for example, if a scientist was born in a non-multiple of 5 and died in a multiple of 5. Then, that death year would contribute a 5 that the birth year doesn&#39;t have. Similarly, to get an extra factor of 4 in the denominator, we need birth years that have factors of 2 which the death years don&#39;t have. So, for example, if a scientist was born in a multiple of 4 (which is 2^2) but died in an odd year (which doesn&#39;t have any factors of 2), then the birth year contributes 2^2 and the death year contributes nothing, so the ratio would be 1/(2^2). If we have two such scientists, their contribution would be (1/2^2)*(1/2^2) = 1/16, which is too much. Wait, but we need the total ratio to be 5/4. So, perhaps one scientist contributes 5 in the numerator and two scientists contribute 1/2 each in the denominator (i.e., birth year is even, death year is odd). Then, the total ratio would be 5/(2*2) = 5/4. That would work. So, maybe we need three scientists: one who gives a factor of 5 in the numerator, and two who each give a factor of 1/2 in the denominator. Then, the total ratio is 5/(2*2) = 5/4. If that&#39;s possible, then the minimum number is 3.But we need to check if such scientists actually exist, i.e., born in non-multiples of 5, died in multiples of 5, with lifespan &lt;=80; and born in even years, died in odd years, with lifespan &lt;=80.Let&#39;s try to construct such examples.First, the scientist contributing the 5:Birth year B1 not divisible by 5, death year D1 divisible by 5, and D1 - B1 &lt;=80.For example, let&#39;s pick B1 = 1999 (not divisible by 5). Then D1 must be 1999 + age &lt;=1999 +80=2079. But D1 must be &lt;=2008. So, the maximum possible death year is 2008. So, B1 must be &gt;=2008 -80=1928. So, if we take B1=1928, D1=1928 +80=2008. Let&#39;s check if 2008 is divisible by 5. 2008 divided by 5 is 401.6, so no. So 2008 is not divisible by 5. So, maybe another example.Suppose a scientist was born in 1985 (which is divisible by 5? 1985/5=397, yes. So that&#39;s bad. We need B1 not divisible by 5. Let&#39;s try 1986. Then D1=1986 + age. If age=80, D1=2066, which is beyond 2008. So, need D1&lt;=2008. So, age &lt;=2008 -1986=22. That&#39;s too young. So maybe someone born earlier.Let&#39;s pick B1=1945 (not divisible by 5). If they died in 1945 +80=2025, which is over 2008. So latest possible death is 2008. So D1=2008. So, age=2008-1945=63, which is allowed. But 2008 divided by 5 is 401.6, so not a multiple of 5. Therefore, D1=2005, which is a multiple of 5. Then age=2005 -1945=60, which is okay. So B1=1945 (not divisible by 5), D1=2005 (divisible by 5). That works. So that&#39;s one scientist.Next, the scientists contributing a factor of 1/2 each. We need two scientists where B is even, D is odd, and D - B &lt;=80.So, take a scientist born in an even year, dies in an odd year. Since even + odd age (if age is odd) = odd death year. For example, B=2000 (even). If they die in 2001 (odd), age=1, which is allowed. But lifespan of 1 is possible? Well, technically, a person can&#39;t die at age 1 if we consider scientists, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that they have to be adults or have accomplished something. It just says famous scientists, but maybe they could have died young. However, maybe we need more reasonable lifespans. Let&#39;s see. If B=2000, D=2001, age=1. But maybe the problem allows that. If not, perhaps another example. Let&#39;s take B=1950 (even). If they die in 1950 +1=1951, age=1. Still, same issue. Maybe age=81, but wait, maximum age is 80. So, the maximum age is 80. So, to get an odd death year from an even birth year, the age must be odd. So, age can be 1,3,...,79. For example, B=1928 (even). D=1928 +79=2007 (odd). Age=79. That works. So, B=1928, D=2007. So, lifespan=79, which is allowed. Then, D is odd (2007) and B is even (1928). So, D/B would be 2007/1928. But in terms of prime factors, 1928=8*241, and 2007=3*3*223. So, no common factors. Therefore, the ratio would be 2007/1928, which doesn&#39;t cancel out, so in the product P/V, this would contribute 2007 in the numerator and 1928 in the denominator. But 1928=8*241, so in the denominator, we have 2^3*241, and in the numerator, 3^2*223. So, the ratio for this scientist is (3^2*223)/(2^3*241). But we wanted this scientist to contribute a factor of 1/2, but here it&#39;s contributing more than that. So, this complicates things. So, maybe this approach isn&#39;t correct.Wait, maybe the problem is that even if B is even and D is odd, the ratio D/B may not just be 1/2, but could have other prime factors. Therefore, unless we can find a birth year and death year where the only difference is a factor of 2, which is not possible unless D = B/2, which would require B even and D = B/2, but then age would be negative. Not possible.Therefore, perhaps instead of trying to get a factor of 1/2, we need to balance the exponents of 2 in the total product. For instance, if in the birth years there are more factors of 2 than in the death years, such that when we take the ratio, the denominator (birth product) has two more factors of 2 than the numerator (death product). Similarly, the numerator has one more factor of 5 than the denominator.Therefore, the total exponents of primes in P/V should be: for prime 5, +1; for prime 2, -2; and for all other primes, 0. Therefore, we need to arrange that in the birth years, there are two more 2s than in the death years, and in the death years, there is one more 5 than in the birth years.Therefore, we can approach this by having:1. One scientist where D is divisible by 5 and B is not, contributing +1 to the exponent of 5 in the numerator (death years).2. Two scientists where B is divisible by 2 but D is not, each contributing -1 to the exponent of 2 in the denominator (i.e., +1 in the denominator, which becomes -1 in the ratio). However, if D is not divisible by 2, then the exponent of 2 in D is 0, so if B is divisible by 2, then the exponent of 2 in B is at least 1, so the ratio would be exponent in D minus exponent in B = 0 -1 = -1, meaning the ratio contributes 2^(-1). If we have two such scientists, the total contribution is 2^(-2), which is 1/4, and combined with the +1 in 5, gives 5/4. However, we need to make sure that in all other primes, the exponents cancel out. That is, for all other primes, the total exponents in D product minus those in B product must be zero.Therefore, the rest of the scientists must have their D and B such that for every prime other than 2 and 5, the exponents in D and B are equal. This can be achieved if for those scientists, D and B have the same prime factors, possibly with different exponents, but the difference in exponents cancels out across the products. However, this seems complicated.Alternatively, if the other scientists have D and B such that they share the same prime factors with the same exponents, so that their ratio D/B is 1. For example, if a scientist has D = B + k, where D/B = 1 + k/B, and if k/B is a fraction that doesn&#39;t introduce any new prime factors. But unless k and B share factors, this is unlikely. For example, if B is prime, then D = B + k could be another prime, so their ratio would be two different primes, which don&#39;t cancel. Therefore, this approach might not work.Alternatively, maybe we can have other scientists where D and B are consecutive numbers, so they are coprime, but again, their ratio would not cancel. Therefore, this seems difficult.Alternatively, maybe we can find scientists where D is a multiple of B. For example, if B divides D, then D/B would be an integer. If that integer is 1 (i.e., D=B), which is impossible, or 2, but D=B+age, so age would be B, but B &gt;=1600, which would make age over 1600, exceeding the 80-year limit. So, impossible.Alternatively, maybe if B and D share some factors. For example, if a scientist is born in a leap year (divisible by 4) and dies in a year that&#39;s also a leap year. Then, both B and D are divisible by 4, so D/B might have some factors. But unless B divides D, the ratio would still not be an integer. For example, B=1600, D=1680 (age 80). Then D/B=1680/1600=21/20=1.05. So, 21/20, which factors into 3*7/(2^2*5). So, primes 3,7 in numerator and 2^2,5 in denominator. This complicates things.Therefore, perhaps the only way to handle the other primes is to have them appear the same number of times in the numerator and denominator. So, for example, if another scientist has a ratio that includes a prime 3 in the numerator and denominator, canceling out. But this seems too vague.Alternatively, maybe the minimal case is when the only primes involved are 2 and 5. So, we need all birth and death years to be composed only of 2s and 5s. Then, we can manipulate the exponents accordingly. Let&#39;s explore this.Suppose all birth years (B) and death years (D) are numbers of the form 2^a *5^b. Then, the product of Ds over the product of Bs would be 2^(sum(a_D - a_B)) *5^(sum(b_D - b_B)). We need this ratio to be 5/4 = 5^1 *2^(-2). Therefore, sum(a_D - a_B) = -2 and sum(b_D - b_B) =1.Therefore, we need the total exponents of 2 in Ds to be two less than in Bs, and exponents of 5 in Ds to be one more than in Bs.To achieve this, we need:- For 5: one scientist where D has an extra 5 compared to B.- For 2: two scientists where B has an extra 2 compared to D.But all years must be between 1600 and 2008, and lifespan &lt;=80.Let&#39;s try to find such years.First, for the 5 exponent:We need a scientist where D is divisible by 5, and B is not. So, D has at least one 5, B has none. Thus, b_D - b_B =1 for that scientist.For the 2 exponents:We need two scientists where B has more factors of 2 than D. So, B is divisible by 2, D is not. Therefore, for each of these scientists, a_D - a_B =0 - a_B. If B is divisible by 2 but not 4, then a_B=1, so a_D - a_B= -1. Therefore, two such scientists would give sum(a_D - a_B)= -2, which is what we need.So, we need three scientists:1. One with D divisible by 5, B not divisible by 5.2. Two with B divisible by 2 but not 4, and D not divisible by 2.Additionally, all other primes in D and B must cancel out. Since we want other primes to cancel, we need that for these three scientists, the other primes in D and B are the same. But if we restrict to B and D being multiples of only 2 and 5, this might not be possible because years can have other prime factors.Wait, but if we take B and D as numbers that are multiples of 2 and 5, but arrange their exponents so that other primes cancel. For example, if a scientist has B=2000 (which is 2^4*5^3) and D=2005 (which is 5*401). Then, D/B=2005/2000=401/(2^4*5^2). This introduces a new prime 401 in the numerator, which we don&#39;t want. Therefore, this complicates things.Alternatively, maybe we need all other primes in D and B to be the same across all scientists, so that they cancel out. For example, if all scientists have B and D that share the same prime factors except for 2 and 5. However, this seems very difficult.Alternatively, maybe the minimal case is 3 scientists, and we just accept that other primes are introduced but they happen to cancel out. Let&#39;s see if such a case is possible.Take scientist 1: B1 not divisible by 5, D1 divisible by 5.Scientist 2: B2 divisible by 2 but not 4, D2 odd.Scientist 3: B3 divisible by 2 but not 4, D3 odd.If we can choose B1, D1, B2, D2, B3, D3 such that any other primes in D1/D2/D3 are canceled out by primes in B1/B2/B3, then the ratio would be 5/4.But how likely is that? Let&#39;s try to find specific numbers.Let&#39;s start with scientist 1: B1 not divisible by 5, D1 divisible by 5, lifespan ≤80.Let&#39;s choose B1=1944 (not divisible by 5). Then D1=1944 +age. To have D1 divisible by 5, age must be such that 1944 +age ≡0 mod5. 1944 mod5=1944-5*388=1944-1940=4. So age ≡1 mod5. The maximum age is 80, so possible ages are 1,6,11,...,76. Let&#39;s pick age=76. Then D1=1944+76=2020. But 2020 is beyond 2008. So too late. Next age=71. D1=1944+71=2015. Also beyond 2008. Next age=66: 1944+66=2010. Still over. Age=61: 1944+61=2005. 2005 is allowed. So D1=2005, age=61. Okay. So scientist 1: B1=1944, D1=2005.Now, scientist 2: B2 divisible by 2 but not 4, so B2 ≡2 mod4. Let&#39;s pick B2=1946 (since 1946/2=973, which is odd). D2 must be odd and ≤2008, lifespan ≤80. Let&#39;s pick D2=1946+1=1947 (age=1). But age=1 is too young. Let&#39;s pick a more reasonable lifespan. Let&#39;s take age=79 (max allowed). D2=1946+79=2025. Over 2008. Age=62: D2=1946+62=2008. 2008 is even. Not good. Need D2 odd. Age=61: D2=1946+61=2007. 2007 is odd. Okay. So scientist 2: B2=1946, D2=2007, age=61.Scientist 3: B3 also divisible by 2 but not 4. Let&#39;s pick B3=1948 (1948/2=974, even. Wait, 1948 is divisible by 4: 1948/4=487. So no. Need B3 ≡2 mod4. Let&#39;s try 1950. 1950/2=975, which is odd. So B3=1950. D3 must be odd and ≤2008. Let&#39;s take age=58: D3=1950+58=2008. Even. Age=57: D3=2007. Odd. So D3=2007, age=57. Scientist 3: B3=1950, D3=2007, age=57.Now, let&#39;s compute the ratio.First, compute the product of death years: 2005 * 2007 * 2007.Product of birth years: 1944 * 1946 * 1950.Compute the ratio:(2005 * 2007 * 2007) / (1944 * 1946 * 1950).We need to see if this ratio is 5/4.Let&#39;s factor each number:2005 = 5 * 4012007 = 3 * 3 * 223 (since 2007 ÷3=669, ÷3=223, which is prime)1944 = 2^3 * 3^5 (since 1944= 8*243=8*3^5)1946= 2 * 973 (973 is prime? Let&#39;s check: 973 ÷7=139, remainder 0? 7*139=973. Yes: 7*139=973. So 1946=2*7*1391950=2 * 3 * 5^2 *13 (1950=2*975=2*3*325=2*3*5^2*13)So, numerator factors:5 *401 *3^2 *223 *3^2 *223Denominator factors:2^3 *3^5 *2*7*139 *2*3*5^2*13Simplify numerator:5 *401 *3^4 *223^2Denominator:2^(3+1+1) *3^(5+1) *5^2 *7*139*13 =2^5 *3^6 *5^2 *7*139*13So the ratio is:(5 *401 *3^4 *223^2) / (2^5 *3^6 *5^2 *7*139*13) =(401 *223^2) / (2^5 *3^2 *5 *7*139*13)This is nowhere near 5/4. There are many primes here that don&#39;t cancel. Therefore, this approach with three scientists doesn&#39;t work because the other primes don&#39;t cancel out.Therefore, maybe we need more scientists to cancel out the extra primes. For example, if we have scientists whose birth and death years contribute primes that cancel each other out.But this seems complex. Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose we have multiple scientists where their birth and death years are the same, but that&#39;s impossible since D &gt; B. Alternatively, have scientists where the primes introduced by one scientist&#39;s D are canceled by another scientist&#39;s B.For example, if one scientist has D=5*... and another scientist has B=5*..., then the 5s would cancel. But we need the net to have one more 5 in Ds. Similarly for the 2s.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that 5/4 can be broken down into multiple fractions whose product is 5/4. For example, 5/4 = (5/1) * (1/4) or (5/2) * (1/2). But each fraction corresponds to a scientist&#39;s D/B ratio.But each scientist&#39;s D/B ratio must be a rational number greater than 1 (since D &gt; B), but not by much, since lifespan &lt;=80. So, D/B &lt;= (B +80)/B =1 +80/B. Since B &gt;=1600, 80/B &lt;=0.05. So each D/B ratio is at most 1.05. Therefore, to get a total product of 5/4=1.25, we need multiple scientists. Let&#39;s see how many.If each scientist contributes up to 1.05, then the number n needed is such that 1.05^n &gt;=1.25. Taking logarithms: n &gt;= log(1.25)/log(1.05) ≈0.223/0.0488≈4.57. So at least 5 scientists. But this is a rough estimate. However, the minimal number could be lower if some scientists contribute more than 1.05.Alternatively, maybe some scientists can contribute a larger ratio. For example, a scientist born in 1600 and dying in 1680 (age 80). Then D/B=1680/1600=1.05. Another scientist born in 1601, dying in 1681 would have D/B≈1.05. But even with 5 scientists, the product would be 1.05^5≈1.276, which is more than 1.25. But we need exactly 1.25. So precise factors are needed.Alternatively, maybe combine a scientist contributing 5/4 with others contributing 1. But we saw that a single scientist cannot contribute 5/4. Alternatively, multiple scientists each contributing fractions that multiply to 5/4.Alternatively, think of the ratio P/V=5/4. Therefore, P=5/4 V. So, 4P=5V. Therefore, 4 divides 5V. Since 4 and 5 are coprime, 4 divides V. Therefore, the product of birth years must be divisible by 4. Which means that at least two of the birth years are even (since each even number contributes a factor of 2). However, if one birth year is divisible by 4, that also suffices. So, the birth years must include at least two even numbers or one multiple of 4.Similarly, P=5/4 V implies that 5 divides P, so at least one death year must be divisible by 5.Therefore, we need at least one death year divisible by 5 and at least two even birth years (or one multiple of 4). But this is just a necessary condition, not sufficient.But how to make sure that the entire product ratio is exactly 5/4. Let&#39;s think of constructing such a set.Let’s attempt to find a minimal set. Let&#39;s try with 1 scientist: Impossible, as we saw before.With 2 scientists:Suppose we have two scientists. Then P1*P2 =5/4*(B1*B2). Need P1*P2/(B1*B2)=5/4. Suppose one scientist has P1/B1=5/2 and the other P2/B2=1/2. Then (5/2)*(1/2)=5/4. So possible? Let&#39;s check.First scientist: P1/B1=5/2. So 2P1=5B1. So P1= (5/2)B1. Since P1 and B1 are integers, B1 must be even. Let B1=2k. Then P1=5k. Also, P1=B1 + age &lt;= B1 +80. So 5k=2k + age =&gt; age=3k &lt;=80 =&gt; k&lt;=26.666. So k&lt;=26. So B1=2k&lt;=52. But B1 must be &gt;=1600. Contradiction. Therefore, impossible.Similarly, even with two scientists, we can&#39;t get the ratio. Therefore, two scientists are impossible.Next, three scientists.Let&#39;s suppose three scientists. We need (D1*D2*D3)/(B1*B2*B3)=5/4.Let’s try to find three scientists where one D is divisible by 5, B not; two Bs divisible by 2, Ds not; and all other primes cancel.Let’s attempt concrete examples.First, scientist A: D=5k, B not divisible by 5. Let’s choose B=2004 (not divisible by 5), D=2004 + age. Age must be such that 2004 + age is divisible by 5. 2004 mod5=2004 -5*400=2004-2000=4. So age ≡1 mod5. Max age=80, so age=1,6,11,...,76. Let&#39;s take age=76: D=2004+76=2080. Too late (must be &lt;=2008). Age=71: 2004+71=2075. No. Age=66:2070. Still over. Age=61:2065. Over. Age=56:2060. Over. Age=51:2055. Over. Age=46:2050. Over. Age=41:2045. Over. Age=36:2040. Over. Age=31:2035. Over. Age=26:2030. Over. Age=21:2025. Over. Age=16:2020. Over. Age=11:2015. Over. Age=6:2010. Over. Age=1:2005. So D=2005, age=1. So B=2004, D=2005. But age=1 is unrealistic, but allowed per problem statement. So, scientist A: B=2004, D=2005.Scientist B: B divisible by 2, D not. Let&#39;s take B=2000 (divisible by 2), D=2001 (not divisible by 2). Age=1. Again, age=1.Scientist C: Similarly, B=2002, D=2003. Age=1.Now, compute the ratio:(2005 * 2001 * 2003) / (2004 * 2000 * 2002).Let&#39;s factor these:2005=5*4012001=3*23*292003 is prime2004=4*501=4*3*1672000=2^4*5^32002=2*7*11*13So numerator:5*401*3*23*29*2003Denominator:4*3*167*2^4*5^3*2*7*11*13Simplify:Numerator:5*3*23*29*401*2003Denominator:2^(4+4+1) *3*5^3*7*11*13*167=2^9 *3*5^3*7*11*13*167Ratio= (5*3*23*29*401*2003)/(2^9 *3*5^3*7*11*13*167)Cancel 3 and one 5:(23*29*401*2003)/(2^9 *5^2 *7*11*13*167)This is nowhere near 5/4. So this approach with three scientists born very late doesn&#39;t work because of other primes. The problem is that even if we take scientists with very short lifespans, their birth and death years are consecutive numbers, which are coprime, introducing new primes.So maybe we need scientists with longer lifespans so that their birth and death years share common factors. For example, if a scientist lived 80 years, born in 1928, died in 2008. Then B=1928, D=2008. Let&#39;s factor these:1928=8*2412008=8*251So D/B=2008/1928=251/241≈1.041. The ratio is 251/241, which is a fraction that doesn&#39;t help us.Another example: B=1940, D=2010. But D=2010 is over 2008. Let&#39;s try B=1940, D=2000 (age=60). D/B=2000/1940=200/194=100/97≈1.03. Still not helpful.Alternatively, take a scientist who was born in a leap year and died in a leap year. For example, B=1600, D=1680 (age=80). D/B=1680/1600=21/20=1.05. So, 21/20=3*7/(2^2*5). This introduces primes 3 and 7 in the numerator and 2^2 and 5 in the denominator. If we have another scientist with B=21 and D=20, but that&#39;s impossible. Alternatively, balance these primes with other scientists.But this seems complicated. Maybe the minimal number is more than three.Let’s consider four scientists.Suppose we have:- One scientist contributing the factor of 5 (D divisible by 5, B not).- Two scientists contributing a factor of 1/2 each (B divisible by 2, D not).- One scientist to cancel out other primes.For example, let&#39;s take the previous three scientists and add a fourth scientist whose birth and death years cancel out the extraneous primes.But how? Suppose the first three scientists introduce primes like 401,223, etc., and the fourth scientist has B and D that include those primes to cancel them. This seems highly unlikely unless we can find such years.Alternatively, maybe the fourth scientist has B and D such that D/B is the inverse of the accumulated ratio from the first three scientists. But this requires precise tuning.Alternatively, maybe all four scientists have D/B ratios that multiply to 5/4. For instance, two scientists with D/B=5/4 and two with D/B=1. But as we saw, a scientist with D/B=5/4 is impossible. Alternatively, four scientists each contributing a factor of (5/4)^(1/4). But these would still require impossible birth/death years.Alternatively, think of the prime factors needed: one more 5 and two fewer 2s. Let&#39;s try with four scientists:- One scientist with D divisible by 5 and B not.- One scientist with B divisible by 4 and D not divisible by 2.- Two scientists with B divisible by 2 and D not divisible by 2.Wait, let&#39;s see:If we have:1 scientist: D=5k, B≠5k. Contributes +1 to 5 exponent.1 scientist: B=4m, D odd. Contributes -2 to 2 exponent (since B has 2^2 and D has 0).2 scientists: B=2n, D odd. Each contributes -1 to 2 exponent.Total exponents:5: +12: -2 -1 -1 = -4But we need only -2 in 2 exponent. So this overshoots.Alternatively:1 scientist: D=5k, B≠5k.1 scientist: B=2m (not divisible by 4), D odd. Contributes -1 in 2 exponent.Another scientist: same.Total exponents:5: +12: -1 -1 = -2This works. So three scientists: one for 5, two for 2s. But we saw that with three scientists, the other primes don&#39;t cancel. Maybe adding a fourth scientist whose birth and death years cancel out some primes.Let’s try with four scientists:1. Scientist A: B1=1944 (not divisible by 5), D1=2005 (divisible by 5). This contributes 5/1.2. Scientist B: B2=1946 (divisible by 2 but not 4), D2=2007 (odd). This contributes 1/2.3. Scientist C: B3=1950 (divisible by 2 but not 4), D3=2007 (odd). This contributes 1/2.4. Scientist D: Needs to cancel out the other primes introduced by A, B, C.The primes introduced are:From A: 1944=2^3*3^5, D1=2005=5*401.From B:1946=2*7*139, D2=2007=3^2*223.From C:1950=2*3*5^2*13, D3=2007=3^2*223.Total primes in numerator (Ds):5*401*3^2*223*3^2*223=5*401*3^4*223^2.Total primes in denominator (Bs):2^3*3^5*2*7*139*2*3*5^2*13=2^(3+1+1)*3^(5+1)*5^2*7*13*139=2^5*3^6*5^2*7*13*139.So the ratio is:(5*401*3^4*223^2)/(2^5*3^6*5^2*7*13*139)= (401*223^2)/(2^5*3^2*5*7*13*139).To cancel this, scientist D must have a ratio that is the reciprocal of this. But that&#39;s impossible unless we can have BD and DD such that BD/DD = (2^5*3^2*5*7*13*139)/(401*223^2). Which is not possible with integer years.Therefore, this approach won&#39;t work. The problem is that the extraneous primes (401,223,7,13,139) can&#39;t be canceled unless we have scientists whose birth and death years include these primes, which is highly unlikely.Therefore, perhaps the minimal number of scientists is higher. Maybe we need to find a set where the extra primes introduced by each scientist are shared among others, allowing cancellation.Alternatively, think of using the same prime multiple times. For example, if two scientists introduce the same prime in the numerator and denominator, they can cancel.For example, if one scientist has D=3*5 and B=3, contributing 5/1, and another scientist has D=2 and B=2*5, contributing 1/5. Then overall, 5/1 *1/5=1. But this is just an example.But in reality, we need to have such coordination. Let&#39;s try to construct such a case.Scientist 1: B1= 2^a *5^b, D1=2^c *5^d *other primes. But to have D1/B1=5/4, we need 5/4. But how?Alternatively, maybe find scientists where their birth and death years are multiples of each other. For example, scientist 1: B1= x, D1=5x/4. But since D1 must be an integer, x must be divisible by 4. Let x=4k. Then D1=5k. Also, D1 - B1=5k -4k=k &lt;=80. So k&lt;=80. Therefore, B1=4k, D1=5k, k&lt;=80. Also, B1&gt;=1600. So 4k&gt;=1600 =&gt;k&gt;=400. But k&lt;=80. Contradiction. Therefore, impossible.Another idea: Use the fact that 5/4= (5/2)*(1/2). So, two scientists: one with D/B=5/2 and another with D/B=1/2. But as we saw earlier, D/B=5/2 requires B=2k, D=5k, age=3k&lt;=80 =&gt;k&lt;=26.666. So B=2k&lt;=53.3, which is too low.Similarly, D/B=1/2 would require D= B/2. But since D&gt; B, this is impossible.Alternatively, think of exponents. To get 5/4, need one 5 and two 2s in the right places. Suppose we have:- One scientist where D is 5 and B is 4. But birth year 4 is too low.Alternatively, use LCM. Suppose we have scientists whose birth and death years are such that LCM of B&#39;s is LCM(B1,B2,...), and similarly for D&#39;s. But not sure.Alternatively, consider that the product ratio 5/4 implies that when you write all birth and death years in prime factors, the difference in exponents of 5 is +1 and in 2 is -2. So, we need to introduce exactly one more 5 in the deaths and two fewer 2s in the deaths compared to births.To do this:1. Include one scientist who introduces a 5 in D but not in B.2. Include two scientists who have 2s in B but not in D.But as we saw, even with three scientists, other primes mess this up. Therefore, maybe we need more scientists to cancel out those primes. For example, if a scientist introduces a prime p in D, another scientist must introduce p in B to cancel it.For instance, suppose we have three scientists:- Scientist 1: B1= a (not divisible by 5), D1=5a. Then D1/B1=5. But age=4a. Since age&lt;=80, 4a&lt;=80 =&gt;a&lt;=20. But B1&gt;=1600, impossible.- Scientist 2: B2=2b (divisible by 2), D2=b (not divisible by 2). Then D2/B2=1/2. Age= b -2b= -b. Negative age. Impossible.This approach doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, use multiple scientists to introduce and cancel primes:Scientist A: B= x, D=5x. Contributes 5.Scientist B: B=2y, D=y. Contributes 1/2.But again, age issues.Alternatively, find a group of scientists where the primes introduced in Ds and Bs are balanced across the group. For example, if one scientist introduces a prime p in D and another scientist introduces p in B, canceling each other.This seems like the only way, but constructing such a group is non-trivial.Let’s try with four scientists.Suppose:1. Scientist 1: D1=5k, B1 not divisible by 5. Contributes 5.2. Scientist 2: B2 divisible by 2, D2 not. Contributes 1/2.3. Scientist 3: B3 divisible by 2, D3 not. Contributes 1/2.4. Scientist 4: D4 has a prime introduced in D1, say 401, and B4 has 401. So, D4=401*m, B4=401*n. Then D4/B4= m/n. If m=n, ratio=1. But need lifespan. For example, B4=401, D4=401 +age. But B4=401 is way below 1600. Not possible.Alternatively, Scientist 4 introduces and cancels another prime. But it&#39;s difficult.Alternatively, use a scientist whose B and D are multiples of a prime introduced elsewhere. For example, if Scientist1 has D1=5*401, then Scientist4 has B4=401. But B4=401 is too low.Alternatively, maybe the primes introduced are small enough to be canceled within the constraints.But given the years are between 1600 and 2008, the primes involved would be quite large, making this improbable.Given that with three scientists, the ratio introduced many other primes and it&#39;s impossible to cancel them, maybe we need more scientists. Let&#39;s try with four.Suppose we have four scientists:1. Scientist A: B=1944 (not divisible by 5), D=2005 (5*401). Contributes 5 and 401.2. Scientist B: B=1946 (2*7*139), D=2007 (3^2*223). Contributes 1/2.3. Scientist C: B=1950 (2*3*5^2*13), D=2007 (3^2*223). Contributes 1/2.4. Scientist D: Needs to cancel 401,7,139,3,13,223.To cancel 401, Scientist D must have B=401*k and D=401*m. But 401*4=1604, which is within the birth year range. Let&#39;s take B4=1604 (401*4), D4=1604 +age. Let&#39;s choose age=80, so D4=1684. Factor 1684: 1684=4*421. 421 is prime. So D4=4*421. So D4/B4= (4*421)/(4*401)=421/401. This introduces 421 and cancels 401. Not helpful.Alternatively, take B4=401*5=2005, which is D1. So B4=2005, D4=2005 +age. But B4=2005 would mean the scientist was born in 2005, which is after the death year range (&lt;=2008). If age=3, D=2008. So B=2005, D=2008. This scientist contributes D/B=2008/2005, which is ≈1.001. Doesn&#39;t help.Alternatively, Scientist D: B=223 (too low). No.Alternatively, Scientist D: B=3*... , D=3*... to cancel 3s.But with the existing exponents:Numerator has 3^4 from scientists A, B, C.Denominator has 3^6 from scientists A, B, C.So net exponent of 3 is -2. Scientist D would need to contribute +2 in 3. So Scientist D: D=3^2*..., B=.... For example, B= x, D=9x. Then D/B=9. But D-B=8x &lt;=80 =&gt; x&lt;=10. B=10*9=90, too low.This approach isn&#39;t working.Given the difficulty in canceling primes, maybe the minimal number is higher. Let&#39;s consider that perhaps each scientist after the first three can help to cancel one prime. For example, each additional scientist cancels one prime. Therefore, with three scientists introducing 5 extra primes, we might need three more scientists to cancel them, totaling six. But this is just a guess.Alternatively, look for a mathematical approach. Let&#39;s consider the equation:Product of D&#39;s / Product of B&#39;s = 5/4.Taking logarithms:Sum(log(D_i)) - Sum(log(B_i)) = log(5/4).This is a linear equation in the logarithms. We need to find the smallest number of terms (D_i, B_i) such that their log differences sum to log(5/4).But this is abstract. Alternatively, consider that each term log(D_i/B_i) contributes to the total. Since D_i/B_i is close to 1, the logarithm is approximately (D_i - B_i)/B_i. So, sum((D_i - B_i)/B_i) ≈ log(5/4)≈0.223.But each term (D_i - B_i)/B_i &lt;=80/B_i. Since B_i &gt;=1600, each term is &lt;=80/1600=0.05. Therefore, we would need at least 0.223/0.05≈4.46, so at least 5 scientists. However, this is an approximation.But the problem requires the exact ratio, not approximate. So even if we use five scientists each contributing about 0.05, the product might not exactly be 5/4. Therefore, precise construction is needed.An alternative approach is to look for four scientists where:- Two of them have D/B=5/4 factors contributing.- Two of them have D/B=1.But as we saw, individual D/B=5/4 is impossible.Alternatively, use the fact that 5/4 can be achieved by multiplying multiple fractions. For example, 5/4 = (5/3) * (3/4). But then need scientists with D/B=5/3 and D/B=3/4. However, D/B=3/4 is impossible since D &gt; B.Alternatively, 5/4 = (5/5) * (5/4). But 5/5=1, which doesn&#39;t help.Alternatively, use multiple fractions:5/4 = (6/5) * (5/4) * (5/6). But this complicates things.Alternatively, use prime factorization. Since 5/4 is 5^1 * 2^{-2}, we need to have exactly one more 5 in the deaths and two fewer 2s.To achieve this, we need:- At least one death year with a 5 not present in the corresponding birth year.- At least two birth years with a 2 not present in the corresponding death years.Moreover, other primes must balance out.To minimize the number of scientists, we need to overlap these requirements as much as possible.Let’s try to construct such a case with four scientists:1. Scientist A: D1=5k, B1 not divisible by 5. Contributes +1 5.2. Scientist B: B2=2m (not divisible by 4), D2 odd. Contributes -1 2.3. Scientist C: B3=2n (not divisible by 4), D3 odd. Contributes -1 2.4. Scientist D: Must have B4 and D4 such that any other primes introduced by A, B, C are canceled.Let’s attempt specific examples:Scientist A: B1=1944, D1=2005 (as before). Factors: D1=5*401, B1=1944=2^3*3^5.Scientist B: B2=1946=2*7*139, D2=2007=3^2*223.Scientist C: B3=1950=2*3*5^2*13, D3=2007=3^2*223.Scientist D: Need to cancel 401,7,139,13,3^2,223.This seems impossible. Therefore, maybe the answer is higher.Alternatively, consider using scientists who lived in the same years, but this is not allowed as each must have unique birth/death years.Alternatively, look for scientists with overlapping prime factors. For example, if two scientists share the same prime in B and D.But this requires precise construction.Alternatively, think of years where D and B are multiples of certain numbers. For example, suppose we take scientists where:- B1= 1600 (2^6*5^2), D1=1680 (2^4*3*5*7). Then D1/B1= (1680)/(1600)=21/20=3*7/(2^2*5). This contributes 3*7 in the numerator and 2^2*5 in the denominator.- B2= 1680 (2^4*3*5*7), D2= 1760 (2^5*5*11). Then D2/B2= 1760/1680=22/21=2*11/(3*7). This cancels out the previous 3*7 and adds 2*11.- B3= 1760 (2^5*5*11), D3= 1840 (2^4*5*23). D3/B3= 1840/1760=23/22=23/(2*11). Cancels 2*11 and adds 23.- Continuing this pattern, but it&#39;s getting too long.Alternatively, consider using a group of scientists where each cancels the previous one&#39;s primes.But this would require an even number of scientists for each prime, which isn&#39;t practical.Given the time I&#39;ve spent and the lack of progress with small numbers, I recall that similar problems often have an answer of 4 or 5. Given that with three scientists it&#39;s impossible due to extraneous primes, and with four it&#39;s still problematic, but maybe possible with careful selection.Let’s try another approach. Suppose we take scientists where their D/B ratios multiply to 5/4 and all other primes cancel. For example:Scientist 1: D1=5, B1=4. Impossible since B &gt;=1600.Scientist 1: D1=25, B1=20. No.Scientist 1: D1=1625 (5^3*13), B1=1620 (2^2*3^4*5). D1/B1= (5^3*13)/(2^2*3^4*5)= (5^2*13)/(2^2*3^4). Not helpful.Scientist 2: D2=..., B2=...This is not leading anywhere.Alternatively, think of the multiplicative factors. We need the product of deaths over births to be 5/4. This can be achieved if one death year is 5 and one birth year is 4, but scaled up. For example, if we have birth years scaled by a factor k and death years scaled by 5k/4. However, due to the constraints of years between 1600 and 2008, and lifespan &lt;=80, this might not be possible.But let&#39;s attempt:Suppose we have two scientists:Scientist 1: B1=4k, D1=5k.Age= k &lt;=80, so k&lt;=80.B1=4k &gt;=1600 =&gt;k&gt;=400. But k&lt;=80. Contradiction.Scientist 2: B2=2k, D2= k. But D2 &gt; B2 requires k &gt;2k, impossible.No luck.Given the time I&#39;ve invested without finding a concrete example with a small number of scientists, I think the answer is likely 4, as an educated guess, but I need to verify.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. Use leap years. For example:Scientist 1: B1=1600 (divisible by 100 and 400, so leap year), D1=1680 (age 80). D1=1680=1600+80. D1/B1=1680/1600=21/20=3*7/(2^2*5). This introduces 3*7 in the numerator and 2^2*5 in the denominator.Scientist 2: B2=1680, D2=1760 (age 80). D2/B2=1760/1680=22/21=2*11/(3*7). This cancels the 3*7 from scientist 1 and introduces 2*11.Scientist 3: B3=1760, D3=1840 (age 80). D3/B3=1840/1760=23/22=23/(2*11). This cancels the 2*11 and introduces 23.Scientist 4: B4=1840, D4=1920 (age 80). D4/B4=1920/1840=24/23= (2^3*3)/23. This cancels 23 and introduces 2^3*3.Scientist 5: B5=1920, D5=2000 (age 80). D5/B5=2000/1920=25/24=5^2/(2^3*3). This cancels the 2^3*3 and introduces 5^2.Now, let&#39;s compute the total product:(21/20)*(22/21)*(23/22)*(24/23)*(25/24) =25/20=5/4. Bingo!So, with five scientists, each living 80 years, starting from 1600 and ending in 2000, their D/B ratios multiply to 5/4.But wait, let&#39;s check the years:Scientist 1: B=1600, D=1680Scientist 2: B=1680, D=1760Scientist 3: B=1760, D=1840Scientist 4: B=1840, D=1920Scientist 5: B=1920, D=2000Each scientist lives exactly 80 years. The birth years are 1600,1680,1760,1840,1920, and death years are 1680,1760,1840,1920,2000.Now, check if this satisfies the problem constraints:- All birth years &gt;=1600: Yes.- All death years &lt;=2008: Yes, 2000 &lt;2008.- Lifespan=80 years: Yes.Now, compute the product of death years:1680*1760*1840*1920*2000Product of birth years:1600*1680*1760*1840*1920The ratio is (1680*1760*1840*1920*2000)/(1600*1680*1760*1840*1920) =2000/1600=5/4. Perfect!Therefore, with five scientists, this works.But the question asks for the minimum number. So, can we do it with fewer?Suppose we try with four scientists:If we can find four overlapping scientists where the product telescopes similarly. For example:Scientist 1: B=1600, D=1680Scientist 2: B=1680, D=1760Scientist 3: B=1760, D=1840Scientist 4: B=1840, D=2000 (age=160)But age=160 exceeds 80. Not allowed.Alternatively, adjust the D&#39;s:Scientist 4: B=1840, D=1920 (age=80)Then the ratio would be (1680*1760*1840*1920)/(1600*1680*1760*1840)=1920/1600=6/5. Not 5/4.Not helpful.Alternatively, skip a scientist:Scientist 1:1600-1680Scientist 2:1680-1760Scientist 3:1760-1840Scientist 4:1840-2000 (age=160). Invalid.Nope.Alternatively, start later:Scientist 1: B=1928, D=2008 (age=80)Then ratio=2008/1928=1.041But with one scientist, ratio=1.041. To get 1.25, we need more. But with five scientists as before, it telescopes to 5/4.Therefore, the minimal number seems to be five.But wait, the example with five scientists is valid, but perhaps there&#39;s a way to achieve it with fewer by using different years.Wait, let&#39;s think again. The five-scientist case works because each subsequent scientist&#39;s birth year is the previous one&#39;s death year, creating a telescoping product. This results in the ratio of the last death year to the first birth year:2000/1600=5/4. So, it&#39;s essentially a chain where each scientist&#39;s birth year is the previous scientist&#39;s death year. The number of scientists needed is then determined by the number of steps required to get from 1600 to 2000 in 80-year lifespans. From 1600 to 2000 is 400 years. Each step is 80 years, so 400/80=5 steps. Therefore, five scientists.But can we find a shorter chain with larger steps? For example, if a scientist lived from 1600 to 1680 (80 years), next from 1680 to 1760, etc. This requires five scientists to cover 400 years.But the problem doesn&#39;t require the birth and death years to be contiguous. So perhaps overlapping scientists can achieve it with fewer steps.For example, if we have two scientists:Scientist 1: B1=1600, D1=1680Scientist 2: B2=1680, D2=1760Product ratio= (1680*1760)/(1600*1680)=1760/1600=11/10=1.1. Not 5/4.Three scientists:Scientist3: B3=1760, D3=1840Total ratio=1840/1600=23/20=1.15. Not enough.Four scientists:Scientist4: B4=1840, D4=1920Total ratio=1920/1600=6/5=1.2. Close, but not 1.25.Five scientists:Scientist5: B5=1920, D5=2000Total ratio=2000/1600=5/4. Exactly.Therefore, five scientists are needed with this telescoping method.But maybe there&#39;s a non-telescoping method with fewer scientists. For example, three scientists where their D/B ratios multiply to 5/4.Suppose we have:Scientist1: B1=1600, D1=1680 (ratio=21/20)Scientist2: B2=1700, D2=1780 (ratio=1780/1700=89/85≈1.047)Scientist3: B3=1800, D3=1900 (ratio=1900/1800=19/18≈1.055)The product ratio≈(21/20)*(89/85)*(19/18)= (21*89*19)/(20*85*18)≈(21*89*19)/(30600)= (35301)/30600≈1.154. Not enough.Not 5/4.Another example:Scientist1: B1=1600, D1=1680 (21/20)Scientist2: B2=1680, D2=1760 (22/21)Scientist3: B3=1760, D3=1840 (23/22)Scientist4: B4=1840, D4=1920 (24/23)Scientist5: B5=1920, D5=2000 (25/24)The product is (21/20)*(22/21)*(23/22)*(24/23)*(25/24)=25/20=5/4. So five scientists.Therefore, it seems that five is the minimal number using this telescoping product method. Is there a way to do it with fewer?Suppose we use scientists not in a chain. For example:Scientist1: B1=1600, D1=1680 (21/20)Scientist2: B2=1620, D2=1700 (1700/1620=17/16.2≈1.05)But not helpful.Alternatively, use different ratios:Scientist1: B1=1600, D1=2000 (age=400, way over 80). Impossible.Alternatively, look for a scientist with D/B=5/4 and lifespan&lt;=80.But we saw that impossible. For example, D/B=5/4 implies B=4k, D=5k. Age=k. B&gt;=1600 =&gt;k&gt;=400. Age=400&gt;80. Impossible.Therefore, the minimal number is five, as constructed.Final AnswerThe minimum number of portraits is boxed{5}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of scientists such that the product of their death years (Petya&#39;s result) is exactly ( frac{5}{4} ) times the product of their birth years (Vasya&#39;s result). The key steps are as follows:1. Prime Factorization Analysis: The ratio ( frac{P}{V} = frac{5}{4} ) implies that the product of death years must include one more factor of 5 and two fewer factors of 2 compared to the product of birth years.2. Telescoping Product Approach: By considering scientists whose birth and death years form a telescoping product, we can achieve the desired ratio. Each scientist&#39;s birth year is the previous scientist&#39;s death year, creating a chain that cancels out intermediate terms.3. Constructing the Chain:   - Scientist 1: Born in 1600, died in 1680 (80 years lifespan).   - Scientist 2: Born in 1680, died in 1760 (80 years lifespan).   - Scientist 3: Born in 1760, died in 1840 (80 years lifespan).   - Scientist 4: Born in 1840, died in 1920 (80 years lifespan).   - Scientist 5: Born in 1920, died in 2000 (80 years lifespan).The product of the death years divided by the product of the birth years results in a telescoping product:[frac{1680 times 1760 times 1840 times 1920 times 2000}{1600 times 1680 times 1760 times 1840 times 1920} = frac{2000}{1600} = frac{5}{4}]This chain of five scientists satisfies all constraints: birth years between 1600 and 2008, death years within the same range, lifespans not exceeding 80 years, and the product ratio ( frac{5}{4} ).Thus, the minimum number of portraits required is (boxed{5}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about portraits of famous scientists on a wall. Their lifespans are all between 1600 and 2008, and none of them lived longer than 80 years. Vasya multiplies the years of birth, and Petya multiplies the years of death. Petya&#39;s product is exactly 5/4 times Vasya&#39;s product. We need to find the minimum number of portraits required for this to happen.Hmm. So, first, let&#39;s parse the problem again. Each scientist has a birth year (B) and a death year (D). The constraints are:1. 1600 ≤ B &lt; D ≤ 20082. D - B ≤ 80 (since none lived longer than 80 years)3. The product of all Ds (Petya&#39;s result) is (5/4) times the product of all Bs (Vasya&#39;s result). So, (Product D) = (5/4) * (Product B).We need the minimum number of scientists (portraits) such that this ratio holds.First thought: Since 5/4 is a fraction in lowest terms, the numerator and denominator need to be accounted for by the multiplication of the years. That is, the product of the death years must have factors that, when divided by the product of the birth years, result in 5/4. Therefore, the ratio (Product D)/(Product B) = 5/4.To get such a ratio, we need to have factors in the Ds that contribute to 5 in the numerator and factors in the Bs that contribute to 4 in the denominator. But since 5 and 4 are coprime, this suggests that we need to have some deaths contributing a factor of 5 and some births contributing a factor of 4, but in such a way that other factors cancel out.But since we are dealing with years, which are integers, the product of Ds divided by product of Bs must be exactly 5/4, meaning that 4 * (Product D) = 5 * (Product B). Therefore, 4 divides into 5*(Product B), which implies that 4 divides into Product B since 5 is coprime to 4. Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, 4 divides 5*(Product B). Since 5 and 4 are coprime, 4 divides (Product B). So, the Product B must be divisible by 4. Therefore, at least two of the birth years must be even, or one of them is divisible by 4. That&#39;s a basic number theory fact.But perhaps we need to consider the prime factors. Let&#39;s think in terms of prime factors. The ratio is 5/4, so when you factor all Ds and all Bs into primes, the ratio of their products should be 5/4. Therefore, the combined exponents of each prime in Ds minus the exponents in Bs should be equal to the exponents in 5/4. That is, for prime 5, the exponent in Ds is one more than in Bs; for prime 2, the exponent in Bs is two more than in Ds; and for all other primes, the exponents in Ds and Bs must be equal. Therefore, the other primes must cancel out completely.Therefore, in order to have this ratio, the birth and death years must differ only in the factors of 2 and 5. So, for each scientist, the ratio D/B must contribute a factor that is a multiple of 5 in the numerator and a multiple of 4 in the denominator, but the other primes must cancel out.But since each D is greater than B, and D - B &lt;=80, the lifespan is at most 80 years. So, each scientist&#39;s D is B + age at death, where age at death is between 1 and 80. Therefore, D = B + age, age &lt;=80.Therefore, for each scientist, D = B + k, where 1 &lt;=k &lt;=80.Therefore, the ratio D/B = 1 + k/B. So, each D/B is slightly more than 1, but the product of all such terms must be 5/4. Since 5/4 is 1.25, so if there&#39;s only one scientist, D/B would need to be 5/4. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s possible.If there&#39;s one scientist, then D/B = 5/4. Therefore, D = (5/4)B. Since D and B are integers, B must be divisible by 4, and D must be divisible by 5. So, B = 4k, D =5k. Also, since D - B = k &lt;=80, so k &lt;=80. Also, B &gt;=1600 and D &lt;=2008.So, B =4k &gt;=1600 =&gt; k &gt;=400. D=5k &lt;=2008 =&gt; k &lt;=401.6, so k&lt;=401. Therefore, k can be 400 or 401.If k=400, then B=1600, D=2000. But D - B =400, which is way more than 80. So lifespan is 400 years, which is impossible.If k=401, then B=1604, D=2005. D-B=401, which is way over 80. So, lifespan exceeds 80 years. Therefore, impossible.Hence, with one scientist, it&#39;s impossible. So, minimum number must be at least two.Let&#39;s check for two scientists. Then, the product (D1*D2)/(B1*B2) =5/4. So, (D1*D2) = (5/4)*(B1*B2). Therefore, 4*D1*D2 =5*B1*B2.We need integer solutions where D1 = B1 +k1, D2 = B2 +k2, with k1, k2 &lt;=80, and B1, B2 &gt;=1600, D1, D2 &lt;=2008.Let’s think in terms of prime factors. The equation is 4D1D2 =5B1B2. So, in prime factors, the left side has 2^2 * D1 * D2, and the right side has 5 * B1 * B2. So, equating the prime factors, we need to have:- The 5 on the right must be accounted for by either D1 or D2. So, at least one of D1 or D2 must be divisible by 5.- The 2^2 on the left must be canceled out by factors from D1 and D2, but the B1 and B2 on the right must contribute 2^2. So, B1*B2 must have at least two factors of 2, i.e., at least two even numbers, or one multiple of 4.But we need to have the exponents of all other primes equal on both sides, so the D1*D2 and B1*B2 must have the same prime factors except for the 5 and the 2s.Therefore, perhaps each D is 5/4 times the corresponding B, but since D and B are integers, maybe one D is 5 times a factor and the other D is 1/4 times another factor? But that seems conflicting.Alternatively, maybe one scientist has D/B =5/4, and the other has D/B=1, but the second scientist can&#39;t have D/B=1 because D&gt; B. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe we can have one scientist where D1 =5k and B1=4k, so D1/B1=5/4, and another scientist where D2/B2=1, but that&#39;s impossible. Alternatively, another scientist where D2/B2 cancels out some factors. Wait, but we need the total product to be 5/4. So, maybe one scientist contributes a factor of 5/4, and another scientist contributes 1/1, so overall 5/4. But again, the second scientist would have D/B=1, which is impossible. So maybe two scientists each contributing a factor of sqrt(5/4), but that would be irrational. Since the years are integers, this approach might not work.Alternatively, perhaps one scientist contributes 5/x and another contributes x/4, such that when multiplied together, they get 5/4. For example, if x is a common factor. Let&#39;s try to find such x.Suppose we have two scientists:For the first scientist: D1 / B1 =5/xFor the second scientist: D2 / B2 =x/4Then, (5/x)*(x/4)=5/4. So that works. So, if we can find such x, and corresponding B1, D1, B2, D2, satisfying the constraints.But x must divide 5, and x must be a factor of 4? Hmm, not necessarily. Let&#39;s see. Since D1 and B1 must be integers, D1=5k, B1=xk. Similarly, D2=xm, B2=4m.So, D1=5k, B1=xk; D2=xm, B2=4m.Additionally, D1 - B1 =5k -xk =k(5 -x) &lt;=80Similarly, D2 -B2 =xm -4m =m(x -4) &lt;=80Also, B1=xk &gt;=1600, D1=5k &lt;=2008Similarly, B2=4m &gt;=1600, D2=xm &lt;=2008So, variables: x, k, m.We need x, k, m such that:1. 5k -xk &lt;=80 =&gt; k(5 -x) &lt;=802. xm -4m &lt;=80 =&gt; m(x -4) &lt;=803. xk &gt;=16004. 5k &lt;=2008 =&gt; k &lt;=2008/5≈401.6 =&gt;k&lt;=4015. 4m &gt;=1600 =&gt;m &gt;=4006. xm &lt;=2008 =&gt;m &lt;=2008/xAlso, since m &gt;=400 and m &lt;=2008/x, so 400 &lt;=2008/x =&gt;x &lt;=2008/400≈5.02. So x&lt;=5.But x must be a positive integer, since D1=5k and B1=xk implies x must divide D1. Similarly, D2=xm and B2=4m implies x must divide D2.But x must be an integer. Let&#39;s check possible integer values for x.Since x must be &lt;=5, possible x=1,2,3,4,5.Let&#39;s try x=5.Then, first scientist: D1=5k, B1=5k. Wait, but D1/B1=1, which is impossible because D1 &gt; B1. So x=5 is invalid.x=4:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=4k. So D1 - B1 =k &lt;=80. Also, B1=4k &gt;=1600 =&gt;k &gt;=400. And D1=5k &lt;=2008 =&gt;k &lt;=401.6. So k=400 or 401.If k=400: B1=1600, D1=2000. D1 - B1=400 &gt;80, invalid.k=401: B1=1604, D1=2005. D1 - B1=401&gt;80, invalid. So x=4 doesn&#39;t work.x=3:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=3k. D1 - B1=2k &lt;=80 =&gt;k&lt;=40.But B1=3k &gt;=1600 =&gt;k &gt;=1600/3≈533.33, which contradicts k&lt;=40. So impossible.x=2:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=2k. D1 - B1=3k &lt;=80 =&gt;k&lt;=26.666, so k&lt;=26.But B1=2k &gt;=1600 =&gt;k&gt;=800. Contradiction. Impossible.x=1:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=1k. So D1 -B1=4k &lt;=80 =&gt;k&lt;=20.But B1=k &gt;=1600 =&gt;k&gt;=1600, contradicts k&lt;=20. Impossible.So, x=1,2,3,4,5 all don&#39;t work. Therefore, this approach with two scientists is impossible.Hmm. So maybe two scientists is not enough. Let&#39;s try three scientists.Wait, but before moving on, perhaps there&#39;s another way to get the ratio 5/4 with two scientists. Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose we have two scientists. Let their birth years be B1 and B2, and death years D1 and D2. Then, D1*D2 = (5/4)*(B1*B2). So, 4D1D2 =5B1B2.We need to find integers B1, D1, B2, D2 with 1600 &lt;=B1 &lt; D1 &lt;=2008, D1 -B1 &lt;=80, same for B2, D2.Let’s suppose that one of the Ds is a multiple of 5, and one of the Bs is a multiple of 4. For example, let’s say D1 is divisible by 5, and B2 is divisible by 4. Then, perhaps:Let’s take D1 =5a, B1 =4b. Then, D1*D2 =5a*D2, and B1*B2=4b*B2. So, setting 4*5a*D2=5*4b*B2 ⇒ 4a*D2=4b*B2 ⇒ a*D2 =b*B2. So, a*D2 =b*B2. Therefore, D2/B2 =b/a.But we need D2 - B2 &lt;=80, and B2 &gt;=1600, D2 &lt;=2008.So, if we can find such a and b where D2/B2 =b/a, with D2 and B2 integers, lifespan &lt;=80. Also, B1=4b &gt;=1600 ⇒b &gt;=400, and D1=5a &lt;=2008 ⇒a &lt;=401.6 ⇒a&lt;=401.Also, lifespan for first scientist: D1 -B1=5a -4b &lt;=80.So, 5a -4b &lt;=80.Also, since B1=4b &gt;=1600, then b &gt;=400. So, let&#39;s set b=400. Then, B1=1600. Then, D1=5a. So, 5a -1600 &lt;=80 ⇒5a &lt;=1680 ⇒a &lt;=336. But a &lt;=401, so possible.But D1=5a must be &lt;=2008 ⇒5a &lt;=2008 ⇒a &lt;=401.6 ⇒a&lt;=401. So with b=400, a can be up to 336.But then, D2/B2 =b/a =400/a.But D2/B2=400/a. Since D2 and B2 are integers, this implies that B2 must be a multiple of a, say B2=ka, then D2=400/a * ka=400k.But B2=ka &gt;=1600, so ka &gt;=1600. And D2=400k &lt;=2008 ⇒k &lt;=2008/400≈5.02 ⇒k&lt;=5.Also, lifespan for second scientist: D2 -B2=400k -ka =k(400 -a) &lt;=80.So, k(400 -a) &lt;=80.But a &lt;=336 (from earlier), so 400 -a &gt;=64. Then, k*64 &lt;=80 ⇒k &lt;=1.25 ⇒k=1.Therefore, k=1. Then, B2=a*1=a, D2=400*1=400. But B2=a must be &gt;=1600, but a &lt;=336. Contradiction. Therefore, impossible.So, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Let&#39;s try with b=401.Then, B1=4*401=1604. D1=5a. Then, 5a -1604 &lt;=80 ⇒5a &lt;=1684 ⇒a &lt;=336.8 ⇒a=336.But D1=5a=5*336=1680. But D1=1680 must be &gt;B1=1604. 1680-1604=76&lt;=80. Okay, valid.Then, a=336, b=401.Then, D2/B2 =b/a=401/336≈1.19. Let’s see if we can find integers B2 and D2 such that D2/B2≈401/336, with D2 - B2 &lt;=80.Let’s write D2 = (401/336) * B2. So, D2 = (401/336) * B2. So, B2 must be a multiple of 336 to make D2 integer. Let’s set B2=336k. Then, D2=401k.Also, B2=336k &gt;=1600 ⇒k &gt;=1600/336≈4.76 ⇒k=5.Then, B2=336*5=1680, D2=401*5=2005. Check lifespan: 2005 -1680=325&gt;80. Invalid.k=4: B2=1344 &lt;1600. Not allowed. So, no solution here.Alternatively, maybe approximate the ratio 401/336. But since it&#39;s irreducible, perhaps there&#39;s no integer solution. Therefore, this approach also fails.Alternatively, maybe set different assignments. Let&#39;s try to think of specific years where D/B contributes a factor of 5 and 1/4.Wait, for example, suppose one scientist has D=2000 (which is divisible by 5) and B=1600 (which is divisible by 4). Then, D/B=2000/1600=5/4. But D -B=400&gt;80, which is invalid.But maybe two scientists each contributing part of the factors. For example, one scientist contributes a factor of 5/2 and another contributes 1/2, so total (5/2)*(1/2)=5/4. Let&#39;s see.First scientist: D1/B1=5/2. So, D1=5k, B1=2k. D1 -B1=3k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=26.666. B1=2k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=800. Contradiction. Not possible.Second scientist: D2/B2=1/2. But D2 &gt;B2, so 1/2 would mean D2 &lt;B2, which is impossible.Alternatively, one scientist contributes 5/1 and another contributes 1/4. So, (5/1)*(1/4)=5/4. But again:First scientist: D1/B1=5/1. So D1=5k, B1=k. D1 -B1=4k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=20. But B1=k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=1600. Contradiction.Second scientist: D2/B2=1/4. Again, impossible as D2&gt; B2.Alternatively, perhaps three scientists. Let’s see, maybe each contributes a factor that multiplies to 5/4. For example, (5/4)*(1)*(1)=5/4. So, one scientist contributes 5/4, others contribute 1. But the others can&#39;t contribute 1, as D/B=1 is impossible. Alternatively, two scientists contribute sqrt(5/4) each, but that&#39;s irrational. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe one scientist contributes 5/x, another contributes x/y, and another contributes y/4, so that overall (5/x)*(x/y)*(y/4)=5/4. Then, each intermediate factors cancel out. But this requires each step to be D/B ratio, which must be greater than 1.Let’s attempt this. Let’s set up three scientists:First: D1/B1=5/xSecond: D2/B2=x/yThird: D3/B3=y/4Then, product is (5/x)*(x/y)*(y/4)=5/4.So, each ratio must be a valid D/B&gt;1.So, 5/x&gt;1 ⇒x&lt;5x/y&gt;1 ⇒y&lt;xy/4&gt;1 ⇒y&gt;4But since x&lt;5 and x must be integer (as D1=5k, B1=xk), possible x=4,3,2,1. Let&#39;s try x=4.Then, first scientist: D1=5k, B1=4k. D1 -B1=k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=80. B1=4k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=400. So, k&gt;=400. Then, D1=5k=5*400=2000. So, B1=1600, D1=2000. But D1 -B1=400&gt;80. Invalid.x=3:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=3k. D1 -B1=2k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=40. B1=3k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=533.33. Contradiction.x=2:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=2k. D1 -B1=3k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=26.66. B1=2k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=800. Contradiction.x=1:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=k. D1 -B1=4k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=20. B1=k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=1600. Contradiction.So, this approach with three scientists also doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe three scientists where two contribute 5/ something and one contributes 1/4, but again, similar issues.Alternatively, maybe overlapping factors. Let&#39;s think of fractions that can multiply to 5/4. For example, 5/4 can be achieved by (5/2)*(1/2). But as before, the 1/2 is impossible. Alternatively, (5/3)*(3/4). Let&#39;s check:First scientist: D1/B1=5/3. Then, D1=5k, B1=3k. D1 -B1=2k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=40. B1=3k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=533.33. Contradiction.Second scientist: D2/B2=3/4. D2=3m, B2=4m. But D2 &gt; B2 requires 3m&gt;4m ⇒m negative. Impossible.Alternatively, (10/8)*(something). But 10/8=5/4. So, one scientist with D/B=10/8=5/4. But same problem as before: D-B=2k=5k -3k=2k, but no, D=10k, B=8k. D-B=2k&lt;=80. B=8k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=200. D=10k=10*200=2000. So, B=1600, D=2000. D-B=400&gt;80. Not allowed.Alternatively, maybe multiple scientists contributing small fractions that multiply to 5/4. For example, each scientist contributes a factor slightly above 1, such that their product is 1.25. So, for three scientists, each contributing roughly (1.25)^(1/3)≈1.077, so maybe 1.08 per scientist. But how to get such factors with integer years?Alternatively, maybe the ratio 5/4 can be broken into prime factors. 5 is a prime, 4 is 2^2. So, we need to introduce a factor of 5 in the death years and remove a factor of 2^2 from the birth years.Therefore, we need at least one death year divisible by 5, and in the birth years, we need to have factors of 2^2 more than in the death years. Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is (Product D)/(Product B)=5/4. So, Product D has one more 5 and two fewer 2s than Product B. Therefore, to achieve this, the death years must have one more factor of 5 and two fewer factors of 2 than the birth years.Therefore, to balance the primes:- For prime 5: The total exponent in Ds is 1 more than in Bs.- For prime 2: The total exponent in Bs is 2 more than in Ds.- For all other primes: Total exponents in Ds and Bs are equal.Therefore, the multiplicative difference is only in 2s and 5s. So, all other primes must be balanced, meaning that for every prime p ≠2,5, the total exponent in Ds equals the total exponent in Bs.Therefore, the birth and death years must be the same except for factors of 2 and 5, and the birth years must have two more 2s and one fewer 5 than the death years.Therefore, perhaps the birth years have numbers that are multiples of 4 (to contribute two 2s) but not multiples of 5, and death years have a multiple of 5 but not multiples of 4. But this is too vague.Alternatively, maybe one scientist who was born in a year with multiple factors of 2 and died in a year with a factor of 5. For example, if a scientist was born in a year divisible by 4 (so contributes 2^2) and died in a year divisible by 5 but not by 2, thereby removing the 2^2 and adding a 5. Then, the ratio for this scientist would be D/B=5/4. But as before, such a scientist would have D-B=5k -4k=k, which needs to be &lt;=80, but B=4k &gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=400, leading to D=5k=2000, B=1600, D-B=400&gt;80. Not possible.Alternatively, maybe multiple scientists. For example, one scientist adds a factor of 5 and removes a factor of 2, another scientist adds a factor of 5 and removes another factor of 2, but this would lead to ratio (5/2)*(5/2)=25/4, which is not 5/4.Alternatively, maybe one scientist adds a factor of 5 and removes a factor of 4 (i.e., D/B=5/4), but as above, impossible due to lifespan. Alternatively, split the factors across multiple scientists. For instance, one scientist adds a factor of 5/2 and another adds a factor of 1/2, but again, 1/2 is impossible.Wait, perhaps if a scientist dies in a year that&#39;s a multiple of 5 and is born in a year that&#39;s a multiple of 2, and another scientist dies in a multiple of 1 and born in a multiple of 2. But that seems vague.Alternatively, maybe consider that 5/4 = (5/2)*(1/2). So, if one scientist contributes 5/2 and another contributes 1/2. But 1/2 is impossible. Alternatively, maybe with two scientists:First: D1/B1=5/2, second: D2/B2=1/2. But second is impossible. Alternatively, first: 5/3, second: 3/4. But that totals 5/4. Let&#39;s check:First scientist: D1/B1=5/3. So D1=5k, B1=3k. D1 -B1=2k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=40. B1=3k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=533.33 ⇒Contradiction.Alternatively, first scientist: D1/B1=5/1 (invalid as before), second: 1/4 (invalid). Not useful.Alternatively, use three scientists:First: 5/x, second: x/y, third: y/4. But as before, this requires each ratio to be valid, which is difficult.Alternatively, think of the problem as an equation: 4D1D2...Dn =5B1B2...Bn. So, the product of deaths is 5/4 times the product of births. To have this, we need to have one more 5 in the deaths and two more 2s in the births. So, in total:- The combined product of deaths has one more factor of 5 than the product of births.- The combined product of births has two more factors of 2 than the product of deaths.All other primes must balance out.Therefore, we need to arrange the births and deaths such that:1. Exactly one more 5 in deaths than in births.2. Exactly two more 2s in births than in deaths.3. All other primes have the same exponents in births and deaths.Therefore, each scientist must either:- Introduce a 5 in death without introducing a 5 in birth, and/or- Remove a 2 in death compared to birth.But since each D is greater than B, and lifespan is limited, it&#39;s challenging.Perhaps, the minimal way is to have:- One scientist who introduces a 5 and removes two 2s.But how?Suppose a scientist is born in a year divisible by 4 (so contributing 2^2) and dies in a year divisible by 5 but not by 2 (so contributing 5, but not 2). Then, their birth contributes 2^2, death contributes 5. So, the ratio for this scientist is D/B=5/4. But as before, lifespan would be too long.Alternatively, multiple scientists:- One scientist who is born in a year with a factor of 2 and dies in a year with a factor of 5, thus contributing a 5 in death and a 2 in birth.- Another scientist who is born in a year with a factor of 2 and dies in a year without a factor of 2, thus removing a factor of 2.But this might need two scientists. Let&#39;s see.First scientist:B1=2k (even year), D1=5m (divisible by 5).So, this scientist contributes a factor of 5m / (2k). To not introduce other primes, k and m must be coprime to 2 and 5. Also, D1 -B1=5m -2k &lt;=80.Second scientist:B2=2n (even year), D2= something not divisible by 2. Let&#39;s say D2= odd number.So, this scientist contributes D2/(2n). To remove a factor of 2, D2 must be odd, so it doesn&#39;t contribute any 2s, so the birth contributes a 2, death doesn&#39;t, so overall factor is 1/(2n).But then, the total ratio would be [5m/(2k)] * [D2/(2n)] =5mD2/(4kn). We need this to be 5/4. Therefore, mD2/(kn)=1. So, mD2=kn.But we need to find integers k, m, n, D2 such that:1. 5m -2k &lt;=80 (from first scientist&#39;s lifespan)2. D2 -2n &lt;=80 (from second scientist&#39;s lifespan)3. B1=2k &gt;=1600 ⇒k &gt;=8004. D1=5m &lt;=2008 ⇒m &lt;=401.6 ⇒m &lt;=4015. B2=2n &gt;=1600 ⇒n &gt;=8006. D2 &lt;=2008, D2 must be odd.Also, mD2=kn.Given that k and n are &gt;=800, and m &lt;=401, let&#39;s see:mD2 =k n.But m&lt;=401, k &gt;=800, n&gt;=800.Thus, mD2 &gt;=800*800=640,000.But m&lt;=401, D2 &lt;=2008, so mD2 &lt;=401*2008≈805, 208. Wait, but 401*2008=805, 208? Let me compute 400*2008=803,200, plus 1*2008=805,208. So, mD2&lt;=805,208. But kn &gt;=800*800=640,000. So, mD2=kn must be between 640,000 and 805,208.But this seems possible. Let&#39;s attempt to find such numbers.Let’s take m=401 (max m). Then D2=kn/(401). But D2 must be integer. So kn must be divisible by 401. Since 401 is a prime number. So, either k or n must be multiple of 401.Let’s suppose k=401*p, n=401*q. Then, m=401, D2= (401*p *401*q)/401=401*p*q.But k=401*p &gt;=800 ⇒p&gt;=2 (since 401*2=802). Similarly, n=401*q &gt;=800 ⇒q&gt;=2.Thus, D2=401*p*q. But D2 &lt;=2008 ⇒401*p*q &lt;=2008 ⇒p*q &lt;=2008/401≈5.007. So p*q&lt;=5.Possible p=2, q=2 ⇒p*q=4 ⇒D2=401*4=1604. Check if D2 is odd? 1604 is even. Not allowed. Since D2 must be odd.p=2, q=1 ⇒q=1 ⇒n=401*1=401 &lt;800. Invalid.Wait, since q must be at least 2. So p=2, q=2 is the minimal. But D2=1604 is even. Not allowed. Next, p=1, q=5 ⇒But p must be at least 2. So, no solution with m=401.Alternatively, take m=400. Then, D1=5*400=2000. B1=2k. D1 -B1=2000 -2k &lt;=80 ⇒2k &gt;=1920 ⇒k &gt;=960.Also, B1=2k &gt;=1600 ⇒k &gt;=800. But here k &gt;=960.So, k &gt;=960, n &gt;=800.Then, mD2=400*D2=kn.So, D2=kn/400. Since D2 must be integer, kn must be divisible by 400.Also, D2 must be odd. So, kn must be divisible by 400, but D2=kn/400 must be odd ⇒kn must have exactly factors of 400 and the remaining factors must be odd. Since 400=2^4*5^2. So, kn must have at least 2^4*5^2. To have kn/400 be integer and odd, kn must have exactly 2^4*5^2 and the rest factors odd.So, let&#39;s write kn=400*s, where s is odd. Then, D2= s.But D2&lt;=2008 ⇒s&lt;=2008.Also, D2 -B2= s -2n &lt;=80 ⇒s &lt;=2n +80.Also, B2=2n &gt;=1600 ⇒n&gt;=800.Additionally, kn=400*s. Since k &gt;=960, n &gt;=800.So, k=960, n=800: kn=960*800=768,000. Then, s=768,000/400=1920. But s must be odd. 1920 is even. Not allowed.Next, try k=960, n=801: kn=960*801=768,960. s=768,960/400=1922.4. Not integer.k=961, n=800: kn=961*800=768,800. s=768,800/400=1922. Still even.k=962, n=800: kn=962*800=769,600. s=1924. Even.Not helpful. Maybe k=975, n=800: kn=975*800=780,000. s=780,000/400=1950. Still even.Alternatively, maybe k=1000, n=820: kn=1000*820=820,000. s=2050. Even.Wait, this approach might not work since s=kn/400 must be odd. To have s odd, kn must be divisible by 400 but not by 2 anymore, which is impossible because kn=400*s, which is divisible by 2^4*5^2. Therefore, s must contain the remaining factors. If s is odd, then kn must have exactly 2^4*5^2 and the rest factors odd. But k and n are both even numbers (since B1=2k and B2=2n), so k and n are at least 800, which are even. Therefore, k and n are even, so kn is divisible by 4, but we need kn=400*s=2^4*5^2*s. Since k and n are even, they each contribute at least a factor of 2. So, k=2a, n=2b. Then, kn=4ab. So, 4ab=400*s ⇒ab=100*s. Therefore, s=ab/100. Since s must be integer, ab must be divisible by 100. Also, s must be odd. Therefore, ab must be divisible by 100, and ab/100 must be odd. So, ab=100*(2c +1). Thus, ab must be a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 200.Given that a=k/2 &gt;=480 (since k&gt;=960), b=n/2 &gt;=400 (since n&gt;=800). So, a&gt;=480, b&gt;=400.ab=100*(2c +1). Therefore, ab must be ≡100 mod 200.But a and b are integers &gt;=480 and &gt;=400. Let&#39;s see:Let’s take a=480, b=400: ab=480*400=192,000. 192,000/100=1920, which is even. Not allowed.a=480, b=401: ab=480*401=192,480. 192,480/100=1924.8. Not integer.a=481, b=400: ab=481*400=192,400. 192,400/100=1924. Even.a=481, b=401: ab=481*401=192, 481*400=192,400 +481=192,881. 192,881/100=1928.81. Not integer.a=482, b=400: ab=482*400=192,800. 1928.00. Even.This seems not working. Maybe higher a and b.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s impossible to have such s odd with a and b being integers &gt;=480 and 400. So, maybe this approach is not feasible.Therefore, two scientists is not working. Let&#39;s think of three scientists.If three scientists, then 4*D1*D2*D3=5*B1*B2*B3.Thus, we need to distribute the factors of 5 and 2^2 across three scientists. Maybe each scientist contributes a part of the required factors.For example:- One scientist introduces a factor of 5 and removes a factor of 2.- Another scientist introduces a factor of 5 and removes another factor of 2.- The third scientist cancels out the extra 5 and adds the necessary factors. Wait, no.Alternatively, maybe:- One scientist has D/B=5/2 (introduces 5, removes 2)- One scientist has D/B=1/2 (invalid)- Third scientist has D/B=1/1 (invalid)Not useful.Alternatively:- One scientist introduces a factor of 5/4 (impossible due to lifespan)- Two other scientists have D/B=1 each (invalid)Alternatively, three scientists:First: D1/B1=5/xSecond: D2/B2=x/yThird: D3/B3=y/4Same as before. If we can find x and y such that each ratio is valid.Let’s try x=2 and y=5.First: D1/B1=5/2 ⇒D1=5k, B1=2k. D1 -B1=3k &lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=26.666, but B1=2k&gt;=1600⇒k&gt;=800. Contradiction.x=5 and y=2. Then:First: D1/B1=5/5=1 (invalid)Second: D2/B2=5/2 (same issue)Third: D3/B3=2/4=0.5 (invalid)Not helpful.Alternatively, different x and y. Maybe x=4, y=5:First: D1/B1=5/4. As before, lifespan too long.Second: D2/B2=4/5. Impossible.Third: D3/B3=5/4. Again, lifespan too long.Alternatively, perhaps introduce another prime factor. Suppose one scientist has a birth year with a factor of 2, and death year with a factor of 5 and another factor. Then another scientist cancels out the extra prime.For example:Scientist 1: B1=2k, D1=5k. This would give D1/B1=5/2. But D1 -B1=3k &lt;=80. B1=2k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=800. Then D1=5*800=4000, which is way above 2008. Impossible.Scientist 2: B2= some multiple, D2= some multiple. Maybe this approach is not working.Alternatively, think about specific years. Let&#39;s see:Suppose there is a scientist born in 1600 (which is 2^6 * 5^2) and died in 2000 (which is 2^4 *5^3). Then, D/B = 2000/1600 =5/4. But lifespan is 400 years. Impossible.Another scientist born in 1601 and died in 2005. D/B=2005/1601≈1.25, which is approximately 5/4, but not exact. And lifespan is 404 years. No.Alternatively, look for years where D = (5/4)B. For instance, if B is divisible by 4, then D =5*(B/4). So, B=4k, D=5k. As before, D -B=k. To have D &lt;=2008, k &lt;=2008/5≈401.6 ⇒k=401. Then, B=1604, D=2005. D-B=401&gt;80. Invalid.Alternatively, if two scientists contribute fractions that multiply to 5/4. For example, one scientist has D1/B1=5/3 and another scientist has D2/B2=3/4. But then:First scientist: D1=5k, B1=3k. D1 -B1=2k &lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=40. B1=3k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=533. Contradiction.Second scientist: D2=3m, B2=4m. D2 -B2= -m &lt;0. Impossible.Alternatively, perhaps three scientists where each introduces a factor and removes some others. This is getting too vague.Maybe think of the problem as a Diophantine equation: 4D1D2…Dn =5B1B2…Bn. We need to find the smallest n for which this equation has solutions under the given constraints.Given that for each scientist, D_i = B_i +k_i, where 1&lt;=k_i &lt;=80, and 1600 &lt;=B_i &lt; D_i &lt;=2008.The key is that the product of (1 +k_i/B_i) must equal 5/4.Given that each term (1 +k_i/B_i) is greater than 1 but at most (1 +80/1600)=1.05. So each term contributes a small factor. Therefore, the number of terms needed to reach 1.25 is at least log(1.25)/log(1.05)≈4.56. So, at least 5 scientists? But maybe with more optimal factors.Wait, but this is a rough estimate. If each term is up to 1.05, then to reach 1.25, we need more than 5 terms. But perhaps some terms can contribute more than 1.05.For example, if a scientist is born in 1920 and died in 2000, then D=2000, B=1920, D/B=2000/1920=1.041666..., lifespan=80 years. Just within the limit. So this term is 1.041666...Another scientist born in 1921, died in 2001: lifespan=80. D/B≈1.0416.But 1.041666^5≈1.22, which is less than 1.25. So even five such scientists would not reach 1.25.Alternatively, if we can find a scientist with a higher ratio. For example, born in 1940, died in 2000: D/B=2000/1940≈1.03, lifespan=60. Not helpful.Wait, what if a scientist was born in a leap year, which is divisible by 4, and died in a year divisible by 5. For example, born in 1980 (divisible by 4), died in 2000 (divisible by 5). Then, D/B=2000/1980≈1.0101, lifespan=20. The ratio is almost 1.Alternatively, born in 1600, died in 1680. Wait, 1600 is divisible by 4, 1680 is divisible by 5 (1680/5=336). D/B=1680/1600=1.05. lifespan=80. So ratio=1.05. So this is a valid scientist. lifespan=80 years. Then, 1.05 per scientist. So, 1.05^n=1.25 ⇒n≈4.96. So, 5 scientists.But let&#39;s check:If we have five scientists, each with D/B=1680/1600=21/20=1.05. Then, the product would be (21/20)^5≈1.276, which is higher than 1.25. So, maybe fewer scientists if we can get some scientists with higher ratios.For example, if two scientists have a ratio of 1.05 and three scientists have a higher ratio.Alternatively, perhaps combine scientists with different ratios.Alternatively, one scientist with a higher ratio and others with lower.But how to get exact 5/4=1.25.Alternatively, suppose we have two scientists: one with D/B=5/4 and lifespan 400 years (invalid), and another with D/B=1 (invalid). Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe three scientists with ratios 5/4, 1, 1. But again, invalid.Alternatively, think of the prime factors. Since we need to introduce a 5 and remove two 2s, maybe one scientist introduces a 5 and removes a 4 (i.e., D/B=5/4), and another scientist introduces a 1 and removes a 1 (impossible). Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe one scientist introduces a 5 and removes two 2s, and another scientist introduces a 1 and removes a 1. But this seems impossible.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Suppose we have four scientists:Each contributes a factor of (5/4)^(1/4)≈1.057. But how to achieve this with integer years.Alternatively, split the factors: introduce 5 in one scientist and remove 4 in another.For example:Scientist 1: B1=4k, D1=5k. Contributes D1/B1=5/4.Scientist 2: B2=5m, D2=4m. Contributes D2/B2=4/5.Then, the product is (5/4)*(4/5)=1. So, not helpful. But if we have two such pairs, then the product is still 1. Not helpful.Alternatively, three scientists:Scientist 1: D1/B1=5/4Scientist 2: D2/B2=5/4Scientist 3: D3/B3=1/(5/4)*(1/(5/4))=1. So, impossible.Alternatively, use different factors. For example:Scientist 1: D1/B1=5/2Scientist 2: D2/B2=1/2Product: (5/2)*(1/2)=5/4. But as before, impossible.Alternatively, with three scientists:Scientist 1: 5/3Scientist 2: 3/4Scientist 3: 1/1Product: (5/3)*(3/4)=5/4. But third scientist is invalid.Alternatively, Scientist 3: D3/B3=4/4=1, which is invalid.This seems stuck.Maybe think of the problem as a balancing act. We need to have in the product of deaths one more 5 and two fewer 2s than in the births.Therefore, we need to have:- At least one death year divisible by 5, not balanced by a birth year divisible by 5.- At least two more factors of 2 in births than in deaths.To balance other primes, each prime other than 2 and 5 must appear the same number of times in births and deaths.Therefore, one possible way is:- Include one scientist who was born in a year divisible by 4 (contributing two 2s) and died in a year divisible by 5 but not by 2 (thus contributing one 5 and removing two 2s).- Include other scientists whose birth and death years have the same prime factors except for 2 and 5. For example, they were born and died in years that are co-prime to 2 and 5, or their birth and death years have the same number of 2s and 5s.So, if we have one such scientist who &quot;converts&quot; two 2s into one 5, and other scientists who don&#39;t affect the 2s and 5s balance, then the total would be one more 5 and two fewer 2s.But how to find such a scientist:Born in year B divisible by 4 (has at least two 2s), died in year D divisible by 5 but not by 2 (has one 5, no 2s). Additionally, D - B &lt;=80.So, looking for B divisible by 4, D divisible by 5, D not divisible by 2, and D - B &lt;=80.Let’s find such years.Let’s look for D divisible by 5, D odd (since not divisible by 2), and B divisible by 4, B &gt;=1600, D &lt;=2008, D - B &lt;=80.So, D must be an odd multiple of 5 between (B) and (B +80).Let’s try to find B and D.Start with D=2005 (divisible by 5, odd). Then, B must be &gt;=2005 -80=1925, and B divisible by 4. Check B=1928, 1932, ..., 2004.But B &gt;=1600, D &lt;=2008. Let&#39;s check B=1928: D=1928 +k=2005 ⇒k=77. Which is &lt;=80. So, B=1928, D=2005. Check if D is divisible by 5: 2005/5=401. Yes. D is odd. B=1928 is divisible by 4. Lifespan=2005 -1928=77 years. Valid.So, this scientist contributes D=2005, B=1928. The ratio D/B=2005/1928≈1.039. This ratio contributes a factor of 5/4 when considering the prime factors: B=1928=4*482=2^2*482. D=2005=5*401. So, the ratio D/B=(5*401)/(2^2*482). Here, 482=2*241. So, D/B=5/(2^3*241). Wait, this introduces other primes (241 and 401), which would need to be canceled out by other scientists.Therefore, to cancel out the primes 241 and 401, we need other scientists who have these primes in their birth and death years.For example, another scientist born in 401 and died in 241, but this is impossible because birth year must be &gt;=1600.Therefore, this approach introduces extraneous primes that can&#39;t be canceled out, making it invalid.Therefore, the only way to avoid introducing new primes is to have the birth and death years of the scientist not introduce new primes. That is, B and D must be such that all prime factors of B and D are already present in the other scientists&#39; years.This seems very complex. Maybe the minimal number of scientists is more than we initially thought.Wait, let&#39;s try to look for scientists with birth and death years that are multiples of the same primes. For example, if a scientist is born in 2000 (which is 2^4*5^3) and died in 2005 (which is 5*401). But primes here are 2,5,401. Not helpful.Alternatively, a scientist born in 1600 (2^6*5^2) and died in 1680 (2^4*3*5*7). But again, introduces new primes.Alternatively, perhaps scientists born in the same year. But the problem states portraits of famous scientists, so presumably distinct.Alternatively, use scientists whose birth and death years share common prime factors.Wait, perhaps if we have two scientists who convert 2s into 5s.For example:First scientist: B1=4a, D1=5a. Contributes 5/4.Second scientist: B2=4b, D2=5b. Contributes 5/4.Product: (5/4)^2=25/16. Not 5/4.But if we cancel out the extra 25/16 by other scientists, but that seems difficult.Alternatively, first scientist: B1=16a, D1=20a. Thus, D1/B1=20/16=5/4. But lifespan=4a&lt;=80⇒a&lt;=20. B1=16a&gt;=1600⇒a&gt;=100. Contradiction.Alternatively, think of scientists with overlapping factors.Another approach: Let&#39;s think about years in terms of their prime factors related to 2 and 5.Suppose a scientist is born in a year with a factor of 4 (2^2) and dies in a year with a factor of 5 but not 2. Then, this scientist contributes a 5 to the death product and removes two 2s from the birth product. If we have one such scientist, that gives us the necessary one extra 5 and two fewer 2s. However, this scientist&#39;s birth and death years must not introduce any other prime factors that aren&#39;t canceled out by other scientists.But unless other scientists have the same primes, which is unlikely, we need to cancel them out. Therefore, perhaps this scientist must be the only one, but the problem is the introduced primes in B and D.Alternatively, if the birth year is 1600 (2^6*5^2) and death year is 1685 (5*337). But 1685 -1600=85&gt;80. Invalid.Alternatively, B=1920 (2^7*3*5), D=2000 (2^4*5^3). D-B=80. Valid. D/B=2000/1920=5/4. But lifespan=80. Valid. Let&#39;s check:B=1920=2^7*3*5D=2000=2^4*5^3So, the ratio D/B= (2^4*5^3)/(2^7*3*5)= (5^2)/(2^3*3)=25/(8*3)=25/24≈1.041666...Not 5/4. Wait, 2000/1920=5/4.8=25/24. Not 5/4. So, ratio is 25/24, which is not 5/4.Wait, but 2000 divided by 1920 is 1.041666..., which is 25/24, not 5/4. So, my mistake.Therefore, this scientist does not give the required ratio.But suppose we have a scientist with B=1600 (2^6*5^2) and D=2000 (2^4*5^3). Then, D/B=2000/1600=5/4. Lifespan=400 years. Invalid.Another example: B=1945 (prime factors?), D=2005 (5*401). D-B=60. B=1945=5*389. D=2005=5*401. So, D/B=401/389≈1.03. But this doesn&#39;t contribute exactly 5/4, and introduces primes 389 and 401, which would need to be canceled.Alternatively, B=1980 (2^2*3^2*5*11), D=2000 (2^4*5^3). D-B=20. D/B=2000/1980≈1.0101. Not helpful.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a scientist with B=2000 -80=1920, D=2000. D-B=80. So, lifespan=80. D/B=2000/1920=5/4.8=25/24≈1.041666...Not 5/4.Hmm. It&#39;s really challenging.Wait, let&#39;s consider that the product of the deaths over births is 5/4. So, maybe using logarithms:log(Product D / Product B) = log(5/4)Which is equivalent to sum(log(D_i/B_i)) = log(5/4)≈0.223.Each term log(D_i/B_i)≈log(1 + k_i/B_i)≈k_i/B_i (using approximation for small k_i/B_i).So, sum(k_i/B_i)≈0.223.Since k_i &lt;=80 and B_i&gt;=1600, the maximum each term can contribute is 80/1600=0.05.So, 0.223/0.05≈4.46. Therefore, need at least 5 scientists.But this is an approximation. Maybe with some scientists contributing more than 0.05.For example, a scientist with B=1600, D=1680. Then, k=80, D/B=1680/1600=1.05. log(1.05)≈0.04879. Contributes about 0.04879.Another scientist with B=1604, D=1684. Similarly, k=80, contributes≈0.04879.Five such scientists would give≈5*0.04879≈0.2439, which is more than 0.223. So, maybe five scientists.But this is approximate. The exact required number might be five or six.Alternatively, find five scientists with D/B ratios whose product is exactly 5/4.For example, find five pairs of (B, D) such that D_i/B_i=(5/4)^(1/5)≈1.044. Each such scientist would need to have D_i/B_i≈1.044.For B=1600, D=1600*1.044≈1670.4. So, D≈1670. Check D-B=70.4. So lifespan≈70 years. Valid.So, a scientist born in 1600, died in 1670. D/B=1670/1600=1.04375. Close to 1.044.Another scientist born in 1601, died in 1671. D/B=1671/1601≈1.0437.The product of five such terms would be (1.04375)^5≈1.234, which is less than 1.25. So, need more.Alternatively, include some scientists with higher ratios.For example, one scientist with D/B=1.05 and four with 1.04.Then, product≈1.05*1.04^4≈1.05*1.1699≈1.228. Still less than 1.25.Need higher ratios.Alternatively, include one scientist with D/B=1.06 and others with 1.04.1.06*1.04^4≈1.06*1.1699≈1.243. Closer.But still not 1.25.Another scientist with 1.06: 1.06^2*1.04^3≈1.1236*1.1249≈1.264. Overshoots.So, with two scientists at 1.06 and three at 1.04: product≈1.264, which is over.Thus, it&#39;s possible that with six scientists, you can reach closer to 1.25.But this approach is heuristic and doesn&#39;t ensure exactness.Alternatively, think about the prime factors again. Since we need an extra factor of 5 and two fewer factors of 2, maybe the minimal number of portraits is 3, achieved as follows:- One scientist introduces a factor of 5 and removes a factor of 4.- Two other scientists remove factors of 2.But I need to make this concrete.Wait, suppose:Scientist 1: B1=4a, D1=5a. This contributes 5/4. But lifespan is a. B1=4a&gt;=1600 ⇒a&gt;=400. D1=5a&lt;=2008 ⇒a&lt;=401. So, a=401: B1=1604, D1=2005. Lifespan=401&gt;80. Invalid.Scientist 2: B2=2b, D2=b. But D2 must be &gt;B2, so impossible.Scientist 3: B3=2c, D3=c. Also impossible.Alternatively, scientists 2 and 3: B=even, D=odd. So, they each contribute a factor of 1/2 in the ratio. So, two scientists contributing 1/2 each, and scientist 1 contributing 5/4. Then, total ratio=5/4 *1/2*1/2=5/16. Not enough.Alternatively, scientists 2 and 3: D/B=2/1. But lifespan=2k -k=k. B=k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=1600. D=2k=3200&gt;2008. Impossible.Alternatively, this approach isn&#39;t working.Let’s try another angle. Suppose we have one scientist with D/B=5/4, but lifespan exceeds 80. So, invalid. To make it valid, we need to split the factors across multiple scientists.For example, if two scientists each contribute a factor of sqrt(5/4)≈1.118. But sqrt(5/4) is irrational, but maybe approximate with fractions.But years are integers. Let’s see:sqrt(5/4)=sqrt(5)/2≈1.118. So, D/B≈1.118. So, look for D and B such that D≈1.118*B.For B=1600, D≈1792. D-B=192&gt;80. Invalid.For B=1800, D≈2014&gt;2008. Invalid.For B=1920, D≈1920*1.118≈2149. Invalid.No good.Alternatively, use fractions. For example, if one scientist has D/B=10/9≈1.111 and another has D/B=9/8≈1.125. Then, the product is 10/9*9/8=10/8=5/4. Perfect!So, if we can find two scientists:First: D1/B1=10/9Second: D2/B2=9/8Then, the product is 10/9*9/8=10/8=5/4. Exactly what we need.So, let&#39;s check if such scientists exist.First scientist:D1=10k, B1=9k. D1 -B1=k&lt;=80 ⇒k&lt;=80.B1=9k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=1600/9≈177.78 ⇒k&gt;=178.But k&lt;=80. Contradiction. Impossible.Second scientist:D2=9m, B2=8m. D2 -B2=m&lt;=80.B2=8m&gt;=1600 ⇒m&gt;=200.D2=9m=9*200=1800&lt;=2008. Valid. But D2 -B2=m=200. Which is&gt;80. Invalid.Therefore, impossible.Alternatively, use three scientists:(5/4) = (6/5)*(5/4)*(4/3). So, three ratios: 6/5, 5/4, 4/3. But each of these:First: D1/B1=6/5. D1=6k, B1=5k. D1 -B1=k&lt;=80. B1=5k&gt;=1600 ⇒k&gt;=320. D1=6k=6*320=1920. B1=1600. D1 -B1=320&gt;80. Invalid.Second: D2/B2=5/4. As before, invalid.Third: D3/B3=4/3. D3=4m, B3=3m. D3 -B3=m&lt;=80. B3=3m&gt;=1600 ⇒m&gt;=533.33. D3=4m=2133.33. Not integer. But m=534. B3=1602, D3=2136&gt;2008. Invalid.Another combination: (5/4)=(7/6)*(8/7)*(6/5). Product=7/6*8/7*6/5=8/5. Not 5/4.Alternatively, (5/4)=(15/14)*(14/13)*(13/12). Product=15/14*14/13*13/12=15/12=5/4. So, three scientists with ratios 15/14,14/13,13/12.Check if possible:First scientist: D1=15k, B1=14k. D1 -B1=k&lt;=80. B1=14k&gt;=1600⇒k&gt;=114.29. k=115. B1=1610, D1=1725. D1 -B1=115&gt;80. Invalid.Second scientist: D2=14m, B2=13m. D2 -B2=m&lt;=80. B2=13m&gt;=1600⇒m&gt;=123.08. m=124. B2=1612, D2=1736. D2 -B2=124&gt;80. Invalid.Third scientist: D3=13n, B3=12n. D3 -B3=n&lt;=80. B3=12n&gt;=1600⇒n&gt;=133.33. n=134. B3=1608, D3=1742. D3 -B3=134&gt;80. Invalid.Not working.Alternatively, use more scientists with smaller ratios.For example, four scientists with ratios (81/80)^4≈1.05. Not helpful.Alternatively, give up and look for a different approach.Wait, the problem says &quot;none of them lived longer than 80 years&quot;. So, D - B &lt;=80. So, D &lt;= B +80.Therefore, B &gt;= D -80.Given D &lt;=2008, so B &gt;=2008 -80=1928.But scientists lived between 1600 and 2008, so B &gt;=1600.Therefore, B is between 1600 and 2008 -1=2007, and D is between 1601 and 2008.But D &lt;= B +80.So, B can be from 1600 to 2008 -80=1928.Wait, no: If D &lt;= B +80, and B &gt;=1600, then D &lt;=1600 +80=1680. But D can be up to 2008. So, actually, for B &gt;=1600, D can be from B+1 to min(B+80,2008). So, for B &gt;=2008 -80=1928, D can be up to 2008. For B &lt;1928, D can be up to B +80.Therefore, B ranges from 1600 to 2008 -1=2007, but D is up to 2008.But the key is that for B &gt;=1928, D can be up to 2008.But this might not help.Wait, suppose we take scientists who were born in the same year and died in consecutive years. For example, B=1928, D=2008. Lifespan=80 years. D/B=2008/1928≈1.0414.Another scientist: B=1929, D=2009. But D &lt;=2008. So, invalid.Alternatively, B=1928, D=2008. Lifespan=80.Another scientist: B=1927, D=2007. Lifespan=80.Each of these scientists contributes a ratio of just over 1.04.If we have five such scientists, the product is (2008/1928)*(2007/1927)*...*(2004/1924). This might get us close to 1.25. But calculating this would require actual computation.But even then, the product might not be exactly 5/4.Alternatively, the minimal number is 5, but the exact solution requires a clever arrangement of years.Given the time I&#39;ve spent and not finding a solution with less than 5, but previous approximate calculation suggesting around 5, and considering that the problem is from a competition, likely the answer is 5, but I need to verify.Wait, but let&#39;s consider the following:Suppose we have four scientists with ratios 5/4 each. But impossible due to lifespan.But wait, no. If each scientist&#39;s ratio is not 5/4, but their product is 5/4.Another idea: The multiplicative factors can be achieved by having scientists who, in pairs, balance each other&#39;s factors except for the required 5/4.But I need to think differently.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. Suppose we have a group of scientists where their birth years include a factor of 4 and death years include a factor of 5, and other factors cancel out.For example, four scientists:Birth years: 1600, 1600, 1600, 1600 (all divisible by 4)Death years: 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000 (all divisible by 5)But each scientist must have unique birth and death years? The problem says portraits of famous scientists, so maybe they can have the same birth and death years, but likely, they are distinct. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify distinctness, but usually, portraits imply distinct people, but maybe not distinct years.However, even if allowed, the product would be (2000^4)/(1600^4)=(5/4)^4. Which is (5/4)^4=625/256≈2.44, not 5/4. So, not helpful.But if we have one scientist with D=2000, B=1600, and three scientists with D=B (impossible). No.Alternatively, three scientists with D/B=1 and one with D/B=5/4. But D/B=1 is impossible.Another approach: Since 5 and 4 are coprime, and we need the product of deaths to have one more 5 and two fewer 2s, maybe use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. But this seems complicated.Wait, the key is that we need the multiplicative ratio to be 5/4, so it&#39;s equivalent to 5/4 = (D1*D2*...*Dn)/(B1*B2*...*Bn).This can be rewritten as (D1/B1)*(D2/B2)*...*(Dn/Bn)=5/4.Each term D_i/B_i is a rational number greater than 1.To get exactly 5/4, we can consider the prime factors:- Numerator must have one more 5 than denominator.- Denominator must have two more 2s than numerator.- All other primes must be balanced.Therefore, one way to achieve this is:- One scientist contributes a 5 in the numerator and two 2s in the denominator (i.e., D/B=5/4).- All other scientists contribute 1/1, which is impossible.Alternatively, have multiple scientists contributing fractions that multiply to 5/4. For example:- One scientist contributes 5/2.- Another contributes 1/2.But 5/2*1/2=5/4. However, as before, both scientists would have invalid lifespans.Alternatively, use three scientists:- One contributes 5/2.- Two contribute 1/2 each.But again, the 1/2 contributions are impossible.Alternatively, use four scientists:- Two contribute 5/4.- Two contribute 1/1.But 5/4*5/4=25/16, which is not 5/4.Alternatively, one scientist contributes 5/4, another contributes 2/1, and another contributes 1/2. Product:5/4*2*1/2=5/4. But the scientist contributing 2/1 would need D/B=2, which implies D=2B. B&gt;=1600, D=2B&gt;=3200&gt;2008. Impossible.Another scientist contributing 1/2: D/B=1/2 impossible.This is not working.Given all these failed attempts, perhaps the minimal number of scientists is related to the LCM of the denominators involved. But I can&#39;t see it.Wait, suppose we use five scientists where each contributes a factor of 5/4 through their combined birth and death years. For example:Each scientist has a birth year that is a multiple of 4 and a death year that is a multiple of 5, such that D/B=5/4 for each. But we saw that this requires lifespan= B/4, which is too long. For example, B=1600, D=2000. Lifespan=400. Not allowed.But if we take smaller B and D:Suppose B=1680, D=2100. But D exceeds 2008. Invalid.Alternatively, B=1840, D=2300. Also invalid.No, this doesn&#39;t work.Another idea: The ratio 5/4 can be achieved through multiple scientists where their birth and death years are fractions that multiply to 5/4. For example, 5/4 can be achieved by (5/3)*(3/4)=5/4. So, two scientists:First: D1/B1=5/3.Second: D2/B2=3/4.But the second scientist has D2/B2=3/]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8520547b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8520547b><span class="icon" data-v-8520547b>🔑:</span>1. Let the years of birth of the scientists be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) and the years of death be ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_n ). Given that ( d_i = a_i + b_i ) where ( 1 leq b_i leq 80 ) for all ( i ).2. Vasya&#39;s product of the years of birth is ( P_V = a_1 cdot a_2 cdot ldots cdot a_n ).3. Petya&#39;s product of the years of death is ( P_P = d_1 cdot d_2 cdot ldots cdot d_n = (a_1 + b_1) cdot (a_2 + b_2) cdot ldots cdot (a_n + b_n) ).4. According to the problem, ( P_P = frac{5}{4} P_V ).We need to find the minimum number ( n ) such that:[frac{(a_1 + b_1) cdot (a_2 + b_2) cdot ldots cdot (a_n + b_n)}{a_1 cdot a_2 cdot ldots cdot a_n} = frac{5}{4}]5. This can be rewritten as:[prod_{i=1}^n left(1 + frac{b_i}{a_i}right) = frac{5}{4}]6. To find the minimum ( n ), we need to consider the maximum and minimum values of ( frac{a_i + b_i}{a_i} ). The maximum value occurs when ( a_i ) is at its minimum (1600) and ( b_i ) is at its maximum (80):[frac{a_i + b_i}{a_i} = frac{1600 + 80}{1600} = frac{1680}{1600} = frac{21}{20}]7. The minimum value occurs when ( a_i ) is at its maximum (2008) and ( b_i ) is at its minimum (1):[frac{a_i + b_i}{a_i} = frac{2008 + 1}{2008} = frac{2009}{2008}]8. We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that:[left(frac{21}{20}right)^k cdot left(frac{2009}{2008}right)^{n-k} geq frac{5}{4}]9. Testing ( n = 4 ):[left(frac{21}{20}right)^4 = left(1.05right)^4 approx 1.21550625]This is less than ( frac{5}{4} = 1.25 ), so ( n = 4 ) is not sufficient.10. Testing ( n = 5 ):[left(frac{21}{20}right)^5 = left(1.05right)^5 approx 1.2762815625]This is greater than ( frac{5}{4} = 1.25 ), so ( n = 5 ) is sufficient.Therefore, the minimum number of portraits is 5.The final answer is ( boxed{5} ).</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-3f6ea659><span data-v-3f6ea659>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
