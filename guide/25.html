class="icon" data-v-22911720>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to solve this problem. So, we need to simplify the expression ((frac{x-1}{x-3} - frac{x+1}{x}) ÷ frac{x^2 + 3x}{x^2 - 6x + 9}), where (x) satisfies (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.First, let me recall that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, the expression can be rewritten as (left(frac{x-1}{x-3} - frac{x+1}{x}right) times frac{x^2 - 6x + 9}{x^2 + 3x}). That might make it easier to handle.Next, I should probably simplify the numerator part first: (frac{x-1}{x-3} - frac{x+1}{x}). To subtract these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (x - 3) and (x), so the common denominator would be (x(x - 3)). Let me rewrite each fraction with that denominator.For the first fraction: (frac{x-1}{x-3}) becomes (frac{(x - 1) times x}{(x - 3) times x} = frac{x(x - 1)}{x(x - 3)}).For the second fraction: (frac{x+1}{x}) becomes (frac{(x + 1)(x - 3)}{x(x - 3)}).So subtracting these gives: (frac{x(x - 1) - (x + 1)(x - 3)}{x(x - 3)}).Now, let&#39;s expand the numerators:First term: (x(x - 1) = x^2 - x).Second term: ((x + 1)(x - 3)). Let&#39;s multiply that out:(x times x = x^2),(x times (-3) = -3x),(1 times x = x),(1 times (-3) = -3).So adding those together: (x^2 - 3x + x - 3 = x^2 - 2x - 3).Therefore, the numerator becomes:(x^2 - x - (x^2 - 2x - 3)). Let&#39;s distribute the negative sign:(x^2 - x - x^2 + 2x + 3).Now, combine like terms:(x^2 - x^2 = 0),(-x + 2x = x),And the constant term is 3.So, the numerator simplifies to (x + 3). Therefore, the entire subtraction part simplifies to (frac{x + 3}{x(x - 3)}).Now, moving on to the second part of the original expression: (frac{x^2 - 6x + 9}{x^2 + 3x}). Let me factor both the numerator and the denominator here.The numerator is (x^2 - 6x + 9). That looks like a perfect square trinomial. Let&#39;s check: ((x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9). Yep, so that factors to ((x - 3)^2).The denominator is (x^2 + 3x). Factor out an x: (x(x + 3)).So, the second fraction becomes (frac{(x - 3)^2}{x(x + 3)}).Now, putting it all together, the entire expression is:(frac{x + 3}{x(x - 3)} times frac{(x - 3)^2}{x(x + 3)}).Let me write that as a single fraction:(frac{(x + 3)(x - 3)^2}{x(x - 3) times x(x + 3)}).Now, let&#39;s simplify by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.First, the (x + 3) terms cancel out.Next, in the denominator, we have two x terms, so (x times x = x^2).In the numerator, we have ((x - 3)^2), and in the denominator, we have one (x - 3) term. So, we can cancel one (x - 3) from numerator and denominator, leaving (x - 3) in the numerator and 1 in the denominator for that term.So, after canceling, the expression simplifies to:(frac{(x - 3)}{x^2}).So, the simplified form of the original expression is (frac{x - 3}{x^2}).Now, we need to evaluate this expression given that (x) satisfies (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0). Let&#39;s see. Since (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0), we can solve for (x) or perhaps find a way to express (x^2) in terms of (x) to substitute into our simplified expression.Let me try solving (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0). Using the quadratic formula:(x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a = 1), (b = 2), (c = -6).So, (x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4 times 1 times (-6)}}{2 times 1}).Calculate discriminant:(4 - 4(1)(-6) = 4 + 24 = 28).So, (x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{28}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{7}}{2} = -1 pm sqrt{7}).Therefore, the solutions are (x = -1 + sqrt{7}) and (x = -1 - sqrt{7}).But since the original expression involves denominators (x), (x - 3), and (x + 3), we need to check if these solutions make any denominators zero. Let&#39;s see:For (x = -1 + sqrt{7}): Let&#39;s approximate (sqrt{7} approx 2.6458), so (x approx -1 + 2.6458 ≈ 1.6458). Then denominators:(x ≈ 1.6458 ≠ 0),(x - 3 ≈ 1.6458 - 3 ≈ -1.3542 ≠ 0),(x + 3 ≈ 1.6458 + 3 ≈ 4.6458 ≠ 0). So no division by zero here.For (x = -1 - sqrt{7}) ≈ -1 - 2.6458 ≈ -3.6458. Then denominators:(x ≈ -3.6458 ≠ 0),(x - 3 ≈ -3.6458 - 3 ≈ -6.6458 ≠ 0),(x + 3 ≈ -3.6458 + 3 ≈ -0.6458 ≠ 0). So again, no division by zero. So both solutions are valid.But since the problem states &quot;where (x) satisfies...&quot;, and doesn&#39;t specify which root, maybe we need to keep both in mind. But perhaps when we substitute back into the simplified expression, we can use the original equation to simplify further without dealing with radicals.Let me think. The simplified expression is (frac{x - 3}{x^2}). Since we know (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0), we can express (x^2 = -2x + 6). That might be helpful.So, substitute (x^2 = -2x + 6) into the denominator of our simplified expression:(frac{x - 3}{x^2} = frac{x - 3}{-2x + 6}).Let me factor the denominator:(-2x + 6 = -2(x - 3)).So, the expression becomes (frac{x - 3}{-2(x - 3)}).Assuming (x ≠ 3), which we already checked earlier (since (x) is either -1 ± √7, which are not 3), we can cancel (x - 3) from numerator and denominator:(frac{1}{-2}).So, this simplifies to (-frac{1}{2}).Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So regardless of which root we take (either (x = -1 + sqrt{7}) or (x = -1 - sqrt{7})), the expression simplifies to (-frac{1}{2}). That must be the answer.Let me verify this with actual substitution. Let&#39;s pick one of the roots, say (x = -1 + sqrt{7}).First, calculate the simplified expression (frac{x - 3}{x^2}).Compute numerator: (x - 3 = (-1 + sqrt{7}) - 3 = -4 + sqrt{7}).Compute denominator: (x^2 = (-1 + sqrt{7})^2 = 1 - 2sqrt{7} + 7 = 8 - 2sqrt{7}).So, the expression is (frac{-4 + sqrt{7}}{8 - 2sqrt{7}}). Let&#39;s rationalize the denominator.Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (8 + 2sqrt{7}):Numerator: ((-4 + sqrt{7})(8 + 2sqrt{7})).Denominator: ((8 - 2sqrt{7})(8 + 2sqrt{7}) = 8^2 - (2sqrt{7})^2 = 64 - 28 = 36.So, numerator:First, distribute:-4 * 8 = -32,-4 * 2√7 = -8√7,√7 * 8 = 8√7,√7 * 2√7 = 2 * 7 = 14.So combining terms:-32 -8√7 +8√7 +14 = (-32 +14) + (-8√7 +8√7) = -18 + 0 = -18.Thus, numerator is -18, denominator is 36. So the expression is -18 / 36 = -1/2. Perfect, that works.Let&#39;s check the other root, (x = -1 - sqrt{7}).Numerator: (x - 3 = (-1 - sqrt{7}) - 3 = -4 - sqrt{7}).Denominator: (x^2 = (-1 - sqrt{7})^2 = 1 + 2sqrt{7} + 7 = 8 + 2sqrt{7}).So expression: (frac{-4 - sqrt{7}}{8 + 2sqrt{7}}). Again, rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (8 - 2sqrt{7}):Numerator: (-4 - √7)(8 - 2√7)= -4*8 + (-4)*(-2√7) + (-√7)*8 + (-√7)*(-2√7)= -32 +8√7 -8√7 +14= (-32 +14) + (8√7 -8√7)= -18 + 0 = -18.Denominator: (8 + 2√7)(8 - 2√7) = 64 - (2√7)^2 = 64 -28=36.Thus, the expression is -18 /36= -1/2. So same result.Therefore, regardless of the root, the expression evaluates to -1/2. So that must be the answer.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to do this without substituting, by using the equation (x^2 = -2x +6). Let me check that again.We had (frac{x - 3}{x^2}). Since (x^2 = -2x +6), substitute that into denominator:(frac{x -3}{-2x +6}). Then, factor denominator as -2(x -3). So, (frac{x -3}{-2(x -3)} = -1/2). That&#39;s a much quicker way. So, since x ≠3, cancels out. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s -1/2 regardless.Therefore, the answer is -1/2.Final Answerboxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To simplify and evaluate the expression (left(frac{x-1}{x-3} - frac{x+1}{x}right) div frac{x^2 + 3x}{x^2 - 6x + 9}) where (x) satisfies (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0):1. Rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal:   [   left(frac{x-1}{x-3} - frac{x+1}{x}right) times frac{x^2 - 6x + 9}{x^2 + 3x}   ]2. Find a common denominator and subtract the fractions:   [   frac{x(x-1) - (x+1)(x-3)}{x(x-3)} = frac{x^2 - x - (x^2 - 2x - 3)}{x(x-3)} = frac{x + 3}{x(x - 3)}   ]3. Factor the second fraction:   [   frac{(x - 3)^2}{x(x + 3)}   ]4. Multiply the simplified fractions:   [   frac{x + 3}{x(x - 3)} times frac{(x - 3)^2}{x(x + 3)} = frac{(x - 3)}{x^2}   ]5. Use the given quadratic equation (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0) to substitute (x^2 = -2x + 6):   [   frac{x - 3}{x^2} = frac{x - 3}{-2x + 6} = frac{x - 3}{-2(x - 3)} = -frac{1}{2}   ]Thus, the evaluated value of the expression is (boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to simplify and then evaluate this expression: [(x - 1)/(x - 3) - (x + 1)/x] divided by [(x² + 3x)/(x² - 6x + 9)], where x satisfies x² + 2x - 6 = 0. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe if I take it step by step, I can handle it.First, the problem is asking me to simplify the given complex fraction. Then, after simplifying, I need to evaluate it for values of x that satisfy the quadratic equation x² + 2x - 6 = 0. But since the expression involves division, I need to make sure that none of the denominators in the expression become zero for those x values. Let me check the denominators first.Looking at the original expression, the denominators are (x - 3), x, (x² + 3x), and (x² - 6x + 9). Let&#39;s factor those where possible to see if there are any restrictions. The denominator x² + 3x can be factored as x(x + 3). The denominator x² - 6x + 9 is a perfect square trinomial, so it factors as (x - 3)². So, the denominators are (x - 3), x, x(x + 3), and (x - 3)². Therefore, x cannot be 0, 3, or -3. But since x satisfies x² + 2x - 6 = 0, I need to check the roots of that equation to see if they are 0, 3, or -3.Let me solve x² + 2x - 6 = 0 using the quadratic formula. The roots are [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 24)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(28)]/2 = [-2 ± 2*sqrt(7)]/2 = -1 ± sqrt(7). So, the solutions are x = -1 + sqrt(7) and x = -1 - sqrt(7). Neither of these is 0, 3, or -3. For example, sqrt(7) is approximately 2.645, so -1 + sqrt(7) is about 1.645, and -1 - sqrt(7) is about -3.645. So, 0, 3, and -3 are not among the solutions, which means the denominators are safe. Great, so I don&#39;t have to worry about division by zero here.Now, moving on to simplifying the expression. Let me rewrite the original expression for clarity:[(x - 1)/(x - 3) - (x + 1)/x] ÷ [(x² + 3x)/(x² - 6x + 9)]Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so I can rewrite this as:[(x - 1)/(x - 3) - (x + 1)/x] * [(x² - 6x + 9)/(x² + 3x)]First, let&#39;s handle the numerator of the first fraction: (x - 1)/(x - 3) - (x + 1)/x. To subtract these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (x - 3) and x, so the common denominator would be x(x - 3). Let me adjust each fraction accordingly.For the first term, (x - 1)/(x - 3), I need to multiply numerator and denominator by x to get the denominator to x(x - 3):[x(x - 1)] / [x(x - 3)]For the second term, (x + 1)/x, I need to multiply numerator and denominator by (x - 3):[(x + 1)(x - 3)] / [x(x - 3)]So now, the expression becomes:[ (x(x - 1) - (x + 1)(x - 3)) / (x(x - 3)) ] * [ (x² - 6x + 9)/(x² + 3x) ]Let me compute the numerator in the first fraction:x(x - 1) - (x + 1)(x - 3)First, expand both products:x(x - 1) = x² - x(x + 1)(x - 3) = x(x - 3) + 1(x - 3) = x² - 3x + x - 3 = x² - 2x - 3Therefore, subtracting these two:x² - x - (x² - 2x - 3) = x² - x - x² + 2x + 3 = (x² - x²) + (-x + 2x) + 3 = x + 3So the numerator simplifies to x + 3, and the denominator is x(x - 3). Therefore, the first fraction simplifies to (x + 3)/[x(x - 3)].Now, the entire expression is:[(x + 3)/(x(x - 3))] * [(x² - 6x + 9)/(x² + 3x)]Next, let&#39;s factor both the numerator and denominator of the second fraction. The numerator x² - 6x + 9 is a perfect square trinomial, so it factors into (x - 3)². The denominator x² + 3x can be factored as x(x + 3). So substituting these in, we have:[(x + 3)/(x(x - 3))] * [(x - 3)² / (x(x + 3))]Now, let&#39;s write out the entire expression multiplication:[ (x + 3) * (x - 3)² ] / [ x(x - 3) * x(x + 3) ) ]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: (x + 3)(x - 3)²Denominator: x(x - 3) * x(x + 3) = x²(x - 3)(x + 3)So, the expression simplifies to:[(x + 3)(x - 3)^2] / [x²(x - 3)(x + 3)]Now, let&#39;s cancel out common factors in numerator and denominator. First, (x + 3) cancels out from numerator and denominator. Then, (x - 3) in the denominator cancels with one of the (x - 3) factors in the numerator (since we have (x - 3)^2 in the numerator). Also, the x² in the denominator remains.So after canceling:[ (x - 3) ] / [x²]Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to (x - 3)/x².Okay, so after simplifying the complex fraction, we end up with (x - 3)/x². Now, we need to evaluate this expression for x satisfying x² + 2x - 6 = 0.But maybe instead of substituting the actual roots into (x - 3)/x², which would involve dealing with radicals, perhaps we can find a smarter way using the equation x² + 2x - 6 = 0.Let me recall that if x satisfies x² + 2x - 6 = 0, then x² = -2x + 6. Maybe we can use this to express higher powers of x in terms of lower ones, but here we have x² in the denominator. Let&#39;s see.Our simplified expression is (x - 3)/x². Let&#39;s write x² in terms of x. From the equation x² = -2x + 6.Therefore, (x - 3)/x² = (x - 3)/(-2x + 6). Because x² = -2x + 6.So replacing x² with -2x + 6 gives:(x - 3)/(-2x + 6) = (x - 3)/[-2(x - 3)] = -1/2.Wait, that&#39;s a nice simplification! Because (x - 3) cancels out, leaving -1/2. But hold on, is (x - 3) in the numerator and denominator allowed? Let me check if x - 3 is zero.But from earlier, we saw that x = -1 ± sqrt(7). Let&#39;s compute x - 3 for these roots:For x = -1 + sqrt(7), x - 3 = (-1 - 3) + sqrt(7) = -4 + sqrt(7). Since sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645, this is -4 + 2.645 ≈ -1.355, which is not zero.For x = -1 - sqrt(7), x - 3 = (-1 - 3) - sqrt(7) = -4 - sqrt(7) ≈ -4 - 2.645 ≈ -6.645, also not zero.Therefore, x - 3 is not zero for either of the roots, so cancellation is valid. Therefore, (x - 3)/(-2(x - 3)) simplifies to -1/2.So, regardless of the value of x (as long as x ≠ 3, which we already confirmed), the expression simplifies to -1/2. Therefore, the value of the original expression for x satisfying x² + 2x - 6 = 0 is -1/2.Wait a second, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that again.We had the original expression simplified to (x - 3)/x². Then, using x² = -2x + 6, substitute into the denominator:(x - 3)/(-2x + 6) = (x - 3)/[-2(x - 3)] = -1/2.Yes, because the (x - 3) terms cancel out. So even though x - 3 is not zero, the ratio (x - 3)/(x - 3) is 1, so we have 1/-2, which is -1/2. Therefore, the expression evaluates to -1/2.So, is that the final answer? It seems so. Let me check once more with actual numbers. Let&#39;s take one of the roots and plug it into both the original expression and our simplified version to see if they match.Take x = -1 + sqrt(7). Let&#39;s compute (x - 3)/x² and see if it equals -1/2.First, compute x = -1 + sqrt(7) ≈ -1 + 2.6458 ≈ 1.6458.x - 3 ≈ 1.6458 - 3 ≈ -1.3542.x² = (-1 + sqrt(7))² = 1 - 2*sqrt(7) + 7 = 8 - 2*sqrt(7) ≈ 8 - 5.2916 ≈ 2.7084.So (x - 3)/x² ≈ -1.3542 / 2.7084 ≈ -0.5, which is -1/2. Similarly, for the other root x = -1 - sqrt(7):x ≈ -1 - 2.6458 ≈ -3.6458.x - 3 ≈ -3.6458 - 3 ≈ -6.6458.x² = (-1 - sqrt(7))² = 1 + 2*sqrt(7) + 7 = 8 + 2*sqrt(7) ≈ 8 + 5.2916 ≈ 13.2916.(x - 3)/x² ≈ -6.6458 / 13.2916 ≈ -0.5, which is also -1/2. So both roots give -1/2. Therefore, the simplified expression indeed evaluates to -1/2 for both roots.Therefore, the answer is -1/2.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s verify with the original expression. Let&#39;s take x = -1 + sqrt(7) and compute the original expression step by step.Original expression:[(x - 1)/(x - 3) - (x + 1)/x] ÷ [(x² + 3x)/(x² - 6x + 9)]First, compute (x - 1)/(x - 3):x ≈ 1.6458, so x - 1 ≈ 0.6458 and x - 3 ≈ -1.3542. Therefore, (x - 1)/(x - 3) ≈ 0.6458 / (-1.3542) ≈ -0.477.Then, compute (x + 1)/x:x + 1 ≈ 1.6458 + 1 ≈ 2.6458, so (x + 1)/x ≈ 2.6458 / 1.6458 ≈ 1.608.Subtracting these two: -0.477 - 1.608 ≈ -2.085.Now, compute the denominator [(x² + 3x)/(x² - 6x + 9)].First, x² + 3x: we already know x² ≈ 2.7084, so 2.7084 + 3*1.6458 ≈ 2.7084 + 4.9374 ≈ 7.6458.x² - 6x + 9: x² ≈ 2.7084, -6x ≈ -6*1.6458 ≈ -9.8748, so 2.7084 - 9.8748 + 9 ≈ 1.8336.Therefore, the denominator fraction is 7.6458 / 1.8336 ≈ 4.169.Now, divide the numerator result (-2.085) by denominator result (4.169):-2.085 / 4.169 ≈ -0.5, which is approximately -1/2. So that checks out.Similarly, let&#39;s test the other root x = -1 - sqrt(7) ≈ -3.6458.Compute [(x - 1)/(x - 3) - (x + 1)/x] ÷ [(x² + 3x)/(x² - 6x + 9)].First term: (x - 1)/(x - 3): x ≈ -3.6458, so x - 1 ≈ -4.6458, x - 3 ≈ -6.6458. Thus, (-4.6458)/(-6.6458) ≈ 0.7.Second term: (x + 1)/x: x ≈ -3.6458, so x + 1 ≈ -2.6458. (-2.6458)/(-3.6458) ≈ 0.7257.Subtracting these: 0.7 - 0.7257 ≈ -0.0257.Wait, that&#39;s not matching -0.5. Hmm, maybe my approximations are off due to calculator error. Let me compute more precisely.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a miscalculation here. Let me recast with exact values.Given x = -1 - sqrt(7). Let&#39;s compute the original expression symbolically.First, compute (x - 1)/(x - 3) - (x + 1)/x.Let me compute each term:Term1: (x - 1)/(x - 3)Term2: (x + 1)/xCompute Term1 - Term2.Then, compute the denominator (x² + 3x)/(x² - 6x + 9). Since x² - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2, and x² + 3x = x(x + 3).So, let&#39;s compute Term1 - Term2:[(x - 1)/(x - 3)] - [(x + 1)/x]Common denominator is x(x - 3). So:[ x(x - 1) - (x + 1)(x - 3) ] / [x(x - 3)]Which we already simplified earlier to (x + 3)/[x(x - 3)].Then, dividing by [x(x + 3)/(x - 3)^2] gives:[(x + 3)/(x(x - 3))] * [(x - 3)^2/(x(x + 3))] = (x - 3)/x².So even for x = -1 - sqrt(7), the simplified expression is (x - 3)/x². Then, since x² = -2x + 6, substitute:(x - 3)/(-2x + 6) = (x - 3)/(-2(x - 3)) = -1/2.So regardless of which root we take, the result is -1/2. Therefore, even though when I approximated with x ≈ -3.6458, the manual calculation gave me approximately -0.0257, which is not -0.5, that must be due to miscalculations in the approximate arithmetic.Let me try again with x = -1 - sqrt(7). Let&#39;s compute more carefully.x = -1 - sqrt(7) ≈ -1 - 2.6458 ≈ -3.6458.Compute Term1: (x - 1)/(x - 3) ≈ (-3.6458 - 1)/(-3.6458 - 3) ≈ (-4.6458)/(-6.6458) ≈ 0.7.Term2: (x + 1)/x ≈ (-3.6458 + 1)/(-3.6458) ≈ (-2.6458)/(-3.6458) ≈ 0.7257.Subtract Term1 - Term2: 0.7 - 0.7257 ≈ -0.0257. Hmm, that&#39;s not -0.5. Wait, but this contradicts the symbolic result. There must be an error here.Wait, but maybe my approximate calculation is not precise enough. Let&#39;s compute with more exactness.Let me use exact values. Let x = -1 - sqrt(7). Then:Term1: (x - 1)/(x - 3) = [(-1 - sqrt(7)) - 1]/[(-1 - sqrt(7)) - 3] = (-2 - sqrt(7))/(-4 - sqrt(7)).Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1):(2 + sqrt(7))/(4 + sqrt(7)).Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - sqrt(7)) to rationalize:[ (2 + sqrt(7))(4 - sqrt(7)) ] / [ (4 + sqrt(7))(4 - sqrt(7)) ]Compute numerator:2*4 + 2*(-sqrt(7)) + sqrt(7)*4 + sqrt(7)*(-sqrt(7)) = 8 - 2sqrt(7) + 4sqrt(7) - 7 = (8 - 7) + ( -2sqrt(7) + 4sqrt(7) ) = 1 + 2sqrt(7).Denominator: 16 - (sqrt(7))² = 16 - 7 = 9.So Term1 is (1 + 2sqrt(7))/9.Term2: (x + 1)/x = [(-1 - sqrt(7)) + 1]/[ -1 - sqrt(7) ] = (-sqrt(7))/(-1 - sqrt(7)) = sqrt(7)/(1 + sqrt(7)).Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(7)):[ sqrt(7)(1 - sqrt(7)) ] / [ (1 + sqrt(7))(1 - sqrt(7)) ] = [ sqrt(7) - 7 ] / (1 - 7) = (sqrt(7) - 7)/(-6) = (7 - sqrt(7))/6.Therefore, Term2 is (7 - sqrt(7))/6.Therefore, Term1 - Term2 = (1 + 2sqrt(7))/9 - (7 - sqrt(7))/6.Find a common denominator, which is 18.Convert fractions:(1 + 2sqrt(7))/9 = 2(1 + 2sqrt(7))/18 = (2 + 4sqrt(7))/18.(7 - sqrt(7))/6 = 3(7 - sqrt(7))/18 = (21 - 3sqrt(7))/18.Subtract: (2 + 4sqrt(7) - 21 + 3sqrt(7))/18 = (-19 + 7sqrt(7))/18.Now, compute the denominator of the original expression:[(x² + 3x)/(x² - 6x + 9)].First, x² = (-1 - sqrt(7))² = 1 + 2sqrt(7) + 7 = 8 + 2sqrt(7).x² + 3x = (8 + 2sqrt(7)) + 3*(-1 - sqrt(7)) = 8 + 2sqrt(7) - 3 - 3sqrt(7) = 5 - sqrt(7).x² - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2 = [(-1 - sqrt(7)) - 3]^2 = (-4 - sqrt(7))^2 = 16 + 8sqrt(7) + 7 = 23 + 8sqrt(7).Therefore, the denominator fraction is (5 - sqrt(7))/(23 + 8sqrt(7)).Multiply numerator and denominator by (23 - 8sqrt(7)) to rationalize:Numerator: (5 - sqrt(7))(23 - 8sqrt(7)) = 5*23 + 5*(-8sqrt(7)) + (-sqrt(7))*23 + (-sqrt(7))*(-8sqrt(7)) = 115 - 40sqrt(7) - 23sqrt(7) + 56 = 115 + 56 - 63sqrt(7) = 171 - 63sqrt(7).Denominator: (23)^2 - (8sqrt(7))^2 = 529 - 64*7 = 529 - 448 = 81.So denominator fraction simplifies to (171 - 63sqrt(7))/81 = (57 - 21sqrt(7))/27.Therefore, the entire original expression is [ (-19 + 7sqrt(7))/18 ] ÷ [ (5 - sqrt(7))/(23 + 8sqrt(7)) ] = [ (-19 + 7sqrt(7))/18 ] * [ (23 + 8sqrt(7))/(5 - sqrt(7)) ].Wait, but earlier I thought the denominator fraction was (5 - sqrt(7))/(23 + 8sqrt(7)), but after rationalizing, it&#39;s (171 - 63sqrt(7))/81. However, maybe there&#39;s a better way to compute this.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the fact that after simplifying, the entire expression should be (x - 3)/x² = -1/2, so regardless of how complicated the original expression looks, the result should be -1/2.But since I already did the exact calculation for the numerator part (Term1 - Term2) and got (-19 + 7sqrt(7))/18, and the denominator part after rationalizing is (57 - 21sqrt(7))/27, then dividing them:[ (-19 + 7sqrt(7))/18 ] / [ (57 - 21sqrt(7))/27 ] = [ (-19 + 7sqrt(7))/18 ] * [ 27/(57 - 21sqrt(7)) ] = [ (-19 + 7sqrt(7)) * 27 ] / [ 18*(57 - 21sqrt(7)) ].Simplify 27/18 = 3/2, so:[ (-19 + 7sqrt(7)) * 3 ] / [ 2*(57 - 21sqrt(7)) ].Factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 3*(-19 + 7sqrt(7)).Denominator: 2*3*(19 - 7sqrt(7)) = 6*(19 - 7sqrt(7)).Wait, 57 - 21sqrt(7) = 3*19 - 3*7sqrt(7) = 3*(19 - 7sqrt(7)).Therefore, denominator: 2*3*(19 - 7sqrt(7)) = 6*(19 - 7sqrt(7)).Therefore, the expression becomes:3*(-19 + 7sqrt(7)) / [6*(19 - 7sqrt(7))] = [ - (19 - 7sqrt(7)) ] / [2*(19 - 7sqrt(7)) ].Because numerator is 3*(-19 + 7sqrt(7)) = -3*(19 - 7sqrt(7)), and denominator is 6*(19 - 7sqrt(7)).So:-3*(19 - 7sqrt(7)) / [6*(19 - 7sqrt(7))] = -3/6 = -1/2.Yes! The (19 - 7sqrt(7)) terms cancel out, leaving -1/2. Therefore, even with the exact calculation, it&#39;s -1/2. So even though my approximate arithmetic was leading me astray, the exact calculation confirms it.Therefore, both roots yield -1/2 when substituted into the original expression, confirming that the simplified expression indeed evaluates to -1/2.Hence, the answer is boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}.Final Answerboxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To simplify and evaluate the expression (left(frac{x-1}{x-3} - frac{x+1}{x}right) div frac{x^2 + 3x}{x^2 - 6x + 9}) where (x) satisfies (x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0):1.

Let me try to visualize it first. The equation of the parabola is given as ( y = k^2 - x^2 ). Since it&#39;s a downward-opening parabola (because the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative) with vertex at the top. The vertex should be at (0, ( k^2 )) because the standard form of a parabola is ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ), and the vertex is at ( (-b/(2a), f(-b/(2a)) ) ). In this case, there&#39;s no ( x ) term, so the vertex is just (0, ( k^2 )). The problem says that the rectangle ABCD has sides parallel to the axes. Points A and D are where the parabola intersects the x-axis. Let me recall that the x-intercepts of a parabola ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ) can be found by setting y to 0 and solving for x. So for ( y = k^2 - x^2 ), setting y=0 gives:( 0 = k^2 - x^2 )Solving for x:( x^2 = k^2 )Therefore, ( x = pm k ). Since k is a positive number, the x-intercepts are at (k, 0) and (-k, 0). So points A and D are at (-k, 0) and (k, 0). Wait, but the problem says &quot;A and D are the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis&quot;. So maybe A is (-k, 0) and D is (k, 0). But then, since the rectangle has sides parallel to the axes, the other two vertices, B and C, must be somewhere on the parabola? Wait, no, the rectangle is drawn such that A and D are on the x-axis, and the sides are parallel to the axes, so the other two points B and C must be on the parabola? Because otherwise, if all four points were on the x-axis, it wouldn&#39;t make a rectangle. Let me check.Wait, the problem says &quot;A and D are the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis&quot;. So A and D are on the x-axis, at (-k, 0) and (k, 0). Then the rectangle ABCD must have sides AD and BC parallel to the x-axis, and sides AB and DC parallel to the y-axis. But then if that&#39;s the case, points B and C would be vertically above A and D? But then the rectangle would be between the x-axis and some horizontal line above. But the problem also mentions that the vertex V of the parabola is the midpoint of BC. The vertex is at (0, k²). So the midpoint of BC is (0, k²). That gives us information about the coordinates of B and C.Let me try to sketch this mentally. The rectangle has points A and D on the x-axis at (-k, 0) and (k, 0). Then, points B and C must be vertically above A and D, but such that the midpoint of BC is the vertex of the parabola, which is (0, k²). So if A is (-k, 0) and D is (k, 0), then B and C must be at (-k, y) and (k, y) respectively for some y. Then the midpoint of BC would be the midpoint between (-k, y) and (k, y), which is (0, y). But the midpoint is supposed to be the vertex (0, k²). Therefore, y must be equal to k². Therefore, points B and C are at (-k, k²) and (k, k²). But wait, if that&#39;s the case, then the rectangle would have vertices at (-k, 0), (k, 0), (k, k²), (-k, k²). But this is a rectangle with length 2k (from -k to k on the x-axis) and height k². Then the perimeter would be 2*(2k + k²) = 4k + 2k². But the perimeter is given as 48. So we can set up the equation:4k + 2k² = 48Divide both sides by 2:2k + k² = 24Rearranged:k² + 2k - 24 = 0Solving this quadratic equation:k = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 96)] / 2sqrt(100) = 10So k = [-2 + 10]/2 = 8/2 = 4, or k = [-2 -10]/2 = -12/2 = -6But k is a positive number, so k=4.Wait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The problem states that the vertex V is the midpoint of BC. But in my previous reasoning, BC is from (-k, k²) to (k, k²), so midpoint is (0, k²), which is indeed the vertex. So that works. Then the perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2*(2k + k²) = 4k + 2k² = 48. Solving gives k=4. So is that the answer? But maybe I made a wrong assumption here.Wait, but hold on. The problem says &quot;the vertex, V, of the parabola is the midpoint of BC&quot;. If BC is the top side of the rectangle, then BC is horizontal. The midpoint is (0, k²), which is the vertex. So that part checks out. Then points B and C are at (-k, k²) and (k, k²). But wait, but in that case, the rectangle is from y=0 to y=k², and from x=-k to x=k. But then points B and C are on the parabola? Let me check.The parabola equation is y = k² - x². So if we plug x = k into the equation, we get y = k² - k² = 0, which is point D. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, points B and C are supposed to be part of the rectangle. But if B is (-k, k²) and C is (k, k²), are these points on the parabola? Let&#39;s check. Plug x = -k into the parabola equation: y = k² - (-k)^2 = k² - k² = 0. So point A is (-k,0), which is on the parabola. Similarly, point D is (k,0). But points B and C at (-k, k²) and (k, k²) would not be on the parabola. Wait, the parabola at x = -k is y = 0, so if B is (-k, k²), that&#39;s not on the parabola. So this is a problem.Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong. The rectangle is not extending from the x-axis up to y = k². Then how else can the rectangle be placed?Wait, the problem says that A and D are the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis, so indeed A and D are (-k,0) and (k,0). Then the rectangle ABCD must have sides AD and BC, and sides AB and DC. Since sides are parallel to the axes, then sides AB and DC are vertical, and sides AD and BC are horizontal. So points B and C must be vertically above A and D, but somewhere else. However, the vertex V is the midpoint of BC. The vertex is at (0, k²). So if B and C are points such that their midpoint is (0, k²), then their coordinates must be (h, y) and (-h, y) for some h and y. Because the midpoint would be ((h + (-h))/2, (y + y)/2) = (0, y). So we have (0, y) = (0, k²), so y = k². Therefore, points B and C are (h, k²) and (-h, k²). But since ABCD is a rectangle, points B and C must be connected to points A and D. Since A is (-k, 0) and D is (k, 0), then AB is a vertical line from (-k, 0) to (-k, k²) if h = -k. But no, wait, if B is (h, k²), then AB is the line from A (-k,0) to B (h, k²). But AB has to be vertical, because sides are parallel to axes. Therefore, if AB is vertical, then the x-coordinate of B must be the same as A, which is -k. Similarly, the x-coordinate of C must be the same as D, which is k. Therefore, points B and C are (-k, m) and (k, m) for some m. Then BC is the line from (-k, m) to (k, m), which is horizontal. The midpoint of BC is (0, m), which is supposed to be the vertex V (0, k²). Therefore, m = k². Therefore, points B and C are (-k, k²) and (k, k²). But then, these points are not on the parabola. Because plugging x = -k into the parabola equation gives y = 0, not k². So how is that possible? The problem says &quot;Rectangle ABCD is drawn with sides parallel to the axes so that A and D are the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis&quot;. It doesn&#39;t say that all four points are on the parabola, only A and D. So the other two points B and C are not on the parabola. But then, how does the vertex being the midpoint of BC come into play?Wait, but the problem says &quot;the vertex, V, of the parabola is the midpoint of BC&quot;. So even though B and C are not on the parabola, their midpoint is the vertex. So in this case, since B is (-k, k²) and C is (k, k²), their midpoint is (0, k²), which is indeed the vertex. So that checks out. Then the rectangle has vertices at A(-k,0), D(k,0), B(-k, k²), and C(k, k²). Wait, but that would make the sides AB and DC vertical lines from y=0 to y=k², and sides AD and BC horizontal lines from x=-k to x=k at y=0 and y=k². Then that is indeed a rectangle. But then in that case, the perimeter would be 2*(width + height) where width is the horizontal distance from -k to k, which is 2k, and the height is the vertical distance from 0 to k², which is k². So perimeter is 2*(2k + k²) = 4k + 2k² = 48. Then solving 2k² + 4k -48=0, divide by 2: k² + 2k -24=0. Then discriminant: 4 + 96=100. Solutions: (-2 ±10)/2. So k=(8)/2=4 or k=(-12)/2=-6. Since k is positive, k=4. But earlier, I thought that points B and C are not on the parabola, but the problem didn&#39;t state they need to be. So maybe that&#39;s okay. Then answer is 4. But let me check again.Wait, but the problem didn&#39;t mention points B and C being on the parabola, only A and D. So maybe that&#39;s correct. Then the rectangle is between x=-k and x=k, and y=0 and y=k². The vertex is the midpoint of BC, which is (0, k²). So that works. Then perimeter is 48. So 2*(2k + k²) =48, leading to k=4. So is that the answer? But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify again.Wait, but if the rectangle is between x=-k and x=k, and y=0 and y=k², then points B and C would be at (-k, k²) and (k, k²). However, the problem says &quot;the vertex, V, of the parabola is the midpoint of BC&quot;. The vertex is at (0, k²), which is indeed the midpoint of BC. So that&#39;s correct. Then the perimeter is 2*(length + width) where length is 2k (horizontal) and width is k² (vertical). So perimeter is 2*(2k + k²)=4k + 2k²=48. Then solving 2k² +4k -48=0. Divide by 2: k² +2k -24=0. Quadratic formula: k=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +96))/2= (-2 ±10)/2. So k=(8)/2=4. So k=4. Therefore, the answer is 4. Hmm. That seems straightforward, but let me think again. Wait, maybe the rectangle is not spanning from -k to k. Maybe the rectangle is narrower? Because if the rectangle spans from -k to k on the x-axis, then points A and D are at the x-intercepts. But maybe the rectangle is such that points B and C are somewhere else. Wait, but the problem says &quot;A and D are the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis&quot;. So points A and D are definitely at (-k,0) and (k,0). Then sides AB and DC are vertical, so points B and C must be vertically above A and D. So their x-coordinates are -k and k, respectively, and y-coordinate is some value. Then BC is the top side of the rectangle, from (-k, y) to (k, y). Midpoint of BC is (0, y), which is supposed to be the vertex (0, k²). Therefore, y must equal k². So points B and C are (-k, k²) and (k, k²). Therefore, the rectangle is from (-k,0) to (k,0) to (k, k²) to (-k, k²). Then yes, the perimeter is 2*(2k + k²)=48. Solving gives k=4. Therefore, the answer is 4. So why did I think there was a problem before? Because I thought points B and C needed to be on the parabola, but the problem doesn&#39;t say that. It only says A and D are on the parabola (intersecting the x-axis). So that&#39;s okay. Therefore, k=4 is correct. So maybe the answer is 4. Let me check with another approach.Alternatively, suppose that the rectangle is such that points B and C are on the parabola. But in that case, points B and C would have coordinates (h, k² - h²) and (-h, k² - h²). Then midpoint of BC would be (0, k² - h²). But the midpoint is supposed to be the vertex (0, k²). Therefore, k² - h² = k² =&gt; h²=0 =&gt; h=0. But then points B and C would be at (0, k²), which is the same point, so that can&#39;t form a rectangle. Therefore, points B and C cannot be on the parabola. Therefore, my initial reasoning that they are at (-k, k²) and (k, k²) is correct, and they are not on the parabola. Therefore, the perimeter leads to k=4. Therefore, the answer is 4. So I think that&#39;s the correct solution.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;The given parabola has the equation ( y = k^2 - x^2 ), where ( k ) is a positive number. The x-intercepts of the parabola are at points ( A(-k, 0) ) and ( D(k, 0) ). The vertex of the parabola is at ( V(0, k^2) ).Rectangle ( ABCD ) has sides parallel to the axes, with points ( A ) and ( D ) on the x-axis. The vertex ( V ) is the midpoint of side ( BC ). Since ( V ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), the coordinates of ( B ) and ( C ) must be ( (-k, k^2) ) and ( (k, k^2) ) respectively, ensuring their midpoint is ( (0, k^2) ).The dimensions of the rectangle are:- Length (horizontal): from ( -k ) to ( k ), which is ( 2k )- Height (vertical): from ( 0 ) to ( k^2 ), which is ( k^2 )The perimeter of the rectangle is given by:[2 times (text{length} + text{height}) = 2 times (2k + k^2) = 4k + 2k^2]Given the perimeter is 48, we set up the equation:[4k + 2k^2 = 48]Dividing by 2:[2k + k^2 = 24]Rearranging into a quadratic equation:[k^2 + 2k - 24 = 0]Solving using the quadratic formula ( k = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ):[k = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 10}{2}]This gives two solutions:[k = frac{8}{2} = 4 quad text{or} quad k = frac{-12}{2} = -6]Since ( k ) must be positive, we have ( k = 4 ).Thus, the value of ( k ) is (boxed{4}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the value of k for a parabola given by y = k² - x², where k is positive. The problem involves a rectangle ABCD with sides parallel to the axes. Points A and D are where the parabola intersects the x-axis, and the vertex V of the parabola is the midpoint of BC. The perimeter of the rectangle is 48. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, the parabola equation is y = k² - x². Wait, that&#39;s a downward-opening parabola because the coefficient of x² is negative. The vertex of this parabola is at the origin? Wait, no. Wait, the standard form of a parabola is y = ax² + bx + c. But in this case, it&#39;s y = -x² + k². So comparing to the standard form, the vertex is at (0, k²), right? Because the vertex form for a parabola opening downward would be y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Here, h is 0, so the vertex is at (0, k²). So the vertex V is at (0, k²). Got that.Now, the rectangle ABCD has sides parallel to the axes, so its sides are horizontal and vertical. Points A and D are where the parabola intersects the x-axis. Let me find those points. The x-intercepts occur where y = 0. So setting y = 0 in the equation:0 = k² - x² → x² = k² → x = ±k. Since k is positive, the x-intercepts are at (k, 0) and (-k, 0). So points A and D are at (-k, 0) and (k, 0) or vice versa? Wait, the problem says &quot;A and D are the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis&quot;. So A and D are (-k, 0) and (k, 0). Since it&#39;s a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes, the other two points B and C must be vertically above A and D. Wait, but then how is the vertex V the midpoint of BC? The vertex is at (0, k²). So BC is a horizontal line segment whose midpoint is (0, k²). Let me visualize this.Let me sketch mentally: the parabola opens downward, vertex at (0, k²). The x-intercepts at (-k, 0) and (k, 0). The rectangle ABCD has points A and D on the x-axis at those intercepts. Then points B and C must be above A and D, respectively, to form the rectangle. So if A is (-k, 0), then B would be (-k, some y-coordinate), and D is (k, 0), so C would be (k, same y-coordinate as B). The sides AB and DC are vertical, and sides BC and AD are horizontal. Wait, but AD is the base on the x-axis from (-k, 0) to (k, 0), so that&#39;s length 2k. Then BC is the top side of the rectangle, which would be from (-k, y) to (k, y), but wait, no. Wait, points B and C should be the other two vertices. If A is (-k, 0) and D is (k, 0), then the rectangle would have to have B and C vertically above or below, but since the parabola is above the x-axis between -k and k, and the vertex is at (0, k²), probably B and C are above the x-axis. So A(-k, 0), D(k, 0), B(-k, h), and C(k, h), forming a rectangle. Then BC is the top side from (-k, h) to (k, h), which is length 2k as well, same as AD. Then AB and DC are vertical sides with length h. So the rectangle has length 2k and height h. The perimeter would be 2*(2k + h) = 4k + 2h = 48. So 4k + 2h = 48, which simplifies to 2k + h = 24. So h = 24 - 2k. Hmm.But the problem states that the vertex V of the parabola is the midpoint of BC. The vertex is at (0, k²). The midpoint of BC: since B is (-k, h) and C is (k, h), the midpoint would be ((-k + k)/2, (h + h)/2) = (0, h). Therefore, the midpoint is (0, h). But the vertex V is (0, k²). So (0, h) = (0, k²), so h = k². Therefore, h = k². But from the perimeter, we had h = 24 - 2k. Therefore, substituting h = k² into h = 24 - 2k, we get:k² = 24 - 2kWhich rearranges to:k² + 2k - 24 = 0That&#39;s a quadratic equation. Let&#39;s solve for k:k = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 96)] / 2Because the quadratic formula is k = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a. Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -24.So discriminant is b² - 4ac = 4 - 4*1*(-24) = 4 + 96 = 100.So sqrt(100) = 10.Thus, k = [-2 ± 10]/2.Since k is positive, we take the positive root:k = (-2 + 10)/2 = 8/2 = 4.So k = 4. Let me check if that makes sense.If k = 4, then h = k² = 16.Perimeter would be 2*(2k + h) = 2*(8 + 16) = 2*24 = 48. That matches the given perimeter. Also, the vertex is at (0, 16), and the midpoint of BC is (0, h) = (0, 16), which is correct. The x-intercepts are at x = ±4. The rectangle has vertices at (-4,0), (4,0), (-4,16), (4,16). That&#39;s a rectangle with length 8 (from -4 to 4 on the x-axis) and height 16. Perimeter is 2*(8 + 16) = 48. Seems correct.Wait, but let me make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes in the setup.First, the x-intercepts: yes, when y=0, x=±k. So points A and D are at (-k,0) and (k,0). Then, since the sides are parallel to the axes, the rectangle must have vertical sides from A and D upwards to B and C. Since the rectangle&#39;s top side BC has midpoint at the vertex (0, k²). The midpoint of BC is (0, h), so h = k². Then the perimeter is 2*(2k + h) = 48. So 2k + h = 24. Substitute h with k²: 2k + k² = 24, which gives k² + 2k - 24 = 0. Solving quadratic gives k = 4. All steps check out.Therefore, the value of k is 4. I think that&#39;s the correct answer.Final AnswerThe value of ( k ) is boxed{4}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the parabola equation ( y = k^2 - x^2 ), we need to find the value of ( k ) such that the perimeter of rectangle ( ABCD ) is 48. The vertices ( A ) and ( D ) are the x-intercepts of the parabola, and the vertex ( V ) of the parabola is the midpoint of ( BC ).1. Finding x-intercepts of the parabola:   The x-intercepts occur where ( y = 0 ):   [   0 = k^2 - x^2 implies x^2 = k^2 implies x = pm k   ]   Thus, points ( A ) and ( D ) are ( (-k, 0) ) and ( (k, 0) ).2. Coordinates of points ( B ) and ( C ):   Since ( ABCD ) is a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes, points ( B ) and ( C ) must be vertically above ( A ) and ( D ). Let the y-coordinate of ( B ) and ( C ) be ( h ). Therefore, ( B ) is ( (-k, h) ) and ( C ) is ( (k, h) ).3. Midpoint of ( BC ):   The midpoint of ( BC ) is given by:   [   left( frac{-k + k}{2}, frac{h + h}{2} right) = (0, h)   ]   This midpoint is the vertex ( V ) of the parabola, which is ( (0, k^2) ). Therefore, ( h = k^2 ).4. Perimeter of the rectangle:   The perimeter ( P ) of rectangle ( ABCD ) is:   [   P = 2 times (text{length} + text{width}) = 2 times (2k + h) = 2 times (2k + k^2)   ]   Given the perimeter is 48:   [   2(2k + k^2) = 48 implies 2k + k^2 = 24 implies k^2 + 2k - 24 = 0   ]5. Solving the quadratic equation:   Using the quadratic formula ( k = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) with ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = -24 ):   [   k = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 10}{2}   ]   The positive solution is:   [   k = frac{-2 + 10}{2} = frac{8}{2} = 4   ]Thus, the value of ( k ) is (boxed{4}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>Since the parabola has equation y=k^{2}-x^{2}, then its y-intercept is k^{2}, and so the height of rectangle A B C D is k^{2}.Since the parabola has equation y=k^{2}-x^{2}=(k-x)(k+x), then its x-intercepts are -k and k, so the width of rectangle is k-(-k)=2 k.Since the perimeter is 48 , then 2 k^{2}+2(2 k)=48 or k^{2}+2 k-24=0.Factoring, we obtain (k+6)(k-4)=0.Since k&gt;0, then k=4.ANSWER: 4</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ccc77b65 data-v-22911720><div class="review" data-v-22911720><div class="review-title" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>❓:</span>5.

Hmm, angle bisectors... I remember the formula for the length of an angle bisector. Let me recall it. The formula for the angle bisector t_a corresponding to side a is... Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to write both formulas. Let me check. Yes, for a triangle with sides a, b, c, the length of the angle bisector from the angle opposite side a is given by:t_a = (2bc cos (A/2)) / (b + c)But maybe there&#39;s another formula that doesn&#39;t involve the angle. Let me think. Yes, there&#39;s a formula using the lengths of the sides. It&#39;s something like t_a = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos (A/2). But since I need to express t_a and t_b in terms of a and b, maybe I can use another version.Alternatively, there&#39;s the formula from the angle bisector theorem, which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But how does that help with the length?Wait, here&#39;s another formula for the length of an angle bisector:t_a = (2bc / (b + c)) * cos (A/2)But since we might not know angle A, maybe I should use the formula in terms of the sides. Let me check again. The formula is:t_a = (2bc / (b + c)) * sqrt(1 - ((a^2)/(b + c)^2))Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The length of the angle bisector can be calculated using the formula:t_a = (2bc / (b + c)) * cos (A/2)And using the Law of Cosines, cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc). Then, cos (A/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2] = sqrt[(1 + (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc))/2] = sqrt[(2bc + b² + c² - a²)/(4bc)] = sqrt[((b + c)^2 - a²)/(4bc)].Therefore, t_a = (2bc / (b + c)) * sqrt[((b + c)^2 - a²)/(4bc)] = sqrt[ bc * ((b + c)^2 - a²) ] / (b + c).Simplifying that:sqrt[ bc((b + c)^2 - a²) ] / (b + c) = sqrt[ bc(b² + 2bc + c² - a²) ] / (b + c)Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe there&#39;s a better way to express this.Alternatively, there&#39;s a formula for the angle bisector length given by:t_a = (2bc / (b + c)) * cos (A/2)But since angle A is related to the sides via the Law of Cosines, maybe we can substitute that in. Let&#39;s see.Given sides a, b, c, angle A is opposite side a. So cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc). Then, cos (A/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2] = sqrt[1/2 + (b² + c² - a²)/(4bc)].But perhaps this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can express t_a and t_b in terms of the sides of the triangle. Since we are dealing with two sides a and b, perhaps we need to relate t_a and t_b in terms of a and b. But in a triangle, the third side c is related via the triangle inequality. So maybe c is between |a - b| and a + b. But we need to consider all possible triangles, so c can vary in that interval. Therefore, the problem is to maximize (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) over all possible triangles with sides a, b, c, and find the smallest k that is larger than this maximum. Therefore, k would be the supremum of (t_a + t_b)/(a + b).So, the task is to find the maximum value of (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) over all possible triangles with sides a, b, c. Then k would be that maximum, which is the smallest such k.So, the key is to express t_a and t_b in terms of a, b, and c, then express the ratio (t_a + t_b)/(a + b), and then find its maximum value as c varies between |a - b| and a + b.But perhaps we can normalize the sides. Let me consider scaling the triangle. Since the expression (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) is homogeneous of degree 0 (both numerator and denominator are lengths, so scaling the triangle would not affect the ratio). Therefore, we can fix, say, a + b = 1 to simplify the problem, and then maximize t_a + t_b. Alternatively, we can set a = 1, b = x, and c varies between |1 - x| and 1 + x. But maybe that complicates things.Alternatively, perhaps we can assume a = b. Wait, but maybe not. Because the maximum might occur when a and b are not equal. Hmm. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe we can set a = b. Let&#39;s see what happens in that case. If a = b, then the triangle is isoceles with sides a, a, c. Then, the angle bisectors t_a and t_b would be equal. Let me compute them.If a = b, then in the formula for t_a, which is the angle bisector from angle A opposite side a. Wait, if the triangle is isoceles with sides a, a, c, then angle bisectors from the two equal sides would be equal. Wait, maybe not. Wait, in an isoceles triangle with sides a, a, c, the angle bisectors from the vertices opposite the equal sides would be equal? Hmm, maybe I need to draw a diagram.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s easier to use the formula for the angle bisector. Let&#39;s suppose a = b. Then, in the formula for t_a, which is the angle bisector from the angle opposite side a. Wait, if sides a and b are equal, then the triangle is isoceles, so angles opposite sides a and b are equal. Therefore, the angle bisectors t_a and t_b would also be equal.Therefore, in this case, t_a = t_b. Then, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = (2 t_a)/(2a) = t_a / a. So, if we can compute t_a in this case, then we can find this ratio. Let&#39;s compute t_a.In an isoceles triangle with sides a, a, c, the angle bisector from the vertex opposite side a (which is one of the equal sides). Wait, actually, in an isoceles triangle with sides a, a, c, the two equal sides are a and a, so the base is c. Then, the angle bisector from the apex (the vertex opposite the base c) would split the base into two equal parts, since it&#39;s also the median and altitude. Wait, but angle bisector in an isoceles triangle is the same as the median and altitude. So in that case, the length of the angle bisector (which is also the altitude) is h = sqrt(a² - (c/2)²). But is this the same as t_a?Wait, perhaps not. Wait, t_a is the angle bisector from the angle opposite side a. Wait, in this isoceles triangle, sides are a, a, c. So the angle opposite side a is the angle at the base, which is adjacent to sides a and c. Wait, maybe I&#39;m confused.Wait, in standard notation, the side opposite angle A is a. So if the triangle is isoceles with sides a, a, c, then the two angles opposite the sides a are equal. Wait, but if the sides a are the equal sides, then the base is c, and the angles opposite the sides a are the base angles, which are equal. The angle opposite side c is the apex angle. Therefore, t_a would be the angle bisector from the base angle (opposite side a) which is adjacent to sides a and c.Therefore, in this case, the angle bisector t_a would split the opposite side (which is side c) into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the two segments is a/a = 1, meaning the angle bisector divides the opposite side into equal parts. Therefore, the angle bisector is also the median and the altitude. So yes, in this case, t_a = h = sqrt(a² - (c/2)²). Similarly, t_b = t_a since the triangle is symmetric. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = 2t_a / 2a = t_a / a = sqrt(a² - (c/2)²)/a = sqrt(1 - (c/(2a))²). So in this case, the ratio depends on c.Since c must satisfy the triangle inequality, in the isoceles case, c &lt; 2a, and since sides are a, a, c, then c &gt; 0. So c is between 0 and 2a. Then, the ratio sqrt(1 - (c/(2a))²) is maximized when c is minimized, i.e., c approaching 0. Then, sqrt(1 - 0) = 1. But c cannot be zero, so as c approaches zero, the ratio approaches 1. However, in reality, c has to be greater than |a - a| = 0, but greater than 0. So in this isoceles case, the maximum possible ratio is approaching 1. But wait, but when c approaches zero, the triangle becomes degenerate. So perhaps we need to consider non-degenerate triangles.But in reality, in the isoceles case, as c approaches 0, the angle bisector length approaches a (since the triangle becomes a very thin isoceles triangle with two sides almost overlapping, so the angle bisector would be almost along the side a). Wait, but in the formula t_a = sqrt(a² - (c/2)^2), if c approaches zero, t_a approaches sqrt(a²) = a. Therefore, t_a/a approaches 1. Therefore, the ratio (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) approaches 1 in this case.But is 1 the maximum possible value? Wait, but if we consider other triangles, maybe the ratio can be higher. Wait, in the degenerate case where the triangle becomes a straight line, but then it&#39;s not a triangle anymore. So perhaps the supremum is 1, but it&#39;s never actually reached. But we need to check other triangle configurations.Wait, let&#39;s try another case. Suppose we have a triangle with sides a, b, and very small c. So c approaches 0. Then, the triangle is almost degenerate. Let&#39;s compute t_a and t_b in this case.Using the angle bisector formula. For t_a, when c is very small, the angle opposite side a is approaching 180 degrees, since sides b and c are almost colinear. Then, the angle bisector t_a would bisect this very large angle. Similarly for t_b.But maybe it&#39;s difficult to compute. Alternatively, using the formula for t_a:t_a = (2bc / (b + c)) * cos (A/2)But when c approaches 0, angle A approaches 180 degrees, so A/2 approaches 90 degrees, so cos(A/2) approaches 0. Therefore, t_a approaches 0? Wait, but that contradicts the previous isoceles case. Wait, perhaps in different configurations.Wait, perhaps in the case where c is between a and b. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try specific examples.Let&#39;s take a triangle with sides a=1, b=1, c approaching 0. Then, as c approaches 0, the triangle becomes very skinny. The angle bisectors t_a and t_b would each approach 1, as in the isoceles case. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) approaches (1 + 1)/(1 + 1) = 1.Alternatively, take a triangle with a=1, b=2, c approaching 1 (so c approaches |2 - 1| = 1). Wait, when c approaches 1, the triangle becomes degenerate with sides 1, 2, 1. Let&#39;s compute t_a and t_b.Using the angle bisector formula. For t_a (angle bisector from side a=1):t_a = (2bc cos (A/2)) / (b + c)But when c approaches 1, let&#39;s set c=1. Then, sides are 1, 2, 1. But this is a degenerate triangle. Wait, but c must be greater than |a - b| = 1, so c approaches 1 from above. Let’s set c=1+ε where ε is very small.In this case, angle A is the angle opposite side a=1. Using the Law of Cosines:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (4 + (1 + ε)^2 - 1)/(2*2*(1 + ε)) = (4 + 1 + 2ε + ε² -1)/(4(1 + ε)) = (4 + 2ε + ε²)/(4(1 + ε)) ≈ (4 + 2ε)/(4 + 4ε) ≈ (1 + 0.5ε)/(1 + ε) ≈ 1 - 0.5ε (using Taylor series).Then, cos (A/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2] ≈ sqrt[(1 + 1 - 0.5ε)/2] = sqrt[1 - 0.25ε] ≈ 1 - 0.125ε.Therefore, t_a ≈ (2*2*(1 + ε) * (1 - 0.125ε)) / (2 + 1 + ε) ≈ (4(1 + ε)(1 - 0.125ε)) / (3 + ε) ≈ (4(1 + 0.875ε)) / (3 + ε) ≈ (4 + 3.5ε) / (3 + ε) ≈ (4/3) + (3.5ε - (4/3)ε)/3 ≈ (4/3) + (10.5ε - 4ε)/9 ≈ (4/3) + (6.5ε)/9 ≈ 4/3 + (13/18)ε.Similarly, t_b would be the angle bisector from side b=2. Let&#39;s compute that.t_b = (2ac cos (B/2)) / (a + c)Angle B is opposite side b=2. Using Law of Cosines:cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) = (1 + (1 + ε)^2 - 4)/(2*1*(1 + ε)) = (1 + 1 + 2ε + ε² -4)/(2(1 + ε)) = (-2 + 2ε + ε²)/(2(1 + ε)) ≈ (-2 + 2ε)/(2 + 2ε) ≈ (-1 + ε)/(1 + ε) ≈ -1 + 2ε (using Taylor series).Then, cos (B/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos B)/2] ≈ sqrt[(1 + (-1 + 2ε))/2] = sqrt[(0 + 2ε)/2] = sqrt[ε]. So cos (B/2) ≈ sqrt(ε).Therefore, t_b ≈ (2*1*(1 + ε) * sqrt(ε)) / (1 + 1 + ε) ≈ (2(1 + ε)sqrt(ε)) / (2 + ε) ≈ (2 sqrt(ε) + 2 ε sqrt(ε)) / (2 + ε) ≈ (2 sqrt(ε))/2 = sqrt(ε) (since ε is very small, terms with ε in the denominator can be neglected).Therefore, t_b ≈ sqrt(ε).Therefore, t_a + t_b ≈ 4/3 + (13/18)ε + sqrt(ε). Then, a + b = 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) ≈ (4/3 + sqrt(ε))/3 ≈ 4/9 + sqrt(ε)/3.As ε approaches 0, this ratio approaches 4/9 ≈ 0.444..., which is much less than 1. So in this case, the ratio doesn&#39;t approach 1. Therefore, in different configurations, the ratio can approach different limits.Wait, so in the previous isoceles case, with a = b and c approaching 0, the ratio approaches 1. In this other case, with a=1, b=2, c approaching 1, the ratio approaches 4/9. Therefore, maybe the maximum ratio is achieved in the isoceles case when a = b and c approaches 0, making the ratio approach 1. But is that the case?Wait, but in another configuration, perhaps we can get a higher ratio. Let&#39;s check.Suppose we take a triangle with a=1, b approaching 0, and c approaching 1. Wait, but in this case, the triangle sides would be 1, ε, and 1 - ε, where ε is approaching 0. Wait, but c has to be greater than |a - b| = 1 - ε. Wait, if a=1, b=ε, then c must be greater than 1 - ε and less than 1 + ε. But if we set c = 1 - ε + δ, where δ is small. But this is getting complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s take a triangle with sides a=1, b=1, c approaching 0. Then, as we saw earlier, the ratio (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) approaches 1. So maybe 1 is the supremum. But in reality, as c approaches 0, the triangle becomes degenerate. However, in non-degenerate triangles, the ratio can get arbitrarily close to 1. Therefore, the smallest k satisfying the inequality is 1. But the problem says &quot;the smallest number k such that (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) &lt; k&quot;. If the supremum is 1, then k must be 1, since for any triangle, the ratio is less than 1, and for any k less than 1, there exists a triangle where the ratio exceeds k. Wait, but in the isoceles case, as c approaches 0, the ratio approaches 1. So the supremum is 1, but it&#39;s never actually reached. Therefore, k must be 1. However, let&#39;s verify this with another example.Take an equilateral triangle where a = b = c. Then, angle bisectors are equal. For an equilateral triangle, the angle bisector is also the median and altitude. So t_a = t_b = (sqrt(3)/2) * a. Then, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = (sqrt(3)/2 * a + sqrt(3)/2 * a)/(a + a) = (sqrt(3) a)/(2a) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Which is less than 1. So in this case, the ratio is about 0.866.In the isoceles case with c approaching 0, the ratio approaches 1. So the ratio can approach 1 but never exceed it. Therefore, the smallest k is 1. But wait, let&#39;s check another triangle where a and b are not equal. For example, take a triangle with sides a=1, b=0.5, c approaching 0.5 (so c approaches 0.5 from above). Let&#39;s compute t_a and t_b in this case.Wait, sides are 1, 0.5, c where c approaches 0.5. Let&#39;s set c=0.5 + ε, with ε approaching 0. Then, angle A is opposite side a=1. Using Law of Cosines:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (0.25 + (0.5 + ε)^2 - 1)/(2*0.5*(0.5 + ε)) = (0.25 + 0.25 + ε + ε² -1)/(0.5 + ε) = (-0.5 + ε + ε²)/(0.5 + ε) ≈ (-0.5 + ε)/0.5 ≈ -1 + 2ε (since ε is small).Then, cos (A/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2] ≈ sqrt[(1 -1 + 2ε)/2] = sqrt[ε]. So cos (A/2) ≈ sqrt(ε).Therefore, t_a = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c) ≈ (2*0.5*(0.5 + ε)*sqrt(ε))/(0.5 + 0.5 + ε) ≈ (0.5*(0.5 + ε)*sqrt(ε))/(1 + ε) ≈ (0.25*sqrt(ε))/(1) ≈ 0.25 sqrt(ε).Similarly, angle B is opposite side b=0.5.cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) = (1 + (0.5 + ε)^2 - 0.25)/(2*1*(0.5 + ε)) = (1 + 0.25 + ε + ε² -0.25)/(1 + 2ε) ≈ (1 + ε)/(1 + 2ε) ≈ 1 - ε (using Taylor series).Then, cos (B/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos B)/2] ≈ sqrt[(1 + 1 - ε)/2] = sqrt[1 - ε/2] ≈ 1 - ε/4.Therefore, t_b = (2ac cos (B/2))/(a + c) ≈ (2*1*(0.5 + ε)*(1 - ε/4))/(1 + 0.5 + ε) ≈ ( (1 + 2ε)*(1 - ε/4) ) / (1.5 + ε) ≈ (1 + 2ε - ε/4 - (2ε^2)/4 ) / 1.5 ≈ (1 + (7/4)ε) / 1.5 ≈ (2/3) + (7/6)ε.Therefore, t_a + t_b ≈ 0.25 sqrt(ε) + 2/3 + (7/6)ε. Then, a + b = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) ≈ (0.25 sqrt(ε) + 2/3)/1.5 ≈ (2/3)/1.5 + 0.25 sqrt(ε)/1.5 ≈ (4/9) + (1/6) sqrt(ε). As ε approaches 0, this approaches 4/9 ≈ 0.444. So again, the ratio approaches 0.444, which is less than 1.Wait, so in the isoceles case where a = b and c approaches 0, the ratio approaches 1, but in other cases, the ratio approaches lower values. Therefore, the maximum possible ratio is indeed approaching 1. Therefore, the supremum is 1, so the smallest k satisfying the inequality is 1. But we need to confirm if there are any other configurations where the ratio can approach a higher value than 1.Wait, but when we considered the isoceles triangle with a = b and c approaching 0, we saw that (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) approaches 1. Let&#39;s verify that again.Take a triangle with a = b = 1, c approaching 0. Then, the angle bisectors t_a and t_b would each approach 1. Therefore, t_a + t_b approaches 2, and a + b is 2. Therefore, the ratio approaches 2/2 = 1. But if the triangle is degenerate (c=0), it&#39;s not a triangle anymore, but as c approaches 0, the ratio approaches 1. Therefore, in non-degenerate triangles, the ratio can get arbitrarily close to 1, but never reach or exceed it. Therefore, the smallest k is 1.But let&#39;s verify with another example. Suppose a = b = 1, c = 0.1. Then compute t_a and t_b.First, compute angle bisector t_a. Using the formula:t_a = (2bc cos (A/2)) / (b + c)But in this isoceles triangle, sides a = b =1, c =0.1. Angle A is opposite side a =1. Let&#39;s compute angle A first.Using Law of Cosines:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (1 + 0.01 -1)/(2*1*0.1) = 0.01/0.2 = 0.05. Therefore, angle A = arccos(0.05) ≈ 87.13 degrees. Then, A/2 ≈ 43.56 degrees. cos(A/2) ≈ cos(43.56°) ≈ 0.723.Therefore, t_a = (2*1*0.1*0.723)/(1 + 0.1) ≈ (0.1446)/1.1 ≈ 0.131. Wait, but this contradicts the previous assertion that t_a approaches 1 as c approaches 0. What&#39;s wrong here?Wait, no, in this case, the angle bisector is not the same as the altitude. Wait, in an isoceles triangle with sides a = b =1 and c =0.1, the angle bisector from angle A (opposite side a=1) is not the same as the altitude. The altitude h from angle C (the apex) is sqrt(a² - (c/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0025) ≈ 0.999. But the angle bisector from angle A is different.Wait, maybe I confused which angle bisector. Let&#39;s clarify. In triangle ABC, with sides AB = AC =1, and BC =0.1. Then, angle A is at vertex A, between AB and AC. The angle bisector from angle A would be the same as the altitude and median, splitting BC into two equal parts. Wait, but BC is 0.1, so the angle bisector from angle A would indeed be the altitude, which is h = sqrt(1^2 - (0.05)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.9975) ≈ 0.9987. Therefore, the length of the angle bisector from angle A is approximately 0.9987.But angle bisectors t_a and t_b are from the angles opposite sides a and b. Wait, in standard notation, t_a is the angle bisector from the angle opposite side a. So in triangle ABC, if a = BC =0.1, then the angle bisector t_a is from angle A (opposite side a). But in this case, angle A is between sides AB and AC (which are both length 1). Therefore, the angle bisector from angle A is the same as the altitude, length ≈0.9987.Similarly, angle B is opposite side AC=1. Therefore, angle B is at vertex B, between sides AB and BC. The angle bisector t_b from angle B would bisect angle B and meet side AC at some point. Similarly, angle C is at vertex C, and the angle bisector from angle C would bisect angle C.Wait, maybe I need to correct my notation. In standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C. Therefore, t_a is the angle bisector from angle A, which is opposite side a. But in the isoceles triangle with sides AB = AC =1, BC =0.1, then side a = BC =0.1 is opposite angle A. Therefore, t_a is the angle bisector from angle A, which is the same as the altitude, which is approximately 0.9987. Similarly, t_b is the angle bisector from angle B, which is opposite side AC=1. Therefore, angle B is at vertex B, between sides AB=1 and BC=0.1. The angle bisector from angle B would split angle B into two equal angles and meet side AC at some point. Let&#39;s compute its length.Using the angle bisector formula:t_b = (2 * AB * BC * cos (B/2)) / (AB + BC)First, compute angle B. Using Law of Cosines:cos B = (AB² + BC² - AC²)/(2*AB*BC) = (1 + 0.01 -1)/(2*1*0.1) = 0.01/0.2 = 0.05. Therefore, angle B ≈ 87.13 degrees. Then, angle B/2 ≈43.56 degrees. cos(B/2) ≈0.723.Thus, t_b = (2*1*0.1*0.723)/(1 +0.1) ≈ (0.1446)/1.1 ≈0.131.Similarly, t_a ≈0.9987, t_b≈0.131. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = (0.9987 + 0.131)/(0.1 +1)≈1.1297/1.1≈1.027. Wait, that&#39;s over 1. But this contradicts the previous assumption that the ratio approaches 1. What&#39;s going on here?Wait, this seems like a mistake. If the triangle has sides a=0.1 (BC), b=1 (AC), and c=1 (AB), then in this notation, a=0.1 is opposite angle A, which is at vertex A between AB and AC. The angle bisector t_a is from angle A, which is the altitude as calculated. Then, t_b is the angle bisector from angle B, which is opposite side AC=1. Wait, but in this case, angle B is at vertex B, between sides AB=1 and BC=0.1. The angle bisector from angle B will indeed be a short segment, but adding t_a and t_b, in this case, gives a ratio over 1. That can&#39;t be possible. Wait, but the calculation says (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) ≈1.027, which is over 1. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the supremum is 1. Therefore, something is wrong here.Wait, maybe I messed up the notation. Let&#39;s clarify. In the standard notation:- Side a is BC, opposite angle A.- Side b is AC, opposite angle B.- Side c is AB, opposite angle C.Therefore, in this triangle, sides are:- a = BC =0.1, opposite angle A.- b = AC=1, opposite angle B.- c = AB=1, opposite angle C.Therefore, angles:- Angle A is between AB and AC (at vertex A).- Angle B is between AB and BC (at vertex B).- Angle C is between AC and BC (at vertex C).Therefore, the angle bisector t_a is the bisector of angle A, which is opposite side a=0.1. The angle bisector t_b is the bisector of angle B, opposite side b=1.Therefore, t_a is the bisector of angle A, which in this isoceles triangle is the same as the altitude, length ≈0.9987. t_b is the bisector of angle B, which we calculated as ≈0.131. Then, a=0.1, b=1. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) ≈ (0.9987 + 0.131)/1.1 ≈1.1297/1.1≈1.027. This is greater than 1.But this is a problem. According to this calculation, the ratio can exceed 1. But how is this possible? Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let&#39;s recompute t_b.Given angle B in triangle ABC, with sides AB=1, BC=0.1, angle B. Using the angle bisector formula:t_b = (2 * AB * BC * cos (B/2)) / (AB + BC)We found angle B ≈87.13 degrees, so B/2≈43.56 degrees, cos(B/2)≈0.723. Therefore:t_b = (2 *1*0.1 *0.723)/(1 +0.1)= (0.1446)/1.1≈0.131.But let&#39;s compute t_b using another formula to verify. The angle bisector length can also be calculated using the formula:t_b = (2 * AB * BC * cos (B/2)) / (AB + BC)Alternatively, using the formula from the angle bisector theorem:The length of the angle bisector from angle B to side AC can be calculated with:t_b = (2 * AB * BC * cos (B/2)) / (AB + BC)Alternatively, using the formula in terms of the sides:t_b = (2ac / (a + c)) * sqrt(1 - (b²)/(a + c)^2 )Wait, let&#39;s recall the general formula for the length of an angle bisector. The formula is:t_b = sqrt{ac left(1 - left( frac{b}{a + c} right)^2 right)}In this case, angle bisector from angle B (opposite side AC=1) to side AC. Wait, sides adjacent to angle B are AB=1 and BC=0.1. Therefore, in the formula, the angle bisector length t_b is given by:t_b = sqrt{AB cdot BC left(1 - left( frac{AC}{AB + BC} right)^2 right)}Plugging the numbers:t_b = sqrt(1 * 0.1 * (1 - (1 / (1 + 0.1))^2 )) = sqrt(0.1 * (1 - (1/1.1)^2 )) ≈ sqrt(0.1 * (1 - 0.8264)) ≈ sqrt(0.1 * 0.1736) ≈ sqrt(0.01736) ≈ 0.131. So this matches the previous calculation. Therefore, t_b ≈0.131.Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)≈(0.9987 +0.131)/1.1≈1.1297/1.1≈1.027. So this ratio is indeed greater than 1. But how is this possible? If a triangle can have this ratio greater than 1, then k must be at least 1.027. Therefore, my previous conclusion that the supremum is 1 is wrong. So where is the mistake?Wait, perhaps when a and b are not equal. In this case, a=0.1, b=1. So a is very small compared to b. Maybe in such cases, the ratio can exceed 1. Therefore, the previous assumption that the maximum is 1 was incorrect.This means I need to reconsider the problem. Let&#39;s analyze this example more carefully. If a=0.1, b=1, c=1, then the ratio (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)≈1.027. So this suggests that k must be at least approximately 1.027. But is there a higher possible ratio?Let&#39;s try to make a even smaller. Let’s take a=0.01, b=1, c=1. Then, compute t_a and t_b.First, compute angle bisector t_a from angle A (opposite side a=0.01). In triangle with sides a=0.01, b=1, c=1. So it&#39;s isoceles with sides 1,1,0.01. Then, angle A is opposite side 0.01. Using Law of Cosines:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (1 + 1 -0.0001)/(2*1*1) = (1.9999)/2 =0.99995. Therefore, angle A≈acos(0.99995)≈0.447 degrees. Then, A/2≈0.2235 degrees. cos(A/2)≈0.999975.Therefore, t_a = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c) = (2*1*1*0.999975)/(1 +1)=1.99995/2≈0.999975. So t_a≈0.999975.Angle bisector t_b from angle B (opposite side b=1). Angle B is at vertex B between sides a=0.01 and c=1. Compute angle B using Law of Cosines:cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) = (0.0001 +1 -1)/(2*0.01*1)=0.0001/0.02=0.005. Therefore, angle B≈acos(0.005)≈89.71 degrees. Then, B/2≈44.855 degrees. cos(B/2)≈0.7071.Therefore, t_b=(2ac cos(B/2))/(a + c)= (2*0.01*1*0.7071)/(0.01 +1)=0.014142/1.01≈0.014.Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)= (0.999975 +0.014)/(0.01 +1)=1.013975/1.01≈1.004. So the ratio is approximately1.004, which is slightly above 1. So when a is made smaller, the ratio decreases? Wait, but in the previous example with a=0.1, the ratio was≈1.027, and with a=0.01, it&#39;s≈1.004. So making a smaller reduces the ratio. That&#39;s counterintuitive. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, when a=0.01, sides are 0.01,1,1. The angle bisector t_b from angle B (opposite side 1) is computed as follows:cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) = (0.0001 +1 -1)/(2*0.01*1) =0.0001/0.02=0.005. So angle B≈acos(0.005)≈89.71 degrees. Then, B/2≈44.855 degrees. cos(B/2)≈cos(44.855)≈0.7071.Then, t_b=(2ac cos(B/2))/(a + c)= (2*0.01*1*0.7071)/(0.01 +1)=0.014142/1.01≈0.014. Therefore, t_b≈0.014. Then, t_a≈0.999975.Therefore, total ratio≈(0.999975 +0.014)/1.01≈1.013975/1.01≈1.004. So the ratio is about 1.004. If a is even smaller, say a=0.001, then similarly:cos B = (0.000001 +1 -1)/(2*0.001*1)=0.000001/0.002=0.0005. Therefore, angle B≈acos(0.0005)≈89.97 degrees. B/2≈44.985 degrees. cos(B/2)≈cos(44.985)≈0.7071. Wait, no. cos(45°)=≈0.7071, but cos(44.985) is almost the same. Wait, cos(44.985°)=cos(45° -0.015°)=cos45°cos0.015° + sin45°sin0.015°≈0.7071*0.9999 +0.7071*0.00026≈0.7071*1.00016≈0.7072. So approximately0.7072.Therefore, t_b=(2*0.001*1*0.7072)/(0.001 +1)=0.0014144/1.001≈0.001413. Then, t_a≈0.9999995 (since angle A is even smaller, approaching 0 degrees, so t_a approaches 1). Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)= (1 +0.001413)/(0.001 +1)=1.001413/1.001≈1.000412.So as a approaches 0, the ratio approaches 1. Therefore, in this case, when a is approaching 0, but with b and c fixed at 1, the ratio approaches 1 from above. But in the previous case with a=0.1, the ratio was higher, about1.027. So there must be a maximum somewhere when a is not too small.Wait, this suggests that the maximum of the ratio (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) occurs not when a approaches 0, but at some finite a. Therefore, we need to optimize the ratio with respect to a (or the sides).Therefore, perhaps the maximum occurs when a is around 0.1 or so. To find the exact maximum, we need to set up the problem more formally.Let me consider the general case. Let’s denote the triangle sides as a, b, c. We need to express t_a and t_b in terms of a, b, c, then express (t_a + t_b)/(a + b), and find its maximum.But since c is related to a and b by the triangle inequality, c must satisfy |a - b| &lt; c &lt; a + b. Therefore, for fixed a and b, c can vary in this interval. However, the problem is to maximize (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) over all possible triangles, which can be approached by considering different a, b, c.But this seems too general. Alternatively, maybe we can normalize variables. Let’s assume b =1, and let a be a variable, then c varies between |a -1| and a +1. Then, we can express t_a and t_b in terms of a and c, and then find the maximum.But this might still be complex. Alternatively, perhaps use Lagrange multipliers to maximize (t_a + t_b) under the constraint of triangle inequalities. But this might be difficult.Alternatively, consider a different approach. Let’s use the formula for the angle bisector length.For t_a, the angle bisector from angle A (opposite side a) is given by:t_a = frac{2bc}{b + c} cos frac{A}{2}Similarly, t_b = frac{2ac}{a + c} cos frac{B}{2}Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = frac{2bc}{(b + c)(a + b)} cos frac{A}{2} + frac{2ac}{(a + c)(a + b)} cos frac{B}{2}This expression is quite complicated. Maybe we can use the Law of Cosines to express angles A and B in terms of a, b, c.Recall that:cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}cos B = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}Then, cos frac{A}{2} = sqrt{frac{1 + cos A}{2}} = sqrt{frac{1 + frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}}{2}} = sqrt{frac{2bc + b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{4bc}} = sqrt{frac{(b + c)^2 - a^2}{4bc}} = frac{sqrt{(b + c)^2 - a^2}}{2sqrt{bc}}Similarly, cos frac{B}{2} = sqrt{frac{1 + cos B}{2}} = sqrt{frac{1 + frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}}{2}} = sqrt{frac{2ac + a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{4ac}} = sqrt{frac{(a + c)^2 - b^2}{4ac}} = frac{sqrt{(a + c)^2 - b^2}}{2sqrt{ac}}Substituting these into t_a and t_b:t_a = frac{2bc}{b + c} cdot frac{sqrt{(b + c)^2 - a^2}}{2sqrt{bc}} = frac{sqrt{(b + c)^2 - a^2}}{b + c} cdot sqrt{bc}Similarly, t_b = frac{sqrt{(a + c)^2 - b^2}}{a + c} cdot sqrt{ac}Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = frac{1}{a + b} left( frac{sqrt{(b + c)^2 - a^2}}{b + c} sqrt{bc} + frac{sqrt{(a + c)^2 - b^2}}{a + c} sqrt{ac} right)This is a complicated expression, but maybe we can simplify it.Let’s denote x = c. Then, for fixed a and b, x varies in (|a - b|, a + b). So, the problem is to maximize the expression:f(x) = frac{1}{a + b} left( frac{sqrt{(b + x)^2 - a^2}}{b + x} sqrt{b x} + frac{sqrt{(a + x)^2 - b^2}}{a + x} sqrt{a x} right)But even this is difficult to maximize in general. Alternatively, consider specific cases where a = b, or other relations.Case 1: a = bLet’s assume a = b. Then, the triangle is isoceles with sides a, a, c. Let’s set a = b =1 for simplicity. Then, c ∈ (0, 2).Then, f(c) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{sqrt{(1 + c)^2 -1}}{1 + c} sqrt{c} + frac{sqrt{(1 + c)^2 -1}}{1 + c} sqrt{c} right) = frac{1}{2} cdot 2 cdot frac{sqrt{(1 + c)^2 -1}}{1 + c} sqrt{c} = frac{sqrt{c} sqrt{(1 + c)^2 -1}}{1 + c}Simplify the expression inside:(1 + c)^2 -1 = 1 + 2c + c² -1 = 2c + c² = c(2 + c)Therefore, f(c) = frac{sqrt{c cdot c(2 + c)}}{1 + c} = frac{c sqrt{2 + c}}{1 + c}We need to maximize f(c) for c ∈ (0, 2).Let’s compute derivative of f(c):f(c) = frac{c sqrt{2 + c}}{1 + c}Let’s set g(c) = c sqrt{2 + c}, h(c) =1 + c. Then, f(c) = g(c)/h(c).Compute derivative:f’(c) = (g’(c) h(c) - g(c) h’(c)) / h(c)^2First, compute g’(c):g(c) = c (2 + c)^{1/2}g’(c) = (2 + c)^{1/2} + c * (1/2)(2 + c)^{-1/2} = sqrt{2 + c} + frac{c}{2 sqrt{2 + c}} = frac{2(2 + c) + c}{2 sqrt{2 + c}} = frac{4 + 2c + c}{2 sqrt{2 + c}} = frac{4 + 3c}{2 sqrt{2 + c}}h’(c) =1Therefore,f’(c) = [ frac{4 + 3c}{2 sqrt{2 + c}} (1 + c) - c sqrt{2 + c} *1 ] / (1 + c)^2Simplify numerator:First term: frac{4 + 3c}{2 sqrt{2 + c}} (1 + c)Second term: -c sqrt{2 + c}Combine terms:Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 sqrt{2 + c} to eliminate the denominator:= [ (4 + 3c)(1 + c) - 2c(2 + c) ] / [2 sqrt{2 + c} (1 + c)^2]Compute numerator:(4 + 3c)(1 + c) - 2c(2 + c) =4(1) +4c +3c(1) +3c² -4c -2c² =4 +4c +3c +3c² -4c -2c²=4 +3c +c²Therefore, numerator simplifies to (4 +3c +c²).Thus,f’(c)= (4 +3c +c²) / [2 sqrt{2 + c} (1 + c)^2]Since denominator is always positive for c ∈ (0,2), the sign of f’(c) is determined by the numerator. The numerator is 4 +3c +c², which is always positive. Therefore, f’(c) &gt;0 for all c ∈ (0,2). Therefore, f(c) is increasing on (0,2). Therefore, maximum occurs at c=2.Therefore, maximum f(c) when a = b =1 is at c=2:f(2) = frac{2 sqrt{2 +2}}{1 +2} = frac{2 sqrt{4}}{3} = frac{2*2}{3} =4/3≈1.333.But c=2 is when the triangle is degenerate (a + b =c). But in non-degenerate triangles, as c approaches 2, f(c) approaches4/3≈1.333. But in reality, when c approaches2 from below, the triangle becomes degenerate, so the angle bisectors might behave differently. Let’s compute f(c) when c approaches2.Take c=2 - ε, with ε approaching0.Then, f(c)= (2 - ε) sqrt{2 + (2 - ε)} / (1 + (2 - ε)) = (2 - ε) sqrt{4 - ε} / (3 - ε)≈ (2 - ε)(2 - ε/4) / (3 - ε) ≈ (4 - ε/2 - ε + ε²/4) / (3 - ε) ≈ (4 - 1.25ε) / (3 - ε) ≈ (4/3) - (1.25ε)/3 + ... ≈1.333 -0.416ε.So as ε approaches0, f(c) approaches4/3≈1.333.But this contradicts our earlier example where with a=0.1, b=1, c=1, the ratio was≈1.027. So in the isoceles case, the ratio can approach4/3≈1.333 as c approaches2. But this seems to be the case when a =b=1, c approaches2. However, in reality, when c approaches2, the triangle becomes degenerate, and the angle bisectors might not actually approach4/3.Wait, let&#39;s compute f(c) for a=1, b=1, c=1.9 (close to2). Then,f(c)= (1.9 * sqrt(2 +1.9))/(1 +1.9)= (1.9*sqrt(3.9))/2.9≈1.9*1.9748/2.9≈3.752/2.9≈1.293.Which is less than4/3≈1.333, but approaching it as c approaches2.Therefore, in the isoceles case, the ratio approaches4/3≈1.333 as c approaches2. But this requires verification.Compute t_a and t_b for a=1, b=1, c approaching2.Take a=1, b=1, c=2 - ε. Then, angle A is opposite side a=1. Using Law of Cosines:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (1 + (2 - ε)^2 -1)/(2*1*(2 - ε)) = ( (4 -4ε + ε²) )/(4 - 2ε) ≈ (4 -4ε)/(4 -2ε) ≈ (1 -ε)/(1 -0.5ε) ≈1 -0.5ε (using Taylor series). Therefore, angle A approaches0 degrees. Then, A/2 approaches0 degrees, and cos(A/2) approaches1.Therefore, t_a = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c)≈(2*1*(2 - ε)*1)/(1 +2 -ε)≈(4 -2ε)/(3 -ε)≈(4/3) - (2ε/3) + ...→4/3 as ε→0.Similarly, t_b is the same as t_a due to symmetry, so t_b≈4/3. Then, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)≈(8/3)/2=4/3≈1.333. So yes, in the isoceles case, as c approaches2, the ratio approaches4/3≈1.333.But wait, this contradicts the earlier example where a=0.1, b=1, c=1 gave a ratio of≈1.027. Therefore, in different configurations, the ratio can approach different limits. Therefore, the supremum might be4/3≈1.333, achieved in the isoceles case when a=b and c approaches a + b. Therefore, the smallest k is4/3.But in our previous example with a=0.1, b=1, c=1, the ratio was≈1.027, but in the isoceles case with a=b=1 and c approaching2, the ratio approaches4/3≈1.333. Therefore, this suggests that the maximum possible ratio is4/3.But let&#39;s verify with another example. Take a=1, b=1, c=1.9. Then compute t_a and t_b.Using the angle bisector formula:t_a = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c). Compute angle A first.cos A = (1 + (1.9)^2 -1)/(2*1*1.9)= (1 +3.61 -1)/3.8=3.61/3.8≈0.95. Therefore, angle A≈acos(0.95)≈18.19 degrees. Then, A/2≈9.095 degrees, cos(A/2)≈0.987.Therefore, t_a≈(2*1*1.9*0.987)/(1 +1.9)= (3.7506)/2.9≈1.293.Similarly, t_b≈1.293. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)=2.586/2≈1.293, which is approximately1.293, close to4/3≈1.333 but lower. As c approaches2, this approaches4/3.Therefore, the maximum ratio in the isoceles case approaches4/3. But is this the global maximum across all triangles?Consider another case: a=2, b=2, c approaching4. Then, similar to the isoceles case, the ratio approaches (4/3)*2/4=4/3? Wait, no. Let me compute.If a=2, b=2, c approaching4. Then, the ratio (t_a + t_b)/(a + b). Let&#39;s compute t_a and t_b.Using the same approach as before:t_a = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c)≈(2*2*4*cos(A/2))/(2 +4)= (16 cos(A/2))/6≈(8/3) cos(A/2). But as c approaches4, angle A approaches0 degrees, so cos(A/2)≈1. Therefore, t_a≈8/3. Similarly, t_b≈8/3. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)=16/3 /4=4/3. So regardless of the size of a and b, if a = b and c approaches a + b, the ratio approaches4/3.Therefore, this suggests that4/3 is the supremum of the ratio (t_a + t_b)/(a + b). Therefore, the smallest k is4/3.But to confirm, we need to ensure that no other triangle configuration gives a higher ratio. Let&#39;s try a scalene triangle.Take a=1, b=2, c approaching3 (since c must be &lt;1 +2=3). Compute t_a and t_b as c approaches3.Compute t_a:t_a = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c). Angle A is opposite side a=1.cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (4 +9 -1)/(12)=12/12=1. Therefore, angle A approaches0 degrees as c approaches3. Therefore, cos(A/2)≈1. Thus, t_a≈(2*2*3*1)/(2 +3)=12/5=2.4.Similarly, t_b = (2ac cos(B/2))/(a + c). Angle B is opposite side b=2.cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) = (1 +9 -4)/(2*1*3)=6/6=1. Therefore, angle B approaches0 degrees, cos(B/2)≈1. Therefore, t_b≈(2*1*3*1)/(1 +3)=6/4=1.5.Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b)= (2.4 +1.5)/3=3.9/3=1.3, which is less than4/3≈1.333.So in this case, the ratio approaches1.3 as c approaches3, which is still less than4/3. Therefore, the maximum ratio seems to occur in the isoceles case when a = b and c approaches a + b, giving the ratio4/3.Therefore, the smallest number k such that (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) &lt;k for any triangle is k=4/3.Final AnswerThe smallest such number ( k ) is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest number ( k ) such that (frac{t_{a} + t_{b}}{a + b} &lt; k) for any triangle with sides ( a ) and ( b ), and angle bisectors ( t_a ) and ( t_b ), we need to consider the maximum value of the given expression over all possible triangles.1. Angle Bisector Length Formula:   The length of the angle bisector ( t_a ) corresponding to side ( a ) is given by:   [   t_a = frac{2bc}{b + c} cos frac{A}{2}   ]   Similarly, the length of the angle bisector ( t_b ) corresponding to side ( b ) is:   [   t_b = frac{2ac}{a + c} cos frac{B}{2}   ]   where ( c ) is the third side of the triangle.2. Isosceles Triangle Case:   Consider an isosceles triangle with sides ( a = b ) and ( c ) approaching ( a + b ). In this case, the angle bisectors ( t_a ) and ( t_b ) become very large as ( c ) approaches ( a + b ).3. Maximizing the Ratio:   For an isosceles triangle with ( a = b ) and ( c ) approaching ( a + b ), the ratio (frac{t_{a} + t_{b}}{a + b}) is analyzed. Using the formula for the angle bisector length and simplifying, it is found that as ( c ) approaches ( a + b ), the ratio approaches (frac{4}{3}).4. Verification:   Various configurations of triangles were considered, including degenerate and non-degenerate cases. The analysis showed that the ratio (frac{t_{a} + t_{b}}{a + b}) reaches its maximum value of (frac{4}{3}) in the case of an isosceles triangle where the third side ( c ) approaches the sum of the other two sides.Thus, the smallest number ( k ) such that (frac{t_{a} + t_{b}}{a + b} &lt; k) for any triangle is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the smallest number k such that (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) &lt; k for any two sides a and b of a triangle. The angle bisectors corresponding to sides a and b are t_a and t_b respectively. Hmm, angle bisector lengths... I remember there&#39;s a formula for the length of an angle bisector in a triangle. Let me recall that.The formula for the length of the angle bisector from angle A to side a (which is opposite angle A) is... wait, actually, I might be mixing up the notation here. Let me check. In standard notation, in triangle ABC, the angle bisector from vertex A to side BC (which is of length a) is given by a specific formula. Yeah, the formula is t_a = 2bc cos (A/2) / (b + c). Wait, but here, the problem mentions t_a and t_b corresponding to sides a and b. So maybe if sides are a and b, then t_a is the angle bisector from the angle opposite side a? Or is it the angle bisector of the angle adjacent to side a? Hmm, this needs clarification.Wait, actually, in standard terms, t_a usually refers to the angle bisector of angle A, which is opposite side a. So in triangle ABC, angle A is opposite side a, angle B opposite side b, angle C opposite side c. So the angle bisector from angle A (opposite side a) would be t_a. Similarly for t_b. So in that case, the formula for t_a would be (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c). Similarly, t_b = (2ac cos (B/2))/(a + c). But maybe I need to verify this formula.Alternatively, there&#39;s another formula for the length of the angle bisector which is more in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let me recall that formula. The length of the angle bisector from angle A is sqrt[bc(1 - (a^2)/(b + c)^2)]. Wait, that&#39;s another version. Let me confirm. Yes, there are two formulas: one involving cosine of half-angle and another involving the sides.So, t_a = (2bc)/(b + c) * cos (A/2). And also, t_a = sqrt[bc(1 - (a^2)/(b + c)^2)]. Both formulas should be equivalent. Let me check if they are.Yes, since cos(A/2) can be expressed in terms of the sides. Using the half-angle formula, cos(A/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2]. And cos A can be found from the Law of Cosines: cos A = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(2bc). Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt[(1 + (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(2bc))/2] = sqrt[(2bc + b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(4bc)] = sqrt[( (b + c)^2 - a^2 )/(4bc)].So then, t_a = (2bc)/(b + c) * sqrt[((b + c)^2 - a^2)/(4bc)] = (2bc)/(b + c) * sqrt( ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) / (4bc) ) = (2bc)/(b + c) * ( sqrt( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) ) / (2 sqrt(bc)) ) = (bc)/(b + c) * sqrt( ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) / (bc) )Simplifying inside the sqrt: ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) / (bc ) = ( (b^2 + 2bc + c^2 - a^2 ) / (bc) ) = (2bc + (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)) / bc = 2 + (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/bc.But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let&#39;s see, maybe using the other formula for the angle bisector length is better. The formula t_a = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c). So, given that, perhaps we can find expressions for t_a and t_b in terms of sides a, b, and c.Wait, but in the problem statement, a and b are two sides of the triangle. So the triangle has sides a, b, and c (the third side). Then, t_a is the angle bisector corresponding to side a, which would be from angle A (opposite side a), so t_a = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c). Similarly, t_b = (2ac cos (B/2))/(a + c).But we need to express t_a + t_b in terms of a and b, but we have c involved here. Hmm, since the triangle has sides a, b, c, we can use the triangle inequality, so c can be expressed in terms of a and b as |a - b| &lt; c &lt; a + b. So maybe we need to express everything in terms of a and b and c, then perhaps normalize variables. Maybe set a and b as variables, and c as a variable between |a - b| and a + b. Then, we need to maximize (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) over all possible triangles with sides a, b, c. The smallest k that is larger than all such ratios would be the supremum of (t_a + t_b)/(a + b). So, k is the supremum, and we need to find that.Alternatively, maybe using some substitutions or symmetry. Let me consider normalizing the sides. Let me set a = 1, b = x, and c is between |1 - x| and 1 + x. Then, express t_a and t_b in terms of x and c. Then, compute (t_a + t_b)/(1 + x) and find its maximum over x and c. But this might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps assuming an isoceles triangle, since often maxima or minima occur in symmetric situations. So if we set a = b, then maybe the maximum occurs there? Or maybe when the triangle is degenerate? Wait, but degenerate triangles (where c approaches a + b) might lead to some behaviors. Let me check.First, let&#39;s try to express t_a and t_b in terms of the sides a, b, c. Using the formula t_a = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c). Similarly for t_b. Then, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines to express angles A and B in terms of the sides. So cos A = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(2bc). Then, cos (A/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2] = sqrt[ (1 + (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(2bc) ) / 2 ].Similarly for cos (B/2). Then, substitute these into t_a and t_b. Then, we can get expressions for t_a + t_b in terms of a, b, c. Then, we need to maximize (t_a + t_b)/(a + b). So, this seems like a complicated function of a, b, c with constraints on c. Maybe to simplify, we can fix a and b (since the problem is about any a and b), but c is variable between |a - b| and a + b. So perhaps we can parametrize c in terms of angle between sides a and b? Let me consider angle C between sides a and b. Then, by the Law of Cosines, c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos C. So, if we let angle C vary between 0 and π, then c varies between |a - b| and a + b.Therefore, maybe parametrizing the problem in terms of angle C. Let me try that. Let’s set angle C between sides a and b, so sides a and b form angle C. Then, the third side is c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos C). Then, angles A and B can be found using the Law of Cosines as well. Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines. But perhaps this is getting too involved. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, since angle bisectors can also be expressed in terms of the sides. Wait, there&#39;s another formula for the angle bisector length: t_a = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos (A/2). But angle A can be related to sides via the Law of Cosines. So, cos A = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(2bc). Then, cos (A/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2] = sqrt[(1 + (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(2bc))/2]. Let&#39;s compute that:sqrt[(2bc + b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(4bc)] = sqrt[( (b + c)^2 - a^2 )/(4bc)]Therefore, t_a = (2bc)/(b + c) * sqrt[( (b + c)^2 - a^2 )/(4bc) ] = (2bc)/(b + c) * sqrt( ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) ) / (2 sqrt(bc)) ) = ( sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) ) / (b + c )So, t_a = sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) / (b + c )Similarly, t_b = sqrt( ac ) * sqrt( (a + c)^2 - b^2 ) / (a + c )Therefore, the expression (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) becomes [ sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) / (b + c ) + sqrt( ac ) * sqrt( (a + c)^2 - b^2 ) / (a + c ) ] / (a + b )This is quite a complicated expression. Maybe substituting variables to simplify. Let&#39;s assume that a and b are fixed, and c is variable. Let me consider normalizing a and b by setting a = 1 and b = x, where x &gt; 0. Then, c is in the interval ( |1 - x|, 1 + x ). Then, we can express everything in terms of x and c, but it&#39;s still complex.Alternatively, maybe consider the case when a = b. Let’s set a = b = 1. Then, the triangle is isoceles with sides 1, 1, c. Then c is in (0, 2). Then, compute t_a and t_b (which would be equal in this case) and then compute (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = (2 t_a)/2 = t_a /1 = t_a. So, in this case, the ratio is equal to t_a. Let&#39;s compute t_a for a = b = 1. Then, angle C is between 0 and π, c = 2 sin (C/2), since in an isoceles triangle with sides 1,1,c, c = 2 sin (C/2). Wait, angle C is the angle between the two sides of length 1, so using Law of Cosines: c^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2*1*1*cos C = 2 - 2 cos C, so c = 2 sin (C/2). Then, angle A = angle B = (π - C)/2.Then, t_a is the angle bisector from angle A to side a (which is opposite angle A). Wait, in the isoceles triangle, angle A is at the base, opposite side a (but in our case, sides a and b are both 1, so maybe confusion here). Wait, in this case, sides a and b are both 1, and side c is the base. Then, the angle bisectors t_a and t_b would be from the two equal angles to the sides a and b. Wait, maybe not. Wait, if a and b are the sides, then the angle bisectors t_a and t_b would be from the angles opposite sides a and b. But in the isoceles triangle, sides a and b are equal, so angles opposite them are equal. Therefore, t_a and t_b would be equal. Let&#39;s compute t_a.Using the formula t_a = sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) / (b + c ). Since a = 1, b = 1, c is variable. So substituting:t_a = sqrt(1 * c) * sqrt( (1 + c)^2 - 1^2 ) / (1 + c )= sqrt(c) * sqrt( (1 + 2c + c^2) - 1 ) / (1 + c )= sqrt(c) * sqrt(2c + c^2) / (1 + c )= sqrt(c) * sqrt(c(c + 2)) / (1 + c )= sqrt(c) * sqrt(c) * sqrt(c + 2) / (1 + c )= c * sqrt(c + 2) / (1 + c )Therefore, t_a = c * sqrt(c + 2)/(1 + c )But c = 2 sin (C/2), where C is the vertex angle. Alternatively, since c is between 0 and 2, maybe we can express t_a in terms of c:t_a = c * sqrt(c + 2)/(c + 1 )Then, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = 2 t_a / 2 = t_a. So in the isoceles case, the ratio simplifies to t_a = c * sqrt(c + 2)/(c + 1 ). So, we need to find the maximum value of this expression over c ∈ (0, 2). Let me compute the derivative of this function with respect to c to find its maximum.Let’s denote f(c) = c * sqrt(c + 2)/(c + 1 )First, let me square f(c) to make differentiation easier:f(c)^2 = c^2 (c + 2)/(c + 1)^2Let’s compute derivative of f(c)^2 with respect to c:d/dc [c^2 (c + 2)/(c + 1)^2 ]Let me use the quotient rule:Let’s set numerator = c^2 (c + 2), denominator = (c + 1)^2Derivative is [ (2c(c + 2) + c^2(1)) * (c + 1)^2 - c^2(c + 2) * 2(c + 1) ] / (c + 1)^4Simplify numerator:First, compute derivative of numerator:d/dc [c^2 (c + 2)] = 2c(c + 2) + c^2(1) = 2c^2 + 4c + c^2 = 3c^2 + 4cThen, derivative of denominator is 2(c + 1)So applying the quotient rule:[ (3c^2 + 4c)(c + 1)^2 - c^2(c + 2)(2)(c + 1) ] / (c + 1)^4Factor out (c + 1):[ (3c^2 + 4c)(c + 1) - 2c^2(c + 2) ] / (c + 1)^3Expand the terms in the numerator:First term: (3c^2 + 4c)(c + 1) = 3c^3 + 3c^2 + 4c^2 + 4c = 3c^3 + 7c^2 + 4cSecond term: -2c^2(c + 2) = -2c^3 - 4c^2Combine them:3c^3 + 7c^2 + 4c - 2c^3 - 4c^2 = (3c^3 - 2c^3) + (7c^2 - 4c^2) + 4c = c^3 + 3c^2 + 4cTherefore, the derivative of f(c)^2 is (c^3 + 3c^2 + 4c)/(c + 1)^3Therefore, derivative of f(c) is (1/(2f(c))) * (c^3 + 3c^2 + 4c)/(c + 1)^3 )But since f(c) is positive for c ∈ (0,2), the sign of the derivative is determined by the numerator (c^3 + 3c^2 + 4c). Since c &gt; 0, this numerator is always positive. Therefore, f(c)^2 is increasing on (0,2), so f(c) is also increasing on (0,2). Therefore, the maximum of f(c) occurs at c = 2. So when c approaches 2, f(c) approaches 2 * sqrt(2 + 2)/(2 + 1) = 2 * sqrt(4)/3 = 2 * 2 /3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...But wait, c approaches 2, but when c = 2, the triangle becomes degenerate (a straight line). However, in the limit as c approaches 2 from below, f(c) approaches 4/3. Therefore, in the isoceles case, the maximum ratio is 4/3. However, we need to check whether this is indeed the global maximum over all possible triangles, not just isoceles ones.But perhaps 4/3 is the maximum value. However, let me test another case. Let&#39;s consider a very &quot;flat&quot; triangle where c approaches a + b. Let’s take a = 1, b = 1, and c approaches 2. Then, as c approaches 2, the triangle becomes degenerate, and the angle bisectors t_a and t_b would approach certain limits.But in the isoceles case, we saw that the ratio approaches 4/3. But maybe in another configuration, the ratio can be higher?Let me consider a different triangle. For example, take a = 1, b approaching 0. So very small b. Then, c must be greater than 1 - b, approaching 1 from above. Let&#39;s see what happens to (t_a + t_b)/(a + b). If b approaches 0, then a + b approaches 1, and c approaches 1. Let&#39;s compute t_a and t_b in this case.First, when b approaches 0, the triangle becomes very skinny with sides 1, ~0, and ~1. The angle bisector t_a is from the angle opposite side a (which is the angle between sides b and c). Since b is approaching 0, angle opposite a (which is angle A) approaches π. So, the angle bisector t_a would bisect this angle approaching π, so it would be a very long bisector? Wait, but side a is 1, so angle A is opposite side a, which is 1. Wait, if sides b and c approach 0 and 1, then side a is 1, so Law of Cosines: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A. If b approaches 0, and c approaches 1, then 1 = 0 + 1 - 0 =&gt; 1 = 1, which is true, but angle A approaches 0? Wait, this is confusing.Wait, maybe better to use the angle bisector formula. Let&#39;s take a = 1, b approaching 0, c ≈ 1. Then, t_a is the angle bisector from angle A (opposite side a =1). In this case, sides adjacent to angle A are b and c. As b approaches 0, angle A is between sides b and c. If b approaches 0 and c approaches 1, then angle A approaches 0 degrees. So the angle bisector t_a would be very small? Let&#39;s compute t_a using the formula t_a = 2bc cos (A/2)/(b + c). As b approaches 0, c approaches 1. Then, angle A approaches 0, so cos(A/2) approaches cos(0) = 1. Therefore, t_a ≈ 2*0*1*1 / (0 + 1) = 0. So t_a approaches 0. Similarly, t_b is the angle bisector from angle B, which is opposite side b (approaching 0). So angle B is approaching π, since side b is approaching 0. The angle bisector t_b would bisect angle B, which is approaching π, so it would split into two angles approaching π/2. Let&#39;s use the formula for t_b: t_b = 2ac cos (B/2)/(a + c). Here, a =1, c ≈1, angle B approaching π. So cos(B/2) approaches cos(π/2) = 0. Therefore, t_b ≈ 2*1*1*0/(1 +1 ) = 0. So both t_a and t_b approach 0 as b approaches 0. Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) ≈ 0/(1 +0) = 0. So in this case, the ratio is approaching 0. Therefore, the maximum isn&#39;t achieved here.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider a right-angled triangle. Let&#39;s take a = 1, b = 1, c = sqrt(2). Then, compute t_a and t_b. First, angle bisectors in a right-angled triangle. Let&#39;s use the formula for t_a. In this case, sides a =1, b=1, c=sqrt(2). Then, angle opposite side a is angle A, which is 45 degrees since it&#39;s a right-angled isoceles triangle. So, t_a = 2bc cos(A/2)/(b + c). So, substituting values:t_a = 2*1*sqrt(2)*cos(45°/2)/(1 + sqrt(2))Similarly, cos(45°/2) = cos(22.5°) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.9239.Therefore, t_a = 2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2)/(1 + sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/(1 + sqrt(2))Similarly, t_b is the same as t_a due to symmetry.Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) = 2 t_a /2 = t_a. Let&#39;s compute t_a numerically:sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142, sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)) ≈ sqrt(2 + 1.4142) ≈ sqrt(3.4142) ≈ 1.8478Therefore, t_a ≈ 1.4142 * 1.8478 / (1 + 1.4142 ) ≈ (2.613)/2.4142 ≈ 1.082. So approximately 1.082, which is less than 4/3 ≈ 1.333. So in the right-angled isoceles triangle, the ratio is about 1.082, which is lower than 4/3.So far, the maximum ratio seems to be approaching 4/3 in the degenerate isoceles triangle. Let&#39;s check another case. Suppose we take a triangle where angle C is very small, making sides a and b almost colinear. Let’s take a =1, b =1, angle C approaching 0. Then, side c approaches 0. Wait, but in this case, angle A and angle B approach π/2. Wait, if angle C approaches 0, then angles A and B approach (π - 0)/2 = π/2. So it&#39;s a very skinny triangle with two right angles? No, wait, if angle C approaches 0, then sides a and b are almost overlapping, so angles A and B would approach (π - 0)/2 = π/2 each. So the triangle becomes two right angles connected by a very small side c. Then, compute t_a and t_b. Let&#39;s see.Using the formula t_a = sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ) / (b + c )If a =1, b =1, c approaching 0. Then, t_a = sqrt(1 * 0) * sqrt( (1 + 0)^2 -1^2 ) / (1 +0 ) = 0 * sqrt(1 -1)/1 = 0. Similarly, t_b =0. So the ratio (0 +0)/(1 +1 )=0. Not helpful.Alternatively, take a triangle with sides a =1, b =2, c in (1,3). Let&#39;s compute for c =2. So triangle sides 1,2,2. Then compute t_a and t_b.First, t_a is the angle bisector from angle A (opposite side a=1). The formula: t_a = 2bc cos(A/2)/(b + c ). Here, b=2, c=2. So t_a = 2*2*2*cos(A/2)/(2 + 2) = 8 cos(A/2)/4 = 2 cos(A/2). Similarly, angle A can be found using Law of Cosines: cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (4 +4 -1)/8 =7/8. Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos A)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 +7/8)/2 ) = sqrt(15/16 ) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682. Therefore, t_a =2 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15)/2 ≈1.936.Similarly, t_b is the angle bisector from angle B (opposite side b=2). Using the formula t_b =2ac cos(B/2)/(a + c ). Here, a=1, c=2. So t_b=2*1*2*cos(B/2)/(1 +2 )=4 cos(B/2)/3. Angle B: cos B=(a² +c² -b²)/(2ac )=(1 +4 -4)/4=1/4. Therefore, cos(B/2)=sqrt( (1 +1/4)/2 )=sqrt(5/8 )=sqrt(10)/4≈0.7906. Therefore, t_b=4*(sqrt(10)/4)/3= sqrt(10)/3≈1.054.Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b )=(sqrt(15)/2 + sqrt(10)/3 )/(1 +2 )=( approx (1.936 +1.054 )/3≈3/3=1). Wait, exact calculation: sqrt(15)/2 ≈3.872/2≈1.936, sqrt(10)/3≈3.162/3≈1.054. Sum≈1.936 +1.054≈2.99≈3. Then, divided by 3, gives≈1. So the ratio is≈1 in this case. Which is less than 4/3.Hmm, interesting. So in this case, the ratio is about 1. So maybe the maximum ratio is indeed 4/3, as in the isoceles case.Alternatively, let&#39;s check another triangle. Suppose we take a triangle with sides a=1, b=1, c approaching 2. So very close to degenerate. Then, angle bisectors t_a and t_b. As c approaches 2, angles A and B approach 0. Then, t_a and t_b can be calculated. From previous calculation, in the isoceles case, t_a approaches 4/3. So, (t_a + t_b)/(a + b )= 2t_a /2= t_a approaches 4/3. So in this case, the ratio approaches 4/3. But is this the maximum?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider a triangle where a ≠ b. Let&#39;s take a=1, b=2, and c approaching 3 (since c &lt;a +b=3). Let’s compute the ratio as c approaches 3. Let me compute t_a and t_b.First, when a=1, b=2, c approaching 3. The triangle becomes very elongated, with angle opposite side c approaching π.Compute t_a: the angle bisector from angle A (opposite side a=1). Using formula t_a=2bc cos(A/2)/(b +c ). Here, b=2, c approaching3, angle A approaching 0. So cos(A/2 ) approaches 1. Therefore, t_a≈2*2*3*1/(2 +3 )=12/5=2.4.Similarly, t_b is the angle bisector from angle B (opposite side b=2). So t_b=2ac cos(B/2)/(a +c ). Here, a=1, c approaching3. Angle B approaching angle between sides a=1 and c approaching3. As c approaches3, angle B approaches π - angle A - angle C. But angle A approaches0, angle C also approaches0. Wait, but as c approaches3, the triangle becomes degenerate with sides 1,2,3. Wait, no, 1 +2=3, so it&#39;s degenerate. So angle B is the angle opposite side b=2. When c approaches3, angles A and C approach0, and angle B approachesπ.Therefore, angle B approachingπ. So cos(B/2 ) approaches cos(π/2)=0. Therefore, t_b≈2*1*3*0/(1 +3 )=0. So t_b approaches0.Therefore, (t_a + t_b)/(a +b )≈(2.4 +0)/3≈0.8. Which is less than 4/3≈1.333. So even as c approaches3, the ratio is only 0.8. Hence, the maximum ratio in this case is lower than 4/3.Therefore, in all the cases I’ve checked so far, the maximum ratio seems to approach 4/3 when the triangle is isoceles and becomes degenerate (c approaching 2a when a=b). So maybe 4/3 is indeed the maximum value. Therefore, the smallest k satisfying the condition would be k=4/3.But let me check another case where a ≠ b. Let&#39;s take a=1, b=2, and try to compute t_a and t_b for some c. Let&#39;s pick c=2. So triangle sides 1,2,2. We computed this earlier and found the ratio≈1. Let&#39;s try c=1.5. So sides 1,2,1.5. Check if this is valid: 1 +1.5=2.5&gt;2, 1 +2=3&gt;1.5, 2 +1.5=3.5&gt;1. So valid.Compute t_a and t_b. First, compute angles using Law of Cosines.For angle A (opposite side a=1):cos A=(b² +c² -a²)/(2bc )=(4 +2.25 -1)/(2*2*1.5 )=(5.25)/6≈0.875. So angle A≈acos(0.875 )≈28.955 degrees. Then, cos(A/2 )≈cos(14.4775 )≈0.9703.t_a=2bc cos(A/2 )/(b +c )=2*2*1.5*0.9703/(2 +1.5 )= (6*0.9703 )/3.5≈5.8218/3.5≈1.663.For angle B (opposite side b=2):cos B=(a² +c² -b²)/(2ac )=(1 +2.25 -4)/(2*1*1.5 )=( -0.75 )/3= -0.25. So angle B≈acos(-0.25 )≈104.478 degrees. Then, cos(B/2 )≈cos(52.239 )≈0.6157.t_b=2ac cos(B/2 )/(a +c )=2*1*1.5*0.6157/(1 +1.5 )=(3*0.6157 )/2.5≈1.8471/2.5≈0.7388.Therefore, (t_a +t_b )/(a +b )≈(1.663 +0.7388 )/(1 +2 )≈2.4018/3≈0.8006. Still less than 4/3≈1.333.Alternatively, let&#39;s try a triangle where a=1, b=3, c approaching4. Wait, but c must be less than a +b=4. If c approaches4, then angle opposite to c approachesπ. Compute t_a and t_b.t_a=2bc cos(A/2 )/(b +c ). Here, b=3, c approaching4, angle A approaching0. So cos(A/2 )≈1. So t_a≈2*3*4*1/(3 +4 )=24/7≈3.428. t_b=2ac cos(B/2 )/(a +c ). Here, a=1, c approaching4, angle B approachingπ. So cos(B/2 )≈0. Therefore, t_b≈0. So (t_a +t_b )/(a +b )≈24/7 /4≈24/28≈0.857. Still less than 4/3.Alternatively, take a triangle where sides a=1, b=3, c=3. So isoceles triangle with sides 1,3,3. Compute t_a and t_b.t_a is angle bisector from angle A (opposite side a=1). Using formula: t_a=2bc cos(A/2 )/(b +c ). Here, b=3, c=3. So t_a=2*3*3*cos(A/2 )/(3 +3 )=18 cos(A/2 )/6=3 cos(A/2 ). Compute angle A: cos A=(b² +c² -a² )/(2bc )=(9 +9 -1 )/(18 )=(17)/18≈0.9444. Then, cos(A/2 )=sqrt( (1 +0.9444)/2 )=sqrt(0.9722 )≈0.986. So t_a≈3*0.986≈2.958.t_b is angle bisector from angle B (opposite side b=3). Since triangle is isoceles with sides 3,3,1, angle B is equal for both. Compute t_b=2ac cos(B/2 )/(a +c ). Here, a=1, c=3. So t_b=2*1*3*cos(B/2 )/(1 +3 )=6 cos(B/2 )/4= (3/2) cos(B/2 ). Compute angle B: cos B=(a² +c² -b² )/(2ac )=(1 +9 -9 )/(2*1*3 )=1/6≈0.1667. So cos(B/2 )=sqrt( (1 +0.1667 )/2 )=sqrt(0.5833 )≈0.7637. Therefore, t_b≈(3/2 )*0.7637≈1.1456.Thus, (t_a +t_b )/(a +b )≈(2.958 +1.1456 )/(1 +3 )≈4.1036/4≈1.0259. Still less than 4/3≈1.333.So far, all examples I’ve tried give ratios less than 4/3, with the maximum approaching 4/3 in the isoceles case as the triangle becomes degenerate. Therefore, it seems plausible that 4/3 is the supremum of (t_a + t_b)/(a + b), hence the smallest k satisfying the inequality is 4/3.But to be thorough, let me attempt to prove that (t_a + t_b)/(a + b) &lt; 4/3 for any triangle, and that 4/3 is indeed the minimal such k.First, let&#39;s consider the formula for t_a and t_b. Using the formula:t_a = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c )t_b = (2ac cos (B/2))/(a + c )Our goal is to maximize (t_a + t_b)/(a + b). Let&#39;s denote this ratio as R.So R = [ (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c ) + (2ac cos (B/2))/(a + c ) ] / (a + b )To maximize R, we need to find its maximum over all possible triangles with sides a, b, c. To do this, perhaps we can express angles A and B in terms of sides and use some inequalities.Alternatively, using the AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz. But given the complexity of R, it might be challenging.Alternatively, note that in the case where a = b and the triangle becomes degenerate (c approaching 2a), R approaches 4/3. So to show that R &lt; 4/3 for all triangles and that the supremum is 4/3.Alternatively, let&#39;s parametrize the triangle in terms of angles and use trigonometric identities.Alternatively, use substitution variables to reduce the problem to fewer variables. For example, set a = 1, b = t, and c = x, with t &gt;0 and |t -1| &lt;x &lt; t +1. Then, express R in terms of t and x, and find its maximum. But this is still complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s use Lagrange multipliers to maximize R under the constraints imposed by the triangle inequalities.But this might be quite involved. Let me outline the steps:Define variables a, b, c. We need to maximize R = [t_a + t_b]/(a + b)Subject to triangle inequalities: a + b &gt; c, a + c &gt; b, b + c &gt; a, and a, b, c &gt;0.Express t_a and t_b in terms of a, b, c:t_a = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c )t_b = (2ac cos (B/2))/(a + c )But angles A and B can be expressed in terms of sides via the Law of Cosines:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc )Similarly, cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac )Then, cos(A/2 ) = sqrt[(1 + cos A)/2] = sqrt[ (1 + (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc )) /2 ]Similarly for cos(B/2 )This seems too complex to handle directly. Alternatively, consider substituting variables to reduce the number of variables. For example, set a = b =1, then c ∈ (0, 2), and we saw that R approaches 4/3 as c approaches 2. But this is just the isoceles case.Alternatively, assume that c is fixed and express R in terms of angles. But this is still not straightforward.Alternatively, consider that in any triangle, the sum of the angle bisectors can be maximized when the triangle is degenerate. But angle bisectors might not necessarily be maximized in the degenerate case, but in our previous example, when the triangle becomes degenerate (sides a = b =1, c approaching 2), the ratio R approaches 4/3. However, in other degenerate cases, like sides a=1, b approaching0, the ratio approaches0. So the maximum seems to occur in a specific degenerate case.Alternatively, use the formula for the angle bisector in terms of sides:t_a = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c )We can use the identity cos(A/2 ) = sqrt[ (1 + cos A)/2 ]Therefore, t_a = (2bc / (b + c )) * sqrt[ (1 + cos A ) /2 ]Similarly, t_b = (2ac / (a + c )) * sqrt[ (1 + cos B ) /2 ]But cos A and cos B can be written in terms of the sides:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc )cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac )Therefore,t_a = (2bc / (b + c )) * sqrt[ (1 + (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc )) /2 ]= (2bc / (b + c )) * sqrt[ (2bc + b² + c² - a² ) / (4bc ) ]= (2bc / (b + c )) * sqrt( ( (b + c )² - a² ) / (4bc ) )= (2bc / (b + c )) * ( sqrt( (b + c )² - a² ) / (2 sqrt(bc )) )= ( bc / (b + c )) * ( sqrt( (b + c )² - a² ) / sqrt(bc ) )= sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c )² - a² ) / (b + c )Similarly for t_b.Therefore, t_a + t_b = sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c )² - a² ) / (b + c ) + sqrt( ac ) * sqrt( (a + c )² - b² ) / (a + c )And R = [sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c )² - a² ) / (b + c ) + sqrt( ac ) * sqrt( (a + c )² - b² ) / (a + c ) ] / (a + b )This is quite a complex expression. Maybe we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the two terms in the numerator.Let’s denote term1 = sqrt( bc ) * sqrt( (b + c )² - a² ) / (b + c )term2 = sqrt( ac ) * sqrt( (a + c )² - b² ) / (a + c )Then, R = (term1 + term2)/(a + b )But applying Cauchy-Schwarz:term1 + term2 ≤ sqrt( (term1² + term2² ) * 2 )But not sure if this helps. Alternatively, note that in the isoceles case, term1 = term2, and we can check if the maximum occurs there.Alternatively, consider the case where c is fixed, and we need to maximize term1 + term2. But this seems difficult.Alternatively, make a substitution: let’s set a = b. Then, in this case, term1 and term2 become symmetric. Let’s set a = b =1, and c ∈ (0,2). Then, as we saw earlier, R approaches 4/3 as c approaches2. So in this symmetric case, we attain the ratio 4/3.But to confirm that this is indeed the maximum, we need to ensure that in any other triangle, the ratio R is less than 4/3.Suppose we take a triangle where a ≠ b, but c is such that the expression term1 + term2 is maximized. However, proving this requires calculus and possibly showing that the maximum occurs when a = b.Alternatively, we can use substitution variables. Let’s set x = a + b, y = ab, and express R in terms of x and y. But this might not simplify things.Alternatively, consider that the maximum of R occurs when the triangle is isoceles. This is a common scenario in optimization problems for triangles, where symmetry often gives extrema.If we can prove that for fixed a + b, the expression R is maximized when a = b, then it would follow that the maximum ratio is 4/3. Alternatively, fix a + b = constant and show that R is maximized when a = b.Let me assume that a + b = 2 (for normalization), then we need to maximize R over a and b with a + b =2 and c ∈ (0, 2). Let’s set a =1 + t, b=1 - t, where t ∈ (-1,1). Then, c ∈ ( |a - b|, a + b ) = (2t, 2 ). Wait, no, |a - b| = |2t|, so c ∈ (2|t|, 2 ). Then, express R in terms of t and c. But this still might not help.Alternatively, fix a + b =2 and analyze R as a function of t (the difference between a and b) and c. But this could be quite involved.Alternatively, use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Suppose we fix a and b, and consider c as a variable. We need to maximize R with respect to c. Alternatively, fix a and b, then find the value of c that maximizes R.But this requires taking the derivative of R with respect to c and setting it to zero. This seems very complicated given the expression for R.Alternatively, assume that for given a and b, the maximum of R occurs when c = a + b (degenerate triangle). But in the case when c approaches a + b, the triangle becomes degenerate, and depending on a and b, the ratio R might approach different limits. For example, in the isoceles case a = b, R approaches 4/3. In other cases, it approaches lower values.Therefore, perhaps the maximum of R over all possible triangles is indeed 4/3, achieved in the limit as the isoceles triangle becomes degenerate.Therefore, based on the examples and the analysis, the smallest k satisfying the inequality is 4/3. Hence, the answer is boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}.Final AnswerThe smallest number ( k ) is (boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the smallest number ( k ) such that ( frac{t_{a} + t_{b}}{a + b} &lt; k ) for any two sides ( a ) and ( b ) of a triangle, where ( t_{a} ) and ( t_{b} ) are the lengths of the angle bisectors corresponding to these sides, we start by recalling the formula for the length of an angle bisector. The length of the angle bisector from angle ( A ) (opposite side ( a )) is given by:[ t_{a} = frac{2bc cos left( frac{A}{2} right)}{b + c} ]Similarly, the length of the angle bisector from angle ( B ) (opposite side ( b )) is:[ t_{b} = frac{2ac cos left( frac{B}{2} right)}{a + c} ]We need to maximize the ratio ( frac{t_{a} + t_{b}}{a + b} ). Considering various cases and using trigonometric identities, we find that the maximum value occurs in the limit as the triangle becomes degenerate. Specifically, for an isosceles triangle with sides ( a = b ) and the third side ( c ) approaching ( 2a ), the ratio approaches ( frac{4}{3} ).Key steps include:1. Using the formula for the angle bisector length in terms of the sides of the triangle.2. Analyzing the behavior of the angle bisectors in degenerate triangles.3. Checking various configurations of triangles, including right-angled and isosceles triangles.4. Using trigonometric identities and the Law of Cosines to express angles and their bisectors.After thorough analysis and considering the limit cases, we conclude that the smallest ( k ) such that ( frac{t_{a} + t_{b}}{a + b} &lt; k ) for any triangle is ( frac{4}{3} ).Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{dfrac{4}{3}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>5.

Then, I have to sum all these digitized numbers. Hmm, this seems a bit abstract. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the definition correctly. A digitized number is a 10-digit number, meaning each position from 0 to 9 (since it&#39;s a_0 to a_9) is a digit, right? So, for example, a_0 is the number of times 0 appears in the entire number, a_1 is the number of times 1 appears, and so on up to a_9, which is the number of times 9 appears. Since it&#39;s a ten-digit number, the sum of all a_k from k=0 to 9 must be 10, because each digit position contributes to the count of some digit.Wait, but each digit a_k is a count of how many times k appears. So, for example, if the digit in the 0th position is 6, that means there are six 0s in the entire number. Similarly, the digit in the 1st position is the count of 1s in the number, etc. So, the number is self-descriptive in a way. Each digit describes the count of its index in the number.But I remember that there&#39;s a term called &quot;self-descriptive numbers&quot; which might be similar. Let me recall. Yes, a self-descriptive number is an integer m that in a given base b is b digits long in which each digit d at position n (the most significant digit being at position 0 and the least significant at position b−1) counts how many times digit n appears in m. So, in this case, since we&#39;re dealing with base 10, a 10-digit number where each digit counts the number of times its position occurs. So, yes, this problem is about finding all 10-digit self-descriptive numbers in base 10 and summing them up.I think there might be only a couple of these numbers, maybe even just one. Let me check.First, let me think about how to approach constructing such a number. Let&#39;s denote the number as a_0a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6a_7a_8a_9. Each a_i is the count of digit i in the number.Since the number has 10 digits, the sum of all a_i must be 10. So:a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_9 = 10.Also, each a_i must be a digit between 0 and 9, inclusive. But since they are counts, they can&#39;t exceed 10, but in practice, since the total is 10, each a_i can be at most 10. However, since each a_i is a single digit, the maximum possible value for any a_i is 9. But if any a_i is 10, that would require the digit in that position to be 10, which is not possible since digits are 0-9. Therefore, each a_i must be between 0 and 9 inclusive, and their sum is 10.So, with that in mind, perhaps we can approach this problem by setting up equations based on the digits.Let me start by considering the first digit, a_0. Since a_0 is the number of zeros in the entire number, and the total number of digits is 10, the number of zeros must be equal to a_0. Therefore, the remaining digits (from a_1 to a_9) must sum to 10 - a_0. But also, the sum of all digits is 10. So, if a_0 is the number of zeros, then the sum of all digits (which includes a_0) is 10. Therefore:a_0 + (sum of digits a_1 to a_9) = 10.But sum of digits a_1 to a_9 is 10 - a_0, as we just said. Therefore:a_0 + (10 - a_0) = 10, which is just redundant. So, perhaps this is not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps we can set up equations for each digit. For example, a_1 is the number of times 1 appears in the number. Each digit a_i (from i=0 to 9) contributes to the count of digit i. So, if a_1 is equal to the number of times 1 appears in the number, then:The number of times 1 appears is equal to the number of digits a_i that are equal to 1.Similarly, the number of times 2 appears is equal to the number of digits a_i that are equal to 2, and so on.Wait, that seems like a key insight. Let me restate that:For each digit d from 0 to 9, the value a_d is equal to the number of times d appears in the sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_9.Therefore, each a_d counts the number of times d appears among the digits of the number.So, for example, a_0 is the number of times 0 appears in the digits a_0 to a_9.Similarly, a_1 is the number of times 1 appears in the digits a_0 to a_9.This is the standard definition of a self-descriptive number. So, this problem is equivalent to finding all 10-digit self-descriptive numbers in base 10 and summing them.Now, I recall that in base 10, there are only two self-descriptive numbers: 6210001000 and 2100010006. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, let me check.Wait, actually, 2100010006 might not be a valid self-descriptive number. Let me verify.First, let&#39;s take the number 6210001000.Let&#39;s check each digit:a_0 = 6, which should be the number of 0s in the number. Let&#39;s count the zeros in 6210001000: the digits are 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. So, zeros occur at positions 3,4,5,7,8,9. That&#39;s 6 zeros. So, a_0=6, correct.a_1 = 2: number of 1s in the number. The digits include 1 at position 2 and 6. So, two 1s. Correct.a_2 =1: number of 2s. There is one 2 at position 1. Correct.a_3 =0: number of 3s. There are no 3s. Correct.Similarly, a_4=0: no 4s. Correct.a_5=0: no 5s. Correct.a_6=1: number of 6s. There is one 6 at position 0. Correct.a_7=0: no 7s. Correct.a_8=0: no 8s. Correct.a_9=0: no 9s. Correct.So, 6210001000 is a valid self-descriptive number.Now, let&#39;s check 2100010006. Let&#39;s see:Digits: 2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6.Now, check each a_k:a_0=2: number of 0s. Let&#39;s count: positions 3,4,5,7,8,9. Wait, position 9 is 6, so zeros are at 3,4,5,7,8. Wait, that&#39;s 5 zeros. But a_0 is 2. So, invalid. Therefore, 2100010006 is not a valid self-descriptive number. So, maybe that was a mistake.Alternatively, maybe the other way around. Let&#39;s check the digits again for 2100010006:Digits: a0=2, a1=1, a2=0, a3=0, a4=0, a5=1, a6=0, a7=0, a8=0, a9=6.Now, count the number of 0s: a2=0, a3=0, a4=0, a6=0, a7=0, a8=0. So, digits at positions 2,3,4,6,7,8 are 0. That&#39;s six zeros. But a0=2, which contradicts. So, this number is invalid.Wait, maybe there&#39;s another one. Let me think.Alternatively, is there another self-descriptive number in base 10? Let me check.Wait, perhaps 2100010006 is supposed to be another one, but when we count, it&#39;s inconsistent. Let me try another approach.Alternatively, maybe the only 10-digit self-descriptive number is 6210001000. Wait, but according to some sources, there is another one: 2100010006. Hmm. Let me check again.Wait, let&#39;s take 2100010006:Digits: 2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6.So, number of 0s: digits at positions 2,3,4,6,7,8 are 0, which is six 0s. But a0=2. So, that&#39;s not correct. Therefore, invalid.Number of 1s: digits at positions 1 and 5: two 1s. But a1=1. So, that&#39;s incorrect. Also, invalid.Number of 2s: digit at position 0: one 2. So, a2=0, which is incorrect.Number of 6s: digit at position 9: one 6. So, a6=0, but a9=6. Hmm, but the count for digit 6 is 0, but there is a 6 in the number. Therefore, invalid.So, 2100010006 is definitely invalid. Maybe there was a confusion in the source.Alternatively, perhaps there is another self-descriptive number. Let me think.Alternatively, let&#39;s attempt to construct such a number.First, let&#39;s note that in a self-descriptive number, the sum of all digits must be equal to the number of digits, which is 10. So, 10 digits, sum is 10. So, we have to distribute 10 counts among the digits, with each digit a_i indicating the count of i in the number.Also, each digit a_i must equal the number of times i appears in the number.So, for example, let&#39;s consider that a_0 is the number of zeros. Since the number is ten digits, the number of zeros must be a_0, which is the first digit. So, the first digit cannot be zero, otherwise, we would have a_0=0, but if a_0 is zero, that would mean there are no zeros in the number, but a_0 itself is a digit. If a_0=0, that would imply there are no zeros, but if a_0 is 0, that&#39;s a contradiction. Therefore, a_0 cannot be zero. So, a_0 is at least 1.Wait, but in our example 6210001000, a_0=6, which is okay. So, let&#39;s try to find possible values.Alternatively, maybe there are two self-descriptive numbers. Let&#39;s see.Let me try to find all such numbers.Let me start by considering the sum equation:Sum_{k=0}^9 a_k = 10.Also, each a_k is the count of digit k. So, for each k, a_k = number of times k appears in the digits.So, for example, if we consider the digit 6, a_6 is the number of times 6 appears in the digits. So, if a_6=1, that means there is exactly one 6 in the digits. Similarly, if a_1=2, there are two 1s in the digits.So, the problem is similar to a system of equations where each a_k is equal to the count of k in the digits.So, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations.Let me denote variables:Let x_0 = a_0, x_1 = a_1, ..., x_9 = a_9.We need:x_0 = number of times 0 appears in x_0 to x_9x_1 = number of times 1 appears in x_0 to x_9...x_9 = number of times 9 appears in x_0 to x_9And also:Sum_{k=0}^9 x_k = 10Each x_k is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.So, this is a system of 10 equations with 10 variables, but with constraints.This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a solution by trial and error.First, let&#39;s note that x_0 cannot be 0, as discussed earlier. If x_0=0, that would mean there are no zeros in the number, but x_0 itself is 0, which is a zero. Contradiction. Therefore, x_0 &gt;=1.Similarly, if x_1=0, that would mean there are no 1s in the number. But if x_1=0, then how do we account for the count of 1s? So, if x_1=0, there must be no 1s in the digits. But if x_1=0, that&#39;s a digit, so if x_1=0, that&#39;s a zero, not a one. So, that&#39;s okay. Wait, x_1 counts the number of 1s. So, if x_1=0, that means there are no 1s in the digits. So, the digit x_1 is 0, which is allowed.Similarly, other digits can be zero or not. But x_0 must be at least 1.Let me try to analyze the digits.In the known example, 6210001000, we have:x_0=6 (number of zeros)x_1=2 (number of ones)x_2=1 (number of twos)x_6=1 (number of sixes)All others are zero.And the sum is 6+2+1+1=10.So, the counts add up. Let&#39;s check if this satisfies the equations:Number of zeros: digits are 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. So, there are six zeros (positions 3,4,5,7,8,9). So, x_0=6, correct.Number of ones: digits 1 and 6. Wait, positions 2 and 6: x_2=1 and x_6=1. Wait, but the digits are:Position 0:61:22:13:04:05:06:17:08:09:0So, the digits are 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. So, the ones are at positions 2 and 6. So, two 1s. Therefore, x_1=2, correct.The twos: only at position 1. So, one 2. Therefore, x_2=1, correct.The sixes: only at position 0. So, one 6. Therefore, x_6=1, correct.All other digits are zero, so x_3=0, x_4=0, etc., which is correct because there are no 3s, 4s, etc.So, this works.Is there another number?Let me try to see.Suppose we consider another possible number.Suppose x_0=2. Then, there are two zeros in the number. But x_0=2, so the first digit is 2. Then, since there are two zeros, the remaining digits must sum to 8 (since 2 + sum_{k=1}^9 x_k =10). Also, the count of each digit must correspond to their positions.But let&#39;s try to imagine such a number.If x_0=2, then there are two zeros. But x_0=2 is the first digit, so that&#39;s a 2. So, one of the digits is 2. Then, the rest of the digits must account for the counts.Wait, but the sum of the digits would be 2 (from x_0) plus the sum of x_1 to x_9. Since total sum is 10, sum of x_1 to x_9 is 8.But also, each x_i is the count of i&#39;s in the entire number.Wait, if x_0=2, then there are two zeros. So, two of the digits (other than x_0) are zeros. But x_0 itself is 2, so not zero. So, two zeros in positions 1 to 9.Wait, but x_0 is 2, so there are two 0s in the entire number, but x_0 is 2, which is a non-zero digit. Therefore, the other two zeros must be in positions 1 to 9. So, two of the digits x_1 to x_9 must be zero. But sum of x_1 to x_9 is 8, so the remaining seven digits (since two are zeros) must sum to 8. So, perhaps possible.But we need each x_i to be equal to the count of digit i.For example, x_1 is the number of 1s in the number. If we have x_0=2, then the digits are:x_0=2x_1=?x_2=?...x_9=?Total digits: 10.Number of zeros: 2 (x_0 is 2, which is a non-zero, so two other digits are zero).So, two of x_1 to x_9 are zero, and the remaining eight digits sum to 8.But each of the remaining digits (non-zero ones from x_1 to x_9) must be such that their values correspond to the counts.This seems complex. Maybe let&#39;s try to construct such a number.Suppose x_0=2 (two zeros), x_1=1 (one 1), x_2=1 (one 2), x_3=1 (one 3), x_4=1 (one 4), x_5=1 (one 5), x_6=1 (one 6), x_7=1 (one 7), x_8=1 (one 8), x_9=1 (one 9). But the sum would be 2 + 9*1=11, which is over 10. Not possible.Alternatively, maybe some other combination.Wait, but if x_0=2, and two of x_1 to x_9 are zeros, then the remaining seven digits (non-zero) must sum to 8.So, distributing 8 among seven digits, each at least 1. Wait, but 7 digits each at least 1 would sum to 7, so we have an extra 1. So, one of them is 2 and the rest are 1. So, one digit is 2, six digits are 1. But then, the count of 1s would be 6 (since six digits are 1) plus the 2. Wait, but x_1 is the number of 1s. If six digits are 1, then x_1=6. But we only have seven non-zero digits. So, if one digit is 2, six are 1, then x_1=6, which is one of the digits. But then, x_1=6 would require six 1s. Let me check:If x_1=6, meaning there are six 1s. So, in the digits, six of them are 1. But in this case, we already have x_0=2, and two zeros. So, the remaining seven digits (positions 1-9) have two zeros and five non-zero digits. Wait, this is getting confusing.Wait, let&#39;s clarify:Total digits: 10.If x_0=2, then two zeros in the number. Since x_0=2 is a non-zero digit, the other two zeros must be in positions 1-9. So, among x_1 to x_9, two are zeros, and seven are non-zero. The sum of x_1 to x_9 is 8 (since total sum is 10, x_0=2). So, the seven non-zero digits among x_1 to x_9 must sum to 8.But each of these seven digits must be at least 1 (since they are non-zero). So, 7 digits summing to 8. That&#39;s 7 ones and 1 extra, which would be 1. So, seven digits: six 1s and one 2. Wait, no: 7 digits, each at least 1. The minimal sum is 7. To get 8, we need one of them to be 2 and the rest 1. So, one 2 and six 1s. Therefore, among x_1 to x_9, we have two zeros, one 2, and six 1s.But then, the digits would be:x_0=2x_1=?But x_1 is the number of 1s in the entire number. There are six 1s in positions 1-9 (since seven non-zero digits: six 1s and one 2). So, total number of 1s is six. Therefore, x_1=6.But if x_1=6, then the digit in position 1 is 6, which is a non-zero digit. Therefore, x_1=6 is part of the seven non-zero digits in positions 1-9. Wait, but we already have one 2 (from the seven non-zero digits: six 1s and one 2). But x_1=6 would be another non-zero digit, but we only have seven non-zero digits (two zeros, seven non-zero). Wait, but if x_1=6, that&#39;s an additional non-zero digit. Therefore, that&#39;s conflicting.Wait, let&#39;s see:If among x_1 to x_9, two are zeros, and seven are non-zero. The seven non-zero digits are six 1s and one 2. So, in this case, the digits from 1 to 9 are: six 1s, one 2, and two 0s.But x_1 is the number of 1s. Since there are six 1s, x_1=6. Therefore, the digit at position 1 is 6.But that 6 is part of the seven non-zero digits. However, we already accounted for six 1s and one 2. So, if x_1=6, that&#39;s a 6, which is another digit. Therefore, we have seven non-zero digits: six 1s, one 2, and one 6. Wait, but that&#39;s eight non-zero digits. But we only have seven non-zero digits (since two zeros). Contradiction.Therefore, this approach is invalid. Hence, this combination doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, perhaps my assumption is wrong. Let me check again.If x_0=2, two zeros in the number. The remaining eight digits (positions 1-9) must sum to 8. But two of those eight digits are zeros, so the remaining six digits sum to 8. Wait, no: total sum of x_1 to x_9 is 8, and among them, two are zeros. So, the non-zero digits among x_1 to x_9 are seven digits (since two are zeros) summing to 8. Therefore, seven digits sum to 8. So, one of them is 2 and the rest are 1s (as 7*1 +1=8). So, six 1s and one 2.Therefore, in positions 1-9: two zeros, six 1s, and one 2. Then, the number would be:x_0=2x_1=6 (since six 1s)x_2=1 (since one 2)and the rest (x_3 to x_9) would be 0 except for one 1. Wait, no. Wait, the six 1s are among x_1 to x_9. But x_1=6 (the count of 1s). But x_1=6 is a digit in position 1. So, if x_1=6, that&#39;s a 6, which is not a 1. Therefore, the six 1s must be in other positions.Wait, here&#39;s the problem: if x_1=6, meaning there are six 1s in the entire number, but if x_1=6 is in position 1, which is a 6, not a 1. Therefore, the six 1s must be in other positions. So, positions 2-9 must have six 1s. But among x_1 to x_9, two are zeros, one is 2 (x_2=1?), and six are 1s. Wait, but if x_1=6, position 1 is 6, which is a non-1 digit. So, positions 2-9 would need to have six 1s, but x_2 is the number of 2s. If x_2=1, meaning there is one 2 in the number, which would be the digit at position x_2=1. Wait, x_2=1 would mean the digit in position 2 is 1, which is a 1. So, that&#39;s one of the six 1s. Then, the remaining five 1s must be in positions 3-9. But among positions 3-9, we have two zeros (positions where x_i=0). So, in positions 3-9, two are zeros, and the remaining five are 1s. Therefore, total in positions 1-9: x_1=6 (non-1), x_2=1 (a 1), positions 3-9: two zeros and five 1s. Then, total 1s are x_2=1 and five in positions 3-9: total 6, which matches x_1=6. Then, the 2 is at position x_2=1 (which is a 1). Wait, no:Wait, x_2 is the number of 2s in the number. If x_2=1, then there is one 2 in the number. However, in the digits, the digits are:x_0=2, x_1=6, x_2=1, and the rest (x_3 to x_9): two zeros and five 1s.So, digits are: 2,6,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1.Wait, let&#39;s list them:Position 0:21:62:13:04:05:16:17:18:19:1So, the digits are 2,6,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1.Now, check counts:Number of 0s: positions 3 and 4: two 0s. But x_0=2, correct.Number of 1s: positions 2,5,6,7,8,9: six 1s. x_1=6, correct.Number of 2s: position 0: one 2. x_2=1, correct.Number of 6s: position 1: one 6. So, x_6 should be 1. However, in this number, x_6 is 1 (position 6 is 1). Wait, no:Wait, in the number as constructed:x_0=2x_1=6x_2=1x_3=0x_4=0x_5=1x_6=1x_7=1x_8=1x_9=1So, the digit at position 6 is 1. Therefore, x_6=1. But in the number, there is a 6 at position 1. So, the number of 6s is 1 (at position 1). Therefore, x_6 should be 1. However, in our current setup, x_6=1, which is correct because there is one 6. Wait, but position 6 has a 1, not a 6. The 6 is at position 1. So, x_6 counts the number of 6s. There is one 6 at position 1, so x_6=1. But in our number, x_6 is 1, which is correct.Wait, then let&#39;s check all:x_0=2 (number of 0s: positions 3,4: two 0s. Correct.x_1=6 (number of 1s: positions 2,5,6,7,8,9: six 1s. Correct.x_2=1 (number of 2s: position 0: one 2. Correct.x_3=0 (number of 3s: none. Correct.x_4=0 (number of 4s: none. Correct.x_5=1 (number of 5s: position 5: digit is 1, so no 5s. Wait, x_5=1, but there are no 5s in the number. Contradiction.Ah, here&#39;s the problem. In our constructed number, x_5=1, which should mean there is one 5 in the number. But looking at the digits, the digit at position 5 is 1, not 5. Therefore, there are no 5s in the number. So, x_5 should be 0, but in our current setup, x_5=1. Therefore, this is invalid.Therefore, this attempted construction fails.So, the problem arises because x_5=1, but there is no 5 in the number. Therefore, this is inconsistent. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work.So, perhaps constructing such a number with x_0=2 is not possible. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way.Alternatively, maybe x_5=0, but then where does the extra 1 go?Wait, let&#39;s try again.If x_0=2, sum of x_1 to x_9=8. Two of x_1 to x_9 are zeros, so seven non-zero digits summing to 8. Let&#39;s distribute as six 1s and one 2.So, positions 1-9: two zeros, six 1s, one 2.But we need to assign the 2 to some position. Let&#39;s suppose the 2 is at position x_2=1. Wait, but x_2 is the number of 2s. If there is one 2 in the number, then x_2=1. So, position 2 would be 1. Wait, but if the 2 is at position x_2=1, then the digit at position 2 is 1, which is a 1. So, the 2 must be elsewhere.Wait, confusion here. The 2 is one of the digits from x_1 to x_9. For example, suppose the 2 is at position x_5=2. Then, x_5=2, meaning there are two 5s in the number. But if x_5=2, then we need two 5s. But if x_5=2 is a digit in position 5, which is 2, then that&#39;s a 2, not a 5. So, the 2 in position 5 doesn&#39;t contribute to the count of 5s. So, x_5=2 would require two 5s elsewhere. But we only have six 1s, one 2, and two zeros in positions 1-9. So, there&#39;s no 5. Therefore, x_5=0. But we need to have x_5=0, but in our distribution, we have one 2. So, maybe the 2 is assigned to x_2=1, but that would mean the digit at position 2 is 1, which is a 1, not a 2. Therefore, no.This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps another approach.Alternatively, maybe the only self-descriptive number in base 10 is 6210001000, so the sum is just that number itself. But the problem states &quot;the sum of all digitized numbers,&quot; implying there might be more than one. However, my previous attempt to construct another one led to inconsistencies.Let me check online. Wait, actually, in base 10, 6210001000 is the only 10-digit self-descriptive number. But I need to confirm.According to some references, in base 10, there is exactly one self-descriptive number: 6210001000. For example, the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences entry for self-descriptive numbers mentions this. Therefore, maybe there is only one.Alternatively, another source says there are two, but one is a different base. Wait, no, 2100010006 was suggested but we saw it&#39;s invalid.Alternatively, maybe there is another one. Let me try to think differently.Suppose we have x_0=7. Then, there are seven 0s. So, x_0=7, and seven 0s in the number. The remaining three digits sum to 3 (since 7+3=10). Also, each of these three digits must be counts of their respective digits.So, x_0=7, seven zeros. So, three non-zero digits. The non-zero digits sum to 3. So, possible combinations: three 1s, or one 1 and one 2.But since each digit must be the count of its index, let&#39;s see.If we have three 1s, then x_1=3. But since we already have x_0=7, then the digits are:x_0=7, x_1=3, and the rest (x_2 to x_9) are 0 except for two more 1s. Wait, but we need three non-zero digits summing to 3. So, x_0=7, and three non-zero digits: x_1=3, x_2=0, ..., x_9=0. But then, the three non-zero digits are x_0=7, x_1=3, and? Wait, the sum of x_0 to x_9 is 10. If x_0=7, and x_1=3, then remaining digits sum to 0, which is impossible. Therefore, no.Alternatively, if the three non-zero digits are x_0=7, x_1=1, and x_2=1, and x_3=1. Then sum would be 7+1+1+1=10. But then, number of 1s is 3 (x_1=1, x_2=1, x_3=1). So, three 1s. But x_1=1, which contradicts because there are three 1s. Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, maybe x_0=7, x_1=2, x_2=1, summing to 7+2+1=10. Then, the digits are:x_0=7, x_1=2, x_2=1, and the rest 0.So, the number is 7,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Now, check the counts:Number of 0s: positions 3-9: seven 0s. x_0=7, correct.Number of 1s: position 2: one 1. x_1=2, incorrect. There is only one 1, but x_1=2. So, invalid.Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, x_0=5. Let&#39;s try x_0=5.Then, five zeros. The remaining five digits sum to 5.Assuming x_0=5, the number has five zeros. So, five of the digits from x_1 to x_9 are non-zero and sum to 5.So, possible distributions: five 1s, or three 1s and one 2, etc.But x_1 is the number of 1s. If we have five 1s, x_1=5. Then, the digits would be x_0=5, x_1=5, and the rest zeros. But the sum would be 5+5=10, correct. So, the number is 5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Check counts:Number of 0s: positions 2-9: eight 0s. x_0=5, which is incorrect. So, invalid.Alternatively, three 1s and one 2: sum is 3+2=5. So, x_0=5, x_1=3, x_2=2, and the rest zeros. Sum:5+3+2=10. The number is 5,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Check counts:Number of 0s: positions 3-9: seven 0s. x_0=5, incorrect. Again, invalid.Alternatively, two 1s and one 3: sum 2+3=5. So, x_0=5, x_1=2, x_3=3. Sum:5+2+3=10. The number is 5,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0.Check counts:Number of 0s: positions 0 is 5 (non-zero), positions 2,4-9: seven 0s. So, x_0=5, but there are seven 0s. Contradiction.Alternatively, this approach is not working.Perhaps there is only one 10-digit self-descriptive number, which is 6210001000.Alternatively, let&#39;s try x_0=6.So, six zeros. Then, the remaining four digits sum to 4.So, x_0=6, and four non-zero digits summing to 4. Let&#39;s suppose those are two 1s and two 2s. Then, x_1=2, x_2=2, sum=6+2+2=10. But also, need to account for the counts.The number would be 6,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Check counts:Number of 0s: positions 3-9: seven 0s. x_0=6, incorrect.Alternatively, four 1s. x_1=4. Number is 6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Count of 0s: eight 0s. x_0=6, incorrect.Alternatively, one 1, one 2, one 3, and one 4. Sum=1+2+3+4=10. So, x_0=6, x_1=1, x_2=2, x_3=3, x_4=4. The number is 6,1,2,3,4,0,0,0,0,0.Check counts:Number of 0s: positions 5-9: five 0s. x_0=6, incorrect.This is not working. So, maybe 6210001000 is the only one.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to think of another way.We know that 6210001000 works. Is there another permutation or another combination?Wait, in the known number, 6210001000, the digits are 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.So, x_0=6, x_1=2, x_2=1, x_6=1, rest are zero.Therefore, the non-zero digits are x_0=6, x_1=2, x_2=1, x_6=1.Sum:6+2+1+1=10.The counts:Number of 0s: six. x_0=6.Number of 1s: two. x_1=2.Number of 2s: one. x_2=1.Number of 6s: one. x_6=1.All others: zero.This works.Suppose we try to rearrange these digits. For example, could we have another number where the non-zero digits are in different positions but still satisfy the counts?For example, suppose we put the 6 in a different position. But x_0 is the count of 0s. If we move the 6 to, say, x_7=6, then x_0 would have to be the number of 0s. But then, the digit at position 7 is 6, which would require x_7=6. Wait, but x_7 is the number of 7s in the number. So, if x_7=6, there should be six 7s in the number. But we only have one 6, and the rest are other digits. This seems difficult.Alternatively, trying to swap digits. For example, if we have x_9=1 instead of x_6=1. So, the number would be 6,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1. Then, check counts:Number of 0s: six. x_0=6.Number of 1s: two (at positions 2 and 9). x_1=2.Number of 2s: one. x_2=1.Number of 9s: one. x_9=1.But in this number, the digit at position 6 is 0, so x_6=0. However, there is a 6 at position 0. So, the number of 6s is one. Therefore, x_6 should be 1, but in this case, x_6=0. Contradiction. Therefore, invalid.Therefore, rearranging digits may not work unless the counts are adjusted.Alternatively, maybe having two digits with 1s. For example, x_6=1 and x_7=1, but then the number would be 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0. Let&#39;s check counts:Number of 0s: six. x_0=6. In this case, positions 3,4,8,9: four zeros. Wait, no:Wait, the number would be:Position 0:61:22:13:04:05:06:17:18:09:0So, zeros at positions 3,4,5,8,9: five zeros. But x_0=6. Contradiction. Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, this approach isn&#39;t working.Therefore, after trying different possibilities, it seems that 6210001000 is the only valid 10-digit self-descriptive number. Therefore, the sum of all digitized numbers is just 6210001000.But to confirm, let&#39;s check if there are any other numbers.According to the literature, in base 10, there is exactly one self-descriptive number: 6210001000. For example, refer to the Wikipedia page on self-descriptive numbers: &quot;In base 10, the number 6210001000 is self-descriptive.&quot; No others are listed for base 10.Therefore, the answer is 6210001000. So, the sum of all digitized numbers is 6210001000.Final Answerboxed{6210001000}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the sum of all digitized numbers, we need to identify all ten-digit numbers where each digit (a_k) represents the number of times the digit (k) occurs in the number itself. These numbers are known as self-descriptive numbers in base 10.1. Understanding the Definition:   - A digitized number (a_0a_1ldotsa_9) must satisfy that for each (k), (a_k) is the count of digit (k) in the number.   - The sum of all digits (a_0 + a_1 + ldots + a_9) must be 10 because the number has ten digits.2. Key Insights:   - The number must be self-descriptive, meaning each digit describes the count of its index.   - We need to check known self-descriptive numbers and verify their validity.3. Verification of Known Numbers:   - The number (6210001000) is verified as follows:     - (a_0 = 6) (six zeros in the number).     - (a_1 = 2) (two ones in the number).     - (a_2 = 1) (one two in the number).     - (a_6 = 1) (one six in the number).     - All other digits are zero, which matches their respective counts.   - Other potential candidates like (2100010006) were checked and found invalid due to inconsistencies in digit counts.4. Conclusion:   - After thorough verification and considering literature, (6210001000) is confirmed as the only valid ten-digit self-descriptive number in base 10.Thus, the sum of all digitized numbers is simply the only valid digitized number, which is:[boxed{6210001000}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all digitized numbers. A digitized number is a ten-digit number where each digit a_k tells how many times the digit k occurs in the number itself. That&#39;s a bit meta, right? Each digit counts the number of times its position occurs in the entire number.First, let me make sure I understand the definition correctly. For example, if we have a digitized number a0a1a2...a9, then a0 is the number of times 0 appears in the number, a1 is the number of times 1 appears, and so on up to a9, which is the number of times 9 appears. So each digit is both a count and part of the number itself.These numbers are ten digits long, which means each a_k is between 0 and 9, inclusive. But since the sum of all a_k must equal 10 (because there are ten digits in total), that gives a constraint. So, we have a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a9 = 10.But each a_k is also equal to the count of digit k in the number. So, for example, if a0 is 6, that means there are six 0s in the number, which would influence the counts for the other digits. It seems like a system of equations where each digit&#39;s value is determined by the others.I remember from some puzzles that these kinds of numbers are called self-descriptive numbers. But in this case, since we&#39;re dealing with ten-digit numbers, maybe there&#39;s a specific term or known set for them. Anyway, the problem is to find all such numbers and sum them up.I think there might only be one such number, but I need to verify that. Let me try to reason through the constraints.First, let&#39;s note that the sum of all digits a0 through a9 is 10. But each digit a_k is the count of how many times k appears in the number. So, for example, the digit in the 0th position (a0) counts the number of 0s in the entire number. Similarly, the digit in the 1st position (a1) counts the number of 1s, etc.Since the number is ten digits long, each digit is 0-9, but also, the digits must satisfy the count for their respective positions. Let&#39;s think step by step.Let me consider starting with a0. The digit a0 is the number of zeros in the number. Since the number is ten digits, if a0 is 6, that would mean there are six zeros. Then the remaining digits (positions 1-9) must account for the other four digits. But those digits would also be part of the counts for their respective positions.Wait, this seems similar to the classic self-descriptive number problem. For ten digits, I believe the known self-descriptive number is 6210001000. Let me check if that&#39;s correct.In 6210001000:- a0 = 6, which counts the number of 0s. Let&#39;s see: the number is 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. The digits are: 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. So how many 0s are there? Let&#39;s count: positions 3,4,5,7,8,9. That&#39;s six 0s. Correct.- a1 = 2: number of 1s. There are two 1s at positions 6 and 9 (wait, position 6 is a0=6, a1=2, a2=1, a3=0, a4=0, a5=0, a6=1, a7=0, a8=0, a9=0. So the digits are 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. The 1s are at positions 2 and 6. So two 1s. Correct.- a2 = 1: number of 2s. There&#39;s one 2 at position 1. Correct.- a3 = 0: number of 3s. There are no 3s. Correct.- Similarly, a4=0, a5=0: no 4s or 5s. Correct.- a6=1: number of 6s. There&#39;s one 6 at position 0. Correct.- a7=0, a8=0, a9=0: no 7s, 8s, or 9s. Correct.So that number works. Is there another one? The problem says &quot;sum of all digitized numbers,&quot; implying there might be more than one.Wait, let me think. Maybe there are two? Because sometimes in different bases there are multiple self-descriptive numbers, but in base 10, I think there&#39;s only one. But I need to confirm.Alternatively, maybe 2100010006 is another one? Wait, let&#39;s check.But wait, if I rearrange digits, does it still work? For example, if I have a different permutation, but the problem is that the digits have to correspond to their counts. So the digit in position k must be equal to the count of k&#39;s in the entire number. So permuting digits would mess up the counts. For example, if I swap the positions of two digits, their counts would refer to different numbers.Therefore, the position is fixed. Each digit&#39;s position determines which digit it is counting. So the position 0 counts 0s, position 1 counts 1s, etc. Therefore, the number is uniquely determined? Or is there another solution?Wait, maybe 2100010006 is not valid. Let&#39;s check.Wait, 2100010006 would be:a0=2, which would mean there are two 0s. But let&#39;s see: the number is 2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6. So digits are: 2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6. Let&#39;s count the zeros: positions 2,3,4,6,7,8. That&#39;s six zeros. But a0=2, which contradicts. So that&#39;s invalid.So that&#39;s not a valid digitized number.Alternatively, maybe another number. Let me try constructing one step by step.Let me consider that a0 is the number of zeros. Since the total number of digits is 10, the sum of all a_k is 10. Let&#39;s let a0 = x. Then the remaining digits (positions 1-9) sum to 10 - x. However, each of these digits a_k (for k &gt;=1) counts the number of times the digit k appears in the entire number.But each digit a_k (k &gt;=1) is at least 0 and at most 10 - x. Also, since a_k counts the number of times k appears, which would be at least 1 if a_k is non-zero (since the digit k is present in the number). Wait, but actually, a_k can be zero even if k is present elsewhere. Wait, no. If a_k is the number of times digit k occurs, then if a_k is non-zero, that means digit k occurs a_k times. But if a_k is zero, that means digit k doesn&#39;t occur at all.But here&#39;s a contradiction: if a_k is zero, then the digit k doesn&#39;t appear anywhere in the number, which would mean that the digit in position k is zero. But if a_k is zero, that&#39;s okay. However, if a_k is non-zero, then digit k must appear a_k times. So for example, if a1 = 2, then the digit 1 must appear twice in the number.But the digits in the number are a0, a1, a2, ..., a9. So each a_k is a digit in the number. Therefore, the presence of a digit k in the number is directly related to the value of a_k.Wait, for example, if a6 = 1, that means the digit 6 appears once in the number. But where can it appear? Only in position 6, since a6 is the count of 6s. Wait, no. The digit 6 can appear in any position. For example, if in some position m (m ≠6), the digit is 6, then that would contribute to a6&#39;s count.But if a6 is the count of 6s in the entire number, then a6 must equal the number of times 6 appears in all digits a0 to a9. So if a6 = 1, then there is exactly one 6 among the digits a0 to a9.Similarly, a0 is the count of 0s in the entire number, so a0 equals the number of digits in a0 to a9 that are 0.This is a system of equations where each equation is a_k = number of times digit k appears in the sequence a0, a1, ..., a9.Therefore, we need to find all sequences (a0, a1, ..., a9) such that:1. For each k, a_k is the number of times k appears in the sequence.2. The sum of the sequence is 10 (since there are ten digits).So this is a system of equations:For each k (0 &lt;= k &lt;=9):a_k = |{ i | a_i = k }| (the number of indices i where a_i is k).Additionally, sum_{k=0}^9 a_k = 10.This is a kind of constraint satisfaction problem.Now, in the known example, 6210001000, we have:a0 = 6 (there are six 0s)a1 = 2 (there are two 1s)a2 = 1 (there is one 2)a6 = 1 (there is one 6)The rest are 0.So the digits are: 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. Sum is 6+2+1+1+0*6=10. Correct.Digits present are 0,1,2,6. Let&#39;s check counts:Number of 0s: 6 (positions 3,4,5,7,8,9)Number of 1s: 2 (positions 2 and 6)Number of 2s: 1 (position 1)Number of 6s: 1 (position 0)Others: 0.So this satisfies the conditions.Now, is there another such number?Let me try to construct another one. Let&#39;s suppose there is another digitized number.First, consider that if a0 is 6, then there are six 0s. Then the remaining four digits must account for counts of 1,2,6, and possibly others.Alternatively, maybe a0 is different. Let&#39;s consider possible values for a0.Since a0 is the number of zeros in the number, and the total digits are 10, a0 can be from 0 to 10. But since the other digits (a1 to a9) must sum to 10 - a0, and each of them is at least 0, we have 10 - a0 &gt;= 0, so a0 &lt;=10. But since a0 is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9. So a0 &lt;=9. Therefore, a0 can be 0 to 9.But if a0 = 7, then there are seven 0s. Then the remaining three digits must sum to 3. Let&#39;s see.If we have seven 0s, then positions 1-9 must have three non-zero digits. Each of these non-zero digits counts the number of times their respective digit appears. For example, if a1=1, that means there&#39;s one &#39;1&#39; in the number. But since we already have seven 0s, and three non-zero digits (say a1, a2, a3), their digits (1,2,3) would have to account for the number of times 1,2,3 appear. But in this case, a1=1, so there is one &#39;1&#39; in the number. But if a1=1, that &#39;1&#39; is part of the digits, so we have a &#39;1&#39; in position 1. Then we need to check if that&#39;s the only &#39;1&#39; in the entire number. But if there are other non-zero digits, maybe there&#39;s a &#39;1&#39; elsewhere.Wait, this might get complicated. Let&#39;s try to think methodically.Possible approach: since each a_k is the count of digit k, and the counts must sum to 10. Let&#39;s consider possible values for a0.Case 1: a0 = 6.This is the known case. Then remaining digits sum to 4. Let&#39;s see how that works.In the known number, a1=2, a2=1, a6=1. The rest are 0. So sum is 2+1+1=4.So here, the digits 1,2,6 are present. Their counts are 2,1,1. So, the number of 1s is 2 (positions 1 and 6), the number of 2s is 1 (position 2), the number of 6s is 1 (position 0). Then zeros are in the remaining positions.Is there another way to get a0=6 with different counts?Suppose a0=6, then the remaining digits sum to 4. Suppose instead we have a1=3 and a3=1. Then sum would be 3+1=4. Then:a0=6, a1=3, a3=1, rest=0.But check if this is possible.If a1=3, that means there are three 1s in the number. The digits would be:a0=6, a1=3, a2=0, a3=1, a4=0, a5=0, a6=0, a7=0, a8=0, a9=0.So the number is 6,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.Now, check the counts:Number of 0s: positions 2,4,5,6,7,8,9: seven 0s. But a0=6. Contradiction.Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, a0=6, a1=1, a2=2, a5=1. Sum 1+2+1=4.Number: 6,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.Count the digits:Number of 0s: positions 3,4,6,7,8,9: six 0s. Correct (a0=6).Number of 1s: positions 1 and 5: two 1s. But a1=1, which is supposed to be the count. Contradiction because there are two 1s. So invalid.Another attempt: a0=6, a2=4. Then sum is 4. The number is 6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: eight 0s. a0=6, which is wrong. Invalid.Alternatively, a0=6, a1=4. Number: 6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions 2-9: eight 0s. a0=6, incorrect.Hmm, seems like the known solution is unique when a0=6. Let&#39;s check another case.Case 2: a0=7.Then the remaining digits sum to 3. So three non-zero digits.Let&#39;s try a1=1, a2=1, a7=1. Then the number is 7,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.Check counts:Number of 0s: positions 3,4,5,6,8,9: six 0s. But a0=7. Not enough.Another attempt: Maybe a1=3. Then the number is 7,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions 2-9: eight 0s. a0=7. Not matching.Alternatively, a0=7, a7=3. Number:7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0.Number of 0s: positions1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9: eight 0s. a0=7, wrong.Another idea: a0=7, a1=2, a8=1. Number:7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.Number of 0s: positions2,3,4,5,6,7,9: seven 0s. Correct.Number of 1s: position8: one 1. But a1=2. Contradiction.Alternatively, a0=7, a1=1, a2=1, a3=1. Number:7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions4,5,6,7,8,9: six 0s. a0=7. Not correct.Hmm, seems challenging to get a0=7. Maybe this case is impossible.Case 3: a0=5.Then remaining digits sum to 5.Let&#39;s try constructing a number with five non-zero digits. For example, a1=2, a2=1, a3=1, a4=1. Sum 2+1+1+1=5. Number:5,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions5,6,7,8,9: five 0s. Correct (a0=5).Number of 1s: positions3,4,5. Wait, in the number 5,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0, the digits are:Position0:5, position1:2, position2:1, position3:1, position4:1, positions5-9:0.So digits present: 5,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.Number of 1s: three (positions2,3,4). But a1=2. Contradiction.Another attempt: a0=5, a5=1, a1=3, a2=1. Number:5,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions3,4,6,7,8,9: six 0s. a0=5. Wrong.Alternatively, a0=5, a1=2, a2=2, a3=1. Number:5,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions4-9: six 0s. a0=5. Wrong.Alternatively, a0=5, a5=5. Number:5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9: eight 0s. a0=5. Wrong.This case is also problematic.Case 4: a0=8.Then remaining digits sum to 2. So two non-zero digits.Let&#39;s say a1=2. Number:8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions2-9: eight 0s. Correct (a0=8).Number of 1s: none, but a1=2. Contradiction.Alternatively, a8=2. Number:8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0.Number of 0s: positions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9: eight 0s. Correct.Number of 8s: position8: one 8. But a8=2. Contradiction.Alternatively, a1=1 and a2=1. Number:8,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions3-9: seven 0s. a0=8. Wrong.Case 5: a0=9.Then remaining digits sum to 1. So one non-zero digit.Let&#39;s say a9=1. Number:9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.Counts:Number of 0s: positions1-8: eight 0s. a0=9. Wrong.Alternatively, a1=1. Number:9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions2-9: eight 0s. a0=9. Wrong.No luck here.Case 6: a0=4.Then remaining digits sum to 6.Let&#39;s try a1=2, a2=2, a3=2. Number:4,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions4-9: six 0s. a0=4. Wrong.Alternatively, a1=3, a2=1, a4=2. Number:4,3,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions3,5-9: six 0s. a0=4. Wrong.Alternatively, a6=1, a1=5. Number:4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions2,3,4,5,7,8,9: seven 0s. a0=4. Wrong.Alternatively, a0=4, a4=1, a5=1. Number:4,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions1,2,3,6-9: seven 0s. a0=4. Wrong.This case is also not working.Case 7: a0=3.Remaining digits sum to 7.Trying a1=3, a2=2, a3=2. Number:3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions4-9: six 0s. a0=3. Wrong.Alternatively, a7=7. Number:3,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9: eight 0s. a0=3. Wrong.Alternatively, a1=5, a2=2. Number:3,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions3-9: seven 0s. a0=3. Wrong.Case 8: a0=2.Sum remaining digits: 8.Trying various combinations. For example, a1=4, a2=3, a3=1. Number:2,4,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions4-9: six 0s. a0=2. Wrong.Alternatively, a8=8. Number:2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions1-7,9: nine 0s. a0=2. Wrong.Case 9: a0=1.Sum remaining digits:9.This would require nine non-zero digits. But a0=1, so there is one 0. But if there&#39;s only one 0, then nine digits are non-zero, but each non-zero digit must be at least 1. However, each non-zero digit a_k counts the number of times k appears in the number. Since all digits except one are non-zero, and we have a0=1, which is the count of 0s. Let&#39;s see.For example, a0=1. Then, positions1-9 are all non-zero. So each a_k (k=1-9) is at least 1, but sum must be 9. But there are nine digits (a1-a9), each at least 1, so their minimum sum is 9. Therefore, each must be exactly 1. So the number would be 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1. But then, each digit is 1, so the number of 0s is 0, but a0=1. Contradiction. Therefore, impossible.Case 10: a0=0.Then all digits are non-zero. So each a_k (k=0-9) is at least 1. But sum of digits is 10, but there are ten digits, each at least 1, so sum is at least 10. Therefore, each a_k=1. But then the number would be 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1. But in this number, every digit appears once, so each a_k should be 1, which is correct. However, a0 is 1, which counts the number of 0s. But if all digits are 1, there are zero 0s, so a0 should be 0. Contradiction. Therefore, impossible.So from all these cases, it seems the only valid digitized number is 6210001000. Therefore, the sum of all digitized numbers is just 6210001000. But wait, the question says &quot;the sum of all digitized numbers.&quot; Is there another one?Wait, perhaps there&#39;s another number in addition to 6210001000? Let me check online. Wait, in the context of a ten-digit self-descriptive number, according to my prior knowledge, there is only one: 6210001000. But maybe there&#39;s another one? Let me think.Alternatively, consider 2100010006. Wait, that number was invalid because the count of 0s was wrong. Let&#39;s think differently.Wait, perhaps the number 2100010006 is invalid, but maybe another permutation.Wait, the key is that the digit in position k must equal the number of times k appears in the entire number. So you can&#39;t permute the digits because each digit&#39;s position defines which digit it&#39;s counting. So the only possible digitized number is 6210001000.Therefore, the sum is just 6210001000.But let me verify once again.Suppose there exists another digitized number.Suppose a0=6, a1=2, a2=1, a3=0, a4=0, a5=0, a6=1, a7=0, a8=0, a9=0: 6210001000.Alternatively, suppose another number where a0=5, a5=1, a1=3, a3=1. So the number would be 5,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0. Let&#39;s check counts.Number of 0s: positions2,4,6,7,8,9: six 0s, but a0=5. Contradiction.Alternatively, a0=6, a1=2, a2=1, a3=1, a4=0, etc. But sum would exceed.Alternatively, if a0=6, a1=1, a2=2, a6=1: number is 6,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions3,4,5,7,8,9: six 0s. Correct.Number of 1s: positions1 and6: two 1s. But a1=1. Contradiction.Hmm. So no, that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, a0=6, a1=3, a3=1, rest=0. The number is 6,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.Number of 0s: positions2,4-9: eight 0s. a0=6. Wrong.Another idea: a0=6, a2=2, a1=2. Number:6,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.Counts:Number of 0s: positions3-9: seven 0s. a0=6. Wrong.Number of 1s: none. a1=2. Contradiction.Alternatively, a0=6, a7=1, a1=2, a2=1. Number:6,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.Number of 0s: positions3,4,5,6,8,9: six 0s. Correct.Number of 1s: positions7 and where else? The digits are 6,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0. So 1s at positions2 and7: two 1s. Correct (a1=2).Number of 2s: position1: one 2. Correct (a2=1).Number of 7s: position7: one 7? Wait, no. Position7 is a7=1, which counts the number of 7s. If a7=1, then there should be one 7 in the number. But looking at the digits: 6,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0. There are no 7s. Therefore, a7=0. Contradiction because a7=1. Therefore invalid.So this attempt fails.Alternatively, if a0=6, a1=2, a2=1, a7=1, but then a7=1 implies there&#39;s one 7 in the number. But where? The digits are 6,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0. There&#39;s no 7. So that&#39;s invalid.Therefore, seems like the only valid number is 6210001000.Therefore, the sum is just that number itself. So the answer is 6210001000.But to confirm, let me check another source or example. Wait, according to literature, 6210001000 is the only ten-digit self-descriptive number in base 10. Therefore, the sum is just that number.Hence, the sum of all digitized numbers is 6210001000.Final Answerboxed{6210001000}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the sum of all digitized numbers, we need to identify ten-digit numbers where each digit (a_k) (at position (k)) represents the number of times the digit (k) occurs in the number itself. A digitized number must satisfy the following conditions:1. Each digit (a_k) is equal to the number of times (k) appears in the number.2. The sum of all digits (a_0 + a_1 + ldots + a_9 = 10).After analyzing various possibilities and constraints, we find that the known ten-digit self-descriptive number, which satisfies all conditions, is (6210001000). Verification of (6210001000):- (a_0 = 6): There are six 0s in the number.- (a_1 = 2): There are two 1s in the number.- (a_2 = 1): There is one 2 in the number.- (a_6 = 1): There is one 6 in the number.- All other digits (a_3, a_4, a_5, a_7, a_8, a_9) are 0, indicating no occurrences of those digits.This number uniquely satisfies all the conditions of a digitized number. After thorough analysis and considering various cases, it is concluded that there are no other digitized numbers. Thus, the sum of all digitized numbers is simply the number itself:[boxed{6210001000}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>1. We need to find a ten-digit number (a_0a_1a_2ldots a_9) such that for each (k = 0, 1, ldots, 9), (a_k) is equal to the number of times the digit (k) occurs in the number.2. First, note that the sum of all digits (a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_9 = 10) because the number has ten digits.3. Let&#39;s denote (a_0 = k). This means that the digit 0 appears (k) times in the number.4. Since (a_0 = k), the remaining 9 digits must sum to (10 - k). This is because the total sum of the digits must be 10.5. The remaining digits must include the counts of each digit from 1 to 9. Therefore, we need to distribute (10 - k) among the remaining digits such that the counts match the digits.6. We need to check each possible value of (k) to see if it leads to a valid digitized number.Let&#39;s start with (k = 6):- If (a_0 = 6), then the remaining sum is (10 - 6 = 4).- We need to distribute 4 among the remaining digits (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_9).- The only way to distribute 4 such that the counts match the digits is to have (a_1 = 2), (a_2 = 1), and (a_6 = 1). This gives us the number (6210001000).Let&#39;s verify:- (a_0 = 6): The digit 0 appears 6 times.- (a_1 = 2): The digit 1 appears 2 times.- (a_2 = 1): The digit 2 appears 1 time.- (a_6 = 1): The digit 6 appears 1 time.- All other digits (a_3, a_4, a_5, a_7, a_8, a_9) are 0, which means they do not appear in the number.Testing other values of (k):- For (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9), it is not possible to distribute the remaining sum to match the counts of the digits.Therefore, the only valid digitized number is (6210001000).The final answer is (boxed{6210001000}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ccc77b65 data-v-22911720><div class="review" data-v-22911720><div class="review-title" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>❓:</span>6 cdot 39 If y=left(log _{2} 3right)left(log _{3} 4right) cdot cdots cdotleft(log _{n}[n+1]right) cdot cdots cdot left(log _{31} 32right), then(A) 4&lt;y&lt;5.(B) y=5.(C) 5&lt;y&lt;6.(D) y=6.(E) 6&lt;y&lt;7.(28th American High School Mathematics Examination, 1977)</div><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the value of &#39;y&#39; which is a product of a bunch of logarithms. The options given are ranges or specific values, so we need to figure out where &#39;y&#39; falls.First, let me parse the problem again. The expression for y is:( y = left( log_{2}3 right) left( log_{3}4 right) cdots left( log_{n}[n+1] right) cdots left( log_{31}32 right) )So, this is a chain of logarithms where each logarithm&#39;s base is the previous argument, starting from base 2 and going up to base 31, with each subsequent argument being one more than the base. That is, the first term is log base 2 of 3, then log base 3 of 4, and so on, until log base 31 of 32. The product continues up to log base 31 of 32. So, how many terms are there here?Well, starting from base 2 and going up to base 31, that&#39;s 30 terms. Because 31 - 2 + 1 = 30. Wait, no. Let&#39;s check: base 2, then 3, ..., up to base 31. So, from 2 to 31 inclusive, that&#39;s 30 numbers (since 31 - 2 = 29, plus 1 is 30). So, 30 terms in the product. Each term is log_{k}(k+1) where k runs from 2 to 31. So, the product is from k=2 to k=31 of log_{k}(k+1). Hmm.Now, I remember that when you have a product of logarithms where the base of one is the argument of the previous, there&#39;s a telescoping property. Let me recall that. The change of base formula states that log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b). So, if we have log_{k}(k+1) = (ln(k+1))/(ln k). Therefore, each term in the product can be written as (ln(k+1))/(ln k). Then, when we multiply them all together, the product becomes:Product from k=2 to 31 of [ln(k+1)/ln k] = [ln3/ln2] * [ln4/ln3] * ... * [ln32/ln31]Ah! So, this telescopes! Because the numerator of each fraction cancels with the denominator of the next. Let me see:First term: ln3 / ln2Second term: ln4 / ln3Multiplying them gives (ln3 / ln2) * (ln4 / ln3) = ln4 / ln2Third term: ln5 / ln4Multiply that in: (ln4 / ln2) * (ln5 / ln4) = ln5 / ln2Continuing this way, each time the intermediate terms cancel out. So, after multiplying all the way up to k=31, the last term is ln32 / ln31. Therefore, the entire product becomes ln32 / ln2.Therefore, y = ln32 / ln2. But wait, ln32 / ln2 is the same as log base 2 of 32, by the change of base formula. Because log_b a = ln a / ln b. So, log_2 32 = ln32 / ln2. Therefore, y = log_2 32.But log base 2 of 32 is straightforward. Since 2^5 = 32. Therefore, log_2 32 = 5. So, y = 5. That would be answer choice B.Wait, but let me double-check. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn&#39;t skip anything.First, converting each log term using natural logs. Each log_{k}(k+1) is ln(k+1)/ln(k). Then multiplying from k=2 to 31:Product = [ln3/ln2] * [ln4/ln3] * ... * [ln32/ln31]Yes, all intermediates cancel, so we&#39;re left with ln32 / ln2. Which is log_2 32. Which is 5. Therefore, y=5. So, answer is B. Hmm. But let me check if there&#39;s any catch here. Let me verify with a smaller example.Suppose instead of going from 2 to 31, we have a product from k=2 to k=3. Then, the product would be log_2 3 * log_3 4. According to the same logic, that should be log_2 4 = 2. Let&#39;s compute it manually:log_2 3 = ln3 / ln2 ≈ 1.58496log_3 4 = ln4 / ln3 ≈ 1.26186Multiplying them: 1.58496 * 1.26186 ≈ 2.0, which is exactly log_2 4 = 2. So, that works. Another example: product from k=2 to 4: log_2 3 * log_3 4 * log_4 5. This should be log_2 5. Let&#39;s check:log_2 3 ≈ 1.58496log_3 4 ≈ 1.26186log_4 5 ≈ 1.16096Multiply all: 1.58496 * 1.26186 ≈ 2.0, then *1.16096 ≈ 2.32193log_2 5 ≈ 2.32193, which matches. So, yes, the telescoping works. Therefore, in general, the product of log_{k}(k+1) from k=2 to n is log_2(n+1). Therefore, in this problem, n=31, so it&#39;s log_2(32) = 5. So, y=5. Therefore, answer B.Wait, but the original problem states &quot;If y=(log_2 3)(log_3 4) * ... * (log_n [n+1]) * ... * (log_{31} 32)&quot;, so the product is from k=2 to k=31. So, the product telescopes to log_2 32, which is 5. Therefore, answer is B. Seems straightforward.But the answer options are given as (A) 4&lt;y&lt;5, (B) y=5, (C)5&lt;y&lt;6, (D) y=6, (E)6&lt;y&lt;7.But maybe there&#39;s a trick here. Wait, let me check the original problem again. Wait, the problem says &quot;log_n [n+1]&quot; with a center dot and so on until log_{31}32. Wait, does that mean that n is a variable here? Wait, but the problem defines y as a product that includes terms up to log_{31}32, so the variable n is just a dummy variable in the product. So, it&#39;s a product from k=2 to 31 of log_k(k+1). So, the telescoping gives log_2(32). Which is 5, as 2^5=32. Therefore, y=5. So answer is B.Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a confusing way. Let me check again:&quot;y = (log_2 3)(log_3 4) * ... * (log_n [n+1]) * ... * (log_{31} 32)&quot;So, the &quot;...&quot; is indicating that the product continues from log_2 3 up to log_{31}32, with each term being log_n(n+1) where n starts at 2 and goes to 31. Therefore, yes, the product is telescoping as I thought.Alternatively, is there a possibility that the problem is written in a different way? For example, maybe the indices are different? Let me check the original problem statement again.Original problem: &quot;If y=(log_2 3)(log_3 4) * ... * (log_n [n+1]) * ... * (log_{31} 32), then (A) 4&lt;y&lt;5, etc.&quot;Wait, actually, in the original problem, it&#39;s written as: &quot;log_n [n+1]&quot; where the bracket is probably meant to denote the argument, so log_n (n+1). Then, the product continues up to log_{31}32. So, as n increases from 2 up to 31, each term is log_n(n+1). Therefore, the product is indeed from n=2 to n=31 of log_n(n+1). So, as we saw, that telescopes to log_2(32) = 5. Hence, y=5. Therefore, the answer is B.But just to be thorough, let me verify if there&#39;s another way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the product is not from n=2 to 31, but from some other range? But the problem states &quot;log_n [n+1] * ... * log_{31}32&quot;, so the first term is log_2 3, then log_3 4, continuing until log_{31}32. So, n starts at 2 and ends at 31. Therefore, the product is from n=2 to n=31. Therefore, the telescoping product gives log_2(32) = 5. Hence, answer B.Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a different way, but according to the standard interpretation, this seems correct. Let me check with a calculator. If I compute the product of these logs, even numerically, it should be 5. Let&#39;s check with a smaller product.Take n=2 to 3: log_2 3 * log_3 4 = (ln3/ln2)*(ln4/ln3)=ln4/ln2=2. That&#39;s log_2 4=2. Similarly, if I compute n=2 to 4: log_2 3 * log_3 4 * log_4 5 = (ln3/ln2)*(ln4/ln3)*(ln5/ln4)=ln5/ln2≈2.3219, which is log_25≈2.3219. So, this method works.Therefore, for the original problem, n=2 to 31, so the product is log_2 32=5. Therefore, y=5, which is answer B.But just to ensure that there isn&#39;t a miscalculation here. For example, if we have 30 terms in the product, starting at log_23 and ending at log_{31}32. Let&#39;s count: starting with base 2, next base 3, ..., last base 31. The number of terms is 31 -2 +1 =30. Each term is log_{k}(k+1) for k=2 to 31. Then, the product is log_2 32. Wait, but 31 bases would correspond to 31 terms? Wait, wait. Wait, from k=2 to k=31 inclusive, that&#39;s 30 terms. Because 31-2=29, plus 1 is 30. So, 30 terms. So, product of 30 terms, each of the form log_{k}(k+1). Then, converting each term to ln(k+1)/ln(k), product becomes ln32/ln2. Which is log_232=5. So, 5. Hence, answer is B.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written with a typo, but according to the given information, that seems correct.But perhaps the answer is different? Let me check the original problem&#39;s year. It&#39;s from the 28th American High School Mathematics Examination, 1977. Wait, the American High School Mathematics Examination is now called the AMC 12, but in 1977, perhaps it was structured differently. But in any case, the problem seems to be as given.Alternatively, perhaps the options were misnumbered? But according to the user&#39;s message, options are (A) 4&lt;y&lt;5, (B) y=5, etc., so B is correct.But to ensure, perhaps compute the approximate numerical value. Let&#39;s see, ln32 / ln2. Well, ln32 is ln(2^5)=5ln2, so ln32 / ln2=5. Therefore, y=5. Exactly. Therefore, answer is B.Therefore, after careful consideration and multiple checks, the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given ( y = left( log_{2} 3 right) left( log_{3} 4 right) cdots left( log_{n} (n+1) right) cdots left( log_{31} 32 right) ), we need to determine the value of ( y ).First, we recognize that each term in the product is a logarithm where the base of one term is the argument of the previous term. Using the change of base formula, each term ( log_{k} (k+1) ) can be written as ( frac{ln (k+1)}{ln k} ).The product of these terms from ( k = 2 ) to ( k = 31 ) is:[left( frac{ln 3}{ln 2} right) left( frac{ln 4}{ln 3} right) cdots left( frac{ln 32}{ln 31} right)]This product telescopes, meaning all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:[frac{ln 32}{ln 2}]This simplifies to ( log_{2} 32 ). Since ( 32 = 2^5 ), we have:[log_{2} 32 = 5]Thus, the value of ( y ) is 5, corresponding to answer choice B.[boxed{B}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is asking about the value of y, which is a product of a bunch of logarithms. The expression given is y equals the product starting from log base 2 of 3, multiplied by log base 3 of 4, and so on, up to log base 31 of 32. Then we have to determine which of the options A to E is correct regarding the value of y.First, I need to understand what this product represents. Each term in the product is a logarithm of the form log base n of (n+1). So starting from log₂3, then log₃4, continuing up to log₃₁32. Let me write that out more clearly:y = log₂3 × log₃4 × log₄5 × ... × log₃₁32.Hmm. That&#39;s a chain of logarithms where each subsequent logarithm has a base that&#39;s one more than the previous argument. For example, the first term is log base 2 of 3, then the next term is log base 3 of 4, and so on. I wonder if there&#39;s a property of logarithms that can simplify this product.I remember that there&#39;s a change of base formula for logarithms which states that log_b a = (ln a) / (ln b). Maybe if I convert all these logarithms to the same base, say base e, their product might telescope or simplify in some way.Let&#39;s try that. If I express each term using natural logarithms:log₂3 = ln3 / ln2,log₃4 = ln4 / ln3,log₄5 = ln5 / ln4,...log₃₁32 = ln32 / ln31.So, when we multiply all these together:y = (ln3 / ln2) × (ln4 / ln3) × (ln5 / ln4) × ... × (ln32 / ln31).Wait a second! This looks like a telescoping product. Each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term. Let&#39;s verify:First term: ln3 / ln2,Second term: ln4 / ln3,Multiplying these two gives (ln3 / ln2) × (ln4 / ln3) = ln4 / ln2.Third term: ln5 / ln4,Multiplying gives (ln4 / ln2) × (ln5 / ln4) = ln5 / ln2.Continuing this pattern, each time the intermediate terms cancel out. So, after multiplying all the terms from log₂3 up to log₃₁32, the resulting product should be ln32 / ln2.Because all the intermediate numerators and denominators cancel, leaving only the last numerator ln32 and the first denominator ln2. So:y = ln32 / ln2.But ln32 / ln2 is equivalent to log₂32. Because log_b a = ln a / ln b. So, indeed, log₂32 = ln32 / ln2.Therefore, y = log₂32.But 32 is 2^5, so log₂32 = log₂(2^5) = 5. Because log base 2 of 2 to the 5th power is just 5.Wait, that seems too straightforward. So y equals 5? Then the answer should be option B: y=5.But let me double-check to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in the telescoping product.Starting with log₂3 × log₃4 × ... × log₃₁32. Convert each to natural logs:(ln3/ln2) × (ln4/ln3) × (ln5/ln4) × ... × (ln32/ln31).Yes, each ln3 cancels with the denominator of the next term, ln4 cancels with the denominator of the term after that, etc., all the way up. The only terms left are ln32 in the numerator and ln2 in the denominator. So y = ln32 / ln2 = log₂32.32 is 2^5, so log₂32 is 5. Therefore, y=5. So the correct answer is B.But wait, let me check the number of terms. The product starts at log₂3 and ends at log₃₁32. Let&#39;s verify how many terms there are.Each term is logₖ(k+1), starting from k=2 to k=31. So the bases go from 2 to 31, which is 30 terms. Wait, 31 - 2 + 1 = 30? Wait, 31 minus 2 is 29, plus 1 is 30. So there are 30 terms in the product.But when we multiply them, each term&#39;s numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term, so all intermediates cancel, leaving the first denominator (ln2) and the last numerator (ln32). So regardless of the number of terms, it&#39;s always going to be log base 2 of 32.But wait, if we start at log₂3 and go up to log₃₁32, the indices go from base 2 up to base 31. So the last term is log base 31 of 32. So the argument of each log is base n of (n+1). So the first term is log₂3, next log₃4, up to log₃₁32.So the product is (log₂3)(log₃4)...(log₃₁32). When written as natural logs, each term is ln(n+1)/ln(n) where n starts at 2 and goes up to 31.So the product is [ln3/ln2][ln4/ln3][ln5/ln4]...[ln32/ln31]. So yes, all the intermediates cancel, leaving ln32/ln2 = log₂32 = 5.So y=5. So the answer is B. But let me check again.Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as &quot;... ⋅ logₙ [n+1] ⋅ ... ⋅ log₃₁32&quot;. So the product is from n=2 to n=31 of logₙ(n+1). Then, when converted, it&#39;s a telescoping product resulting in log₂32=5. So y=5. Therefore, the answer is B.Wait, but just to be 100% sure, let&#39;s compute log₂32. 2^5 is 32, so log₂32=5. So y=5. So answer B.But wait, the original problem says: &quot;log_{n}[n+1]&quot; multiplied from some n up to log_{31}32. The index of the product is not entirely clear in the problem statement. Let me check again.The problem states: &quot;y=(log_2 3)(log_3 4) ⋅ … ⋅ (log_n [n+1]) ⋅ … ⋅ (log_{31} 32)&quot;. So it&#39;s a product where each term is log_k (k+1) with k starting at 2 and going up to 31. So the terms are log_23, log_34, ..., log_3132. So the product is from k=2 to k=31 of log_k (k+1). So that&#39;s 31 - 2 + 1 = 30 terms. But when you multiply them, as each term is ln(k+1)/ln(k), the product telescopes to ln(32)/ln(2) = log_232 = 5.So yes, regardless of the number of terms, as long as they form a telescoping product, the result is log_232. Which is 5 because 2^5=32. Therefore, y=5. So answer B.Alternatively, maybe the problem was written differently. Wait, but if the product started at log_23 and ended at log_3132, that is from base 2 to base 31, each term is log base k of (k+1). So the telescoping product gives log_2(32) because all the intermediate terms cancel. Hence, log_232=5. So y=5. Therefore, answer is B. Therefore, the correct option is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine the value of ( y ) which is the product of logarithms: ( y = left(log_{2} 3right)left(log_{3} 4right) cdot cdots cdot left(log_{31} 32right) ).First, we convert each logarithm using the natural logarithm (change of base formula):[log_{k} (k+1) = frac{ln (k+1)}{ln k}]Thus, the product becomes:[y = left( frac{ln 3}{ln 2} right) left( frac{ln 4}{ln 3} right) left( frac{ln 5}{ln 4} right) cdots left( frac{ln 32}{ln 31} right)]Notice that this is a telescoping product, where each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term. This simplifies to:[y = frac{ln 32}{ln 2}]Recognizing this as a logarithm, we have:[y = log_{2} 32]Since ( 32 = 2^5 ), we find:[log_{2} 32 = 5]Therefore, the value of ( y ) is 5, which corresponds to option B.[boxed{B}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>［Solution］ By the change of base formula, we havebegin{aligned}y &amp; =frac{lg 3}{lg 2} cdot frac{lg 4}{lg 3} ldots cdot frac{lg (n+1)}{lg n} ldots cdot frac{lg 31}{lg 30} cdot frac{lg 32}{lg 31} &amp; =frac{lg 32}{lg 2}=log _{2} 32=5 .end{aligned}Therefore, the correct choice is (B).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ccc77b65 data-v-22911720><div class="review" data-v-22911720><div class="review-title" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>❓:</span>## Problem StatementCalculate the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates.r=sqrt{3} cos phi, r=sin phi,left(0 leq phi leq frac{pi}{2}right)</div><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the area bounded by these two polar curves: r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, where φ is between 0 and π/2. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that the area in polar coordinates is calculated using the formula (1/2) ∫[a to b] r² dφ. But since there are two curves here, I probably need to find where they intersect and then set up the integral between those points. Let me sketch both curves mentally. The first one, r = √3 cos φ, is a polar equation of a circle. I recall that r = a cos φ is a circle with diameter &#39;a&#39; along the x-axis. Similarly, r = sin φ is another circle, but with diameter 1 along the y-axis. So, both are circles; one is larger, with radius √3/2, centered at (√3/2, 0), and the other has radius 1/2, centered at (0, 1/2). Since we&#39;re looking at φ from 0 to π/2, we&#39;re in the first quadrant. These circles should intersect somewhere in the first quadrant. To find the points of intersection, set √3 cos φ = sin φ. Let me solve for φ. Dividing both sides by cos φ (assuming cos φ ≠ 0), we get √3 = tan φ. So φ = arctan(√3) which is π/3. That makes sense since tan(π/3) is √3. So the two curves intersect at φ = π/3. Therefore, from 0 to π/3, one of the curves is outside, and from π/3 to π/2, the other is outside. I need to figure out which one is which.Let me test a value between 0 and π/3, say φ = π/6. For r1 = √3 cos(π/6) = √3*(√3/2) = 3/2. For r2 = sin(π/6) = 1/2. So at π/6, the first curve is outside. Then between π/3 and π/2, let&#39;s take φ = π/2. But wait, at φ = π/2, cos φ is 0, so r1 = 0. And r2 = sin(π/2) = 1. So at π/2, the second curve is at 1, while the first is at 0. So between π/3 and π/2, r = sin φ is the outer curve. Therefore, the area should be split into two parts: from 0 to π/3, the area is under r = √3 cos φ, and from π/3 to π/2, it&#39;s under r = sin φ. Wait, but actually, the bounded area is the region where both curves overlap. Hmm, maybe I need to subtract the inner area from the outer area? Wait, no. When two curves intersect, the area bounded by them is found by integrating the outer curve minus the inner curve between the points of intersection.So in this case, from 0 to π/3, the outer curve is r = √3 cos φ, and the inner one is r = sin φ. Wait, but actually, we need to check if that&#39;s the case. Wait, maybe both curves are overlapping such that between 0 and π/3, the first curve is outside, and from π/3 to π/2, the second curve is outside. So the area bounded by both curves would be the area from 0 to π/3 under the first curve, plus the area from π/3 to π/2 under the second curve. But actually, no. Because the bounded area is where both curves are overlapping. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize it.Imagine the two circles in the first quadrant. The first circle (r = √3 cos φ) is bigger, extending from the origin out to (√3, 0) when φ=0. The second circle (r = sin φ) is smaller, centered on the y-axis, going up to (0,1) when φ=π/2. They intersect at φ=π/3. So the region bounded by both curves is like a lens shape between φ=0 to φ=π/2. But to find the area that&#39;s inside both curves, we need to compute the area that is inside both circles. Hmm, actually, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates.&quot; Maybe it&#39;s the area that is bounded by both curves. So from φ=0 to φ=π/3, the outer boundary is r = √3 cos φ, and from φ=π/3 to φ=π/2, the outer boundary is r = sin φ. So the total area would be the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1/2)(√3 cos φ)^2 dφ plus the integral from π/3 to π/2 of (1/2)(sin φ)^2 dφ. But wait, is that correct? Because if we are looking for the area bounded by both curves, then yes. Because each part is bounded by one of the curves and the angle limits. Let me confirm.Alternatively, sometimes when two curves intersect, the area between them is the integral of the outer curve minus the inner curve between the intersection angles. But in this case, since the curves cross each other at φ=π/3, before that angle, one is outside, after that angle, the other is outside. Therefore, the area bounded by both curves would be the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1/2)( (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ) dφ plus the integral from π/3 to π/2 of (1/2)( (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ) dφ. Wait, but actually, since from 0 to π/3, the outer curve is √3 cos φ, so the area between the two curves there would be the area under √3 cos φ minus the area under sin φ. But wait, but actually, if we are to find the area bounded by both curves, perhaps it&#39;s just the union or intersection. Wait, the problem says &quot;figures bounded by lines&quot;. So it&#39;s the region that is inside both curves? Or the region that is between the two curves?Wait, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The problem states &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates.&quot; So, in polar coordinates, when you have two curves, the area bounded by them would typically be the region that is inside both curves. But in this case, since they cross each other, maybe it&#39;s the area that is inside one and outside the other, but in different regions. Wait, perhaps the bounded area is the region that is common to both? Or the region enclosed by both curves?Wait, let&#39;s think of the graphs. The circle r = √3 cos φ is centered at (√3/2, 0) with radius √3/2. The circle r = sin φ is centered at (0, 1/2) with radius 1/2. So in Cartesian coordinates, the first circle is larger, sitting on the x-axis, and the second is smaller, sitting on the y-axis. Their intersection in the first quadrant is at φ=π/3. So the region bounded by both lines would be the lens-shaped area where the two circles overlap. To compute that, we can calculate the area from 0 to π/3 under the first circle minus the area under the second circle, then add the area from π/3 to π/2 under the second circle minus the first circle. But actually, the overlapping area is the sum of the area from 0 to π/3 under the first circle plus the area from π/3 to π/2 under the second circle, but that would give the total area of both regions. Wait, no. Let me clarify.Wait, no. If you have two intersecting circles, the area of their intersection (the lens shape) can be calculated by integrating the difference between the two curves from the first intersection angle to the second. But in this case, since both curves are defined from 0 to π/2 and intersect only once at π/3, the overlapping region is bounded by both curves from 0 to π/2. But maybe the overlapping area is actually between the two curves from 0 to π/3 (where one is above the other) and then from π/3 to π/2 (where the other is above). Therefore, to compute the area of the overlapping region, we need to compute the integral from 0 to π/3 of the upper curve minus the lower curve, and then from π/3 to π/2, the upper curve minus the lower curve again. But in this case, which one is upper and which is lower?Wait, but in polar coordinates, &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; aren&#39;t straightforward. Instead, it&#39;s about which curve is farther from the origin in a given angle. So from φ=0 to φ=π/3, √3 cos φ is greater than sin φ, so the outer boundary is √3 cos φ and the inner boundary is sin φ. From φ=π/3 to φ=π/2, sin φ is greater than √3 cos φ, so the outer boundary is sin φ and the inner boundary is √3 cos φ. Therefore, the area bounded by both curves is the area between the two curves from 0 to π/2. So to compute this, we can compute the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1/2)( (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ) dφ plus the integral from π/3 to π/2 of (1/2)( (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ) dφ. But actually, since (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 is the same as 3 cos²φ - sin²φ, and similarly for the other integral. Let me write that down.So total area A = (1/2)[ ∫₀^{π/3} (3 cos²φ - sin²φ) dφ + ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} (sin²φ - 3 cos²φ) dφ ]Alternatively, since the integrand in the second integral is negative of the first, but over a different interval. Let me check if that&#39;s necessary.Alternatively, maybe we can just take the absolute difference. But since we know which one is larger in each interval, we can set up the integrals accordingly.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way by using symmetry or trigonometric identities.But let&#39;s proceed step by step.First, compute the integral from 0 to π/3 of 3 cos²φ - sin²φ dφ.Then, compute the integral from π/3 to π/2 of sin²φ - 3 cos²φ dφ.So let&#39;s compute each integral separately.First Integral: I₁ = ∫₀^{π/3} (3 cos²φ - sin²φ) dφSecond Integral: I₂ = ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} (sin²φ - 3 cos²φ) dφThen total area A = (1/2)(I₁ + I₂)To compute these integrals, we can use the power-reduction identities:cos²φ = (1 + cos 2φ)/2sin²φ = (1 - cos 2φ)/2So let&#39;s rewrite both integrands.First, for I₁:3 cos²φ - sin²φ = 3*(1 + cos 2φ)/2 - (1 - cos 2φ)/2= (3/2)(1 + cos 2φ) - (1/2)(1 - cos 2φ)= (3/2 + 3/2 cos 2φ) - 1/2 + (1/2 cos 2φ)= (3/2 - 1/2) + (3/2 cos 2φ + 1/2 cos 2φ)= 1 + 2 cos 2φSimilarly, for I₂:sin²φ - 3 cos²φ = (1 - cos 2φ)/2 - 3*(1 + cos 2φ)/2= (1/2 - 1/2 cos 2φ) - (3/2 + 3/2 cos 2φ)= 1/2 - 3/2 + (-1/2 cos 2φ - 3/2 cos 2φ)= -1 - 2 cos 2φTherefore, the integrals become:I₁ = ∫₀^{π/3} [1 + 2 cos 2φ] dφI₂ = ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} [-1 - 2 cos 2φ] dφLet&#39;s compute I₁ first:Integral of 1 dφ is φIntegral of 2 cos 2φ dφ is 2*(1/2) sin 2φ = sin 2φTherefore, I₁ = [φ + sin 2φ] from 0 to π/3At π/3:φ = π/3, sin 2*(π/3) = sin(2π/3) = √3/2At 0:φ = 0, sin 0 = 0Therefore, I₁ = (π/3 + √3/2) - (0 + 0) = π/3 + √3/2Now compute I₂:Integral of -1 dφ is -φIntegral of -2 cos 2φ dφ is -2*(1/2 sin 2φ) = -sin 2φTherefore, I₂ = [-φ - sin 2φ] from π/3 to π/2At π/2:-π/2 - sin(π) = -π/2 - 0 = -π/2At π/3:-π/3 - sin(2π/3) = -π/3 - (√3/2)Therefore, I₂ = (-π/2) - (-π/3 - √3/2) = -π/2 + π/3 + √3/2Simplify:Convert to common denominator, which is 6:- (3π/6) + (2π/6) = -π/6So I₂ = -π/6 + √3/2Therefore, total area A = (1/2)(I₁ + I₂) = (1/2)[ (π/3 + √3/2) + (-π/6 + √3/2) ]Combine terms:π/3 - π/6 = π/6√3/2 + √3/2 = √3Therefore, A = (1/2)(π/6 + √3) = π/12 + √3/2Wait, so the final area is π/12 plus √3 over 2.But let me check the calculations again because I want to be sure.First, I₁ was computed as π/3 + √3/2.I₂ was computed as -π/6 + √3/2.Adding them together:π/3 + √3/2 - π/6 + √3/2π/3 - π/6 is π/6, and √3/2 + √3/2 is √3.So total I₁ + I₂ = π/6 + √3Multiply by 1/2: (π/6 + √3)/2 = π/12 + √3/2Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the sign during I₂. Let&#39;s re-express:I₂ = [-φ - sin 2φ] from π/3 to π/2= [ -π/2 - sin π ] - [ -π/3 - sin(2π/3) ]= [ -π/2 - 0 ] - [ -π/3 - (√3/2) ]= -π/2 + π/3 + √3/2Which is equal to (-3π/6 + 2π/6) + √3/2 = (-π/6) + √3/2, which is correct.So the sum I₁ + I₂ is π/3 + √3/2 - π/6 + √3/2 = π/6 + √3.Multiply by 1/2 gives π/12 + √3/2.Therefore, the area bounded by the two curves is π/12 + (√3)/2.But let me check if that makes sense. Let&#39;s think of the areas of each circle.The first circle, r = √3 cos φ, is a circle with radius √3/2. Its area is π*(√3/2)^2 = π*(3/4) = 3π/4. However, since we&#39;re only integrating from 0 to π/2, but actually, the entire circle is traced from -π/2 to π/2. Wait, but in our case, φ is from 0 to π/2, so we have a quarter of the circle? Wait, no. Wait, r = √3 cos φ is a circle that is complete in the range φ = -π/2 to π/2. But since φ is given from 0 to π/2, we&#39;re only getting the part of the circle in the first quadrant. Similarly, r = sin φ is a circle that is complete in φ = 0 to π. So in our case, from 0 to π/2, we have a semicircle? Wait, no. For r = sin φ, when φ ranges from 0 to π, it traces a circle above the x-axis. But in our problem, φ is only up to π/2, so that&#39;s a quarter-circle?Wait, maybe this is complicating. Alternatively, if we compute the area of each curve in the given angle interval and subtract appropriately.But according to our calculation, the area is π/12 + √3/2.Let me compute each part&#39;s area separately.First, the area under r = √3 cos φ from 0 to π/3:A1 = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} (√3 cos φ)^2 dφ = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} 3 cos²φ dφSimilarly, the area under r = sin φ from π/3 to π/2:A2 = (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} (sin φ)^2 dφBut the total area bounded by both curves is A1 + A2. Wait, but according to the previous approach, we considered the difference between the two curves. So which is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. If the problem is asking for the area bounded by both curves, it&#39;s the area that is inside both curves. However, given the two circles, the overlapping region (lens shape) would actually require subtracting the areas outside each other. Wait, maybe not. Wait, in Cartesian coordinates, the area of intersection of two circles can be calculated using the formula for lens area, which involves the radii and the distance between centers. But here, since we are in polar coordinates, maybe integrating is the way to go.Alternatively, since we have polar equations, the method we used earlier is correct. Let&#39;s confirm with a different approach.If we consider the area bounded by both curves, from φ=0 to φ=π/3, the outer boundary is r = √3 cos φ, and the inner boundary is r = sin φ. Then from φ=π/3 to φ=π/2, the outer boundary is r = sin φ and inner is r = √3 cos φ. Therefore, the total area is the area between the two curves from 0 to π/3 plus the area between the two curves from π/3 to π/2. So that&#39;s:A = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} [ (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ] dφ + (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} [ (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ] dφWhich is exactly what we computed earlier, leading to π/12 + √3/2.But let&#39;s check with another approach. Suppose we compute the area of the lens-shaped intersection using the Cartesian method. The two circles have equations:First circle: r = √3 cos φ =&gt; x = r cos φ = √3 cos² φ, y = r sin φ = √3 cos φ sin φ. To convert to Cartesian, note that r = √3 cos φ =&gt; r = √3 (x/r) =&gt; r² = √3 x =&gt; x² + y² = √3 x =&gt; x² - √3 x + y² = 0 =&gt; (x - √3/2)^2 + y² = (√3/2)^2. So center at (√3/2, 0), radius √3/2.Second circle: r = sin φ =&gt; r = y/r =&gt; r² = y =&gt; x² + y² = y =&gt; x² + y² - y = 0 =&gt; x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = (1/2)^2. So center at (0, 1/2), radius 1/2.The distance between centers is sqrt( (√3/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1/2)^2 ) = sqrt( 3/4 + 1/4 ) = sqrt(1) = 1.The radii are √3/2 and 1/2. The formula for the area of intersection of two circles is:A = r² cos⁻¹(d² + r² - R²)/(2dr) + R² cos⁻¹(d² + R² - r²)/(2dR) - 0.5*sqrt((-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R))Where d is the distance between centers, r and R are the radii.But plugging in the values:r = √3/2, R = 1/2, d = 1.First term: ( (√3/2 )² ) * cos⁻¹( (1² + (√3/2 )² - (1/2)^2 ) / (2*1*(√3/2)) ) Compute the argument:(1 + 3/4 - 1/4) / (2*(√3/2)) = (1 + 2/4) / (√3) = (1 + 1/2)/√3 = (3/2)/√3 = (3)/(2√3) = √3/2So the first term is (3/4) * cos⁻¹(√3/2) = (3/4)*(π/6) = 3π/24 = π/8Second term: ( (1/2)^2 ) * cos⁻¹( (1² + (1/2)^2 - (√3/2)^2 ) / (2*1*(1/2)) )Compute the argument:(1 + 1/4 - 3/4) / (1) = (1 - 2/4)/1 = (1 - 1/2) = 1/2So the second term is (1/4) * cos⁻¹(1/2) = (1/4)*(π/3) = π/12Third term: 0.5*sqrt( (-1 + √3/2 + 1/2)(1 + √3/2 - 1/2)(1 - √3/2 + 1/2)(1 + √3/2 + 1/2) )Simplify each term:First bracket: (-1 + (√3 + 1)/2 ) = ( -2 + √3 +1 )/2 = (-1 + √3)/2Second bracket: (1 + (√3 -1)/2 ) = (2 + √3 -1)/2 = (1 + √3)/2Third bracket: (1 - √3/2 +1/2 ) = (3/2 - √3/2 )Fourth bracket: (1 + √3/2 +1/2 ) = (3/2 + √3/2 )Multiply all together:sqrt( [ (-1 + √3)/2 * (1 + √3)/2 * (3/2 - √3/2 ) * (3/2 + √3/2 ) ] )Note that (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². Let&#39;s apply this where possible.First pair: [ (-1 + √3)/2 * (1 + √3)/2 ] = [ ( (√3 -1)(√3 +1) ) /4 ] = ( (3 -1) ) /4 = 2/4 = 1/2Second pair: [ (3/2 - √3/2 ) * (3/2 + √3/2 ) ] = ( (3/2)^2 - (√3/2)^2 ) = 9/4 - 3/4 = 6/4 = 3/2So inside sqrt: 1/2 * 3/2 = 3/4Therefore, sqrt(3/4) = √3/2Third term: 0.5 * √3/2 = √3/4So total area A = π/8 + π/12 - √3/4Convert π terms to common denominator:π/8 = 3π/24π/12 = 2π/24Sum: 5π/24 - √3/4But according to our previous calculation, we had π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 0.2618 + 0.866 ≈ 1.1278But using the Cartesian formula, we have 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈ 0.6545 - 0.4330 ≈ 0.2215, which is different. Hmm, this suggests a problem.But wait, which one is correct? There must be a mistake here. Let me check the Cartesian formula again.Wait, the formula for the area of intersection of two circles is:A = r² cos⁻¹( (d² + r² - R²)/(2dr) ) + R² cos⁻¹( (d² + R² - r²)/(2dR) ) - 0.5*sqrt( [ -d + r + R ][ d + r - R ][ d - r + R ][ d + r + R ] )Plugging in:r = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, R = 1/2 = 0.5, d = 1First term: ( (√3/2 )² ) * cos⁻¹( (1 + (√3/2 )² - (1/2 )² ) / (2*1*(√3/2 )) )Compute the argument inside arccos:Numerator: 1 + 3/4 - 1/4 = 1 + 2/4 = 1.5Denominator: 2*(√3/2) = √3 ≈ 1.732So argument: 1.5 / 1.732 ≈ 0.866, which is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So arccos(√3/2 ) = π/6, not π/8.Wait, but in the first term, we have r² times arccos(...), so:First term: ( (3/4 ) ) * π/6 = (3/4)(π/6 ) = π/8 ≈ 0.3927Second term: R² arccos( (d² + R² - r² )/(2dR ) )Compute argument:(1 + 0.25 - 0.75 ) / (2*1*0.5 ) = (0.5) / 1 = 0.5arccos(0.5) = π/3So second term: (0.25) * π/3 = π/12 ≈ 0.2618Third term: 0.5*sqrt( [ -1 + 0.866 + 0.5 ][ 1 + 0.866 - 0.5 ][ 1 - 0.866 + 0.5 ][ 1 + 0.866 + 0.5 ] )Compute each bracket:First: -1 + 0.866 + 0.5 ≈ 0.366Second: 1 + 0.866 - 0.5 ≈ 1.366Third: 1 - 0.866 + 0.5 ≈ 0.634Fourth: 1 + 0.866 + 0.5 ≈ 2.366Multiply all: 0.366 * 1.366 * 0.634 * 2.366 ≈ let&#39;s compute step by step.0.366 * 1.366 ≈ 0.366 * 1 = 0.366, 0.366 * 0.366 ≈ 0.134, total ≈ 0.366 + 0.134 ≈ 0.50.634 * 2.366 ≈ 0.634*2 = 1.268, 0.634*0.366 ≈ 0.232, total ≈ 1.268 + 0.232 ≈ 1.5Then total product ≈ 0.5 * 1.5 = 0.75sqrt(0.75 ) ≈ 0.866Third term: 0.5 * 0.866 ≈ 0.433Therefore, total area A = π/8 + π/12 - 0.433 ≈ 0.3927 + 0.2618 - 0.433 ≈ 0.2215But according to our polar coordinate integral, we had π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 0.2618 + 0.866 ≈ 1.1278These are vastly different. So there&#39;s a conflict here. Which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I messed up the interpretation of the problem. The problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. It might not be the intersection area, but the area bounded by both curves in the specified angle range. Since both curves are defined from 0 to π/2, maybe the bounded area is the region that is inside both curves in that interval. But according to the Cartesian calculation, that area is approximately 0.2215, while the polar integral gives approximately 1.1278. These are very different.Alternatively, perhaps the formula in Cartesian coordinates is not applicable here because the circles are only partially present in the first quadrant. Wait, no. The entire intersection of the two circles is in the first quadrant, because the centers are at (√3/2, 0) and (0, 1/2), both in the first quadrant, and the distance between centers is 1. Given the radii √3/2 ≈ 0.866 and 1/2, the circles intersect in two points, but since they are both in the first quadrant, maybe both intersection points are in the first quadrant. Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s see.Wait, if two circles with centers at (√3/2, 0) and (0, 1/2), with radii √3/2 and 1/2 respectively. The first circle extends from x = 0 (when φ=π/2) to x = √3 (when φ=0), but actually, when φ=0, r=√3*1=√3, but since the circle has radius √3/2, the maximum x is √3/2 + √3/2 = √3. Wait, no. Wait, the circle r = √3 cos φ is a circle with diameter √3 along the x-axis. So it goes from (0,0) to (√3, 0), centered at (√3/2, 0). The other circle, r = sin φ, is a circle with diameter 1 along the y-axis, going from (0,0) to (0,1), centered at (0,1/2). The distance between centers is 1. The radii are √3/2 and 1/2. The sum of radii is √3/2 + 1/2 ≈ 0.866 + 0.5 = 1.366, which is greater than the distance between centers (1), so they intersect. The difference of radii is √3/2 - 1/2 ≈ 0.366, which is less than the distance between centers (1), so they intersect at two points. However, in the first quadrant, both circles are present, and intersect at φ=π/3 as we found earlier. So the area computed via polar coordinates should match the Cartesian formula.But according to our previous integral, we have a much larger area. So where&#39;s the mistake?Wait, let&#39;s compute the area given by the polar integral:π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 0.2618 + 0.866 ≈ 1.1278But the Cartesian intersection area is approximately 0.2215, which is much smaller. So clearly, there&#39;s a misunderstanding in the problem.Wait, perhaps the problem is not asking for the area of intersection, but the area bounded by the two curves and the angle boundaries φ=0 and φ=π/2. That is, the region that is inside both curves and between φ=0 and φ=π/2. But in this case, the area would be different.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the area that is inside one curve and outside the other, within the given angle range. But the problem says &quot;figures bounded by lines&quot;, which is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the problem.&quot;Calculate the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates.r=√3 cos φ, r=sin φ, (0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2)&quot;So, the region is bounded by these two curves and the angle limits. So, in other words, the region is enclosed by both curves and the rays φ=0 and φ=π/2. But in this case, φ=0 is the positive x-axis, and φ=π/2 is the positive y-axis. The two curves intersect at φ=π/3. So, the bounded area is likely the region that is between the two curves from φ=0 to φ=π/3, and then from φ=π/3 to φ=π/2, between the curves and bounded by φ=π/2. Wait, maybe it&#39;s the region that is inside both curves from φ=0 to φ=π/2. But that would be the intersection area, which we computed via Cartesian as 0.2215.But according to the polar integral, we have a different area. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the area between the two curves from φ=0 to φ=π/2, which would be the integral of the difference between the squares of the two functions. But according to the problem statement, it&#39;s the area bounded by the lines, which are r=√3 cos φ and r=sin φ, within the given angle range. So it&#39;s the area that is inside both of these curves.Wait, but in that case, since both curves are circles, their intersection is a lens shape, whose area can be calculated via the Cartesian formula. However, in polar coordinates, integrating from 0 to π/3 the area between the two circles, and from π/3 to π/2 also between the two circles gives the lens shape area. But according to our calculation, the integral gives a different result than the Cartesian formula, which is a problem.Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the Cartesian calculation. Let me recheck:Given two circles:1. Center (√3/2, 0), radius √3/22. Center (0, 1/2), radius 1/2The distance between centers is 1.Using the formula for area of intersection:A = r² cos⁻¹( (d² + r² - R²)/(2dr) ) + R² cos⁻¹( (d² + R² - r²)/(2dR) ) - 0.5*sqrt( (-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R) )Plugging in:r = √3/2 ≈0.866, R=1/2=0.5, d=1First term: ( (√3/2 )² ) * cos⁻¹( (1 + 3/4 - 1/4 ) / (2*1*√3/2 ) ) = (3/4) * cos⁻¹( (1.5 ) / (√3 ) )Calculate (1.5)/√3 ≈ 1.5/1.732 ≈ 0.866, which is cos(π/6). So arccos(0.866) = π/6.Thus first term: (3/4)(π/6 ) = π/8 ≈0.3927Second term: (1/2)² * cos⁻¹( (1 + 1/4 - 3/4 ) / (2*1*(1/2)) ) = (1/4) * cos⁻¹( (0.5 ) /1 ) = (1/4)(π/3 ) = π/12 ≈0.2618Third term: 0.5*sqrt( (-1 + √3/2 +1/2 )(1 + √3/2 -1/2 )(1 -√3/2 +1/2 )(1 +√3/2 +1/2 ) )Compute each term:1. (-1 + √3/2 +1/2 ) = (-1 + 0.866 +0.5 ) = 0.3662. (1 + √3/2 -1/2 ) = (0.5 + 0.866 ) =1.3663. (1 -√3/2 +1/2 ) = (1.5 -0.866 )=0.6344. (1 +√3/2 +1/2 ) =1.5 +0.866≈2.366Multiply all terms: 0.366 *1.366 *0.634 *2.366 ≈ Let&#39;s compute step by step:First, 0.366*1.366≈0.5 (as before)Second, 0.634*2.366≈1.5 (as before)Thus, product≈0.5*1.5=0.75sqrt(0.75 )≈0.866Third term:0.5*0.866≈0.433Thus, total area≈0.3927 +0.2618 -0.433≈0.2215But according to our polar coordinate integral, we have π/12 +√3/2≈0.2618+0.866≈1.1278, which is much larger. Clearly, a discrepancy. So where&#39;s the mistake?Wait, the problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. The term &quot;figures bounded by lines&quot; might imply the region bounded by both curves and the rays φ=0 and φ=π/2. So, in this case, it&#39;s not the intersection of the two circles, but the area bounded by both curves between φ=0 and φ=π/2. In other words, imagine the region that is between the two curves from φ=0 to φ=π/3, and then from φ=π/3 to φ=π/2, bounded by the curves and the angle limits. But in that case, the area would be different. Wait, perhaps the area is composed of two parts:1. From φ=0 to φ=π/3, the region is between r=0 (origin) up to r=√3 cos φ, and from φ=π/3 to φ=π/2, between r=0 and r=sin φ. But that would just be the area under both curves combined, which is simply the sum of their individual areas in that interval.But that can&#39;t be, because the problem says &quot;bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;, which are the two curves.Alternatively, perhaps the bounded area is the region that is inside both curves. But that would be the intersection, which the Cartesian formula says is approximately 0.2215, but our polar integral says ≈1.1278. So that can&#39;t be.Alternatively, maybe the mistake is in the polar integral setup. Let me check again.The curves are r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ. From φ=0 to φ=π/3, √3 cos φ is larger, and from π/3 to π/2, sin φ is larger. So the area bounded by both curves would be the area lying between the two curves. So the area should be the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1/2)( (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ) dφ plus the integral from π/3 to π/2 of (1/2)( (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ) dφ.But when I calculated that, I got A = π/12 + √3/2. However, according to Cartesian, the intersection area is approximately 0.2215, which is roughly π/12 (≈0.2618) minus something, but my result is bigger. Wait, actually, π/12 + √3/2 ≈0.2618 +0.866≈1.1278, which is larger than the entire first quadrant area of either circle.The area of the first circle (r = √3 cos φ) in the first quadrant is (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} (√3 cos φ)^2 dφ = (1/2)*∫₀^{π/2} 3 cos²φ dφ = (3/2)*(1/2)(π/2 + 0) )= 3π/8 ≈1.178. But the bounded area can&#39;t be larger than the area of the first circle in the first quadrant. Wait, but according to our polar integral, the area is ≈1.1278, which is close to 3π/8 ≈1.178. So maybe it&#39;s correct.But according to the Cartesian formula, the intersection area is ≈0.2215, which is much smaller. So why the discrepancy?Ah! I think the key is that the Cartesian formula gives the area of overlap between the two circles, while the polar integral calculates the area bounded by the two curves and the rays φ=0 and φ=π/2. These are different regions. In other words, if you imagine the two circles in the first quadrant, they intersect at φ=π/3. The region bounded by both curves and the rays φ=0 and φ=π/2 is the area that is below r=√3 cos φ from 0 to π/3, and below r=sin φ from π/3 to π/2. This forms a sort of crescent shape, but not the overlapping lens. Thus, the area computed via the polar integral is actually the area of the region bounded on the left by φ=0, on the right by φ=π/2, below by the origin, and above by the two curves switching at φ=π/3. But this is not the intersection area. Instead, it&#39;s the union of the areas under each curve within their respective dominant angles.But why is this different from the Cartesian intersection area? Because the Cartesian intersection is the region common to both circles, whereas the polar integral here is the region bounded by the two curves and the two angle lines. So they are different regions. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous, but given that it&#39;s specified in polar coordinates with angle limits, it&#39;s likely asking for the area bounded by the two curves and the rays φ=0 and φ=π/2. Therefore, the correct answer is the one computed via the polar integral: π/12 + √3/2.But to verify, let&#39;s compute the areas separately.Area under r = √3 cos φ from 0 to π/3:A1 = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} 3 cos²φ dφ = (3/2)*(1/2)(φ + (sin 2φ)/2 ) from 0 to π/3= (3/4)[ π/3 + (sin 2π/3)/2 - 0 -0 ] = (3/4)(π/3 + (√3/2)/2 ) = (3/4)(π/3 + √3/4 ) = π/4 + 3√3/16Area under r = sin φ from π/3 to π/2:A2 = (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} sin²φ dφ = (1/2)*(1/2)(φ - (sin 2φ)/2 ) from π/3 to π/2= (1/4)[ (π/2 - 0) - (π/3 - (sin 2π/3)/2 ) ]= (1/4)[ π/2 - π/3 + (√3/2)/2 ]= (1/4)(π/6 + √3/4 )= π/24 + √3/16Total area A = A1 + A2 = π/4 + 3√3/16 + π/24 + √3/16 = (π/4 + π/24) + (3√3/16 + √3/16) = (6π/24 + π/24) + (4√3/16 ) = 7π/24 + √3/4 ≈0.916 +0.433≈1.349Wait, this contradicts the previous result. What&#39;s happening here?Wait, let&#39;s compute A1 and A2 properly.First, A1 = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} 3 cos²φ dφ = (3/2) ∫₀^{π/3} cos²φ dφUsing cos²φ = (1 + cos 2φ)/2:A1 = (3/2) * (1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} (1 + cos 2φ ) dφ = (3/4)[ φ + (sin 2φ)/2 ] from 0 to π/3= (3/4)[ π/3 + (sin 2π/3)/2 - 0 -0 ]= (3/4)( π/3 + (√3/2)/2 )= (3/4)( π/3 + √3/4 )= (3/4)(π/3) + (3/4)(√3/4 )= π/4 + 3√3/16 ≈0.785 +0.324≈1.109Similarly, A2 = (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} sin²φ dφ = (1/2) * (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} (1 - cos 2φ ) dφ = (1/4)[ φ - (sin 2φ)/2 ] from π/3 to π/2= (1/4)[ (π/2 - (sin π)/2 ) - (π/3 - (sin 2π/3)/2 ) ]= (1/4)[ π/2 - 0 - π/3 + (sin 2π/3)/2 ]= (1/4)( π/6 + (√3/2)/2 )= (1/4)( π/6 + √3/4 )= π/24 + √3/16 ≈0.1309 +0.108≈0.2389Total area A1 + A2 ≈1.109 +0.2389≈1.3479But according to the previous method, we had π/12 +√3/2≈0.2618 +0.866≈1.1278. These are different.Wait, so now I have three different results: Cartesian intersection area≈0.2215, polar integral≈1.1278, and separate areas sum≈1.3479.This is very confusing. Clearly, something is wrong with my approach.Wait, perhaps the initial integral setup is incorrect. Let&#39;s go back.The problem is to find the area bounded by the two curves r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ in the interval φ=0 to φ=π/2.To find the area bounded by both curves, we need to determine the region that is enclosed by both curves. Since they intersect at φ=π/3, from 0 to π/3, the outer boundary is r = √3 cos φ, and from π/3 to π/2, the outer boundary is r = sin φ. However, the area bounded by both curves is the region that is inside both curves. But wait, in this case, since one curve is outside the other in different intervals, the area bounded by both curves would actually require subtracting the inner areas.Wait, no. If we want the area that is inside both curves, that is their intersection, which is the lens shape. But according to the previous calculation, that is approximately 0.2215. However, the problem states &quot;figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. If &quot;lines&quot; refer to the two curves, then the area bounded by both curves is their intersection, which would be the lens shape. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one from the Cartesian formula, but that contradicts the polar integral.But why is there a discrepancy?Wait, maybe the problem is not in the first quadrant? No, the problem specifies 0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2.Alternatively, perhaps the polar integral is correct, and the Cartesian formula is incorrect because the circles are only partially present in the first quadrant. Wait, but the Cartesian formula calculates the entire intersection area, regardless of the quadrant. However, if the circles are only present in the first quadrant due to the angle limitation, then the intersection area is just the part in the first quadrant, which is half of the lens. But in our case, both circles are entirely in the first quadrant?Wait, the first circle, r = √3 cos φ, when φ ranges from 0 to π/2, r goes from √3 to 0. But in Cartesian coordinates, that&#39;s a circle in the first quadrant from (√3, 0) to (0,0). Similarly, r = sin φ, when φ is from 0 to π/2, goes from 0 to 1. So both curves are entirely in the first quadrant. Wait, but the first circle, centered at (√3/2, 0) with radius √3/2, extends from x=0 to x=√3 in the first quadrant. The second circle, centered at (0, 1/2) with radius 1/2, extends from y=0 to y=1. So their intersection is a lens shape entirely in the first quadrant. Therefore, the Cartesian formula should apply, and the area should be approximately 0.2215. However, the polar integral method gave a different result.But perhaps the error is in the polar integral setup.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. If we parameterize the area of intersection of the two circles, it&#39;s symmetric with respect to the line connecting their centers. But in this case, the line connecting the centers is from (√3/2, 0) to (0, 1/2), which is not along an axis. However, in polar coordinates, integrating from 0 to π/2 might not capture the entire intersection area, but only a part of it.Alternatively, maybe the mistake is that when we set up the polar integral, we&#39;re assuming that the radial lines from the origin bound the area, but the actual intersection area is not radially symmetric.Wait, the key issue is that the area of intersection of two circles cannot always be easily computed in polar coordinates, especially when the circles are not centered at the origin. In this case, both circles are not centered at the origin, so their polar equations are more complicated.Wait, but here&#39;s the thing: even though the Cartesian centers are not at the origin, their polar equations are simple. So perhaps the polar integral is the correct way to compute the area specified by the problem.But according to the problem statement, we are to calculate the area bounded by the lines given in polar coordinates: r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, within 0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2. Therefore, the region is bounded by these two curves and the two angles. This is the region that is inside both curves within the specified angles. In this case, the correct approach is to set up the polar integrals as we did initially, which gives A = π/12 + √3/2. However, this conflicts with the Cartesian calculation, which suggests there&#39;s an error in assumption.Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises from different interpretations of &quot;bounded by&quot;. If the region is bounded by both curves and the two angle lines, then the area is indeed the sum of the areas under each curve from 0 to π/3 and π/3 to π/2, which is A1 + A2 ≈1.3479. But according to the initial integral setup, which subtracts the inner curve, we get A = π/12 + √3/2≈1.1278. Which is different. But why?Wait, no. The initial integral setup computes the area between the two curves. That is, from 0 to π/3, the area between the two curves is outer (√3 cos φ) minus inner (sin φ), and from π/3 to π/2, outer (sin φ) minus inner (√3 cos φ). This should give the area between the two curves, which is the lens shape. However, according to our calculation, this gives ≈1.1278, while the Cartesian formula gives ≈0.2215. This is a problem.Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the polar integral limits. The curves r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ intersect at φ=π/3, but maybe there&#39;s another intersection point within 0 to π/2. Let&#39;s check.Setting √3 cos φ = sin φ =&gt; tan φ = √3 =&gt; φ=π/3. That&#39;s the only solution in 0 to π/2. So only one intersection point.So the area between the curves should be the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1/2)( (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ) dφ plus the integral from π/3 to π/2 of (1/2)( (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ) dφ.But as computed, this gives A = π/12 + √3/2≈1.1278. However, according to the Cartesian formula, the intersection area is≈0.2215. So why the difference?Wait, I think the issue is that the polar integral approach calculates the area between the two curves within the given angle range, which is different from the intersection area of the two circles. The two circles extend beyond the given angle range of 0 to π/2. For example, the circle r = √3 cos φ exists from φ = -π/2 to π/2, but we&#39;re only considering φ = 0 to π/2. Similarly, the circle r = sin φ exists from φ = 0 to π, but we&#39;re only considering φ = 0 to π/2. Therefore, the area calculated via the polar integral is the area between the two curves within the first quadrant, which is part of the intersection lens, but not the entire intersection. However, the Cartesian formula calculates the entire intersection area, which is in the first quadrant. Therefore, there&#39;s a contradiction.But wait, the two circles are both entirely in the first quadrant when considering φ from 0 to π/2. Therefore, their intersection area should also be entirely in the first quadrant. Therefore, the Cartesian formula&#39;s result of ≈0.2215 should be the correct area of intersection, and the polar integral must be wrong.But then why does the polar integral give a different result? Let&#39;s check if the polar integral indeed calculates the area between the two curves within the first quadrant.Yes, integrating from 0 to π/3 the difference between the two curves, and then from π/3 to π/2 the reverse difference, should give the area between the two curves in the first quadrant, which is the same as their intersection area. But according to calculations, it&#39;s not. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the setup.Wait, let&#39;s try evaluating both areas.First, using the Cartesian formula:A = 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈0.6545 -0.433≈0.2215Using the polar integral:A = π/12 + √3/2 ≈0.2618 +0.866≈1.1278But these are very different. To resolve this, perhaps I need to graph both curves and see the area in question.The first curve, r = √3 cos φ, in the first quadrant from φ=0 to π/2, starts at (√3, 0) when φ=0 and goes to (0,0) when φ=π/2. This is a semicircle in the first quadrant, diameter along the x-axis from (0,0) to (√3, 0), center at (√3/2, 0).The second curve, r = sin φ, in the first quadrant from φ=0 to π/2, starts at (0,0) when φ=0 and goes to (0,1) when φ=π/2. This is a semicircle in the first quadrant, diameter along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,1), center at (0,1/2).Their intersection is at φ=π/3, point (sqrt{3}/2 * cos(pi/3), sqrt{3}/2 * sin(pi/3)) for the first curve, which is (sqrt{3}/2 * 1/2, sqrt{3}/2 * sqrt{3}/2) = (sqrt{3}/4, 3/4). For the second curve, the same point is (sin(pi/3) * cos(pi/3), sin(pi/3) * sin(pi/3)) = ( (sqrt{3}/2 * 1/2), (sqrt{3}/2 * sqrt{3}/2) ) = (sqrt{3}/4, 3/4). So the intersection point is (sqrt{3}/4, 3/4).So the lens-shaped intersection area is between these two curves from φ=0 to phi=pi/2. Therefore, integrating in polar coordinates should give the correct area. But according to our calculation, it&#39;s giving a larger value than the Cartesian formula. So why?Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the Cartesian formula computes the area of intersection of the two entire circles, but in polar coordinates, we are only considering the parts of the circles in the first quadrant, which for both circles are semicircles. Therefore, the area computed via the polar integral is indeed the area of intersection within the first quadrant, which is the same as the entire intersection area of the two semicircles. But according to the Cartesian formula, the entire circles (which extend beyond the first quadrant) have an intersection area of approximately0.2215, but the polar integral within the first quadrant should match.But according to the polar integral, it&#39;s approx1.1278, which is larger. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the polar integral setup.Wait, let&#39;s compute the polar integral again.First integral I1 from 0 to π/3:Integrand: 1 + 2 cos 2φIntegral: φ + sin 2φ from 0 to π/3At π/3: π/3 + sin(2π/3) = π/3 + √3/2At 0:0 +0 =0I1 = π/3 + √3/2Second integral I2 from π/3 to π/2:Integrand: -1 - 2 cos 2φIntegral: -φ - sin 2φ from π/3 to π/2At π/2: -π/2 - sin(π) = -π/2 -0 = -π/2At π/3: -π/3 - sin(2π/3) = -π/3 -√3/2Therefore, I2 = (-π/2) - (-π/3 -√3/2) = -π/2 + π/3 +√3/2= (-3π/6 + 2π/6) +√3/2= -π/6 +√3/2Total area A = (1/2)(I1 + I2) = (1/2)( π/3 + √3/2 - π/6 + √3/2 )= (1/2)( π/6 + √3 )= π/12 + √3/2But according to the Cartesian formula, the area is 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈0.6545 -0.433≈0.2215.Wait, so π/12 is approximately0.2618 and √3/2≈0.866, so their sum is approximately1.1278, which is much larger than the Cartesian result.This suggests that there is a fundamental error in the interpretation of the problem. The problem states &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. If &quot;lines&quot; refers to the two curves r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, then the bounded area is their intersection. However, the polar integral computes the area between the curves, which is not the same as their intersection.Wait, no. The area between the curves is actually the intersection area. If one curve is outside the other in certain regions, the area between them is the intersection. But in this case, since both curves are circles, their intersection is a lens shape, which is exactly what we&#39;re calculating with the polar integral.But why is there a discrepancy with the Cartesian formula? Because in Cartesian coordinates, the intersection area is computed for the entire circles, but in the polar integral, we are only considering the parts of the circles in the first quadrant. Therefore, the polar integral should give the area of the intersection within the first quadrant, which is half of the total intersection area.Wait, but the two circles intersect in two points: one in the first quadrant and one in another quadrant. However, given the centers and radii, they only intersect once in the first quadrant. Wait, no. Let&#39;s verify.The two circles:1. Center (√3/2, 0), radius √3/22. Center (0, 1/2), radius 1/2The distance between centers is 1. Since the circles are both in the first quadrant and their centers are in the first quadrant, they intersect only once in the first quadrant. Therefore, the intersection area is a lens shape entirely within the first quadrant. Therefore, the Cartesian formula&#39;s result of≈0.2215 should be correct, and the polar integral setup must be incorrect.But why? Let&#39;s re-express the problem.The problem is to find the area bounded by both curves in the first quadrant. The two curves intersect at phi=pi/3. So, the area bounded by both curves is the area that is inside both curves. That is, for each angle phi from 0 to pi/2, the radial line at angle phi intersects both curves, and the area between those two intersection points.But wait, but for phi from 0 to pi/3, the curve r = sqrt{3} cos phi is outside r = sin phi, and from phi=pi/3 to pi/2, r = sin phi is outside. Therefore, the area bounded by both curves is the region that is inside both curves, which would be from r=0 to the inner curve in each interval.Wait, that is, from 0 to pi/3, the inner curve is r = sin phi, and from pi/3 to pi/2, the inner curve is r = sqrt{3} cos phi. Therefore, the area bounded by both curves is the union of the areas under the inner curves. But that would be:A = (1/2) ∫₀^{pi/3} (sin phi)^2 dphi + (1/2) ∫_{pi/3}^{pi/2} (sqrt{3} cos phi)^2 dphiWhich is the area under the inner curves. But this is different from the previous approach.Computing this:First integral: (1/2) ∫₀^{pi/3} sin^2 phi dphi = (1/2)[ (phi/2 - (sin 2phi)/4 ) ] from 0 to pi/3= (1/2)[ (pi/6 - (sin 2pi/3)/4 ) - 0 ]= (1/2)(pi/6 - (√3/2)/4 )= pi/12 - √3/16Second integral: (1/2) ∫_{pi/3}^{pi/2} 3 cos^2 phi dphi = (3/2)[ (phi/2 + (sin 2phi)/4 ) ] from pi/3 to pi/2= (3/2)[ (pi/4 + 0 ) - (pi/6 + (sin 2pi/3)/4 ) ]= (3/2)(pi/4 - pi/6 - √3/8 )= (3/2)(pi/12 - √3/8 )= (3/2)( (2pi - 3√3)/24 )= (3/2)*(2pi -3√3)/24 = (2pi -3√3)/16Total area A = (pi/12 - √3/16 ) + (2pi -3√3)/16Convert to common denominator:pi/12 = 4pi/48 = pi/12-√3/16 = -3√3/48(2pi -3√3)/16 = (6pi -9√3)/48Total A = (4pi/48 -3√3/48 ) + (6pi -9√3)/48 = (10pi -12√3)/48 = (5pi -6√3)/24 ≈ (5*3.1416 -6*1.732)/24 ≈ (15.708 -10.392)/24 ≈5.316/24≈0.2215Which matches the Cartesian result. Therefore, this is the correct area of the intersection.Therefore, the initial approach was incorrect. The correct area is the integral of the inner curves, not the difference between outer and inner. The mistake was in assuming that the area between the curves is the difference between outer and inner, but in reality, the area bounded by both curves is the region inside both, which requires integrating the minimum of the two functions over the interval. Since from 0 to pi/3, the inner curve is sin phi, and from pi/3 to pi/2, the inner curve is sqrt{3} cos phi, the area is the sum of the areas under these inner curves.Therefore, the correct answer is (5π -6√3)/24, which is approximately0.2215, matching the Cartesian formula.But wait, how does this reconcile with the problem statement? The problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. If &quot;bounded by&quot; means the region enclosed by both curves, then this inner area is correct. However, if it means the area between the two curves, then the previous result would be correct. This ambiguity in the problem statement leads to confusion.But given that the Cartesian intersection area matches the inner integral, and the problem likely refers to the intersection area, the correct answer should be (5π -6√3)/24.However, the initial approach assuming the area between the curves gave a different result. This indicates that the problem&#39;s wording is critical. If it&#39;s the area bounded by both curves (i.e., the intersection), then the answer is (5π -6√3)/24. If it&#39;s the area between the curves (the region lying between the two curves), then it&#39;s π/12 + √3/2.But given the problem statement and standard terminology, &quot;bounded by lines&quot; usually refers to the region enclosed by all the given lines, which in this case are the two curves and the angle rays. However, since the angle rays from 0 to pi/2 are already boundaries of the polar coordinates, the area bounded by the two curves and the angle rays would be the region that is inside both curves. Hence, the correct answer is the intersection area, which is (5π -6√3)/24.But this contradicts the initial polar integral. Therefore, the mistake was in the initial assumption that the bounded area is the region between the curves. Instead, it&#39;s the intersection area.Therefore, the correct answer is (5π -6√3)/24, which simplifies to 5π/24 - √3/4.Final AnswerThe area is boxed{dfrac{5pi}{24} - dfrac{sqrt{3}}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the area bounded by the curves ( r = sqrt{3} cos phi ) and ( r = sin phi ) within the interval ( 0 leq phi leq frac{pi}{2} ):1. Find the intersection point:   - Set ( sqrt{3} cos phi = sin phi )   - Solve for ( phi ): ( tan phi = sqrt{3} ) ⟹ ( phi = frac{pi}{3} )2. Set up the integrals for the area:   - From ( 0 ) to ( frac{pi}{3} ), the inner curve is ( r = sin phi )   - From ( frac{pi}{3} ) to ( frac{pi}{2} ), the inner curve is ( r = sqrt{3} cos phi )3.

Combine the results:   - Calculate each integral and sum them:     [     text{Total Area} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{pi}{6} - frac{sqrt{3}}{8} right) + frac{1}{2} left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{pi}{6} - frac{sqrt{3}}{8} right)     ]   - Simplify the expression:     [     text{Total Area} = frac{5pi}{24} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4}     ]The final answer is (boxed{dfrac{5pi}{24} - dfrac{sqrt{3}}{4}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the area bounded by these two polar curves: r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, where φ is between 0 and π/2. Hmm, let me recall how to approach this. I think when you have two polar curves and you want the area between them, you need to find where they intersect first. Then, set up the integrals for each curve between the angles where one is outside the other and subtract appropriately. Let me try to work through this step by step.First, let me sketch or visualize the curves. The first one, r = √3 cos φ, is a polar equation of the form r = a cos φ, which I remember is a circle with diameter &#39;a&#39; along the x-axis. Similarly, r = sin φ is a circle with diameter 1 along the y-axis. Both of these are circles, but positioned differently. Since the angle φ is restricted between 0 and π/2, we&#39;re only looking at the first quadrant part of these circles.To find the points of intersection, I should set the two equations equal to each other:√3 cos φ = sin φLet me solve for φ. Let&#39;s divide both sides by cos φ (assuming cos φ ≠ 0, but since φ is between 0 and π/2, cos φ is positive, so that&#39;s okay):√3 = tan φSo tan φ = √3. The angle where tangent is √3 in the first quadrant is π/3, because tan(π/3) = √3. So the two circles intersect at φ = π/3. That&#39;s the key angle where they cross each other.Now, to compute the area between these two curves from φ = 0 to φ = π/2. But depending on the angle, which curve is on the outside? So between 0 and π/3, one of the circles is outside the other, and between π/3 and π/2, the other is outside. I need to figure out which one is which.Let me test at φ = 0. For r = √3 cos φ, when φ = 0, r = √3 * 1 = √3. For r = sin φ, when φ = 0, r = 0. So at φ = 0, the first curve is at √3, the second at 0. So between φ = 0 and φ = π/3, which curve is larger?Let me pick φ = π/6 (30 degrees), which is between 0 and π/3. For r = √3 cos(π/6): cos(π/6) is √3/2, so r = √3*(√3/2) = 3/2. For r = sin(π/6) = 1/2. So at π/6, r = 3/2 vs. 1/2. So here, the first curve is outside the second. Therefore, from φ = 0 to φ = π/3, r = √3 cos φ is the outer curve, and from φ = π/3 to φ = π/2, we need to check which is outer.At φ = π/3, both curves meet. Let&#39;s check at φ = π/2. For r = √3 cos(π/2) = 0. For r = sin(π/2) = 1. So at φ approaching π/2, the second curve (r = sin φ) goes to 1, while the first curve goes to 0. Therefore, between φ = π/3 and φ = π/2, the outer curve is r = sin φ. Therefore, the area between the two curves from 0 to π/2 is the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1/2)(√3 cos φ)^2 dφ plus the integral from π/3 to π/2 of (1/2)(sin φ)^2 dφ, minus... Wait, no. Wait, actually, since between 0 and π/3, the outer curve is √3 cos φ, and between π/3 and π/2, the outer curve is sin φ. But wait, hold on. Wait, actually, the area bounded by both curves would be the area inside both curves. But actually, since both curves start at the origin (r=0) but in different directions. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.Wait, let&#39;s think again. The area bounded by both curves in the first quadrant. So, the region where both curves overlap? Or the area that is enclosed by both curves? Wait, maybe it&#39;s the area that is inside both curves. Wait, but since they cross each other, the bounded area is the region that is inside both curves between 0 and π/2. Hmm. Wait, no. If you have two curves, the area bounded by them would be the area that is inside both curves where they overlap. But perhaps in this case, since they intersect at π/3, the area bounded by both curves would consist of two parts: from 0 to π/3, the area under r = √3 cos φ, and from π/3 to π/2, the area under r = sin φ. But actually, no. Wait, the standard way is to find the area that is inside both curves. Since from 0 to π/3, the outer curve is r = √3 cos φ and inner is r = sin φ. From π/3 to π/2, the outer curve is r = sin φ and inner is r = √3 cos φ. Wait, but actually, when φ increases beyond π/3, which one is bigger?Wait, let&#39;s check at φ = π/3 + something. Let&#39;s take φ = π/2, as before, sin φ is 1, which is bigger than √3 cos φ (which is 0). Let&#39;s take φ = π/3 + π/6 = π/2. But that&#39;s too much. Let&#39;s take φ = π/3 + π/12 = 5π/12. Let&#39;s compute both r values.r1 = √3 cos(5π/12). Let me compute cos(5π/12). 5π/12 is 75 degrees. Cos(75°) is cos(45° + 30°) = cos45 cos30 - sin45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 - √2/4 = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ (2.449 - 1.414)/4 ≈ 1.035/4 ≈ 0.258. So r1 = √3 * 0.258 ≈ 1.732 * 0.258 ≈ 0.447.r2 = sin(5π/12) = sin(75°). Sin75° = sin(45° + 30°) = sin45 cos30 + cos45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ (2.449 + 1.414)/4 ≈ 3.863/4 ≈ 0.966. So r2 ≈ 0.966, which is bigger than r1 ≈ 0.447. So from π/3 to π/2, the outer curve is r = sin φ.Therefore, the area bounded by the two curves is the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1/2)( (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ) dφ plus the integral from π/3 to π/2 of (1/2)( (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ) dφ. Wait, no. Wait, actually, when you have two curves, the area between them is the integral from the lower angle to the upper angle of (1/2)(outer^2 - inner^2) dφ. So in this case, from 0 to π/3, outer is √3 cos φ, inner is sin φ. Then from π/3 to π/2, outer is sin φ, inner is √3 cos φ. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of those two integrals.Alternatively, since they cross at π/3, you can compute the area from 0 to π/3 under the first curve, subtract the area under the second curve, then from π/3 to π/2, compute the area under the second curve and subtract the area under the first curve. Then add those two results. So yes, that&#39;s equivalent.So let me set up the integrals:Area = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} [ (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ] dφ + (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} [ (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ] dφNow, let&#39;s compute each integral step by step.First, simplify the integrands.For the first integral:(√3 cos φ)^2 = 3 cos² φ(sin φ)^2 = sin² φSo the integrand becomes 3 cos² φ - sin² φSimilarly, the second integral:(sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 = sin² φ - 3 cos² φSo, we can compute both integrals. Let&#39;s compute the first integral from 0 to π/3:Integral of 3 cos² φ - sin² φ dφSimilarly, the second integral from π/3 to π/2:Integral of sin² φ - 3 cos² φ dφTo compute these integrals, I need to recall the integrals of cos² φ and sin² φ. The integral of cos² φ dφ is (1/2)(φ + (1/2) sin 2φ) + C, and integral of sin² φ dφ is (1/2)(φ - (1/2) sin 2φ) + C.Alternatively, we can use power-reduction identities:cos² φ = (1 + cos 2φ)/2sin² φ = (1 - cos 2φ)/2So let&#39;s rewrite the integrands:First integral:3 cos² φ - sin² φ = 3*(1 + cos 2φ)/2 - (1 - cos 2φ)/2 = [3(1 + cos 2φ) - (1 - cos 2φ)] / 2= [3 + 3 cos 2φ -1 + cos 2φ] / 2= [2 + 4 cos 2φ]/2= 1 + 2 cos 2φSecond integral:sin² φ - 3 cos² φ = (1 - cos 2φ)/2 - 3*(1 + cos 2φ)/2 = [ (1 - cos 2φ) - 3(1 + cos 2φ) ] / 2= [1 - cos 2φ -3 -3 cos 2φ] / 2= [ -2 -4 cos 2φ ] / 2= -1 -2 cos 2φSo now, the integrals become easier.First integral (from 0 to π/3):∫ (1 + 2 cos 2φ) dφ = ∫1 dφ + 2 ∫cos 2φ dφThe integral of 1 dφ is φThe integral of cos 2φ dφ is (1/2) sin 2φTherefore, first integral evaluated from 0 to π/3:[ φ + 2*(1/2) sin 2φ ] from 0 to π/3 = [ φ + sin 2φ ] from 0 to π/3At π/3: π/3 + sin(2*(π/3)) = π/3 + sin(2π/3) = π/3 + (√3)/2At 0: 0 + sin(0) = 0So the first integral is (π/3 + (√3)/2) - 0 = π/3 + (√3)/2Then, the second integral (from π/3 to π/2):∫ (-1 -2 cos 2φ) dφ = -∫1 dφ -2 ∫cos 2φ dφ= -φ -2*(1/2) sin 2φ + C = -φ - sin 2φ + CEvaluated from π/3 to π/2:At π/2: -π/2 - sin(2*(π/2)) = -π/2 - sin(π) = -π/2 - 0 = -π/2At π/3: -π/3 - sin(2*(π/3)) = -π/3 - sin(2π/3) = -π/3 - (√3)/2So subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:[ -π/2 ] - [ -π/3 - (√3)/2 ] = -π/2 + π/3 + (√3)/2 = (-3π/6 + 2π/6) + (√3)/2 = (-π/6) + (√3)/2Therefore, the second integral is -π/6 + (√3)/2Now, putting it all together:Total Area = (1/2)*(first integral) + (1/2)*(second integral)= (1/2)*(π/3 + √3/2) + (1/2)*(-π/6 + √3/2)Simplify each term:First term: (1/2)*(π/3) + (1/2)*(√3/2) = π/6 + √3/4Second term: (1/2)*(-π/6) + (1/2)*(√3/2) = -π/12 + √3/4Adding them together:π/6 - π/12 + √3/4 + √3/4Combine the π terms:π/6 - π/12 = (2π - π)/12 = π/12Combine the √3 terms:√3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2Therefore, Total Area = π/12 + √3/2So, the area bounded by the two curves from φ = 0 to φ = π/2 is π/12 plus √3 over 2.Wait, let me check the signs again. Because when we did the second integral, it was ∫ (-1 -2 cos 2φ) dφ, which evaluated to -π/6 + √3/2. Then multiplying by 1/2, so the second term was (1/2)*(-π/6 + √3/2) = -π/12 + √3/4. Then adding to the first term (π/6 + √3/4). So π/6 - π/12 = π/12 and √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2. Yes, that seems correct.So the final answer is π/12 + √3/2. Let me verify the calculations once more to make sure.First integral:From 0 to π/3: 1 + 2 cos 2φIntegral: φ + sin 2φ evaluated at π/3 and 0.At π/3: π/3 + sin(2π/3) = π/3 + √3/2At 0: 0 + 0 = 0So first integral: π/3 + √3/2. Multiply by 1/2: (π/3 + √3/2)/2 = π/6 + √3/4Second integral:From π/3 to π/2: -1 -2 cos 2φIntegral: -φ - sin 2φ evaluated at π/2 and π/3.At π/2: -π/2 - sin π = -π/2 - 0 = -π/2At π/3: -π/3 - sin(2π/3) = -π/3 - √3/2Difference: (-π/2) - (-π/3 - √3/2) = -π/2 + π/3 + √3/2 = (-3π/6 + 2π/6) + √3/2 = (-π/6) + √3/2Multiply by 1/2: (-π/6 + √3/2)/2 = -π/12 + √3/4Adding the two parts:π/6 + √3/4 - π/12 + √3/4 = (π/6 - π/12) + (√3/4 + √3/4) = π/12 + √3/2Yes, that checks out. Therefore, the area is π/12 + √3/2.But wait, let me check dimensions. The area in polar coordinates... but these are circles. Let me recall the areas of the circles.The circle r = √3 cos φ is a circle with diameter √3 along the x-axis. Its radius is √3/2, so the area would be π*(√3/2)^2 = π*(3/4) = 3π/4. But since we are only integrating from 0 to π/2, which is the right half of this circle? Wait, no. Wait, the entire circle r = a cos φ is a circle with diameter &#39;a&#39; along the x-axis from 0 to a. But when φ is from 0 to π/2, we get the part of the circle in the first quadrant. Similarly, r = sin φ is a circle with diameter 1 along the y-axis from 0 to π. But we are considering φ from 0 to π/2, so that&#39;s the upper half in the first quadrant.But maybe the area of each circle in the first quadrant can be computed as well.For r = √3 cos φ, in the first quadrant (φ from 0 to π/2), the area would be (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} (√3 cos φ)^2 dφ. But since the circle is only defined for φ where r is non-negative, which for r = √3 cos φ is from -π/2 to π/2. But since we are looking at 0 to π/2, that&#39;s the right half. But the area of the entire circle is π*(√3/2)^2 = 3π/4. The area in the first quadrant would be half of that, which is 3π/8. Wait, but actually, integrating from 0 to π/2:(1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} (3 cos² φ) dφ = (3/2) * (1/2)(π/2 + 0) = (3/4)(π/2) = 3π/8. Yes, that matches.Similarly, for r = sin φ, in the first quadrant (φ from 0 to π/2), the area is (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} sin² φ dφ = (1/2)*(1/2)(π/2 - 0) = π/8. Wait, the entire circle for r = sin φ has diameter 1, radius 1/2, area π*(1/2)^2 = π/4. So the first quadrant area is half of that, which is π/8. Correct.So the total area of the first circle in the first quadrant is 3π/8, and the second is π/8. The area between them should be the difference minus the overlapping parts? Wait, no. The area bounded by both curves is the region where they overlap? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. So maybe each figure is bounded by both lines. But given that they intersect at π/3, the bounded area is the lens-shaped region where they overlap. Wait, but in the first quadrant, from 0 to π/2. So the area bounded by both curves is the region that is inside both curves. Wait, but since one is a circle extending to the right and the other upwards, their intersection is like a lens shape.Wait, but when you have two circles intersecting, the area of their intersection can be calculated using the formula for lens area, which involves the radii and the distance between centers. But since we are in polar coordinates, maybe integrating is the way to go, which we did.But according to our calculation, the area is π/12 + √3/2. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s plausible. Let&#39;s compute the numerical values:π ≈ 3.1416, so π/12 ≈ 0.2618√3 ≈ 1.732, so √3/2 ≈ 0.866Adding them: ≈ 0.2618 + 0.866 ≈ 1.1278Alternatively, compute the areas of each circle in the first quadrant: 3π/8 ≈ 1.178 and π/8 ≈ 0.3927. The area between them would be the difference, but that&#39;s not exactly. Wait, but the lens-shaped area is the intersection. Wait, the intersection area is less than both. Wait, but according to our calculation, it&#39;s about 1.1278, which is between the two areas. Wait, maybe not. Wait, no. The area between the two curves would actually be the union minus the intersection. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.Wait, in our problem statement, it says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. So perhaps it refers to each figure bounded by both lines. That is, the region that is inside both curves. But in polar coordinates, when two curves cross, the region bounded by both would be the overlapping lens shape. However, in this case, since both curves start at the origin (r=0) but in different directions. Wait, let&#39;s think again.Wait, the circle r = √3 cos φ passes through the origin when cos φ = 0, which is at φ = π/2, but in our domain φ is from 0 to π/2. At φ = π/2, r = 0. Similarly, the circle r = sin φ also passes through the origin at φ = 0. So both circles pass through the origin but in different angles. Their other intersection point is at φ = π/3, r = √3 cos π/3 = √3*(1/2) = √3/2, and sin π/3 = √3/2. So they intersect at (r, φ) = (√3/2, π/3). So the region bounded by both curves is the area that is inside both curves from φ = 0 to φ = π/2. But since they intersect at π/3, the bounded area is between φ = 0 to π/3, bounded by r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, and from π/3 to π/2, bounded by r = sin φ and r = √3 cos φ. Wait, but how is that a closed figure? Hmm.Wait, maybe it&#39;s actually two separate regions? Wait, no. When you have two curves that intersect, the area bounded by them would be the area that is enclosed by both. However, since both curves start at the origin and go out to their respective maxima, the bounded area is likely the lens-shaped region between their intersection points.But in this case, both curves intersect at the origin (φ = π/2 for r = √3 cos φ and φ = 0 for r = sin φ) and at φ = π/3. Wait, but at φ = 0, r = sin φ is 0, but r = √3 cos 0 = √3. Similarly, at φ = π/2, r = sin φ is 1, and r = √3 cos φ is 0. So the two curves cross at the origin and at (r, φ) = (√3/2, π/3). So the bounded area is between φ = 0 to π/3, where the two curves form a closed loop? Wait, not exactly. Wait, perhaps the area bounded by both curves is the region that is inside both curves from φ = 0 to φ = π/2. But that seems like only the overlapping region.Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the area bounded by both curves in the first quadrant. So, the region that is inside both curves. But in the first quadrant, the two curves intersect at φ = π/3. So the overlapping region would be from φ = 0 to φ = π/3, bounded by r = sin φ below and r = √3 cos φ above, and from φ = π/3 to φ = π/2, bounded by r = √3 cos φ below and r = sin φ above? Wait, but no. Because for angles beyond π/3, r = √3 cos φ decreases while r = sin φ increases. Wait, but at φ = π/3, both are equal. So after that, as φ increases, r = sin φ becomes larger than r = √3 cos φ. So the overlapping region would be where r is less than both curves? Or greater?Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to think in Cartesian coordinates. Let me convert both equations to Cartesian to see their shapes.Starting with r = √3 cos φ. Multiply both sides by r: r^2 = √3 r cos φ =&gt; x² + y² = √3 x =&gt; x² - √3 x + y² = 0. Completing the square: (x - √3/2)² + y² = ( √3/2 )² = 3/4. So this is a circle with center at (√3/2, 0) and radius √3/2.Similarly, r = sin φ. Multiply both sides by r: r² = r sin φ =&gt; x² + y² = y =&gt; x² + y² - y = 0. Completing the square: x² + (y - 1/2)² = (1/2)². So circle with center at (0, 1/2) and radius 1/2.So in Cartesian coordinates, we have two circles:1. Circle 1: Center (√3/2, 0), radius √3/2.2. Circle 2: Center (0, 1/2), radius 1/2.We need to find the area of overlap between these two circles in the first quadrant.Alternatively, since the problem is given in polar coordinates with φ from 0 to π/2, we can use polar coordinates to compute the area. But maybe converting to Cartesian and using the lens formula would be another approach. Let me check if both methods give the same answer.The formula for the area of intersection between two circles is:Area = r₁² cos⁻¹(d² + r₁² - r₂² / 2dr₁) + r₂² cos⁻¹(d² + r₂² - r₁² / 2dr₂) - 1/2 √((-d + r₁ + r₂)(d + r₁ - r₂)(d - r₁ + r₂)(d + r₁ + r₂))Where d is the distance between centers.But let&#39;s compute d, the distance between centers. Center 1: (√3/2, 0), Center 2: (0, 1/2). The distance between them is sqrt( (√3/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt( 3/4 + 1/4 ) = sqrt(1) = 1.So d = 1. The radii are r₁ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866 and r₂ = 1/2 = 0.5.So plugging into the formula:θ₁ = cos⁻¹( (d² + r₁² - r₂²) / (2 d r₁) )= cos⁻¹( (1 + (3/4) - (1/4)) / (2 * 1 * √3/2) )= cos⁻¹( (1 + 3/4 - 1/4) / (√3) )= cos⁻¹( (1 + 2/4) / √3 )= cos⁻¹( (1 + 1/2) / √3 )= cos⁻¹( 3/2 / √3 ) = cos⁻¹( (3)/(2√3) ) = cos⁻¹( √3 / 2 ) = π/6Similarly, θ₂ = cos⁻¹( (d² + r₂² - r₁²) / (2 d r₂) )= cos⁻¹( (1 + 1/4 - 3/4) / (2 * 1 * 1/2) )= cos⁻¹( (1 - 2/4) / 1 )= cos⁻¹( (1 - 1/2) ) = cos⁻¹(1/2) = π/3Therefore, the area of intersection is:r₁² θ₁ + r₂² θ₂ - 1/2 √( etc. )But let&#39;s compute step by step:First term: ( (√3/2)^2 ) * π/6 = (3/4) * π/6 = π/8Second term: ( (1/2)^2 ) * π/3 = (1/4) * π/3 = π/12Third term: 1/2 * sqrt( [ -d + r₁ + r₂ ][ d + r₁ - r₂ ][ d - r₁ + r₂ ][ d + r₁ + r₂ ] )Compute each bracket:First bracket: -d + r₁ + r₂ = -1 + √3/2 + 1/2 = ( -1 + 1/2 ) + √3/2 = -1/2 + √3/2Second bracket: d + r₁ - r₂ = 1 + √3/2 - 1/2 = 1 - 1/2 + √3/2 = 1/2 + √3/2Third bracket: d - r₁ + r₂ = 1 - √3/2 + 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 - √3/2 = 3/2 - √3/2Fourth bracket: d + r₁ + r₂ = 1 + √3/2 + 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 + √3/2 = 3/2 + √3/2Multiply all four brackets:(-1/2 + √3/2)(1/2 + √3/2)(3/2 - √3/2)(3/2 + √3/2)Let me compute first two brackets and last two brackets separately.First two brackets:(-1/2 + √3/2)(1/2 + √3/2) = [(-1/2)(1/2) + (-1/2)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(1/2) + (√3/2)(√3/2)]= [ -1/4 - √3/4 + √3/4 + 3/4 ]= [ (-1/4 + 3/4) + (-√3/4 + √3/4) ]= [ 2/4 + 0 ] = 1/2Last two brackets:(3/2 - √3/2)(3/2 + √3/2) = (3/2)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = 9/4 - 3/4 = 6/4 = 3/2Therefore, the product of all four brackets is (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4Then, sqrt(3/4) = √3/2So the third term is 1/2 * √3/2 = √3/4Putting it all together:Area of intersection = π/8 + π/12 - √3/4Convert to common denominator:π/8 = 3π/24, π/12 = 2π/24. So total π terms: 3π/24 + 2π/24 = 5π/24Thus, Area = 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈ 5*3.1416/24 - 1.732/4 ≈ 0.6545 - 0.433 ≈ 0.2215But wait, this contradicts our previous result of π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 0.2618 + 0.866 ≈ 1.1278. There&#39;s a big discrepancy here. Therefore, one of the approaches must be wrong.Wait, but why is there such a difference? Because when we computed using polar coordinates, we found a larger area, but using the lens formula, the area of intersection is much smaller. That suggests that the problem might be interpreted differently.Wait, the problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. The original curves are r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ in the interval 0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2. So the area bounded by these lines would probably refer to the region that is inside both curves. But according to the lens formula, that area is 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈ 0.2215, whereas the polar integral approach gave us π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 1.1278, which is much larger.This discrepancy suggests that perhaps my initial interpretation was wrong. Let me think again.Wait, in polar coordinates, the curves r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ. From φ = 0 to π/3, the first curve is outside the second, and from φ = π/3 to π/2, the second is outside the first. Therefore, the area bounded between them would be the area from 0 to π/3 between the two curves plus the area from π/3 to π/2 between the two curves. But that would actually be the entire area between the two curves in the first quadrant, not just the overlapping region.Wait, actually, if you have two curves crossing each other, the area between them is the area that is between the two curves across the entire interval, which would consist of two parts: one where the first curve is above and the second is below, and vice versa. So that area is indeed computed as the sum of the two integrals, as I did earlier, giving π/12 + √3/2. However, the lens formula gives the area of overlap, which is different.Therefore, the confusion arises from what exactly the problem is asking. The problem states &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. The term &quot;bounded by lines&quot; might imply the region enclosed by both curves, which would be their overlapping area. However, depending on interpretation, it could also mean the area between the two curves, which is the region that is between them, not necessarily the overlapping part.But in this case, given the curves r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ in the first quadrant, from φ = 0 to π/2, the &quot;bounded&quot; figure would likely be the region that is inside both curves, which is the overlapping area. However, our two different methods gave conflicting results, so I need to reconcile this.Wait, let&#39;s check the numerical value of the two results.First method (polar integral): π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 0.2618 + 0.866 ≈ 1.1278Second method (lens formula): 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈ 0.6545 - 0.433 ≈ 0.2215But these are very different. That indicates a problem in my reasoning.Wait, let me verify the lens area formula. Maybe I applied it incorrectly.The formula is:Area = r₁² cos⁻¹(d² + r₁² - r₂² / 2dr₁) + r₂² cos⁻¹(d² + r₂² - r₁² / 2dr₂) - 1/2 √[ (-d + r₁ + r₂)(d + r₁ - r₂)(d - r₁ + r₂)(d + r₁ + r₂) ]Given:r₁ = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866, r₂ = 1/2 = 0.5, d = 1Compute θ₁:θ₁ = cos⁻¹[ (d² + r₁² - r₂²) / (2 d r₁) ]Plugging in:= cos⁻¹[ (1 + (3/4) - (1/4)) / (2 * 1 * (√3/2)) ]= cos⁻¹[ (1 + 0.75 - 0.25) / (√3) ]= cos⁻¹[ 1.5 / √3 ]= cos⁻¹[ (3/2) / √3 ] = cos⁻¹[ (√3)/2 ] = π/6Similarly, θ₂:θ₂ = cos⁻¹[ (d² + r₂² - r₁²) / (2 d r₂) ]= cos⁻¹[ (1 + 0.25 - 0.75) / (2 * 1 * 0.5) ]= cos⁻¹[ (0.5) / 1 ] = cos⁻¹(0.5) = π/3So:Area = r₁² θ₁ + r₂² θ₂ - 0.5 * sqrt[ (-d + r₁ + r₂)(d + r₁ - r₂)(d - r₁ + r₂)(d + r₁ + r₂) ]= ( (3/4) * π/6 ) + ( (1/4) * π/3 ) - 0.5 * sqrt[ product ]Compute each term:First term: (3/4)(π/6) = (3π)/24 = π/8 ≈ 0.3927Second term: (1/4)(π/3) = π/12 ≈ 0.2618Third term: product was calculated as 3/4, sqrt(3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, so 0.5 * √3/2 = √3/4 ≈ 0.433So total Area = π/8 + π/12 - √3/4 ≈ 0.3927 + 0.2618 - 0.433 ≈ 0.6545 - 0.433 ≈ 0.2215This seems correct. So the overlapping area is approximately 0.2215.But why does the polar integral method give approximately 1.1278? That&#39;s the key question. Where is the mistake here?Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. If the problem is asking for the area bounded by both curves, then the correct answer is the overlapping area, which is 5π/24 - √3/4. But when I calculated the polar integrals, I computed the area between the two curves from 0 to π/2, which is different.Wait, let&#39;s clarify:In polar coordinates, when you have two curves that cross each other, the area between them is the area that is inside one curve and outside the other. But depending on which is the outer curve, you have to split the integral at the intersection angle.In this problem, if you consider the area bounded by both curves, it&#39;s the overlapping lens-shaped area. However, if you consider the area between the two curves from φ = 0 to φ = π/2, it&#39;s the union of the two regions: from 0 to π/3, the area between r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, and from π/3 to π/2, the area between r = sin φ and r = √3 cos φ. But the total area between them is the sum of these two regions, which is π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 1.1278.But the overlapping area (lens shape) is much smaller. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. If the lines are r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, then the bounded figure would be the region where both conditions are satisfied, i.e., the overlapping area. However, the integral I computed earlier is the area between the two curves, which is different.Wait, but in the problem statement, it&#39;s ambiguous. &quot;Figures bounded by lines&quot; could mean the region enclosed by both lines, which would be the overlapping area, or it could mean the area enclosed by each line separately. But since there are two lines, it&#39;s more likely the region bounded by both, i.e., the overlapping area.Therefore, there is a conflict between the two methods. Which one is correct?Wait, let&#39;s check both results with the total areas of the circles.The overlapping area via lens formula is ~0.2215. The area between the two curves via polar integral is ~1.1278. The areas of the individual circles in the first quadrant are ~1.178 (3π/8) and ~0.3927 (π/8). The sum of the individual areas is ~1.5708, which is π/2. The overlapping area is ~0.2215, so the union would be 1.5708 - 0.2215 ≈ 1.3493. The area between the two curves (what I computed as ~1.1278) is different from both.But according to the problem statement, it says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. If &quot;figures&quot; is plural, maybe it refers to multiple figures. However, in this case, there are two curves, so maybe each curve forms a figure, and we need to compute both areas. But the problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines&quot;, plural, which could imply each figure&#39;s area, but given the two lines, it&#39;s more likely the area bounded by both lines.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the area bounded by both lines, which is the lens-shaped region. However, according to our calculation, the polar integral method gave a different answer. Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the methods.Wait, let&#39;s compute the overlapping area using polar coordinates. The overlapping region is where both r ≤ √3 cos φ and r ≤ sin φ. But that&#39;s not correct. Wait, overlapping region is where points are inside both curves. For a point to be inside both curves, it must satisfy both r ≤ √3 cos φ and r ≤ sin φ. But since these are equations of the curves, the overlapping region would be points that are on both curves. But actually, no. The overlapping area is the set of points that are inside both curves. However, the curves themselves are the boundaries. So if we consider the regions bounded by each curve, the overlapping area is the intersection of the regions inside both curves.For r = √3 cos φ, the region it bounds is all points (r, φ) such that r ≤ √3 cos φ. Similarly, for r = sin φ, the region is r ≤ sin φ. Therefore, the overlapping area is the set of points where r ≤ √3 cos φ and r ≤ sin φ. Since in the first quadrant, these are two inequalities. The overlapping region is where both conditions are true, which is where r ≤ min(√3 cos φ, sin φ). Therefore, to find the overlapping area, we need to integrate r from 0 to min(√3 cos φ, sin φ) over φ from 0 to π/2. But this is not correct because both curves are circles, and their intersection is a lens shape which in polar coordinates is bounded by the two curves between their points of intersection.Wait, but in polar coordinates, the overlapping region can be represented as the union of two integrals: from φ = 0 to φ = π/3, the upper bound is the smaller of the two curves, which is sin φ, and from φ = π/3 to φ = π/2, the upper bound is the smaller curve, which is √3 cos φ. Wait, but wait, we need to find where both inequalities hold. Wait, for a point to be inside both curves, it must satisfy r ≤ √3 cos φ and r ≤ sin φ. Therefore, r must be ≤ the minimum of the two. Therefore, the overlapping area is ∫₀^{π/2} (1/2)(min(√3 cos φ, sin φ))² dφBut that integral would split at φ = π/3. From 0 to π/3, min is sin φ, and from π/3 to π/2, min is √3 cos φ.Therefore, overlapping area is:(1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} (sin φ)^2 dφ + (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} ( √3 cos φ )^2 dφWhich is:(1/2)[ ∫₀^{π/3} sin² φ dφ + 3 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos² φ dφ ]Compute these integrals:First integral: ∫ sin² φ dφ = (1/2)(φ - (1/2) sin 2φ) evaluated from 0 to π/3At π/3: (1/2)(π/3 - (1/2) sin(2π/3)) = (1/2)(π/3 - (1/2)(√3/2)) = (1/2)(π/3 - √3/4) = π/6 - √3/8At 0: (1/2)(0 - 0) = 0First integral: π/6 - √3/8Second integral: 3 ∫ cos² φ dφ = 3*(1/2)(φ + (1/2) sin 2φ) evaluated from π/3 to π/2At π/2: 3*(1/2)(π/2 + 0) = 3*(π/4) = 3π/4At π/3: 3*(1/2)(π/3 + (1/2) sin(2π/3)) = 3*(1/2)(π/3 + (1/2)(√3/2)) = 3*(π/6 + √3/8) = π/2 + 3√3/8So the second integral is 3π/4 - (π/2 + 3√3/8) = 3π/4 - 2π/4 - 3√3/8 = π/4 - 3√3/8Therefore, total overlapping area:(1/2)[ (π/6 - √3/8) + (π/4 - 3√3/8) ] = (1/2)[ π/6 + π/4 - √3/8 - 3√3/8 ] = (1/2)[ (2π/12 + 3π/12 ) - (4√3/8 ) ] = (1/2)[ 5π/12 - √3/2 ] = 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈ 0.6545 - 0.433 ≈ 0.2215Which matches the lens formula result. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect because I misunderstood the problem as the area between the two curves, but the correct answer is the overlapping area, which is 5π/24 - √3/4. But the user&#39;s question says: &quot;Calculate the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates.&quot; With the two curves provided. Therefore, the correct answer should be the overlapping area.But why did my first approach give a different result? Because I computed the area between the two curves, which is different from the overlapping area. The area between the two curves is the region that is inside one curve and outside the other, summed over both regions where each curve is the outer one. That area is:From 0 to π/3: area between √3 cos φ (outer) and sin φ (inner)From π/3 to π/2: area between sin φ (outer) and √3 cos φ (inner)This area is calculated as:(1/2) ∫₀^{π/3} [ (√3 cos φ)^2 - (sin φ)^2 ] dφ + (1/2) ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} [ (sin φ)^2 - (√3 cos φ)^2 ] dφ = π/12 + √3/2 ≈ 1.1278Whereas the overlapping area (the lens shape) is 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈ 0.2215.Given the problem statement, which asks for the &quot;areas of figures bounded by lines&quot;, and given that there are two lines, it&#39;s ambiguous. But if the figures (plural) refer to the regions bounded by each line individually, then the areas would be the areas of each circle in the first quadrant: 3π/8 and π/8. But the problem mentions &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;, plural, but with two lines given. If the problem wants the area between the two curves, that is, the region that is between them, which is what I computed first, then the answer is π/12 + √3/2. However, if it wants the overlapping area, it&#39;s 5π/24 - √3/4.But the problem statement says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;. If the figures are the regions bounded by each line individually, then the answer would be both areas. But if it&#39;s the area bounded by both lines together, it&#39;s either the overlapping area or the area between them. The problem statement is not very clear.Looking back at the original problem statement:&quot;Calculate the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates.r=√3 cos φ, r=sin φ, (0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2)&quot;So, the user specifies two lines (curves) in polar coordinates and wants the areas of figures bounded by these lines. Since there are two curves, but they intersect, the &quot;figures&quot; bounded by them would likely be the overlapping area. However, depending on interpretation, it could be the area between the curves.But in standard terminology, when asked for the area bounded by two curves, it usually refers to the area between them, which is the region enclosed by both curves. But in this case, since both curves start at the origin and end at the origin (in the given angle range), the area bounded by both curves would actually be the lens-shaped overlapping area.However, the integral I first computed (π/12 + √3/2) is the area between the two curves, which includes the regions from 0 to π/3 where one is outer and from π/3 to π/2 where the other is outer. This is different from the overlapping area.But the problem states &quot;figures bounded by lines&quot;, which in Russian (if this is a translation) might specifically mean the overlapping area. However, in English, it&#39;s ambiguous.To resolve this, perhaps we can see the units or check the results.If we take the overlapping area computed via the lens formula: 5π/24 - √3/4 ≈ 0.2215. The area between the two curves is ≈ 1.1278. Given that each individual area in the first quadrant is 3π/8 ≈ 1.178 and π/8 ≈ 0.3927, the area between them being 1.1278 makes sense as it&#39;s less than the sum of both. However, the overlapping area is even smaller.But given the problem&#39;s wording, and considering that it&#39;s common in polar coordinates to ask for the area between two curves when they intersect, I think the expected answer is the one computed via the integrals of the area between the curves, which is π/12 + √3/2. However, my first method was correct, but the second method using the lens formula computes the overlapping area, which is different. The key is to understand what the problem is asking.Given that the problem says &quot;the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates&quot;, and the lines are r = √3 cos φ and r = sin φ, in the first quadrant, I think the intended answer is the area between the two curves, which is the sum of the two integrals, resulting in π/12 + √3/2. This is because the standard approach in calculus when given two curves is to find the area between them by integrating the difference of their squares. The lens formula, on the other hand, gives the overlapping area, but that requires a different setup.However, given that both interpretations are possible, but the problem specifies polar coordinates and gives two curves, I think the integral approach is the correct method here. Therefore, the answer should be π/12 + √3/2.But to confirm, let&#39;s check with the user&#39;s perspective. If the user is following a textbook problem, similar problems usually ask for the area between two curves in polar coordinates, which involves finding the intersection angle and integrating the difference of the squares. Therefore, the answer is likely π/12 + √3/2.Hence, the final answer is boxed{dfrac{pi}{12} + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.Final AnswerThe area is boxed{dfrac{pi}{12} + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the area bounded by the polar curves ( r = sqrt{3} cos phi ) and ( r = sin phi ) from ( 0 leq phi leq frac{pi}{2} ), we first determine the points of intersection by solving the equations:[sqrt{3} cos phi = sin phi]This simplifies to:[sqrt{3} = tan phi implies phi = frac{pi}{3}]Next, we split the integral at the intersection angle ( phi = frac{pi}{3} ). For ( 0 leq phi leq frac{pi}{3} ), the outer curve is ( r = sqrt{3} cos phi ) and the inner curve is ( r = sin phi ). For ( frac{pi}{3} leq phi leq frac{pi}{2} ), the outer curve is ( r = sin phi ) and the inner curve is ( r = sqrt{3} cos phi ).The area is calculated as the sum of two integrals:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{frac{pi}{3}} left( (sqrt{3} cos phi)^2 - (sin phi)^2 right) dphi + frac{1}{2} int_{frac{pi}{3}}^{frac{pi}{2}} left( (sin phi)^2 - (sqrt{3} cos phi)^2 right) dphi]Simplifying the integrands using trigonometric identities:For the first integral (( 0 leq phi leq frac{pi}{3} )):[3 cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi = 1 + 2 cos 2phi]For the second integral (( frac{pi}{3} leq phi leq frac{pi}{2} )):[sin^2 phi - 3 cos^2 phi = -1 - 2 cos 2phi]Evaluating the integrals:First integral:[int_{0}^{frac{pi}{3}} (1 + 2 cos 2phi) dphi = left[ phi + sin 2phi right]_{0}^{frac{pi}{3}} = frac{pi}{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Second integral:[int_{frac{pi}{3}}^{frac{pi}{2}} (-1 - 2 cos 2phi) dphi = left[ -phi - sin 2phi right]_{frac{pi}{3}}^{frac{pi}{2}} = -frac{pi}{6} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Combining the results:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{pi}{3} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) + frac{1}{2} left( -frac{pi}{6} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)]Simplifying:[text{Area} = frac{pi}{6} + frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{pi}{12} + frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{pi}{12} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Thus, the area bounded by the given lines is:[boxed{dfrac{pi}{12} + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>## Solutionsqrt{3} cos phi=sin phi ; operatorname{tg} phi=sqrt{3} ; phi=frac{pi}{3}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_17ecf51401f349d22271g-05.jpg?height=620&amp;width=803&amp;top_left_y=889&amp;top_left_x=181)mathrm{S}=frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{frac{pi}{3}} sin ^{2} phi mathrm{d} phi+frac{3}{2} int_{frac{pi}{3}}^{frac{pi}{2}} cos ^{2} phi mathrm{d} phi=frac{1}{4} int_{0}^{frac{pi}{3}}(1-cos 2 phi) mathrm{d} phi+frac{3}{4} int_{frac{pi}{3}}^{frac{pi}{2}}(1+cos 2 phi) mathrm{d} phi==left.frac{1}{4}left(phi-frac{sin 2 phi}{2}right)right|_{0} ^{frac{pi}{3}}+left.frac{3}{4}left(phi+frac{sin 2 phi}{2}right)right|_{frac{pi}{3}} ^{frac{pi}{2}}=frac{pi}{12}-frac{sqrt{3}}{16}+frac{3 pi}{8}-frac{pi}{4}-frac{3 sqrt{3}}{16}=frac{5 pi}{24}-frac{sqrt{3}}{4}.The problem or part of it is added as a scanned document.You can help the project by formatting it using formulas (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Formulas).Source — «http://pluspi.org/wiki/index.php/������������_������ % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BD} % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 5 % mathrm{D} 1 % 86 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BE} % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 2 ldots % mathrm{D} 0 % 98 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BD} % mathrm{D} 1 % 82 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 5 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 3 % mathrm{D} 1 % 80 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 0 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BB} % D1%8B_16-3&quot;Categories: In scan form | Kuznetsov Integral Problems 16 | Integrals- Last edited: 10:33, May 11, 2009.- Content is available under CC-BY-SA 3.0.Created by GeeTeatoo## Problem Kuznetsov Integrals 16-4## Material from PlusPi</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-ccc77b65><span data-v-ccc77b65>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
