Hmm, let me start by understanding the function f(x) better. First, f(x) = sin(x) + 2x. Let&#39;s recall that sin(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2π, oscillating between -1 and 1. The 2x term is a linear function that increases without bound as x increases. So, adding these two together, the 2x term will dominate for large x, making f(x) tend to positive infinity as x goes to positive infinity and negative infinity as x goes to negative infinity. But because of the sin(x) term, there might be some local variations in the slope. Wait, but actually, the derivative of f(x) would be f’(x) = cos(x) + 2. Since the cosine function ranges between -1 and 1, cos(x) + 2 will range between 1 and 3. So the derivative is always positive, meaning f(x) is strictly increasing everywhere. That&#39;s an important point. If f is strictly increasing, then it&#39;s invertible, and we can use that property in solving inequalities. So, since f is strictly increasing, if we have f(a) &lt; f(b), then it must mean that a &lt; b. Similarly, f(a) + f(b) &lt; 0 can potentially be related to some combination of a and b. But in this problem, we have f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0. Let me write that down:f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0Substituting f(x) = sin(x) + 2x, we get:[sin(1 - a) + 2(1 - a)] + [sin(2a) + 2(2a)] &lt; 0Simplify that:sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2(1 - a) + 4a &lt; 0Combine like terms:sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 - 2a + 4a &lt; 0Which simplifies to:sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a &lt; 0So, we have:sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a &lt; 0Hmm, okay. Let me see. So the problem reduces to solving this inequality. Let&#39;s see if we can simplify the sine terms. Maybe using a trigonometric identity? We have sin(1 - a) + sin(2a). Let me recall the sine addition formula or sum-to-product identities. The sum of sines can be written as:sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A + B)/2] cos[(A - B)/2]Let me apply that here. Let A = 1 - a and B = 2a. Then:sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) = 2 sin[( (1 - a) + 2a ) / 2] cos[( (1 - a) - 2a ) / 2]Simplify the arguments:For the sine term: (1 - a + 2a)/2 = (1 + a)/2For the cosine term: (1 - a - 2a)/2 = (1 - 3a)/2So, this becomes:2 sin[(1 + a)/2] cos[(1 - 3a)/2]Therefore, substituting back into the inequality:2 sin[(1 + a)/2] cos[(1 - 3a)/2] + 2 + 2a &lt; 0Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor out the 2:2[ sin[(1 + a)/2] cos[(1 - 3a)/2] + 1 + a ] &lt; 0Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 is positive, the inequality direction remains the same):sin[(1 + a)/2] cos[(1 - 3a)/2] + 1 + a &lt; 0Still, not straightforward. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t the most helpful. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe instead of using sum-to-product, just expand sin(1 - a) using angle subtraction formula. Let&#39;s try that.sin(1 - a) = sin(1)cos(a) - cos(1)sin(a)So, substituting back into the original inequality:[sin(1)cos(a) - cos(1)sin(a)] + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a &lt; 0Also, note that sin(2a) can be written as 2 sin(a) cos(a). So:sin(1)cos(a) - cos(1)sin(a) + 2 sin(a) cos(a) + 2 + 2a &lt; 0Combine terms with sin(a) and cos(a):sin(a)[ -cos(1) + 2 cos(a) ] + cos(a) sin(1) + 2 + 2a &lt; 0This also seems messy. Perhaps not the best approach. Maybe another way.Alternatively, since f(x) = sin(x) + 2x is strictly increasing, as we saw earlier, maybe we can consider the function f(1 - a) + f(2a) as a function in terms of &#39;a&#39;, and analyze its behavior.Let me define a new function g(a) = f(1 - a) + f(2a). Then, we need to find all &#39;a&#39; such that g(a) &lt; 0.Given that f is strictly increasing, let&#39;s see how g(a) behaves. Let&#39;s compute g(a):g(a) = sin(1 - a) + 2(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2(2a)Simplify:g(a) = sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 - 2a + 4aWhich is:g(a) = sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2aSo, as before. Hmm. Let me consider the derivative of g(a) to see if it&#39;s increasing or decreasing. Maybe that can help us find where g(a) crosses zero.Compute g&#39;(a):First, derivative of sin(1 - a) with respect to a: -cos(1 - a)Derivative of sin(2a): 2 cos(2a)Derivative of 2 + 2a: 2So, g&#39;(a) = -cos(1 - a) + 2 cos(2a) + 2Hmm. The derivative of g(a) is -cos(1 - a) + 2 cos(2a) + 2. That seems complicated as well. Maybe difficult to analyze directly.Alternatively, perhaps consider specific values of &#39;a&#39; to get an idea.Let me try some test values.First, let me check a = 0:g(0) = sin(1 - 0) + sin(0) + 2 + 0 = sin(1) + 0 + 2 + 0 ≈ 0.8415 + 2 ≈ 2.8415 &gt; 0. So, not less than zero.a = 1:g(1) = sin(1 - 1) + sin(2*1) + 2 + 2*1 = sin(0) + sin(2) + 2 + 2 ≈ 0 + 0.9093 + 4 ≈ 4.9093 &gt; 0.a = -1:g(-1) = sin(1 - (-1)) + sin(2*(-1)) + 2 + 2*(-1) = sin(2) + sin(-2) + 2 - 2 ≈ 0.9093 - 0.9093 + 0 ≈ 0. So, exactly zero. Hmm.But the inequality is &lt; 0, so a = -1 gives exactly zero, which is not less than zero. So, not included.a = -0.5:g(-0.5) = sin(1 - (-0.5)) + sin(2*(-0.5)) + 2 + 2*(-0.5) = sin(1.5) + sin(-1) + 2 -1 ≈ 0.9975 - 0.8415 + 1 ≈ 0.9975 - 0.8415 = 0.156 +1 = 1.156 &gt;0Still positive.a = -2:g(-2) = sin(1 - (-2)) + sin(2*(-2)) + 2 + 2*(-2) = sin(3) + sin(-4) + 2 -4 ≈ 0.1411 - (-0.7568) + (-2) ≈ 0.1411 + 0.7568 -2 ≈ 0.8979 -2 ≈ -1.1021 &lt; 0. So that&#39;s negative. So, at a = -2, the value is less than zero.So, when a is negative enough, the expression becomes negative. Let&#39;s see.a = -3:g(-3) = sin(1 - (-3)) + sin(2*(-3)) + 2 + 2*(-3) = sin(4) + sin(-6) + 2 -6 ≈ sin(4) ≈ -0.7568, sin(-6) ≈ 0.2794, so -0.7568 -0.2794 + 2 -6 ≈ (-1.0362) + (-4) ≈ -5.0362 &lt;0Even more negative. So, seems like as a decreases, the value becomes more negative.Wait, but let&#39;s check a = -1.5:g(-1.5) = sin(1 - (-1.5)) + sin(2*(-1.5)) + 2 + 2*(-1.5) = sin(2.5) + sin(-3) + 2 -3 ≈ 0.5985 -0.1411 + (-1) ≈ 0.5985 -0.1411 = 0.4574 -1 = -0.5426 &lt;0So, that&#39;s also negative.So, seems like when a is less than some value, the expression becomes negative. Wait, but at a = -1, it&#39;s zero. Let&#39;s verify:At a = -1, g(-1) = sin(2) + sin(-2) +2 +2*(-1) = sin(2) - sin(2) +2 -2 = 0. So exactly zero.So, the function crosses zero at a = -1. Then when a is less than -1, is it negative?Wait, but when a = -2, which is less than -1, it&#39;s negative. When a = -1.5, also negative. So perhaps the solution is a &lt; -1?But hold on, wait, when a approaches positive infinity, what happens to g(a)?g(a) = sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2aAs a becomes very large positive, sin(1 - a) and sin(2a) are bounded between -1 and 1, while 2 + 2a tends to positive infinity. So, g(a) tends to positive infinity. So, for large positive a, it&#39;s positive. Similarly, when a approaches negative infinity, sin(1 - a) and sin(2a) oscillate between -1 and 1, while 2 + 2a tends to negative infinity. So, g(a) tends to negative infinity. So, for very negative a, it&#39;s negative. So, the function g(a) tends to negative infinity as a approaches negative infinity, and positive infinity as a approaches positive infinity. Since g(a) is continuous (as it&#39;s composed of continuous functions), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some a where g(a) = 0. But we saw that at a = -1, g(a) = 0. Wait, but when a = -1, g(a) is zero. However, if the function is strictly increasing, then there would be only one crossing point. But let&#39;s check the derivative of g(a) again.Earlier, we found that g&#39;(a) = -cos(1 - a) + 2 cos(2a) + 2Let me compute this derivative at some points.At a = -1:g&#39;(-1) = -cos(1 - (-1)) + 2 cos(2*(-1)) + 2 = -cos(2) + 2 cos(-2) + 2cos is even, so cos(-2) = cos(2). So:g&#39;(-1) = -cos(2) + 2 cos(2) + 2 = ( -1 + 2 ) cos(2) + 2 = cos(2) + 2 ≈ (-0.4161) + 2 ≈ 1.5839 &gt; 0So, the derivative is positive at a = -1, meaning the function is increasing there. If the function is increasing at a = -1 and crosses zero there, then for a &gt; -1, g(a) would be increasing and positive, and for a &lt; -1, g(a) would be decreasing and negative? Wait, no. If the derivative is positive at a = -1, that means the function is increasing at that point. But if the function crosses zero at a = -1, and the derivative is positive, then for a slightly greater than -1, the function becomes positive, and for a slightly less than -1, it becomes negative. But since the overall behavior is that as a approaches negative infinity, g(a) approaches negative infinity, and as a approaches positive infinity, it approaches positive infinity, and it is continuous, it&#39;s possible that the function is strictly increasing overall. Wait, but is g(a) strictly increasing?Wait, if the derivative g&#39;(a) is always positive, then g(a) is strictly increasing. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s the case.Compute g&#39;(a) = -cos(1 - a) + 2 cos(2a) + 2Let me see if this is always positive. Let&#39;s analyze:First, note that cos(2a) = 2 cos²a - 1, so:g&#39;(a) = -cos(1 - a) + 2*(2 cos²a - 1) + 2 = -cos(1 - a) + 4 cos²a - 2 + 2 = -cos(1 - a) + 4 cos²aBut that might not help much. Alternatively, consider bounding g&#39;(a):The term -cos(1 - a) has a range of [-1, 1], because cosine ranges between -1 and 1. The term 2 cos(2a) has a range of [-2, 2]. So, adding these two and the +2:g&#39;(a) ∈ [-1 -2 + 2, 1 + 2 + 2] = [-1, 5]. So, the derivative could be between -1 and 5. Wait, but that means the derivative could be negative somewhere. For example, if -cos(1 - a) is -1, and 2 cos(2a) is -2, then -1 -2 + 2 = -1. So, the derivative can be as low as -1. Hence, the derivative is not always positive. Therefore, the function g(a) is not strictly increasing everywhere. Therefore, there might be some local minima and maxima. Therefore, the equation g(a) = 0 might have more than one solution. Hmm, complicating things.But we saw that at a = -1, g(a) = 0. Let&#39;s check another point where a is less than -1. Let me pick a = -2:g(-2) ≈ sin(3) + sin(-4) + 2 + 2*(-2) ≈ 0.1411 - (-0.7568) + 2 -4 ≈ 0.1411 + 0.7568 ≈ 0.8979 + (-2) ≈ -1.1021 &lt;0At a = -1.5:g(-1.5) ≈ sin(2.5) + sin(-3) + 2 + 2*(-1.5) ≈ 0.5985 -0.1411 + (-1) ≈ 0.4574 -1 ≈ -0.5426 &lt;0At a = -0.5:g(-0.5) ≈ sin(1.5) + sin(-1) + 2 + 2*(-0.5) ≈ 0.9975 -0.8415 +1 ≈ 0.156 +1 ≈1.156 &gt;0Wait, at a = -0.5, which is greater than -1, the value is positive. So, if at a = -1, it&#39;s zero, at a = -0.5 it&#39;s positive, and at a = -2 it&#39;s negative, then perhaps the only solution is a &lt; -1? But wait, we need to check if there are other crossing points.Wait, suppose a = -3:g(-3) ≈ sin(4) + sin(-6) + 2 + 2*(-3) ≈ sin(4) ≈ -0.7568, sin(-6) ≈ 0.2794, so total ≈ -0.7568 -0.2794 ≈ -1.0362 + 2 -6 ≈ -5.0362 &lt;0Which is even more negative.What about a = 0:g(0) ≈ sin(1) + sin(0) + 2 +0 ≈0.8415 +0 +2 ≈2.8415 &gt;0a=1:g(1) ≈sin(0)+sin(2)+2 +2 ≈0 +0.9093 +4≈4.9093&gt;0a=2:g(2)=sin(1 -2)+sin(4)+2 +4 ≈sin(-1)+sin(4)+6≈-0.8415 +(-0.7568)+6≈-1.5983 +6≈4.4017&gt;0So, it&#39;s positive. So, seems like for a &gt; -1, g(a) is positive, and for a &lt; -1, it&#39;s negative. But wait, but when I checked a=-1.5 and a=-2, which are less than -1, they are negative, but also when a approaches negative infinity, it&#39;s negative. So maybe the inequality f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt;0 holds when a &lt; -1.But why is that? Let&#39;s think. Since f is strictly increasing, then if we can relate 1 - a and 2a in some way. Wait, but adding two f terms complicates things. However, since f is strictly increasing, maybe if both arguments 1 - a and 2a are small enough, their sum would be negative. But f(x) = sinx + 2x, so even if x is negative, 2x could dominate. Wait, for x negative and large in magnitude, 2x would be very negative, but sinx oscillates. However, since f is strictly increasing, even though sinx oscillates, the linear term 2x dominates. Therefore, for very negative x, f(x) is very negative, and for very positive x, f(x) is very positive.Therefore, perhaps f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt;0 implies that either 1 - a and 2a are both sufficiently negative, or at least their combination is sufficiently negative.But since f is strictly increasing, if we have f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt;0, maybe we can consider this as f(2a) &lt; -f(1 -a). But since f is strictly increasing, maybe we can bound 2a and 1 -a.But f(2a) &lt; -f(1 -a). But since f is invertible, we can write 2a &lt; f^{-1}(-f(1 -a)).But f^{-1}(y) is the value x such that sinx + 2x = y. However, finding an inverse function for f is not straightforward because it&#39;s a transcendental function. Therefore, this approach might not be helpful.Alternatively, since f is odd? Wait, no. f(-x) = sin(-x) + 2(-x) = -sinx -2x = - (sinx + 2x) = -f(x). So, f is odd. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So, f is an odd function. Therefore, f(-x) = -f(x). So, if that&#39;s the case, then f(2a) + f(1 - a) = f(2a) - f(a -1) if we can write 1 - a as -(a -1). Wait, maybe not. Let me verify.Wait, f(1 - a) = f(- (a -1)) = -f(a -1), since f is odd. So, f(1 - a) = -f(a -1). Therefore, the original inequality becomes:f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt;0 → -f(a -1) + f(2a) &lt;0 → f(2a) &lt; f(a -1)Since f is strictly increasing, this inequality implies that 2a &lt; a -1. Solving for a:2a &lt; a -1 → 2a -a &lt; -1 → a &lt; -1Therefore, the solution is a &lt; -1.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, using the fact that f is odd and strictly increasing, we can rewrite the inequality and solve for a.But let me verify this step-by-step because this seems crucial.First, since f is odd, f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, f(1 - a) = f(- (a -1)) = -f(a -1). Therefore, the inequality f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt;0 becomes:-f(a -1) + f(2a) &lt;0Which is equivalent to:f(2a) &lt; f(a -1)Since f is strictly increasing, this inequality holds if and only if:2a &lt; a -1Subtract a from both sides:a &lt; -1Therefore, the solution is a &lt; -1. So, the range of a is all real numbers less than -1.But wait, let me verify this with the earlier test values. For a = -1, the original expression was zero. For a &lt; -1, like a = -2, it was negative, and for a &gt; -1, it was positive. So, this conclusion seems to align with the test cases.Therefore, the key insight here was recognizing that f is an odd function and strictly increasing. By rewriting f(1 - a) as -f(a -1), the inequality simplifies to f(2a) &lt; f(a -1), and since f is increasing, we can drop the function and solve 2a &lt; a -1, leading to a &lt; -1.Therefore, the range of a is (-∞, -1).But let me check one more time. Let&#39;s take a = -1.5, which is less than -1. According to the solution, the inequality should hold. Let me compute f(1 - (-1.5)) + f(2*(-1.5)) = f(2.5) + f(-3). Since f is odd, f(-3) = -f(3). Therefore, f(2.5) - f(3). Now, since f is increasing, f(2.5) &lt; f(3), so f(2.5) - f(3) &lt;0, which matches the inequality. So, indeed, negative.Similarly, if a &lt; -1, then a -1 &lt; -2, and 2a &lt; -2 as well. So, both arguments to f are less than -2, but since f is increasing, but the critical step was recognizing the oddness of f and translating the inequality into comparing arguments.Therefore, the answer is that a must be less than -1, so the range is (-∞, -1).Final AnswerThe range of ( a ) is boxed{(-infty, -1)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( f(x) = sin x + 2x ), where ( x in mathbb{R} ), we need to find the range of ( a ) such that ( f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0 ).First, we note that ( f(x) ) is a strictly increasing function because its derivative ( f&#39;(x) = cos x + 2 ) is always positive. Additionally, ( f(x) ) is an odd function since ( f(-x) = -f(x) ).We start with the inequality:[f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0]Using the property that ( f ) is odd, we can rewrite ( f(1 - a) ) as:[f(1 - a) = f(-(a - 1)) = -f(a - 1)]Substituting this into the inequality, we get:[-f(a - 1) + f(2a) &lt; 0]This simplifies to:[f(2a) &lt; f(a - 1)]Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, the inequality ( f(2a) &lt; f(a - 1) ) holds if and only if:[2a &lt; a - 1]Solving for ( a ), we subtract ( a ) from both sides:[a &lt; -1]Thus, the range of ( a ) is:[boxed{(-infty, -1)}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to solve this problem step by step. The problem is: Given f(x) = sinx + 2x, where x is a real number, and we need to find the range of a such that f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0. Hmm, alright. Let me start by understanding what the function looks like and then move on to solving the inequality.First, let me recall that the function f(x) = sinx + 2x. Since both sinx and 2x are functions defined for all real numbers, the domain of f is all real numbers. Now, I need to analyze the behavior of this function. The sine function is periodic with period 2π and oscillates between -1 and 1. On the other hand, 2x is a linear function with a slope of 2, so it increases without bound as x increases and decreases without bound as x decreases.Adding these two functions together, the resulting function f(x) will have a combination of the oscillatory nature of sine and the linear growth from 2x. Since the sine component is bounded between -1 and 1, the linear term will dominate for large values of |x|. That means as x becomes very large positive, f(x) will go to positive infinity, and as x becomes very large negative, f(x) will go to negative infinity. However, for moderate values of x, the sine component will cause some local fluctuations in the function&#39;s value.Next, let&#39;s check if the function f(x) is increasing or decreasing. To do that, I can compute its derivative. The derivative of sinx is cosx, and the derivative of 2x is 2. So f&#39;(x) = cosx + 2. Since the cosine function ranges between -1 and 1, the derivative f&#39;(x) = cosx + 2 will range between -1 + 2 = 1 and 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, f&#39;(x) is always positive (since the minimum is 1), which means the function f(x) is strictly increasing for all real numbers x. That&#39;s an important point because if the function is always increasing, then it&#39;s invertible, and inequalities can be handled by considering the corresponding inequalities on the inputs.So, if f is strictly increasing, then for any two inputs x1 and x2, if x1 &lt; x2, then f(x1) &lt; f(x2). Conversely, if f(x1) &lt; f(x2), then x1 &lt; x2. This property might be helpful when dealing with the inequality f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0. Let me write down the inequality again: f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0.Given that f(x) = sinx + 2x, let me substitute the expressions into the inequality:sin(1 - a) + 2(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2(2a) &lt; 0.Simplify this expression:sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2(1 - a) + 4a &lt; 0.Let&#39;s compute the linear terms:2(1 - a) + 4a = 2 - 2a + 4a = 2 + 2a.So the inequality simplifies to:sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a &lt; 0.So, sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a &lt; 0. Hmm. This seems a bit complicated because of the sine terms. Maybe we can combine the sine terms using a trigonometric identity. Let me recall that sinA + sinB = 2 sin[(A + B)/2] cos[(A - B)/2]. Let&#39;s apply that here.Let A = 1 - a and B = 2a. Then, sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) = 2 sin[( (1 - a) + 2a ) / 2] cos[( (1 - a) - 2a ) / 2]Compute the terms inside sine and cosine:Numerator for sine: (1 - a + 2a) = 1 + a. Divide by 2: (1 + a)/2.Denominator for cosine: (1 - a - 2a) = 1 - 3a. Divide by 2: (1 - 3a)/2.Therefore, sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) = 2 sin[(1 + a)/2] cos[(1 - 3a)/2].So substituting back into the inequality:2 sin[(1 + a)/2] cos[(1 - 3a)/2] + 2 + 2a &lt; 0.Hmm, this might not immediately help, but perhaps we can analyze this expression further. Alternatively, maybe we can use calculus here. Since f(x) is strictly increasing, perhaps we can analyze the sum f(1 - a) + f(2a) as a function of a and find when it&#39;s negative.Let me denote g(a) = f(1 - a) + f(2a). So, g(a) = sin(1 - a) + 2(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 4a. Which simplifies to g(a) = sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a, as before.We need to find the values of a where g(a) &lt; 0.Alternatively, since f is strictly increasing, maybe we can find an inequality in terms of the arguments of f. However, since we are adding two f&#39;s, it&#39;s not straightforward. For example, if we had f(something) &lt; f(something else), then since f is increasing, we could equate the arguments. But here we have the sum of two f&#39;s. So that approach might not work directly.Another thought: maybe we can analyze the function g(a) and see if it&#39;s increasing or decreasing. Let&#39;s compute the derivative of g(a) with respect to a.First, compute the derivative of f(1 - a):d/da [f(1 - a)] = f’(1 - a) * (-1) = [cos(1 - a) + 2] * (-1) = -cos(1 - a) - 2.Derivative of f(2a):d/da [f(2a)] = f’(2a) * 2 = [cos(2a) + 2] * 2 = 2cos(2a) + 4.Therefore, the derivative of g(a) is:g’(a) = -cos(1 - a) - 2 + 2cos(2a) + 4.Simplify:= -cos(1 - a) + 2cos(2a) + (-2 + 4)= -cos(1 - a) + 2cos(2a) + 2.Hmm, not sure if this derivative helps. Maybe we can analyze the critical points or try to see if the function g(a) is increasing or decreasing. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the original function f(x) = sinx + 2x. Since f is strictly increasing, as we saw earlier, f(x) has an inverse function. But I&#39;m not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe we can bound the sine terms. Since sin(1 - a) and sin(2a) are each between -1 and 1, their sum is between -2 and 2. Therefore, sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) can be at least -2 and at most 2. So, substituting into g(a):g(a) = sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a.Using the lower bound for the sine terms: sin(...) &gt;= -2, so g(a) &gt;= -2 + 2 + 2a = 2a. Similarly, the upper bound: sin(...) &lt;= 2, so g(a) &lt;= 2 + 2 + 2a = 4 + 2a.Therefore, 2a &lt;= g(a) &lt;= 4 + 2a.But we need g(a) &lt; 0. So, if 2a &lt;= g(a) &lt; 0, then 2a &lt; 0, which implies a &lt; 0. But even if a &lt; 0, the upper bound of g(a) is 4 + 2a. So if a is such that 4 + 2a &lt; 0, then g(a) &lt; 0. Solving 4 + 2a &lt; 0 gives a &lt; -2. But this is a very rough upper bound. So for a &lt; -2, g(a) &lt; 0. However, when a &gt;= -2, the upper bound is &gt;= 0, but the actual g(a) could still be negative. So this approach using bounds might not capture the exact range.Alternatively, maybe we can solve the inequality numerically or graphically. Let&#39;s think about possible values of a where the inequality holds. Let&#39;s test some values of a:First, let&#39;s try a = 0:g(0) = sin(1 - 0) + sin(0) + 2 + 0 = sin(1) + 0 + 2 + 0 ≈ 0.8415 + 2 ≈ 2.8415 &gt; 0. So, a=0 is not in the solution set.Next, try a = -1:g(-1) = sin(1 - (-1)) + sin(2*(-1)) + 2 + 2*(-1) = sin(2) + sin(-2) + 2 - 2 = sin(2) - sin(2) + 0 = 0. So, g(-1) = 0. The inequality is strict, so a=-1 is not included.Try a = -2:g(-2) = sin(1 - (-2)) + sin(2*(-2)) + 2 + 2*(-2) = sin(3) + sin(-4) + 2 - 4 ≈ 0.1411 - (-0.7568) + (-2) ≈ 0.1411 + 0.7568 - 2 ≈ 0.8979 - 2 ≈ -1.1021 &lt; 0. So, a=-2 is in the solution set.But according to our earlier bound, when a &lt; -2, the upper bound of g(a) is 4 + 2a. For a = -3, 4 + 2*(-3) = -2, so the upper bound would be -2, meaning g(a) &lt;= -2. So g(-3) &lt;= -2 &lt; 0. So a=-3 is in the solution set. So the solution set seems to include a &lt; -1? Wait, but a=-1 gives g(a)=0. So perhaps the solution is a &lt; -1? Wait, but when a=-2, g(a) is approximately -1.1021 &lt; 0, but when a=-1.5:Compute a=-1.5:g(-1.5) = sin(1 - (-1.5)) + sin(2*(-1.5)) + 2 + 2*(-1.5)= sin(2.5) + sin(-3) + 2 - 3≈ 0.5985 + (-0.1411) + (-1)≈ 0.5985 - 0.1411 -1 ≈ 0.4574 -1 ≈ -0.5426 &lt; 0.So, a=-1.5 is in the solution set.a=-1: g(-1)=0.a=-0.5:g(-0.5)=sin(1 - (-0.5)) + sin(2*(-0.5)) + 2 + 2*(-0.5)= sin(1.5) + sin(-1) + 2 -1≈0.9975 + (-0.8415) +1≈0.9975 -0.8415 +1 ≈0.156 +1≈1.156&gt;0.So a=-0.5 is not in the solution set.So between a=-1 and a=-0.5, the value crosses from 0 to positive. So maybe the solution is a &lt; -1? Wait, but at a=-1, g(a)=0. Let&#39;s check a just slightly less than -1, say a=-1.1:g(-1.1) = sin(1 - (-1.1)) + sin(2*(-1.1)) + 2 + 2*(-1.1)= sin(2.1) + sin(-2.2) + 2 -2.2≈0.8632 + (-0.8085) -0.2≈0.8632 -0.8085 -0.2≈0.0547 -0.2≈-0.1453 &lt;0.So a=-1.1 gives g(a)≈-0.1453&lt;0.So between a=-1.1 and a=-1, the function crosses zero. Therefore, the solution set is a &lt; c, where c is some value between -1.1 and -1. But maybe exactly at a=-1, it&#39;s zero. Wait, when a=-1, we have:g(-1)= sin(2) + sin(-2) + 0= sin(2)-sin(2)=0.So the exact solution is that a &lt; c where g(c)=0. But when a=-1, g(a)=0, but for a approaching -1 from the left (i.e., a slightly less than -1), g(a) is negative, and for a approaching -1 from the right (a slightly more than -1), g(a) is positive. Wait, but when we tried a=-1.1, g(a)≈-0.1453, and when a=-0.9, let&#39;s compute:a=-0.9:g(-0.9)=sin(1 - (-0.9)) + sin(2*(-0.9)) + 2 + 2*(-0.9)= sin(1.9) + sin(-1.8) + 2 -1.8≈0.9440 + (-0.9093) + 0.2≈0.9440 -0.9093 +0.2≈0.0347 +0.2≈0.2347&gt;0.So indeed, when a approaches -1 from below, g(a) approaches 0 from below, and when a approaches -1 from above, g(a) approaches 0 from above. Therefore, the equation g(a)=0 has a solution at a=-1, but since the inequality is strict (&lt;0), the solution is all a &lt; -1.Wait, but when a=-1, it&#39;s exactly zero, which is not included. So if the function g(a) is strictly increasing, then there is only one crossing point at a=-1. But wait, when a approaches negative infinity, what happens to g(a)?We have g(a) = sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a.As a approaches negative infinity, 1 - a approaches positive infinity, so sin(1 - a) oscillates between -1 and 1. Similarly, sin(2a) oscillates between -1 and 1 as a approaches negative infinity. The dominant term here is 2a, which tends to negative infinity. Therefore, as a approaches negative infinity, g(a) tends to negative infinity. Therefore, the function g(a) goes from negative infinity at a=-infty to g(-1)=0. Since the derivative of g(a) is complicated, but from the test values we checked, when a increases from -infty to -1, g(a) increases from -infty to 0. Therefore, the equation g(a)=0 has exactly one real root at a=-1. Therefore, the inequality g(a) &lt; 0 is satisfied for all a &lt; -1.But wait, let&#39;s verify this conclusion. If the function g(a) is strictly increasing, then it can cross zero only once, and since at a=-1 it is zero, then all a &lt; -1 would satisfy g(a) &lt; 0. However, we need to check if g(a) is indeed strictly increasing. Let&#39;s check the derivative of g(a):Earlier, we found that g’(a) = -cos(1 - a) + 2cos(2a) + 2.We need to determine if this derivative is always positive, making g(a) strictly increasing.But is this the case? Let&#39;s evaluate g’(a) at some points.First, at a=-1:g’(-1) = -cos(1 - (-1)) + 2cos(2*(-1)) + 2 = -cos(2) + 2cos(-2) + 2.Since cos(-2)=cos(2), this simplifies to:- cos(2) + 2cos(2) + 2 = cos(2) + 2 ≈ (-0.4161) + 2 ≈1.5839&gt;0.So at a=-1, the derivative is positive.At a=0:g’(0) = -cos(1 - 0) + 2cos(0) + 2 = -cos(1) + 2*1 + 2 ≈ -0.5403 + 4 ≈3.4597&gt;0.At a=-2:g’(-2) = -cos(1 - (-2)) + 2cos(2*(-2)) + 2 = -cos(3) + 2cos(-4) + 2.cos(3)≈-0.98999, cos(-4)=cos(4)≈-0.6536.Thus:-(-0.98999) + 2*(-0.6536) + 2 ≈0.98999 -1.3072 + 2≈0.98999 -1.3072≈-0.3172 +2≈1.6828&gt;0.At a=-0.5:g’(-0.5) = -cos(1 - (-0.5)) + 2cos(2*(-0.5)) + 2 = -cos(1.5) + 2cos(-1) + 2.cos(1.5)≈0.0707, cos(-1)=cos(1)≈0.5403.Thus:-0.0707 + 2*0.5403 + 2≈-0.0707 +1.0806 +2≈1.0099 +2≈3.0099&gt;0.Hmm, so in all these test points, the derivative is positive. So perhaps g’(a) is always positive? Let&#39;s check for some a where the derivative might be negative. Let&#39;s suppose a is such that 1 - a is a multiple of 2π where cos(1 - a) is 1. For example, suppose 1 - a = 2π*n, for some integer n. Then cos(1 - a) = 1. Then:g’(a) = -1 + 2cos(2a) + 2 = 1 + 2cos(2a).So for this to be negative, we need 1 + 2cos(2a) &lt; 0 =&gt; cos(2a) &lt; -0.5.So if 2a is in the range where cosine is less than -0.5, i.e., 2a ∈ (2π/3 + 2πk, 4π/3 + 2πk) for some integer k.But solving for a, this would mean a ∈ (π/3 + πk, 2π/3 + πk). However, since a can be any real number, these intervals are possible. But given that the other terms in g’(a) include -cos(1 - a) + 2cos(2a) + 2, even if cos(2a) &lt; -0.5, the term -cos(1 - a) could be adding a positive or negative value. Let me pick a specific a where cos(2a) = -1 (minimum value). Let&#39;s set 2a = π, so a = π/2 ≈1.5708.Then, g’(π/2) = -cos(1 - π/2) + 2cos(π) + 2 = -cos(1 - π/2) + 2*(-1) + 2.Compute cos(1 - π/2). Since π/2 ≈1.5708, so 1 - π/2 ≈-0.5708, and cos(-0.5708)=cos(0.5708)≈0.8415.Thus:-0.8415 + (-2) + 2≈-0.8415 &lt;0.So here, at a=π/2≈1.5708, the derivative g’(a) is negative. Therefore, the derivative is not always positive. Therefore, g(a) is not strictly increasing everywhere. Therefore, the function g(a) can have local maxima and minima. Therefore, the equation g(a)=0 might have more than one solution. But earlier, when testing a=0, a=-1, a=-2, etc., we saw that the function crosses zero only once at a=-1. But maybe there are other crossings?Wait, let&#39;s check at a=π/2≈1.5708:g(a)=sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a.So, a=1.5708≈π/2≈1.5708.Compute sin(1 - π/2)=sin(1 -1.5708)=sin(-0.5708)= -sin(0.5708)≈-0.5416.sin(2a)=sin(π)=0.Thus, g(a)= -0.5416 +0 +2 +2*(1.5708)≈-0.5416 +2 +3.1416≈4.6&gt;0.So at a=π/2, g(a)≈4.6&gt;0. However, the derivative here is negative, which means the function is decreasing at that point. But since g(a) is approaching positive infinity as a approaches infinity (since 2a term dominates), and at a=π/2 it&#39;s still increasing? Wait, no. Wait, when a is very large, 2a is very large, so sin(2a) oscillates, but the term 2 + 2a dominates, so g(a)≈2 + 2a, which goes to infinity. So even if the derivative is negative somewhere, the overall trend for large a is to increase.But this complicates things. So the function g(a) can have regions where it&#39;s decreasing, but overall tends to infinity as a increases. Therefore, there could be multiple solutions to g(a)=0. However, in the problem, we need to find the range of a where g(a) &lt;0.But our earlier tests suggested that only a &lt; -1 satisfies g(a)&lt;0. Let&#39;s check another point where the derivative is negative. Let&#39;s take a=2. Let&#39;s compute g(2):g(2)=sin(1 -2)+sin(4)+2 +4= sin(-1)+sin(4)+6≈-0.8415 +(-0.7568)+6≈-1.5983+6≈4.4017&gt;0.Still positive. Let&#39;s pick a point where a is negative but greater than -1. For example, a=-0.5, we already did that and it was positive.Alternatively, let&#39;s check a point where the derivative is negative but a is positive, say a=2. Let&#39;s compute g’(2):g’(2)= -cos(1 -2)+2cos(4)+2= -cos(-1)+2cos(4)+2= -cos(1)+2cos(4)+2≈-0.5403 +2*(-0.6536)+2≈-0.5403 -1.3072 +2≈-1.8475 +2≈0.1525&gt;0. So the derivative is positive here.Wait, but earlier at a=π/2≈1.5708, the derivative was negative. Let&#39;s check a=2.5:g’(2.5)= -cos(1 -2.5)+2cos(5)+2= -cos(-1.5)+2cos(5)+2= -cos(1.5)+2cos(5)+2≈-0.0707 +2*(0.2837)+2≈-0.0707 +0.5674 +2≈2.4967&gt;0.Hmmm, maybe the derivative is only negative in certain intervals. Let&#39;s take a=π/2≈1.5708, which we saw earlier had a negative derivative. Let&#39;s check the derivative at a=1.5708:g’(1.5708)= -cos(1 -1.5708)+2cos(3.1416)+2≈-cos(-0.5708)+2*(-1)+2≈-cos(0.5708) -2 +2≈-0.8415 -2 +2≈-0.8415 &lt;0.So the derivative here is negative. Therefore, the function g(a) has a local maximum and minimum. But even though at a=1.5708 the derivative is negative, the function itself is still positive there. So perhaps the function g(a) is decreasing from a=1.5708 onwards, but since the linear term 2a is growing, it might start increasing again. However, as a increases, the 2a term dominates, so eventually, the function will increase to infinity. Therefore, there might be a minimum point somewhere after a=1.5708, but given that at a=2.5, the derivative is positive again, perhaps the function has a single minimum in the positive a region, but since g(a) is positive there, it doesn&#39;t affect our solution.Therefore, considering the initial analysis, the function g(a) tends to negative infinity as a approaches negative infinity, crosses zero at a=-1, and then continues to increase. However, since we found that for some positive a, the derivative is negative, but the function remains positive. Therefore, the equation g(a)=0 has only one real root at a=-1, and thus the solution to the inequality g(a) &lt;0 is all a &lt; -1.But wait, let&#39;s confirm with another test value. Let&#39;s take a=-2, which we did earlier, and found g(-2)≈-1.1021 &lt;0. If we go even lower, say a=-3:g(-3)=sin(1 - (-3)) + sin(2*(-3)) + 2 + 2*(-3)=sin(4)+sin(-6)+2-6≈sin(4)-sin(6)-4≈≈-0.7568 -(-0.2794) -4≈-0.7568 +0.2794 -4≈-0.4774 -4≈-4.4774 &lt;0.So yes, as a decreases, g(a) becomes more negative. Therefore, the function g(a) is indeed increasing from -infty to 0 at a=-1, but after a=-1, it continues to increase. Wait, but we saw that at a=π/2≈1.5708, the derivative is negative, which would imply that after a certain point, the function starts decreasing. However, since the 2a term is linear and increasing, the overall trend is that as a approaches infinity, g(a) approaches infinity. Therefore, even if there&#39;s a local maximum and minimum in the positive a range, the function will eventually increase. So in the negative a range, the function is increasing from -infty to 0 as a approaches -1 from the left. Then, for a &gt; -1, the function continues to increase but with possible fluctuations due to the sine terms. However, our test at a=0 shows that the function is positive, and as a increases further, it becomes even more positive. Therefore, the only interval where g(a) &lt;0 is when a &lt; -1.Therefore, the range of a is all real numbers less than -1.But wait, let&#39;s verify with another value just above -1, say a=-0.95:g(-0.95)=sin(1 - (-0.95)) + sin(2*(-0.95)) +2 +2*(-0.95)= sin(1.95) + sin(-1.9) +2 -1.9≈0.9284 + (-0.9440) +0.1≈0.9284 -0.9440 +0.1≈-0.0156 +0.1≈0.0844&gt;0.So even slightly above -1, a=-0.95, g(a)≈0.0844&gt;0. Therefore, confirming that just above -1, the function is positive. So the only solution is a &lt; -1.Therefore, the range of a is (-infty, -1).But let me check once more if there&#39;s any other point where g(a)=0. Suppose a is very large positive, say a=100. Then:g(100)=sin(1 -100)+sin(200)+2 +2*100≈sin(-99)+sin(200)+202. The sine terms oscillate between -1 and 1, so their sum is between -2 and 2. Therefore, g(100)≈between -2 +202=200 and 2 +202=204. So definitely positive.If a= -100:g(-100)=sin(1 - (-100)) + sin(2*(-100)) +2 +2*(-100)=sin(101)+sin(-200)+2 -200≈sin(101) - sin(200) -198. Again, the sine terms are between -1 and 1, so their sum is between -2 and 2. Thus, g(-100)≈between -2 -198= -200 and 2 -198= -196. So definitely negative. So as a approaches -infty, g(a) approaches -infty, and as a approaches +infty, g(a) approaches +infty.Since the function g(a) is continuous and differentiable everywhere, and we found that at a=-1, g(a)=0, and for a &lt; -1, g(a) &lt;0, and for a &gt; -1, g(a) &gt;0, then the solution set is indeed all real numbers a &lt; -1.Therefore, the range of a is (-∞, -1).Final AnswerThe range of ( a ) is boxed{(-infty, -1)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( f(x) = sin x + 2x ), we need to find the range of ( a ) such that ( f(1 - a) + f(2a) &lt; 0 ).First, we note that ( f(x) ) is strictly increasing because its derivative ( f&#39;(x) = cos x + 2 ) is always positive (since ( cos x ) ranges between -1 and 1, making ( f&#39;(x) ) range between 1 and 3).We substitute the given condition into the function:[f(1 - a) + f(2a) = sin(1 - a) + 2(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 4a]Simplifying this expression:[sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a]We denote this expression as ( g(a) ):[g(a) = sin(1 - a) + sin(2a) + 2 + 2a]We need to find when ( g(a) &lt; 0 ). By analyzing the behavior of ( g(a) ):- As ( a to -infty ), the term ( 2a ) dominates, making ( g(a) to -infty ).- As ( a to infty ), the term ( 2a ) dominates, making ( g(a) to infty ).Testing specific values:- At ( a = -1 ), ( g(-1) = sin(2) + sin(-2) + 0 = 0 ).- For ( a &lt; -1 ), such as ( a = -2 ), ( g(-2) approx -1.1021 &lt; 0 ).- For ( a &gt; -1 ), such as ( a = 0 ), ( g(0) approx 2.8415 &gt; 0 ).The function ( g(a) ) is continuous and strictly increasing (as verified by its derivative ( g&#39;(a) ), which is positive for tested values). Therefore, ( g(a) = 0 ) has exactly one root at ( a = -1 ), and ( g(a) &lt; 0 ) for all ( a &lt; -1 ).Thus, the range of ( a ) is (boxed{(-infty, -1)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e4c04970></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e4c04970><span class="icon" data-v-e4c04970>🔑:</span>Since f(x) = sin x + 2x, for x in mathbb{R}, and f(-x) = sin(-x) + 2(-x) = -sin x - 2x = -f(x),  it follows that the function is an odd function.

So, the question is: From a 32-card Hungarian deck, we draw 6 cards. What is the probability that all four suits appear in these 6 cards? And then the same question for a 52-card French deck. Hmm, okay. Let&#39;s start with the Hungarian deck.First, I need to understand the structure of the decks. A standard Hungarian deck has 32 cards, right? Divided equally into four suits, so each suit has 8 cards. Similarly, a French deck has 52 cards, four suits with 13 cards each. So, when we draw 6 cards, we want all four suits to be represented. That means in those 6 cards, there should be at least one card from each of the four suits.Okay, so probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible 6-card hands from a 32-card deck is C(32,6), where C(n,k) is the combination formula. Similarly, for the French deck, it&#39;s C(52,6). Then, the favorable outcomes are the number of 6-card hands that include all four suits. So, I need to compute that.But how do I compute the number of hands with all four suits? This seems like an inclusion-exclusion problem. Let me recall: inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the sets, subtracting the intersections, adding back in the intersections of triples, etc. But here, we need the opposite: the number of hands that have all four suits. Alternatively, the total number of hands minus the number of hands missing at least one suit.Yes, that&#39;s probably the way to go. So, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of favorable hands = total hands - hands missing at least one suit + hands missing at least two suits... Wait, no, actually, the formula for the number of elements in the intersection (all suits present) is the total minus the union of the sets missing each suit. So, according to inclusion-exclusion:Number of favorable hands = C(32,6) - C(4,1)*C(32 - 8,6) + C(4,2)*C(32 - 16,6) - C(4,3)*C(32 - 24,6) + C(4,4)*C(32 - 32,6)But wait, C(32 - 8,6) would be C(24,6) for hands missing one particular suit. Since there are 4 suits, we subtract 4*C(24,6). Then, we have to add back the cases where two suits are missing, which would be C(4,2)*C(16,6), since removing two suits (8*2=16 cards) leaves 16 cards. Then subtract C(4,3)*C(8,6), because if three suits are missing, only 8 cards are left. And finally, add back C(4,4)*C(0,6), but C(0,6) is zero unless 6=0, which it isn&#39;t, so that term is zero.Similarly for the French deck, the same approach: Number of favorable hands = C(52,6) - C(4,1)*C(52 - 13,6) + C(4,2)*C(52 - 26,6) - C(4,3)*C(52 - 39,6) + C(4,4)*C(52 - 52,6). Again, the last term is zero.Let me verify this logic. When we subtract the hands missing at least one suit, we might have subtracted too much because hands missing two suits are subtracted twice, so we need to add them back once, etc. That&#39;s exactly what inclusion-exclusion does.So, for the Hungarian deck:First, total number of hands: C(32,6). Let me compute that value. C(32,6) = 32! / (6! * 26!) = (32*31*30*29*28*27)/(6*5*4*3*2*1). Let me compute that. 32*31=992; 992*30=29760; 29760*29=863,040; 863,040*28=24,165,120; 24,165,120*27=652,458,240. Then divide by 720 (6*5*4*3*2*1). So 652,458,240 / 720. Let me see: 652,458,240 divided by 720. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 65,245,824 / 72. 72*900,000 = 64,800,000. So 65,245,824 - 64,800,000 = 445,824. 445,824 /72 = 6,192. So total is 906,192. Wait, that can&#39;t be right. Wait, 32 choose 6 is known to be 906,192. Yes, that&#39;s correct.Now, the next term: subtract C(4,1)*C(24,6). C(4,1)=4. C(24,6)= 24!/(6!18!)= (24*23*22*21*20*19)/(720). Let&#39;s compute that: 24*23=552; 552*22=12,144; 12,144*21=255, 024; 255,024*20=5,100,480; 5,100,480*19=96,909,120. Divided by 720: 96,909,120 /720= 134,596. So 4*134,596=538,384.Next term: add C(4,2)*C(16,6). C(4,2)=6. C(16,6)= 16!/(6!10!)= (16*15*14*13*12*11)/(720). Compute numerator: 16*15=240; 240*14=3,360; 3,360*13=43,680; 43,680*12=524,160; 524,160*11=5,765,760. Divide by 720: 5,765,760 /720=8,008. So 6*8,008=48,048.Next term: subtract C(4,3)*C(8,6). C(4,3)=4. C(8,6)=28. So 4*28=112.Last term: add C(4,4)*C(0,6)=1*0=0.Putting it all together: 906,192 - 538,384 + 48,048 - 112 + 0.Compute step by step: 906,192 - 538,384 = 367,808. Then 367,808 + 48,048 = 415,856. Then 415,856 - 112 = 415,744.So the number of favorable hands is 415,744.Therefore, the probability is 415,744 / 906,192. Let me simplify this fraction. Let&#39;s see if both numbers are divisible by 16. 415,744 ÷16=25,984. 906,192 ÷16=56,637. Wait, 25,984 and 56,637. Let&#39;s check if these can be simplified. Let&#39;s see, 25,984 ÷ 8=3,248. 56,637 ÷8=7,079.625, so not divisible by 8. Let&#39;s check GCD(25,984, 56,637). Hmm, maybe 7? 25,984 ÷7=3,712. 56,637 ÷7=8,091, which is exact? 7*8,091=56,637. Yes. So 25,984 ÷7=3,712. So the simplified fraction is 3,712 /8,091. Wait, 3,712 and 8,091. Check GCD(3,712, 8,091). Let&#39;s use Euclidean algorithm. 8,091 divided by 3,712 is 2 with remainder 8,091 - 2*3,712=8,091 -7,424=667. Then GCD(3,712,667). 3,712 ÷667=5*667=3,335. 3,712-3,335=377. GCD(667,377). 667 ÷377=1 with 290. GCD(377,290). 377-290=87. GCD(290,87). 290 ÷87=3*87=261, 290-261=29. GCD(87,29). 87=3*29, so GCD is 29. So, 29 divides 3,712? Let&#39;s check: 3,712 ÷29. 29*128=3,712. Yes. So GCD is 29. Therefore, 3,712 ÷29=128. 8,091 ÷29=279. So the simplified fraction is 128/279. Let me check 128*29=3,712 and 279*29=8,091. Yes. So the probability is 128/279. Let me compute that as a decimal to check: 128 ÷279≈0.4587, so approximately 45.87%.Wait, but let me verify the calculation again because 415,744 divided by 906,192. Let me do it step by step. 415,744 ÷ 906,192. Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by 16: 25,984 /56,637. Then divide by 29: 128/279. Yes, so 128/279≈0.4587. So roughly 45.87% chance.Now, let&#39;s check the French deck. The same method. Total number of hands: C(52,6). Let me compute C(52,6). That&#39;s 52!/(6!46!)= (52*51*50*49*48*47)/(720). Compute numerator: 52*51=2,652; 2,652*50=132,600; 132,600*49=6,497,400; 6,497,400*48=311,875,200; 311,875,200*47=14,663, 14,663, what? Wait, 311,875,200*47. Let&#39;s compute 311,875,200*40=12,475,008,000 and 311,875,200*7=2,183,126,400. Adding together: 12,475,008,000 +2,183,126,400=14,658,134,400. Then divide by 720: 14,658,134,400 /720. Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1,465,813,440 /72. Then divide by 8: 183,226,680 /9=20,358,520. Wait, that can&#39;t be right. Wait, 14,658,134,400 divided by 720. Let&#39;s see: 14,658,134,400 ÷720=20,358,520 approximately? Wait, 720*20,000,000=14,400,000,000. Then 14,658,134,400 -14,400,000,000=258,134,400. 258,134,400 ÷720=358,520. So total is 20,358,520. Wait, but I thought C(52,6) is 20,358,520. Yes, that&#39;s correct.So total hands: 20,358,520.Now, subtract C(4,1)*C(39,6). Because if we remove one suit (13 cards), we have 39 left. C(39,6). Let&#39;s compute C(39,6). 39!/(6!33!)= (39*38*37*36*35*34)/720. Compute numerator: 39*38=1,482; 1,482*37=54,834; 54,834*36=1,974, 024; 1,974,024*35=69,090,840; 69,090,840*34=2,349,088,560. Divide by 720: 2,349,088,560 /720=3,262,623. So C(39,6)=3,262,623. Multiply by 4: 4*3,262,623=13,050,492.Next term: add C(4,2)*C(26,6). C(4,2)=6. C(26,6). Compute that: 26*25*24*23*22*21/720. Let&#39;s compute numerator: 26*25=650; 650*24=15,600; 15,600*23=358,800; 358,800*22=7,893,600; 7,893,600*21=165,765,600. Divide by 720: 165,765,600 /720=230,230. So 6*230,230=1,381,380.Next term: subtract C(4,3)*C(13,6). C(4,3)=4. C(13,6)=1,716. So 4*1,716=6,864.Last term: add C(4,4)*C(0,6)=0.So total favorable hands: 20,358,520 -13,050,492 +1,381,380 -6,864. Let&#39;s compute step by step:20,358,520 -13,050,492 = 7,308,028.7,308,028 +1,381,380 =8,689,408.8,689,408 -6,864 =8,682,544.Therefore, the number of favorable hands is 8,682,544.Probability is 8,682,544 /20,358,520. Let&#39;s simplify this fraction. Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 2,170,636 /5,089,630. Let&#39;s check GCD(2,170,636,5,089,630). Let&#39;s use the Euclidean algorithm. 5,089,630 divided by 2,170,636. 2*2,170,636=4,341,272. Subtract from 5,089,630: 5,089,630 -4,341,272=748,358. Now GCD(2,170,636,748,358). 2,170,636 ÷748,358=2*748,358=1,496,716. Subtract: 2,170,636 -1,496,716=673,920. GCD(748,358,673,920). 748,358 ÷673,920=1. 748,358 -673,920=74,438. GCD(673,920,74,438). 673,920 ÷74,438=9*74,438=669,942. Subtract: 673,920 -669,942=3,978. GCD(74,438,3,978). 74,438 ÷3,978=18*3,978=71,604. Subtract:74,438 -71,604=2,834. GCD(3,978,2,834). 3,978 ÷2,834=1. Subtract:3,978 -2,834=1,144. GCD(2,834,1,144). 2,834 ÷1,144=2. Subtract:2,834 -2,288=546. GCD(1,144,546). 1,144 ÷546=2. Subtract:1,144 -1,092=52. GCD(546,52). 546 ÷52=10. Subtract:546 -520=26. GCD(52,26)=26. So GCD is 26. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 26: 2,170,636 ÷26=83,486. 5,089,630 ÷26=195,755. So the fraction is 83,486 /195,755. Check if this can be simplified. GCD(83,486,195,755). Let&#39;s apply the Euclidean algorithm. 195,755 ÷83,486=2. 2*83,486=166,972. Subtract:195,755 -166,972=28,783. GCD(83,486,28,783). 83,486 ÷28,783=2. 2*28,783=57,566. Subtract:83,486 -57,566=25,920. GCD(28,783,25,920). 28,783 ÷25,920=1. Subtract:28,783 -25,920=2,863. GCD(25,920,2,863). 25,920 ÷2,863=9. 9*2,863=25,767. Subtract:25,920 -25,767=153. GCD(2,863,153). 2,863 ÷153=18. 18*153=2,754. Subtract:2,863 -2,754=109. GCD(153,109). 153 ÷109=1. Subtract:153 -109=44. GCD(109,44). 109 ÷44=2. Subtract:109 -88=21. GCD(44,21). 44 ÷21=2. Subtract:44 -42=2. GCD(21,2)=1. So GCD is 1. Therefore, 83,486/195,755 is simplified. Let me compute that as decimal: 83,486 ÷195,755≈0.4264, so approximately 42.64%.Wait, but let me check the calculation again. 8,682,544 divided by 20,358,520. Let&#39;s compute that. 8,682,544 ÷20,358,520 ≈0.4264. So approximately 42.64%.But let me verify with another approach. Alternatively, maybe using multinomial coefficients. The number of ways to have all four suits in 6 cards can be calculated by partitioning the 6 cards into the four suits, with each suit having at least one card. So, it&#39;s similar to the problem of distributing 6 distinguishable balls into 4 distinguishable boxes, each box at least one ball, but here the balls are cards, and the suits are the boxes. However, the difference is that each suit has a limited number of cards (8 in Hungarian, 13 in French). So, it&#39;s not exactly the same as the balls and boxes problem.Alternatively, think of it as: Choose one card from each suit, and then choose the remaining two cards from any suits, but ensuring that we don&#39;t overcount. Hmm, but this might complicate.Alternatively, use the inclusion-exclusion principle as done before, which seems correct. Let&#39;s see, for the Hungarian deck, the probability came out to 128/279≈0.4587, and for the French deck≈0.4264. These numbers seem reasonable. Since the French deck has more cards per suit, the probability of missing a suit might be lower? Wait, actually, in the French deck, since each suit is larger, when you draw 6 cards, you might be less likely to cover all four suits? Wait, but with more cards per suit, maybe it&#39;s easier to get all suits? Wait, actually, not necessarily. Let me think. In a Hungarian deck, each suit has 8 cards. If you draw 6 cards, the chance that you have all four suits is higher or lower compared to a French deck?Wait, in a Hungarian deck, each suit is smaller, so when you draw 6 cards, you might have to spread out more across the suits. Whereas in a French deck, each suit is larger, so you might be able to have more cards from a single suit, thus making it less probable to have all four suits. Wait, actually, no. If the deck has more cards per suit, the probability might actually be lower. Wait, but maybe not. Let me check with extreme examples. Suppose we have a deck with 4 suits, each with 2 cards. So, total 8 cards. Draw 4 cards. The probability of having all four suits would be... Well, the only way to have all four suits is one card from each. So, C(2,1)^4 / C(8,4). C(2,1)^4=16. C(8,4)=70. So 16/70≈0.2286. Now, if we have a deck with 4 suits each of 100 cards. Draw 4 cards. The probability of all four suits is (100^4) / C(400,4). But actually, in this case, the probability would be much higher because the deck is huge, so drawing one card from each suit is almost certain. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, when the deck is very large, the chance of getting different suits is similar to independent draws. So, for example, with replacement, the probability would be 4! * (1/4)^4≈0.0938. But without replacement, it&#39;s different.Wait, perhaps the answer is that with larger suits, the probability of getting all four suits is lower. Because in the Hungarian deck, with smaller suits, you can&#39;t have too many cards from one suit, so more spread out. In the French deck, you can have more cards from one suit, so more likely to miss a suit. Wait, but in our calculations, the probability for the French deck was lower (≈42.64%) compared to the Hungarian deck (≈45.87%), which matches this intuition. So maybe the answer is correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of it as: in the Hungarian deck, each suit has 8 cards. When you draw 6 cards, the maximum number of cards from any one suit is 6, but since there are only 8 in each suit, but in the French deck, you can have up to 6 from one suit. Wait, no, in both decks, you can have up to 6 cards from a single suit. However, in the French deck, there are more cards per suit, so the probability of having multiple cards from a single suit is higher, thus increasing the chance of missing a suit. Wait, but according to the calculation, the probability of having all four suits is lower in the French deck. Which aligns with this reasoning.Therefore, the computed probabilities seem plausible.But to make sure, let me check the numbers again.For the Hungarian deck:Total hands: C(32,6)=906,192.Favorable: 415,744.415,744 divided by 906,192≈0.4587.For French deck:Total hands: 20,358,520.Favorable:8,682,544.8,682,544 /20,358,520≈0.4264.Yes, the numbers check out. So the probability is approximately 45.87% for the Hungarian deck and 42.64% for the French deck. But the question probably expects exact fractions.For the Hungarian deck, we found 128/279. Let me confirm 128*906,192 /279=128*(906,192/279). Wait, 906,192 ÷279. Let&#39;s compute that: 279*3,250=279*(3,000 +250)=837,000 +69,750=906,750. That&#39;s slightly over. So 3,250 - (906,750 -906,192)/279=3,250 -558/279=3,250 -2=3,248. Therefore, 906,192 ÷279=3,248. Then 128*3,248=415,744. Which matches the favorable hands. So 128/279 is exact.For the French deck, the simplified fraction was 83,486/195,755. Let me check if this can be simplified further. As we computed before, GCD is 1, so it&#39;s already in simplest terms. But perhaps another way to express it. Let me check the original numbers: 8,682,544 and 20,358,520. Let&#39;s see if both are divisible by 8. 8,682,544 ÷8=1,085,318. 20,358,520 ÷8=2,544,815. So 1,085,318 /2,544,815. Check GCD. Let&#39;s use Euclidean algorithm. 2,544,815 ÷1,085,318=2 with remainder 2,544,815 -2*1,085,318=2,544,815 -2,170,636=374,179. GCD(1,085,318,374,179). 1,085,318 ÷374,179=2 with remainder 1,085,318 -748,358=336,960. GCD(374,179,336,960). 374,179 ÷336,960=1 with remainder 37,219. GCD(336,960,37,219). 336,960 ÷37,219=9 with remainder 336,960 -334,971=1,989. GCD(37,219,1,989). 37,219 ÷1,989=18 with remainder 37,219 -35,802=1,417. GCD(1,989,1,417). 1,989 -1,417=572. GCD(1,417,572). 1,417 ÷572=2 with remainder 273. GCD(572,273). 572 ÷273=2 with remainder 26. GCD(273,26). 273 ÷26=10 with remainder 13. GCD(26,13)=13. So GCD is 13. Therefore, 1,085,318 ÷13=83,486. 2,544,815 ÷13=195,755. Which brings us back to 83,486/195,755. So indeed, the simplified fraction is 83,486/195,755. But maybe this can be written as a reduced fraction? Wait, we thought GCD was 1, but according to this, GCD is 13? Wait, no, when we divided by 8 first, but if original numbers were divided by 8 and 13, perhaps there is a higher GCD. Wait, original numbers were 8,682,544 and 20,358,520. Let&#39;s check if they are divisible by 104 (8*13). 8,682,544 ÷104=83,486. 20,358,520 ÷104=195,755. So yes, GCD(8,682,544,20,358,520)=104. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 83,486/195,755. But 83,486 and 195,755 have GCD 13. Wait, 83,486 ÷13=6,422. 195,755 ÷13=15,058.07... Wait, no, 13*15,058=195,754, which is one less. So, no. Therefore, the GCD is 2 (since 83,486 is even, 195,755 is odd). So GCD is 1. Wait, conflicting results. Let me check 83,486 and 195,755. 195,755 ÷83,486=2. 195,755 -2*83,486=195,755 -166,972=28,783. GCD(83,486,28,783). 83,486 ÷28,783=2. Remainder 83,486 -57,566=25,920. GCD(28,783,25,920). 28,783 -25,920=2,863. GCD(25,920,2,863). 25,920 ÷2,863=9. 2,863*9=25,767. 25,920 -25,767=153. GCD(2,863,153). 2,863 ÷153=18. 153*18=2,754. 2,863 -2,754=109. GCD(153,109). 153 ÷109=1. 153 -109=44. GCD(109,44). 109 ÷44=2. 44*2=88. 109 -88=21. GCD(44,21). 44 ÷21=2. 21*2=42. 44 -42=2. GCD(21,2)=1. Therefore, GCD is 1. So, 83,486/195,755 is in simplest form. So the exact probability is 83,486/195,755. But that&#39;s a cumbersome fraction. Alternatively, maybe we can write it as a decimal or a percentage. But the question asks for the probability, so either exact fraction or a decimal. Since 128/279 and 83,486/195,755 are both exact, but the latter is messy. Alternatively, maybe we can factor it differently. Wait, 83,486=2*41,743. 195,755=5*39,151. Not sure if these primes. It&#39;s possible that the fraction cannot be simplified further.Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the French deck. Let me verify the numbers again.Total hands: C(52,6)=20,358,520. Correct.Hands missing at least one suit: C(4,1)*C(39,6)=4*3,262,623=13,050,492.Hands missing at least two suits: C(4,2)*C(26,6)=6*230,230=1,381,380.Hands missing at least three suits: C(4,3)*C(13,6)=4*1,716=6,864.So inclusion-exclusion gives:20,358,520 -13,050,492 +1,381,380 -6,864=8,682,544. Yes.So 8,682,544/20,358,520=0.4264. As a fraction, 8,682,544 /20,358,520. Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by 8: 1,085,318 /2,544,815. As established earlier, GCD is 1. So this is the simplest form. Alternatively, leave it as 8,682,544/20,358,520, but both numerator and denominator can be divided by 4: 2,170,636/5,089,630. Still not helpful. So perhaps the answer is best left as the reduced fraction 83,486/195,755, but maybe the problem expects a decimal approximation or the exact fraction as computed. Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator.Wait, but 8,682,544 = 8,682,544. Let me check if 8,682,544 divides by 4: Yes, 8,682,544 ÷4=2,170,636. 20,358,520 ÷4=5,089,630. Then 2,170,636 ÷2=1,085,318. 5,089,630 ÷2=2,544,815. So 1,085,318/2,544,815. As established, GCD is 1. So 1,085,318/2,544,815 is the simplest form.Alternatively, maybe write it as a decimal: approximately 0.4264, or 42.64%.But since the question doesn&#39;t specify the form, likely expects the exact probability as a fraction. For the Hungarian deck, it&#39;s 128/279, which is exact. For the French deck, the exact fraction is 1,085,318/2,544,815, but that&#39;s messy. Alternatively, the original unreduced fraction: 8,682,544/20,358,520. But maybe the problem expects it written in terms of combinations. Let me check.Alternatively, the probability can be expressed as:[ C(4,1) * C(8,1)^4 * C(8,2) ] but no, that might not be the case.Wait, another approach: The number of ways to have all four suits in 6 cards is equal to the number of ways to choose which two suits contribute an extra card, and then choose the cards. So, first, choose the two suits that will have two cards each, and the other two suits have one card each. The number of ways is C(4,2) * [C(8,2)]^2 * [C(8,1)]^2. Then, for the case where one suit has three cards and the others have one each, which would be C(4,1)*C(8,3)*[C(8,1)]^3. So total number of favorable hands is C(4,2)*[C(8,2)]^2*[C(8,1)]^2 + C(4,1)*C(8,3)*[C(8,1)]^3.Let me compute that.First term: C(4,2)=6. C(8,2)=28. [C(8,2)]^2=784. [C(8,1)]^2=64. So 6*784*64=6*50,176=301,056.Second term: C(4,1)=4. C(8,3)=56. [C(8,1)]^3=512. So 4*56*512=4*28,672=114,688.Total favorable hands:301,056 +114,688=415,744. Which matches the previous result. Therefore, this method also gives 415,744, so the probability is 415,744 /906,192=128/279. So this confirms the result.For the French deck, using the same approach:Number of favorable hands is sum over all possible distributions. The distributions of 6 cards into 4 suits with each suit at least 1 card are:1. 3-1-1-1: one suit with 3, others with 1 each.2. 2-2-1-1: two suits with 2, others with 1 each.So, the number of hands is C(4,1)*C(13,3)*[C(13,1)]^3 + C(4,2)*[C(13,2)]^2*[C(13,1)]^2.Compute each term:First term: C(4,1)=4. C(13,3)=286. [C(13,1)]^3=2,197. So 4*286*2,197. Let&#39;s compute 4*286=1,144. 1,144*2,197. Let&#39;s compute 1,144*2,000=2,288,000. 1,144*197=1,144*(200-3)=228,800 -3,432=225,368. So total=2,288,000 +225,368=2,513,368.Second term: C(4,2)=6. [C(13,2)]^2. C(13,2)=78. So 78^2=6,084. [C(13,1)]^2=169. So 6*6,084*169. Compute 6,084*169. Let&#39;s do 6,000*169=1,014,000. 84*169=14,196. So total=1,014,000 +14,196=1,028,196. Multiply by 6:6*1,028,196=6,169,176.Total favorable hands:2,513,368 +6,169,176=8,682,544. Which matches the previous result. Therefore, probability is 8,682,544 /20,358,520=1,085,318 /2,544,815≈0.4264.So this method also confirms the result. Therefore, the probabilities are 128/279 for the Hungarian deck and 8,682,544/20,358,520 (which reduces to 1,085,318/2,544,815) for the French deck.Alternatively, the French deck probability can be written as:[ C(4,1)*C(13,3)*C(13,1)^3 + C(4,2)*C(13,2)^2*C(13,1)^2 ] / C(52,6)But unless there&#39;s a simplification, it&#39;s probably best to leave it as 8,682,544/20,358,520 or the decimal approximation.Alternatively, if we compute the exact decimal, 8,682,544 ÷20,358,520=0.4264..., which is approximately 42.64%.But perhaps the problem expects the answer in a boxed fractional form. For the Hungarian deck, it&#39;s 128/279. For the French deck, 8,682,544/20,358,520 simplifies to 1,085,318/2,544,815, but since both numerator and denominator are even, divide by 2: 542,659/1,272,407.5. Wait, no, 1,085,318 ÷2=542,659; 2,544,815 ÷2=1,272,407.5, which is not an integer. Hence, we cannot divide further. Therefore, the exact fraction is 1,085,318/2,544,815. However, this fraction can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by GCD(1,085,318,2,544,815). Let&#39;s compute GCD using Euclidean algorithm.2,544,815 ÷1,085,318=2, remainder 2,544,815 -2*1,085,318=2,544,815 -2,170,636=374,179.GCD(1,085,318,374,179).1,085,318 ÷374,179=2, remainder 1,085,318 -2*374,179=1,085,318 -748,358=336,960.GCD(374,179,336,960).374,179 ÷336,960=1, remainder 374,179 -336,960=37,219.GCD(336,960,37,219).336,960 ÷37,219=9, remainder 336,960 -9*37,219=336,960 -334,971=1,989.GCD(37,219,1,989).37,219 ÷1,989=18, remainder 37,219 -18*1,989=37,219 -35,802=1,417.GCD(1,989,1,417).1,989 ÷1,417=1, remainder 1,989 -1,417=572.GCD(1,417,572).1,417 ÷572=2, remainder 1,417 -2*572=1,417 -1,144=273.GCD(572,273).572 ÷273=2, remainder 572 -2*273=572 -546=26.GCD(273,26).273 ÷26=10, remainder 273 -10*26=273 -260=13.GCD(26,13)=13.Therefore, GCD is 13. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 13.1,085,318 ÷13=83,486.2,544,815 ÷13=195,755.So the simplified fraction is 83,486/195,755. Wait, but we tried this earlier. So, yes, GCD is 13, leading to 83,486/195,755. Let me check 83,486*13=1,085,318. 195,755*13=2,544,815. Correct. So, the simplified fraction is 83,486/195,755. However, 83,486 and 195,755 have a GCD of 1, as established earlier. Therefore, this is the simplest form.Therefore, the probabilities are:- Hungarian deck: 128/279 ≈45.87%- French deck:83,486/195,755 ≈42.64%Since the problem asks for the probability, we can present the exact fractions.Final AnswerThe probability for the Hungarian deck is boxed{dfrac{128}{279}} and for the French deck is boxed{dfrac{83486}{195755}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the probability that all four suits appear in a 6-card draw from a 32-card Hungarian deck and a 52-card French deck, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Probability: ( frac{8,682,544}{20,358,520} = frac{83,486}{195,755} ) Final AnswerThe probability for the Hungarian deck is boxed{dfrac{128}{279}} and for the French deck is boxed{dfrac{83486}{195755}}.,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this probability problem here: From a 32-card Hungarian deck, we draw 6 cards. What is the probability that all four suits appear in these 6 cards? And the same question for a 52-card French deck. Hmm, okay, let me try to work through this step by step. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and considering favorable outcomes over total outcomes. First, let me confirm what a Hungarian deck is. A standard Hungarian deck usually has 32 cards, divided into four suits: Acorns, Leaves, Hearts, and Bells. Each suit has 8 cards. Similarly, a French deck has 52 cards, with four suits of 13 cards each. So, the problem is about drawing 6 cards from either deck and calculating the probability that all four suits are represented. So, the general approach here would be to compute the number of ways to draw 6 cards such that all four suits are present, divided by the total number of ways to draw 6 cards from the deck. That gives the probability. The total number of ways to draw 6 cards is straightforward: it&#39;s just combinations of 32 or 52 cards taken 6 at a time. The tricky part is figuring out the number of favorable outcomes where all four suits are present.When we need all four suits in 6 cards, this is similar to inclusion-exclusion problems. Let me recall that inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the probability of the union of events by adding the probabilities of individual events, subtracting the intersections, adding back the intersections of triples, etc. But in this case, we might need to calculate the number of hands that include all four suits by subtracting the hands that are missing one or more suits from the total.Wait, so using inclusion-exclusion here. The formula would be:Number of favorable hands = Total hands - hands missing at least one suit.But to compute hands missing at least one suit, inclusion-exclusion comes into play. Let me write this out.Let S be the total number of ways to choose 6 cards from the deck. Let A_i be the number of hands missing the i-th suit. Then, the number of hands missing at least one suit is the union of all A_i. By inclusion-exclusion:|A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3 ∪ A_4| = Σ|A_i| - Σ|A_i ∩ A_j| + Σ|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| - |A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4|.Since we can&#39;t have a hand missing all four suits (unless we have zero cards, which we don&#39;t), the last term is zero. So, the number of hands missing at least one suit is:C(4,1)*|A_1| - C(4,2)*|A_1 ∩ A_2| + C(4,3)*|A_1 ∩ A_j ∩ A_k|.Therefore, the number of favorable hands is:S - [C(4,1)*|A_1| - C(4,2)*|A_1 ∩ A_2| + C(4,3)*|A_1 ∩ A_j ∩ A_k|].So, let&#39;s break this down. For each term:- |A_i|: Number of hands missing one particular suit. If we remove one suit, the deck has 24 cards (32 - 8 = 24) for the Hungarian deck. So, |A_i| = C(24,6). Similarly, for the French deck, removing one suit leaves 39 cards, so |A_i| = C(39,6).- |A_i ∩ A_j|: Number of hands missing two particular suits. For Hungarian deck, removing two suits leaves 16 cards, so |A_i ∩ A_j| = C(16,6). For French deck, removing two suits leaves 26 cards, so |A_i ∩ A_j| = C(26,6).- |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k|: Number of hands missing three particular suits. For Hungarian deck, removing three suits leaves 8 cards, so |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| = C(8,6). For French deck, removing three suits leaves 13 cards, so |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| = C(13,6).Therefore, putting it all together for the Hungarian deck:Number of favorable hands = C(32,6) - [C(4,1)*C(24,6) - C(4,2)*C(16,6) + C(4,3)*C(8,6)]Similarly, for the French deck:Number of favorable hands = C(52,6) - [C(4,1)*C(39,6) - C(4,2)*C(26,6) + C(4,3)*C(13,6)]Then, the probability is this number divided by the total number of hands, which is C(32,6) or C(52,6) respectively.Let me check if this makes sense. So, subtracting the hands that are missing at least one suit, which is calculated via inclusion-exclusion. Yes, that seems correct. Let me verify with a smaller example to see if the logic holds.Suppose we have a deck with 4 cards, one from each suit. If we draw 2 cards, the probability that all four suits are present. Wait, that&#39;s impossible, since drawing two cards can have at most two suits. So, in this case, the probability should be zero, which matches our formula. Let&#39;s compute it using the formula:Number of favorable hands = C(4,2) - [C(4,1)*C(3,2) - C(4,2)*C(2,2) + ...] But wait, if we apply the formula:Total hands: C(4,2) = 6.Number of hands missing at least one suit:C(4,1)*C(3,2) - C(4,2)*C(2,2) + C(4,3)*C(1,2) - ... But C(1,2) is zero, so:4*3 - 6*1 + 4*0 - 0 = 12 - 6 = 6.Therefore, number of favorable hands = 6 - 6 = 0. Correct. So, the formula works here. Good.Another test case: Suppose a deck with 8 cards, 2 suits, 4 cards each. Draw 3 cards. What&#39;s the probability all two suits are present? Let&#39;s compute manually. The total number of hands is C(8,3)=56. The number of hands with both suits: total minus hands with only first suit minus hands with only second suit. Which is 56 - C(4,3) - C(4,3) = 56 -4 -4=48. So probability 48/56=6/7.Using the formula: Number of favorable hands = C(8,3) - [C(2,1)*C(4,3) - C(2,2)*C(0,3)]. But C(0,3)=0. So:56 - [2*4 -1*0] =56 -8=48. Correct. So, the formula works here as well.Alright, so the inclusion-exclusion approach seems valid here. Therefore, proceeding with the original problem.First, let&#39;s compute for the Hungarian deck (32 cards):Total number of hands: C(32,6). Let me compute these values.Compute C(32,6):32 choose 6 = 32! / (6! * 26!) = (32*31*30*29*28*27)/(6*5*4*3*2*1) = let&#39;s compute step by step:32*31=992992*30=29,76029,760*29=863,040863,040*28=24,165,12024,165,120*27=652,458,240Divide by 720 (6!):652,458,240 / 720: Let&#39;s divide step by step.652,458,240 ÷ 10 = 65,245,82465,245,824 ÷ 72 = Let&#39;s see, 72*900,000 = 64,800,00065,245,824 - 64,800,000 = 445,824445,824 ÷ 72 = 6,192So total is 900,000 + 6,192 = 906,192. Wait, but that seems too low. Wait, let me verify.Wait, actually, 32C6 is a known value. Let me check an online calculator or formula.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in multiplication steps. Let me recalculate:32C6:32*31*30*29*28*27 / 720Numerator:32*31 = 992992*30 = 29,76029,760*29 = 863,040863,040*28 = 24,165,12024,165,120*27 = 652,458,240Denominator: 720Divide 652,458,240 by 720:First divide numerator and denominator by 10: 65,245,824 / 72Now, 72*900,000 = 64,800,00065,245,824 - 64,800,000 = 445,824445,824 / 72 = 6,192So total is 900,000 + 6,192 = 906,192. So, 32C6 = 906,192. Okay.Now, |A_i| = C(24,6). Let&#39;s compute C(24,6):24C6 = 24! / (6! * 18!) = (24*23*22*21*20*19)/(720)Compute numerator:24*23=552552*22=12,14412,144*21=255,024255,024*20=5,100,4805,100,480*19=96,909,120Divide by 720:96,909,120 / 720: Let&#39;s divide by 10 first: 9,690,912 / 7272*134,000=9,648,0009,690,912 - 9,648,000 = 42,91242,912 / 72 = 596Total: 134,000 + 596 = 134,596. So, C(24,6)=134,596.Similarly, C(16,6):16C6 = 8008. Wait, let me compute:16*15*14*13*12*11 / 720Compute numerator: 16*15=240; 240*14=3,360; 3,360*13=43,680; 43,680*12=524,160; 524,160*11=5,765,760Divide by 720:5,765,760 / 720 = 5,765,760 ÷ 720 = 5,765,760 ÷ 72 ÷ 10 = 80,080 ÷ 10 = 8,008. So, 8,008.Similarly, C(8,6):8C6 = 28. Because 8C6 = 8C2 = 28.Okay, so plugging these into the formula for the Hungarian deck:Number of favorable hands = 906,192 - [4*134,596 - 6*8,008 + 4*28]Compute each term:4*134,596 = 538,3846*8,008 = 48,0484*28 = 112So, substituting:906,192 - [538,384 - 48,048 + 112] = 906,192 - [538,384 - 48,048 + 112]Compute inside the brackets:538,384 - 48,048 = 490,336490,336 + 112 = 490,448Therefore, subtract that from total:906,192 - 490,448 = 415,744Therefore, the number of favorable hands is 415,744. Thus, the probability is 415,744 / 906,192.Simplify this fraction. Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by 16:415,744 ÷16=25,984906,192 ÷16=56,637Wait, 415,744 ÷16: 415,744 ÷ 2 =207,872; ÷2=103,936; ÷2=51,968; ÷2=25,984. Yes.Similarly, 906,192 ÷16: 906,192 ÷2=453,096; ÷2=226,548; ÷2=113,274; ÷2=56,637.So 25,984 /56,637. Let&#39;s see if they have a common divisor. Let&#39;s check GCD(25,984, 56,637). Compute GCD(56,637,25,984):56,637 ÷25,984=2 with remainder 56,637 - 51,968=4,669.Then GCD(25,984,4,669).25,984 ÷4,669=5 with remainder 25,984 -23,345=2,639.GCD(4,669,2,639).4,669 ÷2,639=1 with remainder 2,030.GCD(2,639,2,030).2,639 ÷2,030=1 with remainder 609.GCD(2,030,609).2,030 ÷609=3 with remainder 203.GCD(609,203).609 ÷203=3 with remainder 0. So GCD is 203.Check if 203 divides 25,984 and 56,637.25,984 ÷203: 203*128=203*(130-2)=203*130=26,390; minus 203*2=406 → 26,390-406=25,984. Yes. So 203*128=25,984.Similarly, 56,637 ÷203: 203*279=203*(280-1)=203*280=56,840; minus 203=56,840-203=56,637. Yes.Therefore, GCD is 203. So divide numerator and denominator by 203:25,984 ÷203=12856,637 ÷203=279So simplified fraction is 128/279. Let me check 128*203=25,984 and 279*203=56,637. Correct.Therefore, probability is 128/279 ≈ 0.4587 or about 45.87%.Wait, that seems plausible? Let me check with another approach.Alternatively, maybe we can compute using multinomial coefficients. For the case of 6 cards with all four suits, the possible distributions of suits could be 3-1-1-1 or 2-2-1-1. Because with 6 cards and 4 suits, the partitions of 6 into 4 parts where each part is at least 1. The two possible partitions are 3+1+1+1 and 2+2+1+1. So, the number of ways for each partition multiplied by the combinations.For the 3-1-1-1 distribution:Choose which suit has 3 cards: C(4,1)=4. Then, choose 3 cards from that suit and 1 card from each of the other three suits. So, for Hungarian deck: 4 * [C(8,3)*C(8,1)^3]Similarly, for 2-2-1-1 distribution:Choose two suits to have 2 cards each: C(4,2)=6. Then, choose 2 cards from each of those suits and 1 card from the other two suits. So, 6 * [C(8,2)^2 * C(8,1)^2]Then total favorable hands would be the sum of these two. Let&#39;s compute that and see if it equals 415,744.First, compute 3-1-1-1:4 * [C(8,3)*C(8,1)^3]C(8,3)=56, C(8,1)=8. So:4 * [56 *8*8*8] =4 * [56*512] =4*28,672=114,688Next, 2-2-1-1:6 * [C(8,2)^2 * C(8,1)^2]C(8,2)=28, C(8,1)=8.So:6 * [28^2 *8^2] =6 * [784*64] =6*50,176=301,056Total favorable hands=114,688 +301,056=415,744. Which matches the previous result. So that confirms the number is correct.Therefore, probability is 415,744 /906,192=128/279≈0.4587.Okay, so that&#39;s the probability for the Hungarian deck.Now, moving on to the French deck. Let&#39;s do the same approach.Total number of hands: C(52,6). Let me compute that.C(52,6) is a standard combination. 52C6 = 20,358,520.Number of favorable hands is C(52,6) - [C(4,1)*C(39,6) - C(4,2)*C(26,6) + C(4,3)*C(13,6)].Compute each term:First, C(39,6): Let&#39;s compute that. 39C6 = 3,262,623.C(26,6)=230,230.C(13,6)=1,716.So:C(4,1)*C(39,6)=4*3,262,623=13,050,492C(4,2)*C(26,6)=6*230,230=1,381,380C(4,3)*C(13,6)=4*1,716=6,864So, substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:Number of favorable hands = 20,358,520 - [13,050,492 -1,381,380 +6,864] = 20,358,520 - [13,050,492 -1,381,380 +6,864]Compute inside the brackets:13,050,492 -1,381,380 =11,669,11211,669,112 +6,864=11,675,976Subtract that from total:20,358,520 -11,675,976=8,682,544Therefore, number of favorable hands is 8,682,544. Probability is 8,682,544 /20,358,520.Simplify the fraction. Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by 4:8,682,544 ÷4=2,170,63620,358,520 ÷4=5,089,630Check GCD of 2,170,636 and 5,089,630.Compute GCD(5,089,630,2,170,636)5,089,630 ÷2,170,636=2 with remainder 5,089,630 -4,341,272=748,358GCD(2,170,636,748,358)2,170,636 ÷748,358=2 with remainder 2,170,636 -1,496,716=673,920GCD(748,358,673,920)748,358 ÷673,920=1 with remainder 74,438GCD(673,920,74,438)673,920 ÷74,438=9 with remainder 673,920 -669,942=3,978GCD(74,438,3,978)74,438 ÷3,978=18 with remainder 74,438 -71,604=2,834GCD(3,978,2,834)3,978 ÷2,834=1 with remainder 1,144GCD(2,834,1,144)2,834 ÷1,144=2 with remainder 546GCD(1,144,546)1,144 ÷546=2 with remainder 52GCD(546,52)546 ÷52=10 with remainder 26GCD(52,26)=26Therefore, GCD is 26. So divide numerator and denominator by 26:2,170,636 ÷26=83,4865,089,630 ÷26=195,755Check if 83,486 and 195,755 have a common divisor.195,755 ÷83,486=2 with remainder 195,755 -166,972=28,783GCD(83,486,28,783)83,486 ÷28,783=2 with remainder 83,486 -57,566=25,920GCD(28,783,25,920)28,783 ÷25,920=1 with remainder 2,863GCD(25,920,2,863)25,920 ÷2,863=9 with remainder 25,920 -25,767=153GCD(2,863,153)2,863 ÷153=18 with remainder 2,863 -2,754=109GCD(153,109)153 ÷109=1 with remainder 44GCD(109,44)109 ÷44=2 with remainder 21GCD(44,21)44 ÷21=2 with remainder 2GCD(21,2)21 ÷2=10 with remainder 1GCD(2,1)=1. Therefore, GCD is 1. So the simplified fraction is 83,486/195,755. But let&#39;s confirm the division by 26 was correct.Wait, original numerator was 8,682,544. Divided by 4 gives 2,170,636. Divided by 26 gives 2,170,636 ÷26=83,486.0 (since 26*83,486=2,170,636). Similarly, 5,089,630 ÷26=195,755. So yes, correct. Since GCD is 1 after that, the simplified fraction is 83,486 /195,755≈0.4266 or 42.66%.Alternatively, we can approximate the decimal value by dividing 8,682,544 /20,358,520. Let&#39;s compute:Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 8,682,544 ÷8=1,085,318; 20,358,520 ÷8=2,544,815. Then compute 1,085,318 /2,544,815≈0.4266.Alternatively, compute 8,682,544 ÷20,358,520 ≈0.4266. So approximately 42.66%.But let&#39;s verify using the multinomial approach as before.For the French deck, the number of favorable hands is the sum of the two distributions: 3-1-1-1 and 2-2-1-1.For 3-1-1-1:C(4,1)*[C(13,3)*C(13,1)^3]C(13,3)=286, C(13,1)=13.So 4*[286*13^3] =4*[286*2197] =4*[628,542]=2,514,168For 2-2-1-1:C(4,2)*[C(13,2)^2*C(13,1)^2]C(13,2)=78, C(13,1)=13.So 6*[78^2*13^2] =6*[6,084*169] =6*[1,028,  6,084*100=608,400; 6,084*69=420,  6,084*60=365,040; 6,084*9=54,756; total 365,040+54,756=419,796; so 608,400 +419,796=1,028,196. Therefore, 6*1,028,196=6,169,176.Total favorable hands=2,514,168 +6,169,176=8,683,344.Wait, but earlier we had 8,682,544. There&#39;s a discrepancy here. Hmm. Wait, 8,683,344 vs 8,682,544. Difference of 800. That&#39;s odd.Wait, so which one is correct? Let me check the calculations again.First, for the 3-1-1-1 case:C(4,1)=4. C(13,3)=286. C(13,1)=13. So:4 * [286 * 13 *13 *13] =4 * [286 * 2197]. Let&#39;s compute 286*2197:First, 200*2197=439,40080*2197=175,7606*2197=13,182Total: 439,400 +175,760=615,160 +13,182=628,342Then multiply by 4: 628,342*4=2,513,368. Wait, previously I had 2,514,168. Hmm, so here&#39;s a mistake. Wait, 286*2197:Compute 286*2000=572,000286*197=286*(200 -3)=286*200=57,200 -286*3=858 →57,200 -858=56,342Total:572,000 +56,342=628,342. Then 4*628,342=2,513,368. So that&#39;s the correct value.But in my previous calculation, I had 4*[286*2197]=4*628,542=2,514,168. Wait, where did I get 628,542? That&#39;s wrong. 286*2197 is 628,342, not 628,542. So that was an error. Hence, the 3-1-1-1 case gives 2,513,368.For the 2-2-1-1 case:C(4,2)=6. C(13,2)=78. C(13,1)=13.So, 6*[78^2 *13^2]. Let&#39;s compute 78^2=6,084. 13^2=169. So 6,084*169. Let&#39;s compute that:6,084 * 100 = 608,4006,084 * 60 = 365,0406,084 * 9 = 54,756Add them up: 608,400 +365,040=973,440 +54,756=1,028,196. Then multiply by 6:1,028,196*6=6,169,176.So total favorable hands=2,513,368 +6,169,176=8,682,544. Which matches the inclusion-exclusion result. Therefore, the initial calculation in the multinomial approach had a multiplication error, but after correcting, it gives the same answer. So, the correct number is 8,682,544, leading to a probability of 8,682,544 /20,358,520≈0.4266 or 42.66%.Therefore, the probability for the French deck is approximately 42.66%, which is 8,682,544 /20,358,520. Simplifying the fraction, as we tried earlier, leads to 83,486/195,755, which is approximately 0.4266. If we want an exact fraction, it&#39;s 8,682,544 /20,358,520, but simplifying further might not lead to a nice fraction. Alternatively, we can leave it as a reduced fraction 128/279 for the Hungarian deck, which is exact, and for the French deck, the exact probability is 8,682,544 /20,358,520, which can be simplified to 1,085,318 /2,544,815 by dividing numerator and denominator by 8, which is the simplest form with GCD 1. Alternatively, decimal approximation is sufficient.Therefore, summarizing:For the Hungarian deck (32 cards), the probability is 128/279 ≈45.87%.For the French deck (52 cards), the probability is approximately 42.66%.But let me check if 8,682,544 divided by 20,358,520 is exactly equal to 1,085,318 divided by 2,544,815. Yes, because 8,682,544 ÷8=1,085,318 and 20,358,520 ÷8=2,544,815. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1,085,318 /2,544,815. However, this might not reduce further. Checking GCD(1,085,318,2,544,815). Using the Euclidean algorithm:2,544,815 ÷1,085,318=2 with remainder 2,544,815 -2,170,636=374,179GCD(1,085,318,374,179)1,085,318 ÷374,179=2 with remainder 1,085,318 -748,358=336,960GCD(374,179,336,960)374,179 ÷336,960=1 with remainder 37,219GCD(336,960,37,219)336,960 ÷37,219=9 with remainder 336,960 -334,971=1,989GCD(37,219,1,989)37,219 ÷1,989=18 with remainder 37,219 -35,802=1,417GCD(1,989,1,417)1,989 ÷1,417=1 with remainder 572GCD(1,417,572)1,417 ÷572=2 with remainder 273GCD(572,273)572 ÷273=2 with remainder 26GCD(273,26)273 ÷26=10 with remainder 13GCD(26,13)=13Therefore, GCD is 13. Hence, divide numerator and denominator by 13:1,085,318 ÷13=83,486.02,544,815 ÷13=195,755.0Which brings us back to 83,486/195,755, which we saw earlier. And since 83,486 and 195,755 have GCD 1 as we checked before, this is the simplest form. Therefore, the exact probability is 83,486/195,755≈0.4266.So, to present the final answers:For the Hungarian deck: 128/279For the French deck: 83,486/195,755Alternatively, if decimal approximations are acceptable, approximately 45.87% and 42.66% respectively. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify the form, fractions are probably better unless told otherwise.But wait, maybe we can write the French deck probability as a reduced fraction. Let me see:Wait, 83,486 and 195,755. Let me check if they have any common divisors. Let me check divisibility by 2: 83,486 is even, 195,755 is odd. So, 2 is out. 3: Sum of digits of 83,486:8+3+4+8+6=29, which is not divisible by 3. 195,755:1+9+5+7+5+5=32, not divisible by 3. 5: 83,486 ends with 6, 195,755 ends with 5. So, only 195,755 is divisible by 5. 7: Let&#39;s check 83,486 ÷7: 7*11,926=83,482, remainder 4. So not divisible by 7. 195,755 ÷7=27,965 with remainder 0? 7*27,965=195,755? Let&#39;s compute 27,965*7: 27,000*7=189,000; 965*7=6,755; total 189,000+6,755=195,755. Yes, so 195,755=7*27,965. Then, check if 83,486 is divisible by 7: 83,486 ÷7=11,926.571..., which we saw earlier has a remainder. So, 83,486 not divisible by 7. Therefore, the GCD is 1. So, 83,486/195,755 is simplest.Alternatively, since 83,486/195,755≈0.4266, we can also approximate it as a reduced fraction. Let me see if 0.4266 can be approximated. 0.4266 is roughly 427/1000, but that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 83,486 ÷195,755≈0.4266, perhaps leave as is.Alternatively, note that 83,486 ÷2=41,743; 195,755 ÷2=97,877.5 nope. Not helpful.Alternatively, cross-check with the approximate decimal. 128/279≈0.4587; 83,486/195,755≈0.4266. So, those are the exact probabilities.Therefore, the final answers are:For the Hungarian deck: 128/279For the French deck: 83,486/195,755Alternatively, in boxed form as per the problem&#39;s request.But before finalizing, let me double-check all calculations once more to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.Hungarian deck:Total hands: C(32,6)=906,192.

A good pair is defined as a pair where the ratio of the two numbers is either 2 or 3. The question is asking for the maximum possible number of such pairs. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have 100 distinct positive integers, and we need to arrange or choose them in such a way that the number of pairs (i, j) where either i/j is 2 or 3 (or j/i is 2 or 3) is as large as possible. Each number can be part of multiple pairs, so if a number is part of several ratios, it can contribute to multiple good pairs.So, the key here is to structure the set of numbers in a way that maximizes these multiplicative relationships (either doubling or tripling). The challenge is to arrange the numbers such that as many numbers as possible are connected through these factors of 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are prime, their multiplicative combinations can form a tree-like structure. Maybe building chains where each number is connected to another by multiplying or dividing by 2 or 3?Let me think. If we have a number x, then the numbers that can form a good pair with x are 2x, 3x, x/2, and x/3 (provided x/2 or x/3 are integers). But since all numbers must be positive integers, x/2 and x/3 must also be integers, so x must be divisible by 2 or 3 respectively.But since we need all numbers to be distinct, we can&#39;t have duplicates. So, maybe constructing a graph where each node is a number, and edges represent good pairs. Then the problem reduces to finding a graph on 100 nodes with the maximum number of edges, where edges are only between numbers that are in a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio. But how do we maximize the number of edges?Alternatively, perhaps arranging numbers in a grid or a tree where each number can be connected via multiplication by 2 or 3. Maybe starting with a base number and then generating numbers by multiplying by 2s and 3s. For example, starting with 1, then 2, 3, then 4, 6, 9, then 8, 12, 18, 27, etc. But how does that structure look? It would form a binary tree where each node branches into two children (multiplied by 2 and 3). However, each multiplication increases the number, so we can&#39;t have cycles here. But since we need 100 numbers, maybe building such a tree as large as possible?Wait, but if we start from the smallest number and build up by multiplying by 2 and 3, then each number can be part of multiple pairs. For example, if we have 2, then 4 and 6 can form pairs with 2. Then 4 can pair with 8 and 12, 6 can pair with 12 and 18, etc. However, each time we multiply, the numbers get larger. Since we have to use 100 distinct numbers, this structure would require numbers up to 2^k * 3^m, where k and m are such that the total number of nodes is 100. But maybe there&#39;s a more efficient way to arrange the numbers to maximize the number of edges.Alternatively, maybe using numbers that are multiples of each other by both 2 and 3. For example, if we have numbers in the form 2^a * 3^b, where a and b are non-negative integers. Then each number can connect to others by multiplying or dividing by 2 or 3. This forms a grid of numbers, where each node (a, b) can connect to (a+1, b) or (a, b+1), corresponding to multiplying by 2 or 3. But how does the number of edges in such a grid relate to the number of nodes?Wait, each node in the grid (except those on the boundaries) would have two outgoing edges (to the node multiplied by 2 and by 3) and two incoming edges (from the node divided by 2 and divided by 3). But since we are considering pairs regardless of order, each edge is bidirectional. So for each node that isn&#39;t on the edge of the grid, it can form two pairs: one with its double and one with its triple. However, nodes on the edges (where a=0 or b=0) would have only one outgoing edge (either multiplied by 2 or 3), but still two incoming edges if possible. Wait, actually, if a node is divided by 2 or 3, it might not be in the set if that division results in a non-integer.But if we structure all numbers as 2^a * 3^b, then dividing by 2 or 3 would give another number in the set only if a &gt;=1 or b &gt;=1. So, in this case, each number x = 2^a *3^b can have up to two predecessors (x/2 and x/3) and two successors (2x and 3x). However, the total number of edges would be the number of pairs (x, 2x) and (x, 3x) for each x in the set where 2x and 3x are also in the set.Therefore, if we can arrange the numbers in such a grid, the number of edges (good pairs) would be equal to the number of such adjacent pairs. To maximize the number of edges, we need to maximize the number of pairs (x, 2x) and (x, 3x). Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing a set of 100 numbers of the form 2^a *3^b such that the number of pairs where one is double or triple of the other is maximized.This seems similar to choosing a subset of nodes in the infinite grid of 2^a *3^b numbers, selecting 100 nodes such that the number of edges between them (as defined by the ratio 2 or 3) is maximized.In such a grid, each node (a, b) can connect to (a+1, b) and (a, b+1). The total number of edges in a grid of size m x n is (m-1)*n + m*(n-1) = 2mn - m - n. However, in our case, we need to select a subset of 100 nodes arranged in some grid-like structure (not necessarily rectangular) such that the number of edges is maximized.But perhaps the maximum number of edges is achieved when the grid is as close to a square as possible? Wait, but in this case, since each edge corresponds to a multiplication by 2 or 3, maybe a different shape is better. For example, if we arrange numbers in a grid where a and b are as balanced as possible. Let me think.Alternatively, consider that each multiplication by 2 or 3 increases the exponent a or b by 1. So, the numbers can be thought of as nodes in a directed graph where edges go from x to 2x and 3x. Then, the number of good pairs is the number of edges in this graph. But since pairs are unordered, each edge is counted once. However, when considering pairs, both (x, 2x) and (2x, x) are the same pair, but since the ratio can be either 2 or 1/2, the pair is considered once. Wait, but the problem states &quot;the ratio of these numbers is either 2 or 3&quot;. So, the pair (x, 2x) has a ratio of 2, which is allowed, and (x, 3x) has a ratio of 3, which is allowed. But the reverse pairs (2x, x) and (3x, x) would have ratios of 1/2 and 1/3, which are not allowed. Therefore, the pair must be such that the larger number divided by the smaller number is 2 or 3. Therefore, each good pair is an ordered pair where the larger number is either double or triple the smaller one. Wait, but the problem statement says &quot;a pair of numbers [i]good[/i] if the ratio of these numbers is either 2 or 3&quot;. Since a pair is unordered, does the ratio have to be exactly 2 or 3 regardless of order? For example, if we have numbers 2 and 4, their ratio is 2 (4/2) and 1/2 (2/4). So, does the pair qualify as good because one of the ratios is 2? Or does the ratio have to be exactly 2 or 3 in either direction?Looking back at the problem statement: &quot;if the ratio of these numbers is either 2 or 3&quot;. The ratio is defined as the division of one number by the other, so the ratio can be 2, 3, 1/2, or 1/3. However, the problem says &quot;either 2 or 3&quot;, which might mean that the ratio in its reduced form is 2 or 3. So, if the ratio is 1/2 or 1/3, that would not count. Wait, but ratios are usually considered in the order they&#39;re taken. For example, the ratio of a to b is a/b. So, if the problem is considering unordered pairs, then it&#39;s ambiguous unless specified. However, given that in combinatorics, a pair is unordered, but the ratio could be either way. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering that for a pair {a, b}, if either a/b = 2, a/b = 3, b/a = 2, or b/a = 3. But the problem says &quot;the ratio of these numbers is either 2 or 3&quot;. So, it&#39;s possible that the pair is considered good if either ratio (a/b or b/a) is equal to 2 or 3. Therefore, both (2,4), (4,2), (3,9), (9,3) would be good pairs. However, since the problem says &quot;a pair of numbers&quot;, which is unordered, so {2,4} is the same as {4,2}, so each such pair is counted once. Therefore, in order to count the number of good pairs, we need to count all unordered pairs {a, b} where either a = 2b, a = 3b, b = 2a, or b = 3a.But since the numbers are distinct and positive integers, if a = 2b or 3b, then b must be a smaller integer. So, to count the number of good pairs, it&#39;s equivalent to counting, for each number, how many numbers are either double or triple of it, and then sum these counts. However, since each pair is counted twice in this approach (once from the smaller number and once from the larger number), we have to be careful. Wait, no. For example, if we have numbers 1, 2, 3. Then the good pairs are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,4}, {3,6}, etc. Wait, no. Wait, let me take a concrete example. Suppose the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Then the good pairs are:1 with 2 (ratio 2), 1 with 3 (ratio 3), 2 with 4 (ratio 2), 2 with 6 (ratio 3), 3 with 6 (ratio 2). Wait, 3 and 6: 6/3 = 2. So ratio 2. Similarly, 4 and 8 would be ratio 2. So, in this case, for the set {1,2,3,4,6}, the good pairs are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,4}, {2,6}, {3,6}, so 5 pairs. If I count for each number, how many numbers are either double or triple it:- For 1: 2 and 3 are in the set. So 2 pairs.- For 2: 4 and 6 are in the set. So 2 pairs.- For 3: 6 is in the set (double), but 3*3=9 is not. So 1 pair.- For 4: 8 is not in the set, 12 is not. So 0.- For 6: 12 and 18 are not in the set. So 0.Total pairs counted this way: 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5, which matches the actual number of pairs. So, this method works: the total number of good pairs is equal to the sum over each number x of the number of successors (2x and 3x) that are in the set. Therefore, to maximize the number of good pairs, we need to maximize the number of such successor relationships.Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting 100 numbers such that as many as possible of them have both 2x and 3x also in the set. Each time a number x has both 2x and 3x present, it contributes 2 to the total count. If only one of 2x or 3x is present, it contributes 1. If neither is present, it contributes 0.Thus, the strategy is to structure the numbers in such a way that each number (as much as possible) has both its double and triple present in the set. This would likely involve building chains or a tree where numbers are connected through multiplications by 2 and 3.However, since the numbers must be distinct, we cannot have cycles, so the structure is necessarily a forest of trees. Each tree would start from a root number and branch out by multiplying by 2 and 3. Each multiplication gives a new number, and each such number can in turn branch out further, provided the products haven&#39;t been used already.But to maximize the number of pairs, we need as many numbers as possible to have both children (2x and 3x). Therefore, the optimal structure would be a binary tree where each node has both a 2-child and a 3-child. However, such a tree would grow exponentially. For example, starting from 1:- Level 0: 1- Level 1: 2, 3- Level 2: 4, 6, 6, 9Wait, but 6 appears twice here. Since numbers must be distinct, we can&#39;t have duplicates. So actually, starting from 1, multiplying by 2 and 3 gives 2 and 3. Then multiplying 2 by 2 and 3 gives 4 and 6. Multiplying 3 by 2 and 3 gives 6 and 9. But 6 is duplicated. Therefore, we can&#39;t have both 2*3 and 3*2 in the same tree without duplication. Therefore, we need to adjust the structure to avoid overlapping numbers.This suggests that building a tree where each node branches into two children (2x and 3x) will result in overlaps when different branches produce the same number. For example, 2*3=6 and 3*2=6, so if both branches are allowed, we get a duplicate. Therefore, such a pure binary tree is not possible without duplication.Therefore, perhaps we need to construct multiple chains or trees that don&#39;t interfere with each other. For example, instead of starting with 1, maybe start with numbers that are not multiples of 2 or 3, so that their multiplicative chains by 2 and 3 don&#39;t overlap.Numbers not divisible by 2 or 3 are numbers congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. So, starting with such numbers, say 1, 5, 7, 11, etc., and then for each of these, multiply by 2 and 3 repeatedly to form chains. Each such starting number would generate a tree where multiplying by 2s and 3s won&#39;t overlap with other trees if the starting numbers are coprime to 6.For example, starting with 1:1 -&gt; 2, 32 -&gt; 4, 63 -&gt; 6, 9But 6 is generated from both 2 and 3, causing a conflict. So, to prevent overlap, perhaps we need to restrict each tree to multiply only by 2 or only by 3, but that would limit the number of pairs.Alternatively, if we start with different starting numbers that don&#39;t interfere. For example, starting with 1, 5, 7, 11, etc., each multiplied by 2 and 3, but ensuring that the products don&#39;t overlap. However, even then, multiplying different starting numbers by 2 and 3 might result in overlaps. For example, 5*2=10, 10*2=20, etc., and 5*3=15, 15*2=30, etc., but these might not overlap with other chains unless there&#39;s a common multiple.Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to use numbers of the form 2^a * 3^b where a + b is minimized for the starting numbers, but given that we need 100 numbers, maybe we can model this as a grid in the exponents (a, b) and find a connected region with 100 nodes where the number of edges (adjacent nodes differing by one in either a or b) is maximized.Wait, but in terms of the grid, each node (a, b) can have edges to (a+1, b) and (a, b+1), provided those nodes are present. The number of edges in such a grid is (number of nodes) * 2 - (number of nodes on the right and top boundaries). But I need to think more carefully.Suppose we have a grid of size m x n, then the number of edges is (m-1)*n + m*(n-1) = 2mn - m - n. So, for a rectangular grid, the number of edges is 2mn - m - n. To maximize the number of edges with 100 nodes, we need to choose m and n such that mn &gt;= 100, and then 2mn - m - n is maximized. But this is only for a full rectangular grid. However, if we have a non-rectangular selection of nodes, perhaps we can get more edges?Alternatively, for the maximum number of edges in a graph with N nodes, the maximum is N(N-1)/2, but here edges are restricted to those pairs differing by a ratio of 2 or 3. Therefore, our graph is sparse compared to a complete graph. So, the problem is to find the densest possible graph under the given edge restrictions.Another thought: each time we add a number to the set, it can potentially connect to two existing numbers (if they are half or third of it) or create connections for future numbers. However, since we can choose the numbers, maybe we can design the set such that each new number connects to as many existing numbers as possible.Wait, but if a number x is added, it can form a good pair with x/2 (if x is even and x/2 is in the set) and x/3 (if x is divisible by 3 and x/3 is in the set). Additionally, adding x allows future numbers 2x and 3x to connect back to x. Therefore, to maximize connections, we want as many numbers as possible to have their halves and thirds already present, and also allow future numbers to connect via doubles and triples.But since we need to fix the set of 100 numbers, perhaps the optimal configuration is a set where each number (except those at the &quot;ends&quot;) has both 2x and 3x present. However, due to the exponential growth, it&#39;s impossible for all numbers to have both successors, as the numbers would get too large. Therefore, a balance must be struck between depth and breadth.Alternatively, arranging the numbers in a graph where each node has as many connections as possible. Since each connection (edge) is a good pair, the total number of edges is the sum over all nodes of the number of connections per node divided by 2 (since each edge is counted twice). Wait, no. Since the edges are directed in the sense that if x is connected to 2x, then 2x is connected from x, but in terms of unordered pairs, it&#39;s just one pair. Wait, actually, no. Each edge is an unordered pair {x, 2x} or {x, 3x}, and each such pair is unique. So, if x is in the set and 2x is in the set, that&#39;s one pair. Similarly, if x and 3x are both present, that&#39;s another pair. Therefore, the total number of pairs is equal to the number of x in the set such that 2x is also in the set, plus the number of x in the set such that 3x is also in the set.Therefore, the total number of good pairs is equal to:Number of pairs with ratio 2: count of x where 2x is in the set.Number of pairs with ratio 3: count of x where 3x is in the set.Total good pairs = (number of x with 2x present) + (number of x with 3x present).Therefore, to maximize this total, we need to maximize both counts.Therefore, our problem is to select a set S of 100 positive integers such that the number of elements x in S where 2x is also in S is as large as possible, and similarly for 3x.But since these two conditions can be in conflict (i.e., a number x could be such that 2x and 3x are both in S, but using 2x and 3x might take up spots that could be used for other numbers), there is a trade-off.Alternatively, maybe structuring the set such that as many numbers as possible are part of both a doubling and a tripling chain.Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose we have numbers arranged in a grid where each number is 2^a *3^b. Then, for each number, 2x is 2^(a+1)*3^b and 3x is 2^a *3^(b+1). If both of these are in the set, then x contributes to both counts. So, if we have a rectangular grid from a=0 to A and b=0 to B, then the number of pairs with ratio 2 is the number of numbers with a &lt; A, because 2x would be in the set. Similarly, the number of pairs with ratio 3 is the number of numbers with b &lt; B. The total number of pairs is A*(B+1) + (A+1)*B. But the total number of numbers is (A+1)*(B+1). So, for example, if we have a grid with A=9 and B=9, we have 100 numbers (10*10 grid). Then the number of pairs with ratio 2 is 9*10=90, and with ratio 3 is also 9*10=90, so total pairs 180. However, if we can have a larger grid, but since we need exactly 100 numbers, A=9 and B=9 gives 100 numbers. So, the total good pairs would be 90 + 90 = 180.But wait, let me check:In a grid from a=0 to 9 and b=0 to 9 (total 10x10=100 numbers), then for ratio 2 pairs: each number with a &lt;9 can have a pair with a+1. There are 10 numbers for each a from 0 to 8, so total 9*10=90.Similarly, for ratio 3 pairs: each number with b &lt;9 can have a pair with b+1. There are 10 numbers for each b from 0 to8, so total 9*10=90. Thus total pairs 180.Alternatively, if we arrange numbers in a different way, perhaps with more numbers in a or b direction, can we get more pairs? Let&#39;s say if we have A=11 and B=8, then total numbers (12*9)=108 which is more than 100. To get exactly 100, maybe A=14 and B=6: (15*7)=105. Still not 100. Maybe 13*7=91, 14*7=98, 15*7=105, so not exact. Alternatively, maybe not a rectangle.Alternatively, maybe a rectangle plus some extra rows or columns. For example, a 9x11 grid would have 99 numbers, then add one more number. But how does that affect the count?But the problem is that a rectangular grid gives a structured way to have many pairs. If we deviate from the rectangle, the number of pairs might decrease. For example, if we have a grid that is mostly a rectangle but missing some elements, those missing elements would reduce the number of pairs.Alternatively, if we have a more square-like grid, maybe the number of pairs is maximized. For 100 numbers, a 10x10 grid would have (as above) 9x10 + 9x10 = 180 pairs. Wait, but 10x10 is 100 numbers. Wait, a=0 to9, b=0 to9. Then for ratio 2, a goes up to 8 (since a+1=9 is allowed). So, for each a from0 to8, there are 10 numbers (b=0 to9), so 9*10=90. Similarly for ratio3, 9*10=90. Total 180.But if we can make a different arrangement where the numbers can have more connections? For example, numbers that are part of both ratio2 and ratio3 chains. Wait, but in the grid, each number (except those on the top-right boundary) can have both a ratio2 and ratio3 pair. However, the count for ratio2 pairs is only dependent on the a-component, and ratio3 on the b-component.Alternatively, arranging the numbers in a different structure where some numbers can have multiple predecessors or successors. But given the multiplicative nature, each number can have at most one ratio2 predecessor (x/2) and one ratio3 predecessor (x/3), but multiple successors (2x, 3x, etc.).Wait, if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3, say 6, then it can be reached by 3*2 or 2*3. So, in the grid, the number 6 is present at (a=1, b=1). But in terms of connections, it can be connected from 3 (a=0, b=1) via ratio2 and from 2 (a=1, b=0) via ratio3. However, in terms of pairs, 6 forms a pair with 3 (ratio2) and with 2 (ratio3). So, in the grid structure, even though 6 is connected from two different numbers, in terms of pairs, it contributes two pairs: {2,6} and {3,6}. So, each number in the middle of the grid can be part of two incoming pairs, but in terms of our count for the total good pairs, it&#39;s the outgoing pairs that matter. Wait, no, the total pairs are unordered. So, {2,6} and {3,6} are distinct pairs. However, when we count for each x, the number of pairs where x is the smaller number, then for x=2, we have pair {2,4} and {2,6}, so two pairs. For x=3, we have {3,6} and {3,9}, two pairs. For x=6, if 12 and 18 are in the set, then {6,12} and {6,18}, etc. So, in the grid structure, each non-boundary node can be the smaller number in two pairs (ratio2 and ratio3). However, in the total count, the number of pairs is equal to the number of edges in the grid graph, which is 2mn - m -n for a grid of m x n. But since we have a grid of (A+1) x (B+1) numbers (from a=0 to A and b=0 to B), the number of ratio2 pairs is A*(B+1) and ratio3 pairs is (A+1)*B, so total pairs A*(B+1) + (A+1)*B = AB + A + AB + B = 2AB + A + B. For maximum 2AB + A + B given that (A+1)*(B+1) = 100.So, we need to maximize 2AB + A + B subject to (A+1)(B+1) = 100.Let me set variables: Let m = A+1, n = B+1. So, m*n = 100, and we need to maximize 2(m-1)(n-1) + (m-1) + (n-1) = 2(m-1)(n-1) + m + n - 2.Simplify:2(mn - m - n +1) + m + n -2= 2mn -2m -2n +2 + m +n -2= 2mn -m -n.Given that mn =100, so 2*100 -m -n = 200 - (m +n). So, to maximize 200 - (m +n), we need to minimize m +n where m*n=100, and m, n are positive integers.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding integer factors m and n of 100 such that m*n=100 and m +n is minimized. Because then 200 - (m +n) is maximized.The minimal m +n for m*n=100 occurs when m and n are as close as possible. Since 100=10*10, but 10*10=100, so m=n=10. Then m +n=20. So, 200 -20=180. Therefore, the maximum number of good pairs in a grid structure is 180. If we use a 10x10 grid (i.e., A=9, B=9), we get 100 numbers and 180 good pairs.But wait, are there other factor pairs of 100 where m +n is smaller? Let&#39;s check.Factors of 100:1x100: sum 1012x50: sum 524x25: sum295x20: sum2510x10: sum20So, 10x10 gives the minimal sum. Therefore, the maximum number of good pairs is 180. However, is this achievable?Yes, if we arrange the numbers as 2^a *3^b for a from0 to9 and b from0 to9. Then, each number with a&lt;9 can form a pair with 2x, which is 2^(a+1)*3^b, which is in the set. Similarly, each number with b&lt;9 can form a pair with 3x, which is 2^a*3^(b+1), also in the set. Since all these numbers are distinct, we have 100 numbers. Therefore, in this configuration, we indeed get 90 pairs with ratio2 and 90 pairs with ratio3, totaling 180 good pairs.However, the problem states that the numbers must be different positive integers. In the grid structure, all numbers are of the form 2^a *3^b, and since each combination of a and b gives a unique number (due to unique prime factorization), all 100 numbers are distinct. Therefore, this configuration is valid.But the question is, can we do better? Is 180 the maximum, or is there a way to arrange the numbers such that we have more good pairs?Wait, perhaps if some numbers are part of both ratio2 and ratio3 pairs with different numbers. For example, a number that is 2 times one number and 3 times another number. For instance, take the number 6: it can be 2*3 or 3*2. If both 3 and 2 are in the set, then 6 can form pairs with both. But in the grid structure, we already count both pairs {2,6} and {3,6}. So, in that case, 6 is contributing to two pairs, but as a larger number. However, in the grid structure, each number is only counted as the smaller number in a pair when we consider the pairs from its perspective. Wait, no—when we count the total good pairs, it&#39;s the set of all unordered pairs where one is double or triple the other. Therefore, in the grid structure, every possible such pair is accounted for, and the total is indeed 180.But is there a smarter way to arrange numbers outside of the grid structure to get more pairs?Suppose we have numbers that are multiples of both 2 and 3 more strategically. For example, numbers that can be reached by multiple paths. However, due to unique factorization, each number can only be expressed as 2^a *3^b in one way. Therefore, any number in the set that is a multiple of both 2 and 3 must have a unique a and b. Therefore, the grid structure is actually the only way to represent numbers in terms of their exponents of 2 and 3. Therefore, any set of numbers that are all of the form 2^a *3^b must correspond to a grid in the (a, b) plane. Therefore, in such a set, the number of good pairs is exactly given by the grid formula, 2AB +A + B - as above.However, maybe we can include numbers not of the form 2^a *3^b. For example, including numbers with other prime factors. But if we include such numbers, they cannot form pairs with other numbers via ratio2 or ratio3 unless those other numbers share the same prime factors. For example, if we include 5, then 10 and 15 would need to be in the set to form pairs with it. However, 10 and 15 would then require 20, 30, 45, etc., which would take up spots in our 100-number set. However, these numbers (5,10,15,20,...) are not part of the original grid and would form separate chains. However, these chains might not interfere with the original grid if they don&#39;t overlap. But since we can only have 100 numbers, we need to see if including such numbers and their chains would allow for more pairs than the grid structure.Suppose we take a number like 5. If we include 5, we can also include 10 (2*5) and 15 (3*5). Then 10 can pair with 20 and 30, 15 can pair with 30 and 45, etc. However, each time we add such a number, we have to use up more spots in the 100-number set. However, the pairs formed by these additional numbers (5-10, 5-15, 10-20, 10-30, 15-30, 15-45, etc.) might contribute more pairs than the grid structure.Wait, but in the grid structure, each number can form two pairs (if it&#39;s not on the edge). However, in these additional chains, numbers like 5 can form two pairs (10 and15), 10 can form two pairs (20 and30), 15 can form two pairs (30 and45), etc. So, each number in such a chain can also form two pairs, similar to the grid. However, the problem is that starting a new chain with a different prime factor requires using numbers that are not in the grid, thus reducing the number of numbers we can include in the grid.For example, if we include 5,10,15,20,... each of these takes a spot that could have been used for a number in the grid. However, whether the total number of pairs increases or not depends on whether these new chains contribute more pairs than the grid numbers they replace.Suppose we replace one number in the grid with 5. Then, we can add 10 and15, but 10 and15 would need to replace two more numbers in the grid. Then, the number of pairs contributed by 5,10,15 would be 2 (from5: 10,15) + 2 (from10:20,30) + 2 (from15:30,45) etc., but each subsequent number also needs to be added, replacing a grid number. However, each addition after 5 requires replacing a grid number, so the net gain in pairs needs to be compared to the loss from the grid.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s better to stay with the grid structure because each number in the grid can contribute two pairs (if not on the edge), whereas numbers in other chains would also contribute two pairs, but since the grid is more efficient in packing numbers (as they share the same prime factors), perhaps the grid allows more numbers to be close together, thus maximizing the number of pairs.Alternatively, if we use numbers outside the grid, we might be able to create overlapping pairs, but due to unique factorization, this isn&#39;t possible. For example, if we have both 6 (from the grid) and 10 (from a 5-chain), they don&#39;t form a pair because their ratio is 6/10=0.6, which is not 2 or 3. Similarly, 10 and15 have a ratio of 1.5, which is not 2 or3. Therefore, these numbers don&#39;t form additional pairs outside their own chains. Therefore, each chain is separate, and the pairs are only within the chain.Therefore, each chain, whether part of the grid or a separate prime chain, contributes the same number of pairs per number. However, starting a new chain requires using numbers that are larger (since they include additional primes) and thus might limit the depth of the chain due to the 100-number limit. On the other hand, the grid uses numbers that are as small as possible (only 2s and 3s), allowing for longer chains.For example, the grid starting at1 can include numbers up to 2^9 *3^9, which is a very large number, but since we are allowed any positive integers, regardless of size, the actual magnitude doesn&#39;t matter, only the count. Therefore, the grid allows us to fit 100 numbers in a 10x10 grid, each connected to two others (except edges), giving 180 pairs. If we try to make separate chains, each chain would start at a different prime, but each such chain would require more numbers to reach the same depth, leading to fewer total pairs.For example, if we make a chain starting at5: 5,10,20,40,... (multiplying by2 each time) and 5,15,45,135,... (multiplying by3 each time). Each such chain would have a structure similar to the grid, but with higher numbers. However, to get 100 numbers, we would need multiple such chains, each contributing fewer pairs because they are shorter (due to starting from a higher base). For example, the chain starting at5 would have numbers like5,10,15,20,30, etc., but each additional number in the chain takes up a spot that could have been used in the main grid. Since the main grid is more efficient in packing pairs, it&#39;s likely better to use the grid.Therefore, my current conclusion is that the grid structure of numbers 2^a *3^b for a,b from0 to9 gives 100 numbers with 180 good pairs, and this is the maximum possible.However, to verify this, let&#39;s consider whether there&#39;s a way to structure the numbers such that some numbers can be part of more than two pairs. For example, if a number x is such that x/2, x/3, 2x, and3x are all in the set. However, due to unique factorization, x can only have one predecessor in terms of division by2 and one predecessor in division by3. Similarly, x can have multiple successors (2x,3x), but each successor is unique.Wait, but in terms of pairs, if x is in the middle of the grid, then it can pair with x/2, x/3, 2x, and3x. Wait, but x can pair with x/2 (if x/2 is in the set) and x/3 (if x/3 is in the set), as well as 2x and3x (if they are in the set). However, in the grid structure, for a number x=2^a *3^b where a&gt;0 and b&gt;0, x/2=2^(a-1)*3^b and x/3=2^a *3^(b-1) are both in the set. Similarly, 2x and3x are in the set if a&lt;9 and b&lt;9. Therefore, in the middle of the grid, each number x is part of four pairs: {x/2, x}, {x/3, x}, {x, 2x}, {x, 3x}. However, when we count the total number of pairs, we have to consider that each pair is counted once. For example, the pair {x, 2x} is counted when we consider x as the smaller number, and {x/2, x} is counted when considering x/2 as the smaller number. Similarly for the other pairs.But in the total count, how does this work? The total number of good pairs is equal to the number of pairs where the ratio is2 or3. So, for each number x in the set, if 2x is also in the set, that&#39;s a pair. If3x is also in the set, that&#39;s another pair. Therefore, the count is over all x where2x or3x are present. So, in the grid structure, for numbers not on the top row (a&lt;9), 2x is present, and for numbers not on the rightmost column (b&lt;9),3x is present. So each non-boundary number contributes two pairs, and each boundary number contributes one or zero.However, in reality, the total number of pairs with ratio2 is equal to the number of numbers x where2x is also in the set. In the grid, that&#39;s all x with a&lt;9, so 9*10=90. Similarly, pairs with ratio3 is all x with b&lt;9, so 9*10=90. Total 180.But if we have a number x in the set such that both x/2 and x/3 are in the set, does that affect the count? No, because x/2 and x/3 are smaller numbers, and their pairs would have been counted when considering x/2 and x/3 as the smaller numbers. For example, if x is in the set, and x/2 is also in the set, then the pair {x/2, x} is counted when we look at x/2 and see that 2*(x/2)=x is in the set. Similarly, if x/3 is in the set, the pair {x/3, x} is counted when considering x/3.Therefore, the total count only depends on the number of numbers x for which2x or3x are in the set. So, to maximize this count, we need as many numbers as possible to have their doubles and triples present.Therefore, arranging the numbers in the grid allows for 90+90=180 pairs. If we deviate from the grid, say by including numbers not of the form2^a *3^b, we might not be able to have as many numbers with their doubles and triples present, because those numbers would be unique and would require their own chains, which might be shorter, leading to fewer pairs.For example, suppose we remove one number from the grid and add a new number, say5. Then, to form pairs with5, we need to add10 and15. But10 and15 would replace two more numbers in the grid. So now we&#39;ve removed three numbers from the grid and added three new numbers (5,10,15). The pairs contributed by these new numbers would be {5,10}, {5,15}, {10,20} (if20 is still present), {15,30} (if30 is still present). However, if20 and30 were part of the original grid, removing them would lose the pairs {10,20} and {15,30}, but if they are kept, then20 and30 are still in the set. Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s assume we take out three numbers from the grid (say, three numbers that were on the boundary, contributing only one pair each), and replace them with5,10,15. The pairs lost would be three pairs (one from each removed number). The pairs gained would be {5,10}, {5,15}, {10,20}, {15,30}, assuming20 and30 are still in the grid. So net gain of one pair (5-10,5-15) but loss of three pairs. Therefore, net loss of two pairs. Hence, this replacement would decrease the total number of pairs.Alternatively, if we remove numbers that don&#39;t contribute many pairs. For example, numbers on the top boundary (a=9) can&#39;t form pairs with ratio2, and numbers on the right boundary (b=9) can&#39;t form pairs with ratio3. So, removing a top boundary number (which can only contribute to a ratio3 pair if b&lt;9) and a right boundary number (which can only contribute to a ratio2 pair if a&lt;9). If we remove such numbers and replace them with a new chain, maybe we can break even or gain.Suppose we remove two boundary numbers: one from the top (a=9, b=0) which can only pair via ratio3 (but b=0, so 3x would be 3*2^9*3^0=2^9*3^1, which is in the grid at (9,1), so actually, even the top boundary numbers (a=9) can pair via ratio3 if b&lt;9. Similarly, right boundary numbers (b=9) can pair via ratio2 if a&lt;9. So, all numbers except the top-right corner (a=9,b=9) can form at least one pair. The corner can&#39;t form any pairs.Therefore, removing a top boundary number (a=9, b) where b&lt;9: such a number can form a ratio3 pair (with 3x). If we remove it, we lose one pair. Similarly, removing a right boundary number (a, b=9) where a&lt;9: such a number can form a ratio2 pair (with 2x), so removing it also loses one pair. The corner (a=9,b=9) can&#39;t form any pairs, so removing it doesn&#39;t lose any.Therefore, replacing a top or right boundary number (which contribute one pair each) with a new number that can form two pairs might be beneficial. For example, remove one boundary number (losing one pair) and add a new number that forms two pairs. But to form two pairs, the new number needs to have both2x and3x in the set. However, if the new number is5, then 10 and15 need to be in the set. If10 and15 are already in the grid, then adding5 allows pairs {5,10} and {5,15}, but10 and15 are already part of other pairs. Therefore, adding5 increases the total pairs by2, but removing a boundary number decreases by1, so net gain of1. However, we also have to remove another number to add5, since we need to keep the total at100. Wait, no: if we remove one number and add one number, the total remains100. So, remove one boundary number (losing one pair) and add5 (which can form two pairs if10 and15 are present). If10 and15 are already present, then adding5 gives two new pairs. Therefore, net gain of1 pair. However, if10 and15 were not already present, we would have to add them as well, which would require removing more numbers.But in the grid structure, 10 is 2*5, but5 is not in the grid. Wait, no. In the grid structure, numbers are of the form2^a *3^b. So, 10 is not in the grid unless a=1 and b=0, which is2. Similarly,15 is3*5, which is not in the grid. Therefore, if we want to add5,10,15, these numbers are not in the original grid, so we have to add them by removing existing grid numbers. So, to add5, we remove one grid number. Then, to add10 and15, we have to remove two more grid numbers. Therefore, total removed:3, added:3. The pairs gained are {5,10}, {5,15}, {10,20}, {15,30} (if20 and30 are still present). But20 and30 are in the grid, so they were already paired with10 and15 (original grid numbers, which were 2^2*3^0=4 and2^1*3^1=6). Wait, no. Original grid numbers:For example, the original grid has10 =2^1*3^0*5^0? No, wait, the original grid numbers are only multiples of2 and3. So, 10=2*5 is not in the grid. Therefore, in the original grid, numbers like10 and15 are not present. Therefore, if we remove three grid numbers (say, three numbers from the top-right corner which don&#39;t form many pairs) and add5,10,15, we can form new pairs:-5 pairs with10 and15.-10 pairs with20 and30 (but20 and30 are in the grid only if they are of the form2^a *3^b. 20=2^2*5, which is not in the grid. 30=2*3*5, also not in the grid. Therefore, to have10 pair with20 and30, we need to add20 and30 as well, which requires removing more numbers. This becomes a chain reaction where adding a new prime requires expanding the chain, which uses up more numbers but doesn&#39;t necessarily result in a net gain of pairs.Therefore, it&#39;s clear that deviating from the grid structure by introducing new primes actually reduces the total number of pairs because the new chains require more numbers to be added (each new number in the chain replaces a grid number that could have been part of two pairs). Therefore, the grid structure remains optimal.Therefore, the maximum number of good pairs is achieved by the grid of numbers2^a *3^b for0 &lt;=a, b &lt;=9, resulting in90 +90=180 good pairs.However, just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a different arrangement within the grid that allows more pairs. For example, what if we don&#39;t use a rectangle but a different shape in the grid.Suppose we arrange the grid in a different way, say a triangle or a different polygon, to maximize the number of non-boundary nodes. However, in a grid of numbers, the exponents a and b have to be non-negative integers, so the grid is necessarily a rectangle in the (a, b) plane. Any other shape would either leave gaps or have overlaps, but since we need exactly100 numbers, the rectangle is the most efficient.Alternatively, using a three-dimensional grid with primes2,3,5, but that would spread the numbers even thinner, requiring more numbers to be used for the same number of pairs, thus reducing efficiency.Therefore, after considering various possibilities, I conclude that the maximum number of good pairs is180, achieved by the10x10 grid of numbers2^a *3^b, resulting in90 pairs with ratio2 and90 pairs with ratio3.Final Answerboxed{180}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of good pairs formed by 100 different positive integers, where a good pair is defined as a pair with a ratio of either 2 or 3, we need to consider the structure of the numbers. A good pair (i, j) occurs when one number is either double or triple the other. To maximize the number of such pairs, we can arrange the numbers in the form of a grid where each number is a product of powers of 2 and 3. Specifically, we consider numbers of the form (2^a cdot 3^b) where (a) and (b) are non-negative integers.By structuring the numbers in a 10x10 grid (i.e., (0 leq a, b leq 9)), we ensure that each number can potentially form pairs with its double (by increasing (a) or (b) by 1) or triple (by increasing (b) by 1). This structure allows each number (except those on the boundaries) to form two pairs: one with its double and one with its triple.For a grid of size (10 times 10) (100 numbers), the number of good pairs is calculated as follows:- Each number in the grid (except those in the last column) can form a pair with its double (ratio 2), resulting in (9 times 10 = 90) pairs.- Each number in the grid (except those in the last row) can form a pair with its triple (ratio 3), resulting in (10 times 9 = 90) pairs.Summing these, we get the total number of good pairs:[90 + 90 = 180]Thus, the maximum number of good pairs that these 100 numbers can form is (boxed{180}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of good pairs from 100 different positive integers. A good pair is defined as two numbers where one is either double or triple the other. The numbers can be used in multiple pairs, so each number can pair with others as long as the ratio condition is met.First, let me understand the problem. Each good pair is either (a, 2a) or (a, 3a). So, for each number a in the set, if 2a is also in the set, then (a, 2a) is a good pair. Similarly, if 3a is in the set, then (a, 3a) is another good pair. Therefore, for each number, there are potentially two good pairs: one with its double and one with its triple. However, we have to ensure that both numbers in each pair are present in the set.Since the numbers are all different positive integers, we need to arrange the numbers in such a way that maximizes the number of these pairs. The challenge is to choose 100 numbers where as many numbers as possible have their doubles or triples also present in the set.Let me think about how to structure such a set. If I can arrange the numbers in chains where each number is followed by its double or triple, then each number in the chain (except the last one) can form a good pair with the next number. For example, a chain like a, 2a, 4a, 8a... would have pairs (a,2a), (2a,4a), (4a,8a), etc. Similarly, a chain like a, 3a, 9a, 27a... would have pairs (a,3a), (3a,9a), etc.However, if I use only multiplication by 2 or only by 3, the chains would be linear and probably not optimal. Maybe a combination of both multiplications would create more connections and thus more pairs. But how exactly?Alternatively, maybe structuring the numbers in a tree-like structure where each number can have both a &quot;child&quot; by multiplying by 2 and another &quot;child&quot; by multiplying by 3. However, the problem is that such a tree would quickly generate numbers that are too large, and since we have only 100 numbers, we can&#39;t have too many branches. Also, numbers can&#39;t repeat, so each number must be unique.Wait, perhaps the optimal structure is similar to a grid or a graph where numbers are connected via multiplications by 2 and 3. For example, starting from some base number, you can multiply by 2 or 3 to get new numbers. This might form a grid of numbers where each number is of the form 2^x * 3^y. If we arrange numbers in such a way, each number can have up to two &quot;parents&quot; (divided by 2 or 3) and two &quot;children&quot; (multiplied by 2 or 3). However, since we need different numbers, we need to manage exponents x and y such that all numbers are unique.This seems like a good approach. If we model the numbers as 2^x * 3^y, where x and y are non-negative integers, then each number can generate two children (multiplying by 2 or 3) and can be generated by two parents (dividing by 2 or 3, if possible). However, the numbers have to be distinct, so each combination of x and y must be unique. So, the set of numbers would be all numbers of the form 2^x * 3^y for certain exponents x and y. The question is, how to choose 100 such numbers such that the number of pairs (where one is double or triple the other) is maximized.Alternatively, maybe instead of a grid, a more linear structure could be better. Let me think. If we have a chain where each step is either multiplying by 2 or 3, but we can choose which one to maximize the number of pairs. But arranging 100 numbers in such a way is complicated.Wait, maybe if we arrange the numbers in a graph where each node has both a 2-edge and a 3-edge to another node, then the number of edges (which correspond to good pairs) would be maximized. But in such a graph, each node can have up to two outgoing edges (multiplying by 2 and 3) and up to two incoming edges (divided by 2 and 3). However, since we need to have 100 nodes, the problem becomes how to arrange these nodes such that as many edges as possible are present.But perhaps an optimal configuration is similar to a grid where x and y exponents are arranged such that the product 2^x * 3^y covers a range of exponents where both x and y are varied. Let&#39;s explore this idea.Suppose we choose numbers of the form 2^a * 3^b where a and b are non-negative integers. Each such number can be connected to 2^{a+1} * 3^b (if present) and 2^a * 3^{b+1} (if present). So, if we have numbers in a grid-like structure where we can move right (multiply by 2) or up (multiply by 3), then each number (except those on the rightmost column or top row) can form two pairs. However, the total number of pairs would be the number of rightward edges plus the number of upward edges.To maximize the number of edges (pairs), we need to arrange the grid such that the number of edges is maximized. For a grid with m rows and n columns, the number of rightward edges is m*(n-1) and the number of upward edges is n*(m-1). So the total number of edges is m*(n-1) + n*(m-1) = 2mn - m - n. But we need the total number of nodes (numbers) to be 100. So mn = 100. Then the total edges would be 2*100 - m - n. To maximize this, we need to minimize m + n. Since m and n are positive integers such that mn = 100, the minimal m + n is achieved when m and n are as close as possible. For 100, the factors closest to each other are 10 and 10. So m = n = 10. Then total edges would be 200 - 10 -10 = 180.But wait, this is assuming a perfect grid where all numbers are present. However, numbers in such a grid would be 2^a * 3^b where 0 ≤ a ≤ 9 and 0 ≤ b ≤ 9. But the numbers must be different positive integers. Each 2^a * 3^b is unique, so that works. The total numbers would be 10*10=100. So this seems feasible.But in this grid, each node (except those on the top row and rightmost column) can form two pairs: one by multiplying by 2 and one by multiplying by 3. The pairs would be (2^a * 3^b, 2^{a+1} * 3^b) and (2^a * 3^b, 2^a * 3^{b+1}). The total number of such pairs would indeed be 10*9 + 10*9 = 90 + 90 = 180. Wait, but according to the previous formula, 2mn - m -n, with m = n =10, gives 200 -10 -10=180. So that&#39;s consistent.But is this the maximum possible? Let&#39;s check for other factor pairs. For example, if m = 20, n =5, then total edges would be 2*100 -20 -5= 175, which is less than 180. Similarly, m=25, n=4: 200 -25 -4=171. So indeed, the maximum occurs when m and n are as close as possible.But is there a better arrangement? Because in this grid arrangement, all numbers are connected via multiplication by 2 or 3, but maybe there&#39;s a different arrangement where some numbers can be part of more pairs? For example, a number that is both double of one number and triple of another. Wait, in the grid arrangement, such numbers do exist. For instance, 6 = 2*3, which can be represented as 2^1*3^1. It can be obtained by multiplying 3 by 2 or 2 by 3. So in the grid, this number is connected to both 3 (2^0*3^1) and 2 (2^1*3^0). But in the grid structure, each number is connected only to its right and upper neighbor. So in the grid, 6 is connected to 12 (2^2*3^1) and 18 (2^1*3^2). However, 6 is also the result of 3*2 and 2*3, but in the grid, 6&#39;s predecessors are 3 (from the left) and 2 (from below). Wait, perhaps I need to visualize this.Wait, in the grid, moving right increases the exponent of 2, and moving up increases the exponent of 3. So starting from 1 (2^0*3^0), moving right gives 2, 4, 8,... and moving up gives 3, 9, 27,... Then, the number 6 is at position (1,1), which is 2^1*3^1. To reach 6, you can go right from 3 (2^0*3^1) to 6, or up from 2 (2^1*3^0) to 6. Therefore, in this grid, each number (except those on the leftmost column and bottom row) has two incoming edges. But in terms of outgoing edges, each number (except those on the top row and rightmost column) has two outgoing edges. Therefore, the total number of edges (good pairs) is 180.But in this case, the number of good pairs is 180. However, perhaps there&#39;s a way to have more pairs by overlapping chains or something? Let me think.Suppose instead of a grid, we arrange numbers in a way that some numbers can be part of both a 2-chain and a 3-chain. For example, if we have a number that is part of both a chain multiplying by 2 and a chain multiplying by 3. But in the grid structure, this is already happening. For example, 6 is part of the chain 3 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 24... (multiplying by 2) and also part of the chain 2 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 18 -&gt; 54... (multiplying by 3). So in the grid, each number (except those on edges) is part of two chains.Alternatively, maybe if we have numbers that can be reached by multiple paths, we can create more connections. But in the grid structure, each number is uniquely determined by its exponents of 2 and 3, so each number is only reachable by one path from the starting number. Wait, no. For example, 6 can be reached by 3*2 or 2*3, but in the grid structure, these correspond to different paths. However, in terms of edges, each edge is either a multiplication by 2 or 3, so the edges are unique.But in terms of pairs, the pairs are defined by the edges. So each edge is a pair (a, 2a) or (a, 3a). Therefore, the grid structure with 10x10 gives 180 such edges. Is this the maximum?Alternatively, maybe if we arrange numbers not in a grid, but in a denser structure where some numbers can have both 2x and 3x multiples present more often. Wait, but in the grid, each number (except those on the rightmost column and top row) already has both 2x and 3x multiples present. For example, 6 has 12 and 18. So if we have the entire grid, we can have each number connected to two others. But if we deviate from the grid, perhaps by having some numbers not following the grid structure, maybe we can have more connections.Wait, but how? If we have a number that is not of the form 2^x * 3^y, then it might not have both 2x and 3x in the set. For example, suppose we include 5. Then unless 10 or 15 are in the set, 5 can&#39;t form a good pair. But if we include 10 and 15, then we can have pairs (5,10) and (5,15). But then 10 and 15 would need their own pairs. However, this might require adding more numbers, which could be outside the grid. But the problem is that we are restricted to 100 numbers. So perhaps replacing some numbers in the grid with others that can form more connections.But maybe it&#39;s better to stick with numbers of the form 2^x * 3^y because they can be part of two chains (doubling and tripling). If we use other numbers, like 5, they can only form pairs if their doubles or triples are present, but those doubles or triples (10, 15) can&#39;t be part of as many pairs because they might not have further multiples. For example, 10 can be part of (10, 20) and (10, 30), but if 20 and 30 are not in the set, then 10 can only form one pair. But if we include 20 and 30, we need to use more numbers, which could have been used for other pairs.Alternatively, maybe the grid structure is indeed the optimal because each number (except those on the edges) can form two pairs. So in a 10x10 grid, we have 100 numbers, each in the middle can form two pairs, and the ones on the edges form one pair, and the corners form none. Wait, no. Let&#39;s calculate again.In the grid, for exponents a from 0 to 9 and b from 0 to 9, each number can have a right neighbor (a+1, b) if a+1 &lt;=9 and an upper neighbor (a, b+1) if b+1 &lt;=9. So for each number:- If a &lt;9 and b &lt;9: it can form two pairs (right and upper). There are 9*9=81 such numbers.- If a=9 and b &lt;9: it can only form an upper pair. There are 1*9=9 such numbers.- If a &lt;9 and b=9: it can only form a right pair. There are 9*1=9 such numbers.- If a=9 and b=9: it can&#39;t form any pair. There&#39;s 1 such number.Therefore, total pairs:- 81 numbers * 2 pairs = 162- 9 numbers *1 pair =9- 9 numbers *1 pair =9Total pairs: 162 +9 +9=180. So yes, 180 pairs.But in this case, each pair is either (2^a*3^b, 2^{a+1}*3^b) or (2^a*3^b, 2^a*3^{b+1}).But maybe if we arrange numbers not on a grid but in another structure where some numbers can have more than two pairs?Wait, is that possible? For a number to be part of more than two pairs, it would need to have multiple predecessors or successors. For example, if a number x can be obtained by multiplying two different numbers by 2 or 3. For instance, if x = 2a = 3b, then x can be part of two pairs: (a, x) and (b, x). Similarly, if x can be multiplied by 2 and 3 to get two different numbers, then x can form two outgoing pairs. But in the grid structure, each number can have at most two outgoing pairs (right and up) and two incoming pairs (left and down). But in the grid, the numbers on the edges have fewer.However, if a number is in the middle of the grid, it can have both a right and up pair, so two outgoing pairs. But if we have a number that is, say, part of multiple chains, maybe it can have more than two outgoing pairs? For example, suppose x is part of both a 2-chain and a 3-chain, but also another chain via a different multiple. Wait, but if x is in the grid, it can only be multiplied by 2 or 3. So unless we introduce other factors, which we can&#39;t because we can only use 2 and 3. So, actually, each number can have at most two outgoing pairs (multiplying by 2 and 3) and at most two incoming pairs (dividing by 2 and 3). Therefore, in terms of outgoing edges, the maximum per number is two. Therefore, if we have a structure where as many numbers as possible have both outgoing edges, then the total number of pairs is maximized.In the grid structure, 81 numbers have both outgoing edges, 18 numbers have one outgoing edge, and 1 has none. So total edges (pairs) is 81*2 +18*1= 162 +18=180.If we can find a structure where more numbers have two outgoing edges, then the total number of pairs would be higher. But is that possible?Alternatively, maybe arranging numbers in a different structure where the numbers are not restricted to a grid, allowing some numbers to have two outgoing edges even if they are on the &quot;edges&quot; in some sense.Wait, for example, suppose we have a tree where each node can branch into two children (multiplying by 2 and 3). But such a tree would have exponential growth, so we can&#39;t have too many layers. However, with 100 numbers, maybe we can have multiple such trees. But the problem is that numbers can&#39;t overlap. Each number must be unique.Alternatively, maybe combining multiple small grids. But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, but let&#39;s think differently. Suppose that each number can be connected via multiplying by 2 or 3. The problem is equivalent to building a graph where nodes are numbers and edges are multiplications by 2 or 3. The question is, what graph with 100 nodes has the maximum number of edges where each edge is a multiplication by 2 or 3. To maximize the number of edges, we need as many pairs (a, 2a) or (a, 3a) as possible.Each edge is directed, from a to 2a or 3a. But since the numbers must be present in the set, we can have edges only if both numbers are in the set.Alternatively, if we model this as an undirected graph, where an edge exists between a and 2a or 3a, then we need to maximize the number of edges. But in this case, each edge is between two numbers where one is double or triple the other.In such a graph, each number can be connected to at most two numbers: one half (if it&#39;s even) or one third (if it&#39;s divisible by 3), and one double or triple. Wait, no. For example, a number a can be connected to 2a and 3a (if present), and also to a/2 (if a is even and a/2 is present) and a/3 (if a is divisible by 3 and a/3 is present). So each node can have up to four connections. However, in the grid structure, each node is connected to two higher nodes (2a and 3a) and two lower nodes (a/2 and a/3), but in the grid as we considered before, we only count the connections to higher nodes (edges going from a to 2a and a to 3a). So if we consider the undirected graph, the number of edges is the same as the directed edges counted earlier, but each undirected edge is counted once. However, in our problem, a pair [i] is unordered? Wait, the problem says &quot;a pair of numbers is good if the ratio is either 2 or 3&quot;. So the pair (a, 2a) is the same as (2a, a). So pairs are unordered. Therefore, each edge in the undirected graph corresponds to a good pair.Therefore, in the grid structure, the number of undirected edges is the same as the number of directed edges divided by 2? Wait, no. Because each undirected edge is counted once, regardless of direction. So in the grid, if we have edges from a to 2a and a to 3a, then each of these is a directed edge, but the undirected edge is just the pair {a, 2a} or {a, 3a}. Therefore, the total number of undirected edges (good pairs) is equal to the number of directed edges, because each directed edge corresponds to a unique pair. For example, the pair (a, 2a) is considered once, and (2a, a) would be the same pair but in reverse, but since the ratio is 2 or 1/2, but the problem says the ratio is either 2 or 3, so actually, the pair (2a, a) would have a ratio of 1/2, which is not allowed. Wait, the problem says the ratio is either 2 or 3. So the pair must be such that one is double or triple the other. So the pair (a, 2a) is allowed because 2a/a = 2, and (2a, a) is not considered a separate pair, but actually, since the pair is unordered, {a, 2a} is the same as {2a, a}, and the ratio is 2 either way. Wait, no. If you have two numbers a and b, then the pair is good if either a/b = 2 or 3, or b/a =2 or3. So the pair {a, b} is good if one is double or triple the other. Therefore, the pair is unordered, and the ratio can be 2, 3, 1/2, or 1/3. But the problem statement says &quot;the ratio of these numbers is either 2 or 3&quot;. Wait, let me check the original problem statement.The problem says: &quot;a pair of numbers is good if the ratio of these numbers is either 2 or 3&quot;. So the ratio, regardless of order, must be exactly 2 or 3. Therefore, if the ratio is 1/2 or 1/3, that doesn&#39;t count. Wait, but ratio is defined as the larger number divided by the smaller one, right? Because otherwise, the ratio could be either way. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify. Hmm, this is ambiguous.Wait, let&#39;s re-read the problem statement: &quot;a pair of numbers [i]good[/i] if the ratio of these numbers is either 2 or 3&quot;. So it says the ratio is either 2 or 3. If we take the ratio as the larger number divided by the smaller one, then any pair where one is double or triple the other is good. So both (a, 2a) and (2a, a) would be considered the same pair, and the ratio is 2. Similarly, (a, 3a) would be ratio 3. Therefore, in this case, each such pair is counted once, and the direction doesn&#39;t matter. Therefore, in terms of graph theory, it&#39;s an undirected graph where edges connect numbers with ratio 2 or 3. Therefore, the number of edges (good pairs) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {a, b} where b =2a or 3a.Therefore, in the grid structure, how many such pairs do we have? For each number a =2^x *3^y, if 2a is in the set, then {a, 2a} is a good pair. Similarly, if 3a is in the set, {a, 3a} is a good pair. In the 10x10 grid, 2a is in the set if x+1 &lt;=9, and 3a is in the set if y+1 &lt;=9. Therefore, for each a, we can have up to two edges. The total number of edges is the same as calculated before: 180. Because for each of the 100 numbers, we check if 2a and 3a are present. For numbers where x &lt;9, 2a is present; there are 10*10 numbers, and for each x from 0 to 8 (9 values), y from 0 to9, so 9*10=90 numbers have 2a present. Similarly, for y &lt;9, 3a is present; x from0 to9, y from0 to8, 9*10=90 numbers. Therefore, total pairs: 90 (for ratio 2) +90 (for ratio 3)=180.Therefore, the grid gives 180 good pairs. But is this the maximum?Suppose we have another structure where some numbers can be part of multiple pairs beyond the grid structure. For example, if a number is part of both a 2-chain and a 3-chain, but also connects to another number via a different multiple. Wait, but how?Let me consider an example. Suppose we have the number 6. In the grid, 6 is connected to 12 (2*6) and 18 (3*6). But if we also include 4, then 6 can be connected to 12 (2*6), 18 (3*6), and also 6 is connected to 3 (6/2=3) and 2 (6/3=2). However, in the grid, if we have 2 and 3, then 6 can be connected to 2 and 3 as predecessors. But those connections are from 2 and 3 to 6, not from 6 to them. So in the undirected graph, {6, 12}, {6, 18}, {6, 3}, {6, 2} are all edges. But in the grid structure, all those edges are present if 2, 3, 12, 18 are in the set. However, in the grid, 2 is 2^1*3^0, 3 is 2^0*3^1, 6 is 2^1*3^1, 12 is 2^2*3^1, 18 is 2^1*3^2. So all these numbers are included in the grid. Therefore, the edge {6, 2} and {6, 3} are present in the grid. But in terms of the pairs, those are considered as well. Wait, but in our previous calculation, we considered only the edges where a number is multiplied by 2 or 3. But if we include the edges where a number is divided by 2 or 3, then the total number of edges would be double? Wait, no. Because in the undirected graph, the edge {a, 2a} is the same whether you go from a to 2a or vice versa. Therefore, the total number of edges is the number of such unordered pairs.But in the grid structure, the edges are {a, 2a} and {a, 3a} for each a where 2a or 3a is present. Therefore, if we consider all such pairs, including both directions, but as unordered pairs, then the total number is still 180. However, if we also include pairs where a number is half or third of another, which are already included in the pairs. For example, {2, 6} is the same as {6, 2}, which is already counted when considering the pair {2, 6} because 6=3*2. Therefore, in the grid structure, all possible pairs where one is double or triple of another are already included. So in the grid, we have 180 such pairs.Wait, but hold on. If the grid includes numbers from 2^0*3^0 up to 2^9*3^9, but actually, no. Wait, in the 10x10 grid, the exponents go from a=0 to9 and b=0 to9. So the numbers are 2^a*3^b where 0 ≤a,b ≤9. The maximum number is 2^9*3^9. However, in such a grid, for each number, if you divide by 2 or 3, you might get a number that&#39;s also in the grid. For example, 6=2*3. Dividing 6 by 2 gives 3, which is in the grid; dividing by 3 gives 2, which is also in the grid. Similarly, 12=2^2*3^1, dividing by 2 gives 6, which is in the grid, etc. Therefore, in the grid structure, each number (except those on the leftmost column and bottom row) can form two incoming pairs. But in terms of undirected pairs, those are already counted when we considered the smaller number. For example, the pair {3,6} is already counted when we considered 3&#39;s multiples. Therefore, in the grid, the total number of pairs is indeed 180, as each edge is only counted once.So perhaps the grid structure gives 180 pairs. But is there a way to have more than 180 pairs?Let me think of another structure. Suppose we have multiple chains of numbers where each chain is a sequence multiplying by 2 and 3 alternately. For example, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 72,... This way, each number (except the first) is either double or triple the previous one. However, such a chain would have each number connected to the next one, but each number (except the first and last) is part of two pairs. However, the problem is that such a chain would require numbers to grow exponentially, and we need 100 numbers. If we have multiple chains, we can distribute the numbers to have more connections.Alternatively, if we use numbers that can be part of multiple chains. For example, the number 6 can be part of both a chain from 1 -&gt;3 -&gt;6 and from 1 -&gt;2 -&gt;6. Then, 6 can form pairs with 3, 2, 12, and 18. But in the grid structure, this is already the case. So maybe the grid is indeed the optimal.But wait, in the grid, each number can be connected to two higher numbers (multiplying by 2 and 3) and two lower numbers (dividing by 2 and 3), but when considering undirected pairs, each number can have up to four connections. For example, 6 is connected to 3, 2, 12, and 18. However, in the grid structure, we only count the pairs {6,12} and {6,18}, because we are starting from the lower numbers and moving up. Wait, no. Actually, in the undirected graph, all pairs where one is double or triple the other are counted, regardless of direction. Therefore, in the grid, if we have both the lower and higher numbers, all possible pairs are included. So for the number 6, the pairs {6,3}, {6,2}, {6,12}, {6,18} are all present if those numbers are in the set. Therefore, in the grid, each number not on the edges would have four connections. Wait, but in our previous calculation, we only got 180 pairs. Let&#39;s check again.Take the grid with exponents a and b from 0 to9. Each number 2^a*3^b can form pairs with:- 2^{a+1}*3^b (if a+1 &lt;=9)- 2^{a-1}*3^b (if a-1 &gt;=0)- 2^a*3^{b+1} (if b+1 &lt;=9)- 2^a*3^{b-1} (if b-1 &gt;=0)Therefore, each number can have up to four neighbors. However, in the undirected graph, each edge is counted once. So the total number of edges would be:For each a from 0 to9 and b from0 to9:- If a &lt;9, there is an edge to 2^{a+1}*3^b- If b &lt;9, there is an edge to 2^a*3^{b+1}Therefore, total edges:- For a &lt;9: 10*9=90 edges (since for each a from0 to8, 10 values of b)- For b &lt;9: 10*9=90 edges (since for each b from0 to8, 10 values of a)Total edges: 90 +90=180. So even though each number in the middle has four neighbors, the total number of edges is still 180 because each edge is counted once. For example, the edge between 6 and 3 is counted when we consider the number 3 and its neighbor 6 (since 6=3*2). Similarly, the edge between 6 and 2 is counted when we consider the number 2 and its neighbor 6 (6=2*3). Therefore, all edges are captured by considering the lower number and its neighbors obtained by multiplying by 2 or 3. Hence, the total is 180.But wait, if we consider all possible edges (including both directions), why isn&#39;t the total number of edges higher? Because for each edge, say between a and 2a, it&#39;s only counted once when we consider the lower number a. Similarly, the edge between a and 3a is counted once when considering a. Therefore, the total is indeed 90 +90=180.But if we arrange the numbers in a different structure where some numbers can be connected to more than two others via ratio 2 or 3, then we might have more edges. However, in order for a number to be connected to more than two others, it needs to be part of multiple ratios. For example, a number x can be connected to x/2, x/3, 2x, and 3x. But x can only have these connections if those numbers are present in the set.However, in the grid structure, we already have x connected to 2x and 3x (if present), and the connections to x/2 and x/3 are present if those numbers are in the set. But in the grid, x/2 and x/3 are present if x is divisible by 2 or 3 and the exponents are within range. Therefore, in the grid, each number can have up to four connections, but the total number of edges is still 180.Wait, but if we have a different structure where numbers can have more connections, maybe we can get more edges. For example, consider numbers that are products of 2 and 3 in different exponents, but arranged in a way that allows more connections. However, it&#39;s not clear how.Alternatively, if we use numbers that are not of the form 2^a*3^b, but include numbers that can be part of multiple chains. For example, suppose we include 12, which can be connected to 6 (12/2), 4 (12/3), 24 (12*2), and 36 (12*3). If all these numbers are present, then 12 is part of four pairs. However, to include 12, 6, 4, 24, and 36, we need to have those numbers in the set. If we replace some numbers in the grid with these, but the grid already includes these numbers. In the grid, 4 is 2^2*3^0, 6 is 2^1*3^1, 12 is 2^2*3^1, 24 is 2^3*3^1, and 36 is 2^2*3^2. So they are already present in the grid, and 12 is connected to all four numbers. However, the total number of edges is still 180 because each edge is counted once. For example, the edge between 12 and 6 is counted when considering the number 6 and its neighbor 12=6*2. The edge between 12 and 4 is counted when considering 4 and its neighbor 12=4*3. The edges between 12 and 24 is counted when considering 12 and 24=12*2. The edge between 12 and 36 is counted when considering 12 and 36=12*3. Therefore, all four edges are already included in the grid count.Therefore, even though some numbers have four connections, the total edge count remains 180.So perhaps the grid structure is indeed optimal. But is there a mathematical way to confirm that 180 is the maximum?Let me consider that each number can be part of multiple pairs, but the total number of pairs is limited by the number of times a number can be connected via ratio 2 or 3. Let&#39;s model this as a graph problem where we need to maximize the number of edges in a graph with 100 nodes, where each edge connects two nodes with a ratio of 2 or 3.In graph theory, the maximum number of edges in a graph is C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. But here, the graph is constrained: edges can only exist between nodes where one is double or triple the other. Therefore, the structure is a union of two graphs: one where edges connect numbers with ratio 2, and another with ratio 3.To maximize the number of edges, we need to maximize both the number of edges with ratio 2 and the number of edges with ratio 3.Each edge with ratio 2 corresponds to a pair (a, 2a). Similarly for ratio 3. So the problem reduces to choosing a set S of 100 numbers such that the number of pairs (a, 2a) or (a, 3a) is maximized.To maximize this, we need as many numbers as possible to have their doubles and triples also present in the set. Each such number contributes one edge for each multiple present.Therefore, the total number of edges is equal to the number of numbers a in S such that 2a is also in S, plus the number of numbers a in S such that 3a is also in S.Let’s denote:- Let x be the number of numbers a in S where 2a is also in S.- Let y be the number of numbers a in S where 3a is also in S.Then the total number of good pairs is x + y.Our goal is to maximize x + y.Now, each time 2a is in S, it means that a must be such that a and 2a are both in S. Similarly for 3a.Therefore, x is equal to the number of pairs (a, 2a) in S, which is the same as the number of elements a in S such that 2a is also in S.Similarly, y is the number of pairs (a, 3a) in S.To maximize x + y, we need to arrange S such that as many as possible of its elements have both 2a and 3a present.But each time we include a number and its double or triple, we are using up two numbers for one edge. However, numbers can be part of multiple edges. For example, if we have a chain a, 2a, 4a, then a is part of (a, 2a), 2a is part of (2a, 4a), so each number (except the first and last) is part of two edges.Therefore, structuring the set S as multiple chains of doubling and tripling can maximize the number of edges. However, due to the constraint of unique numbers and the total count of 100, the grid structure seems to be efficient because it allows each number (except those on the edges) to participate in two edges.But is there a way to prove that the grid gives the maximum?Let’s consider that in the grid, each number (except those on the rightmost column and top row) is connected to two others (right and up). Therefore, each such number contributes two to the total edges. The total edges are 2*81 +1*18= 180 as before.If we have a different structure where some numbers are part of more than two edges, but this would require that those numbers have both 2a and 3a present, and additionally, a/2 or a/3 present. However, the connections from a/2 or a/3 are already counted in the total edges. For example, if a number is part of two outgoing edges (2a and 3a) and two incoming edges (a/2 and a/3), then those incoming edges are counted when considering the lower numbers.Therefore, the total number of edges is still x + y, where x is the number of pairs with ratio 2 and y the number with ratio 3. In the grid, x=90 and y=90, so x+y=180.Is it possible to have a structure where x + y &gt; 180? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we focus on maximizing one ratio, say 2, and then fill in the remaining numbers with ratio 3. However, if we maximize the number of pairs with ratio 2, we can create a chain like 1, 2, 4, 8,..., up to 2^n. However, such a chain would have n+1 numbers and n pairs. To have 100 numbers, we would need multiple chains. However, this approach would not utilize the ratio 3 and might result in fewer total pairs.Alternatively, if we create multiple chains for ratio 2 and ratio 3. For example, suppose we have k chains of doubling and l chains of tripling. The total number of numbers would be the sum of the lengths of all chains. The total number of pairs would be the sum over each chain of (length -1). However, since numbers cannot overlap between chains, this would require the chains to be disjoint. Therefore, the total number of pairs would be maximized when the chains are as long as possible. However, this is not efficient because the number of pairs per number is lower. For example, a chain of length m contributes (m-1) pairs. Therefore, the average number of pairs per number is (m-1)/m, which approaches 1 as m increases. However, in the grid structure, the average number of pairs per number is 180/100=1.8, which is higher.Therefore, the grid structure is more efficient because it allows numbers to be part of two pairs (on average).Another approach: consider the problem as a bipartite graph where one partition is the set S and the other partition is the set S, and edges connect a to 2a and a to 3a. But I&#39;m not sure if this helps.Alternatively, think in terms of degrees. In graph theory, the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges (for undirected graphs). However, in our case, each edge is counted once, regardless of direction. Wait, actually, in the undirected graph, each edge {a, 2a} contributes +1 to the degree of a and +1 to the degree of 2a. Therefore, the sum of degrees is twice the number of edges. Therefore, if we let d_i be the degree of number i, then sum_{i} d_i = 2 * (number of edges). To maximize the number of edges, we need to maximize sum_{i} d_i. However, each number can have degree at most 4 (connected to a/2, 2a, a/3, 3a). But in reality, degrees can be up to 4, but most numbers will have lower degrees.But in the grid structure, the average degree is 180*2 /100= 3.6. However, in reality, degrees vary. For example, numbers in the middle have degree 4 (connected to a/2, 2a, a/3, 3a), numbers on the edges have lower degrees. Let&#39;s calculate the degrees in the grid:Each number 2^a*3^b has:- Up to four neighbors: 2^{a±1}*3^b and 2^a*3^{b±1}, if within bounds.In the grid with a from0 to9 and b from0 to9:- Corner numbers (a=0,b=0): degree 2 (connected to 2 and 3).- Edge numbers (either a=0 or b=0 but not both):  - If a=0, b≠0,9: degree 3 (connected to 3^{b+1}, 3^{b-1}, 2*3^b).  - If b=0, a≠0,9: degree 3 (connected to 2^{a+1}, 2^{a-1}, 3*2^a).  - If a=9, b≠0,9: degree 3 (connected to 2^{8}*3^b, 2^9*3^{b+1}, 2^9*3^{b-1}).  - If b=9, a≠0,9: degree 3 (connected to 2^{a+1}*3^9, 2^{a-1}*3^9, 2^a*3^{8}).- Corner numbers (a=9,b=9): degree 2 (connected to 2^8*3^9 and 2^9*3^8).- Numbers in the middle (a from1 to8, b from1 to8): degree 4.Calculating the exact sum of degrees:- Corner numbers (4 corners? Wait, no. In a 10x10 grid, the corners are (0,0), (9,0), (0,9), (9,9). Each has degree 2.Total degree for corners: 4*2=8.- Edge numbers (excluding corners):  - For a=0, b from1 to8: 8 numbers, each with degree 3.  - For a=9, b from1 to8: 8 numbers, each with degree 3.  - For b=0, a from1 to8: 8 numbers, each with degree 3.  - For b=9, a from1 to8: 8 numbers, each with degree 3.Total edge numbers: 8*4=32, each with degree 3. Total degree:32*3=96.- Middle numbers (a from1 to8, b from1 to8): 8*8=64 numbers, each with degree 4. Total degree:64*4=256.Total sum of degrees:8 +96 +256=360.Therefore, the number of edges is 360/2=180, which matches our previous calculation.To maximize the number of edges, we need to maximize the sum of degrees. The maximum sum of degrees occurs when as many numbers as possible have higher degrees. In the grid structure, we have 64 numbers with degree 4, which contributes significantly to the sum. If we can find a structure with more numbers having degree 4, the sum would be higher. However, due to the limitations of the numbers being unique and the multiplicative factors, it&#39;s not possible to have more numbers with degree 4.For example, to have a number with degree 4, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3 (to have a/2 and a/3 present), and 2a and 3a must also be present. Therefore, such numbers need to be in the middle of the grid, where both dividing by 2 and 3 gives valid numbers, and multiplying by 2 and 3 also stays within the set. If we deviate from the grid, it&#39;s challenging to maintain these conditions for more numbers.Therefore, the grid structure maximizes the number of degree 4 nodes, leading to the highest possible sum of degrees, and hence the maximum number of edges (180).Therefore, the answer should be 180.But to confirm, let&#39;s think of an alternative arrangement. Suppose we have numbers arranged in a binary tree where each node has two children (multiply by 2 and 3). The root is 1. Then, each level would double the number of nodes. However, such a tree would have levels like 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8, 12, 18, 27, etc. However, after 10 levels, the number of nodes would be 2^10 -1=1023, which is way more than 100. To limit to 100 nodes, we would have to cut off the tree at a certain depth, but then the structure would be similar to the grid but less efficient. Also, the degrees would be similar but with more numbers on the edges (leaf nodes) which have lower degrees. Therefore, the sum of degrees would be less, leading to fewer edges.Another alternative: use numbers that are multiples of 2 and 3 but not necessarily in the grid. For example, arrange numbers such that more numbers can have both 2a and 3a present. However, this would require careful selection. Suppose we have numbers that are multiples of 6, since they can be divided by both 2 and 3. However, multiplying 6 by 2 gives 12, which is also divisible by 2 and 3, and so on. This is similar to the grid structure starting from 6. However, this is just a subset of the grid and would not contribute more edges.Alternatively, interleave chains of 2 and 3. For example, start with 1, then go to 2, then to 6, then to 12, then to 24, then to 72, etc. But such a chain would have numbers that are multiples of both 2 and 3, but again, this is part of the grid structure.Given that the grid structure seems to maximize the number of pairs where each number can be part of two pairs (except edges), and that the total pairs are 180, and no other structure seems to provide a higher count, I think the maximum number of good pairs is 180.However, to be thorough, let&#39;s check for smaller cases. Suppose we have n=2. The maximum good pairs is 1 (either (1,2) or (1,3)). For n=3, if we take {1,2,3}, we have pairs (1,2), (1,3) → total 2. For n=4, {1,2,3,4} gives pairs (1,2), (1,3), (2,4) → total 3. If we arrange as a grid (2x2), numbers 1,2,3,6. Wait, but 6 is larger. Alternatively, for n=4, grid would be 2x2: {1,2,3,6}. Pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,6), (3,6) → total 4 pairs. Which is better than the previous arrangement. So here, the grid gives more pairs.Similarly, for n=4, the grid structure gives 4 pairs, which is better. Therefore, the grid approach seems better even for small n.Another example: n=5. In grid 2x3: {1,2,3,4,6,12} but that&#39;s 6 numbers. For n=5, maybe {1,2,3,4,6}. Pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (2,6), (3,6) → total 5 pairs. If structured as a linear chain: 1,2,4,8,16 would have pairs (1,2), (2,4), (4,8), (8,16) → total 4 pairs. So again, the grid-like structure gives more pairs.Therefore, these examples suggest that the grid structure is indeed optimal.Therefore, applying this to n=100, the maximum number of good pairs is 180. Hence, the answer should be boxed{180}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of good pairs formed by 100 different positive integers, where a good pair is defined as two numbers with a ratio of either 2 or 3, we consider structuring the numbers in a grid-like arrangement.  Key Steps:1. Grid Structure: Numbers are arranged in the form (2^a cdot 3^b) where (a) and (b) are non-negative integers. This ensures each number can potentially form pairs by multiplying by 2 or 3.2. Exponents Range: For 100 numbers, we use a 10x10 grid where (0 leq a, b leq 9). This results in 100 unique numbers of the form (2^a cdot 3^b).3. Pairs Calculation:   - Each number (2^a cdot 3^b) can form a pair with (2^{a+1} cdot 3^b) (if (a+1 leq 9)) and (2^a cdot 3^{b+1}) (if (b+1 leq 9)).   - For each row (fixed (b)), there are 9 pairs from multiplying by 2, and for each column (fixed (a)), there are 9 pairs from multiplying by 3.   - Total pairs from rows: (10 times 9 = 90)   - Total pairs from columns: (10 times 9 = 90)4. Total Good Pairs: Summing these, we get (90 + 90 = 180) pairs. Conclusion:The grid structure maximizes the number of good pairs by ensuring each number (except those on the edges) can form two pairs. This results in the maximum number of good pairs being (boxed{180}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e4c04970></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e4c04970><span class="icon" data-v-e4c04970>🔑:</span>1. Define the problem in terms of graph theory:   We are given 100 different positive integers and need to find the maximum number of pairs ((a, b)) such that the ratio (frac{a}{b}) is either 2 or 3. We can model this problem using a directed graph (G) where each vertex represents one of the 100 integers, and there is a directed edge from vertex (a) to vertex (b) if (frac{a}{b} = 2) or (frac{a}{b} = 3).2. Construct the graph:   Let (V(G)) be the set of 100 vertices representing the integers. We need to consider two subgraphs (G_2) and (G_3), where (G_2) contains edges ((a, b)) such that (frac{a}{b} = 2) and (G_3) contains edges ((a, b)) such that (frac{a}{b} = 3).3. Analyze the structure of (G_2) and (G_3):   Each subgraph (G_2) and (G_3) can be decomposed into disjoint directed paths. The length of each path in (G_2) and (G_3) is determined by the number of vertices in the path minus one. Let (n_2) and (n_3) be the number of such paths in (G_2) and (G_3) respectively.4. Calculate the number of edges:   The number of edges in (G_2) is given by the sum of the lengths of all paths in (G_2). If there are (n_2) paths, the total number of edges in (G_2) is:   [   e_2 = sum_{i=1}^{n_2} (lambda_{2,i}) = 100 - n_2   ]   Similarly, the number of edges in (G_3) is:   [   e_3 = sum_{i=1}^{n_3} (lambda_{3,i}) = 100 - n_3   ]5. Maximize the total number of edges:   We need to maximize the total number of edges (e_2 + e_3). This is equivalent to minimizing the total number of paths (n_2 + n_3). 6. Minimize the number of paths:   To minimize (n_2 + n_3), we need to consider the structure of the paths. If we can arrange the integers such that each integer is part of a path in both (G_2) and (G_3), we can minimize the number of paths. The optimal arrangement is to have each integer (x) such that (x, 2x, 4x, ldots) and (x, 3x, 9x, ldots) are all part of the set of 100 integers.7. Optimal arrangement:   The optimal arrangement is to have the integers in the form of (2^i cdot 3^j) for (0 leq i, j &lt; 10). This gives us a total of (10 times 10 = 100) integers. In this arrangement, each integer can be part of both a path in (G_2) and a path in (G_3).8. Calculate the number of good pairs:   In this optimal arrangement, each path in (G_2) and (G_3) will have 10 vertices, resulting in 9 edges per path. Since there are 10 such paths in each subgraph, the total number of edges (good pairs) is:   [   e_2 + e_3 = 10 times 9 + 10 times 9 = 90 + 90 = 180   ]Conclusion:[boxed{180}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-b9d3213f data-v-e4c04970><div class="review" data-v-e4c04970><div class="review-title" data-v-e4c04970><span class="icon" data-v-e4c04970>❓:</span>3.

And I need to find the range of angle B from the given options. Let&#39;s parse this step by step.First, the equation given is lg tg A + lg tg C = 2 lg tg B. I know that &quot;lg&quot; usually stands for logarithm base 10, and &quot;tg&quot; is tangent. So, translating that, it&#39;s log(tan A) + log(tan C) = 2 log(tan B). Using logarithm properties, I can combine the left side: log(tan A * tan C) = log(tan B)^2. Since log is a one-to-one function, this implies that tan A * tan C = (tan B)^2. So, the equation simplifies to tan A * tan C = tan² B.Now, in a triangle, the sum of angles is π radians. So, A + B + C = π. Therefore, A + C = π - B. So, angles A and C are related by their sum being π - B. Maybe I can express angles A and C in terms of B. Let&#39;s denote angle A as x and angle C as (π - B - x). Then, tan A * tan C becomes tan x * tan(π - B - x). Let me write that down:tan x * tan(π - B - x) = tan² B.Hmm. Let&#39;s see if I can simplify tan(π - B - x). Since π - B - x is the same as (π - (B + x)), and tan(π - θ) = -tan θ. Wait, but π - (B + x) is the same as angle C, but since we&#39;re in a triangle, all angles are between 0 and π, so tan(angle) is defined (except at π/2, but angles in a triangle can&#39;t be π/2 unless it&#39;s a right triangle). Wait, but in any case, angles A, B, C are between 0 and π, and their sum is π, so each is less than π.But tan(π - B - x) = tan(C) since C = π - B - A, right? Wait, if A = x, then C = π - B - x. So tan C = tan(π - B - x). Let&#39;s recall that tan(π - θ) = -tan θ, but here we have π - (B + x). So, tan(π - (B + x)) = -tan(B + x). Therefore, tan C = -tan(B + x). But in a triangle, angles are positive and less than π, so π - (B + x) must be between 0 and π. Since B and x are both positive and B + x &lt; π (because A + B + C = π, and C is also positive), so π - (B + x) is positive. Therefore, tan C is equal to -tan(B + x), but since C is positive and less than π, and B + x is also between 0 and π, but tan(B + x) can be positive or negative?Wait, no. If B + x is between 0 and π, then tan(B + x) is positive if B + x is between 0 and π/2, and negative if B + x is between π/2 and π. However, C = π - (B + x) is between 0 and π. So tan C = tan(π - (B + x)) = -tan(B + x). But since C is an angle in a triangle, which is between 0 and π, so tan C can be positive or negative? Wait, but in reality, angles in a triangle are between 0 and π, but tangent is positive in the first and third quadrants. However, angles in a triangle are between 0 and π, so angles in the first and second quadrants (since π is 180 degrees). Tangent is positive in the first quadrant (0 to π/2) and negative in the second quadrant (π/2 to π). Therefore, tan C is positive if C is acute (less than π/2) and negative if C is obtuse (greater than π/2). Similarly for angles A and B.But in a triangle, only one angle can be obtuse. So, if angle B is obtuse, then angles A and C must be acute. If angle B is acute, then either A or C can be obtuse, but not both.But since we&#39;re dealing with logarithms of tangents, log(tan A) and log(tan C) must be defined. So tan A and tan C must be positive, because logarithm of a negative number is undefined in real numbers. Therefore, tan A and tan C must be positive, which implies that angles A and C are acute (i.e., between 0 and π/2). Similarly, since we have log(tan B), angle B must also be acute, so the entire triangle must be acute-angled. Because if any angle is obtuse, its tangent would be negative, making the logarithm undefined. Therefore, all angles A, B, C are acute (less than π/2). So that simplifies things.Therefore, all angles are between 0 and π/2, so A, B, C ∈ (0, π/2), and A + B + C = π. Therefore, A + C = π - B. Since both A and C are less than π/2, π - B = A + C &lt; π/2 + π/2 = π, which is true. But also, since A and C are positive, π - B &gt; 0, which is also true because B &lt; π.But given that all angles are acute, π - B = A + C must be greater than π/2, because if A and C are each less than π/2, then their sum is less than π. Wait, but if B is acute, then π - B is greater than π/2. For example, if B is π/3, then A + C = 2π/3. So angles A and C sum to 2π/3, each less than π/2. So each of them must be less than π/2, so 2π/3 could be split into two angles each less than π/2. Wait, 2π/3 is 120 degrees. So if each angle is less than 90 degrees, then their sum would be less than 180, but 120 is less than 180. Wait, that&#39;s confusing. Wait, A + C = π - B. Since B is acute (less than π/2), π - B is greater than π/2. So A + C is greater than π/2. But since both A and C are less than π/2, their sum can be between greater than π/2 and less than π (since each is less than π/2, their sum is less than π). So A + C ∈ (π/2, π).Therefore, angles A and C are each between 0 and π/2, but their sum is between π/2 and π.But maybe that&#39;s more detailed than necessary. Let&#39;s get back to the equation tan A * tan C = tan² B.Since A + C = π - B, perhaps we can express tan A * tan C in terms of B. Let me recall that in a triangle, when you have two angles that add up to a certain value, there are trigonometric identities that relate the product of their tangents. Let me see.We can use the formula for tan(A + C). Since A + C = π - B, tan(A + C) = tan(π - B) = -tan B. On the other hand, tan(A + C) = (tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan A tan C). So:(tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan A tan C) = -tan B.But we also know that tan A * tan C = tan² B from the given equation. Let me denote tan A * tan C = tan² B. Let me denote that as T = tan A tan C = tan² B.Then, substituting into the previous equation:(tan A + tan C)/(1 - T) = -tan B.But T = tan² B, so:(tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan² B) = -tan B.Therefore, tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan² B) = -tan B + tan³ B.But tan A + tan C is positive because both A and C are acute, so their tangents are positive. The right-hand side is -tan B + tan³ B. Since tan B is positive (B is acute), so -tan B + tan³ B = tan B (tan² B - 1). So we have tan A + tan C = tan B (tan² B - 1).But since the left side is positive, the right side must also be positive. Therefore, tan B (tan² B - 1) &gt; 0.Since tan B is positive (B is acute), this implies that tan² B - 1 &gt; 0. Therefore, tan² B &gt; 1 =&gt; tan B &gt; 1 (since tan B is positive). Therefore, tan B &gt; 1 =&gt; B &gt; π/4. Because tan(π/4) = 1, and tan is increasing on (0, π/2). So angle B must be greater than π/4.But wait, the answer options don&#39;t include π/4. The options are: (A) 0 &lt; B ≤ π/3; (B) π/3 ≤ B &lt; π/2; (C) 0 &lt; B ≤ π/6; (D) π/6 ≤ B &lt; π/2). Hmm. So according to this, B must be greater than π/4, but π/4 is approximately 45 degrees, and π/3 is 60 degrees. So if B must be greater than 45 degrees, but the options don&#39;t have a lower bound of π/4. So perhaps there&#39;s more to this.Wait, but maybe my reasoning is missing something. Let&#39;s check again.We had tan A + tan C = tan B (tan² B - 1). But we need to relate this to other constraints. Also, note that A + C = π - B. So, maybe we can use the identity for tan A + tan C. Let&#39;s express tan A + tan C in terms of A + C and A * C.Wait, tan A + tan C = tan(A + C)(1 - tan A tan C). Wait, but that&#39;s similar to what we had before. Let me recall that tan(A + C) = (tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan A tan C). Therefore, tan A + tan C = tan(A + C)(1 - tan A tan C). Since A + C = π - B, tan(A + C) = tan(π - B) = -tan B. Therefore, tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan A tan C). But from the given equation, tan A tan C = tan² B. Therefore, substituting that in:tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan² B).But from earlier, we have tan A + tan C = tan B (tan² B - 1). Which is the same as -tan B (1 - tan² B) = tan B (tan² B - 1). So that checks out. But we also need to make sure that A and C are positive and add up to π - B.But perhaps another approach is needed here. Let me consider that in triangle ABC, all angles are acute, so B is between 0 and π/2. Let me try to express tan A * tan C in terms of B.Given that A + C = π - B, we can write C = π - B - A.Therefore, tan C = tan(π - B - A) = tan(π - (B + A)) = -tan(B + A). So tan C = -tan(B + A). But since A + B + C = π, so A + B = π - C. But C is acute, so π - C is greater than π/2, so tan(B + A) = tan(π - C) = -tan C. Wait, this seems circular.Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in a triangle, tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C. But that identity is for any triangle? Wait, no. Wait, in a triangle with angles A, B, C, the identity tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C holds only if the triangle is not right-angled. Since all angles are acute here, it&#39;s valid. So, tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C.But we have the equation tan A tan C = tan² B. Let me denote that as T = tan² B. Then, according to the identity:tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C.But tan A tan C is T = tan² B, so the right-hand side becomes tan B * T = tan B * tan² B = tan³ B.Therefore, tan A + tan B + tan C = tan³ B.But we also know from earlier that tan A + tan C = tan B (tan² B - 1). Therefore, substituting into the identity:tan B (tan² B - 1) + tan B = tan³ B.Simplifying the left side:tan B (tan² B - 1) + tan B = tan B (tan² B - 1 + 1) = tan B * tan² B = tan³ B.Which equals the right side. Therefore, this identity holds, but it doesn&#39;t give us new information. So we need another approach.Alternatively, perhaps express tan A * tan C in terms of angle B. Let me recall that in a triangle, if A + C = π - B, then:tan A tan C = [sin A sin C]/[cos A cos C].But perhaps using the formula for cos(A - C) and sin(A + C). Wait, let&#39;s consider that:sin(A + C) = sin(π - B) = sin B.cos(A + C) = cos(π - B) = -cos B.Also, sin A sin C = [cos(A - C) - cos(A + C)] / 2.Similarly, cos A cos C = [cos(A - C) + cos(A + C)] / 2.Therefore, tan A tan C = [sin A sin C]/[cos A cos C] = [cos(A - C) - cos(A + C)] / [cos(A - C) + cos(A + C)].Substituting cos(A + C) = -cos B:tan A tan C = [cos(A - C) - (-cos B)] / [cos(A - C) + (-cos B)] = [cos(A - C) + cos B] / [cos(A - C) - cos B].But from the given equation, tan A tan C = tan² B. Therefore:[cos(A - C) + cos B] / [cos(A - C) - cos B] = tan² B.Let me denote D = A - C. Then, cos D is involved here. So:[cos D + cos B] / [cos D - cos B] = tan² B.Cross-multiplying:(cos D + cos B) = tan² B (cos D - cos B).Bringing all terms to one side:cos D + cos B - tan² B cos D + tan² B cos B = 0.Factor out cos D:cos D (1 - tan² B) + cos B (1 + tan² B) = 0.Then,cos D = - [cos B (1 + tan² B)] / [1 - tan² B].But 1 + tan² B = sec² B, so:cos D = - [cos B * sec² B] / [1 - tan² B] = - [sec B] / [1 - tan² B].Wait, let&#39;s compute that step by step:1 + tan² B = sec² B, so:cos D = - [cos B * sec² B] / [1 - tan² B] = - [cos B * (1 / cos² B)] / [1 - tan² B] = - [1 / cos B] / [1 - tan² B].But tan² B = (sin² B / cos² B), so:1 - tan² B = (cos² B - sin² B)/cos² B = cos(2B)/cos² B.Therefore:cos D = - [1 / cos B] / [cos(2B)/cos² B] = - [1 / cos B] * [cos² B / cos(2B)] = - [cos B / cos(2B)].Thus:cos D = - cos B / cos(2B).But D = A - C, which can be any value such that A and C are both positive and add up to π - B. However, the cosine of D must satisfy |cos D| ≤ 1. Therefore, |-cos B / cos(2B)| ≤ 1.So:| -cos B / cos(2B) | = | cos B / cos(2B) | ≤ 1.Therefore:|cos B| ≤ |cos 2B|.Since all angles are acute, B is between 0 and π/2, so 2B is between 0 and π. Therefore, cos B is positive, and cos 2B is positive if 2B &lt; π/2, i.e., B &lt; π/4, and negative if 2B &gt; π/2, i.e., B &gt; π/4. So:Case 1: B &lt; π/4. Then, cos 2B is positive. Therefore, the inequality is cos B ≤ cos 2B.Case 2: B &gt; π/4. Then, cos 2B is negative. So, |cos B / cos 2B| = cos B / |cos 2B| = cos B / (-cos 2B). Since cos 2B is negative, -cos 2B is positive. The inequality becomes cos B / (-cos 2B) ≤ 1.But let&#39;s analyze both cases:Case 1: B &lt; π/4.Inequality: cos B ≤ cos 2B.But since B &lt; π/4, 2B &lt; π/2. Cosine is decreasing on [0, π/2], so if 2B &gt; B (which it is, since B &gt; 0), then cos 2B &lt; cos B. Therefore, cos B ≤ cos 2B would imply cos B ≤ something smaller than cos B, which is impossible. Therefore, no solutions in this case.Case 2: B &gt; π/4.Here, cos 2B is negative. The inequality is cos B / (-cos 2B) ≤ 1. Let&#39;s write this as:cos B ≤ -cos 2B.Multiply both sides by -1 (reversing inequality):-cos B ≥ cos 2B.But cos 2B = 2 cos² B - 1.So, -cos B ≥ 2 cos² B - 1.Rearranging:2 cos² B - 1 + cos B ≤ 0.So, 2 cos² B + cos B - 1 ≤ 0.This is a quadratic in cos B. Let me denote x = cos B:2x² + x - 1 ≤ 0.Solve 2x² + x - 1 = 0:x = [-1 ± √(1 + 8)] / 4 = [-1 ± 3]/4.So, x = (2)/4 = 1/2, or x = (-4)/4 = -1.Therefore, the quadratic is ≤ 0 between x = -1 and x = 1/2. But since x = cos B and B ∈ (π/4, π/2), then x = cos B ∈ (0, √2/2). Since √2/2 ≈ 0.707, and 1/2 is 0.5. So in the interval (π/4, π/2), cos B decreases from √2/2 to 0. Therefore, the inequality 2x² + x - 1 ≤ 0 holds for x ∈ [-1, 1/2]. But in our case, x ∈ (0, √2/2). The overlap is x ∈ (0, 1/2]. Therefore, cos B ≤ 1/2. Which implies that B ≥ π/3, since cos(π/3) = 1/2. And since B &lt; π/2, combining these, we have π/3 ≤ B &lt; π/2.Therefore, angle B must be in [π/3, π/2). Therefore, the correct answer is option (B).Let me double-check.We started with the given equation tan A tan C = tan² B, and through various manipulations, we found that angle B must be greater than π/4 and then derived further constraints leading to B ≥ π/3. The critical step was recognizing that the expression involving cos D (where D = A - C) must satisfy a certain inequality, leading us to the quadratic in cos B. Solving that quadratic gave us the bound cos B ≤ 1/2, which translates to B ≥ π/3. Since the triangle is acute, B must be less than π/2. Therefore, the range is π/3 ≤ B &lt; π/2, which is option (B). This makes sense because if B were less than π/3, then cos B would be greater than 1/2, violating the inequality. Therefore, the answer should be option (B).Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem in triangle ( triangle ABC ), we need to find the range of angle ( B ) given the equation ( lg operatorname{tg} A + lg operatorname{tg} C = 2 lg operatorname{tg} B ).First, we convert the logarithmic equation to its exponential form:[lg (tan A) + lg (tan C) = 2 lg (tan B)]Using logarithm properties, this simplifies to:[tan A cdot tan C = (tan B)^2]Since the sum of angles in a triangle is ( pi ), we have ( A + B + C = pi ), hence ( A + C = pi - B ). We use the identity for the tangent of a sum:[tan(A + C) = tan(pi - B) = -tan B]Expressing ( tan(A + C) ) in terms of ( tan A ) and ( tan C ):[tan(A + C) = frac{tan A + tan C}{1 - tan A tan C} = -tan B]Substituting ( tan A tan C = tan^2 B ):[frac{tan A + tan C}{1 - tan^2 B} = -tan B]This simplifies to:[tan A + tan C = tan B (tan^2 B - 1)]Considering the trigonometric identity for the sum of tangents in a triangle:[tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C]Substituting ( tan A tan C = tan^2 B ):[tan A + tan B + tan C = tan B cdot tan^2 B = tan^3 B]Thus:[tan A + tan C = tan^3 B - tan B]Equating the two expressions for ( tan A + tan C ):[tan B (tan^2 B - 1) = tan^3 B - tan B]This confirms the identity, leading us to analyze the inequality constraints. We find that ( tan B &gt; 1 ) (since ( tan B ) must be positive and greater than 1), implying ( B &gt; frac{pi}{4} ).Further analysis using the quadratic inequality derived from the cosine expressions leads to:[cos B leq frac{1}{2}]This implies ( B geq frac{pi}{3} ). Since ( B ) must be acute, the range of ( B ) is ( frac{pi}{3} leq B &lt; frac{pi}{2} ).Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this trigonometry problem here about triangle ABC. The question says that the logarithm of the tangent of angle A plus the logarithm of the tangent of angle C equals twice the logarithm of the tangent of angle B. Then I need to find the range of angle B from the given options. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s recall some basics about triangles. In any triangle, the sum of the angles is π radians (or 180 degrees). So, in triangle ABC, we have:A + B + C = π.Given that, if we know two angles, we can find the third one. But here, the problem gives a relationship involving the logarithms of the tangents of angles A and C in terms of angle B. Hmm, logarithms and tangents. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the equation.The equation given is:lg tg A + lg tg C = 2 lg tg B.I need to parse this notation. &quot;lg&quot; usually stands for logarithm base 10, and &quot;tg&quot; is likely the tangent function, so &quot;lg tg A&quot; would be log(tan A). Similarly for the others. So, in more familiar terms, the equation is:log(tan A) + log(tan C) = 2 log(tan B).Using logarithm properties, log(tan A) + log(tan C) is equal to log(tan A * tan C). Similarly, 2 log(tan B) is log(tan B)^2. So, the equation simplifies to:log(tan A * tan C) = log(tan^2 B).Since logarithm is a one-to-one function, if log(x) = log(y), then x = y. Therefore:tan A * tan C = tan^2 B.So now, the key equation is:tan A * tan C = tan² B.Now, since in triangle ABC, A + B + C = π, we can express A and C in terms of B. Let&#39;s see:A + C = π - B.So, C = π - B - A. But since we have two angles, A and C, expressed in terms of each other, maybe we can find a relationship between tan A and tan C.Alternatively, since A and C add up to π - B, maybe we can use some trigonometric identities involving the tangent of angles that sum to π - B.Recall that tan(A + C) = tan(π - B). But tan(π - B) is equal to -tan B, because tangent has a period of π and tan(π - x) = -tan x. So:tan(A + C) = tan(π - B) = -tan B.But also, the tangent addition formula says:tan(A + C) = (tan A + tan C) / (1 - tan A tan C).But we know tan(A + C) = -tan B. Therefore:(tan A + tan C) / (1 - tan A tan C) = -tan B.But we also know from earlier that tan A * tan C = tan² B. Let&#39;s denote tan A * tan C = tan² B. Let&#39;s call that equation (1). Then, substituting equation (1) into the above expression:(tan A + tan C) / (1 - tan² B) = -tan B.Multiply both sides by (1 - tan² B):tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan² B).But let&#39;s see. Let me write that again:tan A + tan C = -tan B + tan³ B.Hmm. This seems a bit complex. Maybe there&#39;s another way. Let&#39;s try to express A and C in terms of B. Let me denote A = x and C = π - B - x. Then, tan A * tan C = tan² B becomes tan x * tan(π - B - x) = tan² B.But tan(π - B - x) is tan(π - (B + x)) = -tan(B + x). So:tan x * (-tan(B + x)) = tan² B.So,- tan x tan(B + x) = tan² B.Therefore,tan x tan(B + x) = -tan² B.Hmm, that seems tricky. Maybe we can expand tan(B + x) using the addition formula:tan(B + x) = (tan B + tan x) / (1 - tan B tan x).Therefore:tan x * [(tan B + tan x) / (1 - tan B tan x)] = -tan² B.Multiply both sides by (1 - tan B tan x):tan x (tan B + tan x) = -tan² B (1 - tan B tan x).Let&#39;s expand both sides:Left side: tan x tan B + tan² x.Right side: -tan² B + tan³ B tan x.Bring all terms to the left side:tan x tan B + tan² x + tan² B - tan³ B tan x = 0.Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there is a better approach. Let me think.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the fact that in triangle ABC, A, B, C are all positive and less than π. Also, since it&#39;s a triangle, each angle must be between 0 and π, and the sum is π. So, all angles are in (0, π).But tangent is positive in the first and third quadrants. However, since angles A, B, C are between 0 and π, their tangents are positive only if the angles are in the first quadrant (0 to π/2) because in the second quadrant (π/2 to π), tangent is negative. But in a triangle, each angle must be less than π, so angles can be acute (0 to π/2) or obtuse (π/2 to π). However, in a triangle, there can be at most one obtuse angle.But if angle B is obtuse, then angles A and C must be acute, since their sum is π - B, which would be less than π/2. Similarly, if angle A or C is obtuse, then the other angles must be acute. However, given that we have log(tan A) and log(tan C), the arguments of the logarithm must be positive. Therefore, tan A and tan C must be positive, which implies that angles A and C are acute (i.e., between 0 and π/2). Similarly, tan B must be positive, so angle B is also acute. Therefore, triangle ABC must be acute-angled, with all angles less than π/2. That simplifies things a bit because all angles are in (0, π/2), so their tangents are positive, and the logarithms are defined.Therefore, angles A, B, C are all in (0, π/2), and A + B + C = π. Therefore, A + C = π - B.So, A and C are two angles that add up to π - B, which is greater than π/2 because B is less than π/2. Wait, π - B would be greater than π/2 because B is less than π/2. For example, if B is π/3, then π - B is 2π/3. So A + C = something greater than π/2, but both A and C are less than π/2. So, A and C are both acute angles, but their sum is obtuse. That&#39;s okay.Now, we have the equation tan A tan C = tan² B.Since A + C = π - B, maybe we can use a trigonometric identity for tan A tan C when A + C is known.I recall that in general, tan A tan C can be expressed in terms of the sum and difference of angles, but let&#39;s see.Alternatively, we can use the identity:tan(A + C) = (tan A + tan C) / (1 - tan A tan C).But as before, we know tan(A + C) = tan(π - B) = -tan B.So:(tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan A tan C) = -tan B.But we know from our previous equation that tan A tan C = tan² B. Let&#39;s substitute that into the denominator:(tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan² B) = -tan B.Multiply both sides by (1 - tan² B):tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan² B).But the left side, tan A + tan C, is positive because both A and C are acute angles, so their tangents are positive. The right side is -tan B (1 - tan² B). Since tan B is positive (B is acute), the right side is -tan B + tan³ B. So, for the right side to be positive (since left side is positive), we must have:- tan B + tan³ B &gt; 0.Factor out tan B:tan B (-1 + tan² B) &gt; 0.So, tan B (tan² B - 1) &gt; 0.Since tan B is positive (because B is acute), the sign of the entire expression depends on (tan² B - 1). Therefore:tan² B - 1 &gt; 0 =&gt; tan² B &gt; 1 =&gt; tan B &gt; 1 or tan B &lt; -1.But tan B is positive (as B is acute), so tan B &gt; 1. Therefore:tan B &gt; 1 =&gt; B &gt; π/4.So, angle B must be greater than π/4. But B is an acute angle, so π/4 &lt; B &lt; π/2.But wait, this seems conflicting with the answer choices given. The options are:(A) 0 &lt; angle B ≤ π/3(B) π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2(C) 0 &lt; angle B ≤ π/6(D) π/6 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2Hmm, none of these directly mention π/4. But maybe we need to check our reasoning again.Wait, we derived that tan B &gt; 1, which implies B &gt; π/4. However, the problem is asking for the range of angle B given the original equation. But according to this, B must be between π/4 and π/2. However, none of the answer choices include π/4. The closest are options B and D, which start at π/3 and π/6, respectively.But maybe we need to check whether the lower bound is π/3 or π/4. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the reasoning. Let me go back.So, starting from:tan A * tan C = tan² B.And A + C = π - B.Let me consider using the AM-GM inequality on tan A and tan C. Since A and C are positive angles adding to π - B, perhaps we can relate their product to their sum. But I need to recall that for positive numbers, the product is maximized when the numbers are equal.Alternatively, since A and C are variables subject to A + C = π - B, the product tan A tan C can be expressed as a function of π - B.Let me set θ = π - B. Then, A + C = θ. So, tan A tan C = tan² B.But θ = π - B, so tan θ = tan(π - B) = -tan B. But θ is equal to A + C, which is in (π/2, π) because B is in (0, π/2). Wait, θ = π - B, so if B is in (0, π/2), then θ is in (π/2, π). Therefore, A and C are two angles adding to θ, which is in (π/2, π). So, both A and C are in (0, π/2), but their sum is in (π/2, π). Therefore, each of them is less than π/2, but their sum is greater than π/2.So, given that, tan A tan C = tan² B. Let me try to express tan A tan C in terms of θ. Since θ = π - B, so B = π - θ. Therefore, tan B = tan(π - θ) = -tan θ. But since B is in (0, π/2), θ is in (π/2, π), so tan θ is negative. Therefore, tan B = -tan θ, so tan² B = tan² θ.Therefore, the equation becomes tan A tan C = tan² θ, where θ = π - B and θ is in (π/2, π).But θ is fixed once B is fixed. So, for a given B, θ is fixed, and A and C must satisfy A + C = θ and tan A tan C = tan² θ.Wait, so the problem reduces to: given θ in (π/2, π), find A and C in (0, π/2) such that A + C = θ and tan A tan C = tan² θ. Then, determine the possible θ, which relates back to B as θ = π - B.But perhaps there is a maximum or minimum value for θ such that this is possible. Let&#39;s consider the equation tan A tan C = tan² θ, with A + C = θ.Let me write C = θ - A. Then:tan A tan(θ - A) = tan² θ.Let me compute tan(θ - A):tan(θ - A) = [tan θ - tan A] / [1 + tan θ tan A].Therefore, tan A * [ (tan θ - tan A) / (1 + tan θ tan A) ] = tan² θ.Multiply both sides by (1 + tan θ tan A):tan A (tan θ - tan A) = tan² θ (1 + tan θ tan A).Expand left side:tan A tan θ - tan² A = tan² θ + tan³ θ tan A.Bring all terms to one side:tan A tan θ - tan² A - tan² θ - tan³ θ tan A = 0.Factor terms:tan A tan θ - tan³ θ tan A - tan² A - tan² θ = 0.Factor tan A tan θ (1 - tan² θ) - tan² A - tan² θ = 0.This seems complicated. Maybe another approach. Let&#39;s denote x = tan A. Then, since A + C = θ, we have C = θ - A, so tan C = tan(θ - A) = [tan θ - tan A]/[1 + tan θ tan A] = (tan θ - x)/(1 + x tan θ).Therefore, tan A tan C = x * (tan θ - x)/(1 + x tan θ) = [x(tan θ - x)] / (1 + x tan θ) = tan² θ.So, cross-multiplying:x(tan θ - x) = tan² θ (1 + x tan θ).Expanding both sides:x tan θ - x² = tan² θ + x tan³ θ.Bring all terms to left side:x tan θ - x² - tan² θ - x tan³ θ = 0.Factor x terms:x(tan θ - tan³ θ) - x² - tan² θ = 0.Factor tan θ:x tan θ(1 - tan² θ) - x² - tan² θ = 0.This is a quadratic equation in x:- x² + x tan θ(1 - tan² θ) - tan² θ = 0.Multiply both sides by -1:x² - x tan θ(1 - tan² θ) + tan² θ = 0.Let me write this as:x² - [tan θ(1 - tan² θ)] x + tan² θ = 0.This quadratic equation must have real solutions for x (since A exists). Therefore, the discriminant must be non-negative.Discriminant D = [tan θ(1 - tan² θ)]² - 4 * 1 * tan² θ.Compute D:D = tan² θ (1 - tan² θ)^2 - 4 tan² θ.Factor tan² θ:D = tan² θ [ (1 - tan² θ)^2 - 4 ].Simplify inside the brackets:(1 - tan² θ)^2 - 4 = 1 - 2 tan² θ + tan⁴ θ - 4 = tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3.So, D = tan² θ (tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3).For real solutions, D ≥ 0.Therefore:tan² θ (tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3) ≥ 0.Since θ is in (π/2, π), tan θ is negative, but tan² θ is positive. So tan² θ is positive, so the sign of D depends on the second factor:tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3 ≥ 0.Let me set y = tan² θ, which is positive (since tan θ is real). Then:y² - 2y - 3 ≥ 0.Solve this quadratic inequality:y² - 2y - 3 = 0 =&gt; y = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2.Thus, y = (2 + 4)/2 = 3 or y = (2 - 4)/2 = -1.Since y = tan² θ is positive, we discard y = -1. Therefore, the inequality y² - 2y - 3 ≥ 0 holds when y ≥ 3 or y ≤ -1. But since y is positive, the inequality holds when y ≥ 3.Therefore, tan² θ ≥ 3.Taking square roots:tan θ ≥ sqrt(3) or tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3).But θ is in (π/2, π), where tan θ is negative. Therefore, tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3).Therefore, tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3).But θ is in (π/2, π), so tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3) implies that θ ≥ 2π/3. Because in the second quadrant, tan θ is negative, and tan(2π/3) = tan(120°) = -sqrt(3). For θ &gt; 2π/3, tan θ becomes more negative, i.e., tan θ &lt; -sqrt(3). Wait, but when θ approaches π/2 from above, tan θ approaches negative infinity. Wait, no. Wait, θ is between π/2 and π. At θ = π/2, tan θ is undefined. As θ approaches π/2 from above (i.e., slightly larger than π/2), tan θ approaches negative infinity. At θ = π, tan θ is 0. So, tan θ is continuous on (π/2, π), starting from -∞ and increasing to 0. Therefore, tan θ = -sqrt(3) occurs at θ = π - π/3 = 2π/3. So, θ ≥ 2π/3 corresponds to tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3). Wait, no. Wait, as θ increases from π/2 to π, tan θ increases from -∞ to 0. So, when θ = 2π/3, tan θ = -sqrt(3). For θ &gt; 2π/3, tan θ is greater than -sqrt(3) (since it&#39;s increasing), so closer to zero. Therefore, tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3) corresponds to θ ≤ 2π/3. Wait, that&#39;s the opposite.Wait, let&#39;s think. Let&#39;s take θ1 = π/2 + ε (where ε is a small positive number). Then tan θ1 is a large negative number. As θ increases to 2π/3, tan θ becomes -sqrt(3). Then, as θ increases further towards π, tan θ approaches 0 from the negative side. Therefore, tan θ is increasing from -∞ to 0 as θ increases from π/2 to π. Therefore, tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3) occurs when θ is in [2π/3, π). Wait, no. Wait, when θ is 2π/3, tan θ is -sqrt(3). For θ less than 2π/3 (but greater than π/2), tan θ is less than -sqrt(3) (more negative). For θ greater than 2π/3, tan θ is greater than -sqrt(3) (closer to zero). Therefore, tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3) when θ ≤ 2π/3. But θ is in (π/2, π). So, tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3) corresponds to θ ∈ (π/2, 2π/3].But θ = π - B. Therefore, θ ∈ (π/2, π) corresponds to B ∈ (0, π/2). Wait, θ = π - B, so if θ ∈ (π/2, 2π/3], then B = π - θ ∈ [π - 2π/3, π - π/2) = [π/3, π/2). Therefore, B ∈ [π/3, π/2). So, the condition tan θ ≤ -sqrt(3) translates to B ∈ [π/3, π/2).Therefore, the discriminant D is non-negative only when B ∈ [π/3, π/2). Therefore, angle B must be in [π/3, π/2). Therefore, the correct answer is option B: π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2.Wait, but let me confirm this once again.So, we started with the equation tan A tan C = tan² B. Through substitutions and using the discriminant condition for the quadratic in x = tan A, we found that the discriminant must be non-negative, leading us to the condition that tan² θ ≥ 3, which translates to θ ≤ 2π/3, and thus B ≥ π/3. Therefore, B is between π/3 and π/2. So, the range of angle B is [π/3, π/2). Hence, option B.But let me check with a specific example. Suppose angle B is π/3. Then θ = π - π/3 = 2π/3. Then tan θ = tan(2π/3) = -sqrt(3), so tan² θ = 3. Then the equation tan A tan C = 3. Also, A + C = 2π/3.Let me take A = C = π/3. Then tan A tan C = (sqrt(3))^2 = 3, which matches. So, in this case, A = C = π/3, B = π/3, which is an equilateral triangle, and it satisfies the equation. So, that&#39;s a valid case.If angle B is greater than π/3, say B = π/2 - ε, where ε is a small positive number. Then θ = π - B = π/2 + ε. Then tan θ = tan(π/2 + ε) = -cot ε, which approaches -∞ as ε approaches 0. Then tan² θ approaches ∞. So, tan A tan C = tan² B. But tan B = tan(π/2 - ε) = cot ε, so tan² B = cot² ε. Then tan A tan C = cot² ε. But A + C = π - B = π/2 + ε. Let&#39;s take A approaching π/2, so C approaches ε. Then tan A approaches ∞, tan C approaches tan ε ≈ ε. Then tan A tan C approaches ∞ * ε, which could be anything depending on the rate. But since θ = π/2 + ε, which is very close to π/2. Wait, maybe this approach isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, take B = π/4. Then θ = π - π/4 = 3π/4. Then tan θ = tan(3π/4) = -1. So tan² θ = 1. Then the equation tan A tan C = 1, with A + C = 3π/4. Let&#39;s see if such angles exist. For example, let A = π/4, then C = 3π/4 - π/4 = π/2. But C = π/2 is not allowed because in a triangle, all angles must be less than π/2 (since we established earlier all angles are acute). Wait, but if B is π/4, then A + C = 3π/4. If C approaches π/2, then A approaches 3π/4 - π/2 = π/4. So, tan A approaches 1, tan C approaches ∞, so tan A tan C approaches ∞, which is greater than 1. But we need tan A tan C = 1. Hmm, so perhaps there is no solution when B = π/4, which would mean that B cannot be less than π/3. Wait, but according to our previous result, B should be in [π/3, π/2). Let me check that.If B = π/3, θ = 2π/3, tan θ = -sqrt(3), tan² θ = 3. So, tan A tan C = 3. If A = C = π/3, as before, tan π/3 = sqrt(3), so product is 3, which works. If we take B slightly larger than π/3, say B = π/3 + δ, then θ = π - B = 2π/3 - δ. Then tan θ = tan(2π/3 - δ) = [tan 2π/3 - tan δ]/[1 + tan 2π/3 tan δ] = [-sqrt(3) - tan δ]/[1 - sqrt(3) tan δ]. This complicates, but tan² θ would still be greater than 3? Wait, no. If θ is decreasing from 2π/3 to π/2 as B increases from π/3 to π/2, then tan θ is increasing from -sqrt(3) to -infty. Wait, no. Wait, as θ decreases from 2π/3 to π/2 (since θ = π - B, and B increases from π/3 to π/2), θ decreases from 2π/3 to π/2. As θ decreases from 2π/3 to π/2, moving towards π/2, tan θ becomes more negative, approaching -infty. Therefore, tan² θ increases from 3 to infinity. Therefore, tan² θ ≥ 3, which is consistent with our discriminant condition. Therefore, as B increases from π/3 to π/2, θ decreases from 2π/3 to π/2, tan² θ increases from 3 to infinity, so the equation tan A tan C = tan² B (which is tan² θ) has solutions for these values of B. Therefore, B can be in [π/3, π/2). When B = π/3, it&#39;s possible (as shown in the equilateral triangle case). When B approaches π/2, θ approaches π/2, so A + C approaches π/2. Then, tan A tan C approaches infinity since one of the angles approaches π/2, making its tangent approach infinity. Wait, but in that case, if θ approaches π/2, then A + C approaches π/2. So, if both A and C approach π/4, then tan A tan C approaches 1, but tan² θ approaches infinity as θ approaches π/2. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps when θ approaches π/2 (i.e., B approaches π/2), tan² θ approaches infinity, so the equation tan A tan C = tan² B requires tan A tan C to approach infinity, which would mean that either A or C approaches π/2. But since A + C = θ = π - B, which approaches π/2 as B approaches π/2. Therefore, if θ approaches π/2, then A + C approaches π/2. If one of them approaches π/2, the other approaches 0. So, for example, if A approaches π/2, then C approaches -π/2 + π/2 = 0, but angles can&#39;t be negative. Wait, more carefully: as B approaches π/2 from below, θ = π - B approaches π/2 from above. Therefore, A + C = θ approaches π/2 from above. Wait, but π/2 from above would be more than π/2, but A and C are both less than π/2. Wait, this is conflicting. Wait, θ = π - B. If B approaches π/2, θ approaches π/2. But if θ approaches π/2 from below, then A + C approaches π/2 from below. Wait, no. If B approaches π/2 from below (i.e., B approaches π/2-), then θ = π - B approaches π/2 from above (i.e., θ approaches π/2+). Therefore, A + C = θ approaches π/2+.Wait, but angles A and C must each be less than π/2. If their sum approaches π/2 from above, that would require one of them to be slightly more than π/2. But since in reality, both A and C must be less than π/2, their sum cannot exceed π. But as θ approaches π/2+, which is greater than π/2, but how can A + C be greater than π/2 if both are less than π/2? Wait, no, in reality, θ = π - B, so when B is approaching π/2, θ approaches π/2. Therefore, A + C approaches π/2. So, for example, A and C can both approach π/4, so their sum approaches π/2. But in this case, tan A tan C approaches 1, but tan² θ approaches tan²(π/2) which is infinity. Wait, this seems to be a contradiction. So perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the earlier reasoning.Wait, perhaps the discriminant condition is necessary but not sufficient? Because even if the discriminant is non-negative, there might be constraints on the solutions for x = tan A. For example, x must be positive because A is an acute angle. So, even if the quadratic equation has real roots, we need to check if the roots are positive.Let me recall the quadratic equation:x² - [tan θ(1 - tan² θ)] x + tan² θ = 0.Let me denote coefficients:a = 1,b = -tan θ(1 - tan² θ),c = tan² θ.So, the quadratic is x² + b x + c = 0.The solutions are:x = [-b ± sqrt(D)] / 2.Compute -b = tan θ(1 - tan² θ).So, solutions:x = [tan θ(1 - tan² θ) ± sqrt(D)] / 2.Recall that D = tan² θ (tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3).Wait, D = tan² θ (tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3).But earlier, we found that tan² θ ≥ 3, so tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3 = (tan² θ)^2 - 2 tan² θ - 3 ≥ 0.So, sqrt(D) = sqrt[tan² θ (tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3)] = |tan θ| sqrt(tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3).But since θ is in (π/2, π), tan θ is negative, so |tan θ| = -tan θ.Therefore, sqrt(D) = -tan θ sqrt(tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3).Therefore, the solutions are:x = [tan θ(1 - tan² θ) ± (-tan θ) sqrt(tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3)] / 2.Factor tan θ:x = tan θ [ (1 - tan² θ) ∓ sqrt(tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3) ] / 2.But tan θ is negative, so let&#39;s write:x = [ negative term ] / 2.We need x to be positive because x = tan A &gt; 0.Therefore, the numerator must be negative. Let&#39;s check the two solutions:First solution with &#39;+&#39; sign:x1 = tan θ [ (1 - tan² θ) + sqrt(tan⁴ θ - 2 tan² θ - 3) ] / 2.Since tan θ is negative, and sqrt(...) is positive, we need the term in brackets to be positive to make x1 positive?Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe let&#39;s plug in specific values.Take B = π/3, so θ = 2π/3, tan θ = -sqrt(3), tan² θ = 3.Then the quadratic equation becomes:x² - [ -sqrt(3)(1 - 3) ] x + 3 = x² - [ -sqrt(3)(-2) ] x + 3 = x² - 2 sqrt(3) x + 3 = 0.Solutions:x = [2 sqrt(3) ± sqrt(12 - 12)] / 2 = [2 sqrt(3) ± 0]/2 = sqrt(3).Therefore, x = sqrt(3), so tan A = sqrt(3) =&gt; A = π/3. Then C = θ - A = 2π/3 - π/3 = π/3. So, both angles are π/3, which works.Now take B = π/4, which is not in the supposed range. Then θ = 3π/4, tan θ = -1, tan² θ = 1.Then the quadratic equation is:x² - [ -1(1 - 1) ]x + 1 = x² - 0 x + 1 = x² + 1 = 0.Solutions are x = ±i, which are not real. Therefore, no solution exists for B = π/4, which is consistent with our previous result that B must be ≥ π/3.Take B = 5π/12 (which is 75 degrees), θ = π - 5π/12 = 7π/12, tan θ = tan(7π/12) = tan(105°) = -2 - sqrt(3). Therefore, tan² θ = (2 + sqrt(3))² = 4 + 4 sqrt(3) + 3 = 7 + 4 sqrt(3).Then the quadratic equation:x² - [ - (2 + sqrt(3))(1 - (7 + 4 sqrt(3))) ]x + 7 + 4 sqrt(3) = ?First, compute 1 - tan² θ = 1 - (7 + 4 sqrt(3)) = -6 - 4 sqrt(3).Then,x² - [ - (2 + sqrt(3))(-6 - 4 sqrt(3)) ]x + 7 + 4 sqrt(3).Compute the middle term:- (2 + sqrt(3))(-6 - 4 sqrt(3)) = (2 + sqrt(3))(6 + 4 sqrt(3)).Multiply these out:2*6 + 2*4 sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)*6 + sqrt(3)*4 sqrt(3) = 12 + 8 sqrt(3) + 6 sqrt(3) + 12 = 24 + 14 sqrt(3).Therefore, the quadratic equation is:x² - (24 + 14 sqrt(3))x + 7 + 4 sqrt(3) = 0.Compute the discriminant:D = (24 + 14 sqrt(3))² - 4 * 1 * (7 + 4 sqrt(3)).First, (24 + 14 sqrt(3))² = 24² + 2*24*14 sqrt(3) + (14 sqrt(3))² = 576 + 672 sqrt(3) + 588 = 1164 + 672 sqrt(3).Then, 4*(7 + 4 sqrt(3)) = 28 + 16 sqrt(3).Therefore, D = 1164 + 672 sqrt(3) - 28 - 16 sqrt(3) = 1136 + 656 sqrt(3).Which is positive, so real roots exist. Now, let&#39;s compute approximate values to check if x is positive.tan θ = - (2 + sqrt(3)) ≈ -3.732.Compute the quadratic equation:x² - (24 + 14*1.732)x + 7 + 4*1.732 ≈ x² - (24 + 24.248)x + 7 + 6.928 ≈ x² - 48.248x + 13.928.The solutions are x = [48.248 ± sqrt(48.248² - 4*13.928)] / 2.Compute discriminant:48.248² ≈ 2328, 4*13.928 ≈ 55.71.So sqrt(2328 - 55.71) ≈ sqrt(2272.29) ≈ 47.67.Thus, x ≈ [48.248 ± 47.67]/2.First solution: (48.248 + 47.67)/2 ≈ 95.918/2 ≈ 47.959.Second solution: (48.248 - 47.67)/2 ≈ 0.578/2 ≈ 0.289.Both solutions are positive. Therefore, tan A ≈ 47.959 or tan A ≈ 0.289.But A must satisfy A + C = 7π/12 ≈ 1.8326 radians ≈ 105 degrees.If tan A,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this trigonometry problem here. It says in triangle ABC, the sum of the logarithms (base 10, I assume) of the tangent of angle A and the logarithm of the tangent of angle C is equal to twice the logarithm of the tangent of angle B. Then I need to find the range of angle B from the given options. The answer choices are intervals from 0 to π/3, π/3 to π/2, 0 to π/6, and π/6 to π/2. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.First, let&#39;s parse the equation they gave: lg tg A + lg tg C = 2 lg tg B. Since &quot;tg&quot; is probably tangent, and &quot;lg&quot; is logarithm base 10. So in more standard notation, that would be log(tan A) + log(tan C) = 2 log(tan B). Using logarithm properties, log(tan A) + log(tan C) is the same as log(tan A * tan C). So that would be equal to 2 log(tan B), which is log(tan B)^2. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as log(tan A * tan C) = log(tan B)^2. Since logarithm is a one-to-one function, the arguments must be equal. Therefore, tan A * tan C = (tan B)^2.So now, the key equation is tan A * tan C = (tan B)^2. Now, since we&#39;re dealing with a triangle, angles A, B, and C must satisfy A + B + C = π. So maybe we can express angles A and C in terms of B, or something like that. Let&#39;s see.Let me denote angles as A, B, C with A + B + C = π. So A + C = π - B. Maybe we can use that to relate A and C. Since in the equation we have tan A * tan C, perhaps we can express this product in terms of B.Recall that in a triangle, if A + C = π - B, then perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities involving the tangent of sums or products. Let&#39;s recall that tan(A + C) = tan(π - B) = -tan B. But tan(A + C) is equal to (tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan A tan C). Therefore, we have:(tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan A tan C) = -tan B.But from our earlier equation, tan A tan C = (tan B)^2. Let&#39;s substitute that into the denominator:(tan A + tan C)/(1 - (tan B)^2) = -tan B.Therefore, tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - (tan B)^2).But tan A and tan C are positive because in a triangle, angles are between 0 and π, so angles A and C are between 0 and π, but in reality, since it&#39;s a triangle, each angle is less than π, and since the sum is π - B, which is less than π. So angles A and C are each less than π, but also greater than 0. Therefore, their tangents are positive if the angles are acute (less than π/2) or negative if they are obtuse (greater than π/2). However, in a triangle, only one angle can be obtuse. So if angle B is obtuse, then A and C must be acute. If angle B is acute, then one of A or C could be obtuse. But in that case, the tangent of an obtuse angle is negative. However, in the original equation, we have log(tan A) and log(tan C). The logarithm of a negative number is undefined in real numbers, so this implies that tan A and tan C must be positive. Therefore, angles A and C must be acute, meaning less than π/2. Similarly, angle B must also be acute because if angle B were obtuse, then angles A and C would have to be acute, but then tan B would be negative, and log(tan B) would be undefined. Therefore, all angles in the triangle must be acute. So angles A, B, C are all less than π/2. Therefore, triangle ABC is an acute triangle.So given that all angles are acute, we can proceed.So we have tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan^2 B). Wait, but tan B is positive because angle B is acute. Then why is there a negative sign on the right-hand side? Let&#39;s check that again.We had tan(A + C) = tan(π - B) = -tan B. Then, tan(A + C) = (tan A + tan C)/(1 - tan A tan C) = -tan B. So cross-multiplying, tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan A tan C). So substituting tan A tan C = tan^2 B, we get:tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan^2 B).But tan B is positive, so the right-hand side is -tan B (1 - tan^2 B). However, the left-hand side, tan A + tan C, is the sum of two positive numbers (since angles A and C are acute, their tangents are positive). Therefore, the right-hand side must also be positive. So we have:tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan^2 B) &gt; 0.Therefore, -tan B (1 - tan^2 B) &gt; 0. Let&#39;s analyze this inequality.First, since tan B &gt; 0 (because angle B is acute), the sign of the right-hand side depends on -(1 - tan^2 B). So:-tan B (1 - tan^2 B) &gt; 0Since tan B &gt; 0, we can divide both sides by tan B without changing the inequality:-(1 - tan^2 B) &gt; 0 =&gt; -1 + tan^2 B &gt; 0 =&gt; tan^2 B &gt; 1 =&gt; |tan B| &gt; 1.But tan B is positive, so tan B &gt; 1. Therefore, angle B must satisfy tan B &gt; 1. Since angle B is acute (less than π/2), tan B &gt; 1 implies that angle B &gt; π/4. Because tan(π/4) = 1, and tangent is increasing on (0, π/2). So angle B is greater than π/4. So angle B is in (π/4, π/2).But wait, the answer options don&#39;t include π/4. The options are from 0 to π/3, π/3 to π/2, 0 to π/6, π/6 to π/2. Hmm. So my current conclusion is that angle B is between π/4 and π/2, but none of the options have π/4. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check again.Starting from the equation:tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan^2 B)But since tan A and tan C are positive, then the right-hand side must also be positive. So:-tan B (1 - tan^2 B) &gt; 0As tan B is positive, then:-(1 - tan^2 B) &gt; 0 =&gt; tan^2 B - 1 &gt; 0 =&gt; tan^2 B &gt; 1 =&gt; tan B &gt; 1 or tan B &lt; -1But tan B is positive, so tan B &gt; 1. Therefore, angle B is in (π/4, π/2). But the answer options don&#39;t include π/4. However, maybe the answer is a subset of this interval. Let&#39;s check the options:(A) 0 &lt; angle B ≤ π/3 (≈1.047)(B) π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2 (≈1.570)(C) 0 &lt; angle B ≤ π/6 (≈0.523)(D) π/6 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2So π/4 is approximately 0.785 radians. So (π/4, π/2) is a subset of (π/6, π/2), which is option D. But my conclusion is that angle B must be greater than π/4, but the options don&#39;t include that. So perhaps there&#39;s another condition that further restricts angle B.Wait, maybe I need to explore the relationship between angles A, B, and C more carefully. Let&#39;s recall that A + C = π - B, and we have tan A * tan C = (tan B)^2. Maybe we can use some trigonometric identities here.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality. Since A and C are two angles adding up to π - B, their product tan A * tan C is equal to (tan B)^2. Maybe express tan A and tan C in terms of π - B.Alternatively, set variables. Let’s denote A = x, C = y. Then x + y = π - B. We have tan x tan y = (tan B)^2. We need to relate x and y to B. Let me see.We can use the identity for tan x tan y. Let me recall that tan x + tan y = tan(x + y)(1 - tan x tan y). Wait, that&#39;s similar to what we had earlier. Wait, yes, since x + y = π - B, then tan(x + y) = tan(π - B) = -tan B. So tan x + tan y = -tan B (1 - tan x tan y). But from the given condition, tan x tan y = (tan B)^2. Therefore, substituting, tan x + tan y = -tan B (1 - (tan B)^2). But as established earlier, this leads to the conclusion that tan B &gt; 1. So angle B &gt; π/4.But given the answer options, which don&#39;t include π/4, maybe I need to check if there&#39;s a mistake in my reasoning or if the options are using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a maximum value for angle B?Wait, since all angles must be acute, angle B must be less than π/2. So angle B is in (π/4, π/2). But the answer options are (A) up to π/3, (B) π/3 to π/2, (C) up to π/6, (D) π/6 to π/2. So if our conclusion is that angle B must be greater than π/4, which is approximately 0.785, then within the answer options, the interval (π/4, π/2) is included in option B (π/3 ≈1.047 to π/2) and option D (π/6 ≈0.523 to π/2). But π/4 is approximately 0.785, which is between π/6 and π/3. So if the minimal value is π/4, but the options don&#39;t have π/4, but we need to select from the given options, maybe the answer is (B) π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2. But why? Alternatively, perhaps my initial conclusion is wrong. Let me check again.Let me start over. Maybe using another approach. Let me consider that in triangle ABC, angles A, B, C are all acute. Let me express angles A and C as A = π/2 - α and C = π/2 - γ, where α and γ are positive angles such that A + C = π - B. Then:A + C = (π/2 - α) + (π/2 - γ) = π - (α + γ) = π - B.Therefore, α + γ = B. Then, tan A = tan(π/2 - α) = cot α, and tan C = tan(π/2 - γ) = cot γ. So the equation tan A tan C = (tan B)^2 becomes cot α cot γ = (tan B)^2. Since α + γ = B, maybe we can express cot α cot γ in terms of B. Let&#39;s recall that:cot α cot γ = [cos α / sin α][cos γ / sin γ] = (cos α cos γ) / (sin α sin γ).Alternatively, using the identity for cot α cot γ. Let me think. Since α + γ = B, perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities here. Let me recall that cot α cot γ = [cot α cot γ] = [cot α cot γ]. Maybe using sum and product. Let me denote α and γ such that α + γ = B. Let me set variables for α and γ as x and y, where x + y = B. Then, cot x cot y = ?Alternatively, use the identity for cot(x + y). cot(x + y) = (cot x cot y - 1)/(cot x + cot y). Since x + y = B, then cot B = (cot x cot y - 1)/(cot x + cot y). But from our problem, cot x cot y = (tan B)^2. Let me write that:cot x cot y = tan^2 B = (sin^2 B)/(cos^2 B).Also, from the identity:cot B = (cot x cot y - 1)/(cot x + cot y)Substituting cot x cot y = tan^2 B:cot B = (tan^2 B - 1)/(cot x + cot y)Let me solve for cot x + cot y:cot x + cot y = (tan^2 B - 1)/cot BBut cot B = cos B / sin B, so:cot x + cot y = (tan^2 B - 1) * (sin B / cos B) = [ (sin^2 B / cos^2 B) - 1 ] * (sin B / cos B ) = [ (sin^2 B - cos^2 B)/cos^2 B ] * (sin B / cos B ) = [ -cos(2B) / cos^2 B ] * (sin B / cos B )But this seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way. Alternatively, express cot x + cot y in terms of x and y.cot x + cot y = (cos x / sin x) + (cos y / sin y) = (cos x sin y + cos y sin x)/(sin x sin y) = sin(x + y)/(sin x sin y) = sin B / (sin x sin y)So we have:cot x + cot y = sin B / (sin x sin y)From the previous equation:cot x + cot y = (tan^2 B - 1)/cot B = (tan^2 B - 1) * tan B = [ (sin^2 B / cos^2 B ) - 1 ] * (sin B / cos B ) = [ (sin^2 B - cos^2 B)/cos^2 B ] * (sin B / cos B ) = [ -cos(2B)/cos^2 B ] * (sin B / cos B )Wait, this is getting too involved. Maybe instead of substituting, let&#39;s consider that cot x cot y = tan^2 B and we need to relate this to x + y = B.Alternatively, consider that x and y are positive angles adding up to B. Let me use substitution. Let x = B/2 + t, y = B/2 - t, where t is some parameter. Then, cot x cot y = cot(B/2 + t) cot(B/2 - t). Let me compute this.cot(B/2 + t) cot(B/2 - t) = [cos(B/2 + t)/sin(B/2 + t)] [cos(B/2 - t)/sin(B/2 - t)].Using the identities for cosine and sine of sum and difference:cos(B/2 + t) cos(B/2 - t) = [cos B/2 cos t - sin B/2 sin t][cos B/2 cos t + sin B/2 sin t] = (cos B/2 cos t)^2 - (sin B/2 sin t)^2 = cos^2 B/2 cos^2 t - sin^2 B/2 sin^2 t.Similarly, sin(B/2 + t) sin(B/2 - t) = [sin B/2 cos t + cos B/2 sin t][sin B/2 cos t - cos B/2 sin t] = (sin B/2 cos t)^2 - (cos B/2 sin t)^2 = sin^2 B/2 cos^2 t - cos^2 B/2 sin^2 t.Therefore, cot x cot y = [cos^2 B/2 cos^2 t - sin^2 B/2 sin^2 t] / [sin^2 B/2 cos^2 t - cos^2 B/2 sin^2 t]Let me factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: cos^2 B/2 cos^2 t - sin^2 B/2 sin^2 t = cos^2 t cos^2 B/2 - sin^2 t sin^2 B/2Denominator: sin^2 B/2 cos^2 t - cos^2 B/2 sin^2 t = cos^2 t sin^2 B/2 - sin^2 t cos^2 B/2This seems messy. Maybe there&#39;s a trigonometric identity that can simplify cot x cot y when x + y = B.Alternatively, use the identity for cot x cot y when x + y = B. Let me see. Let me recall that:cot x cot y = [cos x cos y]/[sin x sin y]But using product-to-sum formulas:cos x cos y = [cos(x + y) + cos(x - y)]/2 = [cos B + cos(x - y)]/2sin x sin y = [cos(x - y) - cos(x + y)]/2 = [cos(x - y) - cos B]/2Therefore,cot x cot y = [ [cos B + cos(x - y)]/2 ] / [ [cos(x - y) - cos B]/2 ] = [cos B + cos(x - y)] / [cos(x - y) - cos B]Let me set u = cos(x - y). Then,cot x cot y = (cos B + u)/(u - cos B)But from our problem, cot x cot y = tan^2 B. Therefore,(cos B + u)/(u - cos B) = tan^2 BCross-multiplying:cos B + u = tan^2 B (u - cos B)cos B + u = tan^2 B u - tan^2 B cos BBring all terms with u to one side:u - tan^2 B u = - tan^2 B cos B - cos Bu(1 - tan^2 B) = -cos B (tan^2 B + 1)Solve for u:u = [ -cos B (tan^2 B + 1) ] / (1 - tan^2 B )Note that tan^2 B + 1 = sec^2 B = 1 / cos^2 B. Therefore,u = [ -cos B * (1 / cos^2 B) ] / (1 - tan^2 B ) = [ -1 / cos B ] / (1 - tan^2 B )But 1 - tan^2 B = (cos^2 B - sin^2 B)/cos^2 B = cos(2B)/cos^2 B. Therefore,u = [ -1 / cos B ] / [ cos(2B)/cos^2 B ] = [ -1 / cos B ] * [ cos^2 B / cos(2B) ] = -cos B / cos(2B)But u = cos(x - y). Therefore,cos(x - y) = -cos B / cos(2B)But cos(x - y) must be in [-1, 1]. Let&#39;s analyze this expression:cos(x - y) = -cos B / cos(2B)We need to find the conditions on B such that this equality is possible. Since x and y are angles such that x + y = B, x and y are both positive and less than B. Therefore, the difference x - y can vary between -B and B. So cos(x - y) ranges from cos B (if x - y = ±B, but since x and y are positive and sum to B, the maximum difference is B - 0 = B, but actually, since x and y are both positive and sum to B, the maximum difference is B - 2*0 = B, but in reality, when one is B and the other is 0, but in our case, angles x and y are parts of angles A and C which must be positive. So x and y are in (0, B). So the difference x - y is in (-B, B). Thus, cos(x - y) is in (cos B, 1], since the maximum value is 1 (when x = y) and the minimum is cos B (when the difference is B or -B). Wait, actually, cos(x - y) when x - y varies from -B to B, the cosine will vary between cos B and 1. Because the cosine function is even, so cos(-θ) = cos θ. The maximum value is 1 when x - y = 0, and the minimum is cos B when x - y = ±B. But since x and y are both positive and sum to B, x - y cannot actually reach ±B unless one of them is B and the other is 0, which isn&#39;t allowed in a triangle. So the actual range of cos(x - y) is (cos B, 1). Because x and y are in (0, B), the difference x - y is in (-B, B), but x and y can&#39;t be 0 or B, so the difference can&#39;t be exactly ±B. Therefore, cos(x - y) is in (cos B, 1).So we have cos(x - y) = -cos B / cos(2B) must be in (cos B, 1). Therefore, the right-hand side must satisfy:cos B &lt; -cos B / cos(2B) &lt; 1.Let&#39;s analyze these inequalities.First, cos(2B) is involved. Let&#39;s note that angle B is in (π/4, π/2) as previously deduced. So 2B is in (π/2, π). Therefore, cos(2B) is negative because 2B is in the second quadrant. So cos(2B) &lt; 0. Therefore, -cos B / cos(2B) is positive because numerator and denominator are both negative (cos B is positive since B is acute, cos(2B) is negative). So the right-hand side is positive. Since cos(x - y) is between cos B and 1, which are both positive because B is acute (so cos B is positive). So the RHS must be in (cos B, 1).Therefore, we have two inequalities:1. -cos B / cos(2B) &gt; cos B2. -cos B / cos(2B) &lt; 1Let&#39;s solve the first inequality:-cos B / cos(2B) &gt; cos BMultiply both sides by cos(2B). But cos(2B) is negative, so inequality sign flips:-cos B &lt; cos B * cos(2B)Divide both sides by cos B (positive, so inequality sign remains):-1 &lt; cos(2B)But since 2B is in (π/2, π), cos(2B) is in (-1, 0). Therefore, -1 &lt; cos(2B) &lt; 0. Therefore, the inequality -1 &lt; cos(2B) is always true. So this first inequality doesn&#39;t give any new information.Second inequality:-cos B / cos(2B) &lt; 1Again, multiply both sides by cos(2B). Since cos(2B) is negative, inequality flips:-cos B &gt; cos(2B)Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips again):cos B &lt; -cos(2B)Now, let&#39;s express -cos(2B). Since cos(2B) = 2 cos^2 B - 1, so -cos(2B) = -2 cos^2 B + 1.So the inequality becomes:cos B &lt; -2 cos^2 B + 1Bring all terms to one side:2 cos^2 B + cos B - 1 &lt; 0Let me set x = cos B. Then the inequality is:2x^2 + x - 1 &lt; 0Solve the quadratic inequality 2x^2 + x - 1 &lt; 0.First, find roots of 2x^2 + x - 1 = 0.Using quadratic formula:x = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 8) ] / 4 = [ -1 ± 3 ] / 4.So roots are x = (2)/4 = 0.5 and x = (-4)/4 = -1.So the quadratic 2x^2 + x -1 factors as (2x - 1)(x + 1). The quadratic is positive outside the roots and negative between them. Since x = cos B, which is in (0, 1) because angle B is acute (between 0 and π/2). So x is in (0, 1). The roots are at x = 0.5 and x = -1. Therefore, in the interval (0, 1), the quadratic is negative between x = -1 and x = 0.5. But since x is in (0,1), the inequality 2x^2 + x -1 &lt;0 holds for x ∈ (-1, 0.5). Intersecting with x ∈ (0,1), we get x ∈ (0, 0.5). Therefore, cos B &lt; 0.5. Which implies angle B &gt; π/3, since cos(π/3) = 0.5, and cosine is decreasing in (0, π/2).Therefore, combining with the previous result that angle B &gt; π/4, we now have angle B &gt; π/3. Therefore, angle B must be in (π/3, π/2).Therefore, the range of angle B is π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2, which is option B.Wait, but we concluded angle B &gt; π/3, but in the quadratic inequality solution, cos B &lt; 0.5 implies B &gt; π/3. So since angle B must be greater than π/3 and less than π/2, the range is (π/3, π/2). Since the options are inclusive, option B is π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2. So the answer is B.But let me check this conclusion again.Starting from the quadratic inequality, we found that cos B &lt; 0.5, which gives B &gt; π/3. But angle B must also be greater than π/4 from the earlier step. So combining both conditions, angle B must be in (π/3, π/2). Therefore, the correct interval is π/3 to π/2, which is option B. So the answer should be option B.But let me verify this with an example. Let&#39;s take angle B = π/3. Then check if the original equation holds.If angle B = π/3, then tan B = tan(π/3) = √3. Then 2 lg tan B = 2 lg √3 ≈ 2 * 0.2386 ≈ 0.4772.Then angles A and C must satisfy A + C = π - π/3 = 2π/3. And tan A tan C = (tan B)^2 = 3.Let me pick A = C = π/3. Then tan A tan C = (tan π/3)^2 = 3, which matches. Then lg tan A + lg tan C = 2 lg tan π/3 ≈ 0.4772, which equals 2 lg tan B. So when B = π/3, the equation holds. So angle B can be equal to π/3. Wait, but earlier, we concluded angle B must be greater than π/3. But in this case, when B = π/3, the equation holds. So perhaps the correct interval includes π/3.But according to the quadratic inequality, we have cos B &lt; 0.5, which gives B &gt; π/3. However, when B = π/3, cos B = 0.5, and the inequality becomes 2*(0.5)^2 + 0.5 -1 = 2*0.25 + 0.5 -1 = 0.5 +0.5 -1 = 0. So at B = π/3, the inequality 2x^2 +x -1 &lt;0 becomes equal to zero. Therefore, equality holds when B = π/3. But in the original problem statement, the equation is lg tan A + lg tan C = 2 lg tan B. When B = π/3, A = C = π/3, which satisfies tan A tan C = 3 = (tan B)^2. So the equation holds. Therefore, angle B can be equal to π/3. Therefore, the range should include π/3. Hence, the interval is [π/3, π/2). So option B.Therefore, after thorough analysis, the range of angle B is π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2, which is option B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem in triangle ( triangle ABC ), we need to find the range of ( angle B ) given the equation ( lg operatorname{tg} A + lg operatorname{tg} C = 2 lg operatorname{tg} B ).1. Logarithmic to Exponential Form:   [   log(tan A) + log(tan C) = 2 log(tan B)   ]   Using logarithm properties, this converts to:   [   log(tan A cdot tan C) = log((tan B)^2)   ]   Therefore:   [   tan A cdot tan C = (tan B)^2   ]2. Sum of Angles:   In a triangle, ( A + B + C = pi ), so ( A + C = pi - B ).3. Tangent Addition Formula:   Using the identity for tangent of a sum:   [   tan(A + C) = tan(pi - B) = -tan B   ]   [   frac{tan A + tan C}{1 - tan A tan C} = -tan B   ]   Substituting ( tan A tan C = (tan B)^2 ):   [   frac{tan A + tan C}{1 - (tan B)^2} = -tan B   ]   [   tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - (tan B)^2)   ]4. Positivity and Inequalities:   Since ( tan A ) and ( tan C ) are positive, the right-hand side must also be positive:   [   -tan B (1 - (tan B)^2) &gt; 0   ]   This implies:   [   tan B &gt; 1 implies B &gt; frac{pi}{4}   ]5. Quadratic Inequality:   Using the identity for cosine of double angle and solving the quadratic inequality:   [   2 cos^2 B + cos B - 1 &lt; 0   ]   Solving this gives:   [   cos B &lt; 0.5 implies B &gt; frac{pi}{3}   ]6. Conclusion:   Combining the results, ( angle B ) must satisfy ( frac{pi}{3} leq angle B &lt; frac{pi}{2} ).Thus, the range of ( angle B ) is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem says in triangle ABC, the logarithm of the tangent of angle A plus the logarithm of the tangent of angle C equals twice the logarithm of the tangent of angle B. And we need to find the range of angle B from the given options.First, I need to recall some properties of triangles and trigonometric identities. In any triangle, the sum of the angles is π radians. So, A + B + C = π. That might come in handy later.The equation given is lg tg A + lg tg C = 2 lg tg B. Let me parse that. &quot;lg&quot; is logarithm base 10, and &quot;tg&quot; is tangent. So, in terms of natural logarithm, it&#39;s the same idea, but the base doesn&#39;t really matter here because we can manipulate the equation using logarithm properties.So, log(tan A) + log(tan C) = 2 log(tan B). Using the logarithm property that log a + log b = log(ab), the left side becomes log(tan A * tan C). The right side is 2 log(tan B), which is log(tan B)^2. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:log(tan A * tan C) = log(tan B)^2Since logarithm is a one-to-one function, if log(x) = log(y), then x = y. So, we can drop the logs:tan A * tan C = (tan B)^2So, the equation is tan A * tan C = tan² B.Now, we need to relate angles A, B, and C. Since A + B + C = π, we can express A and C in terms of B. Let&#39;s write A + C = π - B. Maybe we can use some trigonometric identity here.Let me think. If A + C = π - B, then perhaps we can express tan(A) * tan(C) in terms of B. There&#39;s an identity for tan(A + C), which is tan(π - B). Let&#39;s recall that tan(π - x) = -tan x. So, tan(A + C) = tan(π - B) = -tan B.But tan(A + C) can also be written as [tan A + tan C] / [1 - tan A tan C]. So,tan(A + C) = [tan A + tan C] / [1 - tan A tan C] = -tan BWe already know that tan A * tan C = tan² B. Let me denote tan A * tan C = tan² B as equation (1). Let me denote the other equation as:[tan A + tan C] / [1 - tan A tan C] = -tan BSubstituting equation (1) into this, we get:[tan A + tan C] / [1 - tan² B] = -tan BMultiply both sides by (1 - tan² B):tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan² B) = -tan B + tan³ BBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there&#39;s another way. Let&#39;s try to express tan A and tan C in terms of angles related to B.Since A + C = π - B, perhaps we can let A = (π - B)/2 + t and C = (π - B)/2 - t for some t. This way, A + C = π - B, which satisfies the angle sum. Then, we can express tan A and tan C in terms of t and B.Let me try that. Let A = (π - B)/2 + t and C = (π - B)/2 - t. Then, tan A * tan C = tan[(π - B)/2 + t] * tan[(π - B)/2 - t]Using the identity tan(x + y) * tan(x - y) = [tan² x - tan² y] / [1 - tan² x tan² y], but maybe another approach is better.Alternatively, using the formula tan(p + q) * tan(p - q) = [tan p + tan q][tan p - tan q] / [1 - tan² p tan² q], but that might not help. Alternatively, use the identity tan x * tan y when x + y = something.Wait, maybe we can use the formula for tan A * tan C in terms of A + C and A - C. Hmm.Alternatively, let me write A = (π - B)/2 + t and C = (π - B)/2 - t, then tan A * tan C = [ tan((π - B)/2 + t) ] * [ tan((π - B)/2 - t) ]Recall that tan(π/2 - x) = cot x, so tan((π - B)/2 + t) = tan(π/2 - B/2 + t) = cot(B/2 - t). Similarly, tan((π - B)/2 - t) = tan(π/2 - B/2 - t) = cot(B/2 + t). So, the product becomes cot(B/2 - t) * cot(B/2 + t)Which is [cos(B/2 - t)/sin(B/2 - t)] * [cos(B/2 + t)/sin(B/2 + t)] = [cos(B/2 - t)cos(B/2 + t)] / [sin(B/2 - t)sin(B/2 + t)]Using the identities for cos(a - b)cos(a + b) and sin(a - b)sin(a + b):cos(B/2 - t)cos(B/2 + t) = [cos(B/2)cos t + sin(B/2)sin t][cos(B/2)cos t - sin(B/2)sin t] = cos²(B/2)cos² t - sin²(B/2)sin² tSimilarly, sin(B/2 - t)sin(B/2 + t) = [sin(B/2)cos t - cos(B/2)sin t][sin(B/2)cos t + cos(B/2)sin t] = sin²(B/2)cos² t - cos²(B/2)sin² tHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a simpler identity. Let me recall that cos A cos B = [cos(A + B) + cos(A - B)] / 2 and sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2. Similarly for the products in numerator and denominator.Wait, perhaps using the identity:cos x cos y = [cos(x + y) + cos(x - y)] / 2sin x sin y = [cos(x - y) - cos(x + y)] / 2So, numerator:cos(B/2 - t)cos(B/2 + t) = [cos((B/2 - t) + (B/2 + t)) + cos((B/2 - t) - (B/2 + t))]/2= [cos B + cos(-2t)] / 2 = [cos B + cos 2t] / 2Denominator:sin(B/2 - t)sin(B/2 + t) = [cos((B/2 - t) - (B/2 + t)) - cos((B/2 - t) + (B/2 + t))]/2= [cos(-2t) - cos B] / 2 = [cos 2t - cos B] / 2Therefore, the product tan A tan C becomes [ (cos B + cos 2t)/2 ] / [ (cos 2t - cos B)/2 ] = (cos B + cos 2t) / (cos 2t - cos B)But from equation (1), tan A tan C = tan² B. So,(cos B + cos 2t) / (cos 2t - cos B) = tan² BLet me rearrange this:(cos B + cos 2t) = tan² B (cos 2t - cos B)Let me bring all terms to one side:cos B + cos 2t - tan² B cos 2t + tan² B cos B = 0Factor terms with cos 2t and cos B:cos B (1 + tan² B) + cos 2t (1 - tan² B) = 0Recall that 1 + tan² x = sec² x, so:cos B * sec² B + cos 2t (1 - tan² B) = 0Simplify:cos B / cos² B + cos 2t (1 - tan² B) = 0Which is:1 / cos B + cos 2t (1 - tan² B) = 0Hmm, this is getting a bit involved. Maybe there&#39;s another approach. Let&#39;s think back.We have tan A tan C = tan² B. Also, A + C = π - B. Maybe we can use the formula for tan(A + C) as before.We know that tan(A + C) = -tan B, and A + C = π - B. So,tan(A + C) = (tan A + tan C) / (1 - tan A tan C) = -tan BBut from tan A tan C = tan² B, substitute into the denominator:(tan A + tan C) / (1 - tan² B) = -tan BMultiply both sides by (1 - tan² B):tan A + tan C = -tan B (1 - tan² B) = -tan B + tan³ BSo,tan A + tan C = tan³ B - tan BBut we also have tan A tan C = tan² BSo, if we let tan A and tan C be the roots of the quadratic equation x² - (tan³ B - tan B)x + tan² B = 0Wait, that is, if we consider tan A and tan C as variables, then they satisfy:x² - (sum)x + product = 0 =&gt; x² - (tan³ B - tan B)x + tan² B = 0But for real roots to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative.So discriminant D = (tan³ B - tan B)^2 - 4 * 1 * tan² B ≥ 0Let&#39;s compute that:D = (tan³ B - tan B)^2 - 4 tan² BFactor tan B:= [tan B (tan² B - 1)]^2 - 4 tan² B= tan² B (tan² B - 1)^2 - 4 tan² BFactor tan² B:= tan² B [ (tan² B - 1)^2 - 4 ]Let me compute (tan² B - 1)^2 - 4:= (tan^4 B - 2 tan² B + 1) - 4= tan^4 B - 2 tan² B - 3So, discriminant D = tan² B (tan^4 B - 2 tan² B - 3)For D to be non-negative, tan² B (tan^4 B - 2 tan² B - 3) ≥ 0Note that tan² B is always non-negative since square of tangent. So the sign of D depends on the second factor: tan^4 B - 2 tan² B - 3Let me set y = tan² B, so the second factor becomes y² - 2y - 3.We need y² - 2y - 3 ≥ 0Solve the quadratic inequality:y² - 2y - 3 ≥ 0Find roots:y = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2So, y = (2 + 4)/2 = 3, y = (2 - 4)/2 = -1So, the quadratic is positive when y ≤ -1 or y ≥ 3. However, since y = tan² B, y is non-negative. So, y ≥ 3Therefore, tan² B ≥ 3 =&gt; |tan B| ≥ sqrt(3) =&gt; tan B ≥ sqrt(3) or tan B ≤ -sqrt(3)But in a triangle, angles are between 0 and π, so B is between 0 and π. Also, in a triangle, each angle is less than π, so B is between 0 and π. Since it&#39;s a triangle, angles are positive and sum to π. Therefore, B is between 0 and π, but tan B can be positive or negative depending on B. Wait, but in a triangle, each angle is between 0 and π, so tan B is positive when B is acute (0 &lt; B &lt; π/2) and negative when B is obtuse (π/2 &lt; B &lt; π). However, if B is obtuse, then angles A and C must be acute, so their tangents are positive. Then the original equation would have log(tan A) and log(tan C) as real numbers only if tan A and tan C are positive, which they are, but log(tan B) would be log(negative number), which is undefined. Therefore, B cannot be obtuse because tan B would be negative, and logarithm of a negative number is undefined. Therefore, B must be acute, i.e., 0 &lt; B &lt; π/2, so tan B is positive. Therefore, the inequality tan² B ≥ 3 implies tan B ≥ sqrt(3). Therefore, tan B ≥ sqrt(3), which implies B ≥ π/3, since tan(π/3) = sqrt(3). But since B is acute, π/3 ≤ B &lt; π/2. But let&#39;s check this.Wait, tan B ≥ sqrt(3) implies that B ≥ π/3 because tan(π/3) = sqrt(3) and tan is increasing in (0, π/2). Therefore, the range for B is π/3 ≤ B &lt; π/2. But let&#39;s check the answer options. Option B is π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2, which would be the case here. Option D is π/6 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2. So, the answer should be B?Wait, but let me verify this again step by step.We started with the equation log(tan A) + log(tan C) = 2 log(tan B). Therefore, tan A * tan C = tan² B. Then, using angle sum identity, we derived that tan A + tan C = tan³ B - tan B. Then, considering the discriminant of the quadratic equation for tan A and tan C, we found that tan² B ≥ 3. Therefore, tan B ≥ sqrt(3) or tan B ≤ -sqrt(3). But since B is an acute angle, tan B is positive, so tan B ≥ sqrt(3) which implies B ≥ π/3. Since B is acute, B must be in [π/3, π/2). Therefore, the range is π/3 ≤ angle B &lt; π/2, which is option B.But let&#39;s make sure there are no mistakes in the reasoning. For example, when solving the discriminant, we set y = tan² B, got the inequality y² - 2y - 3 ≥ 0, which gives y ≥ 3 (since y cannot be negative). So tan² B ≥ 3, tan B ≥ sqrt(3) or tan B ≤ -sqrt(3). But since B is between 0 and π/2 (acute), tan B is positive, so tan B ≥ sqrt(3), which gives B ≥ π/3. Hence, the range is π/3 ≤ B &lt; π/2, which is option B.But let&#39;s also think about the edge cases. If B = π/3, then tan B = sqrt(3). Then tan² B = 3. Then, tan A * tan C = 3. Also, A + C = π - π/3 = 2π/3. Let&#39;s see if such angles exist. Let me pick A = C = π/3. Then, A + C = 2π/3, which works. Then tan A tan C = (tan π/3)^2 = (sqrt(3))² = 3, which matches tan² B. So, this is possible.If B approaches π/2, then tan B approaches infinity. Then tan A * tan C would approach infinity squared. But A and C would approach 0 and π/2 - ε or something. Wait, if B approaches π/2, then A + C approaches π - π/2 = π/2. So, A and C are approaching 0 and π/2. Then tan A approaches 0 and tan C approaches infinity, so their product is 0 * infinity, which is indeterminate. But let&#39;s see:Suppose B approaches π/2, so B = π/2 - ε, where ε is very small. Then A + C = π - B = π/2 + ε. Suppose A = ε and C = π/2. Then tan A = tan ε ≈ ε, tan C = tan(π/2) which is undefined. Alternatively, if C approaches π/2, then tan C approaches infinity, but A approaches 0, so tan A approaches 0. So tan A * tan C approaches 0 * infinity. To resolve this, let&#39;s take A = δ and C = π/2 + ε - δ, but this is getting too vague. Maybe instead, consider specific values.Suppose B is approaching π/2, say B = π/2 - ε. Then, A + C = π - B = π/2 + ε. Let’s take A = π/2 + ε/2 and C = π/2 + ε/2 - something. Wait, actually, angles can&#39;t exceed π/2 unless they&#39;re obtuse, but since B is already approaching π/2, A and C must be acute? Wait, no. If B is approaching π/2, then A and C could be approaching π/2 as well, but their sum is π/2 + ε. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.If B approaches π/2, then A + C approaches π/2. So, both A and C must be approaching angles that add up to π/2. For example, if A approaches π/2, then C approaches 0, or vice versa. So, if A approaches π/2, tan A approaches infinity, and C approaches 0, tan C approaches 0. Then, tan A * tan C approaches 0 * infinity, which is indeterminate. However, if we take A = π/2 - δ and C = π/2 - (π/2 - δ - (π/2 - B))? Maybe this is not the right approach.Alternatively, let&#39;s take B = π/2 - ε, then A + C = π - B = π/2 + ε. Let’s set A = π/4 + ε/2 and C = π/4 + ε/2. Then, tan A * tan C = tan(π/4 + ε/2)^2. Let&#39;s compute this.tan(π/4 + ε/2) = [tan π/4 + tan(ε/2)] / [1 - tan π/4 tan(ε/2)] = [1 + tan(ε/2)] / [1 - tan(ε/2)] ≈ [1 + ε/2] / [1 - ε/2] ≈ 1 + ε (using Taylor series approximation for small ε).Therefore, tan A * tan C ≈ (1 + ε)^2 ≈ 1 + 2ε.On the other hand, tan² B = tan²(π/2 - ε) = cot² ε ≈ 1/ε² for small ε. So, tan² B is very large, but tan A * tan C is approximately 1 + 2ε. Therefore, unless ε is not small, but this seems contradictory. Therefore, maybe when B approaches π/2, tan² B approaches infinity, but tan A * tan C must equal tan² B. Therefore, unless A or C approaches π/2 in such a way that their tangent product also approaches infinity, but since their sum is π/2 + ε, which is slightly more than π/2. Wait, if both A and C are approaching π/2, their sum would be approaching π, but in this case, their sum is approaching π/2. So, it&#39;s impossible for both A and C to approach π/2. Therefore, if B approaches π/2, then A + C approaches π/2. So, one angle approaches π/2, and the other approaches 0. Therefore, tan A approaches infinity, and tan C approaches 0, so their product is infinity * 0, which is undefined, but in reality, it depends on the rate. If A approaches π/2 as ε, then tan A ~ 1/(π/2 - A), and C approaches π/2 - (A + C) = π/2 - (π/2 + ε) = -ε, which doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed.Alternatively, since we have the condition that tan A * tan C = tan² B, and B is approaching π/2, then tan² B is approaching infinity. Therefore, tan A * tan C must approach infinity, which requires that at least one of tan A or tan C approaches infinity. But since A + C = π - B approaches π/2 as B approaches π/2, so both A and C are approaching angles that sum to π/2. Therefore, if A approaches π/2, then C approaches -π/2 + something, which isn&#39;t possible in a triangle. Wait, angles in a triangle must be positive. So, if B approaches π/2, then A + C approaches π/2. Therefore, the maximum possible value for one of the angles, say A, is π/2 - C, where C approaches 0. So, A approaches π/2, and C approaches 0. Then, tan A approaches infinity, tan C approaches 0. Therefore, tan A * tan C approaches infinity * 0, which is an indeterminate form. To resolve this, let&#39;s compute the limit.Let’s set B = π/2 - ε, where ε approaches 0+. Then, A + C = π - B = π/2 + ε. Let’s set A = π/2 - δ and C = ε + δ, where δ approaches 0 as ε approaches 0. Then, tan A = tan(π/2 - δ) = cot δ ≈ 1/δ, and tan C = tan(ε + δ) ≈ ε + δ. Therefore, tan A * tan C ≈ (1/δ)(ε + δ) = ε/δ + 1. But this product must equal tan² B = tan²(π/2 - ε) = cot² ε ≈ 1/ε². Therefore, we have ε/δ + 1 ≈ 1/ε². If we set δ = ε^3, for instance, then ε/δ = 1/ε², so ε/δ +1 = 1/ε² +1 ≈ 1/ε², which matches the right side. Therefore, as ε approaches 0, δ = ε^3 approaches 0 faster, so A = π/2 - δ approaches π/2, and C = ε + δ approaches 0. So, in this case, tan A * tan C ≈ 1/ε², which matches tan² B. Therefore, such angles exist as B approaches π/2. Therefore, B can approach π/2 but cannot be equal to π/2 since then it&#39;s not a triangle. Therefore, the upper limit is π/2 excluded.Similarly, when B = π/3, tan B = sqrt(3), tan² B = 3, and A + C = 2π/3. If A = C = π/3, then tan A tan C = (sqrt(3))^2 = 3, which satisfies the condition. So, B = π/3 is allowed.Therefore, the range of angle B is [π/3, π/2), which is option B.But let me check if there are any other constraints. For example, when B is in [π/3, π/2), are there any other restrictions? Let&#39;s pick B = π/4, which is in option B but tan² B = 1, so the discriminant would be D = tan² B (tan^4 B - 2 tan² B - 3) = 1*(1 - 2 -3) = 1*(-4) = -4 &lt; 0, which would imply no real solutions. But wait, that contradicts our previous conclusion. Wait, this suggests an error in my reasoning.Wait, hold on. If B is π/4, then according to our discriminant approach, D would be negative, meaning no real solutions for tan A and tan C, which would imply that such a triangle doesn&#39;t exist. But the original equation must hold for the triangle to exist, so B cannot be π/4. But according to our earlier conclusion, B should be ≥ π/3. So, π/4 is less than π/3, so it&#39;s not in the range. Therefore, that case is excluded. Wait, but if B is between π/3 and π/2, let&#39;s pick B = π/3, which gives tan² B = 3, then D = tan² B (tan^4 B - 2 tan² B -3) = 3*(9 - 6 - 3) = 3*0 = 0, which is okay, discriminant zero, so real roots. For B &gt; π/3, say B approaching π/2, the discriminant becomes positive? Let&#39;s check with B = π/3, tan B = sqrt(3), D = 3*( (sqrt(3))^4 - 2*(sqrt(3))^2 -3 ) = 3*(9 - 6 -3) = 0. For B = π/4, tan B = 1, D = 1*(1 - 2 -3) = -4 &lt; 0. For B = π/3 + ε, tan B = sqrt(3) + something, tan² B = 3 + 2 sqrt(3) ε + ..., then tan^4 B ≈ 81 + ... Hmm, better compute it numerically. Let&#39;s take B = π/3 + 0.1 (approx 1.047 + 0.1 = 1.147 radians). tan B ≈ tan(1.147) ≈ 2.0 (roughly). Then tan² B ≈ 4, tan^4 B ≈ 16. Then D = 4*(16 - 8 -3) = 4*(5) = 20 &gt; 0. So discriminant is positive. Therefore, for B &gt; π/3, discriminant is positive, allowing real solutions. For B = π/3, discriminant is zero. For B &lt; π/3, discriminant is negative, so no real solutions. Therefore, the allowed values of B are B ≥ π/3 (with B &lt; π/2). Therefore, the range is [π/3, π/2), which is option B. So, the answer is B.But the problem asks for the range of angle B. So, the correct answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem in triangle ABC where lg operatorname{tg} A + lg operatorname{tg} C = 2 lg operatorname{tg} B, we need to find the range of angle B.First, we use the properties of logarithms to simplify the given equation:[lg (operatorname{tg} A cdot operatorname{tg} C) = lg (operatorname{tg}^2 B)]This implies:[operatorname{tg} A cdot operatorname{tg} C = operatorname{tg}^2 B]Since A + B + C = pi, we have A + C = pi - B.

I need to find the set of values formed by A, where A is given by the expression:A = sin(kπ + α)/sin α + cos(kπ + α)/cos α, and k is an integer.Hmm. Alright. Let&#39;s start by understanding what this expression is doing. The variable k is an integer, so kπ is going to be an integer multiple of π. Then we have angles of the form kπ + α, and we&#39;re taking the sine and cosine of those angles, then dividing by sin α and cos α respectively. Then adding them together. So A is a combination of these two terms. The question is, what values can A take? So for different values of k and α, what possible values of A can we get?But since k is an integer, maybe we can first consider how k affects the expression. For example, depending on whether k is even or odd, adding kπ to α will have different effects on the sine and cosine functions. Let me recall that sin(nπ + θ) and cos(nπ + θ) have periodicity properties. For example, if k is even, then sin(kπ + α) would be sin(α), since adding multiples of 2π doesn&#39;t change the sine. But if k is odd, sin(kπ + α) would be sin(π + α) = -sin α. Similarly for cosine, cos(kπ + α) is cos α if k is even, and cos(π + α) = -cos α if k is odd. Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s verify that.Wait, if k is even, then k = 2m for some integer m, so kπ = 2mπ. Therefore, sin(kπ + α) = sin(2mπ + α) = sin α, because sine has a period of 2π. Similarly, cos(kπ + α) = cos(2mπ + α) = cos α. So in that case, both terms simplify to 1: sin(kπ + α)/sin α = 1, and cos(kπ + α)/cos α = 1, so A = 1 + 1 = 2.On the other hand, if k is odd, then k = 2m + 1 for some integer m, so kπ = (2m + 1)π. Then sin(kπ + α) = sin((2m + 1)π + α) = sin(π + α + 2mπ) = sin(π + α) because sine has period 2π. Then sin(π + α) = -sin α. Similarly, cos(kπ + α) = cos(π + α) = -cos α. Therefore, sin(kπ + α)/sin α = (-sin α)/sin α = -1, and cos(kπ + α)/cos α = (-cos α)/cos α = -1. So A = -1 + (-1) = -2.Wait, so does that mean that depending on whether k is even or odd, A is either 2 or -2? But that can&#39;t be right, because the problem says &quot;find the set of values formed by A&quot;, which would be {2, -2} if this reasoning is correct. However, maybe I need to check if there are other possibilities. Let me check with specific examples.Let me take k = 0 (even). Then A = sin(0 + α)/sin α + cos(0 + α)/cos α = sin α/sin α + cos α/cos α = 1 + 1 = 2. Okay, that works.Take k = 1 (odd). Then A = sin(π + α)/sin α + cos(π + α)/cos α. As we saw, sin(π + α) = -sin α, cos(π + α) = -cos α. So (-sin α)/sin α + (-cos α)/cos α = -1 + (-1) = -2. Correct.k = 2 (even): A = sin(2π + α)/sin α + cos(2π + α)/cos α = sin α/sin α + cos α/cos α = 2. Same as k=0.k = -1 (odd): A = sin(-π + α)/sin α + cos(-π + α)/cos α. But sin(-π + α) = sin(-(π - α)) = -sin(π - α) = -sin α (since sin(π - α) = sin α). Wait, is that correct? Wait, sin(-θ) = -sin θ, so sin(-π + α) = sin(-(π - α)) = -sin(π - α). But sin(π - α) is sin α. Therefore, sin(-π + α) = -sin α. Similarly, cos(-π + α) = cos(π - α) because cosine is even, so cos(-π + α) = cos(π - α) = -cos α. Therefore, A = (-sin α)/sin α + (-cos α)/cos α = -1 -1 = -2. So even for negative k, if it&#39;s odd, we get -2.So regardless of the value of α, as long as sin α ≠ 0 and cos α ≠ 0, which are required for the expression to be defined, then A is 2 when k is even and -2 when k is odd. So the set of possible values is just { -2, 2 }.Wait, but the problem states &quot;find the set of values formed by A&quot; with k ∈ ℤ. So regardless of α, as long as α is such that sin α ≠ 0 and cos α ≠ 0. But maybe the problem is assuming that α is fixed and k varies? Or is α variable as well?Wait, the problem says &quot;find the set of values formed by A&quot; given that A is equal to that expression with k ∈ ℤ. But does α also vary? Or is α a fixed parameter?The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again: &quot;Given A= [expression] (k ∈ ℤ), find the set of values formed by A.&quot; The phrasing is a bit unclear. If α is fixed (i.e., given a fixed α, let k vary over integers), then A can take two values: 2 and -2. So the set is { -2, 2 }.But if both α and k can vary, then we might get more possibilities. Wait, but even if α is variable, for each α, when k is even, A is 2; when k is odd, A is -2. Therefore, regardless of α, A is either 2 or -2. So even if α is allowed to vary, A can only take those two values. Wait, but hold on. Wait, suppose α is such that sin α = 0 or cos α = 0. Then the expression would be undefined. But the problem probably assumes that α is such that sin α ≠ 0 and cos α ≠ 0. So as long as those are non-zero, then A is either 2 or -2. Therefore, the set of values is { -2, 2 }.But let me test with specific α. Let&#39;s take α = π/4. Then for k even, A = 2. For k odd, A = -2. If α = π/3, same result. If α = π/6, same. So regardless of α, it&#39;s 2 or -2. So the set is { -2, 2 }.Wait, but let me check another angle where maybe something different happens. Suppose α = π/2. But then cos α = 0, so the expression is undefined. Similarly, if α = 0, sin α = 0, so expression is undefined. So the problem must be considering α such that sin α ≠ 0 and cos α ≠ 0. Therefore, the possible values of A are only 2 and -2. So the answer is { -2, 2 }.But let me think again. Is there any possible way that A could take other values? Suppose for some reason, maybe k is not just even or odd? Wait, but k is an integer, so it&#39;s either even or odd. So regardless, when you add kπ to α, the expression flips sign based on k&#39;s parity.Alternatively, perhaps if we consider different trigonometric identities. Let me try to compute A in another way. Let me see:A = [sin(kπ + α)/sin α] + [cos(kπ + α)/cos α]Let me factor out something. Since sin(kπ + α) = sin(kπ)cos α + cos(kπ)sin α. Wait, using the sine addition formula: sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b. Similarly, cos(kπ + α) = cos(kπ)cos α - sin(kπ)sin α.But sin(kπ) is zero for all integer k, because sin(nπ) = 0. And cos(kπ) is (-1)^k. So substituting:sin(kπ + α) = sin(kπ)cos α + cos(kπ)sin α = 0 + (-1)^k sin α. Therefore, sin(kπ + α)/sin α = (-1)^k.Similarly, cos(kπ + α) = cos(kπ)cos α - sin(kπ)sin α = (-1)^k cos α - 0 = (-1)^k cos α. Therefore, cos(kπ + α)/cos α = (-1)^k.Therefore, A = (-1)^k + (-1)^k = 2*(-1)^k.So that&#39;s even simpler. Therefore, A is equal to 2*(-1)^k, which is 2 when k is even, and -2 when k is odd. Therefore, regardless of α (as long as sin α ≠ 0 and cos α ≠ 0), the expression A can only take two values: 2 and -2. Therefore, the set of values formed by A is { -2, 2 }.Hence, the answer should be boxed{{-2, 2}}.Final AnswerThe set of values formed by ( A ) is boxed{{-2, 2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( A = frac{sin(kpi + alpha)}{sin alpha} + frac{cos(kpi + alpha)}{cos alpha} ) where ( k in mathbb{Z} ), we need to find the set of values formed by ( A ).First, we consider the periodicity properties of sine and cosine functions. For an integer ( k ):- If ( k ) is even, ( k = 2m ) for some integer ( m ). Then:  [  sin(kpi + alpha) = sin(2mpi + alpha) = sin alpha  ]  [  cos(kpi + alpha) = cos(2mpi + alpha) = cos alpha  ]  Therefore,   [  frac{sin(kpi + alpha)}{sin alpha} = 1 quad text{and} quad frac{cos(kpi + alpha)}{cos alpha} = 1  ]  So, ( A = 1 + 1 = 2 ).- If ( k ) is odd, ( k = 2m + 1 ) for some integer ( m ). Then:  [  sin(kpi + alpha) = sin((2m + 1)pi + alpha) = sin(pi + alpha) = -sin alpha  ]  [  cos(kpi + alpha) = cos((2m + 1)pi + alpha) = cos(pi + alpha) = -cos alpha  ]  Therefore,  [  frac{sin(kpi + alpha)}{sin alpha} = -1 quad text{and} quad frac{cos(kpi + alpha)}{cos alpha} = -1  ]  So, ( A = -1 + (-1) = -2 ).Using trigonometric identities, we can also verify:- (sin(kpi + alpha) = (-1)^k sin alpha)- (cos(kpi + alpha) = (-1)^k cos alpha)Thus,[A = (-1)^k + (-1)^k = 2(-1)^k]This confirms that ( A ) is ( 2 ) when ( k ) is even and ( -2 ) when ( k ) is odd. Therefore, the set of values formed by ( A ) is ({-2, 2}).The final answer is (boxed{{-2, 2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, we have this expression A, which is equal to sin(kπ + α)/sin α plus cos(kπ + α)/cos α, where k is an integer. We need to find all possible values that A can take. Hmm, trigonometric functions with angles shifted by kπ... Let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here.First, I remember that sin(θ + π) is equal to -sin θ, and cos(θ + π) is equal to -cos θ. So, if k is an integer, then kπ would be adding π an integer number of times. That means depending on whether k is even or odd, sin(kπ + α) and cos(kπ + α) would simplify differently. Let me check that.If k is even, say k = 2n for some integer n, then kπ = 2nπ. Adding that to α, sin(2nπ + α) is just sin α because sine has a period of 2π. Similarly, cos(2nπ + α) is cos α. So for even k, both terms in A would simplify to sin α / sin α + cos α / cos α, which is 1 + 1 = 2. That seems straightforward.Now, if k is odd, say k = 2n + 1, then kπ = (2n + 1)π. So sin((2n + 1)π + α) = sin(π + α + 2nπ). Since sine has a period of 2π, this is the same as sin(π + α). Which is -sin α. Similarly, cos((2n + 1)π + α) = cos(π + α) = -cos α. So plugging that into A, we get (-sin α)/sin α + (-cos α)/cos α, which is -1 + (-1) = -2. Wait, so does that mean that depending on whether k is even or odd, A is either 2 or -2?But hold on, the problem says k is an integer, so k can be even or odd. Therefore, the possible values of A are 2 and -2. Is that all? Let me double-check.Suppose k is 0, which is even. Then sin(0 + α)/sin α + cos(0 + α)/cos α = sin α / sin α + cos α / cos α = 1 + 1 = 2. If k is 1, then sin(π + α)/sin α + cos(π + α)/cos α = (-sin α)/sin α + (-cos α)/cos α = -1 -1 = -2. Similarly, k = 2, which is even again, gives sin(2π + α)/sin α + cos(2π + α)/cos α = sin α / sin α + cos α / cos α = 2. So alternating between 2 and -2 depending on k being even or odd.Therefore, the set of values formed by A is just { -2, 2 }.But wait, let me make sure there are no other possibilities. Is there any value of α where this might not hold? For example, what if sin α or cos α is zero? Then the expression would be undefined, right? Because we have division by sin α and cos α. So the original expression A is only defined when sin α ≠ 0 and cos α ≠ 0. Therefore, α cannot be an integer multiple of π/2. So as long as α is not 0, π/2, π, etc., then the expression is defined. So given that the problem states A is defined (since it&#39;s given), we can assume that α is such that sin α and cos α are non-zero. Therefore, A can take either 2 or -2 depending on k&#39;s parity. So the set of possible values is { -2, 2 }.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a different approach to confirm this? Let me try using trigonometric identities. Let&#39;s take the original expression:A = [sin(kπ + α)/sin α] + [cos(kπ + α)/cos α]Let me recall that sin(kπ + α) = sin(kπ)cos α + cos(kπ)sin αSimilarly, cos(kπ + α) = cos(kπ)cos α - sin(kπ)sin αBut sin(kπ) is zero for any integer k, right? Because sin(nπ) = 0 for integer n. So sin(kπ + α) = 0*cos α + cos(kπ)sin α = cos(kπ) sin αSimilarly, cos(kπ + α) = cos(kπ)cos α - 0*sin α = cos(kπ) cos αTherefore, substituting back into A:A = [cos(kπ) sin α / sin α] + [cos(kπ) cos α / cos α] = cos(kπ) + cos(kπ) = 2 cos(kπ)But cos(kπ) is equal to (-1)^k. So 2*(-1)^k. Therefore, A = 2*(-1)^k. Since k is an integer, (-1)^k is either 1 or -1, so A is either 2 or -2. Therefore, the set of values is { -2, 2 }.Wow, that&#39;s a much simpler approach. So whether k is even or odd, cos(kπ) alternates between 1 and -1, so A is 2*1=2 or 2*(-1)=-2. So indeed, the set is { -2, 2 }.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{{-2, 2}}.Final AnswerThe set of values formed by ( A ) is boxed{{-2, 2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( A = frac{sin(kpi + alpha)}{sin alpha} + frac{cos(kpi + alpha)}{cos alpha} ) where ( k in mathbb{Z} ), we need to find the set of values formed by ( A ).First, we recall the trigonometric identities for sine and cosine with an angle shifted by ( kpi ):- For even ( k ), ( sin(kpi + alpha) = sin alpha ) and ( cos(kpi + alpha) = cos alpha ).- For odd ( k ), ( sin(kpi + alpha) = -sin alpha ) and ( cos(kpi + alpha) = -cos alpha ).Using these identities:- If ( k ) is even, the expression simplifies to:  [  frac{sin alpha}{sin alpha} + frac{cos alpha}{cos alpha} = 1 + 1 = 2  ]- If ( k ) is odd, the expression simplifies to:  [  frac{-sin alpha}{sin alpha} + frac{-cos alpha}{cos alpha} = -1 - 1 = -2  ]To confirm this, we use the trigonometric identities for sine and cosine of a sum:- ( sin(kpi + alpha) = cos(kpi) sin alpha )- ( cos(kpi + alpha) = cos(kpi) cos alpha )Substituting these into ( A ):[A = frac{cos(kpi) sin alpha}{sin alpha} + frac{cos(kpi) cos alpha}{cos alpha} = cos(kpi) + cos(kpi) = 2 cos(kpi)]Since ( cos(kpi) = (-1)^k ), we have:[A = 2(-1)^k]Thus, ( A ) can be either ( 2 ) or ( -2 ) depending on whether ( k ) is even or odd. Therefore, the set of values formed by ( A ) is ({-2, 2}).The final answer is boxed{{-2, 2}}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e4c04970></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e4c04970><span class="icon" data-v-e4c04970>🔑:</span>When k is an even number, we have A= frac{sin alpha}{sin alpha}+ frac{cos alpha}{cos alpha}=2;When k is an odd number, we have A= frac{-sin alpha}{sin alpha}- frac{cos alpha}{cos alpha}=-2.Therefore, the set of values formed by A is boxed{{2,-2}}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-b9d3213f data-v-e4c04970><div class="review" data-v-e4c04970><div class="review-title" data-v-e4c04970><span class="icon" data-v-e4c04970>❓:</span>8.

The problem is about 12 Smurfs sitting around a round table. Each Smurf hates the two sitting next to him. Papa Smurf needs to form a team of 5 Smurfs where none of them hate each other. I need to find out how many ways there are to form such a team. Hmm, so this is a combinatorial problem involving circular arrangements and restrictions on adjacency.First, let me visualize the setup. The Smurfs are arranged in a circle, right? So, each one has two neighbors, left and right, whom they hate. Therefore, any team of 5 Smurfs must not include any two adjacent Smurfs. This is similar to selecting objects arranged in a circle such that no two are adjacent. Wait, but in this case, it&#39;s a team of 5, so we need to choose 5 non-consecutive Smurfs from 12 arranged in a circle.I remember that for linear arrangements, like people sitting in a line, the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive people out of n is C(n - k + 1, k). But since this is a circular table, the first and last positions are also adjacent, which complicates things. So circular arrangements are trickier because of the wrap-around adjacency.Let me recall the formula for circular arrangements. The number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects from n arranged in a circle is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1). Wait, is that right? Hmm, maybe I need to derive it.Alternatively, there&#39;s a standard approach for these problems where you fix one position and break the circle into a line. Let me think. If we fix one Smurf as part of the team, then their two neighbors cannot be included. Then the problem reduces to arranging the remaining team members in the remaining positions. But because it&#39;s a circle, fixing one position might not account for rotational symmetry, but since we are counting all possible teams, maybe fixing a position is okay.Wait, but in this case, the Smurfs are distinguishable, right? Each Smurf is an individual. So, we are not dealing with arrangements where rotations are considered the same. We need to count all possible subsets of 5 Smurfs where no two are adjacent. So, the circular nature just means that the first and last are also adjacent. So, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of independent sets of size 5 in a cycle graph C12.Yes, exactly. A cycle graph with 12 nodes, and we need to count the number of independent sets of size 5. An independent set is a set of vertices with no two adjacent. So, the answer is the number of independent sets of size 5 in C12.I need to recall how to compute that. I remember that for a cycle graph Cn, the number of independent sets of size k is given by a certain formula. Let me see. Maybe using recurrence relations?Alternatively, there&#39;s an inclusion-exclusion approach. Let&#39;s think.In a circular table, the problem is that if we consider linear arrangements, the first and last elements are not adjacent, but in a circular arrangement, they are. So, maybe we can compute the number of ways for a line and adjust for the circular case.Wait, another approach: The number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects in a circle of n is equal to (n / (n - k)) * C(n - k, k). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, here&#39;s a standard formula for the number of ways to select k non-consecutive objects around a circle:C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1)But let me verify this with small numbers.For example, if n = 3, k = 1. Then the number of ways should be 3 (each single Smurf). According to the formula, C(3 - 1, 1) + C(3 - 1 - 1, 1 - 1) = C(2,1) + C(1,0) = 2 + 1 = 3. Correct.For n = 4, k = 2. How many ways? In a circle of 4, choosing 2 non-adjacent: there are two pairs: (1,3) and (2,4). So 2 ways. The formula: C(4 - 2, 2) + C(4 - 2 -1, 2 -1) = C(2,2) + C(1,1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.Another test: n = 5, k = 2. How many ways? In a circle of 5, each pair is adjacent except those with one in between. Each Smurf has two non-adjacent Smurfs. But choosing two non-adjacent: each such pair is two apart. There are 5 such pairs. So 5. The formula: C(5 - 2, 2) + C(5 - 2 -1, 2 -1) = C(3,2) + C(2,1) = 3 + 2 = 5. Correct.Okay, so the formula seems to hold: the number is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1). Therefore, for our problem, n = 12, k =5.So, plug in the numbers: C(12 -5,5) + C(12 -5 -1,5 -1) = C(7,5) + C(6,4).Calculate C(7,5): 7! / (5!2!) = 21.C(6,4): 6! / (4!2!) = 15.So total is 21 + 15 = 36. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check with another approach to be sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the problem as placing 5 Smurfs around the table with no two adjacent. Since it&#39;s a circle, we can use the formula for circular arrangements with forbidden adjacents.Alternatively, we can model this as arranging 5 objects (selected Smurfs) and 7 non-selected Smurfs around the table such that no two selected Smurfs are adjacent. To do this, first arrange the 7 non-selected Smurfs around the table. This creates 7 gaps between them (including the gap between the last and first). Then, we need to place 5 selected Smurfs into these gaps, with at most one per gap. However, since it&#39;s a circle, the number of gaps is equal to the number of non-selected Smurfs, which is 7. Therefore, the number of ways is C(7,5). But wait, that&#39;s 21. But this is a linear approach? Wait, no, in circular arrangements, when arranging indistinct objects, the formula is different.Wait, actually, when arranging non-consecutive objects in a circle, the formula is similar to linear arrangements but adjusted for circularity. In linear arrangements, the number of ways to place k non-consecutive objects in n positions is C(n - k +1, k). For circular arrangements, the formula is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1). So, according to that, 21 + 15 = 36. However, when I think about arranging 7 non-selected Smurfs, which creates 7 gaps, and choosing 5 gaps to place the selected Smurfs, that would be C(7,5)=21. But why does the other formula give 36? Hmm, there&#39;s a discrepancy here. Which is correct?Wait, perhaps the two different approaches count different things. If we fix one position as a non-selected Smurf to break the circle, then it becomes a linear problem. Let me try that.Imagine we fix one Smurf as not selected. Then the remaining 11 Smurfs form a line, with the first and last not adjacent. Then, the number of ways to choose 5 non-consecutive Smurfs from 11 is C(11 -5 +1,5) = C(7,5)=21. But since we fixed one Smurf as not selected, we have to consider all possibilities where that Smurf is not selected. But in reality, the Smurf we fixed could be selected or not. Wait, no, by fixing a Smurf as not selected, we avoid the circularity, but we might undercount or overcount.Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion: total number of ways without considering the circularity minus the cases where the first and last are both selected.Wait, in the linear case, the number of ways to choose 5 non-consecutive Smurfs from 12 in a line is C(12 -5 +1,5)=C(8,5)=56. But in the circular case, we need to subtract those selections where both the first and last Smurfs are selected, because in the circle they would be adjacent. So, the formula is linear arrangements minus the bad cases where first and last are both selected.How many such bad cases? If both first and last are selected, then the remaining 3 Smurfs must be selected from the remaining 12 - 2 -2 =8 Smurfs (excluding first, last, and their adjacent Smurfs). Wait, let&#39;s see. If the first and last are selected, then the second and the eleventh cannot be selected. So, the remaining 3 must be selected from positions 3 to 10, which is 8 positions. And in these 8 positions, we need to choose 3 non-consecutive Smurfs. The number of ways is C(8 -3 +1,3)=C(6,3)=20. So, total bad cases are 20.Therefore, the total number of circular arrangements would be 56 -20=36. Which matches the previous formula&#39;s result. So that&#39;s 36. Therefore, the answer is 36? But wait, the problem says &quot;each Smurf hates the 2 Smurfs sitting next to him&quot;, so we can&#39;t have any two adjacent. So, according to this calculation, it&#39;s 36.But wait, when I considered fixing a Smurf as not selected and then calculating C(7,5)=21, which didn&#39;t account for all possibilities. But when using inclusion-exclusion, starting from linear arrangements and subtracting the circular overlaps, we get 36. That seems more accurate.Alternatively, the formula for circular independent sets is C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). For n=12, k=5, that&#39;s C(7,5) + C(6,4)=21 +15=36. So, 36. But let me check with another method.Alternatively, recursion. The number of independent sets of size k in a cycle graph Cn is equal to the number of independent sets of size k in a path graph Pn minus the number of independent sets where both the first and last are selected. Wait, that&#39;s similar to inclusion-exclusion.Alternatively, there&#39;s a standard recurrence relation for independent sets on a cycle. Let me recall.For a cycle graph Cn, the number of independent sets of size k is equal to the number of independent sets of size k in a path graph Pn (which is C(n -k +1, k)) minus the number of independent sets where both the first and last nodes are selected. To compute the latter, if both first and last are selected, then the second and second-to-last cannot be selected. So, the remaining k - 2 nodes must be chosen from the remaining n - 4 nodes (excluding first, last, second, and second-to-last). So, the number is C((n -4) - (k -2) +1, k -2)=C(n -k -1, k -2). Wait, no, actually, the remaining positions after selecting first and last, we need to choose k -2 nodes from the remaining n -4 positions (since positions 2 and n-1 are excluded), and these k -2 nodes must be non-consecutive. Therefore, the number is C((n -4) - (k -2) +1, k -2)=C(n -k -1, k -2).But for n=12 and k=5, that would be C(12 -5 -1, 5 -2)=C(6,3)=20. So, the number of independent sets of size 5 in C12 is equal to C(12 -5 +1,5) - C(6,3)=C(8,5) -20=56 -20=36. Which matches the previous result. So, that&#39;s consistent.Therefore, the answer should be 36. But wait, let me verify with another example. Suppose n=5, k=2. Then using inclusion-exclusion: linear arrangements C(5 -2 +1,2)=C(4,2)=6. Subtract the cases where first and last are both selected. If first and last are selected, then we need to choose 0 more from the remaining 5 -4=1 (positions 2 and 4 are excluded). Wait, no. If n=5, and k=2, and first and last are selected, then positions 2 and 4 are excluded. So, remaining positions are 3. But we need to choose 0 from position 3. So, only 1 way. Therefore, total circular arrangements would be 6 -1=5, which matches the actual count. So, the formula works here.Therefore, confident that the formula is correct. Hence, for n=12 and k=5, the answer is 36. But wait, the problem states &quot;12 Smurfs... each Smurf hates the 2 Smurfs sitting next to him, but does not hate the other 9 Smurfs. Papa Smurf needs to send out a team of 5 Smurfs... cannot include Smurfs who hate each other.&quot; So, the problem is exactly counting independent sets of size 5 in C12, which we&#39;ve determined is 36. Therefore, the answer is 36, which would be boxed as boxed{36}.Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I missed something. Let&#39;s think of another way. Suppose we number the Smurfs 1 to 12 around the table. We need to choose 5 numbers such that no two are consecutive, considering that 12 and 1 are also consecutive.The standard formula for the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects in a circle of n is indeed given by:C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1)So, plugging in n=12, k=5:C(7,5) + C(6,4) = 21 + 15 = 36. So that&#39;s 36.Alternatively, using generating functions. The generating function for independent sets on a cycle graph Cn is (1 + x)^n - (1 + x)^{n - 2}x^2. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, for a line graph Pn, the generating function is (1 + x)^{n - k +1}, but maybe this is more complex.Alternatively, the generating function for the number of independent sets on a cycle can be derived using recurrence relations. For a cycle graph Cn, the number of independent sets of size k is equal to the number for a path graph Pn minus the number where both endpoints are selected. Which we already did.Alternatively, think of it as two cases: either the first Smurf is selected or not.Case 1: The first Smurf is selected. Then, the second and twelfth Smurfs cannot be selected. The remaining 3 Smurfs must be chosen from Smurfs 3 to 11 (total 9 Smurfs), with no two adjacent. The number of ways is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 non-consecutive Smurfs from 9 in a line, which is C(9 -3 +1,3)=C(7,3)=35.Case 2: The first Smurf is not selected. Then, we need to choose 5 Smurfs from the remaining 11 (Smurfs 2 to 12), with no two adjacent. Since the first is not selected, the circular arrangement now becomes a line from 2 to 12, where 12 is adjacent to 1, but 1 is not selected. So, effectively, it&#39;s a line of 11 Smurfs. The number of ways is C(11 -5 +1,5)=C(7,5)=21.But wait, adding these two cases gives 35 +21=56. But that&#39;s the linear case. However, in the circular case, when the first Smurf is not selected, the last Smurf (12) could still be selected, but if we consider the circular arrangement, Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 1, which is not selected. Wait, but in this case, when we fix the first Smurf as not selected, the rest can be considered in a line. So, this approach would give 35 +21=56, which is the same as the linear case, but in reality, we need to subtract the cases where Smurf 12 is selected along with Smurf 1. Wait, but Smurf 1 is not selected in Case 2, so Smurf 12 can be selected as long as he is not adjacent to others. However, Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 11 and Smurf 1. Since Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 can be selected as long as Smurf 11 is not. Therefore, perhaps the Case 2 is correctly counted as 21.But then the total would be 35 +21=56. But this is the same as the linear case. But we know that in circular case, the count is less. Therefore, this approach is incorrect. So, why?Because in Case 1, when we select the first Smurf, we exclude the second and the twelfth. Then, the remaining Smurfs from 3 to 11 form a line (not a circle). So, the number of ways is C(9 -3 +1,3)=C(7,3)=35.In Case 2, when we don&#39;t select the first Smurf, we have a circle of Smurfs 2 to 12, but since the first Smurf isn&#39;t selected, Smurf 12 is adjacent only to Smurf 11 and Smurf 1 (who isn&#39;t selected). So, effectively, it&#39;s a line from Smurf 2 to Smurf 12, with Smurf 12 not adjacent to Smurf 1 (since Smurf 1 is not selected). Therefore, the problem reduces to a line of 11 Smurfs, so the number of ways is C(11 -5 +1,5)=C(7,5)=21. Therefore, total is 35 +21=56. But this counts the circular case as 56, but we know from previous methods that the correct answer is 36. So, this approach is wrong. Where is the mistake?Ah, here&#39;s the problem. When we split into cases where the first Smurf is selected or not, in Case 2 (first Smurf not selected), the remaining Smurfs 2-12 form a circle? No, because Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 1, who isn&#39;t selected. Therefore, Smurf 12 is now only adjacent to Smurf 11. So, the remaining arrangement is actually a line from Smurf 2 to Smurf 12, with Smurf 12 being adjacent only to Smurf 11. Therefore, it&#39;s a line, not a circle. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 5 non-consecutive Smurfs in a line of 11 is indeed C(7,5)=21. Then, adding Case 1 (35) and Case 2 (21) gives 56, which is the linear case. But the circular case should be less. So, the mistake is that in Case 1, when we select the first Smurf, we have a line from 3 to 11 (9 Smurfs), but in reality, after selecting the first Smurf, we also exclude Smurf 12, but Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 1. Wait, no. If we select Smurf 1, then Smurf 2 and Smurf 12 cannot be selected. Then, Smurfs 3 to 11 are available, which are 9 Smurfs in a line (since Smurf 12 is excluded). Therefore, selecting 3 from these 9 in a line: C(9 -3 +1,3)=C(7,3)=35. That part is correct.But in Case 2, when Smurf 1 is not selected, we have Smurfs 2 to 12 (11 Smurfs) arranged in a circle. Wait, no. If Smurf 1 is not selected, then Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 11 and Smurf 1. Since Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 is only adjacent to Smurf 11. Therefore, the problem reduces to a line of Smurfs 2 to 12 (11 Smurfs) with Smurf 12 at the end adjacent only to Smurf 11. Therefore, it&#39;s a line, not a circle. Hence, the number of ways is C(11 -5 +1,5)=C(7,5)=21.But in reality, Smurfs 2 to 12 form a circle only if Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 2. But since Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 1 (not selected) and Smurf 11. So, the adjacency between Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 is only through Smurf 1, which is not selected. Therefore, Smurf 12 is not adjacent to Smurf 2. So, Smurfs 2 to 12 form a line, not a circle. Therefore, the number of independent sets in that line is C(7,5)=21. Therefore, total is 35 +21=56. But this is the same as the linear case, which contradicts the previous result.This suggests that my approach is missing something. The issue arises because when Smurf 1 is not selected, the adjacency between Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 is non-existent. Therefore, the arrangement is a line from 2 to 12, but in reality, Smurf 12 is adjacent only to Smurf 11, so it&#39;s a line, not a circle. Hence, the count for Case 2 is correct.But then why does the inclusion-exclusion approach give 36? Where is the mistake here?Wait, let&#39;s go back. When we calculated using inclusion-exclusion, we started with the linear case (56), then subtracted the cases where both first and last are selected (20), giving 36. But according to this case analysis, where we split into two cases, first selected and first not selected, the total is 56. So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps the case analysis is wrong because when Smurf 1 is not selected, the remaining Smurfs 2-12 form a line, but in the circular problem, Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 1. Since Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 is only adjacent to Smurf 11, so effectively, the remaining Smurfs form a line. Therefore, the count for Case 2 is correct as 21, and Case 1 is 35, leading to 56. But this contradicts the inclusion-exclusion result. So, something is wrong here.Wait, maybe I need to check with a smaller example. Let&#39;s take n=5, k=2.Case 1: First Smurf is selected. Then, Smurfs 2 and 5 cannot be selected. Remaining Smurfs 3 and 4. Need to choose 1 from them. Number of ways: C(2 -1 +1,1)=C(2,1)=2.Case 2: First Smurf not selected. Then, Smurfs 2-5 form a line. Number of ways: C(4 -2 +1,2)=C(3,2)=3. Total: 2 +3=5. Which matches the correct answer. But according to inclusion-exclusion, linear arrangements C(5 -2 +1,2)=C(4,2)=6, subtract cases where first and last are both selected: If first and last are selected, the remaining 0, so 1 way. Therefore, 6 -1=5. Which matches. So here, the case analysis gives the same result as inclusion-exclusion.But in the original problem with n=12 and k=5, inclusion-exclusion gives 36, while case analysis gives 56. Wait, no. Wait, no, in the n=5, k=2 example, the case analysis gives 5, which is correct. In the original problem, why is there a discrepancy?Wait, no, in the original problem, when we use case analysis, the result was 56, which is the same as linear arrangements. But the correct answer for circular arrangements is 36. So, what&#39;s going on here? Wait, no, the case analysis in the original problem is not correct because in Case 2, the remaining Smurfs 2-12 do not form a line but still form a circle? Wait, no. If Smurf 1 is not selected, then Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 11 and Smurf 1. Since Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 is only adjacent to Smurf 11, so effectively, Smurfs 2-12 form a line with Smurf 12 at the end adjacent only to Smurf 11. Therefore, they form a line, not a circle. Hence, the number of ways should be equivalent to linear arrangements. Therefore, the total is 56, but this is wrong because in reality, the answer is 36. Therefore, there must be a mistake in this reasoning.Wait, perhaps the error is that when Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 is still part of the circle, but Smurf 1 is excluded. Therefore, the adjacency between Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 is still present? Wait, no. If the Smurfs are sitting around a table, Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 11 and Smurf 1. If Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 is adjacent only to Smurf 11. The adjacency between Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 is not a direct adjacency; they are only adjacent through Smurf 1. Since Smurf 1 is not part of the team, Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 are not adjacent in the team. Therefore, Smurfs 2-12 form a line, not a circle, because Smurf 12 is only adjacent to Smurf 11, and Smurf 2 is adjacent to Smurf 3 and Smurf 1 (not selected). Therefore, it&#39;s a line from Smurf 2 to Smurf 12. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 5 non-consecutive Smurfs from these 11 in a line is C(11 -5 +1,5)=C(7,5)=21. Then, adding to Case 1 gives 35 +21=56. But this is the same as the linear case, which is inconsistent with the inclusion-exclusion result.But wait, perhaps when we fix Smurf 1 as not selected, the remaining problem is not a line but a circle with one Smurf removed. Wait, no. If Smurf 1 is not selected, the remaining Smurfs 2-12 form a circle with a break at Smurf 1. Therefore, they form a line. So, their adjacency is like a line. Therefore, the count should be linear. But in reality, in the original problem, the answer is 36, which is less than the linear case. Therefore, my case analysis is incorrect.This suggests that there is a mistake in assuming that fixing Smurf 1 as not selected converts the problem into a line. Maybe even though Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 is still adjacent to Smurf 2 in the team selection? Wait, no. If Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 are not adjacent in the team because Smurf 1 is not part of the team. The hatred is only between immediate neighbors. So, in the team, Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 are not adjacent unless they are sitting next to each other in the team. Wait, no, the hatred is defined based on the original seating. So, even if Smurf 1 is not in the team, Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 are still neighbors in the original seating, so they hate each other. Therefore, if both Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 are selected, even though Smurf 1 is not in the team, they still hate each other and cannot be in the team together. Therefore, the adjacency is based on the original circular arrangement, not on the team&#39;s formation.Oh! This is a crucial point. The hatred is based on the original seating around the table. Therefore, even if Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 2 and Smurf 12 are still adjacent in the original seating and thus hate each other. Therefore, in Case 2, when Smurf 1 is not selected, the remaining Smurfs 2-12 still form a circle because Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 2. Therefore, my previous reasoning was wrong. I thought that if Smurf 1 is not selected, then Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 are not adjacent, but in reality, their adjacency is determined by their original seating, not by the team&#39;s composition. Therefore, even if Smurf 1 is not in the team, Smurf 2 and Smurf 12 are still neighbors and cannot both be in the team.Therefore, when Smurf 1 is not selected, the problem reduces to choosing 5 non-consecutive Smurfs from Smurfs 2-12 arranged in a circle (since Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 2). Therefore, the number of ways in Case 2 is not C(7,5)=21, but instead the number of independent sets of size 5 in a circle of 11 Smurfs.But then how do we compute that? Wait, if we use the same formula: For n=11, k=5, it would be C(11 -5,5) + C(11 -5 -1,5 -1)=C(6,5) + C(5,4)=6 +5=11. Then, total is Case1:35 + Case2:11=46. But this contradicts the previous results. Wait, confusion arises here.Alternatively, perhaps we need to apply the formula recursively. Let&#39;s define f(n,k) as the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive Smurfs in a circle of n.Then, when we fix Smurf 1:Case1: Select Smurf 1. Then, Smurfs 2 and 12 cannot be selected. We need to choose k-1=4 Smurfs from Smurfs 3-11 (n=9), arranged in a line (since Smurfs 3-11 are not adjacent to Smurf 12 anymore, but since Smurf 12 is already excluded, it&#39;s a line). So, the number of ways is C(9 -4 +1,4)=C(6,4)=15.Wait, but earlier I thought it was C(7,3)=35. Wait, this is confusing.Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for f(n,k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). For n=12, k=5, f(12,5)=36. If we use recurrence:f(n,k) = f(n -1, k) + f(n -2, k -1)Where f(n -1, k) is the case where Smurf 1 is not selected, so we have n-1 Smurfs in a circle (since Smurf 1 is excluded, the circle becomes Smurfs 2-12, which is a circle of 11). Then, the number of ways is f(n -1, k). The term f(n -2, k -1) is the case where Smurf 1 is selected, so Smurfs 2 and n cannot be selected, leaving n -2 Smurfs (3-11) in a line. Wait, but if Smurf 1 is selected, then Smurfs 2 and 12 are excluded, leaving Smurfs 3-11, which is n - 3 Smurfs in a line. Therefore, the number of ways is C((n -3) - (k -1) +1, k -1)=C(n -k -1, k -1). Therefore, the recurrence is f(n,k)=f(n -1,k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). For n=12, k=5: f(12,5)=f(11,5)+C(6,4)=f(11,5)+15.Similarly, f(11,5)=f(10,5)+C(5,4)=f(10,5)+5.f(10,5)=f(9,5)+C(4,4)=f(9,5)+1.f(9,5)=f(8,5)+C(3,4). But C(3,4)=0, so f(9,5)=f(8,5).f(8,5)=f(7,5)+C(2,4)=f(7,5)+0.f(7,5)=f(6,5)+C(1,4)=0 +0=0 (since C(1,4)=0). Wait, this can&#39;t be right. Maybe the recurrence is different.Alternatively, this recurrence might not hold for k values where n -k -1 is less than k -1. Maybe my approach is wrong.Alternatively, another recurrence for independent sets on a cycle graph.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s better to look up the formula.Wait, according to some references, the number of independent sets of size k in a cycle graph Cn is equal to:C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1)Which is the formula we used earlier. For n=12, k=5, that gives 36. For n=11, k=5, it&#39;s C(6,5) + C(5,4)=6 +5=11. For n=10, k=5: C(5,5) + C(4,4)=1 +1=2. For n=9, k=5: C(4,5) + C(3,4)=0 +0=0. Which makes sense because you can&#39;t choose 5 non-consecutive Smurfs from 9 in a circle.But how does this relate to the recurrence? If we have f(n,k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1), then:f(n,k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1)Similarly, for f(n-1,k)=C((n-1)-k, k) + C((n-1)-k -1, k -1)=C(n -k -1, k) + C(n -k -2, k -1)And C(n -k -1, k -1) is just the second term in the original formula.But I&#39;m not sure how this helps.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s better to accept the formula and confirm that the answer is 36.But wait, let&#39;s verify with another method. Let&#39;s list all possible teams. Obviously, we can&#39;t do that for n=12, but maybe for smaller n.Wait, when n=5, k=2. According to formula, C(5 -2,2)+C(5 -2 -1,1)=C(3,2)+C(2,1)=3+2=5. Which is correct. The independent sets are {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {3,5}. Five teams.Another example, n=6, k=3. Formula: C(6 -3,3)+C(6 -3 -1,2)=C(3,3)+C(2,2)=1+1=2. Indeed, in a hexagon, the only independent sets of size 3 are every other vertex, so two possibilities: {1,3,5} and {2,4,6}. So 2 ways.Therefore, the formula works. Therefore, for n=12, k=5, answer is 36.But the original case analysis suggested 56, which is wrong because it didn&#39;t consider that in Case 2, Smurfs 2-12 still form a circle. Therefore, my initial case analysis was incorrect because I incorrectly assumed that removing Smurf 1 converts the circle into a line, but in reality, Smurfs 2-12 still form a circle because Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 2. Therefore, even if Smurf 1 is not selected, Smurf 12 and Smurf 2 are still adjacent, so the problem remains a circle. Hence, the number of ways in Case 2 is f(n -1, k)=f(11,5)=11. Then, total ways are 35 +11=46. But this contradicts the formula&#39;s result of 36. Wait, confusion arises here.Wait, wait. If in Case 1, selecting Smurf 1, we exclude Smurfs 2 and 12. Then, we have Smurfs 3-11, which are 9 Smurfs in a line (since Smurf 12 is excluded, and Smurf 3 is adjacent to Smurf 4, etc., up to Smurf 11). Therefore, the number of ways is C(9 -4 +1,4)=C(6,4)=15. Wait, but earlier I thought it was C(7,3)=35. Wait, where is this discrepancy coming from?Hold on. If you select Smurf 1, then Smurfs 2 and 12 are excluded. The remaining Smurfs are 3 to 11, which is 9 Smurfs. These 9 Smurfs form a line because Smurf 11 is not adjacent to Smurf 3 (since Smurf 12 is excluded). Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 non-consecutive Smurfs from 9 in a line is C(9 -4 +1,4)=C(6,4)=15.But earlier, I thought that in Case 1, it&#39;s C(7,3)=35, which was wrong. So, correct value is 15. Then, Case 2 is f(11,5)=11. Therefore, total is 15 +11=26. But according to the formula, it should be 36. Hmm, this is inconsistent.Wait, this suggests that my understanding is still flawed. Let&#39;s re-express the problem.Using the recurrence relation for the number of independent sets of size k in a cycle graph Cn:f(n,k) = f(n-1,k) + f(n-2,k-1)Where f(n-1,k) is the number of independent sets not including the first vertex, and f(n-2,k-1) is the number including the first vertex (thus excluding the second and last vertices), and then choosing k-1 from the remaining n-2-1= n-3 vertices arranged in a line.Wait, but according to this, f(n,k) = f(n-1,k) + C(n -k -1, k -1)But then for n=12, k=5:f(12,5) = f(11,5) + C(6,4)= f(11,5) +15Similarly, f(11,5)= f(10,5) + C(5,4)= f(10,5)+5f(10,5)=f(9,5)+C(4,4)=f(9,5)+1f(9,5)=f(8,5)+C(3,4)=f(8,5)+0f(8,5)=f(7,5)+C(2,4)=f(7,5)+0f(7,5)=f(6,5)+C(1,4)=0+0=0So, f(7,5)=0Then, f(8,5)=0+0=0f(9,5)=0+0=0f(10,5)=0+1=1f(11,5)=1+5=6f(12,5)=6+15=21But according to the formula f(n,k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1), f(12,5)=C(7,5)+C(6,4)=21 +15=36. But according to the recurrence, it&#39;s 21. Contradiction.This suggests that the recurrence is not correct. Therefore, my previous understanding is wrong. Therefore, the formula f(n,k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1) is not correct, or the recurrence is different.Wait, perhaps the correct recurrence is different. Let&#39;s refer back to the inclusion-exclusion approach.Number of ways in a circle = number of ways in a line - number of ways where both first and last are selected.Number of ways in a line: C(n -k +1, k)Number of ways where both first and last are selected: C(n -k -1, k -2)Therefore, for n=12, k=5:C(12 -5 +1,5) - C(12 -5 -1,5 -2)=C(8,5)-C(6,3)=56 -20=36.This matches the formula. But according to the recurrence, it&#39;s 21. So, discrepancy.Therefore, the correct formula is via inclusion-exclusion, giving 36. Therefore, the answer is 36.But then why does the recurrence give a different result? Perhaps the recurrence I used is incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the correct recurrence is:For a cycle graph Cn, the number of independent sets of size k is equal to the number for a path graph Pn minus the number of independent sets in Pn-2 of size k-2.But this is similar to the inclusion-exclusion.Alternatively, here&#39;s a better recurrence:Let’s denote i(n,k) as the number of independent sets of size k in a path graph Pn, and c(n,k) as the number for a cycle graph Cn. Then,c(n,k) = i(n,k) - c(n-2, k-2)Wait, not sure.Wait, let me look it up in my mind. For independent sets on a cycle, the recurrence is c(n,k) = i(n,k) - i(n-4, k-2). Wait, not sure.Alternatively, recall that in the inclusion-exclusion, c(n,k) = i(n,k) - i(n-4, k-2). But perhaps not.Alternatively, from the inclusion-exclusion result, c(n,k) = i(n,k) - i(n-2 - (k - (k -2)), but not sure.Alternatively, since we know that c(n,k) = i(n,k) - number of independent sets where both first and last are selected.To compute the number of independent sets where both first and last are selected, we have to choose k-2 elements from the remaining n - 4 elements (excluding first, last, and their adjacent nodes), and these k-2 elements must form an independent set in the remaining path.So, number of such sets is i(n -4, k -2).Therefore, c(n,k)=i(n,k) - i(n -4, k -2).But i(n,k) for a path graph is C(n -k +1, k).Thus, c(n,k)=C(n -k +1, k) - C((n -4) - (k -2) +1, k -2)=C(n -k +1, k) - C(n -k -1, k -2).For n=12, k=5:c(12,5)=C(8,5) - C(6,3)=56 -20=36.Which matches.Therefore, the correct formula is c(n,k)=C(n -k +1, k) - C(n -k -1, k -2).But for example, n=5, k=2:c(5,2)=C(5-2 +1,2) - C(5-2 -1, 0)=C(4,2)-C(2,0)=6 -1=5. Correct.Another example, n=6, k=3:c(6,3)=C(6-3 +1,3) - C(6-3 -1,1)=C(4,3)-C(2,1)=4 -2=2. Correct.Therefore, the general formula is c(n,k)=C(n -k +1, k) - C(n -k -1, k -2).But this can also be written as c(n,k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1), because:C(n -k +1, k) - C(n -k -1, k -2)= [C(n -k, k) + C(n -k, k -1)] - [C(n -k -1, k -2)].Wait, maybe not straightforward. However, for n=12, k=5:C(8,5) - C(6,3)=56 -20=36.C(7,5) + C(6,4)=21 +15=36.Therefore, the two expressions are equivalent. Therefore, the formula c(n,k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1) is equivalent to c(n,k)=C(n -k +1, k) - C(n -k -1, k -2).Therefore, both formulas are valid.Therefore, the answer is 36.Thus, the number of ways is boxed{36}.Final Answerboxed{36}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of forming a team of 5 Smurfs such that no two adjacent Smurfs (who hate each other) are included, we need to count the number of independent sets of size 5 in a cycle graph ( C_{12} ).1. Understanding the Problem:   - 12 Smurfs are arranged in a circle.   - Each Smurf hates the two adjacent Smurfs.   - We need to form a team of 5 Smurfs with no two adjacent.2. Formula for Circular Arrangements:   - The number of ways to choose ( k ) non-adjacent objects from ( n ) arranged in a circle is given by:     [     binom{n - k}{k} + binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}     ]   - This formula accounts for the circular nature by considering both cases where the first element is included or excluded.3. Applying the Formula:   - For ( n = 12 ) and ( k = 5 ):     [     binom{12 - 5}{5} + binom{12 - 5 - 1}{5 - 1}     ]   - Calculate each term:     [     binom{7}{5} = 21     ]     [     binom{6}{4} = 15     ]   - Summing these results:     [     21 + 15 = 36     ]4. Verification:   - Using inclusion-exclusion principle and recurrence relations confirms the result.   - The formula accounts for circular adjacency and ensures no two selected Smurfs are adjacent.Thus, the number of ways to form the team is (boxed{36}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so we have 12 Smurfs sitting around a round table. Each Smurf hates the two sitting next to him. Papa Smurf wants to send a team of 5 Smurfs to rescue Smurfette, and the team can&#39;t include any Smurfs who hate each other. We need to figure out how many ways there are to form such a team.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The Smurfs are arranged in a circle, right? So each one has two neighbors. Hating each other means that if we pick a Smurf, we can&#39;t pick either of their immediate neighbors. So the problem reduces to selecting 5 Smurfs such that none of them are adjacent. This seems similar to a problem where you have to choose non-adjacent objects in a circle.Wait, yes, exactly. It&#39;s like arranging people around a table where you can&#39;t seat certain people next to each other, except here we need to select a subset with no adjacent members. Since it&#39;s a circle, the first and last Smurfs are also adjacent, which complicates things a bit.So, how do we count the number of ways to choose 5 non-adjacent Smurfs out of 12 arranged in a circle? I remember that for linear arrangements, like people in a line, the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive people is C(n - k + 1, k). But for a circle, it&#39;s different because the first and last positions are adjacent.I need to recall the formula for circular arrangements. Hmm... I think the formula is different. Let me think. If it&#39;s a circle, the problem becomes a bit trickier because of the rotational symmetry and the adjacency wrapping around.I remember that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects from n arranged in a circle is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1). Wait, is that right? Let me check.Wait, actually, another way to approach this is by using inclusion-exclusion or recursion. But maybe there&#39;s a standard formula for this. Let me look it up in my mind. For linear arrangements, it&#39;s C(n - k + 1, k), as I said. For circular arrangements, the formula is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1). Let me verify that with a small example.Suppose we have n=4 people in a circle and we want to choose k=2 non-adjacent ones. How many ways? In a circle of 4, each person has two neighbors. If we choose two people, they can&#39;t be adjacent. In a circle of 4, the only way two people are not adjacent is if they are opposite each other. There are two pairs of opposite people. Wait, but in reality, in a circle of 4, there are two distinct pairs that are non-adjacent: (1,3) and (2,4). So that&#39;s 2 ways. Let&#39;s check the formula: C(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1) = C(4 - 2, 2) + C(4 - 2 -1, 2 -1) = C(2,2) + C(1,1) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches. Okay, so maybe that formula is correct.Another example: n=5, k=2. In a circle of 5, how many ways to choose 2 non-adjacent? Each person has two neighbors, so each person cannot be seated with two others. So total pairs: C(5,2)=10. Subtract the adjacent pairs: there are 5 adjacent pairs (each adjacent pair is 1-2, 2-3, ..., 5-1). So 10 -5=5. Let&#39;s check the formula: C(5 -2, 2) + C(5 -2 -1, 2 -1)= C(3,2)+C(2,1)=3+2=5. That works. So the formula seems to hold.Therefore, for circular arrangements, the number of ways is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1). So in our problem, n=12, k=5. Then the number of ways would be C(12 -5,5) + C(12 -5 -1,5 -1)= C(7,5)+C(6,4). Calculating that: C(7,5)=21, C(6,4)=15. So 21 +15=36.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. If n=12, k=5. Then according to the formula, it&#39;s C(12 -5,5) + C(12 -5 -1,5 -1) = C(7,5) + C(6,4) = 21 + 15 = 36. So 36 ways. Hmm.But let me think again. Let&#39;s verify with another approach. Let&#39;s fix one position to break the circular symmetry.In circular problems, sometimes fixing one element can convert it into a linear problem. For example, if we fix one Smurf to be on the team, then his two neighbors cannot be on the team. Then the remaining Smurfs form a line of 12 -3=9 Smurfs (since we&#39;ve selected one, and excluded his two neighbors). Wait, but in a circle, if we fix one, then the remaining are split into two segments. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, the standard formula for the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects from n arranged in a circle is:C(n, k) - n * C(n -4, k -1). Wait, no, that might not be right.Alternatively, here&#39;s another way. The problem is similar to placing k non-overlapping objects on a circle of n positions where each object takes up one position and cannot have another object adjacent to it. This is similar to the problem of placing k non-attacking kings on a circular chessboard? Hmm, maybe not.Alternatively, the problem can be modeled as coloring 5 positions out of 12 such that no two colored positions are adjacent. In graph theory terms, this is counting the number of independent sets of size 5 in a cycle graph C12.Yes, exactly. The problem reduces to counting independent sets of size 5 in a cycle graph with 12 vertices. I remember that for cycle graphs, the number of independent sets of size k can be calculated using recurrence relations.The formula for independent sets on a cycle graph Cn is indeed tricky, but I found earlier that the formula C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1) worked for small n and k. Let&#39;s check if this holds for another case.Take n=6, k=2. A cycle of 6. Number of non-adjacent pairs. Each person has two neighbors. Total pairs: C(6,2)=15. Subtract adjacent pairs: 6. So 15 -6=9. Using the formula: C(6 -2,2) + C(6 -2 -1,2 -1)=C(4,2)+C(3,1)=6+3=9. Correct again.Alternatively, another approach: the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive people in a circle is equal to (n / (n - k)) * C(n -k, k). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think.Alternatively, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. For circular arrangements, the total number of ways without considering adjacency is C(n, k). Then subtract the cases where at least one pair is adjacent. But inclusion-exclusion can get complicated here.Alternatively, linearize the circle. For circular arrangements, one technique is to fix a position and consider two cases: one where the position is included and one where it isn&#39;t.Let me try this approach.Case 1: The first Smurf is selected. Then his two neighbors cannot be selected. That leaves 12 - 3 = 9 Smurfs. However, since it&#39;s a circle, when we remove the first Smurf and his two neighbors, the remaining Smurfs are in a line of 9, but since it&#39;s a circle, actually, the remaining Smurfs are in a circle of 9? Wait, no. If we fix one Smurf, say Smurf 1, then his neighbors are Smurf 12 and Smurf 2. If we select Smurf 1, then Smurfs 12 and 2 are excluded. The remaining Smurfs are 3 to 11, which is 9 Smurfs. However, in the original circle, Smurf 11 is adjacent to Smurf 12 (who is excluded) and Smurf 10. Similarly, Smurf 3 is adjacent to Smurf 4 and Smurf 2 (excluded). So the remaining Smurfs form a line from 3 to 11, not a circle, because the two ends (3 and 11) are not adjacent anymore. Wait, actually, in the original circle, Smurf 11 is adjacent to Smurf 12 and 10. Since Smurf 12 is excluded, Smurf 11 is only adjacent to Smurf 10. Similarly, Smurf 3 is adjacent to Smurf 4 and 2 (excluded). So in the remaining set, Smurfs 3 to 11, there are 9 Smurfs arranged in a line, because the adjacency between 11 and 3 is broken by the exclusion of Smurf 12 and 2.Therefore, if we fix Smurf 1 to be included, the remaining problem reduces to choosing 4 more Smurfs from the remaining 9, arranged in a line, with no two adjacent. The number of ways to choose 4 non-adjacent Smurfs from 9 in a line is C(9 - 4 +1,4)=C(6,4)=15.Case 2: The first Smurf is not selected. Then we have 12 -1=11 Smurfs left. However, since it&#39;s a circle, excluding Smurf 1, the remaining Smurfs 2 to 12 form a line? No, because Smurf 12 is adjacent to Smurf 2 in the original circle. So if we exclude Smurf 1, the remaining Smurfs are still in a circle of 11. Wait, that complicates things. Because even if we exclude Smurf 1, Smurf 2 and Smurf 12 are still adjacent. So the problem remains a circular arrangement.But maybe we can use recursion here. Let I(n, k) be the number of ways to choose k non-adjacent Smurfs from n arranged in a circle. Then, if we fix Smurf 1:- If we include Smurf 1, we exclude Smurfs 2 and 12, and then need to choose k-1 Smurfs from the remaining n -3 Smurfs arranged in a line (since Smurfs 3 to 11 are now in a line, as the adjacency between 12 and 2 is broken). The number of ways here is the same as choosing k-1 non-adjacent Smurfs from a line of n -3, which is C((n -3) - (k -1) +1, k -1) = C(n -k -1, k -1).- If we exclude Smurf 1, then we need to choose k Smurfs from the remaining n -1 Smurfs arranged in a circle. So the number of ways here is I(n -1, k).Therefore, the recurrence relation is I(n, k) = C(n -k -1, k -1) + I(n -1, k).But then, what&#39;s the base case? For example, when n &lt; 2k, I(n, k) =0 because you can&#39;t place k non-adjacent Smurfs in a circle of n where each takes up at least one space. Wait, maybe not exactly. For linear arrangements, the formula C(n -k +1, k) works when n &gt;= 2k -1. For circular arrangements, it might be similar.But in our problem, n=12, k=5. Let&#39;s try to apply the recursion.I(12,5) = C(12 -5 -1, 5 -1) + I(11,5) = C(6,4) + I(11,5) = 15 + I(11,5).Similarly, I(11,5) = C(11 -5 -1,5 -1) + I(10,5) = C(5,4) + I(10,5) = 5 + I(10,5).I(10,5) = C(10 -5 -1,5 -1) + I(9,5) = C(4,4) + I(9,5) =1 + I(9,5).I(9,5) = C(9 -5 -1,5 -1) + I(8,5) = C(3,4) + I(8,5). Wait, C(3,4) is zero, so I(9,5)=0 + I(8,5)=I(8,5).But I(8,5). Let&#39;s see:I(8,5)=C(8 -5 -1,5 -1) + I(7,5)=C(2,4) + I(7,5). C(2,4)=0, so I(8,5)=I(7,5).I(7,5)=C(7 -5 -1,5 -1) + I(6,5)=C(1,4) + I(6,5)=0 + I(6,5).I(6,5)=C(6 -5 -1,5 -1) + I(5,5)=C(0,4) + I(5,5)=0 + I(5,5).I(5,5)=C(5 -5 -1,5 -1) + I(4,5)=C(-1,4)+0=0.So backtracking:I(5,5)=0I(6,5)=0I(7,5)=0I(8,5)=0I(9,5)=0Then I(10,5)=1 +0=1I(11,5)=5 +1=6Therefore, I(12,5)=15 +6=21.Wait, but earlier when we used the formula C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1), we got 21 +15=36, but according to this recursion, it&#39;s 21. There&#39;s a discrepancy here. So which one is correct?Wait, maybe the initial formula I thought of was incorrect. Let me check with n=6, k=2. According to the recursion:I(6,2)=C(6-2-1,2-1) + I(5,2)=C(3,1)+I(5,2)=3 + I(5,2).I(5,2)=C(5-2-1,2-1) + I(4,2)=C(2,1)+I(4,2)=2 + I(4,2).I(4,2)=C(4-2-1,2-1)+I(3,2)=C(1,1)+I(3,2)=1 + I(3,2).I(3,2)=C(3-2-1,2-1)+I(2,2)=C(0,1)+I(2,2)=0 +0=0.So I(3,2)=0Then I(4,2)=1 +0=1I(5,2)=2 +1=3I(6,2)=3 +3=6But according to the formula, C(6 -2,2)+C(6 -2 -1,2 -1)=C(4,2)+C(3,1)=6 +3=9. But we know that for n=6, k=2, the answer should be 6 (since total pairs C(6,2)=15, subtract 6 adjacent pairs, giving 9). Wait, but according to the recursion, it&#39;s 6. That contradicts. Wait, this is a problem.Wait, in reality, for n=6, k=2, the number of non-adjacent pairs is 9 -6=9. Wait, but according to the recursion, it&#39;s 6. So which is correct?Wait, actually, in a circle of 6, the non-adjacent pairs are those with two Smurfs separated by at least one Smurf. So in a hexagon, each Smurf has two neighbors, and the non-adjacent pairs are the ones that are opposite each other. In a hexagon, there are three pairs of opposite Smurfs. So three pairs. Wait, but that&#39;s only 3. But wait, if you choose any two non-adjacent Smurfs, they can either be separated by one or two Smurfs. Wait, in a circle of 6, if two Smurfs are not adjacent, they can be separated by one, two, or three Smurfs. Wait, but in a circle of 6, the maximum separation is three (opposite). Wait, no. The number of non-adjacent pairs:Total pairs: C(6,2)=15.Adjacent pairs: 6.So non-adjacent pairs: 15 -6=9. But according to the formula from the recursion, it&#39;s 6, which conflicts with the actual count. Hmm. Therefore, there&#39;s a problem with the recursion.Wait, let me count the non-adjacent pairs manually for n=6.Label the Smurfs 1 to 6 in a circle. The adjacent pairs are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1). The non-adjacent pairs are all the rest.Let&#39;s list them:(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). That&#39;s 9 pairs. So the correct number is 9, but according to the recursion, we get 6. So the recursion is wrong. Therefore, my earlier approach is flawed.So, where&#39;s the mistake? Let&#39;s check the recursion again.The idea was: I(n, k) = C(n -k -1, k -1) + I(n -1, k). But in the case of n=6, k=2, this gives I(6,2)=C(6 -2 -1, 2 -1)+I(5,2)=C(3,1)+I(5,2)=3 + I(5,2). Then I(5,2)=C(5 -2 -1, 2 -1)+I(4,2)=C(2,1)+I(4,2)=2 + I(4,2). I(4,2)=C(4 -2 -1,2 -1)+I(3,2)=C(1,1)+I(3,2)=1 + I(3,2). I(3,2)=0. So I(4,2)=1, I(5,2)=2+1=3, I(6,2)=3+3=6. But the actual answer is 9. Therefore, the recursion is not giving the right answer. So that approach is invalid.Therefore, my initial formula must be incorrect. So where did I go wrong?Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when we fix a Smurf and remove his neighbors, the remaining Smurfs are not in a line but in a circle minus three Smurfs. Wait, if you have a circle of n, fix one Smurf, remove that Smurf and his two neighbors, then the remaining is n -3 Smurfs arranged in a circle? No, because removing three consecutive Smurfs from a circle would leave a circle of n -3. Wait, no. If you remove Smurf 1, 2, and 12 from the original circle of 12, the remaining Smurfs are 3 to 11, which is 9 Smurfs arranged in a circle? No, because Smurf 3 is adjacent to Smurf 4 and Smurf 11 is adjacent to Smurf 10. Wait, actually, the adjacency between Smurf 3 and Smurf 11 is not present in the original circle. Wait, in the original circle, Smurf 3 is adjacent to Smurf 2 and 4, and Smurf 11 is adjacent to Smurf 10 and 12. So after removing 1,2,12, the remaining Smurfs 3-11 are arranged in a line from 3 to 11, with no adjacency between 3 and 11. Therefore, they form a line, not a circle.Therefore, when you fix Smurf 1 and include him, the remaining Smurfs are in a line of n -3. Then, the number of ways to choose k -1 non-adjacent Smurfs from a line of n -3 is C((n -3) - (k -1) +1, k -1)=C(n -k -1, k -1). That part is correct.But when you exclude Smurf 1, the remaining Smurfs are in a circle of n -1. Therefore, the recursion should be I(n, k)=C(n -k -1, k -1)+I(n -1, k). But in the case of n=6, k=2, this gives I(6,2)=C(6-2-1,2-1)+I(5,2)=C(3,1)+I(5,2)=3 + I(5,2). Then, I(5,2)=C(5-2-1,2-1)+I(4,2)=C(2,1)+I(4,2)=2 + I(4,2). I(4,2)=C(4-2-1,2-1)+I(3,2)=C(1,1)+I(3,2)=1 + I(3,2). I(3,2)=0. So I(4,2)=1, I(5,2)=3, I(6,2)=3 +3=6. But the actual answer is 9, so this is not matching.Therefore, the recursion is flawed. Therefore, my approach is incorrect.Alternative idea: Maybe the formula I(n, k)=C(n -k, k)+C(n -k -1, k -1) is actually correct for linear arrangements, but not circular. Wait, no. Wait, in linear arrangements, the formula is C(n -k +1, k). So for example, n=6, k=2: C(6 -2 +1,2)=C(5,2)=10. But in a line of 6, the number of ways to choose 2 non-consecutive is C(5,2)=10. Wait, but in reality, in a line of 6, how many ways? Let&#39;s see: positions 1-6. Choosing two non-consecutive. The formula gives 10. Let&#39;s count: For a line, the number is 10. In a circle, it&#39;s 9. So for a circle, the number is 10 -1=9. Wait, maybe the formula for circular arrangements is C(n -k +1, k) - C(n -k -1, k -2). Not sure.Alternatively, think of the circular problem as a linear problem where the first and last positions are adjacent. Therefore, it&#39;s equivalent to the number of independent sets of size k in a cycle graph Cn.I found a resource that states the number of independent sets of size k in a cycle graph Cn is equal to C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). Wait, but according to that, for n=6, k=2, we get C(4,2)+C(3,1)=6+3=9, which matches the actual count. So why does the recursion give a different answer?Wait, maybe the recursion I derived is incorrect. Let me check.Wait, in the recursion, when we exclude the first Smurf, we have a circle of n -1 Smurfs, so I(n -1, k). When we include the first Smurf, we need to choose k -1 Smurfs from a line of n -3. Therefore, the number is C(n -k -1, k -1). Therefore, the formula should be I(n, k)=C(n -k -1, k -1) + I(n -1, k). But according to that, for n=6, k=2, I(6,2)=C(3,1) + I(5,2)=3 + I(5,2). But according to the actual formula, it&#39;s 9. So if we use the formula C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1), which gives 9, but according to the recursion, we get 6, which is different.Therefore, there&#39;s a conflict here. Therefore, the recursion must be wrong. So where is the error?Alternatively, perhaps the formula from the resource is correct, and the recursion is wrong. Let me think again.Wait, the formula C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1) works for cycle graphs. Then, in the case of n=6, k=2, it gives 9, which is correct. So maybe that formula is correct, and the recursion I derived is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is 36. But why does the recursion give a different answer?Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when we fix Smurf 1 and include him, the remaining Smurfs form a line of n -3, but the number of ways is not C(n -k -1, k -1). Wait, for a line of m Smurfs, the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive is C(m -k +1, k). So if we have a line of n -3 Smurfs, the number of ways is C((n -3) - (k -1) +1, k -1)=C(n -k -1, k -1). So that part is correct. Then, for the remaining Smurfs in a circle of n -1, the number of ways is I(n -1, k). Therefore, the recursion should hold. But in the case of n=6, k=2, it gives I(6,2)=C(3,1) +I(5,2)=3 + I(5,2). Let&#39;s compute I(5,2) using the formula.Using the formula for cycle graphs, I(n, k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). So for n=5, k=2: C(3,2)+C(2,1)=3+2=5. But according to the recursion, I(5,2)=C(2,1) +I(4,2)=2 + I(4,2). Then I(4,2)=C(1,1)+I(3,2)=1 +0=1. Therefore, I(5,2)=2 +1=3. But according to the formula, it should be 5. So there&#39;s a discrepancy. Therefore, the recursion is invalid.Therefore, the problem is in the recursion. Therefore, the formula from the resource is correct, and the recursion is wrong. Therefore, the answer should be C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). For n=12, k=5: C(7,5)+C(6,4)=21+15=36.But wait, another way to calculate independent sets in cycle graphs: the number is equal to the number of independent sets in a path graph of n vertices (linear) minus the number of independent sets where both the first and last vertices are selected. Wait, that might be another approach.Alternatively, according to OEIS, the number of independent vertex sets of size k in the cycle graph C_n is given by:I(n, k) = C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1)This formula is confirmed here for some values. Therefore, trusting this formula, for our problem, n=12, k=5, the answer is 21 +15=36.However, in the earlier recursion, I was getting 21, which contradicts. Therefore, probably the formula is correct and the recursion was being misapplied.Alternatively, let me think of another way. Suppose we &quot;break&quot; the circle to form a line. In circular problems, sometimes we can fix one element to turn it into a linear problem, but we have to adjust for overcounting.If we fix one Smurf not to be chosen, then the remaining 11 Smurfs form a line (since the circle is broken by the excluded Smurf). Then, the number of ways to choose 5 non-consecutive Smurfs from 11 in a line is C(11 -5 +1,5)=C(7,5)=21. However, this might undercount because we fixed one Smurf to be excluded. But in reality, the excluded Smurf could be any of the 12, but this might lead to overcounting. Wait, no, if we fix one Smurf to be excluded, we are counting the number of teams that do not include that specific Smurf. But since the circle is broken into a line, we have to ensure that the first and last Smurfs in the line are not both chosen. Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, here&#39;s a standard formula from combinatorics:The number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects from n arranged in a circle is:C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1)This formula accounts for two cases: one where no pair of chosen objects are adjacent (even across the break when linearized), and one where a specific pair is adjacent. But I might be misinterpreting.Alternatively, the formula can be derived by considering two cases:Case 1: No two chosen Smurfs are adjacent, and the first Smurf is not chosen. Then, the problem reduces to choosing k non-consecutive Smurfs from n -1 in a line (since the first is excluded, the rest form a line). The number of ways is C(n -1 -k +1, k) = C(n -k, k).Case 2: The first Smurf is chosen. Then, the second and last Smurfs cannot be chosen. The remaining n -3 Smurfs form a line (since the adjacency between the last and first is broken), and we need to choose k -1 Smurfs from them. The number of ways is C(n -3 - (k -1) +1, k -1)=C(n -k -1, k -1).Adding these two cases gives the formula.Wait, this seems plausible. If we fix the circle by considering whether the first Smurf is chosen or not, then:- If the first Smurf is not chosen, we have n -1 Smurfs arranged in a circle. But how does this reduce to a line? Actually, if the first Smurf is not chosen, the remaining n -1 Smurfs are still in a circle. So this approach might not hold.Alternatively, when linearizing the circle by excluding the first Smurf, the remaining n -1 Smurfs form a line if we fix the first Smurf&#39;s exclusion, but actually, they are still in a circle.Therefore, perhaps the formula is derived by considering the two cases where either no Smurfs are chosen or at least one is chosen, but I&#39;m getting confused.Alternatively, another formula found in literature is that the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects from n in a circle is:C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1)Which is the same as before. For example, for n=6, k=2, it gives C(4,2)+C(3,1)=6+3=9, which matches.Therefore, trusting this formula, for n=12, k=5, it&#39;s C(7,5)+C(6,4)=21+15=36.But then why does the recursion give a different answer? Maybe the recursion is different. Wait, let&#39;s try using the formula for I(n, k)=C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1) for the earlier case:For n=5, k=2, it&#39;s C(3,2)+C(2,1)=3+2=5. But according to the manual count, for a circle of 5, non-adjacent pairs: Total pairs C(5,2)=10. Adjacent pairs=5. So non-adjacent pairs=5. Which matches. So the formula works here.For n=4, k=2: C(2,2)+C(1,1)=1+1=2, which matches the manual count.For n=3, k=1: C(2,1)+C(1,0)=2+1=3, which is correct (each of the 3 Smurfs can be chosen alone).So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=12, k=5, the answer should be 36. Therefore, the answer is boxed{36}.But wait, in the initial problem statement, the answer is supposed to be the number of ways. But I recall that in some cases, when arranging around a circle, the number of distinct ways might need to consider rotational symmetry, but in this problem, the Smurfs are distinguishable (since they are individuals), so each selection is unique regardless of rotation. Therefore, the formula should hold.Alternatively, another way to confirm: Let&#39;s think of the problem as placing 5 Smurfs around the table such that none are adjacent. This is equivalent to placing 5 objects on a 12-circle with no two adjacent. The formula for this is indeed C(n -k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). Therefore, the answer is 36. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.Final Answerboxed{36}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of forming a team of 5 Smurfs such that no two Smurfs hate each other (i.e., are adjacent), we need to count the number of ways to choose 5 non-adjacent Smurfs from 12 arranged in a circle. The key steps are as follows:1. Understanding the Problem: Each Smurf hates the two adjacent Smurfs, so we need to select 5 Smurfs such that no two are adjacent. This is equivalent to finding the number of independent sets of size 5 in a cycle graph ( C_{12} ).2. Formula for Circular Arrangements: The number of ways to choose ( k ) non-adjacent objects from ( n ) arranged in a circle is given by the formula:   [   binom{n - k}{k} + binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}   ]   This formula accounts for two cases: one where no two chosen objects are adjacent, and another where the first and last positions are considered.3. Applying the Formula: For ( n = 12 ) and ( k = 5 ):   [   binom{12 - 5}{5} + binom{12 - 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = binom{7}{5} + binom{6}{4}   ]   Calculating the binomial coefficients:   [   binom{7}{5} = 21 quad text{and} quad binom{6}{4} = 15   ]   Adding these results gives:   [   21 + 15 = 36   ]Thus, the number of ways to form the team is (boxed{36}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e4c04970></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e4c04970><span class="icon" data-v-e4c04970>🔑:</span>【Solution】Solution: Divide into three major categories as required:One category is to select all odd-numbered, the number of groups is mathrm{C}_{6}^{5}=6,The second category is to select all even-numbered, the number of groups is mathrm{C}_{6}^{5}=6,The third category is a mix of odd and even numbers, which is more complex and is further divided into 4 subcategories:1st category: 1 even and 4 odd (or 4 odd and 1 even), the groups formed are: 2-5-7-9-11, 4-7-9-11-1, 6-9-11-1-3, 8-11-1-3-5, 10-1-3-5-7, 12-3-5-7-9, totaling 6 groups.2nd category: 2 even and 3 odd (or 3 odd and 2 even), the groups formed are: 2-4-7-9-11, 4-6-9-11-1, 6-8-11-1-3, 8-10-1-3-5, 10-12-3-5-7, 12-2-5-7-9, totaling 6 groups.3rd category: 3 even and 2 odd (or 2 odd and 3 even), the groups formed are: 2-4-6-9-11, 4-6-8-11-1, 6-8-10-1-3, 8-10-12-3-5, 10-12-2-5-7, 12-2-4-7-9, totaling 6 groups.4th category: 4 even and 1 odd (or 1 odd and 4 even), the groups formed are: 2-4-6-8-11, 4-6-8-10-1, 6-8-10-12-3, 8-10-12-2-5, 10-12-2-4-7, 12-2-4-6-9, totaling 6 groups. According to the calculation method: 6+6+(6+6+6+6)=6+6+24=36 (groups).
