These quadratics must have two distinct roots that are powers of 7 with non-negative integer exponents. Also, the coefficients (in absolute value) shouldn&#39;t exceed 343^36. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, a quadratic trinomial with leading coefficient 1 has the form x² + bx + c, where b and c are integers. The roots are two distinct numbers that are powers of 7. Let&#39;s denote these roots as 7^m and 7^n, where m and n are non-negative integers and m ≠ n. Since the quadratic can be factored as (x - 7^m)(x - 7^n), expanding this gives x² - (7^m + 7^n)x + 7^{m + n}. So comparing this to the standard form x² + bx + c, we can see that:- b = -(7^m + 7^n)- c = 7^{m + n}But the problem states that the coefficients in absolute value shouldn&#39;t exceed 343^36. Let me note that 343 is 7^3, so 343^36 = (7^3)^36 = 7^{108}. Therefore, the absolute values of b and c must be ≤ 7^{108}.So, |b| = |7^m + 7^n| ≤ 7^{108} and |c| = 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}. Since 7^m and 7^n are positive, |b| is just 7^m + 7^n, and |c| is 7^{m + n}. Therefore, the conditions simplify to:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}2. 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}Which can be rewritten as:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}2. m + n ≤ 108But since m and n are non-negative integers with m ≠ n, we need to find all pairs (m, n) where m ≠ n, m and n are non-negative integers, such that both 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} and m + n ≤ 108. Wait, but if m + n ≤ 108, then 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}, which is required for c. But does 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} automatically hold if m + n ≤ 108?Let me check. Suppose m and n are such that m + n ≤ 108. Then, 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}, but does that imply 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}? Let&#39;s see. For example, if m = 0 and n = 108, then 7^0 + 7^108 = 1 + 7^{108} which is greater than 7^{108}. So in that case, the first condition would not hold, even though m + n = 108. Therefore, we need to consider both conditions.So actually, the two conditions are separate. So we need both:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}2. m + n ≤ 108So both conditions must be satisfied. Therefore, even if m + n ≤ 108, 7^m + 7^n might still exceed 7^{108}, so we can&#39;t ignore either condition. Therefore, we need to count pairs (m, n) where m ≠ n, m, n ≥ 0, m + n ≤ 108, and 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}.Alternatively, maybe we can find a relationship between the two conditions. Let me see. Let&#39;s suppose m ≤ n, so m &lt; n. Then, 7^m + 7^n = 7^m(1 + 7^{n - m}). Let&#39;s denote k = n - m, which is a positive integer. Then, the sum becomes 7^m(1 + 7^k). We need this sum to be ≤ 7^{108}. Similarly, m + n = m + m + k = 2m + k ≤ 108.So perhaps rephrasing in terms of m and k. Let me see if that helps.But maybe first, let&#39;s analyze the two inequalities:First, m + n ≤ 108. Since m &lt; n, we can write n = m + k where k ≥ 1. Then, m + (m + k) = 2m + k ≤ 108. So 2m + k ≤ 108. Also, 7^m + 7^{m + k} ≤ 7^{108}. Let&#39;s factor out 7^m:7^m(1 + 7^k) ≤ 7^{108}Therefore, 7^m ≤ 7^{108}/(1 + 7^k)Which implies m ≤ log_7(7^{108}/(1 + 7^k)) = 108 - log_7(1 + 7^k)But log_7(1 + 7^k) is approximately k when k is large, but let&#39;s see.Alternatively, since 1 + 7^k ≤ 2*7^k for k ≥ 1, because 1 ≤ 7^k for k ≥ 1. Therefore, 7^m * (1 + 7^k) ≤ 7^m * 2*7^k = 2*7^{m + k} ≤ 7^{108}But 2*7^{m + k} ≤ 7^{108} implies 7^{m + k} ≤ 7^{108}/2. Since 7^{108}/2 is less than 7^{108}, but m + k = n, which is part of the original condition. Wait, but m + k + m = 2m + k ≤ 108. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe m + k ≤ 108. Wait, but m + n = m + (m + k) = 2m + k ≤ 108, so that&#39;s different from m + k. So perhaps the two conditions need to be considered separately.Alternatively, since 7^m + 7^n = 7^m(1 + 7^{n - m}) ≤ 7^{108}Assuming m &lt; n, so let’s let d = n - m ≥ 1.So 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 7^{108}Therefore, 1 + 7^d ≤ 7^{108 - m}But 1 + 7^d ≤ 7^{108 - m}Given that 1 + 7^d ≤ 2*7^d (since 1 ≤ 7^d for d ≥ 1), so 2*7^d ≤ 7^{108 - m}Thus, 2 ≤ 7^{108 - m - d}Which would imply that 108 - m - d ≥ 1, since 7^{1} = 7 &gt; 2. Therefore, 108 - m - d ≥ 1 =&gt; m + d ≤ 107.But d = n - m, so m + d = n. Therefore, n ≤ 107. But since m &lt; n, m can be up to n - 1. But n ≤ 107. Hmm, not sure if this line of reasoning is helpful.Alternatively, since 1 + 7^d ≤ 7^{108 - m}, and 1 + 7^d is approximately 7^d when d is large. So for this inequality to hold, 7^d must be less than or equal to 7^{108 - m}, so d ≤ 108 - m. But since d is a positive integer, then 1 ≤ d ≤ 108 - m. So, for each m, d can be from 1 to 108 - m. However, we also have the condition 2m + d ≤ 108 because n = m + d and m + n = 2m + d ≤ 108.Therefore, combining these two conditions:For each m, d must satisfy:1. 1 ≤ d ≤ 108 - m (from 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 7^{108})2. d ≤ 108 - 2m (from 2m + d ≤ 108)Therefore, for each m, the maximum d is the minimum of (108 - m) and (108 - 2m). So the allowable d for each m is from 1 to min(108 - m, 108 - 2m). But we need to make sure that 108 - 2m is non-negative. So 108 - 2m ≥ 0 =&gt; m ≤ 54. So if m ≤ 54, then min(108 - m, 108 - 2m) = 108 - 2m if m ≥ 0. Wait, let&#39;s check:For m = 0: min(108 - 0, 108 - 0) = 108. So d can be 1 to 108. But 2m + d = 0 + d ≤ 108 =&gt; d ≤ 108, which is already covered.For m = 1: min(108 - 1=107, 108 - 2=106) =&gt; 106. So d ≤ 106.Similarly, for m = 54: min(108 - 54=54, 108 - 108=0). Wait, 108 - 2*54 = 0. So min(54, 0) = 0. But d must be at least 1. Therefore, for m = 54, d would have to be ≤ 0, but since d ≥ 1, this is impossible. So actually, for m ≥ 54.5, but m is integer, so m ≥ 55, 108 - 2m becomes negative. Therefore, for m ≥ 55, the second condition d ≤ 108 - 2m would be negative, which is impossible, so no solutions for m ≥ 55.Wait, so for m from 0 to 54, inclusive, the maximum d is min(108 - m, 108 - 2m). Let&#39;s check for m = 54:108 - m = 54, 108 - 2m = 0. So min is 0, but since d must be at least 1, there are no solutions for m = 54. Therefore, actually, the upper limit for m is where 108 - 2m ≥ 1. Let&#39;s solve 108 - 2m ≥ 1 =&gt; m ≤ 53.5. So m ≤ 53.Therefore, m ranges from 0 to 53, inclusive. For each m from 0 to 53, the maximum d is min(108 - m, 108 - 2m). Let&#39;s check which is smaller between 108 - m and 108 - 2m.For m from 0 to 53:108 - m is decreasing as m increases.108 - 2m is also decreasing as m increases, but twice as fast.At m = 0: 108 - 0 = 108, 108 - 0 = 108. So min is 108.At m = 1: 108 - 1 = 107, 108 - 2 = 106. So min is 106.At m = 2: 108 - 2 = 106, 108 - 4 = 104. So min is 104.Continuing this, each m increases by 1, 108 - m decreases by 1, and 108 - 2m decreases by 2.We can find when 108 - m becomes less than 108 - 2m. Let&#39;s set 108 - m = 108 - 2m =&gt; -m = -2m =&gt; m = 0. So actually, for m &gt; 0, 108 - 2m is always less than 108 - m. Therefore, for m ≥ 1, the minimum is 108 - 2m.Wait, let&#39;s test m = 1:108 - m = 107, 108 - 2m = 106. So 108 - 2m is smaller. For m = 2: 108 - 2m = 104, which is smaller than 108 - m = 106. So yes, starting from m = 1, 108 - 2m is smaller. Therefore, for m ≥ 1, the maximum d is 108 - 2m.But for m = 0, it&#39;s 108 - 0 = 108. So m = 0 is a special case. Therefore, for m from 0 to 53:- When m = 0, d can be from 1 to 108- When m = 1 to 53, d can be from 1 to 108 - 2mBut we also need to check that 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 7^{108}Wait, even if d ≤ 108 - 2m, does this ensure that 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 7^{108}? Let&#39;s verify.If d ≤ 108 - 2m, then m + d ≤ 108 - m. Therefore, 7^{m + d} ≤ 7^{108 - m}But 1 + 7^d ≤ 2*7^d (since d ≥ 1)So 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 2*7^{m + d} ≤ 2*7^{108 - m}But for this to be ≤ 7^{108}, we need 2*7^{108 - m} ≤ 7^{108} =&gt; 2 ≤ 7^mWhich is true when m ≥ 1, since 7^1 = 7 ≥ 2. Therefore, for m ≥ 1, 2*7^{108 - m} ≤ 7^{108} requires m ≥ 1. But m is at least 1 here, so that&#39;s okay.Wait, but actually:Wait, 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 7^{108}If d ≤ 108 - 2m, then m + d ≤ 108 - mTherefore, 7^{m + d} ≤ 7^{108 - m}But 1 + 7^d ≤ 7^{m + d} if m ≥ 1. Wait, maybe not.Wait, let&#39;s take m = 1, d = 106 (max d for m = 1 is 108 - 2*1 = 106). Then:7^1(1 + 7^{106}) = 7 + 7^{107} = 7^{107} + 7. Now, compare to 7^{108}.7^{107} + 7 is much less than 7^{108} because 7^{107} is 1/7 of 7^{108}. Similarly, adding 7 is negligible. So, 7^{107} + 7 &lt; 7^{108}.Similarly, for m = 1 and d = 106, 7^m(1 + 7^d) = 7*(1 + 7^{106}) ≈ 7^{107} which is less than 7^{108}. So that&#39;s okay.Similarly, for m = 53, d is 108 - 2*53 = 108 - 106 = 2. So d = 2.Then, 7^{53}(1 + 7^2) = 7^{53}(1 + 49) = 7^{53}*50. Compare to 7^{108}.50*7^{53} is way less than 7^{108}, since 50/7^{55} is negligible. So yes, that&#39;s okay.Therefore, for m from 1 to 53, the condition d ≤ 108 - 2m ensures that 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 7^{108}.For m = 0, d can be up to 108. Then, 7^0*(1 + 7^d) = 1 + 7^d ≤ 7^{108}Which would require that 7^d ≤ 7^{108} - 1. Since 7^{108} - 1 is just one less than 7^{108}, so 7^d must be ≤ 7^{108} - 1. Therefore, d ≤ 108.Since d is an integer, d ≤ 108. So that&#39;s okay. So for m = 0, d can be from 1 to 108, inclusive.Therefore, summarizing:- For m = 0: d = 1 to 108- For m = 1 to 53: d = 1 to (108 - 2m)- For m ≥ 54: no solutionsBut since m and n are non-negative integers with m &lt; n, and each pair (m, n) corresponds to a unique quadratic (since the roots are distinct), but we have to ensure that we don&#39;t count duplicates when swapping m and n.Wait, but in our setup, we fixed m &lt; n. So each pair (m, n) where m &lt; n is unique. Therefore, the total number of quadratics is equal to the number of such pairs (m, n) where m &lt; n, m and n are non-negative integers, 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}, and m + n ≤ 108. But we&#39;ve transformed this into m from 0 to 53, with d = 1 to (108 - 2m) for m ≥ 1, and m = 0 with d = 1 to 108.But let&#39;s compute the total number of pairs:For m = 0: d ranges from 1 to 108, so 108 pairs.For m from 1 to 53: For each m, d ranges from 1 to (108 - 2m). So the number of pairs for each m is (108 - 2m). Therefore, the total number here is the sum from m=1 to m=53 of (108 - 2m).Let&#39;s compute that sum.First, note that when m=1, term is 108 - 2*1 = 106When m=2, term is 108 - 4 = 104...When m=53, term is 108 - 106 = 2So this is an arithmetic sequence starting at 106, decreasing by 2 each time, ending at 2. Number of terms: from m=1 to m=53, which is 53 terms. Wait, but let&#39;s check the last term when m=53: 108 - 2*53 = 108 - 106 = 2. So the sequence is 106, 104, ..., 2. How many terms are there?The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence can be found by ((first term - last term)/common difference) + 1. Here, first term = 106, last term = 2, common difference = -2.Number of terms = ((106 - 2)/(-2)) + 1 = (104 / -2) + 1 = (-52) + 1 = -51. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, perhaps I should take absolute value. Wait, number of terms is ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1.Wait, formula: n = ((a_n - a_1)/d) + 1Here, a_1 = 106, a_n = 2, d = -2.So n = ((2 - 106)/(-2)) + 1 = (-104 / -2) + 1 = 52 + 1 = 53. Yes, 53 terms. So the sum is (number of terms)*(first term + last term)/2 = 53*(106 + 2)/2 = 53*108/2 = 53*54 = 2862.Therefore, the total number of pairs is 108 (from m=0) + 2862 (from m=1 to m=53) = 108 + 2862 = 2970.But wait, hold on. However, we need to check if these pairs (m, n) actually satisfy both conditions. Wait, we assumed that if m ranges from 0 to 53 and d from 1 to the respective maximums, then both conditions are satisfied. But we should confirm.Earlier, we saw that for m=0, d=1 to 108, which gives n=1 to 108. Then, m + n = 0 + n = n. But n ≤ 108, so m + n = n ≤ 108. So that&#39;s okay. Also, 7^0 + 7^n = 1 + 7^n. We need to check that 1 + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}.Since n ≤ 108, 7^n ≤ 7^{108}, so 1 + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} + 1. But 1 + 7^{108} is greater than 7^{108}, right? Wait, no. Wait, if n=108, then 1 + 7^{108} which is greater than 7^{108}. So actually, for m=0 and d=108 (i.e., n=108), 7^0 + 7^{108} = 1 + 7^{108} &gt; 7^{108}, which violates the first condition. Therefore, our earlier assumption was incorrect. So even though we thought m=0 and d up to 108 would be okay, actually, when d=108, the sum 1 + 7^{108} exceeds 7^{108}. Therefore, we need to adjust our count for m=0.So, for m=0, d can be from 1 to 108, but we need 7^0 + 7^d ≤ 7^{108} =&gt; 1 + 7^d ≤ 7^{108}. Let&#39;s solve for d.1 + 7^d ≤ 7^{108}Which implies that 7^d ≤ 7^{108} - 1. Since 7^{108} - 1 &lt; 7^{108}, so 7^d &lt; 7^{108} =&gt; d &lt; 108. Therefore, d ≤ 107.Therefore, for m=0, d can be from 1 to 107, so n = 1 to 107. Therefore, m=0 contributes 107 pairs instead of 108. So correcting that.Similarly, check for m=0, d=107: 1 + 7^{107} ≤ 7^{108}? 7^{107} = 7^{108}/7, so 1 + 7^{107} = 1 + 7^{107} &lt; 7^{107} + 7^{107} = 2*7^{107} &lt; 7^{108} since 2 &lt; 7. Therefore, 1 + 7^{107} &lt; 7^{108}, so it&#39;s okay. Therefore, m=0, d=107 is allowed.But when d=108, m=0 gives 1 + 7^{108} which is more than 7^{108}, so not allowed. Therefore, the correct number of pairs for m=0 is 107.Similarly, when we considered m from 1 to 53, we need to check if for those pairs, 7^m + 7^{m + d} ≤ 7^{108}. Earlier, we thought that because d is bounded by 108 - 2m, the sum would be okay, but let&#39;s check a specific example.Take m=53, d=2: 7^{53} + 7^{55} = 7^{53}(1 + 7^2) = 7^{53}*50. Compare to 7^{108}. 50*7^{53} is much smaller than 7^{108} because 7^{108}/7^{53} = 7^{55}, and 50 is negligible compared to 7^{55}. So yes, that&#39;s okay.Take m=1, d=106: 7 + 7^{107}. 7^{107} is 7^{107}, and adding 7 is negligible. 7^{107} + 7 &lt; 7^{107} + 7^{107} = 2*7^{107} &lt; 7^{108} since 2 &lt; 7. Therefore, this is okay.Similarly, for m=1, d=106: 7^1 + 7^{107} ≤ 7^{108}Indeed, 7^{107} + 7 = 7*(7^{106} + 1) &lt; 7*7^{106} + 7^{106} = 7^{107} + 7^{106}, which is still less than 7^{108}. So yes, this is okay.Therefore, for m from 1 to 53, with d from 1 to (108 - 2m), the sum 7^m + 7^{m + d} = 7^m(1 + 7^d) ≤ 7^{108} is satisfied.Therefore, correcting the m=0 count from 108 to 107, the total number of pairs is 107 + 2862 = 2969.Wait, but let&#39;s check another case. For example, m=0, d=107: 1 + 7^{107} &lt; 7^{108}, which is true. But what about m=0, d=107: m + n = 0 + 107 = 107 ≤ 108, so satisfies the second condition. And the first condition is also satisfied. Similarly, for m=0, d=1: 1 + 7^1 = 8 ≤ 7^{108}, which is true.So, the corrected count for m=0 is 107. Then, the sum for m=1 to 53 is 2862. Therefore, total pairs are 107 + 2862 = 2969. But wait, 107 + 2862 = 2969? Let me compute 2862 + 100 = 2962, then +7 = 2969. Yes.But wait, before we proceed, let me confirm the sum for m=1 to 53. The sum is from m=1 to m=53 of (108 - 2m). Let&#39;s compute this again. First term when m=1: 108 - 2*1 = 106, last term when m=53: 108 - 2*53 = 108 - 106 = 2. The number of terms is 53. So, the sum is (106 + 2)/2 * 53 = 108/2 * 53 = 54 * 53 = 2862. Yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, total pairs: 107 + 2862 = 2969.But wait, but each pair (m, n) where m &lt; n gives a unique quadratic. But since quadratics are determined by their roots, two different pairs (m, n) and (n, m) would give the same quadratic. However, since we fixed m &lt; n, each quadratic is counted once. Therefore, the total number of distinct quadratics is 2969.But wait, the problem says &quot;distinct quadratic trinomials&quot;. So even if two different pairs (m, n) result in the same quadratic, we need to count them once. However, since we have fixed m &lt; n, and all pairs (m, n) with m &lt; n are unique, and given that m and n are exponents leading to different roots (since m ≠ n), then each quadratic is uniquely determined by its roots. Therefore, each pair (m, n) with m &lt; n gives a distinct quadratic. Therefore, the total number is 2969.Wait, but let&#39;s make sure. Suppose we have two different pairs (m1, n1) and (m2, n2) with m1 &lt; n1 and m2 &lt; n2. If they result in the same quadratic, then their coefficients must be the same. So:For (m1, n1) and (m2, n2), if -(7^{m1} + 7^{n1}) = -(7^{m2} + 7^{n2}) and 7^{m1 + n1} = 7^{m2 + n2}, then the quadratics are the same.So, this would require 7^{m1} + 7^{n1} = 7^{m2} + 7^{n2} and m1 + n1 = m2 + n2.Is there a possibility that two different pairs (m1, n1) and (m2, n2) with m1 &lt; n1 and m2 &lt; n2 satisfy these conditions?For example, take m1=0, n1=2: quadratic x² - (1 + 49)x + 49 = x² -50x +49Another pair m2=1, n2=1: but n2 must be greater than m2, so m2=1, n2=1 is invalid. Wait, m and n need to be distinct.Wait, suppose m1=0, n1=3 and m2=1, n2=2. Then check:Sum: 1 + 343 = 344 vs 7 + 49 = 56. Not equal.Product: 1*343 = 343 vs 7*49 = 343. Products are equal, but sums are different. So quadratics would be different.Another example: m1=0, n1=4 and m2=2, n2=2. But n2 must be &gt; m2. So m2=2, n2=2 is invalid. Suppose m1=0, n1= k and m2=a, n2=b with a &lt; b. Suppose m1 + n1 = a + b and 7^{m1} + 7^{n1} = 7^a + 7^b. Can this happen for different pairs?For instance, suppose m1=0, n1=3: sum =1 + 343=344, product=343.m2=1, n2=2: sum=7 + 49=56, product=343. Different sums, same product, so different quadratics.Another example: m1=0, n1=2: sum=1 + 49=50, product=49.m2=0, n2=2 is the same as m1=0, n1=2. If m1=1, n1=3: sum=7 + 343=350, product=7*343=2401. Is there another pair with product 2401? 2401=7^4. So m + n =4. Possible pairs: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2). But (2,2) is invalid. So (0,4) and (1,3). Then, sum for (0,4):1 + 7^4=1 + 2401=2402, sum for (1,3)=7 + 343=350. Different sums, same product. So different quadratics. Therefore, even if two pairs have the same product (c), but different sums (b), they are different quadratics. Therefore, the quadratics are uniquely determined by the pair (m,n) with m &lt; n. Hence, the total number is indeed the number of such pairs, which is 2969.But wait, according to our earlier calculation, we have 2969 pairs. But let&#39;s verify once again:- For m=0: d=1 to 107 (since d=108 is invalid), so 107 pairs.- For m=1 to 53: each m contributes (108 - 2m) pairs. Sum from m=1 to 53 of (108 - 2m) = 2862.- Total: 107 + 2862 = 2969.But let&#39;s check with a small example to see if our counting is correct.Suppose instead of 7^{108}, the coefficients must not exceed 7^3=343.So, suppose we set the max coefficient to 7^3. Then, following the same logic:For m=0: d=1 to 2 (since 1 + 7^3=1 + 343=344 &gt;343, so d=1,2.For m=0: d=1 and 2, so 2 pairs.For m=1: 108 - 2m =3 -2*1=1? Wait, but original problem&#39;s logic was for 108 exponent. If we set a smaller exponent, like 3, then:If the max coefficient is 7^3, then:Conditions:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^3=3432. m + n ≤3For example, let&#39;s compute all possible pairs:Possible (m,n) with m &lt; n:If m + n ≤3.Possible pairs:(0,1): m +n=1 ≤3. Check 7^0 +7^1=1+7=8 ≤343: yes.(0,2): sum=1+49=50 ≤343: yes. m +n=2 ≤3.(0,3): sum=1+343=344 &gt;343: no.(1,2): sum=7+49=56 ≤343. m +n=3 ≤3: yes.(1,3): m +n=4 &gt;3: no.(2,3): m +n=5 &gt;3: no.So total pairs: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). So 3 pairs.Using our formula:For m=0: d=1 to floor(log_7(343 -1))= floor(log_7(342))= floor(3.~)=3, but since 1 +7^3=344 &gt;343, so d=1,2: 2 pairs.For m=1: m can be 1. Then, max d=108 -2m=3 -2=1 (if using the original formula with 108 replaced by 3). Wait, but in this small example, it&#39;s not 108, so our formula may not apply directly.Alternatively, in the original problem, m ranges up to floor((108 -1)/2)=53.But in the small example, m +n ≤3, so for m ≥1, n ≥ m +1, so m + (m +1) ≤3 =&gt; 2m +1 ≤3 =&gt; m ≤1. So m=1 is allowed. For m=1, d can be up to 3 -2m=3 -2=1. So d=1. So pairs for m=1: 1 pair.Total pairs:2 +1=3. Which matches the manual count. Therefore, our formula works here.Similarly, if we set max exponent to 4, let&#39;s test.But perhaps this is enough. So returning to the original problem.Our total is 2969. But let me think again.Wait, 107 pairs for m=0, and 2862 for m=1 to 53. So 107 + 2862 = 2969. Therefore, the answer is 2969.But the problem says &quot;distinct quadratic trinomials&quot;. So each pair (m, n) with m &lt; n gives a unique trinomial because the roots are distinct (since m ≠ n) and the coefficients are determined uniquely by the roots. Therefore, there are no two different pairs that result in the same quadratic. Hence, 2969 is the answer.But wait, 2969 seems like an unusual number. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic.Wait, let&#39;s recalculate the sum from m=1 to 53 of (108 - 2m):This is an arithmetic series with first term a1=108 - 2*1=106, last term an=108 -2*53=2, number of terms=53.Sum = n*(a1 + an)/2 =53*(106 +2)/2=53*108/2=53*54.Compute 53*54:50*54=27003*54=162Total=2700+162=2862. Correct.Then, 2862 +107=2969. Correct.But 2969 is the number of pairs. However, the problem says &quot;powers of the number 7 with integer non-negative exponents&quot;. So roots are 7^m and 7^n where m and n are non-negative integers. So even if m or n is zero, 7^0=1 is allowed.Wait, but when m=0 and n=0, the root would be duplicate, but since m and n must be distinct, so m=0 and n=0 is not allowed. But in our counting, we considered m &lt; n, so m=0 and n≥1.Therefore, all pairs are valid, with distinct roots. Therefore, 2969 quadratics.But the answer is 2969? Let me check with another approach.Alternative approach:Each quadratic is determined by its roots r and s, which are distinct powers of 7. So r=7^m, s=7^n, m≠n, m,n≥0.The quadratic is (x -7^m)(x -7^n)=x² - (7^m +7^n)x +7^{m +n}.Conditions:1. |-(7^m +7^n)| ≤343^{36}=7^{108}2. |7^{m +n}| ≤7^{108}Since 7^{m +n} is positive, condition 2 simplifies to 7^{m +n} ≤7^{108} → m +n ≤108.Condition 1: 7^m +7^n ≤7^{108}So we need to count the number of pairs (m,n), m≠n, m,n≥0, such that:- m +n ≤108- 7^m +7^n ≤7^{108}Let’s consider all pairs where m ≤n. Then swap m and n if necessary, but since m and n are exponents, swapping would give the same quadratic. Wait, but actually, the quadratic is determined by the set {m, n}, so each unordered pair corresponds to one quadratic. But since we need to count distinct quadratics, we can consider unordered pairs {m, n} with m ≠n, m,n≥0, m +n ≤108, and 7^m +7^n ≤7^{108}.But in our previous approach, we considered ordered pairs (m,n) with m &lt;n, which counts each unordered pair once. So perhaps our previous count of 2969 is correct.But let&#39;s think of another way. Let&#39;s consider all possible exponents m and n where m &lt;n, and both m +n ≤108 and 7^m +7^n ≤7^{108}. How can we model this?For m &lt;n, since m &lt;n, we can write n =m +k where k ≥1. Then:m + (m +k) =2m +k ≤108and7^m +7^{m +k} =7^m(1 +7^k) ≤7^{108}Thus, 7^m(1 +7^k) ≤7^{108} → 1 +7^k ≤7^{108 -m}Since 1 +7^k ≤2*7^k for k ≥1, as before. So 2*7^k ≤7^{108 -m} →7^k ≤7^{108 -m}/2 →k ≤108 -m -log_7(2)But log_7(2) is less than 1, so k ≤108 -m -0. Something. Since k must be integer, k ≤108 -m -1=107 -mBut also from the first equation: 2m +k ≤108 →k ≤108 -2mThus, k is bounded by both 107 -m and 108 -2m. Which of these is stricter?107 -m vs 108 -2mSet 107 -m ≤108 -2m → -m ≤1 -2m → m ≤1So for m ≤1, 107 -m ≤108 -2m, and for m ≥2, 108 -2m ≤107 -m.Therefore, k is bounded by:- For m=0: k ≤107 (since 107 -0=107; also 108 -2*0=108, but 7^k +1 ≤7^{108} →k ≤107)- For m=1: k ≤min(107 -1=106, 108 -2=106). So k ≤106- For m=2: k ≤min(107 -2=105, 108 -4=104). So k ≤104- ...- For m=53: k ≤min(107 -53=54, 108 -106=2). So k ≤2Wait, this seems different from the previous analysis. Previously, we considered for m from 1 to53, k up to 108 -2m. But with the second condition from the inequality 7^m(1 +7^k) ≤7^{108}, we have k ≤107 -m.But for m ≥1, 107 -m is greater than 108 -2m when m ≥2, so the stricter condition is 108 -2m.Wait, perhaps my mistake earlier was not considering the inequality 1 +7^k ≤7^{108 -m}, which for m ≥1, 7^{108 -m} is at least 7^{107} (if m=1). Then, 1 +7^k ≤7^{107}.But 7^k ≤7^{107} -1. Therefore, k ≤107. But if m=1, then k is bounded by 108 -2*1=106. So even though k could be up to 107, the first condition (2m +k ≤108) restricts k to 106.But in reality, 1 +7^k ≤7^{108 -m} would require that 7^k &lt;7^{108 -m}, so k ≤108 -m -1.Therefore, k ≤min(108 -2m, 108 -m -1).For m=0: k ≤107 (from 1 +7^k ≤7^{108} →k ≤107) and k ≤108 (from 2*0 +k ≤108). So k ≤107.For m=1:k ≤108 -2*1=106 (from m +n=2m +k ≤108)andk ≤108 -1 -1=106 (from 1 +7^k ≤7^{108 -1}=7^{107} →k ≤107 -1=106)So both give k ≤106.For m=2:k ≤108 -4=104 (from 2m +k ≤108)andk ≤108 -2 -1=105 (from 1 +7^k ≤7^{106} →k ≤106 -1=105)Thus, k ≤104.Similarly, for m=2, k is limited by 104.Similarly, for m=3:k ≤108 -6=102 and k ≤108 -3 -1=104 →k ≤102.Continuing this, for m ≥1, the limit on k is the minimum of 108 -2m and 107 -m. Since for m ≥1:108 -2m vs107 -m108 -2m ≤107 -m ↔108 -2m ≤107 -m ↔108 -107 ≤m ↔1 ≤m, which is always true for m ≥1. Therefore, for m ≥1, the stricter condition is 108 -2m.Therefore, for m ≥1, k ≤108 -2m. For m=0, k ≤107. So this confirms our original counting.Therefore, the total number of pairs is:- For m=0: k=1 to107 →107 pairs- For m=1 to53: k=1 to108 -2m →sum_{m=1}^{53} (108 -2m) =2862 pairsTotal:107 +2862=2969.Therefore, the answer is 2969.But let me check once again with a different perspective.Suppose we list all pairs (m,n), m &lt;n, m +n ≤108, and 7^m +7^n ≤7^{108}.Since m &lt;n, n =m +k, k≥1. So the problem reduces to counting all (m,k) where m ≥0, k ≥1, 2m +k ≤108, and 7^m(1 +7^k) ≤7^{108}.Which is the same as m ≥0, k ≥1, 2m +k ≤108, and 1 +7^k ≤7^{108 -m}.But since 1 +7^k ≤7^{108 -m} implies 7^k &lt;7^{108 -m}, so k &lt;108 -m. Since k must be an integer, k ≤108 -m -1. Therefore, k ≤min(108 -m -1, 108 -2m). For m ≥1, 108 -2m ≤108 -m -1, so k ≤108 -2m. For m=0, k ≤107. Therefore, same as before.Hence, 2969.But the problem says &quot;powers of the number 7 with integer non-negative exponents&quot;. So roots are 7^m where m ≥0. So including m=0 (i.e., root=1) is allowed.Therefore, the answer should be 2969. However, let me confirm once more with another example.Take m=0, n=107: sum=1 +7^{107} which is less than7^{108}, since7^{107}=7^{108}/7. So1 +7^{107}=7^{107} +1 &lt;7^{107} +7^{107}=2*7^{107} &lt;7^{108} because2&lt;7.Therefore, this pair is valid.Similarly, m=53, n=55: m +n=108. But wait, m=53, n=55:53 +55=108. But in our counting, for m=53, k=2 (since n=m +k=53 +2=55), and k=2 is allowed because108 -2*53=2. Then,7^{53} +7^{55}=7^{53}(1 +7^2)=7^{53}*50 ≤7^{108}. Since50*7^{53}=50*7^{53} &lt;7^{56} (because7^3=343&gt;50, so50*7^{53} &lt;7^{3}*7^{53}=7^{56} ≤7^{108}). Hence, valid.Similarly, m=53, k=2 is allowed.Therefore, all the counted pairs are valid. Hence, 2969.But wait, the problem says &quot;distinct quadratic trinomials&quot;. Is there a possibility that different pairs (m,n) lead to the same coefficients?For example, could two different pairs (m1,n1) and (m2,n2) result in the same b and c? If so, they would be the same quadratic.Suppose (m1,n1) and (m2,n2) with m1 &lt;n1, m2 &lt;n2.If 7^{m1} +7^{n1} =7^{m2} +7^{n2} and7^{m1 +n1}=7^{m2 +n2}.This would imply that m1 +n1 =m2 +n2 and7^{m1} +7^{n1} =7^{m2} +7^{n2}.Is this possible?Assume without loss of generality that m1 &lt;n1 and m2 &lt;n2.Suppose m1 +n1 =m2 +n2=S, and7^{m1} +7^{S -m1}=7^{m2} +7^{S -m2}.Let’s denote x=7^{m1}, y=7^{m2}. Then, x +7^{S -m1}= y +7^{S -m2}.Suppose S is fixed. We need to see if there exist distinct m1 and m2 such that this equality holds.For example, take S=4:Possible pairs (0,4), (1,3), (2,2). Excluding (2,2):For (0,4):1 +7^4=1 +2401=2402For (1,3):7 +343=350Not equal.Another example, S=5:Pairs (0,5):1 +16807=16808(1,4):7 +2401=2408(2,3):49 +343=392None equal.Another example, S=6:(0,6):1 +7^6=1 +117649=117650(1,5):7 +16807=16814(2,4):49 +2401=2450(3,3): invalidNo equal sums.Another example, S=2:(0,2):1 +49=50(1,1):invalidAnother example, S=3:(0,3):1 +343=344(1,2):7 +49=56Not equal.So it seems like for a given S, the sums are unique. Hence, there are no two different pairs (m1,n1) and (m2,n2) with the same sum and product. Therefore, each pair corresponds to a unique quadratic.Thus, our count of 2969 should be correct.But to make sure, suppose there exists a case where different pairs have same sum and product. But given the exponential nature of 7, it&#39;s unlikely. Suppose 7^a +7^b =7^c +7^d and7^{a +b}=7^{c +d}. Then a +b =c +d and7^a +7^b =7^c +7^d. Without loss of generality, assume a ≤b and c ≤d and a ≤c.If a +b =c +d and7^a +7^b =7^c +7^d, then we can write this as:7^a(1 +7^{b -a})=7^c(1 +7^{d -c})Assuming a ≤c. If a &lt;c, then divide both sides by7^a:1 +7^{b -a}=7^{c -a}(1 +7^{d -c})But the left side is an integer, the right side is7^{c -a}*(...), which must also be integer. Unless c=a, which would imply a=c.Therefore, a=c. Hence, we have a=c. Then, from a +b =c +d ⇒b=d. Therefore, the pairs are the same. Therefore, there are no two distinct pairs with the same sum and product. Hence, each quadratic is unique.Therefore, the total number is indeed 2969.But 2969 is the final answer? Let me check once again.Yes, because:- For m=0, we have 107 pairs.- For m=1 to53, the sum is 2862.- 107 +2862=2969.Thus, the number of distinct quadratics is boxed{2969}.Final Answerboxed{2969}&lt;/think&gt;To find the number of distinct quadratic trinomials with integer coefficients that have two distinct roots which are powers of 7 and coefficients in absolute value not exceeding (343^{36}), we start by noting that the quadratic trinomials must be of the form (x^2 + bx + c) where (b = -(7^m + 7^n)) and (c = 7^{m + n}) for non-negative integers (m) and (n) with (m neq n). The coefficients must satisfy (|b| leq 7^{108}) and (|c| leq 7^{108}), which translates to:1. (7^m + 7^n leq 7^{108})2. (m + n leq 108)We need to count pairs ((m, n)) where (m &lt; n) and both conditions are satisfied. For (m = 0), (n) can range from 1 to 107 (since (1 + 7^n leq 7^{108}) requires (n leq 107)), giving 107 pairs.For (m geq 1), we consider (n = m + k) where (k geq 1). The conditions become:- (2m + k leq 108)- (7^m(1 + 7^k) leq 7^{108})This simplifies to (k leq 108 - 2m) for (m) from 1 to 53 (since (108 - 2m geq 1) implies (m leq 53.5)). The number of valid (k) values for each (m) from 1 to 53 is (108 - 2m), leading to an arithmetic series sum:[sum_{m=1}^{53} (108 - 2m) = 2862]Adding the pairs for (m = 0) and (m geq 1) gives the total number of distinct quadratic trinomials:[107 + 2862 = 2969]Thus, the number of distinct quadratic trinomials is (boxed{2969}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the number of distinct quadratic trinomials with integer coefficients where the leading coefficient is 1. These quadratics must have two distinct roots, each of which is a power of 7 with non-negative integer exponents. Also, the absolute values of the coefficients (which would be the sum and product of the roots) must not exceed 343^36. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s recall that a quadratic trinomial with leading coefficient 1 can be written as (x - a)(x - b) = x² - (a + b)x + ab, where a and b are the roots. Since the problem states they must have two distinct roots, a and b must be different. Also, both a and b must be powers of 7. Let me denote them as 7^m and 7^n, where m and n are non-negative integers and m ≠ n.So, the quadratic would be x² - (7^m + 7^n)x + 7^{m + n}. Now, the coefficients here are -(7^m + 7^n) for the linear term and 7^{m + n} for the constant term. The problem states that the absolute values of these coefficients must not exceed 343^36.First, let&#39;s figure out what 343^36 is in terms of powers of 7. Since 343 is 7^3 (since 7*7=49, 49*7=343), so 343^36 = (7^3)^36 = 7^{108}. Therefore, both |-(7^m + 7^n)| and |7^{m + n}| must be ≤ 7^{108}. Since 7^{m + n} is positive and 7^m + 7^n is also positive, we can ignore the absolute value signs. Therefore, we need:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}2. 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}Which simplifies to:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}2. m + n ≤ 108But since 7^{m} and 7^{n} are both positive, their sum would be greater than either term, so if m + n ≤ 108, then 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108} as required. However, we also need to ensure that 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}. Let me check if m + n ≤ 108 automatically ensures that 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}.Suppose m and n are such that m + n ≤ 108. Let&#39;s assume without loss of generality that m ≤ n. Then m ≤ n, so m ≤ 54, n ≤ 108 - m. But 7^m + 7^n = 7^m(1 + 7^{n - m}). Let&#39;s see. For example, if m = 0 and n = 108, then 7^0 + 7^{108} = 1 + 7^{108} which is definitely less than 7^{108} + 7^{108} = 2*7^{108} but that&#39;s still larger than 7^{108}. Wait, so that sum would exceed 7^{108}. Wait, so actually, the sum 7^m + 7^n can exceed 7^{108} even if m + n ≤ 108. Therefore, the second condition is not sufficient. So we have two separate conditions here. So we need both:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}2. m + n ≤ 108But the second condition is implied by the first? Wait, if 7^{m} + 7^{n} ≤ 7^{108}, then is it necessary that m + n ≤ 108? Let&#39;s check. Suppose m and n are such that m + n &gt; 108. Let&#39;s say m = 100 and n = 100, so m + n = 200. Then 7^{100} + 7^{100} = 2*7^{100}, which is way less than 7^{108} (since 7^{100} is much smaller than 7^{108}). Wait, but m + n = 200, which is greater than 108. So in this case, even though m + n &gt; 108, the sum 7^m + 7^n is still less than 7^{108}. Therefore, the condition m + n ≤ 108 is not necessary. So, actually, the two conditions are separate. Therefore, to satisfy both 7^{m} + 7^{n} ≤ 7^{108} and 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}, we need both inequalities to hold.But wait, let&#39;s check: if m and n are such that m + n ≤ 108, then 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}, which is okay, but 7^{m} + 7^{n} could be greater than 7^{108}. For example, if m = 108 and n = 0, then 7^{108} + 7^0 = 7^{108} + 1, which is greater than 7^{108}, so it violates the first condition. Therefore, in order to satisfy both, we need both:1. 7^{m} + 7^{n} ≤ 7^{108}2. m + n ≤ 108But we have to consider both conditions. So, not all pairs (m, n) with m + n ≤ 108 will satisfy 7^{m} + 7^{n} ≤ 7^{108}, and vice versa. Therefore, we need to consider both constraints.So the problem reduces to finding all pairs (m, n) with m ≠ n (since the roots are distinct), m, n non-negative integers, such that:1. 7^{m} + 7^{n} ≤ 7^{108}2. m + n ≤ 1083. And then count the number of distinct quadratics, i.e., considering that (m, n) and (n, m) give the same quadratic because the sum and product are symmetric. Therefore, we need to count unordered pairs {m, n}.But wait, the quadratic is determined by the sum and product of the roots, so if m and n are swapped, the quadratic remains the same. Therefore, each quadratic corresponds to an unordered pair {m, n}, so we need to count the number of such unordered pairs where m ≠ n, 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}, and m + n ≤ 108. Wait, but maybe these constraints overlap. Let me see.But first, let&#39;s think about how to approach this. Since 7^m and 7^n are powers of 7, maybe we can express them in terms of exponents. Let&#39;s assume without loss of generality that m ≤ n. Then we can consider all ordered pairs with m ≤ n, count them, and then that would be the number of unordered pairs.So, we can set m ≤ n, m ≠ n, and then 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} and m + n ≤ 108. So, let&#39;s split the problem into two parts: pairs (m, n) where m ≤ n, and count how many such pairs satisfy both inequalities.But perhaps we can find the relation between these two inequalities. Let&#39;s see.If m ≤ n, then 7^m + 7^n = 7^m(1 + 7^{n - m}) ≤ 7^{108}. Let me denote k = n - m, so k ≥ 0. Then the inequality becomes 7^m(1 + 7^k) ≤ 7^{108}. Since 7^m divides the left-hand side, 7^m must divide the right-hand side, which is 7^{108}, so m ≤ 108. But m is already part of the problem, so maybe we can write:7^m(1 + 7^k) ≤ 7^{108}=&gt; 1 + 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m}Now, since 1 + 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m}, and 1 + 7^k is an integer, so 7^{108 - m} must be at least 1 + 7^k. Let&#39;s note that 1 + 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m}We can take log base 7 of both sides:log_7(1 + 7^k) ≤ 108 - mBut log_7(1 + 7^k) is less than k + 1 because 1 + 7^k &lt; 7^{k + 1} for k ≥ 1. For k = 0, 1 + 7^0 = 2 &lt; 7^1 = 7. So, in general, log_7(1 + 7^k) &lt; k + 1.Therefore, log_7(1 + 7^k) ≤ 108 - m &lt; k + 1 + (something). Hmm, maybe this is not the right approach.Alternatively, since 1 + 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m}, and 7^{108 - m} must be at least 1 + 7^k. Let&#39;s note that 7^{108 - m} ≥ 1 + 7^k.But 7^{108 - m} ≥ 7^k + 1. So, 7^{108 - m} &gt; 7^k. Therefore, 108 - m &gt; k, since 7^{a} &gt; 7^{b} iff a &gt; b.So, 108 - m &gt; k =&gt; 108 - m &gt; n - m =&gt; 108 &gt; n. So n &lt; 108. But n can be up to 108, since if n = 108, then m could be 0. Wait, but if n = 108, then m must satisfy 7^m + 7^{108} ≤ 7^{108}. That would require 7^m ≤ 0, which is impossible unless m is negative, which it&#39;s not. Wait, so if n = 108, then 7^m + 7^{108} ≤ 7^{108} implies 7^m ≤ 0, which is impossible, so n must be less than 108. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion.Wait, if we have 7^{108 - m} ≥ 1 + 7^k, then if k is n - m, so 108 - m &gt; k = n - m =&gt; 108 &gt; n. So n must be less than 108. Therefore, maximum possible n is 107. Therefore, n ≤ 107.Similarly, m can be from 0 up to some maximum. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, maybe we can bound m and n.Since m ≤ n, and n ≤ 107 (from above), and m + n ≤ 108, so m ≤ 108 - n. But since m ≤ n, m can be at most min(n, 108 - n). So for each n, m can range from 0 to min(n - 1, 108 - n). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider two separate cases:Case 1: m + n ≤ 108 and 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}Case 2: m + n &gt; 108 but 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}But we need to satisfy both inequalities. Wait, no, actually, the problem requires both coefficients (sum and product) to be ≤ 7^{108}. Therefore, the pair (m, n) must satisfy both 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} and 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108} (i.e., m + n ≤ 108). So both conditions must hold. So we need to find all pairs (m, n) with m ≠ n, m, n ≥ 0 integers, such that:1. m + n ≤ 1082. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}But how do these two conditions interact?Suppose m + n ≤ 108. Then 7^{m + n} ≤ 7^{108}, so the product is okay. But the sum 7^m + 7^n could still exceed 7^{108}. For example, if m = 108 and n = 0, then m + n = 108, which is allowed, but 7^108 + 7^0 = 7^{108} + 1 &gt; 7^{108}, which violates the sum condition.Alternatively, if m and n are both 54, then m + n = 108, but since m = n, the roots are not distinct, so that&#39;s invalid. But if m = 53 and n = 55, then m + n = 108, and 7^{53} + 7^{55} = 7^{53}(1 + 7^2) = 7^{53}*50, which is 50*7^{53} which is much less than 7^{108}, since 50 is much less than 7^{55}. Wait, but 7^{53}*50 is 50*7^{53}, which is 50/7^{55} times 7^{108}? Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:Wait, 7^{108} is a huge number. If m + n = 108, then 7^{m} + 7^{n} = 7^{m} + 7^{108 - m}. Let&#39;s set m = t, so n = 108 - t. Then 7^{t} + 7^{108 - t} ≤ 7^{108}. Let&#39;s analyze this function f(t) = 7^{t} + 7^{108 - t}.We can note that when t = 0, f(0) = 1 + 7^{108} which is greater than 7^{108}, so invalid. When t = 1, f(1) = 7 + 7^{107} which is also greater than 7^{108}, since 7^{107} = 7^{108}/7, so 7^{107} + 7 = 7^{107} + 7 ≈ 7^{107} * 1.000000... something, still less than 7^{108}? Wait, no. 7^{107} is 1/7 of 7^{108}, so 7^{107} + 7 is (7^{108} + 49)/7, which is less than 7^{108}/7 + 49/7 = 7^{107} + 7. Wait, I&#39;m getting confused.Wait, 7^{108} is 7 times 7^{107}, so 7^{107} + 7 is much less than 7^{108}. Wait, 7^{107} + 7 is like 7^{107} + 7^1. Since 7^{107} is way larger than 7^1, so 7^{107} + 7 ≈ 7^{107}, which is much less than 7^{108}. Therefore, for t = 1, f(1) = 7 + 7^{107} ≈ 7^{107} &lt; 7^{108}. So it&#39;s valid. Similarly, when t = 54, f(54) = 7^{54} + 7^{54} = 2*7^{54}, which is definitely less than 7^{108}. So, in fact, for t from 1 to 107, when m + n = 108, the sum 7^t + 7^{108 - t} is less than 7^{108}.Wait, but when t = 0, it&#39;s 1 + 7^{108} which is more than 7^{108}, which is invalid. But for t ≥ 1, 7^t + 7^{108 - t} = 7^t (1 + 7^{108 - 2t}). Wait, let&#39;s see for t ≥ 1:If t ≤ 108 - t, then 108 - 2t ≥ 0. Let&#39;s consider t ≤ 54. Then 7^{108 - t} is the larger term. So for t from 1 to 54, 7^{108 - t} is the dominant term. For t from 54 to 108, but since m ≤ n, we only need t up to 54.Wait, perhaps my confusion arises here. Let&#39;s take specific examples.Take t = 1: 7 + 7^{107} = 7^{107} + 7. Since 7^{107} is 7^107, which is massive, so this sum is approximately 7^{107}, which is less than 7^{108}. Similarly, t = 2: 7^2 + 7^{106} ≈ 7^{106}, still less than 7^{108}. This continues until t = 54: 7^{54} + 7^{54} = 2*7^{54}, which is 2*7^{54}, and 7^{54} is 7^{54}, which is way less than 7^{108}.Wait, so actually, for all t from 1 to 107, when m + n = 108, the sum 7^t + 7^{108 - t} is less than 7^{108}. Except when t = 0, which gives 1 + 7^{108}, which is over.Therefore, if m + n = 108, then except when t = 0 or t = 108 (but t = 108 would give m = 108, n = 0, which is same as t = 0), the sum 7^m + 7^n is less than 7^{108}.Wait, but if m + n = 108, then m and n can range from 0 to 108, but m ≠ n. However, when m = 0, n = 108, the sum is 1 + 7^{108} which is too big, so such pairs are invalid. Similarly, m = 108, n = 0 is same. So in this case, the pairs where m + n = 108 are valid except when one of them is 0.Therefore, perhaps the constraints are:For all pairs (m, n) with m ≠ n, m, n ≥ 0, and m + n ≤ 108, except when m + n = 108 and one of m or n is 0, then the sum 7^m + 7^n is less than or equal to 7^{108}.Wait, but even when m + n = 108, unless m or n is 0, the sum is okay. Wait, let&#39;s check m = 1 and n = 107. Then sum is 7 + 7^{107} ≈ 7^{107} &lt; 7^{108}. Similarly, m = 2, n = 106: 7^2 + 7^{106} ≈ 7^{106} &lt; 7^{108}. So actually, except when m or n is 0, the pairs with m + n ≤ 108 satisfy both conditions.But if m + n ≤ 108 and neither m nor n is 0, then 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{m + n} (since 7^m + 7^n ≤ 2*7^{max(m, n)} ≤ 7^{max(m, n) + 1} ), but I&#39;m not sure. Wait, 7^m + 7^n ≤ 2*7^{max(m, n)}. If max(m, n) + 1 ≤ 108, then 2*7^{max(m, n)} ≤ 7^{max(m, n) + 1} ≤ 7^{108}? For example, if max(m, n) = 107, then 2*7^{107} ≤ 7^{108} because 2*7^{107} = (2/7)*7^{108} ≈ 0.2857*7^{108} &lt; 7^{108}. So yes, if max(m, n) ≤ 107, then 7^m + 7^n ≤ 2*7^{107} &lt; 7^{108}. But if max(m, n) = 108, then we need to check. Wait, but if m + n ≤ 108, then max(m, n) ≤ 108 - min(m, n). Wait, this is getting convoluted.Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to consider all pairs (m, n) with m ≠ n, m, n ≥ 0, such that m + n ≤ 108 and 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}. But how?Alternatively, notice that 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} can be rewritten as 7^{min(m, n)}(1 + 7^{|m - n|}) ≤ 7^{108}. Let&#39;s suppose m ≤ n. Then min(m, n) = m, and |m - n| = n - m. So the inequality becomes 7^m (1 + 7^{n - m}) ≤ 7^{108}. Divide both sides by 7^m: 1 + 7^{n - m} ≤ 7^{108 - m}.Let k = n - m, so k ≥ 1 (since m &lt; n). Then the inequality becomes 1 + 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m}.We can rearrange this as 7^{108 - m} - 7^k ≥ 1.We need to find integers m ≥ 0, k ≥ 1 such that 7^{108 - m} - 7^k ≥ 1.But 7^{108 - m} must be greater than 7^k. So, 108 - m &gt; k, which implies m + k &lt; 108. But since k = n - m, and n = m + k, so n = m + k, so m + n = 2m + k ≤ 108. Wait, but we already have n = m + k, so m + n = 2m + k. Since m ≥ 0, k ≥ 1, then 2m + k can be as large as ... Well, but from the previous inequality, 108 - m &gt; k, so k &lt; 108 - m. Therefore, substituting into m + n = 2m + k &lt; 2m + (108 - m) = m + 108. So m + n &lt; m + 108. But m + n is supposed to be ≤ 108? Wait, no, this is not necessarily. Wait, this seems conflicting.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of m and k such that 1 + 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m}. Let&#39;s take log base 7 of both sides:log_7(1 + 7^k) ≤ 108 - mBut log_7(1 + 7^k) &lt; log_7(2*7^k) = log_7(2) + k &lt; 1 + k. Therefore:1 + k &gt; log_7(1 + 7^k) ≤ 108 - mTherefore:1 + k &gt; 108 - m=&gt; m &gt; 107 - kBut since k ≥ 1, m &gt; 107 - k. But m must be a non-negative integer, so m ≥ max(0, 108 - k). Hmm, not sure if this helps.Alternatively, maybe we can bound k. Let&#39;s note that 1 + 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m} =&gt; 7^k ≤ 7^{108 - m} - 1 &lt; 7^{108 - m}Therefore, k &lt; 108 - mSo k ≤ 108 - m - 1Therefore, since k = n - m, then n = m + k ≤ m + (108 - m -1 ) = 107Therefore, n ≤ 107Thus, if we fix m, then k can be from 1 to 108 - m -1, which gives n = m + k ≤ m + (108 - m -1 ) = 107.Therefore, n is bounded by 107.So, combining this with the condition m + n ≤ 108:Since n = m + k, m + n = 2m + k ≤ 108. But since k ≤ 108 - m -1, then 2m + (108 - m -1) = m + 107 ≤ 108 =&gt; m ≤ 1.Wait, that seems contradictory. Let&#39;s check.If k ≤ 108 - m -1, then substituting into m + n = 2m + k:2m + k ≤ 2m + (108 - m -1) = m + 107 ≤ 108 =&gt; m ≤ 1.Therefore, m ≤ 1.Wait, so this suggests that m can only be 0 or 1?But this seems incorrect. Let me verify with an example.Suppose m = 2. Then according to the previous conclusion, k ≤ 108 - 2 -1 = 105. Therefore, n = 2 + k ≤ 2 + 105 = 107. Then m + n = 2 + 107 = 109, which is greater than 108. Therefore, even though n ≤ 107, m + n could exceed 108. But we need m + n ≤ 108. So if m = 2, then n must be ≤ 108 - 2 = 106. But according to the previous inequality, k ≤ 108 - m -1 = 105, so n = m + k ≤ 2 + 105 = 107. But 107 &gt; 106. Therefore, there&#39;s a conflict. Therefore, my previous conclusion is invalid.Therefore, I must have made a mistake.Wait, the initial problem is that we need two conditions:1. 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108}2. m + n ≤ 108But these two conditions are independent. So, even if we satisfy the first condition, we still need to check the second.So, perhaps we need to find all pairs (m, n) where m &lt; n (since m ≠ n and we can assume m &lt; n without loss of generality), such that both 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} and m + n ≤ 108.Therefore, for each m from 0 upwards, we can find the maximum n such that both 7^m + 7^n ≤ 7^{108} and n ≤ 108 - m.So for each m, the maximum n is the minimum of:1. The largest n such that 7^n ≤ 7^{108} - 7^m2. 108 - mBut since 7^{108} - 7^m is still a huge number, the first condition would allow n up to 108, but since m + n ≤ 108, n can only go up to 108 - m.Therefore, for each m, the maximum n is 108 - m, but we need to check if 7^m + 7^{108 - m} ≤ 7^{108}. Wait, but as we saw before, when m ≥ 1, 7^m + 7^{108 - m} ≈ 7^{108 - m} which is much less than 7^{108}. Except when m = 0, 7^0 + 7^{108} = 1 + 7^{108} &gt; 7^{108}, which is invalid. Therefore, for m = 0, the maximum n allowed by the sum condition is n such that 7^n ≤ 7^{108} - 1. Which is n ≤ 108, but since m + n ≤ 108, n ≤ 108. But 7^n ≤ 7^{108} -1 implies n ≤ 108, which is already satisfied. But since 7^108 -1 is less than 7^{108}, so the maximum n for m = 0 is 108, but 7^0 + 7^{108} = 1 + 7^{108} &gt; 7^{108}, so n cannot be 108. Therefore, for m = 0, the maximum n is 107, because 7^0 + 7^{107} = 1 + 7^{107} &lt; 7^{108} (since 7^{107} *7 = 7^{108}, so 1 + 7^{107} = (7^{108} + 7)/7 ≈ 7^{107} + 1). Wait, 1 + 7^{107} is indeed less than 7^{108}.Yes, because 7^{107} * 7 = 7^{108}, so 7^{107} is 1/7 of 7^{108}. Therefore, 7^{107} +1 is approximately (1/7)*7^{108} + 1 = 7^{107} +1, which is way less than 7^{108}.Therefore, for m = 0, the maximum n allowed by the sum condition is 107, and by the m + n ≤ 108 condition, n ≤ 108. So the maximum n is 107. Therefore, for m = 0, n can range from 1 to 107 (since m ≠ n).Similarly, for m ≥ 1, the maximum n is 108 - m, and since m ≥1, n ≤ 107. Let&#39;s check if 7^m + 7^{108 - m} ≤ 7^{108}.For m ≥ 1:7^m + 7^{108 - m} = 7^{108 - m} + 7^m. Let&#39;s factor out 7^m:7^m (1 + 7^{108 - 2m})But since m ≥1 and 108 - m ≥ n ≥ m +1 (since n &gt; m), but maybe not. Wait, n = 108 - m, so let&#39;s see:If m ≥1, then 108 - m ≤ 107. Then 7^{108 - m} + 7^m. Since 108 - m ≥ m only if 108 - m ≥ m =&gt; 108 ≥ 2m =&gt; m ≤ 54. So for m ≤ 54, 108 - m ≥ m, so 7^{108 - m} is the larger term, and 7^m is the smaller term. So 7^{108 - m} + 7^m = 7^{108 - m}(1 + 7^{2m - 108}). Wait, that exponent could be negative. Wait, if m ≤ 54, then 2m - 108 ≤ -0, so 7^{2m - 108} = 1/7^{108 - 2m}. Therefore, 1 + 7^{2m - 108} = 1 + 1/7^{108 - 2m} which is 1 + a very small number. Therefore, approximately 1. So 7^{108 - m} + 7^m ≈ 7^{108 - m} which is less than 7^{108}.For m &gt;54, say m =55, then 108 - m =53, so 7^{53} + 7^{55} =7^{53}(1 +7^2)=7^{53}*50=50*7^{53}, which is less than 7^{56} (since 50 &lt; 7^3=343). So 50*7^{53} &lt; 343*7^{53}=7^{56}, which is much less than 7^{108}. Therefore, for m &gt;54, 7^m +7^{108 -m} is still much less than 7^{108}.Therefore, for all m ≥1, 7^m +7^{108 -m} ≤7^{108}. Therefore, for m ≥1, the maximum n is 108 - m, and this satisfies the sum condition. So for each m from 1 to 53 (since m &lt; n and m + n ≤108), wait no, m can go up to floor(108/2). Wait, m can be from 0 up to 53, since for m=54, n=54 would be m +n=108, but m=n is not allowed. So for m &lt;n, m can be from0 to53, and n from m+1 to108 -m.But for m=0, n can be from1 to107. For m=1, n can be from2 to107. Wait, no: if m=1, then n can be from2 to108 -1=107. But actually, n has to be ≤108 -m=107. But also, n has to be greater than m=1. So n ranges from2 to107. But 108 -m=107, so yes. Similarly, for m=54, n can be from55 to108 -54=54. But 55 to54 is impossible. Therefore, m=54 cannot have any n. Wait, so m can only go up to floor((108 -1)/2)=53, since for m=53, n=55 (since n=108 -53=55), and m=53 &lt;n=55.Wait, let&#39;s check for m=53:n=108 -53=55, so m=53, n=55. Then m +n=108. So for m=53, n=55 is allowed. Similarly, m=54: n=108 -54=54, but n must be greater than m, which is not possible. Therefore, m can go up to53.Therefore, the possible values of m are from0 to53, and for each m, n ranges fromm+1 to108 -m. However, for m=0, n ranges from1 to107. For m=1, n ranges from2 to107. For m=53, n ranges from54 to55. Wait, m=53, 108 -m=55. So n=54,55. But n must be greater than m=53, so n=54 and55.So total number of pairs is for each m from0 to53, the number of n&#39;s is (108 -m) - (m +1) +1=108 -m -m -1 +1=108 -2m.Wait, wait. Let&#39;s take m=0: n ranges from1 to107, which is107 numbers. 108 -2*0=108, but we have107. Hmm, discrepancy. Maybe my formula is wrong.Wait, for m=0, n must be from1 to107 (since n ≠0 and m +n ≤108), so107 values.For m=1, n ranges from2 to107 (since n&gt;1 and m +n ≤108 =&gt;n ≤107), which is106 values.For m=2, n ranges from3 to106, which is104 values.Wait, no, wait: for m=2, n must be &gt;2 and ≤108 -2=106, so n=3 to106: 106 -2=104? Wait, 106 -3 +1=104. Yes.Similarly, for m=k, n ranges fromk +1 to108 -k, so number of terms is (108 -k) - (k +1) +1=108 -k -k -1 +1=108 -2k.Wait, so for m=0, 108 -2*0=108, but actual number is107. So formula is not matching. Hence, there must be an adjustment.Wait, perhaps when m=0, n cannot be108, but n can go up to107. So the formula is (108 -m -1) - (m +1) +1=108 -m -1 -m -1 +1=108 -2m -1. So for m=0:108 -0 -1=107, which matches. For m=1:108 -2*1 -1=105, but actual number is106-1=105. Wait, when m=1, n ranges from2 to107, which is106 terms. Wait, 107 -2 +1=106. Hmm, but according to the formula 108 -2m -1=108 -2 -1=105. So discrepancy.Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.Alternatively, for m=0, n can be1 to107:107 numbers.For m=1, n can be2 to107:106 numbers.For m=2, n can be3 to106:104 numbers.Wait, 108 -m - (m +1) +1=108 -m -m -1 +1=108 -2m.Wait, but when m=0:108 -2*0=108, but actual is107.Similarly, m=1:108 -2*1=106, but actual is106. Wait, yes, m=1, n from2 to107:107 -2 +1=106.Wait, no:Wait, for m=1:n starts at m +1=2 and ends at108 -m=107. So the number of n&#39;s is107 -2 +1=106. Which is108 -2m=108 -2=106. So yes, the formula is correct. For m=0:n starts at1 and ends at107. So107 -1 +1=107. But according to the formula,108 -2m=108 -0=108, which is incorrect. So the formula works only for m ≥1.Therefore, for m ≥1, the number of n&#39;s is108 -2m. For m=0, it&#39;s107.Therefore, the total number of pairs is107 (for m=0) plus the sum from m=1 to53 of (108 -2m).Now, compute this sum.First, compute the sum from m=1 to53 of (108 -2m).This is equivalent to sum_{m=1}^{53} 108 - 2m = 108*53 - 2*sum_{m=1}^{53} m.Compute 108*53: 100*53=5300, 8*53=424, total=5300+424=5724.Sum_{m=1}^{53} m = (53*54)/2= (2862)/2=1431.Therefore, total sum=5724 - 2*1431=5724 -2862=2862.Therefore, total pairs=107 +2862=2969.But wait, this counts all pairs (m, n) with m &lt;n, m +n ≤108, and m ≥0, n ≥1. However, we have to check whether these pairs also satisfy the condition 7^m +7^n ≤7^{108}. But as we discussed earlier, for m ≥1, since n ≤108 -m, 7^m +7^n ≤7^{108 -m} +7^m. For m ≥1, as we saw, 7^{108 -m} +7^m ≤7^{108}. For m=0, n ≤107, so7^0 +7^n =1 +7^n ≤7^{108} since n ≤107 &lt;108.Therefore, all these pairs satisfy the sum condition. Therefore, the total number of such quadratics is2969.But wait, let me check for m=53:n=55. So 7^{53} +7^{55}=7^{53}(1 +7^2)=7^{53}*50. 7^{53}*50=50*7^{53}, which is definitely less than7^{54} since50 &lt;7^3=343. So yes, 50*7^{53} &lt;343*7^{53}=7^{56}, which is less than7^{108}. So yes, all these pairs satisfy the sum condition.Therefore, the total number of distinct quadratics is2969. But let me verify my calculations again.Sum from m=1 to53 of (108 -2m):= sum_{m=1}^{53} 108 - sum_{m=1}^{53} 2m= 108*53 - 2*(sum_{m=1}^{53} m)= 108*53 -2*(53*54)/2= 108*53 -53*54=53*(108 -54)=53*54=2862Then adding m=0 case:107Total:2862 +107=2969.Yes.Therefore, the answer is2969.But wait, the problem states &quot;powers of the number 7 with integer non-negative exponents&quot;. So roots are7^m and7^n wherem andn are non-negative integers. Also, quadratics must be distinct. Since we considered unordered pairs {m, n}, each corresponding to a unique quadratic (because the sum and product are symmetric in m andn), then this count of2969 should be correct.But wait, let me check for small values to see if the formula works.Suppose instead of 343^{36}=7^{108}, suppose we have a smaller exponent, say 7^2=49. So coefficients must not exceed49.Then the problem would be: find the number of quadratics x² - (7^m +7^n)x +7^{m +n} with m ≠n, and7^m +7^n ≤49,7^{m +n} ≤49.Let&#39;s compute this manually.Possible roots are7^0=1,7^1=7,7^2=49. But7^3=343&gt;49, so exponents m,n can be0,1,2.Possible pairs (m,n) with m &lt;n:(0,1): sum=1+7=8, product=7. Both ≤49? Yes.(0,2): sum=1+49=50&gt;49. Invalid.(1,2): sum=7+49=56&gt;49. Invalid.So only one valid quadratic: (0,1). So answer1.Using the formula above:For m=0, n can be1 to floor((log_7(49)) -something). Wait, in our formula, if the max exponent is2 (since7^2=49), then the equivalent of108 would be2*36=72? Wait, no. Wait, in the original problem,343^{36}=7^{108}, so if in the smaller case, the limit is49=7^2, then the equivalent would be m +n ≤2 and7^m +7^n ≤7^2.But following our formula:Total pairs= for m=0, n can be1 to (2 -0 -1)=1, since7^0 +7^1=8&lt;=49, but m +n=1 &lt;=2. So n=1. Then for m=1, n can be2 but m +n=3&gt;2, so no. So total pairs1, which matches. So the formula seems to work.Similarly, another test case: limit7^3=343.Roots can be7^0,7^1,7^2,7^3.Possible pairs:(0,1): sum=8&lt;=343, product=7&lt;=343. Valid.(0,2): sum=1+49=50&lt;=343, product=49&lt;=343. Valid.(0,3): sum=1+343=344&gt;343. Invalid.(1,2): sum=7+49=56&lt;=343, product=343&lt;=343. Valid.(1,3): sum=7+343=350&gt;343. Invalid.(2,3): sum=49+343=392&gt;343. Invalid.So valid pairs are(0,1),(0,2),(1,2). Total3.Using our formula:Total=formula for max exponent3.But in our original problem,343^{36}=7^{108}, so analogously, if the limit were7^3, then equivalent to108=3*36=108? Wait, maybe not. Wait, our formula is for when the limit is7^{108} and coefficients must be&lt;=7^{108}. So if in the smaller case, coefficients must be&lt;=7^3=343, then following our formula:For m=0, n can be1 to3-0-1=2 (sincen&lt;=3 -0 -1=2). Wait, but in our previous step-by-step, it was for m=0, n up to107, but in this case, m=0, n can be1,2 (since3 -0 -1=2). Then for m=1, n can be2 to3 -1=2. So m=1,n=2.So total pairs:m=0,n=1,2 (2 pairs)m=1,n=2 (1 pair)Total3, which matches manual count. So the formula works.Thus, in the original problem, our answer2969 is likely correct.But wait, let me check in the small case. When the limit is7^3=343, then according to our formula:Total pairs=107 (for m=0) + sum_{m=1}^{53}(108 -2m). Wait, no, in the small case, the equivalent of108 is3, so the formula would be:For m=0, n can be1 to3-0-1=2 (so2 pairs)For m=1, n can be2 to3 -1=2 (so1 pair)Total3, which matches.But in the original problem, since108 is a large exponent, our formula works.Therefore, the answer is2969. But let me check once more.Wait, in the original problem, for m from1 to53, the number of n&#39;s per m is108 -2m. For m=1, 108 -2=106. For m=53,108 -106=2. So the sequence is106,104,...,2. This is an arithmetic sequence starting at106, decreasing by2 each time, ending at2. The number of terms is53. The sum of such a sequence is(number of terms)*(first term +last term)/2=53*(106 +2)/2=53*108/2=53*54=2862. Then add107 for m=0, total2862 +107=2969. Yes.Therefore, the answer should be2969, which isboxed{2969}.Final Answerboxed{2969}&lt;/think&gt;To find the number of distinct quadratic trinomials with integer coefficients such that they have two distinct roots, which are powers of 7 with non-negative integer exponents, and their coefficients in absolute value do not exceed (343^{36}) (which is (7^{108})), we proceed as follows:1. Quadratic Trinomial Form: A quadratic trinomial with roots (7^m) and (7^n) (where (m neq n)) can be written as (x^2 - (7^m + 7^n)x + 7^{m + n}). The coefficients must satisfy (7^m + 7^n leq 7^{108}) and (7^{m + n} leq 7^{108}).2. Conditions:   - The product (7^{m + n} leq 7^{108}) implies (m + n leq 108).   - The sum (7^m + 7^n leq 7^{108}) must be checked for all valid pairs ((m, n)).3. Valid Pairs:   - For (m = 0), (n) can range from 1 to 107 (since (7^0 + 7^{107} leq 7^{108})).   - For (m geq 1), the maximum (n) is (108 - m) (ensuring (m + n leq 108)), and this also satisfies (7^m + 7^n leq 7^{108}).4. Counting Pairs:   - For (m = 0), there are 107 valid values of (n).   - For (m geq 1), the number of valid (n) values is (108 - 2m). Summing this from (m = 1) to (m = 53) (since (m + n leq 108) and (m &lt; n)):     [     sum_{m=1}^{53} (108 - 2m) = 53 times 54 = 2862     ]5. Total Count:   - Adding the values for (m = 0) and (m geq 1):     [     107 + 2862 = 2969     ]Thus, the number of distinct quadratic trinomials is (boxed{2969}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🔑:</span>Answer: 2969.Solution.

What is the greatest value that the length of the segment cut off by the lateral sides of the triangle on the tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base, can take if the perimeter of the triangle is 2 p?</div><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the greatest value of the length of a segment cut off by the lateral sides of a triangle on a tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base. The perimeter of the triangle is given as 2p. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, the triangle in question is probably an isosceles triangle because the problem mentions &quot;the base&quot; and &quot;lateral sides,&quot; which suggests there&#39;s a single base and two equal lateral sides. But wait, it doesn&#39;t explicitly say the triangle is isosceles. Maybe I need to confirm if that&#39;s a necessary condition for maximizing the segment length. However, since the perimeter is fixed, maybe assuming it&#39;s isosceles simplifies things and might even give the maximum value. Let me keep that in mind.So, the inscribed circle (incircle) touches all three sides of the triangle. The tangent line we&#39;re considering is parallel to the base and tangent to the incircle. The segment we want to maximize is the part of this tangent line that&#39;s between the two lateral sides.Let me visualize this: imagine a triangle with base BC and two lateral sides AB and AC. The incircle touches BC at some point, and there&#39;s a tangent line parallel to BC that touches the incircle. The points where this tangent intersects AB and AC will form a segment whose length we need to maximize.Since the tangent is parallel to the base, the smaller segment must be part of a similar triangle. Because of the parallel lines, the two triangles (the original and the one formed by the tangent) are similar. The ratio of their sides should be related to the ratio of their distances from the inradius.Wait, maybe I can use the properties of similar triangles here. If the original triangle has base length &#39;b&#39; and the tangent segment is parallel to the base, then the length of the tangent segment would be proportional to the distance from the base to the tangent line. But since the tangent line is touching the incircle, the distance between the base and the tangent line should be twice the inradius? Hmm, not sure. Let&#39;s think again.The inradius &#39;r&#39; can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The perimeter here is 2p, so the semiperimeter s is p. Therefore, r = A/p. But maybe there&#39;s another way to relate the inradius to the dimensions of the triangle.In an isosceles triangle with base &#39;b&#39; and equal sides &#39;a&#39;, the perimeter is 2a + b = 2p. So, b = 2p - 2a. Then, the area A can be calculated using Heron&#39;s formula: A = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - a)(s - b)]. Plugging s = p, so A = sqrt[p(p - a)^2(p - (2p - 2a))]. Wait, simplifying the last term: p - (2p - 2a) = -p + 2a. But that would make the expression under the sqrt negative unless -p + 2a is positive. Which implies 2a &gt; p, so a &gt; p/2. But since the perimeter is 2p and b = 2p - 2a, then b must be positive, so 2p - 2a &gt; 0 ⇒ a &lt; p. Therefore, a is between p/2 and p. Interesting.But maybe there&#39;s a simpler formula for the area of an isosceles triangle. The area can also be expressed as (base * height)/2. The height h can be found using Pythagoras: h = sqrt(a^2 - (b/2)^2). So, A = (b/2) * sqrt(a^2 - (b/2)^2). Then, the inradius r = A / p = [ (b/2) * sqrt(a^2 - (b/2)^2) ] / p.But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me consider another approach. If the tangent line is parallel to the base and touches the incircle, then the distance from the base to the tangent line is 2r? Wait, the incircle is tangent to all three sides. If we draw a tangent line parallel to the base, the distance from the base to this tangent line would be twice the inradius because the inradius is the distance from the incenter to the base, and the tangent line is on the opposite side of the inradius. Hmm, not exactly. Let me clarify.The inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. So, the incenter is located at a distance r from each side. If we draw a tangent line parallel to the base, the distance between the base and this tangent line would be 2r, since the inradius is r, and the tangent line is on the other side of the incircle. Therefore, the height from the base to the tangent line is 2r. Wait, is that correct?Wait, suppose the incircle has radius r, centered at the incenter. The distance from the incenter to the base is r. If we draw a line tangent to the incircle parallel to the base, it would be on the opposite side of the incenter from the base. So, the distance from the base to this tangent line would be the distance from the base to the incenter (which is r) plus the distance from the incenter to the tangent line (which is another r), totaling 2r. Yes, that makes sense. So, the vertical distance (if we imagine the base at the bottom) between the base and the tangent line is 2r.But in the triangle, the total height H from the base to the opposite vertex is h = sqrt(a^2 - (b/2)^2). Therefore, if the distance from the base to the tangent line is 2r, then the remaining distance from the tangent line to the apex is H - 2r. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of similarity would be (H - 2r)/H, so the length of the tangent segment would be b * (H - 2r)/H.Wait, but we need to express this in terms of the perimeter. Let me try to write expressions in terms of a and b, given that 2a + b = 2p.So, let me define variables:Let the triangle be isosceles with sides AB = AC = a, and base BC = b. Perimeter 2a + b = 2p ⇒ b = 2p - 2a.Height h = sqrt(a^2 - (b/2)^2) = sqrt(a^2 - (p - a)^2) = sqrt[a^2 - (p^2 - 2ap + a^2)] = sqrt(2ap - p^2).Area A = (b/2)*h = ( (2p - 2a)/2 ) * sqrt(2ap - p^2) = (p - a) * sqrt(2ap - p^2).Inradius r = A / p = [ (p - a) * sqrt(2ap - p^2) ] / p.So, the distance from the base to the tangent line is 2r = 2 [ (p - a) * sqrt(2ap - p^2) ] / p.But the total height of the triangle is h = sqrt(2ap - p^2).Therefore, the remaining distance from the tangent line to the apex is h - 2r = sqrt(2ap - p^2) - 2 [ (p - a) * sqrt(2ap - p^2) ] / p.Factor out sqrt(2ap - p^2):= sqrt(2ap - p^2) [ 1 - 2(p - a)/p ] = sqrt(2ap - p^2) [ (p - 2(p - a)) / p ] = sqrt(2ap - p^2) [ (p - 2p + 2a)/p ] = sqrt(2ap - p^2) [ (-p + 2a)/p ].So, the ratio of similarity is (remaining height)/total height = [ (-p + 2a)/p ].Wait, but the ratio should be positive. Let me check:(-p + 2a)/p = (2a - p)/p. Since in the isosceles triangle, a must be greater than b/2, right? Because in a triangle, each side must be less than the sum of the other two. So, a + a &gt; b ⇒ 2a &gt; b. But b = 2p - 2a, so 2a &gt; 2p - 2a ⇒ 4a &gt; 2p ⇒ a &gt; p/2. So, 2a - p &gt; 0. Therefore, the ratio is positive. Good.Therefore, the length of the tangent segment is b * (2a - p)/p.But b = 2p - 2a, so substituting:Length L = (2p - 2a) * (2a - p)/p = [2(p - a)(2a - p)] / p.So, L = [2(p - a)(2a - p)] / p.We need to maximize L with respect to a, given that a is in (p/2, p). Because b = 2p - 2a must be positive, so 2p - 2a &gt; 0 ⇒ a &lt; p, and from earlier, a &gt; p/2.So, L(a) = [2(p - a)(2a - p)] / p.Let me write this function as L(a) = (2/p)(p - a)(2a - p).To maximize L(a), we can take the derivative with respect to a and set it to zero.First, expand the terms inside:(p - a)(2a - p) = 2a(p - a) - p(p - a) = 2ap - 2a^2 - p^2 + pa = (2ap + pa) - 2a^2 - p^2 = 3ap - 2a^2 - p^2.Wait, maybe it&#39;s easier to multiply it out:(p - a)(2a - p) = 2a(p) - p^2 - 2a^2 + a p = 2ap - p^2 - 2a^2 + ap = 3ap - 2a^2 - p^2.But perhaps it&#39;s easier to compute the derivative directly using the product rule.Let me compute dL/da:dL/da = (2/p)[ d/da (p - a)(2a - p) ].Using the product rule:d/da [(p - a)(2a - p)] = (d/da (p - a))*(2a - p) + (p - a)*(d/da (2a - p)) = (-1)(2a - p) + (p - a)(2) = -2a + p + 2p - 2a = (-2a - 2a) + (p + 2p) = -4a + 3p.Therefore, dL/da = (2/p)(-4a + 3p).Set derivative equal to zero:(2/p)(-4a + 3p) = 0 ⇒ -4a + 3p = 0 ⇒ 4a = 3p ⇒ a = (3p)/4.Now, check if this is within the interval (p/2, p):3p/4 is 0.75p, which is greater than p/2 (0.5p) and less than p, so it is valid.Therefore, the maximum occurs at a = 3p/4.Now, compute L at a = 3p/4:First, b = 2p - 2a = 2p - 2*(3p/4) = 2p - 3p/2 = p/2.So, the base is p/2, and the equal sides are 3p/4 each.Now, compute L(a) = [2(p - a)(2a - p)] / p.Substitute a = 3p/4:p - a = p - 3p/4 = p/42a - p = 2*(3p/4) - p = 3p/2 - p = p/2Therefore, L = [2*(p/4)*(p/2)] / p = [2*(p^2/8)] / p = [p^2/4] / p = p/4.Wait, so the maximum length is p/4? Let me check if that&#39;s correct.Wait, let&#39;s verify with another method. Since the triangle is isosceles with sides 3p/4, 3p/4, and base p/2. Let&#39;s compute the inradius r.First, the semiperimeter s = p (given perimeter is 2p). The area A = (base * height)/2.Compute height h: h = sqrt( (3p/4)^2 - (p/4)^2 ) = sqrt(9p²/16 - p²/16) = sqrt(8p²/16) = sqrt(p²/2) = p/√2.Therefore, area A = (p/2 * p/√2)/2 = (p²)/(4√2).Then, inradius r = A / s = (p²/(4√2)) / p = p/(4√2).Therefore, the distance from the base to the tangent line is 2r = p/(2√2).The total height h = p/√2, so the remaining height from the tangent line to the apex is h - 2r = p/√2 - p/(2√2) = p/(2√2).Therefore, the ratio of the heights is (p/(2√2)) / (p/√2) = 1/2. Therefore, the length of the tangent segment should be (base) * 1/2 = (p/2) * 1/2 = p/4. Which matches the previous result. So that checks out.Therefore, the maximum length is p/4. So, the greatest value is p/4. Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{p}{4}}.But wait, let me make sure that assuming the triangle is isosceles is valid here. The problem doesn&#39;t specify that the triangle is isosceles, so perhaps we need to confirm that the maximum occurs for an isosceles triangle.Suppose the triangle is not isosceles. Let me try to generalize.Let the triangle have sides of lengths a, b, c with perimeter 2p. Let the base be BC with length, say, c. The incircle is tangent to BC, AC, and AB. The tangent line parallel to BC will touch the incircle at some point, and the segment between where it intersects AB and AC is the length we need to maximize.In this case, regardless of the triangle&#39;s shape, the length of the tangent segment should be similar to the base scaled by the ratio of the heights, similar to the isosceles case. But perhaps in a general triangle, the maximum occurs when it&#39;s isosceles.Alternatively, perhaps using calculus of multiple variables, but since perimeter is fixed, we can express variables in terms of two sides and apply constraints, but that might be complex.Alternatively, using the isoperimetric inequality or other geometric inequalities. But since we found that in the isosceles case, the maximum is p/4, and intuitively, making the triangle more balanced might maximize such a length, perhaps that is indeed the maximum.Alternatively, consider that for any triangle, the length of the tangent segment parallel to the base can be expressed as base * (1 - 2r/h), where h is the height. To maximize this, we need to maximize (1 - 2r/h). Since r = A/s, and h = 2A/c (since area A = (c * h)/2). So, h = 2A/c. Therefore, 1 - 2r/h = 1 - 2*(A/s)/(2A/c) ) = 1 - (2A/s)*(c/(2A)) ) = 1 - c/s. Therefore, the length is c*(1 - c/s). Since s = p (semiperimeter is p), then the length would be c*(1 - c/p) = c - c²/p.Wait, hold on, but this seems different from the previous approach. Wait, let&#39;s verify:If the length is c*(1 - c/p), then to maximize this quadratic in c, which is c - c²/p. Taking derivative: 1 - 2c/p. Set to zero: c = p/2. Then maximum value is p/2 - (p/2)^2 / p = p/2 - p/4 = p/4. So, regardless of the triangle, if this formula holds, the maximum is p/4 when c = p/2.But wait, this seems to suggest that even for any triangle, the maximum length is p/4, achieved when the base is p/2. But in the isosceles case, when the base is p/2, the other sides are (2p - p/2)/2 = (3p/2)/2 = 3p/4, which is the case we considered earlier.Therefore, this formula suggests that regardless of the triangle&#39;s shape, the maximum possible value of the tangent segment length parallel to the base is p/4, achieved when the base is p/2. Therefore, even if the triangle is not isosceles, as long as the base is p/2, the maximum is achieved. However, in a general triangle, can the base be p/2?But the perimeter is 2p, so the sum of the other two sides would be 2p - c. If c = p/2, then the sum of the other two sides is 3p/2. However, in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, if the base is c = p/2, then the sum of the other two sides is 3p/2, which must be greater than c = p/2, which is true because 3p/2 &gt; p/2. Also, each of the other sides must be less than the sum of the other two. So, each of the other sides must be less than (3p/2). Since they sum to 3p/2, each is less than 3p/2. So, triangle inequality holds.Therefore, even in a general triangle, if we set the base to p/2, and the other sides sum to 3p/2, the maximum tangent segment length is p/4. However, is this valid? Wait, in the previous calculation, we derived that the length is c - c²/p, which is maximized at c = p/2. But this seems to be derived under the assumption that the triangle can have any base length c, but with perimeter 2p. However, in reality, the inradius and height depend on the specific triangle.Wait, let&#39;s check the general case. Let the triangle have base c, and perimeter 2p, so the other sides are a and b, with a + b + c = 2p. The area is given by Heron&#39;s formula: A = sqrt[p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c)]. The inradius r = A / p. The height h relative to the base c is h = 2A / c. The distance from the base to the tangent line is 2r, so the remaining height is h - 2r = (2A/c) - 2(A/p) = 2A(1/c - 1/p). The ratio of similarity is (h - 2r)/h = [2A(1/c - 1/p)] / (2A/c) = (1/c - 1/p)/(1/c) = 1 - c/p. Therefore, the length of the tangent segment is c * (1 - c/p), which is the same as before. So regardless of the triangle&#39;s shape, the length is c - c²/p. Then, this is a quadratic function of c, which is maximized at c = p/2, yielding maximum value p/4.But wait, this suggests that for any triangle with perimeter 2p, regardless of its shape, the maximum possible value of the tangent segment is p/4, achieved when the base is p/2. Therefore, even if the triangle is scalene, but with base p/2, then the tangent segment length is p/4. However, does such a scalene triangle exist?Wait, if the base is p/2, then the other two sides must sum to 3p/2. Let’s take an example where the triangle is scalene with sides p/2, 3p/4, and 3p/4. Wait, no, that&#39;s isosceles. Let&#39;s take sides p/2, p, and p/2. Wait, but that&#39;s not possible since p + p/2 + p/2 = 2p, but the sides p, p/2, p/2 would require that the sum of the two smaller sides (p/2 + p/2 = p) is greater than the largest side p. But p is not greater than p; it&#39;s equal. So that would be a degenerate triangle. Therefore, the other two sides can&#39;t be p and p/2. Therefore, in a scalene triangle with base p/2, the other two sides must satisfy a + b = 3p/2 and a + b &gt; p/2, which they do, but also each side must be less than the sum of the other two. So, a &lt; p/2 + b and b &lt; p/2 + a. Since a + b = 3p/2, then a &lt; p/2 + b ⇒ a &lt; p/2 + (3p/2 - a) ⇒ 2a &lt; 2p ⇒ a &lt; p. Similarly, b &lt; p. Since a and b are positive and sum to 3p/2, they must each be between p/2 and p. So, for example, take a = 5p/6 and b = 2p/3. Then, the sides would be p/2, 5p/6, and 2p/3. Check triangle inequalities:p/2 + 5p/6 = (3p/6 + 5p/6) = 8p/6 = 4p/3 &gt; 2p/3 ✔️p/2 + 2p/3 = (3p/6 + 4p/6) = 7p/6 &gt; 5p/6 ✔️5p/6 + 2p/3 = 5p/6 + 4p/6 = 9p/6 = 3p/2 &gt; p/2 ✔️So such a scalene triangle exists. Then, according to the previous formula, the tangent segment length would be p/4. Wait, but does that hold?Let me compute for this scalene triangle. Let&#39;s compute the inradius.First, sides: a = 5p/6, b = 2p/3, c = p/2. Perimeter 2p. Semiperimeter s = p.Area A = sqrt[p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c)] = sqrt[p(p - 5p/6)(p - 2p/3)(p - p/2)].Compute each term:p - 5p/6 = p/6p - 2p/3 = p/3p - p/2 = p/2Therefore, A = sqrt[p * (p/6) * (p/3) * (p/2)] = sqrt[p * p/6 * p/3 * p/2] = sqrt[p^4 / (6*3*2)] = sqrt[p^4 / 36] = p²/6.Therefore, inradius r = A / p = (p²/6)/p = p/6.The height h corresponding to base c = p/2 is h = 2A / c = 2*(p²/6)/(p/2) = (p²/3)/(p/2) = (p/3)*2 = 2p/3.The distance from the base to the tangent line is 2r = 2*(p/6) = p/3.Therefore, the remaining height from the tangent line to the apex is h - 2r = 2p/3 - p/3 = p/3.The ratio of similarity is (p/3)/(2p/3) = 1/2. Therefore, the length of the tangent segment is c * 1/2 = (p/2)*(1/2) = p/4. So even in this scalene triangle, the tangent segment length is p/4. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed p/4 regardless of the triangle being isosceles or scalene, as long as the base is p/2.Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{p}{4}}.Final AnswerThe greatest value is boxed{dfrac{p}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a triangle with a perimeter of (2p), we need to find the greatest value of the length of the segment cut off by the lateral sides of the triangle on a tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base.1. Assumptions and Setup:   - The triangle is isosceles with base (b) and equal sides (a).   - Perimeter: (2a + b = 2p), hence (b = 2p - 2a).2. Inradius Calculation:   - The semiperimeter (s = p).   - The area (A) of the triangle is calculated using the height (h = sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{b}{2}right)^2}).   - The inradius (r = frac{A}{p}).3. Height and Distance:   - The height (h = sqrt{2ap - p^2}).   - The distance from the base to the tangent line (parallel to the base) is (2r).4. Similar Triangles:   - The segment length parallel to the base is proportional to the remaining height from the tangent line to the apex.   - The ratio of similarity is (frac{2a - p}{p}).5. Maximizing the Segment Length:   - The length of the tangent segment (L) is given by (L = frac{2(p - a)(2a - p)}{p}).   - Maximizing (L) with respect to (a) using calculus leads to (a = frac{3p}{4}).6. Verification:   - Substituting (a = frac{3p}{4}) into the expression for (L) gives (L = frac{p}{4}).   - This result holds even for scalene triangles, confirming the maximum value is (frac{p}{4}).Thus, the greatest value of the length of the segment cut off by the lateral sides of the triangle on the tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base, is (boxed{dfrac{p}{4}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is asking for the greatest value of the length of a segment cut off by the lateral sides of a triangle on a tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base. The perimeter of the triangle is given as 2p. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a triangle with a perimeter of 2p. There&#39;s an inscribed circle (incircle) tangent to all three sides. We need to draw a tangent to this incircle that&#39;s parallel to the base of the triangle. Then, where this tangent intersects the lateral sides (the two sides that aren&#39;t the base) will form a segment. We need to find the maximum possible length of this segment.Alright, so maybe it&#39;s an isoceles triangle? Since the problem mentions &quot;the base,&quot; maybe we can assume it&#39;s isoceles? Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the type of triangle. Hmm. Maybe the maximum occurs when the triangle is isoceles? Often, symmetry can give extrema, so that&#39;s a common approach.Let me try to model this. Let&#39;s assume the triangle is isoceles with base length b and two equal sides of length a each. Then the perimeter is 2a + b = 2p, so b = 2p - 2a. The semiperimeter would be p.The inradius r can be calculated using the formula r = Area / semiperimeter. The area of the triangle can be found using Heron&#39;s formula. For an isoceles triangle, the area is also (base * height)/2. Maybe that&#39;s easier. Let&#39;s do that.First, the height h of the isoceles triangle can be found by Pythagoras: h = sqrt(a² - (b/2)²). Then area = (b * h)/2 = (b/2) * sqrt(a² - (b²/4)). Then the inradius r = Area / semiperimeter = [(b/2) * sqrt(a² - (b²/4))] / p.But maybe there&#39;s a better way. Alternatively, for any triangle, the inradius is r = (Area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter. So for this isoceles triangle, semiperimeter s = p. So area is (b/2)*sqrt(a² - (b/2)^2). Therefore, r = (b/2p)*sqrt(a² - (b²/4)).But maybe instead of parameterizing in terms of a, we can use b. Since perimeter is 2p, then a = (2p - b)/2. So substituting into r:r = (b/(2p)) * sqrt( [ (2p - b)/2 ]² - (b²)/4 )Let me compute that expression inside the square root:[ (2p - b)/2 ]² - (b²)/4 = [ (4p² - 4pb + b²)/4 ] - (b²)/4 = (4p² - 4pb + b² - b²)/4 = (4p² - 4pb)/4 = p² - pb.Therefore, r = (b/(2p)) * sqrt( p² - pb ) = (b/(2p)) * sqrt( p(p - b) )Hmm, so r = (b/(2p)) * sqrt( p(p - b) ) = (b/(2p)) * sqrt( p ) * sqrt( p - b ) ) = (b sqrt(p) sqrt(p - b)) / (2p )Simplifying, r = (b sqrt(p(p - b)) ) / (2p ) = (b sqrt(p(p - b)) ) / (2p )But maybe this isn&#39;t the most helpful expression. Let&#39;s think about the tangent line to the incircle that&#39;s parallel to the base.In an isoceles triangle, the incircle is tangent to the base at a point, and the center of the incircle lies along the altitude. If we draw a tangent line parallel to the base, it should be symmetric with respect to the altitude. So the segment cut off by the lateral sides on this tangent line would be some length, which we need to maximize.Let me denote the triangle as ABC, with base BC and AB = AC = a. The inradius is r, and the tangent line parallel to BC will touch the incircle at some point above the base. Let&#39;s denote the tangent line as DE, where D is on AB and E is on AC. Then DE is the segment whose length we need to find and maximize.Since DE is parallel to BC, triangles ADE and ABC are similar. The ratio of their sides would be equal to the ratio of their distances from the apex A.But since DE is a tangent to the incircle, the distance between DE and BC must be 2r? Wait, no. The incircle has radius r, so the distance from the center of the incircle to BC is r. If we draw another tangent above, parallel to BC, the distance between BC and DE would be 2r? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.In an isoceles triangle, the center of the incircle (inradius center) is located along the altitude from A to BC. The distance from the inradius center to BC is r. If we draw a tangent line DE parallel to BC above the incircle, then the distance from the center to DE is also r, because DE is tangent to the circle. Therefore, the distance between BC and DE is the distance from BC to the center (which is r) plus the distance from the center to DE (another r), so total distance is 2r.But the altitude h of the triangle is h = sqrt(a² - (b/2)^2). Alternatively, h can also be expressed in terms of the area. Since area = (b * h)/2 = r * p, so h = 2r * p / b.Wait, that might be a key relation here. Since the area is (b * h)/2 = r * p, so h = 2pr / b.But the altitude h is also equal to the distance from A to BC. The distance from DE to BC is 2r, so the distance from A to DE is h - 2r.Since triangles ADE and ABC are similar, the ratio of similarity k is equal to (h - 2r)/h = 1 - (2r)/h.Therefore, the length DE = k * BC = (1 - (2r)/h) * b.But we need to express DE in terms of p and maximize it.So DE = b * (1 - (2r)/h )But h = 2pr / b, as we saw earlier. Therefore, substituting h into DE:DE = b * (1 - (2r)/(2pr / b)) = b * (1 - (2r * b)/(2pr)) ) = b * (1 - b/(2p)) )Simplify:DE = b * ( (2p - b)/2p ) = (b(2p - b))/2pSo DE = (b(2p - b))/2pWait, that&#39;s interesting. So DE is expressed purely in terms of b, given that the perimeter is 2p. Since in an isoceles triangle, the perimeter is 2a + b = 2p, so a = (2p - b)/2. But here, DE is given by (b(2p - b))/2p. So DE is a quadratic function of b. To find its maximum, we can treat it as a quadratic function.Let me write DE = (b(2p - b))/2p = (2p b - b²)/2p = (2p b - b²)/2pSo DE = (2p b - b²)/2p = (2p - b) * b / 2pTo maximize DE with respect to b, we can take the derivative and set it to zero. But since it&#39;s a quadratic in b, opening downward (coefficient of b² is -1/(2p)), the maximum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, the quadratic in b is DE = (-b² + 2p b)/2p, so a = -1/(2p), coefficient of b², and coefficient of b is 2p/(2p) = 1.Wait, hold on:Wait, DE = (2p b - b²)/2p = ( -b² + 2p b ) / 2p = (-1/(2p))b² + bSo in standard form, f(b) = (-1/(2p))b² + bThus, the vertex (maximum) occurs at b = -B/(2A) where A = -1/(2p), B = 1.So b = -1/(2*(-1/(2p))) = -1 / (-1/p) = pWait, so b = p. Therefore, the maximum DE occurs when b = p.But perimeter is 2p, so if base is p, then each of the equal sides is (2p - p)/2 = p/2. So the triangle would have sides p/2, p/2, and p. Wait, but is that a valid triangle?The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So p/2 + p/2 = p, which must be greater than the third side p. But p is not greater than p; it&#39;s equal. So that would be a degenerate triangle, a straight line. So that can&#39;t be.Hmm, so there&#39;s a problem here. The maximum of DE occurs at b = p, but that gives a degenerate triangle, which is invalid. Therefore, the maximum must occur at the maximal possible b that still gives a valid triangle.In a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So in our isoceles triangle, the two equal sides are a = (2p - b)/2. So we must have a + a &gt; b =&gt; 2a &gt; b =&gt; 2*(2p - b)/2 &gt; b =&gt; (2p - b) &gt; b =&gt; 2p &gt; 2b =&gt; p &gt; b. Similarly, a + b &gt; a =&gt; b &gt; 0, which is trivial. So the base b must be less than p. So the maximum possible b approaches p, but is less than p. So the function DE = (b(2p - b))/2p, with domain 0 &lt; b &lt; p.But if we plug b approaching p, then DE approaches (p(2p - p))/2p = (p^2)/2p = p/2.Wait, but if we take the limit as b approaches p, DE approaches p/2. But when b approaches p, the triangle becomes very &quot;flat&quot;, almost degenerate. However, the actual maximum might be somewhere before that.Wait, but earlier, using calculus, the vertex of the quadratic is at b = p, which is outside the permissible domain. Therefore, since the quadratic is increasing from b = 0 to b = p, but our domain is only up to b &lt; p. Wait, wait, no. The quadratic f(b) = (-1/(2p))b² + b. The coefficient of b² is negative, so it&#39;s a downward opening parabola. The vertex is at b = p, which is the maximum point. But since our domain is 0 &lt; b &lt; p, the function is increasing from b=0 to b=p. Therefore, the maximum DE occurs as b approaches p, giving DE approaching p/2. However, since b cannot equal p (as it would degenerate), the supremum is p/2, but it&#39;s not achieved. However, in the context of optimization problems, sometimes we consider suprema even if they are not achieved. But the problem states &quot;the greatest value that the length... can take&quot;. So perhaps p/2 is the answer, even though it&#39;s not achieved by a non-degenerate triangle.But maybe I made a wrong assumption here. Wait, because when the triangle becomes degenerate, the inradius becomes zero. But in our formula, r = (b sqrt(p(p - b)) ) / (2p ). If b approaches p, then (p - b) approaches zero, so r approaches zero. Therefore, the distance between DE and BC is 2r, which also approaches zero. But then DE is approaching p/2, but at the same time, the tangent line DE is approaching the base BC. Wait, but how can that be?Wait, maybe my initial assumption that DE is located at a distance 2r from BC is incorrect. Let&#39;s re-examine that.In an isoceles triangle, the inradius is at a distance r from each side. If we draw a tangent line to the incircle parallel to the base, then the distance from the center of the incircle to this tangent line is r. Since the center is already at a distance r from the base, the total distance between the base and the tangent line would be 2r.But in reality, the distance from the base BC to the tangent line DE is 2r. However, the altitude h of the triangle is equal to the distance from vertex A to BC. If h = 2pr / b, then h must be greater than 2r, otherwise DE would be above A, which is impossible.Wait, h = 2pr / b. If h &gt; 2r, then 2pr / b &gt; 2r =&gt; p / b &gt; 1 =&gt; b &lt; p. Which is consistent with our earlier conclusion that b &lt; p. Therefore, as b approaches p, h approaches 2r, meaning that the altitude approaches twice the inradius.But if h = 2pr / b, then as b approaches p, h approaches 2r. Therefore, the distance from DE to BC is 2r, so the distance from A to DE is h - 2r = 2pr / b - 2r = 2r(p / b - 1). As b approaches p, this distance approaches 2r(p/p -1) = 0. So DE approaches BC, but the length DE approaches p/2.But in reality, when the triangle becomes degenerate, DE coincides with BC, so the length would be b, which approaches p. Wait, but this contradicts our previous conclusion. Wait, no. Wait, when the triangle is degenerate, DE is supposed to be a tangent to the incircle, but if the incircle has radius zero, then the tangent line is the same as BC. So DE would coincide with BC, giving length b = p. But according to our formula, DE = (b(2p - b))/2p. If b approaches p, DE approaches (p(2p - p))/2p = p² / 2p = p/2. But that&#39;s inconsistent with the degenerate case.Wait, that suggests a problem with the formula. Where did I go wrong?Let me re-examine the earlier steps. We had triangles ADE and ABC similar, with the ratio k = (h - 2r)/h, leading to DE = k * BC. Then DE = b * (1 - 2r/h ). Then we substituted h = 2pr / b, leading to DE = b * (1 - b/(2p)) ) = (b(2p - b))/2p.But if when b approaches p, DE approaches (p(2p - p))/2p = p² / 2p = p/2. However, in reality, if the triangle becomes degenerate (b approaching p), the incircle radius r approaches zero, so the tangent line DE would be very close to BC, and DE should approach BC&#39;s length, which is approaching p. So there&#39;s a contradiction here. Which suggests that the formula DE = (b(2p - b))/2p is incorrect.Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the distance from DE to BC is 2r. Let me check that again.The center of the incircle is located at a distance r from each side. If we draw a tangent line DE parallel to BC, then the distance from the center to DE is also r. Therefore, the distance between BC and DE is the distance from BC to the center (which is r) plus the distance from the center to DE (another r), totaling 2r. But in the case where the triangle is degenerate, the center is at BC itself (since the inradius is zero), so DE would coincide with BC, and the distance would be zero. But 2r would be zero as well. So that seems okay.But the problem arises when we use h = 2pr / b. If h is the altitude, then in a degenerate triangle, h would be zero. But if h = 2pr / b, then as b approaches p, h approaches 2pr / p = 2r. But in a degenerate triangle, h should approach zero. Therefore, there&#39;s a contradiction here. Which means my expression for h is wrong.Wait, let&#39;s recast. The area of the triangle is (base * height)/2 = (b * h)/2. The semiperimeter is p, so the inradius is r = Area / semiperimeter = (b h)/2 / p = (b h)/(2p). Therefore, solving for h gives h = 2pr / b. That is correct. However, in a degenerate triangle, as b approaches p, h approaches zero, so r must approach zero as well. So if h = 2pr / b, then if h approaches zero, r must approach zero faster than b approaches p.But in our previous analysis, DE = (b(2p - b))/2p. If b approaches p, DE approaches p/2. But in reality, DE should approach b, which is approaching p. So clearly, the formula is incorrect.Therefore, my mistake must be in the assumption that DE is similar to ABC with ratio (h - 2r)/h. Wait, in a non-degenerate triangle, if DE is a tangent to the incircle, then the distance from DE to BC is 2r. Then the distance from A to DE is h - 2r. So the ratio of similarity should be (h - 2r)/h. Therefore, DE = BC * (h - 2r)/h = b * (1 - 2r/h ). But if h = 2pr / b, then substituting gives DE = b * (1 - 2r / (2pr / b)) ) = b * (1 - (2r * b)/(2pr)) ) = b * (1 - b/(2p)) ), which is the same as before.But in the degenerate case, as b approaches p, DE should approach b, but according to this formula, DE approaches p/2. Which is a contradiction. Therefore, my error must lie in assuming that the distance from DE to BC is 2r. Let me re-examine that.The incircle is tangent to BC at a point, say F. The center of the incircle, I, is located at a distance r from BC. If we draw a tangent line DE parallel to BC, then the distance from I to DE is also r, since DE is tangent to the circle. Therefore, the total distance between BC and DE is the distance from BC to I (which is r) plus the distance from I to DE (which is another r). So total distance is 2r. But in the degenerate case, as the triangle becomes a line, the inradius r approaches zero, so DE would be BC itself, so distance zero. But according to 2r, it&#39;s also zero. So that works.But the problem arises in the formula for DE. Let&#39;s take a concrete example. Suppose the triangle is equilateral. Wait, but equilateral triangle has all sides equal. However, in our case, perimeter is 2p. If it&#39;s equilateral, each side is 2p/3. Then the inradius r of an equilateral triangle is (side length) * sqrt(3)/6. So r = (2p/3) * sqrt(3)/6 = (p sqrt(3))/9.Then the distance between DE and BC is 2r = 2p sqrt(3)/9. The altitude h of the equilateral triangle is (side length) * sqrt(3)/2 = (2p/3) * sqrt(3)/2 = p sqrt(3)/3. So the distance from A to DE is h - 2r = p sqrt(3)/3 - 2p sqrt(3)/9 = (3p sqrt(3) - 2p sqrt(3))/9 = p sqrt(3)/9. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is (p sqrt(3)/9)/(p sqrt(3)/3) = 1/3. Therefore, DE = BC * 1/3 = (2p/3) * 1/3 = 2p/9. But according to our formula DE = (b(2p - b))/2p. If b = 2p/3, then DE = (2p/3)(2p - 2p/3)/2p = (2p/3)(4p/3)/2p = (8p²/9)/2p = 4p/9. But this contradicts the actual calculation which gives DE = 2p/9.Therefore, there is a mistake in the formula. So my earlier reasoning is flawed. Therefore, I need to re-examine the derivation.Let me start over. Let&#39;s consider triangle ABC with base BC = b, AB = AC = a, perimeter 2p = 2a + b. The inradius r = area / semiperimeter. The area can be calculated as (b/2)*h, where h is the altitude. So area = (b/2)*h = (b/2)*sqrt(a² - (b/2)²). Therefore, r = [(b/2)*sqrt(a² - (b²)/4)] / p.Now, drawing a tangent DE to the incircle, parallel to BC. Let me denote the center of the incircle as I. The center I is located along the altitude from A to BC, at a distance r from BC. The tangent DE is parallel to BC and tangent to the incircle, so it is located at a distance of 2r from BC (since the center is r away from BC, and the tangent line is another r away from the center). Therefore, the distance from BC to DE is 2r.The altitude h of the triangle is the distance from A to BC. Therefore, the distance from A to DE is h - 2r. Since DE is parallel to BC, triangles ADE and ABC are similar. The ratio of similarity is (h - 2r)/h. Therefore, DE = BC * (h - 2r)/h = b * (h - 2r)/h.But h = sqrt(a² - (b²)/4). Also, from the area formula, area = (b/2)h = r * p =&gt; h = (2pr)/b.Therefore, substituting h into DE:DE = b * ( (2pr/b) - 2r ) / (2pr/b ) = b * ( 2pr/b - 2r ) / (2pr/b )Simplify numerator:2pr/b - 2r = 2r(p/b - 1)Denominator:2pr/bTherefore, DE = b * [ 2r(p/b - 1) ] / (2pr/b ) = b * [ 2r(p - b)/b ] / (2pr/b )Cancel out terms:= b * [ 2r(p - b)/b ] * [ b / 2pr ]= [ 2r(p - b) ] * [ b / 2pr ]= [ 2r(p - b) * b ] / [ 2pr ]= [ 2r b (p - b) ] / [ 2pr ]Cancel 2r:= [ b (p - b) ] / pSo DE = b(p - b)/pAh! So DE = b(p - b)/pWait, that&#39;s different from the previous result. So earlier mistake was incorrect substitution. So DE = b(p - b)/p. Let&#39;s verify this with the equilateral triangle example.If the triangle is equilateral with perimeter 2p, each side is 2p/3. So b = 2p/3. Then DE = (2p/3)(p - 2p/3)/p = (2p/3)(p/3)/p = (2p²/9)/p = 2p/9, which matches our previous correct calculation. Therefore, the correct formula is DE = b(p - b)/p.So this resolves the earlier contradiction. Therefore, DE = (b(p - b))/p.Therefore, to maximize DE, we need to maximize b(p - b) over b in (0, p). Since this is a quadratic in b, which opens downward, the maximum occurs at the vertex. The quadratic is f(b) = -b² + pb, so the vertex is at b = p/2. Therefore, the maximum DE is (p/2)(p - p/2)/p = (p/2)(p/2)/p = (p²/4)/p = p/4.Wait, so DE is maximized when b = p/2, giving DE = p/4.But let&#39;s check this with the equilateral triangle. If we set b = p/2, then perimeter is 2p, so each side a = (2p - p/2)/2 = (3p/2)/2 = 3p/4. So sides are 3p/4, 3p/4, and p/2. Then DE = (p/2)(p - p/2)/p = (p/2)(p/2)/p = p/4, which is correct.But in the equilateral triangle case, where each side is 2p/3, DE = 2p/9, which is less than p/4 (since 2/9 ≈ 0.222 and 1/4 = 0.25). Therefore, indeed, p/4 is larger, so the maximum DE occurs when the triangle is isoceles with base b = p/2, giving DE = p/4.Therefore, the answer should be p/4. But let&#39;s confirm with another example. Suppose b = p/2, then DE = (p/2)(p - p/2)/p = (p/2)(p/2)/p = p²/4 / p = p/4.Alternatively, take a very acute triangle with b very small. For example, let b approach 0. Then DE = (0)(p - 0)/p = 0, which makes sense because the triangle becomes very narrow, and the tangent line DE would be near the apex, giving a very small segment.Alternatively, if b approaches p, DE approaches (p)(p - p)/p = 0, which also matches our expectation (though as b approaches p, the triangle becomes degenerate, but DE approaches 0, which conflicts with our earlier incorrect formula but aligns with this correct one). Therefore, DE is maximized at b = p/2, giving DE = p/4.Thus, the maximum value is p/4.But wait, the problem states &quot;the greatest value that the length of the segment cut off by the lateral sides of the triangle on the tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base, can take if the perimeter of the triangle is 2 p&quot;.But we assumed the triangle is isoceles. The problem doesn&#39;t specify that the triangle must be isoceles. So is it possible that a non-isoceles triangle could give a larger DE?Hmm, this is a crucial point. My entire analysis was based on assuming an isoceles triangle. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the triangle is isoceles. Therefore, I need to verify whether the maximum occurs for an isoceles triangle or if a scalene triangle could yield a larger DE.To address this, let&#39;s consider a general triangle with sides a, b, c, perimeter 2p, so a + b + c = 2p. Without loss of generality, let&#39;s take BC as the base, length c. We need to draw a tangent to the incircle parallel to BC and find the length of the segment DE cut off by the lateral sides AB and AC.In a general triangle, the length of DE can be found using similar triangles, but the inradius and other parameters would be different. However, the problem is asking for the maximum possible DE over all triangles with perimeter 2p. Given the complexity of dealing with general triangles, maybe the maximum indeed occurs for the isoceles case due to symmetry, but we need to confirm.Alternatively, we can use the result from the isoceles case and argue that for a given base length, the isoceles triangle maximizes DE. Therefore, the overall maximum occurs when the triangle is isoceles.Alternatively, we can use calculus of variations or Lagrange multipliers to maximize DE over all possible triangles with perimeter 2p.Let me attempt this.Let’s denote the triangle with sides a, b, c, with c being the base. The perimeter is a + b + c = 2p. The semiperimeter is s = p. The inradius r = Area / s. The area can be calculated via Heron&#39;s formula: Area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ).Drawing a tangent to the incircle parallel to the base c. The distance from the base to this tangent is 2r. The altitude corresponding to the base c is h_c = 2 * Area / c. Therefore, the distance from the apex opposite c to the tangent line is h_c - 2r. The ratio of similarity between the small triangle (formed by the tangent) and the original triangle is (h_c - 2r)/h_c. Therefore, the length DE is c * (h_c - 2r)/h_c = c - (2r c)/h_c.But h_c = 2 * Area / c, so substituting:DE = c - (2r c)/(2 * Area / c) ) = c - (2r c²)/(2 Area) ) = c - (r c²)/Area.But r = Area / s = Area / p. Therefore:DE = c - ( (Area / p ) * c² ) / Area ) = c - c² / p = c(1 - c/p ) = c(p - c)/p.Wait, so in the general case, DE = c(p - c)/p, where c is the length of the base. This is exactly the same formula as in the isoceles case! Therefore, regardless of the triangle being isoceles or not, DE only depends on the length of the base c and the perimeter. Therefore, DE = c(p - c)/p.Therefore, to maximize DE, we need to maximize c(p - c)/p, which is a quadratic function of c. The maximum occurs at c = p/2, giving DE = (p/2)(p - p/2)/p = (p/2)(p/2)/p = p/4.Therefore, the maximum value of DE is p/4, achieved when the base c = p/2, regardless of the triangle being isoceles or not. However, if the base is c = p/2, then the other sides sum to 2p - p/2 = 3p/2. But the triangle can have any configuration with base p/2 and the other two sides summing to 3p/2. However, the maximum DE is the same for all such triangles, as DE only depends on the base length.But wait, in the general case, DE = c(p - c)/p. This suggests that DE is purely a function of the base length c, and does not depend on the other sides. Therefore, for any triangle with base length c, DE is the same, regardless of the other sides. Therefore, to maximize DE, we only need to maximize c(p - c)/p, which is maximized at c = p/2. Therefore, the maximum DE is p/4, achieved when the base is p/2, regardless of the triangle&#39;s other sides.However, this seems counterintuitive. For example, if we have a triangle with base c = p/2 and very long other sides, would DE still be p/4?Wait, let&#39;s test with a specific example. Suppose we have a triangle with base c = p/2, and the other two sides are a = (3p/2)/2 + k and b = (3p/2)/2 - k for some k. The perimeter is still 2p. Let&#39;s compute DE.According to the formula, DE = c(p - c)/p = (p/2)(p - p/2)/p = p/4.But let&#39;s compute DE manually. First, compute the inradius. The semiperimeter s = p. The area is sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ) = sqrt( p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c) ). Let&#39;s take c = p/2, so s - c = p - p/2 = p/2. Let a = (3p/4) + k and b = (3p/4) - k. Then s - a = p - (3p/4 + k ) = p/4 - k, and s - b = p - (3p/4 - k ) = p/4 + k. Therefore, area = sqrt( p * (p/4 - k ) * (p/4 + k ) * (p/2 ) ) = sqrt( p * ( (p/4)^2 - k² ) * p/2 ) = sqrt( p * (p²/16 - k² ) * p/2 ) = sqrt( p²/2 (p²/16 - k² ) ) = p * sqrt( (p²/16 - k² ) / 2 ).The inradius r = Area / p = sqrt( (p²/16 - k² ) / 2 ).The altitude h_c = 2 * Area / c = 2 * [ p * sqrt( (p²/16 - k² ) / 2 ) ] / (p/2 ) = 4 * sqrt( (p²/16 - k² ) / 2 ) = 4 * sqrt( p²/32 - k² / 2 ) = 4 * ( sqrt( p² - 16k² ) / (4 * sqrt(2)) ) ) ) Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s compute DE via the formula DE = c(p - c)/p = p/4.Alternatively, according to our previous conclusion, DE = c(p - c)/p, which is independent of k, so DE is always p/4, regardless of k. Therefore, even if we take k approaching 3p/4, making one side very long and the other approaching zero, DE remains p/4. But in that case, the triangle becomes degenerate when k approaches 3p/4, but DE is still p/4.Therefore, this suggests that the length DE is indeed independent of the other sides and only depends on the base length. Therefore, the maximum DE is p/4, achieved when the base is p/2. Therefore, regardless of the triangle&#39;s specific shape, as long as the base is p/2, DE will be p/4.Therefore, the greatest value is p/4.Final AnswerThe greatest value is boxed{dfrac{p}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a triangle with perimeter (2p), we need to find the greatest value of the length of the segment cut off by the lateral sides of the triangle on the tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base.1. Understanding the Problem:   - The triangle has a perimeter of (2p).   - We need to consider the segment cut off by the lateral sides on a tangent to the inscribed circle parallel to the base.2. Key Concepts:   - The inradius (r) of the triangle.   - The distance from the base to the tangent line parallel to the base is (2r).   - The length of the segment (DE) cut by the tangent line is determined by similar triangles.3. Analysis for Isosceles Triangle:   - Assume an isosceles triangle with base (b) and equal sides (a).   - Perimeter: (2a + b = 2p implies a = frac{2p - b}{2}).   - The inradius (r) and altitude (h) are related to the area and semiperimeter.   - The segment DE is found using similarity of triangles, leading to the formula (DE = frac{b(2p - b)}{2p}).4. General Case Analysis:   - For any triangle with base (c), the length of the segment DE is given by (DE = frac{c(p - c)}{p}).   - This formula is derived using the properties of similar triangles and the inradius.5. Maximizing the Segment DE:   - The function (DE = frac{c(p - c)}{p}) is a quadratic function in terms of (c).   - The maximum value occurs at (c = frac{p}{2}), leading to (DE = frac{p}{4}).6. Conclusion:   - The maximum length of the segment DE is achieved when the base of the triangle is (frac{p}{2}), regardless of the triangle&#39;s specific shape.Thus, the greatest value of the length of the segment cut off by the lateral sides of the triangle on the tangent to the inscribed circle, drawn parallel to the base, is (boxed{dfrac{p}{4}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🔑:</span>62.

In how many different ways can n women and n men be arranged so that no two neighbors are of the same gender, and this is:a) in a single row,b) around a round table with 2n seats.</div><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here about arranging n women and n men either in a single row or around a round table, with the condition that no two neighbors are of the same gender. Let me try to figure out both parts step by step. Starting with part a) first: arranging them in a single row. The requirement is that no two adjacent people are of the same gender. So, if I think about a row, the arrangement has to alternate between men and women. But wait, how do we count the number of ways to do this?Let me recall that for such alternating arrangements, the first position can be either a man or a woman. Once the first position is chosen, the rest have to alternate. So, if we start with a man, the next has to be a woman, then a man, and so on. Similarly, if we start with a woman, the next has to be a man, then a woman, etc. But since we have an equal number of men and women (n each), starting with a man would mean that the last person is also a man, but wait, in a row with 2n seats, starting with a man would lead to positions 1,3,5,...2n-1 being men and 2,4,6,...2n being women. Similarly, starting with a woman would alternate the other way. But since we have n men and n women, both arrangements are possible because we need exactly n men and n women. For example, in a row of 2n seats, if we alternate starting with a man, we need n men and n women, which fits. Similarly starting with a woman, same thing. So there are 2 possibilities for the starting gender.But then, within each gender, we can arrange the men and women independently. So, for each starting gender, we can arrange the men in n! ways and the women in n! ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements would be 2 * n! * n!.Wait, is that right? Let me check with a small n. Let&#39;s take n=1: 1 man and 1 woman. The possible arrangements are MW and WM, which is 2, and 2 * 1! * 1! = 2, which matches. For n=2: 2 men and 2 women. The possible arrangements would start with M or W. For starting with M: M W M W, which can be arranged as 2! ways for men and 2! for women, so 2*2=4. Similarly starting with W: W M W M, another 4, total 8. And indeed, 2 * 2! * 2! = 8. That works. So I think part a) is 2 * n! * n!.Now moving to part b): around a round table with 2n seats. Circular arrangements are trickier because rotations are considered the same. In linear arrangements, the starting position matters, but in circular, we fix one position to account for rotational symmetry. In circular arrangements, the usual formula for permutations is (n-1)! because fixing one person&#39;s position and arranging the rest. But here, we have the additional constraint that genders must alternate. So, how does that affect things?First, let&#39;s think: in a circular table, if we alternate genders, the number of men and women must be equal, which they are (n each). But in a circular arrangement, starting with a man or a woman might lead to the same arrangement when rotated. Wait, but if we fix the position of one person, say, fix a man in a seat, then the rest must alternate. So, once we fix a man&#39;s position, the seats clockwise from him must be woman, man, woman, etc. So, in a circular table, once you fix the position of one gender, the rest are determined in terms of gender. Unlike the linear case where you could start with either gender, in the circular case, starting with a man or a woman is considered the same if you can rotate to get one from the other. Wait, but since the table is circular, if you fix one seat as a man, the gender alternation is fixed around the table. Therefore, there are only two possibilities for the entire arrangement: one where the fixed seat is a man, and alternating, or a woman and alternating. But since rotations are considered the same, but reflections might not be? Wait, no, in circular arrangements, unless specified, reflections are considered different. Wait, actually, in circular permutations, sometimes they consider arrangements the same under rotation but not reflection. But in this problem, I think we need to consider two arrangements different if they are rotated or reflected versions. Wait, the problem says &quot;arranged around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. Usually, unless stated otherwise, arrangements around a table are considered different up to rotation, but reflections are different. But maybe here, since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, but in standard combinatorics, when arranging people around a table, rotations are considered the same, but reflections are different. Hmm, but I need to confirm.Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;in a single row&quot; for part a), so linear arrangement, and &quot;around a round table&quot; for part b). For circular arrangements, the number is usually divided by the number of seats to account for rotations. But here, since we have a gender constraint, maybe fixing the gender arrangement first.Wait, let me think again. Let&#39;s suppose that in the circular case, we can fix one person&#39;s seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. So, fix a man in a particular seat. Then, the rest of the seats alternate between women and men. Therefore, the seats are fixed in terms of gender: seats 1,3,5,...2n-1 are men and seats 2,4,6,...2n are women. But once we fix one man&#39;s position, we can arrange the remaining (n-1)! men in the other male seats and n! women in the female seats. So the total number would be (n-1)! * n!.But wait, but if we fix a man&#39;s position, is the alternation direction fixed? Because in a circle, if you fix a man, the next seat must be a woman, but since it&#39;s a circle, the last seat (next to the fixed man) must also be a woman. So the alternation is forced once you fix one gender. Therefore, there is only one way to assign the genders once you fix one person. Therefore, the total number of arrangements would be fixing a man, then arranging the remaining (n-1)! men and n! women. But wait, but we could also fix a woman. Wait, but if we fix a woman, the alternation would be woman, man, woman, etc., which would result in different gender assignments. But in the problem, there are equal numbers of men and women, so both possibilities (starting with man or woman) are possible. But in circular arrangements, are these considered different? Because if you fix a man, you get one arrangement, and if you fix a woman, you get another. But if you can rotate the table, fixing a man or a woman would lead to different arrangements only if they are not rotations of each other. Wait, no. If you fix a man, the arrangement is determined with men in fixed seats. If you fix a woman, it&#39;s another arrangement. However, if you can rotate the table so that a woman is in the seat where a man was fixed, but the problem is that since the genders alternate, rotating by one seat would not preserve the gender alternation. Because if you have a man in seat 1, woman in seat 2, ..., man in seat 2n, then rotating by one seat would put a woman in seat 1, which is a different gender arrangement. Therefore, these two possibilities (starting with a man or a woman) are distinct even considering rotations, because you can&#39;t rotate a male-starting arrangement to get a female-starting one. But wait, in circular arrangements, we usually fix one position to remove rotational symmetry. So if we fix seat 1 to be a man, then the rest of the arrangement is determined (alternating genders). Then, we can arrange the men in the fixed male seats (n seats) and women in the female seats (n seats). Since we fixed one man in seat 1, the number of ways to arrange the men is (n-1)! and women is n!. Therefore, total arrangements would be (n-1)! * n!.But if we don&#39;t fix the gender of seat 1, then there are two possibilities: seat 1 is a man or a woman. But in circular arrangements, if we don&#39;t fix any position, then these two possibilities (starting with man or woman) are considered different arrangements because they cannot be rotated into each other. Therefore, the total number would be 2 * (n-1)! * n!.Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Let me clarify.In circular arrangements, when considering arrangements where rotations are considered the same, but reflections are different. So, to count circular arrangements with alternating genders, we can either:1. Fix the position of one person to eliminate rotational symmetry. For example, fix a man in seat 1. Then, the rest of the seats&#39; genders are determined (alternating). Then, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! * n!.Alternatively, if we don&#39;t fix a gender, then there are two distinct circular arrangements: one starting with a man and alternating, the other starting with a woman and alternating. Each of these can&#39;t be rotated into each other. Therefore, the total number of arrangements would be 2 * (n! * n!). But wait, no. Wait, in circular arrangements, once you fix the gender pattern (starting with man or woman), you have to account for rotations. Wait, this is confusing.Wait, let&#39;s think again. Let&#39;s say we have a circular table. If we require that the genders alternate, then the two possible gender patterns are either M, W, M, W,... or W, M, W, M,... around the table. These are two distinct patterns because you cannot rotate one into the other without changing the starting gender. Therefore, there are two possibilities for the gender arrangement. For each gender arrangement, once the seats for men and women are fixed, the number of ways to arrange the men is n! and the women is n!. However, in circular permutations, we usually divide by the number of seats to account for rotations. Wait, but here, since the gender alternation is fixed, rotations that maintain the gender alternation are already considered. Wait, but if we fix the gender arrangement (either starting with M or W), then each such arrangement is rotationally unique because the genders are fixed in their positions.Wait, no. For example, suppose we have a circular table with seats labeled 1 to 6 (n=3). If we fix the gender arrangement as M, W, M, W, M, W, then rotating by two seats would result in M, W, M, W, M, W again. Wait, no. If you rotate by one seat, the arrangement would start with W, M, W, M, W, M, which is the other gender pattern. So, if you rotate a gender pattern by one seat, it becomes the other gender pattern. Therefore, if we consider arrangements up to rotation, the two gender patterns are equivalent under rotation. But in the problem, since it&#39;s around a round table, but the seats are not labeled, but the people are distinguishable. Therefore, in circular arrangements, two arrangements are considered the same if one can be rotated to get the other. However, in this case, if you have a gender-alternating arrangement, rotating it by one seat would change the gender pattern (from starting with M to starting with W or vice versa). Therefore, if we consider rotations, the two gender patterns are in the same equivalence class if we allow rotation. Wait, but the problem says &quot;arranged around a round table&quot;. I think that in standard terminology, arrangements around a round table are considered the same if they can be rotated into each other. However, here, the problem says &quot;arranged around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. Since the seats are not labeled, but the people are distinguishable. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is the number of linear arrangements divided by 2n (to account for rotations). But here, we have the constraint of alternating genders.Wait, perhaps another approach. For circular arrangements with alternating genders, how many distinct arrangements are there?First, fix the gender of one person to break the rotational symmetry. Let&#39;s fix a man in seat 1. Then, the rest of the seats are determined: seat 2 must be a woman, seat 3 a man, etc. Now, the men are in seats 1, 3, ..., 2n-1, and women in 2, 4, ..., 2n. Then, the number of ways to arrange the men is (n-1)! because we fixed one man in seat 1, and the remaining n-1 men can be arranged in the remaining n-1 male seats. Similarly, the women can be arranged in n! ways in their seats. Therefore, total arrangements would be (n-1)! * n!.Alternatively, if we fix a woman in seat 1, then similarly we get (n-1)! * n! arrangements. So if we don&#39;t fix the gender, but account for both possibilities, we would have 2 * (n-1)! * n!.But wait, if we don&#39;t fix the gender, can we rotate the arrangement to switch between male and female starting positions? For example, if we have an arrangement starting with a man, rotating it by one seat would start with a woman. But since we consider rotations as the same arrangement, these two would be considered the same. But the problem states that we need arrangements where no two neighbors are of the same gender. However, if we fix the gender arrangement, starting with a man or a woman, they are different in terms of seat assignments, but if you rotate the table, you can switch between them. But if we consider the circular arrangements up to rotation, then there is only one gender pattern. Wait, but if you fix the seat of one person, then the rest is determined. So perhaps the correct answer is only (n-1)! * n!.Wait, now I&#39;m confused. Let me check a small example. Let&#39;s take n=1: 1 man and 1 woman around a table with 2 seats. The possible arrangements are man and woman sitting opposite each other. Since it&#39;s a circular table, rotating by 180 degrees would swap their positions, but since there are only two seats, the two linear arrangements (MW and WM) become the same circular arrangement. Wait, but with two seats, a circular table is effectively the same as a line because there&#39;s no distinction between rotation. Wait, no, with two seats, a circular table is just two seats next to each other, forming a circle. So seating two people around a table with two seats: there&#39;s only one arrangement, because rotating by 1 seat swaps the two people. But if they are distinguishable, then it&#39;s considered the same arrangement if you rotate. But in reality, for two people, the number of distinct circular arrangements is 1, which is (2-1)! = 1. But in our case, with a man and a woman, they are distinguishable by gender. So if you have seat 1: man, seat 2: woman, rotating it would give seat 1: woman, seat 2: man. But since the problem says arrangements are different if the genders are in different seats. Wait, no, in circular arrangements, if you can rotate to get the same arrangement, they are considered the same. But since the people are distinguishable by gender, rotating would result in a different arrangement. Wait, if the table is unmarked, then rotating doesn&#39;t change the arrangement. But if the seats are labeled, then it&#39;s different. The problem says &quot;around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify if the seats are labeled or not. In combinatorics problems, unless specified, it&#39;s usually assumed that the seats are unlabeled, and arrangements are considered the same under rotation. However, since the people are distinguishable (they are distinct individuals, just grouped into men and women), the number of distinct arrangements would be (number of linear arrangements)/number of rotations. But with the gender alternation constraint, let&#39;s see.Wait, for n=1: 1 man, 1 woman. In a circular table with 2 seats. The linear arrangements are 2: MW and WM. But in circular arrangement, these two are considered the same because rotating one gives the other. Therefore, the number of circular arrangements is 1. But according to the formula (n-1)! * n! = 0! * 1! = 1. So that matches. If we use 2 * (n-1)! * n! for n=1, that would be 2 * 1 = 2, which doesn&#39;t match. So maybe the correct formula is (n-1)! * n!.But let&#39;s check n=2. For n=2: 2 men and 2 women. In a circular table with 4 seats. Let&#39;s compute the number of arrangements.First, fix a man in seat 1. Then, the seats 1,3 are men, and 2,4 are women. The remaining man can be arranged in 1! = 1 way, and the women can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So total arrangements: 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if we don&#39;t fix a man, and consider both possibilities (starting with man or woman), but in circular arrangements, starting with man or woman would be different only if you can&#39;t rotate into each other. However, if you fix a man&#39;s position, you account for all rotational arrangements starting with a man. Similarly, fixing a woman&#39;s position accounts for the others. But since starting with a man or a woman are different in terms of the gender pattern, but if you can rotate to switch them, they would be the same. Wait, in n=2, if you fix a man in seat 1, the arrangement is determined as M, W, M, W. If you rotate two seats, it becomes M, W, M, W again. If you rotate one seat, it becomes W, M, W, M. Which is a different gender arrangement. Therefore, if we consider arrangements up to rotation, then fixing a man in seat 1 gives a unique arrangement, but there&#39;s another arrangement starting with a woman. However, in circular tables, if we consider the seats unlabeled, these two are different because you cannot rotate one into the other. Wait, but in reality, in an unlabeled circular table, an arrangement is determined up to rotation. Therefore, if you have a gender-alternating arrangement, starting with a man or a woman, they are different because you can&#39;t rotate one into the other. Wait, if the table is unlabeled, but the people are distinguishable, then two arrangements are different if the sequence of people is different, even if they can be rotated into each other. Wait, no. In circular arrangements, if you can rotate one arrangement to get another, they are considered the same. But since the people are distinguishable, even if you rotate, if the order of the people is different, it&#39;s a different arrangement. Wait, this is confusing.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. Suppose we have four people: M1, M2, W1, W2. In a circular table with four seats. If we fix M1 in seat 1, then seat 3 is M2, seat 2 is W1, seat 4 is W2. This is one arrangement. If we rotate the table so that M1 is in seat 2, but since we have to alternate genders, seat 3 would have to be a woman, but M1 is a man, so this is not possible. Therefore, the arrangement where M1 is in seat 1 cannot be rotated into another arrangement where M1 is in seat 2 because that would break the gender alternation. Therefore, in circular arrangements with gender alternation, rotations that preserve the gender alternation are limited. Specifically, you can only rotate by even numbers of seats (for 2n seats). Rotating by two seats in a four-seat table would take M1 from seat 1 to seat 3, which is still a male seat. So, such a rotation would result in a different arrangement (M1 in seat 3) but same gender pattern. Therefore, to account for rotational symmetry, we need to fix one person&#39;s seat. Therefore, if we fix M1 in seat 1, then the other man M2 can be in seat 3, and the women W1 and W2 can be in seats 2 and 4. The number of arrangements is 1! (for the men) * 2! (for the women) = 2. Similarly, if we don&#39;t fix M1, the total number would be number of circular arrangements starting with any man. Wait, but in circular arrangements, fixing one person&#39;s seat removes rotational symmetry. So if we fix M1 in seat 1, then the rest are arranged as above. If we don&#39;t fix anyone, then the total number is calculated as follows: first, choose a gender arrangement (starting with M or W). For each gender arrangement, the number of circular arrangements is (n-1)! * n!. So for starting with M: (n-1)! * n! and starting with W: (n-1)! * n!, but since starting with M or W are different and can&#39;t be rotated into each other, total is 2 * (n-1)! * n!.Wait, but when n=1, this would give 2 * 0! * 1! = 2, but we know that for n=1, the circular arrangement is only 1. Contradiction. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.Wait, n=1 case: 1 man and 1 woman around a 2-seat table. The possible linear arrangements are MW and WM. In circular arrangements, these two are considered the same because rotating the table by 1 seat turns MW into WM. But since the people are distinguishable by gender, is MW considered different from WM in a circular table? If the table is unlabeled, then yes, because there&#39;s no fixed reference point. But if we consider that in circular arrangements, two seatings are the same if one can be rotated to get the other. So if you have MW and WM, rotating MW by 1 seat gives WM, so they are the same. Therefore, for n=1, there&#39;s only 1 arrangement. But according to the formula (n-1)! * n! = 0! * 1! = 1, which matches. If we use 2 * (n-1)! * n! for n=1, we get 2, which is wrong. Therefore, the correct formula must be (n-1)! * n! for circular arrangements. However, why does fixing one gender not account for both possibilities? Because once you fix a man&#39;s seat, you can&#39;t get the woman-starting arrangement by rotation. Therefore, fixing a man&#39;s seat counts only the arrangements where a man is in that seat, and similarly for a woman. But if we don&#39;t fix any seat, and consider all possible rotations, then the total number should be 2 * (n-1)! * n!. But in the n=1 case, that formula gives 2, which is wrong. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.Wait, perhaps in circular arrangements with alternating genders, once you fix the gender of one person, the entire arrangement&#39;s gender is fixed, so there are two distinct gender arrangements: one starting with a man and one starting with a woman. However, in the case of n=1, these two are equivalent under rotation. Wait, no. If you have a two-seat table, fixing a man in one seat forces the other seat to be a woman, and fixing a woman in one seat forces the other to be a man. But in a circular table, these two are different because there&#39;s no way to rotate one into the other. Wait, actually, rotating a two-seat table by 180 degrees swaps the two seats. If the seats are unlabeled, then MW and WM are the same arrangement. But if the seats are labeled, then they are different. This is the crux of the issue.In most combinatorial problems involving circular tables, unless specified otherwise, we assume that rotations are considered the same, but reflections are different. However, in this problem, since it&#39;s about alternating genders, and if we fix the gender of one seat, the rest are determined. But how does the circular nature affect the count?Actually, the standard approach for circular arrangements with alternating genders is as follows: fix the position of one person to eliminate rotational symmetry. Suppose we fix a man&#39;s position. Then, the rest of the men must be arranged in the remaining male seats (alternating), and the women in the female seats. The number of ways to arrange the men is (n-1)! and the women is n!. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is (n-1)! * n!.But if we don&#39;t fix the gender of the first seat, there are two possibilities: starting with a man or a woman. However, these are considered different arrangements because they cannot be rotated into each other. Therefore, the total number is 2 * (n-1)! * n!.But in the n=1 case, this would give 2 * 0! * 1! = 2, which contradicts the actual number of arrangements (which is 1). Therefore, there must be an error here.Wait, perhaps when n=1, the two arrangements (MW and WM) are considered the same in a circular table because rotating the table swaps them. Therefore, the answer for n=1 should be 1. However, according to the formula (n-1)! * n! = 1, which matches. But how does this formula account for starting with a man or a woman?Ah, maybe in the formula (n-1)! * n!, we have already fixed the gender of the first seat (say, man), and thus accounted for all arrangements starting with a man. But if we also allow starting with a woman, then we need to double it. However, in the circular case, starting with a man or a woman are different and cannot be rotated into each other. Therefore, the total number should be 2 * (n-1)! * n!.But in n=1, this formula gives 2, but actual is 1. Therefore, there must be a special case when n=1. Wait, but when n=1, we have two seats. If we fix a man in seat 1, then seat 2 is a woman. If we fix a woman in seat 1, seat 2 is a man. But in a circular table, are these two considered different? If the table is unlabeled, then rotating the table by 180 degrees would swap seat 1 and seat 2. If the people are distinguishable by gender, then MW and WM are different because the man and woman are in different positions relative to each other. Wait, but in a circular table with two seats, there&#39;s no fixed orientation, so MW and WM are the same arrangement because you can rotate the table to get from one to the other. Therefore, for n=1, the answer should be 1, not 2. Therefore, this suggests that when n=1, the number of arrangements is 1, which is (n-1)! * n! = 1. If we use 2 * (n-1)! * n!, it would be 2, which is wrong. Therefore, the formula must be (n-1)! * n!.But why is there a discrepancy? Because in n=1, starting with a man or a woman are the same due to the table being circular. But for n &gt;1, starting with a man or a woman are different. Wait, no. For n=2, starting with a man or a woman would give different arrangements that can&#39;t be rotated into each other. For example, in a four-seat table, starting with a man, the arrangement is M, W, M, W. Starting with a woman, it&#39;s W, M, W, M. You can&#39;t rotate one into the other. Therefore, for n=2, the number of arrangements should be 2 * (n-1)! * n! = 2 * 1! * 2! = 4. Let&#39;s check manually.For n=2, two men M1, M2 and two women W1, W2. The possible arrangements around a circular table with alternating genders:If we fix a man in seat 1, then seat 3 is M2. Seats 2 and 4 are W1 and W2. The women can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Similarly, if we fix a woman in seat 1, then seat 3 is W2, and seats 2 and 4 are M1 and M2. The men can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So total arrangements: 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches 2 * (n-1)! * n! = 4. But in the circular case, if we don&#39;t fix the gender, the total number is 4, but according to (n-1)! * n! = 2, which is half. Therefore, the formula must be 2 * (n-1)! * n!.But then why does n=1 give 1 instead of 2? It seems like for n=1, the formula 2 * (n-1)! * n! gives 2, but the correct answer is 1. This inconsistency suggests that the formula might be (n-1)! * n! for circular arrangements regardless of starting gender, because when you fix one person&#39;s seat, you automatically determine the gender pattern. However, when n=1, fixing a man&#39;s seat gives 1 arrangement, and fixing a woman&#39;s seat gives another, but in reality, they are the same due to the table&#39;s circular nature. Therefore, maybe the formula is different.Wait, perhaps when n=1, the number of arrangements is 1, and for n &gt;1, it&#39;s 2 * (n-1)! * n!. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is (n-1)! * n! for all n &gt;=1, because when you fix the gender of one seat, the other seats&#39; genders are determined, and you don&#39;t need to multiply by 2. But in the case of n=2, fixing a man&#39;s seat gives 2 arrangements, and fixing a woman&#39;s seat gives another 2 arrangements, totaling 4. However, if you fix a man&#39;s seat, and then the formula (n-1)! * n! gives 2, but the total should include fixing a woman as well.This is confusing. Let me check a reference. In standard combinatorics, the number of ways to arrange n men and n women alternately around a circular table is 2 * (n! * (n-1)!). Wait, no. Let me recall that in a circular arrangement, fixing one person&#39;s seat removes rotational symmetry. Suppose we fix a man&#39;s seat. Then, the women can be arranged in n! ways and the remaining men in (n-1)! ways. Therefore, total arrangements: n! * (n-1)!.But if we don&#39;t fix the starting gender, there are two possibilities: starting with a man or a woman. However, in circular arrangements, these two are different because you can&#39;t rotate one into the other. Therefore, the total number should be 2 * n! * (n-1)!.Wait, but for n=1, that gives 2 * 1! * 0! = 2, which is wrong. So, perhaps the correct formula is (n-1)! * n! if we fix the gender of the first seat. However, if we have to consider both genders starting, it&#39;s 2 * (n-1)! * n!.But when n=1, that formula gives 2, but the correct answer is 1. Therefore, the formula must be different for n=1. But perhaps the problem assumes n &gt;=2? The problem states &quot;n women and n men&quot;, so n can be any positive integer. Therefore, there must be a general formula that works for all n &gt;=1.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. In linear arrangements, the number is 2 * n! * n! because we can start with either gender and arrange both. In circular arrangements, the number is different because rotations are considered the same. However, when genders alternate, the two possible linear arrangements (starting with M or W) correspond to two distinct circular arrangements, because you cannot rotate one into the other. Therefore, in circular arrangements, the number is the same as linear arrangements divided by the number of rotations that preserve the gender alternation. But since gender alternation is fixed, the number of rotational symmetries that preserve the arrangement is n. Wait, no. Wait, in a circular arrangement with 2n seats, if the genders are alternating, rotating by two seats would preserve the gender alternation. For example, in a 4-seat table, rotating by two seats would keep the gender arrangement. Therefore, the number of rotational symmetries that preserve the gender alternation is n. Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements would be (2 * n! * n!) / (2n) ) = (n! * n!) / n = (n-1)! * n!.Wait, this seems plausible. Let&#39;s see. For linear arrangements, we have 2 * n! * n! arrangements. In circular arrangements, each equivalence class under rotation has 2n elements. However, due to the alternating gender constraint, rotations that shift by an odd number of seats break the alternation, so only rotations by even numbers of seats (multiples of 2) preserve the gender alternation. Therefore, the number of rotational symmetries preserving the gender arrangement is n (rotating by 2, 4, ..., 2n seats). Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements is (2 * n! * n!) / (2n) ) = (n! * n! ) / n = (n-1)! * n!.Yes, this makes sense. For example, when n=1: 2 *1! *1! / 2 = 1, which matches. For n=2: 2 * 2! * 2! / 4 = 2 * 2 * 2 /4 = 8 /4 = 2. But wait, manually we found 4 arrangements. What&#39;s wrong here?Wait, if we use the formula (2 * n! * n! ) / 2n = (n! * n! ) /n = (n-1)! * n!. For n=2, that gives (2-1)! * 2! = 1 * 2 = 2. But manually, for n=2, we have 4 arrangements. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the formula must be incorrect.Wait, maybe the number of rotational symmetries that preserve the gender alternation is 2. For example, rotating by 0 (identity) and rotating by n seats (which flips the arrangement). For example, in a 4-seat table, rotating by 2 seats swaps M1 and M2, and W1 and W2. So, if we have an arrangement M1, W1, M2, W2, rotating by 2 seats gives M2, W2, M1, W1. Which is a different arrangement unless M1=M2 and W1=W2. Since the people are distinguishable, these are different arrangements. Therefore, the number of rotational symmetries that preserve the gender alternation is 2: identity and rotation by n seats. Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements is (2 * n! *n!) / 2 = n! *n!.But for n=1, that gives 1! *1! =1, which matches. For n=2, 2! *2! =4, which matches the manual count. But this contradicts the initial assumption that circular arrangements are divided by the number of seats. So which is correct?Wait, in standard circular permutations without restrictions, the number is (number of linear permutations)/number of seats, because any rotation gives the same arrangement. But when there are restrictions that reduce the number of symmetries, we need to divide by the number of symmetries that preserve the arrangement.In this case, gender-alternating circular arrangements have rotational symmetries that preserve the alternation. The only rotations that preserve the gender alternation are the identity rotation and rotation by n seats (which is a 180-degree rotation for even n). For example, in a 4-seat table, rotating by 2 seats (which is n=2) swaps the men and women but keeps the alternation. Wait, no. Rotating by 2 seats in a 4-seat table changes the positions but maintains the gender alternation. For example, original arrangement: M1, W1, M2, W2. After rotating by 2 seats: M2, W2, M1, W1. The gender alternation is preserved, but the order of the people is changed. Since the people are distinguishable, this is a different arrangement. Therefore, the only symmetry that preserves the arrangement is the identity rotation. Therefore, the number of rotational symmetries preserving the arrangement is 1, so the number of circular arrangements is the number of linear arrangements divided by 2n. But in our case, with gender alternation, the number of linear arrangements is 2 *n! *n!.Therefore, circular arrangements would be 2 *n! *n! / 2n = (n! *n!)/n = (n-1)! *n!.But when n=2, this gives 1! *2! =2, but manually we have 4 arrangements. Therefore, the formula must be wrong. What&#39;s the mistake here?Wait, perhaps the automorphism group (symmetries preserving the gender alternation) is larger. For example, in a 4-seat table, rotating by 2 seats preserves the gender alternation but changes the people&#39;s order. Since the people are distinguishable, these are different arrangements, so we shouldn&#39;t factor them out. Therefore, the only symmetry that gives equivalent arrangements is the identity. Therefore, the number of circular arrangements is 2 *n! *n! /1 =2 *n! *n!.But for n=1, this gives 2, which is wrong. For n=2, 2*2*2=8, which is more than the manual count of 4. Therefore, this is also incorrect.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. In linear arrangements, we have 2 *n! *n! ways. In circular arrangements, we need to subtract the cases where rotating the arrangement would result in the same sequence. But given that people are distinguishable, it&#39;s unlikely that any non-identity rotation would result in the same arrangement. Therefore, the number of circular arrangements should be the number of linear arrangements divided by the number of seats (2n), because each circular arrangement corresponds to 2n linear arrangements (rotations). Therefore, the number of circular arrangements is (2 *n! *n!)/ (2n)= (n! *n!)/n= (n-1)! *n!.But when n=2, this gives (2! *2!)/2=4/2=2, but manually we have 4 arrangements. Therefore, conflict.Wait, what&#39;s the actual manual count for n=2. Let&#39;s do it.We have two men M1, M2 and two women W1, W2. In a circular table with four seats, alternating genders. Let&#39;s fix M1 at seat 1. Then seat 3 is M2. Seats 2 and 4 are W1 and W2. The women can be arranged in 2 ways: W1 at seat 2 and W2 at seat 4, or W2 at seat 2 and W1 at seat4. Similarly, if we fix M2 at seat1, seat3 is M1, and women can be arranged similarly. But since we&#39;re considering circular arrangements, fixing M1 or M2 at seat1 is different arrangements. Wait, no. If we fix M1 at seat1, M2 at seat3, women at 2 and 4. If we fix M2 at seat1, it&#39;s a different arrangement. But in circular arrangements, fixing different people at the same seat is considered different arrangements. However, if we don&#39;t fix any seat, then each unique circular arrangement is counted once. But the problem is that in circular arrangements, we need to account for rotations. However, in our case, the gender alternation imposes that rotations by even numbers of seats preserve the gender alternation but change the people&#39;s positions. Since the people are distinguishable, these are different arrangements.Therefore, the number of circular arrangements should be the same as the number of linear arrangements divided by the number of rotations that preserve the gender alternation. But how many such rotations are there? For 2n seats, rotating by k seats preserves the gender alternation if and only if k is even. Because rotating by an odd number of seats would shift the gender pattern. Therefore, the number of rotations that preserve the gender alternation is n (rotating by 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2 seats). Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements is (2 *n! *n! ) /n = 2 * (n-1)! *n!.But for n=1, this gives 2 *0! *1!=2, which is wrong. For n=2, 2 *1! *2!=4, which matches manual count. For n=3, it would give 2 *2! *3!=24, which seems reasonable.But why does it fail for n=1? Because when n=1, there are two seats, and rotating by two seats brings you back to the original position. Therefore, the number of rotations preserving gender alternation is 2 (identity and rotation by 2 seats). Therefore, the number of circular arrangements would be (2 *1! *1!)/2=1, which matches. Wait, but according to the formula 2 * (n-1)! *n! for n=1 gives 2 *0! *1!=2, but if we use (2 *n! *n!)/number of preserving rotations, which is 2 for n=1, we get (2*1*1)/2=1.Therefore, the general formula is:Number of circular arrangements = (2 *n! *n! ) / number of rotations preserving gender alternation.The number of rotations preserving gender alternation is:For 2n seats, the rotations that preserve gender alternation are rotations by even numbers of seats. There are n such rotations (rotating by 0,2,4,...,2n-2 seats). However, rotating by 2n seats is the same as rotating by 0 seats.Wait, no. The number of rotations by even steps is n. Because each rotation by 2 seats increments the position by 2, so after n such rotations, you get back to the start. Therefore, the number of rotational symmetries preserving gender alternation is n.Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements is (2 *n! *n! ) /n =2 *n! *n! /n=2*(n-1)! *n!.But for n=1, this is 2*(0!)*1!=2, which is wrong, but for n&gt;=2, it works. However, when n=1, the number of preserving rotations is 2 (identity and rotation by 2 seats), which is equal to 2n/n=2. Wait, confusion.Wait, in general, for a circular arrangement with 2n seats and alternating genders, the rotational symmetries that preserve the gender alternation form a group of order n. Specifically, rotations by 0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1) seats. Therefore, the number of symmetries is n. Therefore, the number of circular arrangements is (linear arrangements)/n = (2 *n! *n! ) /n=2*(n-1)! *n!.For n=1, this gives 2*(0! *1!)=2*1*1=2. But in reality, there&#39;s only 1 arrangement. Therefore, the formula works for n&gt;=2 but not for n=1. But since the problem states &quot;n women and n men&quot;, which includes n=1, we need to adjust.However, perhaps the problem expects the general formula ignoring the n=1 case. In most combinatorial problems, such edge cases are considered, but perhaps here, the answer is intended to be 2*(n-1)! *n! for part b). Since for n&gt;=2, it works, and for n=1, even though it gives 2 instead of 1, maybe the problem assumes that rotations that result in the same gender pattern are considered the same, but with distinguishable people, they are not. Wait, but with n=1, the two arrangements MW and WM are different if the people are distinguishable, but in a circular table, they can be rotated into each other, hence considered the same. Therefore, the answer for n=1 should be 1, which is (n-1)! *n! =1. But according to the formula 2*(n-1)! *n!, it&#39;s 2.This suggests that the correct formula is actually (n-1)! *n! for part b). Let&#39;s see:For n=1: (1-1)! *1! =1, correct.For n=2: (2-1)! *2! =1*2=2, but manual count gives 4. Therefore, wrong.Therefore, there&#39;s a contradiction. Wait, what&#39;s the standard answer for this problem? I recall that the number of ways to seat n men and n women alternately around a circular table is 2*(n-1)! *n!.But why does that not match the manual count for n=2?Wait, maybe my manual count was wrong. Let me recount for n=2.Two men M1, M2 and two women W1, W2.In a circular table with four seats, we need to arrange them alternately.First, fix the position of M1. Then, the other man M2 is opposite M1. The women W1 and W2 are in the remaining two seats. The number of ways to arrange the women is 2! =2.Similarly, if we fix the position of W1, then the other woman W2 is opposite, and the men M1 and M2 are arranged in the remaining seats, giving 2! =2.But in circular arrangements, fixing a man or a woman should account for all possibilities. If we fix a man&#39;s seat, we get 2 arrangements. If we fix a woman&#39;s seat, another 2. But in reality, these are distinct arrangements because you can&#39;t rotate between them. Therefore, total is 4. But according to the formula 2*(n-1)! *n! =2*1*2=4, which matches. But according to the formula (n-1)! *n! =2, which doesn&#39;t match. Therefore, the correct formula must be 2*(n-1)! *n!.But for n=1, this formula gives 2*(0)!*1!=2, which contradicts the correct answer of 1. Therefore, the answer depends on whether n=1 is a special case or not. However, in combinatorics problems, usually the formula is valid for n&gt;=1, but in this case, n=1 seems to be an exception.Wait, but perhaps in the problem statement, the seats are labeled. The problem says &quot;around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. If the seats are labeled (i.e., distinguishable), then the number of arrangements would be the same as linear arrangements, because each seat is unique. But that contradicts the usual convention. If the seats are labeled, then the number of circular arrangements is the same as linear arrangements, which for part a) would be 2*n!*n! and part b) also 2*n!*n!. But the problem distinguishes between a) and b), so likely the seats are not labeled, and rotations are considered the same.Therefore, returning to the standard approach: For circular arrangements with alternating genders, the number is 2*(n-1)! *n! for n &gt;=1.However, when n=1, this formula counts both MW and WM as different, but in reality, in an unlabeled circular table, they are the same. Therefore, the formula overcounts for n=1. But maybe the problem assumes that the two arrangements are different, even for n=1. For example, if the table has labeled seats, then MW and WM are different. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify. This is ambiguous.However, given that part a) is in a single row, which is a labeled arrangement (each position is unique), and part b) is around a round table. In most combinatorics problems, unless specified otherwise, circular arrangements consider rotations as the same, but seatings are still considered different if they are reflections or have different people in the same relative positions. But in this case, with alternating genders, and the problem likely expects the answer to be 2*(n-1)! *n! for part b). Let&#39;s check a reference.According to some references, the number of ways to seat n men and n women alternately around a circular table is 2*(n-1)! *n!. This is because you can fix one man&#39;s seat to account for rotational symmetry, then arrange the remaining (n-1)! men and n! women. However, since you can also start with a woman, you multiply by 2. But wait, if you fix one man&#39;s seat, you already determine the positions of all men and women. Starting with a woman is a different arrangement, which can&#39;t be rotated to match the man-starting one. Therefore, the total number is 2*(n-1)! *n!.This formula works for n&gt;=1:For n=1: 2*(0)!*1!=2, but actual is 1. But if the problem considers MW and WM as different in a circular table (which they are if the table has an inherent orientation, like a clock face), then the answer is 2. However, if the table is unlabeled and rotations are considered the same, then MW and WM are the same, giving 1. The problem&#39;s wording is ambiguous, but in most mathematical contexts, circular arrangements consider rotations as the same but reflections as different. However, starting with a man or a woman are different even under rotation, as you can&#39;t rotate a man into a woman&#39;s position without breaking the alternation. Therefore, the answer is likely 2*(n-1)! *n!.Given that, even though n=1 seems contradictory, but assuming the problem allows for distinct starting genders, the answer for part b) is 2*(n-1)! *n!.But let&#39;s verify with another example. For n=3: 3 men and 3 women. The formula gives 2*(2!)*(3!)=2*2*6=24.If we fix a man&#39;s seat, arrange the other 2 men in 2! ways and the women in 3! ways, giving 2*6=12. Similarly, fixing a woman&#39;s seat gives another 12, total 24. This makes sense. So even for n=3, the formula holds.Therefore, despite the n=1 case seeming problematic, in combinatorial literature, the standard formula for the number of ways to arrange n men and n women alternately around a circular table is 2*(n-1)! *n!.Therefore, the answers are:a) In a single row: 2 *n! *n!.b) Around a round table: 2 * (n-1)! *n!.Therefore, boxed answers:a) boxed{2 cdot n! cdot n!}b) boxed{2 cdot (n-1)! cdot n!}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of ways to arrange ( n ) women and ( n ) men such that no two neighbors are of the same gender: Part a) In a single row1. Alternating Genders: The arrangement must alternate between men and women. The first position can be either a man or a woman, giving 2 possibilities.2. Arrangements: For each starting gender, the ( n ) men can be arranged in ( n! ) ways and the ( n ) women can be arranged in ( n! ) ways.3. Total Arrangements: Multiply the number of starting choices by the permutations of men and women:   [   2 cdot n! cdot n!   ] Part b) Around a round table1. Fixing Rotational Symmetry: In circular arrangements, fixing one person&#39;s position removes rotational symmetry. Fixing a man&#39;s position determines the gender alternation for the entire table.2. Arrangements: The remaining ( n-1 ) men can be arranged in ( (n-1)! ) ways, and the ( n ) women can be arranged in ( n! ) ways.3. Starting Gender Choice: Since starting with a man or a woman are distinct and cannot be rotated into each other, multiply by 2:   [   2 cdot (n-1)! cdot n!   ] Final Answersa) In a single row: (boxed{2 cdot n! cdot n!})b) Around a round table: (boxed{2 cdot (n-1)! cdot n!}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out these two problems. So, first part (a) is about arranging n women and n men in a single row such that no two neighbors are of the same gender. Part (b) is the same but around a round table with 2n seats. Hmm, permutations with restrictions. Let me start with part (a).For part (a), arranging them in a row. The condition is that no two people of the same gender are adjacent. So, we need to alternate between men and women. Since it&#39;s a row, the arrangement can start with either a man or a woman. Wait, but if we have n men and n women, starting with a man would require the next to be a woman, then a man, and so on. Similarly, starting with a woman would alternate woman, man, woman, etc. But let me check if both are possible. If n is equal to the number of men and women, then starting with a man would end with a man if the number of seats is even? Wait, the total number of seats is 2n. So starting with a man, the positions would be man in positions 1, 3, ..., 2n-1, so n positions. Similarly, starting with a woman, women would be in positions 1, 3, ..., 2n-1. But since we have n men and n women, both arrangements are possible if n is the same for both. So, the number of ways should be 2 (for starting with man or woman) multiplied by the permutations of men and women in their respective positions.Wait, let me formalize that. If we start with a man, then the men are in positions 1,3,...,2n-1, and women in 2,4,...,2n. The number of ways to arrange the men is n! and the number of ways to arrange the women is n!. Similarly, if we start with a woman, then women are in odd positions and men in even positions, so again n! * n!. So total arrangements would be 2 * n! * n!.Is that right? Let me test with a small n. Let&#39;s say n=1: 1 man and 1 woman. Then possible arrangements are M W and W M, so 2. Which is 2*1!*1! = 2. Correct. For n=2: 2 men (M1, M2) and 2 women (W1, W2). Starting with man: M1, W1, M2, W2; M1, W2, M2, W1; M2, W1, M1, W2; M2, W2, M1, W1. So 2! * 2! =4, and starting with woman similarly gives another 4, total 8. Let&#39;s count manually:Starting with man:M1, W1, M2, W2M1, W2, M2, W1M2, W1, M1, W2M2, W2, M1, W1Starting with woman:W1, M1, W2, M2W1, M2, W2, M1W2, M1, W1, M2W2, M2, W1, M1Total 8, which is 2*2!*2! =8. Correct. So that seems to work. So part (a) answer is 2*(n!)^2.Now part (b), around a round table with 2n seats. Circular arrangements. The difference here is that rotations are considered the same. But wait, in circular permutations, arrangements are considered equivalent if they can be rotated into each other. But in this problem, are we considering rotations as distinct or not? Wait, the question says &quot;arranged around a round table with 2n seats.&quot; Usually, in such problems, unless specified, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same. But let me check the exact wording: &quot;in how many different ways can n women and n men be arranged so that no two neighbors are of the same gender&quot;. So, since seats are distinct (as there are 2n seats), probably each seat is a fixed position, so rotations would be different. Wait, but sometimes in circular arrangements, if seats are not labeled, then it&#39;s considered the same arrangement if you rotate. But here, since it&#39;s a table with seats, maybe seats are distinguishable. Hmm. Wait, the problem is ambiguous, but in combinatorics, unless specified, when arranging around a round table, we usually fix one position to account for rotational symmetry. But let me think.Wait, let&#39;s recall that for circular arrangements of people, the number is (number of linear arrangements)/number of rotations. But in this case, if the seats are labeled, then it&#39;s the same as linear arrangements. But if not labeled, it&#39;s different. However, the problem says &quot;around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. It might mean that the seats are arranged in a circle but are indistinct except for their position relative to each other. Therefore, usually, in circular arrangements, we fix one person&#39;s position to avoid counting rotations as distinct. But in this problem, since the seats are 2n, which is even, and the genders must alternate, the key is that after fixing a position, the rest can be arranged accordingly.But let me think again. If we fix one seat as a reference point, say seat 1, then the arrangement is determined by the gender in seat 1 and then the alternation. So, for a circular table, if we fix the gender of the first seat, then the rest are determined. But wait, in a circular arrangement, if you fix seat 1 to be a man, then seat 2 must be a woman, seat 3 a man, etc., but seat 2n must be a woman, which would need seat 1 (next to seat 2n) to be a man. So that works. Similarly, if seat 1 is a woman, seat 2 is a man, etc. But in a circular arrangement, if you fix the gender of one seat, the entire arrangement&#39;s genders are determined. So, in this case, since the genders must alternate, there are only 2 possibilities for the entire gender arrangement: starting with man or woman. But in circular arrangements, starting with man or woman can be considered the same if you can rotate. Wait, but if you fix one seat, say seat 1, then the two possibilities are seat 1 is a man or seat 1 is a woman. However, if seat 1 is a man, then seat 2 must be a woman, seat 3 a man, etc. But since it&#39;s a circle, seat 2n is next to seat 1. So seat 2n must be a woman. Therefore, in circular arrangements with alternating genders, the number of distinct gender arrangements is 2, but considering rotations. Wait, but if we fix one person&#39;s seat, then the number is different.Wait, perhaps the key difference between linear and circular arrangements here is that in circular arrangements, the two possibilities (starting with man or woman) are actually distinct only if we fix a position. Otherwise, they are rotations of each other. Wait, no. For example, if you have a circular arrangement where genders alternate, starting with man or woman would actually result in different arrangements because you can&#39;t rotate a man into a woman&#39;s position. Since all the men and women are distinct people, rotating the arrangement would change who is sitting where. So if the seats are fixed (i.e., labeled from 1 to 2n around the table), then rotating the arrangement would result in a different arrangement. But if the seats are not labeled, then it&#39;s considered the same arrangement. But the problem states &quot;arranged around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify whether the seats are labeled or not. Hmm.In most combinatorial problems, unless specified otherwise, arrangements around a round table consider rotations as the same arrangement. Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements is less than the number of linear arrangements by a factor of the number of seats (since you can rotate). However, in this case, since the people are distinguishable, maybe the seats are considered labeled. Wait, no. If the seats are labeled, then it&#39;s equivalent to a linear arrangement with the first and last seats adjacent. But in the problem statement, part (a) is a single row, which is linear, and part (b) is a round table, which is circular. The key difference is that in a circular arrangement, the first and last elements are adjacent, so the condition applies there as well. So, in the circular case, not only do we have to alternate genders around the table, but also the first and last person (seated next to each other) must be of different genders.But in terms of counting, how does this affect the number? Let&#39;s think.First, in the linear case, we have two possibilities: starting with M or W, leading to 2*(n!)^2 arrangements.In the circular case, if we fix one person&#39;s position to account for rotational symmetry, then the number of arrangements would be different. However, in this problem, since the seats are arranged in a circle, and we need to seat people so that no two neighbors are the same gender, including the first and last person. So, similar to the linear case but with the added condition that the first and last are also different. In the linear case, starting and ending with different genders isn&#39;t required, but in the circular case, it is.Wait, but in the linear case with 2n seats, starting with a man ends with a woman if n is even? Wait, no. Wait, in a linear arrangement, if you start with a man, then the sequence is M, W, M, W,..., alternating. So if there are 2n seats, which is even, then the last seat (2n) would be a woman if starting with a man, and a man if starting with a woman. Therefore, in the linear case, the first and last are different. Wait, but in the problem statement for part (a), is there any condition on the first and last? No, the condition is just that no two neighbors are of the same gender. So in a linear arrangement, neighbors are adjacent seats, so seat 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ..., 2n-1 and 2n. The first and last seats (1 and 2n) are not neighbors, so their genders don&#39;t matter. Wait, but in the linear case, starting with a man will end with a woman (since 2n is even), so first is man, last is woman. Starting with a woman, first is woman, last is man. Therefore, in the linear case, the first and last are different. Wait, but in the problem statement, is that a requirement? The problem says &quot;no two neighbors are of the same gender&quot;. Since in the linear case, the first and last are not neighbors, their genders can be same or different? Wait, but in the way we arranged them (alternating), they are different. Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another way to arrange them where the genders alternate but start and end with the same gender. But with equal numbers of men and women, n each. If you have 2n seats, starting with a man, you need n men and n women. But if you start and end with a man, that would require n+1 men and n women, which is impossible. Similarly for starting and ending with a woman. Therefore, in a linear arrangement with equal numbers of men and women, the only way to alternate is to start and end with different genders. Therefore, in the linear case, the first and last must be different. So, actually, in the linear case, you have two possibilities: starting with man or woman, but both result in the last seat being the opposite gender. Therefore, in the circular case, since the first and last are neighbors, we have to ensure they are different. But since in the linear case, they are already different, so when we make it circular, it&#39;s already satisfied. Wait, but in a circular arrangement, if you take the linear arrangement where the first and last are different, and connect them, then it&#39;s a valid circular arrangement. However, in circular arrangements, rotations are considered the same. Wait, but if we fix the position of one person to account for rotational symmetry, then we can avoid overcounting.Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#39;s approach it step by step.In circular arrangements, if we consider seats as unlabeled (i.e., rotations are equivalent), then the number of distinct arrangements is calculated by fixing one person&#39;s position. But here, since all people are distinct, and we need to count labeled seatings (i.e., each seat is a distinct position), then the number would be similar to linear arrangements divided by 2n (because of rotational symmetry). But wait, no. If the seats are labeled, then each arrangement is unique regardless of rotation, so it&#39;s the same as a linear arrangement but with the first and last seats adjacent. Therefore, in such a case, the number of circular arrangements would be equal to the number of linear arrangements where the first and last elements are different, divided by 1 (since rotations aren&#39;t considered the same). Wait, but that might not be the case.Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to model it directly.In the circular case, we need to arrange n men and n women around a table with 2n seats, such that no two adjacent people are of the same gender, including the first and last (since it&#39;s a circle). So, similar to the linear case, but with the added adjacency between the first and last seat.However, in the linear case, as we saw, with equal numbers of men and women, the first and last seats are necessarily different. Therefore, when we connect the ends to form a circle, the adjacency between first and last is already satisfied. Therefore, all linear arrangements that satisfy the alternating condition can be converted into circular arrangements. However, in circular arrangements, rotations are considered different if the seats are labeled. But if the seats are not labeled, then rotations are considered the same.But the problem says &quot;around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. It&#39;s ambiguous whether seats are labeled or not. In most combinatorial problems like this, unless specified, it&#39;s assumed that arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same. Therefore, we need to adjust for rotational symmetry.So, if that&#39;s the case, then the number of circular arrangements would be the number of linear arrangements divided by 2n (the number of rotations). However, in our case, the linear arrangements have a specific pattern (alternating genders). Each circular arrangement corresponds to 2n linear arrangements (since we can rotate the circle in 2n ways). However, in the linear case, the two possibilities (starting with man or woman) are distinct, but in the circular case, starting with man or woman might be equivalent under rotation. Wait, no. Because if you fix the gender at a position, rotations cannot change the gender pattern. For example, if we have a circular arrangement starting with a man, rotating it will still have a man in some position, but the pattern remains the same. However, if we have a circular arrangement where genders alternate, then the two possible gender patterns (clockwise: M, W, M, W,... or W, M, W, M,...) are distinct because you cannot rotate one into the other. Therefore, in the circular case, fixing one seat&#39;s gender accounts for the rotational symmetry. So, the number of distinct circular arrangements would be: fix one person&#39;s seat (to account for rotation), say fix a man in seat 1, then the rest of the seats are determined in gender (alternating W, M, W,...). Then, the number of ways to arrange the men and women would be (n-1)! * n! (since one man is fixed, and the rest can be permuted, and the women can be permuted freely). Similarly, if we fix a woman in seat 1, we get the same number. But wait, but since the gender alternates, fixing a man in seat 1 determines all the genders, so fixing a woman would give the other gender pattern. However, in circular arrangements, these two patterns are distinct (since you cannot rotate a male-female alternation into a female-male alternation). Therefore, the total number would be 2 * (n-1)! * n!.Wait, let me explain. If we fix one man in seat 1 to account for rotational symmetry (so we don&#39;t count rotations as different), then the remaining (n-1) men can be arranged in the other male seats (which are seats 3,5,...,2n-1) in (n-1)! ways, and the women can be arranged in the female seats (seats 2,4,...,2n) in n! ways. Similarly, if we fix a woman in seat 1, then the women are arranged in seats 1,3,...,2n-1 and men in even seats. However, in a circular arrangement, fixing a man or a woman in seat 1 are two distinct scenarios, so we need to consider both. But wait, if we fix a man in seat 1 to account for rotational symmetry, then we already have determined the gender pattern as starting with a man. Similarly, if we fix a woman, but since rotations are considered the same, we cannot fix both. Wait, no. When we fix a person in a seat to account for rotational symmetry, we can choose any person. However, if we fix a man in seat 1, then the gender pattern is fixed. If we fix a woman in seat 1, that&#39;s a different gender pattern. Therefore, to account for both possibilities, we need to multiply by 2. Wait, but if we fix a specific person (say, a particular man) in seat 1, then the number of arrangements is (n-1)! * n!. Similarly, if we fix a particular woman in seat 1, it&#39;s (n-1)! * n!. Therefore, the total number would be 2 * (n-1)! * n!.But let&#39;s verify with small n. For n=1: 1 man and 1 woman around a table with 2 seats. If we fix the man in seat 1, the woman is in seat 2. But since it&#39;s a circular table, rotating it would swap seat 1 and 2, but if we&#39;ve fixed the man in seat 1, then there&#39;s only 1 arrangement. However, if we don&#39;t fix anyone, the number of circular arrangements would be 1 (since M W and W M are considered the same when rotated). Wait, but in reality, with two people around a table, there&#39;s only 1 arrangement if rotations are considered the same, but 2 if seats are labeled. So for n=1, if seats are labeled, it&#39;s 2 arrangements, same as linear. If seats are not labeled, it&#39;s 1. The problem says &quot;around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. It might be safer to assume that seats are labeled (since it&#39;s specified as 2n seats), but in combinatorics problems, when it&#39;s a round table, sometimes they consider rotations as the same. Hmm. Wait, the problem says &quot;arranged around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. The term &quot;arranged&quot; usually considers seatings where rotations are different. So if there are 2n seats, each seat is distinct, so the number of arrangements would be similar to linear arrangements but divided by 2n (if rotations are considered the same). Wait, no. If the seats are fixed (i.e., labeled), then the number is the same as linear arrangements, but with the added adjacency between first and last. But in our linear case, first and last are already different, so when we form a circle, it&#39;s valid. Therefore, the number of circular arrangements would be equal to the number of linear arrangements where the first and last are different, divided by 1 (since seats are labeled). Wait, but that can&#39;t be.Wait, confusion arises from whether the seats are labeled or not. Let me clarify:- If the seats are labeled (i.e., each seat is distinct, like seat 1, seat 2, etc.), then the number of arrangements around a round table is the same as in a straight line, but with the additional condition that the first and last elements are adjacent. However, in our problem, since in the linear case, the first and last are already different (because we have equal numbers of men and women), the number of circular arrangements would be the same as linear arrangements. But that can&#39;t be, because in the circular case, rotating the entire arrangement would lead to a different labeling but the same relative positions. However, if the seats are labeled, rotations are different arrangements. Therefore, the number is the same as the linear case. But that contradicts the usual circular permutation logic.Wait, let&#39;s take n=1 again. If seats are labeled, then around a table with 2 seats, there are 2 arrangements: M in seat1, W in seat2; or W in seat1, M in seat2. Which is the same as linear. But if seats are not labeled, then there&#39;s only 1 arrangement. But the problem mentions &quot;2n seats&quot;, which might imply they are distinguishable. So maybe we should treat them as labeled, so the answer is the same as linear? But that can&#39;t be right. Wait, but in circular arrangements, even if seats are labeled, the number is the same as linear because each seat is unique. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, part (b) is the same as part (a), but with the condition that the first and last are adjacent. But in our linear case, the first and last are already different, so arranging them in a circle would just maintain that adjacency. Therefore, the number of circular arrangements would be the same as linear arrangements. But that can&#39;t be, since in circular arrangements, we usually have fewer arrangements due to rotational symmetry, but here if seats are labeled, rotations are different. Therefore, the answer for part (b) might also be 2*(n!)^2. But that seems incorrect.Wait, let&#39;s think again. For circular arrangements with labeled seats, the number is the same as linear arrangements because each seat is distinct. Therefore, the answer would be the same as part (a): 2*(n!)^2. But that doesn&#39;t account for the circular adjacency. Wait, but in the linear case, the adjacency is only between consecutive seats, and in the circular case, we have an additional adjacency between seat 2n and seat 1. However, in our linear arrangements, we already have that the first and last seats are different (since starting with M ends with W and vice versa), so this adjacency is satisfied. Therefore, all linear arrangements that satisfy the alternating condition also satisfy the circular adjacency condition. Therefore, if the seats are labeled, the number of circular arrangements is the same as the number of linear arrangements: 2*(n!)^2. But that doesn&#39;t seem right.Wait, but consider n=2. In the linear case, we have 8 arrangements. If we arrange them around a table with labeled seats, then yes, each of those 8 linear arrangements corresponds to a circular arrangement where seat 4 is adjacent to seat 1. Since in all linear arrangements, seat 1 and seat 4 are different, they all satisfy the circular condition. Therefore, the answer for part (b) is also 2*(n!)^2. But in most combinatorial problems, circular arrangements with labeled seats are treated the same as linear arrangements. However, some problems consider rotations as equivalent, but here, since the seats are part of a table with 2n seats, they might be considered labeled. Therefore, the answer might actually be the same as part (a). But I have a feeling that this is not the case. Wait, let&#39;s check an example.For n=2, linear arrangements: 8. Circular arrangements with labeled seats: also 8, because each seat is distinct. Therefore, the number is the same. But in other problems, circular arrangements with unlabeled seats would have fewer, but here, if seats are labeled, it&#39;s the same. But the problem didn&#39;t specify whether seats are labeled or not. Hmm. The problem says &quot;arranged around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. If the seats are indistinct, then the number would be different. But usually, when the number of seats is given, they are considered distinct. Therefore, part (b) answer is the same as part (a): 2*(n!)^2. But that contradicts my initial intuition.Wait, but let&#39;s think differently. In circular permutations, when arranging n distinct people around a table, it&#39;s (n-1)! if rotations are considered equivalent. But here, we have two groups: men and women. So, maybe fixing the gender at one position to account for rotational symmetry. For example, fix a man at seat 1, then the rest of the men can be arranged in (n-1)! ways and women in n! ways. Similarly, fixing a woman at seat 1, the rest can be arranged in (n-1)! * n! ways. So total is 2*(n-1)!*n!.Wait, that makes sense. Because if we fix one seat&#39;s gender, we eliminate rotational symmetry. Let me test this with n=1. Fixing a man at seat1, then the woman is at seat2. So 1 way. Similarly, fixing a woman at seat1, the man is at seat2. So total 2 arrangements. Which matches the linear case. But wait, if seats are labeled, why does fixing a gender matter? Because if you fix a specific person, say man1 at seat1, then the rest can be arranged. But if we fix any man at seat1, it&#39;s (n-1)! *n!.Wait, no. Let me clarify. If we consider the circular table with unlabeled seats (rotations equivalent), then fixing a man&#39;s position at one seat accounts for rotational symmetry, leading to (n-1)! *n! arrangements. But if the seats are labeled, then we don&#39;t need to fix a position, so the number is 2*n!*n!.But the problem states &quot;around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. The key is whether the seats are labeled or not. Since the problem doesn&#39;t mention rotations being considered the same, and since it specifically mentions 2n seats, it&#39;s more likely that the seats are labeled. Therefore, the answer should be the same as the linear case: 2*(n!)^2. But let&#39;s check with n=2. If seats are labeled, then circular arrangements are the same as linear, so 8. If seats are unlabeled, then fixing a man at seat1, the rest can be arranged in (2-1)! *2! =1*2=2. Then total with fixing man or woman would be 2*2=4. Which is different. But for n=2, if seats are unlabeled, there are 4 distinct circular arrangements. But in reality, if the table is unlabeled, rotating the arrangement doesn&#39;t change it. However, the problem says &quot;arranged around a round table with 2n seats&quot;, which implies that each seat is a distinct entity (since there are 2n of them), so likely labeled. Therefore, the answer should be the same as part (a): 2*(n!)^2. But I&#39;m conflicting with standard circular permutation logic.Wait, let me recall that in circular permutations where all seats are labeled, the number is the same as linear permutations. Because each seat is a distinct position. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange people is the same as in a line. However, when seats are unlabeled, we divide by the number of rotations. So, if the problem considers the seats as labeled (distinct positions), then part (b) answer is same as part (a). If seats are unlabeled, then it&#39;s different.But the problem statement says: &quot;around a round table with 2n seats&quot;. The mention of &quot;2n seats&quot; suggests that the number is specified, but doesn&#39;t necessarily imply they are labeled. However, in combinatorial problems, unless specified that rotations are considered the same, when arranging people around a table with seats, it&#39;s usually assumed that the seats are distinguishable (i.e., labeled). For example, if you have a round table with numbered seats, the number of arrangements is the same as in a straight line. But if the table has no numbers, it&#39;s considered rotations are the same.But the problem doesn&#39;t specify whether the seats are labeled or not. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given that part (a) is about a single row, which inherently has a start and end, and part (b) is about a round table, which is cyclical, but both have 2n seats. Since the problem is from a mathematics competition or textbook, it&#39;s more likely that in part (b), we need to consider rotational symmetry. Therefore, the answer should account for circular permutations by dividing by the number of seats, but given the gender alternation, which complicates things.Wait, let&#39;s think in terms of circular permutations with rotational symmetry. For arrangements where no two adjacent people are the same gender, and considering rotations as equivalent.In such cases, the number of distinct arrangements is calculated by fixing the position of one person to eliminate rotational symmetry. For example, fix a man at position 1. Then, the rest of the men can be arranged in (n-1)! ways and the women in n! ways. Since the pattern must alternate, fixing a man at position 1 forces position 2 to be a woman, position 3 a man, etc. Similarly, if we fix a woman at position 1, we get another (n-1)! *n! arrangements. Therefore, total is 2*(n-1)!*n!.Let&#39;s verify with n=2. Then total arrangements would be 2*(1!)*(2!)=4. Let&#39;s list them. Fixing M1 at seat1:Seat1: M1Seat2: W1 or W2Seat3: M2Seat4: the remaining woman.So arrangements:1. M1, W1, M2, W22. M1, W2, M2, W1Similarly, fixing W1 at seat1:1. W1, M1, W2, M22. W1, M2, W2, M1Total 4 arrangements. If seats are unlabeled, these are the only distinct arrangements. However, if seats are labeled, each of these corresponds to multiple labeled arrangements. Wait, no. If we fix seat1 as M1, then the rest are determined by their positions. But if seats are labeled, fixing M1 at seat1 is just one specific arrangement. Wait, no, I&#39;m getting confused again.Wait, in circular arrangements where rotations are considered the same, fixing a person&#39;s position effectively accounts for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is (number of linear arrangements)/number of seats. But in our case, the linear arrangements are 2*(n!)^2. If we consider rotations as equivalent, then the number of circular arrangements would be 2*(n!)^2 / 2n = (n!)^2 /n = n!*(n-1)!.Wait, that formula gives for circular arrangements: (2*(n!)^2)/(2n) = (n!)^2 /n = n!*(n-1)!.But earlier, by fixing a man&#39;s position, we had 2*(n-1)!*n!.Wait, this is inconsistent. Let&#39;s check with n=2:2*(n-1)!*n! =2*1!*2!=4.(n!)^2 /n = (2!)^2 /2=4/2=2.But we know that for n=2, if rotations are considered the same, there should be 2 distinct arrangements: one starting with man and one starting with woman. But each of these can be rotated in 2n ways. Wait, no. Wait, if we have a circular arrangement with alternating genders, the number of rotational symmetries that preserve the gender pattern is n. Because you can rotate by 2 seats (since it&#39;s a 4-seat table for n=2) and get the same arrangement. Wait, no, rotating by 2 seats would swap men and women. For example, in a 4-seat table: M, W, M, W. Rotating by 2 seats would give M, W, M, W again? No, rotating by 1 seat: W, M, W, M. Which is different. Rotating by 2 seats: M, W, M, W again. Wait, no. Original: seats 1:M, 2:W, 3:M, 4:W. Rotating by 1 seat clockwise: seats 1:W, 2:M, 3:W, 4:M. Which is different. Rotating by 2 seats: seats 1:M, 2:W, 3:M, 4:W. Same as original. Wait, no. If you rotate by 2 seats, seat1 becomes seat3, which is M. So arrangement becomes seat1:M, seat2:W, seat3:M, seat4:W. Which is the same as original. Therefore, the rotation by 2 seats gives the same arrangement. Therefore, the number of distinct rotations is 2 (rotating by 0 or 2 seats). Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements considering rotation is total linear arrangements divided by 2. For n=2, linear arrangements are 8. 8 divided by 2 is 4. But we thought there should be 2. This is conflicting.Actually, the automorphism group (rotational symmetries) for a circular arrangement with alternating colors is of order 2n. Wait, but in our case, the gender alternation breaks some symmetries. For example, in a 4-seat table with alternating genders, the rotations that preserve the gender arrangement are only rotations by even numbers of seats. So for n=2, rotating by 2 seats preserves the arrangement, but rotating by 1 or 3 seats flips the genders. Therefore, the number of distinct rotations that preserve the gender pattern is 2 (rotating by 0 or 2 seats). Therefore, the number of distinct circular arrangements considering rotation is total linear arrangements divided by 2. For n=2, 8/2=4, which matches our previous count. But this seems to contradict the idea that fixing a position gives 2*(n-1)!*n!.Wait, I think the key is that when considering rotational symmetry, the number of distinct arrangements is equal to the number of linear arrangements divided by the number of rotations that preserve the gender alternation. However, this is getting too complex. Let&#39;s refer back to standard references.In standard combinatorics, the number of ways to seat n men and n women alternately around a circular table is 2*(n-1)!*n!. The reasoning is:1. Fix a man&#39;s position to account for rotational symmetry. This can be done in 1 way (since rotations are equivalent).2. Arrange the remaining (n-1) men in (n-1)! ways.3. Arrange the n women in n! ways.4. Since the arrangement could also start with a woman, multiply by 2.Hence, total arrangements: 2*(n-1)!*n!.This formula is derived under the assumption that rotations are considered the same arrangement. Therefore, if the problem considers rotations as equivalent, the answer is 2*(n-1)!*n!.If the problem considers rotations as distinct (i.e., labeled seats), then the answer is the same as the linear case: 2*(n!)^2.Given that part (a) is a single row and part (b) is a round table, and the problem is likely testing knowledge of circular permutations accounting for rotational symmetry, the answer for part (b) should be 2*(n-1)!*n!.Let&#39;s verify with n=2:2*(1!)*(2!) =4. Which matches our previous count when considering rotations as equivalent. If seats are labeled, it&#39;s 8, but if not, it&#39;s 4. Since the problem says &quot;around a round table&quot;, the standard answer would be 2*(n-1)!*n!.Therefore, part (a) is 2*(n!)^2 and part (b) is 2*(n!)*(n-1)! = 2*n!*(n-1)!.But wait, 2*(n-1)!*n! = 2*(n!)*(n-1)! = 2*n!*(n-1)!.Yes, that&#39;s correct. So final answers:a) 2*(n!)^2b) 2*n!*(n-1)! = 2*(n-1)!*n!Let me confirm with another example. For n=3.Part (a): 2*(3!)^2=2*36=72.Part (b): 2*(2!)*(3!)=2*2*6=24.If we consider circular arrangements with rotational symmetry, for n=3, fixing a man&#39;s position, then the remaining 2 men can be arranged in 2! ways and women in 3! ways, total 2!*3!=12. Multiply by 2 for starting with woman: 24. Yes. If seats are labeled, it would be 72. But since it&#39;s a round table, likely 24 is the answer.Therefore, the answers are:a) boxed{2 times n! times n!}b) boxed{2 times n! times (n-1)!}Final Answera) boxed{2(n!)^2}b) boxed{2n!(n-1)!}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of arranging ( n ) women and ( n ) men such that no two neighbors are of the same gender, we consider both linear and circular arrangements. Part (a): Arrangement in a Single Row1. Alternating Genders: In a single row, the arrangement must alternate between men and women. We can start with either a man or a woman.2. Permutations: For each starting gender, the men can be arranged in ( n! ) ways and the women can be arranged in ( n! ) ways.3. Total Arrangements: Since there are two possible starting genders, the total number of arrangements is ( 2 times n! times n! ).Thus, the number of ways to arrange ( n ) women and ( n ) men in a single row is:[boxed{2(n!)^2}] Part (b): Arrangement around a Round Table1. Circular Arrangement: For a circular table, we need to account for rotational symmetry. Fixing the position of one person (either a man or a woman) removes rotational equivalence.2. Permutations: Fixing one person&#39;s position (e.g., a man), the remaining ( n-1 ) men can be arranged in ( (n-1)! ) ways and the ( n ) women can be arranged in ( n! ) ways. Similarly, if we start with a woman, the same logic applies.3. Total Arrangements: Since we can start with either a man or a woman, we multiply by 2, leading to ( 2 times (n-1)! times n! ).Thus, the number of ways to arrange ( n ) women and ( n ) men around a round table is:[boxed{2n!(n-1)!}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🔑:</span>Solution.

The problem is asking about the order of three numbers: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, and ln 0.3. The options are A, B, C, D with different sequences. I need to figure out which one is correct. Hmm, let me start by analyzing each number individually.First, ln 0.3. The natural logarithm of a number less than 1 is negative. Since 0.3 is less than 1, ln 0.3 must be negative. I remember that ln 1 is 0, and as the input decreases below 1, the natural logarithm becomes negative. So ln 0.3 is definitely a negative number. Let me check approximately what value it is. Maybe around... I know that ln 0.5 is approximately -0.693, and ln 0.3 is less than that. Maybe around -1.2 or something? Wait, let me recall that e^(-1) is about 0.367, which is a bit higher than 0.3, so ln 0.3 is slightly less than -1. Maybe closer to -1.2. But exact value might not be necessary here; just knowing it&#39;s negative is enough for comparison.Next, 0.3^7. Since 0.3 is a positive number less than 1, raising it to a higher power will make it smaller. For example, 0.3^2 is 0.09, 0.3^3 is 0.027, and so on. So 0.3^7 must be a very small positive number. Let me calculate it step by step. 0.3^2 = 0.09, 0.3^3 = 0.027, 0.3^4 = 0.0081, 0.3^5 = 0.00243, 0.3^6 ≈ 0.000729, 0.3^7 ≈ 0.0002187. So approximately 0.0002187. So that&#39;s a small positive number, close to zero.Then, 7^{0.3}. That&#39;s an exponential expression. Since 7 is greater than 1, and the exponent is positive (0.3 is positive), 7^{0.3} will be greater than 1. Let me approximate its value. Remember that 7^{0.3} is the same as e^{0.3 ln 7}. Let&#39;s compute ln 7 first. I know ln 2 ≈ 0.693, ln 3 ≈ 1.098, so ln 7, since 7 is a prime number, maybe around 1.9459? Let me confirm: ln 7 is approximately 1.945910. So 0.3 times ln 7 is approximately 0.3 * 1.9459 ≈ 0.58377. Then e^{0.58377}. e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.6 is approximately 1.8221. So e^0.58377 would be between 1.79 and 1.82. Let me compute it more accurately. Let&#39;s use the Taylor series approximation around x=0.5.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s easier to use logarithm tables or approximate exponents. Wait, alternatively, 7^{0.3}. Let me think of 7^(1/3) which is the cube root of 7, which is approximately 1.913. 0.3 is close to 0.333, which is 1/3, but a bit less. So 7^{0.3} should be a bit less than 7^{1/3} ≈ 1.913. Let&#39;s say maybe around 1.8? Let me check with a calculator-style approach.If we take natural log of 7^{0.3} = 0.3 * ln7 ≈ 0.3 * 1.9459 ≈ 0.58377. Then exponentiate:e^0.58377. Let&#39;s compute that. Let&#39;s break it down into e^0.5 * e^0.08377. e^0.5 is approximately 1.6487. e^0.08377: since e^0.08 ≈ 1.0833, and e^0.00377 ≈ 1.00377. So approximately 1.0833 * 1.00377 ≈ 1.0873. So multiplying by e^0.5: 1.6487 * 1.0873 ≈ 1.6487 * 1 + 1.6487 * 0.0873 ≈ 1.6487 + 0.144 ≈ 1.7927. So approximately 1.793. So 7^{0.3} is roughly 1.79. So that&#39;s a number a little under 2, positive.So, putting it all together:- ln 0.3 is negative, approximately -1.2- 0.3^7 is a small positive number, approximately 0.0002187- 7^{0.3} is approximately 1.79, positive and greater than 1.Therefore, ordering from smallest to largest would be ln 0.3 (negative), then 0.3^7 (small positive), then 7^{0.3} (larger positive). Wait, but the options are given in sequences. Let me check the options again.Options:A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3B: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^7C: 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}, ln0.3D: ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7Wait, hold on. The order is presented as three numbers in sequence. The question is &quot;the order of the three numbers&quot;, so from largest to smallest? Or from smallest to largest? Wait, the options are written as sequences. Let me check.The problem statement says: &quot;The order of the three numbers 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}, ln0.3 is (   )&quot; followed by the options. In Chinese math problems, when they mention the &quot;order&quot; of numbers, it usually refers from the largest to the smallest. So we need to arrange them in descending order. Let&#39;s verify.Given that 7^{0.3} is the largest, then 0.3^7 is positive but small, and ln0.3 is negative, so the order from largest to smallest would be 7^{0.3} &gt; 0.3^7 &gt; ln0.3. But let me check the options:A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3 — that would be descending order.B: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^7 — which would place the negative number in the middle, which is incorrect.C: 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}, ln0.3 — ascending order, but starting with 0.3^7, then 7^{0.3}, then ln0.3 — which is not correct.D: ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7 — starting with the negative, then the largest, then the small positive. That would be ascending order, but with the middle term being the largest, which is incorrect.Wait, maybe the problem is not clear on whether it&#39;s ascending or descending. Wait, the problem statement in Chinese might have a standard way of presenting order. Wait, since the options are written as sequences, it&#39;s possible that the order is from the smallest to the largest. Let me verify.Wait, for example, if it&#39;s ascending order (smallest to largest), then ln0.3 is the smallest (negative), then 0.3^7 (small positive), then 7^{0.3} (larger positive). So the order would be ln0.3 &lt; 0.3^7 &lt; 7^{0.3}. So ascending order is ln0.3, 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}. But looking at the options:A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3 — descending orderB: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^7 — incorrect orderC: 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}, ln0.3 — incorrectD: ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7 — incorrectWait, none of the options C or D match the ascending order. Wait, hold on. If the correct ascending order is ln0.3 &lt; 0.3^7 &lt; 7^{0.3}, then the order from smallest to largest is ln0.3, 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}, which is not one of the options. The options are:A: 7, 0.3^7, lnB: 7, ln, 0.3^7C: 0.3^7, 7, lnD: ln, 7, 0.3^7So the correct ascending order would be D if it were ln, 0.3^7, 7. But D is ln, 7, 0.3^7. So that&#39;s incorrect.Similarly, if the problem is asking for descending order (from largest to smallest), the order would be 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3, which is option A. But let me confirm once again.Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the options again:A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}, ln0.3B: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^{7}C: 0.3^{7}, 7^{0.3}, ln0.3D: ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}So the problem is asking for &quot;the order&quot; of the three numbers, without specifying ascending or descending. But usually in such multiple-choice questions, when they list the order without specifying, it&#39;s from largest to smallest. So the correct order should be 7^{0.3} (which is the largest), then 0.3^7 (small positive), then ln0.3 (negative). So that&#39;s option A.But wait, hold on. Wait, 0.3^7 is a positive number, very small, but positive, while ln0.3 is negative. Therefore, 0.3^7 is larger than ln0.3. So in descending order, it should be 7^{0.3} first, then 0.3^7, then ln0.3. So option A.But let me check the options again. A is 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3. That&#39;s correct.But let me check once again to avoid mistakes.- 7^{0.3} ≈ 1.79- 0.3^7 ≈ 0.0002187- ln0.3 ≈ -1.2039So ordering them from largest to smallest: 1.79, 0.0002187, -1.2039. So that&#39;s 7^{0.3} &gt; 0.3^7 &gt; ln0.3. Hence, the order is A.But why is there an option D? Maybe someone could confuse ascending order. Wait, if someone arranges from smallest to largest, it would be ln0.3, 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}, which is not an option. The closest is D: ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, which is incorrect because 0.3^7 is smaller than 7^{0.3}, but 0.3^7 is positive and ln0.3 is negative. So ln0.3 is the smallest, then 0.3^7, then 7^{0.3}. But none of the options have ln0.3, 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}. So maybe the question expects descending order, so the answer is A.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the order is from largest to smallest. But in Chinese math problems, usually when they ask for the order, if not specified, it&#39;s from largest to smallest. Let me check the options again. If the answer is A, then that&#39;s the descending order, which is correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is from the textbook where the order is required in another way, but given the options, A is the only one that has 7^{0.3} first, then 0.3^7, then ln0.3. So that&#39;s correct. So the answer should be A.Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should check if 0.3^7 is indeed larger than ln0.3. Since 0.3^7 is positive (≈0.0002) and ln0.3 is negative (≈-1.2), so yes, any positive number is larger than a negative number. So 0.3^7 is greater than ln0.3, so in descending order, after 7^{0.3}, the next is 0.3^7, then ln0.3. So option A.Therefore, the answer should be A.But wait, the options are given as A, B, C, D. Let me double-check.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in approximating 7^{0.3}. Let me recalculate that.Calculating 7^{0.3}:We can write 7^{0.3} = e^{0.3 ln7}. As ln7 ≈1.9459, so 0.3 * 1.9459 ≈0.5838. Then e^{0.5838}. Let&#39;s compute this more accurately.We know that e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.1 = 1.10517, so e^0.6 = e^0.5 * e^0.1 ≈1.64872 *1.10517≈1.8221. Then, since 0.5838 is 0.6 - 0.0162, so e^{0.5838} = e^{0.6 -0.0162} = e^{0.6} * e^{-0.0162} ≈1.8221 * (1 -0.0162) ≈1.8221 *0.9838≈1.8221 - (1.8221*0.0162). Let&#39;s compute 1.8221*0.0162≈0.0295. So 1.8221 -0.0295≈1.7926. So yes, approximately 1.7926. So 7^{0.3}≈1.7926, which is approximately 1.79, as I had before.0.3^7 is definitely 0.0002187, and ln0.3≈-1.2039.Therefore, the order from largest to smallest is 7^{0.3} &gt; 0.3^7 &gt; ln0.3, so the correct option is A.Therefore, the answer is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the order of the three numbers (7^{0.3}), (0.3^7), and (ln 0.3), we analyze each value individually:1. (ln 0.3): Since (0.3) is less than 1, the natural logarithm of a number less than 1 is negative. Therefore, (ln 0.3) is a negative number. Approximating, (ln 0.3 approx -1.2039).2. (0.3^7): Raising (0.3) (a positive number less than 1) to the 7th power results in a very small positive number. Calculating step-by-step, we find (0.3^7 approx 0.0002187).3. (7^{0.3}): Since (7) is greater than 1 and the exponent (0.3) is positive, (7^{0.3}) will be a positive number greater than 1. Using the approximation (7^{0.3} = e^{0.3 ln 7}), we find (7^{0.3} approx 1.7926).Ordering these values from largest to smallest:- (7^{0.3} approx 1.7926) (largest)- (0.3^7 approx 0.0002187) (small positive)- (ln 0.3 approx -1.2039) (negative, smallest)Thus, the correct order is (7^{0.3}), (0.3^7), (ln 0.3), which corresponds to option A.(boxed{A}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to figure out the order of these three numbers: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, and ln(0.3). The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order. Hmm. Let me think step by step.First, maybe I should evaluate each of these numbers individually and then compare them. But since they might be tricky to compute exactly without a calculator, I can probably estimate their values using some logarithmic properties or other mathematical reasoning. Let&#39;s start with each term one by one.Starting with 7^{0.3}. That&#39;s 7 raised to the power of 0.3. Since 0.3 is the same as 3/10, so it&#39;s the 10th root of 7 cubed. Hmm, maybe I can approximate this. Let&#39;s recall that 7^1 is 7, and 7^0.5 is sqrt(7), which is approximately 2.6458. So 7^{0.5} ≈ 2.6458. Then 0.3 is less than 0.5, so 7^{0.3} should be less than 2.6458. Wait, but maybe I can get a better estimate.Alternatively, take the natural logarithm of 7^{0.3} which is 0.3 * ln(7). Let&#39;s compute ln(7). I remember that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(5) ≈ 1.6094, so ln(7) should be around 1.9459, since 7 is between e^1.9459 ≈ 7. So, 0.3 * 1.9459 ≈ 0.5838. Then exponentiating that gives e^{0.5838}. Let&#39;s approximate e^{0.5} is about 1.6487, and e^{0.6} is about 1.8221. Since 0.5838 is between 0.5 and 0.6, maybe around 1.79? So, 7^{0.3} ≈ e^{0.5838} ≈ 1.79. Hmm, that seems reasonable. So approximately 1.79.Next, 0.3^7. That&#39;s 0.3 multiplied by itself 7 times. Since 0.3 is less than 1, raising it to a higher power makes it smaller. Let&#39;s compute step by step:0.3^2 = 0.090.3^3 = 0.0270.3^4 = 0.00810.3^5 = 0.002430.3^6 = 0.0007290.3^7 = 0.0002187Wow, okay, so 0.3^7 is 0.0002187. That&#39;s a very small positive number, about 0.0002.Third term is ln(0.3). Natural logarithm of 0.3. Since 0.3 is less than 1, ln(0.3) will be negative. Let me recall that ln(1) = 0, ln(e^{-1}) = -1, and e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679. Since 0.3 is less than e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679, the ln(0.3) will be less than -1. Let&#39;s compute ln(0.3).We can express 0.3 as 3/10, so ln(0.3) = ln(3) - ln(10). We know ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(10) ≈ 2.3026. So ln(0.3) ≈ 1.0986 - 2.3026 = -1.204. Therefore, ln(0.3) ≈ -1.204.So now, let&#39;s summarize the approximate values:- 7^{0.3} ≈ 1.79- 0.3^7 ≈ 0.0002187- ln(0.3) ≈ -1.204Therefore, ordering them from largest to smallest:7^{0.3} (≈1.79) is the largest, then 0.3^7 (≈0.0002), which is a positive number but very small, and then ln(0.3) (≈-1.204) which is negative. Wait, but hold on, 0.3^7 is positive and ln(0.3) is negative, so 0.3^7 is definitely larger than ln(0.3). So the order should be 7^{0.3} &gt; 0.3^7 &gt; ln(0.3)?Wait, but 0.3^7 is 0.0002, which is positive but very small, and ln(0.3) is -1.204, which is negative. So 0.0002 is greater than -1.204, right? So in order from largest to smallest: 7^{0.3} (≈1.79) first, then 0.3^7 (≈0.0002), then ln(0.3) (≈-1.204). So the order is 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln(0.3). So that&#39;s option A.But wait, let me check the options again. A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}, ln0.3. B: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^{7}. C: 0.3^{7},7^{0.3}, ln0.3. D: ln0.3, 7^{0.3},0.3^{7}.So according to my estimation, the correct order is A. However, wait, the options might be in ascending or descending order? Wait, the question says &quot;the order of the three numbers&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify ascending or descending. Wait, but looking at the options, A is 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3. So from highest to lowest. So 7^{0.3} is the biggest, then 0.3^7, then ln0.3. So that&#39;s correct.But hold on, maybe I made a mistake in estimating 7^{0.3}? Let me verify that again. Let&#39;s use another method. Let me think about logarithms.Alternatively, maybe compare 7^{0.3} with 1. Is 7^{0.3} greater than 1? Yes, because any positive number raised to a positive power is greater than 1. Wait, 7^0 is 1, and 7^{0.3} is greater than 1 since 0.3 is positive. So 7^{0.3} is definitely greater than 1. Then 0.3^7 is 0.0002 as we calculated, which is between 0 and 1. And ln0.3 is negative.Therefore, the order from largest to smallest must be 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3, which is option A. Therefore, the answer should be A.Wait, but the options could be in a different order. Wait, no, the options are given as sequences. So A is (7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3), B is (7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^7), C is (0.3^7, 7^{0.3}, ln0.3}, D is (ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7). So since 7^{0.3} is the biggest, then 0.3^7 is next, then ln0.3 is the smallest (most negative). So order is 7^{0.3} &gt; 0.3^7 &gt; ln0.3. Therefore, the correct answer is A.But wait, I think maybe I misapplied the estimation for 7^{0.3}. Let me check with another approach. Let&#39;s take natural logarithm of 7^{0.3} which is 0.3 * ln7 ≈ 0.3 * 1.9459 ≈ 0.5838. Then exponentiating gives e^{0.5838}. Let&#39;s compute e^{0.5838} more accurately. Let&#39;s recall that e^{0.5} is about 1.64872, e^{0.6} is about 1.82211. The value 0.5838 is 0.5 + 0.0838. So, e^{0.5 + 0.0838} = e^{0.5} * e^{0.0838}. We know e^{0.0838} ≈ 1 + 0.0838 + (0.0838)^2/2 + (0.0838)^3/6 ≈ approx. Let&#39;s compute:First, 0.0838 is approximately 0.08. So e^{0.08} ≈ 1 + 0.08 + 0.08^2/2 + 0.08^3/6 ≈ 1 + 0.08 + 0.0032 + 0.0003413 ≈ 1.0835413. So e^{0.0838} ≈ approximately 1.0875 (since 0.0838 is a bit more than 0.08, so maybe 1.0875). Therefore, e^{0.5838} ≈ e^{0.5} * e^{0.0838} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.0875 ≈ Let&#39;s compute 1.64872 * 1.0875. First, 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976, 1.64872 * 0.0075 = 0.0123654. Adding those up: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0123654 ≈ 1.792983. So approximately 1.793, which aligns with my previous estimate of 1.79. So 7^{0.3} ≈ 1.79.Then, 0.3^7 is indeed 0.0002187, and ln(0.3) is approximately -1.2039. So 1.79 &gt; 0.0002 &gt; -1.2039, so order is 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln(0.3), which is option A.But wait, the problem is in Chinese maybe? Wait, the user just gave the problem in Chinese? Wait, no, the problem is translated here. The original problem is in Chinese, but here it&#39;s presented in English. Wait, but in the original problem, maybe there was a typo? Or maybe I made a mistake?Wait, let&#39;s check again. Is 0.3^7 positive? Yes, because any positive number raised to any power is positive. So 0.3^7 is positive, and ln(0.3) is negative. Therefore, 0.3^7 must be greater than ln(0.3). Therefore, the order is 7^{0.3} (positive, greater than 1), then 0.3^7 (positive, less than 1), then ln(0.3) (negative). Therefore, the answer is A.But wait, let me check the options again. The user lists the options as:A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}, ln0.3B: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^{7}C: 0.3^{7},7^{0.3}, ln0.3D: ln0.3,7^{0.3},0.3^{7}So according to my calculation, A is the correct order.But maybe I messed up the exponents? Let me check 0.3^7 again.0.3^1 = 0.30.3^2 = 0.090.3^3 = 0.0270.3^4 = 0.00810.3^5 = 0.002430.3^6 = 0.0007290.3^7 = 0.0002187Yes, that&#39;s correct. So 0.3^7 is 0.0002187, which is approximately 0.0002, a small positive number.ln(0.3) is approximately -1.204, which is negative. So between the three numbers, 7^{0.3} is the largest, then 0.3^7, then ln(0.3). So the order is A.But let me check again if perhaps the question is asking for ascending order instead of descending. Wait, the problem says &quot;the order of the three numbers&quot;. Usually, when problems ask for the order without specifying, they might mean from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest. However, looking at the options:A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}, ln0.3B: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^{7}C: 0.3^{7},7^{0.3}, ln0.3D: ln0.3,7^{0.3},0.3^{7}So A is descending order: largest to smallest. D is ascending order: smallest to largest. The problem statement in Chinese might specify the order, but here it&#39;s translated as &quot;the order of the three numbers&quot;. Hmm. Maybe it&#39;s expecting a specific order. Wait, the original problem is (   ), which in Chinese tests is usually a multiple-choice question where you select the correct sequence. The options are given as A to D, each being a possible sequence. So the correct answer is the one that has the numbers in the correct order from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest? Wait, but in the options, A is from largest to smallest (since 7^{0.3} is the largest, then 0.3^7, then ln0.3). D is ln0.3 (smallest), then 7^{0.3}, then 0.3^7 (which would be ascending order except that 0.3^7 is less than 7^{0.3} but positive). Wait, no. Wait, ascending order would be from smallest to largest. So ln0.3 is the smallest (negative), then 0.3^7 (positive but small), then 7^{0.3} (largest). So ascending order would be D: ln0.3, 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}? Wait, no. Wait, D is ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}. Wait, that&#39;s not ascending. Let&#39;s check:If ascending order (smallest to largest):ln0.3 ≈ -1.204 (smallest)0.3^7 ≈ 0.0002187 (next)7^{0.3} ≈ 1.79 (largest)So ascending order would be ln0.3, 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}. But none of the options present this. Wait, the options are:A: 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}, ln0.3B: 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^{7}C: 0.3^{7},7^{0.3}, ln0.3D: ln0.3,7^{0.3},0.3^{7}So ascending order would require the sequence ln0.3, 0.3^7, 7^{0.3}, which is not listed. Option D is ln0.3, 7^{0.3}, 0.3^{7}, which is incorrect because 0.3^7 is less than 7^{0.3}. Option C is 0.3^7,7^{0.3}, ln0.3, which is also incorrect. So none of the options present ascending order.If the question is about descending order (from largest to smallest), then the correct order is 7^{0.3}, 0.3^7, ln0.3, which is option A.Therefore, the correct answer should be A.Wait, but the original problem might have different nuances. Let me just confirm once more.7^{0.3} is about 1.79, which is the largest.0.3^7 is about 0.0002, positive but very small.ln0.3 is about -1.204, which is negative.So from largest to smallest: 7^{0.3} &gt; 0.3^7 &gt; ln0.3, which is option A.Alternatively, if it&#39;s a different order, but based on the options given, A is the only one that lists them in that sequence.Therefore, I think the answer is A.But wait, in the options, option B is 7^{0.3}, ln0.3, 0.3^7. But that would imply that ln0.3 is greater than 0.3^7, which is not the case, because ln0.3 is negative and 0.3^7 is positive. So option B is incorrect.Similarly, option C is 0.3^7,7^{0.3}, ln0.3, which is also incorrect because ln0.3 is the smallest. Option D is ln0.3,7^{0.3},0.3^{7}, which is ascending except the last two are reversed.Therefore, only option A is correct.But wait, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem? Wait, no. Let me check once more. The problem is from a Chinese test, so maybe there&#39;s a different way of ordering? But no, mathematically, A is correct. The answer is A.Wait, but wait, I just realized that sometimes, in certain contexts, the order might be written in another way, but given the options, A is the only possible correct answer.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the order of the numbers (7^{0.3}), (0.3^7), and (ln{0.3}), we approximate their values:1. Approximating (7^{0.3}):   - Using logarithms: (ln(7) approx 1.9459)   - (0.3 times ln(7) approx 0.3 times 1.9459 = 0.5838)   - Exponentiating: (e^{0.5838} approx 1.793)   - Therefore, (7^{0.3} approx 1.79)2. Approximating (0.3^7):   - Calculating step-by-step:     - (0.3^2 = 0.09)     - (0.3^3 = 0.027)     - (0.3^4 = 0.0081)     - (0.3^5 = 0.00243)     - (0.3^6 = 0.000729)     - (0.3^7 = 0.0002187)   - Therefore, (0.3^7 approx 0.0002187)3. Approximating (ln{0.3}):   - Using logarithms: (ln(0.3) = ln(3) - ln(10) approx 1.0986 - 2.3026 = -1.204)   - Therefore, (ln{0.3} approx -1.204)Summarizing the values:- (7^{0.3} approx 1.79) (largest)- (0.3^7 approx 0.0002187) (positive but very small)- (ln{0.3} approx -1.204) (negative, smallest)Ordering from largest to smallest: (7^{0.3} &gt; 0.3^7 &gt; ln{0.3}).Thus, the correct order is (boxed{A}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🔑:</span>Among the three numbers, 7^{0.3} &gt; 1, 0.3^{7} in (0, 1), ln{0.3}  0.3^{7} &gt; ln{0.3}.Thus, the correct option is boxed{text{A}}.Analysis: This conclusion can be drawn by utilizing the monotonicity of the exponential and logarithmic functions.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-cbacdf16 data-v-9cb8b59c><div class="review" data-v-9cb8b59c><div class="review-title" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>❓:</span>Example 6.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some integration techniques. Integrals involving square roots in the denominator often require completing the square or trigonometric substitution. Let me try completing the square first for the quadratic expression in the denominator.The quadratic inside the square root is -2x² -4x +6. Maybe I should factor out the coefficient of x² to make it easier. Let&#39;s factor out -2:-2x² -4x +6 = -2(x² + 2x) +6Wait, if I factor out -2 from the first two terms, I get -2(x² + 2x) +6. Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses. The coefficient of x is 2, so half of that is 1, and squaring it gives 1. So, add and subtract 1 inside the parentheses:-2[(x² + 2x +1 -1)] +6 = -2[(x+1)² -1] +6Distribute the -2:-2(x+1)² +2 +6 = -2(x+1)² +8So the expression under the square root simplifies to 8 - 2(x+1)². Let me check that again:Original expression: 6 -4x -2x²After factoring out -2: -2(x² +2x) +6Completing the square: x² +2x becomes (x+1)^2 -1, so:-2[(x+1)^2 -1] +6 = -2(x+1)^2 +2 +6 = -2(x+1)^2 +8Yes, that&#39;s correct. So the integral becomes:∫ dx / √[8 - 2(x+1)²]Hmm, perhaps factor out the 8 or the 2 to make it look like a standard integral form. Let me factor out 2 from inside the square root:√[8 - 2(x+1)²] = √[2(4 - (x+1)²)]Which is equal to √2 * √[4 - (x+1)²]Therefore, the integral becomes:∫ dx / [√2 * √(4 - (x+1)²)] = (1/√2) ∫ dx / √(4 - (x+1)²)Now, that looks like the standard integral form ∫ du / √(a² - u²), which is arcsin(u/a) + C. Let me confirm that.Yes, the integral of 1/√(a² - u²) du is arcsin(u/a) + C. So in this case, u would be (x+1), and a² is 4, so a is 2. Therefore, the integral becomes:(1/√2) * arcsin( (x+1)/2 ) + CBut wait, let me check the coefficients again. The standard integral is ∫ du / √(a² - u²) = arcsin(u/a) + C. So here, the integrand is 1 / √(4 - (x+1)^2), so integrating that would be arcsin( (x+1)/2 ) + C. Then, since we have a factor of 1/√2 in front, does that affect anything? Wait, no, because the standard integral doesn&#39;t have any coefficient in front. Let me think again.Wait, when we factored out √2 from the denominator, we had:1 / [√2 * √(4 - (x+1)^2)] = 1/√2 * 1/√(4 - (x+1)^2)Therefore, the integral is (1/√2) times the integral of 1/√(4 - (x+1)^2) dx. The integral of 1/√(a² - u²) du is arcsin(u/a) + C, so here, u = x+1, a = 2. Therefore, the integral becomes:(1/√2) * arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + CIs that correct? Let me verify by differentiating. Let&#39;s compute the derivative of (1/√2) * arcsin( (x+1)/2 ).The derivative of arcsin(u) is 1/√(1 - u²) * du/dx. So:d/dx [ (1/√2) arcsin( (x+1)/2 ) ] = (1/√2) * [1 / √(1 - ( (x+1)/2 )² ) ] * (1/2)Simplify this:(1/√2) * (1/2) * 1 / √(1 - (x² + 2x +1)/4 )Multiply the constants: 1/(2√2)The denominator inside the square root becomes:√[ (4 - (x² +2x +1))/4 ) ] = √[ (4 - x² -2x -1)/4 ) ] = √[ (3 -2x -x²)/4 ) ] = √(3 -2x -x²)/2So the entire derivative is:1/(2√2) / ( √(3 -2x -x²)/2 ) ) = [1/(2√2)] * [2 / √(3 -2x -x²) ] = 1/(√2) * 1 / √(3 -2x -x²)But the original integrand is 1 / √(6 -4x -2x²). Let me compute √(6 -4x -2x²):Factor out a 2: √[2*(3 -2x -x²)] = √2 * √(3 -2x -x²)Therefore, 1 / √(6 -4x -2x²) = 1 / [√2 * √(3 -2x -x²) ]Which is exactly the derivative we obtained. Therefore, the derivative of (1/√2) arcsin( (x+1)/2 ) is 1 / √(6 -4x -2x² ), which matches the integrand. Therefore, the integral is correct.Wait a second, but in the standard integral, the coefficient in front of the arcsin is 1/a. Wait, no, actually, when you have ∫ du / √(a² - u²) = arcsin(u/a) + C. So the coefficient here is 1/√2 times arcsin(u/a). Since when we factored out √2 from the denominator, we had 1/√2 times the integral of 1/√(a² - u²) du, which gives 1/√2 times arcsin(u/a) + C. So yes, the answer is (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C. But maybe it can be simplified further or expressed in terms of inverse trigonometric functions with rationalized denominators? Alternatively, we can express it using natural logarithms, but I think arcsin is acceptable here.Alternatively, sometimes integrals of this form can also be expressed in terms of inverse sine or inverse trigonometric functions. Let me check if there is an alternative form. Alternatively, we might consider hyperbolic substitutions, but in this case, since the quadratic is negative definite (leading coefficient negative), but after completing the square, we have a positive term, so arcsin is appropriate.Alternatively, the integral could be expressed in terms of a different substitution. Let me see.Wait, another approach. Let&#39;s try a substitution to make it look like the standard form. Let me set u = x +1. Then du = dx, and the integral becomes:∫ du / √[8 - 2u²] = ∫ du / [√2 * √(4 - u²)] ) = (1/√2) ∫ du / √(4 - u²) = (1/√2) arcsin(u/2) + C = (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C, which is the same as before.So that confirms the result. Alternatively, if we want to rationalize the denominator, 1/√2 can be written as √2 / 2, so the answer can be expressed as (√2 / 2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C, but both forms are acceptable.Alternatively, maybe express in terms of inverse sine with coefficients simplified. Hmm. Alternatively, is there a different substitution that leads to a different form? For instance, sometimes integrals of 1/√(ax² + bx + c) can also be expressed using logarithms if the quadratic doesn&#39;t form a perfect square, but in this case, after completing the square, it&#39;s a standard arcsin form.Therefore, I think the integral is (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C. Alternatively, since arcsin(z) is the same as -arccos(z) + π/2, but that&#39;s not necessary here.Alternatively, let me check if there&#39;s a mistake in the substitution. Wait, when completing the square:Original quadratic: 6 -4x -2x²Let me write it as -2x² -4x +6. To complete the square, factor out the coefficient of x²:-2(x² + 2x) +6. Then complete the square inside the parentheses:x² + 2x = (x +1)^2 -1. Therefore:-2[(x +1)^2 -1] +6 = -2(x +1)^2 +2 +6 = -2(x +1)^2 +8. So yes, 8 -2(x +1)^2 under the square root. So sqrt(8 -2(x +1)^2). So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the integral is indeed 1 over sqrt(8 -2(x +1)^2) dx. Then factoring out 8 under the square root:sqrt(8(1 - (x +1)^2 /4)) = sqrt(8) * sqrt(1 - (x +1)^2 /4) = 2*sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - ((x +1)/2)^2 )Therefore, the integral becomes:1/(2*sqrt(2)) * ∫ 1 / sqrt(1 - ((x +1)/2)^2 ) dxBut ∫1 / sqrt(1 - u²) du = arcsin(u) + C. So if u = (x +1)/2, then du = dx/2, so dx = 2 du. Therefore, the integral becomes:1/(2*sqrt(2)) * ∫ 2 du / sqrt(1 - u² ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ∫ du / sqrt(1 - u² ) = (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin(u) + C = (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + CSo that also checks out. So, yes, the integral is correct.Alternatively, if we rationalize the denominator, 1/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2)/2, so the answer can be written as sqrt(2)/2 arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C.But unless the problem specifies a preferred form, both are acceptable. However, the original problem didn&#39;t specify, so either form is okay. But perhaps the answer is more conventionally written with a rational denominator. Let me check.In the example given, which is example 6, the problem is to find the integral. The solution process leads us to (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C, which can also be written as (√2/2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C. Both forms are correct. The answer might also be expressed in terms of inverse trigonometric functions without fractions inside, but I don&#39;t see a simpler way.Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed as (1/√2) times the inverse sine function, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary. Alternatively, maybe using a substitution with a different trigonometric function. Let me consider another substitution.Suppose we set u = x +1, then as before, but let me try a substitution where I let 2 sinθ = u, since the denominator becomes sqrt(4 - u²). Let me try:Let u = 2 sinθ, then du = 2 cosθ dθ.Then the integral becomes:(1/√2) ∫ du / sqrt(4 - u²) = (1/√2) ∫ [2 cosθ dθ] / sqrt(4 - 4 sin²θ )Simplify denominator:sqrt(4(1 - sin²θ)) = sqrt(4 cos²θ) = 2 cosθThus, the integral becomes:(1/√2) ∫ [2 cosθ dθ] / (2 cosθ) ) = (1/√2) ∫ dθ = (1/√2) θ + CBut θ = arcsin(u / 2) = arcsin( (x +1)/2 )Therefore, substituting back, we get (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C, which is the same as before. So this substitution confirms the result.Therefore, the integral is indeed (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C.But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of inverse trigonometric functions multiplied by a constant, which is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe expressed as a multiple of arcsin, but I think that&#39;s the simplest form.Alternatively, let me check if the original quadratic can be expressed in another form. Wait, perhaps the quadratic in the denominator is 6 -4x -2x². Let me check for possible factorization or other simplifications. Let&#39;s see:6 -4x -2x² = -2x² -4x +6 = -2(x² + 2x -3). Wait, x² + 2x -3 factors as (x +3)(x -1). So 6 -4x -2x² = -2(x +3)(x -1). But that might not help directly with the integral, unless we use a different substitution. But maybe using hyperbolic substitution? Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps a substitution using t = x + something. But since we already completed the square and found the integral, perhaps that&#39;s the most straightforward method.Alternatively, using a substitution for the entire quadratic. Let me see, but in this case, completing the square seems the right approach.Therefore, the final answer is (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C, which can be written as (√2/2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C.Alternatively, since some textbooks prefer to rationalize denominators, the second form might be preferred. Let me check if the coefficients can be simplified further.Alternatively, since arcsin(z) is the integral from 0 to z of 1/√(1 - t²) dt, but that&#39;s not necessary here.Therefore, unless there is another standard form I&#39;m missing, I think the answer is correct as (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C.Alternatively, if the original problem had a different form, but according to the steps, I think this is the correct integral.Final AnswerThe integral is equal to boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2} arcsinleft( dfrac{x + 1}{2} right) + C}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the integral (int frac{dx}{sqrt{6 - 4x - 2x^2}}), we start by completing the square for the quadratic expression in the denominator.First, factor out the coefficient of (x^2) from the quadratic expression:[6 - 4x - 2x^2 = -2(x^2 + 2x) + 6]Next, complete the square inside the parentheses:[x^2 + 2x = (x + 1)^2 - 1]Substitute this back into the expression:[-2[(x + 1)^2 - 1] + 6 = -2(x + 1)^2 + 2 + 6 = -2(x + 1)^2 + 8]Thus, the expression under the square root becomes:[sqrt{8 - 2(x + 1)^2} = sqrt{2(4 - (x + 1)^2)} = sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{4 - (x + 1)^2}]The integral then simplifies to:[int frac{dx}{sqrt{6 - 4x - 2x^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} int frac{dx}{sqrt{4 - (x + 1)^2}}]Recognize the standard integral form (int frac{du}{sqrt{a^2 - u^2}} = arcsinleft(frac{u}{a}right) + C), where (a = 2) and (u = x + 1). Therefore, we have:[frac{1}{sqrt{2}} arcsinleft(frac{x + 1}{2}right) + C]Rationalizing the coefficient (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) gives:[frac{sqrt{2}}{2} arcsinleft(frac{x + 1}{2}right) + C]Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2} arcsinleft( dfrac{x + 1}{2} right) + C}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the integral of 1 over the square root of (6 - 4x - 2x²) dx. Hmm, let&#39;s start by looking at the denominator. It has a quadratic inside a square root. I remember that when integrating expressions with quadratics under a square root, completing the square might be a good approach. Let me try that.First, let me rewrite the quadratic part: -2x² -4x +6. Wait, actually, the original expression is 6 -4x -2x². Let me rearrange that in standard form: -2x² -4x +6. To complete the square, the coefficient of x² should be positive, so maybe factor out a -2 first. Let&#39;s try that.Factoring out -2 from the terms with x: -2(x² + 2x) +6. Wait, let&#39;s check:-2x² -4x +6 = -2(x² + 2x) +6. Yes, that&#39;s correct. Now, inside the parentheses, we have x² + 2x. To complete the square here, we take half of the coefficient of x, which is 1, square it to get 1, and add and subtract that inside the parentheses. So:-2[(x² + 2x +1 -1)] +6 = -2[(x+1)² -1] +6. Distribute the -2: -2(x+1)² +2 +6 = -2(x+1)² +8.So the quadratic expression 6 -4x -2x² simplifies to -2(x+1)² +8. Let me write that as 8 -2(x+1)². Then, the integral becomes:∫ dx / √[8 -2(x+1)²]Hmm, maybe factor out the 8 to make it look like a standard integral. Let&#39;s see:First, factor out 2 from inside the square root:√[8 -2(x+1)²] = √[2{4 - (x+1)²}]. Wait, 8 divided by 2 is 4, so √[2*(4 - (x+1)²)] = √2 * √[4 - (x+1)²]Therefore, the integral becomes:∫ dx / [√2 * √(4 - (x+1)²)] = (1/√2) ∫ dx / √(4 - (x+1)²)That looks like the standard integral form ∫ du / √(a² - u²), which is arcsin(u/a) + C. Let me confirm. Yes, the integral of 1/√(a² - u²) du is arcsin(u/a) + C. Alternatively, sometimes written as inverse sine.In this case, the denominator has √(4 - (x+1)²), so a² =4, so a=2. And u is (x+1). Therefore, the integral should be (1/√2) * arcsin[(x+1)/2] + C. Wait, but let me check the constants again.Wait, the standard integral is ∫ du / √(a² - u²) = arcsin(u/a) + C. So here, the integral is (1/√2) times ∫ du / √(a² - u²), where u = x+1 and a = 2. So ∫ du / √(a² - u²) is arcsin(u/a). Therefore, multiplying by 1/√2, the integral becomes (1/√2) arcsin[(x+1)/2] + C.But wait, hold on. Let me double-check the algebra when factoring out from the square root. The original expression inside the square root was 8 -2(x+1)^2. When I factor out 2, that&#39;s 2*(4 - (x+1)^2). Then the square root of that is sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2). So when I take 1 over that, it&#39;s 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2)). Therefore, the integral becomes (1/sqrt(2)) times ∫ 1/sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2) dx.So, the integral ∫1/sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2) dx is arcsin((x+1)/2) + C. Therefore, multiplying by 1/sqrt(2), the integral is (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin((x+1)/2) + C.Alternatively, maybe we can rationalize the denominator for the constant factor. So 1/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2)/2. So writing it as (sqrt(2)/2) arcsin((x+1)/2) + C. But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s necessary. The answer can be written either way.Alternatively, sometimes integrals of this form can also be expressed in terms of inverse trigonometric functions or using substitution leading to a different form. Let me check if maybe there&#39;s a substitution I can do earlier on.Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let&#39;s consider the integral:∫ dx / sqrt(6 -4x -2x²)Let me see if another substitution would work. Let me set u equal to the linear term inside the quadratic. For quadratics under square roots, another method is to express in terms of (ax + b) and then use a trigonometric substitution.But perhaps completing the square was the right approach. Let me recap to make sure.Original quadratic: 6 -4x -2x².Completing the square:-2x² -4x +6.Factor out -2: -2(x² + 2x) +6.Complete the square for x² + 2x: (x+1)² -1.Therefore, substituting back: -2[(x+1)² -1] +6 = -2(x+1)² +2 +6 = -2(x+1)^2 +8.So quadratic becomes 8 -2(x+1)^2, which is 2*(4 - (x+1)^2). So sqrt of that is sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2).Thus, integral becomes 1/(sqrt(2)) * ∫1/sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2) dx.So that substitution u = x +1, du = dx. Then integral is 1/sqrt(2) * ∫1/sqrt(4 - u²) du.Which is 1/sqrt(2) * arcsin(u/2) + C. Substitute back u = x +1, so 1/sqrt(2) * arcsin((x+1)/2) + C.Alternatively, since 1/sqrt(2) is a constant, that can be written as arcsin((x+1)/2)/sqrt(2) + C. But is this the most simplified form?Alternatively, perhaps using substitution with coefficients. Wait, another approach: the integral is similar to 1/sqrt(a^2 - u^2), so integral is arcsin(u/a) + C. So in this case, after substitution, the answer is arcsin((x+1)/2)/sqrt(2) + C. But why is there a 1/sqrt(2) factor?Wait, no. Wait, the standard integral ∫1/sqrt(a² - u²) du is arcsin(u/a) + C. Here, the integral after substitution is ∫1/sqrt(4 - u²) du, which is arcsin(u/2) + C. Then multiplied by 1/sqrt(2). So yes, the answer would be (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin((x+1)/2) + C.Alternatively, if we want to rationalize the denominator, we can write sqrt(2)/2 arcsin((x+1)/2) + C. Both forms are acceptable.But let me check if another substitution can lead directly to a standard integral without the 1/sqrt(2) factor. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we factor out the 8 from the quadratic under the square root. Wait, the original expression after completing the square is sqrt(8 - 2(x+1)^2). Alternatively, factor out 8: sqrt[8(1 - ( (x+1)^2 ) /4 )]. Because 8 -2(x+1)^2 =8[1 - ( (x+1)^2 ) /4 ]. Let&#39;s check:8[1 - (x+1)^2 /4] =8 - 2(x+1)^2. Yes, correct.Therefore, sqrt[8(1 - (x+1)^2 /4)] = sqrt(8) * sqrt(1 - (x+1)^2 /4) = 2*sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - ((x+1)/2)^2 )Thus, the integral becomes ∫ dx / [2*sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - ((x+1)/2)^2 ) ] = (1/(2*sqrt(2))) ∫ dx / sqrt(1 - ((x+1)/2)^2 )Let u = (x+1)/2. Then du = dx/2, so dx = 2 du. Substitute:(1/(2*sqrt(2))) ∫ 2 du / sqrt(1 - u²) = (1/sqrt(2)) ∫ du / sqrt(1 - u²) = (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin(u) + C = (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin( (x+1)/2 ) + C.Same result as before. So that&#39;s confirming the same answer. So regardless of substitution, we get that factor of 1/sqrt(2).Alternatively, perhaps the integral can also be expressed in terms of inverse sine without the constant factor if there was an error in the substitution steps. But I think the steps are correct.Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let&#39;s see, if we set t = x +1, then dt = dx. Then the integral becomes ∫ dt / sqrt(8 -2t²). Factor out sqrt(2):∫ dt / sqrt(2*(4 - t²)) = (1/sqrt(2)) ∫ dt / sqrt(4 - t²) = (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin(t/2) + C = same result again.Therefore, the integral is (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin( (x+1)/2 ) + C. To check, let&#39;s differentiate this answer.Let’s compute derivative of (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin((x+1)/2):First, derivative of arcsin(u) is 1/sqrt(1 - u²) * du/dx. So:(1/sqrt(2)) * [1 / sqrt(1 - ((x+1)/2)^2)] * (1/2)Simplify:(1/(2*sqrt(2))) * 1 / sqrt(1 - (x+1)^2 /4 )Multiply denominator:sqrt(1 - (x+1)^2 /4 ) = sqrt( (4 - (x+1)^2)/4 ) = sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2)/2Therefore, denominator is sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2)/2. Thus, reciprocal is 2 / sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2)Therefore, derivative becomes (1/(2*sqrt(2))) * (2 / sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2)) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1 / sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2))But the original integrand is 1 / sqrt(6 -4x -2x²). Earlier, we had 6 -4x -2x² =8 -2(x+1)^2, so sqrt(8 -2(x+1)^2) = sqrt(2*(4 - (x+1)^2)) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2). Therefore, 1 / sqrt(6 -4x -2x²) =1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2))Therefore, derivative is (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2)) which is the same as 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2)) which is the integrand. Therefore, differentiation checks out. So the integral is correct.Alternatively, perhaps the answer can be expressed differently. For example, sometimes constants are rationalized. So 1/sqrt(2) is equal to sqrt(2)/2. So writing the answer as (sqrt(2)/2) arcsin((x+1)/2) + C. That might be preferable in some contexts. But both forms are correct.Alternatively, another approach: trigonometric substitution. Let me try that as a different method to confirm.Given the integral ∫ dx / sqrt(6 -4x -2x²)After completing the square, we have 8 -2(x+1)^2. So integral is ∫ dx / sqrt(8 -2(x+1)^2). Let me write this as ∫ dx / sqrt(2*(4 - (x+1)^2)) which is (1/sqrt(2)) ∫ dx / sqrt(4 - (x+1)^2). Let’s make the substitution (x+1) = 2 sinθ. Then dx = 2 cosθ dθ. Substitute into the integral:(1/sqrt(2)) ∫ [2 cosθ dθ] / sqrt(4 - (2 sinθ)^2) = (1/sqrt(2)) * 2 ∫ [cosθ dθ] / sqrt(4 -4 sin²θ) = (2/sqrt(2)) ∫ cosθ dθ / [2 cosθ] ].Simplify: (2/sqrt(2)) / 2 = 1/sqrt(2). Then ∫ cosθ dθ / (2 cosθ) becomes ∫ (cosθ / (2 cosθ)) dθ = ∫ (1/2) dθ. Wait, hold on.Wait, sqrt(4 -4 sin²θ) = sqrt(4(1 - sin²θ)) = sqrt(4 cos²θ) = 2 |cosθ|. Assuming cosθ is positive (since we can take θ in -π/2 to π/2), so sqrt(4 -4 sin²θ) = 2 cosθ. Therefore, the integral becomes:(1/sqrt(2)) * [2 cosθ dθ] / [2 cosθ] ] = (1/sqrt(2)) ∫ dθ = (1/sqrt(2)) θ + C.Now, θ is arcsin((x+1)/2), since we set (x+1) = 2 sinθ, so sinθ = (x+1)/2, hence θ = arcsin((x+1)/2). Therefore, substituting back, the integral is (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin((x+1)/2) + C. Same result as before. So this confirms the answer again.Therefore, regardless of substitution method, the integral evaluates to (1/√2) arcsin((x +1)/2) + C.Alternatively, the answer might be expressed using inverse sine multiplied by √2/2. Since 1/√2 = √2/2, that is:(√2/2) arcsin((x +1)/2) + C.Either form is acceptable, but depending on the textbook or convention, sometimes rationalized denominators are preferred. However, both are correct.Another check: let&#39;s compute the integral using an alternative substitution. Let me try to use a linear substitution before completing the square. For example, let me set u = x + a, to eliminate the linear term. Wait, but completing the square already does that. Alternatively, use the integral formula for ∫ dx / sqrt(ax² + bx + c). There&#39;s a standard formula for that.The general formula for ∫ dx / sqrt(ax² + bx + c) is (1/sqrt(a)) ln |2a x + b + 2 sqrt(a) sqrt(ax² + bx + c)| | + C when a &gt;0. But in this case, the coefficient of x² is negative, so a is negative. Alternatively, if a is negative, the integral becomes arcsin( (2ax + b)/sqrt(b² -4ac) ) / sqrt(-a) + C. Wait, let me check the formula.The integral ∫ dx / sqrt(ax² + bx + c) can be expressed in terms of inverse trigonometric functions if the quadratic under the root is negative (i.e., leading to a form similar to sqrt(a^2 - u^2)) or logarithmic functions if it&#39;s positive. Let me recall the formula.From standard integral tables, when the quadratic is under a square root and the coefficient of x² is negative (so the parabola opens downward), the integral is of the form (1/sqrt(-a)) arcsin( (2ax + b)/sqrt(b² -4ac) ) + C. Wait, let me verify.Let’s consider the integral ∫ dx / sqrt(-ax² + bx + c). Completing the square would lead to the form sqrt( (sqrt(-a)x + d)^2 + e ), but maybe not. Let me instead use the standard formula.Alternatively, let&#39;s use substitution. Let’s write the quadratic in the form -2x² -4x +6. Let’s write it as -2x² -4x +6 = -2(x² + 2x) +6. Wait, which is what we did before. So, the integral is ∫ dx / sqrt(-2x² -4x +6). Let me see if there&#39;s a standard formula for ∫ dx / sqrt(ax² + bx + c).Yes, the integral ∫ dx / sqrt(ax² + bx + c) can be expressed as follows:If a &gt; 0: (1/sqrt(a)) ln |2ax + b + 2 sqrt(a(ax² + bx + c))| + C.If a &lt; 0: (1/sqrt(-a)) arcsin( ( -2ax - b ) / sqrt(b² - 4ac) ) + C.Wait, let me check this formula. Let’s reference the standard integral.Yes, according to some sources, the integral ∫ dx / sqrt(ax² + bx + c) is:If a &gt; 0: (1/sqrt(a)) ln |2ax + b + 2 sqrt(a) sqrt(ax² + bx + c)| + C.If a &lt; 0: (-1/sqrt(-a)) arcsin( (2ax + b)/sqrt(b² -4ac) ) + C. Or with a positive coefficient.Wait, perhaps another way. Let&#39;s use the substitution to bring it into the form of 1/sqrt(a² - u²).In our case, a = -2, b = -4, c =6.Using the formula for a &lt;0: integral is (1/sqrt(-a)) arcsin( (2ax + b)/sqrt(-Δ) ) + C, where Δ is the discriminant b² -4ac.Wait, let&#39;s compute Δ: b² -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*(-2)*6 =16 +48=64.sqrt(-Δ) ??? Wait, Δ is positive here. Wait, maybe the formula is different.Wait, perhaps the formula is written as follows:For ∫ dx / sqrt(ax² + bx + c):If a &gt;0: ... as before.If a &lt;0, then ax² + bx + c = -|a|x² + bx + c, which can be written as positive under the square root, so completing the square to get sqrt(k² - u²), leading to an arcsin.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the formula given here: when completing the square for ax² +bx +c with a ≠0, we have ax² +bx +c = a(x + d)^2 + e. Then depending on the signs, the integral becomes either logarithmic or arcsin.Alternatively, let me use the standard substitution for ∫1/sqrt(ax² +bx +c) dx.Let me refer to standard integral formula.According to standard references, ∫ 1 / sqrt(ax² + bx + c) dx can be expressed as:1/sqrt(a) ln |2ax + b + 2 sqrt(a) sqrt(ax² + bx + c)| + C when a &gt;0,and-1/sqrt(-a) arcsin( (2ax + b)/sqrt(b² -4ac) ) + C when a &lt;0.Wait, let&#39;s check with our case.Here, a = -2, b = -4, c=6.Since a &lt;0, the formula is -1/sqrt(-a) arcsin( (2ax + b)/sqrt(b² -4ac) ) + C.Compute sqrt(-a): sqrt(-(-2)) = sqrt(2).Compute (2ax + b): 2*(-2)x + (-4) = -4x -4.Compute sqrt(b² -4ac): sqrt((-4)^2 -4*(-2)*6) = sqrt(16 +48)=sqrt(64)=8.Therefore, the formula gives:-1/sqrt(2) arcsin( (-4x -4)/8 ) + C = -1/sqrt(2) arcsin( (-4(x +1))/8 ) + C = -1/sqrt(2) arcsin( -(x +1)/2 ) + C.But arcsin(-z) = -arcsin(z), so this simplifies to -1/sqrt(2) * (-arcsin( (x +1)/2 )) + C = (1/sqrt(2)) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C. Which matches our previous result.Therefore, using the standard formula directly also leads to the same answer.Therefore, all methods confirm that the integral is (1/√2) arcsin( (x +1)/2 ) + C. So this is the correct result.I think that&#39;s thorough enough. I considered multiple methods: completing the square, substitution, trigonometric substitution, and using the standard integral formula. All lead to the same answer, so I can be confident this is correct.Final AnswerThe integral is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2} arcsinleft( dfrac{x + 1}{2} right) + C}.Alternatively, using dfrac{1}{sqrt{2}} instead of dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}, but since the problem didn&#39;t specify the form, both are correct. However, the boxed answer uses the rationalized form.&lt;/think&gt;To find the integral (int frac{dx}{sqrt{6-4x-2x^2}}), we start by completing the square for the quadratic expression in the denominator.1. Rewrite the quadratic expression:   [   6 - 4x - 2x^2 = -2(x^2 + 2x) + 6   ]2. Complete the square for (x^2 + 2x):   [   x^2 + 2x = (x + 1)^2 - 1   ]   Substituting back, we get:   [   -2[(x + 1)^2 - 1] + 6 = -2(x + 1)^2 + 2 + 6 = -2(x + 1)^2 + 8   ]3. Factor out the constant inside the square root:   [   sqrt{6 - 4x - 2x^2} = sqrt{8 - 2(x + 1)^2} = sqrt{2(4 - (x + 1)^2)} = sqrt{2} sqrt{4 - (x + 1)^2}   ]4. Rewrite the integral:   [   int frac{dx}{sqrt{6 - 4x - 2x^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} int frac{dx}{sqrt{4 - (x + 1)^2}}   ]5. Use the standard integral form (int frac{du}{sqrt{a^2 - u^2}} = arcsinleft(frac{u}{a}right) + C) with (u = x + 1) and (a = 2):   [   frac{1}{sqrt{2}} int frac{dx}{sqrt{4 - (x + 1)^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} arcsinleft(frac{x + 1}{2}right) + C   ]6. Rationalize the constant factor if necessary:   [   frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}   ]Thus, the integral is:[boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2} arcsinleft( dfrac{x + 1}{2} right) + C}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🔑:</span>Solution.

So, we have the universal set U which is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, set A is {1,2,3,4}, and set B is {3,4,5,6,7,8}. The question is asking for the intersection of the complements of A and B in U. The options are given as A through D, with D being the empty set. Hmm, let me recall how complements and intersections work.First, the complement of a set in universal set U consists of all elements in U that are not in the set. So, the complement of A, written as ∁ₐU A, should be all the elements in U that aren&#39;t in A. Similarly, the complement of B, ∁ₐU B, would be all elements in U not in B. Then, we need to find the intersection of these two complements, which means elements that are in both ∁ₐU A and ∁ₐU B.Let me write down the elements step by step. Starting with the universal set U: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. Set A is {1,2,3,4}, so the complement of A should be everything in U except 1,2,3,4. That would be {5,6,7,8}. Wait, let me check again. If U is up to 8, then yes, removing 1-4 leaves 5-8. So ∁ₐU A = {5,6,7,8}.Now, set B is {3,4,5,6,7,8}. So the complement of B would be all elements in U not in B. Looking at U, which is 1-8, and B is 3-8. Therefore, the elements not in B are 1 and 2. So ∁ₐU B = {1,2}.Now, we need the intersection of {5,6,7,8} and {1,2}. The intersection of two sets contains elements that are in both sets. Let me list them out: {5,6,7,8} ∩ {1,2}. Looking at these, there are no common elements between the two sets. The first set has numbers from 5 to 8, the second has 1 and 2. So their intersection is empty, right?Therefore, the result should be the empty set, which is option D. Let me just verify once more to be sure.Complement of A: U - A = {5,6,7,8}; complement of B: U - B = {1,2}; intersection is {5,6,7,8} ∩ {1,2} = empty set. Yep, that seems correct. So the answer must be D.But wait, let me check if I got the complements right. Maybe I mixed up the sets? Let&#39;s confirm again. A is {1,2,3,4}, so everything in U not in A is 5,6,7,8. Correct. B is {3,4,5,6,7,8}, so everything not in B is 1,2. Correct. So intersection is no elements. Therefore, the answer is D: ∅.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given the universal set ( U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ), set ( A = {1, 2, 3, 4} ), and set ( B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ), we need to find ((∁_{U}A) ∩ (∁_{U}B)).1. Finding the complement of ( A ) in ( U ):   - The complement of ( A ), denoted ( ∁_{U}A ), consists of all elements in ( U ) that are not in ( A ).   - ( A = {1, 2, 3, 4} ), so ( ∁_{U}A = U - A = {5, 6, 7, 8} ).2. Finding the complement of ( B ) in ( U ):   - The complement of ( B ), denoted ( ∁_{U}B ), consists of all elements in ( U ) that are not in ( B ).   - ( B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ), so ( ∁_{U}B = U - B = {1, 2} ).3. Finding the intersection of ( ∁_{U}A ) and ( ∁_{U}B ):   - The intersection of ( {5, 6, 7, 8} ) and ( {1, 2} ) is the set of elements common to both.   - There are no common elements between ( {5, 6, 7, 8} ) and ( {1, 2} ), so the intersection is the empty set ( varnothing ).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about finding the intersection of the complements of sets A and B with respect to the universal set U. The universal set U is given as {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. Set A is {1,2,3,4}, and set B is {3,4,5,6,7,8}. The question is asking for (∁ₐU A) ∩ (∁ᵤ B), right?First, let me recall what a complement of a set means. The complement of a set A with respect to the universal set U, denoted as ∁ᵤ A, is all the elements in U that are not in A. So, if U has elements 1 through 8, and A is {1,2,3,4}, then the complement of A should be the elements in U not in A, which would be {5,6,7,8}. Let me check that again. U is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, and A is {1,2,3,4}. So, yes, removing the elements of A from U leaves {5,6,7,8}. So ∁ᵤ A = {5,6,7,8}.Now, similarly, the complement of B with respect to U would be all elements in U not in B. Set B is {3,4,5,6,7,8}, so the elements not in B are {1,2}. Therefore, ∁ᵤ B = {1,2}.Now, we need to find the intersection of these two complements: {5,6,7,8} ∩ {1,2}. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both. Let&#39;s see, {5,6,7,8} and {1,2} have no elements in common. So their intersection would be the empty set, right?Wait, but let me make sure. Let me double-check each step. First, the complement of A: A is {1,2,3,4}, so elements not in A are 5,6,7,8. That&#39;s correct. Then, complement of B: B is {3,4,5,6,7,8}, so elements not in B are 1 and 2. That also seems correct.So, the intersection of {5,6,7,8} and {1,2} is indeed empty because there are no overlapping elements. Therefore, (∁ᵤ A) ∩ (∁ᵤ B) is the empty set. Looking at the options, D is the empty set. So the answer should be D.Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes these problems can be tricky. Let me verify using another approach. Maybe using De Morgan&#39;s laws. De Morgan&#39;s laws state that the complement of the union is the intersection of the complements, and the complement of the intersection is the union of the complements. But how does that apply here?Alternatively, maybe we can express the intersection of the complements as the complement of the union. Wait, according to De Morgan&#39;s law: ∁(A) ∩ ∁(B) = ∁(A ∪ B). Let me confirm that. Yes, De Morgan&#39;s laws state that the complement of the union of A and B is the intersection of their complements, and vice versa.So if we compute A ∪ B first, then take its complement, we should get the same result. Let&#39;s try that. A is {1,2,3,4}, and B is {3,4,5,6,7,8}. So A ∪ B is the union of these two sets. The union would include all elements in either A or B. So starting with 1,2,3,4 from A, and then 3,4,5,6,7,8 from B. Combining them, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Wait, that&#39;s the entire universal set U. Therefore, the complement of A ∪ B would be U minus (A ∪ B), which is U minus U, which is the empty set. So ∁(A ∪ B) is empty set, which matches our previous result. Therefore, the intersection of the complements is indeed the empty set.So, both methods lead to the conclusion that the answer is D: ∅. Therefore, the correct option is D.But let me check once more. If someone made a mistake in computing the complements, maybe they could get confused. For example, if someone thought that the complement of A is {1,2}, but no, that&#39;s the complement of B. Similarly, if they mixed up the complements, but as long as we carefully compute each complement, we should be fine.Alternatively, maybe someone could think that the intersection of the complements is elements not in A and not in B, which would be elements not in A ∪ B. Since A ∪ B is U, then that&#39;s nothing. So that&#39;s another way to see it. If we take elements that are neither in A nor in B, but since A ∪ B is already everything in U, there are no elements left. So that&#39;s another confirmation.Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is D, the empty set.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given the universal set ( U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ), set ( A = {1, 2, 3, 4} ), and set ( B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ), we need to find ( (∁_{U}A) ∩ (∁_{U}B) ).1. Finding the complement of ( A ) with respect to ( U ):   - The complement of ( A ), denoted ( ∁_{U}A ), consists of all elements in ( U ) that are not in ( A ).   - ( A = {1, 2, 3, 4} ), so ( ∁_{U}A = U setminus A = {5, 6, 7, 8} ).2. Finding the complement of ( B ) with respect to ( U ):   - The complement of ( B ), denoted ( ∁_{U}B ), consists of all elements in ( U ) that are not in ( B ).   - ( B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ), so ( ∁_{U}B = U setminus B = {1, 2} ).3. Finding the intersection of the complements:   - The intersection ( (∁_{U}A) ∩ (∁_{U}B) ) is the set of elements common to both ( {5, 6, 7, 8} ) and ( {1, 2} ).   - There are no common elements between these sets, so the intersection is the empty set ( varnothing ).4. Verification using De Morgan&#39;s Law:   - According to De Morgan&#39;s Law, ( ∁_{U}(A ∪ B) = (∁_{U}A) ∩ (∁_{U}B) ).   - ( A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} = U ), thus ( ∁_{U}(A ∪ B) = U setminus U = varnothing ).Both methods confirm that the result is the empty set. Therefore, the correct answer is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9cb8b59c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9cb8b59c><span class="icon" data-v-9cb8b59c>🔑:</span>The universal set is U={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, A={1,2,3,4}, and B={3,4,5,6,7,8}.Thus, ∁_{U}A={5,6,7,8},∁_{U}B={1,2};Hence, (∁_{U}A)∩(∁_{U}B)=varnothing.Therefore, the answer is boxed{D}.According to the definition of complement and intersection of sets, perform the calculation.
