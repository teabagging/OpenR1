So, we need to find the area of the figure M, which consists of all points (x, y) such that there exist real numbers a and b satisfying two inequalities:1. (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 ≤ 52. a^2 + b^2 ≤ min(4a - 2b, 5)First, let me parse what each of these inequalities represents. The first one is a circle centered at (a, b) with radius sqrt(5). So, for each (a, b) that satisfies the second inequality, we have a circle around that point. The figure M is the union of all such circles. Therefore, M is the set of all points (x, y) that lie within sqrt(5) distance from some point (a, b) that satisfies a^2 + b^2 ≤ min(4a - 2b, 5).Now, the second inequality is a bit trickier because it&#39;s a minimum of two expressions: 4a - 2b and 5. So, a^2 + b^2 has to be less than or equal to both 4a - 2b and 5. That means we need to find all (a, b) such that both a^2 + b^2 ≤ 4a - 2b and a^2 + b^2 ≤ 5. Therefore, the set of allowable centers (a, b) is the intersection of two regions: one defined by a^2 + b^2 ≤ 5 and another defined by a^2 + b^2 ≤ 4a - 2b. So, perhaps I should analyze these two regions separately and find their intersection.First, let&#39;s consider the region a^2 + b^2 ≤ 5. That&#39;s straightforward: it&#39;s a disk centered at the origin with radius sqrt(5).Next, the inequality a^2 + b^2 ≤ 4a - 2b. Let me rearrange this to put it into standard circle form. Let&#39;s move the 4a and -2b to the left side:a^2 - 4a + b^2 + 2b ≤ 0.Now, complete the square for the a terms and the b terms.For a: a^2 - 4a = (a^2 - 4a + 4) - 4 = (a - 2)^2 - 4.For b: b^2 + 2b = (b^2 + 2b + 1) - 1 = (b + 1)^2 - 1.So substituting back into the inequality:(a - 2)^2 - 4 + (b + 1)^2 - 1 ≤ 0Simplify:(a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 - 5 ≤ 0Which becomes:(a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 ≤ 5.So, the inequality a^2 + b^2 ≤ 4a - 2b represents a disk centered at (2, -1) with radius sqrt(5).Therefore, the set of allowable centers (a, b) is the intersection of two disks: one centered at (0, 0) with radius sqrt(5), and the other centered at (2, -1) with the same radius sqrt(5). So, the region of allowable (a, b) is the overlap between these two disks.Now, to find the figure M, which is the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points (a, b) in this overlapping region. So, essentially, M is the Minkowski sum of the region of allowable centers (a, b) with a disk of radius sqrt(5). But since the allowable centers are themselves disks, I need to be careful here. Wait, maybe not exactly the Minkowski sum, because each center (a, b) contributes a circle around itself. So, the union of all such circles would be the set of points (x, y) such that the distance from (x, y) to some (a, b) in the intersection of the two disks is at most sqrt(5). Alternatively, this is equivalent to the intersection of the two disks (for centers (a, b)) expanded by a radius of sqrt(5). So, perhaps it&#39;s like taking the Minkowski sum of the intersection region with a disk of radius sqrt(5). But I need to verify this.Alternatively, maybe think of it as the set of points (x, y) such that there exists (a, b) in the intersection of the two disks, and (x, y) is in the disk around (a, b). So, the union of all such disks. So, the figure M is the set of points (x, y) such that the distance from (x, y) to the intersection of the two disks (centered at (0,0) and (2, -1)) is at most sqrt(5). But that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think.Alternatively, since each center (a, b) is in the intersection of the two disks, then the union of all circles centered at those (a, b) with radius sqrt(5) is the same as the union of all points within sqrt(5) of some point in the intersection of the two disks. So, in other words, M is the intersection of the two disks (for centers) &quot;expanded&quot; by a radius of sqrt(5). So, in mathematical terms, M would be the intersection of the two original disks (which were constraints on a and b), each expanded by sqrt(5). But how do I compute that?Wait, perhaps not. Let me rephrase. The original two disks are constraints on the centers (a, b). Then, for each such center, we draw a disk of radius sqrt(5) around them. The union of all such disks is M. So, M is equivalent to all points (x, y) such that there exists a point (a, b) in the intersection of the two original disks (the intersection of the disk centered at (0,0) radius sqrt(5) and the disk centered at (2, -1) radius sqrt(5)), and (x, y) lies within sqrt(5) of (a, b). Therefore, this is equivalent to the union of all disks of radius sqrt(5) centered at points of the intersection of the two original disks. But this seems complex. Is there a better way to think about this?Alternatively, since the original two disks (for a, b) have centers (0,0) and (2, -1) and radius sqrt(5), their intersection is a lens-shaped region. Then, when we take the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) around points in this lens, the resulting figure M would be the union of all such circles. But this might end up being the union of the two larger disks, but I need to verify.Wait, for example, if you have two overlapping disks (for centers (a, b)), then taking the union of all circles of radius r around each point in the overlapping region—is that equivalent to the union of the two original disks each expanded by r? Not exactly. Wait, no, because each center (a, b) is in the intersection, so when you take a circle around each such center, it&#39;s not just expanding each original disk, but taking all points within r of the intersection region.Alternatively, perhaps M is the Minkowski sum of the intersection of the two original disks with a disk of radius sqrt(5). Since the Minkowski sum of a set A and a disk of radius r is the set of all points that are within r of some point in A. Which is exactly what M is. Therefore, M is the Minkowski sum of the intersection of the two original disks (which are each radius sqrt(5)) with another disk of radius sqrt(5). So, the Minkowski sum would effectively expand the original intersection region by sqrt(5). However, since the original intersection is a lens shape, expanding it by sqrt(5) would result in a shape that is the union of the expanded original disks?Wait, perhaps. Let me think. If I have two overlapping disks, A and B, each of radius R. Their intersection is the lens. Then the Minkowski sum of the lens with a disk of radius r would be the union of the Minkowski sums of each original disk with the disk of radius r, intersected appropriately? Wait, no. The Minkowski sum is distributive over unions, but not over intersections. So, the Minkowski sum of (A ∩ B) with a disk is a subset of the intersection of (A + disk) and (B + disk). Hmm, this might be more complicated.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way. Let&#39;s first figure out the region of allowable centers (a, b). Then, figure out the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) around those centers.Alternatively, note that for each (a, b) in the intersection of the two original disks, we include all points (x, y) such that (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 ≤ 5. Therefore, the figure M is the set of all (x, y) such that there exists (a, b) with:1. (a)^2 + (b)^2 ≤ 5,2. (a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 ≤ 5,3. (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 ≤ 5.So, we can think of this as the projection onto the (x, y) plane of the set of points (x, y, a, b) satisfying all three inequalities. But since a and b are existentially quantified, we need to find all (x, y) such that there exists (a, b) in the intersection of the two disks, and (x, y) is within sqrt(5) of (a, b).Alternatively, if we fix (x, y), then (a, b) must lie in the intersection of the two original disks and also lie in the disk of radius sqrt(5) centered at (x, y). So, (x, y) is in M if and only if the disk of radius sqrt(5) around (x, y) intersects the intersection of the two original disks.But this seems abstract. Maybe a better approach is to find the region M by considering the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points (a, b) in the intersection of the two original disks. So, since the original disks (for a, b) are each radius sqrt(5), centered at (0, 0) and (2, -1). Their intersection is the region where both inequalities hold. The union of all circles around these points would then be the area covered by all such circles.But perhaps there is a smarter way. Let me consider the distance between the centers of the two original disks. The distance between (0, 0) and (2, -1) is sqrt((2 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So, the two original disks (for a, b) each have radius sqrt(5) and their centers are sqrt(5) apart. Therefore, the intersection of these two disks is a lens-shaped region where each disk covers exactly half of the other. Wait, when two circles of radius r are separated by distance d, the area of intersection is 2r² cos⁻¹(d/(2r)) - (d/2)√(4r² - d²). In our case, r = sqrt(5), d = sqrt(5). So, let&#39;s compute that.But maybe that&#39;s not necessary right now. Let me first visualize the two disks for (a, b). Each has radius sqrt(5), and their centers are sqrt(5) apart. Therefore, they intersect each other such that the center of each lies on the circumference of the other. Because the distance between centers is sqrt(5), and each radius is sqrt(5). So, each center is on the edge of the other disk. Therefore, the intersection of the two disks is a lens where each disk cuts the other exactly at the center. Therefore, the area of overlap is the area of two circular segments.But perhaps this is a key point. Since each center is on the boundary of the other disk, the intersection region is a lens where each disk contributes a 60-degree sector or something? Wait, let me compute the angle. The distance between centers is sqrt(5), radius of each is sqrt(5). So, in the triangle formed by the two centers and one of the intersection points, all sides are sqrt(5). So, it&#39;s an equilateral triangle. Therefore, the angle between the centers as viewed from an intersection point is 60 degrees, which is π/3 radians.Therefore, the area of intersection between the two disks is 2 * ( (π/3) * r² / 2 - (sqrt(3)/4) * r² ), but wait, the standard formula for the area of intersection of two circles with radius r separated by distance d is 2r² cos⁻¹(d/(2r)) - (d/2)√(4r² - d²). Let&#39;s compute that.Given r = sqrt(5), d = sqrt(5):First term: 2r² cos⁻¹(d/(2r)) = 2*(5)*cos⁻¹(sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5))) = 10*cos⁻¹(1/2) = 10*(π/3) = (10π)/3.Second term: (d/2)*sqrt(4r² - d²) = (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(20 - 5) = (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(15) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(15))/2 = (sqrt(75))/2 = (5*sqrt(3))/2.Therefore, the area of intersection is (10π)/3 - (5*sqrt(3))/2. But perhaps we don&#39;t need the area of the intersection of the original disks, but maybe this will be helpful later.But returning to the problem: figure M is the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points (a, b) in the intersection of the two original disks. So, what does this union look like?Alternatively, perhaps we can think of M as the union of two larger disks. Wait, if we consider that each original disk (for a, b) is being expanded by sqrt(5), but since the original disks are already radius sqrt(5), expanding them by sqrt(5) would result in disks of radius 2*sqrt(5). But this might not be correct because the expansion depends on the centers.Wait, no. If we take all points within sqrt(5) of the original disk (radius sqrt(5)), then the resulting figure is a disk of radius sqrt(5) + sqrt(5) = 2*sqrt(5). But that&#39;s only if the original set is a single disk. However, if the original set is the intersection of two disks, expanding that by sqrt(5) would result in the intersection of the two expanded disks. Wait, is that the case?Wait, the Minkowski sum of the intersection of two sets with a disk is contained within the intersection of the Minkowski sums of each set with the disk. So, M = (A ∩ B) ⊕ D ⊆ (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D). But equality doesn&#39;t necessarily hold. However, in some cases, maybe here, due to the specific positions and radii, the Minkowski sum of the intersection might be equal to the intersection of the Minkowski sums. Let me check.Original disks A and B for (a, b):A: centered at (0, 0), radius sqrt(5).B: centered at (2, -1), radius sqrt(5).Their intersection is the lens shape. The Minkowski sum of A ∩ B with a disk D of radius sqrt(5) is M.Alternatively, the Minkowski sum of A with D is A ⊕ D, which is a disk of radius sqrt(5) + sqrt(5) = 2*sqrt(5) centered at (0, 0).Similarly, the Minkowski sum of B with D is a disk of radius 2*sqrt(5) centered at (2, -1).Therefore, (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D) would be the intersection of two large disks of radius 2*sqrt(5) centered at (0,0) and (2, -1). However, M is the Minkowski sum of (A ∩ B) with D. So, in general, (A ∩ B) ⊕ D ⊆ (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D). But is the converse true? Probably not. Therefore, M is a subset of the intersection of the two larger disks. However, it might not be the entire intersection.But perhaps in this specific case, since the original centers (0,0) and (2, -1) are sqrt(5) apart, and the expansion radius is sqrt(5), maybe M is exactly the intersection of the two larger disks (radius 2*sqrt(5)). Let me check.Suppose (x, y) is in the intersection of the two larger disks:1. x² + y² ≤ (2*sqrt(5))² = 202. (x - 2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 ≤ 20Is every such point in M? That is, for any (x, y) in this intersection, does there exist (a, b) in A ∩ B such that (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 ≤ 5?Alternatively, can we parameterize (a, b) as a point along the line segment connecting (0,0) and (2, -1), since the original centers are sqrt(5) apart? Let me consider that.Let’s consider that the intersection of the original disks A and B is the lens-shaped region. The line connecting their centers is from (0, 0) to (2, -1). The intersection points of the two original disks can be found by solving the equations:1. a² + b² = 52. (a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 = 5Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:(a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 - a² - b² = 0Expanding:a² -4a +4 + b² + 2b +1 -a² -b² = 0Simplify:-4a + 2b +5 = 0So, -4a + 2b = -5 =&gt; 4a - 2b =5.Thus, the line of intersection is 4a - 2b =5. Wait, but in the original problem, the second inequality was a² + b² ≤ min(4a -2b,5). Wait, now I see. So, the intersection of the two disks is the region where a² + b² ≤5 and 4a -2b ≥5. Wait, but the original problem states a² + b² ≤ min(4a -2b,5). So, that means a² + b² ≤4a -2b and a² + b² ≤5. But the first inequality (a² + b² ≤4a -2b) is equivalent to (a -2)^2 + (b +1)^2 ≤5. So, indeed, the region for (a, b) is the intersection of the two disks. But in solving for the intersection points, we found that the line 4a -2b=5 is the radical axis of the two circles. So, the intersection points lie on this line. Let&#39;s find the actual points.We have the two equations:1. a² + b² =52. 4a -2b=5Let me solve these simultaneously. From equation 2: 4a -2b =5 =&gt; 2b =4a -5 =&gt; b = 2a -5/2. Substitute into equation 1:a² + (2a -5/2)^2 =5Expand:a² +4a² -10a +25/4 =5Combine terms:5a² -10a +25/4 -5 =0Convert 5 to 20/4:5a² -10a +25/4 -20/4 =0 =&gt; 5a² -10a +5/4=0Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions:20a² -40a +5=0Divide by 5:4a² -8a +1=0Quadratic equation: a = [8 ± sqrt(64 -16)] /8 = [8 ± sqrt(48)]/8 = [8 ± 4*sqrt(3)]/8 = [2 ± sqrt(3)]/2Thus, a = (2 + sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (2 +1.732)/2≈1.866, or a=(2 - sqrt(3))/2 ≈(2 -1.732)/2≈0.134.Then, b=2a -5/2. Let&#39;s compute for a=(2 + sqrt(3))/2:b=2*(2 + sqrt(3))/2 -5/2 = (2 + sqrt(3)) -5/2 = (4/2 + sqrt(3)) -5/2 = (-1/2 + sqrt(3)) ≈ -0.5 +1.732≈1.232Similarly, for a=(2 - sqrt(3))/2:b=2*(2 - sqrt(3))/2 -5/2 = (2 - sqrt(3)) -5/2 = (4/2 - sqrt(3)) -5/2 = (-1/2 - sqrt(3))≈ -0.5 -1.732≈-2.232So, the two intersection points are approximately (1.866,1.232) and (0.134,-2.232). But let&#39;s write them exactly:Intersection points are:( (2 + sqrt(3))/2 , -1/2 + sqrt(3) )and( (2 - sqrt(3))/2 , -1/2 - sqrt(3) )These are the points where the two original circles intersect.Now, the region (a, b) is the intersection of the two disks. So, it&#39;s a lens shape with these two points as the intersection points.Now, going back to figure M: the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points in this lens-shaped region. To find the area of M, perhaps we can find the Minkowski sum of the lens with the disk of radius sqrt(5). However, calculating the area of a Minkowski sum can be complex. But in some cases, the Minkowski sum of two convex sets is the convex hull, but here we are dealing with non-convex sets? Wait, the lens shape is actually convex? Wait, the intersection of two convex sets is convex. So, since both disks are convex, their intersection is convex. Therefore, the Minkowski sum of a convex set (the lens) with a convex set (the disk) is also convex.But perhaps more importantly, since we are taking the Minkowski sum of the lens with a disk of radius sqrt(5), the resulting set M is the union of all points within sqrt(5) of the lens. However, the original disks (for a, b) already have radius sqrt(5), so the Minkowski sum would be the union of all points within sqrt(5) of the intersection of the two original disks.Alternatively, think of it this way: If the centers (a, b) are restricted to the lens-shaped intersection of the two original disks, then the union of circles around these centers would cover all points that are within sqrt(5) of any point in the lens. However, since the lens itself is the overlap of two disks of radius sqrt(5), expanding it by another sqrt(5) would effectively create the union of the two original disks each expanded by sqrt(5). Wait, but expanding the lens (which is the intersection) by sqrt(5) might not be the same as expanding each original disk and then taking the intersection.Wait, perhaps there is a property here. If we have two sets A and B, then (A ∩ B) ⊕ D ⊆ (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D). But in our case, perhaps equality holds? Let me check with an example.Suppose A and B are two overlapping disks, and D is another disk. Then, the Minkowski sum of their intersection with D would be the set of all points within D of the intersection. However, the intersection of the Minkowski sums would be the set of points that are within D of A and within D of B. So, if a point is within D of both A and B, is it necessarily within D of their intersection? Not necessarily. For example, if you have two overlapping disks A and B, a point could be near A but far from B, and near B but far from A, but near both in different regions. However, if the expansion radius is large enough, perhaps the two Minkowski sums overlap sufficiently. But in our case, since the original disks are each radius sqrt(5) and separated by sqrt(5), expanding them by sqrt(5) would result in two disks of radius 2*sqrt(5) whose centers are sqrt(5) apart. The intersection of these two expanded disks might be exactly the Minkowski sum of the original intersection with D.Wait, let&#39;s compute the distance between the centers of the two expanded disks. The centers are still (0,0) and (2, -1), separated by sqrt(5). The radius of each expanded disk is 2*sqrt(5). The distance between centers is sqrt(5), which is less than the sum of the radii (2*sqrt(5) + 2*sqrt(5) = 4*sqrt(5)), so they definitely overlap. The intersection of these two large disks would be another lens-shaped region. But is this the same as the Minkowski sum of the original lens with D?Alternatively, maybe since the original lens was the intersection of two disks of radius sqrt(5), expanding each of those disks by sqrt(5) would lead to the expanded disks (radius 2*sqrt(5)), and their intersection is the region that is within 2*sqrt(5) of both original centers. However, M is the set of points within sqrt(5) of the lens (original intersection). So, perhaps the Minkowski sum is equal to the intersection of the expanded disks. Let me verify.Suppose a point is in the Minkowski sum of the lens with D. Then, it is within sqrt(5) of some point in the lens. Since the lens is within both original disks, the point is within sqrt(5) of a point in A ∩ B, so it must be within sqrt(5) + sqrt(5) = 2*sqrt(5) of both centers (0,0) and (2, -1). Therefore, it&#39;s in both expanded disks. Thus, M ⊆ (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D).Conversely, suppose a point is in the intersection of the expanded disks. Then, it is within 2*sqrt(5) of both (0,0) and (2, -1). Does that imply that it is within sqrt(5) of some point in the lens (A ∩ B)? Let&#39;s see. Let me consider the point (x, y) such that x² + y² ≤ 20 and (x - 2)^2 + (x +1)^2 ≤20. Then, is there a point (a, b) in the original lens such that (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 ≤5?Alternatively, consider that for any point (x, y) in the intersection of the two expanded disks, the distance from (x, y) to both (0,0) and (2, -1) is at most 2*sqrt(5). Then, we need to find a point (a, b) that is in the original lens (i.e., within sqrt(5) of both (0,0) and (2, -1)) such that (x, y) is within sqrt(5) of (a, b). This seems like a question of whether the intersection of the two expanded disks is the same as the Minkowski sum of the original lens with D.But I need a better approach. Let&#39;s think geometrically. The original lens (for a, b) is the intersection of two disks of radius sqrt(5) separated by sqrt(5). When we take all points within sqrt(5) of this lens, what do we get?Imagine the lens is the overlapping region of two circles. Expanding each point in the lens by sqrt(5) would cover all points that are within sqrt(5) of any point in the lens. But since the lens is itself within each of the original disks, expanding it would cover areas beyond each original disk. However, since the expansion radius is equal to the original radius, the Minkowski sum would result in the union of two disks of radius 2*sqrt(5), but only overlapping appropriately. Wait, but perhaps no. Let&#39;s consider specific points.Take the point (0,0). It is in the original lens? Wait, (0,0) is the center of one disk. Is it in the other disk? The other disk is centered at (2, -1) with radius sqrt(5). The distance from (0,0) to (2, -1) is sqrt(5), so (0,0) is on the boundary of the other disk. Therefore, (0,0) is in the intersection of the two disks (since a² + b² =0 ≤5 and (0 -2)^2 + (0 +1)^2 =4 +1=5 ≤5). Similarly, the point (2, -1) is also in the intersection. Therefore, both original centers are in the lens.Therefore, when we take the Minkowski sum of the lens with a disk of radius sqrt(5), the resulting figure M will include the original disks expanded by sqrt(5) around both (0,0) and (2, -1). But since the lens includes points in between, expanding those points would fill in the area between the two expanded disks. So, actually, the Minkowski sum would be the convex hull of the two expanded disks? Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, take a point midway between (0,0) and (2, -1). The midpoint is (1, -0.5). The distance from the midpoint to each center is sqrt(5)/2 ≈1.118. Since the original disks have radius sqrt(5)≈2.236, the midpoint is well within both original disks. Therefore, the midpoint (1, -0.5) is in the lens. Expanding this point by a disk of radius sqrt(5) would cover a large area around it. Therefore, the union of all such circles would cover the area between the two expanded disks and possibly form a shape that is the union of the two expanded disks. Wait, but if the original lens is the intersection of the two original disks, and we take all points within sqrt(5) of that lens, that might actually be equal to the intersection of the two expanded disks. Wait, let me verify.Suppose we have two original disks A and B with radius r, centers separated by d. Then, their intersection is the lens. The Minkowski sum of this lens with a disk of radius R would be the set of all points within R of the lens. On the other hand, the intersection of the Minkowski sums of A and B each with the disk of radius R would be the set of points within R of both A and B. In our case, R = r = sqrt(5), and d = sqrt(5). So, the Minkowski sum of A with D is a disk of radius 2*sqrt(5) centered at (0,0), and similarly for B. The intersection of these two expanded disks would be the set of points within 2*sqrt(5) of both (0,0) and (2, -1). The distance between the centers of the expanded disks is still sqrt(5), so the intersection of the two expanded disks is another lens-shaped region, larger than the original lens.But is this the same as the Minkowski sum of the original lens with D?In general, the Minkowski sum of the intersection (A ∩ B) with D is a subset of the intersection (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D). But equality holds if for every point x in (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D), there exists points a ∈ A and b ∈ B such that x = a + d1 = b + d2, with d1, d2 ∈ D, and a and b are in the intersection A ∩ B. Which might not necessarily hold. So, it&#39;s possible that M = (A ∩ B) ⊕ D is a proper subset of (A ⊕ D) ∩ (B ⊕ D).However, in our specific case, with the centers separated by sqrt(5) and radius sqrt(5), maybe the two concepts coincide. Let me test with a specific point. Take the midpoint between the two expanded disks, say (1, -0.5). This point is in both expanded disks because its distance to (0,0) is sqrt(1² + (-0.5)²) = sqrt(1.25) ≈1.118 &lt; 2*sqrt(5)≈4.472, and distance to (2, -1) is sqrt((2 -1)^2 + (-1 +0.5)^2) = sqrt(1 +0.25)=sqrt(1.25)≈1.118 &lt;4.472. So, the midpoint is in the intersection of the two expanded disks. Is the midpoint in M? That is, is there a point (a, b) in the original lens such that the midpoint is within sqrt(5) of (a, b)?Since (a, b) is in the original lens, which is the intersection of the two original disks. So, (a, b) is within sqrt(5) of both (0,0) and (2, -1). Let&#39;s take (a, b) as the midpoint of the original centers, which is (1, -0.5). Wait, but (1, -0.5) is in the original lens? Let&#39;s check: distance from (1, -0.5) to (0,0) is sqrt(1 +0.25)=sqrt(1.25)≈1.118 &lt; sqrt(5). Similarly, distance to (2, -1) is same. So, yes, (1, -0.5) is in the original lens. Then, the circle around (1, -0.5) with radius sqrt(5) would include the midpoint (1, -0.5) itself, which is trivially in M. Wait, but maybe I need a different example.Take a point on the edge of the expanded disk, say (2*sqrt(5), 0). This is on the boundary of the expanded disk around (0,0). Is this point in M? For (2*sqrt(5), 0) to be in M, there must exist (a, b) in the original lens such that (2*sqrt(5) -a)^2 + (0 - b)^2 ≤5. But (a, b) is in the original lens, so a² + b² ≤5 and (a -2)^2 + (b +1)^2 ≤5. Let&#39;s see if such (a, b) exists. Let&#39;s set a = 2*sqrt(5) - x and b = y, where x² + y² ≤5. Wait, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, assume (a, b) is along the line connecting (0,0) and (2*sqrt(5),0). Let&#39;s see.Wait, (2*sqrt(5),0) is quite far from the original lens. The original lens is between (0,0) and (2, -1). The distance from (2*sqrt(5),0) to (0,0) is 2*sqrt(5), which is the radius of the expanded disk. The distance from (2*sqrt(5),0) to (2, -1) is sqrt((2*sqrt(5) -2)^2 + (0 +1)^2). Let&#39;s compute:(2*sqrt(5) -2)^2 +1 = (2(sqrt(5) -1))^2 +1 =4(sqrt(5)-1)^2 +1=4*(5 -2*sqrt(5) +1)+1=4*(6 -2*sqrt(5)) +1=24 -8*sqrt(5) +1=25 -8*sqrt(5)≈25 -8*2.236≈25 -17.888≈7.112. So, sqrt(7.112)≈2.666, which is less than 2*sqrt(5)≈4.472. So, (2*sqrt(5),0) is in the intersection of the two expanded disks. But does it belong to M?To check if (2*sqrt(5),0) is in M, we need to find (a, b) in the original lens such that (2*sqrt(5) -a)^2 + (0 - b)^2 ≤5. Let&#39;s suppose such (a, b) exists. Then:(2*sqrt(5) -a)^2 + b² ≤5.But (a, b) is in the original lens, so a² + b² ≤5 and (a -2)^2 + (b +1)^2 ≤5.Let me consider the maximum possible value of (2*sqrt(5) -a)^2 + b² for (a, b) in the original lens. To maximize this expression, we need to minimize a and maximize b, but subject to a² + b² ≤5. Wait, but (a -2)^2 + (b +1)^2 ≤5 as well. It&#39;s complicated. Maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize (2*sqrt(5) -a)^2 + b² subject to the constraints a² + b² ≤5 and (a -2)^2 + (b +1)^2 ≤5.Alternatively, maybe such a point (2*sqrt(5), 0) is not in M. For example, take (a, b) near (0,0). Then, (2*sqrt(5) -a)^2 + b² ≈ (2*sqrt(5))^2 +0=20, which is way larger than 5. If (a, b) is near (2, -1), then (2*sqrt(5) -2)^2 + (-1 -0)^2≈(2*2.236 -2)^2 +1≈(4.472 -2)^2 +1≈(2.472)^2 +1≈6.11 +1=7.11, which is also greater than 5. If (a, b) is somewhere in between, maybe the distance is still larger than sqrt(5). For example, take (a, b)=(1, -0.5), then (2*sqrt(5)-1)^2 + (0.5)^2≈(4.472 -1)^2 +0.25≈(3.472)^2 +0.25≈12.06 +0.25≈12.31 &gt;5. So, in all cases, the distance from (2*sqrt(5),0) to any (a, b) in the lens is greater than sqrt(5). Therefore, (2*sqrt(5),0) is not in M, even though it is in the intersection of the two expanded disks. Therefore, M is a proper subset of the intersection of the two expanded disks.Therefore, my initial thought that M is the intersection of the two expanded disks is incorrect. Therefore, I need another approach.Perhaps parameterize (a, b) and (x, y). Let&#39;s consider the system:1. (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 ≤52. a² + b² ≤53. (a -2)^2 + (b +1)^2 ≤5Our goal is to find all (x, y) such that there exists (a, b) satisfying these three inequalities.Alternatively, for each (x, y), we can consider the set of (a, b) that satisfy (x -a)^2 + (y -b)^2 ≤5 and also are in the intersection of the two original disks. The existence of such (a, b) is required for (x, y) to be in M.Alternatively, we can think of this as a projection problem: projecting the set of (a, b, x, y) satisfying all three inequalities onto the (x, y) plane. But this is abstract. Alternatively, we can use the concept of distance geometry.Another approach: For a given (x, y), what is the minimal distance to a point (a, b) in the intersection of the two original disks? If this minimal distance is ≤ sqrt(5), then (x, y) is in M. Therefore, M is the set of all points (x, y) whose distance to the lens (intersection of two original disks) is ≤ sqrt(5). Therefore, M is the union of all closed balls of radius sqrt(5) centered at points of the lens.Computing the area of such a set can be done using the formula:Area = Area of the lens + Perimeter of the lens * sqrt(5) + π*(sqrt(5))²Wait, no, that formula is for the Minkowski sum of a convex set with a disk, which is Area(A) + Perimeter(A)*r + π*r². But is the lens convex? Yes, because the intersection of two convex sets (disks) is convex. Therefore, the Minkowski sum of the convex lens with a disk of radius sqrt(5) would indeed have an area equal to Area(lens) + Perimeter(lens)*sqrt(5) + π*(sqrt(5))².But let&#39;s confirm this formula. For a convex set A, the area of A ⊕ D(r) is Area(A) + Perimeter(A)*r + πr². This is because when you take the Minkowski sum, you&#39;re adding a &quot;buffer&quot; around A of width r, which contributes the perimeter times r (the area of the &quot;sides&quot;) and the area of the disk at the end, but since it&#39;s a buffer around the entire shape, it&#39;s actually the area of the disk (πr²) added for each &quot;direction&quot;. Wait, no, this formula is actually correct for polygons, but for smooth convex sets, the perimeter term is still applicable. So, perhaps for the convex lens, this formula holds.Given that, if we can compute the area and perimeter of the lens, then we can compute the area of M.Earlier, we computed the area of the lens as (10π)/3 - (5√3)/2. Let me confirm that:Using the formula for the area of intersection of two circles:Area = 2r² cos⁻¹(d/(2r)) - (d/2)√(4r² - d²)With r = sqrt(5), d = sqrt(5):Area = 2*(5)*cos⁻¹(sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5))) - (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(4*5 -5)Simplify:= 10*cos⁻¹(1/2) - (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(15)= 10*(π/3) - (sqrt(5)*sqrt(15))/2= (10π)/3 - (sqrt(75))/2= (10π)/3 - (5*sqrt(3))/2Yes, correct.Now, the perimeter of the lens. The perimeter of a lens formed by two intersecting circles is the sum of the arc lengths of the two circles within the lens. For each circle, the arc length is 2rθ, where θ is the angle subtended by the chord at the center.We already found earlier that the angle subtended by the chord at each center is π/3 radians (60 degrees), since the triangle formed by the centers and an intersection point is equilateral (all sides sqrt(5)). Therefore, each circle contributes an arc length of 2*sqrt(5)*(π/3). Since there are two circles, the total perimeter of the lens is 2*(2*sqrt(5)*(π/3)) = (4*sqrt(5)*π)/3.Wait, but wait, actually, each circle contributes an arc. For each circle, the angle is θ = 2*cos⁻¹(d/(2r)). In our case, d = sqrt(5), r = sqrt(5), so d/(2r) = 1/2. Therefore, θ = 2*cos⁻¹(1/2) = 2*(π/3) = 2π/3. Therefore, the arc length for each circle is r*θ = sqrt(5)*(2π/3). Since there are two circles, the total perimeter is 2*(sqrt(5)*(2π/3)) = (4*sqrt(5)*π)/3.Therefore, the perimeter of the lens is (4*sqrt(5)*π)/3.Thus, the area of M is:Area(M) = Area(lens) + Perimeter(lens)*sqrt(5) + π*(sqrt(5))²Plugging in the values:Area(lens) = (10π)/3 - (5√3)/2Perimeter(lens) = (4*sqrt(5)*π)/3sqrt(5) term: multiply perimeter by sqrt(5):(4*sqrt(5)*π)/3 * sqrt(5) = (4*5*π)/3 = (20π)/3π*(sqrt(5))² = π*5 =5πTherefore, total Area(M):(10π/3 -5√3/2) +20π/3 +5πCombine the π terms:10π/3 +20π/3 +5π = (30π/3) +5π =10π +5π=15πThen subtract the 5√3/2 term:15π - (5√3)/2Therefore, Area(M) =15π - (5√3)/2.But wait, is this correct? Let me check the formula again.The formula for the Minkowski sum of a convex set with a disk is:Area(A ⊕ D(r)) = Area(A) + Perimeter(A)*r + πr²Yes. So, in our case, r = sqrt(5), Area(A) = (10π)/3 - (5√3)/2, Perimeter(A) = (4*sqrt(5)*π)/3.Therefore:Area(M) = (10π/3 -5√3/2) + (4*sqrt(5)*π)/3*sqrt(5) +π*(sqrt(5))²Simplify the terms:Second term: (4*sqrt(5)*π)/3*sqrt(5)=4*(sqrt(5))^2*π/3=4*5*π/3=20π/3Third term: π*5=5πTherefore:Area(M)=10π/3 -5√3/2 +20π/3 +5π= (10π +20π)/3 +5π -5√3/2=30π/3 +5π -5√3/2=10π +5π -5√3/2=15π - (5√3)/2Yes, that&#39;s correct. Therefore, the area of figure M is15π - (5√3)/2.But let me verify with another approach. Suppose we consider that M is the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points in the lens. The area would then be the area of the lens multiplied by the area contribution from each circle, but this is not straightforward due to overlapping.However, using the Minkowski sum formula, assuming the lens is convex, which it is, then the formula should hold. Thus, the area is15π - (5√3)/2.But let me confirm this by considering the components:The Minkowski sum adds three components:1. The original area of the lens.2. A &quot;buffer&quot; around the perimeter of the lens, which is like a rectangular strip of width sqrt(5), contributing Perimeter * sqrt(5).3. The area of the disk added at the ends, which is π*(sqrt(5))². Wait, no, actually, when you take the Minkowski sum of a convex set with a disk, the area is the original area plus the perimeter times the radius plus π times the radius squared. This accounts for the &quot;extrusion&quot; of the perimeter and the rounded ends. However, in the case of a convex polygon, the formula holds, but for a smooth convex set, it&#39;s similar.But in our case, the original lens is a convex set with area (10π/3 -5√3/2) and perimeter (4*sqrt(5)π)/3. Therefore, the formula gives us the total area as:Area = (10π/3 -5√3/2) + (4*sqrt(5)π)/3*sqrt(5) + π*5Which simplifies to:10π/3 -5√3/2 + 20π/3 +5π = (10π +20π)/3 +5π -5√3/2 = 30π/3 +5π -5√3/2 =10π +5π -5√3/2 =15π -5√3/2Yes, so the area is15π - (5√3)/2.But let&#39;s check if this makes sense. The area of the Minkowski sum is larger than the area of the expanded disks. For example, each expanded disk has area π*(2*sqrt(5))²=20π. The intersection of two expanded disks would be less than 20π, but according to our result, M has an area of15π - (5√3)/2≈15*3.1416 - (5*1.732)/2≈47.123 -4.33≈42.793. The area of each expanded disk is20π≈62.83, so the intersection would be less, but our result is ~42.79, which seems plausible.Alternatively, if we compute the area of the intersection of the two expanded disks, which are each radius 2*sqrt(5), separated by sqrt(5):Using the formula for intersection area:2*(20)*cos⁻¹(sqrt(5)/(2*2*sqrt(5))) - (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(4*(20) - (sqrt(5))²)Simplify:First term: 40*cos⁻¹( (sqrt(5)/ (4*sqrt(5))) ) =40*cos⁻¹(1/4)Second term: (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(80 -5)= (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(75)= (sqrt(5)/2)*(5*sqrt(3))= (5*sqrt(15))/2≈5*3.872/2≈9.68Therefore, Area=40*cos⁻¹(1/4) -9.68cos⁻¹(1/4)≈1.318 radiansThus, 40*1.318≈52.72 -9.68≈43.04Which is close to our previous result of≈42.79. The difference arises because M is a subset of the intersection of the expanded disks. But the two results are close, which might indicate an error in the application of the Minkowski sum formula.Wait, but according to our earlier example, the point (2*sqrt(5),0) is in the intersection of the expanded disks but not in M, so the area of M should be less than the area of the intersection. However, according to our Minkowski sum calculation, the area is ~15π -5√3/2≈42.79, while the intersection area is ~43.04. These are very close, suggesting that perhaps the difference is within computational error, but actually, the Minkowski sum should be a subset, so its area should be smaller. Therefore, there might be an error in assuming the Minkowski sum formula applies directly.Alternatively, maybe the formula is applicable here, and the slight discrepancy is due to approximation. However, the key point is that the area of M is15π - (5√3)/2. Let&#39;s verify this with another approach.Another way to think about M is that it&#39;s the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) whose centers lie in the intersection of the two original disks. The intersection of the two original disks is a lens, and the union of circles around that lens with radius sqrt(5) is the Minkowski sum.Given that the original lens is convex, the Minkowski sum with a disk is the same as the offset of the lens by sqrt(5). The offset of a convex set is indeed its Minkowski sum with a disk, and the area formula applies. Therefore, the area should be correct.Alternatively, since the problem is likely expecting an answer expressed in terms of pi and sqrt(3), the answer15π - (5√3)/2 seems plausible.Therefore, after careful consideration and applying the Minkowski sum area formula, I conclude that the area of figure M is15π - (5√3)/2.Final AnswerThe area of the figure ( M ) is (boxed{15pi - dfrac{5sqrt{3}}{2}}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the area of the figure ( M ), we need to analyze the given system of inequalities:1. ((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 leq 5)2. (a^2 + b^2 leq min(4a - 2b, 5))First, we interpret the second inequality. The condition (a^2 + b^2 leq 5) represents a disk centered at the origin with radius (sqrt{5}). The condition (a^2 + b^2 leq 4a - 2b) can be rewritten as ((a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 leq 5), which represents a disk centered at ((2, -1)) with radius (sqrt{5}).The intersection of these two disks forms a lens-shaped region. The distance between the centers of these disks is (sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2} = sqrt{5}). Since each disk has a radius of (sqrt{5}), the intersection region is a lens where each disk cuts the other exactly at the center.Next, we consider the figure ( M ), which is the union of all circles of radius (sqrt{5}) centered at points ((a, b)) in this lens-shaped region. This is equivalent to the Minkowski sum of the lens-shaped region with a disk of radius (sqrt{5}).To find the area of ( M ), we use the formula for the Minkowski sum of a convex set with a disk. The area of the Minkowski sum is given by:[text{Area}(M) = text{Area}(text{lens}) + text{Perimeter}(text{lens}) cdot sqrt{5} + pi (sqrt{5})^2]1. Area of the lens: The area of the intersection of two disks of radius (sqrt{5}) separated by (sqrt{5}) is calculated as:   [   text{Area} = 2 cdot 5 cdot cos^{-1}left(frac{sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}}right) - frac{sqrt{5}}{2} sqrt{4 cdot 5 - (sqrt{5})^2} = frac{10pi}{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}   ]2. Perimeter of the lens: The perimeter is the sum of the arc lengths of the two circles forming the lens. Each arc length is (2sqrt{5} cdot frac{pi}{3}), leading to:   [   text{Perimeter} = frac{4sqrt{5}pi}{3}   ]3. Calculating the Minkowski sum area:   [   text{Area}(M) = left(frac{10pi}{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}right) + left(frac{4sqrt{5}pi}{3} cdot sqrt{5}right) + pi cdot 5   ]   Simplifying the terms:   [   text{Area}(M) = left(frac{10pi}{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}right) + frac{20pi}{3} + 5pi = 15pi - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}   ]Thus, the area of the figure ( M ) is (boxed{15pi - dfrac{5sqrt{3}}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the area of figure M on the Cartesian plane. The figure M consists of all points (x, y) such that there exist real numbers a and b satisfying two inequalities:1. ((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 leq 5)2. (a^2 + b^2 leq min(4a - 2b, 5))Hmm, let me parse this. For each point (x, y) in M, there must be some a and b such that (a, b) is within a circle of radius sqrt(5) centered at (x, y), and also (a, b) lies within the region defined by (a^2 + b^2 leq min(4a - 2b, 5)). So, essentially, figure M is the union of all circles centered at (a, b) with radius sqrt(5), where (a, b) satisfies the second inequality. Therefore, M is the set of all points that are within sqrt(5) distance from some point (a, b) that lies in the region defined by (a^2 + b^2 leq min(4a - 2b, 5)). To visualize this, I think I need to first understand the region where (a, b) can lie. The second inequality is (a^2 + b^2 leq min(4a - 2b, 5)). That means (a^2 + b^2) has to be less than or equal to both 4a - 2b and 5. So, the region for (a, b) is the intersection of the regions where (a^2 + b^2 leq 4a - 2b) and (a^2 + b^2 leq 5). Therefore, the set of valid (a, b) is the intersection of the disk centered at (2, -1) with radius sqrt(4 + 1 + 0) = sqrt(5) (since completing the square for 4a - 2b: (a^2 -4a + b^2 + 2b leq 0) → ((a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 leq 5)) and the disk centered at the origin with radius sqrt(5). Wait, hold on, let&#39;s check that. Let me rewrite the inequality (a^2 + b^2 leq 4a - 2b). Moving the terms to the left side:(a^2 - 4a + b^2 + 2b leq 0)Completing the square for a: (a^2 - 4a = (a - 2)^2 - 4)Completing the square for b: (b^2 + 2b = (b + 1)^2 - 1)So substituting back:((a - 2)^2 - 4 + (b + 1)^2 - 1 leq 0)→ ((a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 - 5 leq 0)→ ((a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 leq 5)Therefore, the inequality (a^2 + b^2 leq 4a - 2b) represents a circle centered at (2, -1) with radius sqrt(5). So the region defined by (a^2 + b^2 leq min(4a - 2b, 5)) is the intersection of two circles: one centered at (0, 0) with radius sqrt(5), and another centered at (2, -1) with radius sqrt(5). Therefore, the set of possible centers (a, b) is the intersection of these two circles.So first, I need to find the area of overlap between these two circles. Then, since each point (a, b) in this overlapping region can &quot;generate&quot; a circle of radius sqrt(5) around it, the figure M is the union of all these circles. Therefore, M is the Minkowski sum of the overlapping region and a disk of radius sqrt(5). However, since the overlapping region is itself a lens-shaped area between two circles of radius sqrt(5), their Minkowski sum with another circle might just be the union of the two original circles expanded by sqrt(5), but I need to check.Wait, no. Actually, the Minkowski sum of two sets A and B is the set of all points a + b where a is in A and b is in B. In this case, if the overlapping region is the intersection of two circles, then taking the Minkowski sum with a circle of radius sqrt(5) would be equivalent to taking all points within sqrt(5) distance from the overlapping region. But since the overlapping region is already part of both original circles (each of radius sqrt(5)), expanding it by another sqrt(5) would result in the union of the two original circles each expanded by sqrt(5). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think carefully.Suppose we have two overlapping circles, A and B, each with radius sqrt(5). Their intersection is the lens-shaped region. The Minkowski sum of this lens with another circle of radius sqrt(5) would be all points that are at most sqrt(5) away from the lens. However, the original circles A and B are each radius sqrt(5). So the lens is the intersection of A and B. The Minkowski sum would be the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points in the lens. Since the lens is the overlap of A and B, then each point in the lens is already in both A and B. Therefore, the circles around them would cover the areas around A and B. But since A and B are each radius sqrt(5), expanding them by another sqrt(5) would create circles of radius 2*sqrt(5). But that might not be the case. Wait, actually, when you take the Minkowski sum of a set with a disk of radius r, it&#39;s like inflating the set by r. So if the original set is a lens (the intersection of two disks of radius sqrt(5)), then inflating it by sqrt(5) would result in the union of the two disks inflated by sqrt(5), but perhaps not. Wait, actually, the Minkowski sum of the intersection of two disks with another disk is contained within the Minkowski sum of each disk with the other disk. But maybe the Minkowski sum of the intersection is equal to the intersection of the Minkowski sums? Wait, no. Minkowski sum doesn&#39;t distribute over intersections. Hmm, this is getting confusing.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s easier to think in terms of the union. Since figure M is the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points (a, b) in the intersection of the two original circles (centered at (0,0) and (2, -1), both radius sqrt(5)). So essentially, M is the union of all such circles. Therefore, to find the area of M, I need to find the union of all these circles.But the union of all circles centered at points in the intersection of two circles, each of radius sqrt(5), with radius sqrt(5). That would be equivalent to the Minkowski sum of the intersection region with a circle of radius sqrt(5). But perhaps this is just the union of the two original circles each expanded by sqrt(5). Wait, but the original circles are already radius sqrt(5). If you take all points within sqrt(5) of the original circles, that would be the original circles expanded by sqrt(5), which would be circles of radius 2*sqrt(5). But maybe overlapping?Wait, let me visualize this. Suppose we have two circles, A and B, each radius sqrt(5), centers at (0,0) and (2,-1). Their intersection is the lens. Then, for each point in the lens, we draw a circle of radius sqrt(5). The union of all these circles would cover the area that is within sqrt(5) of any point in the lens. However, the lens is itself a subset of both A and B, so the union of all these circles would be the area covered by all points within sqrt(5) of A or within sqrt(5) of B. Wait, but A and B are already radius sqrt(5). So expanding them by sqrt(5) would give circles of radius 2*sqrt(5). But actually, the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points in A is just the Minkowski sum of A with a circle of radius sqrt(5), which is indeed a circle of radius sqrt(5) + sqrt(5) = 2*sqrt(5). Similarly for B. Therefore, the union of all such circles would be two circles of radius 2*sqrt(5) centered at (0,0) and (2,-1), and their overlapping region.But wait, but the centers (a,b) are not the entire original circles A and B, but only their intersection. So perhaps the union is not the entire Minkowski sums of A and B, but only the Minkowski sum of their intersection. Hmm, this is tricky.Alternatively, maybe we can rephrase the problem. Since figure M is the set of all (x,y) such that there exists (a,b) with (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 ≤ 5 and (a,b) in the intersection of the two circles: a^2 + b^2 ≤ 5 and (a - 2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 ≤ 5.So, figure M is the union over all (a,b) in the intersection of the two circles, of the circles centered at (a,b) with radius sqrt(5). So, equivalently, M is the set of points (x,y) such that the distance from (x,y) to some (a,b) in the intersection is at most sqrt(5). That is, M is the set of points within distance sqrt(5) from the intersection of the two circles. Which is the same as the Minkowski sum of the intersection region with a disk of radius sqrt(5).But how do we compute the area of this Minkowski sum? The Minkowski sum of two convex sets is easier to handle, but the intersection of two circles is a lens, which is convex? Wait, the intersection of two convex sets is convex. Since both circles are convex, their intersection is convex. Therefore, the Minkowski sum of the lens with a disk would be the lens &quot;inflated&quot; by sqrt(5) in all directions.But how does inflating a lens shape by a radius affect its area? If the original lens has area A, then the Minkowski sum with a disk of radius r would have area A + perimeter of the lens * r + π r^2. But this is true for convex sets, using the Steiner formula. Wait, but the lens is convex, so yes. However, I need to check if the lens is indeed convex.Yes, the intersection of two convex sets (the two circles) is convex. Therefore, the lens is convex. Therefore, the area of the Minkowski sum (the inflated lens) is area(lens) + perimeter(lens)*sqrt(5) + π*(sqrt(5))^2.But then, to compute the area of M, we need to compute area(lens) + perimeter(lens)*sqrt(5) + 5π. However, perhaps not exactly. Wait, Steiner formula applies to Minkowski addition with a ball. For a convex body K, the area of K + rB (where B is the unit ball) is area(K) + perimeter(K)*r + π r^2. So if we have the lens, which is convex, then yes, the area of the Minkowski sum with a disk of radius sqrt(5) is area(lens) + perimeter(lens)*sqrt(5) + π*(sqrt(5))^2.But then, to find the area of M, we need to first compute the area and perimeter of the lens (the intersection of the two circles). Let me try to compute that.First, let&#39;s find the area of the intersection (the lens) of the two circles: circle C1 centered at (0,0) with radius sqrt(5), and circle C2 centered at (2, -1) with radius sqrt(5). The distance between the centers of C1 and C2 is sqrt((2 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So the two circles have centers separated by sqrt(5), and each has radius sqrt(5). Therefore, the intersection is two lens-shaped regions, but since the distance between centers is equal to the radius, actually, the intersection is a lens where each circle passes through the other&#39;s center. Wait, if two circles have centers separated by d and each has radius d, then the intersection area is 2*( (π d^2)/3 - (√3/4) d^2 ). Let me recall the formula for the area of intersection of two circles.The area of intersection of two circles with radii r and R, separated by distance d, is:2 r^2 cos^{-1}(d^2/(2 r d)) - (d/2) sqrt(4 r^2 - d^2) + similar terms for R. Wait, actually, the formula is:If two circles have radii r and R, and the distance between centers is d, then the area of intersection is:r² cos⁻¹( (d² + r² - R²)/(2dr) ) + R² cos⁻¹( (d² + R² - r²)/(2dR) ) - ½ sqrt( (-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R) )But in our case, both circles have radius sqrt(5), and the distance between centers is sqrt(5). So r = R = sqrt(5), d = sqrt(5). Let&#39;s plug into the formula:Area = 2 * r² cos⁻¹( d/(2r) ) - (d/2) * sqrt(4r² - d²)So substituting r = sqrt(5), d = sqrt(5):Area = 2 * 5 * cos⁻¹( sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5)) ) - (sqrt(5)/2) * sqrt(20 - 5)Simplify:sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5)) = 1/2, so cos⁻¹(1/2) = π/3.Then:Area = 10 * (π/3) - (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(15)sqrt(15) = sqrt(5*3) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(3), so:Area = (10π)/3 - (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(5)*sqrt(3) = (10π)/3 - (5/2)*sqrt(3)Therefore, the area of the lens (intersection) is (10π/3) - (5√3)/2.Wait, let me verify that calculation again.The formula for the area of intersection when two circles have equal radii r and separated by distance d is:2 r² cos⁻¹(d/(2r)) - (d/2) * sqrt(4r² - d²)So with r = sqrt(5), d = sqrt(5):First term: 2 * 5 * cos⁻¹( sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5)) ) = 10 * cos⁻¹(1/2) = 10*(π/3)Second term: (sqrt(5)/2) * sqrt(4*5 - 5) = (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(15) = (sqrt(5)/2)*(sqrt(5*3)) = (5/2)*sqrt(3)So area = 10π/3 - (5√3)/2. Yes, that seems right.Therefore, the area of the lens is (10π/3 - (5√3)/2).Next, we need the perimeter of the lens. The perimeter of the intersection of two circles is the sum of the two arc lengths from each circle making up the lens. For each circle, the arc length can be calculated using the central angle. Given two circles of radius r separated by distance d, the central angle θ for each arc is given by θ = 2 cos⁻¹(d/(2r)).In our case, d = sqrt(5), r = sqrt(5), so θ = 2 cos⁻¹( sqrt(5)/(2*sqrt(5)) ) = 2 cos⁻¹(1/2) = 2*(π/3) = 2π/3.Therefore, each circle contributes an arc length of r * θ = sqrt(5) * (2π/3) = (2π sqrt(5))/3. Since there are two arcs (one from each circle), the total perimeter of the lens is 2 * (2π sqrt(5)/3) = (4π sqrt(5))/3.Therefore, the perimeter of the lens is (4π sqrt(5))/3.Now, using the Steiner formula for the Minkowski sum with a disk of radius sqrt(5):Area(M) = Area(lens) + Perimeter(lens)*sqrt(5) + π*(sqrt(5))²Plugging in the values:Area(lens) = (10π/3 - (5√3)/2)Perimeter(lens) = (4π sqrt(5))/3So:Area(M) = (10π/3 - 5√3/2) + (4π sqrt(5)/3)*sqrt(5) + π*5Simplify term by term:First term: 10π/3 - 5√3/2Second term: (4π sqrt(5)/3)*sqrt(5) = (4π *5)/3 = 20π/3Third term: 5πAdding all together:10π/3 + 20π/3 + 5π - 5√3/2Compute the pi terms:10π/3 + 20π/3 = 30π/3 = 10π10π + 5π = 15πSo Area(M) = 15π - (5√3)/2But wait, is this correct? Let me check again.Wait, the Steiner formula says:Area(K + B_r) = Area(K) + Perimeter(K)*r + π r²Where K is the convex set (the lens), and B_r is the disk of radius r. In our case, r = sqrt(5). So:Area(M) = Area(lens) + Perimeter(lens)*sqrt(5) + π*(sqrt(5))²Which is exactly what we computed. So substituting:Area(lens) = (10π/3 - 5√3/2)Perimeter(lens) = (4π sqrt(5))/3Then:Area(M) = (10π/3 - 5√3/2) + (4π sqrt(5)/3)*sqrt(5) + 5πCalculates as:First term: 10π/3 - 5√3/2Second term: (4π sqrt(5)/3)*sqrt(5) = 4π*(5)/3 = 20π/3Third term: 5πSo total pi terms:10π/3 + 20π/3 = 30π/3 = 10π10π + 5π = 15πTherefore, Area(M) = 15π - (5√3)/2But wait, hold on a second. The Steiner formula is applicable when we take the Minkowski sum with a disk. However, in our problem, the figure M is the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points in the lens. But the Minkowski sum is equivalent to taking all points in the lens and adding all vectors in the disk. So yes, that is exactly the union. Therefore, the area should indeed be computed as per the Steiner formula. However, I need to make sure that the lens is convex. Since the lens is the intersection of two circles, which are convex sets, the intersection is convex. Therefore, Steiner&#39;s formula applies.But let me verify with a simple case. Suppose the lens is just a single point. Then the Minkowski sum would be a circle around that point, and Steiner&#39;s formula would give 0 + 0 + π r², which is correct. If the lens is a line segment, the Minkowski sum would be a rectangle with semicircles on the ends, and the area would be length*2r + π r². Which matches Steiner&#39;s formula: area(line segment) is 0, perimeter is 2*length, so perimeter*r is 2*length*r, plus π r². Wait, but actually, for a line segment, the Minkowski sum with a disk is a rectangle of length L and width 2r, plus two semicircles of radius r, so total area is 2rL + π r². But according to Steiner, it&#39;s 0 + 2L*r + π r². So yes, it works.Therefore, Steiner&#39;s formula is applicable here.Therefore, Area(M) = 15π - (5√3)/2.But let me check the arithmetic once again:Area(lens) = 10π/3 - 5√3/2Perimeter(lens) = 4π√5 /3Multiply perimeter by sqrt(5):4π√5 /3 * sqrt(5) = 4π*5 /3 = 20π/3Then π*(sqrt(5))² = 5πAdd all terms:10π/3 + 20π/3 +5π -5√3/2 = (30π/3) +5π -5√3/2 = 10π +5π -5√3/2 =15π -5√3/2Yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the area of figure M is 15π - (5√3)/2.But before I conclude, let me think again if this approach is correct. Because when you take the Minkowski sum of the lens with a circle of radius sqrt(5), you get all points within sqrt(5) of the lens. However, the original problem says that for each (x,y) in M, there exists (a,b) such that (x,y) is in the circle around (a,b) with radius sqrt(5), and (a,b) is in the lens. So M is exactly the Minkowski sum. Therefore, the area should indeed be 15π - (5√3)/2.But let me think of another approach to verify.Alternatively, figure M can be considered as the union of all circles of radius sqrt(5) centered at points (a, b) where (a, b) are in the intersection of two circles: a^2 + b^2 ≤5 and (a -2)^2 + (b +1)^2 ≤5. Therefore, M is the union of all such circles. Now, what is the union of these circles?If the centers (a,b) are in the intersection of the two circles (each of radius sqrt(5)), then the union of circles of radius sqrt(5) around these centers would be the same as the union of the two original circles expanded by sqrt(5). Wait, but expanding a circle by radius r would make its radius r + original radius. But here, each center (a,b) is in the intersection, so each circle is already a subset of both original circles. Wait, no. Each circle of radius sqrt(5) around (a,b) where (a,b) is in the intersection. But the original circles are themselves of radius sqrt(5). So if (a,b) is in the intersection, then the circle around (a,b) with radius sqrt(5) would cover points from both original circles. However, since (a,b) is in both original circles, the circle around (a,b) would extend beyond both original circles. Alternatively, perhaps M is the union of all such circles. But to find the area of the union, maybe we can consider the farthest points from the lens. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, maybe M is equal to the Minkowski sum, which we computed as 15π - (5√3)/2. But let&#39;s verify with coordinates.Suppose we take the two original circles, each of radius sqrt(5). The Minkowski sum of their intersection with another circle of radius sqrt(5) should be the same as the union of the Minkowski sums of each original circle with the circle of radius sqrt(5), intersected appropriately? Not sure.Wait, actually, the Minkowski sum is distributive over unions. That is, if you have A ∪ B, then the Minkowski sum with C is (A + C) ∪ (B + C). But in our case, the lens is the intersection of A and B, not the union. So the Minkowski sum of A ∩ B with C is a subset of (A + C) ∩ (B + C). However, I don&#39;t know if equality holds.But in our problem, since we have the Minkowski sum of the lens (A ∩ B) with C, which is the same as the union of all translates of C by points in A ∩ B. Therefore, it might not be straightforward.But perhaps given that we have already computed using Steiner&#39;s formula, which should be correct for convex sets, and the lens is convex, the result 15π - (5√3)/2 should be correct.Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of shifting coordinates.Wait, suppose we consider that figure M is the set of all (x,y) such that there exists (a,b) in the intersection of the two circles, and (x,y) lies in the circle of radius sqrt(5) around (a,b). Therefore, M is the union of all such circles. The key is that each (a,b) is a center, so the union is all points within sqrt(5) of some (a,b) in the lens.But the lens is the intersection of two circles of radius sqrt(5) separated by sqrt(5). Therefore, the union of circles of radius sqrt(5) around points in the lens would be the same as the union of the two original circles expanded by sqrt(5). Wait, but expanding each original circle (radius sqrt(5)) by sqrt(5) would result in two circles of radius 2*sqrt(5). However, the centers of these expanded circles would be (0,0) and (2,-1), and the distance between them is sqrt(5). So two circles of radius 2*sqrt(5) separated by sqrt(5). Their union would have an area of 2*(π*(2√5)^2) - area of their intersection. But wait, that&#39;s a different approach. Let me see:If we consider the expanded circles, each of radius 2*sqrt(5), centers (0,0) and (2,-1), distance between centers sqrt(5). Then their union&#39;s area would be 2*(π*(20)) - intersection area. But this approach is different from the Steiner formula. Which one is correct?Wait, but in the problem statement, figure M is the union of circles of radius sqrt(5) around points (a,b) in the lens. Each such circle is centered at a point (a,b) which is in both original circles (radius sqrt(5)). But then, the union of all these circles would actually be the entire area covered by any circle of radius sqrt(5) whose center is in both original circles. But the original circles are each radius sqrt(5), and their centers are sqrt(5) apart. So the intersection lens is the set of points that are in both circles. Then, drawing a circle of radius sqrt(5) around each point in the lens. The union of all these circles would be the set of points that are within sqrt(5) of the lens. But the lens is the overlapping area of the two original circles. Therefore, M is the set of points within sqrt(5) of the lens. Which is the same as the Minkowski sum of the lens with a disk of radius sqrt(5). But if we compute the area using Steiner formula, we get 15π - (5√3)/2. Alternatively, if we consider that the union is the same as the two expanded circles (radius 2*sqrt(5)) minus something, but let&#39;s compute that.Two circles of radius 2*sqrt(5), centers sqrt(5) apart. The area of their union is 2*π*(20) - intersection area. Wait, 2*π*(2√5)^2 = 2*π*20 = 40π. Then subtract the intersection area of two circles of radius 2√5 separated by sqrt(5). Let&#39;s compute that intersection area.Using the formula for the intersection of two circles with radii R and R, separated by d:Intersection area = 2 R² cos⁻¹(d/(2 R)) - (d/2) sqrt(4 R² - d²)Here, R = 2√5, d = sqrt(5):So,= 2*(20) * cos⁻¹( sqrt(5)/(2*2√5) ) - (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(4*(20) - 5)Simplify:sqrt(5)/(4√5) = 1/4, so cos⁻¹(1/4)First term: 40 * cos⁻¹(1/4)Second term: (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(80 -5) = (sqrt(5)/2)*sqrt(75) = (sqrt(5)/2)*(5*sqrt(3)) = (5 sqrt(15))/2 ≈ 5*3.872/2 ≈ 9.68Therefore, intersection area ≈ 40 * 1.318 (since cos⁻¹(1/4) ≈ 1.318 radians) - 9.68 ≈ 52.72 - 9.68 ≈ 43.04. But this is a rough estimate.But regardless, this area is significantly larger than the previous result. Therefore, there must be a discrepancy here. But why?Ah, because the Minkowski sum of the lens with sqrt(5) is not the same as the union of the two expanded circles. The Minkowski sum is the union of all circles centered at points in the lens, which is a subset of the union of the two expanded circles. Because the expanded circles would include centers from the entire original circles, not just their intersection. Therefore, the Minkowski sum of the lens is only a part of the union of the two expanded circles.Therefore, my initial approach using Steiner&#39;s formula was correct, giving Area(M) = 15π - (5√3)/2, while the alternative approach considering the union of two larger circles is incorrect because it includes more area.Therefore, trusting the Steiner formula approach, since the lens is convex, the Minkowski sum with a disk will have the area computed as 15π - (5√3)/2.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{15pi - dfrac{5sqrt{3}}{2}}.Final Answerboxed{15pi - dfrac{5sqrt{3}}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To find the area of the figure ( M ), we need to consider the set of all points ((x, y)) such that there exist real numbers (a, b) satisfying the following inequalities:1. ((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 leq 5)2. (a^2 + b^2 leq min(4a - 2b, 5))The second inequality defines a region for ((a, b)) which is the intersection of two circles: one centered at ((0, 0)) with radius (sqrt{5}) and another centered at ((2, -1)) with radius (sqrt{5}). The intersection of these two circles forms a lens-shaped region.To find the area of the figure ( M ), we need to consider the Minkowski sum of this lens-shaped region with a disk of radius (sqrt{5}). Using the Steiner formula for the Minkowski sum of a convex set with a disk, we calculate the area as follows:1. Area of the lens (intersection of two circles):   - The distance between the centers of the circles is (sqrt{5}), and each has radius (sqrt{5}).   - The area of intersection is calculated as:     [     2 left( 5 cos^{-1}left(frac{1}{2}right) right) - frac{sqrt{5}}{2} sqrt{15} = frac{10pi}{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}     ]2. Perimeter of the lens:   - The central angle for each arc is (2 cos^{-1}left(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{2pi}{3}).   - The perimeter of the lens is the sum of the arc lengths from both circles:     [     2 left( sqrt{5} cdot frac{2pi}{3} right) = frac{4pisqrt{5}}{3}     ]3. Applying the Steiner formula:   - The area of the Minkowski sum (figure ( M )) is given by:     [     text{Area}(M) = text{Area}(text{lens}) + text{Perimeter}(text{lens}) cdot sqrt{5} + pi (sqrt{5})^2     ]   - Substituting the values:     [     text{Area}(M) = left( frac{10pi}{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} right) + left( frac{4pisqrt{5}}{3} cdot sqrt{5} right) + 5pi     ]     [     = frac{10pi}{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{20pi}{3} + 5pi     ]     [     = 15pi - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}     ]Thus, the area of the figure ( M ) is (boxed{15pi - dfrac{5sqrt{3}}{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a2ce2ec></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>🔑:</span>Answer: 15 pi-frac{5 sqrt{3}}{2}.Solution. The second inequality is equivalent to the system of inequalitiesleft{begin{array}{l}a^{2}+b^{2} leqslant 4 a-2 b a^{2}+b^{2} leqslant 5end{array}right.Thus, the original system is equivalent to the following:left{begin{array} { l } { ( x - a ) ^ { 2 } + ( y - b ) ^ { 2 } leqslant 5 , } { a ^ { 2 } + b ^ { 2 } leqslant 4 a - 2 b , } { a ^ { 2 } + b ^ { 2 } leqslant 5 }end{array} Leftrightarrow left{begin{array}{l}(a-x)^{2}+(b-y)^{2} leqslant 5 (a-2)^{2}+(b+1)^{2} leqslant 5 a^{2}+b^{2} leqslant 5end{array}right.right.The sets of points defined by these inequalities on the plane (a ; b) (where x and y act as parameters) are circles omega_{1}, omega_{2}, omega_{3} with radius sqrt{5} and centers at P(x ; y), B(2 ;-1), A(0 ; 0), respectively. The condition of the problem means that the system (6) must have a solution with respect to (a ; b), that is, all three circles must have at least one common point.Let the circles bounding omega_{2} and omega_{3} intersect at points C and D (then triangles A B C and A B D are equilateral). The intersection of circles omega_{2} and omega_{3} is a figure F, representing the union of two smaller segments of these circles, bounded by the chord C D. Then the figure M consists of all possible points (x ; y) located at a distance of no more than sqrt{5} from the figure F. (This is the union of all circles of radius sqrt{5}, the centers of which belong to the figure F.)Let points P and Q be symmetric to points A and B (respectively) relative to point C; points T and R are symmetric to points A and B (respectively) relative to point D. It is not difficult to understand that M is the union of four sectors (the central angle of all sectors is less than 180^{circ}):- sector P A T of the circle with center at point A and radius A P,- sector Q B R of the circle with center at point B and radius B Q,- sector P C Q of the circle with center at point C and radius C P,- sector R D T of the circle with center at point D and radius D T.Note that the first two sectors intersect along the rhombus A C B D, and there are no other intersections between the sectors. At the same time, the first two sectors are equal to each other, and the last two sectors are also equal to each other.

I have a problem here about a geometric sequence. The problem says that the sum of the first 3 terms is 3, and the difference between the sum of the first 9 terms and the first 6 terms is 12. I need to find the sum of the first 6 terms. Hmm, alright, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted by r. So, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term.Since the problem mentions the sum of the first n terms, S_n, I should remember the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series. The formula is S_n = a_1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), provided that r ≠ 1. If r = 1, the sum would just be S_n = a_1*n, but since the problem says it&#39;s a positive geometric sequence and mentions a common ratio (because S_9 - S_6 is non-zero), I think it&#39;s safe to assume r ≠ 1.Alright, so the problem gives me two pieces of information:1. S_3 = 32. S_9 - S_6 = 12And I need to find S_6.Let me write down the equations using the sum formula. Let&#39;s let a = a_1 (the first term) for simplicity.First, S_3 = a*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3.Second, S_9 - S_6 = [a*(1 - r^9)/(1 - r)] - [a*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r)] = 12.Simplifying the second equation: [a*(1 - r^9 - 1 + r^6)/(1 - r)] = 12. So, the numerator becomes a*(-r^9 + r^6) = a*r^6*(1 - r^3). Therefore, the equation becomes [a*r^6*(1 - r^3)] / (1 - r) = 12.But wait, from the first equation, S_3 = a*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3. So, the term (1 - r^3)/(1 - r) is equal to 3/a. Let me substitute that into the second equation.So, the second equation becomes [a*r^6*(3/a)] = 12. Simplifying, the a cancels out, so 3*r^6 = 12. Then, dividing both sides by 3, we get r^6 = 4. Therefore, r^6 = 4. Taking the sixth root of both sides, r = 4^(1/6). Since the problem states it&#39;s a positive geometric sequence, r must be positive, so we don&#39;t have to worry about negative roots.4 is 2^2, so 4^(1/6) = (2^2)^(1/6) = 2^(2/6) = 2^(1/3). So, r = 2^(1/3). Alternatively, r = cube root of 2. Hmm, that seems manageable.Now that I have r, let&#39;s find a using the first equation. Recall S_3 = a*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3.First, let&#39;s compute r^3. Since r = 2^(1/3), r^3 = (2^(1/3))^3 = 2^(1) = 2. So, r^3 = 2.Therefore, substituting back into the sum formula for S_3:a*(1 - 2)/(1 - 2^(1/3)) = 3.Simplify the numerator: (1 - 2) = -1. So, the equation becomes:a*(-1)/(1 - 2^(1/3)) = 3.Multiply both sides by (1 - 2^(1/3)):a*(-1) = 3*(1 - 2^(1/3))Multiply both sides by -1:a = -3*(1 - 2^(1/3)) = 3*(2^(1/3) - 1)So, a = 3*(2^(1/3) - 1). Hmm, that&#39;s a bit messy, but maybe it will simplify when we compute S_6.Now, let&#39;s find S_6. Using the sum formula again:S_6 = a*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r)We already know r^6. From before, we found that r^6 = 4. So, substituting:S_6 = a*(1 - 4)/(1 - r) = a*(-3)/(1 - r)But from the first equation, we have an expression for a in terms of r. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way here.Wait, let&#39;s recall that S_3 = 3 = a*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r). And we have r^3 = 2, so:S_3 = a*(1 - 2)/(1 - r) = a*(-1)/(1 - r) = 3Which gives a/(1 - r) = -3. Wait, but then when we compute S_6 = a*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r) = a*(1 - 4)/(1 - r) = a*(-3)/(1 - r) = (-3)*(a/(1 - r)) = (-3)*(-3) = 9.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.If a/(1 - r) = -3 from the first equation, then S_6 = a*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r) = a/(1 - r)*(1 - r^6) = (-3)*(1 - 4) = (-3)*(-3) = 9. So, S_6 = 9. That seems like a possible answer. Let me verify.But let&#39;s go through the steps again to be sure. So, S_3 = a*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3. We found r^3 = 2, so:a*(1 - 2)/(1 - r) = 3 =&gt; a*(-1)/(1 - r) = 3 =&gt; a/(1 - r) = -3.Then, S_6 = a*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r). Since r^6 = 4, this is:a/(1 - r)*(1 - 4) = (-3)*(-3) = 9.Yes, that works. So S_6 = 9. So, is the answer 9? Let me check with the given data.If S_6 = 9, then S_9 - S_6 = 12 implies S_9 = 21. Let me check if that&#39;s consistent.Compute S_9 = a*(1 - r^9)/(1 - r). But r^9 = (r^3)^3 = 2^3 = 8. So:S_9 = a*(1 - 8)/(1 - r) = a*(-7)/(1 - r). But a/(1 - r) = -3, so S_9 = (-7)*(-3) = 21. Which matches the given S_9 - S_6 = 12 (21 - 9 = 12). So that checks out.Therefore, S_6 is indeed 9. So the answer is 9.But let me recap the steps in case I missed anything. The key was recognizing that S_9 - S_6 is equal to the sum of terms from the 7th to the 9th term. In a geometric sequence, that sum can also be written as r^6 times the sum of the first three terms. Wait, that might be a quicker way to see it.Alternatively, the sum from term 7 to term 9 is a_7 + a_8 + a_9. Since each term is multiplied by r each time, a_7 = a_1*r^6, a_8 = a_1*r^7, a_9 = a_1*r^8. So, the sum is a_1*r^6*(1 + r + r^2). But the sum of the first three terms is a_1*(1 + r + r^2) = S_3 = 3. Therefore, the sum from 7 to 9 is r^6*S_3 = r^6*3. But the problem states that S_9 - S_6 = 12, so 3*r^6 = 12 =&gt; r^6 = 4. So this is another way to get r^6 = 4. Then, since S_6 = S_3 + (sum from 4 to 6). The sum from 4 to 6 is a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = a_1*r^3*(1 + r + r^2) = r^3*S_3. Since r^3 = 2, that sum is 2*3 = 6. Therefore, S_6 = S_3 + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9. So that&#39;s another way to see it.This method seems more straightforward. Let me elaborate. Since the sum of the first three terms is 3, then the sum of terms 4-6 would be r^3 times the sum of terms 1-3, because each term in the geometric sequence is multiplied by r each time. Since the first three terms are a_1, a_1*r, a_1*r^2, the next three terms would be a_1*r^3, a_1*r^4, a_1*r^5, which is r^3 times the first three terms. Therefore, the sum of terms 4-6 is r^3 * S_3. Then, S_6 = S_3 + r^3*S_3 = S_3*(1 + r^3). Since r^3 = 2, this is 3*(1 + 2) = 3*3 = 9. Similarly, the sum of terms 7-9 would be r^6 * S_3, which is 4*3 = 12, which matches S_9 - S_6 = 12. So this approach seems more efficient.Therefore, the answer is S_6 = 9.I think that&#39;s solid. Both methods lead to the same conclusion. First, by directly solving the equations using the sum formula, and second by recognizing that each subsequent set of three terms is a multiple of the previous set due to the geometric progression. That insight makes the problem much quicker to solve.Another way to look at it is by considering that the sums S_3, S_6 - S_3, S_9 - S_6 form a geometric sequence themselves. Since each block of three terms is multiplied by r^3 each time. Since S_3 = 3, then the next block is 3*r^3, and the next block is 3*r^6. Given that S_9 - S_6 = 12, this is equal to 3*r^6 = 12 =&gt; r^6 = 4. Then, the middle block S_6 - S_3 = 3*r^3. But from S_3*(1 + r^3 + r^6) = S_9. Wait, maybe not exactly. But if S_3, S_6 - S_3, S_9 - S_6 form a geometric sequence with common ratio r^3, then:First term: S_3 = 3Second term: S_6 - S_3 = 3*r^3Third term: S_9 - S_6 = 3*r^6But we know the third term is 12, so 3*r^6 = 12 =&gt; r^6 = 4. Then, the second term is 3*r^3. But since r^6 = 4, then r^3 = sqrt(4) = 2 (since r is positive). Therefore, the second term is 3*2 = 6, so S_6 = S_3 + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9. That&#39;s another way to see it, very efficient. This seems like a useful pattern for geometric sequences when dealing with sums over intervals that are multiples of a certain number of terms. So, all these methods converge to S_6 = 9. That gives me confidence that this is the correct answer. I don&#39;t see any mistakes in the reasoning, and multiple approaches confirm the result. Therefore, the answer should be 9.Final Answerboxed{9}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find the sum of the first 6 terms ((S_6)) of a positive geometric sequence ({a_n}) where (S_3 = 3) and (S_9 - S_6 = 12).First, recall the formula for the sum of the first (n) terms of a geometric sequence:[ S_n = a_1 frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} ]where (a_1) is the first term and (r) is the common ratio.We are given:1. (S_3 = 3)2. (S_9 - S_6 = 12)For (S_3):[ S_3 = a_1 frac{1 - r^3}{1 - r} = 3 ]For (S_9 - S_6):[ S_9 - S_6 = a_1 frac{r^6 - r^9}{1 - r} = a_1 frac{r^6(1 - r^3)}{1 - r} = 12 ]From the first equation, we know:[ a_1 frac{1 - r^3}{1 - r} = 3 ]Substitute this into the second equation:[ 3 cdot r^6 = 12 ][ r^6 = 4 ][ r^3 = 2 ] (since (r) is positive)Now, we need to find (S_6):[ S_6 = a_1 frac{1 - r^6}{1 - r} ]Using the value of (r^6 = 4) and the fact that (a_1 frac{1 - r^3}{1 - r} = 3), we can rewrite (S_6) as:[ S_6 = a_1 frac{1 - 4}{1 - r} = a_1 frac{-3}{1 - r} ]Since (a_1 frac{1 - r^3}{1 - r} = 3), we substitute (r^3 = 2):[ a_1 frac{1 - 2}{1 - r} = 3 ][ a_1 frac{-1}{1 - r} = 3 ][ a_1 frac{1}{1 - r} = -3 ]Thus:[ S_6 = -3 cdot (-3) = 9 ]Therefore, the sum of the first 6 terms (S_6) is (boxed{9}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a geometric sequence {a_n} where all terms are positive. The sum of the first 3 terms is 3, so S_3 = 3. Then, the difference between the sum of the first 9 terms and the sum of the first 6 terms is 12, so S_9 - S_6 = 12. We need to find S_6.First, let me recall the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence. The sum S_n is given by a_1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r) when r ≠ 1. Here, a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio. Since the sequence is positive, both a_1 and r must be positive, and since it&#39;s a geometric sequence, r can&#39;t be 0. So, r &gt; 0.Given that S_3 = 3, I can write:S_3 = a_1*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3.  [Equation 1]Similarly, S_9 - S_6 = 12. Let&#39;s express S_9 and S_6 using the sum formula:S_9 = a_1*(1 - r^9)/(1 - r)S_6 = a_1*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r)Therefore, S_9 - S_6 = [a_1*(1 - r^9)/(1 - r)] - [a_1*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r)] = a_1*( (1 - r^9) - (1 - r^6) ) / (1 - r) = a_1*( - r^9 + r^6 ) / (1 - r ) = a_1*r^6*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r )But we are told that S_9 - S_6 = 12, so:a_1*r^6*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 12.  [Equation 2]Now, from Equation 1, we have a_1*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3. Let&#39;s denote that expression as 3. So, if I substitute this into Equation 2, I get:3 * r^6 = 12So, r^6 = 12 / 3 = 4Therefore, r^6 = 4. Since r is positive, we can take the 6th root of both sides:r = 4^(1/6) = (2^2)^(1/6) = 2^(2/6) = 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.2599...But maybe we can keep it as 2^(1/3) for exactness.Now that we have r^6 = 4, we can use this to compute S_6. Let&#39;s recall that S_6 = a_1*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r)But we need to find a_1 first. From Equation 1:3 = a_1*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r)We can solve for a_1:a_1 = 3*(1 - r)/(1 - r^3)Note that 1 - r^3 can be factored as (1 - r)(1 + r + r^2). Therefore,a_1 = 3*(1 - r)/[(1 - r)(1 + r + r^2)] = 3/(1 + r + r^2)So, a_1 = 3/(1 + r + r^2)Now, let&#39;s compute S_6. Since S_6 = a_1*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r)But we know that r^6 = 4, so 1 - r^6 = 1 - 4 = -3Therefore, S_6 = a_1*(-3)/(1 - r) = -3a_1/(1 - r)But from Equation 1, we have a_1/(1 - r) = 3/(1 - r^3) [Wait, let me check that again]Wait, original Equation 1: S_3 = a_1*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3. So, a_1/(1 - r) = 3/(1 - r^3)But 1 - r^3 is (1 - r)(1 + r + r^2), so a_1/(1 - r) = 3/[(1 - r)(1 + r + r^2)]*(1 - r) cancels out, so a_1/(1 - r) = 3/(1 + r + r^2)Wait, perhaps that&#39;s complicating. Let&#39;s substitute a_1 from earlier. Since a_1 = 3/(1 + r + r^2), then:S_6 = [3/(1 + r + r^2)]*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r)But r^6 = 4, so 1 - r^6 = -3So S_6 = [3/(1 + r + r^2)]*(-3)/(1 - r) = -9 / [ (1 + r + r^2)(1 - r) ]But let&#39;s compute denominator:(1 + r + r^2)(1 - r) = 1*(1 - r) + r*(1 - r) + r^2*(1 - r) = (1 - r) + (r - r^2) + (r^2 - r^3) = 1 - r + r - r^2 + r^2 - r^3 = 1 - r^3So denominator is 1 - r^3. Therefore,S_6 = -9 / (1 - r^3)But from Equation 1, 1 - r^3 = (3*(1 - r))/a_1, but perhaps another approach.Wait, from Equation 1, S_3 = 3 = a_1*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r). So, 1 - r^3 = 3*(1 - r)/a_1. Therefore,S_6 = -9 / (3*(1 - r)/a_1) ) = -9 / (3*(1 - r)/a_1 ) = -9 * a_1 / [3*(1 - r)] ) = (-3 a_1)/(1 - r)But from Equation 1, a_1/(1 - r) = 3/(1 - r^3). Therefore,S_6 = -3*(3/(1 - r^3)) = -9/(1 - r^3)But 1 - r^3 = (1 - r)(1 + r + r^2). Hmm, this seems to be going in circles.Wait, perhaps a better approach. Let&#39;s remember that r^6 = 4. So, r^3 = sqrt(4) = 2, since r is positive. Because (r^3)^2 = r^6 = 4, so r^3 = 2. Therefore, r^3 = 2.Wait, that&#39;s a key point. If r^6 = 4, then (r^3)^2 = 4. Since r is positive, r^3 = 2. So, r^3 = 2. So, r = 2^(1/3). So, that simplifies things.So, r^3 = 2.Therefore, 1 - r^3 = 1 - 2 = -1.So, in Equation 1, S_3 = 3 = a_1*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = a_1*(-1)/(1 - r) =&gt; -a_1/(1 - r) = 3 =&gt; a_1/(1 - r) = -3. But since all terms are positive, and r &gt; 0, we need to check if this is possible.Wait, hold on. If r^3 = 2, then r = 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26, which is greater than 1. So the common ratio is greater than 1, which is allowed as long as the terms are positive, which they are. So, the sequence is increasing.But in the formula for the sum, if r &gt; 1, then the sum formula is S_n = a_1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let&#39;s recall that the standard formula is S_n = a_1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r) if r ≠ 1.But if r &gt; 1, then 1 - r is negative, so the formula is equivalent to a_1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Since (1 - r^n)/(1 - r) = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, either formula is correct, but depending on r, one might be more convenient.But in our case, since r &gt; 1, maybe expressing it as a_1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) is better to avoid negative denominators. However, since we already used the original formula in the previous equations, we need to be consistent.But let&#39;s see. From Equation 1:If r^3 = 2, then 1 - r^3 = -1, so Equation 1:3 = a_1*( -1 ) / (1 - r )Therefore,3 = -a_1 / (1 - r )Multiply both sides by (1 - r ):3*(1 - r ) = -a_1Thus,a_1 = -3*(1 - r ) = 3*(r - 1 )Since a_1 must be positive, and r &gt; 1, this makes sense: r - 1 is positive, so a_1 is positive. So, a_1 = 3*(r - 1 )Now, let&#39;s compute S_6.S_6 = a_1*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r )We know that r^6 = 4, so 1 - r^6 = -3.Therefore,S_6 = a_1*(-3)/(1 - r ) = (-3a_1)/(1 - r )But from above, a_1 = 3*(r - 1 ). So,S_6 = (-3 * 3*(r - 1 )) / (1 - r ) = (-9*(r - 1 )) / (1 - r ) = (-9*(r - 1 )) / ( - (r - 1 )) ) = (-9*(r - 1 )) / (- (r - 1 )) ) = 9Therefore, S_6 = 9.Wait, that&#39;s clean. Let me check again.Given r^3 = 2, so r^6 = (r^3)^2 = 4. Then, a_1 = 3*(r - 1 ). Then, S_6 = a_1*(1 - r^6)/(1 - r ) = 3*(r - 1 )*(1 - 4)/(1 - r ) = 3*(r - 1 )*(-3)/(1 - r )= 3*(r -1 )*(-3)/( - (r -1 )) [since 1 - r = - (r -1 ) ]= 3*(-3)*(r -1 ) / (- (r -1 )) = 3*(-3)/(-1) = 9Yes, that cancels out nicely. So, S_6 = 9.Alternatively, since S_9 - S_6 = 12, and S_9 - S_6 is the sum of terms 7 to 9, which is a_7 + a_8 + a_9.In a geometric sequence, a_7 = a_1*r^6, a_8 = a_1*r^7, a_9 = a_1*r^8. So sum is a_1*r^6*(1 + r + r^2) = S_3 * r^6, since S_3 = a_1*(1 + r + r^2). Wait, S_3 = 3, so this sum a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 3*r^6. But we are told this sum is 12. Therefore, 3*r^6 = 12 =&gt; r^6 = 4, which is the same as before. Then, since S_6 = S_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6. But a_4 = a_1*r^3, a_5 = a_1*r^4, a_6 = a_1*r^5. So sum a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = a_1*r^3*(1 + r + r^2) = S_3*r^3. So S_6 = S_3 + S_3*r^3 = 3 + 3*r^3. Since r^3 = 2, then S_6 = 3 + 3*2 = 3 + 6 = 9. So that&#39;s another way to see it.This seems more straightforward. Since S_3 = 3, then the next three terms (4-6) would be S_3 * r^3, and the next three terms (7-9) would be S_3 * r^6. Therefore, S_6 = S_3 + S_3*r^3 = 3 + 3*r^3. Then S_9 = S_6 + S_3*r^6. Given that S_9 - S_6 = 12, which is S_3*r^6 = 12. Since S_3 =3, 3*r^6 =12 =&gt; r^6=4, so r^3=2. Therefore, S_6=3 +3*2=9.This seems like a more elegant approach. So, the answer is 9. Therefore, S_6 = boxed{9}.Final Answerboxed{9}&lt;/think&gt;Given the sum of the first ( n ) terms of a positive geometric sequence ({a_n}) is ( S_n ). We know ( S_3 = 3 ) and ( S_9 - S_6 = 12 ).

So Toma thought of a positive integer, let&#39;s call it N. Then he divided N by 3, 6, and 9 and found the remainders. The sum of these three remainders is 15. We need to find the remainder when N is divided by 18. Hmm, right. Let me break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s recall that when you divide a number by another number, the remainder has to be less than the divisor. So, when N is divided by 3, the remainder can be 0, 1, or 2. Similarly, when divided by 6, the remainder can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. And when divided by 9, the remainder can be anything from 0 up to 8. So, let&#39;s denote the remainders as follows:Let r3 be the remainder when N is divided by 3,r6 be the remainder when N is divided by 6,r9 be the remainder when N is divided by 9.We are told that r3 + r6 + r9 = 15.Our goal is to find the remainder when N is divided by 18, which we can call R. So, we need to find R such that N ≡ R mod 18, where R is between 0 and 17.Now, maybe we can find relationships between these remainders. Let&#39;s start by noting that 3, 6, and 9 are divisors of 18. So perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or some other modular arithmetic properties here.But first, let&#39;s think about the possible values of r3, r6, and r9. Since r3 is the remainder when divided by 3, it&#39;s 0, 1, or 2. Similarly, r6 can be 0 to 5, and r9 can be 0 to 8. Their sum is 15, which is a pretty large sum given the maximum possible values.Wait, let&#39;s calculate the maximum possible sum of r3 + r6 + r9. The maximum r3 is 2, r6 is 5, and r9 is 8. So 2 + 5 + 8 = 15. Oh! So the sum is exactly the maximum possible. That means that each remainder must be at its maximum value. So is that possible?Wait, but if N leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, then when divided by 6, which is a multiple of 3, the remainder can&#39;t be just anything. There&#39;s a relationship here. Let me think.If N ≡ r3 mod 3, and N ≡ r6 mod 6, then r6 must satisfy r6 ≡ r3 mod 3. Because 6 is a multiple of 3. So, for example, if r3 is 0, then r6 must be 0, 3; if r3 is 1, then r6 must be 1, 4; if r3 is 2, then r6 must be 2, 5. So, r6 is either r3 or r3 + 3. Therefore, r6 is congruent to r3 modulo 3, but since 6 is 2*3, the possible remainders when divided by 6 are such that they are congruent to r3 mod 3.Similarly, when divided by 9, since 9 is a multiple of 3, the remainder r9 must also be congruent to r3 mod 3. So, r9 ≡ r3 mod 3. So, if r3 is 0, r9 must be 0, 3, 6; if r3 is 1, r9 must be 1, 4, 7; if r3 is 2, r9 must be 2, 5, 8.But given that the sum of r3 + r6 + r9 is 15, which is the maximum possible sum, so each remainder must be at their maximum. Let&#39;s check if this is possible.Suppose r3 is 2 (maximum for 3), r6 is 5 (maximum for 6), r9 is 8 (maximum for 9). Then their sum is 2 + 5 + 8 = 15. Perfect, that&#39;s exactly the sum given. So, that seems possible. But we need to verify if there exists a number N that satisfies these three remainder conditions.So, N ≡ 2 mod 3,N ≡ 5 mod 6,N ≡ 8 mod 9.Is there such a number? Let&#39;s check.First, N ≡ 5 mod 6. Let&#39;s write N as 6k + 5 for some integer k. Now, substitute this into the first congruence: 6k + 5 ≡ 2 mod 3. 6k mod 3 is 0, so 5 mod 3 is 2. So 0 + 2 ≡ 2 mod 3. Which matches the first condition. So, that&#39;s consistent.Now, check the third congruence: 6k + 5 ≡ 8 mod 9. Let&#39;s solve for k.6k + 5 ≡ 8 mod 9Subtract 5: 6k ≡ 3 mod 9Divide both sides by 3: 2k ≡ 1 mod 3Multiply both sides by 2 inverse mod 3. Since 2*2=4≡1 mod3, so inverse of 2 is 2.Thus, k ≡ 2*1 ≡ 2 mod3.So, k = 3m + 2 for some integer m. Therefore, N = 6*(3m + 2) + 5 = 18m + 12 + 5 = 18m + 17.Therefore, N ≡17 mod18. So the remainder when divided by 18 is 17. Therefore, the answer is 17.Wait, but let&#39;s check another way. Let&#39;s verify if N=17 satisfies the original conditions.17 divided by 3: 5*3=15, remainder 2. Good.17 divided by 6: 2*6=12, remainder 5. Good.17 divided by 9: 1*9=9, remainder 8. Good.Sum of remainders: 2+5+8=15. Correct. So 17 is such a number, and the remainder mod18 is 17.But let&#39;s check the next number in the sequence: 18m +17. Next one is 35.35 divided by 3: 11*3=33, remainder 2. Good.35 divided by 6: 5*6=30, remainder 5. Good.35 divided by 9: 3*9=27, remainder 8. Good. Sum 2+5+8=15. Correct.So, all such numbers are 17, 35, 53, etc., which are all ≡17 mod18. Therefore, the remainder is 17.But wait, is there any other possibility where the sum is 15 but the remainders are not all maximum? Let&#39;s check.Suppose that maybe r3, r6, r9 are not all maximum, but their sum is 15. For example, if r3 is 2, r6 is 5, then r9 must be 8, which is the maximum. If r3 is less than 2, say 1, then r6 can be up to 4 (since r6 ≡1 mod3, so possible remainders 1,4; maximum 4), and r9 can be up to 7 (since r9 ≡1 mod3, so 1,4,7; maximum 7). So sum would be 1 + 4 +7=12 &lt;15. Similarly, if r3 is 0, then r6 can be 0 or 3 (max 3), r9 can be 0,3,6 (max 6). Sum 0 +3 +6=9 &lt;15.If r3 is 2, then r6 can be 2 or 5 (max 5), r9 can be 2,5,8 (max8). Sum 2 +5 +8=15. So only when r3, r6, r9 are all maximum, their sum is 15. So in this case, the only possible combination is r3=2, r6=5, r9=8. Therefore, the number must be ≡2 mod3, ≡5 mod6, ≡8 mod9.As we saw earlier, solving those congruences gives N≡17 mod18. Therefore, the remainder when divided by18 is 17.Therefore, the answer should be 17.Final AnswerThe remainder when the number is divided by 18 is boxed{17}.&lt;/think&gt;Let ( N ) be the positive integer in question. Denote the remainders when ( N ) is divided by 3, 6, and 9 as ( r_3 ), ( r_6 ), and ( r_9 ) respectively. We know that ( r_3 + r_6 + r_9 = 15 ).1. Possible Values of Remainders:   - ( r_3 ) can be 0, 1, or 2.   - ( r_6 ) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.   - ( r_9 ) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.2. Maximizing the Sum:   - The maximum values for ( r_3 ), ( r_6 ), and ( r_9 ) are 2, 5, and 8 respectively.   - Their sum is ( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 ), which matches the given sum.3. Checking Consistency:   - If ( r_3 = 2 ), then ( N equiv 2 pmod{3} ).   - If ( r_6 = 5 ), then ( N equiv 5 pmod{6} ).   - If ( r_9 = 8 ), then ( N equiv 8 pmod{9} ).4. Solving the Congruences:   - From ( N equiv 5 pmod{6} ), write ( N = 6k + 5 ).   - Substitute into ( N equiv 2 pmod{3} ): ( 6k + 5 equiv 2 pmod{3} ) simplifies to ( 2 equiv 2 pmod{3} ), which is true.   - Substitute into ( N equiv 8 pmod{9} ): ( 6k + 5 equiv 8 pmod{9} ) simplifies to ( 6k equiv 3 pmod{9} ). Dividing by 3, ( 2k equiv 1 pmod{3} ). The multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 3 is 2, so ( k equiv 2 pmod{3} ). Thus, ( k = 3m + 2 ).5. Finding ( N ):   - Substitute ( k = 3m + 2 ) into ( N = 6k + 5 ): ( N = 6(3m + 2) + 5 = 18m + 17 ).   - Therefore, ( N equiv 17 pmod{18} ).The remainder when ( N ) is divided by 18 is (boxed{17}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, the problem says that Toma thought of a positive integer and found the remainders when it is divided by 3, 6, and 9. The sum of these three remainders is 15. We need to find the remainder when the number is divided by 18. Hmm, okay.First, let me restate the problem in my own words. There&#39;s a number N. When we divide N by 3, we get some remainder, let&#39;s call it r3. When we divide N by 6, the remainder is r6, and when divided by 9, the remainder is r9. We know that r3 + r6 + r9 = 15. And we need to find the remainder when N is divided by 18, let&#39;s call that remainder R.So, the key here is to relate the remainders from divisions by 3, 6, and 9 to the remainder when divided by 18. Since 18 is a multiple of 3, 6, and 9, maybe we can use some properties of congruences here? Or perhaps the Chinese Remainder Theorem? But I need to recall how remainders relate when dividing by different moduli.First, let&#39;s note that when a number is divided by 3, 6, or 9, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2 for division by 3; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for division by 6; and 0 through 8 for division by 9. So, r3 can be 0, 1, or 2; r6 can be 0 to 5; r9 can be 0 to 8. Their sum is 15. Since the maximum possible sum would be 2 + 5 + 8 = 15. Wait, that&#39;s exactly 15. So the sum of the maximum remainders is 15. That seems important.So, if the sum of the remainders is 15, which is the maximum possible sum, that means each remainder must be at its maximum possible value. So, r3 must be 2, r6 must be 5, and r9 must be 8. Is that necessarily the case? Let me check. If each remainder is maximum, then the sum is 2 + 5 + 8 = 15, which matches. If any of the remainders were less than maximum, then the total sum would be less than 15. So, since the sum is exactly 15, all remainders must be maximum. Therefore, r3 = 2, r6 = 5, r9 = 8.Is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose, for example, r3 was 1 instead of 2. Then, to get the sum up to 15, the other two remainders would need to add up to 14. But the maximum possible sum for r6 and r9 is 5 + 8 = 13, which is not enough. Similarly, if r3 is 0, then the other two would need to add up to 15, but 5 + 8 = 13 is still the max. So, indeed, r3 must be 2. Then, if r3 is 2, then the sum of r6 and r9 must be 13. The maximum possible for r6 is 5, and for r9 is 8. 5 + 8 = 13. So, yes, that&#39;s the only way. Therefore, the remainders must be 2, 5, and 8.So, now we know that N ≡ 2 mod 3, N ≡ 5 mod 6, and N ≡ 8 mod 9. We need to find N mod 18.Hmm. Let&#39;s see. Let me write down these congruencies:1. N ≡ 2 mod 32. N ≡ 5 mod 63. N ≡ 8 mod 9We need to find N mod 18.Since 18 is the least common multiple of 3, 6, and 9, perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s try to find a number that satisfies all three congruencies modulo 18.First, let&#39;s note that congruence modulo 6 implies congruence modulo 3 because 6 is a multiple of 3. So, if N ≡ 5 mod 6, then N ≡ 5 mod 3. But 5 mod 3 is equivalent to 2 mod 3. Which matches our first congruence (N ≡ 2 mod 3). Therefore, the first congruence is actually redundant because it&#39;s implied by the second one. So, we only need to consider N ≡ 5 mod 6 and N ≡ 8 mod 9. Let&#39;s check that.Yes, because 5 mod 3 is 2, which is the first congruence, so the first congruence doesn&#39;t add new information. Therefore, our key congruences are N ≡ 5 mod 6 and N ≡ 8 mod 9. Let&#39;s work with these two to solve for N mod 18.So, we need to solve for N such that:N ≡ 5 mod 6N ≡ 8 mod 9We can write N = 6k + 5 for some integer k. Then substitute into the second equation:6k + 5 ≡ 8 mod 9Subtract 5 from both sides:6k ≡ 3 mod 9Simplify:6k ≡ 3 mod 9Divide both sides by 3:2k ≡ 1 mod 3So, 2k ≡ 1 mod 3. Let&#39;s solve for k.Multiplying both sides by 2 (the inverse of 2 mod 3 is 2, since 2*2=4≡1 mod3):k ≡ 2*1 ≡ 2 mod3Therefore, k ≡ 2 mod3. So, k = 3m + 2 for some integer m.Then, substituting back into N:N = 6k +5 =6*(3m +2) +5=18m +12 +5=18m +17.Therefore, N ≡17 mod18. So, the remainder when N is divided by18 is17.Wait, but let me check this. Let&#39;s test this solution.If N ≡17 mod18, then:N divided by3: 17 mod3 is 2 (since 3*5=15, 17-15=2). That&#39;s correct.N divided by6: 17 mod6 is 5 (since 6*2=12, 17-12=5). Correct.N divided by9: 17 mod9 is8 (since 9*1=9, 17-9=8). Correct.So, the sum of remainders is2+5+8=15, which matches the given condition. Therefore, the remainder when divided by18 is17.But let me make sure there are no other possible solutions. Since we have mod6 and mod9, and LCM(6,9)=18, so solutions repeat every18. So, there is a unique solution mod18, which is17. Therefore, the answer is17.But just to make sure, let me think if there is another possible value. Suppose there was a different N that satisfies the same conditions but gives a different remainder mod18. But since LCM(6,9)=18, the Chinese Remainder Theorem says that there is a unique solution modulo18, so17 is the only possible remainder.Therefore, the answer is17.Final Answerboxed{17}&lt;/think&gt;Given a positive integer ( N ), we know the remainders when ( N ) is divided by 3, 6, and 9 are such that their sum is 15. We need to find the remainder when ( N ) is divided by 18.1. The possible remainders when dividing by 3, 6, and 9 are:   - ( r_3 ) (remainder when divided by 3) can be 0, 1, or 2.   - ( r_6 ) (remainder when divided by 6) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.   - ( r_9 ) (remainder when divided by 9) can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 8.2. The sum of these remainders is 15. The maximum possible sum of the remainders is ( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 ). Therefore, each remainder must be at its maximum value:   - ( r_3 = 2 )   - ( r_6 = 5 )   - ( r_9 = 8 )3. This gives us the congruences:   - ( N equiv 2 pmod{3} )   - ( N equiv 5 pmod{6} )   - ( N equiv 8 pmod{9} )4. Since ( N equiv 5 pmod{6} ) implies ( N equiv 2 pmod{3} ), we only need to solve the system:   - ( N equiv 5 pmod{6} )   - ( N equiv 8 pmod{9} )5. Let ( N = 6k + 5 ). Substituting into the second congruence:   [   6k + 5 equiv 8 pmod{9} implies 6k equiv 3 pmod{9} implies 2k equiv 1 pmod{3}   ]   Solving for ( k ):   [   2k equiv 1 pmod{3} implies k equiv 2 pmod{3} implies k = 3m + 2 text{ for some integer } m   ]6. Substituting back:   [   N = 6(3m + 2) + 5 = 18m + 12 + 5 = 18m + 17   ]   Therefore, ( N equiv 17 pmod{18} ).The remainder when ( N ) is divided by 18 is (boxed{17}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a2ce2ec></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>🔑:</span>7.4. The remainder when this number is divided by 18 is 17.Since the remainders when divided by 3, 6, and 9 do not exceed 2, 5, and 8 respectively, the sum of these three remainders is always no more than 2+5+8=15. Since their sum is equal to 15, these three remainders must be 2, 5, and 8. Furthermore, since the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is 8, the remainder when it is divided by 18 can only be 8 or 17. If the remainder were 8, then the number would be even. Thus, the remainder when it is divided by 6 could not be 5, leading to a contradiction.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-341a6e3d data-v-3a2ce2ec><div class="review" data-v-3a2ce2ec><div class="review-title" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>❓:</span>1 cdot 29 Given lg 2=0.30103, calculate how many digits M=1+10^{4}+frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)}{1 cdot 2}+ frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)left(10^{4}-2right)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}+cdots+frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)}{1 cdot 2}+10^{4}+1 has.</div><div class="divider" data-v-3a2ce2ec></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have to figure out how many digits the number M has. The expression for M is given as a sum starting with 1, then 10^4, followed by a bunch of terms that look like combinations or something, and then it ends with 10^4 and 1 again. Hmm. Let me write it down step by step to understand better.So M is:1 + 10^4 + [10^4*(10^4 - 1)/(1*2)] + [10^4*(10^4 -1)*(10^4 -2)/(1*2*3)] + ... + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] + 10^4 + 1.Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check the structure again. The problem statement says:M = 1 + 10^4 + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] + [10^4*(10^4 -1)*(10^4 -2)/1*2*3] + ... + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] + 10^4 + 1.Wait, so the middle terms are decreasing in the numerator&#39;s factors and increasing in the denominator&#39;s factors. The denominators are 1, 1*2, 1*2*3, etc. So that looks like binomial coefficients. Let me see: the general term seems to be C(10^4, k) where k goes from 0 to 10^4, but wait, but the sum is written as starting from 1, then 10^4, then the next terms. Wait, but binomial coefficients sum from k=0 to n as C(n,k). Let me check.Wait, the first term is 1, which would correspond to C(n,0). Then the next term is 10^4, which is C(n,1). Then the next term is [10^4*(10^4 -1)/2], which is C(n,2). Then the next term is [10^4*(10^4 -1)*(10^4 -2)/6], which is C(n,3). Then it says &quot;...&quot;, so continuing up to the middle terms, and then it says &quot;+ ... + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] + 10^4 +1&quot;. Wait, that seems like the terms are increasing up to some point and then decreasing again? Or maybe it&#39;s symmetric? Because after the middle, it goes back to lower terms. Wait, that&#39;s confusing. Let me count the terms.Wait, if we start from 1 (k=0), then add C(n,1) = 10^4, then C(n,2), then C(n,3), ..., up to C(n, n). But the problem statement lists the terms as starting with 1, then 10^4, then C(n,2), then C(n,3), and so on, but then towards the end, it lists C(n,2) again, then 10^4, then 1. Wait, that can&#39;t be right. Wait, maybe it&#39;s a typo? Let me check the original problem again.Original problem: &quot;M=1+10^{4}+frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)}{1 cdot 2}+ frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)left(10^{4}-2right)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}+cdots+frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)}{1 cdot 2}+10^{4}+1&quot;Wait, so it starts with 1, then 10^4, then two terms with combinations: C(10^4,2), C(10^4,3), then &quot;...&quot;, then goes back to C(10^4,2), then 10^4, then 1. That seems like the terms go up to some point and then come back down, making the sum symmetric. But actually, the sum of all binomial coefficients from k=0 to k=n is 2^n. But here, the expression seems to have terms from k=0 to k=3 and then back down, but that doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, maybe the problem statement is written incorrectly? Because normally, the expansion of (1+1)^n is the sum of C(n,k) from k=0 to n, which is 2^n. But here, the terms listed are 1, n, C(n,2), C(n,3), ..., C(n,2), n, 1. That seems like a symmetric expansion, but if n is 10^4, then the number of terms would be 10^4 +1, but the way it&#39;s written here, the middle term would be C(n, n/2) if n is even. But 10^4 is even. Wait, but 10^4 is 10000, so the middle term would be C(10000, 5000). But the problem statement doesn&#39;t mention that. Instead, the terms after the ellipsis go back down to C(n,2), n, 1. So perhaps the sum is not the full binomial expansion but only up to certain terms and then back? That seems odd.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a misinterpretation here. Let me check the problem again. It says:M = 1 + 10^4 + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/(1*2)] + [10^4*(10^4 -1)*(10^4 -2)/(1*2*3)] + ... + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] + 10^4 + 1.Wait, so after the ellipsis, the terms start decreasing again. So it&#39;s like 1, C(n,1), C(n,2), C(n,3), ..., C(n,3), C(n,2), C(n,1), 1. That would make the sum symmetric, but why would someone write it like that? Unless it&#39;s a typo and they meant to include all terms up to C(n, n), which would be 1, but then the sum would be 2^n. Wait, but 2^10000 is a gigantic number with about 3010 digits, but the problem mentions that lg 2=0.30103, which is log base 10. Wait, if M were 2^10000, then the number of digits would be log10(2^10000) +1 = 10000*log10(2) +1 ≈ 10000*0.30103 +1=3010.3 +1≈3011 digits. But maybe M is not 2^10000. Wait, but the given expression for M seems like the binomial expansion of (1+1)^n, which is 2^n. So if n=10000, then M=2^10000. But why does the problem list the terms as going up and then back down? That would imply that the sum is 1 + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + ... + C(n,2) + C(n,1) +1, which is 2*(sum from k=0 to k=2 of C(n,k)) -1 - C(n,1) - C(n,0)? Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the ellipsis is meant to indicate all terms up to C(n, n). Let me check the original problem again:&quot;M=1+10^{4}+frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)}{1 cdot 2}+ frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)left(10^{4}-2right)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}+cdots+frac{10^{4}left(10^{4}-1right)}{1 cdot 2}+10^{4}+1&quot;Wait, so after the ellipsis, the terms are decreasing back down. So it&#39;s like 1 + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + C(n,3) + ... + C(n,3) + C(n,2) + C(n,1) +1. That would make the sum symmetric. But if that&#39;s the case, then the number of terms would be 2*(sum from k=0 to k=3) - overlapping terms? Wait, no. For example, if n=4, then the sum would be 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1, which is 16=2^4. Wait, but in that case, the sum is symmetric, but it&#39;s still equal to 2^n. So maybe regardless of how you arrange the terms, if you sum all binomial coefficients from k=0 to n, you get 2^n. So maybe M is actually 2^10000, which would make the number of digits as floor(log10(2^10000)) +1= floor(10000*log10(2)) +1= floor(10000*0.30103) +1= floor(3010.3) +1=3010+1=3011 digits. But the problem says &quot;calculate how many digits M has&quot;, given lg2=0.30103. Wait, but if M is 2^10000, then this is straightforward. But is M equal to 2^10000?Wait, let&#39;s verify. The expression given for M is:1 + 10^4 + [C(10^4,2)] + [C(10^4,3)] + ... + [C(10^4,2)] +10^4 +1.But if the terms go up to C(n, k) and then back down, then for even n, it&#39;s symmetric. For example, for n=4: C(4,0)+C(4,1)+C(4,2)+C(4,3)+C(4,4) = 1+4+6+4+1=16=2^4. So even if the terms are written symmetrically, the sum is still 2^n. Therefore, if n=10^4, M=2^{10^4}. Therefore, the number of digits would be floor(10^4 * lg2) +1= floor(10000*0.30103)+1= floor(3010.3)+1=3010+1=3011 digits. But let me confirm this because maybe there&#39;s a trick here.Wait, but the problem statement writes the sum as 1 + 10^4 + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + ... + C(10^4,2) +10^4 +1. Wait, if it&#39;s written with an ellipsis in the middle, then it&#39;s possible that the sum is not the entire binomial expansion but only up to some term. For example, suppose n=4, and the sum is written as 1 +4 +6 +4 +1, which is 16. But if n=3, the sum would be 1 +3 +3 +1=8=2^3. So in general, if the terms are symmetric, the sum is 2^n. Therefore, regardless of n, if you sum all binomial coefficients from k=0 to n, you get 2^n. Therefore, M=2^{10^4}. Therefore, the number of digits is as calculated above, 3011. But the problem gives lg2=0.30103, so we can compute 10^4 *0.30103=3010.3, so the log10(M)=log10(2^{10000})=10000*log10(2)=3010.3. Then the number of digits is floor(3010.3)+1=3010+1=3011. Therefore, the answer is 3011 digits.But wait, let me make sure that M is indeed equal to 2^{10000}. Because the way the problem is written, it&#39;s possible that the user made a typo and the expression isn&#39;t the full binomial expansion. Let&#39;s check again. The problem says:M=1 +10^4 + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] + [10^4*(10^4 -1)*(10^4 -2)/1*2*3] + ... + [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] +10^4 +1.If the middle terms are symmetric, then yes, it&#39;s the sum of all binomial coefficients. But if the ellipsis is only indicating a few terms, not the entire middle, then maybe not. But given that the first few terms are C(n,0), C(n,1), C(n,2), C(n,3), and the last terms before the ellipsis are C(n,3), then the ellipsis would have to cover the terms up to C(n, n-3), then go back. But in reality, for n=10000, the terms would be symmetric, so C(n,k)=C(n, n-k). Therefore, the sum from k=0 to k=n of C(n,k) is 2^n, which is 2^10000. So unless the problem is summing only part of the binomial coefficients, which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case here, since the expression ends with 1 again, which is C(n,n). Wait, no. Wait, the last term is 1, which is C(n,0)=1, but the term before that is 10^4, which is C(n,1). Wait, no. Wait, in the given problem, the terms after the ellipsis are [10^4*(10^4 -1)/1*2] +10^4 +1. So that is C(n,2) + C(n,1) + C(n,0). Therefore, the structure is:C(n,0) + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + C(n,3) + ... + C(n,2) + C(n,1) + C(n,0). So if this is the case, then the sum is 2*(C(n,0) + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + ... + C(n, floor(n/2))) ) - C(n, floor(n/2)) if n is even. Wait, no. Wait, if you mirror the terms, you end up double-counting except for the middle term when n is even. For example, when n=4:C(4,0)+C(4,1)+C(4,2)+C(4,3)+C(4,4) =1+4+6+4+1=16. If you write it as 1+4+6+4+1, it&#39;s symmetric. So for even n, the middle term is C(n, n/2), and the rest are mirrored. Therefore, the total sum is still 2^n. Therefore, regardless of how you arrange the terms, if you sum all binomial coefficients from k=0 to k=n, you get 2^n. Therefore, M=2^{10000}, so the number of digits is floor(10000*log10(2)) +1= floor(3010.3)+1=3011.Therefore, the answer is boxed{3011}. But wait, let me confirm once more. Maybe the problem is not summing all the terms, but the way it&#39;s written is ambiguous. For example, if the ellipsis represents continuing up to the term C(n, k) and then going back down, but if for some reason it&#39;s not including all terms, then the sum might not be 2^n. But given the problem statement&#39;s expression, it starts with 1, then adds terms up to C(n,3), then &quot;...&quot;, then goes back to C(n,2), C(n,1), 1. That would suggest that only terms up to C(n,3) are included on both sides, which is not the full sum. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the entire binomial expansion, written symmetrically, hence M=2^{10000}. Since the problem gives lg2=0.30103, which is log10(2), and asks for the number of digits, which would be floor(log10(M))+1. Therefore, log10(2^{10000})=10000*0.30103=3010.3, floor(3010.3)=3010, so digits=3010+1=3011. So yes, the answer is 3011.Final Answerboxed{3011}&lt;/think&gt;The problem requires calculating the number of digits in the number ( M ) given by the sum:[ M = 1 + 10^4 + frac{10^4(10^4 - 1)}{1 cdot 2} + frac{10^4(10^4 - 1)(10^4 - 2)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3} + cdots + frac{10^4(10^4 - 1)}{1 cdot 2} + 10^4 + 1 ]This sum is recognized as the binomial expansion of ( (1 + 1)^{10^4} ), which equals ( 2^{10^4} ). The number of digits in a number ( N ) is given by ( lfloor log_{10} N rfloor + 1 ).Given ( lg 2 = 0.30103 ), we calculate:[log_{10}(2^{10^4}) = 10^4 cdot log_{10}(2) = 10000 cdot 0.30103 = 3010.3]Taking the floor value and adding 1:[lfloor 3010.3 rfloor + 1 = 3010 + 1 = 3011]Thus, the number of digits in ( M ) is (boxed{3011}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the number of digits in the number M. The expression for M is given as a sum of several terms. Let me try to parse this.The problem says:M = 1 + 10^4 + [10^4(10^4 - 1)]/(1·2) + [10^4(10^4 -1)(10^4 -2)]/(1·2·3) + ... + [10^4(10^4 -1)]/(1·2) + 10^4 + 1Hmm. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write out the terms step by step.First term: 1Second term: 10^4Third term: [10^4*(10^4 -1)]/(1*2)Fourth term: [10^4*(10^4 -1)*(10^4 -2)]/(1*2*3)Then it says &quot;...&quot;, so continuing like that, and then at the end, it has [10^4*(10^4 -1)]/(1*2) + 10^4 +1 again. Wait, that seems redundant. Maybe it&#39;s a typo? Let me check.Original problem:M = 1 + 10^{4} + frac{10^{4}(10^{4} -1)}{1 cdot 2} + frac{10^{4}(10^{4} -1)(10^{4}-2)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3} + cdots + frac{10^{4}(10^{4} -1)}{1 cdot 2} + 10^{4} +1Wait, so starting from 1, then 10^4, then the next term is the combination term C(10^4, 2), then C(10^4,3), and so on, but then at the end, it goes back to C(10^4,2), then 10^4, then 1. That seems like a symmetric expansion. So, perhaps the terms are symmetric? Like the coefficients are increasing up to a point and then decreasing again? Hmm. Wait, but combinations don&#39;t do that unless you have a symmetric structure. Wait, actually, the combination terms C(n, k) are symmetric, so C(n, k) = C(n, n -k). So if you go from k=0 to n, the coefficients increase to the middle and then decrease. But here, in the given M, the terms start at 1 (which is C(10^4, 0)), then C(10^4,1), C(10^4,2), C(10^4,3), and so on, but then at the end, after the ellipsis, it goes back to C(10^4,2), C(10^4,1), C(10^4,0). So essentially, the entire sum is the sum of all combination terms from k=0 to k=3 and then back to k=0? Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, the problem as written is:1 + 10^4 + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + ... + C(10^4,2) + 10^4 +1But that would mean that the sum is symmetric, increasing up to some point and then decreasing. However, if we have all the terms from k=0 to k=10^4, the sum would be 2^{10^4}. But here, the terms are only up to k=3? Wait, no, the problem has an ellipsis, so maybe the terms continue until the middle term and then decrease again? Wait, but the expression as written is:1 + 10^4 + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + ... + C(10^4,2) +10^4 +1Wait, that seems like after the ellipsis, it goes back to C(10^4,2). So perhaps it&#39;s only summing up to C(10^4,3) and then back down? That would make a palindromic sequence. For example:1 (C(10^4,0)), 10^4 (C(10^4,1)), C(10^4,2), C(10^4,3), C(10^4,2), 10^4,1But then the total terms would be 1 +1 +2 +2 +...? Wait, but how many terms are there? Alternatively, maybe the ellipsis represents a symmetric continuation. Wait, but if we have a sum that goes up to the middle term and then back down, the total sum would be 2^{10^4} minus the middle term if 10^4 is even or something. But 10^4 is 10000, which is even. So, the sum from k=0 to k=10000 of C(10000,k) is 2^10000. If instead, we sum from k=0 to some m and then back to k=0, that would be different.Wait, the problem is written as:1 +10^4 + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + ... + C(10^4,2) +10^4 +1So, perhaps the terms increase up to C(10^4,3) and then decrease again? That would be: 1, C(1), C(2), C(3), C(2), C(1), 1. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the ellipsis is meant to indicate that it continues up to C(10^4,10^4), but that&#39;s just 1, so the entire sum would be 2^{10^4}. But then why write it like that? The original problem is:M=1 + 10^{4} + frac{10^{4}(10^{4} -1)}{1 cdot 2} + frac{10^{4}(10^{4} -1)(10^{4} -2)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3} + cdots + frac{10^{4}(10^{4} -1)}{1 cdot 2} +10^{4} +1Wait, starting from 1, then 10^4, then C(10^4,2), then C(10^4,3), ..., then C(10^4,2), 10^4,1. So, the terms go up to C(10^4,3) and then back down? But that would be a very short sequence. Alternatively, maybe the ellipsis is indicating that it goes all the way up to C(10^4, 10^4 -1) and then back down? Wait, but that would be equivalent to summing all the terms from k=0 to k=10^4 twice, except for the middle term. Wait, but 10^4 is even, so there is a middle term C(10^4, 5000). Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem is a misprint or a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the sum is the expansion of (1 +1)^{10^4} which is 2^{10^4}, but written out with the terms in order. Wait, but the given sum seems to have symmetry. Let me check again.Original expression:M = 1 + 10^4 + [C(10^4,2)] + [C(10^4,3)] + ... + [C(10^4,2)] +10^4 +1So, if you parse this, starting from 1, then 10^4, then the next term is C(10^4,2), then C(10^4,3), then ... (the ellipsis), then C(10^4,2), then 10^4, then 1. So, the sequence is 1, C(1), C(2), C(3), ..., C(2), C(1), 1. That seems like a symmetric sequence where it goes up to some term and then back down. However, the combination numbers are not symmetric in that way unless you reach the middle. For example, in binomial coefficients, C(n,k) = C(n, n -k). So, if we have n = 10^4, which is 10000, then C(10000, k) = C(10000, 10000 -k). So, if the sum is going up to C(10000,3) and then back down, that would mean the terms are:1, C(1), C(2), C(3), C(2), C(1), 1But in the problem, after the ellipsis, it&#39;s written as ... + C(10^4,2) +10^4 +1. So perhaps the ellipsis represents a continuation up to C(10^4, 5000) or something? But the problem as written is ambiguous. However, given that the problem is presented in a way that seems like the sum is symmetric, maybe the entire binomial expansion is being considered, but written out with the terms mirrored. However, in that case, the sum would be 2 times 2^{10000} minus the middle term, which is not the case. Wait, actually, if you list all the terms from k=0 to k=10000 and then again from k=10000 down to k=0, the total sum would be 2*2^{10000} -1 (since the middle term is counted twice). But that seems way too large, and the problem is presented with specific terms.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a miswrite, and the intended expression is the sum of all binomial coefficients from k=0 to k=10000, which would be 2^{10000}, and then the number of digits is calculated using logarithms. But in that case, why is the problem written with terms going up and then down?Wait, another possibility: the problem is written in a way that the user is trying to represent the sum as 1 + 10^4 + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + ... + C(10^4,10^4 -2) + C(10^4,10^4 -1) +1, which is actually the same as the full binomial expansion sum, which equals 2^{10^4}. So, maybe the problem is just a verbose way of writing 2^{10000}, and the user wants the number of digits in 2^{10000}, given that lg 2 = 0.30103.But let&#39;s check:If M = sum_{k=0}^{10000} C(10000, k) = 2^{10000}, then the number of digits is floor(log10(M)) +1 = floor(10000 * log10(2)) +1. Given that log10(2) ≈0.30103, then 10000 * 0.30103 = 3010.3, so floor(3010.3) +1 = 3011 digits. Therefore, the answer would be 3011 digits. However, the problem statement is written in a way that the sum is written as 1 +10^4 + ... +1, which might be intended to represent the full binomial expansion.But wait, in the given problem, the terms after the ellipsis are repeated. Let me check again:Original M:1 + 10^4 + [10^4(10^4 -1)/(1·2)] + [10^4(10^4 -1)(10^4 -2)/(1·2·3)] + ... + [10^4(10^4 -1)/(1·2)] +10^4 +1So, the terms after the ellipsis go back to [10^4(10^4 -1)/(1·2)], then 10^4, then 1. So, this seems like the sum is constructed as:Term 0: 1 = C(10^4, 0)Term 1: 10^4 = C(10^4,1)Term 2: C(10^4,2)Term 3: C(10^4,3)...Then after the ellipsis, Term n-3: C(10^4,3)Term n-2: C(10^4,2)Term n-1: C(10^4,1)Term n: C(10^4,0)Wait, but that would be the full binomial expansion, which is symmetric. However, if written out in full, the terms would go up to C(10^4, 5000) and then back down. But in the problem, after the ellipsis, it only lists ..., C(10^4,2), 10^4,1. So, unless the ellipsis skips the middle terms, which is possible. But then the problem is missing the middle terms. So maybe the problem is a typo and actually wants the full binomial expansion sum. Because if we compute 2^{10000}, then the number of digits is straightforward with the given log10(2).Alternatively, if the problem is as written, with the terms going up to C(10^4,3) and then back down, then the sum would be 1 +10^4 + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + C(10^4,2) +10^4 +1. But that seems very small compared to 2^{10000}, and calculating the number of digits would be different.But the problem mentions &quot;...&quot; which usually denotes continuation of the pattern. So perhaps the pattern is increasing up to a certain point and then decreasing. If the sum is a palindrome of the binomial coefficients, that is, the sum from k=0 to 3 and then back to 0, but given that after the ellipsis it&#39;s ..., C(10^4,2), 10^4,1. But that would only include terms up to k=3 and back, which is a very short sum, but then the number of digits would be small. However, given that the problem gives lg2=0.30103, which is useful for calculating powers of 2, and 2^10000 is a huge number, but if M is the binomial expansion sum, which is 2^10000, then the number of digits would be as calculated before.Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the sum is supposed to be the sum of combinations C(10^4, k) for k from 0 to 4, but that would be 1 +10^4 + C(10^4,2)+ C(10^4,3)+ C(10^4,4). Then the total would be a much smaller number, but with the given terms.Wait, in the original problem, the terms after the ellipsis are again C(10^4,2), 10^4,1. So, if we take the sum as 1 +10^4 + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + ... + C(10^4,2) +10^4 +1, then the structure is symmetric. Let&#39;s count the number of terms:- 1 (C(0))- 10^4 (C(1))- C(2)- C(3)- ...- C(2)- C(1)- C(0)But this would imply that we have terms up to C(3), then back to C(2), C(1), C(0). However, unless specified how far the ellipsis goes, this is ambiguous. If the ellipsis is meant to continue up to some term and then back down, then the problem is ill-posed.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a telescoped version of the binomial expansion. For example, if you write the binomial expansion of (1 +1)^n, which is sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k). But here, the problem writes the terms in a symmetric way, but perhaps it&#39;s just a redundant way of writing the same sum. If that&#39;s the case, then M = 2^{10^4} = 2^{10000}, and the number of digits would be floor(10000 * log10(2)) +1. Since log10(2) is given as 0.30103, then 10000 * 0.30103 = 3010.3, so floor(3010.3) = 3010, and adding 1 gives 3011 digits. Hence, the answer would be 3011.But to be sure, let&#39;s check with smaller numbers. For example, take n=2:If n=2, then M=1 + 2 + C(2,2) + C(2,1) +1. Wait, but that would be 1 +2 +1 +2 +1=7. However, 2^2=4, which is different. So in this case, the sum is not equal to 2^n. So maybe the problem isn&#39;t the binomial expansion. Hmm. Wait, but for n=2, the given expression would be:1 +2 + [2*1/2] + ... + [2*1/2] +2 +1. But [2*1/2] is 1, so the terms would be 1 +2 +1 +1 +2 +1 = 8. Wait, which is 2^3=8. Wait, that&#39;s strange. Wait, 1 +2 +1 +1 +2 +1. Wait, that seems inconsistent.Alternatively, maybe the problem is the sum from k=0 to n of C(n,k) twice, except for overlapping terms? I&#39;m confused. Alternatively, maybe the problem is the sum of all combinations from k=0 to k=n, but written in a symmetric fashion. But when n=2, that would be 1 +2 +1, sum=4, which is 2^2. But according to the structure given, for n=2, it would be 1 +2 + [2*1/2] + ... + [2*1/2] +2 +1. Wait, [2*1/2] is 1, so the sum would be 1 +2 +1 +1 +2 +1=8, which is 2^3=8. So here, n=2 but the sum becomes 2^{3}=8, which is inconsistent. Therefore, the original problem&#39;s structure is leading to a different sum than the binomial expansion.Wait, so maybe the given expression is not the binomial expansion. Let me check again. Let&#39;s parse the terms:Term 1: 1Term 2: 10^4Term 3: [10^4*(10^4 -1)]/(1*2)Term 4: [10^4*(10^4 -1)*(10^4 -2)]/(1*2*3)... Then after some terms, it goes back to Term n-3: [10^4*(10^4 -1)]/(1*2)Term n-2:10^4Term n-1:1So, the terms are:1, C(10^4,1), C(10^4,2), C(10^4,3), ..., C(10^4,2), C(10^4,1),1This seems like the sum is:C(10^4,0) + C(10^4,1) + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,3) + ... + C(10^4,2) + C(10^4,1) + C(10^4,0)Which is equivalent to 2 * [C(10^4,0) + C(10^4,1) + C(10^4,2) + ... + C(10^4, floor((10^4 -1)/2))] + C(10^4, 5000) if 10^4 is even.But 10^4 is 10000, which is even, so the middle term is C(10000,5000). Therefore, the total sum would be 2*(sum_{k=0}^{4999} C(10000,k)) + C(10000,5000). But the problem&#39;s expression doesn&#39;t mention the middle term. However, given the way the terms are written, with the ellipsis in the middle, it&#39;s possible that the middle term is included once. Therefore, the total sum would be equal to sum_{k=0}^{10000} C(10000,k) = 2^{10000}, which is the same as the binomial expansion. Therefore, maybe the problem is written in a symmetric way, but it&#39;s equivalent to the full binomial expansion.Thus, M = 2^{10000}, and the number of digits is floor(10000 * log10(2)) +1. Using the given value of log10(2)=0.30103, compute 10000 *0.30103=3010.3. Therefore, the floor is 3010, and adding 1 gives 3011 digits.Therefore, the answer is boxed{3011}.But let me verify once again to be absolutely sure. If the problem&#39;s expression for M is indeed the binomial expansion sum, then M=2^{10000}. To find the number of digits, we use the formula: number of digits = floor(log10(M)) +1.Compute log10(M) = log10(2^{10000}) =10000*log10(2)=10000*0.30103=3010.3Then floor(3010.3)=3010, so the number of digits is 3010 +1=3011. Therefore, 3011 digits.Alternatively, if the problem&#39;s expression is not the full binomial expansion, but a partial sum, but given the symmetric structure and the ellipsis, it&#39;s more likely that the problem is expecting the full binomial expansion. Hence, the answer is 3011.Final AnswerThe number of digits in ( M ) is boxed{3011}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem of calculating the number of digits in ( M ), we start by recognizing that ( M ) is structured as a sum of binomial coefficients. The expression for ( M ) is:[M = 1 + 10^4 + frac{10^4(10^4 - 1)}{1 cdot 2} + frac{10^4(10^4 - 1)(10^4 - 2)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3} + cdots + frac{10^4(10^4 - 1)}{1 cdot 2} + 10^4 + 1]This sum is recognized as the binomial expansion of ( (1 + 1)^{10^4} ), which simplifies to ( 2^{10^4} ). The number of digits in a number ( N ) can be found using the formula ( lfloor log_{10} N rfloor + 1 ).Given ( lg 2 = 0.30103 ), we calculate:[log_{10}(2^{10000}) = 10000 cdot log_{10}(2) = 10000 cdot 0.30103 = 3010.3]Taking the floor value of ( 3010.3 ) and adding 1 gives:[lfloor 3010.3 rfloor + 1 = 3010 + 1 = 3011]Thus, the number of digits in ( M ) is (boxed{3011}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a2ce2ec></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>🔑:</span>[Solution]begin{aligned}M= &amp; (1+1)^{10^{4}}=2^{10000} lg M &amp; =10000 lg 2 &amp; =10000 times 0.30103 &amp; =3010.3end{aligned}Therefore, M has 3011 digits.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-341a6e3d data-v-3a2ce2ec><div class="review" data-v-3a2ce2ec><div class="review-title" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>❓:</span>5.

Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the problem. There&#39;s the origin O, and points P, A, B with their respective position vectors. The coordinates are given as:- OP vector: (2,1), so point P is at (2,1)- OA vector: (1,7), so point A is at (1,7)- OB vector: (5,1), so point B is at (5,1)Point C lies somewhere on the line OP. Since OP is a line from the origin to P(2,1), any point C on OP can be represented parametrically. Let me denote the parameter as t. So, the position vector OC would be t*(2,1), right? Because starting from the origin, moving along OP, the coordinates would scale linearly with some parameter t. So OC = (2t, t) where t is a real number. That makes sense because when t=0, we&#39;re at the origin, and when t=1, we&#39;re at point P.Now, I need to find the value of t such that the dot product of vectors CA and CB is minimized. Let&#39;s recall that the dot product of two vectors u = (u1, u2) and v = (v1, v2) is given by u1*v1 + u2*v2. So, I need to express vectors CA and CB in terms of t, compute their dot product, and then find the t that minimizes this expression.First, let&#39;s find vectors CA and CB. Vector CA is the vector from point C to point A, so it can be calculated as OA - OC. Similarly, vector CB is OB - OC. Since OA, OB, and OC are position vectors, subtracting OC from OA and OB gives the vectors from C to A and C to B, respectively.So, OA is (1,7), OC is (2t, t), so CA = OA - OC = (1 - 2t, 7 - t).Similarly, OB is (5,1), so CB = OB - OC = (5 - 2t, 1 - t).Now, the dot product of CA and CB would be:CA ⋅ CB = (1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) + (7 - t)(1 - t)Let me compute each component step by step.First, compute the x-component product: (1 - 2t)(5 - 2t)Multiply this out:1*5 + 1*(-2t) -2t*5 -2t*(-2t)= 5 - 2t -10t + 4t²= 5 -12t +4t²Now, the y-component product: (7 - t)(1 - t)Multiply this out:7*1 + 7*(-t) -t*1 + t*t= 7 -7t -t + t²= 7 -8t + t²So, adding both components together for the dot product:CA ⋅ CB = (5 -12t +4t²) + (7 -8t + t²)= 5 +7 -12t -8t +4t² + t²= 12 -20t +5t²So, the dot product simplifies to the quadratic function 5t² -20t +12.Now, we need to find the value of t that minimizes this quadratic function. Since the coefficient of t² is positive (5), the parabola opens upwards, so the minimum occurs at the vertex.Recall that for a quadratic function ax² + bx + c, the vertex occurs at t = -b/(2a).Here, a = 5, b = -20, so t = -(-20)/(2*5) = 20/10 = 2.Wait, so t = 2? But hold on, OP is the line from the origin to P(2,1). If t=2, then OC would be (2*2, 1*2) = (4,2), but point P is at (2,1), so t=1 is P. So t=2 would be beyond point P on the line OP extended. But the problem says &quot;C is a point on the line OP&quot;. Hmm, does OP refer only to the segment from O to P, or the entire line? The problem says &quot;the line OP&quot;, so that&#39;s the entire line, not just the segment. So even though t=2 is beyond P, it&#39;s still on the line OP. So, mathematically, t can be any real number, positive or negative, giving any point on the line.But let me verify if that&#39;s the case. The problem states &quot;C is a point on the line OP&quot;, and since OP is a line, unless specified otherwise, it&#39;s the entire line. So, t can be any real number, so t=2 is allowed.But wait, let&#39;s check. Let me compute the value of the dot product at t=2. If t=2, then OC is (4,2). Then, CA is OA - OC = (1 - 4, 7 - 2) = (-3,5). CB is OB - OC = (5 - 4, 1 - 2) = (1,-1). The dot product of CA and CB is (-3)(1) + (5)(-1) = -3 -5 = -8. Is this the minimum?Wait, but according to the quadratic function, 5t² -20t +12, at t=2, it&#39;s 5*(4) -20*(2) +12 = 20 -40 +12 = -8. So that&#39;s correct. Let&#39;s check another value. Let&#39;s try t=1. Then OC is (2,1). CA is (1 -2,7 -1) = (-1,6). CB is (5 -2,1 -1) = (3,0). The dot product is (-1)(3) + (6)(0) = -3 +0 = -3. So that&#39;s higher than -8. Hmm, so the dot product is lower at t=2 than at t=1. What about t=0? OC is (0,0). Then CA is OA - OC = (1,7). CB is OB - OC = (5,1). Their dot product is 1*5 +7*1=5 +7=12, which is positive. So definitely, higher. So t=2 gives a lower value.But wait, what if t is greater than 2? Let&#39;s try t=3. Then OC is (6,3). CA is (1 -6,7 -3) = (-5,4). CB is (5 -6,1 -3)= (-1,-2). Their dot product is (-5)(-1) + (4)(-2) =5 -8= -3. Which is higher than -8. So t=3 gives a dot product of -3, which is higher (less negative) than -8. So t=2 seems to be the minimum.But let&#39;s verify this using calculus. The quadratic function is f(t) = 5t² -20t +12. The derivative is f’(t)=10t -20. Setting this equal to zero gives 10t -20=0 =&gt; t=2. So that&#39;s the critical point. Since the coefficient of t² is positive, it&#39;s a minimum. Therefore, t=2 is indeed where the minimum occurs.Therefore, the coordinates of OC when the dot product is minimized are (2t, t) with t=2, which gives (4,2). Therefore, the coordinates of vector OC are (4,2). But wait, let me check again if this is on the line OP. The line OP goes from O(0,0) to P(2,1). The parametric equations for OP can be written as x=2t, y=t, where t is any real number. So when t=2, x=4, y=2, which is a point on the line OP extended beyond P. So even though it&#39;s beyond P, it&#39;s still on the line, so the answer is (4,2). But let me check again if my parametric equations are correct.Yes, because direction vector of OP is (2,1), so any point on the line can be written as t*(2,1), where t is a scalar. So t=1 gives P, t=0 gives O, t=2 gives (4,2), etc. So yes, (4,2) is on the line.But wait, the answer seems to be (4,2), but the problem might be expecting a fractional value? Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, let&#39;s recalculate the dot product expression step by step.Vector CA = OA - OC = (1 - 2t, 7 - t)Vector CB = OB - OC = (5 - 2t, 1 - t)Their dot product:(1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) + (7 - t)(1 - t)First term: (1)(5) + (1)(-2t) + (-2t)(5) + (-2t)(-2t) = 5 -2t -10t +4t² = 5 -12t +4t²Second term: (7)(1) + (7)(-t) + (-t)(1) + (-t)(-t) =7 -7t -t +t² =7 -8t +t²Adding them together: 5 +7 -12t -8t +4t² +t² =12 -20t +5t². That&#39;s correct.So the quadratic is 5t² -20t +12. Taking derivative: 10t -20. Setting to zero: t=2. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the coordinates are (4,2). But let me check once again with another method, maybe using projections or something else.Alternatively, maybe parametrize the line OP as points (2t, t) and express the dot product as a function of t, then minimize. Which is exactly what I did. So perhaps the answer is indeed (4,2). Wait, but in the original problem statement, the answer is to be given as coordinates of vector OC. So, yes, (4,2).But wait, I just want to confirm once more. Let&#39;s check if t=2 gives the minimal value.If we plug t=2 into f(t)=5t² -20t +12, we get 5*(4) -20*(2) +12 =20 -40 +12= -8.If we plug t=3: 5*9 -20*3 +12=45-60+12= -3t=1:5 -20 +12= -3Wait, wait, that&#39;s not matching my previous calculation. Wait, when t=1, f(t)=5(1)^2 -20(1) +12=5 -20 +12= -3. But earlier, when I manually calculated at t=1, the dot product was -3. So that&#39;s correct.But when t=2, it&#39;s -8, which is lower. So seems correct. But what about t=2.5? Let&#39;s compute f(2.5)=5*(6.25) -20*(2.5) +12=31.25 -50 +12= -6.75. Which is higher than -8.So the minimum is indeed at t=2, giving -8. So the answer should be OC=(4,2). Therefore, the coordinates of vector OC are (4,2).But let me think again. Maybe there&#39;s another way to approach this problem, perhaps using vector calculus or projections.Alternatively, we can consider the dot product CA ⋅ CB. Let&#39;s expand this expression:CA ⋅ CB = (A - C) ⋅ (B - C) = A ⋅ B - A ⋅ C - B ⋅ C + C ⋅ CBut since A, B, and C are position vectors, A ⋅ B is fixed. Let&#39;s compute each term:A ⋅ B = (1,7) ⋅ (5,1) =1*5 +7*1=5 +7=12A ⋅ C = (1,7) ⋅ (2t, t)=1*2t +7*t=2t +7t=9tB ⋅ C = (5,1) ⋅ (2t, t)=5*2t +1*t=10t +t=11tC ⋅ C = (2t)^2 + (t)^2=4t² +t²=5t²Therefore, substituting back:CA ⋅ CB =12 -9t -11t +5t²=12 -20t +5t². Which matches the earlier result. So same quadratic function. So the minimal value occurs at t=2. Therefore, OC=(4,2). So the answer is (4,2).Wait, but the problem says &quot;when CA ⋅ CB reaches its minimum value, the coordinates of OC are...&quot;, so that would be (4,2). Hmm. But maybe I made a mistake here? Let me check.Alternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the expansion. Let me re-express the dot product using vectors:(A - C) ⋅ (B - C) = A ⋅ B - A ⋅ C - B ⋅ C + C ⋅ CYes, that&#39;s correct. Then substituting:A ⋅ B = 12A ⋅ C =9tB ⋅ C=11tC ⋅ C=5t²Therefore, the expression becomes 12 -9t -11t +5t² =12 -20t +5t². So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the minimal value occurs at t=2, so OC=(4,2). Therefore, the answer should be (4,2). So I think that&#39;s correct.But let me check once again with another perspective. Suppose we consider the line OP parametrized as C(t) = (2t, t). We can think of the function f(t) = CA ⋅ CB =5t² -20t +12. To find its minimum, we take derivative, set to zero, which gives t=2, so C=(4,2). Yes.Alternatively, since the problem is in two dimensions, maybe we can use geometry. The expression CA ⋅ CB is minimized when... Hmm, but I don&#39;t know a direct geometric interpretation of minimizing the dot product. However, since the dot product relates to the cosine of the angle between vectors, but minimizing the dot product could mean either making the vectors point in opposite directions as much as possible or something else, depending on their magnitudes. But since it&#39;s a quadratic function, calculus seems the right approach here.Alternatively, maybe using linear algebra. The dot product can be written as a quadratic form, and we can find the minimum using orthogonal projection. Wait, but in this case, since it&#39;s a quadratic in one variable t, the vertex is straightforward.Alternatively, we can write the dot product as:CA ⋅ CB = |CA||CB|cosθ, where θ is the angle between CA and CB. So minimizing the dot product could be achieved by minimizing |CA||CB|cosθ. But this is a product of three terms, so it&#39;s not straightforward. However, since we have a quadratic in t, calculus gives us the exact minimum.Therefore, after all these checks, I believe that the minimal occurs at t=2, giving OC=(4,2). Therefore, the answer is (4,2), so the coordinates of vector OC are boxed{(4,2)}.Final AnswerThe coordinates of (overrightarrow{O C}) are boxed{(4, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the vectors (overrightarrow{O P} = (2, 1)), (overrightarrow{O A} = (1, 7)), and (overrightarrow{O B} = (5, 1)), we need to find the coordinates of point (C) on the line (OP) such that (overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB}) is minimized.1. Parametric Representation of Point (C):   - Since (C) lies on the line (OP), we can represent (overrightarrow{OC}) as ((2t, t)) where (t) is a real number.2. Vectors (overrightarrow{CA}) and (overrightarrow{CB}):   - (overrightarrow{CA} = overrightarrow{OA} - overrightarrow{OC} = (1 - 2t, 7 - t))   - (overrightarrow{CB} = overrightarrow{OB} - overrightarrow{OC} = (5 - 2t, 1 - t))3. Dot Product Calculation:   - The dot product (overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB}) is calculated as:     [     (1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) + (7 - t)(1 - t)     ]   - Expanding and simplifying:     [     (1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) = 5 - 12t + 4t^2     ]     [     (7 - t)(1 - t) = 7 - 8t + t^2     ]     [     text{Total} = 5 - 12t + 4t^2 + 7 - 8t + t^2 = 12 - 20t + 5t^2     ]4. Minimizing the Quadratic Function:   - The quadratic function (5t^2 - 20t + 12) is minimized at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex occurs at (t = frac{-b}{2a}) for (ax^2 + bx + c).   - Here, (a = 5) and (b = -20), so:     [     t = frac{20}{2 cdot 5} = 2     ]5. Coordinates of (overrightarrow{OC}):   - Substituting (t = 2) into the parametric form ((2t, t)) gives:     [     overrightarrow{OC} = (4, 2)     ]Thus, the coordinates of (overrightarrow{O C}) when the dot product (overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB}) is minimized are (boxed{(4, 2)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about finding the coordinates of point C on the line OP such that the dot product of vectors CA and CB is minimized. Hmm. Let me start by understanding all the given information.First, we have the origin O, and points P, A, and B with their position vectors given. The coordinates are:- Vector OP is (2,1), so point P is at (2,1).- Vector OA is (1,7), so point A is at (1,7).- Vector OB is (5,1), so point B is at (5,1).Point C is somewhere on the line OP. Since OP is a line from the origin to P(2,1), any point C on OP can be represented as a scalar multiple of the vector OP. So, parametrize point C as t*(2,1), where t is a real number. Therefore, the coordinates of C are (2t, t) for some t.Now, we need to find the value of t such that the dot product of vectors CA and CB is minimized. Let me recall that the dot product of two vectors u and v is given by u ⋅ v = u₁v₁ + u₂v₂. Also, the dot product can be related to the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them, but since we need to minimize the dot product here, maybe working directly with coordinates is better.First, let&#39;s find vectors CA and CB. Vector CA is from point C to point A, so it&#39;s OA - OC. Similarly, vector CB is OB - OC. Let me write that out:- Vector CA = OA - OC = (1,7) - (2t, t) = (1 - 2t, 7 - t)- Vector CB = OB - OC = (5,1) - (2t, t) = (5 - 2t, 1 - t)Then, the dot product CA ⋅ CB is:(1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) + (7 - t)(1 - t)Let me compute this expression step by step.First, expand (1 - 2t)(5 - 2t):= 1*5 + 1*(-2t) - 2t*5 - 2t*(-2t)= 5 - 2t - 10t + 4t²= 5 - 12t + 4t²Then, expand (7 - t)(1 - t):= 7*1 + 7*(-t) - t*1 - t*(-t)= 7 - 7t - t + t²= 7 - 8t + t²Now, add these two results together for the total dot product:(5 - 12t + 4t²) + (7 - 8t + t²) = 5 + 7 -12t -8t + 4t² + t²= 12 - 20t + 5t²So, the dot product CA ⋅ CB simplifies to the quadratic function 5t² - 20t + 12.To find its minimum value, since this is a quadratic in t with a positive coefficient on the t² term (5 &gt; 0), the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic at² + bt + c is at t = -b/(2a). So here, a = 5, b = -20. Therefore:t = -(-20)/(2*5) = 20/10 = 2.Wait, so t = 2? Let me verify. If t = 2, then point C would be (2*2, 2) = (4, 2). But wait, point P is (2,1). Wait, the line OP goes from the origin to (2,1). If t is a scalar multiple, normally t would be between 0 and 1 to be on the segment OP, but the problem says C is a point on the line OP, not necessarily the segment. So t can be any real number. Therefore, t = 2 is valid, even though it&#39;s beyond point P.But let me check my calculations again. The vectors CA and CB, when t = 2, would be:CA = (1 - 2*2, 7 - 2) = (-3, 5)CB = (5 - 2*2, 1 - 2) = (1, -1)Then, their dot product is (-3)(1) + (5)(-1) = -3 -5 = -8.Is that the minimum? Let me check t = 1:At t = 1, C is (2,1). Then CA = (1 - 2, 7 -1) = (-1,6)CB = (5 - 2,1 -1) = (3,0)Dot product: (-1)(3) + (6)(0) = -3 + 0 = -3.Wait, that&#39;s higher than -8, so maybe t=2 is indeed lower.Wait, but hold on, when t=2, the point C is (4,2), which is on the line OP extended beyond P. The line OP can be parametrized as t*(2,1) for any real t, so t=2 is allowed.But maybe I made an error in expanding the dot product. Let me check again.Original expression:(1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) + (7 - t)(1 - t)First term: (1)(5) + (1)(-2t) + (-2t)(5) + (-2t)(-2t) = 5 -2t -10t +4t² = 5 -12t +4t²Second term: (7)(1) + (7)(-t) + (-t)(1) + (-t)(-t) =7 -7t -t +t² =7 -8t +t²Adding them together: 5 +7 =12; -12t -8t = -20t; 4t² + t²=5t². So total is 5t² -20t +12. That&#39;s correct.So the quadratic is 5t² -20t +12. Taking derivative with respect to t, if I use calculus, the derivative is 10t -20. Setting to zero: 10t -20 =0 =&gt; t=2. So yes, t=2 is the critical point, and since the quadratic opens upwards, it&#39;s the minimum.Therefore, the coordinates of OC are (2t, t) = (4,2). So OC vector is (4,2). Therefore, the answer should be (4,2), boxed as boxed{(4,2)}.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another way to approach this problem, maybe using projections or geometric interpretations, to confirm.Alternatively, the dot product CA ⋅ CB can be considered. Since C is on line OP, we can express C as a parameter t along OP, as we did. Then, we can express the vectors CA and CB in terms of t, compute the dot product, and find its minimum. Which is exactly what we did, so I think that&#39;s solid.Alternatively, maybe using vector calculus. The function to minimize is quadratic in t, so calculus gives the minimum at t=2. Alternatively, completing the square.Let&#39;s try completing the square for 5t² -20t +12.Factor out 5: 5(t² -4t) +12Complete the square inside the parentheses: t² -4t +4 -4 = (t-2)^2 -4So, 5[(t-2)^2 -4] +12 =5(t-2)^2 -20 +12=5(t-2)^2 -8Thus, the minimum value is -8 when t=2. So that&#39;s another way to see it. The minimum occurs at t=2, so OC is (4,2). So yes, seems correct.But wait, just to make sure, maybe visualize this. If points A(1,7), B(5,1), and line OP is from (0,0) to (2,1). Point C is moving along OP (and beyond). We found that the minimal dot product occurs at C(4,2). Is there a geometric interpretation?The dot product CA ⋅ CB being minimized. The dot product is related to the projection. But since both CA and CB are vectors from C to A and B, minimizing their dot product might correspond to some optimal position. However, since the algebra checks out, and the calculus and completing the square both lead to t=2, I think the answer is correct.Therefore, the coordinates of OC when the dot product is minimized are (4,2).Final AnswerThe coordinates of overrightarrow{O C} are boxed{(4, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the vectors (overrightarrow{O P} = (2, 1)), (overrightarrow{O A} = (1, 7)), and (overrightarrow{O B} = (5, 1)), we need to find the coordinates of point (C) on the line (OP) such that the dot product (overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB}) is minimized.1. Parametrize Point (C):   Since (C) is on the line (OP), it can be represented as (C = (2t, t)) for some scalar (t).2. Express Vectors (overrightarrow{CA}) and (overrightarrow{CB}):   - (overrightarrow{CA} = overrightarrow{A} - overrightarrow{C} = (1 - 2t, 7 - t))   - (overrightarrow{CB} = overrightarrow{B} - overrightarrow{C} = (5 - 2t, 1 - t))3. Compute the Dot Product:   [   overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB} = (1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) + (7 - t)(1 - t)   ]   Expanding and simplifying:   [   (1 - 2t)(5 - 2t) = 5 - 12t + 4t^2   ]   [   (7 - t)(1 - t) = 7 - 8t + t^2   ]   Adding these results:   [   5 - 12t + 4t^2 + 7 - 8t + t^2 = 12 - 20t + 5t^2   ]4. Find the Minimum Value:   The quadratic function (5t^2 - 20t + 12) has its minimum at (t = frac{-b}{2a}) where (a = 5) and (b = -20):   [   t = frac{20}{2 cdot 5} = 2   ]5. Determine Coordinates of (C):   Substituting (t = 2) into the parametrization of (C):   [   overrightarrow{O C} = (2 cdot 2, 2) = (4, 2)   ]Thus, the coordinates of (overrightarrow{O C}) when the dot product (overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB}) is minimized are (boxed{(4, 2)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a2ce2ec></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>🔑:</span>5.

So, we have set A which is all even numbers from 2 up to 2014, right? So A = {2, 4, 6, ..., 2014}. Then B is any non-empty subset of A. The condition is that for any two elements a_i and a_j in B, there is exactly one isosceles triangle with sides a_i and a_j. We need to find the maximum number of elements in set B.First, let me make sure I understand the problem. An isosceles triangle has two sides equal. So, if we have two different side lengths a_i and a_j, then the third side must be either a_i or a_j to make it isosceles. But the problem states that there is exactly one isosceles triangle with a_i and a_j as side lengths. Hmm, so if we take two elements from B, say a_i and a_j, then there should be exactly one third side that can form an isosceles triangle with them. That means either a_i or a_j must be the third side, but not both. So, for any two elements in B, exactly one of the two possibilities (third side being a_i or a_j) must satisfy the triangle inequality.Wait, triangle inequality says that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, if we have sides a_i, a_j, and a_i (since it&#39;s isosceles), then the triangle inequality must hold. Similarly, if we have sides a_i, a_j, a_j, that must also satisfy the triangle inequality. But the problem says there&#39;s exactly one such triangle. So for any two a_i and a_j in B, exactly one of the following is true:1. a_i + a_j &gt; a_i (which simplifies to a_j &gt; 0, which is always true) and a_i + a_i &gt; a_j (so 2a_i &gt; a_j)2. a_i + a_j &gt; a_j (which simplifies to a_i &gt; 0, always true) and a_j + a_j &gt; a_i (so 2a_j &gt; a_i)But since the problem states there is exactly one isosceles triangle, that means exactly one of 2a_i &gt; a_j or 2a_j &gt; a_i must hold. But wait, if both 2a_i &gt; a_j and 2a_j &gt; a_i, then both triangles are possible, which would mean two isosceles triangles, which violates the condition. Similarly, if neither holds, then there&#39;s no isosceles triangle, which also violates the condition. So for any two elements a_i and a_j in B, exactly one of the two inequalities must hold: either 2a_i &gt; a_j or 2a_j &gt; a_i, but not both and not neither.Therefore, the set B must be constructed such that for any two elements, one is more than half the other, but not both. So, if we have two numbers, say x and y, in B, then either x &gt; y/2 or y &gt; x/2, but not both. Wait, actually, if x &gt; y/2 and y &gt; x/2, these two inequalities can coexist. Let&#39;s check with some numbers.Suppose x = 4 and y = 6. Then 2x = 8 &gt; y = 6, so 2x &gt; y. Also, 2y = 12 &gt; x = 4. So both 2x &gt; y and 2y &gt; x hold. In this case, both isosceles triangles (4,4,6) and (4,6,6) would exist. But the problem requires exactly one isosceles triangle. Therefore, such a pair (4,6) cannot both be in B.Therefore, in order to have only one isosceles triangle, for any two elements a_i and a_j in B, exactly one of 2a_i &gt; a_j or 2a_j &gt; a_i must hold. So, for any two elements, one is more than double the other. Wait, no. Wait, if 2a_i &gt; a_j and 2a_j &lt;= a_i, then only the triangle with sides a_i, a_i, a_j exists. Similarly, if 2a_j &gt; a_i and 2a_i &lt;= a_j, then only the triangle with sides a_j, a_j, a_i exists. If both 2a_i &gt; a_j and 2a_j &gt; a_i, then both triangles exist, which is bad. If neither holds, then no triangle exists, which is also bad. So the condition is that for any two elements in B, exactly one of 2a_i &gt; a_j or 2a_j &gt; a_i must hold. So this is equivalent to saying that for any two elements, one is more than half of the other, but not both. That is, for any two elements a and b in B, exactly one of a &gt; b/2 or b &gt; a/2 holds.Alternatively, we can think of this as for any two elements, one is greater than the other divided by 2. So, if we have elements arranged in order, each element must be more than double the previous one. Wait, if we arrange the elements in increasing order, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then to ensure that for any two elements a_i and a_j with i &lt; j, we have a_j &gt; 2a_i (since if a_j &gt; 2a_i, then 2a_j &gt; a_i is automatically true because a_j &gt; 2a_i implies a_j &gt; a_i, so 2a_j &gt; 2a_i &gt; a_i). Wait, no. If a_j &gt; 2a_i, then 2a_i &lt; a_j, so the triangle with sides a_i, a_i, a_j would not satisfy the triangle inequality because a_i + a_i = 2a_i &lt; a_j, which violates the triangle inequality. Wait, hold on, this is conflicting with the previous reasoning.Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let&#39;s clarify. If we have two elements, a and b, with a &lt; b. Then:- For the triangle (a, a, b) to exist, we need a + a &gt; b, i.e., 2a &gt; b.- For the triangle (a, b, b) to exist, we need b + b &gt; a, i.e., 2b &gt; a, which is always true since b &gt; a and a &gt;= 2, so 2b &gt; a is automatically satisfied because b &gt;= a + 2? Wait, not necessarily. If a and b are consecutive even numbers, say a = 2, b = 4, then 2b = 8 &gt; a = 2. So in that case, (a, b, b) is always possible, since 2b &gt; a.Wait, so if a &lt; b, then 2b &gt; a is always true, because 2b is at least 2*(a + 2) if they are consecutive even numbers. Wait, no. If a and b are any two elements with a &lt; b, then b &gt;= a + 2 (since they&#39;re even numbers). So 2b &gt;= 2a + 4. Then a is at least 2, so 2a + 4 &gt;= 4 + 4 = 8, but a could be larger.Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine. Let&#39;s take a = 2 and b = 4. Then 2b = 8, which is greater than a = 2. Similarly, a = 4, b = 6: 2b = 12 &gt; 4. Wait, if a and b are in A, which are even numbers starting from 2, then 2b is going to be much larger than a as long as b is not too close to a. Wait, but if b is just a little bit larger than a, then 2b is still going to be larger than a. Wait, for example, if a = 1000 and b = 1002. Then 2b = 2004, which is definitely larger than a = 1000. So in all cases, 2b &gt; a. Therefore, if a &lt; b, then (a, b, b) is always a valid triangle. But (a, a, b) is only valid if 2a &gt; b.Therefore, the problem states that there must be exactly one isosceles triangle for any two elements a and b. So, if a &lt; b, then (a, b, b) is always a valid triangle. So to have exactly one isosceles triangle, we must ensure that (a, a, b) is not a valid triangle. Therefore, 2a &lt;= b. So for any two elements a &lt; b in B, we must have 2a &lt;= b. Because otherwise, both (a, a, b) and (a, b, b) would be valid, which would violate the condition of having exactly one isosceles triangle.Therefore, the key is that in set B, for any two elements a &lt; b, 2a &lt;= b. This way, when you take any two elements a and b, the triangle (a, b, b) is valid (since 2b &gt; a), but (a, a, b) is invalid (since 2a &lt;= b). Therefore, there is exactly one isosceles triangle.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the largest subset B of A such that for any two elements a &lt; b in B, 2a &lt;= b. Such a set is called a &quot;greedy set&quot; where each element is at least double the previous one. So, starting from the smallest element, each next element must be at least double the previous one. For example, starting with 2, the next element must be at least 4, then next at least 8, then 16, and so on.But since the elements in A are even numbers, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s start from the smallest element, 2. Then the next element must be at least 4 (2*2). Then the next must be at least 8 (4*2). Then 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. Let&#39;s check: 1024*2 = 2048. But the maximum element in A is 2014. So 2048 is larger than 2014, so the next element after 1024 would need to be at least 2048, but that&#39;s not in A. So the sequence would be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. That&#39;s 10 elements. Then, starting from 1024, the next required element is 2048, which is not in A, so we can&#39;t include it. Therefore, this gives a subset B with 10 elements.But wait, maybe there&#39;s a way to get a larger subset by choosing larger starting points. For example, if we start with 4 instead of 2. Let&#39;s see: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. That&#39;s 9 elements. So starting from 2 gives a longer sequence. Similarly, starting from 6: 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768, 1536. Wait, 1536*2 = 3072, which is beyond 2014, so 1536 is the last. That&#39;s 9 elements. Hmm, same as starting from 4.Alternatively, maybe combining sequences? But if we mix elements from different sequences, we might end up with pairs that don&#39;t satisfy the 2a &lt;= b condition. For example, if we have 2 and 4 in the set, and also 6, then 2 and 6: 2*2 = 4 &lt;= 6, which is okay. But 4 and 6: 4*2 = 8 &gt; 6, which would mean that (4,4,6) is a valid triangle. But in our set B, if we have 4 and 6, then since 4 and 6 are both in B, we need that either 2*4 &lt;= 6 or 2*6 &lt;=4. But 8 &lt;=6 is false, and 12 &lt;=4 is false. Therefore, neither holds, which would violate the condition. Therefore, we can&#39;t have both 4 and 6 in B if we already have 2. So mixing sequences is not allowed.Therefore, the maximum subset B is a set where each element is at least double the previous one, starting from the smallest possible element, which is 2. But let&#39;s check if we can include larger elements beyond 1024. Wait, 1024*2 = 2048, which is not in A (since A goes up to 2014). But 2014 is the maximum. So 1024*2 = 2048 &gt; 2014, so we can&#39;t include 2048. But maybe if we take 1024 and then instead of 2048, take 2014. Let&#39;s check if 2014 &gt;= 2*1024. 2*1024 = 2048. 2014 is less than 2048, so 2014 &lt; 2*1024. Therefore, 2014 cannot be included after 1024, because 2*1024 = 2048 &gt; 2014. Therefore, the next element after 1024 would need to be at least 2048, which is not present. So 1024 is the last element in that sequence.Therefore, starting from 2, we have 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. That&#39;s 10 elements. But let&#39;s check the actual elements in A. A is all even numbers up to 2014. So 2, 4, 6, ..., 2014. So the numbers in the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 1024 are all in A. So yes, this is a valid subset. So 10 elements.But is this the maximum possible? Let&#39;s see if we can construct a larger subset by starting somewhere else. For example, starting from a higher number but allowing some smaller numbers that don&#39;t interfere.Wait, but if we start from a higher number, say 4, and take 4, 8, 16, ..., 1024, that&#39;s 9 elements, which is less than 10. Similarly, starting from 6: 6, 12, 24, ..., 1536. 1536 is in A (since 1536 is even and &lt;=2014). Let&#39;s see: 6,12,24,48,96,192,384,768,1536. That&#39;s 9 elements. Then, after 1536, next would be 3072, which is out of range. So 9 elements. Still less than 10.Alternatively, if we start from 2, but sometimes take larger steps. Wait, but taking larger steps would mean fewer elements. For example, 2, 8, 16, 32,... but that skips 4, which would allow more elements? No, because 2,8 would require 8 &gt;= 2*2 = 4, which is true, but if we have both 2 and 8, then 2*2=4 &lt;=8, so that&#39;s okay, but then adding 16 next. But if we do 2, 8, 16, 32, etc., then that&#39;s only 2,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024: 9 elements. Still fewer than 10. So starting from 2 and doubling each time gives the longest sequence.But perhaps there&#39;s another way. For example, creating multiple sequences and combining them as long as they don&#39;t interfere. For instance, if we have two sequences: one starting at 2, and another starting at 3 (but 3 isn&#39;t even), so maybe starting at 4 and another starting at 6. But since all elements have to be even, maybe overlapping sequences?Wait, but if we have two sequences, say 2,4,8,16,... and 6,12,24,48,..., but combining them would create pairs like 4 and 6. As before, 4 and 6 would have 2*4=8 &gt;6, so (4,4,6) is invalid? Wait, no, the triangle (4,4,6) requires 4+4&gt;6, which is 8&gt;6, which is true. Therefore, if we have both 4 and 6 in B, then there are two triangles: (4,4,6) and (4,6,6). But according to the problem, there should be exactly one isosceles triangle. Therefore, having both 4 and 6 in B would violate the condition. Therefore, we can&#39;t combine different sequences.Therefore, the only way is to have a single sequence where each element is at least double the previous one. Thus, starting from the smallest element gives the longest possible sequence. So 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024. Let&#39;s count: 2 (1), 4 (2), 8 (3), 16 (4), 32 (5), 64 (6), 128 (7), 256 (8), 512 (9), 1024 (10). So 10 elements.Wait, but 1024*2 = 2048, which is more than 2014, so we can&#39;t include 2048. So 1024 is the last element. Therefore, 10 elements. Is there a way to include another element beyond 1024? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we include 2014. Let&#39;s check if 2014 can be included in the set. To include 2014, we need that for all elements a in B, 2a &lt;=2014 and 2*2014 &lt;= a (but 2*2014 = 4028, which is way larger than any element in A, so 2*2014 &lt;= a is impossible. So the only condition is that 2a &lt;=2014 for all a in B. But 2014 is the maximum element, so all previous elements must satisfy 2a &lt;=2014. The previous element is 1024. 2*1024=2048 &lt;=2014? No, 2048&gt;2014. Therefore, 1024 cannot be in the same set as 2014, because 2*1024=2048&gt;2014, so if we have both 1024 and 2014 in B, then 2*1024&gt;2014, so (1024,1024,2014) would not be a valid triangle, but (1024,2014,2014) would be valid since 2*2014&gt;1024. Therefore, in this case, only one isosceles triangle exists for the pair 1024 and 2014. Wait, let me check:If we have 1024 and 2014 in B, then:- For triangle (1024,1024,2014): need 2*1024 &gt; 2014. 2048 &gt;2014, which is true. So this triangle is valid.- For triangle (1024,2014,2014): need 2*2014 &gt;1024. 4028 &gt;1024, which is true. So this triangle is also valid.Therefore, both triangles exist, which violates the condition. Therefore, 1024 and 2014 cannot both be in B. Therefore, we cannot include 2014 in the existing sequence. Hence, the maximum sequence ends at 1024 with 10 elements.Alternatively, if we remove 1024 and include 2014, but then starting from 2,4,8,...,512, then 512*2=1024. If instead of 1024, we take 2014. But 2*512=1024 &lt;=2014, so 2014 can be included. Wait, but let&#39;s see:If we have the sequence 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014. Then, check if all pairs satisfy 2a &lt;= b for a &lt; b.Check 2 and 4: 2*2=4=4, which is equal, so 2*2 &lt;=4 is okay. So 4 is allowed.4 and 8: 2*4=8=8, okay.8 and16: 2*8=16=16, okay.Similarly, 16 and32, 32 and64, 64 and128,128 and256,256 and512: all doubling. Then 512 and2014: 2*512=1024 &lt;=2014, which is true. So yes, 2014 can be included after 512.Wait, but in the original sequence, after 512 comes 1024. If we instead take 2014, does that affect the previous elements? Let&#39;s check:For example, take 256 and2014. 2*256=512 &lt;=2014, which is true. Similarly, 128 and2014: 2*128=256 &lt;=2014. So all previous elements when paired with 2014 satisfy 2a &lt;=2014. Therefore, the triangle (a, a, 2014) would not be valid because 2a &lt;=2014. Wait, no. For (a, a, 2014) to be a valid triangle, 2a &gt;2014. But if 2a &lt;=2014, then (a,a,2014) is invalid. But (a,2014,2014) is valid because 2*2014 &gt;a. So for any a in B except 2014, the pair (a,2014) would have exactly one isosceles triangle: (a,2014,2014). Therefore, adding 2014 to the set B would not violate the condition with any previous elements. Therefore, perhaps we can replace 1024 with 2014 to get an extra element.Wait, but if we have 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014. That&#39;s 10 elements. The original sequence had 10 elements as well. So replacing 1024 with 2014 doesn&#39;t increase the count. But could we have both 1024 and 2014?But as previously determined, 1024 and2014 would create two triangles: (1024,1024,2014) and (1024,2014,2014), which is invalid. So we can&#39;t have both. Therefore, either 1024 or 2014, but not both. Therefore, the maximum remains 10 elements.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another way to arrange elements where you can have more than 10 elements. Let&#39;s think differently. Instead of starting at 2, what if we create multiple chains where elements in different chains don&#39;t interfere.But since all elements are even numbers, if we have two chains, say starting at 2 and starting at 6. Then, 2 and 6: 2*2=4 &lt;=6, so (2,2,6) is invalid, but (2,6,6) is valid. However, 6 and 2: since 2 &lt;6, the same applies. So for 2 and6, there is exactly one isosceles triangle: (2,6,6). So if we have both 2 and6 in B, that&#39;s okay. Wait, but according to our previous logic, if we have 2 and6 in B, then as long as 2*2 &lt;=6 and 2*6 &gt;2, which they are. But according to the problem&#39;s condition, this is allowed, because there is exactly one isosceles triangle for the pair (2,6). The triangle would be (2,6,6), since (2,2,6) is invalid (4 &lt;=6). Wait, no, 2a_i &gt;a_j: 2*2=4 &gt;6? No, 4 is not greater than 6. Therefore, 2a_i &lt;=a_j. So (2,2,6) is invalid. Then, (2,6,6) is valid because 2*6=12 &gt;2, which is always true. So exactly one isosceles triangle. Therefore, having both 2 and6 is okay.Wait a second, this contradicts our earlier conclusion. Earlier, we thought that if you have two elements a and b with a &lt; b, then (a, b, b) is always valid, and (a, a, b) is valid only if 2a &gt; b. Therefore, if 2a &lt;= b, then only one triangle exists. So if we have 2 and6, then (2,6,6) is valid, and (2,2,6) is invalid, so exactly one triangle. Therefore, 2 and6 can coexist in B.But then, our previous reasoning about sequences where each element is double the previous one might not be the only way. Maybe we can have multiple elements that don&#39;t interfere with each other. Wait, but how?Wait, let&#39;s clarify. If two elements a and b are such that neither is more than double the other, then both (a, a, b) and (a, b, b) would be valid. For example, take a=6 and b=10. Then 2a=12 &gt;10, so (6,6,10) is valid, and 2b=20 &gt;6, so (6,10,10) is also valid. Therefore, having both 6 and10 in B would result in two isosceles triangles, which is not allowed. Therefore, such pairs cannot coexist.But if two elements a and b are such that one is more than double the other, then only one triangle exists. For example, a=2 and b=6: 2*2=4 &lt;=6, so only (2,6,6) is valid. Similarly, a=6 and b=14: 2*6=12 &lt;=14, so only (6,14,14) is valid. On the other hand, if a=14 and b=6, since a &gt; b, but 2*14=28 &gt;6, so (14,14,6) is valid. Wait, but in this case, since a=14 and b=6, we have to consider a &gt; b. Wait, the initial pair is unordered, so regardless of order, the two possible triangles are (a, a, b) and (b, b, a). Therefore, if a and b are such that 2a &gt; b and 2b &gt; a, then both triangles are valid. If only one of 2a &gt; b or 2b &gt; a holds, then only one triangle is valid. If neither holds, then no triangle is valid. But according to the problem statement, there must be exactly one isosceles triangle. Therefore, for any two elements a and b, exactly one of the following must hold: 2a &gt; b or 2b &gt; a, but not both and not neither.Therefore, the condition is that for any two elements a and b in B, exactly one of 2a &gt; b or 2b &gt; a must hold. Therefore, for any two elements, one must be more than half of the other, but not both. So, this is equivalent to saying that B is a set where all elements are such that for any two, one is greater than twice the other. Wait, no. Wait, if a and b satisfy that either a &gt; 2b or b &gt; 2a, then exactly one of 2a &gt; b or 2b &gt; a holds. Let&#39;s check:If a &gt; 2b, then 2b &lt; a, so 2b &lt;= a. Therefore, (b, b, a) would require 2b &gt; a, which is false, so invalid. (a, a, b) would require 2a &gt; b, which is true since a &gt; 2b implies 2a &gt; 2*2b = 4b &gt; b. So only (a, a, b) is valid. Similarly, if b &gt; 2a, then only (b, b, a) is valid. If neither a &gt; 2b nor b &gt; 2a, then both 2a &gt; b and 2b &gt; a may hold, leading to two triangles, which is invalid.Therefore, the set B must be such that for any two elements a and b, either a &gt; 2b or b &gt; 2a. Therefore, such a set is called a &quot;Sidon sequence&quot; with ratio 2, or a set where all elements are pairwise such that one is more than double the other.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the largest possible subset B of A where every pair of elements satisfies that one is more than double the other. Such sets are known in combinatorics, and the maximal size is achieved by the greedy sequence where each element is the smallest possible even number greater than twice the previous one. Starting from 2, the sequence would be 2, 5 (but 5 is not even), so next even number after 2*2=4 is 4, then 8, 16, etc. Wait, but since we need all elements to be even, starting at 2:2, 4 (2*2), 8 (4*2), 16 (8*2), 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048. But 2048 is beyond 2014, so the last element is 1024. So the sequence is 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024: 10 elements.Alternatively, if we can find another sequence with more elements by starting later, but including more elements. Wait, but starting later would require larger steps. For example, starting at 4: 4,8,16,...1024. That&#39;s 9 elements. Starting at 6: 6,12,24,...1536. 1536 is within 2014. So 6,12,24,48,96,192,384,768,1536. That&#39;s 9 elements. So same as before.Alternatively, perhaps interleaving sequences. For example, taking one element from the 2-sequence and one from the 6-sequence. Let&#39;s try:Take 2, then from the 6-sequence: 6. Now, 2 and6: 2*2=4 &lt;=6, and 6*2=12 &gt;2. So exactly one triangle (2,6,6). Then, next element after 6 would need to be &gt;12. Let&#39;s take 14 (next even after 12). Check with 2: 2*2=4 &lt;=14, and 14*2=28 &gt;2. Check with6: 6*2=12 &lt;=14? No, 12 &lt;14, so 6*2=12 &lt;14. Therefore, 14 &gt;2*6=12? 14&gt;12, yes. So 14&gt;2*6=12. Therefore, for the pair 6 and14: 2*6=12 &lt;14, so only (14,14,6) is valid. Therefore, exactly one triangle. So 2,6,14. Next element must be &gt;28. Let&#39;s take 30. Check with2: 30&gt;4, so okay. Check with6:30&gt;12, okay. Check with14:30&gt;28, yes. So 30 is okay. Then next element &gt;60:62. Check with all previous: 62&gt;4, 62&gt;12, 62&gt;28, 62&gt;60. So okay. Then next element &gt;124:126. Continue this way, but let&#39;s see how many elements we can get:2,6,14,30,62,126,254,510,1022,2046. But 2046 is beyond 2014. So 2,6,14,30,62,126,254,510,1022. Let&#39;s count: 1.2, 2.6, 3.14, 4.30, 5.62,6.126,7.254,8.510,9.1022. So 9 elements. Less than the original 10 elements.Alternatively, if we start with a higher initial element but take smaller multiplicative factors. Wait, but the multiplicative factor must be more than 2. If we take a factor less than 2, say 1.5, but since we are dealing with even numbers, 1.5*2=3, which is not even. So we can&#39;t do that. Therefore, the minimal factor is 2.Therefore, starting with the smallest element and doubling each time gives the maximum number of elements. Therefore, 10 elements as previously found.But let&#39;s verify this. Let me list out the elements:Start with 2.Next: 2*2=4.Next:4*2=8.Next:8*2=16.16*2=32.32*2=64.64*2=128.128*2=256.256*2=512.512*2=1024.1024*2=2048&gt;2014, stop.So elements are: 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024. That&#39;s 10 elements.Alternatively, if we can choose non-consecutive elements that still satisfy the condition. For example, after 2, maybe skip 4 and pick 6. But 2 and6: 2*2=4 &lt;=6, so okay. Then next element must be &gt;12. Let&#39;s say14. Then 14 and2: okay. 14 and6: 14&gt;12=6*2, so okay. Next element &gt;28:30. 30 and2: okay. 30 and6:30&gt;12, okay. 30 and14:30&gt;28, okay. Next element &gt;60:62. Then62&gt;4,62&gt;12,62&gt;28,62&gt;60. Okay. Next element &gt;124:126. Then126&gt;4,126&gt;12,126&gt;28,126&gt;60,126&gt;124. Okay. Then next &gt;252:254. Then254&gt;4,254&gt;12,254&gt;28,254&gt;60,254&gt;124,254&gt;252. Okay. Then next &gt;508:510. Then510&gt;4,...,510&gt;508. Next &gt;1020:1022. Then1022&gt;4,...,1022&gt;1020. Next would be2044, which is beyond2014. So the sequence would be2,6,14,30,62,126,254,510,1022. 9 elements. Less than 10.Alternatively, if after 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024, perhaps we can include another element between 512 and1024 that doesn&#39;t break the conditions. For example, after512, instead of1024, include768. But 512 and768: check if2*512=1024&gt;768? Yes, so (512,512,768) is valid. Also, (512,768,768) is valid since2*768=1536&gt;512. Therefore, two triangles, which is invalid. Therefore, cannot include768.Alternatively, include a number greater than2*512=1024, which would be1026. But1026 is in A. So include1026. But then512 and1026:2*512=1024 &lt;1026, so only (512,1026,1026) is valid. Then, check with previous elements. For example,256 and1026:2*256=512 &lt;1026, so okay. Similarly, all previous elements when paired with1026 would have only one triangle. But what about1026 and other elements beyond? Wait, if we have1026, the next element would need to be greater than2*1026=2052, which is beyond2014. So we can have1026, but then we can&#39;t add anything after. However, including1026 instead of1024 would allow us to have another element? Let&#39;s see:Sequence:2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1026. That&#39;s still 10 elements. But maybe if we include both1024 and1026. But1024 and1026:2*1024=2048 &gt;1026, so (1024,1024,1026) is valid. Also,2*1026=2052 &gt;1024, so (1026,1026,1024) is valid. Therefore, two triangles, which is invalid. So can&#39;t include both.Therefore, replacing1024 with1026 doesn&#39;t help. Similarly for any number between1024 and2014, say2014. If we replace1024 with2014, then the sequence would be2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014. Check if this works.Check each pair:2 and4: ok.4 and8: ok....512 and2014: 2*512=1024 &lt;2014, so only (512,2014,2014) is valid. Good.But also, previous elements paired with2014:For example,2 and2014: only (2,2014,2014) is valid. 4 and2014: same. All previous elements when paired with2014 will have only one triangle. Therefore, the sequence2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014 is valid. Also, 10 elements. Same as before.But is2014 allowed? Yes, since2014 is in A. So in this case, we have a sequence of 10 elements ending at2014. But does this sequence satisfy the doubling condition? For example,2014 is greater than2*512=1024. Yes. But2014 is not double of512. It&#39;s 2014 = 512*3.93. So the ratio between512 and2014 is more than3. So, this is allowed, because the condition is that each element is more than double the previous one. So512*2=1024, and2014&gt;1024, so it&#39;s allowed. Therefore, this is a valid sequence.Therefore, both sequences:2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024and2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014are valid and have 10 elements. So the maximum number of elements is at least10.Is it possible to have11 elements? Let&#39;s check. Suppose we try to construct a sequence with11 elements. Starting from2:2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048. But2048&gt;2014, so not allowed. If instead of2048, take2014:2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2014. Wait, but in this sequence, the element after1024 should be&gt;2*1024=2048, but2014&lt;2048. Therefore,2014 cannot follow1024. So inserting2014 after512:2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014. That&#39;s10 elements. If we try to add another element before2014, say between512 and2014, like1024. But then1024 and512:2*512=1024=1024, so equal. Therefore, (512,512,1024) requires2*512=1024=1024, so 1024 is not greater. Wait, for the triangle (512,512,1024) to be valid, the sum of the two equal sides must be greater than the third side. Wait, in triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So for (512,512,1024), 512 +512=1024, which is equal to the third side. Therefore, this is a degenerate triangle, which is not valid. Therefore, (512,512,1024) is invalid. Therefore, (512,1024,1024) would require 1024 +1024 &gt;512, which is true. So only (512,1024,1024) is valid. Therefore, if we have512 and1024, then there&#39;s exactly one triangle. But if we also have2014 in the set, then1024 and2014 would pair to create two triangles. Therefore, cannot have both1024 and2014.Alternatively, skip1024 and go from512 to2014. Then, the sequence is10 elements. So to have11 elements, we need another element after2014, which is not possible. Alternatively, insert an element between existing ones.For example, after256, insert another element. Let&#39;s see:2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256, X,512,1024. What can X be? X must be &gt;2*256=512. But512 is already next. So X must be&gt;512, but then512 needs to be&gt;2*X. Wait, no. Wait, in the sequence, each next element must be&gt;2*previous. So after256, next is512. If we want to insert another element between256 and512, say384, then check:256 and384:2*256=512&gt;384, so (256,256,384) is invalid, and (256,384,384) is valid. Then384 and512:2*384=768&gt;512, so (384,384,512) is invalid, and (384,512,512) is valid. So inserting384 between256 and512 would give the sequence2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,384,512,1024. Now, check all pairs:For example,256 and384: only (256,384,384) is valid.384 and512: only (384,512,512) is valid.But what about384 and previous elements like128? 128 and384:2*128=256&lt;384, so only (128,384,384) is valid. Okay. Similarly,384 and64: same. So seems okay.But wait, inserting384 increases the total count to11. But does this work? Let&#39;s verify all pairs.Take2 and384: only (2,384,384) is valid.4 and384: same.8 and384: same....256 and384: same.384 and512: same.512 and1024: same.Wait, but what about384 and say,16? 16 and384: only (16,384,384) is valid. Correct. Similarly, all elements before384 when paired with384 have only one triangle. And elements after384 (512 and1024) also have only one triangle when paired with384. So, inserting384 seems okay. Then, this sequence would have11 elements. But wait, did I make a mistake here?Wait, the problem states that for any two elements a_i and a_j in B, there is exactly one isosceles triangle. In the sequence with384 inserted, let&#39;s check a pair like256 and512. 256 and512: 2*256=512=512. So (256,256,512) would require 2*256=512=512, which is a degenerate triangle, invalid. And (256,512,512) requires512 +512 &gt;256, which is true. So only one valid triangle. Therefore, okay.Similarly,384 and512: as above, only one triangle.But what about384 and256? 2*256=512 &gt;384, so (256,256,384) is invalid. (256,384,384) is valid. So one triangle. Okay.Similarly,384 and128: 2*128=256 &lt;384, so only (128,384,384) is valid. Okay.Therefore, inserting384 seems to work. Then, this sequence would have11 elements:2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,384,512,1024. Wait, but does this work?Wait, let&#39;s check another pair:384 and64. 2*64=128 &lt;384, so only (64,384,384) is valid. Okay.And384 and32: same.But wait, what about384 and8? 8 and384: only (8,384,384) is valid. Okay.But here&#39;s the problem: when we insert384, does it interfere with any other pairs? Let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a pair where both elements are greater than384. For example,512 and1024: already checked, okay.But what about384 and512: checked, okay.What about384 and1024: 2*384=768 &lt;1024, so only (384,1024,1024) is valid. Okay.Thus, inserting384 allows us to have11 elements. Then, why did we not consider this earlier?Wait, because previously we thought each element must be double the previous one. But actually, the condition is that for any two elements a &lt; b, 2a &lt;=b. So, if we have a sequence where each element is more than double the previous one, then the condition holds. However, if we have elements that are not double but still satisfy2a &lt;=b for all a &lt;b, then the sequence can be longer.Wait, but in the example above, inserting384 between256 and512:256*2=512. But384 is less than512. So2*256=512. If we have384 in the set, then256 and384 must satisfy2*256 &lt;=384. But2*256=512 &gt;384, which is false. Therefore, the condition is not satisfied. Wait, this is a contradiction.Hold on, the condition is that for any two elements a &lt; b, 2a &lt;=b. If we have256 and384, then2*256=512 &gt;384, which violates the condition. Therefore, such a pair cannot coexist in B. Therefore, inserting384 into the sequence actually breaks the condition, because256 and384 would allow two triangles: (256,384,384) and (384,384,256). Wait, no. Wait, according to the problem, there must be exactly one isosceles triangle. For a_i=256 and a_j=384:- Triangle (256,256,384): requires2*256 &gt;384? 512&gt;384, which is true. So this triangle is valid.- Triangle (256,384,384): requires2*384 &gt;256? 768&gt;256, which is true. So this triangle is also valid.Therefore, having both256 and384 in B results in two isosceles triangles, which is not allowed. Therefore, inserting384 is invalid.Ah, there&#39;s the mistake. Earlier, I thought that if2a &lt;=b, then only one triangle exists, but in reality, when a &lt;b, (a, a, b) requires2a &gt;b, and (a, b, b) requires2b &gt;a. But if2a &gt;b, then both (a,a,b) and (a,b,b) are valid. Wait, no:Wait, triangle (a,a,b) requiresa +a &gt;b =&gt;2a &gt;b.Triangle (a,b,b) requiresb +b &gt;a =&gt;2b &gt;a.So if2a &gt;b, then both triangles are valid if2b &gt;a. But since a &lt;b, 2b &gt;a is automatically true (since b &gt;=a +2, so2b &gt;=2a +4 &gt;a). Therefore, if2a &gt;b, then both (a,a,b) and (a,b,b) are valid. If2a &lt;=b, then only (a,b,b) is valid.Therefore, the correct condition is that for any two elements a &lt;b in B, we must have2a &lt;=b. This way, only (a,b,b) is valid. If2a &gt;b, then both triangles are valid, which is not allowed.Therefore, the set B must be such that for any two elements a &lt;b,2a &lt;=b. Therefore, such a set is called a &quot;chain&quot; where each element is at least double the previous one. Therefore, inserting384 between256 and512 is invalid because2*256=512 is not &lt;=384. In fact, it&#39;s the opposite:512 &gt;384, which violates the condition. Therefore, the set B must be such that each element is at least double the previous one.Therefore, the maximum size of B is indeed the longest such chain in A. Therefore, starting from2 and doubling each time gives2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024. 10 elements. If we start from a larger number, we get fewer elements. Therefore, the maximum number of elements is10.But wait, let&#39;s check again with the correct condition. If B is a subset where for all a &lt;b in B,2a &lt;=b, then the maximum size is indeed the length of the longest such chain. This is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in a multiplicative sequence with ratio2 within the set A. Given that A contains all even numbers up to2014, the longest such chain is indeed the one starting at2 and doubling each time, resulting in10 elements.Therefore, the answer should be10. However, let&#39;s verify once more by counting:2 (1)4 (2)8 (3)16 (4)32 (5)64 (6)128 (7)256 (8)512 (9)1024 (10)Yes, 10 elements. Each subsequent element is double the previous one, ensuring that for any two elements a &lt;b,2a &lt;=b. Therefore, for any two elements, only the triangle with the larger side duplicated is valid, satisfying the problem&#39;s condition.Hence, the maximum number of elements in set B is10.Final AnswerThe maximum number of elements in set ( B ) is (boxed{10}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( A = {2, 4, 6, ldots, 2014} ), we need to find the maximum number of elements in a subset ( B ) such that for any two elements ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) in ( B ), there is exactly one isosceles triangle with ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) as side lengths.To solve this, we need to ensure that for any two elements ( a ) and ( b ) in ( B ) (where ( a &lt; b )), the triangle inequality holds for exactly one isosceles triangle. This means that either ( 2a leq b ) (so only the triangle ( (a, b, b) ) is valid) or ( 2b leq a ) (so only the triangle ( (a, a, b) ) is valid). However, since ( a &lt; b ), the latter case is impossible, so we must ensure ( 2a leq b ).This condition implies that each element in ( B ) must be at least double the previous element. Starting from the smallest element in ( A ), we construct the subset ( B ) as follows:1. Start with 2.2. Each subsequent element must be at least double the previous one.Following this construction, the elements of ( B ) are:[ 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 ]This sequence contains 10 elements, each of which is double the previous one. Any further elements would exceed 2014, making it impossible to satisfy the condition.Thus, the maximum number of elements in set ( B ) is (boxed{10}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it&#39;s asking. We have set A which is all even numbers from 2 up to 2014, right? So A = {2, 4, ..., 2014}. Then B is any non-empty subset of A. The condition is that if we take any two elements from B, say a_i and a_j, there must be exactly one isosceles triangle that can be formed with those two as side lengths. The question is asking for the maximum number of elements that set B can have. Hmm, okay. So the key here is that for any pair of elements in B, there&#39;s exactly one isosceles triangle possible. Let me recall that for a triangle to be isosceles, two sides must be equal. But in this case, we have two sides a_i and a_j. So, maybe the triangle could be either (a_i, a_i, a_j) or (a_j, a_j, a_i). But the problem states that there is exactly one isosceles triangle with a_i and a_j as side lengths. That would mean that only one of these two possibilities is valid? Because if both are valid, then there would be two isosceles triangles. So we need to ensure that for any pair (a_i, a_j), only one of (a_i, a_i, a_j) or (a_j, a_j, a_i) is a valid triangle. But wait, triangles also have to satisfy the triangle inequality. For the triangle (a_i, a_i, a_j), the sum of the two equal sides must be greater than the third side. So 2a_i &gt; a_j. Similarly, for (a_j, a_j, a_i), we need 2a_j &gt; a_i. So if both 2a_i &gt; a_j and 2a_j &gt; a_i, then both triangles would be possible, which would violate the condition. Therefore, to have exactly one isosceles triangle for each pair, we must have that for any two elements a_i and a_j in B, exactly one of the following holds: either 2a_i &gt; a_j or 2a_j &gt; a_i, but not both. Wait, but let me check. If 2a_i &gt; a_j and 2a_j &gt; a_i, then both triangles are possible. So the problem wants exactly one triangle. So we need that for any pair a_i and a_j in B, exactly one of those inequalities holds. That is, either 2a_i &gt; a_j and 2a_j ≤ a_i, or vice versa. So, to rephrase, for any two elements in B, one must be more than twice the other. Because if, say, a_i &gt; a_j, then if a_i &gt;= 2a_j, then 2a_j &lt;= a_i, so 2a_j &gt; a_i would be false, and only 2a_i &gt; a_j would hold (since a_i is at least twice a_j, so 2a_i is at least 4a_j, which is definitely greater than a_j). Wait, but hold on. If a_i &gt;= 2a_j, then 2a_j &lt;= a_i, so (a_i, a_i, a_j) would require 2a_i &gt; a_j, which is true because 2a_i is at least 4a_j &gt; a_j. But (a_j, a_j, a_i) would require 2a_j &gt; a_i, which would be false because a_i &gt;= 2a_j. So in that case, only the triangle (a_i, a_i, a_j) is possible. Similarly, if a_j &gt;= 2a_i, then only (a_j, a_j, a_i) is possible. But if neither a_i &gt;= 2a_j nor a_j &gt;= 2a_i, then both 2a_i &gt; a_j and 2a_j &gt; a_i would hold, meaning both triangles are possible. Therefore, to have exactly one triangle, we need that for any two elements in B, one is at least twice the other. That way, only the larger one can form an isosceles triangle with the smaller one. So this reduces the problem to finding the largest possible subset B of A such that any two elements in B are such that one is at least twice the other. Because if that&#39;s the case, then for any pair, the larger one can form an isosceles triangle with the smaller one, but not the other way around. Therefore, each pair would have exactly one isosceles triangle. So now, the problem is transformed into: find the maximum size of a subset B of A = {2, 4, ..., 2014} where every pair of elements in B satisfies that one is at least twice the other. This is similar to a problem where you want to construct a set where each element is at least double the previous one. Such a set is called a &quot;greedy&quot; set, where each element is as small as possible but still maintaining the ratio. So for example, starting with 2, the next element should be at least 4, but since 4 is in A, but 4 is exactly twice 2. Wait, but 4 is in A. But if we include 4, then 4 is exactly twice 2, so 2 and 4 would satisfy 4 &gt;= 2*2? Wait, 4 is equal to 2*2, which is not greater. Wait, hold on. The triangle inequality for (4,4,2) would require that 2*4 &gt; 2, which is true. So the triangle (4,4,2) is valid. But if we have both 2 and 4 in B, then we have two elements where neither is more than twice the other. Wait, 4 is exactly twice 2. So in this case, 4 is not more than twice 2, but exactly twice. So 2*2 = 4, so 2*2 = 4, so 2*2 is equal to 4. Therefore, 2*2 &gt; 4 is false, right? Wait, no, 2*2 = 4, so 2*2 &gt; 4 is false, so the triangle (2,2,4) would not be valid because 2 + 2 is not greater than 4. Wait, wait, triangle inequality is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Wait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let&#39;s clarify. For the triangle (a_i, a_i, a_j), the triangle inequality requires that a_i + a_i &gt; a_j. So 2a_i &gt; a_j. Similarly, for (a_j, a_j, a_i), it requires 2a_j &gt; a_i. So if a_i = 2 and a_j = 4, then 2a_i = 4, which is equal to a_j, so 2a_i &gt; a_j is false. Therefore, the triangle (2,2,4) is invalid because 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater. However, the triangle (4,4,2) would require 2*4 &gt; 2, which is 8 &gt; 2, which is true, so that&#39;s valid. Therefore, if we have 2 and 4 in B, then for the pair (2,4), only the triangle (4,4,2) is valid. So even though 4 is exactly twice 2, as long as the larger one is more than half the smaller one? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this case, 4 is exactly twice 2, so 2a_i = 4 where a_i = 2, and a_j = 4. So 2a_i is not greater than a_j, so (2,2,4) is invalid, but 2a_j = 8, which is greater than a_i = 2, so (4,4,2) is valid. Therefore, even if the larger element is exactly twice the smaller, only one triangle is possible. Therefore, in this case, even if two elements are in a ratio of exactly 2:1, they are still acceptable because only the larger one can form a valid triangle with the smaller one. So actually, the condition is that one element is at least twice the other. So if a_j is exactly twice a_i, then it&#39;s allowed because 2a_i = a_j, so (a_i, a_i, a_j) is invalid, but (a_j, a_j, a_i) is valid. Therefore, the condition is that for any two elements, one is at least twice the other. So the ratio is &gt;= 2. Therefore, to construct the set B, we need to select elements from A such that every pair of elements satisfies that one is at least twice the other. This is similar to constructing a set where each element is at least twice the previous one. But since the elements can be in any order, we need to arrange them in such a way that the entire set is ordered, and each subsequent element is at least twice the previous one. Therefore, the maximum size of such a subset B would be achieved by selecting elements in a geometric progression with ratio 2. Starting from the smallest element, then 2x, 4x, 8x, etc. But since the elements must be even numbers, starting from 2, the next would be 4, then 8, 16, 32, ..., up to the largest element less than or equal to 2014. Wait, but if we start from 2, the next is 4, then 8, 16, etc., each time doubling. So let&#39;s compute how many terms we can get in such a sequence. Let me calculate: starting with 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. Then the next would be 2048, but that&#39;s beyond 2014. So the last term is 1024. How many terms is that? Let&#39;s see: 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, ..., 2^10 = 1024. So that&#39;s 10 terms. So if we take B as {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024}, that&#39;s 10 elements. But wait, the problem says A is {2,4,...,2014}. So 2014 is the last term. Wait, 2014 is not a power of 2. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 2014 is 1024, as 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048 which is larger than 2014. But maybe we can do better by not starting at the smallest element. For example, if we start at a larger element, maybe we can include more elements. Wait, but how? Because if you start higher, the next element has to be at least twice as big, so the sequence would terminate sooner. For example, starting at 4: 4, 8, 16, ..., 1024. That&#39;s 9 elements. So starting at a higher number gives fewer elements. Therefore, starting at the smallest possible element (2) gives the longest possible sequence. So that would be 10 elements. But wait, but perhaps there&#39;s a different way to arrange the elements so that they aren&#39;t in a single geometric progression but still satisfy the condition that any two elements have one at least twice the other. For example, maybe by having multiple chains or something. But in such a case, if you have elements from different chains, you might end up with elements that are not related by a factor of 2, leading to a violation of the condition. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum size is indeed 10. But let&#39;s check 2014. Since 2014 is the maximum element in A, but 1024 is the largest power of 2 less than 2014. So 1024 is in A, but 2048 is not. So if we take the geometric progression starting at 2, we get up to 1024. But wait, another thought: perhaps instead of taking all powers of 2, we can take some other numbers that still satisfy the condition. For example, after 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, but maybe instead of 512 and 1024, we can take higher numbers that are not powers of 2 but still satisfy the ratio condition with other elements. Let me think. Suppose we have 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. That&#39;s 10 elements. But if we take 1024 out and put 2014 in, does that work? Let&#39;s see. 2014 is greater than 1024, but 2014 is less than 2*1024=2048. So 2*1024=2048 &gt;2014, so (1024,1024,2014) is a valid triangle. However, 2014 is in A, so if we replace 1024 with 2014, then we need to check if 2014 is at least twice the previous element, which is 512. 2*512=1024, which is less than 2014. So 2014 is more than twice 512, so that&#39;s okay. But then, when considering pairs between 2014 and other elements, like 2. 2014 is more than twice 2, so that&#39;s okay. 2014 is more than twice 4, 8, ..., 512. So if we replace 1024 with 2014, we can still have all previous elements, but now the last element is 2014. Then, how does that affect the count? Wait, but 1024 is 2^10, 2014 is not a power of 2. But since 2014 is in A, can we include it? Let&#39;s check. If we have the sequence 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014. Let&#39;s check if all pairs satisfy the condition. Take 512 and 2014: 2014 is more than twice 512 (2*512=1024 &lt; 2014), so that&#39;s good. 256 and 2014: 2*256=512 &lt;2014, so okay. Similarly for all previous elements. So in this case, replacing 1024 with 2014 gives us a set of 10 elements as well. But 2014 is larger, so maybe we can add more elements? Wait, but 2014 is not a power of 2. Let me check. Suppose we have 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2014. That&#39;s 11 elements. But does this satisfy the condition? Let&#39;s check between 1024 and 2014. 2*1024=2048 &gt;2014, so the triangle (1024,1024,2014) is valid. However, (2014,2014,1024) would require 2*2014 &gt;1024, which is true, so actually, both triangles would be valid. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, if we have both 1024 and 2014 in B, then for the pair (1024,2014), both (1024,1024,2014) and (2014,2014,1024) would be valid triangles. Because 2*1024 = 2048 &gt;2014 (wait, 2*1024 is 2048, which is greater than 2014, so (1024,1024,2014) is valid. Similarly, 2*2014 = 4028 &gt;1024, so (2014,2014,1024) is also valid. Therefore, both triangles are valid, which violates the problem&#39;s condition of having exactly one isosceles triangle. Therefore, we cannot have both 1024 and 2014 in B. Therefore, replacing 1024 with 2014 would introduce a problem with the previous element 512. Wait, 2014 is more than twice 512, so 512 and 2014 are okay. But 1024 and 2014, if both are in B, then they would create two triangles. Therefore, if we want to include 2014, we need to exclude 1024. So the set would be 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014. But then, 512 and 2014: 2*512=1024 &lt;2014, so (512,512,2014) is invalid because 2*512=1024 is not greater than 2014. Wait, no, wait. The triangle inequality is that the sum of the two equal sides must be greater than the third side. So for (512,512,2014), the sum is 512 + 512 = 1024, which must be greater than 2014. But 1024 is not greater than 2014. Therefore, (512,512,2014) is invalid. Therefore, only (2014,2014,512) is valid, which requires 2*2014 &gt;512, which is true. Therefore, only one triangle is possible. Wait, so if we have 512 and 2014, then only (2014,2014,512) is valid. So maybe my previous thought was wrong. Let me check again. If we have 512 and 2014 in B, then the possible isosceles triangles are (512,512,2014) and (2014,2014,512). For (512,512,2014): 512 + 512 = 1024. 1024 must be greater than 2014? No, 1024 &lt;2014. Therefore, this triangle is invalid. For (2014,2014,512): 2014 + 2014 = 4028, which is greater than 512, so the triangle is valid. Therefore, only one triangle is possible. Therefore, 512 and 2014 can coexist in B. However, if we include both 512 and 1024, and 2014, then 1024 and 2014 would cause a problem. But if we exclude 1024 and include 2014, then 512 and 2014 are okay. So maybe replacing 1024 with 2014 is possible. But wait, the set {2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,2014} would have 10 elements. But the original geometric progression up to 1024 also has 10 elements. So replacing 1024 with 2014 doesn&#39;t increase the size. But maybe we can include some elements between 1024 and 2014 without conflicting? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we have 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024, and then 2014. But as we saw earlier, 1024 and 2014 would create two triangles. Therefore, we can&#39;t have both. So to include 2014, we must exclude 1024. So the set would still be size 10. Alternatively, maybe instead of starting at 2, we can start at a higher number and include more elements. Wait, if we start at 4, then we can go up to 2014 as well. Let&#39;s see:Starting at 4: 4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024. That&#39;s 9 elements. Then 2048 is too big, so 9 elements. If we replace 1024 with 2014, same as before. But 4 to 2014 would be 9 elements, which is less than starting from 2. Alternatively, maybe split the set into two parts: one starting from 2 and another starting from 3 or something. But since all elements in A are even numbers, so starting from 2, all are even. So splitting might not help. Alternatively, maybe interleave elements from different geometric sequences. For example, take 2,4,8,16,... and another sequence starting at 6,12,24,... but we need to ensure that any two elements from different sequences also satisfy the ratio condition. Wait, let&#39;s think about this. Suppose we take two geometric sequences: one starting at 2 with ratio 4, and another starting at 6 with ratio 4. So 2,8,32,128,512,2048 (but 2048 is too big). Then 6,24,96,384,1536. But 1536 is less than 2014. So let&#39;s see how many elements we can get. First sequence: 2,8,32,128,512 (each multiplied by 4). Second sequence: 6,24,96,384,1536. So that&#39;s 5 elements each, total of 10. But then we have to check if any pair between the two sequences satisfies the ratio condition. For example, 2 and 6: 6 is 3 times 2, which is less than 2*2=4. So 6 is not at least twice 2. 6/2=3, which is more than 2, so 6 is more than twice 2. Wait, 6 is 3 times 2. So 6 &gt;= 2*2, which is 4. So yes, 6 is more than twice 2. Therefore, 6 and 2 can coexist. Then, 8 and 6: 8 is 1.333 times 6. So 8 is not twice 6. 6*2=12, which is greater than 8, so 8 is not twice 6. Therefore, 8 and 6: 8/6=1.333, which is less than 2. Therefore, they don&#39;t satisfy the ratio condition. Therefore, 8 and 6 can&#39;t both be in B. Because if they are, then neither is twice the other, so both triangles would be possible. Therefore, this approach of interleaving sequences doesn&#39;t work because elements from different sequences might not satisfy the ratio condition. So that seems problematic. Alternatively, maybe use a different ratio. For example, instead of ratio 2, use ratio 3. Let me see. Starting with 2, next would be 6, then 18, 54, 162, 486, 1458. 1458 is less than 2014, next would be 4374 which is too big. So that&#39;s 7 elements. But if we use ratio 3, but then check pairs between these elements. But 2 and 6: 6 is 3x2, which is okay. 6 and 18: 3x6. But 2 and 18: 18 is 9x2, so more than twice, okay. So in this case, a ratio 3 sequence would have elements where each is thrice the previous. So pairs would have ratios 3,9,27, etc. But even with this, the number of elements is less than the ratio 2 sequence. So this is worse. Therefore, the maximum number of elements seems to be achieved by the greedy approach of taking the smallest possible elements, each twice the previous one. But wait, let&#39;s verify again. If we take the sequence starting at 2: 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024. That&#39;s 10 elements. If we try to add another element, say 2014, as before, but then we have to check all pairs with existing elements. 2014 is more than twice all elements up to 512. For 1024, 2014 is less than twice 1024 (2048). So 2014 and 1024 would both be in the set. Then, for the pair (1024,2014), since 2014 &lt; 2*1024, but 2014 &gt; 1024/2, so 2*2014 &gt;1024, which is true. Therefore, both (1024,1024,2014) and (2014,2014,1024) would be valid. Therefore, two triangles, which is invalid. Therefore, we cannot add 2014 to the original set. Therefore, the original set of 10 elements is the maximum if we strictly follow the doubling. But wait, perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way to include more elements. Let me think. Suppose we have elements arranged such that every element is more than twice the previous one, but allowing some gaps. For example, instead of 2,4,8,16,..., maybe 2,5,10,20,... but since the set A is all even numbers, so 5 isn&#39;t in A. So maybe 2,6,14,30,... but even numbers. Wait, but how would that help? Alternatively, maybe using a higher starting point. For example, starting at 4,8,16,... which gives 9 elements. But as before, starting at 2 gives 10 elements, which is better. Alternatively, divide the set A into different ranges where within each range, the elements are spaced by at least double. For example, in the lower half, take elements spaced by factor 2, then in the upper half, take another set. But overlapping might cause issues. Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each element is a node, and an edge connects two nodes if they can coexist in B (i.e., one is at least twice the other). Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum clique in this graph. However, finding maximum cliques is generally hard, but maybe the structure here allows for an easy solution. But perhaps not necessary. Let&#39;s think recursively. To maximize the size of B, we can use a recursive approach: for each element, decide whether to include it or not, based on whether it conflicts with previously included elements. However, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, think of the problem as similar to the problem of scheduling intervals where you can&#39;t have overlapping intervals, but in this case, it&#39;s about numbers and ratios. Wait, here&#39;s another idea. Since all elements are even numbers, let&#39;s divide each element by 2. Then, the set becomes {1,2,3,...,1007}. The problem then transforms to: find the largest subset B&#39; of {1,2,...,1007} such that any two elements in B&#39; satisfy that one is at least twice the other. Then the answer for the original problem is the same as the answer for this transformed problem. This might make it easier to think about. So now, we need the largest subset of {1,2,...,1007} where any two elements satisfy that one is at least twice the other. This is a classic problem known as the &quot;no two elements in a factor of 2&quot; problem. The maximum size of such a subset is equal to the number of times you can divide 1007 by 2 and take the floor each time, until you reach 1, plus 1. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the maximum size is the number of elements in the largest possible &quot;greedy&quot; subset where each element is at least twice the previous one. Starting from the largest element and working backwards. Let me recall that in the classic problem, to find the maximum subset where each element is at least twice the previous one, you can start from the smallest element and keep multiplying by 2. But if you start from the largest element and divide by 2 each time, taking the floor, you might get more elements. Wait, here&#39;s a method: to maximize the number of elements, you can partition the set {1,2,...,n} into as many subsets as possible where each subset is of the form {x, 2x, 4x, 8x, ...}. The maximum number of such subsets is equal to the number of ones in the binary representation of n, but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, another approach is to consider the binary representation of the numbers. But perhaps that&#39;s complicating things. Wait, let me look up the concept. This is similar to the concept of &quot;Sidon sequences&quot; or &quot;geometric progressions&quot;, but not exactly. Alternatively, it&#39;s similar to the problem of selecting the maximum number of elements such that no two elements are in a ratio between 1 and 2. Yes, this is similar to a problem where you want to avoid elements that are too close in ratio. The standard approach for maximizing the size of such a set is to use a greedy algorithm where you start with the smallest element, then select the next element as the smallest possible number that is at least twice the previous one. But in our transformed problem (with numbers 1 to 1007), this would give: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. Wait, 512*2=1024 &gt;1007, so stop at 512. That gives 10 elements. But 512*2=1024 &gt;1007, so indeed, the sequence stops at 512. But 1007 is the maximum element. So if we do the same as above, starting at 1, we get 10 elements. However, if we start at a higher number, say 2, we get 2,4,8,...,512. That&#39;s 9 elements. Alternatively, if we start at 3, 6,12,..., but 3 is not in the original set A (since we divided by 2, original A had only even numbers, so transformed A has 1,2,...,1007). Wait, no, the transformed set is {1,2,...,1007}, including all integers. But the original problem had only even numbers. Wait, original A is {2,4,...,2014}, so when we divide by 2, it becomes {1,2,...,1007}. So the transformed problem is indeed to find the maximum subset of {1,2,...,1007} with the given condition. So the standard approach gives 10 elements. However, since 1007 is larger than 512, maybe we can include 1007 as the last element. Let&#39;s see. If we take the sequence 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1007. Let&#39;s check the ratios. 1007 is more than twice 512 (2*512=1024). 1007 is less than 1024, so 1007 &lt; 2*512. Therefore, 1007 is not twice 512. Therefore, 512 and 1007 do not satisfy the ratio condition. So they cannot both be in the set. Therefore, we cannot include 1007 in the sequence. Alternatively, if we replace 512 with 1007. Let&#39;s see: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,503. Wait, 503*2=1006, which is less than 1007. So 503 is in the transformed set (original number 1006 in A). Wait, no, in the transformed set, the numbers are 1 to 1007, so 503 is included. Wait, but 256*2=512. If we take 256, then next would be 512. If we skip 512 and take 503 instead, then 503 is not twice 256. 503 /256 ≈1.96, which is less than 2. Therefore, 503 is not twice 256, so they can&#39;t coexist. Therefore, replacing 512 with 503 is invalid. Alternatively, can we have two separate sequences? For example, 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512 and 3,6,12,24,48,96,192,384,768. Let&#39;s see how many elements that is. First sequence: 10 elements. Second sequence: 3,6,12,24,48,96,192,384,768. That&#39;s 9 elements. But 768*2=1536 &gt;1007, so stops at 768. Now, check if elements from the first and second sequences conflict. For example, 1 and 3: 3 is more than twice 1, okay. 2 and 3: 3 is not twice 2. 3/2=1.5 &lt;2, so they cannot coexist. Therefore, we can&#39;t have both sequences. Therefore, interleaving sequences doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, the maximum size remains 10 elements. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the transformed problem has a maximum subset size of 10, which corresponds to the original problem&#39;s maximum subset size of 10 as well, since each element in the transformed set is half of the original set. But wait, in the transformed set, the elements are 1 to 1007, and the maximum subset size is 10. Therefore, in the original problem, the maximum subset size is also 10, corresponding to the elements 2,4,8,...,1024. But wait, 2^10 = 1024, which is half of 2048, but 2014 is the maximum element in A. Wait, but in the transformed problem, the maximum element is 1007, and the largest element in the subset is 512. So 512*2=1024, which is not in the transformed set, but in the original set, 512*2=1024 is included. Wait, in the original set A, 1024 is included because 1024 is even and &lt;=2014. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a confusion here. When we transformed the original set A by dividing each element by 2, we get {1,2,...,1007}. The maximum subset B&#39; in this transformed set is size 10, which maps back to {2,4,8,...,1024} in the original set. But 1024 is indeed in A. So that&#39;s correct. However, the transformed problem&#39;s maximum element in the subset is 512, which maps to 1024 in the original problem. Then, 512*2=1024 is included in the transformed set&#39;s next element, but 1024*2=2048 is beyond 1007. Therefore, in the transformed set, the sequence stops at 512. But in the original problem, 1024 is included, but 2048 is not. So the original sequence can go up to 1024, which is 10 elements. But wait, in the transformed set, 1,2,4,...,512 is 10 elements (since 2^0=1 up to 2^9=512). Therefore, mapping back, 2^1=2 up to 2^10=1024, which is 10 elements. Therefore, the answer should be 10. However, the problem statement says &quot;the maximum number of elements in set B is...&quot;. But let&#39;s verify once more. Wait, maybe there is a way to include more elements. For example, in the transformed set {1,2,...,1007}, maybe we can take the sequence starting from 1,2,4,...,512, which is 10 elements. But also, can we add 3? Since 3 is more than twice 1 (3 &gt;=2*1). However, 3 and 2: 3 is not twice 2 (3/2=1.5 &lt;2), so they cannot coexist. Therefore, if we include 3, we have to exclude 2. So replacing 2 with 3 would not help. Similarly, starting from higher numbers might not help. Alternatively, split the set into two parts: lower and upper. For example, take elements from 1 to 500 and 501 to 1007. In the lower half, take the greedy sequence 1,2,4,...,256. In the upper half, take 501, 502,..., but need to ensure that each element in the upper half is at least twice the elements in the lower half. Wait, 501 is more than twice 256 (2*256=512). 501 &lt;512, so 501 is not twice 256. Therefore, you can&#39;t include 501 with 256. Therefore, this approach fails. Alternatively, start from the middle. Suppose we take elements around 500. But 500 is 500, but then elements below 250 cannot be included, and elements above 1000 would need to be included. But 1007 is the maximum. However, 500 and 1000 would satisfy 1000 &gt;=2*500, so they can coexist. But this gives only two elements. Alternatively, perhaps using multiple geometric sequences with different starting points where each starting point is spaced far enough apart. For example, first sequence: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512. Second sequence: 3,6,12,24,48,96,192,384,768. Third sequence:5,10,20,40,80,160,320,640. Fourth sequence:7,14,28,56,112,224,448,896. Etc. However, the problem is that elements from different sequences might conflict. For example, 1 and 3: 3 is more than twice 1, so okay. 2 and 3: 3 is not twice 2, so they can&#39;t coexist. Similarly, 4 and 6: 6 is not twice 4. Therefore, these sequences cannot be combined. Therefore, the only way to have a valid subset is to choose one such geometric sequence. Hence, the maximum size is 10 elements. But wait, let&#39;s check the transformed problem again. If in the transformed problem (1 to 1007), the maximum subset size is 10, then in the original problem, it&#39;s also 10. So the answer should be 10. However, the problem states that the original set A is {2,4,...,2014}, which is 1007 elements (since 2014/2=1007). So 2,4,...,2014 is 1007 elements. Then, the maximum subset B is 10 elements. But wait, actually, 2^1=2, 2^2=4,...,2^10=1024. Then 2^11=2048&gt;2014. So the number of elements in the geometric sequence starting at 2 with ratio 2 is 10 elements. But wait, the problem is in the original set A, which is {2,4,6,...,2014}. However, the answer is about the maximum subset B where every pair satisfies one is at least twice the other. But in this case, we have such a subset with 10 elements. But maybe there is a larger subset. Wait, here&#39;s a different approach. Let me consider the problem in terms of binary representations. Each even number can be written as 2 times an integer. So as before, if we write each element as 2k where k is from 1 to 1007. Then, the problem reduces to choosing a subset of K = {k1, k2, ..., kn} from {1,2,...,1007} such that for any two elements in K, one is at least twice the other. So the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum K. Now, this is a well-known problem in combinatorics. The maximum size of such a subset is equal to the number of times you can divide the maximum number by 2 until you reach 1. For example, in {1,2,...,n}, the maximum size is floor(log2(n)) +1. But wait, for n=1007, log2(1007) is approximately 9.97, so floor(log2(1007))=9, then +1 gives 10. So that&#39;s 10 elements. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the maximum size is 10. Therefore, the answer should be 10. But wait, let me check with n=1007. Let&#39;s compute log2(1007). 2^10=1024. So log2(1007) is slightly less than 10. Therefore, floor(log2(1007))=9, then +1=10. Therefore, the maximum size is 10. So that&#39;s confirmed. Therefore, the answer is 10. So the maximum number of elements in B is 10. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{10}. But wait, hold on. Let me confirm with an example. Let&#39;s take n=10. Then the maximum subset would be {1,2,4,8} which is 4 elements. floor(log2(10))=3, +1=4. Correct. For n=7, floor(log2(7))=2, +1=3. The subset {1,2,4} or {1,3,7} both have 3 elements. So that works. Therefore, applying this formula, for n=1007, the maximum size is floor(log2(1007)) +1=9+1=10. Therefore, the answer is 10. Therefore, the maximum number of elements in set B is 10. But let me check if there&#39;s a way to get more than 10 elements. Suppose we take the sequence 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024. That&#39;s 10 elements. If we remove 1024 and include 2014 instead, as before, but then check if we can add any other elements. For example, after including 2014, can we add 1024? No, because 2014 and 1024 would create two triangles. Alternatively, can we add other elements like 514, but 514 is less than 512*2=1024. Wait, 514 is in A. So if we have 512 and 514, 514 is less than 2*512=1024, so 512 and 514 cannot coexist. Similarly, any number between 512 and 1024 would conflict with 512. Alternatively, numbers between 1024 and 2014. If we include 1024 and 2014, they conflict. If we don&#39;t include 1024, can we include multiple numbers above 1024? For example, 1026, 1028,...,2014. But each pair of these numbers would need to satisfy that one is at least twice the other. But since they are consecutive even numbers, their ratio is just over 1. So they cannot coexist. Therefore, we can include at most one number from the range 1024 to 2014. Therefore, if we replace 1024 with 2014, we still have 10 elements. So the maximum size remains 10. Alternatively, if we remove some middle elements to include higher ones. For example, remove 512 and include 1024 and 2014. But then 256 and 1024 can coexist (1024 is 4*256), but 256 and 2014: 2014 is more than twice 256 (2*256=512), so they can coexist. But 512 was removed. However, 256 and 1024: 1024 is exactly 4 times 256, so 1024 &gt;= 2*256, so okay. 1024 and 2014: as before, they conflict. Therefore, cannot include both. Therefore, removing 512 to include both 1024 and 2014 would still require removing one of them, so net gain is zero. Therefore, it seems that no matter how we arrange, we cannot get more than 10 elements. Thus, the maximum number of elements in set B is 10. Final Answerboxed{10}&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( A = {2, 4, ldots, 2014} ), we need to find the maximum number of elements in a subset ( B ) such that for any two elements ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) in ( B ), there is exactly one isosceles triangle that can be formed with ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) as side lengths. To solve this, we need to ensure that for any pair ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) in ( B ), one element is at least twice the other. This ensures that only one isosceles triangle can be formed (either ( (a_i, a_i, a_j) ) or ( (a_j, a_j, a_i) )) due to the triangle inequality.We transform the problem by considering the set ( A&#39; = {1, 2, ldots, 1007} ) obtained by dividing each element of ( A ) by 2. The task now is to find the largest subset ( B&#39; ) of ( A&#39; ) such that any two elements in ( B&#39; ) satisfy the condition that one is at least twice the other. This is a classic problem where the maximum size of such a subset is determined by repeatedly dividing the largest element by 2 until reaching 1.The maximum size of such a subset in ( A&#39; ) is given by the number of times we can divide 1007 by 2 and take the floor each time until we reach 1. This results in 10 elements: ( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 ). Mapping these back to the original set ( A ), we get ( 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 ).Thus, the maximum number of elements in set ( B ) is (boxed{10}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a2ce2ec></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a2ce2ec><span class="icon" data-v-3a2ce2ec>🔑:</span>7. 10 .By symmetry, without loss of generality, assume a_{i}&lt;a_{j}. Then there must exist an isosceles triangle with a_{j} as the waist and a_{i} as the base, and there is only one isosceles triangle with a_{i} and a_{j} as side lengths.Thus, a_{i}+a_{i} leqslant a_{j} Rightarrow a_{j} geqslant 2 a_{i}.This indicates that, when the elements of set B are arranged in ascending order, each subsequent element is at least twice the previous one.Therefore, when the number of elements is maximized, the setB={2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024} text {. }</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-341a6e3d><span data-v-341a6e3d>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
