coprime. Pairwise coprime means that any two of them have no common divisors other than 1. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We need three numbers greater than 1, say a, b, c, such that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1. Their sum is a + b + c = n. We have to find the largest n for which this is impossible.Let me start by listing some numbers and see if they can be expressed in such a way. Maybe patterns will emerge.Starting with small n. Since each number must be greater than 1, the smallest possible sum is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. But wait, 2, 2, 2 are not pairwise coprime because they all share the common divisor 2. So that sum isn&#39;t allowed. So we need three numbers greater than 1, pairwise coprime. The smallest such numbers would be 2, 3, and 4. Wait, 2 and 4 are not coprime. Oops, that&#39;s a problem.Wait, so maybe the smallest triplet would be 2, 3, 5. Their sum is 10. Let me check if there are smaller sums.Wait, 2, 3, and 4: 2 and 3 are coprime, 3 and 4 are coprime, but 2 and 4 are not. So that&#39;s invalid.How about 2, 3, 5: 2+3+5=10. 2,3,5 are all pairwise coprime. So 10 can be expressed as such. What about 9? Let&#39;s see.Trying to get 9 as a sum of three numbers greater than 1, pairwise coprime. Let&#39;s see: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9. But again, 2 and 4 aren&#39;t coprime. 2 + 2 + 5 = 9. But 2 and 2 are not coprime. 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. All same numbers, not coprime. 3 + 5 + 1 = 9, but 1 is not allowed since numbers must be bigger than 1. Hmm. So maybe 9 cannot be expressed?Wait, but 2, 3, 4 sum to 9, but 2 and 4 aren&#39;t coprime. 3, 5, 1 but 1 is invalid. 2, 5, 2: 2 and 2 not coprime. So maybe 9 cannot be expressed? But wait, the problem is asking for the largest n that cannot be expressed. So maybe 9 is a candidate. But wait, before concluding that, let&#39;s check again.Wait, maybe 2, 3, 5 is 10. 2, 3, 4 is 9 but invalid. Let&#39;s see if 9 can be written in another way. For example, 3, 4, 2—same as before. 5, 2, 2: same as before. 3, 5, 1: invalid. So perhaps 9 cannot be expressed. Wait, but maybe another combination?Wait, 2, 5, 2: sum is 9. But 2 and 2 are not coprime. 3, 3, 3: sum is 9, but all are 3s. So 9 seems impossible. So 9 is a candidate. Let&#39;s check 10: 2, 3, 5. That works. 11: Let&#39;s see. 3 + 4 + 4 = 11. But 4 and 4 are not coprime. 2 + 4 + 5 = 11. 2 and 4 are not coprime. 3 + 5 + 3 = 11. 3 and 3 are not coprime. 2 + 3 + 6 = 11. 2 and 6 are not coprime. 5 + 6 + 0: invalid. Wait, maybe 3 + 4 + 4: same as above. Hmm. Wait, maybe 5 + 3 + 3: same. Not coprime. Hmm. Is there a way?Wait, 2, 3, 6: sum 11. 2 and 3 are coprime, 3 and 6 are not. 2 and 6 not. 2, 5, 4: sum 11. 2 and 4 are not coprime. 3, 5, 3: same as before. 7, 2, 2: 2 and 2. 7, 3, 1: invalid. Hmm. So maybe 11 cannot be expressed either? Wait, but 2, 3, 6: no. 3, 4, 4: no. Wait, 5, 3, 3: no. How about 7, 2, 2: sum 11, but 2 and 2. 5, 2, 4: sum 11, 2 and 4. Hmm.Wait, maybe 5, 3, 3: sum 11. 5 and 3 are coprime, but 3 and 3 are not. So that&#39;s invalid. How about 7, 2, 2: same issue. 2, 3, 6: same problem. So maybe 11 is also not expressible. Hmm. Let&#39;s check 12. 2, 3, 7: sum 12. 2, 3, 7 are pairwise coprime. Yes. So 12 can be expressed. 11 might not be expressible. Let me check again.Wait, 3, 4, 4: sum 11. 3 and 4 are coprime, but 4 and 4 are not. So invalid. 5, 3, 3: same. 2, 5, 4: sum 11, 2 and 4 not coprime. 7, 2, 2: not coprime. 3, 5, 3: not coprime. 2, 7, 2: same. Hmm. Maybe 11 is not possible.So 9 and 11 might not be expressible. But wait, what about 3, 4, 4? Wait, 3 and 4 are coprime, but the two 4s are not. So the triplet must be pairwise coprime. So all pairs need to be coprime. Therefore, in 3, 4, 4, 4 and 4 are not coprime, so that&#39;s invalid. So 11 is not possible. How about 13? Let&#39;s see. 3, 4, 6: 3 and 4 are coprime, 3 and 6 are not. 2, 5, 6: 2 and 5 are coprime, 2 and 6 are not. 5, 4, 4: same as above. 2, 3, 8: 2 and 8 not coprime. 3, 5, 5: 3 and 5 are coprime, but 5 and 5 are not. 7, 2, 4: 7 and 2 coprime, 2 and 4 not. 7, 3, 3: 7 and 3 coprime, 3 and 3 not. 5, 7, 1: invalid. Hmm. Maybe 13 is also not expressible? Wait, 2, 5, 6: sum 13. 2, 5 coprime; 5,6 coprime; 2,6 gcd 2. So not pairwise. Hmm. Wait, 3, 5, 5: sum 13. 3 and 5 coprime, but 5 and 5 not. 3, 4, 6: 3 and 4 coprime, 3 and 6 not. Hmm. 5, 4, 4: same problem. 7, 3, 3: same. 11, 2, 0: invalid. Maybe 13 is also not possible? Wait, 2, 3, 8: 2 and 8. 2, 7, 4: same. Hmm. Wait, maybe 5, 7, 1: invalid. 5, 6, 2: 5 and 6 coprime, 6 and 2 not. 7, 5, 1: invalid. 3, 10, 0: nope. Hmm. Maybe 13 is not possible. Wait, 2, 3, 8: no. 2, 5, 6: no. 3, 5, 5: no. 7, 3, 3: no. So maybe 13 is also not possible? Wait, 3, 4, 6: 3 and 4 are coprime, 3 and 6 not. So that&#39;s not.Wait, maybe 3, 5, 5: sum 13. 3 and 5 are coprime, but 5 and 5 are not. So invalid. So perhaps 13 cannot be expressed. Then 14? Let&#39;s try 2, 5, 7: sum 14. 2, 5, 7 are pairwise coprime. Yes. So 14 is possible. So 14 is okay. 13 is not. Then 11, 9, 13 are candidates. Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another way to express 13? Let me think.Wait, 3, 4, 6: sum 13. 3 and 4 are coprime, 3 and 6 have gcd 3. 4 and 6 have gcd 2. So no. 5, 8, 0: invalid. 7, 6, 0: invalid. 2, 11, 0: invalid. Hmm. Maybe 13 is not possible. So so far, 9, 11, 13 are not possible. Wait, but 15? Let&#39;s check 15. 3, 5, 7: sum 15. All pairwise coprime. Yes. So 15 is possible. So 15 is okay.So then, 13 is maybe the next candidate. Wait, but let me check 16. 3, 5, 8: sum 16. 3 and 5 coprime, 3 and 8 coprime, 5 and 8 coprime. Yes. So 16 is okay. 17: 5, 6, 6: sum 17. 5 and 6 coprime, but 6 and 6 not. 3, 5, 9: sum 17. 3 and 5 coprime, 3 and 9 not. 2, 5, 10: sum 17. 2 and 5 coprime, 2 and 10 not. 7, 5, 5: sum 17. 7 and 5 coprime, but 5 and 5 not. 3, 7, 7: same problem. 2, 7, 8: sum 17. 2 and 7 coprime, 7 and 8 coprime, 2 and 8 not. So invalid. 3, 7, 7: same. Hmm. 5, 7, 5: same. 11, 3, 3: same. Wait, 11, 5, 1: invalid. 13, 2, 2: same. Hmm. 17 might be difficult, but maybe there&#39;s a valid triplet. Let me think.Wait, 5, 6, 6: sum 17. As above. 7, 8, 2: sum 17. 7 and 8 coprime, 8 and 2 not. 9, 5, 3: sum 17. 9 and 3 are not coprime. 10, 5, 2: sum 17. 10 and 5 not coprime. 4, 5, 8: sum 17. 4 and 8 not coprime. 4, 9, 4: sum 17. 9 and 4 coprime, but 4 and 4 not. Hmm. Maybe 17 is not possible. Wait, 3, 5, 9: sum 17. 3 and 5 coprime, 3 and 9 not. 5, 7, 5: same. 7, 7, 3: same. 11, 5, 1: invalid. Hmm. So maybe 17 is also not possible. Wait, but 3, 4, 10: sum 17. 3 and 4 coprime, 4 and 10 have gcd 2. 3 and 10 coprime. So only 4 and 10 not coprime. So invalid. Hmm.Wait, maybe 2, 7, 8: sum 17. 2 and 7 coprime, 7 and 8 coprime, but 2 and 8 not. So invalid. 3, 11, 3: same. Hmm. So perhaps 17 is another candidate. Then 19? Let&#39;s check.For 19: 5, 7, 7: same issue. 3, 5, 11: sum 19. 3, 5, 11 are pairwise coprime. Yes! So 3 + 5 + 11 = 19. So 19 is possible. Therefore, 17 is still in question. Let me check again.Wait, 3, 5, 9: sum 17. 3 and 9 not coprime. 5, 6, 6: sum 17, but 6 and 6. 2, 5, 10: sum 17, 2 and 10. 3, 7, 7: sum 17, 7 and 7. 11, 3, 3: same. 13, 2, 2: same. 7, 8, 2: same. Hmm. Maybe 17 cannot be expressed? Wait, 2, 3, 12: sum 17. 2 and 3 coprime, 3 and 12 not. 2, 11, 4: sum 17. 2 and 4 not coprime. 5, 7, 5: same. 3, 13, 1: invalid. 7, 9, 1: invalid. Hmm. Maybe 17 is indeed impossible. Then 18? Let&#39;s check.18: 5, 6, 7: sum 18. 5 and 6 coprime, 6 and 7 coprime, 5 and 7 coprime. Yes! All pairwise coprime. So 5 + 6 + 7 = 18. So 18 is possible. So 17 is still the candidate. Then 19 is okay, 20? Let&#39;s check.20: 3, 7, 10: sum 20. 3 and 7 coprime, 7 and 10 coprime, 3 and 10 coprime. Yes. So 20 is okay. So the numbers after 17 can be expressed. So perhaps 17 is the largest one that cannot be expressed. Wait, but let&#39;s check 17 again. Maybe I missed something.Wait, 2, 5, 10: sum 17. 2 and 5 coprime, 2 and 10 not. 3, 5, 9: 3 and 9. 5, 7, 5: same. 7, 8, 2: same. 11, 3, 3: same. 13, 2, 2: same. 17, 0, 0: invalid. So maybe 17 is indeed not possible. Then 17 is the candidate. But earlier, 13 also couldn&#39;t be expressed. Wait, but the problem is asking for the largest n. So if 17 is larger than 13, and 17 cannot be expressed, then 17 is the answer? But wait, let me check 17 again. Is there any triplet?Wait, 3, 4, 10: sum 17. 3 and 4 coprime, 3 and 10 coprime, 4 and 10 have gcd 2. So invalid. 5, 6, 6: sum 17. 5 and 6 coprime, 6 and 6 not. 7, 9, 1: invalid. 2, 15, 0: invalid. 3, 14, 0: invalid. 5, 12, 0: invalid. Hmm. I can&#39;t find any triplet for 17. So maybe 17 is the answer.But let&#39;s check if numbers after 17 can be expressed. We saw 18, 19, 20 can be. How about 21? 7, 8, 6: sum 21. 7, 8, 6. 7 and 8 coprime, 8 and 6 gcd 2, 7 and 6 coprime. So not pairwise. 5, 7, 9: sum 21. 5 and 7 coprime, 7 and 9 coprime, 5 and 9 coprime. Yes! 5, 7, 9 are all pairwise coprime. So 21 is possible. 22: 5, 8, 9: sum 22. 5, 8, 9. All pairwise coprime. Yes. 23: 5, 9, 9: sum 23. 9 and 9 not coprime. 7, 8, 8: same. 5, 7, 11: sum 23. 5, 7, 11 are pairwise coprime. Yes. 24: 5, 7, 12: 5 and 7 coprime, 7 and 12 coprime, 5 and 12 coprime. Yes. 25: 5, 7, 13: sum 25. All pairwise coprime. So it seems like from 18 upwards, numbers can be expressed. But wait, 17 is in the middle. Let me confirm for 17 again. Is there a combination I might have missed?Wait, 3, 5, 9: sum 17. 3 and 5 are coprime, 3 and 9 are not. 2, 5, 10: 2 and 5 coprime, but 2 and 10 not. 7, 5, 5: 7 and 5 coprime, but 5 and 5 not. 11, 3, 3: same. 13, 2, 2: same. 17, 0, 0: invalid. 3, 11, 3: same. 7, 7, 3: same. 2, 7, 8: 2 and 7 coprime, 7 and 8 coprime, but 2 and 8 not. So nope. 3, 7, 7: same. 5, 5, 7: same. 2, 3, 12: 2 and 3 coprime, 3 and 12 not. 2, 11, 4: 2 and 4 not coprime. 3, 13, 1: invalid. 5, 11, 1: invalid. Hmm. I can&#39;t find any triplet for 17. So 17 is not possible.Then according to this, the largest n that cannot be expressed is 17. But wait, what about 13? Earlier, I thought 13 couldn&#39;t be expressed. Let me check again. Maybe there&#39;s a way.For n=13: Let&#39;s see. 2, 4, 7: sum 13. 2 and 4 not coprime. 3, 5, 5: sum 13. 5 and 5 not coprime. 3, 4, 6: sum 13. 3 and 6 not coprime. 5, 7, 1: invalid. 2, 5, 6: sum 13. 2 and 6 not coprime. 7, 3, 3: sum 13. 3 and 3 not coprime. 2, 3, 8: sum 13. 2 and 8 not coprime. 5, 4, 4: sum 13. 4 and 4 not coprime. 3, 10, 0: invalid. 11, 2, 0: invalid. Hmm. So 13 also cannot be expressed. So 17 and 13 are both impossible.Similarly, 11 and 9. So then, which is the largest? 17 is larger than 13, 11, 9. So if 17 cannot be expressed and all numbers above 17 can be expressed, then 17 is the answer.But wait, let me check numbers between 17 and 20. We saw 18, 19, 20 can be expressed. Let me check 21, which can be expressed. 22, 23, 24, etc. So if all numbers from 18 onwards can be expressed, then 17 is the answer.But let me check if numbers like 14, 15, 16 can be expressed. 14: 2, 5, 7. 15: 3, 5, 7. 16: 3, 5, 8. 17: can&#39;t. 18: 5, 6, 7. 19: 3, 5, 11. 20: 3, 7, 10. So 17 is the only one in that range that can&#39;t be expressed.But wait, 17 is the largest? Let me check even higher numbers to see if they can be expressed. Let&#39;s take 25: 5, 7, 13. 26: 5, 7, 14 (but 7 and 14 not coprime). Wait, 5, 8, 13: sum 26. All coprime. Yes. 27: 7, 8, 12: 8 and 12 not coprime. 5, 11, 11: 11 and 11. 3, 11, 13: sum 27. All coprime. Yes. 28: 5, 11, 12: sum 28. All coprime. 5 and 11, 11 and 12, 5 and 12. 29: 5, 11, 13: sum 29. All coprime. 30: 7, 11, 12: sum 30. All coprime. So seems like once we pass 17, we can always find such triplets.But wait, is there a general way to construct such triplets? For example, if n is even or odd? Let me think. For even numbers, maybe 2 plus two odds. But 2 has to be coprime with the other two. If the other two are coprime with each other as well. For example, take 2, a, b where a and b are coprime and both odd. Then their sum would be 2 + a + b.Similarly, for odd numbers, we can have three odd numbers. But they need to be pairwise coprime. For example, 3, 5, 7, etc. So maybe for numbers greater than 17, we can always adjust the triplet accordingly.Alternatively, maybe use 2, 3, and n - 5. But n - 5 needs to be coprime with 2 and 3. So n - 5 should not be even (to be coprime with 2) and not divisible by 3. So if n - 5 is an odd number not divisible by 3, then 2, 3, n - 5 would be pairwise coprime. Let&#39;s see.For example, take n = 18. n - 5 = 13. 13 is coprime with 2 and 3. So 2, 3, 13. Sum 18. Okay.n = 19: n - 5 = 14. 14 is even, so not coprime with 2. So this approach fails. But 19 can be expressed as 3, 5, 11.Alternatively, use 3, 5, n - 8. For n = 19, 19 - 8 = 11. 3, 5, 11. Yes. So that works. So maybe different constructions for different residues.Alternatively, using 2, 5, n - 7. For n = 17, n - 7 = 10. 2, 5, 10. But 2 and 10 are not coprime. So that fails. Hmm.Alternatively, if n is large enough, we can subtract a prime number and decompose the remaining into two numbers. But maybe this is getting too vague.Alternatively, perhaps after a certain number, all numbers can be expressed as such. If 17 is the largest, then maybe 17 is the answer.But let&#39;s check another number, say 23. 5, 7, 11: sum 23. All coprime. 24: 5, 7, 12. 5 and 7 coprime, 7 and 12 coprime, 5 and 12 coprime. 25: 5, 7, 13. 26: 5, 11, 10: 10 and 5 not coprime. Wait, 5, 11, 10: invalid. How about 3, 11, 12: sum 26. 3, 11, 12. All coprime. Yes. 27: 3, 11, 13. 28: 5, 11, 12. 29: 5, 11, 13. 30: 7, 11, 12. So yes, seems manageable.So, stepping back, the numbers that cannot be expressed as such sums are 9, 11, 13, 17. The largest among them is 17. So, tentatively, 17 is the answer. But I need to confirm whether 17 is indeed impossible and all numbers above can be expressed.But just to make sure, let me try to see if there&#39;s a way to express 17. Let&#39;s list all possible triplets of numbers greater than 1 that sum to 17 and check if any are pairwise coprime.Possible triplets:Start with the smallest number 2:2, 2, 13: Not coprime (2 and 2)2, 3, 12: 2 and 12 not coprime2, 4, 11: 2 and 4 not coprime2, 5, 10: 2 and 10 not coprime2, 6, 9: 2 and 6 not coprime2, 7, 8: 2 and 8 not coprime2, 8, 7: same as above2, 9, 6: same as above2, 10, 5: same as above2, 11, 4: same as above2, 12, 3: same as above2, 13, 2: same as aboveNext, starting with 3:3, 3, 11: Not coprime (3 and 3)3, 4, 10: 3 and 10 coprime, 4 and 10 not3, 5, 9: 3 and 9 not coprime3, 6, 8: 3 and 6 not coprime3, 7, 7: Not coprime (7 and 7)3, 8, 6: same as above3, 9, 5: same as above3, 10, 4: same as above3, 11, 3: same as aboveStarting with 4:4, 4, 9: Not coprime (4 and 4)4, 5, 8: 4 and 8 not coprime4, 6, 7: 4 and 6 not coprime4, 7, 6: same as above4, 8, 5: same as above4, 9, 4: same as aboveStarting with 5:5, 5, 7: Not coprime (5 and 5)5, 6, 6: Not coprime (6 and 6)5, 7, 5: same as above5, 8, 4: same as above5, 9, 3: same as above5, 10, 2: same as aboveStarting with 6:6, 6, 5: Not coprime6, 7, 4: 6 and 4 not coprime6, 8, 3: same6, 9, 2: sameSimilarly, starting with 7:7, 7, 3: Not coprime7, 8, 2: 7 and 8 coprime, 8 and 2 not7, 9, 1: invalid7, 10, 0: invalidSo, after checking all possible triplets, there is no valid triplet where all three numbers are greater than 1 and pairwise coprime that sum to 17. Therefore, 17 cannot be expressed in such a way.Since all numbers greater than 17 can be expressed (as we saw examples up to 30 and reasoning suggests it continues), the largest positive integer n that cannot be written as the sum of three numbers greater than 1 which are pairwise coprime is 17.Final Answerboxed{17}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the largest positive integer ( n ) which cannot be written as the sum of three numbers greater than 1 which are pairwise coprime, we need to check each ( n ) and see if it can be expressed as such a sum. 1. Checking small values:   - The smallest possible sum of three numbers greater than 1 is ( 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 ).   - Values like 9, 11, 13, and 17 were found to be non-expressible as sums of three pairwise coprime numbers greater than 1.2. Detailed check for ( n = 17 ):   - Possible triplets were examined, but none of them were pairwise coprime. For example:     - ( 2, 5, 10 ): 2 and 10 are not coprime.     - ( 3, 5, 9 ): 3 and 9 are not coprime.     - ( 5, 6, 6 ): 6 and 6 are not coprime.     - All other combinations either had repeated numbers or non-coprime pairs.3. Verification for larger values:   - Values greater than 17 (e.g., 18, 19, 20, etc.) were checked and found to be expressible as sums of three pairwise coprime numbers greater than 1. For example:     - ( 18 = 5 + 6 + 7 )     - ( 19 = 3 + 5 + 11 )     - ( 20 = 3 + 7 + 10 )4. Conclusion:   - The largest ( n ) that cannot be expressed as the sum of three numbers greater than 1 which are pairwise coprime is 17.[boxed{17}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem: Determine the largest positive integer ( n ) which cannot be written as the sum of three numbers bigger than 1 which are pairwise coprime. Hmm, pairwise coprime means that any two of them share no common divisors other than 1. And all three numbers have to be greater than 1. So, I need to find the biggest number that can&#39;t be expressed as such a sum. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need three numbers ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), each greater than 1, such that ( a + b + c = n ), and ( gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,c) = gcd(b,c) = 1 ). And we need the largest ( n ) for which this isn&#39;t possible. Alright.So, the strategy here might be to look for numbers that can&#39;t be expressed in such a way and find the maximum one. To do that, perhaps I should first try to see patterns or possible combinations that work and then see where the gaps are.Let me start by considering small numbers and see how they can be expressed (or not) as such sums. Since all three numbers must be greater than 1, the smallest possible sum is ( 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 ). Wait, 2, 3, and 4. Are they pairwise coprime? Let&#39;s check: gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(2,4)=2, which is not 1. So, that&#39;s not coprime. Oops, so 2, 3, 4 is invalid. Hmm, so my mistake. Then the smallest possible sum would actually be with numbers that are pairwise coprime. Let&#39;s see.The smallest three numbers greater than 1 that are pairwise coprime are 2, 3, and 5. Their sum is 10. So, 10 is the smallest such number. Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a smaller combination. Let&#39;s check.If we take 2, 3, and 4: as above, gcd(2,4)=2, so not coprime. 2,3,5: sum is 10. 2,3,7: sum is 12. Wait, maybe 3,4,5: gcd(3,4)=1, gcd(3,5)=1, gcd(4,5)=1. Yes, those are pairwise coprime. So 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. Wait, but 3,4,5: 3 and 4 are coprime, 3 and 5 are coprime, 4 and 5 are coprime. So that works. So 12 can be expressed as such a sum.But 10 can be expressed as 2, 3, 5. Wait, but 2 and 3 are coprime, 2 and 5 are coprime, 3 and 5 are coprime. So yes, 10 is valid. So 10 is the smallest? Let me check 9. Can 9 be expressed as the sum of three numbers greater than 1, pairwise coprime? Let&#39;s see. The numbers must be at least 2. Let&#39;s try 2, 3, 4: sum 9, but 2 and 4 are not coprime. Next, 2, 3, 5: sum 10. 2, 2, 5: sum 9, but duplicates are allowed? Wait, the problem says &quot;three numbers&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t specify they have to be distinct. However, pairwise coprime: if two numbers are equal, then their gcd is the number itself, which is greater than 1, so duplicates would not be coprime. Therefore, the numbers must be distinct. So, 2, 2, 5 is invalid. So 9 cannot be expressed as the sum of three distinct numbers greater than 1 which are pairwise coprime. Wait, but maybe 3, 3, 3: sum 9. But gcd(3,3)=3, so not coprime. So, 9 can&#39;t be expressed as such a sum. But wait, wait, the problem says &quot;three numbers&quot;, not necessarily distinct. However, even if they are allowed to be the same, two same numbers would not be coprime. So, duplicates are not allowed. So, 9 cannot be expressed. But earlier I thought that 10 is the minimum. So, 9 is the first candidate. But the question is asking for the largest positive integer that cannot be written as such a sum. So, perhaps 9 is one such number, but maybe there are larger numbers.Wait, but 10 can be written as 2,3,5. 11? Let&#39;s check 11. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s try combinations. Let&#39;s start with the smallest numbers. 2, 3, 6: sum 11. But gcd(2,6)=2, not coprime. 2, 4, 5: sum 11. gcd(2,4)=2. 3, 4, 4: sum 11, but duplicates. 3, 4, 4: gcd(4,4)=4. 2, 3, 6: as above. 2, 5, 4: same as 2,4,5. 3, 5, 3: duplicates. 5, 5, 1: but 1 is not allowed. Wait, numbers must be greater than 1. So, 3, 4, 4 is invalid. What about 3, 4, 5? Sum is 12. Hmm. 2, 3, 6: 11. Not coprime. 2, 5, 4: same as 2,4,5. 3, 5, 3: duplicates. 5, 2, 4: same as before. Hmm. How about 3, 4, 4: sum 11, but duplicates. 7, 2, 2: duplicates. 7, 3, 1: 1 is invalid. 7, 2, 2: invalid. So, seems like 11 cannot be written as such. Wait, but wait. What about 3, 4, 4? But 4 and 4 have a gcd of 4. So not coprime. So no. Hmm. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s another combination.Wait, 5, 3, 3: sum 11. Again, duplicates. So gcd(3,3)=3. Not coprime. 7, 2, 2: sum 11. Again duplicates. 2, 3, 6: same problem. 2, 7, 2: duplicates. So, seems like 11 can&#39;t be expressed. Hmm. What about 5, 3, 3: nope. 7, 3, 1: 1 is invalid. So, 11 might not be expressible. Then 12 can be expressed as 3,4,5. 13? Let&#39;s check 13. 2, 4, 7: sum 13. Check pairwise gcds: gcd(2,4)=2, so invalid. 3, 4, 6: gcd(3,6)=3. 2, 3, 8: gcd(2,8)=2. 5, 4, 4: duplicates. 3, 5, 5: duplicates. 2, 5, 6: sum 13. Check gcds: gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(2,6)=2, so invalid. 3, 5, 5: duplicates. 3, 6, 4: gcd(3,6)=3. 7, 2, 4: sum 13. gcd(2,4)=2. 7, 3, 3: duplicates. 5, 7, 1: 1 invalid. Wait, 3, 5, 5: no. 5, 5, 3: same. 7, 3, 3: same. Hmm. Maybe 5, 6, 2: same as 2,5,6. What about 3, 4, 6: gcd(3,6)=3. 3, 7, 3: duplicates. 2, 11, 0: invalid. Hmm. Maybe 5, 4, 4: duplicates. So, seems like 13 can&#39;t be expressed? Wait, let me check another combination. 7, 5, 1: invalid. 3, 5, 5: duplicates. Wait, maybe 5, 4, 4: same. 2, 3, 8: gcd(2,8)=2. 2, 7, 4: same as 2,4,7. 3, 10, 0: invalid. Wait, maybe 3, 5, 5 is invalid. Hmm. Wait, is there any combination for 13?Wait, 3, 4, 6: sum 13. gcd(3,6)=3. Not coprime. 3, 5, 5: duplicates. 5, 2, 6: same as before. 7, 2, 4: gcd(2,4)=2. 7, 3, 3: duplicates. 5, 7, 1: invalid. Hmm. Maybe 13 can&#39;t be expressed? Wait, how about 5, 7, 1? But 1 is invalid. 2, 5, 6: gcd(2,6)=2. 2, 3, 8: same. 3, 4, 6: same. 7, 3, 3: same. 5, 4, 4: same. So maybe 13 cannot be expressed? Hmm. Then 14?Check 14. Let&#39;s see. 2, 3, 9: sum 14. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(2,9)=1, gcd(3,9)=3. So invalid. 2, 5, 7: sum 14. Check gcds: gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(2,7)=1, gcd(5,7)=1. Yes! So 2,5,7: 2+5+7=14. Pairwise coprime. So 14 is expressible. 15: 3,4,8: gcd(4,8)=4. 3,5,7: sum 15. gcd(3,5)=1, gcd(3,7)=1, gcd(5,7)=1. Yes. So 15 can be expressed. 16: Let&#39;s see. 3,5,8: gcd(3,5)=1, gcd(3,8)=1, gcd(5,8)=1. So yes. 3+5+8=16. 17: 5,6,6: duplicates. 5, 4, 8: gcd(4,8)=4. 5, 7, 5: duplicates. 2,5,10: gcd(2,10)=2. 3,5,9: gcd(3,9)=3. 3,7,7: duplicates. 2,7,8: gcd(2,8)=2. 3, 8,6: gcd(3,6)=3. 5, 6,6: duplicates. Wait, 5, 7, 5: duplicates. 3, 4, 10: gcd(4,10)=2. 5, 5,7: duplicates. Hmm. Maybe 5, 6, 6: duplicates. Wait, how about 7, 8, 2: sum 17. gcd(2,7)=1, gcd(2,8)=2. So invalid. 3, 5, 9: gcd(3,9)=3. 7, 5, 5: duplicates. 11, 3, 3: duplicates. 2, 11, 4: sum 17. gcd(2,11)=1, gcd(2,4)=2. So invalid. 3, 11, 3: duplicates. 13, 2, 2: duplicates. Hmm. Maybe 5, 7, 5: duplicates. 7, 5, 5: same. 3, 7, 7: same. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a valid combination. Let me check 5, 6,6: duplicates. 3, 7,7: same. Wait, 7, 5, 5: same. How about 3, 5,9: gcd(3,9)=3. 3, 11,3: duplicates. Hmm. Maybe 17 can&#39;t be expressed? Wait, 2, 3, 12: sum 17. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(2,12)=2. Invalid. 2,5,10: gcd(2,10)=2. 2,7,8: gcd(2,8)=2. 3,4,10: gcd(4,10)=2. 5,7,5: duplicates. 7, 10, 0: invalid. Wait, maybe 5, 6,6: duplicates. 3, 5,9: invalid. Wait, maybe 7, 3,7: duplicates. Hmm. Maybe 17 cannot be expressed. Wait, but 17= 3+5+9. Wait, 3,5,9: gcd(3,9)=3, so invalid. 5+6+6: sum 17, but duplicates. 7+5+5: same. Hmm. Maybe 17 can&#39;t be expressed. Then 18?Check 18. Let&#39;s try 5,6,7: sum 18. Check gcds: gcd(5,6)=1, gcd(5,7)=1, gcd(6,7)=1. Yes. So 5+6+7=18. So 18 is expressible. 19: 5,7,7: duplicates. 5,6,8: gcd(5,6)=1, gcd(5,8)=1, gcd(6,8)=2. So invalid. 3,5,11: sum 19. gcd(3,5)=1, gcd(3,11)=1, gcd(5,11)=1. Yes. So 3+5+11=19. So 19 is expressible. 20: 5,7,8: sum 20. gcds: 5&amp;7=1, 5&amp;8=1, 7&amp;8=1. Yes. So 20 is expressible. 21: 5,8,8: duplicates. 5,7,9: gcd(7,9)=1, gcd(5,7)=1, gcd(5,9)=1. So 5+7+9=21. Pairwise coprime. So 21 is expressible. 22: Let&#39;s see. 5,7,10: gcd(5,7)=1, gcd(5,10)=5. Invalid. 7,8,7: duplicates. 5, 9,8: gcd(5,9)=1, gcd(5,8)=1, gcd(9,8)=1. So 5+8+9=22. Yes. 22 is expressible. 23: Let&#39;s check. 5,7,11: sum 5+7+11=23. gcds all 1. So yes. 23 is expressible. 24: 5,9,10: gcd(5,9)=1, gcd(5,10)=5. Invalid. 7,8,9: gcd(7,8)=1, gcd(7,9)=1, gcd(8,9)=1. So 7+8+9=24. Yes. 24 is expressible. 25: 7,9,9: duplicates. 5,11,9: sum 25. gcd(5,11)=1, gcd(5,9)=1, gcd(11,9)=1. So yes. 25 is expressible. 26: 7,9,10: gcd(7,9)=1, gcd(7,10)=1, gcd(9,10)=1. So 7+9+10=26. Yes. 27: 9,10,8: sum 27. gcd(9,10)=1, gcd(9,8)=1, gcd(10,8)=2. So invalid. 11,7,9: gcds all 1. 11+7+9=27. Yes. 28: 11, 8,9: sum 28. gcd(11,8)=1, gcd(11,9)=1, gcd(8,9)=1. Yes. 29: 11,9,9: duplicates. 11,7,11: duplicates. 13, 7,9: sum 29. gcds all 1. So 13+7+9=29. Yes. 30: 11,9,10: sum 30. gcd(11,9)=1, gcd(11,10)=1, gcd(9,10)=1. Yes. So 30 is expressible. So up to 30, starting from 10, most numbers can be expressed. The exceptions so far are 9, 11, 13, 17. Wait, let&#39;s check 17 again. Maybe I missed a combination. Let me try again. 17.Possible triplets: 2, 3, 12: sum 17. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(2,12)=2. Invalid. 2,5,10: gcd(2,10)=2. 2,7,8: gcd(2,8)=2. 3,4,10: gcd(4,10)=2. 3,5,9: gcd(3,9)=3. 3,7,7: duplicates. 5,6,6: duplicates. 5,5,7: duplicates. 7,5,5: same. 11,3,3: duplicates. 13,2,2: duplicates. 3, 11,3: duplicates. 5, 7,5: duplicates. 7, 7,3: same. Hmm. 3, 13,1: 1 invalid. 5, 11,1: same. 7, 9,1: same. So, maybe 17 can&#39;t be expressed. How about 17 as 3, 5, 9: sum 17. gcd(3,5)=1, gcd(3,9)=3, which is not coprime. So no. 3, 7,7: duplicates. 5, 7,5: duplicates. Hmm. Maybe there&#39;s another way. Let&#39;s try 7, 4, 6: sum 17. gcd(7,4)=1, gcd(7,6)=1, gcd(4,6)=2. So invalid. 5, 4, 8: gcd(4,8)=4. 5, 6,6: duplicates. 7, 2,8: gcd(2,8)=2. 9, 2,6: gcd(2,6)=2. 10, 3,4: gcd(3,4)=1, gcd(3,10)=1, gcd(4,10)=2. So invalid. 11, 2,4: gcd(2,4)=2. 13, 2,2: duplicates. So, seems like 17 is not expressible. So, the numbers we have so far that can&#39;t be expressed are 9, 11, 13, 17. Let&#39;s check 19, which can be expressed as 3,5,11. 20, 21, 22, etc., all can be expressed. Now, 23 can be expressed. 24,25,26,27,28,29,30. So, after 17, all numbers up to 30 can be expressed. So, if the pattern continues, then 17 might be the largest number that can&#39;t be expressed. But let&#39;s check numbers beyond 30 to see if there are any higher numbers that can&#39;t be expressed. 31: Let&#39;s see. 11,10,10: duplicates. 7,11,13: sum 31. gcds all 1. So 7+11+13=31. Yes. 32: 9,11,12: gcd(9,12)=3. 10,11,11: duplicates. 13, 8,11: gcds all 1. 13+8+11=32. Yes. 33: 11,12,10: gcd(10,12)=2. 13,10,10: duplicates. 7,11,15: gcd(7,11)=1, gcd(7,15)=1, gcd(11,15)=1. So 7+11+15=33. Yes. 34: 11,12,11: duplicates. 13,11,10: sum 34. gcds all 1. 13+11+10=34. Yes. 35: 13,11,11: duplicates. 15,10,10: duplicates. 7,13,15: gcds all 1. 7+13+15=35. Yes. 36: 11,12,13: gcds all 1? 11 and 12: gcd 1, 11 and 13: gcd 1, 12 and 13: gcd 1. Yes. So 11+12+13=36. Yes. 37: 13,12,12: duplicates. 15,11,11: duplicates. 17, 9,11: gcds all 1. 17+9+11=37. Yes. 38: 13,12,13: duplicates. 15,11,12: sum 38. gcd(15,11)=1, gcd(15,12)=3. Invalid. 17,10,11: gcds all 1. 17+10+11=38. Yes. 39: 13,14,12: sum 39. gcd(12,14)=2. 17,11,11: duplicates. 15,13,11: gcds all 1. 15+13+11=39. Yes. 40: 17,13,10: gcds all 1. 17+13+10=40. Yes. It seems like once we get past 17, all numbers can be expressed. So, the numbers that cannot be expressed are 9,11,13,17. Thus, the largest one is 17. But let&#39;s verify if 17 is indeed the maximum. Wait, let me check 17 again. If I can find a combination for 17, then maybe 17 can be expressed. Let me think again. Maybe higher numbers. For example, 2, 5, 10: sum 17. But gcd(2,10)=2. 3,5,9: gcd(3,9)=3. 5,6,6: duplicates. 7,5,5: duplicates. 7,3,7: duplicates. 11,3,3: duplicates. 13,2,2: duplicates. So, none of these work. So 17 can&#39;t be expressed. Then, since all numbers above 17 up to 40 can be expressed, and likely beyond, due to the combinations with primes and coprimes. So, 17 might be the answer. But wait, let me check 19 again. 3,5,11=19. So 19 is expressible. 20: 5,7,8=20. 21:5,7,9=21. 22:5,8,9=22. 23:5,7,11=23. 24:7,8,9=24. 25:5,9,11=25. 26:7,9,10=26. 27:7,9,11=27. 28:11,8,9=28. 29:13,7,9=29. 30:11,9,10=30. All these work. So, seems like after 17, every number can be expressed. Therefore, the largest positive integer that cannot be written as such a sum is 17. But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check numbers beyond 40. Let&#39;s take 41: 11,13,17: sum 41. gcds all 1. 11+13+17=41. 42: 13,14,15: gcd(14,15)=1, gcd(13,14)=1, gcd(13,15)=1. So yes. 43: 13,14,16: gcd(14,16)=2. 11,17,15: gcd(11,17)=1, gcd(11,15)=1, gcd(17,15)=1. 11+17+15=43. Yes. 44: 13,15,16: gcds all 1. 13+15+16=44. 45: 15,16,14: sum 45. gcd(14,15)=1, gcd(14,16)=2. Invalid. 17,13,15: gcds all 1. 17+13+15=45. Yes. 46: 17,16,13: sum 46. gcds all 1. 17+16+13=46. Yes. 47: 17,19,11: sum 47. gcds all 1. 17+19+11=47. Yes. 48: 17,19,12: gcds all 1. 17+19+12=48. Yes. 49: 19,17,13: sum 49. gcds all 1. 19+17+13=49. Yes. 50: 19,21,10: gcd(19,21)=1, gcd(19,10)=1, gcd(21,10)=1. So 19+21+10=50. Yes. So, even numbers up to 50 can be expressed. Therefore, it seems like 17 is the largest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of three pairwise coprime numbers each greater than 1. But wait, let&#39;s check if 17 can be expressed in a non-obvious way. For example, using larger primes. Let&#39;s see: 2, 3, 12: sum 17. But 2 and 12 are not coprime. 2, 7, 8: same as before. 3, 5,9: gcd(3,9)=3. 5, 7,5: duplicates. 11,3,3: duplicates. 13,2,2: duplicates. 17 can&#39;t be formed with three distinct numbers greater than 1 that are pairwise coprime. Therefore, 17 is the answer.Final Answerboxed{17}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the largest positive integer ( n ) which cannot be written as the sum of three numbers greater than 1 which are pairwise coprime, we need to check combinations of numbers and their pairwise gcds.1. Smallest possible sum: The smallest sum of three pairwise coprime numbers greater than 1 is ( 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 ).2. Checking smaller numbers:    - 9 cannot be expressed as such a sum because any combination either includes duplicates or non-coprime pairs.   - 11, 13, and 17 are also found to be non-expressible due to similar reasons.3. Verification of larger numbers:   - Numbers from 10 onwards are checked systematically. For each number, combinations of three numbers greater than 1 are tested for pairwise coprimality.   - It is found that numbers starting from 10 up to 30 (except 9, 11, 13, and 17) can be expressed as the sum of three pairwise coprime numbers.   - Beyond 17, all numbers up to 50 can be expressed using combinations such as primes and other coprime numbers.4. Conclusion: The numbers 9, 11, 13, and 17 cannot be expressed as required. The largest among these is 17, which remains non-expressible due to the inability to find three pairwise coprime numbers greater than 1 that sum to 17.Thus, the largest positive integer ( n ) which cannot be written as the sum of three numbers greater than 1 which are pairwise coprime is (boxed{17}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-1d99925a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-1d99925a><span class="icon" data-v-1d99925a>🔑:</span>1. We need to determine the largest positive integer ( n ) which cannot be written as the sum of three numbers greater than 1 that are pairwise coprime.2. Let ( n = a + b + c ) where (gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, c) = gcd(c, a) = 1). Clearly, two of ( a, b, c ) cannot be even. Therefore, if ( n ) is odd, then all of them are odd, and if ( n ) is even, two are odd while the other is even.3. Since none of ( a, b, c ) are equal and at least 1, if ( n ) is odd, ( n ) is at least ( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 ). If ( n ) is even, ( n ) is at least ( 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 ).4. If ( n ) is even and of the form ( 4k + 2 ), then ( n = 2 + (2k + 1) + (2k + 3) ) works for ( n geq 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 ). For even numbers of the form ( 4k ), ( n = 2 + (2k + 1) + (2k + 5) ) which works for ( n geq 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 ).5. We are left with odd ( n ). After checking for some values, we can see ( n = 17 ) does not have such a representation. Since ( 19 = 3 + 5 + 11 ), ( 21 = 5 + 7 + 9 ), and ( 23 = 3 + 7 + 13 ), we are done if we can prove that every odd number starting from ( 25 ) can be written as a sum of three pairwise coprime numbers.6. For any even positive integer ( n geq 8 ), ( n ) can be written as a sum of two coprime positive integers. We can just write ( n ) as ( (2k + 1) + (2k - 1) ) or ( (2k + 3) + (2k - 1) ).7. Let ( n ) be ( 2k + 1 ), so ( k geq 12 ) if ( n geq 25 ). Then ( 2k - 7 geq frac{6(k + 1)}{5} ). From Nagura&#39;s theorem, we have a prime ( p ) such that ( k + 1 leq p leq 2k - 7 = n - 8 ). Our idea is to write ( n ) as ( p + m ) where ( p &gt; m ). Obviously, ( m ) is an even positive integer, so we must write ( m ) as a sum of two coprime positive integers. This will be guaranteed if ( m geq 8 ) or ( n - p geq 8 ) or ( p leq n - 8 ) (this is the motivation behind our choice of prime earlier).8. We also need to guarantee that ( p &gt; m ), which is guaranteed by ( p geq k + 1 ). Otherwise, ( m geq p geq k + 1 ) so ( p + m geq 2k + 2 ), contradiction. Again, if ( m = a + b ) with (gcd(a, b) = 1) and ( a &gt; b ), then ( p &gt; a &gt; b ), which ensures ( a, b ) are coprime to ( p ). Thus, we have our representation.The final answer is ( boxed{ 17 } )</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-cee8cfda data-v-1d99925a><div class="review" data-v-1d99925a><div class="review-title" data-v-1d99925a><span class="icon" data-v-1d99925a>❓:</span>3.

The question is about finding the minimum degree ( n ) of a polynomial ( p(x) ) where all coefficients ( a_i ) are either 1 or -1, such that there&#39;s a root ( r ) with ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} ). First, I need to recall some concepts from polynomial root analysis. There&#39;s something called the Cauchy bound for polynomial roots, which gives an upper limit on the absolute value of the roots. The formula I remember is that all roots ( r ) of the polynomial ( p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + dots + a_0 ) satisfy:[|r| leq 1 + maxleft{ frac{|a_{n-1}|}{|a_n|}, frac{|a_{n-2}|}{|a_n|}, dots, frac{|a_0|}{|a_n|} right}]In our case, all coefficients ( a_i ) are either 1 or -1, so the maximum value among ( |a_{n-1}|, |a_{n-2}|, dots, |a_0| ) is 1. Since ( |a_n| = 1 ) as well, the Cauchy bound simplifies to:[|r| leq 1 + 1 = 2]But the problem states that ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} ), which is 1.875. So, even with the Cauchy bound, we know that roots can&#39;t exceed 2 in absolute value. However, we need a root larger than 1.875. The Cauchy bound gives 2 as the upper limit, so maybe we need to check if polynomials of lower degrees can actually achieve a root close to 2 or if higher degrees are required. Wait, but the Cauchy bound is just an upper limit. The actual maximum root might be smaller. So perhaps we need a different approach to find the minimal ( n ) such that a root exceeds 15/8. Another idea is to use the reciprocal polynomial. If ( r ) is a root of ( p(x) ), then ( 1/r ) is a root of the reciprocal polynomial ( x^n p(1/x) ). But not sure if this helps directly here.Alternatively, maybe we can use the triangle inequality or consider the polynomial evaluated at ( x = 15/8 ). If ( |p(15/8)| ) is small, then ( 15/8 ) is close to a root. But since coefficients are 1 or -1, we might need to estimate the value.Wait, actually, if ( r ) is a root of ( p(x) ), then ( p(r) = 0 ). So, ( a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + dots + a_0 = 0 ). Rearranging terms, we get:[a_n r^n = - (a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + dots + a_0)]Taking absolute values on both sides:[|a_n||r|^n = |a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + dots + a_0|]Since ( |a_n| = 1 ), this simplifies to:[|r|^n leq |a_{n-1}||r|^{n-1} + dots + |a_0|]But each ( |a_i| = 1 ), so:[|r|^n leq |r|^{n-1} + |r|^{n-2} + dots + 1]This is a geometric series. The sum on the right is ( frac{|r|^n - 1}{|r| - 1} ) if ( |r| neq 1 ). So substituting:[|r|^n leq frac{|r|^n - 1}{|r| - 1}]Multiplying both sides by ( |r| - 1 ):Left side: ( |r|^{n+1} - |r|^n )Right side: ( |r|^n - 1 )Bring all terms to left:( |r|^{n+1} - |r|^n - |r|^n + 1 geq 0 )Simplify:( |r|^{n+1} - 2|r|^n + 1 geq 0 )Factor:( |r|^n (|r| - 2) + 1 geq 0 )Hmm, since ( |r| &gt; 15/8 ) and we want this inequality to hold. Let&#39;s denote ( |r| = c ), so ( c &gt; 15/8 approx 1.875 ). Then the inequality becomes:( c^n (c - 2) + 1 geq 0 )But ( c - 2 ) is negative because ( c &lt; 2 ), so ( c^n (c - 2) ) is negative. Therefore, we have:( 1 geq c^n (2 - c) )So, ( c^n (2 - c) leq 1 )We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that this inequality holds for some ( c &gt; 15/8 ). But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe we can set ( c = 15/8 ) and find ( n ) such that ( (15/8)^n (2 - 15/8) leq 1 ). Let&#39;s compute:( 2 - 15/8 = 16/8 - 15/8 = 1/8 )So, the inequality becomes:( (15/8)^n * (1/8) leq 1 )Multiply both sides by 8:( (15/8)^n leq 8 )Take natural logarithm on both sides:( n ln(15/8) leq ln 8 )Thus,( n leq ln 8 / ln(15/8) )Calculating the numerical value:( ln 8 ≈ 2.079 )( ln(15/8) ≈ ln 1.875 ≈ 0.6286 )So,( n ≤ 2.079 / 0.6286 ≈ 3.307 )So, ( n ) needs to be at least 4. But wait, this was when setting ( c = 15/8 ). However, our root ( r ) has ( |r| &gt; 15/8 ). So actually, if we take ( c ) slightly larger than 15/8, the required ( n ) would be slightly higher. But since ( n ) must be integer, maybe n=4 is possible?But this approach seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. The inequality ( c^n (2 - c) leq 1 ) is necessary for the existence of a root with ( |r| = c ). But perhaps this is a bound derived from the triangle inequality, so it&#39;s a necessary condition but not sufficient. So even if this inequality holds, it doesn&#39;t guarantee that such a root exists, but if it&#39;s violated, then such a root cannot exist.Therefore, if ( c &gt; 15/8 ), then for the root to exist, we must have ( c^n (2 - c) leq 1 ). So, solving for ( c ), given ( n ), the maximum possible ( c ) is such that ( c^n (2 - c) = 1 ).Therefore, to find the minimal ( n ) such that there exists a ( c &gt; 15/8 ) satisfying ( c^n (2 - c) leq 1 ).Alternatively, maybe for each ( n ), compute the maximum possible ( c ) such that ( c^n (2 - c) = 1 ), and check if that maximum ( c ) is greater than 15/8.Alternatively, since we need to find the minimal ( n ) where such a root exists, perhaps we can check polynomials of low degrees (starting from n=1 upwards) and see if any of them can have a root exceeding 15/8.For n=1: The polynomial is a_1 x + a_0. Roots are -a_0/a_1. Since a_1 and a_0 are ±1, the root is either 1 or -1. So |r|=1 &lt; 15/8. So n=1 is impossible.n=2: Quadratic equation. Let&#39;s consider p(x) = x² + a x + b, where a, b ∈ {1, -1}. Let&#39;s try to find roots. The roots are given by [-a ± sqrt(a² - 4b)] / 2.Compute discriminant: a² - 4b. Since a² is 1, discriminant is 1 - 4b. If b=1, discriminant is 1 - 4 = -3: complex roots. If b=-1, discriminant is 1 +4 = 5. So real roots. Then roots are [-a ± sqrt(5)]/2. The maximum absolute value would be when we take the &#39;+&#39; sign and a=-1: [1 + sqrt(5)]/2 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.618, which is less than 15/8=1.875. Alternatively, if a=1, roots are [-1 ± sqrt(5)]/2. The positive root is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ ( -1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.618. So even the largest root for quadratics is ≈1.618 &lt;1.875. So n=2 is not possible.n=3: Cubic polynomials. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s consider the cubic polynomial p(x) = x³ + a x² + b x + c, with a, b, c ∈ {1, -1}. We need to check if such a polynomial can have a root with |r| &gt;15/8.But checking all possible 2^3=8 polynomials might be tedious, but perhaps we can find the maximum root modulus for cubics with coefficients ±1.Alternatively, maybe using bounds. The Cauchy bound is 2, as before, but maybe a better bound exists.Alternatively, consider the case where the polynomial is reciprocal, but not sure. Alternatively, use the upper bound formula for roots. There&#39;s also the Fujiwara bound, which states that all roots z satisfy |z| ≤ 2 max{ |a_{n-1}/a_n|, sqrt(|a_{n-2}/a_n|), ..., sqrt[n](|a_0/a_n|) } }But for our polynomial, all coefficients are ±1, so Fujiwara bound would be 2 max{1, 1, ..., 1} = 2. Same as Cauchy.Alternatively, perhaps using the test value 15/8. Let&#39;s evaluate |p(15/8)| and see if it can be zero or close to zero.But since p(15/8) = (15/8)^3 + a(15/8)^2 + b(15/8) + c. Let&#39;s compute the absolute value:(15/8)^3 ≈ 3.372, (15/8)^2 ≈ 3.516, 15/8 ≈1.875. So, the terms are approximately 3.372, ±3.516, ±1.875, ±1. So when adding up with different signs, maybe we can get cancellation?For example, suppose we take p(x) = x³ - x² - x -1. Let&#39;s compute p(15/8):(15/8)^3 - (15/8)^2 - (15/8) -1 ≈ 3.372 - 3.516 -1.875 -1 ≈ 3.372 - 6.391 ≈ -3.019. Not zero.Alternatively, p(x) = x³ - x² + x -1. Then p(15/8) ≈3.372 -3.516 +1.875 -1 ≈3.372 +1.875 -4.516 ≈5.247 -4.516≈0.731. Closer to zero, but still positive. Maybe with different signs?Alternatively, p(x)=x³ +x² -x -1. Let&#39;s compute:3.372 +3.516 -1.875 -1 ≈6.888 -2.875≈4.013. Not zero.Alternatively, p(x)=x³ -x² -x +1. Then p(15/8)=3.372 -3.516 -1.875 +1≈3.372 -5.391 +1≈-1.019.Alternatively, p(x)=x³ +x² +x +1. Then p(15/8)=3.372 +3.516 +1.875 +1≈9.763. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe mix signs differently. How about p(x)=x³ -x² +x +1. Then p(15/8)=3.372 -3.516 +1.875 +1≈3.372 +1.875 +1 -3.516≈6.247 -3.516≈2.731. Still positive.Alternatively, p(x)=x³ +x² -x +1. Then p(15/8)=3.372 +3.516 -1.875 +1≈3.372 +3.516 +1 -1.875≈7.888 -1.875≈6.013.Hmm, seems like all these combinations evaluated at 15/8 give values that are not zero and sometimes even large. Maybe cubic polynomials with coefficients ±1 don&#39;t have roots exceeding 15/8. Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a clever combination.Alternatively, suppose we take p(x)=x³ -x² -x -1. Let&#39;s check the actual roots. Maybe using rational root theorem: possible rational roots are ±1. Testing x=1: 1 -1 -1 -1= -2. x=-1: -1 -1 +1 -1= -2. So no rational roots. Therefore, the roots are irrational. Let&#39;s approximate.Let me try to find the real root of p(x)=x³ -x² -x -1. Let&#39;s compute p(1.5): 3.375 -2.25 -1.5 -1= -1.375. p(2):8 -4 -2 -1=1. So there&#39;s a root between 1.5 and 2. Similarly, p(1.8): (1.8)^3 - (1.8)^2 -1.8 -1 ≈5.832 -3.24 -1.8 -1=5.832 -6.04≈-0.208. p(1.85): ≈(1.85)^3 - (1.85)^2 -1.85 -1≈6.329 -3.4225 -1.85 -1≈6.329 -6.2725≈0.0565. So the root is between 1.8 and 1.85. So approximately 1.83. But 15/8=1.875. So the root is around 1.83 &lt;1.875. So even the real root here is less than 15/8. So maybe cubic polynomials can&#39;t have roots exceeding 15/8. Hence, n=3 is insufficient.Moving on to n=4. Let&#39;s see if quartic polynomials can have roots beyond 15/8.Again, maybe trying specific examples. Let&#39;s consider the polynomial p(x)=x⁴ -x³ -x² -x -1. Let&#39;s compute its value at 15/8≈1.875.Compute (15/8)^4 - (15/8)^3 - (15/8)^2 - (15/8) -1.Calculate each term:(15/8)^4 = (50625)/(4096) ≈12.36(15/8)^3 ≈3.372 (as before)(15/8)^2≈3.51615/8≈1.875So, p(15/8)≈12.36 -3.372 -3.516 -1.875 -1≈12.36 -10.763≈1.597. Positive.Alternatively, maybe another polynomial. How about p(x)=x⁴ -x³ -x² +x -1. Let&#39;s compute at 15/8≈1.875:12.36 -3.372 -3.516 +1.875 -1≈12.36 -3.372=9.0; 9.0 -3.516=5.484; 5.484 +1.875=7.359; 7.359 -1=6.359. Still positive.Alternatively, p(x)=x⁴ +x³ -x² -x -1. At 15/8:12.36 +3.372 -3.516 -1.875 -1≈12.36 +3.372=15.732; 15.732 -3.516=12.216; 12.216 -1.875=10.341; 10.341 -1=9.341. Positive.Alternatively, p(x)=x⁴ -x³ +x² -x -1. Compute at 15/8:12.36 -3.372 +3.516 -1.875 -1≈12.36 -3.372=8.988; 8.988 +3.516=12.504; 12.504 -1.875=10.629; 10.629 -1=9.629. Still positive.Hmm, maybe this approach isn&#39;t working. Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a known quartic polynomial with coefficients ±1 that has a root larger than 15/8. Alternatively, let&#39;s try to analyze the inequality.Earlier, we had the inequality for the root:( |r|^n leq |r|^{n-1} + |r|^{n-2} + dots + 1 )Which can be rewritten as:( |r|^n leq frac{|r|^n - 1}{|r| - 1} ) (sum of geometric series)But rearranged, this gives:( |r|^{n+1} - 2|r|^n + 1 geq 0 )Wait, earlier steps led to:( |r|^{n+1} - 2|r|^n + 1 geq 0 )Let me check that again. Starting with:Taking absolute values of p(r) = 0 gives:( |r|^n leq |r|^{n-1} + ... + 1 )Which is:( |r|^n leq frac{|r|^n - 1}{|r| - 1} )Multiply both sides by |r| -1 (assuming |r| &gt;1):( |r|^{n+1} - |r|^n leq |r|^n -1 )Then bring all terms to left:( |r|^{n+1} -2|r|^n +1 leq 0 )Wait, so the inequality is reversed. Wait, that&#39;s confusing. Let&#39;s re-examine.Original equation:From p(r)=0, we have:( a_n r^n = - (a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + ... + a_0) )Taking absolute values:( |r|^n = |a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + ... + a_0| leq |r|^{n-1} + ... + 1 )Hence,( |r|^n leq sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |r|^k )Which is the sum of a geometric series:If |r| ≠1, sum is ( frac{|r|^n -1}{|r| -1} )Thus,( |r|^n leq frac{|r|^n -1}{|r| -1} )Multiply both sides by |r| -1 (positive since |r| &gt;1):( |r|^{n+1} - |r|^n leq |r|^n -1 )Bring all terms to left:( |r|^{n+1} - 2|r|^n +1 leq 0 )So the inequality is:( |r|^{n+1} - 2|r|^n +1 leq 0 )Let me factor this:( |r|^n (|r| - 2) +1 leq 0 )So,( |r|^n (|r| - 2) leq -1 )Which is equivalent to:( |r|^n (2 - |r|) geq 1 )Since (|r| - 2) is negative (because |r| &lt;2), so multiplying by -1 flips the inequality.Thus, the condition becomes:( |r|^n (2 - |r|) geq 1 )Given that |r| &gt;15/8 ≈1.875, we can denote c = |r|, so 15/8 &lt;c &lt;2.We need to find the minimal n such that there exists c in (15/8, 2) satisfying ( c^n (2 - c) geq 1 ).So for each n, we can check if the maximum value of the function f(c) = c^n (2 - c) over c ∈ (15/8, 2) is at least 1.To find the maximum of f(c), take derivative:f&#39;(c) = n c^{n-1} (2 - c) - c^n = c^{n-1} [n(2 - c) - c] = c^{n-1} [2n - (n +1)c]Set f&#39;(c)=0:2n - (n +1)c =0 ⇒ c = 2n/(n+1)So the maximum occurs at c=2n/(n+1). But we need c &gt;15/8.So, 2n/(n+1) &gt;15/8Solve for n:Multiply both sides by 8(n+1):16n &gt;15(n +1)16n &gt;15n +15n &gt;15Thus, if n &gt;15, then the critical point c=2n/(n+1) is greater than 15/8. Wait, but if n ≤15, then the critical point is less than 15/8. So for n ≤15, the maximum of f(c) on [15/8, 2) occurs at c=15/8.Wait, let&#39;s check for n=15:c=2*15/(15+1)=30/16=15/8=1.875. So for n=15, the critical point is exactly at 15/8. For n&gt;15, the critical point c=2n/(n+1) &gt;15/8.Hence, for n ≤15, the maximum of f(c) on [15/8, 2) is at c=2, but as c approaches 2 from the left, f(c) approaches 2^n *0=0. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, actually, if the critical point is at c=2n/(n+1). For n=15, c=30/16=15/8. So for n&gt;15, c=2n/(n+1) &gt;15/8. Therefore, for n&gt;15, the maximum of f(c) in [15/8, 2) is at c=2n/(n+1). For n&lt;=15, the maximum in [15/8, 2) is at c=15/8 since the critical point is less than 15/8.Therefore, for n&lt;=15, maximum f(c)=f(15/8)=(15/8)^n*(2 -15/8)= (15/8)^n*(1/8)So for n&lt;=15, the maximum is (15/8)^n*(1/8). For n&gt;15, the maximum is f(2n/(n+1))=(2n/(n+1))^n*(2 -2n/(n+1))=(2n/(n+1))^n*(2(n+1)-2n)/(n+1))=(2n/(n+1))^n*(2/(n+1))So, to have f(c)&gt;=1, for n&lt;=15, need (15/8)^n*(1/8)&gt;=1, which is equivalent to (15/8)^n &gt;=8. Take natural logs:n ln(15/8)&gt;=ln8n&gt;= ln8 / ln(15/8)≈2.079/0.628≈3.307. So n&gt;=4. But for n&lt;=15, the maximum f(c) is achieved at c=15/8, but since we need c&gt;15/8, then for n&lt;=15, the maximum over c&gt;15/8 would be approaching c=15/8 from the right, but since at c=15/8, f(c)= (15/8)^n*(1/8). However, for c&gt;15/8, if n&lt;=15, then the function f(c) is decreasing on (15/8, 2) because the critical point is at c=2n/(n+1)&lt;=15/8. Hence, for n&lt;=15, f(c) is decreasing on (15/8, 2). Therefore, the maximum on [15/8, 2) is at c=15/8, but since we need c&gt;15/8, then actually f(c) &lt; f(15/8) for c&gt;15/8. Therefore, for n&lt;=15, f(c) &lt; (15/8)^n*(1/8). Therefore, if we want f(c)&gt;=1, since f(c) &lt; (15/8)^n*(1/8), then we need (15/8)^n*(1/8)&gt;=1, which is same as n &gt;= ln(8)/ln(15/8)≈3.307. So n&gt;=4. But since for n&lt;=15, even the maximum at c=15/8 is (15/8)^n*(1/8), which for n=4 is (15/8)^4*(1/8)≈(50625/4096)*(1/8)≈50625/32768≈1.546. So 1.546&gt;1. So for n=4, f(c=15/8)=~1.546, but since for c&gt;15/8, f(c) is decreasing, so f(c) &lt;1.546. However, to have f(c)&gt;=1, since f(c) approaches 0 as c approaches 2, then there exists some c&gt;15/8 where f(c)=1. So even though the maximum is at c=15/8 with f(c)=1.546, which is greater than 1, then as c increases beyond 15/8, f(c) decreases from 1.546 to 0. Therefore, there must be a c&gt;15/8 where f(c)=1. Therefore, for n=4, there exists c&gt;15/8 such that f(c)=1. Therefore, the inequality c^n(2 -c)=1 is achievable for c&gt;15/8 when n=4.Wait, but this is conflicting with the previous analysis where for n=4, the maximum at c=15/8 is ~1.546, which is greater than 1, so by intermediate value theorem, since f(c) is continuous and decreasing from 1.546 to 0 as c goes from 15/8 to 2, there exists a unique c in (15/8, 2) where f(c)=1. Therefore, such a c exists for n=4. But does that mean that there exists a polynomial of degree 4 with coefficients ±1 having a root at c? Not necessarily. Because the condition f(c)=c^n(2 -c)=1 is derived from the triangle inequality, which is a necessary condition but not sufficient. So even if this condition is satisfied, it doesn&#39;t guarantee that such a polynomial exists. Therefore, we might need a higher n.Wait, but the question is asking for the minimal n such that there exists a polynomial of degree n with coefficients ±1 having a root with |r|&gt;15/8. So even if for n=4 the necessary condition is satisfied, we need to check if such a polynomial actually exists.Alternatively, perhaps there exists a polynomial of degree 4 with coefficients ±1 that has a root exceeding 15/8. Let&#39;s try to find one.Alternatively, maybe consider the polynomial x^4 -x^3 -x^2 -x -1. Let&#39;s compute its roots.Using the rational root theorem, possible roots are ±1. Testing x=1:1 -1 -1 -1 -1= -3. x=-1:1 +1 -1 +1 -1=1. So no rational roots. Maybe it has real roots. Let&#39;s check p(1.8):(1.8)^4 - (1.8)^3 - (1.8)^2 -1.8 -1≈ 10.4976 - 5.832 - 3.24 -1.8 -1≈10.4976 -11.872≈-1.3744.p(2):16 -8 -4 -2 -1=1. So there&#39;s a root between 1.8 and 2. Let&#39;s check p(1.9):1.9^4≈13.0321, 1.9^3≈6.859, 1.9^2≈3.61. So p(1.9)=13.0321 -6.859 -3.61 -1.9 -1≈13.0321 -13.369≈-0.3369.p(1.95):1.95^4≈(2 -0.05)^4≈16 -4*8*0.05 +6*16*0.0025 -4*8*0.000125 +0.00000625≈16 -1.6 +0.24 -0.004 +0.00000625≈14.636. Wait, actual calculation:1.95^4 = (1.95)^2 * (1.95)^2. (1.95)^2=3.8025. Then 3.8025^2≈14.465. Similarly, 1.95^3=1.95*3.8025≈7.414875. So p(1.95)=14.465 -7.414875 -3.8025 -1.95 -1≈14.465 -14.167375≈0.2976.So p(1.95)≈0.2976. Therefore, the root is between 1.9 and 1.95. Let&#39;s try 1.925:Compute p(1.925):1.925^4 ≈ (1.925^2)^2. 1.925^2=3.705625. Then 3.705625^2≈13.73. 1.925^3≈1.925*3.705625≈7.133.So p(1.925)=13.73 -7.133 -3.7056 -1.925 -1≈13.73 -13.7636≈-0.0336.p(1.93):1.93^4: 1.93^2≈3.7249; then 3.7249^2≈13.873. 1.93^3≈1.93*3.7249≈7.186.p(1.93)=13.873 -7.186 -3.7249 -1.93 -1≈13.873 -14.8409≈-0.9679. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, perhaps my approximations are off.Alternatively, let&#39;s use linear approximation between 1.925 and 1.95.At 1.925: p≈-0.0336At 1.95: p≈0.2976The difference in x:0.025, difference in p:0.3312. We need to find x where p=0. So, slope≈0.3312/0.025≈13.248 per unit x. To go from -0.0336 to 0, need delta x≈0.0336/13.248≈0.0025. So approximate root at 1.925 +0.0025≈1.9275.So the root is approximately 1.928, which is ~1.928&gt;15/8=1.875. Therefore, the polynomial x⁴ -x³ -x² -x -1 has a real root at approximately 1.928&gt;15/8. Therefore, this polynomial satisfies the condition, and n=4 is possible.Therefore, the minimal possible n is 4.But wait, let&#39;s confirm that all coefficients are indeed ±1. The polynomial is x⁴ -x³ -x² -x -1. Coefficients are 1, -1, -1, -1, -1. Yes, all coefficients are ±1. Hence, this polynomial meets the criteria, and has a root at approximately 1.928&gt;15/8=1.875. Therefore, n=4 is achievable.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there exists a polynomial of degree n=4 with a root exceeding 15/8, which this example shows. Hence, the minimal n is 4.Final AnswerThe minimum possible value of ( n ) is boxed{4}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the minimum degree ( n ) of a polynomial ( p(x) ) with coefficients ( a_i ) either 1 or -1 such that there exists a root ( r ) with ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} ), we start by analyzing the necessary conditions for such a root.Using the Cauchy bound, we know that all roots ( r ) of ( p(x) ) satisfy ( |r| leq 2 ). However, we need a root ( r ) such that ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} approx 1.875 ).We derived the inequality for the root ( r ):[|r|^n (2 - |r|) geq 1]where ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} ). For ( n = 4 ), we check if there exists a polynomial of degree 4 with coefficients ±1 that has a root exceeding ( frac{15}{8} ).Considering the polynomial ( p(x) = x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 ), we approximate its roots. Using numerical methods, we find that this polynomial has a real root approximately at 1.928, which is greater than ( frac{15}{8} = 1.875 ).Thus, the polynomial ( p(x) = x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 ) with coefficients ±1 has a root exceeding ( frac{15}{8} ), confirming that the minimum degree ( n ) is 4.[boxed{4}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is: Given a polynomial ( p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ldots + a_0 ), where each coefficient ( a_i ) is either 1 or -1. If ( r ) is a root of ( p ) with ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} ), what&#39;s the minimum possible value of ( n )?First, I need to recall some relevant theorems or principles that relate the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients. The one that comes to mind is the Cauchy bound for roots, which gives an upper bound on the absolute value of the roots. The formula for the Cauchy bound is ( 1 + maxleft{ frac{|a_{n-1}|}{|a_n|}, ldots, frac{|a_0|}{|a_n|} right} ). Since all coefficients here are either 1 or -1, their absolute values are 1. So, the Cauchy bound would be ( 1 + 1 = 2 ). But in this problem, the root ( r ) has ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} approx 1.875 ), which is less than 2. So, the Cauchy bound tells us that there could be roots up to 2, but we need a tighter bound here.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the reciprocal polynomial or use some inequalities involving the roots. Another idea is to use the triangle inequality. If ( |r| &gt; 1 ), we can write the polynomial equation ( a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + ldots + a_0 = 0 ). Rearranging terms, ( a_n r^n = - (a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + ldots + a_0) ). Taking absolute values on both sides, ( |a_n||r|^n = |a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + ldots + a_0| ). Since each ( |a_i| = 1 ), this simplifies to ( |r|^n = |a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + ldots + a_0| ).By the triangle inequality, the right-hand side is at most ( |a_{n-1}||r|^{n-1} + ldots + |a_0| = |r|^{n-1} + |r|^{n-2} + ldots + 1 ). So, we have ( |r|^n leq sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |r|^k ). Let me write that as ( |r|^n leq frac{|r|^n - 1}{|r| - 1} ) if ( |r| neq 1 ). Wait, the sum of a geometric series: ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |r|^k = frac{|r|^n - 1}{|r| - 1} ). Therefore, substituting that in, we get:( |r|^n leq frac{|r|^n - 1}{|r| - 1} )Multiply both sides by ( |r| - 1 ). Since ( |r| &gt; 1 ), ( |r| - 1 ) is positive, so the inequality direction remains the same:( |r|^n (|r| - 1) leq |r|^n - 1 )Expanding the left side:( |r|^{n+1} - |r|^n leq |r|^n - 1 )Bring all terms to the left:( |r|^{n+1} - |r|^n - |r|^n + 1 leq 0 )Simplify:( |r|^{n+1} - 2|r|^n + 1 leq 0 )Factor:Hmm, maybe factor ( |r|^n ):( |r|^n (|r| - 2) + 1 leq 0 )But since ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} approx 1.875 ), then ( |r| - 2 ) is negative. Let&#39;s denote ( |r| = R ), so the inequality becomes:( R^{n} (R - 2) + 1 leq 0 )Or,( R^{n} (2 - R) geq 1 )So we have ( R^n (2 - R) geq 1 ), where ( R &gt; frac{15}{8} ).We need to find the minimal ( n ) such that this inequality holds for some ( R &gt; 15/8 ). But since ( R ) is a root of the polynomial with coefficients ±1, this must be possible.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s think about specific polynomials with coefficients ±1 and see what roots they can have.Another idea: consider the reciprocal polynomial. If ( r ) is a root, then ( 1/r ) is a root of the reciprocal polynomial. But since all coefficients are ±1, the reciprocal polynomial is just the reversed polynomial. However, if ( |r| &gt; 1 ), then ( |1/r| &lt; 1 ). Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, consider the maximum modulus of a root for such polynomials. Since all coefficients are bounded (they are ±1), there&#39;s a limit to how large the roots can be. The problem states that there exists a root with |r| &gt; 15/8, so we need the minimal degree n where such a polynomial can have a root exceeding 15/8.Alternatively, maybe we can construct such a polynomial and check for its roots. For example, take a polynomial with alternating signs, like ( x^n - x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} - ldots pm 1 ). But not sure if that&#39;s the case.Wait, perhaps using the notion of dominant root. For large enough n, the polynomial might behave like its leading term, but with coefficients ±1, the roots might not necessarily be too large. Alternatively, maybe considering the Mahler measure, which is the product of the absolute values of the roots. But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s helpful here.Alternatively, use the Fujiwara bound on roots, which states that all roots z of the polynomial satisfy:( |z| leq 2 max left{ left| frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} right|, left| frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n} right|^{1/2}, ldots, left| frac{a_0}{a_n} right|^{1/n} right} )Since all coefficients are ±1, this becomes:( |z| leq 2 max {1, 1^{1/2}, ldots, 1^{1/n} } = 2 )But again, 15/8 is less than 2, so this doesn&#39;t directly help.Maybe consider specific polynomials of low degree and see if they can have roots exceeding 15/8. Let&#39;s check for n=1: p(x) = a1 x + a0. The root is -a0/a1. Since a1 and a0 are ±1, the root is either 1 or -1. So |r|=1, which is less than 15/8. So n=1 is impossible.n=2: Quadratic equation. Let&#39;s take p(x) = x^2 + a x + b, where a, b ∈ {1, -1}. Let&#39;s compute the roots. The roots are [-a ± sqrt(a² - 4b)] / 2. The discriminant is a² - 4b. Since a²=1, discriminant is 1 - 4b. If b=1, discriminant is -3, complex roots with |r|=sqrt(b/a_n) = sqrt(1/1)=1. If b=-1, discriminant is 1 - (-4)=5. So roots are [-a ± sqrt(5)] / 2. Let&#39;s take a=1: roots are [-1 ± sqrt(5)] / 2. The positive root is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.618. The negative root is (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ -1.618. The absolute value is 1.618, which is approximately the golden ratio. 1.618 is about 1.618, which is greater than 15/8=1.875? Wait, 15/8 is 1.875. So 1.618 is less than 1.875. So even the quadratic with a=-1 and b=-1 would have roots with absolute value ≈1.618, which is less than 15/8. So n=2 is insufficient.n=3: Let&#39;s check cubic polynomials. Let&#39;s try to construct a cubic polynomial with coefficients ±1 that has a root larger than 15/8. Maybe take p(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x -1. Let&#39;s check its roots. Maybe using rational root theorem: possible rational roots are ±1. Testing x=1: 1 -1 -1 -1 = -2 ≠0. x=-1: -1 -1 +1 -1 = -2 ≠0. So no rational roots. Let&#39;s approximate the real root. For large x, p(x) ≈ x^3, which is positive. At x=1: p(1)= -2. At x=2: p(2)=8 -4 -2 -1=1. So there is a root between 1 and 2. Let&#39;s use Newton-Raphson to approximate. Let&#39;s start with x=1.5: p(1.5)=3.375 - 2.25 -1.5 -1= -1.375. x=1.75: p(1.75)=5.359 - 3.0625 -1.75 -1≈ -0.453. x=1.875: p(1.875)= (1.875)^3 - (1.875)^2 -1.875 -1. Let&#39;s compute:1.875^3 = (15/8)^3 = 3375/512 ≈6.59181.875^2 = 225/64 ≈3.5156So p(1.875) ≈6.5918 -3.5156 -1.875 -1≈6.5918 -6.3906≈0.2012. So p(1.875)≈0.2012. So there&#39;s a root between 1.75 and 1.875 because p(1.75)≈-0.453 and p(1.875)≈0.2012. Using linear approximation: The difference in x is 0.125, difference in p(x) is 0.2012 - (-0.453)=0.6542. To reach zero from -0.453, need 0.453/0.6542 ≈0.6925 of the interval. So approximate root at 1.75 + 0.125*0.6925≈1.75 +0.0866≈1.8366. So approximately 1.837, which is about 1.837, which is less than 15/8=1.875. So this cubic has a root around 1.837, which is still less than 1.875.Alternatively, perhaps another cubic polynomial. Let&#39;s try x^3 -x^2 +x -1. Testing x=1:1 -1 +1 -1=0. So x=1 is a root. Then factor it as (x-1)(x^2 +0x +1). So other roots are ±i. So absolute value of roots is 1 or 1, which is not helpful.Another cubic: x^3 +x^2 -x -1. Testing x=1:1+1-1-1=0. So x=1 is a root. Factor: (x-1)(x^2 + 2x +1)= (x-1)(x+1)^2. Roots are 1 and -1 (double root). Absolute values 1.Another cubic: x^3 +x^2 +x +1. Roots are complex, and for modulus, maybe 1 again? Let&#39;s check. The roots are -1, and complex numbers. Wait, no. x^3 +x^2 +x +1 = (x^3 +x^2) + (x +1)=x^2(x+1) + (x+1)= (x+1)(x^2 +1). So roots are -1, i, -i. So |roots|=1 or 1. Not helpful.Another cubic: x^3 -x^2 +x +1. Let&#39;s check for real roots. At x approaching infinity, it&#39;s positive. At x= -1: -1 -1 -1 +1= -2. At x=0: 1. At x=1:1 -1 +1 +1=2. So sign changes between -1 and 0, and between 0 and 1? Wait, x=0 gives 1. So between -1 and 0, goes from -2 to 1, so crosses there. Between 0 and 1, it goes from 1 to 2, no crossing. Between 1 and infinity, stays positive. So only one real root near -1. Let&#39;s approximate it. At x=-1: -2. At x=-0.5: (-0.125) -0.25 + (-0.5) +1=0.125. So root between -1 and -0.5. The absolute value would be between 0.5 and 1, which is less than 15/8.Hmm, so maybe the cubic polynomial can&#39;t have roots with |r|&gt;15/8. Let&#39;s check another cubic: x^3 -x^2 -x +1. Testing x=1:1 -1 -1 +1=0. So x=1 is a root. Factor: (x-1)(x^2 -0x -1). So roots are 1 and (0 ±sqrt(0 +4))/2= ±1. So roots at 1,1,-1. Absolute values 1. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe the cubic with all coefficients negative: -x^3 -x^2 -x -1. But multiplying by -1 gives x^3 +x^2 +x +1, which we already saw has roots -1, i, -i. So same modulus.Alternatively, perhaps try a different combination. How about x^3 +x^2 -x -1. Wait, we did that earlier. It factors as (x-1)(x+1)^2, so roots at 1 and -1. Absolute values 1.Hmm. Maybe cubics can&#39;t reach 15/8. Let&#39;s check n=4. Let&#39;s consider quartic polynomials. Let&#39;s try to construct a quartic polynomial with coefficients ±1 that might have a root larger than 15/8.Take the polynomial p(x)=x^4 -x^3 -x^2 -x -1. Let&#39;s check for positive real roots. Using Descartes&#39; Rule of Signs: coefficients are +1, -1, -1, -1, -1. So 1 sign change, so there is exactly 1 positive real root. Let&#39;s approximate it. At x=1:1 -1 -1 -1 -1=-3. At x=2:16 -8 -4 -2 -1=1. So there is a root between 1 and 2. Let&#39;s check at x=1.5:1.5^4 -1.5^3 -1.5^2 -1.5 -1 =5.0625 -3.375 -2.25 -1.5 -1=5.0625 -8.125= -3.0625. Still negative.x=1.75:1.75^4 ≈9.3789; 1.75^3≈5.3594; 1.75^2≈3.0625So p(1.75)=9.3789 -5.3594 -3.0625 -1.75 -1≈9.3789 -11.1729≈-1.794. Still negative.x=1.875:(15/8)^4 = (50625)/(4096)≈12.36(15/8)^3≈3.052(15/8)^2≈3.5156So p(15/8)=12.36 -3.052 -3.5156 -15/8 -1.Wait, compute each term:x^4: (15/8)^4 = 50625/4096 ≈12.3623x^3: (15/8)^3 = 3375/512 ≈6.5918x^2: (15/8)^2 =225/64≈3.5156x:15/8=1.875So p(15/8)=12.3623 -6.5918 -3.5156 -1.875 -1≈12.3623 -13.9824≈-1.6201. Still negative.x=2: p(2)=16 -8 -4 -2 -1=1. So the root is between 1.875 and 2. Let&#39;s compute at x=1.9375 (15.5/8):But this might take too long. Alternatively, since the polynomial is x^4 -x^3 -x^2 -x -1, let&#39;s use Newton-Raphson starting at x=2:f(2)=1f’(x)=4x^3 -3x^2 -2x -1f’(2)=32 -12 -4 -1=15Next approximation: 2 - f(2)/f’(2)=2 -1/15≈1.9333Compute f(1.9333):x^4≈(1.9333)^4≈(1.9333^2)^2≈(3.737)^2≈13.96x^3≈(1.9333)^3≈7.22x^2≈3.737x≈1.9333So f(x)=13.96 -7.22 -3.737 -1.9333 -1≈13.96 -14.89≈-0.93f’(x)=4*(7.22) -3*(3.737) -2*(1.9333) -1≈28.88 -11.21 -3.8666 -1≈12.8034Next approximation:1.9333 - (-0.93)/12.8034≈1.9333 +0.0726≈2.0059Wait, that&#39;s moving back towards 2. Hmm. Maybe this isn&#39;t the best approach. Alternatively, since the root is between 1.875 and 2, let&#39;s estimate it. Maybe linear approximation between x=1.875 and x=2. At x=1.875, f(x)=≈-1.62, at x=2, f(x)=1. The slope is (1 - (-1.62))/(2 -1.875)=2.62/0.125≈20.96. To reach zero from x=1.875: need 1.62/20.96≈0.077. So approximate root at 1.875 +0.077≈1.952. So approximately 1.952, which is about 1.952, which is greater than 15/8=1.875. So this quartic polynomial has a root around 1.95, which is greater than 15/8. So n=4 is possible? Wait, but wait, does this polynomial have coefficients only ±1? Let&#39;s check: p(x)=x^4 -x^3 -x^2 -x -1. Yes, all coefficients are 1 or -1. So this is a valid polynomial for the problem. Therefore, with n=4, there exists a polynomial with coefficients ±1 that has a root with |r|≈1.95&gt;15/8≈1.875. Therefore, the minimal n is 4? But wait, the question says &quot;the minimum possible value of n&quot;. Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a lower n. Wait, earlier for n=3, we found a root around 1.837, which is less than 15/8=1.875. So n=3 is insufficient. For n=4, we can have such a root. Therefore, the minimal n is 4.But let me confirm that the root of p(x)=x^4 -x^3 -x^2 -x -1 is indeed greater than 15/8. Since we approximated it to be around 1.95, which is greater than 1.875, that seems correct. Alternatively, let&#39;s compute p(15/8):Compute p(15/8)= (15/8)^4 - (15/8)^3 - (15/8)^2 - (15/8) -1.Calculate each term:(15/8)^2 = 225/64 = 3.515625(15/8)^3 = (225/64)*(15/8) = 3375/512 ≈6.591796875(15/8)^4 = (3375/512)*(15/8) = 50625/4096 ≈12.3623046875So p(15/8)=12.3623046875 -6.591796875 -3.515625 -1.875 -1Calculate step by step:12.3623046875 -6.591796875 =5.77050781255.7705078125 -3.515625 =2.25488281252.2548828125 -1.875 =0.37988281250.3798828125 -1 = -0.6201171875So p(15/8)= -0.6201... &lt;0. Then at x=2, p(2)=1&gt;0. Therefore, there is a root between 15/8 and 2. So the root r satisfies 15/8 &lt; r &lt;2. Therefore, |r|&gt;15/8. Hence, n=4 is possible.But wait, is there a quartic with a root greater than 15/8, or is this the first occurrence? Since we found one, then n=4 is possible. Therefore, the minimal n is 4.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the minimum possible value of n&quot;. So maybe 4 is the answer. But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a cubic with a root exceeding 15/8. Earlier attempts with cubics didn&#39;t reach 15/8. Let&#39;s think again.Suppose we take a cubic polynomial p(x)=x^3 -x^2 -x -1. We saw that it has a real root around 1.837, which is less than 1.875. Alternatively, is there a different cubic polynomial with coefficients ±1 that might have a larger root?Let&#39;s try p(x)=x^3 +x^2 -x -1. Wait, we did that before; its roots are 1 and -1 (double). No. How about p(x)=x^3 -x^2 +x -1. We saw that x=1 is a root. The other roots are complex. How about p(x)=x^3 -x^2 -x +1. Factored as (x-1)^2(x+1). Roots at 1 (double) and -1. So absolute values 1. Not helpful.Another cubic: p(x)=x^3 +x^2 +x -1. Let&#39;s check for positive roots. At x=0: -1. At x=1:1+1+1-1=2. So a root between 0 and1. Not helpful. At x= -1: -1 +1 -1 -1=-2. At x=-2: -8 +4 -2 -1=-7. So no large negative roots. So only a root between 0 and1. Doesn&#39;t help.Another cubic: p(x)=x^3 -x^2 +x +1. Let&#39;s evaluate at x=2:8 -4 +2 +1=7. At x=1:1 -1 +1 +1=2. At x=0.5:0.125 -0.25 +0.5 +1=1.375. So all positive. Wait, Descartes&#39; Rule of Signs: coefficients are +1, -1, +1, +1. Two sign changes, so two or zero positive roots. But since p(0)=1, p(inf)=inf. Not sure. Maybe complex roots. Maybe this cubic doesn&#39;t have real roots beyond 1. So maybe not helpful.Alternatively, p(x)=x^3 +x^2 -x +1. Let&#39;s check. At x=1:1+1-1+1=2. At x=2:8 +4 -2 +1=11. At x=-1:-1 +1 +1 +1=2. At x=-2:-8 +4 +2 +1=-1. So there might be a root between -2 and -1. But |r| would be between 1 and2, but negative. However, the absolute value is still between 1 and2. But we need |r|&gt;15/8≈1.875. Let&#39;s check if the root is less than -1.875. Let&#39;s compute p(-1.875):x=-15/8: (-15/8)^3 + (-15/8)^2 - (-15/8) +1First, (-15/8)^3 = -3375/512≈-6.5918(-15/8)^2=225/64≈3.5156So p(-15/8)= -6.5918 +3.5156 +15/8 +1≈-6.5918 +3.5156 +1.875 +1≈(-6.5918 +3.5156) + (1.875 +1)≈-3.0762 +2.875≈-0.2012. So p(-15/8)≈-0.2012. At x=-2: p(-2)=-8 +4 +2 +1=-1. So between x=-2 and x=-15/8, p(x) goes from -1 to -0.2012. So the real root is less than -15/8? Wait, x=-15/8≈-1.875. p(-1.875)=≈-0.2012, p(-2)=-1. So actually, the root is between x=-1.875 and x=-2. Wait, p(-1.875)≈-0.2012, p(-2)=-1. Wait, that&#39;s inconsistent. If x decreases from -1.875 to -2, p(x) becomes more negative? Wait, perhaps the function is increasing or decreasing.Wait, compute the derivative p’(x)=3x² +2x -1. At x=-1.875, p’(-1.875)=3*(15/8)^2 +2*(-15/8) -1=3*(225/64) - 30/8 -1=675/64 - 240/64 -64/64= (675 -240 -64)/64=371/64≈5.796. So the derivative is positive at x=-1.875, meaning the function is increasing there. Therefore, since at x=-1.875, p(x)=≈-0.2012 and the function is increasing, as x increases from -2 to -1.875, p(x) increases from -1 to -0.2012, and then continues increasing. So the real root is actually greater than -2, but since at x=-1.875, p(x) is still negative, and as x approaches -1.5, let&#39;s check p(-1.5)=(-3.375) + (2.25) - (-1.5) +1= -3.375 +2.25 +1.5 +1≈1.375. So p(-1.5)=1.375. So there is a root between -1.875 and -1.5. So the absolute value of the root is between 1.5 and1.875. Therefore, |r|&lt;15/8. So even this cubic doesn&#39;t have a root with |r|&gt;15/8.Therefore, it seems that n=4 is the minimal degree required.Wait, but let me check another quartic polynomial. Maybe a different combination of coefficients. For example, p(x)=x^4 -x^3 -x^2 -x +1. Let&#39;s see if this has a root greater than 15/8.At x=1:1 -1 -1 -1 +1= -1.At x=2:16 -8 -4 -2 +1=3. So a root between 1 and2. Let&#39;s check at x=1.5:x=1.5:5.0625 -3.375 -2.25 -1.5 +1= -1.0625.x=1.75:9.3789 -5.3594 -3.0625 -1.75 +1≈ -0.793.x=1.875:12.3623 -6.5918 -3.5156 -1.875 +1≈12.3623 -11.9824≈0.3799. So p(1.875)=≈0.3799. So there&#39;s a root between 1.75 and1.875. So approximately, using linear approximation: Between x=1.75 (p≈-0.793) and x=1.875 (p≈0.3799). The difference in x=0.125, difference in p=1.1729. To reach zero from -0.793, need 0.793/1.1729≈0.676 of the interval. So approximate root at1.75 +0.125*0.676≈1.8345. So |r|≈1.8345, which is less than15/8=1.875. So this quartic doesn&#39;t have a root exceeding 15/8. Therefore, the previous quartic polynomial p(x)=x^4 -x^3 -x^2 -x -1 has a root around1.95, which is greater than15/8.Thus, confirming that n=4 is achievable.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a cubic polynomial with different coefficients that could have a root exceeding15/8. Suppose we take p(x)=x^3 -x^2 -x -1. The real root is≈1.839, which is less than1.875. If we take p(x)= -x^3 -x^2 -x -1, then the roots are the same as x^3 +x^2 +x +1=0, which factors as (x+1)(x^2 +0x +1), so roots -1, i, -i. So |r|=1.Alternatively, p(x)=x^3 +x^2 -x -1, which factors as (x+1)^2(x-1). So roots at -1 (double) and1. So again, |r|=1.Another cubic: p(x)=x^3 -x +1. But wait, coefficients here would be 1,0,-1,1. But the problem states all coefficients must be ±1. So zero coefficients are not allowed. So this polynomial is invalid for the problem.Therefore, it seems that n=4 is the minimal degree where such a polynomial exists. Hence, the answer is boxed{4}.Final AnswerThe minimum possible value of ( n ) is boxed{4}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a polynomial ( p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ldots + a_0 ) with each ( a_i ) being either 1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum ( n ) such that there exists a root ( r ) with ( |r| &gt; frac{15}{8} ).1. Initial Considerations:   - The Cauchy bound for roots of such polynomials is 2, but we need a root exceeding ( frac{15}{8} approx 1.875 ).   - Using the triangle inequality and geometric series, we derived an inequality involving ( |r| ), leading to the need for a polynomial of higher degree.2. Checking Lower Degrees:   - For ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), the roots&#39; absolute values are at most 1.618, which is less than 1.875.   - For ( n = 3 ), checking various cubic polynomials showed the maximum root absolute value was approximately 1.837, still less than 1.875.3. Checking Quartic Polynomials:   - Consider the polynomial ( p(x) = x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 ).   - Evaluating this polynomial at ( x = frac{15}{8} ) and using the Intermediate Value Theorem confirmed a root between ( frac{15}{8} ) and 2.   - Approximations and calculations showed the root is approximately 1.95, which is greater than ( frac{15}{8} ).4. Conclusion:   - The polynomial ( p(x) = x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 ) with coefficients ±1 has a root exceeding ( frac{15}{8} ).   - Therefore, the minimum ( n ) required is 4.[boxed{4}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-1d99925a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-1d99925a><span class="icon" data-v-1d99925a>🔑:</span>Answer: 4 We claim that n=4 is the answer.

The function given is f(x) = 3 - 2x. We need to find the solution set for the inequality |f(x+1) + 2| ≤ 3. Hmm, let me break this down.First, let&#39;s figure out what f(x+1) is. Since f(x) = 3 - 2x, replacing x with (x+1) should give us f(x+1). So, substituting into the function:f(x+1) = 3 - 2*(x+1)Let me compute that. The 2 multiplies both x and 1:f(x+1) = 3 - 2x - 2Then combine the constants:3 - 2 is 1, so f(x+1) = 1 - 2x.Okay, so f(x+1) simplifies to 1 - 2x. Now the problem says |f(x+1) + 2| ≤ 3. Let&#39;s substitute f(x+1):| (1 - 2x) + 2 | ≤ 3Combine the constants inside the absolute value:1 + 2 is 3, so:| 3 - 2x | ≤ 3Alright, so now the inequality simplifies to |3 - 2x| ≤ 3. To solve this, I remember that absolute value inequalities can be rewritten as a compound inequality. Specifically, |A| ≤ B means that -B ≤ A ≤ B. So applying that here:-3 ≤ 3 - 2x ≤ 3Now, let&#39;s solve this compound inequality step by step. First, let&#39;s subtract 3 from all three parts to get rid of the constant term in the middle:-3 - 3 ≤ -2x ≤ 3 - 3Calculating the left and right sides:-6 ≤ -2x ≤ 0Now, we need to solve for x. Remember that when we divide or multiply by a negative number, the inequality signs flip. So, let&#39;s divide all three parts by -2. Let me do that step carefully.Starting with:-6 ≤ -2x ≤ 0Divide each part by -2. Since we&#39;re dividing by a negative number, the inequalities reverse:(-6)/(-2) ≥ x ≥ 0/(-2)Which simplifies to:3 ≥ x ≥ 0Alternatively, writing it in the more standard order from left to right:0 ≤ x ≤ 3So, the solution set is all real numbers x such that x is between 0 and 3, inclusive. Let me just check my steps to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.First, substituted x+1 into the function correctly: 3 - 2(x+1) becomes 1 - 2x. Then added 2, getting 3 - 2x. Then took the absolute value and set up the inequality. Split into two inequalities, subtracted 3, divided by -2, reversed inequalities. That seems right.Let me test a value inside the interval, like x = 1.5. Let&#39;s compute |f(x+1) + 2|.First, x+1 is 2.5. f(2.5) = 3 - 2*(2.5) = 3 - 5 = -2. Then add 2: -2 + 2 = 0. |0| = 0, which is ≤ 3. Good.Testing x = 0: x+1 =1, f(1)=3-2*1=1. 1+2=3. |3|=3, which is within the inequality.Testing x=3: x+1=4, f(4)=3-8= -5. -5+2=-3. |-3|=3, which is allowed.How about x = -1? Let&#39;s see: x+1=0, f(0)=3-0=3. 3+2=5. |5|=5, which is greater than 3. So excluded, which is correct because -1 is outside the interval.Similarly, x=4: x+1=5, f(5)=3 -10= -7. -7+2=-5. |-5|=5&gt;3. So also excluded. So the interval seems correct.Therefore, the solution set is [0,3]. Expressed with inequalities, 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.Final AnswerThe solution set is boxed{[0, 3]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = 3 - 2x ), we need to find the solution set for the inequality ( |f(x+1) + 2| leqslant 3 ).First, we substitute ( x+1 ) into the function ( f ):[f(x+1) = 3 - 2(x+1) = 3 - 2x - 2 = 1 - 2x]Next, we substitute ( f(x+1) ) into the inequality:[|1 - 2x + 2| leqslant 3]Simplifying inside the absolute value:[|3 - 2x| leqslant 3]This absolute value inequality can be rewritten as a compound inequality:[-3 leqslant 3 - 2x leqslant 3]Subtracting 3 from all parts:[-3 - 3 leqslant -2x leqslant 3 - 3][-6 leqslant -2x leqslant 0]Dividing by -2 and reversing the inequality signs:[frac{-6}{-2} geqslant x geqslant frac{0}{-2}][3 geqslant x geqslant 0]Rewriting in standard order:[0 leqslant x leqslant 3]Thus, the solution set is (boxed{[0, 3]}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is: If f(x) = 3 - 2x, then find the solution set for |f(x+1) + 2| ≤ 3. Alright, step by step.First, I need to remember what f(x) is. So f(x) is given as 3 minus 2x. That means for any input x, the function f gives 3 minus twice that x. Now, the problem is asking about f(x+1). So instead of plugging x into the function, we plug in x+1. Let me write that down.So f(x+1) would be 3 - 2*(x+1). Let me compute that. 3 minus 2 times (x + 1). Let me distribute the 2: 3 - 2x - 2. Then combining constants: 3 - 2 is 1, so f(x+1) = 1 - 2x. Okay, that seems right.Next, the problem says |f(x+1) + 2| ≤ 3. So I need to take f(x+1), which we found is 1 - 2x, then add 2 to it, and take the absolute value of that, which should be less than or equal to 3. Let me write that out.So | (1 - 2x) + 2 | ≤ 3. Let&#39;s simplify inside the absolute value first. 1 + 2 is 3, so that becomes |3 - 2x| ≤ 3. Hmm, that simplifies things a bit. So the absolute value of 3 minus 2x is less than or equal to 3.Now, to solve an inequality involving absolute value, I remember that |A| ≤ B means that -B ≤ A ≤ B. So applying that here, we can write:-3 ≤ 3 - 2x ≤ 3.Now, I need to solve this compound inequality for x. Let&#39;s break it down into two separate inequalities:1. -3 ≤ 3 - 2x2. 3 - 2x ≤ 3Let me solve each part one by one.Starting with the first inequality: -3 ≤ 3 - 2x.Subtract 3 from both sides to get: -3 - 3 ≤ -2x. That simplifies to -6 ≤ -2x.Now, when I divide both sides by -2, I have to remember that dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So:-6 / (-2) ≥ x. Which simplifies to 3 ≥ x, or x ≤ 3.Okay, that&#39;s the first part. Now the second inequality: 3 - 2x ≤ 3.Subtract 3 from both sides: 3 - 2x - 3 ≤ 0, which simplifies to -2x ≤ 0.Now, divide both sides by -2, again remembering to flip the inequality sign:x ≥ 0.So combining both inequalities, we have x ≥ 0 and x ≤ 3. So the solution set is all real numbers x such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.Wait, let me double-check that. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.First, computing f(x+1):f(x) = 3 - 2x, so f(x+1) = 3 - 2*(x + 1) = 3 - 2x - 2 = 1 - 2x. Correct.Then, f(x+1) + 2 = (1 - 2x) + 2 = 3 - 2x. So |3 - 2x| ≤ 3. Correct.Then, solving |3 - 2x| ≤ 3. So -3 ≤ 3 - 2x ≤ 3.First inequality: -3 ≤ 3 - 2x.Subtract 3: -6 ≤ -2x. Divide by -2: 3 ≥ x. Correct, and that flips to x ≤ 3.Second inequality: 3 - 2x ≤ 3.Subtract 3: -2x ≤ 0. Divide by -2: x ≥ 0. Correct. So x is between 0 and 3, inclusive.Therefore, the solution set is [0, 3]. Let me test a value in the interval to see if it works. Let&#39;s try x = 1.Compute |f(1+1) + 2| = |f(2) + 2|. f(2) is 3 - 2*2 = 3 - 4 = -1. Then, -1 + 2 = 1. |1| = 1, which is ≤ 3. Correct.Test x = 0: |f(0+1) + 2| = |f(1) + 2| = |3 - 2*1 + 2| = |3 - 2 + 2| = |3| = 3, which is equal to 3. So that works.Test x = 3: |f(3+1) + 2| = |f(4) + 2| = |3 - 2*4 + 2| = |3 - 8 + 2| = |-3| = 3, which is equal to 3. Also works.What about x = -1? That&#39;s outside the interval. Let&#39;s see: |f(-1 +1) + 2| = |f(0) + 2| = |3 - 0 + 2| = |5| = 5, which is greater than 3. Correct, so -1 is not part of the solution set.Another test: x = 4. |f(4 + 1) + 2| = |f(5) + 2| = |3 - 10 + 2| = |-5| = 5 &gt; 3. Not included. Correct.So my solution set seems correct. Therefore, the answer is all real numbers from 0 to 3, inclusive. In interval notation, that&#39;s [0, 3].Final AnswerThe solution set is boxed{[0, 3]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( f(x) = 3 - 2x ), we need to find the solution set for ( |f(x+1) + 2| leqslant 3 ).First, compute ( f(x+1) ):[f(x+1) = 3 - 2(x+1) = 3 - 2x - 2 = 1 - 2x]Next, add 2 to ( f(x+1) ):[f(x+1) + 2 = (1 - 2x) + 2 = 3 - 2x]We need to solve the inequality:[|3 - 2x| leqslant 3]This absolute value inequality can be rewritten as a compound inequality:[-3 leqslant 3 - 2x leqslant 3]Solve the compound inequality step by step:1.

So, the question is about whether &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;. Hmm, let&#39;s break it down step by step.First, I need to recall what sufficient and necessary conditions mean. A sufficient condition means that if the first statement is true, then the second must also be true. But it doesn&#39;t necessarily work the other way around. A necessary condition is one where the second statement can only be true if the first is true, but the first being true doesn&#39;t guarantee the second. If it&#39;s both, then they imply each other. If neither, then there&#39;s no implication in either direction.So, in this case, the first statement is &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;, and the second is &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;. I need to see if &quot;p ∨ q&quot; being true affects whether &quot;p ∧ q&quot; is false.Let me start by writing out the truth tables for both p ∨ q and p ∧ q. Maybe that will help visualize.For two propositions p and q, there are four possible truth combinations:1. p = T, q = T2. p = T, q = F3. p = F, q = T4. p = F, q = FNow, let&#39;s compute p ∨ q and p ∧ q for each case.Case 1: p ∨ q = T, p ∧ q = TCase 2: p ∨ q = T, p ∧ q = FCase 3: p ∨ q = T, p ∧ q = FCase 4: p ∨ q = F, p ∧ q = FSo, the only time p ∨ q is false is in case 4. And p ∧ q is true only in case 1. The question is about the relationship between p ∨ q being true and p ∧ q being false.Let&#39;s see. If &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;, does that mean &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;? Well, looking at the cases:When p ∨ q is true (cases 1, 2, 3), p ∧ q can be either true (case 1) or false (cases 2, 3). So, if p ∨ q is true, p ∧ q isn&#39;t necessarily false. So, p ∨ q being true doesn&#39;t guarantee that p ∧ q is false. Therefore, it&#39;s not a sufficient condition because there&#39;s a case where p ∨ q is true but p ∧ q is also true.Is it a necessary condition? A necessary condition would mean that if &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, then &quot;p ∨ q must be true&quot;. Wait, let&#39;s check the contrapositive. The necessary condition for S is that S can only hold if the condition holds. So, if &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, does that imply &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;?Looking at the truth table, when is p ∧ q false? In cases 2, 3, and 4. Now, in case 4, p ∨ q is false. So, there&#39;s a case where p ∧ q is false but p ∨ q is also false. Therefore, &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot; does not necessarily lead to &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;. Hence, &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; isn&#39;t a necessary condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;.Wait, hold on. Wait, necessary condition is that if &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, then &quot;p ∨ q must be true&quot;. But in case 4, p ∧ q is false, but p ∨ q is also false. So, the implication &quot;If p ∧ q is false, then p ∨ q is true&quot; is false in case 4. Therefore, &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is not a necessary condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;.So, &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;. But wait, that seems conflicting with the answer options. Let me check again.Alternatively, maybe I confused necessary and sufficient.Wait, the question is phrased as: &quot;the proposition p ∨ q is true&quot; is a ( ) condition for the statement &quot;the proposition p ∧ q is false&quot;.So, the structure is: Is A a condition for B? Where A is &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; and B is &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;.In logic terms, &quot;A is a sufficient condition for B&quot; means A ⇒ B. &quot;A is a necessary condition for B&quot; means B ⇒ A.So, the question is: Is &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; a sufficient condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;? Which would mean if p ∨ q is true, then p ∧ q is false. But as we saw in case 1, when p and q are both true, p ∨ q is true, but p ∧ q is also true. Therefore, A ⇒ B is false, so not a sufficient condition.Is &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; a necessary condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;? That would mean if &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot; then &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;. But as in case 4, &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, but &quot;p ∨ q&quot; is false. Therefore, B ⇒ A is false. Hence, A is neither necessary nor sufficient.Therefore, the answer should be D: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition.But let me verify once more to be sure.If someone claims that A is a sufficient condition for B, then whenever A is true, B must be true. But when A is true (p ∨ q is true), B (p ∧ q is false) is not necessarily true, because in case 1, A is true and B is false. Therefore, A is not sufficient.If A is a necessary condition for B, then whenever B is true, A must be true. But B is &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, which is true in cases 2,3,4. However, in case 4, A (p ∨ q) is false. Therefore, when B is true (case 4), A is false, so B does not imply A. Therefore, A is not a necessary condition.Therefore, A is neither sufficient nor necessary for B. So the answer is D.But wait, wait, let me check the question again. Wait, the problem says:&quot;the proposition p ∨ q is true&quot; is a ( ) condition for the statement &quot;the proposition p ∧ q is false&quot;.So, in other words, is p ∨ q being true a condition (sufficient/necessary/etc.) for p ∧ q being false. So, phrasing matters here. So, in logical terms, if we are saying that A is a condition for B, that translates to A is a sufficient condition if A ⇒ B, and a necessary condition if B ⇒ A.So, if &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is a sufficient condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, then whenever p ∨ q is true, p ∧ q must be false. But we saw that in case 1, p ∨ q is true but p ∧ q is true, so that&#39;s a counterexample. Therefore, not sufficient.If &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is a necessary condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, that would mean whenever p ∧ q is false, p ∨ q must be true. But as in case 4, p ∧ q is false, but p ∨ q is false. So, that&#39;s a counterexample. Therefore, not necessary.Therefore, neither. So the answer is D.But wait, let me check again. Maybe I got the direction wrong? Let me think.Suppose someone says, &quot;A is a sufficient condition for B&quot;. That means A guarantees B. So if A happens, B must happen. So A ⇒ B. If A is a necessary condition for B, then B can only happen if A happens. So B ⇒ A. So in this case, the question is: Is p ∨ q being true a sufficient/necessary/etc. condition for p ∧ q being false. So in other words, does p ∨ q being true lead to p ∧ q being false (sufficient)? Or is p ∨ q being true required for p ∧ q to be false (necessary)?But when p ∧ q is false, is p ∨ q necessarily true? No, because in case 4, p ∧ q is false, but p ∨ q is false. So, necessary condition would require that whenever p ∧ q is false, then p ∨ q is true. But since that&#39;s not the case, it&#39;s not necessary.Similarly, when p ∨ q is true, is p ∧ q necessarily false? No, because in case 1, p ∨ q is true but p ∧ q is true. So, it&#39;s not sufficient.Therefore, neither. So the answer is D. So the correct option is D.But wait, wait, let me check the answer options again.A: Sufficient but not necessaryB: Necessary but not sufficientC: Necessary and sufficientD: NeitherYes, D is the fourth option. Therefore, the answer should be D.But just to confirm, maybe there&#39;s another perspective. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking if &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is a condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot; in the sense that &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot; can be inferred from &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;, or some relationship. But as we saw, they don&#39;t imply each other. The only case where they overlap is in cases 2 and 3, where p ∨ q is true and p ∧ q is false. But in case 1, p ∨ q is true but p ∧ q is true, and in case 4, both are false.Therefore, there&#39;s no implication either way. So, D is correct.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether the proposition ( p vee q ) being true is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for the proposition ( p land q ) being false, we analyze the truth values of these propositions for all combinations of ( p ) and ( q ):1. Case 1: ( p = text{True}, q = text{True} )   - ( p vee q = text{True} )   - ( p land q = text{True} )2. Case 2: ( p = text{True}, q = text{False} )   - ( p vee q = text{True} )   - ( p land q = text{False} )3. Case 3: ( p = text{False}, q = text{True} )   - ( p vee q = text{True} )   - ( p land q = text{False} )4. Case 4: ( p = text{False}, q = text{False} )   - ( p vee q = text{False} )   - ( p land q = text{False} )Analysis:- Sufficient Condition: If ( p vee q ) is true, does it imply ( p land q ) is false? In Case 1, ( p vee q ) is true but ( p land q ) is also true. Therefore, ( p vee q ) being true does not guarantee ( p land q ) is false. Hence, it is not a sufficient condition.- Necessary Condition: If ( p land q ) is false, does it imply ( p vee q ) is true? In Case 4, ( p land q ) is false but ( p vee q ) is also false. Therefore, ( p land q ) being false does not guarantee ( p vee q ) is true. Hence, it is not a necessary condition.Since ( p vee q ) being true is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for ( p land q ) being false, the correct answer is:boxed{D},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out whether &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;. Let me start by recalling some basic logic concepts. First, let&#39;s remember what &quot;sufficient&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot; mean. A sufficient condition means that if the first statement is true, then the second must be true. So, if &quot;p ∨ q&quot; being true is a sufficient condition for &quot;p ∧ q&quot; being false, then whenever &quot;p ∨ q&quot; is true, &quot;p ∧ q&quot; must automatically be false. On the other hand, a necessary condition means that if the second statement is true, then the first must be true. So, if &quot;p ∨ q&quot; being true is a necessary condition for &quot;p ∧ q&quot; being false, then whenever &quot;p ∧ q&quot; is false, &quot;p ∨ q&quot; must be true. Wait, let me check if I got that right. If A is a necessary condition for B, then B can only be true if A is true. So B ⇒ A. And if A is a sufficient condition for B, then A ⇒ B. Yeah, that&#39;s correct. So the problem is asking whether &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is a sufficient/necessary condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;. Let me rephrase it in logical terms. Let me define:Let A be the statement &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;.Let B be the statement &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;.We need to determine the relationship between A and B. Is A a sufficient condition for B? That is, does A ⇒ B? Is A a necessary condition for B? That is, does B ⇒ A?So first, check if A ⇒ B. If &quot;p ∨ q&quot; is true, does that necessarily mean &quot;p ∧ q&quot; is false? Hmm. Let&#39;s test with truth values. Case 1: Suppose p is true and q is true. Then p ∨ q is true, but p ∧ q is also true. Therefore, in this case, A is true but B is false. Therefore, A ⇒ B is false. So A is not a sufficient condition for B. Therefore, &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is not a sufficient condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;. Because if both p and q are true, then p ∨ q is true, but p ∧ q is also true (so B is false). So that&#39;s a counterexample where A is true but B is false. Hence, A is not sufficient.Now check if A is a necessary condition for B. That is, does B ⇒ A? If &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, does that necessarily mean &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot;? Let&#39;s see. If &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;, that means at least one of p or q is false. But &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; only if at least one of p or q is true. Wait, so if p ∧ q is false, that just means they can&#39;t both be true. But p and q could both be false, right? Let&#39;s test that. Suppose p is false and q is false. Then p ∧ q is false (so B is true), but p ∨ q is false (so A is false). Therefore, in this case, B is true but A is false. Therefore, B does not imply A. Hence, A is not a necessary condition for B. Therefore, &quot;p ∨ q is true&quot; is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for &quot;p ∧ q is false&quot;. Therefore, the answer should be D: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition.Wait, but let me confirm again. Let me think of all possible truth values.p | q | p ∨ q | p ∧ q | B: ¬(p ∧ q)T | T | T     | T     | FT | F | T     | F     | TF | T | T     | F     | TF | F | F     | F     | TSo B is true in the last three cases. A is true in the first three cases. So when is B true? When either p or q is false. When is A true? When at least one is true. So B being true includes the case where both are false (so A is false) and the cases where one is true and the other is false (so A is true). Therefore, B can be true even if A is false (when both are false). Therefore, B does not imply A. Hence, A is not necessary for B.Similarly, A being true includes the case where both are true (so B is false). Therefore, A does not imply B. So, A is not sufficient for B.Therefore, the answer is D: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether &quot;the proposition ( p vee q ) is true&quot; is a sufficient or necessary condition for &quot;the proposition ( p land q ) is false&quot;, we analyze the logical relationships between these statements.1. Definitions:   - Let ( A ) be the statement &quot;( p vee q ) is true&quot;.   - Let ( B ) be the statement &quot;( p land q ) is false&quot;.2. Sufficient Condition Check (A ⇒ B):   - If ( A ) (i.e., ( p vee q ) is true), does it necessarily mean ( B ) (i.e., ( p land q ) is false)?   - Counterexample: If both ( p ) and ( q ) are true, then ( p vee q ) is true (A is true), but ( p land q ) is also true (B is false). Hence, ( A ) does not imply ( B ). Therefore, ( A ) is not a sufficient condition for ( B ).3. Necessary Condition Check (B ⇒ A):   - If ( B ) (i.e., ( p land q ) is false), does it necessarily mean ( A ) (i.e., ( p vee q ) is true)?   - Counterexample: If both ( p ) and ( q ) are false, then ( p land q ) is false (B is true), but ( p vee q ) is false (A is false). Hence, ( B ) does not imply ( A ). Therefore, ( A ) is not a necessary condition for ( B ).4. Truth Table Analysis:   - The truth table for ( p ), ( q ), ( p vee q ), and ( p land q ) confirms the above conclusions:     - When both ( p ) and ( q ) are true, ( A ) is true but ( B ) is false.     - When both ( p ) and ( q ) are false, ( B ) is true but ( A ) is false.Thus, &quot;the proposition ( p vee q ) is true&quot; is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for &quot;the proposition ( p land q ) is false&quot;.[boxed{D}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-1d99925a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-1d99925a><span class="icon" data-v-1d99925a>🔑:</span>Since &quot;the proposition p vee q is true&quot; means that either both p and q are true, or one is true and the other is false, we cannot deduce that &quot;the proposition p land q is false.&quot;On the other hand, if &quot;the proposition p land q is false,&quot; then both p and q may be false or one of them is true and the other is false.

Let me break down each condition and try to understand what they mean.First, each element in S is a positive integer not exceeding 100. That&#39;s straightforward; all numbers are between 1 and 100, inclusive.Second, for any two different elements a and b in S, there must exist another element c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) = 1. So, whenever I pick any two numbers from the set, their sum should have at least one number in the set that&#39;s coprime with it.Third, for any two different elements a and b in S, there must exist another element c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. So, similar to the second condition, but this time the sum a + b must share a common factor greater than 1 with some element in the set.So, the set S has to be such that for any pair, their sum is both coprime to some element and not coprime to another element in the set. Interesting. So, the set can&#39;t be too &quot;sparse&quot; in terms of factors, but also needs to have enough elements with different factors to satisfy both conditions.I need to maximize the size of S under these constraints. Let me think about possible constructions.First, maybe if all numbers are even? Let&#39;s see. If all elements are even, then any sum a + b would also be even. For condition 2, we need a c such that gcd(even, c) = 1. But if all c&#39;s are even, then gcd(even, even) is at least 2, which can&#39;t be 1. So, that would violate condition 2. So, all even numbers would not work because there&#39;s no c in S that is odd, hence can&#39;t have gcd 1 with an even sum.Similarly, if all numbers are odd, then a + b would be even. For condition 2, we need an element c in S that is coprime with the even sum. Since c is odd (as all elements are odd), gcd(even, odd) could be 1 if the odd number is not a multiple of any prime factor of the sum. But condition 3 requires that there&#39;s some c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. Since a + b is even, any even c would share a factor of 2, but if all elements are odd, then c is odd, so gcd(even, odd) is 1 if the odd number doesn&#39;t share any other factors. Wait, but since all c&#39;s are odd, the gcd would be 1 unless the odd c shares an odd prime factor with a + b.So, if all elements are odd, then for condition 2, when we have two odds a and b, their sum is even. To satisfy condition 2, we need an element c in S that is coprime with the even sum. Since c is odd, this requires that c is coprime with a + b. But since a + b is even, the gcd would be 1 if c is coprime with (a + b)/2. But maybe there&#39;s a c that is coprime with the entire sum. For example, if the sum is 4, then c=1 would have gcd 1, but if c=3, gcd(4,3)=1 as well. If the sum is 6, c=5 would have gcd 1, but c=3 would have gcd 3. So, depending on the sum, maybe such a c exists.For condition 3, since the sum is even, we need an element c in S such that gcd(even, c) &gt; 1. Since c is odd, that would require that c shares an odd prime factor with the even sum. So, for example, if the sum is 6 (which factors into 2*3), then we need a c that is divisible by 3. So, if the set includes numbers divisible by 3, then such a c exists. Similarly, for other sums.Therefore, maybe if the set consists of all odd numbers, but also includes 1. Wait, 1 is coprime with everything. But 1 is in the set, so for any sum a + b, gcd(a + b, 1) = 1, so condition 2 would be satisfied automatically because c=1 would always work. But wait, but 1 is a positive integer, so it&#39;s allowed. But then condition 3 would require that for any a and b, there exists a c such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. However, if 1 is in the set, then if we have other numbers, but if all other numbers are primes, maybe? Wait, let&#39;s think.If S contains 1 and all primes, then for condition 3, when we take two primes, their sum is even (if primes are odd). The sum is even, so to have gcd &gt;1 with some c in S. If S includes 2, then even sum might be divisible by 2. Wait, but if 2 is in S, then the sum a + b is even, so gcd(a + b, 2) = 2 if the sum is even. So, if 2 is in the set, then for any two primes that are odd, their sum is even, so c=2 would satisfy gcd(a + b, 2) = 2 &gt;1. But if S includes 1 and all primes up to 100, maybe that works. But then, if we include 1, then for condition 2, we can always use c=1. But 1 is problematic for condition 3 because if we have two elements a and b such that a + b is 2, but the only elements are 1 and 2. For example, if a=1 and b=1, but they have to be different elements, so a and b must be distinct. Wait, but in the problem statement, condition (2) and (3) are for any two different elements a and b. So, if 1 is in the set, and another element, say 2. Then a=1 and b=2. Their sum is 3. Then we need a c in S such that gcd(3, c)=1. Since S contains 1 and 2, gcd(3,1)=1, so that&#39;s okay. Then we need a c in S such that gcd(3, c) &gt;1. But 3 is not in S (assuming S is {1,2}), so there is no such c. Therefore, the set {1,2} would not satisfy condition (3). Therefore, including 1 might cause problems because 1 can only give gcd 1 with any sum, but for condition (3), you need another element that shares a common factor with the sum.Therefore, maybe including 1 is not a good idea. Let me think again.Suppose we avoid 1. Let&#39;s consider the set of all even numbers. But as we saw earlier, all even numbers would fail condition (2), because any sum of two even numbers is even, and all c&#39;s are even, so gcd(even, even) &gt;=2, so no c would satisfy gcd(a + b, c)=1. So, that&#39;s out.How about a mix of even and odd numbers? Let&#39;s see. Suppose the set has both even and odd numbers. Then, the sum of two evens is even, the sum of two odds is even, and the sum of even and odd is odd. So, for sums that are even, we need an element c such that gcd(even, c)=1 (so c must be odd and coprime with the even sum). For sums that are odd, we need an element c such that gcd(odd, c)=1 (so c must be even or odd coprime with the sum). But also, for condition (3), for even sums, we need a c that shares a common factor with the sum. For odd sums, we need a c that shares a common factor with the sum.This seems complicated. Maybe it&#39;s better to think in terms of specific constructions.Let me consider the set of all numbers from 51 to 100. That&#39;s 50 numbers. Let&#39;s check if this set satisfies the conditions.First, each element is between 1 and 100.Second, for any two elements a and b in 51-100, their sum a + b is between 102 and 200. For condition (2), we need a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) = 1. Since all c&#39;s are between 51-100, and a + b is between 102-200. To have gcd(a + b, c)=1, c must be coprime with the sum. Since the sum is at least 102, which is greater than the maximum c which is 100, so c can&#39;t be a factor of the sum. However, it&#39;s possible that c shares a common prime factor with the sum. For example, if a + b is even, then c must be odd to have gcd 1. But since 51-100 includes both even and odd numbers. Wait, actually numbers from 51-100: 51 is odd, 52 even, ..., 100 even. So half are odd, half are even. If a and b are both odd, their sum is even. So, to have gcd(a + b, c)=1, we need an odd c that is coprime with the sum. Since the sum is even, which is divisible by 2, so as long as c is an odd number not sharing any other prime factors with the sum. But how can we ensure that such a c exists?Alternatively, if a and b are both even, then their sum is even, and we need a c that is coprime with the sum. Since the sum is even, c must be odd. There are 25 odd numbers in 51-100 (from 51, 53, ..., 99). Similarly, the sum a + b is between 104 and 200. For example, if the sum is 104, which factors into 2^3 * 13. Then, any odd c not divisible by 13 would satisfy gcd(104, c)=1. Since there are 25 odd numbers, and only those divisible by 13 (which are 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, but since we are in 51-100, 65, 78, 91) are divisible by 13. But in the odd numbers from 51-100, the ones divisible by 13 are 65 and 91. So, there are 2 such numbers. So, out of 25 odd numbers, 2 are divisible by 13, so 23 are not. Therefore, for sum=104, there are 23 possible c&#39;s that are coprime. So, that&#39;s okay.But does this hold for all possible sums? For example, take a sum that is a prime number. Wait, but all sums from 102 to 200. The primes in this range would be 103, 107, ..., 199. If the sum is a prime number p, then to have gcd(p, c)=1, c just needs not to be p. But since c is at most 100, and p is at least 103, so p is not in S. Therefore, gcd(p, c)=1 for all c in S. Therefore, for such prime sums, any c in S would satisfy gcd(p, c)=1. Therefore, condition (2) is satisfied by any c. But we need at least one c. So, that&#39;s okay. However, for condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(p, c) &gt;1. But since p is prime and greater than 100, and all c&#39;s are &lt;=100, so none of them would be divisible by p. Therefore, gcd(p, c)=1 for all c in S. Therefore, condition (3) would fail for such sums.Therefore, the set of numbers from 51 to 100 does not satisfy condition (3) when the sum is a prime number greater than 100. So, this construction doesn&#39;t work.Hmm. So maybe including smaller numbers is necessary?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the set of all composite numbers. Wait, composite numbers might have more factors, which might help with condition (3), but condition (2) requires coprimality. But primes are needed for coprimality. Wait, but if the set includes primes, then those primes can be coprime to sums that don&#39;t include their multiples.This is getting a bit tangled. Let&#39;s try a different approach.Suppose we partition the numbers from 1 to 100 into different classes based on their prime factors and try to construct S such that for any two elements, the sum has both a coprime element and a non-coprime element in S.Alternatively, maybe considering the set of all numbers except primes. Wait, but primes are useful for condition (2), as they can be coprime to many sums.Alternatively, think about the complement: if the set S is such that it contains numbers with various prime factors so that for any sum a + b, there exists a number in S sharing a prime factor with it (condition 3) and also a number in S not sharing any prime factors with it (condition 2).Therefore, S needs to be a set where the primes covering all possible sums a + b are present, but also missing some primes to allow coprimality.Wait, but how can the same set S both include and exclude primes? That seems conflicting.Alternatively, maybe S needs to contain numbers with all small prime factors, so that for any sum, one of those primes divides the sum (satisfying condition 3), and also contains numbers that are coprime to each sum (condition 2). But having numbers with all small primes would make it hard to have numbers coprime to the sum.Alternatively, think about using the concept of multiplicative functions or something else.Wait, another idea: if S is the set of all numbers from 1 to 100, except those divisible by some prime p. But which prime p?But that might not work. Let me try.Suppose we remove all multiples of 2. Then S consists of all odd numbers from 1 to 100. Then, for any two elements a and b, their sum is even. For condition (2), we need an element c in S (which is odd) such that gcd(even sum, c)=1. Since c is odd, this requires that c is coprime with the sum. For example, if the sum is 4, then c=3 would have gcd(4,3)=1. If the sum is 6, c=5 would work. Similarly, for any even sum, we can pick an odd c that is coprime. But is there always such a c? For even sums, which are multiples of 2, the other prime factors vary. If the sum is 2*p where p is a prime, then c needs to be an odd number not divisible by p. Since S has all odd numbers, except multiples of 2, which are already excluded. So as long as there exists an odd number not divisible by p, which there is, unless p=2, but p is an odd prime. So, for example, sum=2*3=6, c=5. Sum=2*5=10, c=3. Etc.For sums that are multiples of multiple primes, like 30=2*3*5. Then c needs to be coprime with 30. So any odd number not divisible by 3 or 5. For example, 7, 11, etc. So such numbers exist in S.Therefore, maybe condition (2) is satisfied for S being all odd numbers. Now, check condition (3): for any two elements a and b in S, there exists c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt;1. Since a and b are odd, their sum is even. So, gcd(a + b, c) &gt;1 requires that c is even, but S contains only odd numbers. Therefore, c must be an odd number sharing an odd prime factor with the even sum. Since the sum is 2*k, where k is an integer. So, if k has any odd prime factors, then c can be a multiple of that prime. For example, sum=6=2*3, then c=3, 9, 15, etc., which are multiples of 3. If k is a power of 2, say sum=8=2^3, then k=4=2^2. Then, the sum has no odd prime factors, so gcd(a + b, c) can only be 1 or 2. But since c is odd, gcd(8, c)=1. Therefore, for sum=8, there is no c in S (all odd) such that gcd(8, c) &gt;1. Therefore, condition (3) is not satisfied when the sum is a power of 2. Therefore, the set of all odd numbers fails condition (3) in such cases.Therefore, such a set S cannot include only odd numbers if there exist pairs a, b where a + b is a power of 2. For example, if S contains 1 and 3, then a=1, b=3, sum=4. Then, gcd(4, c) must be &gt;1 for some c in S. But all c in S are odd, so gcd(4, c)=1. Therefore, condition (3) fails. Hence, including 1 and 3 would be problematic.So, to avoid this, perhaps we need to exclude numbers that can sum to a power of 2. But there are many powers of 2 between 2 and 200 (since the maximum sum is 100 + 99 = 199). The powers of 2 in this range are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. So, sums of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.But in our set S, which is a subset of 1-100, the sums can be up to 199. So, 128 is in the range. Therefore, if any two numbers in S sum to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128, then condition (3) would fail because there&#39;s no c in S such that gcd(power of 2, c) &gt;1, since all c&#39;s are odd. Therefore, to satisfy condition (3), we must ensure that no two elements in S sum to a power of 2. Alternatively, if we include some even numbers in S, so that c can be even and share a factor of 2 with the sum. Wait, if S includes even numbers, then for sums that are even (which include sums that are powers of 2), c can be an even number, so gcd(power of 2, even c) would be at least 2. Therefore, if S includes some even numbers, then condition (3) can be satisfied for sums that are powers of 2.Therefore, perhaps a mixed set with both even and odd numbers is necessary. But then, we have to balance conditions (2) and (3).Let me try constructing such a set.Suppose S includes all even numbers and some odd numbers. Let&#39;s see:If S has all even numbers from 2 to 100 (50 numbers) and some odd numbers. Now, for any two evens, their sum is even. For condition (2), we need a c in S such that gcd(even sum, c)=1. If c is even, gcd(even, even) &gt;=2, so no. Therefore, we need an odd c in S such that gcd(even sum, odd c)=1. So, the odd c must be coprime with the even sum. For example, sum=4, c=3. Sum=6, c=5. Etc. However, if we include all even numbers, then we need to include enough odd numbers coprime to various even sums. But since the even sums can be any even number from 4 to 200, but c is limited to 1-100.Alternatively, if we include 1 in S. Then, for any even sum, gcd(even sum, 1)=1. So, condition (2) is satisfied. But then, for condition (3), for any two even numbers a and b, their sum is even. So, to satisfy condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(even sum, c) &gt;1. If c is even, then gcd(even, even) &gt;=2. So, any even c would work. Therefore, since S includes all even numbers, we can choose c as any even number. Therefore, conditions (2) and (3) are satisfied for pairs of even numbers.Now, what about pairs of an even and an odd number. Let&#39;s say a is even and b is odd. Then, their sum is odd. For condition (2), we need a c in S such that gcd(odd sum, c)=1. Since c can be even or odd. If we choose c as even, then gcd(odd, even)=1. So, any even c would work. Therefore, condition (2) is satisfied. For condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(odd sum, c) &gt;1. Since the sum is odd, c must share an odd prime factor with the sum. So, if the sum has any prime factors, then c can be a multiple of that prime. If the sum is a prime number, then we need c to be that prime. But if the prime is greater than 100, which the sum could be up to 199, then c can&#39;t be that prime. Therefore, similar to the previous problem.Wait, if the sum is a prime number p where p &gt; 100, then there is no c in S (since c &lt;=100) such that gcd(p, c) &gt;1. Therefore, condition (3) would fail for such pairs. Therefore, we have to ensure that the sum of any even and odd number in S is not a prime number greater than 100.But how can we ensure that? For example, take an even number 2 and an odd number 99. Their sum is 101, which is prime. Then, to satisfy condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(101, c) &gt;1. But 101 is prime and greater than 100, so no such c exists in S. Therefore, such a pair would violate condition (3). Therefore, including 2 and 99 in S would be invalid.Therefore, to avoid this, we must ensure that for any even a and odd b in S, a + b is not a prime greater than 100. This seems difficult because there are many such primes (101, 103, 107, ..., 199). Therefore, perhaps this approach is not feasible.Alternatively, maybe exclude certain even or odd numbers to prevent such sums. But this seems complicated.Wait, another approach: Let&#39;s consider splitting the numbers into two subsets: one containing numbers with all prime factors &lt;= p, and another containing numbers with prime factors &gt; p. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, think about Schur numbers or Ramsey theory, where certain structures are unavoidable. But maybe that&#39;s overcomplicating.Wait, perhaps the maximum size is 50. If we take all even numbers, but we saw earlier that all even numbers don&#39;t satisfy condition (2). But if we take all even numbers plus the number 1. Then, for any two even numbers, their sum is even. For condition (2), c=1 would have gcd(even,1)=1. For condition (3), any even c would have gcd(even, even) &gt;=2. For pairs involving 1 and an even number, their sum is odd. For condition (2), since 1 is in S, gcd(odd sum, 1)=1. For condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(odd sum, c) &gt;1. The sum is odd, so c must share an odd prime with it. If the sum is a prime greater than 100, then no such c exists. Therefore, similar problem as before. For example, 1 + 100 = 101, which is prime. So, no c in S can satisfy gcd(101, c) &gt;1. Therefore, including 1 and 100 would be invalid.Alternatively, if we exclude 1, and include all even numbers and some odd numbers that don&#39;t create prime sums with evens.But this seems too vague. Let&#39;s think of another construction.What if we take all numbers that are multiples of 3? Then, any sum of two multiples of 3 is also a multiple of 3. For condition (2), we need a c in S such that gcd(multiple of 3, c)=1. But all c&#39;s are multiples of 3, so gcd &gt;=3. Therefore, condition (2) fails.Alternatively, take numbers that are not multiples of 3. Then, sums could be multiples or not. But this might not help.Wait, going back to the problem statement. Both conditions (2) and (3) have to hold for any two different elements a and b. So, for every pair, there exists some c1 such that gcd(a + b, c1) =1 and some c2 (possibly different) such that gcd(a + b, c2) &gt;1. So, the set S must be such that every possible sum a + b is both coprime to some element and shares a factor with another element.Therefore, S needs to have a diverse set of prime factors to cover both conditions.An example of such a set might be all numbers from 2 to 100. Let&#39;s check:Take two numbers a and b. Their sum is between 3 and 199. For condition (2), we need a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) =1. Since c can be 2, if a + b is odd, then gcd(a + b, 2)=1. If a + b is even, then pick c as an odd number coprime with a + b. Since there are plenty of odd numbers in S, this is possible. For condition (3), if a + b is even, then c=2 would have gcd(a + b, 2)=2. If a + b is odd, then it must share a common factor with some odd c in S. Unless a + b is prime and greater than 100, in which case there&#39;s no c in S (since primes greater than 100 aren&#39;t in S). Therefore, similar issue as before. If a + b is a prime between 101 and 199, then there is no c in S that shares a factor with it, so condition (3) fails.Therefore, the set {2,3,...,100} would fail condition (3) for pairs a and b where a + b is a prime in 101-199.To fix this, perhaps include all composite numbers and primes up to 100. Wait, but primes up to 100 can still sum to primes above 100. For example, 97 + 98 = 195 (which is composite). Wait, 97 is prime, 98 is composite. 97 + 98 = 195 = 5*39. So, 5 is a factor. If 5 is in S, then gcd(195,5)=5&gt;1. So, that works. Let me check another pair. Take primes 89 and 95: 89 is prime, 95 is 5*19. Their sum is 184, which is 8*23. Then, gcd(184, 23)=23, if 23 is in S. Since 23 is prime and &lt;=100, it is in S. Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied.Wait, but what if two primes sum to a prime over 100. For example, 97 and 10: 97 +10=107, which is prime. Then, need a c in S such that gcd(107, c) &gt;1. But 107 is prime and not in S (since S only goes up to 100). Therefore, no such c exists. Therefore, the pair 97 and 10 would violate condition (3). Therefore, such pairs can&#39;t be in S.Therefore, to avoid this, we must ensure that for any two elements a and b in S, their sum is either composite or a prime &lt;=100. But primes &lt;=100 are allowed, since c can be that prime. However, primes greater than 100 can&#39;t be used.Therefore, to construct S, we need to include numbers such that the sum of any two is either composite or a prime &lt;=100. But this seems very restrictive. How can we ensure that?Perhaps S can include all composite numbers from 4 to 100 and primes that are less than 50. Wait, because if two primes are less than 50, their sum is less than 100. Wait, for example, primes less than 50: 2, 3, 5, ..., 47. If we include primes less than 50, then their sums would be less than 100. Therefore, primes in S can only be those below 50. Then, the sum of two such primes would be less than 100, so if the sum is prime, it must be &lt;=100, so c can be that prime if it&#39;s in S. Wait, but primes between 50 and 100 would not be included. For example, if we take primes below 50: 2,3,5,7, ...,47. Their sum can be up to 47 + 47 = 94. So, primes up to 94. But primes between 50 and 94 would not be in S, so if the sum is a prime in that range, then there is no c in S with that prime. Therefore, condition (3) would fail.For example, 47 + 47 = 94, which is composite. 43 + 47 = 90, composite. 43 + 43 =86, composite. 41 + 43 =84, composite. 37 + 47 =84, composite. 37 + 37=74, composite. 31 + 37=68, composite. 29 + 31=60, composite. So, maybe if we include primes below 50, their sums are mostly composite. Wait, but 19 + 3 =22 (composite), 17 + 19=36 (composite). However, 3 + 2=5 (prime), which is in S. 5 + 2=7 (prime in S). So, if primes below 50 are included, and their sums can be primes that are also in S, then that&#39;s okay. For example, 3 + 2=5, which is in S, so c=5 satisfies gcd(5,5)=5&gt;1. Similarly, 5 + 2=7, which is in S. So, this works.But if two primes sum to a prime not in S, then it&#39;s a problem. For example, 23 + 23=46 (composite). 23 +19=42 (composite). 23 +17=40 (composite). 23 +13=36 (composite). 23 +11=34 (composite). 23 +7=30 (composite). 23 +5=28 (composite). 23 +3=26 (composite). 23 +2=25 (composite). So, in this case, sums are composite. Similarly, primes like 19: 19 +2=21 (composite), 19 +3=22 (composite), etc. So maybe if we take all composite numbers from 4 to 100 and all primes less than 50, such that the sum of any two primes is either composite or a prime that is in S (i.e., less than 50). Let me check.Take two primes p and q in S (primes &lt;50). If p + q is composite, then okay. If p + q is prime, then it must be in S. But primes in S are &lt;50. Therefore, if p + q is a prime &gt;=50, then it&#39;s not in S, leading to a problem.For example, take p=47 (the largest prime less than 50) and q=2. Then, p + q=49, which is composite. If p=43 and q=5, 43 +5=48, composite. p=41 and q=7=48, composite. Wait, what&#39;s the smallest sum that is a prime &gt;=50? Let&#39;s see. The smallest prime &gt;=50 is 53. So, to get 53 as a sum, we need two primes p and q such that p + q=53. Since 53 is odd, one of them must be even (i.e., 2). So, 53=2 +51, but 51 is not prime. Next, 53=3 +50 (50 not prime). 5 +48 (no), 7 +46 (no), 11 +42 (no), 13 +40 (no), 17 +36 (no), 19 +34 (no), 23 +30 (no), 29 +24 (no), 31 +22 (no), 37 +16 (no), 41 +12 (no), 43 +10 (no), 47 +6 (no). So, 53 cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes less than 50. Similarly, next prime 59: 59=2 +57 (not prime), 3 +56 (no), ..., 29 +30 (no). So, likely, by the Goldbach conjecture, but since we are limited to primes &lt;50, perhaps such primes cannot be expressed as sums. Wait, actually, according to the Goldbach conjecture, every even number &gt;=4 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, but 53 is odd. For odd numbers, one prime has to be 2. So, 53=2 +51, which is invalid as 51 is not prime. So, 53 cannot be written as the sum of two primes. Similarly, primes like 59=2 +57 (invalid), 61=2 +59, but 59 is a prime. However, 59 is greater than 50, so if 59 is not in S, then c=59 is not in S. Therefore, if p=2 and q=59, but q=59 is not in S. So, if we have p=2 in S and q=59 not in S, but since q is not in S, that pair doesn&#39;t exist. Wait, but in our current construction, S includes primes less than 50 and composites from 4 to 100. So, pairs of primes in S can only be primes less than 50. Their sums are either composite or primes less than 100. If the sum is a prime between 50 and 100, then since those primes are not in S, there&#39;s no c in S to satisfy condition (3). But is there a case where two primes in S (primes &lt;50) sum to a prime between 50 and 100? Let&#39;s check.Take primes p=47 and q=13. 47+13=60 (composite). p=43 + 17=60 (composite). 41 + 19=60 (composite). 37 + 23=60 (composite). 31 + 29=60 (composite). 2 + 47=49 (composite). 3 + 47=50 (composite). 5 + 47=52 (composite). 7 + 47=54 (composite). 11 + 47=58 (composite). 13 + 47=60 (composite). 17 + 43=60 (composite). 19 + 41=60 (composite). 23 + 37=60 (composite). 29 + 31=60 (composite). Similarly, trying other primes:Take p=43 and q=11. 43 +11=54 (composite). p=41 and q=7=48 (composite). p=37 and q=13=50 (composite). p=23 and q=23=46 (composite). It seems challenging to find two primes less than 50 that add up to a prime greater than 50. Because primes (except 2) are odd, so adding two odds gives even, which can&#39;t be prime (except 2). So, the only way to get a prime sum is if one of the primes is 2. For example, 2 + primes:2 + 47=49 (composite)2 + 43=45 (composite)2 + 41=43 (prime). 43 is in S (since 43 &lt;50). So, sum=43, which is in S. Therefore, c=43 satisfies gcd(43,43)=43&gt;1.Similarly, 2 + 37=39 (composite)2 + 31=33 (composite)2 + 29=31 (prime, in S)2 + 23=25 (composite)2 + 19=21 (composite)2 + 17=19 (prime, in S)2 + 13=15 (composite)2 + 11=13 (prime, in S)2 + 7=9 (composite)2 + 5=7 (prime, in S)2 +3=5 (prime, in S)Therefore, the sums that are primes by adding 2 to another prime in S result in primes that are still in S. For example, 2 +3=5, 5 is in S. So, condition (3) is satisfied because c=5 is in S and gcd(5,5)=5&gt;1. Similarly, 2 +11=13, c=13 is in S. So, this works.The only possible problem is when two primes add up to a prime not in S, but as shown above, since 2 + q (where q is a prime in S) results in primes that are also in S (since the sum is &lt;= 2 +47=49 &lt;50), except when q=43: 2 +43=45 (wait, 2 +43=45? Wait, 2 +43=45? No, 2 +43=45? Wait, 43 +2=45? 43 +2=45? 43 +2=45 is incorrect. 43 +2=45? No, 43 +2=45? No, 43 +2=45? Wait, 43 +2=45, which is 45. 45 is not prime. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.Wait, 2 + primes in S:2 +43=45 (composite)2 +41=43 (prime). 43 is in S.2 +37=39 (composite)2 +31=33 (composite)2 +29=31 (prime in S)2 +19=21 (composite)2 +17=19 (prime in S)2 +13=15 (composite)2 +11=13 (prime in S)2 +7=9 (composite)2 +5=7 (prime in S)2 +3=5 (prime in S)So, in these cases, the sums that are prime are all primes that are still in S. Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied because c can be the prime sum which is in S.Therefore, if S includes all composite numbers from 4 to 100 and all primes less than 50, then for any two elements a and b in S:- If both are composite: their sum is... well, composite + composite can be even or odd. For condition (2), if the sum is even, then c=2 is in S (since 2 is a prime less than 50), but wait, 2 is a prime less than 50, so is 2 included in S? Yes. Therefore, if the sum is even, then gcd(even sum, 2)=2&gt;1, so condition (3) is satisfied. For condition (2), we need a c with gcd(even sum, c)=1. Since S includes primes like 3,5,7,... which are coprime with the even sum unless the sum is a multiple of those primes. Wait, but for example, sum=4. gcd(4,3)=1, so c=3 works. Sum=6: gcd(6,5)=1. Sum=8: gcd(8,3)=1. So, as long as there&#39;s a prime in S not dividing the sum, which is likely since primes up to 50 are included and the sum is up to 200, but the primes in S are up to 47.Wait, if the sum is a multiple of all primes in S, then we can&#39;t find such a c. But that&#39;s impossible because the sum is finite and the primes are infinite, but in our case, the primes in S are finite. However, the sum can&#39;t be a multiple of all primes in S. For example, if the sum is a large number, it can&#39;t be divisible by all primes up to 47. So, there must exist at least one prime in S that doesn&#39;t divide the sum, hence providing a c with gcd=1.For condition (3), since the sum is even (if a and b are both composite and even), then c=2 works. If the sum is odd (composite + composite can be odd, e.g., 4 +9=13, which is prime). Wait, 4 and9 are composites in S. Their sum is13, which is a prime. Then, condition (2) requires a c in S such that gcd(13, c)=1. Since 13 is in S (as it&#39;s a prime &lt;50), gcd(13,13)=13&gt;1, but we need a c such that gcd(13, c)=1. For example, c=2: gcd(13,2)=1. So, c=2 works. For condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(13, c)&gt;1. Since 13 is in S, c=13 works. Therefore, both conditions are satisfied.If the sum is a composite odd number, say 9 +4=13 (prime). Wait, already discussed. If the sum is composite odd, say 15. Then, gcd(15, c)=1 can be achieved with c=2,4,7, etc. And gcd(15,c)&gt;1 can be achieved with c=3,5,15, etc. Since S includes all composites and primes &lt;50, 15 is in S (composite), so c=15 works. Similarly for other composite sums.If a and b are a composite and a prime. Let&#39;s say a is composite and b is prime &lt;50. Their sum can be even or odd. If the sum is even, then condition (3): c=2; condition (2): some prime not dividing the sum. If the sum is odd, then if it&#39;s composite, condition (3) can use a factor of the sum. If it&#39;s prime, which would have to be in S if it&#39;s &lt;50, then c=prime sum works for condition (3), and c=2 works for condition (2).Finally, if both a and b are primes &lt;50. Their sum is either composite or a prime &lt;100. If it&#39;s composite, then condition (3) can use a composite number or a prime factor. If it&#39;s a prime, then since the sum is less than 100 (because the maximum prime in S is 47, so 47 +47=94 &lt;100), but primes up to 94 could be in S only if they are &lt;50. Wait, no. If two primes less than 50 sum to a prime greater than 50, but less than 100, then that prime is not in S. Wait, let&#39;s check:The largest possible sum of two primes in S (primes &lt;50) is 47 +47=94. So, primes between 50 and 94 would not be in S. So, if the sum is a prime in that range, then there&#39;s no c in S to satisfy condition (3). But earlier, when adding two primes in S, do they sum to a prime in 50-94?Take primes p=43 and q=11. 43 +11=54 (composite). p=43 and q=7=50 (composite). p=41 and q=13=54 (composite). p=37 and q=19=56 (composite). p=31 and q=23=54 (composite). So, most sums are composite. Let me check if any two primes in S sum to a prime in 50-94.Take p=43 and q=7=50 (composite). p=43 and q=11=54 (composite). p=41 and q=13=54 (composite). p=37 and q=17=54 (composite). p=31 and q=19=50 (composite). p=29 and q=23=52 (composite). It seems difficult. Wait, p=47 and q=2=49 (composite). p=47 and q=3=50 (composite). p=47 and q=5=52 (composite). p=47 and q=7=54 (composite). So, it seems no two primes in S sum to a prime in 50-94. Therefore, all sums of two primes in S are either composite or primes &lt;50 (which are in S). Hence, condition (3) is satisfied because if the sum is composite, there exists a composite c in S sharing a factor, and if the sum is a prime &lt;50, then c=prime sum is in S.Therefore, this construction seems to satisfy both conditions. Now, how many elements are in this set?S includes all composite numbers from 4 to 100 and all primes less than 50.First, count the primes less than 50. The primes less than 50 are:2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47. That&#39;s 15 primes.Now, composite numbers from 4 to 100. The total numbers from 4 to 100 inclusive is 97 numbers. Subtract the primes in this range. Primes between 4 and 100 are the primes from 2 to 97. Wait, but we already included primes less than 50. So, primes from 50 to 100 are: 53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97. That&#39;s 10 primes.Therefore, composite numbers from 4 to100 are total numbers from4 to100:97 numbers, minus primes from2 to100:25 primes (from 2 to97). But we have already counted primes less than50 (15 primes). So, primes from50 to97 are10 primes. So total primes from2 to100 are25.Thus, composite numbers from4 to100 are97 -25=72 numbers. But wait, from4 to100 inclusive is97 numbers (100-4+1=97). From which subtract the number of primes between2 and100, which is25. But 2 and3 are included in the primes, but numbers from4 to100 exclude1,2,3. Wait, no:Wait, the composite numbers from4 to100 are numbers that are not prime and not1. The primes between1 and100 are25 primes. But numbers from4 to100 inclusive: total numbers=97. Out of these, primes are from5 to97 (since 2 and3 are less than4). The primes from5 to97 are23 primes (since total primes less than100 are25, subtract 2 and3). Therefore, composite numbers from4 to100 are97 -23=74. But including4, which is composite.But the initial set S includes all composite numbers from4 to100 and primes less than50. So, primes less than50 are15 primes (including2 and3). Composite numbers from4 to100: total composites from4 to100 is100 - π(100) -1 (excluding1). π(100)=25 primes, so composites=100 -25 -1=74. Therefore, S has74 composites +15 primes=89 elements.But wait, is this correct?Wait, numbers from1 to100:Total numbers=100Number of primes=25 (from2 to97)Number of composite numbers=100 -25 -1=74 (excluding1)But S includes composites from4 to100 (which are74 numbers) and primes less than50 (15 primes). But 4 to100 includes composites starting at4. The primes less than50 are15 primes (2,3,5,...,47). So, total elements in S=74 +15=89.But wait, the composite numbers from4 to100 include numbers like4,6,8,...,100. The primes less than50 include2,3,5,...,47. So, there is no overlap between composites and these primes. Therefore, total is74+15=89.However, we need to check if this set S actually satisfies both conditions. Let&#39;s verify with an example.Take two composite numbers, say4 and6. Their sum is10. For condition (2), need a c in S with gcd(10,c)=1. c=3 (prime in S), gcd(10,3)=1. For condition (3), need a c in S with gcd(10,c)&gt;1. c=4 (composite), gcd(10,4)=2&gt;1. Good.Take a composite and a prime, say4 and3. Their sum is7. For condition (2), c=4, gcd(7,4)=1. For condition (3), c=7 (prime in S), gcd(7,7)=7&gt;1. Good.Take two primes, say3 and5. Their sum is8. For condition (2), c=3, gcd(8,3)=1. For condition (3), c=4, gcd(8,4)=4&gt;1. Good.Take two primes that sum to a prime in S. Say2 and3. Sum=5. For condition (2), c=4, gcd(5,4)=1. For condition (3), c=5, gcd(5,5)=5&gt;1. Good.Take a composite number and a prime that sum to a prime not in S. Wait, based on previous analysis, there are no such pairs because primes in S when summed either give composite or primes still in S. For example, take prime47 and2. Sum=49 (composite). Take prime43 and2. Sum=45 (composite). So, no problem.Take two primes that sum to a prime not in S. As established earlier, this doesn&#39;t happen because the sum would be either composite or a prime less than50. For example, primes47 and3. Sum=50 (composite). Primes43 and7. Sum=50 (composite). So, seems safe.Therefore, this set S with89 elements seems to satisfy both conditions. Is this the maximum?Wait, but the problem asks for the maximum number of elements. If I can add more elements to S without violating the conditions, then89 is not the maximum. Can I include the primes between50 and100? If I include a prime p between50 and100, say53. Then, take a composite number c=100. 53 +100=153. For condition (2), need a c in S such that gcd(153,c)=1. If c=2, gcd(153,2)=1. For condition (3), need a c in S such that gcd(153,c)&gt;1. 153=9*17. So, c=9 (composite) or c=17 (prime in S). gcd(153,9)=9&gt;1. So, condition (3) is satisfied. However, if we include53 in S, then when we take another prime q in S, say2. Sum=53 +2=55 (composite). gcd(55,c)=1 can be achieved with c=2, and gcd(55,c)&gt;1 with c=5 or11. Both5 and11 are in S. So, okay.But the problem arises if two primes in S sum to a prime greater than100. For example, if we include97 in S (which is a prime between50 and100). Then, take97 and2. Sum=99 (composite). 97 and3=100 (composite). 97 and5=102 (composite). So, no problem. However, what about97 and another prime in S (if any). For example, if we add primes up to100, then primes like53,59, etc., are in S. Then, 53 +59=112 (composite). gcd(112,c)=1 can be achieved with c=3, and gcd&gt;1 with c=2. So, works.Wait, but if we include primes &gt;=50 in S, then the sum of two such primes could be a prime greater than100, which is not in S. For example,53 +59=112 (composite). 53 +61=114 (composite). 59 +61=120 (composite). All sums of two primes &gt;=50 are even numbers &gt;=100 +102=202, wait, no. Wait, primes &gt;=50 are 53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97. The sum of the smallest two is53 +59=112, which is composite. The next sum,53 +61=114 (composite), and so on. All sums are even and greater than100, hence composite (since even numbers &gt;2 are composite). Therefore, there&#39;s no case where two primes &gt;=50 sum to a prime. Therefore, including primes &gt;=50 in S would not violate condition (3), because their sums are composite, so we can find a composite c in S to satisfy gcd&gt;1.Therefore, if we include all primes from2 to100 and all composite numbers from4 to100, then S would have25 primes +74 composites=99 elements. But wait, the total numbers from1 to100 are100. Excluding1, we have99 numbers. But S cannot include1. However, earlier we saw that if we include1, then pairs involving1 and others can fail condition (3). But if we exclude1, then S can include all numbers from2 to100, which are99 numbers. Let&#39;s check if this works.Take two primes in S, their sum is even (if both are odd) or odd (if one is2). If the sum is even and composite, then condition (3) can use c=2. If the sum is prime (which would be odd and greater than2), but primes up to199. If the sum is a prime greater than100, then there&#39;s no c in S to satisfy gcd(prime, c)&gt;1. Therefore, pairs of primes in S that sum to a prime greater than100 would violate condition (3).Wait, but if we include all primes from2 to100, and a pair of primes p and q in S sum to a prime r &gt;100, then since r is not in S, there is no c in S such that gcd(r, c) &gt;1. But is this possible? For example, primes p=53 and q=47. Their sum is100 (composite). p=59 and q=43=102 (composite). p=97 and q=13=110 (composite). So, seems all sums of two primes in S (primes up to100) are composite. Because adding two odd primes gives an even number &gt;=6, which is composite. Adding2 and another prime gives an odd number. If that odd number is a prime greater than100, like101, then you have a problem. For example,2 +97=99 (composite).2 +89=91 (composite).2 +83=85 (composite).2 +79=81 (composite).2 +73=75 (composite).2 +71=73 (prime in S). So, sum=73, which is in S. gcd(73,73)=73&gt;1. Okay.2 +67=69 (composite).2 +61=63 (composite).2 +59=61 (prime in S).2 +53=55 (composite). So, the only case where2 + prime gives a prime in S is when the sum is a prime &lt;=100. For example,2 +71=73 (prime in S). Therefore, in that case, c=73 exists. If the sum is a prime &gt;100, then since we can&#39;t have such pairs (because the maximum sum with2 is2 +97=99 &lt;100), there&#39;s no such pair. Therefore, all pairs of primes in S sum to either composite numbers or primes &lt;=100, which are in S. Therefore, including all primes from2 to100 and all composites from4 to100 (i.e., S is all numbers from2 to100) might satisfy both conditions.Wait, let&#39;s check a problematic pair. Take2 and99. 2 is prime,99 is composite. Their sum is101, which is prime. Then, condition (3) requires a c in S such that gcd(101, c) &gt;1. But101 is not in S (since S goes up to100), so no such c exists. Therefore, this pair violates condition (3). Therefore, including99 and2 is invalid.Ah, here&#39;s the problem. Composite numbers can be such that composite + prime = prime &gt;100. For example, composite=99 (which is in S), prime=2 (which is in S). Sum=101, which is prime &gt;100. Therefore, no c in S satisfies gcd(101, c)&gt;1. Hence, condition (3) fails.Therefore, to fix this, we need to exclude composite numbers that when added to a prime in S result in a prime &gt;100. For example, exclude99. If we exclude99, then2 +98=100 (composite). 98 is composite, so98 is in S. Sum=100. gcd(100, c)=1 can use c=99, but99 is excluded. Wait, no, if we exclude99, then S includes2 to100 except1 and99. Then, sum=2 +98=100. For condition (2), c=3 (gcd(100,3)=1). For condition (3), c=2 (gcd(100,2)=2&gt;1). Okay.But if we exclude99, do we have another problematic pair? For example, composite=98 and prime=5. Sum=103 (prime). Then, gcd(103, c) &gt;1 requires c=103, which is not in S. Therefore, composite=98 and prime=5 would be invalid. Therefore, to exclude all such composites that can be added to a prime to get a prime &gt;100, we need to remove many composites.This approach seems unfeasible because there are many such composites. For example, composite=95, prime=6=101 (wait, prime=6 is not prime). Sorry, composite=95 and prime=8=103 (but8 is not prime). Composite=95 and prime=2=97 (prime in S). 95 +2=97 (prime in S). Okay, that&#39;s good. Composite=95 and prime=3=98 (composite). Composite=95 and prime=5=100 (composite). So, okay. Composite=95 and prime=7=102 (composite). So, no problem.Wait, composite=97 is prime, but we are considering composites. Composite=96, prime=5=101 (prime). So,96 +5=101. 96 is composite,5 is prime. Sum=101, which is prime. Therefore, pair96 and5 would violate condition (3). Therefore, composite=96 must be excluded.Similarly, composite=94 and prime=7=101. 94 +7=101. Exclude94.This pattern shows that many composites when added to small primes can result in primes &gt;100. Therefore, to avoid this, we would have to exclude all composites c where c = prime &gt;100 - prime in S. For each prime p in S, exclude composites c=prime&gt;100 - p.But the primes in S are up to97. Therefore, for each prime p in S, the forbidden composites would be (101 - p), (103 - p), ..., (199 - p). But since composites are &lt;=100, we need to find composites c &lt;=100 such that c = q - p, where q is a prime &gt;100. For example, for p=2, q=101: c=99. For p=3, q=103: c=100. For p=5, q=107: c=102 (exceeds 100). So, only c=99 and100. Therefore, if we exclude composites99 and100, then pairs involving p=2 and c=99 (sum=101) and p=3 and c=100 (sum=103) are prevented.But wait,100 is composite. If we include100 in S, then3 +100=103 (prime), which would require a c in S such that gcd(103, c) &gt;1, but103 is not in S. Therefore, we need to exclude100 as well.Similarly,97 +4=101. 4 is composite. So, pair97 and4 would sum to101. Therefore, exclude4? But4 is composite, and excluding4 would mean losing many valid pairs. This seems like a never-ending problem.Alternatively, the only two composites that need to be excluded are99 and100, because for other primes p in S, q - p would exceed100. For example, p=5, q=107: c=102&gt;100. Therefore, only c=99 and100 are problematic. So, if we exclude99 and100 from S, then the only pairs that summed to primes &gt;100 are eliminated.Let&#39;s check:Exclude99 and100. Now, S includes all numbers from2 to98 and101 to100. Wait, no, S is from2 to100, excluding99 and100. So, S includes2 to98 and100 is excluded. But100 is composite, so we&#39;re excluding two composites:99 and100. Then, the problematic pairs are:- 2 +99=101 (but99 is excluded)- 3 +100=103 (but100 is excluded)- 97 +4=101 (4 is included,97 is included). So,97 +4=101. Therefore, gcd(101, c) &gt;1 requires c=101, which is not in S. Therefore, pair97 and4 violates condition (3). So, need to exclude either97 or4. If we exclude4, then we can&#39;t have the pair97 and4. But4 is a composite number, and excluding4 would mean losing many other pairs.This seems like a chain reaction. Therefore, perhaps the only way to avoid all such pairs is to exclude all composites that are of the form prime &gt;100 - prime in S. But this would require excluding many composites, thereby reducing the size of S.Alternatively, the initial construction of S as all composites from4 to100 and primes less than50 (89 elements) avoids this problem because primes &gt;=50 are not included in S. Therefore, when a composite and a prime in S (prime &lt;50) are summed, the sum is less than50 +100=150. But more importantly, the primes in S are less than50, so the sum with composites (up to100) can be up to100 +47=147. The primes &gt;100 start at101. So, the sum composite + prime &lt;50 can be a prime &gt;100 only if composite &gt;100 -47=53. So, composites from54 to100. For example, composite=54 and prime=47: sum=101. Therefore, pair54 and47 sum to101, which is prime. Therefore, in the initial construction where primes &lt;50 are included and composites from4 to100 are included, this pair54 and47 would be in S, and their sum is101. Then, condition (3) would require a c in S such that gcd(101, c) &gt;1, but101 is not in S. Therefore, this pair violates condition (3).Therefore, even the initial construction with89 elements has a problem. For example, composite=54 and prime=47: sum=101.So, this indicates that even the initial construction is invalid.Therefore, my previous approach is flawed.This suggests that constructing such a set S is highly non-trivial and requires a more sophisticated approach.Let me think differently. The problem resembles a graph where each pair of elements must have edges labeled with both a coprime and a non-coprime element. It&#39;s a mix of two conflicting requirements.Perhaps the maximum such set S is 50 elements. For example, all even numbers. But earlier reasoning showed this fails condition (2). Alternatively, the set of all odd numbers, but this fails condition (3) for sums that are powers of two.However, if we take all odd numbers except those that are1 less than a power of two. For example, exclude numbers like1 (since1 +2=3, but2 is not in the set), but this is getting messy.Alternatively, consider that the set S needs to contain both even and odd numbers. Suppose we take exactly50 numbers: half even, half odd. For any even sum (even + even or odd + odd), we can use an odd number for condition (2) and an even number for condition (3). For any odd sum (even + odd), we can use an even number for condition (2) and an odd number sharing a factor for condition (3). However, ensuring that every odd sum has a common factor with some odd number in S requires that every odd number up to 199 is covered by the factors in S. This is impossible, but perhaps choosing odds with small prime factors can cover more cases.Alternatively, if we take all even numbers plus all multiples of small primes. For example, even numbers plus multiples of3,5,7 etc. But this is vague.Alternatively, think about the following set: S includes all even numbers and all odd multiples of3. Then, the total size is50 even numbers + floor(100/3) odd multiples of3. The number of odd multiples of3 up to100 is floor(100/6)=16 (since3,9,15,...,99). So,50+16=66. Check if this works.For two even numbers: sum is even. For condition (2), use an odd multiple of3. If the sum is even, gcd(even, odd multiple of3)=1 if the sum is not a multiple of3. If it is a multiple of3, then gcd &gt;=3. So, for example, sum=6: gcd(6,9)=3&gt;1, but to satisfy condition (2), need gcd(6, c)=1. Choose c=5 (not in S). Wait, S contains only even numbers and odd multiples of3. So, c must be even or odd multiple of3. gcd(6, even)=2 or higher, gcd(6, odd multiple of3)=3. So, there is no c in S with gcd(6,c)=1. Therefore, this set fails condition (2).Therefore, this construction is invalid.Another approach: Let&#39;s consider that condition (2) requires that for every sum a + b, there&#39;s a c in S with gcd(a + b, c) =1. This implies that the set S must contain numbers that are coprime to each possible sum. Since the sums can be any number from3 to199, S must include numbers that cover all possible coprimes, which is only possible if S contains1, but1 causes problems with condition (3). Alternatively, S must include primes that can cover the coprimality.But condition (3) requires that for every sum a + b, there&#39;s a c in S with gcd(a + b, c) &gt;1, meaning S must include numbers that cover all possible prime factors of the sums. This is similar to requiring that S is a covering set for the sums.This seems like S must be a set that is both a coprime base and a covering set, which is conflicting.Given the time I&#39;ve spent and the various attempted constructions not panning out, I think the maximum size of such a set S is likely 100, but excluding1. However, we saw that pairs like2 and99 would sum to101, a prime not in S, failing condition (3). Therefore, it&#39;s not possible.The example given in the problem is from a Mathematical Olympiad, so the answer is likely 100, but the conditions prohibit1. Alternatively, the maximum is 50.Wait, going back to the problem: Each element is a positive integer not exceeding100. So, numbers from1 to100. But conditions (2) and (3).Wait, consider S as the entire set from1 to100. Then, for any two elements a and b:Condition (2): gcd(a + b, c)=1. Since1 is in S, gcd(a + b,1)=1. So, condition (2) is satisfied by c=1.Condition (3): gcd(a + b, c)&gt;1. Since a + b is at least3, and there are numbers in S sharing factors with a + b. For example, if a + b is even, choose c=2. If a + b is a multiple of3, choose c=3, etc. Since S includes all numbers, for any sum a + b, there exists a c in S that divides it (for example, a + b itself, unless a + b &gt;100). But if a + b &gt;100, then c can be a factor of a + b that is &lt;=100. Since a + b &lt;=199, primes between101 and199 would not have a c in S, but composite sums would have factors &lt;=100.For example, take a + b=101 (prime). Then, gcd(101, c)=1 for all c in S (since101 is not in S and is prime). Therefore, condition (3) fails for this sum. Therefore, the entire set1 to100 does not satisfy condition (3) when the sum is a prime &gt;100.Therefore, to construct S, we need to exclude numbers that when added to any other number would result in a prime &gt;100. Specifically, pairs where a + b is a prime &gt;100. However, this requires excluding many numbers, making the set smaller.Given that this is an Olympiad problem, the answer is possibly 50, achieved by taking all even numbers or all odd numbers. However, as discussed earlier, both sets fail either condition (2) or (3). However, if we take all even numbers and include1, but earlier analysis shows this also fails.Wait, another idea: take all numbers from 50 to100. That&#39;s51 numbers. For any two numbers a and b, their sum is between101 and200. For condition (2), need a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c)=1. Since c is between50-100, and a + b is between101-200, c could be coprime with the sum. For example, if the sum is101 (prime), then any c in S not equal to101 (which is not in S) will have gcd=1. But since101 is not in S, all c in S will have gcd=1 with101, so condition (2) is satisfied, but condition (3) fails.Therefore, this approach also doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, take S as numbers not containing any primes. Then, all elements are composite or1. But1 causes problems. Exclude1. Then S is all composites from4 to100. For any two composites, their sum is even or odd. For even sums, c=2 not in S, so gcd with sum=even. But S has no even numbers? No, composites include even numbers. Wait, composites from4 to100 include all even numbers from4 to100. So, S would be all composites from4 to100, which includes even and odd composites.Then, for any two evens: sum even. For condition (2), choose an odd composite c. gcd(even, odd)=1 if the odd composite is coprime. For example, sum=4 +6=10. Choose c=9, gcd(10,9)=1. For condition (3), choose c=4, gcd(10,4)=2.For two odd composites: sum even. Similarly, c=9 for gcd=1, c=4 for gcd=2.For even and odd composite: sum odd. For condition (2), choose c=4 (even), gcd(odd,4)=1. For condition (3), choose c=9 if sum is divisible by3, etc.However, if the sum is a prime, say even + odd composite=prime. For example,4 +9=13 (prime). Then, condition (3) requires a c in S such that gcd(13, c) &gt;1. But13 is not in S (it&#39;s prime), and S only has composites. gcd(13, c)=1 for all c in S. Therefore, condition (3) fails.Therefore, this approach also doesn&#39;t work.Given all these failed attempts, I think the correct answer must be 50, and the set is all even numbers. But as we&#39;ve seen, all even numbers fail condition (2). Alternatively, the set is constructed by other means.Wait, maybe the answer is 66. But I need to think.Wait, recall that in the first construction where S includes composites from4 to100 and primes less than50 (89 elements), but there exists pairs like47 (prime) and54 (composite) summing to101, which is prime. Therefore, to fix this, we need to exclude either47 or54. If we exclude54, the problem is solved for that pair, but other pairs may still exist. For example,46 (composite) +55 (composite)=101. 46 and55 are both in S (composites), sum=101. Then, condition (3) fails. Therefore, even after excluding54, there&#39;s another pair.This suggests that no matter how we choose composites and primes, there will be pairs summing to primes &gt;100, hence violating condition (3). Therefore, perhaps the maximum size of S is achieved when we exclude all composites that can pair with primes to sum to a prime &gt;100. However, this requires extensive case-by-case exclusion.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 50, taking all odd numbers from51 to100. This set has50 elements. Let&#39;s check:For any two odds, sum is even. For condition (2), need an odd c in S such that gcd(even sum, c)=1. For example, sum=102 (51 +51). Choose c=53 (prime), gcd(102,53)=1. For condition (3), choose c=51, gcd(102,51)=51&gt;1.Another example: sum=104 (51 +53). gcd(104,55)=1 (55 in S). gcd(104,52)=52&gt;1 (but52 is not in S). Wait, S contains only odd numbers. Therefore, to satisfy condition (3), need an odd c in S sharing a factor with104=8*13. So, c=65 (13*5), gcd(104,65)=13&gt;1. 65 is in S. So, okay.If sum=128 (64 +64, but64 not in S). The maximum sum is99 +97=196. Take sum=128, which is a power of2. For condition (3), need an odd c in S with gcd(128, c)&gt;1. Since128=2^7, gcd(128, odd c)=1. Therefore, no such c exists. Therefore, pairs that sum to128 violate condition (3). For example, 51 +77=128. 51 and77 are in S. gcd(128, c)=1 for all c in S (since all are odd). Therefore, condition (3) fails.Therefore,,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the maximum number of elements in a set S that satisfies three conditions. Let me try to break down each condition and understand what they mean.First, condition (1) is straightforward: all elements in S are positive integers from 1 to 100. So S is a subset of {1, 2, ..., 100}.Condition (2) says that for any two different elements a and b in S, there must be some element c in S (different from a and b?) such that gcd(a + b, c) = 1. Hmm, so for any pair a, b, there needs to be at least one c in S that is coprime with their sum.Condition (3) is similar but opposite: for any two different elements a and b, there must exist another element c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. So for every pair a, b, their sum must share a common factor with some element c in S.Wait, so for every pair a, b, both conditions must hold: there&#39;s a c that is coprime to a + b, and another c (could be the same or different) that shares a common factor with a + b. But actually, the problem states for any two different elements a and b, there exists another element c (so for each pair, the same c could work for both conditions? Or maybe different c&#39;s?) Wait, no. Let me check again.The problem states:(2) For any two different elements a and b in S, there exists another element c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) is 1;(3) For any two different elements a and b in S, there exists another element c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) is greater than 1.So for each pair a, b, there must be at least one c in S satisfying gcd(a + b, c) = 1, and at least one (possibly different) c in S satisfying gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. So both c&#39;s must exist in S for each pair a, b. So S has to be such that for every sum a + b, there are elements in S coprime to it and also elements sharing a common factor with it.This seems like a balance between having elements with various common factors and not being too restricted. Let me think of how such a set S might look.First, let&#39;s consider small examples. Suppose S is the entire set {1, 2, ..., 100}. Then for any a + b, since 1 is in S, gcd(a + b, 1) = 1, so condition (2) is satisfied. However, for condition (3), if a + b is 1, which is impossible since a and b are positive integers, so a + b is at least 3. For any a + b ≥ 3, there must exist a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. But since S contains all numbers up to 100, certainly there is some c that shares a common factor with a + b. For example, if a + b is even, then 2 is in S. If a + b is odd, then maybe 3, 5, etc., depending on factors. Wait, but if a + b is prime, then the only divisors are 1 and itself. If a + b is prime, then we need a c that is equal to that prime. But if the prime is greater than 100, then c can&#39;t be in S. For example, if a and b are such that a + b is 101 (which is prime), then we need c = 101, but 101 is not in S. Hence, in that case, there&#39;s no c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. Therefore, the entire set {1, 2, ..., 100} does not satisfy condition (3), because there are pairs a, b where a + b is a prime greater than 100, so there&#39;s no c in S that shares a common factor with a + b. Thus, the entire set is invalid.Therefore, S cannot include pairs that sum to primes above 100. Wait, but even if a + b is a prime less than or equal to 100, then c can be that prime. For example, if a + b = 7 (prime), then c = 7 works. So in that case, if 7 is in S, then condition (3) is satisfied. But if a + b is a prime not in S, then there&#39;s no c in S that shares a common factor with a + b. So to satisfy condition (3), S must include all primes up to 200? Wait, no, a and b are up to 100, so a + b can be up to 200. But S can only include numbers up to 100. Therefore, primes between 101 and 200 can&#39;t be included in S. Therefore, for pairs a, b where a + b is a prime in that range, there is no c in S with gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. Hence, S must not contain any pair a, b such that a + b is a prime between 101 and 200. Therefore, such pairs a, b must be excluded from S.But how can we exclude them? Because if two numbers a and b in S sum to a prime between 101 and 200, then there is no c in S (since the prime is not in S) to satisfy condition (3). Therefore, S must not contain any such pairs a, b. Therefore, S must be a set where no two elements a, b sum to a prime between 101 and 200. But primes between 101 and 200 are quite a few. For example, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199. So that&#39;s a lot of primes. Therefore, S must be constructed such that no two elements in S sum to any of these primes.Alternatively, maybe S is such that for any a + b, either a + b is not a prime (so composite, in which case it has a factor that&#39;s in S) or if a + b is prime, then that prime is in S. But primes between 101 and 200 can&#39;t be in S, so S must avoid pairs a, b where a + b is such a prime.So constructing S such that no two elements sum to a prime in 101-200. Then, for condition (3), for any a, b, if a + b is composite, there exists a c in S sharing a common factor with a + b. Since composite numbers have factors, but if S includes numbers that cover all possible prime factors up to 100, then perhaps that&#39;s possible. For example, if S includes all primes up to 100, then any composite a + b will have a prime factor ≤ 100, so c can be that prime factor. However, primes up to 100 are 25 primes (from 2 to 97). But if S includes these primes, then for any composite a + b, which can be written as a product of primes ≤ a + b (but a + b can be up to 200, so primes up to 200, but S only includes primes up to 100). So if a composite a + b has a prime factor ≤ 100, then c can be that prime. But if a + b is a composite number with all prime factors &gt; 100, which would mean a + b is a square of a prime between 101 and 200, but those squares are 101² = 10201, which is way over 200, so actually, all composite numbers up to 200 must have a prime factor ≤ 100. Because the smallest prime above 100 is 101, and 101*2=202, which is over 200. Therefore, any composite number up to 200 must have a prime factor ≤ 100. Therefore, if S includes all primes up to 100, then for any composite a + b, there is a prime factor in S, hence c can be that prime, so gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. Therefore, condition (3) would be satisfied for composite a + b.But if a + b is a prime between 101 and 200, then S cannot contain that prime (as it&#39;s over 100), so there is no c in S with gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. Therefore, S must not contain any pair a, b such that a + b is a prime between 101 and 200. Therefore, S must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 100} with the property that no two elements sum to a prime in 101-200.Additionally, condition (2) requires that for any two elements a, b in S, there exists a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) = 1. So for each pair a, b, there must be some element in S that is coprime to a + b. Since 1 is coprime to everything, if 1 is in S, then for any pair a, b, c = 1 would work. So if S includes 1, condition (2) is automatically satisfied. However, if S does not include 1, then we need to ensure that for each a + b, there&#39;s some element c in S that is coprime to a + b.Therefore, including 1 in S seems beneficial for satisfying condition (2). However, 1 can cause some issues with condition (3), but let&#39;s check. For any a, b in S, if 1 is in S, then for condition (3), when considering a and b, we need a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. If a + b is composite, then as we discussed, having primes in S helps. But if a + b is prime (and greater than 100), then 1 cannot help here because gcd(prime, 1) = 1. So 1 is useful for condition (2) but not for condition (3).But if 1 is in S, then for condition (3), we need another element c ≠ 1 such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. So maybe having 1 in S is okay, as long as we have other elements that can satisfy condition (3). However, if S includes 1 and all primes up to 100, then condition (3) is satisfied for composite sums, but for prime sums (in 101-200), we still need to exclude pairs a, b that sum to those primes.Therefore, perhaps the maximum S is the set containing 1 and all primes up to 100, but ensuring that no two primes in S sum to a prime in 101-200. Wait, but primes up to 100 can sum to primes in 101-200. For example, 97 is a prime in S, adding 97 + 4 = 101, which is a prime in 101-200. But 4 is not a prime. Wait, but 97 + 4 is 101, but 4 is not in S. If S is {1} ∪ primes up to 100, then the pairs a, b would be 1 and primes, or two primes. Let&#39;s check:If a and b are both primes in S, then a + b could be even (if a and b are both odd, which all primes except 2 are). So 2 is the only even prime. So if we have 2 in S, then adding 2 to another prime (which is odd) gives an odd number. But primes except 2 are odd, so adding two primes (both odd) gives an even number greater than 2, which is composite. So if a and b are both primes (excluding 2), their sum is even and composite (since it&#39;s at least 3 + 5 = 8). So gcd(a + b, 2) = 2, so c = 2 works for condition (3). If one of the primes is 2 and the other is a prime, then their sum is odd. If the sum is prime, it could be a prime in 101-200. For example, 2 + 97 = 99 (wait, 97 + 2 = 99, which is 99, which is composite). Wait, 97 + 2 = 99? No, 97 + 2 = 99? Wait, 97 + 2 is 99? Wait, no, 97 + 2 is 99? 97 + 2 is 99? Wait, 97 + 2 is 99? 97 + 2 = 99? That&#39;s not correct. 97 + 2 is 99? Wait, 97 + 2 = 99? Wait, 97 + 2 is actually 99? 90 + 9 is 99. Wait, 97 + 2 is 99. Yes, because 97 + 2 is 99. Wait, but 99 is 9*11, so composite. Therefore, even if you add 2 to another prime, the sum can be composite. So perhaps even when adding 2 to another prime, the sum is composite. Wait, 2 + 3 = 5 (prime), 2 + 5 = 7 (prime), 2 + 7 = 9 (composite). So in some cases, the sum is prime, but in others, it&#39;s composite. For example, 2 + 11 = 13 (prime), 2 + 13 = 15 (composite). So adding 2 to a prime can result in primes. For instance, 2 + 17 = 19, prime. 2 + 19 = 21, composite. So if a = 2 and b is a prime such that b + 2 is prime, then a + b is prime. For example, 2 + 17 = 19, which is prime, but 19 is less than 100. Wait, 19 is in S (if S includes primes up to 100). So in that case, since 19 is in S, then c = 19 would satisfy gcd(19, 19) = 19 &gt; 1. So even if a + b is a prime in S, then c can be that prime. Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied. However, if a + b is a prime not in S, i.e., primes between 101 and 200, then c cannot be that prime because it&#39;s not in S. Therefore, S must not contain pairs a and b such that a + b is a prime between 101 and 200.So if S includes 2 and primes up to 100, then pairs a, b where a = 2 and b is a prime such that 2 + b is a prime in 101-200 would be problematic. For example, if b is 97, then 2 + 97 = 99 (composite). If b is 89, 2 + 89 = 91 (composite). Wait, 89 + 2 = 91 = 7*13. So composite. 83 + 2 = 85 = 5*17. Composite. 79 + 2 = 81 = 9*9. Composite. 73 + 2 = 75. Composite. 71 + 2 = 73, which is prime but 73 is in S. So c = 73 works. Similarly, 67 + 2 = 69 (composite). 61 + 2 = 63 (composite). 59 + 2 = 61 (prime, 61 is in S). So c = 61. So even if a + b is prime but within S, then c can be that prime. The problem occurs only when a + b is a prime not in S, i.e., primes between 101 and 200. Therefore, in order for S to satisfy condition (3), S must not have any pairs a, b such that a + b is a prime in 101-200.Therefore, even if S includes 2 and all primes up to 100, we need to check if any two primes (including 2) sum to a prime in 101-200. Let&#39;s check some examples:Take the largest primes in S: 97, 89, 83, etc.97 + 89 = 186 (composite)97 + 83 = 180 (composite)97 + 2 = 99 (composite)89 + 83 = 172 (composite)Etc. It seems that adding two primes in S (which are all ≤ 100) can sum up to at most 97 + 89 = 186, which is less than 200. Wait, 97 + 89 = 186. So the maximum sum is 199 (if 100 were prime, but 100 is not prime). Wait, the maximum sum is 97 + 100 = 197, but 100 is not prime. So actually, the maximum sum of two elements in S (if S is primes up to 97 and 2) is 97 + 89 = 186. So primes between 101 and 200 are from 101 to 199. So the sums can reach up to 186, which is below 199. So primes between 101 and 186 may be problematic if they are achieved by the sum of two primes in S.For example, 101 is the first prime in 101-200. Is 101 achievable as a sum of two primes in S? Let&#39;s check. 101 = 2 + 99, but 99 is not prime. 101 = 3 + 98, 98 not prime. 5 + 96, nope. 7 + 94, nope. 11 + 90, nope. 13 + 88, nope. 17 + 84, nope. 19 + 82, nope. 23 + 78, nope. 29 + 72, nope. 31 + 70, nope. 37 + 64, nope. 41 + 60, nope. 43 + 58, nope. 47 + 54, nope. 53 + 48, nope. 59 + 42, nope. 61 + 40, nope. 67 + 34, nope. 71 + 30, nope. 73 + 28, nope. 79 + 22, nope. 83 + 18, nope. 89 + 12, nope. 97 + 4, nope. So 101 cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes in S (since S includes primes up to 97 and 2). Wait, but 101 is a prime. So actually, maybe 101 can be expressed as 2 + 99, but 99 is not prime. So no, there is no pair of primes in S that add to 101. Similarly, 103: similar attempts, 2 + 101, but 101 not in S. 3 + 100, nope. 5 + 98, nope. Etc. So primes in 101-200 cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes in S (since S&#39;s primes are all ≤97). Wait, except if 97 + 89 = 186, which is composite. So in fact, maybe there are no pairs in S (if S is the primes up to 97 and 2) that sum to a prime in 101-200. Therefore, such a set S would satisfy condition (3), because all sums a + b would either be composite (and hence have a factor in S) or primes ≤100 (which are in S, hence c exists). Additionally, condition (2) is satisfied because 1 is in S (if we include 1) or another element. Wait, but if S is just primes up to 97 and 2, but does not include 1, then for condition (2), for each pair a, b, we need a c in S coprime to a + b.But if S doesn&#39;t include 1, then we need to find a c in S that is coprime to a + b. For example, take a = 2 and b = 3. Then a + b = 5. Need a c in S such that gcd(5, c) = 1. So c can be any prime in S except 5. Since S includes all primes up to 97, there are plenty of such c. Similarly, a = 2 and b = 2 (but elements are distinct, so a and b must be different). So pairs of different primes. Their sum is either composite or prime. If prime, then c must be a different prime not dividing the sum. Wait, if a + b is a prime, then the primes in S other than that prime would be coprime to it. For example, a = 2, b = 3, sum = 5. Then c could be 7, which is coprime to 5. So condition (2) is satisfied. If a + b is composite, say 8 (2 + 6, but 6 is not in S). Wait, in S, if a and b are primes, their sum would be even (if both are odd) or odd (if one is 2). For even sums greater than 2, they are composite, so their prime factors are in S. For example, sum = 8 (2 + 6 not in S; but primes in S are 2, 3, 5, 7...). Wait, 3 + 5 = 8. So a = 3, b = 5. Then sum = 8. Then gcd(8, c) must be 1. So c could be 3, 5, 7, etc. For example, c = 7, gcd(8, 7) = 1. So condition (2) is satisfied. Also, for condition (3), since 8 is composite, and 2 is in S, gcd(8, 2) = 2 &gt; 1, so c = 2 works.Therefore, if S includes all primes up to 97 and 2, then conditions (2) and (3) are satisfied. However, we need to check if such a set S includes 1 or not. If we include 1, then condition (2) is automatically satisfied for all pairs, but we have to check if including 1 causes any issues with condition (3). For example, if we have 1 in S, then pairs involving 1: a = 1, b = prime p. Then a + b = p + 1. For condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(p + 1, c) &gt; 1. Since p is a prime, p + 1 is composite (except when p = 2, p + 1 = 3, which is prime). So for p = 2, 1 + 2 = 3. Then we need a c in S such that gcd(3, c) &gt; 1. If 3 is in S, then c = 3 works. Similarly, for p = 3, 1 + 3 = 4. Then c = 2 works. For p = 5, 1 + 5 = 6. Then c = 2 or 3 works. For p = 7, 1 + 7 = 8. c = 2 works. For p = 11, 1 + 11 = 12. c = 2 or 3 works. So as long as S contains 2 and 3 and other primes, then for pairs involving 1 and a prime, condition (3) is satisfied.Therefore, including 1 in S seems beneficial for condition (2) and doesn&#39;t harm condition (3). So S could be {1} ∪ primes up to 97. Let&#39;s count how many elements that would be. The primes up to 97 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. That&#39;s 25 primes. Including 1 gives 26 elements. But wait, is that the maximum?Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a larger set possible. Because if we include more numbers, maybe even some composites, as long as we don&#39;t create pairs that sum to primes in 101-200 and still satisfy both conditions.Alternatively, maybe the set of all even numbers? Let&#39;s see. If S is all even numbers from 1 to 100. But 1 is odd, so if we include 1, but the rest are even. Wait, let&#39;s check. If S includes all even numbers, then for any two even numbers a and b, their sum is even. Then for condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. Since a + b is even, and all elements in S are even, then gcd(a + b, c) is at least 2, so any c in S would work. So condition (3) is satisfied. For condition (2), we need a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) = 1. But since a + b is even and all elements in S are even, gcd(a + b, c) is at least 2. Therefore, there is no c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) = 1. Therefore, the set of all even numbers does not satisfy condition (2). Similarly, if S is all even numbers and 1, then for pairs of even numbers, their sum is even, so gcd(a + b, c) is at least 2 for all c in S except 1. Then for condition (2), we need a c in S such that gcd(a + b, c) = 1. Since 1 is in S, gcd(a + b, 1) = 1, so condition (2) is satisfied. But for pairs involving 1 and an even number, a = 1, b = even. Then a + b = odd. For condition (3), need a c in S such that gcd(odd, c) &gt; 1. Since S includes 1 and even numbers, the only candidates are even numbers. So gcd(odd, even) is 1 if the even number is 2, or gcd(odd, even) is 1 unless the even number shares a common factor with the odd sum. Wait, for example, if a + b = 1 + 2 = 3. Then we need a c in S such that gcd(3, c) &gt; 1. If S includes 2, 4, 6, etc., then gcd(3, c) is 1 for all even c except multiples of 3. So if S includes 6, then gcd(3, 6) = 3 &gt; 1. So if 6 is in S, then condition (3) is satisfied. Similarly, if a + b = 1 + 4 = 5, then we need c = 10, 15, etc., but if 10 is in S, then gcd(5, 10) = 5 &gt; 1. Therefore, if S includes even numbers that are multiples of various primes, then condition (3) can be satisfied. However, if S is all even numbers, then it includes 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. For each odd sum (from 1 + even), the odd sum can be 3, 5, 7, ..., 101. For each such odd sum, which is either prime or composite. If it&#39;s prime (like 3, 5, 7, ..., 101), then to satisfy condition (3), there must be a c in S such that gcd(prime, c) &gt; 1. Since c is even, gcd(prime, c) can be 1 or 2 if the prime is 2. So if the prime is 2, then c = 2 works. If the prime is odd, then gcd(odd prime, even c) = 1 unless c is a multiple of that prime. For example, sum = 3 (1 + 2). Then c must be a multiple of 3. If S includes 6, 12, 18, etc., then gcd(3, 6) = 3 &gt; 1. Similarly, sum = 5 (1 + 4). Need c = 10, 15, etc. If 10 is in S, then gcd(5, 10) = 5 &gt; 1. So if S includes all even numbers, then for each prime sum (3, 5, 7, ..., 101), there exists a multiple of that prime in S (since S includes all even numbers up to 100). For primes ≤100, their multiples (if even) are in S. For example, prime 3: multiple 6 is in S. Prime 5: 10 is in S. Prime 7: 14 is in S. Etc. However, for primes greater than 50, their even multiples would be greater than 100. For example, prime 53: 53*2=106, which is over 100, so not in S. So if a + b = 1 + 52 = 53 (prime). Then to satisfy condition (3), we need c in S such that gcd(53, c) &gt; 1. Since 53 is prime, c must be 53 or a multiple of 53. But 53 is odd and not in S (as S is even numbers). 106 is over 100. Therefore, there is no c in S such that gcd(53, c) &gt; 1. Hence, the pair (1, 52) would violate condition (3). Therefore, the set of all even numbers plus 1 does not satisfy condition (3) because pairs like (1, 52) sum to a prime (53) not in S and with no multiples in S. Therefore, such a set is invalid.Thus, including 1 and all even numbers doesn&#39;t work. Similarly, other composite numbers might cause issues. So perhaps the initial idea of using primes and 1 is better. But wait, primes plus 1 might still have issues. Wait, when we considered S as {1} ∪ primes up to 97, we need to check if all pairs a, b (including 1 and a prime) satisfy both conditions. For example, take a = 1 and b = 97. Then a + b = 98. For condition (2), need a c in S such that gcd(98, c) = 1. 98 factors into 2 * 7^2. So any c in S not divisible by 2 or 7. Since S includes 1 and primes, c = 1, 3, 5, 11, etc., which are coprime to 98. So condition (2) is satisfied. For condition (3), need a c in S such that gcd(98, c) &gt; 1. Since 2 and 7 are in S, c = 2 or 7 would work. So gcd(98, 2) = 2 &gt; 1. So condition (3) is satisfied.Another example: a = 1 and b = 2. Sum = 3. For condition (2), need c coprime to 3. c = 1, 2, 5, 7, etc. So okay. For condition (3), need c with gcd(3, c) &gt; 1. c = 3 works. So okay.Another example: a = 1 and b = 3. Sum = 4. For condition (2), need c coprime to 4. c = 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. For condition (3), need c with gcd(4, c) &gt; 1. c = 2 works.Another example: two primes, a = 3 and b = 5. Sum = 8. For condition (2), c coprime to 8: 3, 5, 7, etc. For condition (3), c = 2 works.Another example: a = 2 and b = 3. Sum = 5. For condition (2), c coprime to 5: 2, 3, 7, etc. For condition (3), c = 5 works.So in general, if S includes 1 and all primes up to 97, then for any pair a, b:- If a + b is composite, then there&#39;s a prime factor in S (since S includes all primes up to 97), so condition (3) is satisfied. For condition (2), 1 is there, or another prime not dividing the sum.- If a + b is prime, then either it&#39;s in S (so c = prime works for condition (3)) or it&#39;s a prime between 101 and 200. But as established earlier, in this set S, sums of two primes in S cannot reach primes above 100. Therefore, all sums a + b that are prime must be primes in S, hence condition (3) is satisfied. Condition (2) is satisfied because there are other primes in S that are coprime to the sum.Wait, but how do we know that sums a + b cannot be primes between 101 and 200? For example, if a = 1 and b = 100, but 100 is not in S (S is 1 and primes up to 97). Wait, if S includes 1 and primes up to 97, the maximum element is 97. So the maximum possible sum is 1 + 97 = 98, or 97 + 89 = 186. So primes between 101 and 200 can&#39;t be achieved by sums of two elements in S. Therefore, in this set, all sums a + b are either composite or primes ≤97. Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied because for composite sums, their prime factors are in S, and for prime sums, the prime is in S. Condition (2) is satisfied because 1 is in S, and 1 is coprime to everything. Therefore, this set S = {1} ∪ primes up to 97 satisfies both conditions (2) and (3).Now, how many elements does this set have? The primes below 100 are 25 primes (from 2 to 97). Adding 1 gives 26 elements. So |S| = 26.But the problem asks for the maximum such set. Is 26 the maximum? Maybe we can add more elements.Wait, let&#39;s think. Maybe some composite numbers can be added to S without violating the conditions. For example, suppose we add 4 to S. Let&#39;s check if S = {1, 2, 3, ..., primes up to 97, 4} satisfies the conditions.First, adding 4. Now, check pairs involving 4:- a = 4 and b = 1. Sum = 5. For condition (3), need c in S with gcd(5, c) &gt; 1. c = 5 works. For condition (2), need c coprime to 5. c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc. So okay.- a = 4 and b = 2. Sum = 6. For condition (3), c = 2, 3, or 6 (if in S). 2 and 3 are in S. For condition (2), c coprime to 6. c = 1, 5, 7, etc. So okay.- a = 4 and b = 3. Sum = 7. For condition (3), c = 7 works. For condition (2), c coprime to 7. c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. So okay.- a = 4 and b = 4: Not allowed, elements are distinct.- a = 4 and another composite number? Wait, S still has only 4 added. If we add more composites, need to check. But let&#39;s check if adding 4 is okay.But adding 4 might create pairs a, b where a + b is a prime in 101-200. For example, if we have 4 in S, and some other number c in S, such that 4 + c is a prime in 101-200. For instance, 4 + 97 = 101, which is a prime in 101-200. Therefore, if we include both 4 and 97 in S, then their sum is 101, which is a prime not in S. Therefore, for condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(101, c) &gt; 1. But 101 is prime and not in S, and no element in S is a multiple of 101 (since S includes numbers up to 100). Therefore, there is no such c. Therefore, adding 4 and 97 would create a pair that violates condition (3). Therefore, 4 cannot be added to S if 97 is in S.Therefore, to add 4 to S, we need to remove 97 to prevent the sum 4 + 97 = 101. But removing 97 would decrease the size of S by 1, and adding 4 would increase it by 1, so the total size remains 26. But maybe we can swap multiple elements. For example, remove 97 and add 4, remove 89 and add 6, etc. But then we have to check if those swaps don&#39;t cause other pairs to sum to primes in 101-200.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to include some composites without creating problematic pairs. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, instead of including 1 and all primes, maybe we can partition the numbers into two sets where sums are covered. But I need to think differently.Another approach: The problem resembles a problem where the set must be such that for every sum a + b, the set contains both numbers coprime to the sum and numbers sharing a factor with the sum. This is similar to a set that is both a multiplicative basis and an anti-chain in some gcd lattice. But I might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, think of the set S such that it contains 1 (to satisfy condition (2)) and all primes (to satisfy condition (3)), but need to avoid pairs summing to primes above 100. However, as we saw earlier, primes up to 97 when summed together can&#39;t reach primes above 100, except in cases where adding 1 to a prime gives a prime above 100. Wait, 1 + 97 = 98 (composite). 1 + 89 = 90 (composite). So even adding 1 to the largest primes in S doesn&#39;t reach primes in 101-200. So maybe 1 can be safely included. Hence, {1} ∪ primes up to 97 is safe.But if we try to add another prime, say 101, but it&#39;s over 100, so not allowed. So maximum primes in S are up to 97. 25 primes plus 1 is 26 elements. Can we add more numbers?Wait, let&#39;s check if there are composite numbers that can be added without creating pairs that sum to primes in 101-200. For example, adding 9. Let&#39;s check if 9 can be added. Then pairs involving 9:- 9 + 1 = 10 (composite). For condition (3), c = 2, 5 works. For condition (2), c = 1, 3, 7, etc.- 9 + 2 = 11 (prime). c = 11 is in S? If S includes 11, yes. Then condition (3) is satisfied. Condition (2) needs c coprime to 11, like 1, 2, 3, etc.- 9 + 3 = 12 (composite). c = 2, 3. Condition (3) ok. Condition (2) c = 5, 7, etc.- 9 + 4 = 13 (prime). If 4 is not in S, but if we added 9 and 4, then 9 + 4 = 13. But 13 is in S, so c = 13 works. However, if we haven&#39;t added 4, then 9 + 4 is not a pair in S.Wait, if we add 9 to S (original S is {1} ∪ primes up to 97), then pairs involving 9 are 9 and 1, 9 and 2, 9 and 3, ..., up to 9 and 97.But 9 is composite. Let&#39;s check if any pair (9, p) where p is a prime in S sums to a prime in 101-200.9 + p = prime. Let&#39;s see. The largest p is 97. 9 + 97 = 106 (composite). 9 + 89 = 98 (composite). 9 + 83 = 92 (composite). Etc. All these sums are even or composite. The next prime after 97 is 101, which would require p = 101 - 9 = 92, which is not prime. So adding 9 doesn&#39;t create any pair that sums to a prime in 101-200. Therefore, adding 9 is safe. Similarly, maybe other composite numbers can be added.Wait, let&#39;s verify 9 + 94 = 103 (prime), but 94 is not in S. So pairs in S are only with primes and 1. So 9 + primes:9 + 2 = 11 (prime, in S)9 + 3 = 12 (composite)9 + 5 = 14 (composite)9 + 7 = 16 (composite)...9 + 97 = 106 (composite)Therefore, the only sum that is prime is 9 + 2 = 11, which is in S. Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied because c = 11 is in S. Therefore, adding 9 is safe. Then, similarly, maybe other composite numbers can be added as long as their sums with primes in S do not result in primes outside S.For example, let&#39;s try adding 15. Check pairs 15 + p:15 + 2 = 17 (prime, in S)15 + 3 = 18 (composite)15 + 5 = 20 (composite)...15 + 97 = 112 (composite)All sums are either composite or primes in S. Therefore, adding 15 is safe. Similarly, adding 21:21 + 2 = 23 (prime, in S)21 + 3 = 24 (composite)21 + 5 = 26 (composite)...21 + 97 = 118 (composite)So safe. Similarly, adding 25:25 + 2 = 27 (composite)25 + 3 = 28 (composite)...25 + 97 = 122 (composite)No primes in sums. Therefore, adding 25 is safe.Wait, but is there a pattern here? If we add composite numbers that are odd, then adding them to 2 gives odd + 2, which could be prime. For example, 9 + 2 = 11 (prime), 15 + 2 = 17 (prime), 21 + 2 = 23 (prime), 25 + 2 = 27 (composite). So composites like 9, 15, 21, when added to 2, give primes that are in S. Therefore, these sums are okay because those primes are in S. Therefore, adding such composite numbers is safe.Similarly, even composite numbers: If we add 4, as before, 4 + 97 = 101, which is a prime not in S. So adding 4 is problematic. Similarly, adding 6: 6 + 97 = 103 (prime not in S). So adding even composites can create problematic sums. Therefore, even composites are risky, but odd composites may be safe.Wait, let&#39;s check adding 6. 6 + 97 = 103 (prime). So if we add 6 to S, then the pair (6, 97) sums to 103, which is a prime not in S, so condition (3) fails. Therefore, even composites are problematic when added with large primes. Therefore, to add even composites, we need to remove primes that would sum with them to primes in 101-200. But this might not be efficient.However, adding odd composites seems safe. For example, adding 9, 15, 21, etc. So let&#39;s try to add as many odd composites as possible.But we need to check two things:1. Adding the composite doesn&#39;t create a pair with an existing element (prime or 1) that sums to a prime in 101-200.2. The addition of the composite doesn&#39;t violate conditions (2) and (3) for existing pairs.First, for condition 1: As shown, adding odd composites like 9, 15, 21, etc., when added to primes in S, the sums are either composite or primes in S. For example, 9 + 2 = 11 (in S), 9 + 3 = 12 (composite), 9 + 5 = 14 (composite), etc. 15 + 2 = 17 (in S), 15 + 3 = 18 (composite), etc. Therefore, adding these odd composites is safe.For condition 2: When adding a composite number c, we need to ensure that for all pairs involving c, conditions (2) and (3) are satisfied.For example, take c = 9.For any a in S, pair (9, a):- Sum = 9 + a.For condition (2): There exists c&#39; in S such that gcd(9 + a, c&#39;) = 1.Since S contains 1, which is coprime to everything, condition (2) is satisfied.For condition (3): There exists c&#39;&#39; in S such that gcd(9 + a, c&#39;&#39;) &gt; 1.If 9 + a is composite, then it has a prime factor in S (since S contains all primes up to 97), so c&#39;&#39; can be that prime. If 9 + a is prime, then since 9 + a ≤ 9 + 97 = 106. Primes in this range are up to 97 and 101, 103. So 9 + a could be 11 (9 + 2), 17 (9 + 8, but 8 not in S), 23 (9 + 14, not in S). Wait, 9 + a is prime only if a is prime. For example, 9 + 2 = 11 (prime), which is in S. 9 + 4 = 13 (prime, but 4 is not in S). So the only prime sums would be 9 + primes in S. For example, 9 + 2 = 11, 9 + 3 = 12 (composite), 9 + 5 = 14 (composite), 9 + 7 = 16 (composite), 9 + 11 = 20 (composite), etc. Only 9 + 2 = 11 is prime. Since 11 is in S, for condition (3), c&#39;&#39; = 11 works. Therefore, adding 9 is safe.Similarly, adding 15:Sum with 2 is 17 (prime in S), other sums are composite. Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied.Therefore, adding odd composites that when added to 2 give a prime in S is safe. Therefore, we can add multiple such odd composites.So how many odd composites can we add?First, note that S already includes 1 and all primes up to 97. The odd composites not in S are numbers like 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, etc., up to 99.But we need to ensure that adding these numbers doesn&#39;t create a pair that sums to a prime in 101-200. However, since these composites are odd, adding them to another odd number (prime or composite) gives an even sum, which is composite (since it&#39;s at least 4). Adding them to 2 gives an odd sum, which might be prime or composite. But as we saw, adding them to 2 gives primes in S (like 9 + 2 = 11, 15 + 2 = 17, etc.), which is safe. Or composite (like 25 + 2 = 27), which is also safe.Therefore, adding any odd composite number is safe, as long as when added to 2, the sum is either a prime in S or a composite. For example, adding 25:25 + 2 = 27 (composite). So c&#39;&#39; can be 3 in S. gcd(27, 3) = 3 &gt; 1. So condition (3) is satisfied.Adding 27:27 + 2 = 29 (prime in S). So okay.Adding 33:33 + 2 = 35 (composite). gcd(35, 5 or 7) &gt; 1. 5 and 7 are in S.Therefore, in general, adding any odd composite number to S is safe, because:- For pairs with 2: sum is either prime in S or composite with factors in S.- For pairs with other primes or composites: sum is even (odd + odd) hence composite (if sum ≥4) or composite in case of odd + even.Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied because:- If the sum is composite, factors are in S.- If the sum is prime, it must be in S.Condition (2) is satisfied because 1 is in S, providing a coprime element.Therefore, in theory, we can add all odd composite numbers from 1 to 100 into S, along with the primes and 1. However, but wait, some odd composites when added to primes may sum to primes in 101-200.Wait, let&#39;s check. For example, take an odd composite number like 95 (which is 5*19). Adding 95 to a prime p in S:95 + p = sum. The sum ranges from 95 + 2 = 97 (prime in S) to 95 + 97 = 192 (composite). The sum 95 + p can be prime or composite. For example, 95 + 2 = 97 (prime in S). 95 + 3 = 98 (composite). 95 + 5 = 100 (composite). 95 + 7 = 102 (composite). ... 95 + 89 = 184 (composite). 95 + 97 = 192 (composite). The only prime sum is 97, which is in S. Therefore, adding 95 is safe.Another example, adding 93:93 + 2 = 95 (composite)93 + 3 = 96 (composite)...93 + 7 = 100 (composite)All sums are composite. So safe.Another example, adding 91:91 + 2 = 93 (composite)91 + 3 = 94 (composite)...91 + 11 = 102 (composite)All sums are composite. Safe.How about adding 87:87 + 2 = 89 (prime in S)87 + 3 = 90 (composite)...87 + 11 = 98 (composite)So 87 + 2 = 89 (prime in S). Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied because 89 is in S. So safe.Similarly, adding 85:85 + 2 = 87 (composite)85 + 3 = 88 (composite)...All sums are composite. Safe.Adding 81:81 + 2 = 83 (prime in S)81 + 3 = 84 (composite)...Safe.Adding 75:75 + 2 = 77 (composite)75 + 3 = 78 (composite)...Safe.Adding 69:69 + 2 = 71 (prime in S)69 + 3 = 72 (composite)...Safe.Adding 63:63 + 2 = 65 (composite)63 + 3 = 66 (composite)...Safe.Adding 57:57 + 2 = 59 (prime in S)57 + 3 = 60 (composite)...Safe.Adding 51:51 + 2 = 53 (prime in S)51 + 3 = 54 (composite)...Safe.Adding 45:45 + 2 = 47 (prime in S)45 + 3 = 48 (composite)...Safe.Adding 39:39 + 2 = 41 (prime in S)39 + 3 = 42 (composite)...Safe.Adding 33:33 + 2 = 35 (composite)33 + 3 = 36 (composite)...Safe.Adding 27:27 + 2 = 29 (prime in S)27 + 3 = 30 (composite)...Safe.Adding 21:21 + 2 = 23 (prime in S)21 + 3 = 24 (composite)...Safe.Adding 15:15 + 2 = 17 (prime in S)15 + 3 = 18 (composite)...Safe.Adding 9:9 + 2 = 11 (prime in S)9 + 3 = 12 (composite)...Safe.Adding 25:25 + 2 = 27 (composite)25 + 3 = 28 (composite)...Safe.Adding 35:35 + 2 = 37 (prime in S)35 + 3 = 38 (composite)...Safe.Adding 49:49 + 2 = 51 (composite)49 + 3 = 52 (composite)...Safe.Adding 55:55 + 2 = 57 (composite)55 + 3 = 58 (composite)...Safe.Adding 65:65 + 2 = 67 (prime in S)65 + 3 = 68 (composite)...Safe.Adding 77:77 + 2 = 79 (prime in S)77 + 3 = 80 (composite)...Safe.Adding 85:85 + 2 = 87 (composite)...Safe.Adding 91:91 + 2 = 93 (composite)...Safe.Adding 93:93 + 2 = 95 (composite)...Safe.Adding 95:95 + 2 = 97 (prime in S)...Safe.Adding 99:99 + 2 = 101 (prime not in S). Uh-oh! 99 + 2 = 101, which is a prime not in S. Therefore, adding 99 would create a pair (99, 2) with sum 101, which is a prime not in S. Therefore, for condition (3), we need a c in S such that gcd(101, c) &gt; 1, but 101 is prime and not in S. Therefore, adding 99 is problematic.Therefore, 99 cannot be added to S. Similarly, check other odd composites near 100:97 is already in S. 99 cannot be added. 95 can be added (as shown earlier). 93, 91, etc., are safe.So the problematic odd composites are those where composite + 2 is a prime in 101-200. For example, 99 + 2 = 101, 97 is already in S. 95 + 2 = 97 (in S). 93 + 2 = 95 (composite). 91 + 2 = 93 (composite). 89 + 2 = 91 (composite). So the only problematic odd composite is 99.Therefore, we can add all odd composites from 9 up to 95, excluding 99. How many are there?Odd composites between 1 and 100:The odd numbers from 1 to 100 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 99.Excluding 1 and primes (which are already in S), the odd composites are:9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, 51, 55, 57, 63, 65, 69, 75, 77, 81, 85, 87, 91, 93, 95, 99.Total number: Let&#39;s count them:1. 92. 153. 214. 255. 276. 337. 358. 399. 4510. 4911. 5112. 5513. 5714. 6315. 6516. 6917. 7518. 7719. 8120. 8521. 8722. 9123. 9324. 9525. 99So 25 odd composites. Excluding 99, we can add 24 odd composites.So original S has 26 elements (1 + 25 primes). Adding 24 odd composites gives 26 + 24 = 50 elements. But wait, adding 24 odd composites. Let&#39;s confirm the count.Primes up to 97: 25 primes.Adding 1: total 26.Odd composites (excluding 1 and primes): from 9 to 99, excluding primes. Total 25 numbers as listed above. Excluding 99: 24 numbers. Therefore, adding these 24 composites gives 26 + 24 = 50 elements.But wait, let&#39;s confirm:Original S: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., 97 (25 primes + 1 = 26)Odd composites to add: 9,15,21,25,27,33,35,39,45,49,51,55,57,63,65,69,75,77,81,85,87,91,93,95 (24 numbers)Total elements in new S: 26 + 24 = 50.Now, we need to verify if this set satisfies both conditions.First, condition (1): All elements are between 1 and 100. Check.Condition (2): For any two elements a, b, there exists c in S with gcd(a + b, c) = 1. Since 1 is in S, this is satisfied because gcd(a + b, 1) = 1.Condition (3): For any two elements a, b, there exists c in S with gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1. Let&#39;s verify.For any a, b in S, a + b can be:- If a and b are both primes:  - If they are both odd, their sum is even and composite (since it&#39;s at least 4). Then c = 2 works.  - If one is 2 and the other is odd prime, sum is odd. If the sum is prime, it&#39;s in S (since we saw earlier that sums like 2 + 97 = 99, composite; 2 + p where p is a prime in S gives sum ≤ 2 + 97 = 99, which is composite or prime in S). Wait, wait. If a = 2 and b is an odd prime, their sum is odd. Could this sum be a prime not in S?  For example, 2 + 89 = 91 (composite)  2 + 83 = 85 (composite)  2 + 79 = 81 (composite)  2 + 73 = 75 (composite)  2 + 71 = 73 (prime in S)  2 + 67 = 69 (composite)  2 + 61 = 63 (composite)  2 + 59 = 61 (prime in S)  2 + 53 = 55 (composite)  2 + 47 = 49 (composite)  2 + 43 = 45 (composite)  2 + 41 = 43 (prime in S)  2 + 37 = 39 (composite)  2 + 31 = 33 (composite)  2 + 29 = 31 (prime in S)  2 + 23 = 25 (composite)  2 + 19 = 21 (composite)  2 + 17 = 19 (prime in S)  2 + 13 = 15 (composite)  2 + 11 = 13 (prime in S)  2 + 7 = 9 (composite)  2 + 5 = 7 (prime in S)  2 + 3 = 5 (prime in S)  So in all cases, sums are either composite or primes in S. Therefore, for pairs involving 2 and another prime, condition (3) is satisfied because either the sum is composite (so has a factor in S) or the sum is a prime in S (so c = sum works).- If a and b are both odd composites:  Their sum is even (odd + odd = even), hence composite. Therefore, c = 2 works.- If a is odd composite and b is prime (excluding 2):  Sum is even (odd + odd) or a composite. If the prime is 2, then the sum is odd composite or prime in S. Wait, if a is odd composite and b is prime (not 2):  Sum = odd composite + odd prime = even, hence composite. Therefore, c = 2 works.- If a is odd composite and b is 2:  Sum = odd composite + 2 = odd. This sum could be prime or composite. For example, 9 + 2 = 11 (prime in S), 15 + 2 = 17 (prime in S), 25 + 2 = 27 (composite), etc. For prime sums, c = sum (prime in S) works. For composite sums, their factors are in S.Therefore, all pairs a, b in S satisfy condition (3).Thus, by adding all odd composites (except 99) to the original set {1} ∪ primes up to 97, we get a set S with 50 elements that satisfies all three conditions.But wait, let&#39;s check one example where a + b is a prime not in S. For instance, take a = 95 and b = 6. But 6 is not in S (since S contains odd composites and primes). Wait, S contains only 1, primes up to 97, and odd composites. So even numbers in S are only 2. So if we take a = 95 (odd composite) and b = 2, sum = 97 (prime in S). Then c = 97 works for condition (3). If a = 95 and b = 3, sum = 98 (composite). c = 2 works.Another example: a = 99 is not in S. a = 95 and b = 95: duplicates not allowed.Wait, S contains 1, 2, all primes up to 97, and odd composites except 99. So the only even number in S is 2. Therefore, pairs involving even numbers other than 2 are not possible. The only even number is 2. Therefore, the pairs are:- 2 and primes: sum handled as above.- 2 and odd composites: sum is odd, either prime in S or composite.- primes and primes: sum even (except when 2 is involved), composite.- primes and odd composites: sum even or prime in S.- odd composites and odd composites: sum even, composite.Therefore, in all cases, condition (3) is satisfied.Therefore, S with 50 elements seems to satisfy all conditions. But can we add more elements? The remaining elements in 1-100 not in S are even composites except 2 and 99 (which is odd). So even composites from 4, 6, 8, ..., 100 (excluding 2). There are 49 even composites (since 2 is in S, and numbers 4, 6, ..., 100 are 49 numbers). Adding any of these would risk creating a pair with another element summing to a prime in 101-200.For example, adding 4: pairs with 97 sum to 101, which is prime not in S. So 4 cannot be added.Adding 6: pairs with 97 sum to 103, prime not in S.Similarly, adding 8: 8 + 95 = 103.Adding 10: 10 + 91 = 101.Therefore, every even composite number x added to S can potentially pair with 101 - x, 103 - x, etc., which are primes not in S. Therefore, adding any even composite would require removing some primes from S to avoid these pairs, which would decrease the size of S, potentially leading to no net gain.Therefore, it&#39;s not beneficial to add even composites. Similarly, adding 99 is problematic as discussed.Therefore, the maximum size of S is 50 elements: 1, 2, 25 primes up to 97, and 24 odd composites.But wait, let&#39;s check the exact count:Primes up to 100: Let&#39;s list them to ensure there are 25 primes.Primes ≤100:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. That&#39;s 25 primes.Odd composites between 9 and 95 (excluding 99):As listed earlier, 24 numbers.1 (included), 2 (prime), 25 primes, 24 odd composites: total 1 + 1 + 25 + 24 = 51.Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 1 is included, primes are 25 numbers (including 2?), no.Wait, primes up to 97 are 25 numbers including 2. Then adding 1 and the 24 odd composites gives 1 + 25 + 24 = 50 elements. Yes, because primes already include 2. So S is:1 (element 1),25 primes (including 2),24 odd composites.Total 1 + 25 + 24 = 50.Yes, that&#39;s correct.But let me recount:- 1 element: {1}- 25 primes: 2,3,5,7,...,97- 24 odd composites: 9,15,21,...,95 (excluding 99)Total 1 +25 +24=50.Therefore, the maximum size of S is 50. However, I need to confirm that there are indeed 24 odd composites between 1 and 100 excluding primes and 1, 99.Total odd numbers from 1 to 100: 50 numbers (1,3,5,...,99).Number of primes: 25 (including 2, but 2 is even). Wait, primes between 1 and 100 are 25 primes, but 2 is the only even prime. Therefore, number of odd primes from 3 to 97: 24 primes.Therefore, odd numbers from 1 to 100:1 (neither prime nor composite),24 odd primes,25 odd composites.But wait, total odd numbers: 50.1 + 24 + 25 = 50.So there are 25 odd composites. But we excluded 99, so 24 odd composites.Therefore, yes, adding 24 odd composites to 1, 2, and 24 odd primes gives 1 + 1 + 24 + 24 = 50 elements. Wait, no:Wait, primes are 25 numbers: 2 (even) + 24 odd primes.So:- 1 (element 1)- 2 (prime)- 24 odd primes- 24 odd compositesTotal: 1 + 1 + 24 + 24 = 50.Yes.Therefore, the maximum size of S is 50.But wait, let me check an example. Suppose S includes 1, 2, all odd primes up to 97 (24 primes), and all odd composites except 99 (24 composites). Total 1 + 1 + 24 + 24 = 50. Now, check if this set satisfies all conditions.Take a pair of odd composites: their sum is even, hence composite. c = 2 works for condition (3). For condition (2), c = 1 works.Take a pair of odd composite and prime (excluding 2): sum is even (since odd + odd = even), composite. c = 2 works.Take a pair of odd composite and 2: sum is odd. If the sum is prime, it&#39;s in S (e.g., 9 + 2 = 11, 15 + 2 = 17). If composite, factors are in S.Take a pair of primes (excluding 2): sum is even, composite. c = 2 works.Take a pair of prime (excluding 2) and 2: sum is odd. If prime, it&#39;s in S. If composite, factors are in S.Take 1 and any other element: sum is element + 1. If composite, factors are in S. If prime, it&#39;s in S (since primes are up to 97, sum would be at most 1 + 97 = 98, which is composite). Wait, 1 + 97 = 98 (composite). 1 + 89 = 90 (composite). All sums of 1 and primes are composite, except when 1 + 1 = 2, but duplicates aren&#39;t allowed. Therefore, for pairs involving 1 and a prime p, sum = p + 1, which is composite (since p ≥ 2, p + 1 ≥ 3). For example, 1 + 2 = 3 (prime in S). 1 + 3 = 4 (composite). 1 + 5 = 6 (composite). etc. For sum = prime (like 1 + 2 = 3), c = 3 works. For composite sums, factors are in S.Therefore, all pairs satisfy both conditions.Therefore, the maximum size of S is 50.But wait, the problem states &quot;positive integers not exceeding 100&quot;. 100 is even composite, but we didn&#39;t include it. If we include 100, but 100 is even composite. Let&#39;s check if we can include 100.Adding 100 to S. Then pairs involving 100:- 100 + 1 = 101 (prime not in S). Therefore, need c in S such that gcd(101, c) &gt; 1. Impossible. Therefore, cannot include 100.Similarly, other even composites over 50 would sum with primes to over 100. For example, 98 + 3 = 101. But 98 is even composite not in S. So no.Thus, including even composites is not possible without violating condition (3).Therefore, the maximum size of S is indeed 50.But let me check online to see if this is a known problem. Wait, the problem is from &quot;Intermediate Mathematics&quot; Issue 4, 2004, so it&#39;s likely an Olympiad problem with a known solution. However, since I can&#39;t access external resources, I&#39;ll proceed with my reasoning.But to verify once more:Set S includes:- 1,- All primes up to 97 (25 primes: 2,3,5,7,...,97),- All odd composites from 9 to 95, excluding 99 (24 composites).Total elements: 1 + 25 + 24 = 50.This set satisfies:1. All elements are ≤100.2. For any a, b, 1 is in S, so gcd(a + b, 1) = 1.3. For any a, b, if a + b is composite, factors are in S; if prime, it&#39;s in S.Therefore, this set satisfies all conditions and has 50 elements.But I need to check if there isn&#39;t a larger possible set. Suppose there exists a set with more than 50 elements. For example, 51 elements. Since there are 50 odd numbers (1, primes, composites) and 49 even numbers (2 and composites), to get 51 elements, we must include at least one even composite. But as shown, adding even composites causes pairs that sum to primes over 100, violating condition (3). Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have more than 50 elements.Therefore, the maximum number of elements is 50.Final AnswerThe maximum number of elements in set ( S ) is boxed{50}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the maximum number of elements in a set ( S ) that satisfies the given conditions, we need to consider the following:1. Each element in ( S ) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.2. For any two different elements ( a ) and ( b ) in ( S ), there exists another element ( c ) in ( S ) such that (gcd(a + b, c) = 1).3. For any two different elements ( a ) and ( b ) in ( S ), there exists another element ( c ) in ( S ) such that (gcd(a + b, c) &gt; 1).Key steps leading to the solution:1. Including 1: The element 1 is included because it is coprime to any sum ( a + b ), satisfying condition (2).2. Including all primes up to 97: Primes are necessary to satisfy condition (3) for composite sums. Including all primes up to 97 ensures that any composite sum will have a prime factor in ( S ).3. Including odd composites: Odd composites can be added without creating pairs that sum to primes above 100. This is because adding an odd composite to another odd number (prime or composite) results in an even sum, which is composite. Adding an odd composite to 2 results in either a prime in ( S ) or a composite number with factors in ( S ).Detailed breakdown:- Primes up to 97: There are 25 primes (including 2).- Odd composites from 9 to 95: There are 24 odd composites (excluding 99, which sums with 2 to 101, a prime not in ( S )).- Element 1: Included to satisfy condition (2).The set ( S ) is constructed as follows:- 1 (element 1)- 25 primes (2, 3, 5, 7, ..., 97)- 24 odd composites (9, 15, 21, ..., 95)Total elements: ( 1 + 25 + 24 = 50 ).Verification:- Condition (2): Satisfied by 1, which is coprime to all sums.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-1d99925a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-1d99925a><span class="icon" data-v-1d99925a>🔑:</span>Construct 50 arrays: (1,100),(2,99), cdots,(50,51), the sum of the two numbers in each array is 101.Since 101 is a prime number, there does not exist an element c in S such that the greatest common divisor of 101 and c is greater than 1.

Hmm, periods. Let me recall what that means. The period of a function is the smallest positive number T for which the function repeats itself. So, basically, the length of one full cycle of the function. For basic trigonometric functions like sine and cosine, the period is 2π. But here we have cos squared x minus sin squared x. That seems like a combination of squared terms. Maybe I can simplify this expression first?Wait, I remember there&#39;s a trigonometric identity that relates cos²x - sin²x to something else. Let me think. Oh! Isn&#39;t that the double-angle identity for cosine? Let me check. Yes, cos(2x) = cos²x - sin²x. So, actually, this function y is equal to cos(2x). So, if I can rewrite the original function as cos(2x), then I can easily find its period.Okay, so if y = cos(2x), then the standard cosine function has a period of 2π, but when the argument is multiplied by a constant, the period changes. The general formula for the period of cos(kx) is 2π divided by |k|. In this case, k is 2. So, the period should be 2π divided by 2, which is π. Therefore, the period of y = cos²x - sin²x is π.But wait, let me make sure I didn&#39;t skip any steps or make a mistake in the identity. Let me verify that cos²x - sin²x is indeed equal to cos(2x). Starting with the double-angle identity: cos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b. If a = b = x, then cos(2x) = cos²x - sin²x. Yep, that&#39;s correct. So substituting the original function with cos(2x) is valid.Therefore, since the original function simplifies to cos(2x), its period is π. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. If I didn&#39;t remember the identity, could I figure out the period by analyzing the original function?The original function is y = cos²x - sin²x. Let&#39;s consider the periods of cos²x and sin²x individually. Both cos²x and sin²x have periods of π, right? Because squaring the cosine or sine function effectively folds the negative part of the wave onto the positive part, so instead of taking 2π to complete a full cycle, it takes π. So cos²x has a period of π and sin²x also has a period of π. Therefore, when you subtract these two functions, which both have period π, the resulting function should also have a period of π. Unless there&#39;s some interaction between them that might create a longer period, but since both components repeat every π, their combination should too.But maybe I should check if there&#39;s a smaller period. The period of the function is the smallest positive T such that y(x + T) = y(x) for all x. Let&#39;s suppose that T is the period. Then:cos²(x + T) - sin²(x + T) = cos²x - sin²x.If T is π, then substituting:cos²(x + π) - sin²(x + π) = [cos(x + π)]² - [sin(x + π)]².But cos(x + π) = -cosx and sin(x + π) = -sinx. So, [ -cosx ]² - [ -sinx ]² = cos²x - sin²x, which matches the original function. Therefore, T = π works.What if we try T = π/2? Let&#39;s check:cos²(x + π/2) - sin²(x + π/2) = [cos(x + π/2)]² - [sin(x + π/2)]².But cos(x + π/2) = -sinx and sin(x + π/2) = cosx. So substituting:(-sinx)² - (cosx)² = sin²x - cos²x = -(cos²x - sin²x) = -y(x).Which is not equal to y(x), unless y(x) = 0, which isn&#39;t always the case. Therefore, T = π/2 is not a period here. So, the period can&#39;t be smaller than π, which confirms that π is indeed the fundamental period.Alternatively, if I graph the function y = cos²x - sin²x, it should look like a cosine wave with double the frequency, i.e., period π. Let me visualize. The standard cosine function has peaks at 0, 2π, etc., and troughs at π, 3π, etc. If we compress it by a factor of 2, the peaks would be at 0, π, 2π, etc., and troughs at π/2, 3π/2, etc. So, the function y = cos(2x) completes a full cycle between 0 and π, which matches the period we found.Therefore, after verifying through multiple methods—using trigonometric identities, considering the periods of the individual components, and checking the periodicity by substitution—it&#39;s clear that the period of the given function is π.Final AnswerThe period of the function is boxed{pi}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the period of the function ( y = cos^2 x - sin^2 x ), we start by recognizing the trigonometric identity. The given function can be simplified using the double-angle identity for cosine:[cos(2x) = cos^2 x - sin^2 x]Thus, the function ( y = cos^2 x - sin^2 x ) is equivalent to ( y = cos(2x) ).The period of the standard cosine function ( cos(kx) ) is ( frac{2pi}{|k|} ). For ( cos(2x) ), the value of ( k ) is 2. Therefore, the period is:[frac{2pi}{2} = pi]To verify, we consider the periods of ( cos^2 x ) and ( sin^2 x ), both of which have periods of ( pi ). Since both components repeat every ( pi ), their combination will also repeat every ( pi ). Checking the periodicity by substitution confirms that the function ( cos(2x) ) indeed has a period of ( pi ).Thus, the period of the function ( y = cos^2 x - sin^2 x ) is (boxed{pi}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the period of the function y = cos²x - sin²x. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the period of a function means. The period is the smallest positive number T for which the function repeats itself. That is, y(x + T) = y(x) for all x. Now, the function given is cos squared x minus sin squared x. I remember there are some trigonometric identities that might simplify this expression. Let me think. Oh yeah, the double-angle identity for cosine! Cos²x - sin²x is equal to cos(2x). Let me verify that. The identity is cos(2x) = cos²x - sin²x. Yes, that&#39;s right. So actually, the given function simplifies to cos(2x). That makes things easier because I know the basic cosine function, cos(x), has a period of 2π. But here, the argument of the cosine is 2x instead of x. So how does that affect the period?I recall that for a function like cos(kx), the period is 2π divided by the absolute value of k. So in this case, k is 2. Therefore, the period should be 2π / 2 = π. Let me check that.If the period of cos(x) is 2π, then if we replace x with 2x, the graph of the function will be compressed horizontally by a factor of 2. That compression would make the period half as long, so 2π / 2 = π. So that makes sense. But just to be thorough, let me test the period. Suppose the period is π. Then cos[2(x + π)] should equal cos(2x + 2π). But cos(2x + 2π) is the same as cos(2x) because cosine has a period of 2π. So yes, adding π to x results in adding 2π to the argument of the cosine function, which brings us back to the original value. Therefore, π is indeed the period. Is there a smaller period than π? Let&#39;s see. Suppose there is a period T such that 0 &lt; T &lt; π. Then, cos[2(x + T)] = cos(2x + 2T) should equal cos(2x) for all x. This implies that 2T must be a multiple of the period of cosine, which is 2π. Therefore, 2T = 2πn for some integer n. So T = πn. Since we are looking for the smallest positive T, n must be 1. Thus, the smallest period is π. Therefore, even if we consider possible smaller periods, it&#39;s not possible because T has to be a multiple of π, and π is the smallest positive one. So, putting it all together, the original function y = cos²x - sin²x simplifies to cos(2x), which has a period of π. Therefore, the period of the given function is π.Final AnswerThe period of the function is boxed{pi}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the period of the function ( y = cos^2 x - sin^2 x ), we start by simplifying the expression using a trigonometric identity. Recall the double-angle identity for cosine:[cos(2x) = cos^2 x - sin^2 x]Thus, the given function simplifies to ( y = cos(2x) ). Next, we determine the period of ( cos(2x) ). The period of the basic cosine function ( cos(x) ) is ( 2pi ). For a function of the form ( cos(kx) ), the period is given by ( frac{2pi}{|k|} ). Here, ( k = 2 ), so the period is:[frac{2pi}{2} = pi]To verify, we check if adding ( pi ) to ( x ) results in the same function value. For any ( x ):[cos(2(x + pi)) = cos(2x + 2pi) = cos(2x)]This confirms that the period is indeed ( pi ). Checking for a smaller period, we find that any period ( T ) must satisfy ( 2T = 2pi n ) for some integer ( n ), leading to ( T = pi n ). The smallest positive ( T ) is ( pi ).Thus, the period of the function ( y = cos^2 x - sin^2 x ) is (boxed{pi}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-1d99925a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-1d99925a><span class="icon" data-v-1d99925a>🔑:</span>According to the double-angle formula for cosine, we can rewrite the expression for y = cos^2 x - sin^2 x as y = cos 2x.
