Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, the chairs are arranged in a circle. Let&#39;s say there are a total of C chairs in the circle. So initially, n chairs are occupied, and C - n chairs are empty. The condition is that any empty chair must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. That way, if someone new comes in, no matter where they sit (on an empty chair), they will be next to at least one of the original n people.Wait, but the problem says &quot;they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So this means that every empty chair must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Otherwise, if there&#39;s an empty chair that&#39;s not adjacent to any occupied chairs, the new person could sit there and not be next to anyone. So the problem reduces to placing n people around a circle such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then the minimal n is what we need to find.This sounds similar to a domination problem in graph theory, where each node (chair) is either occupied or adjacent to an occupied node. The minimal number of occupied nodes needed to dominate the graph. In this case, the graph is a cycle (circle) with C nodes. But here, the number of chairs isn&#39;t specified, so we need to consider that the circle could have any number of chairs. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the chairs are fixed? Wait, the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot;Wait, is the number of chairs fixed? The problem doesn&#39;t specify. Hmm. Wait, maybe the chairs are arranged in a circle, but the number of chairs is arbitrary? Or is it that we need to determine n such that, regardless of how the chairs are arranged in a circle (with possibly different numbers of chairs), n people are seated such that any new person must sit next to someone?Wait, perhaps the problem is about a circle with some number of chairs, and we need to seat n people in such a way that all remaining chairs are adjacent to at least one occupied chair. So the minimal n for that arrangement. But the problem is likely about the minimal n such that in any arrangement of chairs in a circle, placing n people in some way would force the next person to sit next to someone. Hmm, but the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So it&#39;s not about any arrangement, but a specific arrangement. So the chairs are in a circle, and we need to arrange n people (i.e., choose n chairs out of the total chairs in the circle) such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then the minimal n is the answer.But here&#39;s the thing: the number of chairs in the circle isn&#39;t given. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the circle has infinitely many chairs? But that doesn&#39;t make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the minimal n such that for any number of chairs, arranging n people in some way would cover all empty chairs adjacent to them. But that also seems vague.Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the concept of &quot;covering&quot; all seats with people such that every empty seat is adjacent to a person. In graph theory terms, this is a dominating set problem on a cycle graph. The minimal dominating set for a cycle graph with C vertices is known. For a cycle graph with C vertices, the domination number is ⌈C/3⌉. So if we have C chairs arranged in a circle, the minimal number of people needed to dominate all chairs (i.e., every empty chair is adjacent to a person) is ⌈C/3⌉.But the problem here is not given a specific number of chairs, but rather asking for the minimal n such that when you arrange n people in a circle of chairs (of some number), then any new person must sit next to someone. Wait, but maybe the chairs are fixed, and the question is about the minimal n for that circle. But the problem is stated as:&quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is qquad&quot;Wait, maybe it&#39;s a standard problem where the number of chairs is not fixed, but n is the minimal number such that however you arrange n people around some circle of chairs, the next person has to sit next to someone. But that interpretation is unclear.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a circle with a certain number of chairs, and the minimal n such that the remaining chairs are all adjacent to at least one occupied chair. But without knowing the total number of chairs, how can we compute n? So perhaps the problem is missing some information? Wait, maybe the problem is from a competition where the number of chairs is equal to the number of people? Wait, no.Wait, let me check the original problem again: &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is qquad&quot;Hmm, perhaps the chairs are arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is n+1. So, when the n people are seated, there is one empty chair. But then, when the (n+1)th person comes, they have to sit next to someone. Wait, but if there&#39;s only one empty chair, then that person has to sit there, and whether they are next to someone depends on the arrangement. Hmm, but that might not be the case.Alternatively, the chairs are in a circle, and there are more chairs than n. So we have a circle with, say, C chairs, n of which are occupied. The condition is that any of the C - n empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the minimal n such that, for some C, n people can be arranged in a circle of C chairs with all empty chairs adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then, the minimal n is desired. Wait, but if the circle can be as large as needed, then n can be as small as 1, because if there&#39;s 1 person in a circle of 3 chairs, then the two empty chairs are adjacent to the occupied one. But when the next person comes, they have to sit in one of the two empty chairs, both adjacent to the original person. But if we have a circle of 4 chairs, with 1 person, then two chairs are adjacent, but the chair opposite is not adjacent. So in that case, someone could sit opposite and not be adjacent. Therefore, the answer depends on the number of chairs.But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs. Therefore, maybe the problem is in the style of a classic puzzle where chairs are arranged in a circle, and you need to place n people so that every empty chair is adjacent to someone, with the minimal n. The classic problem here is that the minimal number is ceiling of C/3, but again, since the number of chairs isn&#39;t given, maybe the problem is referring to a specific case. Wait, but the answer is likely 2014 divided by something? Wait, the problem is labeled 1.2014. Maybe that&#39;s just the problem number, 1 from 2014? Maybe from an exam?Alternatively, maybe the problem is from the 2014 year, but the problem is presented here as problem 1. Anyway, perhaps the answer is 674, since 2014 divided by 3 is approximately 671.3, ceiling is 672? Wait, but 2014 /3 is 671.333..., so ceiling is 672. But if the problem is about a circle with 2014 chairs, the minimal n is 672. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify 2014 chairs, only labeled as problem 1.2014, perhaps the answer is boxed{672}? But that&#39;s just a guess.Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let&#39;s consider that the problem is asking for the minimal n such that in a circle (with any number of chairs), if you place n people, then any additional person must sit next to someone. Wait, but that&#39;s impossible unless the circle has exactly n+1 chairs. For example, if you have n people sitting with one chair between each, then the next person has to sit between two people. But if there are more chairs, then maybe there&#39;s a spot far away.Wait, perhaps the problem is about a circle with n chairs, and when one more person arrives, they have to sit next to someone, meaning that all chairs are occupied except one, which is adjacent to an occupied chair. But that would mean n-1 chairs are occupied, leaving one chair, which is adjacent to two people. Wait, but in that case, the minimal n would be 3. If you have 3 chairs, with 2 people sitting, the empty chair is between them, so the next person has to sit there, adjacent to both. But if you have 4 chairs, with 3 people sitting, leaving one chair, which is adjacent to two people. But if the chairs are arranged in a circle, and you have n chairs with n-1 people, then the empty chair is adjacent to two people, so the next person would be adjacent to two people. But the problem says &quot;they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; Wait, n is the number of original people. Wait, if n is 3 in a 4-chair circle, then when the 4th person sits, they are next to two original people. But maybe the problem is about having n original people such that no matter where the next person sits, they are adjacent to someone. So in that case, all chairs except the ones adjacent to the original n people are already occupied? Wait, this is confusing.Wait, let&#39;s try small cases. Let&#39;s consider a circle with chairs. Let&#39;s say there are C chairs. We need to place n people so that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then the minimal n is the domination number of the cycle graph C_C, which is known to be ⌈C/3⌉. So if the problem is about a specific number of chairs, like 2014 chairs, the answer would be ⌈2014/3⌉ = 672. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs. Wait, the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So perhaps the chairs are arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is n+1? Because if there are n people, and one more person comes, then there must be n+1 chairs? But in that case, the minimal n would be 2. Wait, if you have two people sitting opposite each other in a circle of 3 chairs, then the third chair is adjacent to both, so the next person has to sit there. But if the circle has 4 chairs, and you have two people sitting opposite each other, then there are two empty chairs, each adjacent to one person. So the next person could sit in either chair, adjacent to one person. But if you have three chairs, with two people, the empty chair is adjacent to both. So in that case, n=2. But the problem is asking for the minimal n such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. So if chairs are arranged in a circle with n+1 chairs, then n people are seated such that the remaining chair is adjacent to at least one person. But in that case, n could be 1. If you have two chairs, one person is sitting, the other chair is adjacent (since it&#39;s a circle), so the next person has to sit next to the original person. But maybe the problem is considering a larger number.Wait, perhaps the problem is about the number of people required such that in any configuration of chairs, but that seems not. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that chairs are placed around a circle, and you need to seat n people so that the maximum distance between any two people is two chairs. Then, the next person has to sit next to someone. So in that case, the minimal n would be the ceiling of total chairs divided by 3. But again, without knowing the number of chairs, it&#39;s impossible to answer. Therefore, the problem must have a specific number of chairs, perhaps implied by the problem number 1.2014. Maybe from the 2014 AMC 10A or something, but I don&#39;t recall. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 674, which is 2014 divided by 3, but rounded up. 2014 divided by 3 is 671.333..., so ceiling is 672. So boxed{672}? That seems plausible.But to confirm, let&#39;s think again. If we have a circle with C chairs, and we want to place n people such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. The minimal n is called the domination number, which for a cycle graph is ⌈C/3⌉. Therefore, if the problem is about a circle with 2014 chairs, the minimal n is 2014 divided by 3, rounded up, which is 672. However, the problem statement doesn&#39;t mention 2014 chairs. Wait, the problem is labeled &quot;1.2014&quot;, which might be problem number 1 from the year 2014, but the actual problem content doesn&#39;t specify 2014 chairs. So perhaps the answer is the general solution. Wait, no, the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle... Then the minimum value of n is&quot; So maybe the answer is 3? If you have 3 people in a circle of 4 chairs, each separated by one chair, then the empty chair is adjacent to two people. But if you have a circle with 6 chairs, you need 2 people to dominate all chairs. Wait, no. If you have 6 chairs, placing people every 3 chairs would leave gaps. Wait, for 6 chairs, the domination number is 2, since you can place two people opposite each other, and their neighbors are covered. Wait, no. For 6 chairs, the domination number is 2. Let&#39;s see: if you place people at chairs 1 and 4, then chair 2 is adjacent to 1, chair 3 is adjacent to 4, chair 5 is adjacent to 4, chair 6 is adjacent to 1. So yes, domination number is 2. But if chairs are 5, then domination number is 2 as well. Wait, domination number formula for cycle graphs is indeed ⌈C/3⌉. For C=6, 6/3=2, so 2. For C=5, 5/3≈1.666, ceiling is 2. For C=4, 4/3≈1.333, ceiling is 2. For C=3, ceiling(3/3)=1. So for C=3, n=1. If you have a circle of 3 chairs, one person seated, the other two chairs are adjacent to the occupied chair. So if someone comes in, they have to sit next to the original person. So in that case, n=1. But for C=4 chairs, the domination number is 2. If you have 2 people seated opposite each other, the other two chairs are each adjacent to a person. So the next person has to sit next to someone. So for C=4, n=2.But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs. If the problem is from a competition where the number of chairs is 2014, then the answer would be 672. But the problem statement here, as given, just says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle... Then the minimum value of n is.&quot; Maybe the problem is translated from Chinese, and &quot;1.2014&quot; is the problem number, and the actual question is general. Wait, no. If that&#39;s the case, the answer would depend on the number of chairs, which isn&#39;t specified, making the problem ill-posed. Unless the number of chairs is n+1, but even then, it&#39;s unclear.Wait, another interpretation: the chairs are arranged in a circle, and there are infinitely many chairs. Then, placing n people such that any new person must sit next to one of them. But in an infinite circle, you can&#39;t dominate all chairs with finite n. So that&#39;s impossible.Alternatively, the problem is about a finite circle where the number of chairs is such that when you add one more person, the total becomes n+1. Wait, but again, without specifics, it&#39;s hard.Wait, let&#39;s consider that when the new person sits down, they have to be adjacent to at least one of the original n people, regardless of where they sit. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. So the problem reduces to finding the minimal n such that the domination number for a cycle graph with C chairs is n, and we need the minimal n across all possible C. But the minimal domination number for any cycle graph is 1 (when C=3), but since the problem asks for the minimal n such that this condition holds, perhaps n=1? But if C=4, n=1 is not enough. If C=4, with one person, then there are three empty chairs. Two of them are adjacent to the person, but the chair opposite is not. Therefore, someone could sit opposite and not be adjacent. Therefore, n=1 is insufficient for C=4. So maybe the problem is asking for the minimal n such that for any C, arranging n people in some way will cover all chairs? But that&#39;s impossible because as C increases, the domination number increases as well.Alternatively, the problem is asking for the minimal n such that there exists a circle where n people are seated, and any additional person must sit next to someone. In that case, the minimal n is 1, as in a circle of 3 chairs with 1 person, any new person has to sit next to them. But if the circle is larger, like 4 chairs, then n=1 is insufficient. Therefore, if the problem allows us to choose the number of chairs, then the minimal n is 1. But the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, so perhaps we can choose the number of chairs. If we can choose a circle with 3 chairs, then n=1 suffices. However, if the circle must have at least n+1 chairs, then for n=1, chairs=2, but in a circle of 2 chairs, if one is occupied, the other is adjacent, so the next person has to sit next to them. Wait, in a circle of 2 chairs, with one person, the other chair is adjacent, so yes. So n=1 works for C=2. Then n=1 is possible. But maybe the problem implies more than a certain number of chairs. If the problem is from a specific competition, perhaps with standard answer 3 or something. But in the absence of specific information, it&#39;s ambiguous.Wait, perhaps the problem is in Chinese, and &quot;1.2014&quot; is the problem number, like problem 1 from the 2014 contest, and the actual problem might have a figure or specific number of chairs. But since it&#39;s presented here as &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle...&quot;, with no specific number, it&#39;s unclear.Alternatively, maybe the problem is from the 2014 Chinese Mathematical Olympiad, and the answer is 672. If the number of chairs is 2014, then the minimal n is 672. Given that the problem is labeled 1.2014, maybe it&#39;s problem 1 from 2014, and the answer is 672. So I think the answer is 672.Final Answerboxed{672}&lt;/think&gt;The problem requires finding the minimum number of people ( n ) such that when arranged in a circle of chairs, any additional person must sit next to one of the original ( n ) people. This is equivalent to ensuring every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair, which relates to the domination number in graph theory.For a cycle graph ( C ) with ( C ) vertices (chairs), the domination number (minimum number of vertices needed to cover all others) is given by ( lceil frac{C}{3} rceil ). However, the problem does not specify the number of chairs, but it is labeled as problem 1.2014, suggesting it might be from a 2014 competition. Given the problem number and common practices in mathematical competitions, it is inferred that the number of chairs is 2014. The domination number for a cycle graph with 2014 chairs is calculated as follows:[lceil frac{2014}{3} rceil = lceil 671.333ldots rceil = 672]Thus, the minimum value of ( n ) is (boxed{672}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of people, n, that I have to place around a circle of chairs such that when an additional person comes to sit down, they have to sit next to one of the original n people. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to visualize this.First, the chairs are arranged in a circle. Let&#39;s say there are a total of C chairs. The problem isn&#39;t specifying the total number of chairs, but maybe it&#39;s implied that the chairs are arranged in a circle with enough spaces between the original n people so that the new person can&#39;t find a spot that&#39;s not adjacent to any of them. Wait, but actually, the problem says that when one more person sits down, they will *always* sit next to one of the original n people. So, regardless of where the new person chooses to sit, they have to be adjacent to at least one of the original n people. Therefore, the original n people must be placed in such a way that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. That sounds like covering all the empty chairs with the adjacency condition.So, if the chairs are in a circle, and we have n people sitting, the remaining chairs (which are C - n) must all be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum n such that every empty chair is adjacent to an occupied one. This is similar to a domination problem in graph theory, where each node (chair) is either occupied or adjacent to an occupied node. So, the minimum number of people needed to dominate the circular chair arrangement.But since the number of chairs isn&#39;t specified, maybe we need to consider that the chairs are infinitely many? Wait, no. The problem says &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, so maybe the number of chairs is finite but arbitrary? Wait, no, the problem is asking for the minimum n such that when one more person sits down, they have to sit next to one of the original n. So, regardless of the number of chairs? Hmm, maybe I&#39;m overcomplicating.Wait, perhaps the chairs are already arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is fixed. Then, we need to seat n people in such a way that the remaining chairs are all adjacent to at least one occupied chair. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs. Wait, maybe the problem is in the style of a classic combinatorics problem where you need to cover all possible seats with adjacency. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe the chairs are arranged in a circle with some number of chairs, and we need to choose positions for n people such that every other chair is adjacent to at least one person. Then, the minimum n required would depend on the total number of chairs. However, the problem doesn&#39;t mention the total number of chairs, which is confusing. Wait, maybe the problem is considering an infinite number of chairs arranged in a circle? That seems odd.Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to placing people such that there are no two empty chairs in a row. Because if there are two empty chairs in a row, then someone could sit in the middle of those two and not be adjacent to anyone. But in a circle, the arrangement would need to prevent any such occurrence. Therefore, to ensure that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair, we need to place people such that no two empty chairs are adjacent. Wait, no. If two empty chairs are adjacent, then the chairs next to them must be occupied. Wait, maybe I need to model this.Suppose we have chairs arranged in a circle. If we place people such that between every two people, there&#39;s at most one empty chair. Then, if someone tries to sit in the empty chair, they will be adjacent to at least one person. However, if between two people there are two empty chairs, then a person could sit in the middle of those two empty chairs, which would be adjacent to two empty chairs, not next to any person. So, to prevent that, the maximum number of empty chairs between any two people should be 1. Therefore, the spacing between people is at most one chair. That way, every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair.In that case, the number of people required would be equal to the number of chairs divided by 2, rounded up. But since it&#39;s a circle, the number of chairs is such that n people are placed with at most one chair between them. Wait, if we have n people, then the number of chairs would be n + (number of empty chairs). Since each person can have at most one empty chair between them, the maximum number of empty chairs is n. So, total chairs would be 2n. Therefore, to cover 2n chairs with n people, each separated by one empty chair. But if there are more chairs than 2n, then we might have gaps. But the problem states &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, which might mean that the number of chairs is fixed? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous.Wait, maybe the problem is not about fixed chairs but about placing n people in chairs arranged in a circle (with as many chairs as needed) such that any new person must sit adjacent to an existing person. So, the chairs are implicitly considered to be the minimum number required to seat the n people with the condition that all other chairs (which could be infinite?) are adjacent to at least one person. But that seems too vague.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the chairs as discrete seats. So, if you have a circle with some number of seats, and you place n people on them such that every empty seat is adjacent to at least one occupied seat. Then, the minimum n would be the domination number for a cycle graph. The domination number of a cycle graph with m vertices is known to be ⌈m/3⌉. But here, the problem is reversed. We need to find the minimum n such that all remaining seats are dominated. So, if we have m seats, then the domination number γ(C_m) = ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if we set n = ⌈m/3⌉, then the remaining m - n seats are dominated. But the problem is asking for the minimum n such that when another person sits down, they have to sit next to someone. So, regardless of the number of seats, the n is minimal such that in any arrangement of chairs (maybe the chairs are as many as needed?), but this is unclear.Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to a problem where you have a circle, and you want to place the minimum number of people so that any new person has to sit next to someone. So, in other words, there are no three consecutive empty chairs. Because if there are three consecutive empty chairs, a person could sit in the middle one and not be adjacent to anyone. Therefore, to prevent that, you need to ensure that between any two people, there are at most two empty chairs. Wait, no. If there are two empty chairs between people, then someone could sit in the middle of those two, which would be adjacent to two empty chairs. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s see.If you have two empty chairs between two people, like P-E-E-P, then if someone sits in the middle empty chair, they are adjacent to one person on one side and an empty chair on the other. Wait, no. If the chairs are arranged in a circle, and you have a sequence of P-E-E-P, then the middle empty chair is adjacent to an empty chair on one side and a person on the other. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think linearly first. Suppose we have a line of chairs: P-E-E-P. If someone sits in the first E, they are next to P. If they sit in the second E, they are next to the other P. So, actually, even with two empty chairs between people, any chair in between is adjacent to at least one person. Wait, but if there are three empty chairs between two people: P-E-E-E-P. Then the middle E is adjacent to two Es and not adjacent to any P. So, someone could sit there without being adjacent to anyone. Therefore, to prevent that, there must be at most two empty chairs between any two people. Therefore, the maximum number of empty chairs between two people is two. So, the spacing is at most two chairs. Therefore, for a circle, if we have n people, the number of chairs would be n + k, where k is the number of empty chairs. Each gap between people can have at most two empty chairs. So, the total number of chairs is n + (number of gaps * number of empty chairs per gap). Since it&#39;s a circle, there are n gaps between the n people. If each gap has at most two empty chairs, then the total number of chairs is n + 2n = 3n. Therefore, the minimum number of people required to dominate a circle with 3n chairs is n. Therefore, the domination number γ = n for 3n chairs.But the problem isn&#39;t specifying the number of chairs. So, maybe the question is asking for the minimum n such that no matter how the chairs are arranged in a circle, with n people seated, any new person must sit next to someone. But that can&#39;t be, because the number of chairs could vary. Alternatively, maybe the chairs are considered to be infinitely many, but arranged in a circle. But that seems abstract.Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the concept of a &quot;maximal independent set&quot; but in reverse. Wait, no. Alternatively, the problem is about placing people so that the empty chairs form an independent set, meaning that no two empty chairs are adjacent. But if the empty chairs are an independent set, then every empty chair is adjacent only to occupied chairs, which would mean that anyone sitting in an empty chair is adjacent to an occupied chair. Wait, that might be.Wait, an independent set in a graph is a set of vertices where no two are adjacent. So, if the occupied chairs are a dominating set, then every empty chair is adjacent to an occupied chair. So, yes, this is a dominating set. So, the problem is asking for the minimum dominating set in a cycle graph. However, in cycle graphs, the domination number is known. For a cycle graph with m vertices, the domination number γ(C_m) is ⌈m/3⌉. So, if we have m chairs, the minimum number of people needed is ⌈m/3⌉. But in our problem, we need the minimum n such that when one more person sits down, they have to sit next to someone. Which is equivalent to saying that the dominating set is such that all empty chairs are adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the size of the dominating set is n, and the total number of chairs is m. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify m. Therefore, maybe the question is, what is the minimum n such that in any circle of chairs, if you place n people, then the remaining chairs are all adjacent to at least one person. But since the number of chairs is variable, the answer would depend on m. But the problem doesn&#39;t mention m, so this is confusing.Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be a classic problem where the answer is 668 or something like that, but given the problem number is 1.2014, maybe it&#39;s from an Olympiad? Wait, 2014 might be the year. Maybe the problem is from 2014, and the answer is related to that? Wait, no, probably not. The problem is numbered 1.2014, which might be a code or just a numbering.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a problem where you have to arrange chairs in a circle with n people such that adding one more person forces them to sit next to someone. Then, the minimum n is 668. Wait, 2014 divided by 3 is approximately 671.333, so maybe ceiling of 2014/3 is 672. But why 2014? The problem is labeled 1.2014, which might not relate to the content.Wait, perhaps I misinterpret the problem. Let me read it again:&quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is ______.&quot;So, &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot; – the chairs are arranged in a circle. &quot;with n people sitting on the chairs&quot; – so there are some chairs, some occupied by n people. &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people&quot; – meaning that no matter where the new person sits (on any empty chair), they are adjacent to at least one of the original n people. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum n such that the occupied chairs form a dominating set in the cycle graph of chairs.However, since the number of chairs is not specified, perhaps the problem is considering that the chairs are arranged in a circle with as many chairs as needed. Wait, but in reality, the number of chairs is fixed once you arrange them in a circle. So, perhaps the problem is missing the total number of chairs? Wait, maybe it&#39;s a classic problem where the answer is n = floor(m/2) + 1 or something else. But since the problem mentions a circle, maybe the answer is related to the domination number.Wait, maybe it&#39;s a trick question. If you have a circle, to prevent someone from sitting without being adjacent to anyone, you need to have no two consecutive empty chairs. Because if there are two consecutive empty chairs, someone can sit in the middle, but in a circle, consecutive chairs are adjacent. Wait, no. If there are two consecutive empty chairs, someone sitting in either of them would be adjacent to the next chair. Wait, actually, if chairs are arranged in a circle with some occupied and some empty, and if there&#39;s a stretch of two empty chairs, then sitting in either of those chairs would be adjacent to the chairs next to them. So, if the chairs next to the empty ones are occupied, then sitting there would be adjacent to someone. But if the chairs next to the empty chairs are also empty, then sitting there could be adjacent to empty chairs.Wait, this is getting confusing. Let&#39;s consider small cases.Case 1: n=1. If there is 1 person sitting on a chair in a circle. How many chairs are there? If there&#39;s 1 chair, then the circle has 1 chair, which is occupied. But if there are more chairs, say 3 chairs. Then 1 person is sitting, and the other two chairs are empty. If someone sits in an empty chair, they are adjacent to the occupied chair only if the chairs are adjacent. But in a circle of 3 chairs with 1 person, the other two chairs are adjacent to the occupied chair. So, sitting in any empty chair would be adjacent to the person. Wait, in a circle of 3 chairs, each chair is adjacent to two others. If one is occupied, then the other two are adjacent to the occupied chair. So, indeed, any new person would have to sit next to the original person. But in this case, n=1 is sufficient for m=3 chairs.But if the circle has more chairs, say 4 chairs. If n=2 people sitting opposite each other, then the empty chairs are adjacent to the occupied ones. So, sitting in any empty chair would be adjacent to someone. So, n=2 for m=4.Wait, maybe the answer depends on the number of chairs. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs, so maybe it&#39;s asking for the minimum n in terms of m? But the problem says &quot;the minimum value of n is&quot;, without any variable, so maybe it&#39;s a numeric answer. Wait, but how?Wait, perhaps the problem is in Chinese, and 1.2014 is the problem number, not related to the content. Maybe the actual problem is from 2014, but the answer is a well-known number. Alternatively, maybe the chairs are arranged in a circle with 2014 chairs, and the question is to find the minimum n. But the user hasn&#39;t specified 2014 chairs. Wait, looking back at the original problem:&quot;1.2014 Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is qquad&quot;Wait, maybe &quot;1.2014&quot; is the problem number, with &quot;1&quot; being the section and &quot;2014&quot; being the problem number. So, the actual problem is to find the minimum n where arranging n people in a circle of chairs (number of chairs not specified) such that any new person must sit next to someone. So, how?But in order to answer this, we need to know the number of chairs. Since the problem says &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, but doesn&#39;t specify the number, maybe it&#39;s a circle with an arbitrary number of chairs, and we need to find the minimal n such that, regardless of the number of chairs, this condition holds. But that can&#39;t be, because for a circle with a large number of chairs, n would have to be large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the minimal n such that in any circle with chairs, placing n people in some arrangement would force the next person to sit next to someone. But this is unclear.Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the idea that if you have a circle, and you want to place people such that every empty seat is adjacent to a occupied seat, then the minimal number of people required is the ceiling of the number of chairs divided by 3. For example, for m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. However, if the number of chairs is not given, then this problem is underspecified.Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the chairs are arranged with exactly n+1 chairs. So, if you have n people, there is one empty chair. Then, when the next person comes, they have to sit in that empty chair, which is adjacent to two people. But that seems trivial. But the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people&quot;. If there&#39;s only one empty chair, then the new person has to sit there, which is adjacent to two people. But maybe if there are multiple empty chairs, they have to choose one that is adjacent to someone.Wait, but the problem states &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people&quot;. The word &quot;always&quot; implies that no matter where the new person chooses to sit (assuming there are multiple empty chairs), they have to be adjacent to at least one original person. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum dominating set for a cycle graph with m vertices, where m is the number of chairs. However, since m is not given, the problem is underspecified. Unless the number of chairs is n+1, but that would be a different problem.Wait, maybe the problem is from a competition where the number of chairs is 2014, hence the label 1.2014. If that&#39;s the case, then the problem is to find the domination number for a cycle graph with 2014 vertices, which is ⌈2014/3⌉ = 671.333..., so 672. But 2014 divided by 3 is 671.333..., so ceiling is 672. Therefore, the minimum n is 672. But I need to verify.Alternatively, maybe the problem is general, and the answer is n = ceiling(m/3). But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify m, perhaps it&#39;s a trick question where the minimal n is 3? But that doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Suppose you have a circle of chairs. You need to place n people such that any new person must sit next to someone. To ensure that, every empty chair must have at least one neighbor that&#39;s occupied. So, the complement of the empty chairs is a dominating set.But to find the minimal n, we need to consider the worst-case scenario, where the chairs are arranged such that the maximum distance between people is minimized. Wait, actually, in graph theory terms, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum dominating set of a cycle graph. The domination number of a cycle graph C_m is known to be ⌈m/3⌉. So, if the number of chairs is m, then n = ⌈m/3⌉. However, since the problem doesn&#39;t specify m, perhaps the answer is 3? But that seems too low.Wait, perhaps the problem is from a specific competition where the number of chairs is 2014, hence the problem number 1.2014. Then, the answer would be ⌈2014/3⌉ = 672. However, 2014 divided by 3 is 671.333..., so 672. But I need to check this.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the minimal n such that in any circle with any number of chairs, placing n people will force the next person to sit next to someone. But that&#39;s impossible because if the circle has a huge number of chairs, you need a proportionally large n.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a circle where chairs are placed with at least one empty chair between each person. Wait, but in that case, if people are seated with one empty chair between them, then the number of chairs is 2n. Then, a new person would have to sit in one of the empty chairs, which are adjacent to people. So, in that case, n = number of people, chairs = 2n. But then, to cover all chairs, you need n people. But if you have more chairs, this doesn&#39;t apply.Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me look for similar problems. The classic problem where you need to seat people such that no two are adjacent and maximize the number of people: that&#39;s the maximum independent set. Conversely, the problem here is a dominating set problem, where all empty chairs are adjacent to occupied ones.For a cycle graph C_m, the domination number γ(C_m) is indeed ⌈m/3⌉. For example, if there are 3 chairs, n=1. If 4 chairs, n=2. If 5 chairs, n=2. If 6 chairs, n=2. Wait, no:Wait, let me check the domination numbers for small cycles:- C_3: Domination number is 1.- C_4: Domination number is 2.- C_5: Domination number is 2.- C_6: Domination number is 2.Wait, no. Wait, according to the formula, it&#39;s ⌈m/3⌉.C_3: ⌈3/3⌉ = 1. Correct.C_4: ⌈4/3⌉ = 2. Correct.C_5: ⌈5/3⌉ = 2. Hmm, but can you dominate C_5 with 2 people? Yes. If you place them two seats apart, they cover each other and the seats in between. Let&#39;s see: seats labeled 1,2,3,4,5. Place people at 1 and 3. Then, seat 2 is adjacent to 1, seat 4 is adjacent to 3, seat 5 is adjacent to 1. Wait, seat 5 is adjacent to 1 (if it&#39;s a cycle). So yes, seats 1 and 3 would dominate all seats. So, yes, domination number is 2 for C_5.Similarly, for C_6: ⌈6/3⌉ = 2. Place people at seats 1 and 4. Then, seats 2 and 6 are adjacent to 1, seats 3 and 5 are adjacent to 4. So, yes, domination number is 2.Wait, so in general, the domination number for C_m is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if the problem is referring to a specific number of chairs, say m=2014, then the answer is ⌈2014/3⌉=672. But the problem is presented as a general problem, not specific to 2014 chairs. However, the problem code is 1.2014, which might indicate that it&#39;s problem number 2014 in section 1, and perhaps the answer is 672. Alternatively, maybe the problem was from the year 2014, and the answer is different.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a classic one where the minimal n is 3, but that seems too small. Let me test with a small example.Suppose we have a circle with 6 chairs. To dominate all chairs, we need at least 2 people. If we place them opposite each other, each person can cover 3 chairs (themselves and their two neighbors). So, 2 people can cover 6 chairs. Therefore, if someone sits in any empty chair, they are adjacent to a person.But if we have a circle with 7 chairs. Then, the domination number is ⌈7/3⌉=3. So, with 3 people, we can dominate all chairs. For example, placing people at positions 1, 4, 7. Then, each person covers seats 1,2; 4,5; 7,6. Wait, in a circle of 7 chairs, seat 7 is adjacent to 6 and 1. So, person at 7 covers 6 and 1. Person at 1 covers 2, person at 4 covers 5 and 3. So, all seats are covered. Therefore, 3 people.Therefore, the formula holds. So, in general, for m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if the problem is referring to a circle with m chairs, the answer is ⌈m/3⌉. However, since the problem doesn&#39;t specify m, and the label is 1.2014, it might be that the problem is from 2014 and the answer is 672, as 2014 divided by 3 is approximately 671.33, which rounds up to 672.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese, where &quot;1.2014&quot; is the problem code, and the actual number of chairs is 2014. Then, the answer would be 672. But without more context, it&#39;s hard to tell.Alternatively, maybe the problem is general, and the answer is 3. But that seems incorrect. Wait, if we consider an arbitrarily large circle, the domination number approaches m/3. So, the minimal n is roughly a third of the number of chairs. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs, it&#39;s impossible to answer numerically. Unless the problem assumes that the number of chairs is equal to the number of people plus one, but that would be a different problem.Wait, another interpretation: maybe the chairs are arranged in a circle, and there are n chairs with n people sitting on them. Then, when an additional person comes, they have to add a chair into the circle, but wherever they add it, it has to be adjacent to an existing person. But that seems like a different problem.Alternatively, perhaps the chairs are not fixed; you can choose how many chairs to arrange in a circle, and place n people such that adding one more chair anywhere would require that chair to be adjacent to an existing person. But that also seems unclear.Wait, going back to the original problem statement: &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So, arranging chairs in a circle (so the number of chairs is presumably equal to the number of people plus the number of empty chairs). But we need to choose n and the arrangement such that any new person sitting down must sit next to an original person. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the chairs form a dominating set.But since the problem is asking for the minimal n, regardless of the number of chairs, but the chairs are arranged in a circle. However, the number of chairs must be finite. Wait, but if you can choose the number of chairs, then to minimize n, you could have a circle with 3 chairs, n=1. Because with 3 chairs, 1 person, any new person has to sit next to the original person. But the problem says &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, so maybe you can choose the number of chairs. But then the minimal n would be 1, but that seems too easy.But if you have to have at least one empty chair (since a new person is sitting down), then the minimal number of chairs is n + 1. So, arranging n people in a circle with n + 1 chairs. Then, the empty chair is adjacent to two people. Therefore, the new person has to sit there, adjacent to two people. But if you have more chairs, like n + 2 chairs, then with n people, there are two empty chairs. If those two empty chairs are adjacent, then a new person could sit between them, but those chairs are adjacent to people. Wait, no. If two empty chairs are adjacent, then each is adjacent to a person. For example, in a circle: P-E-E-P-P... The two empty chairs are between two people. So, sitting in either E would be adjacent to a P. Therefore, even with two empty chairs, as long as they are adjacent to people, the new person has to sit next to someone.Wait, but if you have two empty chairs that are not adjacent to any people, which is impossible if the people are placed such that all empty chairs are adjacent to at least one person. Therefore, the key is to arrange the n people such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. The minimal n would depend on the number of chairs. For example, in a circle with m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if the problem allows us to choose the number of chairs to minimize n, then we can have m=3, n=1. But the problem says &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, which might not restrict the number of chairs, but since we need to have at least one empty chair (for the new person to sit), the minimal n is 1 with m=2 chairs? Wait, no. If there are two chairs in a circle, one occupied and one empty. Then, the new person sits in the empty chair, adjacent to the occupied one. So, n=1 works for m=2. But maybe the problem requires more than one empty chair? The problem says &quot;when one more person sits down&quot;, implying there is at least one empty chair. So, if you have n people and m chairs, m ≥ n + 1. To ensure that any of the m - n empty chairs are adjacent to at least one person. The minimal n would depend on m.But since the problem is asking for the minimal n without specifying m, perhaps it&#39;s a trick question where the answer is 3, but I can&#39;t see why. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific competition where the answer is 2014/2 = 1007, but that&#39;s just a guess.Wait, another approach: To prevent the new person from sitting between two empty chairs, every empty chair must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the arrangement must not have two empty chairs in a row. Because if there are two empty chairs in a row, someone could sit in between them, but in a circle, adjacent chairs are next to each other. Wait, actually, if there are two empty chairs next to each other, sitting in either one would still be adjacent to a person, assuming the chairs on the ends are occupied. For example: P-E-E-P. The two empty chairs are between two people. If someone sits in either E, they are adjacent to a P. So, even with two empty chairs in a row, as long as they are between two people, sitting there is still adjacent to a person. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.Wait, then when would a new person be able to sit not adjacent to anyone? Only if there exists three empty chairs in a row. Because then, the middle chair is adjacent to two empty chairs, so someone could sit there without being next to a person. Therefore, to prevent this, the arrangement must not have three consecutive empty chairs. Therefore, the maximum number of empty chairs between any two people is two. Therefore, similar to a spacing of at most two chairs between people.Therefore, for a circle with m chairs, n people, the number of empty chairs is m - n. Each empty space between two people can have at most two empty chairs. Since it&#39;s a circle, there are n gaps. Therefore, the maximum number of empty chairs is 2n. Therefore, m - n ≤ 2n =&gt; m ≤ 3n. Therefore, n ≥ m/3. Therefore, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. Hence, if the number of chairs is m, then the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. But since m is not given, maybe the problem is expecting a general formula. However, the problem asks for the minimal value of n, which is a number, so likely in the problem&#39;s context, m is 2014, hence the answer is 672.But the user hasn&#39;t specified the number of chairs, only the problem code is 1.2014. It&#39;s possible that in the original problem, the number of chairs is 2014, and the answer is 672. Therefore, considering that, I will go with 672 as the minimal n.But to confirm, if there are 2014 chairs arranged in a circle, the minimal number of people needed such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair is ⌈2014 / 3⌉. Let&#39;s compute 2014 divided by 3:3 × 671 = 2013, so 2014 = 3 × 671 + 1. Therefore, ⌈2014 / 3⌉ = 672. So, n=672.Thus, the minimal value of n is 672.Final Answerboxed{672}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of people ( n ) such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original ( n ) people in a circle of chairs, we need to ensure that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. This problem is equivalent to finding the domination number of a cycle graph ( C_m ), where ( m ) is the number of chairs.The domination number of a cycle graph ( C_m ) is given by ( lceil frac{m}{3} rceil ). For a cycle graph with ( m ) vertices, the minimum number of vertices needed to dominate all other vertices (i.e., ensuring every empty chair is adjacent to an occupied one) is ( lceil frac{m}{3} rceil ).Given the problem label 1.2014, it is inferred that the number of chairs ( m ) is 2014. Therefore, the minimum value of ( n ) is calculated as follows:[n = leftlceil frac{2014}{3} rightrceil]Calculating the division:[2014 div 3 = 671.333ldots]Taking the ceiling of this value gives:[n = 672]Thus, the minimum value of ( n ) is (boxed{672}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this problem here: Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is ______.Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. We have chairs arranged in a circle. There are some chairs occupied by people (n of them) and some chairs empty. The condition is that if another person comes to sit down, no matter where they choose to sit (among the empty chairs), they will always end up sitting next to at least one of the original n people. So, we need to find the smallest number n such that this condition is satisfied.First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. The chairs are in a circle, so it&#39;s a circular arrangement. The key is that every empty chair must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Because if there&#39;s an empty chair that&#39;s not adjacent to any occupied chair, then a person could sit there and not be next to anyone, right? So, the problem reduces to placing n people in a circle of chairs such that all empty chairs are adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then, the minimum n would be the smallest number that can achieve this coverage.Wait, but the chairs are arranged in a circle. So, how many chairs are there in total? The problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs. Hmm. That&#39;s a bit confusing. Maybe the chairs are infinite? But that doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, perhaps the problem is about chairs arranged in a circle, but the number of chairs is not specified. So, maybe we need to find the minimal n such that, regardless of how many chairs are in the circle (as long as there&#39;s at least one empty chair), the next person has to sit next to someone.Wait, but that interpretation might not be correct. Maybe the number of chairs is fixed, but the problem is to find the minimal n such that when the chairs are arranged in a circle with n people, the next person has to sit next to someone. But if the number of chairs isn&#39;t specified, then perhaps the problem is for any number of chairs? That seems impossible because if you have a circle with a million chairs and only n people, then obviously there can be empty chairs not adjacent to anyone.Wait, perhaps the problem is that the chairs are arranged in a circle, and there are n people sitting such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then, the minimal n is the answer. But the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So, regardless of where the new person sits (among the empty chairs), they have to be adjacent to at least one of the original n people. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to covering all empty chairs with the adjacency condition.Therefore, the problem reduces to placing n people in a circle (with some number of chairs) such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then, the minimal n is required. But how many chairs are in the circle? The problem doesn&#39;t specify. Hmm.Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the chairs are arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is equal to n+1? Because when one more person comes, the total number of people would be n+1, so perhaps the number of chairs is n+1? But that might not be the case. Wait, the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down&quot;, so the number of chairs must be at least n+1. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the total number of chairs. This is a bit confusing.Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimal n such that in any arrangement of chairs in a circle, if you place n people, then any additional person must sit next to one of them. But that doesn&#39;t make sense because the arrangement of chairs isn&#39;t fixed. Maybe the problem is that chairs are arranged in a circle, and there are n people seated such that between any two consecutive people, there are at most k chairs, so that when a new person sits, they have to be adjacent. But I need to think differently.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the concept of a dominating set in graph theory. In a circular graph where each chair is a node and adjacent chairs are connected, the problem is to find the minimum dominating set. A dominating set is a set of nodes such that every node is either in the set or adjacent to a node in the set. So, in this case, the chairs (nodes) are in a circle, and we need a dominating set of size n such that all other chairs (empty ones) are adjacent to at least one in the dominating set. Therefore, the minimal n is the domination number of the circular graph.If that&#39;s the case, then the problem reduces to finding the domination number of a cycle graph. Let me recall: For a cycle graph with m vertices, the domination number is ⌈m/3⌉. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.Yes, in graph theory, the domination number of a cycle graph C_m is indeed ⌈m/3⌉. So, if we have m chairs arranged in a circle, the minimal number of people needed such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair is ⌈m/3⌉. But in this problem, the number of chairs isn&#39;t given. So perhaps the question is asking for the minimal n such that for any number of chairs, arranging n people in some way would ensure that any new person must sit next to someone? But that doesn&#39;t make sense because if the number of chairs is larger than 3n, for example, then you can&#39;t cover all empty chairs with n people.Wait, maybe the problem is not about an arbitrary number of chairs but a specific number. But the problem statement doesn&#39;t mention the total number of chairs. Hmm. Let me re-read the problem.&quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is ______.&quot;Wait, maybe the chairs are arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is n+1. Because then, if you have n people sitting, there is one empty chair. But if there&#39;s one empty chair, then the next person has to sit there, and if that chair is adjacent to at least one person, then n is the answer. But in that case, n can be 1. If there are two chairs, one occupied and one empty. Then the next person has to sit next to the original person. But if there are three chairs, two occupied and one empty, the empty chair is between the two occupied ones, then the next person has to sit there, adjacent to both. But maybe the problem is different.Wait, perhaps the problem is that the chairs are arranged in a circle with multiple empty chairs, and we have to place n people such that no matter where the new person sits (in any of the empty chairs), they are adjacent to at least one original person. So, the number of chairs is not fixed, but the problem is to find the minimal n such that in any arrangement (of chairs and people) that satisfies the condition, n must be at least that number. Wait, no, the problem is to arrange chairs in a circle with n people such that when one more person sits, they must sit next to someone. So, the chairs are arranged in a circle with n people, and the rest are empty. But how many chairs are there? If we have n people and k empty chairs, then total chairs are n + k. The condition is that any of the k empty chairs is adjacent to at least one person. Therefore, the problem is to find the minimal n such that in a circle of n + k chairs, n people are placed so that all k empty chairs are adjacent to at least one person. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify k. So maybe k can be any number? But then if k is arbitrary, you can&#39;t have a fixed n. So this is confusing.Wait, maybe the problem is that chairs are arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is not specified, but we need to choose n such that no matter how the chairs are arranged (as a circle), placing n people in some seats will ensure that any additional person has to sit next to them. But that still doesn&#39;t make sense because the number of chairs could be huge.Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the idea of placing people such that there are no two empty chairs in a row. For example, if you have chairs arranged in a circle, and you place people such that between any two people, there is at most one empty chair. Then, if a new person comes, they have to sit in one of those single empty chairs, which would be adjacent to the people on either side. But in that case, the minimal n would be ceiling of total chairs divided by 2. But again, the problem doesn&#39;t specify the number of chairs.Wait, maybe the problem is about a circle with a specific number of chairs, but it&#39;s not given. But since the problem is asking for a numerical answer, it&#39;s likely that the number of chairs is n + 1, so that when you have n people, there&#39;s one empty chair, which must be adjacent to someone. But in that case, n could be 1. If there are two chairs, one person sitting, then the empty chair is adjacent. But that seems too simple.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a classic problem where you need to place people such that every empty seat is adjacent to an occupied one. In such a case, the minimal number of people required is the ceiling of the number of chairs divided by 3. For example, if there are m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. But if we don&#39;t know m, how can we find n? Unless the problem is for the worst-case scenario, meaning that for any number of chairs, n must be such that ⌈m/3⌉ is minimal. But that still doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, maybe the problem is in the style of a puzzle where chairs are arranged in a circle, and you have to place the minimal number of people such that any new person has to sit next to someone. In such puzzles, usually, the answer is that you need to place people with at most one empty chair between them. For example, if you have people seated with one empty chair between each, then the next person has to sit in one of the empty chairs, which is adjacent to two people. But if you leave two empty chairs between people, then someone could sit in the middle of those two empty chairs and not be adjacent to anyone. So, to prevent that, you need to have at most one empty chair between any two people.Therefore, if chairs are arranged in a circle, to ensure that any new person must sit adjacent to someone, you need to place people such that between any two people, there is at most one empty chair. In that case, the number of people n required would be ceiling of m / 2, where m is the number of chairs. But since we need the minimal n, perhaps for the maximum spacing, which would be one empty chair between each person. For example, in a circle with m chairs, placing n people with one empty chair between each would require n = m / 2. But if m is even, that works, but if m is odd, you have n = (m + 1)/2. However, if you want to cover all empty chairs with adjacency, you need n such that between every two people, there&#39;s at most one empty chair. So, the minimal n is ceiling(m / 2). But again, the problem doesn&#39;t specify m.Wait, maybe the problem is considering that chairs are arranged in a circle, and you need to choose n such that no matter how the chairs are arranged (i.e., regardless of the number of chairs), n is the minimal number that can block any new person from sitting alone. But that seems impossible because the number of chairs could be variable.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a fixed number of chairs, but it&#39;s implied that the chairs are arranged in a circle with exactly n+1 chairs. Then, if you have n people, there&#39;s one empty chair. But in a circle of n+1 chairs, with n people, there&#39;s one empty chair. That empty chair is adjacent to two people, so the next person has to sit there, adjacent to two people. But in that case, n can be 1. Wait, if you have 2 chairs, 1 person, then the empty chair is adjacent. But maybe the problem is when there are more chairs. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify.This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.First, let&#39;s consider the problem: Arrange chairs in a circle with n people such that any new person must sit next to one of the original n. So, we need to place n people in a circle of chairs (number of chairs not specified) such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Then, find the minimal n.But since the number of chairs is not specified, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal n such that in any circle with any number of chairs, arranging n people in this way would ensure all empty chairs are adjacent. But that can&#39;t be, because if the circle has more than 3n chairs, for example, you can&#39;t cover all empty chairs with n people.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that chairs are arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is such that when you add one more person, the total becomes n+1. But this is vague.Wait, maybe the problem is similar to the concept of &quot;maximal spacing&quot; where people are seated as far apart as possible, and then you need to determine the minimal number of people needed so that adding one more forces them to sit next to someone. In such a case, the maximal spacing would be having two empty chairs between each person. For example, in a circle with chairs, if people are seated with two empty chairs between them, then a new person can sit in the middle of those two empty chairs, which is not adjacent to anyone. Therefore, to prevent that, the maximal spacing allowed is one empty chair between people. Therefore, the minimal number of people needed to block any new person from sitting alone would be arranging them with one empty chair between each. In such a case, the number of people n would be equal to the number of chairs divided by 2, rounded up. But again, without knowing the number of chairs, we can&#39;t compute n.Wait, maybe the problem is considering an infinite number of chairs arranged in a circle, but that&#39;s not feasible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a classic combinatorics problem where the answer is 3. Wait, let me think.Suppose we have chairs arranged in a circle. If we place people such that every third chair is occupied, then between each pair of people, there are two empty chairs. In this case, a new person can sit in the middle of those two empty chairs, which is not adjacent to anyone. Therefore, that spacing is insufficient. If we place people with one empty chair between them, then a new person has to sit in the empty chair, adjacent to two people. Therefore, the minimal n would be the number of chairs divided by 2. But again, without knowing the number of chairs, we can&#39;t get a numerical answer.Wait, maybe the problem is from a competition, and the answer is 34 or something, but I need to think.Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the idea of a circle with chairs where people are seated such that there are no three consecutive empty chairs. Then, the minimal number of people required would be ceiling(m / 3), but again, m is not given.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about a specific number of chairs. For example, if there are 4 chairs, then n=2: place people opposite each other, leaving two empty chairs. But then a new person could sit in one of the empty chairs, which are adjacent to the occupied ones. Wait, no. If two people are seated opposite each other in a 4-chair circle, then the empty chairs are adjacent to the occupied ones. So, a new person sitting down would have to sit next to someone. But if there are three chairs, n=1: one person, two empty chairs. Then, the next person would have to sit next to the first. But in a three-chair circle, the chairs are all adjacent. So, n=1 works for m=3. But if there are four chairs, n=2. For m chairs, the minimal n is ceiling(m/2). But again, since m isn&#39;t given, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach.Wait, the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So, maybe it&#39;s about the minimal n such that in any arrangement of chairs (with any number of chairs), but that still doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, perhaps the key is that the chairs are arranged in a circle, and the number of chairs is one more than the number of people. For example, n people, n+1 chairs. Then, when the next person comes, there&#39;s one chair left, which is adjacent to two people. But in that case, n could be 1. If there are two chairs, one person, then the next person has to sit next to them. But maybe the problem is more general. If you have n people, and chairs arranged in a circle with more than n+1 chairs, then you need to ensure that all empty chairs are adjacent to at least one person. So, the problem is similar to the domination number in graphs. The domination number of a circular graph with m nodes is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if we have m chairs, we need ⌈m/3⌉ people to dominate the graph. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify m, perhaps the answer is 3? Wait, no.Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Suppose there are 6 chairs. The domination number is ⌈6/3⌉ = 2. So, placing 2 people opposite each other would cover all chairs. But actually, if you place two people with two chairs between them, then each person can cover three chairs (themselves and the next two). Wait, in domination, a node covers itself and its neighbors. So, in a cycle of 6, each person can cover three chairs: the one they&#39;re sitting on and the two adjacent. Therefore, with two people, they can cover 6 chairs. Indeed, if you place two people three chairs apart, they each cover three chairs, totaling 6. So, n=2 for m=6. Then, if a new person comes, there are no empty chairs, but that&#39;s not the case here. Wait, maybe the problem is different.Wait, the problem states &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So, the chairs are arranged in a circle with n people and some empty chairs. The condition is that any empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal n such that the domination number of the graph (which is a cycle) is n. But the domination number depends on the number of chairs (nodes). So, if we don&#39;t fix the number of chairs, then the minimal n would be 1, because for m=3 chairs, n=1 suffices, but for larger m, you need more. Therefore, the problem must be considering a specific number of chairs.Wait, the problem is stated as: &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is ______.&quot;The key is &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot; — so we have to arrange the chairs (i.e., position the people) in such a way that any new person must sit adjacent to someone. The minimal n is to be found. So, perhaps it&#39;s about the minimal number of people needed so that in a circle of chairs (with the number of chairs being n + number of empty chairs), every empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. However, since the problem doesn&#39;t fix the number of chairs, maybe it&#39;s a question that has a standard answer, like n=3.Wait, maybe the problem is from a math competition, and the answer is 34. But no, that seems arbitrary. Wait, another approach: Suppose we model the chairs as a cycle graph, and we need a dominating set of size n. The domination number of a cycle graph C_m is known to be ⌈m/3⌉. So, if we have m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify m. Therefore, the question must be about the maximum possible domination number over all possible m, but that would be unbounded. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the minimal n such that in any circle with any number of chairs, arranging n people can cover all empty chairs. But that&#39;s impossible since for a large m, n would need to be large.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a classic puzzle where the answer is n=3. Wait, let&#39;s think with small numbers.Suppose there are 4 chairs. If we place 2 people opposite each other, then the two empty chairs are adjacent to both people. So, a new person would have to sit next to someone. So, n=2. But if we have 5 chairs. The domination number is ⌈5/3⌉=2. So, place two people with two chairs between them. Then each person covers three chairs. But in a circle of five chairs, placing two people two chairs apart would cover chairs 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s see:If person A is at chair 1, they cover chairs 1, 2, and 5. Person B is at chair 4, covering chairs 3, 4, and 5. Wait, chair 3 is covered by person B, chair 2 by person A, chair 5 by both. So, yes, two people can dominate a 5-chair circle. Then, a new person sitting would have to sit in chair 3, which is adjacent to person B. Wait, but chairs 1, 2, 4, 5 are occupied or covered. Wait, actually, in this arrangement, chairs 1 and 4 are occupied. The empty chairs are 2, 3, 5. Chair 2 is adjacent to 1, chair 3 is adjacent to 4, chair 5 is adjacent to 1 and 4. So, all empty chairs are adjacent to occupied chairs. Therefore, n=2 works for m=5.But the problem is asking for the minimal n such that when you arrange chairs in a circle with n people, any new person must sit next to someone. So, if we take m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if m=6, n=2. Wait, but maybe the problem is referring to the minimal n such that for any m, n is sufficient. But again, that&#39;s not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in Chinese, and the original says &quot;2014 chairs,&quot; but the user wrote 1.2014. Wait, looking back at the original problem: &quot;1.2014 Arrange chairs in a circle...&quot; Oh, maybe &quot;1.2014&quot; is a typo or formatting issue. Maybe the problem number is 1, and 2014 is part of the text? Wait, let me check again.Original problem: &quot;1.2014 Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is qquad&quot;.Ah, maybe &quot;1.2014&quot; is the problem number, like problem 1 from 2014. So, the problem is: Arrange chairs in a circle with n people... etc. So, the user just copy-pasted it with the problem number.Therefore, the problem is correctly stated, and we need to find the minimal n such that chairs arranged in a circle with n people, any new person must sit next to someone.Given that the problem is likely from a competition, and given the answer is a boxed number, probably an integer. Let me think again.Perhaps the problem is about the minimal number of people needed so that in a circle with any number of chairs, placing them in some way would cover all empty chairs. But that&#39;s impossible. Alternatively, it&#39;s about the maximum number of chairs that can be covered with n people such that every empty chair is adjacent. Wait, for example, if you have n people, each can cover up to 3 chairs (their own and the two adjacent). So, the maximum number of chairs that can be covered is 3n. Therefore, to cover m chairs, n ≥ m/3. Therefore, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. But again, without m, how?Wait, perhaps the problem is in a circle where the number of chairs is such that when the new person sits down, there&#39;s exactly one chair left, but that seems not necessarily.Wait, another approach: If we need every empty chair to be adjacent to at least one occupied chair, then the complement of the problem is that there are no two consecutive empty chairs. Because if there are two consecutive empty chairs, then a person could sit in between them, but in a circle, consecutive empty chairs would mean that the chairs are adjacent. Wait, no. If there are two empty chairs next to each other, then a person sitting in either of them would be adjacent to an occupied chair. Wait, no, if there are two empty chairs next to each other, but both are adjacent to an occupied chair. Wait, maybe not. For example, suppose you have a sequence: occupied, empty, empty, occupied. Then, the two empty chairs are between two occupied chairs. A person sitting in either empty chair would be adjacent to an occupied chair. Therefore, even with two empty chairs next to each other, sitting there would still be adjacent to someone. Wait, but if you have three empty chairs in a row, then the middle one is not adjacent to anyone. So, to prevent that, we must ensure that there are no three consecutive empty chairs. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive empty chairs allowed is two. Therefore, the minimal number of people required is ceiling(m / 3). But again, m is not given.But in the problem, there is no mention of the number of chairs. Therefore, perhaps the problem is about a circle where chairs are arranged with n people such that between every two people, there are at most two chairs. In that case, a new person would have to sit in one of those gaps, which has at most two chairs, so the person would be adjacent to someone. Wait, if between two people there are two chairs, then the new person could sit in the middle chair, which is adjacent to neither. Wait, if there are two chairs between people, that creates a gap of two empty chairs. If someone sits in the middle of that gap, but in a circle, the chairs are arranged in a sequence. So, if two people have two empty chairs between them, the chairs are: person, empty, empty, person. Then, a new person sitting in the first empty chair is adjacent to the first person, and sitting in the second empty chair is adjacent to the second person. So, even with two empty chairs, any new person sitting there would be adjacent to someone. Wait, but if you have three empty chairs between two people, then the middle chair is not adjacent to anyone. So, if you have a gap of three chairs: person, empty, empty, empty, person. Then, the middle empty chair is not adjacent to either person. Therefore, to prevent that, you need to have gaps of at most two chairs between people. Therefore, the minimal number of people required is ceiling(m / 3). But again, m is not given.Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the case where the number of chairs is such that when you have n people, there exists at least one empty chair (since the new person needs to sit down). So, the number of chairs is at least n + 1. To cover all empty chairs with adjacency, the minimal n would be such that in a circle of n + k chairs (k ≥ 1), n people are placed so that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. The minimal n for the worst-case k. But since k can be 1, which requires n = 1 (if there are two chairs, one person, one empty chair adjacent), but if k is larger, like 2, then n=1 is insufficient because with three chairs, one person, two empty chairs next to each other. Wait, no: in three chairs, one person, two empty chairs. The empty chairs are adjacent to the person. So a new person would have to sit next to the original person. Wait, but in three chairs arranged in a circle, each chair is adjacent to two others. If one person is sitting, the two empty chairs are each adjacent to the occupied chair. So, even with two empty chairs, any new person must sit next to the original person. Therefore, n=1 works for m=3. Similarly, for m=4, n=2: two people opposite each other, two empty chairs adjacent to both. Wait, no. If you have four chairs, two people opposite each other, then the two empty chairs are adjacent to both people. So, a new person sitting in an empty chair is adjacent to two people. So, n=2 works for m=4. Wait, but if you have four chairs and one person, the three empty chairs are adjacent to the person. So, n=1 works for m=4. Wait, but no. If you have four chairs in a circle, one person sitting, then the three empty chairs: each empty chair is adjacent to the occupied chair. Because in a circle, each chair has two neighbors. So, the chair opposite the person is two seats away, which is not adjacent. Wait, no. In a circle of four chairs, each chair has two adjacent chairs. If one chair is occupied, then the two adjacent chairs are next to it, and the chair opposite is two seats away, not adjacent. Therefore, the opposite chair is not adjacent. So, if you have four chairs, one person, then the three empty chairs include two adjacent to the person and one opposite, which is not adjacent. Therefore, the opposite chair is not covered. Therefore, a new person could sit there, not adjacent to anyone. Therefore, n=1 is insufficient for m=4.Ah, so in this case, n=1 is insufficient for m=4 because there&#39;s a chair not adjacent to the occupied chair. Therefore, for m=4, the domination number is 2. If we have two people sitting opposite each other, then all chairs are either occupied or adjacent to an occupied chair. Therefore, n=2.Similarly, for m=5 chairs, domination number is 2. If we place two people with two chairs between them, they can cover all chairs. For example, chairs 1 and 4 in a 5-chair circle: chair 1 covers 1, 2, 5; chair 4 covers 3, 4, 5. Thus, all chairs are covered.Therefore, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify m. So perhaps the problem is about the minimal n such that in a circle with n + 1 chairs, arranging n people such that the one empty chair is adjacent to someone. But in that case, n can be 1, as in two chairs, one person, the empty chair is adjacent. But the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people&quot;. So, if there are multiple empty chairs, all must be adjacent to at least one person.Wait, the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people&quot;. The wording suggests that no matter which empty chair the new person chooses, they have to sit next to someone. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number n such that in a circle of chairs (with any number of chairs), n people are placed so that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. But as we saw, the required n depends on the number of chairs. For m chairs, n is ⌈m/3⌉. However, since m is not given, the problem must be about a specific case. Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimal n. If we take the minimal n over all possible m, then n=1 (for m=2 or 3). But since the problem is from a competition, maybe the answer is 34. Wait, no.Wait, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and &quot;1.2014&quot; is the problem number. The actual problem is to find the minimal n such that in a circle of 2014 chairs, placing n people so that any new person must sit next to someone. Then, the answer would be ⌈2014/3⌉=672. But the user hasn&#39;t specified the year or the problem number. Alternatively, the problem might be from 2014, and the answer is 672. But the user wrote &quot;1.2014&quot; — maybe problem 1 of 2014. But without more context, it&#39;s hard to tell.Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and &quot;1.2014&quot; was intended to be &quot;In 2014,&quot; but that&#39;s speculative.Wait, going back to the original problem statement:&quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is qquad&quot;.The key is that when any additional person sits down, regardless of where they choose to sit (among the remaining empty chairs), they must be adjacent to at least one of the original n people. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. This is equivalent to saying that the occupied chairs form a dominating set in the cycle graph of chairs. The minimal dominating set in a cycle graph with m nodes is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. But since m is not given, perhaps the problem is asking for n in terms of m, but the answer is a numerical value, so maybe the problem assumes that the number of chairs is 2014, as in the problem number. However, the user wrote &quot;1.2014&quot;, which might indicate problem 1 from 2014, and the actual number of chairs is 2014. Then, the minimal n would be ⌈2014/3⌉=672. But I don&#39;t have confirmation.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a generic one where the answer is 34, but I need to think differently.Wait, suppose we don&#39;t know the number of chairs. The problem states that chairs are arranged in a circle with n people, such that any new person must sit next to someone. The minimal n. If the number of chairs is variable, then the answer could be expressed in terms of the number of chairs. However, since the answer requires a numerical value, the problem must assume a specific number of chairs. Given that the problem is numbered 1.2014, perhaps it&#39;s from 2014, and the answer is 1007. Wait, half of 2014 is 1007. If you arrange people with one empty chair between each, you need n=1007 people for 2014 chairs. But if you do that, then any new person would have to sit in an empty chair, which is adjacent to two people. But if the chairs are 2014, then minimal n is 1007. But the domination number would be ⌈2014/3⌉=672. So, there&#39;s a discrepancy.Alternatively, maybe the problem is from the 2014 Singapore Mathematical Olympiad or another competition, but without more context, it&#39;s hard to say.Wait, let&#39;s consider that the problem is about a circle with an unspecified number of chairs, and we need to find the minimal n such that the arrangement of n people forces any new person to sit next to someone, regardless of the number of chairs. This seems impossible, but perhaps there&#39;s a different interpretation.Alternatively, think of it as placing people such that there are no three consecutive empty chairs. Then, to ensure that, you need to have at least one person every three chairs. Therefore, the minimal n is the ceiling of m/3. But again, m is needed.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. If chairs are arranged in a circle with n people, and you want to ensure that any new person sits next to someone, the minimal n is 1. Because if there&#39;s only one person, then any new person must sit next to them if the circle is small. But in a larger circle, as we saw earlier, one person is not enough.Wait, but the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, not &quot;a given number of chairs&quot;. So, perhaps we can choose the number of chairs as part of the arrangement. Wait, but arranging chairs in a circle just means forming a circular arrangement, the number of chairs isn&#39;t specified. So, maybe the problem is asking for the minimal n such that there exists a circle of chairs with n people where any new person must sit next to them. In that case, the answer would be n=1, because you can have a circle with two chairs, one person. The empty chair is adjacent, so the new person has to sit there. But if you have a circle with three chairs, one person, the two empty chairs are adjacent. So, the new person has to sit next to the original person. But in a four-chair circle, one person leaves three empty chairs, one of which is not adjacent. Therefore, n=1 is insufficient for m=4.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we need to arrange chairs in a circle, and place n people on them such that whenever an additional person comes to sit down, they have to sit next to one of the original n people. The question is asking for the minimal n. Hmm, interesting.First, let me visualize the problem. Imagine a circular table with chairs around it. Some chairs are occupied by people, and the rest are empty. Now, if someone new comes in, they can only sit down if there&#39;s an empty chair, but the catch is that wherever they sit, they must end up adjacent to at least one of the original people. So, the goal is to arrange the original people in such a way that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Wait, that sounds a bit like a dominating set problem in graph theory, where each node (chair) is either occupied or adjacent to an occupied one. But here, since it&#39;s a circle, the graph is a cycle graph. So, maybe this is equivalent to finding the minimum dominating set of a cycle graph where the domination condition must hold even after adding another person. Wait, but actually, the problem states that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. So, the act of sitting down doesn&#39;t affect the original people; it&#39;s just that regardless of where the new person chooses to sit (among the remaining chairs), they have to be next to someone from the original group. So actually, the original arrangement must be such that all empty chairs are adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Because if there&#39;s an empty chair that isn&#39;t adjacent to any occupied chair, then the new person could sit there without being next to anyone, which violates the condition. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of people needed to occupy chairs in a circle such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. That is, the original people form a dominating set for the cycle graph. So, the minimal dominating set of a cycle graph. Now, I need to recall what the domination number is for a cycle graph. But wait, how many chairs are there in total? The problem doesn&#39;t specify. Wait, hold on. The problem says &quot;arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; But it doesn&#39;t mention the total number of chairs. Hmm, so maybe we need to consider that the number of chairs is n + 1? Because when one more person comes, there must be at least one chair available. Wait, but the problem is not stating that there is exactly one chair left. It just says that when one more person sits down, regardless of where they sit (i.e., in any possible empty chair), they must be adjacent to someone from the original n. So, perhaps the number of chairs is variable, but we need to arrange n people in such a way that all remaining chairs (which could be any number) are adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Wait, but that can&#39;t be. If the chairs are arranged in a circle, and we have n people sitting, then the number of chairs must be at least n. But the problem is about when one more person sits down. So, does that mean that there are initially n chairs with n people, and then an additional chair is added? Or maybe that the total number of chairs is n + 1, with n occupied and 1 empty, and we need that the single empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair? But the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down,&quot; implying that there might be multiple empty chairs, but regardless of which one the new person chooses, they have to sit next to someone. Wait, actually, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse the problem again: &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; The key here is that no matter where the new person chooses to sit (among the empty chairs), they must be adjacent to at least one original person. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. So, the original arrangement of n people must be such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. Therefore, the domination number for the cycle graph where the number of vertices (chairs) is such that there&#39;s at least one empty chair. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the total number of chairs. So perhaps we need to find the minimal n such that for any number of chairs, if we place n people in some chairs arranged in a circle, then all remaining chairs are adjacent to at least one person. But that doesn&#39;t make sense because the domination number depends on the total number of chairs. For example, if there are 5 chairs, the domination number is 2. If there are 6 chairs, the domination number is 2, and so on. Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the total number of chairs is not fixed, but we need to find the minimal n such that no matter how the chairs are arranged (in a circle) with n people, any additional person must sit next to someone. But that interpretation is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that chairs are arranged in a circle, and we need to place n people such that any seat not occupied by them is adjacent to at least one occupied seat. Therefore, the minimal n is the domination number of a cycle graph with m vertices, but m is not given. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the problem is in the context of a standard circle with chairs, and when another person comes, there is an available chair, but that chair must be adjacent to someone. However, since chairs are in a circle, maybe we need to have every empty chair adjacent to an occupied one. Therefore, the problem reduces to covering all empty chairs with the domination of the original n people. Therefore, n would be the domination number for a cycle graph with m vertices, where m is the total number of chairs. But since m is not given, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal n such that for any m (number of chairs), placing n people in a circle of m chairs would ensure that all empty chairs are adjacent to at least one person. But that can&#39;t be, because for m approaching infinity, n would also need to approach infinity. Therefore, maybe the problem is about a specific number of chairs. Wait, the problem statement is translated from Chinese, and the original might be more precise, but given the translation, perhaps the problem is: Arrange chairs in a circle (number of chairs is not specified) with n people sitting such that if one more person arrives and sits down, that person must sit adjacent to at least one of the original n people. So, regardless of where the new person sits (i.e., in any chair not occupied by the original n), they must have at least one neighbor from the original n. Therefore, the original n people must form a dominating set in the cycle graph of chairs. The chairs are arranged in a circle, so the graph is a cycle. The domination number of a cycle graph with m vertices is known to be ⌈m/3⌉. However, in our problem, we don&#39;t know m. Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the chairs are arranged in a circle, but the number of chairs is variable. However, the answer is a specific number, n, so maybe the problem is actually asking for the minimal n such that in any circle of chairs, placing n people appropriately can ensure that any additional person must sit next to one of them. But that still doesn&#39;t specify m. Alternatively, maybe the chairs are exactly n+1 in number, with n people sitting, leaving one chair empty. Then, the empty chair must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. But in that case, n would be 2, because if you have 3 chairs, 2 people sitting opposite each other, the empty chair is between them. Wait, but in a circle of 3 chairs, if 2 are occupied, the empty chair is adjacent to both occupied chairs. If you have 4 chairs, with 2 people sitting opposite each other, then the two empty chairs are each adjacent to one person. But if someone sits in an empty chair, they are adjacent to the original person. However, in that case, n=2 would suffice for m=4. But the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So, if there&#39;s only one empty chair, which is adjacent to at least one person, then the new person has to sit there. But the problem might be that there are multiple empty chairs, and all of them must be adjacent to at least one original person. Therefore, the original n people must form a dominating set. The domination number for a cycle graph with m nodes is the smallest number of nodes needed such that every node is either in the dominating set or adjacent to it. For a cycle graph, the domination number γ(C_m) is ⌈m/3⌉. So, if we have m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. But in our problem, we need that when another person sits down, they are adjacent to one of the original n. That is, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. So, if there are m chairs in total, n needs to be such that the remaining m - n chairs are all adjacent to at least one of the n. So, the problem is: given a circle with m chairs, find the minimal n such that n people can be placed so that the remaining m - n chairs are each adjacent to at least one person. However, the problem does not specify m. Therefore, perhaps the problem is in a different context. Wait, perhaps it&#39;s from a competition, and the answer is a specific number. The problem says &quot;the minimum value of n is&quot;. So, likely, the answer is 34 or something? Wait, but the problem number is 1.2014, which might be an identifier rather than a date. Wait, maybe not. The user just wrote &quot;1.2014 Arrange chairs...&quot;. Maybe 1.2014 is the problem number. Anyway, let&#39;s focus. Let me check small cases. Suppose we have a circle with 4 chairs. If we place 2 people opposite each other, then the two empty chairs are each adjacent to a person. So, if someone sits in any empty chair, they are next to someone. So, n=2 suffices for m=4. For m=5 chairs. If we place 2 people, is that enough? Let&#39;s see. If chairs are labeled 1 to 5. Place people at 1 and 3. Then chairs 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, chair 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5, chair 5 is adjacent to 1. Wait, chair 5 is adjacent to 4 and 1. If person is at 1, then chair 5 is adjacent to 1. So chair 5 is adjacent to 1. So chair 4 is adjacent to 3. So all empty chairs (2,4,5) are adjacent to occupied chairs. Wait, chair 5 is adjacent to 1, which is occupied. Chair 4 is adjacent to 3, which is occupied. Chair 2 is adjacent to both 1 and 3, which are occupied. So, yes, n=2 suffices for m=5. Wait, but domination number for C_5 is 2, since ⌈5/3⌉=2. Similarly, for C_6, domination number is 2. Wait, but actually, for even m, you can place people every other chair, so domination number is m/2. Wait, no. Wait, domination number for a cycle graph C_m is ⌈m/3⌉. For example, C_4: ⌈4/3⌉=2, which matches. C_5: ⌈5/3⌉=2. C_6: ⌈6/3⌉=2. Wait, but if you have C_6, you can place two people with two chairs between them, like 1 and 4, then they dominate chairs 1,2,4,5, and chairs 3 and 6 are adjacent to 2 and 5, which are not occupied. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I need to think again. For C_6, the domination number is indeed 2. If you place people at chairs 1 and 4, then chair 1 dominates chairs 1, 2, 6; chair 4 dominates chairs 4, 3, 5. So all chairs are dominated. So n=2 suffices for m=6. So, in general, the domination number is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if we need all empty chairs to be adjacent to at least one occupied chair, the number of people required is the domination number of the cycle graph C_m, which is ⌈m/3⌉. However, in our problem, the number of chairs is not given. So perhaps the question is: what is the minimum n such that in any circle of chairs, if you place n people, then any additional person must sit next to them. But that doesn&#39;t make sense unless the number of chairs is related to n. Wait, maybe the problem is about a circle with an arbitrary number of chairs, and we need to choose n such that no matter how the chairs are arranged (how many there are), placing n people in some way will ensure any new person has to sit next to someone. But that can&#39;t be, because for a large number of chairs, you would need more people. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about a circle with k chairs, and the minimal n such that n people are placed such that the remaining k - n chairs are all adjacent to at least one person. Then, the minimal n is the domination number for C_k, which is ⌈k/3⌉. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify k, it&#39;s confusing. Wait, the problem says &quot;Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people.&quot; So, the chairs are arranged in a circle. The number of chairs must be at least n + 1, because there is room for one more person. But actually, maybe there are more chairs. The problem doesn&#39;t specify the total number of chairs, just that when one more person sits down, regardless of where they sit, they must be next to someone. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Therefore, the original n people must form a dominating set for the entire set of chairs. But the number of chairs is not specified, so the question is to find the minimal n such that there exists a circle with chairs where n people are placed so that all other chairs are adjacent to at least one person. Wait, but that can&#39;t be, because if you have a circle with n + 1 chairs, placing n people would leave one chair, which is adjacent to two people, so n could be 2 for 3 chairs. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the minimal n such that in a circle with n + 1 chairs, placing n people leaves one chair, which is adjacent to two people. But that&#39;s trivial, n=2. But the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down,&quot; implying that there might be multiple chairs available. Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, the problem might be in a circle with m chairs, and we have to choose n chairs such that every empty chair is adjacent to an occupied one, and find the minimal n in terms of m. But since m is not given, the answer must be a specific number, which suggests that maybe the problem is from a competition where the number of chairs is 2014, as per the problem number 1.2014. Wait, maybe the problem number is 1 from 2014, and the user mistyped it as &quot;1.2014&quot;. That&#39;s possible. If so, then the problem might be: Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Find the minimal n. If this is from a competition, maybe the answer is 672 or something like that. Wait, but 2014 divided by 3 is approximately 671.333, so ceiling would be 672. But 2014 chairs, domination number is ⌈2014/3⌉=672. But the problem is stated generally, not specifically for 2014 chairs. Wait, maybe the problem is from 2014, and the answer is 672. But the user wrote &quot;1.2014 Arrange chairs...&quot;, perhaps indicating problem 1 from 2014. But the user hasn&#39;t specified the year, just the problem. So, maybe the problem is general. Wait, the user&#39;s instruction is: &quot;You will be given a problem. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within boxed{}: 1.2014 Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is qquad&quot;. So, the problem is labeled as &quot;1.2014&quot;, which might just be a numbering. The actual problem is: Arrange chairs in a circle, with n people sitting on the chairs, such that when one more person sits down, they will always sit next to one of the original n people. Then the minimum value of n is... So, the problem is to find the minimal n such that in some arrangement of chairs in a circle with n people, every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Since the chairs are arranged in a circle, the number of chairs is m = n + k, where k is the number of empty chairs. But the problem states &quot;when one more person sits down&quot;, so there is at least one empty chair. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify how many chairs there are in total. So, the question is a bit ambiguous. If the total number of chairs is n + 1, then we need that the single empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. In a circle, that would mean that the empty chair has at least one neighbor who is occupied. But in a circle of n + 1 chairs with n people, there&#39;s only one empty chair. The empty chair is between two people. So, for example, if you have 3 chairs, 2 people sitting with one empty chair between them, then the empty chair is adjacent to both people. So, in that case, n=2 would work. But the problem says &quot;when one more person sits down&quot;, which implies that there could be multiple empty chairs, but the new person could choose any of them, and regardless of their choice, they must be adjacent to an original person. Therefore, all empty chairs must be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. Hence, the problem reduces to: find the minimal n such that there exists a circle of chairs with some number of chairs where n are occupied, and all others are adjacent to at least one occupied. Since the problem is asking for the minimal n without specifying the number of chairs, perhaps we need to find the minimal n such that for any number of chairs, arranging n people in some way can cover all empty chairs. But that is impossible, as for a large number of chairs, you would need more people. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the minimal n such that in a circle with any number of chairs, placing n people in some configuration ensures that any additional person must sit next to them. But that also doesn&#39;t make sense. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a problem from a specific competition where the number of chairs is 2014, and the problem number is 1 from 2014. Then, the answer would be ⌈2014/3⌉=672. But the problem statement here does not mention 2014 chairs. Wait, the problem is labeled as &quot;1.2014&quot;, which might be a way of numbering the problem (like Problem 1 from the 2014 contest), but the actual problem statement doesn&#39;t mention 2014 chairs. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me try to approach it mathematically. If we have a circle with m chairs, and we need to place n people such that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one person. Then, the minimal n is the domination number of the cycle graph C_m, which is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if we can choose m, then the minimal n would be 1 (if m=3, n=1). But the problem says &quot;arrange chairs in a circle&quot;, so maybe the number of chairs is not fixed, but we need the minimal n such that there exists a circle with chairs where n people are placed so that any additional person sits next to them. Wait, but if the number of chairs is n + 1, then the domination number is ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉. But we need n to satisfy ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ ≤ n, which is always true for n ≥1. But that&#39;s trivial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is inverting the question: given that you want that any new person must sit adjacent to an existing person, what&#39;s the minimal number of people needed to initially seat so that no matter where the new person sits, they are adjacent to someone. Since it&#39;s a circle, the domination number is involved. But without knowing the total number of chairs, it&#39;s impossible to determine. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a math competition where the total number of chairs is 2014, hence the answer is ⌈2014/3⌉=672, but the problem statement here does not mention 2014 chairs, only the problem is labeled &quot;1.2014&quot;. Alternatively, maybe the problem is general, and the answer is that the minimal n is the ceiling of m/3, but since m isn&#39;t given, perhaps the problem assumes that chairs are arranged in a circle with 2014 chairs, given the problem number. However, since the user hasn&#39;t specified, I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from the 2014 contest, problem 1, and in Chinese competitions, sometimes the problem numbers are like 1.2014, but the actual content doesn&#39;t include the year. So, maybe it&#39;s a generic problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is: Arrange chairs in a circle (number of chairs not specified) with n people such that any new person must sit next to one of the n. Then, the minimal n is 3? Wait, no. Wait, if we have chairs arranged in a circle and we need every empty chair to be adjacent to at least one occupied chair. So, if the circle has m chairs, then n must be at least ⌈m/3⌉. But since m isn&#39;t given, we can&#39;t solve for n. Therefore, the problem must have a specific number of chairs, which is perhaps 2014, given the problem label. Then, the minimal n would be ⌈2014/3⌉=672. But since the problem statement here does not mention 2014 chairs, this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a classic one where the minimal n is 34 for 100 chairs or something, but without specific numbers, it&#39;s unclear. Wait, maybe I need to consider the problem differently. Suppose that the circle has an unknown number of chairs, but we need to choose n such that no matter how many chairs there are, placing n people in some configuration would ensure all empty chairs are adjacent to someone. But that&#39;s impossible because for a large number of chairs, you need more people. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the minimal n such that in any circle with at least n chairs, you can place n people so that all other chairs are adjacent to them. But again, that&#39;s not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that chairs are arranged in a circle, and we need to seat n people such that between any two consecutive people, there are at most one empty chair. Because if there&#39;s two empty chairs between people, then someone could sit in the middle of those two chairs and not be adjacent to anyone. Wait, that might make sense. Let&#39;s consider that. If we have people seated such that between any two people, there is at most one empty chair, then any empty chair is adjacent to a person. Therefore, the maximum number of empty chairs between two people is one. In such a case, the number of people n must satisfy that between each pair, there is at most one empty chair. So, in a circle, the number of chairs m is equal to n + k, where k is the number of empty chairs. If between each pair of people there is at most one empty chair, then k ≤ n. Since it&#39;s a circle, the number of gaps between people is n. If each gap has at most one empty chair, then total empty chairs k ≤ n. Therefore, m = n + k ≤ 2n. But we need to ensure that k can be as large as possible. Wait, maybe this is overcomplicating. Let&#39;s think in terms of spacing. If we have n people around a circle, the maximum number of empty chairs between any two people is 1. Therefore, the total number of chairs is at most n + n = 2n. But if we want that any empty chair is adjacent to a person, then between any two people, there can be at most one empty chair. Therefore, the minimal number of people needed to cover m chairs with this condition is n ≥ ⌈m/2⌉. Because if you have m chairs, to have at most one empty between people, you need at least ⌈m/2⌉ people. For example, if m=4, n=2; if m=5, n=3. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier domination number idea. Hmmm. Wait, if we have m chairs, and we want that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair, the domination number is ⌈m/3⌉. But if we require that between any two people, there is at most one empty chair, then the required number of people is ⌈m/2⌉. So which is it? Let me take an example. For m=6 chairs. If we place 2 people opposite each other, then the domination number is 2, and all empty chairs are adjacent to someone. But between the two people, there are 4 chairs, which have 2 on each side. But if we require that between any two people, there is at most one empty chair, we would need 3 people: each separated by one empty chair. So, chairs: P-E-P-E-P-E, which requires 3 people for 6 chairs. But the domination number is 2. Therefore, the domination number is better (smaller). So, returning to the original problem. If the problem is asking for the domination number of a cycle graph where all chairs must be dominated (i.e., every empty chair is adjacent to an occupied one), then the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. However, since the problem does not specify m, perhaps the question is ill-posed. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a trick question where the answer is 3, but I need to verify. Wait, consider a circle with 6 chairs. If we place 2 people opposite each other, they dominate all chairs. So n=2. If we have 7 chairs, domination number is ⌈7/3⌉=3. If we place people every third chair, they dominate all chairs. For example, chairs 1, 4, 7 (but in a circle of 7, 7 is adjacent to 6 and 1). So chair 1 dominates 1,2,7; chair 4 dominates 3,4,5; chair 7 is already covered. Then chair 6 is adjacent to 7 and 5; chair 5 is dominated by 4, chair 6 is dominated by 7. So yes, n=3 for m=7. So in general, the minimal n is the ceiling of m/3. But since m is not given, the problem is unclear. However, the problem might be in Chinese, where &quot;chairs in a circle&quot; might imply a certain number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific competition where the answer is known, like the minimal n is 34 for 100 chairs, but I need to think differently. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal n such that in any circle arrangement, placing n people with the given property. But that still depends on the number of chairs. Wait, here&#39;s a different approach. Suppose we have chairs arranged in a circle, and we need to place n people such that any new person must sit adjacent to them. This is equivalent to saying that the empty chairs form an independent set in the complement of the adjacency graph. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the complement of the dominating set. Wait, no. Alternatively, the open neighborhoods of the occupied chairs must cover all empty chairs. So, it is indeed a dominating set. Therefore, the minimal n is the domination number of the cycle graph. But since the cycle graph&#39;s domination number is ⌈m/3⌉, where m is the number of chairs, then if m is not given, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal n in terms of m, which is ⌈m/3⌉. But without m, we can&#39;t compute a numerical answer. However, given that the problem is asking for a specific numerical answer, and the problem is labeled &quot;1.2014&quot;, which might hint that the answer is 2014 divided by 3, which is approximately 671.333, so the ceiling is 672. Therefore, the minimal n is 672. But unless the problem specifies that there are 2014 chairs, this is speculative. Alternatively, the problem might have a different approach. Suppose we have a circle, and we need to place people such that every empty seat is adjacent to at least one person. To minimize the number of people, we can place them every third seat. For example, if we have ...P-E-E-P-E-E..., then every empty seat is adjacent to a person. Wait, no. If you place a person, skip two seats, place another person, etc., then each person covers themselves and the two adjacent seats. Therefore, in this pattern, each person dominates three seats. Therefore, for m chairs, the number of people needed is ⌈m/3⌉. Hence, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. Therefore, if the problem is referring to a specific number of chairs, say 2014, then n=672. However, since the problem is presented generally, it&#39;s possible that the answer is n=⌈m/3⌉, but since m isn&#39;t given, maybe the problem assumes m=2014, hence the answer is 672. But the user hasn&#39;t specified that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a math competition where the answer is 34, but without more context, it&#39;s hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a classic one with answer 3, but that seems too small. Wait, let&#39;s think differently. If you have a circle with n people and you want to ensure that adding one more person must sit next to someone, that means there are no two consecutive empty chairs. Because if there were two consecutive empty chairs, someone could sit in the middle of them, but since it&#39;s a circle, actually, no—if there are two consecutive empty chairs, someone could sit in one of them, but they would still be adjacent to the next chair. Wait, no. If there are two consecutive empty chairs, then a person sitting in one of them would be adjacent to an occupied chair only if one of the neighbors is occupied. Wait, suppose we have a sequence: P-E-E-P. If someone sits in the first E, they are next to P. If someone sits in the second E, they are next to P on the other side. So even with two consecutive empties, sitting in either would still be adjacent to a person. Wait, then maybe the condition is automatically satisfied? Wait, no. Suppose we have three consecutive empty chairs. If someone sits in the middle chair, they would have empty chairs on both sides, so they wouldn&#39;t be adjacent to anyone. Therefore, to prevent this, we need to ensure that there are no three consecutive empty chairs. Therefore, the problem reduces to placing people such that between every two people, there are at most two empty chairs. Because if there are three empty chairs, someone can sit in the middle one, not adjacent to anyone. Therefore, the maximal number of empty chairs between two people is two. Therefore, the number of people needed is ⌈m/3⌉, since each person can &quot;cover&quot; up to three chairs (themselves and the two next to them). Therefore, for m chairs, the minimal n is ⌈m/3⌉. But again, without m, we can&#39;t give a numerical answer. However, given the problem&#39;s label &quot;1.2014&quot;, perhaps it&#39;s from a 2014 competition where the number of chairs is 2014, so n=⌈2014/3⌉=672. But since the user hasn&#39;t specified, I&#39;m not sure. However, in many math competitions, such problems where the domination number is required for a cycle graph with m vertices, the answer is ⌈m/3⌉. Since the problem here is likely from a competition where m=2014, the answer is 672. However, since the user hasn&#39;t specified m, I can&#39;t be certain. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the minimal n such that in any circle with more than n chairs, placing n people in some chairs ensures that any new person must sit next to someone. But that&#39;s not possible, as for any n, you can have a circle with 2n +1 chairs where people are placed alternately, leaving large gaps. Wait, no. If you have n people placed every other chair, then the number of chairs is 2n, and any new person would have to sit between two people, but in a circle of 2n +1 chairs, there would be a gap of two chairs between some people, allowing someone to sit in the middle, not adjacent to anyone. Therefore, the problem requires that in any circle, regardless of the number of chairs, placing n people in such a way that any new person must sit next to someone. But this is impossible because for a sufficiently large number of chairs, you can&#39;t cover all possible gaps. Therefore, the problem must be referring to a specific number of chairs. Given that the problem is labeled &quot;1.2014&quot;, it&#39;s plausible that it&#39;s problem 1 from the 2014 competition, and the number of chairs is 2014. Therefore, the minimal n is ⌈2014/3⌉=672. However, since the user hasn&#39;t explicitly stated this, but given the problem&#39;s label, I will proceed with this assumption. Therefore, the minimum value of n is boxed{672}.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( n ) is boxed{672}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of arranging chairs in a circle with ( n ) people such that any additional person must sit next to one of the original ( n ) people, we need to ensure that every empty chair is adjacent to at least one occupied chair. This problem is equivalent to finding the minimum dominating set of a cycle graph.A dominating set in a graph is a set of vertices such that every vertex is either in the set or adjacent to a vertex in the set. For a cycle graph with ( m ) vertices, the domination number (the size of the minimum dominating set) is given by ( lceil frac{m}{3} rceil ).Given the problem&#39;s context and the label &quot;1.2014&quot;, it is inferred that the problem might be from a competition where the number of chairs is 2014. Therefore, we need to calculate the domination number for a cycle graph with 2014 vertices.[lceil frac{2014}{3} rceil = lceil 671.333 rceil = 672]Thus, the minimum value of ( n ) such that any additional person will always sit next to one of the original ( n ) people is (boxed{672}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>-、1. 672 .From the problem, we know that after n people sit down, there are at most two empty chairs between any two people.If we can arrange for there to be exactly two empty chairs between any two people, then n is minimized.Thus, if we number the chairs where people are sitting, we easily get the arithmetic sequence: 1,4,7, cdots, 2014.Therefore, 2014=1+3(n-1) Rightarrow n=672.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b7f219 data-v-a10afc05><div class="review" data-v-a10afc05><div class="review-title" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>❓:</span>Let the function f(x) = 4^x + a cdot 2^x + b,(1) If f(0)=1 and f(-1)=-frac{5}{4}, find the explicit formula for f(x);(2) From (1), find the range of the function f(x) when 0 leq x leq 2.</div><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here with two parts. Let me start with part (1). The function is given as ( f(x) = 4^x + a cdot 2^x + b ). They tell me that ( f(0) = 1 ) and ( f(-1) = -frac{5}{4} ). I need to find the explicit formula for ( f(x) ), which means I need to determine the values of ( a ) and ( b ).First, let&#39;s recall that ( 4^x ) can be written as ( (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} ), which is the same as ( (2^x)^2 ). So maybe substituting ( t = 2^x ) could simplify things? Not sure if that&#39;s necessary yet, but let&#39;s see.Starting with ( f(0) = 1 ). Plugging ( x = 0 ) into the function:( f(0) = 4^0 + a cdot 2^0 + b = 1 + a cdot 1 + b = 1 + a + b ).They say this equals 1. So:( 1 + a + b = 1 )Subtracting 1 from both sides:( a + b = 0 )So that&#39;s one equation: ( a + b = 0 ).Next, ( f(-1) = -frac{5}{4} ). Let&#39;s compute ( f(-1) ):( f(-1) = 4^{-1} + a cdot 2^{-1} + b = frac{1}{4} + a cdot frac{1}{2} + b ).Set this equal to ( -frac{5}{4} ):( frac{1}{4} + frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{5}{4} )Subtract ( frac{1}{4} ) from both sides:( frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{5}{4} - frac{1}{4} = -frac{6}{4} = -frac{3}{2} )So now we have two equations:1. ( a + b = 0 )2. ( frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{3}{2} )We can solve this system of equations. Let&#39;s subtract the second equation from the first. Wait, actually, maybe substitution would be easier. Since from the first equation, ( b = -a ). Then substitute into the second equation:( frac{a}{2} + (-a) = -frac{3}{2} )Simplify:( frac{a}{2} - a = -frac{a}{2} = -frac{3}{2} )Multiply both sides by -2:( a = 3 )Then, since ( b = -a ), ( b = -3 ).So the function is ( f(x) = 4^x + 3 cdot 2^x - 3 ).Wait, let me check to make sure.Check ( f(0) ): ( 4^0 + 3 cdot 2^0 - 3 = 1 + 3 - 3 = 1 ). Correct.Check ( f(-1) ): ( 4^{-1} + 3 cdot 2^{-1} - 3 = frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{2} - 3 ). Let&#39;s compute:( frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{2} = frac{1}{4} + frac{6}{4} = frac{7}{4} ). Then subtract 3: ( frac{7}{4} - 3 = frac{7}{4} - frac{12}{4} = -frac{5}{4} ). Correct.Okay, part (1) seems done. So the explicit formula is ( f(x) = 4^x + 3 cdot 2^x - 3 ).Now part (2): Find the range of the function ( f(x) ) when ( 0 leq x leq 2 ).Hmm. To find the range, I need to determine the minimum and maximum values of ( f(x) ) over the interval ( [0, 2] ). Since ( f(x) ) is a combination of exponential functions, which are continuous and differentiable, the extreme values will occur either at critical points or at the endpoints.First, maybe substitute ( t = 2^x ), since ( 4^x = (2^x)^2 = t^2 ), so the function becomes:( f(x) = t^2 + 3t - 3 ), where ( t = 2^x ).Now, when ( x ) ranges from 0 to 2, ( t = 2^x ) ranges from ( 2^0 = 1 ) to ( 2^2 = 4 ). So ( t in [1, 4] ).Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the range of the quadratic function ( f(t) = t^2 + 3t - 3 ) over the interval ( t in [1, 4] ).Quadratic functions have a parabola shape. Since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is positive (1), it opens upwards, meaning the vertex is the minimum point.The vertex of a quadratic ( at^2 + bt + c ) is at ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 3 ), so vertex at ( t = -frac{3}{2 cdot 1} = -frac{3}{2} ).But ( t ) in our case is in [1, 4]. Since the vertex is at ( t = -1.5 ), which is outside our interval [1, 4], the function is increasing on the interval [1, 4] because the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is to the left of the interval. Therefore, on [1, 4], the function is increasing from t=1 to t=4.Therefore, the minimum value is at t=1, and the maximum at t=4.Compute f(1): ( 1^2 + 3(1) - 3 = 1 + 3 - 3 = 1 ).Compute f(4): ( 4^2 + 3(4) - 3 = 16 + 12 - 3 = 25 ).Therefore, the range of f(t) over [1, 4] is [1, 25].But wait, let me double-check. Wait, when we substituted t=2^x, x from 0 to 2 gives t from 1 to 4. Then, f(t) is quadratic, opens upwards, vertex at t=-1.5, so yes, on [1,4], the function is increasing. Therefore, minimum at t=1, maximum at t=4.Therefore, the range is [1, 25]. So the answer for part (2) is [1, 25].But let me confirm by taking derivative, just to be thorough.Original function in terms of x: ( f(x) = 4^x + 3 cdot 2^x - 3 ).Derivative: ( f&#39;(x) = ln(4) cdot 4^x + 3 cdot ln(2) cdot 2^x ).Since ( ln(4) = 2 ln(2) ), so:( f&#39;(x) = 2 ln(2) cdot 4^x + 3 ln(2) cdot 2^x ).Factor out ( ln(2) cdot 2^x ):( f&#39;(x) = ln(2) cdot 2^x (2 cdot 2^x + 3) ).Since ( ln(2) &gt; 0 ), ( 2^x &gt; 0 ) for all x, and ( 2 cdot 2^x + 3 &gt; 0 ). Therefore, ( f&#39;(x) &gt; 0 ) for all x. Hence, f(x) is strictly increasing on the entire real line. Therefore, on the interval [0, 2], which corresponds to t in [1, 4], f(x) is increasing. Therefore, the minimum is at x=0, which is t=1, f=1, and maximum at x=2, which is t=4, f=25. Therefore, the range is [1, 25].So yeah, that confirms it. So part (2)&#39;s answer is from 1 to 25.Final Answer(1) The explicit formula for ( f(x) ) is boxed{4^x + 3 cdot 2^x - 3}.(2) The range of ( f(x) ) when ( 0 leq x leq 2 ) is boxed{[1, 25]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = 4^x + a cdot 2^x + b ):(1) We need to find the values of ( a ) and ( b ) using the given conditions ( f(0) = 1 ) and ( f(-1) = -frac{5}{4} ).- For ( f(0) = 1 ):  [  4^0 + a cdot 2^0 + b = 1 implies 1 + a + b = 1 implies a + b = 0  ]- For ( f(-1) = -frac{5}{4} ):  [  4^{-1} + a cdot 2^{-1} + b = -frac{5}{4} implies frac{1}{4} + frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{5}{4}  ]  Subtracting (frac{1}{4}) from both sides:  [  frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{3}{2}  ]We solve the system of equations:1. ( a + b = 0 )2. ( frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{3}{2} )From the first equation, ( b = -a ). Substituting ( b = -a ) into the second equation:[frac{a}{2} - a = -frac{3}{2} implies -frac{a}{2} = -frac{3}{2} implies a = 3]Thus, ( b = -3 ).The explicit formula for ( f(x) ) is (boxed{4^x + 3 cdot 2^x - 3}).(2) To find the range of ( f(x) ) when ( 0 leq x leq 2 ):- Substitute ( t = 2^x ). When ( x ) ranges from 0 to 2, ( t ) ranges from 1 to 4.- The function becomes ( f(t) = t^2 + 3t - 3 ).The quadratic function ( f(t) = t^2 + 3t - 3 ) is analyzed over the interval ( t in [1, 4] ). Since the function is quadratic with a positive leading coefficient, it opens upwards. The vertex is at ( t = -frac{3}{2} ), which is outside the interval [1, 4]. Therefore, the function is increasing on [1, 4].- Minimum value at ( t = 1 ):  [  f(1) = 1^2 + 3 cdot 1 - 3 = 1  ]- Maximum value at ( t = 4 ):  [  f(4) = 4^2 + 3 cdot 4 - 3 = 16 + 12 - 3 = 25  ]The range of ( f(x) ) when ( 0 leq x leq 2 ) is (boxed{[1, 25]}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here with two parts. Let me tackle part (1) first. The function is given as ( f(x) = 4^x + a cdot 2^x + b ). They told me that ( f(0) = 1 ) and ( f(-1) = -frac{5}{4} ), and I need to find the explicit formula for ( f(x) ), which probably means finding the values of ( a ) and ( b ). Let me confirm that.First, let&#39;s recall that ( 4^x ) can be written as ( (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} ), which is also ( (2^x)^2 ). So maybe substituting ( t = 2^x ) could simplify things. But maybe first, I should just plug in the given points into the function to get equations for ( a ) and ( b ).Starting with ( f(0) = 1 ):When ( x = 0 ), ( 4^0 = 1 ), ( 2^0 = 1 ). So:( f(0) = 1 + a cdot 1 + b = 1 )Which simplifies to:( 1 + a + b = 1 )Subtracting 1 from both sides:( a + b = 0 )So equation (1): ( a + b = 0 )Now, the second point is ( f(-1) = -frac{5}{4} ).Calculating ( 4^{-1} = frac{1}{4} ), and ( 2^{-1} = frac{1}{2} ). So:( f(-1) = frac{1}{4} + a cdot frac{1}{2} + b = -frac{5}{4} )Let me write that as:( frac{1}{4} + frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{5}{4} )Subtract ( frac{1}{4} ) from both sides:( frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{5}{4} - frac{1}{4} = -frac{6}{4} = -frac{3}{2} )So equation (2): ( frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{3}{2} )Now, we have two equations:1. ( a + b = 0 )2. ( frac{a}{2} + b = -frac{3}{2} )I can solve this system of equations. Let me subtract the second equation from the first, but maybe substitution is easier here. From equation (1), ( b = -a ). Substitute ( b = -a ) into equation (2):( frac{a}{2} + (-a) = -frac{3}{2} )Simplify the left side:( frac{a}{2} - a = -frac{a}{2} )So:( -frac{a}{2} = -frac{3}{2} )Multiply both sides by -2:( a = 3 )Then, since ( b = -a ), ( b = -3 )Wait, let me check that again.If ( a = 3 ), then from equation (1), ( 3 + b = 0 implies b = -3 ). Let&#39;s verify these values in the original equations.First equation: ( 3 + (-3) = 0 ), which is correct.Second equation: ( frac{3}{2} + (-3) = frac{3}{2} - 3 = frac{3}{2} - frac{6}{2} = -frac{3}{2} ), which matches. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the function is ( f(x) = 4^x + 3 cdot 2^x - 3 ).Wait, let me check if this works with ( f(-1) ).Calculate ( f(-1) = 4^{-1} + 3 cdot 2^{-1} - 3 = frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{2} - 3 ).Convert to quarters: ( frac{1}{4} + frac{6}{4} - frac{12}{4} = (1 + 6 - 12)/4 = (-5)/4 = -frac{5}{4} ). That&#39;s correct.Similarly, ( f(0) = 4^0 + 3 cdot 2^0 -3 = 1 + 3 -3 = 1 ). Correct.So part (1) is solved. The explicit formula is ( f(x) = 4^x + 3 cdot 2^x -3 ).Now, part (2): Find the range of the function ( f(x) ) when ( 0 leq x leq 2 ).Hmm. So we need to find the minimum and maximum values of ( f(x) ) over the interval [0, 2]. Since ( f(x) ) is a combination of exponential functions, which are continuous and differentiable, we can find critical points by taking derivatives and then evaluate the function at critical points and endpoints.Alternatively, maybe substitution. Let&#39;s let ( t = 2^x ). Since ( x ) is between 0 and 2, ( t ) will range from ( 2^0 = 1 ) to ( 2^2 = 4 ). So ( t in [1, 4] ).Then, since ( 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} = (2^x)^2 = t^2 ). Therefore, the function becomes:( f(x) = t^2 + 3t -3 ), where ( t in [1, 4] ).So now, the problem reduces to finding the range of the quadratic function ( f(t) = t^2 + 3t -3 ) over the interval [1, 4].Quadratic functions have a parabola shape, so depending on the leading coefficient, it opens upwards (since coefficient is positive here, 1), so it will have a minimum at its vertex and maximum at one of the endpoints.First, let&#39;s find the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ( at^2 + bt + c ) is at ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ).Here, a = 1, b = 3, so vertex at ( t = -3/(2*1) = -1.5 ). However, our interval is [1, 4], so the vertex is at t = -1.5, which is outside the interval. Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value on [1, 4] will be at the left endpoint t=1, and the maximum at the right endpoint t=4.Wait, but let&#39;s verify. Since the vertex is at t=-1.5, which is to the left of our interval. So on the interval [1,4], the function is increasing because after the vertex, the function increases as t increases. Therefore, the function is increasing on [1,4], so minimum at t=1, maximum at t=4.Therefore, the range is [f(1), f(4)].Compute f(1): ( 1^2 + 3*1 -3 = 1 + 3 -3 = 1 ).Compute f(4): ( 16 + 12 -3 = 25 ).Wait, so the range is [1, 25]. But let me check if the function is indeed increasing on [1,4]. Since the derivative of f(t) with respect to t is 2t +3. At t=1, derivative is 2*1 +3=5&gt;0. At t=4, derivative is 2*4 +3=11&gt;0. So the derivative is always positive on [1,4], meaning the function is strictly increasing. Therefore, the minimum is at t=1 (x=0) and maximum at t=4 (x=2). Therefore, the range is [1,25].But wait, let me check with x in [0,2], t=2^x, so t ranges from 1 to 4. So yes, t is increasing as x increases. Therefore, substituting back, the range of f(x) when x is between 0 and 2 is [1,25].Wait, but let me verify with x=1. At x=1, t=2, so f(1)=4^1 +3*2^1 -3=4 +6 -3=7. Then, according to t substitution, f(t)=2^2 +3*2 -3=4+6-3=7. Correct. So when t=2, which is inside the interval, the function is 7, which is between 1 and 25. So the function goes from 1 at t=1 (x=0) to 25 at t=4 (x=2), increasing all the way. Therefore, the range is [1,25]. Therefore, the answer is [1,25].But let me confirm with another approach. Let&#39;s take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x and see if there are any critical points in [0,2]. The original function is f(x)=4^x +3*2^x -3.Derivative f’(x) = ln4 *4^x + 3*ln2*2^x. Since ln4 and ln2 are positive constants, and 4^x, 2^x are always positive. Therefore, f’(x) is always positive, meaning f(x) is strictly increasing on the entire real line, so in particular on [0,2]. Therefore, the minimum is at x=0, f(0)=1, and maximum at x=2, f(2)=4^2 +3*2^2 -3=16 +12 -3=25. So same conclusion. Thus, the range is [1,25].So part (2)&#39;s answer is [1,25].Final Answer(1) The explicit formula is boxed{f(x) = 4^x + 3 cdot 2^x - 3}.(2) The range of the function on the interval (0 leq x leq 2) is boxed{[1, 25]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = 4^x + a cdot 2^x + b ):1.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those different angles. Let me see if I can simplify this step by step.First, I remember that there are trigonometric identities that allow us to combine cosines, like the sum-to-product formulas. Maybe I can pair some of these terms together to apply those identities. Let me look at the angles involved: π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15, and 7π/15. Let me convert them to degrees to get a better sense. π/15 is 12 degrees, 2π/15 is 24 degrees, 4π/15 is 48 degrees, and 7π/15 is 84 degrees. So we have cos(12°) - cos(24°) - cos(48°) + cos(84°). Not sure if that helps yet, but maybe.Alternatively, perhaps I can group terms in pairs. Let&#39;s see: [cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15)] and [-cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15)]. Maybe these pairs can be simplified using sum-to-product formulas. Let me recall that formula:cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]Similarly, cos B - cos A = 2 sin[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]So for the first pair: cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15). Let me apply the identity here.A = π/15, B = 2π/15So cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(π/15 + 2π/15)/2] sin[(π/15 - 2π/15)/2] = -2 sin(3π/30) sin(-π/30)Simplify the angles: 3π/30 is π/10, and -π/30 is -π/30. Since sin(-x) = -sin(x), this becomes -2 sin(π/10) (-sin(π/30)) = 2 sin(π/10) sin(π/30)So the first pair simplifies to 2 sin(π/10) sin(π/30)Now the second pair: -cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15) = cos(7π/15) - cos(4π/15). Again applying the same identity.A = 7π/15, B = 4π/15cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(7π/15 + 4π/15)/2] sin[(7π/15 - 4π/15)/2] = -2 sin(11π/30) sin(3π/30)Simplify angles: 11π/30 is 66 degrees, and 3π/30 is π/10 or 18 degrees. So this becomes -2 sin(11π/30) sin(π/10)So the second pair simplifies to -2 sin(11π/30) sin(π/10)Therefore, putting it all together:Original expression = [2 sin(π/10) sin(π/30)] + [-2 sin(11π/30) sin(π/10)] = 2 sin(π/10) [sin(π/30) - sin(11π/30)]Now, maybe I can simplify sin(π/30) - sin(11π/30). Let me use another identity here: sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]So A = π/30, B = 11π/30sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(π/30 + 11π/30)/2] sin[(π/30 - 11π/30)/2] = 2 cos(12π/60) sin(-10π/60) = 2 cos(π/5) sin(-π/6)Simplify: sin(-π/6) = -sin(π/6) = -1/2, so this becomes 2 cos(π/5) (-1/2) = -cos(π/5)Therefore, the original expression is 2 sin(π/10) [ -cos(π/5) ] = -2 sin(π/10) cos(π/5)Now, let&#39;s see if we can simplify this product. Maybe use the identity sin A cos B = [sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)] / 2So sin(π/10) cos(π/5) = [sin(π/10 + π/5) + sin(π/10 - π/5)] / 2 = [sin(3π/10) + sin(-π/10)] / 2 = [sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10)] / 2Therefore, the original expression becomes -2 * [ (sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10)) / 2 ] = - [ sin(3π/10 - sin(π/10) ) ] = - sin(3π/10) + sin(π/10)So now we have -sin(3π/10) + sin(π/10). Let me compute these values.First, sin(π/10) is sin(18°), which is (√5 - 1)/4 ≈ 0.3090. Sin(3π/10) is sin(54°), which is (√5 + 1)/4 ≈ 0.8090. Therefore, sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10) = ( (√5 + 1)/4 - (√5 - 1)/4 ) = (2)/4 = 1/2. Wait, but in our expression, it&#39;s -sin(3π/10) + sin(π/10) = -(sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10)) = -1/2. Wait, that can&#39;t be right.Wait, hold on. Let me check:Wait, sin(3π/10) is indeed sin(54°) = (√5 + 1)/4? Wait, no. Wait, sin(18°) is (√5 - 1)/4 multiplied by 2? Wait, actually, sin(18°) = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2, let me recall the exact value.Wait, the exact value of sin(18°) is (√5 - 1)/4 * 2, which is (√5 - 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 - 1)/2. Wait, let&#39;s confirm:sin(18°) = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2? Wait, maybe I should recall that cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Let me check exact values.Yes, from the formula, sin(18°) is (√5 - 1)/4 * 2, but actually, let&#39;s compute it properly.We can recall that sin(18°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2, which simplifies to (sqrt(5) - 1)/2. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Let me compute sin(18°):Using the formula for sin of 18 degrees: Let’s consider a regular pentagon, where the sine of 18 degrees relates to the golden ratio. The exact value is sin(π/10) = sin(18°) = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2, which is (√5 - 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 - 1)/2. Let me verify this:Let’s use the identity that sin(3θ) = 3 sinθ - 4 sin^3θ. Let’s set θ = 18°, then sin(54°) = 3 sin18° - 4 sin^318°. But sin(54°) = cos(36°), and we know cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2? Wait, actually, cos(36°) is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which is (1 + √5)/2 * 1/2. Wait, no, better to recall that cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2.Alternatively, from the pentagon, cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, perhaps I need to calculate it more carefully.Let’s let x = 18°, so 5x = 90°, so sin(5x) = 1. Using the identity sin(5x) = 16 sin^5x - 20 sin^3x + 5 sinx. So setting sin(5x) = 1, we get 16 sin^518° - 20 sin^318° + 5 sin18° - 1 = 0.Let y = sin18°, so 16y^5 - 20y^3 + 5y - 1 = 0. Solving this equation is complex, but it&#39;s known that y = (√5 - 1)/4 is a solution. Wait, let&#39;s check:Let’s plug y = (√5 - 1)/4 into the equation:16y^5 - 20y^3 + 5y - 1.First, compute y = (√5 - 1)/4 ≈ (2.236 - 1)/4 ≈ 1.236/4 ≈ 0.309, which is indeed sin18° ≈ 0.309.But computing 16y^5 - 20y^3 + 5y - 1 would be tedious, but perhaps there is a quadratic factor. Alternatively, we can accept that sin18° = (√5 - 1)/4 multiplied by 2? Wait, perhaps another approach.Alternatively, using the formula for sin(π/10):sin(π/10) = sin(18°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, actually, it&#39;s known that sin(18°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5)-1)/2. Wait, let&#39;s compute (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ (2.236 - 1)/2 ≈ 1.236/2 ≈ 0.618/2 ≈ 0.309, which matches sin18° ≈ 0.309. So yes, sin(18°) = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 - 1)/2. Wait, no, (√5 - 1)/4 * 2 is (√5 - 1)/2. So sin(18°) = (√5 - 1)/2. Hmm, but wait, (√5 - 1)/2 ≈ (2.236 - 1)/2 ≈ 1.236/2 ≈ 0.618. Wait, but sin18° is approximately 0.309, so this can&#39;t be right. There must be a miscalculation here.Wait, perhaps I confused sine and cosine. Let&#39;s check cos(36°). Cos(36°) is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which would be (1 + √5)/2. Let&#39;s compute that: (1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 3.236/2 ≈ 1.618/2 ≈ 0.809, which is correct because cos36° ≈ 0.809. So cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2 = (1 + √5)/2. Wait, but (1 + √5)/2 is the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618, so half of that is ≈0.809, which is correct.Similarly, sin(18°) is equal to (sqrt(5)-1)/4 multiplied by 2? Wait, if we consider the formula for sin(18°):From the identity sin(3*18°) = sin(54°) = cos(36°), which is (1 + √5)/4 * 2. But perhaps another approach is needed.Alternatively, using the half-angle formula. Let me recall that sin(18°) = 2 sin(9°) cos(9°), but that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that sin(θ) = cos(90° - θ). So sin(18°) = cos(72°). And cos(72°) can be related to the golden ratio. From the formula, cos(72°) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2. Wait, but again, I might be mixing things up.Wait, let&#39;s look it up in exact terms. From standard trigonometric exact values:sin(18°) = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2, which is equivalent to (√5 - 1)/2. Wait, but when I compute (√5 - 1)/2 ≈ (2.236 - 1)/2 ≈ 1.236/2 ≈ 0.618, which is actually the value of cos(36°), not sin(18°). So clearly, there is confusion here.Wait, hold on. Let me check:The exact value of sin(18°) is (√5 - 1)/4 * 2, which is (√5 - 1)/2. But as we saw, (√5 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.618, which is actually approximately equal to sin(38°) or cos(52°), which is not right. Wait, this is confusing.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use exact expressions. Let me check an authoritative source.According to standard references, sin(18°) is (√5 - 1)/4 multiplied by 2, which gives (√5 - 1)/2. However, when we calculate (√5 ≈ 2.236), so (2.236 - 1)/2 ≈ 1.236/2 ≈ 0.618. But sin(18°) ≈ 0.309. So there&#39;s a discrepancy here. Therefore, my previous assumption is wrong.Wait, perhaps the exact value is different. Let&#39;s compute sin(18°) correctly.Let’s use the formula for sin(5θ) = 16 sin^5θ - 20 sin^3θ + 5 sinθ. Let θ = 18°, then 5θ = 90°, so sin(5θ) = sin(90°) = 1. Therefore, 1 = 16 sin^5(18°) - 20 sin^3(18°) + 5 sin(18°). Let x = sin(18°), then:16x^5 - 20x^3 + 5x - 1 = 0.This is a quintic equation, but it&#39;s solvable. Let’s try to factor it. Suppose x = 1 is a root: plug x=1: 16 - 20 + 5 -1 = 0. 16-20= -4, -4+5=1, 1-1=0. So x=1 is a root. Therefore, (x - 1) is a factor. Let&#39;s perform polynomial division:Divide 16x^5 -20x^3 +5x -1 by (x -1). Using synthetic division:Coefficients: 16, 0, -20, 0, 5, -1Using root x=1:Bring down 16Multiply by 1: 16Add to next coefficient: 0 +16=16Multiply by1:16Add to next coefficient: -20 +16= -4Multiply by1: -4Add to next coefficient:0 +(-4)= -4Multiply by1: -4Add to next coefficient:5 + (-4)=1Multiply by1:1Add to last term: -1 +1=0So the quotient polynomial is 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1.Therefore, 16x^5 -20x^3 +5x -1 = (x -1)(16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1)=0.So the roots are x=1 and roots of 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1=0. Since sin(18°) is less than 1, we can ignore x=1 and solve the quartic.Let’s set y = x. Let’s write the quartic equation:16y^4 +16y^3 -4y^2 -4y +1 =0This looks complicated, but maybe it factors into quadratics.Let’s suppose it factors as (ay^2 + by +c)(dy^2 + ey +f) =0.Multiply out: ad y^4 + (ae + bd)y^3 + (af + be + cd)y^2 + (bf + ce)y + cf =0.Compare coefficients:ad =16ae + bd=16af + be + cd= -4bf + ce= -4cf=1We need to find integers a,b,c,d,e,f such that these equations are satisfied.Since ad=16, possible pairs (a,d) are (1,16), (2,8), (4,4), (8,2), (16,1). Similarly, cf=1, so c and f are either (1,1) or (-1,-1). Let&#39;s try c=1, f=1.First, try a=4, d=4.Then ad=16.ae + bd=4e +4b=16 =&gt; e + b=4.Next, af + be + cd=4*1 + b*e +4*1=4 + be +4=8 + be= -4 =&gt; be= -12.From e + b=4 and be= -12. So we have a system: b + e=4, b e= -12.Solving: The quadratic equation x^2 -4x -12=0. Discriminant= 16 +48=64. Solutions: (4 ±8)/2= (12/2)=6 or (-4/2)=-2. So b=6, e=-2 or b=-2, e=6.Check if this works. Let&#39;s take b=6, e=-2.Then check next coefficient: bf + ce=6*1 + (-2)*1=6 -2=4. But we need bf + ce= -4. So 4≠-4. Doesn&#39;t work. If we take b=-2, e=6: bf + ce= -2*1 +6*1= -2 +6=4. Again, 4≠-4. So this doesn&#39;t work.Next, try a=8, d=2.Then ad=16.ae + bd=8e +2b=16.af + be + cd=8*1 +b e +2*1=8 + be +2=10 + be= -4 =&gt; be= -14.bf + ce= b*1 + e*1= b + e= -4.So we have:8e +2b=16 =&gt; 4e + b=8b + e= -4be= -14From b + e= -4, we can express b= -4 -e. Substitute into 4e + b=8:4e + (-4 -e)=8 =&gt; 3e -4=8 =&gt;3e=12 =&gt; e=4. Then b= -4 -4= -8.Check be= -8*4= -32≠-14. Not good.Another possible pair a=2, d=8.Then ae + bd=2e +8b=16af + be + cd=2*1 +b e +8*1=2 + be +8=10 + be= -4 =&gt; be= -14bf + ce= b*1 + e*1= b + e= -4From 2e +8b=16 =&gt; e +4b=8Also, b + e= -4Subtract the equations: (e +4b) - (b + e)=8 - (-4) =&gt; 3b=12 =&gt; b=4. Then e= -4 -4= -8Check be=4*(-8)= -32≠-14. Nope.Next, a=16, d=1.ae + bd=16e +1*b=16af + be + cd=16*1 +b e +1*1=16 + be +1=17 + be= -4 =&gt; be= -21bf + ce= b*1 + e*1= b + e= -4From 16e + b=16 and b + e= -4. Let&#39;s solve:From b= -4 -e. Substitute into 16e + (-4 -e)=16 =&gt;15e -4=16 =&gt;15e=20 =&gt;e=4/3≈1.333. Not integer. Not likely.Alternatively, maybe c=-1 and f=-1.Then cf=(-1)(-1)=1.Trying again with c=-1, f=-1.Let’s try a=4, d=4.Then ad=16.ae + bd=4e +4b=16.af + be + cd=4*(-1) +b e +4*(-1)= -4 + be -4= be -8= -4 =&gt; be=4.bf + ce= b*(-1) + e*(-1)= -b -e= -4 =&gt; b + e=4.So, from ae + bd=4e +4b=16 =&gt; e + b=4 (same as above)From be=4 and b + e=4.So the quadratic equation x^2 -4x +4=0 =&gt; (x-2)^2=0 =&gt; x=2. So b=2, e=2.Check: be=2*2=4, which matches. So this works.Thus, the quartic factors as (4y^2 +2y -1)(4y^2 +2y -1)? Wait, no. Wait, a=4, d=4. The factors are (a y^2 +b y +c)(d y^2 +e y +f)= (4y^2 +2y -1)(4y^2 +2y -1). Wait, no, a=4, d=4. Wait, no:Wait, the factors are (a y^2 + b y + c)(d y^2 + e y + f). So with a=4, d=4, c=-1, f=-1, b=2, e=2.Therefore, it factors as (4y^2 +2y -1)(4y^2 +2y -1) = (4y^2 +2y -1)^2. Wait, but multiplying out (4y^2 +2y -1)^2:=16y^4 +16y^3 +4y^2 -8y^2 -4y +1=16y^4 +16y^3 -4y^2 -4y +1, which matches the quartic. Yes.Therefore, the quartic factors as (4y^2 +2y -1)^2=0. Therefore, the roots are the roots of 4y^2 +2y -1=0.Solving 4y^2 +2y -1=0: y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +16)] /8 = [-2 ± sqrt(20)] /8 = [-2 ± 2 sqrt(5)] /8 = [-1 ± sqrt(5)] /4.So the roots are y = [ -1 + sqrt(5) ] /4 and y = [ -1 - sqrt(5) ] /4. Since y = sin(18°) must be positive, we take the positive root: y = [ -1 + sqrt(5) ] /4 ≈ [ -1 + 2.236 ] /4 ≈ 1.236 /4 ≈ 0.309, which matches sin(18°). Therefore, sin(18°) = (√5 -1)/4 * 2? Wait, no, this is (sqrt(5) -1)/4 ≈ 1.236/4 ≈0.309, which is correct. Therefore, sin(π/10) = sin(18°) = (√5 -1)/4.Wait, but (√5 -1)/4 is approximately (2.236 -1)/4 ≈ 1.236/4 ≈0.309, which is correct. So the exact value is sin(π/10) = (√5 -1)/4.Similarly, sin(3π/10) = sin(54°). Let me compute that. Using the same method or known identities.We can use the identity sin(3θ) = 3 sinθ - 4 sin^3θ. Let θ = 18°, so sin(54°) = 3 sin18° - 4 sin^318°. Let&#39;s compute:sin18°= (√5 -1)/4. Let&#39;s compute sin(54°):First, cube sin18°: [(√5 -1)/4]^3 = ( (√5)^3 -3(√5)^2*1 +3(√5)*1^2 -1^3 ) /64 = (5√5 - 3*5 + 3√5 -1)/64 = (8√5 -16)/64 = (8(√5 -2))/64 = (√5 -2)/8.So 3 sin18° = 3*(√5 -1)/4 = (3√5 -3)/4.4 sin^318° =4*(√5 -2)/8 = (√5 -2)/2.Thus, sin54°=3 sin18° -4 sin^318° = (3√5 -3)/4 - (√5 -2)/2 = (3√5 -3)/4 - (2√5 -4)/4 = [3√5 -3 -2√5 +4]/4 = (√5 +1)/4.Therefore, sin(3π/10)= sin54°= (√5 +1)/4. Wait, but (√5 +1)/4≈(2.236 +1)/4≈3.236/4≈0.809, which is correct as sin54°≈0.809.Therefore, sin(3π/10)= (√5 +1)/4.Therefore, going back to our expression: -sin(3π/10) + sin(π/10) = - (√5 +1)/4 + (√5 -1)/4 = [ - (√5 +1) + (√5 -1) ] /4 = [ -√5 -1 +√5 -1 ] /4 = (-2)/4 = -1/2.Wait, so the original expression simplifies to -1/2.But let me recap to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in the steps:Original expression: cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15)Grouped as [cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15)] + [ -cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15) ]Converted each pair using sum-to-product:First pair: 2 sin(π/10) sin(π/30)Second pair: -2 sin(11π/30) sin(π/10)Combined terms: 2 sin(π/10)[ sin(π/30) - sin(11π/30) ]Then used identity sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]Which gave -cos(π/5)Thus expression became -2 sin(π/10) cos(π/5)Then used identity sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] /2Which led to - [ sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10) ]Which became -sin(3π/10) + sin(π/10)Computed sin(3π/10) = (√5 +1)/4, sin(π/10)=(√5 -1)/4Subtracting gives [(√5 +1)/4 - (√5 -1)/4] = 2/4 =1/2Thus - [1/2] = -1/2.So the final result is -1/2. But wait, the question is presented as cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15). Let me check if all steps were correctly followed.Wait, but when I converted the expression step by step, I arrived at -1/2. Let me verify with approximate numerical values.Let me compute each term numerically:cos(π/15): π/15 ≈0.2094 radians ≈12°, cos(12°)≈0.9781cos(2π/15): 2π/15≈0.4189 radians≈24°, cos(24°)≈0.9135cos(4π/15):4π/15≈0.8378 radians≈48°, cos(48°)≈0.6691cos(7π/15):7π/15≈1.466 radians≈84°, cos(84°)≈0.1045Therefore, compute the expression:0.9781 -0.9135 -0.6691 +0.1045 ≈0.9781 -0.9135=0.0646; 0.0646 -0.6691= -0.6045; -0.6045 +0.1045≈-0.5So numerically, it&#39;s approximately -0.5, which is -1/2. So that confirms that the exact value is -1/2. Therefore, the answer is boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}.Final Answerboxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the expression (cos frac{pi}{15} - cos frac{2 pi}{15} - cos frac{4 pi}{15} + cos frac{7 pi}{15}), we can use trigonometric identities and simplify step by step.1. Group the terms:   [   left[ cos frac{pi}{15} - cos frac{2 pi}{15} right] + left[ -cos frac{4 pi}{15} + cos frac{7 pi}{15} right]   ]2.

Combine the results:   [   2 sin left( frac{pi}{10} right) sin left( frac{pi}{30} right) - 2 sin left( frac{11pi}{30} right) sin left( frac{pi}{10} right)   ]   Factor out (2 sin left( frac{pi}{10} right)):   [   2 sin left( frac{pi}{10} right) left[ sin left( frac{pi}{30} right) - sin left( frac{11pi}{30} right) right]   ]4.

Substitute back:   [   2 sin left( frac{pi}{10} right) left( -cos left( frac{pi}{5} right) right) = -2 sin left( frac{pi}{10} right) cos left( frac{pi}{5} right)   ]6.

Final simplification:   [   -2 cdot frac{1}{2} left[ sin left( frac{3pi}{10} right) - sin left( frac{pi}{10} right) right] = -left( sin left( frac{3pi}{10} right) - sin left( frac{pi}{10} right) right)   ]   Using exact values:   [   sin left( frac{3pi}{10} right) = frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4}, quad sin left( frac{pi}{10} right) = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{4}   ]   [   -left( frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4} - frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{4} right) = -left( frac{2}{4} right) = -frac{1}{2}   ]Thus, the final answer is (boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to figure out the value of this trigonometric expression: cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15). Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities that might help simplify this. First, I remember that sometimes combining cosine terms using sum-to-product formulas can be useful. The sum-to-product identities are:cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]Maybe I can group the terms in pairs and apply these identities. Let me see how to group them. The expression is cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15). Looking at the signs, the first two terms have positive and negative, then the next two also have negative and positive. Maybe group cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) and then -cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15). Let me try that.First pair: cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15). Applying the identity cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2].So, substituting A = π/15 and B = 2π/15:-2 sin[(π/15 + 2π/15)/2] sin[(π/15 - 2π/15)/2] = -2 sin[(3π/15)/2] sin[(-π/15)/2] = -2 sin(π/10) sin(-π/30)But sin(-x) = -sin x, so this becomes -2 sin(π/10)(-sin(π/30)) = 2 sin(π/10) sin(π/30)Okay, so the first pair simplifies to 2 sin(π/10) sin(π/30). Let me note that.Second pair: -cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15) = cos(7π/15) - cos(4π/15). Again, using the same identity: cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]Here, A = 7π/15 and B = 4π/15.So, -2 sin[(7π/15 + 4π/15)/2] sin[(7π/15 - 4π/15)/2] = -2 sin[(11π/15)/2] sin[(3π/15)/2] = -2 sin(11π/30) sin(π/10)So the second pair simplifies to -2 sin(11π/30) sin(π/10)Therefore, combining both pairs, the entire expression becomes:2 sin(π/10) sin(π/30) - 2 sin(11π/30) sin(π/10) = 2 sin(π/10)[sin(π/30) - sin(11π/30)]Hmm, maybe factor out the 2 sin(π/10). Then, the term inside the brackets is sin(π/30) - sin(11π/30). Let&#39;s try to simplify that.Using the identity sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]Here, A = π/30 and B = 11π/30, so:2 cos[(π/30 + 11π/30)/2] sin[(π/30 - 11π/30)/2] = 2 cos[(12π/30)/2] sin[(-10π/30)/2] = 2 cos(6π/30) sin(-π/6/2)Wait, let&#39;s compute step by step:(A + B)/2 = (π/30 + 11π/30)/2 = (12π/30)/2 = (2π/5)/2 = π/5(A - B)/2 = (π/30 - 11π/30)/2 = (-10π/30)/2 = (-π/3)/2 = -π/6Therefore, sin A - sin B = 2 cos(π/5) sin(-π/6) = 2 cos(π/5)(-sin(π/6)) = -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/6)So, sin(π/30) - sin(11π/30) = -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/6)Therefore, going back to the expression:2 sin(π/10)[sin(π/30) - sin(11π/30)] = 2 sin(π/10)[ -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/6) ] = -4 sin(π/10) cos(π/5) sin(π/6)Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but maybe we can substitute known values. Let&#39;s recall that sin(π/6) = 1/2, so:-4 sin(π/10) cos(π/5) * 1/2 = -2 sin(π/10) cos(π/5)So now the expression simplifies to -2 sin(π/10) cos(π/5). Maybe another identity can be used here. The product of sine and cosine: sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2So, applying that:sin(π/10) cos(π/5) = [sin(π/10 + π/5) + sin(π/10 - π/5)] / 2 = [sin(3π/10) + sin(-π/10)] / 2Since sin(-x) = -sin x, this becomes [sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10)] / 2Therefore, substituting back into the expression:-2 * [sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10)] / 2 = - [sin(3π/10) - sin(π/10)] = -sin(3π/10) + sin(π/10)So now we have: sin(π/10) - sin(3π/10). Hmm, maybe evaluate these sines numerically? But let&#39;s try another identity.Again, using sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]Here, A = π/10 and B = 3π/10So:sin(π/10) - sin(3π/10) = 2 cos[(π/10 + 3π/10)/2] sin[(π/10 - 3π/10)/2] = 2 cos(4π/20) sin(-2π/20) = 2 cos(π/5) sin(-π/10) = -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/10)Wait, but we just end up back at -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/10), which is the same as before. Hmm, seems like we looped back. Maybe another approach is needed.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the original expression again: cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15)Perhaps instead of grouping the first two and last two terms, maybe another grouping? Let&#39;s see:cos(π/15) + cos(7π/15) - [cos(2π/15) + cos(4π/15)]That could be another way to group them. Let&#39;s try that. So:First group: cos(π/15) + cos(7π/15). Apply the sum formula: 2 cos[(π/15 + 7π/15)/2] cos[(7π/15 - π/15)/2] = 2 cos(8π/30) cos(6π/30) = 2 cos(4π/15) cos(π/5)Second group: cos(2π/15) + cos(4π/15). Similarly, apply the sum formula: 2 cos[(2π/15 + 4π/15)/2] cos[(4π/15 - 2π/15)/2] = 2 cos(6π/30) cos(2π/30) = 2 cos(π/5) cos(π/15)Therefore, the entire expression becomes:2 cos(4π/15) cos(π/5) - 2 cos(π/5) cos(π/15) = 2 cos(π/5) [cos(4π/15) - cos(π/15)]Again, factor out 2 cos(π/5), then the term inside is cos(4π/15) - cos(π/15). Let&#39;s apply the identity cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]So, cos(4π/15) - cos(π/15) = -2 sin[(4π/15 + π/15)/2] sin[(4π/15 - π/15)/2] = -2 sin(5π/30) sin(3π/30) = -2 sin(π/6) sin(π/10)Therefore, substituting back:2 cos(π/5) [ -2 sin(π/6) sin(π/10) ] = -4 cos(π/5) sin(π/6) sin(π/10)Again, sin(π/6) is 1/2, so:-4 cos(π/5) * 1/2 * sin(π/10) = -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/10)Wait, this is the same expression as before. So regardless of grouping, we end up with -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/10). Hmm. So perhaps I need another strategy here.Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of sin and cos of π/5, π/10, etc., since those angles are related. Let&#39;s recall exact values.Known that cos(π/5) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, no. Let me recall exact value:cos(π/5) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2? Wait, actually, cos(π/5) = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, let me compute.Wait, cos(36°) is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 multiplied by 2? Let me check:We know that cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, actually, cos(36°) is (1 + √5)/4 * 2? No, let me recall the exact value.Actually, cos(π/5) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.Let’s consider a regular pentagon. In a regular pentagon, the diagonal over the side is the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2. So, in a 36-72-72 triangle, the ratios can be used to find cos(36°).Alternatively, using the identity that cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, maybe better to recall that:cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2, but actually, it&#39;s cos(36°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, let me compute.Using the double-angle formula: cos(2θ) = 2 cos²θ - 1. Let θ = 36°, then 2θ = 72°, so cos(72°) = 2 cos²(36°) - 1. But cos(72°) is known as (sqrt(5)-1)/4 * 2? Wait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me look it up mentally.Alternatively, from the formula for cos(π/5). Let me recall that cos(π/5) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, actually, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, no. Wait, cos(36°) is equal to (1 + √5)/4 multiplied by 2. Let me compute numerically:√5 ≈ 2.236, so (1 + √5)/4 ≈ (3.236)/4 ≈ 0.809, and 0.809 * 2 ≈ 1.618, which is the golden ratio. But cos(36°) ≈ 0.8090, which is exactly (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, no. Wait, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 is approximately (2.236 + 1)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809, so that&#39;s actually cos(36°). Therefore, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? No, wait, if (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 ≈ 0.809, which is exactly cos(36°). Therefore, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, no. Wait, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 is approximately 0.809, which is exactly cos(36°). Therefore, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 ≈ 0.809. Wait, yes. So, cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no:Wait, π/5 radians is 36 degrees, correct. So, cos(π/5) = cos(36°). Let&#39;s compute it using exact value. From the pentagon, we can derive that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, let me check:From the identity that in a regular pentagon, the cosine of 36 degrees relates to the golden ratio. The exact value is:cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 × 2. Wait, actually, let&#39;s recall that cos(36°) is equal to (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 multiplied by 2. Let me use the double-angle formula.Let’s let θ = 36°, so 2θ = 72°, and 3θ = 108°. We can use the identity:cos(2θ) = 2 cos²θ - 1. So, cos(72°) = 2 cos²(36°) - 1. But cos(72°) is known to be (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, perhaps another approach.Alternatively, using the identity for sin(2θ):sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθBut perhaps a better approach is to solve for cos(36°):Let’s set x = cos(36°). Then, since 36° is related to the pentagon, we can use the equation:cos(3θ) = cos(2θ), when θ = 36°, but wait:Alternatively, in a regular pentagon, the central angles are 72°, so maybe using trigonometric identities for pentagons.Alternatively, use the formula for cos(36°):From the identity, 2 cos(36°) = 2 cos(π/5) = golden ratio φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618. Therefore, cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, actually, if 2 cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * 2? Wait, no:Wait, actually, in the pentagon, the golden ratio φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618, and 2 cos(π/5) = φ. Therefore, cos(π/5) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no:Wait, 2 cos(36°) = φ. Therefore, cos(36°) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618, so cos(36°) = φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809, which matches the approximate value. Therefore, cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no, cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 is incorrect because (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809, which is already the correct value. So cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 × 2? No, just (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 ≈ 0.809. Wait, no, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 ≈ (2.236 + 1)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809, which is correct. Therefore, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 × 2? No, that would be approximately 1.618, which is φ. Wait, I&#39;m getting confused.Wait, let&#39;s just take cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090, sin(π/10) ≈ 0.3090. Let&#39;s compute -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/10):-2 * 0.8090 * 0.3090 ≈ -2 * 0.8090 * 0.3090 ≈ -2 * 0.25 ≈ -0.5. Hmm, interesting. So numerically, the value is approximately -0.5. But is it exactly -1/2? Let&#39;s check.If -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/10) = -1/2, then cos(π/5) sin(π/10) = 1/4. Let&#39;s verify this.We know that sin(π/10) = sin(18°) ≈ 0.3090, and cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090. Multiplying them gives approximately 0.8090 * 0.3090 ≈ 0.25, which is 1/4. Therefore, cos(π/5) sin(π/10) = 1/4. Therefore, -2 * 1/4 = -1/2. So the expression simplifies to -1/2.Therefore, the original expression is equal to -1/2. But wait, let me verify this with another method to be sure.Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers. Express all cosines in terms of exponentials.But that might be complicated, but let&#39;s try. Remember that cosθ = (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) / 2.So, let&#39;s write each term:cos(π/15) = (e^{iπ/15} + e^{-iπ/15}) / 2-cos(2π/15) = - (e^{i2π/15} + e^{-i2π/15}) / 2-cos(4π/15) = - (e^{i4π/15} + e^{-i4π/15}) / 2cos(7π/15) = (e^{i7π/15} + e^{-i7π/15}) / 2Adding them all up:[ (e^{iπ/15} + e^{-iπ/15}) / 2 ] - [ (e^{i2π/15} + e^{-i2π/15}) / 2 ] - [ (e^{i4π/15} + e^{-i4π/15}) / 2 ] + [ (e^{i7π/15} + e^{-i7π/15}) / 2 ]Combine the terms:= [e^{iπ/15} + e^{-iπ/15} - e^{i2π/15} - e^{-i2π/15} - e^{i4π/15} - e^{-i4π/15} + e^{i7π/15} + e^{-i7π/15}] / 2Let me list all exponents:Positive exponents: e^{iπ/15}, -e^{i2π/15}, -e^{i4π/15}, e^{i7π/15}Negative exponents: e^{-iπ/15}, -e^{-i2π/15}, -e^{-i4π/15}, e^{-i7π/15}Let me see if these exponents can be paired or simplified. Let&#39;s note that 7π/15 = π - 8π/15. So, e^{i7π/15} = e^{i(π - 8π/15)} = e^{iπ} e^{-i8π/15} = -e^{-i8π/15}Similarly, e^{-i7π/15} = -e^{i8π/15}So substituting back:Positive exponents: e^{iπ/15}, -e^{i2π/15}, -e^{i4π/15}, -e^{-i8π/15}Negative exponents: e^{-iπ/15}, -e^{-i2π/15}, -e^{-i4π/15}, -e^{i8π/15}Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let&#39;s check if any exponents are equal or can be combined. For example, 8π/15 is equal to 8π/15, but other terms are π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15.Wait, note that 8π/15 = π - 7π/15, but already considered. Alternatively, note that 8π/15 = 2π/15 + 6π/15 = 2π/15 + 2π/5. Not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if terms cancel. For example, is there a term that cancels with another?Looking at the positive exponents: e^{iπ/15}, -e^{i2π/15}, -e^{i4π/15}, -e^{-i8π/15}Negative exponents: e^{-iπ/15}, -e^{-i2π/15}, -e^{-i4π/15}, -e^{i8π/15}If we consider all terms, perhaps group terms with exponents adding to zero? But complex exponentials with different exponents don&#39;t directly cancel unless their exponents are negatives.Wait, for example, e^{iπ/15} and e^{-iπ/15} are present in the expression. Similarly, -e^{i2π/15} and -e^{-i2π/15}, etc.But let&#39;s compute the entire sum:Let me write all terms:Positive exponents:1. e^{iπ/15}2. -e^{i2π/15}3. -e^{i4π/15}4. -e^{-i8π/15}Negative exponents:5. e^{-iπ/15}6. -e^{-i2π/15}7. -e^{-i4π/15}8. -e^{i8π/15}So total terms are:[1] e^{iπ/15} [2] -e^{i2π/15}[3] -e^{i4π/15}[4] -e^{-i8π/15}[5] e^{-iπ/15}[6] -e^{-i2π/15}[7] -e^{-i4π/15}[8] -e^{i8π/15}Hmm, terms 1 and 5: e^{iπ/15} + e^{-iπ/15} = 2 cos(π/15)Terms 2 and 6: -e^{i2π/15} - e^{-i2π/15} = -2 cos(2π/15)Terms 3 and 7: -e^{i4π/15} - e^{-i4π/15} = -2 cos(4π/15)Terms 4 and 8: -e^{-i8π/15} - e^{i8π/15} = -2 cos(8π/15)Therefore, the total sum is:[2 cos(π/15) - 2 cos(2π/15) - 2 cos(4π/15) - 2 cos(8π/15)] / 2Wait, but the original expression is [sum of terms]/2. So:Original expression = [2 cos(π/15) - 2 cos(2π/15) - 2 cos(4π/15) - 2 cos(8π/15)] / 2= [cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) - cos(8π/15)]But wait, the original problem was cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15). So in this complex exponential approach, we ended up with an extra term -cos(8π/15) instead of +cos(7π/15). But cos(7π/15) = cos(π - 8π/15) = -cos(8π/15). Therefore, cos(7π/15) = -cos(8π/15). Therefore, the expression here is equivalent to:cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) - cos(8π/15) = cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15)Because replacing -cos(8π/15) with +cos(7π/15). Therefore, the result from the complex exponential method is the same as the original expression. So the total sum is [expression] / 2? Wait, no. Wait, in the complex exponential approach, we had:The total sum was [sum of exponentials] / 2, and that sum of exponentials grouped into 2 cos terms, leading to:[2 cos(π/15) - 2 cos(2π/15) - 2 cos(4π/15) - 2 cos(8π/15)] / 2 = cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) - cos(8π/15)But the original problem is cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15). Since cos(7π/15) = -cos(8π/15), this is equivalent, so the total expression is indeed equal to cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) - cos(8π/15). Therefore, that approach gives us the same thing. Therefore, perhaps another path.Alternatively, note that 8π/15 = π - 7π/15, so cos(8π/15) = -cos(7π/15). Therefore, the expression from the complex method is cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15), which is exactly the original problem. Therefore, in that case, the entire sum is equal to [sum of exponentials]/2, but we saw that sum of exponentials equals 2[cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15)], so that&#39;s 2*(original expression), so the original expression is equal to [sum of exponentials]/2. Wait, no, that seems circular.Alternatively, perhaps this method isn&#39;t helping. Let&#39;s go back to the previous result where we had the expression equal to -1/2. Since numerically, the value approximates to -0.5, and through symbolic manipulation we arrived at -2 cos(π/5) sin(π/10) which equals -1/2, then maybe the answer is indeed -1/2. But let&#39;s verify with actual numerical computation. Let me compute each term:Compute cos(π/15): π ≈ 3.1416, π/15 ≈ 0.2094 radians ≈ 12 degrees. cos(12°) ≈ 0.9781cos(2π/15): 2π/15 ≈ 0.4189 radians ≈ 24 degrees. cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135cos(4π/15): 4π/15 ≈ 0.8378 radians ≈ 48 degrees. cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691cos(7π/15): 7π/15 ≈ 1.466 radians ≈ 84 degrees. cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045Now compute the expression:cos(π/15) - cos(2π/15) - cos(4π/15) + cos(7π/15) ≈ 0.9781 - 0.9135 - 0.6691 + 0.1045 ≈First, 0.9781 - 0.9135 = 0.0646Then, 0.0646 - 0.6691 = -0.6045Then, -0.6045 + 0.1045 = -0.5Wow, exactly -0.5. So numerically, it&#39;s -1/2. Therefore, despite the complicated symbolic manipulation, the answer is simply -1/2. Therefore, the original expression equals -1/2.But let me see if there&#39;s a smarter way to get there. Maybe using symmetry or known identities.Alternatively, note that π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15, 7π/15 are all angles related to the 15-gon. Maybe there is a trigonometric identity for these specific angles.Alternatively, use the identity for sum of cosines with arithmetic progression, but I don&#39;t recall exactly.Alternatively, consider the roots of unity. The angles π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15, 7π/15, etc., are related to the 30th roots of unity or something. But this might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, consider that 7π/15 = π/2 - π/30. Wait, π/2 is 15π/30, so π/2 - π/30 = 14π/30 = 7π/15. So cos(7π/15) = cos(π/2 - π/30) = sin(π/30). Similarly, maybe express other terms in terms of sine.Wait, cos(π/15) = cos(12°) = sin(78°), but not sure if that helps.Alternatively, note that:cos(π/15) = cos(12°)cos(2π/15) = cos(24°)cos(4π/15) = cos(48°)cos(7π/15) = cos(84°)So the expression is cos(12°) - cos(24°) - cos(48°) + cos(84°). Hmmm. Let me compute these in degrees:cos(12°) ≈ 0.9781cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045So same as before, 0.9781 - 0.9135 - 0.6691 + 0.1045 ≈ -0.5. So yes, it&#39;s exactly -0.5.Alternatively, maybe use the identity for cos A + cos B - cos C - cos D in some way. Alternatively, think of this as [cos(12°) + cos(84°)] - [cos(24°) + cos(48°)]. Let&#39;s compute each group.First group: cos(12°) + cos(84°). Using sum formula:2 cos[(12 + 84)/2] cos[(84 - 12)/2] = 2 cos(48°) cos(36°)Second group: cos(24°) + cos(48°). Similarly:2 cos[(24 + 48)/2] cos[(48 - 24)/2] = 2 cos(36°) cos(12°)Therefore, the expression becomes:2 cos(48°) cos(36°) - 2 cos(36°) cos(12°) = 2 cos(36°)[cos(48°) - cos(12°)]Again, factor out 2 cos(36°). Then, inside: cos(48°) - cos(12°). Using the identity cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]So:cos(48°) - cos(12°) = -2 sin[(48° + 12°)/2] sin[(48° - 12°)/2] = -2 sin(30°) sin(18°)Thus, substituting back:2 cos(36°) [ -2 sin(30°) sin(18°) ] = -4 cos(36°) sin(30°) sin(18°)sin(30°) = 1/2, so:-4 cos(36°) * 1/2 * sin(18°) = -2 cos(36°) sin(18°)Now, cos(36°) sin(18°). Let&#39;s compute this product.Recall that sin(18°) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/4 ≈ 0.3090, and cos(36°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 ≈ 0.8090.Multiplying them: 0.8090 * 0.3090 ≈ 0.25, which is 1/4. Therefore, cos(36°) sin(18°) = 1/4.Therefore, -2 * (1/4) = -1/2. Therefore, the expression equals -1/2.So after multiple approaches and verifications, both symbolic and numerical, the result is -1/2. Hence, the answer is boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}.Final Answerboxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the expression (cos frac{pi}{15} - cos frac{2 pi}{15} - cos frac{4 pi}{15} + cos frac{7 pi}{15}), we can use trigonometric identities and numerical verification.1. Grouping Terms and Using Sum-to-Product Identities:   - Group the terms as (left(cos frac{pi}{15} - cos frac{2 pi}{15}right) + left(-cos frac{4 pi}{15} + cos frac{7 pi}{15}right)).   - Apply the identity (cos A - cos B = -2 sin frac{A+B}{2} sin frac{A-B}{2}):     - For (cos frac{pi}{15} - cos frac{2 pi}{15}):       [       -2 sin frac{3pi}{30} sin left(-frac{pi}{30}right) = 2 sin frac{pi}{10} sin frac{pi}{30}       ]     - For (cos frac{7 pi}{15} - cos frac{4 pi}{15}):       [       -2 sin frac{11pi}{30} sin frac{pi}{10}       ]   - Combine the results:     [     2 sin frac{pi}{10} sin frac{pi}{30} - 2 sin frac{11pi}{30} sin frac{pi}{10}     ]   - Factor out common terms and simplify using identities:     [     2 sin frac{pi}{10} left(sin frac{pi}{30} - sin frac{11pi}{30}right)     ]     - Use (sin A - sin B = 2 cos frac{A+B}{2} sin frac{A-B}{2}):       [       -2 cos frac{pi}{5} sin frac{pi}{6} = -2 cos frac{pi}{5} cdot frac{1}{2} = -cos frac{pi}{5}       ]   - Further simplification leads to:     [     -2 cos frac{pi}{5} sin frac{pi}{10}     ]2. Numerical Verification:   - Compute each term numerically:     - (cos frac{pi}{15} approx 0.9781)     - (cos frac{2pi}{15} approx 0.9135)     - (cos frac{4pi}{15} approx 0.6691)     - (cos frac{7pi}{15} approx 0.1045)   - Calculate the expression:     [     0.9781 - 0.9135 - 0.6691 + 0.1045 approx -0.5     ]3. Final Simplification:   - Recognize that (cos frac{pi}{5} sin frac{pi}{10} = frac{1}{4}), leading to:     [     -2 cdot frac{1}{4} = -frac{1}{2}     ]Thus, the value of the expression is (boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>(7) -frac{1}{2} Hint:begin{aligned}text { Original expression } &amp; =left(cos frac{pi}{15}+cos frac{7 pi}{15}right)-left(cos frac{2 pi}{15}+cos frac{4 pi}{15}right) &amp; =2 cos frac{4 pi}{15} cos frac{pi}{5}-2 cos frac{pi}{15} cos frac{pi}{5} &amp; =2 cos frac{pi}{5}left(cos frac{4 pi}{15}-cos frac{pi}{15}right) &amp; =-4 cos frac{pi}{5} sin frac{pi}{6} sin frac{pi}{10} &amp; =-2 cos frac{pi}{5} sin frac{pi}{10}=-frac{1}{2} .end{aligned}(Note: From sin 72^{circ}=2 sin 36^{circ} cos 36^{circ}=4 sin 18^{circ} cos 18^{circ} cos 36^{circ}, we get sin 18^{circ} cos 36^{circ}=frac{1}{4}, i.e., cos frac{pi}{5} sin frac{pi}{10}=frac{1}{4}.)</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b7f219 data-v-a10afc05><div class="review" data-v-a10afc05><div class="review-title" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>❓:</span>Arrange 300 centimeters, 2 meters, 80 decimeters, 900 millimeters, and 1 kilometer in ascending order.</div><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to arrange these different units in ascending order, which means from the smallest to the largest. The units given are 300 centimeters, 2 meters, 80 decimeters, 900 millimeters, and 1 kilometer. Hmm, all of these are metric units, which is good because they should be easier to convert. Let me recall the metric system conversions.First, I remember that the metric system is based on meters. The prefixes like centi-, deci-, milli-, and kilo- denote factors of 10. So, let me jot down the conversion factors:- Kilometer (km) is 1000 meters (10^3)- Meter (m) is the base unit- Decimeter (dm) is 0.1 meters (10^-1)- Centimeter (cm) is 0.01 meters (10^-2)- Millimeter (mm) is 0.001 meters (10^-3)So, to compare all these, I need to convert each measurement to the same unit. Since meters are the base unit, maybe converting everything to meters would make sense. Alternatively, I could convert to centimeters or millimeters, but meters might be easier here because some are already in meters. Let me try converting each one to meters.Starting with 300 centimeters. Since 1 cm = 0.01 meters, then 300 cm * 0.01 m/cm = 3 meters. So, 300 cm is 3 meters.Next, 2 meters is already in meters, so that&#39;s straightforward: 2 meters.Then, 80 decimeters. Since 1 dm = 0.1 meters, 80 dm * 0.1 m/dm = 8 meters. So, 80 decimeters is 8 meters.900 millimeters. 1 mm = 0.001 meters, so 900 mm * 0.001 m/mm = 0.9 meters. So, 900 mm is 0.9 meters.Lastly, 1 kilometer. 1 km is 1000 meters, so that&#39;s 1000 meters.Okay, so converting all to meters, we have:- 300 cm = 3 m- 2 m = 2 m- 80 dm = 8 m- 900 mm = 0.9 m- 1 km = 1000 mNow, arranging these converted values in ascending order (from smallest to largest):0.9 m, 2 m, 3 m, 8 m, 1000 mTranslating back to the original units, that would be:900 millimeters, 2 meters, 300 centimeters, 80 decimeters, 1 kilometer.Let me just double-check my conversions to make sure I didn&#39;t mix up any decimal places. It&#39;s easy to make a mistake with the exponents.Starting with 900 millimeters to meters: 900 divided by 1000 is indeed 0.9. Correct.2 meters is already meters. Good.300 centimeters: 300 divided by 100 is 3. Correct.80 decimeters: 80 divided by 10 is 8. Wait, 1 decimeter is 0.1 meters, so 80 * 0.1 is 8. Correct.1 kilometer is 1000 meters. Correct.So the order seems right. 0.9, 2, 3, 8, 1000. So ascending order. Therefore, the original units in order are 900 mm, 2 m, 300 cm, 80 dm, 1 km.I think that&#39;s it. Let me just visualize the sizes. 900 millimeters is less than a meter, then 2 meters, then 300 centimeters which is 3 meters, followed by 80 decimeters which is 8 meters, and then the kilometer is way bigger. Yep, that makes sense. So the order is correct.Final AnswerThe ascending order is boxed{900 text{millimeters}, 2 text{meters}, 300 text{centimeters}, 80 text{decimeters}, 1 text{kilometer}}.&lt;/think&gt;To arrange 300 centimeters, 2 meters, 80 decimeters, 900 millimeters, and 1 kilometer in ascending order, we first convert all measurements to meters:- 300 centimeters: (300 , text{cm} times 0.01 , text{m/cm} = 3 , text{m})- 2 meters: Already in meters, so (2 , text{m})- 80 decimeters: (80 , text{dm} times 0.1 , text{m/dm} = 8 , text{m})- 900 millimeters: (900 , text{mm} times 0.001 , text{m/mm} = 0.9 , text{m})- 1 kilometer: (1 , text{km} times 1000 , text{m/km} = 1000 , text{m})Now, converting all values to meters, we have:- (0.9 , text{m}) (900 millimeters)- (2 , text{m}) (2 meters)- (3 , text{m}) (300 centimeters)- (8 , text{m}) (80 decimeters)- (1000 , text{m}) (1 kilometer)Arranging these values in ascending order:[0.9 , text{m}, , 2 , text{m}, , 3 , text{m}, , 8 , text{m}, , 1000 , text{m}]Translating back to the original units:[900 , text{millimeters}, , 2 , text{meters}, , 300 , text{centimeters}, , 80 , text{decimeters}, , 1 , text{kilometer}][boxed{900 text{millimeters}, 2 text{meters}, 300 text{centimeters}, 80 text{decimeters}, 1 text{kilometer}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to arrange these measurements in ascending order, which means from the smallest to the largest. The measurements given are 300 centimeters, 2 meters, 80 decimeters, 900 millimeters, and 1 kilometer. Hmm, they are all in different units, so I think the first step is to convert all of them to the same unit so that I can compare them properly. Let me decide which unit to convert everything to. Maybe meters would be a good choice since some are already in meters and kilometers, and the others can be converted to meters without too much trouble.Alright, let&#39;s start with each one:1. 300 centimeters: I know that &quot;centi-&quot; means one hundredth, so 1 centimeter is 0.01 meters. Therefore, 300 centimeters would be 300 * 0.01 meters. Let me calculate that: 300 * 0.01 = 3 meters. So, 300 cm = 3 m.2. 2 meters: That&#39;s already in meters, so that&#39;s straightforward. 2 meters stays 2 m.3. 80 decimeters: &quot;Deci-&quot; means one tenth, so 1 decimeter is 0.1 meters. Therefore, 80 decimeters is 80 * 0.1 meters. Let me do the math: 80 * 0.1 = 8 meters. So, 80 dm = 8 m.4. 900 millimeters: &quot;Milli-&quot; means one thousandth, so 1 millimeter is 0.001 meters. Therefore, 900 millimeters is 900 * 0.001 meters. Calculating that: 900 * 0.001 = 0.9 meters. So, 900 mm = 0.9 m.5. 1 kilometer: &quot;Kilo-&quot; means one thousand, so 1 kilometer is 1000 meters. Therefore, 1 km = 1000 m.Now that I have all the measurements converted to meters, let me list them again:- 300 cm = 3 m- 2 m = 2 m- 80 dm = 8 m- 900 mm = 0.9 m- 1 km = 1000 mNow, arranging these values in ascending order (from smallest to largest):Starting with the smallest: 0.9 m (which was 900 mm), then 2 m, followed by 3 m (300 cm), then 8 m (80 dm), and the largest is 1000 m (1 km). Wait a second, 1 kilometer is 1000 meters, which is way bigger than the others. So yes, that makes sense. Let me just double-check each conversion to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.- 300 cm to m: 300 divided by 100 is 3. Correct.- 2 m stays 2 m. Correct.- 80 dm to m: 80 divided by 10 is 8. Correct.- 900 mm to m: 900 divided by 1000 is 0.9. Correct.- 1 km to m: 1 multiplied by 1000 is 1000. Correct.So the order is 0.9 m, 2 m, 3 m, 8 m, 1000 m. Translating these back to their original units, it would be 900 millimeters, 2 meters, 300 centimeters, 80 decimeters, and 1 kilometer.Let me just confirm that none of the converted values are the same. All are distinct. So ascending order from smallest to largest is correct. Hmm, wait, 80 decimeters is 8 meters, which is more than 3 meters. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So, 0.9, 2, 3, 8, 1000. Yep, that seems right. So the final order should be 900 mm, 2 m, 300 cm, 80 dm, 1 km.Final AnswerThe ascending order is boxed{900 text{millimeters}, 2 text{meters}, 300 text{centimeters}, 80 text{decimeters}, 1 text{kilometer}}.&lt;/think&gt;To arrange 300 centimeters, 2 meters, 80 decimeters, 900 millimeters, and 1 kilometer in ascending order, we first convert all measurements to meters:1. 300 centimeters to meters:     ( 300 , text{cm} times 0.01 , text{m/cm} = 3 , text{m} )2. 2 meters remains:     ( 2 , text{m} )3. 80 decimeters to meters:     ( 80 , text{dm} times 0.1 , text{m/dm} = 8 , text{m} )4. 900 millimeters to meters:     ( 900 , text{mm} times 0.001 , text{m/mm} = 0.9 , text{m} )5. 1 kilometer to meters:     ( 1 , text{km} times 1000 , text{m/km} = 1000 , text{m} )Now, we have the converted values:  - 300 cm = 3 m  - 2 m = 2 m  - 80 dm = 8 m  - 900 mm = 0.9 m  - 1 km = 1000 m  Arranging these values in ascending order:  0.9 m, 2 m, 3 m, 8 m, 1000 m  Converting back to the original units:  900 millimeters, 2 meters, 300 centimeters, 80 decimeters, 1 kilometer  The ascending order is:  boxed{900 text{millimeters}, 2 text{meters}, 300 text{centimeters}, 80 text{decimeters}, 1 text{kilometer}}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>Analysis: To convert 300 centimeters into meters, divide 300 by the conversion factor 100;  To convert 80 decimeters into meters, divide 80 by the conversion factor 10;  To convert 900 millimeters into meters, divide 900 by the conversion factor 1000;  To convert 1 kilometer into meters, multiply 1 by the conversion factor 1000.Therefore, the conversion results are as follows:  - 300 centimeters = 300 div 100 = 3 meters  - 80 decimeters = 80 div 10 = 8 meters  - 900 millimeters = 900 div 1000 = 0.9 meters  - 1 kilometer = 1 times 1000 = 1000 meters  Arranging them in ascending order, we get:  0.9 meters (900 millimeters), 2 meters, 3 meters (300 centimeters), 8 meters (80 decimeters), 1000 meters (1 kilometer).Thus, the final answer is:   boxed{900 text{ millimeters} &lt; 2 text{ meters} &lt; 300 text{ centimeters} &lt; 80 text{ decimeters} &lt; 1 text{ kilometer}} </p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b7f219 data-v-a10afc05><div class="review" data-v-a10afc05><div class="review-title" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>❓:</span>&quot;The condition &#39;a≠1 or b≠2&#39; is a _______ for &#39;a + b ≠ 3&#39;.&quot;A: Sufficient but not necessary condition  B: Necessary but not sufficient condition  C: Necessary and sufficient condition  D: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition</div><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this logic problem. So the question is: &quot;The condition &#39;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&#39; is a _______ for &#39;a + b ≠ 3&#39;.&quot; The options are about whether it&#39;s a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition. Hmm, I need to recall what necessary and sufficient conditions mean.First, let me remember. A sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the statement must be true. But it might not be the only way the statement can be true. A necessary condition means that for the statement to be true, the condition must be met, but meeting the condition doesn&#39;t necessarily make the statement true. If it&#39;s both, then they imply each other. If neither, then it doesn&#39;t really have that relationship.So the problem is about the relationship between the condition &quot;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&quot; and the statement &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot;. We need to figure out if &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither for &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;.Let me break it down. Let&#39;s consider the original statements. Let&#39;s restate them in logical terms. Let me denote:Let P be the condition: &quot;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&quot;.Let Q be the statement: &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot;.We need to see if P is a sufficient, necessary, etc., condition for Q.So, first, let&#39;s consider the contrapositive or logical implications. Maybe start by looking at the contrapositive.Wait, actually, maybe it&#39;s better to think in terms of when &quot;a + b = 3&quot;. Because if we can relate that to the negation of P, which would be &quot;a = 1 and b = 2&quot;.So, &quot;a + b = 3&quot; would imply that if a and b are such that their sum is 3, then does that mean that a must be 1 and b must be 2? Well, no. For example, a could be 0 and b could be 3, and their sum is 3. So there are other pairs where a + b = 3. Therefore, the negation of Q (&quot;a + b = 3&quot;) does not imply the negation of P (&quot;a = 1 and b = 2&quot;). Therefore, P is not equivalent to Q.Wait, perhaps I need to approach this step by step.First, check if P is a sufficient condition for Q. That is, does &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; imply that &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;?Suppose P is true. So either a is not 1, or b is not 2. Does that necessarily mean a + b is not 3?Take an example. Let&#39;s say a = 2 (which is ≠1) and b =1 (which is ≠2). Then a + b = 3. But here, P is true (since a ≠1 or b ≠2) but Q is false (since a + b = 3). Therefore, P does not imply Q. So P is not a sufficient condition.Wait, that&#39;s a problem. So if P is supposed to be a sufficient condition, but we have a case where P is true and Q is false, then it&#39;s not sufficient. So A is out.Then check if P is a necessary condition for Q. That is, does Q imply P? In other words, if &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;, then must it be that &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot;?Yes. Because if &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;, then it&#39;s not the case that a =1 and b =2. Because if a=1 and b=2, then a + b =3. So by contrapositive, if a + b ≠3, then it is not the case that both a=1 and b=2. Which is equivalent to &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot;. Therefore, Q implies P. So P is a necessary condition for Q.But wait, earlier we saw that P can be true even when Q is false. So P is necessary but not sufficient. Therefore, the answer is B: Necessary but not sufficient condition.Wait, let me confirm that again. If Q is true (a + b ≠3), then P must be true (a ≠1 or b ≠2). Because the only time when P is false is when a=1 and b=2, which would make Q false (since 1 + 2 = 3). Therefore, Q implies P. So P is a necessary condition for Q. But since there are cases where P is true and Q is false (like a=2, b=1), then P is not sufficient. So yes, B is correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s think in terms of sets. The condition P is &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot;, which is the same as all pairs (a, b) except (1, 2). The statement Q is &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;, which includes all pairs except those that sum to 3.So the set of pairs where P is true is everything except (1, 2). The set where Q is true is everything except pairs like (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), etc.So Q is a larger set excluding more elements. Then, if Q is true, then P must be true, because Q being true excludes (1,2) among others. But P being true only excludes (1,2), so there are elements in P that are not in Q. Therefore, Q is a subset of P. So if you have Q, then you must have P. Therefore, P is necessary for Q. But P is not sufficient because P includes more cases where Q is not true.Therefore, B is the answer: Necessary but not sufficient condition.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the relationship between the condition (a neq 1) or (b neq 2) (denoted as (P)) and the statement (a + b neq 3) (denoted as (Q)), we need to analyze whether (P) is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for (Q).1. Sufficient Condition Check:   - We need to check if (P implies Q).   - Example: Let (a = 2) (which satisfies (a neq 1)) and (b = 1) (which satisfies (b neq 2)). Here, (a + b = 3), which makes (Q) false. Since (P) is true but (Q) is false, (P) does not imply (Q). Therefore, (P) is not a sufficient condition.2. Necessary Condition Check:   - We need to check if (Q implies P).   - If (a + b neq 3), then it cannot be the case that both (a = 1) and (b = 2) (since (1 + 2 = 3)). This means (a neq 1) or (b neq 2). Therefore, (Q implies P), making (P) a necessary condition.Since (P) is necessary but not sufficient for (Q), the correct answer is:(boxed{B}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem. The question is about the relationship between two conditions: &quot;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&quot; and &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot;. We need to determine whether the first condition is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for the second one. The options are A, B, C, D as given.First, let me recall what sufficient and necessary conditions mean. A sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, then the statement must be true. However, it might not be the only way the statement can be true. A necessary condition means that for the statement to be true, the condition must be met, but the condition alone might not be enough to guarantee the statement. If something is both necessary and sufficient, then they are equivalent—each implies the other.So, the problem is stating: &quot;The condition &#39;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&#39; is a _______ for &#39;a + b ≠ 3&#39;.&quot; We need to see if &#39;a ≠1 or b≠2&#39; is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither for &#39;a + b ≠3&#39;.Let me start by analyzing the logical relationship between these two statements.First, let&#39;s consider the original statement &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot;. When would this be true? It would be true whenever the sum of a and b is not equal to 3. So, the negation of this statement is &quot;a + b = 3&quot;.Now, the condition given is &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot;. Let&#39;s think about the negation of this condition. The negation of &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is &quot;a =1 and b =2&quot; by De Morgan&#39;s laws. So, the original condition &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is equivalent to the negation of &quot;a =1 and b =2&quot;.So, the condition &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is saying that it&#39;s not the case that both a is 1 and b is 2. Therefore, if either a is not 1 or b is not 2, then we have this condition. But how does this relate to &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;?Let me consider examples to test sufficiency and necessity.First, test if &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is a sufficient condition for &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;. That would mean that whenever &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is true, then &quot;a + b ≠3&quot; must also be true. Let&#39;s see.Take a case where a ≠1 or b ≠2. Suppose a = 2 and b = 1. Here, a ≠1 (since 2≠1) and b ≠2 (since 1≠2). So both parts of the condition are true. Then a + b = 3. Wait, so in this case, &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is true, but &quot;a + b ≠3&quot; is false. That would mean the condition is not sufficient because there exists a case where the condition holds, but the statement does not. Therefore, sufficiency is not met.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. If a =2 and b =1, then &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is true because a is not 1, and also b is not 2. However, a + b =3, so &quot;a + b ≠3&quot; is false. So this is a counterexample where the condition is true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the condition is not sufficient. So A is out.Now, check if it&#39;s a necessary condition. A necessary condition means that whenever &quot;a + b ≠3&quot; is true, then &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; must also be true. Let&#39;s see. Suppose a + b ≠3. Then, is it necessary that either a ≠1 or b ≠2?Suppose that a + b ≠3. Then, the only case where &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is false is when a =1 and b =2. But if a =1 and b =2, then a + b =3, which is exactly the negation of &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;. Therefore, if &quot;a + b ≠3&quot; is true, then we cannot have a =1 and b =2. Therefore, it must be that either a ≠1 or b ≠2. Therefore, &quot;a + b ≠3&quot; implies &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot;. Therefore, &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is a necessary condition for &quot;a + b ≠3&quot;.But we saw earlier that it&#39;s not sufficient. So the condition is necessary but not sufficient. Therefore, the answer should be B.Wait, let me check another example for necessity. Suppose a =1 and b =3. Then, a + b =4 ≠3. Here, a =1, which is part of the &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; condition. Since a =1, the first part is false, but b =3≠2, so the second part is true. So &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; is true. Another example: a=0 and b=0. Then a + b=0≠3. Here, a≠1 and b≠2, so the condition is true. So in all cases where a + b ≠3, the condition holds. Therefore, it&#39;s necessary.But when the condition holds, does it guarantee a + b ≠3? No. As we saw earlier, a=2 and b=1: condition holds, but a + b=3. Hence, not sufficient. Therefore, the answer is B: Necessary but not sufficient condition.Wait, just to make sure I didn&#39;t mix up necessity and sufficiency. A necessary condition is one that must be true for the statement to be true. So if &quot;a + b ≠3&quot; is true, then &quot;a ≠1 or b ≠2&quot; must be true. Which we saw is the case. But the condition can be true even if &quot;a + b =3&quot;, like when a=2 and b=1. Therefore, it&#39;s not sufficient. Hence, B is correct.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine whether the condition &quot;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&quot; is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot;, we analyze the logical relationship between these statements.1. Sufficient Condition Check:   - A sufficient condition means that if &quot;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&quot; is true, then &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot; must be true.   - Counterexample: Let (a = 2) and (b = 1). Here, (a ≠ 1) and (b ≠ 2) are both true, but (a + b = 3). This shows the condition is not sufficient.2. Necessary Condition Check:   - A necessary condition means that if &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot; is true, then &quot;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&quot; must be true.   - If (a + b ≠ 3), the case where (a = 1) and (b = 2) (which would make (a + b = 3)) is impossible. Therefore, either (a ≠ 1) or (b ≠ 2) must hold. This shows the condition is necessary.Since &quot;a ≠ 1 or b ≠ 2&quot; is necessary but not sufficient for &quot;a + b ≠ 3&quot;, the answer is:boxed{B}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>The correct answer is boxed{text{B}}: Necessary but not sufficient condition.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b7f219 data-v-a10afc05><div class="review" data-v-a10afc05><div class="review-title" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>❓:</span>From four different balls numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, three different balls are selected and placed into three different boxes numbered 1, 2, 3, with each box containing one ball.

So, we have four different balls numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and we need to select three of them and place each into three different boxes numbered 1, 2, 3. Each box must contain exactly one ball. The catch is that ball number 1 should not be in box number 1, and ball number 3 should not be in box number 3. We need to find the total number of ways to do this.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We&#39;re selecting three balls out of four and arranging them in three boxes with specific restrictions. The key constraints are:1. Ball 1 cannot go into Box 1.2. Ball 3 cannot go into Box 3.We have to count all such valid arrangements. Hmm, okay. Let&#39;s break this down.First, the total number of ways to select three balls out of four and arrange them into three boxes without any restrictions. Then, subtract the arrangements that violate the given constraints. But wait, inclusion-exclusion might come into play here because some arrangements might violate both constraints, and we don&#39;t want to subtract those twice. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s better to use the principle of derangements here? But derangements typically apply when each item can&#39;t be in a certain position, similar to our problem. However, we also have the complication that we&#39;re selecting three balls out of four, so it&#39;s not just a permutation of all four balls.Wait, so first step: selecting three balls out of four. The number of ways to choose three balls from four is C(4,3) = 4. Then, for each such selection, we need to arrange them in three boxes with the given restrictions. But depending on which three balls are selected, the restrictions might change. For example, if we don&#39;t select ball 1, then the restriction about ball 1 not being in box 1 becomes irrelevant. Similarly, if we don&#39;t select ball 3, then the restriction about ball 3 not being in box 3 doesn&#39;t apply. So, maybe we need to consider different cases based on which three balls are selected.Let me list all possible selections of three balls from four:1. Balls 1, 2, 32. Balls 1, 2, 43. Balls 1, 3, 44. Balls 2, 3, 4Each of these selections has different constraints. Let&#39;s handle each case separately.Case 1: Balls 1, 2, 3.In this case, we have the restrictions: Ball 1 ≠ Box 1 and Ball 3 ≠ Box 3. So, we need to find the number of permutations of these three balls into three boxes where Ball 1 is not in Box 1 and Ball 3 is not in Box 3. Let&#39;s model this as a derangement problem with two specific restrictions.The total number of permutations without any restrictions is 3! = 6. Now, subtract the permutations where Ball 1 is in Box 1 or Ball 3 is in Box 3. But we have to be careful with inclusion-exclusion here.Let A be the set of permutations where Ball 1 is in Box 1, and B be the set where Ball 3 is in Box 3. We need |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.|A|: Fix Ball 1 in Box 1, then permute Balls 2 and 3 in the remaining two boxes. That&#39;s 2! = 2.|B|: Fix Ball 3 in Box 3, then permute Balls 1 and 2 in the remaining two boxes. That&#39;s 2! = 2.|A ∩ B|: Both Ball 1 in Box 1 and Ball 3 in Box 3. Then, Ball 2 must go into Box 2. So only 1 permutation.Thus, |A ∪ B| = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.Therefore, the number of valid permutations for Case 1 is total permutations minus invalid ones: 6 - 3 = 3.Case 2: Balls 1, 2, 4.Here, the restriction is only Ball 1 ≠ Box 1 because Ball 3 is not selected. So, we need permutations of Balls 1, 2, 4 into Boxes 1, 2, 3 with Ball 1 not in Box 1.Total permutations: 3! = 6.Invalid permutations: when Ball 1 is in Box 1. Fix Ball 1 in Box 1, then permute Balls 2 and 4 in Boxes 2 and 3. That&#39;s 2! = 2.So, valid permutations: 6 - 2 = 4.Case 3: Balls 1, 3, 4.In this case, the restriction is Ball 1 ≠ Box 1 and Ball 3 ≠ Box 3. Similar to Case 1 but with different balls.Total permutations: 3! = 6.Again, let&#39;s use inclusion-exclusion for the two restrictions.Let A be permutations with Ball 1 in Box 1, and B be permutations with Ball 3 in Box 3.|A|: Fix Ball 1 in Box 1, permute Balls 3 and 4 in Boxes 2 and 3. But note that Ball 3 cannot be in Box 3. Wait, hold on. If we fix Ball 1 in Box 1, then Ball 3 and 4 can be in Boxes 2 and 3. However, Ball 3 cannot be in Box 3. So actually, in set A, we fix Ball 1 in Box 1, then the remaining permutations must have Ball 3 not in Box 3. Wait, no. Wait, when we compute |A|, it&#39;s the number of permutations where Ball 1 is in Box 1, regardless of where Ball 3 is. But the original problem states that Ball 3 cannot be in Box 3. However, in Case 3, we&#39;re dealing with the selection of Balls 1, 3, 4, so Ball 3 is present. Therefore, in this case, when considering permutations for this selection, Ball 3 can&#39;t go into Box 3, so even in set A, we have to consider that if we fix Ball 1 in Box 1, then Ball 3 still can&#39;t be in Box 3. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.Wait, actually, no. When we compute the invalid permutations for the problem&#39;s constraints, we need to subtract those permutations where Ball 1 is in Box 1 OR Ball 3 is in Box 3. So in this case, even if we fix Ball 1 in Box 1, but Ball 3 is not in Box 3, that permutation is still invalid because Ball 1 is in Box 1. Similarly, if Ball 3 is in Box 3, regardless of Ball 1&#39;s position, that&#39;s invalid. So, for inclusion-exclusion, we just need to calculate |A| (Ball 1 in Box 1) and |B| (Ball 3 in Box 3) and subtract their intersection.Wait, but in the problem statement, both conditions are required. Wait, actually, no. The problem states that we need arrangements where Ball 1 is not in Box 1 AND Ball 3 is not in Box 3. So, the invalid arrangements are those where Ball 1 is in Box 1 OR Ball 3 is in Box 3. Therefore, using inclusion-exclusion, we need to subtract the union of these two sets.Therefore, similar to Case 1, let&#39;s compute |A|, |B|, and |A ∩ B|.|A|: Ball 1 in Box 1. Then, we have to permute Balls 3 and 4 into Boxes 2 and 3. However, Ball 3 cannot be in Box 3. Wait, hold on. If we fix Ball 1 in Box 1, the remaining two balls (3 and 4) can be placed in Boxes 2 and 3. However, Ball 3 is not allowed in Box 3. So, in this scenario, how many permutations are there?If Ball 1 is in Box 1, then for Balls 3 and 4:- Ball 3 can go to Box 2, then Ball 4 goes to Box 3.- Ball 3 can go to Box 3, but that&#39;s invalid.Therefore, only 1 valid permutation when Ball 1 is in Box 1. Wait, but when we count |A|, which is the number of permutations where Ball 1 is in Box 1, regardless of other constraints? Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that in our case, when we fix Ball 1 in Box 1, we still have to respect the other constraint that Ball 3 is not in Box 3. So actually, even in |A|, the permutations must satisfy both constraints? Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that when we compute the total valid permutations, we need to exclude those that have Ball 1 in Box 1 OR Ball 3 in Box 3. Therefore, when computing |A|, we need to count all permutations where Ball 1 is in Box 1, even if Ball 3 is in Box 3. Similarly, |B| counts all permutations where Ball 3 is in Box 3, even if Ball 1 is in Box 1. Then, their intersection is when both are true. Therefore, inclusion-exclusion applies as usual.But in this case, let&#39;s check:If we are dealing with Case 3 (Balls 1, 3, 4), then:Total permutations: 6.Invalid permutations are those where Ball 1 is in Box 1 OR Ball 3 is in Box 3.Compute |A|: Ball 1 in Box 1. Then, remaining Balls 3 and 4 can be arranged in Boxes 2 and 3 in 2! = 2 ways. But in these 2 ways, some might have Ball 3 in Box 3, which is invalid. Wait, but when we compute |A|, we are just counting the number of permutations where Ball 1 is in Box 1, regardless of where Ball 3 is. Similarly, |B| is the number of permutations where Ball 3 is in Box 3, regardless of Ball 1. So, even though some permutations in |A| might have Ball 3 in Box 3, which is another invalid condition, but for inclusion-exclusion, we just need to count |A| and |B| as separate sets and subtract their intersection.So, |A| is 2 (Ball 1 in Box 1, and the other two balls can be in any order). Similarly, |B| is the number of permutations where Ball 3 is in Box 3. So, fix Ball 3 in Box 3, and arrange Balls 1 and 4 in Boxes 1 and 2. That&#39;s 2! = 2.|A ∩ B|: Both Ball 1 in Box 1 and Ball 3 in Box 3. Then, Ball 4 must be in Box 2. So, only 1 permutation.Thus, |A ∪ B| = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.Therefore, the number of valid permutations for Case 3 is 6 - 3 = 3.Case 4: Balls 2, 3, 4.In this case, the restrictions are Ball 1 is not selected, so the Ball 1 restriction doesn&#39;t apply. But Ball 3 is selected, so Ball 3 ≠ Box 3.Total permutations: 3! = 6.Invalid permutations: Ball 3 in Box 3. Fix Ball 3 in Box 3, then permute Balls 2 and 4 in Boxes 1 and 2. That&#39;s 2! = 2.Therefore, valid permutations: 6 - 2 = 4.Now, summing up the valid permutations for each case:- Case 1: 3- Case 2: 4- Case 3: 3- Case 4: 4Total ways = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14.Wait, so is the answer 14? Let me verify once more to be sure.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a more straightforward way to compute this without splitting into cases. Let&#39;s think about the overall approach.First, the total number of ways to select 3 balls from 4 and arrange them into 3 boxes: C(4,3) * 3! = 4 * 6 = 24.Now, subtract the number of invalid arrangements where Ball 1 is in Box 1 or Ball 3 is in Box 3.But here, we need to compute the number of invalid arrangements across all selections. This might be a bit tricky because depending on the selection, the presence of Ball 1 or Ball 3 affects the invalidity.Alternatively, maybe we can model it as inclusion-exclusion over the entire process.Let me try this approach.Total valid arrangements = Total arrangements - arrangements with Ball 1 in Box 1 - arrangements with Ball 3 in Box 3 + arrangements with both Ball 1 in Box 1 and Ball 3 in Box 3.But to compute these terms:Total arrangements: C(4,3)*3! = 24.Arrangements with Ball 1 in Box 1: We need to fix Ball 1 in Box 1. Then, choose 2 balls from the remaining 3 (since we need 3 balls total, and one is already fixed as Ball 1 in Box 1). Then arrange the remaining 2 balls into Boxes 2 and 3. So, number of such arrangements: C(3,2)*2! = 3*2 = 6.Similarly, arrangements with Ball 3 in Box 3: Fix Ball 3 in Box 3, then choose 2 balls from the remaining 3 (excluding Ball 3). Then arrange them into Boxes 1 and 2. So, again C(3,2)*2! = 3*2 = 6.Arrangements with both Ball 1 in Box 1 and Ball 3 in Box 3: We need to have both Ball 1 and Ball 3 in the selection. So, since we&#39;re selecting 3 balls, and two of them are fixed (Ball 1 and Ball 3), the third ball is chosen from the remaining 2 (Balls 2 and 4). Then, Ball 1 is in Box 1, Ball 3 is in Box 3, and the third ball is in Box 2. There&#39;s only 1 way to arrange once the third ball is chosen. So, number of such arrangements: C(2,1)*1! = 2*1 = 2.Therefore, by inclusion-exclusion:Total invalid arrangements = 6 + 6 - 2 = 10.Therefore, total valid arrangements = 24 - 10 = 14.So, this matches the previous result. Therefore, the answer is 14. So, the final answer is boxed{14}.But let me just cross-verify once again with another method to be absolutely sure.Alternative approach: For each selection of three balls, compute the derangements considering the constraints. Since we have four different cases, as before, let&#39;s check each case again.Case 1: Balls 1,2,3. Constraints: 1≠1, 3≠3. So, how many derangements where 1 is not in position 1 and 3 is not in position 3. For three elements, the derangement for two specific elements. Let me list all permutations:Possible permutations:1. 1,2,3 – invalid (1 in 1 and 3 in 3)2. 1,3,2 – invalid (1 in 1)3. 2,1,3 – invalid (3 in 3)4. 2,3,1 – valid5. 3,1,2 – invalid (3 in 3)6. 3,2,1 – validWait, but according to this, permutations 4 and 6 are valid. Wait, that&#39;s only two. But previously, we had 3. Hmm, something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, let&#39;s list all permutations:1. Box1:1, Box2:2, Box3:3 – both invalid2. Box1:1, Box2:3, Box3:2 – invalid (1 in 1)3. Box1:2, Box2:1, Box3:3 – invalid (3 in 3)4. Box1:2, Box2:3, Box3:1 – valid5. Box1:3, Box2:1, Box3:2 – invalid (3 in 3?)Wait, Box3:2 here, so 3 is in Box1, which is allowed. Wait, 3 is in Box1, which is not restricted. The restriction is Ball 3 cannot be in Box3. So permutation 5: Box1:3, Box2:1, Box3:2 is valid because Ball3 is in Box1, which is okay, and Ball1 is in Box2, which is allowed. So permutation 5 is valid. Similarly, permutation 6: Box1:3, Box2:2, Box3:1 – Ball3 is in Box1, Ball1 is in Box3. So both are okay. So, actually permutations 4,5,6 are valid. So that&#39;s three valid permutations. Therefore, Case1:3.Similarly, for Case3, which is Balls1,3,4. Let&#39;s list permutations:1. Box1:1, Box2:3, Box3:4 – invalid (1 in 1)2. Box1:1, Box2:4, Box3:3 – invalid (1 in 1 and 3 in 3)3. Box1:3, Box2:1, Box3:4 – invalid (3 in 3?)Wait, Box3:4 here, so 3 is in Box1. Wait, no. Ball3 is in Box1, which is allowed. So permutation3: Box1:3, Box2:1, Box3:4 – valid.Permutation4: Box1:3, Box2:4, Box3:1 – Ball3 is in Box1, Ball1 is in Box3, both allowed. Valid.Permutation5: Box1:4, Box2:1, Box3:3 – Ball3 is in Box3, invalid.Permutation6: Box1:4, Box2:3, Box3:1 – Ball3 is in Box2, valid.So valid permutations are 3,4,6 – three permutations. So Case3:3.Case2: Balls1,2,4. Only restriction is Ball1≠1. Let&#39;s list permutations:1. 1,2,4 – invalid2. 1,4,2 – invalid3. 2,1,4 – valid4. 2,4,1 – valid5. 4,1,2 – valid6. 4,2,1 – validSo, four valid permutations. So, 4. Correct.Case4: Balls2,3,4. Only restriction is Ball3≠3. Let&#39;s list permutations:1. 2,3,4 – invalid (3 in 3)2. 2,4,3 – invalid (3 in 3)3. 3,2,4 – valid4. 3,4,2 – valid5. 4,2,3 – invalid (3 in 3)6. 4,3,2 – invalid (3 in 3)So valid permutations are 3 and 4. Wait, that&#39;s two. But earlier, we calculated 4. Wait, conflict here. Wait, no. Wait, in Case4, we have Balls2,3,4. The restriction is Ball3 cannot be in Box3. So:Permutation1: Box1:2, Box2:3, Box3:4 – Ball3 is in Box2, allowed. Valid? Wait, no. Wait, the boxes are numbered 1,2,3. So the box numbers are fixed. The restriction is Ball3 cannot be in Box3, regardless of the other balls. So permutation1: Ball3 is in Box2, which is allowed. So permutation1 is valid.Permutation2: Box1:2, Box2:4, Box3:3 – Ball3 is in Box3, invalid.Permutation3: Box1:3, Box2:2, Box3:4 – Ball3 is in Box1, allowed. Valid.Permutation4: Box1:3, Box2:4, Box3:2 – Ball3 is in Box1, allowed. Valid.Permutation5: Box1:4, Box2:2, Box3:3 – Ball3 is in Box3, invalid.Permutation6: Box1:4, Box2:3, Box3:2 – Ball3 is in Box2, allowed. Valid.Wait, so permutations 1,3,4,6 are valid. That&#39;s four. So, my initial mistake was miscounting. So, total four valid permutations for Case4. Which matches the previous result.So, adding up again: 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14. Therefore, the answer is indeed 14.Alternatively, another way to think about this: For each possible selection of three balls, apply the constraints, compute valid permutations, sum them up. Which we did.Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion on the entire process (selecting and arranging) gives the same answer.Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 14.Final Answerboxed{14}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of determining the number of ways to place three selected balls from four (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4) into three boxes (numbered 1, 2, 3) such that ball 1 is not in box 1 and ball 3 is not in box 3, we consider the following steps:1. Total number of ways to select and arrange three balls:    [   binom{4}{3} times 3! = 4 times 6 = 24   ]2. Subtract invalid arrangements using inclusion-exclusion principle:   - Arrangements with ball 1 in box 1:      [     binom{3}{2} times 2! = 3 times 2 = 6     ]   - Arrangements with ball 3 in box 3:      [     binom{3}{2} times 2! = 3 times 2 = 6     ]   - Arrangements with both ball 1 in box 1 and ball 3 in box 3:      [     binom{2}{1} times 1! = 2 times 1 = 2     ]   - Total invalid arrangements:      [     6 + 6 - 2 = 10     ]3. Calculate valid arrangements:   [   24 - 10 = 14   ]Thus, the total number of valid ways to place the balls is (boxed{14}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, we have four different balls numbered 1 to 4, and we need to select three of them and place each into one of three different boxes numbered 1 to 3. The constraints are that ball 1 shouldn&#39;t be in box 1, and ball 3 shouldn&#39;t be in box 3. We need to find the total number of ways to do this.First, I need to understand the problem correctly. We are selecting three balls out of four and arranging them in three boxes. Each box gets exactly one ball, and the boxes are distinct. So, the order matters here because each box is unique. Therefore, this is a permutation problem with some restrictions.Let me break it down. Normally, if we have to choose 3 balls out of 4 and arrange them in 3 boxes, the number of ways would be the number of permutations of 4 balls taken 3 at a time. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)! So, P(4, 3) = 4! / (4 - 3)! = 24 / 1 = 24. So, normally, there are 24 ways without any restrictions.But here, we have two restrictions: ball 1 cannot be in box 1, and ball 3 cannot be in box 3. So, we need to subtract the arrangements where either of these happens. However, we have to be careful not to double-count the cases where both restrictions are violated.This sounds like a problem where we can apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall: the number of elements in the union of two sets is equal to the sum of the elements in each set minus the number of elements in their intersection. So, in formula terms:|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|Where A is the set of arrangements where ball 1 is in box 1, and B is the set of arrangements where ball 3 is in box 3. Therefore, the number of invalid arrangements is |A ∪ B|, and the valid arrangements would be the total arrangements minus |A ∪ B|.So, total valid = Total arrangements - |A| - |B| + |A ∩ B|Let me compute each of these terms.First, total arrangements: as we calculated earlier, that&#39;s 24.Now, |A|: the number of arrangements where ball 1 is in box 1. If ball 1 is fixed in box 1, then we have to arrange the remaining 3 balls (2, 3, 4) into the remaining 2 boxes. Wait, hold on. Wait, we are selecting 3 balls, so if ball 1 is placed in box 1, we need to select 2 more balls from the remaining 3 (balls 2, 3, 4) and arrange them in boxes 2 and 3.Wait, hold on again. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: when we choose 3 balls out of 4, one of them could be ball 1. If ball 1 is selected and placed in box 1, then that&#39;s an invalid arrangement. But if ball 1 is not selected, then that arrangement is automatically valid in terms of the first restriction. Similarly for ball 3 not being in box 3.Hmm, this complicates things because whether the restrictions apply depends on whether the respective balls are selected. So, maybe my initial approach is missing something.Let me rethink. Since we are selecting 3 balls out of 4, the presence of ball 1 and ball 3 in the selection affects the constraints. For instance, if ball 1 is not selected, then the constraint about ball 1 not being in box 1 is automatically satisfied. Similarly, if ball 3 is not selected, the constraint about ball 3 not being in box 3 is automatically satisfied.Therefore, the problem has different cases based on which balls are selected. Maybe it&#39;s better to approach this by considering different cases:Case 1: Neither ball 1 nor ball 3 is selected.Case 2: Ball 1 is selected, but ball 3 is not.Case 3: Ball 3 is selected, but ball 1 is not.Case 4: Both ball 1 and ball 3 are selected.Then, for each case, we can calculate the number of valid arrangements considering the constraints.This seems like a more structured approach. Let&#39;s try this.Case 1: Neither ball 1 nor ball 3 is selected. So, we have to choose 3 balls from the remaining two balls: 2 and 4. Wait, but there are only two balls left (2 and 4), so we can&#39;t choose 3 balls. Therefore, this case is impossible. So, Case 1 has 0 ways.Case 2: Ball 1 is selected, but ball 3 is not. So, we need to select two more balls from balls 2 and 4. There are 2 balls (2 and 4), so choosing 2 gives us C(2, 2) = 1 combination. So, the selected balls are 1, 2, 4. Now, we need to arrange these three balls into the three boxes such that ball 1 is not in box 1.So, for this case, the number of valid arrangements is the total permutations of balls 1, 2, 4 into boxes 1, 2, 3, minus the permutations where ball 1 is in box 1.Total permutations for three distinct balls in three boxes: 3! = 6.Number of invalid permutations (ball 1 in box 1): Fix ball 1 in box 1, then arrange the remaining two balls (2 and 4) in boxes 2 and 3. That&#39;s 2! = 2. So, valid arrangements for this case: 6 - 2 = 4.Therefore, Case 2 contributes 1 combination (selecting balls 1, 2, 4) multiplied by 4 arrangements: 1 * 4 = 4.Case 3: Ball 3 is selected, but ball 1 is not. Similar to Case 2. We need to select two more balls from balls 2 and 4. Again, C(2, 2) = 1 combination. So, the selected balls are 2, 3, 4. Now, arrange these into boxes 1, 2, 3 with the constraint that ball 3 is not in box 3.Total permutations: 3! = 6.Invalid permutations: ball 3 in box 3. Fix ball 3 in box 3, then arrange balls 2 and 4 in boxes 1 and 2: 2! = 2. So, valid arrangements: 6 - 2 = 4.Therefore, Case 3 contributes 1 * 4 = 4.Case 4: Both ball 1 and ball 3 are selected. So, we need to select one more ball from the remaining two: 2 and 4. So, C(2, 1) = 2 combinations. Therefore, the selected balls could be {1, 3, 2} or {1, 3, 4}.For each of these combinations, we need to arrange the three balls into the three boxes with two constraints: ball 1 not in box 1 and ball 3 not in box 3.So, let&#39;s take the first combination: balls 1, 3, 2.We need to arrange these into boxes 1, 2, 3 such that 1 is not in 1 and 3 is not in 3.Similarly for the second combination: balls 1, 3, 4.So, for each combination, how many valid permutations are there?Let&#39;s consider a general case where we have three balls: 1, 3, and another (either 2 or 4). Let&#39;s denote the third ball as X. We need to find the number of permutations of 1, 3, X into boxes 1, 2, 3, with 1 not in 1 and 3 not in 3.This is equivalent to derangements with two specific restrictions. Let&#39;s recall that derangements are permutations with no element in its original position. Here, we have two elements (1 and 3) that cannot be in specific positions (box 1 and box 3, respectively). The third element (X, which is 2 or 4) has no restrictions.So, perhaps we can compute this using inclusion-exclusion again.Total permutations: 3! = 6.Invalid permutations are those where 1 is in box 1 OR 3 is in box 3. We need to subtract these, but add back the intersection where both 1 is in box 1 and 3 is in box 3.So, number of invalid permutations:Number with 1 in box 1: Fix 1 in box 1, then arrange 3 and X in boxes 2 and 3. That&#39;s 2! = 2. But in these arrangements, 3 could be in box 3, which is another invalid case. Wait, but in this case, we are only counting the arrangements where 1 is in box 1, regardless of where 3 is. Similarly for 3 in box 3.But since we need to compute the union, we can apply inclusion-exclusion here.Number of permutations with 1 in box 1 OR 3 in box 3 = Number with 1 in box 1 + Number with 3 in box 3 - Number with both 1 in box 1 AND 3 in box 3.So:Number with 1 in box 1: 2! = 2 (as above)Number with 3 in box 3: Similarly, fix 3 in box 3, arrange 1 and X in boxes 1 and 2: 2! = 2.Number with both 1 in box 1 AND 3 in box 3: Fix both 1 and 3, then X goes to box 2: 1 way.Therefore, invalid permutations: 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.Therefore, valid permutations: 6 - 3 = 3.So, for each combination in Case 4, we have 3 valid permutations. Since there are 2 combinations (one with X=2 and one with X=4), each contributing 3 permutations, total for Case 4 is 2 * 3 = 6.Now, summing up all cases:Case 1: 0Case 2: 4Case 3: 4Case 4: 6Total ways: 0 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 14.Wait, so the total number of valid arrangements is 14.But let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Let&#39;s use the inclusion-exclusion principle on the total permutations.Total permutations when selecting any three balls: P(4, 3) = 24.Now, let A be the set of permutations where ball 1 is in box 1, and B be the set where ball 3 is in box 3.We need |A ∪ B|, then subtract from 24.First, compute |A|: number of permutations where ball 1 is in box 1. To compute this, we fix ball 1 in box 1, then select and arrange the remaining two balls from the remaining three balls (2, 3, 4) into boxes 2 and 3. Wait, but since we have to choose three balls in total, if we fix ball 1, then we need to choose two more balls from 2, 3, 4 and arrange them in boxes 2 and 3.Wait, so |A| is the number of ways to choose 2 balls from 3 (C(3, 2)) and arrange them in 2 boxes (2!).So, |A| = C(3, 2) * 2! = 3 * 2 = 6.Similarly, |B|: number of permutations where ball 3 is in box 3. Fix ball 3 in box 3, then select two more balls from the remaining three (1, 2, 4) and arrange them in boxes 1 and 2. So, same calculation: C(3, 2) * 2! = 3 * 2 = 6.Now, |A ∩ B|: permutations where both ball 1 is in box 1 and ball 3 is in box 3. Fix both balls 1 and 3 in their respective boxes, then select the remaining ball from the remaining two (2 or 4) and place it in box 2. So, number of ways: C(2, 1) * 1! = 2 * 1 = 2.Therefore, by inclusion-exclusion:|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 6 + 6 - 2 = 10.Therefore, the number of valid permutations is total permutations - |A ∪ B| = 24 - 10 = 14.This matches our previous result. So, the answer should be 14.But let me check with another method. Maybe derangement? But derangement is when none of the elements are in their original position, but here only two specific elements have restrictions. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, we can think of the problem as follows: For each selection of three balls, if it includes ball 1 or ball 3, apply the respective constraints. However, since we already approached it by cases and inclusion-exclusion, and both give 14, I think 14 is correct.But to be thorough, let me enumerate all possible valid arrangements.Wait, maybe not all, but check a few cases.Let&#39;s first list all possible permutations when both ball 1 and 3 are selected. Suppose we have balls 1, 3, 2.Possible permutations with ball 1 not in box 1 and ball 3 not in box 3:Boxes 1, 2, 3.Possible assignments:1. Box1: 2, Box2: 1, Box3: 3 → Invalid (ball 3 in box3)2. Box1: 2, Box2: 3, Box3: 1 → Valid (ball1 in box3, ball3 in box2)3. Box1: 1, Box2: 2, Box3: 3 → Invalid (both balls 1 and 3 in forbidden boxes)4. Box1: 1, Box2: 3, Box3: 2 → Invalid (ball1 in box1)5. Box1: 3, Box2: 1, Box3: 2 → Valid (ball3 in box1, ball1 in box2)6. Box1: 3, Box2: 2, Box3: 1 → Invalid (ball3 in box1 is allowed, but ball1 in box3 is allowed? Wait, no, ball1 is allowed in box3. Wait, ball1 can be anywhere except box1, and ball3 can be anywhere except box3. So, arrangement 6: ball3 in box1 (allowed), ball2 in box2, ball1 in box3 (allowed). So, that&#39;s valid. Wait, but wait, arrangement 6: Box1:3, Box2:2, Box3:1. Ball1 is in box3 (allowed), ball3 is in box1 (allowed). So, this is valid. Wait, but earlier I thought arrangement 6 was invalid. Wait, let me check:Wait, in the list above:1. 2,1,3: ball3 in box3: invalid.2. 2,3,1: valid.3. 1,2,3: both invalid.4. 1,3,2: invalid (ball1 in box1).5. 3,1,2: valid.6. 3,2,1: ball1 in box3 (allowed), ball3 in box1 (allowed). So, this is valid.Wait, so actually, out of the 6 permutations:Invalid ones are 1, 3, 4. The rest (2,5,6) are valid. So, three valid permutations, which matches our previous calculation of 3 for this combination.Similarly, for the combination 1,3,4, the valid permutations would be similar.Therefore, each combination in Case 4 gives 3 valid permutations, so 2 combinations give 6 total. Then Cases 2 and 3 each give 4, totaling 14. That seems correct.Therefore, I think the answer is 14.Final AnswerThe total number of ways is boxed{14}.&lt;/think&gt;We need to find the number of ways to place three selected balls from four (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4) into three boxes (numbered 1, 2, 3) such that ball 1 is not in box 1 and ball 3 is not in box 3. First, we calculate the total number of permutations of selecting 3 balls out of 4, which is ( P(4, 3) = 24 ).Next, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to subtract the invalid permutations where ball 1 is in box 1 or ball 3 is in box 3.1. Invalid permutations where ball 1 is in box 1 (set ( A )):   - Fix ball 1 in box 1, then choose 2 balls from the remaining 3 and arrange them in the remaining 2 boxes.   - Number of ways: ( binom{3}{2} times 2! = 3 times 2 = 6 ).2. Invalid permutations where ball 3 is in box 3 (set ( B )):   - Fix ball 3 in box 3, then choose 2 balls from the remaining 3 and arrange them in the remaining 2 boxes.   - Number of ways: ( binom{3}{2} times 2! = 3 times 2 = 6 ).3. Invalid permutations where both ball 1 is in box 1 and ball 3 is in box 3 (intersection ( A cap B )):   - Fix both ball 1 and ball 3, then choose 1 ball from the remaining 2 and place it in the remaining box.   - Number of ways: ( binom{2}{1} times 1! = 2 times 1 = 2 ).Using inclusion-exclusion principle:[|A cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A cap B| = 6 + 6 - 2 = 10]Subtracting the invalid permutations from the total permutations:[24 - 10 = 14]Thus, the total number of valid ways is (boxed{14}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>The total number of ways to place the balls under the given conditions is boxed{14}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-79b7f219><span data-v-79b7f219>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
