The circle is tangent to AB at point P and to CD at point Q. They give us the lengths: AP is 19, PB is 26, CQ is 37, and QD is 23. We need to find the square of the radius of the circle. Hmm, let&#39;s think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if a circle is inscribed in a quadrilateral, then the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral. One key property of tangential quadrilaterals is that the sums of the lengths of the opposite sides are equal. So that would mean AB + CD = BC + DA. Let me check that... Yeah, that seems right. So maybe I can use that here?Let me write down the given lengths. AP is 19, PB is 26, so AB is AP + PB = 19 + 26 = 45. Similarly, CQ is 37 and QD is 23, so CD is CQ + QD = 37 + 23 = 60. So AB is 45, CD is 60. Therefore, according to the tangential quadrilateral property, AB + CD should equal BC + DA. So 45 + 60 = 105, so BC + DA must also equal 105. But I don&#39;t know BC or DA yet. Maybe I can express them in terms of other variables?Since the circle is tangent to all four sides, there&#39;s another property where the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency can be related. Let me recall that. If a circle is tangent to all four sides of a quadrilateral, then the lengths from each vertex to the points of tangency are equal. For example, if the circle is tangent to AB at P, BC at some point R, CD at Q, and DA at another point S, then the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency should satisfy certain equalities.Specifically, if I denote the tangent lengths from each vertex as follows: from A, the tangents to the circle are AP and AS. Since both are tangent from the same point, they should be equal. Similarly, from B, the tangents BP and BR should be equal. From C, the tangents CR and CQ should be equal, and from D, the tangents DS and DQ should be equal. Wait, but in the problem, they only mention points P and Q. Maybe I need to define the other points?Let me try to define the points of tangency. Let&#39;s say the circle is tangent to AB at P, BC at R, CD at Q, and DA at S. Then, as per the properties, the lengths should satisfy:AP = AS = 19,PB = BR = 26,CR = CQ = 37,QD = DS = 23.Is that correct? Let&#39;s see. If AP is 19, then AS should also be 19 because they&#39;re both tangents from A. Similarly, PB is 26, so BR is 26. Then CR would be 37, which is CQ, and QD is 23, so DS is 23. Then, the sides can be expressed in terms of these tangent lengths.So side BC is BR + CR = 26 + 37 = 63.Side DA is DS + AS = 23 + 19 = 42.So BC is 63, DA is 42. Then BC + DA = 63 + 42 = 105, which matches AB + CD = 45 + 60 = 105. That checks out. So that&#39;s consistent with the tangential quadrilateral property.Now, to find the radius of the inscribed circle. Hmm, for a tangential quadrilateral, the area can be expressed as the product of the radius and the semiperimeter. Wait, no, actually, for a circle inscribed in a polygon, the area is equal to the semiperimeter multiplied by the radius. Wait, let&#39;s recall the formula. For a triangle, area is r*(semiperimeter). For a tangential quadrilateral, the area is indeed r * semiperimeter? Wait, no, maybe the formula is different.Wait, let me check. For a tangential quadrilateral, the area is equal to the product of the inradius and the semiperimeter. Wait, is that right? Hmm. Let me think. For a tangential quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, the area K is equal to r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. Wait, semiperimeter is (a + b + c + d)/2, so K = r * s. So if we can find the area, then we can solve for r as K / s.But how do we find the area of this quadrilateral? We know the sides, maybe. Wait, we can compute the sides:AB = 45,BC = 63,CD = 60,DA = 42.So the sides are 45, 63, 60, 42.Wait, but just knowing the sides of a quadrilateral doesn&#39;t determine its area uniquely unless it&#39;s cyclic. But here it&#39;s tangential. Hmm. Maybe there&#39;s a formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral with given sides. Wait, but for a tangential quadrilateral, if it&#39;s also cyclic, then it&#39;s called bicentric, but we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cyclic here.But in general, for a tangential quadrilateral, is there a way to find the area? Since it&#39;s tangential, the area is r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. So if we can find the area another way, maybe through other means.Alternatively, maybe we can split the quadrilateral into two triangles and find the area of each. But how?Alternatively, perhaps using the Pitot theorem, but that&#39;s just the fact that the sum of the two opposite sides are equal, which we already checked. So that&#39;s not helpful here.Alternatively, maybe using the formula for area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. But then we need to find the area.Wait, but if we can compute the area using another method, then we can equate it to r*s and solve for r. So perhaps the key is to find the area of quadrilateral ABCD.But how? Since we don&#39;t have angles or diagonals. Hmm.Wait, another thought. In tangential quadrilaterals, there&#39;s a formula called the formula for area in terms of the sides. Wait, but since it&#39;s tangential, the sides satisfy a + c = b + d, right? Wait, no, the sum of the two opposite sides are equal. Wait, AB + CD = BC + DA. So in our case, AB = 45, CD = 60, BC = 63, DA = 42. So 45 + 60 = 105, 63 + 42 = 105. So that holds.But how does that help with the area? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe we can use Heron&#39;s formula, but that&#39;s for triangles. For quadrilaterals, Bretschneider&#39;s formula is a generalization, which requires angles or diagonals, which we don&#39;t have.Wait, but for a tangential quadrilateral, there is a formula similar to Heron&#39;s formula. Let me recall. For a tangential quadrilateral, the area is given by K = sqrt(abcd), where a, b, c, d are the sides? Wait, no, that&#39;s for cyclic quadrilaterals. For cyclic quadrilaterals, the area is sqrt((s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)), but that&#39;s Brahmagupta&#39;s formula. For tangential quadrilaterals, I think the area is r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semiperimeter. So if we can find the area another way, then we can find r.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a relation between the sides and the inradius. Wait, but we need more information.Wait, another approach. Maybe the quadrilateral can be split into two triangles by a diagonal, and then the area can be expressed as the sum of the areas of these triangles. If we can find the lengths of the diagonals or the angles, maybe.Alternatively, since the circle is tangent to all sides, perhaps we can use coordinates. Let me try to model this quadrilateral with coordinates.Let me place the quadrilateral in a coordinate system. Let&#39;s suppose that the circle is centered at (h, k), and has radius r. Then, since the circle is tangent to AB at P and to CD at Q, we can perhaps model the sides AB and CD as tangent lines to the circle.But setting up coordinates might be complicated. Let me see if there&#39;s a better way.Wait, another thought. In a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius can be calculated if we know the area. So perhaps if we can compute the area using the tangent lengths. Wait, the tangent lengths are given for sides AB and CD. Maybe we can find the lengths of the other sides, which we already did. Wait, BC is 63, DA is 42. So all sides are known: 45, 63, 60, 42. So semiperimeter s = (45 + 63 + 60 + 42)/2 = (210)/2 = 105. Wait, so semiperimeter is 105. Therefore, if we can compute the area K, then r = K / 105.So how to compute K? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d. Wait, let me check. For a tangential quadrilateral, the area is K = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. But unless we have another formula for K in terms of the sides, which might not be straightforward.Wait, but if we can model the quadrilateral as two adjacent triangles, each with the inradius, but I don&#39;t know. Maybe not.Wait, but in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be expressed in terms of the product of the two diagonals and the sine of the angle between them, but again, that requires knowledge of the diagonals or angles.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is orthodiagonal? Not necessarily.Wait, maybe another approach. Since the quadrilateral is tangential, all sides are tangent to the circle, so the distance from the center of the circle to each side is equal to the radius. Therefore, if we can find the area of the quadrilateral as the sum of the areas of four triangles formed by the center and each side.But each of those triangles would have a height equal to the radius. For example, the area contributed by side AB would be (1/2)*AB*r, similarly for BC, CD, DA. Therefore, total area K = (1/2)*r*(AB + BC + CD + DA) = r * s, since s = (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2. So that&#39;s consistent with K = r*s. But this doesn&#39;t help unless we can compute K another way.Hmm. So perhaps the key is to find the area another way.Wait, let&#39;s think about the coordinates again. Suppose we place the circle at the origin for simplicity. Let&#39;s say the circle has center (0,0) and radius r. Then, the tangent points on AB and CD are given as P and Q. Let&#39;s see.But we need more information about the positions of the sides. Maybe this is getting too complicated.Wait, another idea. In a tangential quadrilateral, if we denote the tangent lengths as follows: from vertex A, the tangent lengths are AP and AS, both equal to x. From B, BP and BR equal to y. From C, CR and CQ equal to z. From D, DQ and DS equal to w. Then, the sides can be expressed as:AB = AP + PB = x + y,BC = BR + RC = y + z,CD = CQ + QD = z + w,DA = DS + SA = w + x.In our problem, AP = 19 = x, PB = 26 = y,CQ = 37 = z, QD = 23 = w.Therefore, sides are:AB = 19 + 26 = 45,BC = 26 + 37 = 63,CD = 37 + 23 = 60,DA = 23 + 19 = 42.Which matches the given data. So, in this notation, x = 19, y = 26, z = 37, w = 23.Now, perhaps the area can be expressed in terms of x, y, z, w. Let me see.Wait, there&#39;s a formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral in terms of the tangent lengths. Let me recall. If a quadrilateral is tangential with tangent lengths x, y, z, w (as defined above), then the area K is given by sqrt((x + y + z + w)(xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw)). Wait, is that correct? Hmm. I&#39;m not sure. Maybe not.Alternatively, maybe using another formula. Let me check.Wait, actually, for a tangential quadrilateral, the area is K = 2*sqrt(xyzw). Wait, no, that seems too simple. Let me verify with an example. Suppose x = y = z = w = 1, so sides would be 2, 2, 2, 2, a rhombus. Then area would be 2*sqrt(1*1*1*1) = 2, but the area of a rhombus with side 2 and inradius 1 is actually 2*2*1 = 4. So that formula can&#39;t be right. Hmm. So scratch that.Alternatively, maybe there is a formula involving the tangent lengths. Let me think.Wait, perhaps using the fact that the area can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by the center of the circle and each side. Each triangle has a base equal to the side length and height equal to the radius. So total area K = (1/2)*r*(AB + BC + CD + DA) = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. But this is the same as before. So we still need another way to compute K.Wait, maybe we can split the quadrilateral into two triangles by a diagonal and compute the area as the sum of the two triangles. But to do that, we need the lengths of the diagonal or some angles. Hmm.Alternatively, since we know all the sides, maybe use Bretschneider&#39;s formula? Which generalizes Heron&#39;s formula for quadrilaterals. The formula is K = sqrt((s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d) - abcd cos^2(theta)), where theta is the sum of two opposite angles. But since we don&#39;t know theta, this doesn&#39;t help unless the quadrilateral is cyclic, which would make theta = 180°, and cos(theta) = -1, but we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cyclic.But the problem doesn&#39;t state that the quadrilateral is cyclic, only that it&#39;s tangential. So we can&#39;t use Brahmagupta&#39;s formula here. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe in a tangential quadrilateral, if we know the sides, we can express the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, but since we don&#39;t know the inradius, we need another approach.Wait, perhaps we can model the quadrilateral as two adjacent right triangles? Wait, not sure.Alternatively, maybe use coordinate geometry. Let me try that.Let&#39;s place the circle at the origin (0,0) with radius r. Then, the sides AB and CD are tangent to the circle at points P and Q. Let&#39;s try to find the equations of these tangent lines.Given that the circle is tangent to AB at P and to CD at Q. Let&#39;s suppose that point P is on AB, which is tangent to the circle. The tangent line at point P (x1, y1) on the circle x² + y² = r² is xx1 + yy1 = r². Similarly for point Q.But we don&#39;t know the coordinates of P and Q. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe assign coordinates based on the given lengths.Wait, perhaps place point A at (0,0). Then, since AP = 19 and PB = 26, point B would be at (19 + 26, 0) = (45, 0). Wait, but that assumes that AB is horizontal. But the circle is tangent to AB at P, which is at AP = 19 from A. So point P would be at (19, 0). But if AB is horizontal, then the tangent at P is horizontal, which would mean the circle has a vertical tangent at P. Wait, the tangent line at P is AB, which is horizontal. Therefore, the radius at point P must be perpendicular to AB, so vertical. Therefore, the center of the circle lies along the vertical line passing through P, which is x = 19. Similarly, the tangent at Q on CD is also a horizontal line? Wait, not necessarily. Wait, CD is another side, which is tangent at Q.But we don&#39;t know the orientation of CD. Hmm. Maybe this is getting too complicated.Wait, perhaps if we consider that in a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius can be found using the formula r = K / s, where K is the area and s is the semiperimeter. So if we can find the area K, then r = K / s. So maybe we can compute the area using some other method.Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that the area can be expressed in terms of the product of the two diagonals and the sine of the angle between them divided by two. But again, we need the diagonals and the angle, which we don&#39;t have.Wait, maybe think about the triangles formed by the center of the circle and each side. Each of these triangles has a height equal to the radius. For example, the triangle formed by the center and side AB has area (1/2)*AB*r. Similarly for the other sides. So total area is (1/2)*r*(AB + BC + CD + DA) = r*s, since s is the semiperimeter. So again, K = r*s. So unless we can compute K another way, we can&#39;t find r.Wait, but maybe there is another formula for the area in terms of the tangent lengths. Let me check. If we have the tangent lengths x, y, z, w, then perhaps the area can be found using these.In our case, x = 19, y = 26, z = 37, w = 23.Wait, I found a resource that says for a tangential quadrilateral with tangent lengths p, q, r, s (from each vertex), the area is sqrt(pqr + pqs + prs + qrs). Wait, let&#39;s see. Let me check with a square. If all tangent lengths are equal, say p = q = r = s = a, then area would be sqrt(a^4 + a^4 + a^4 + a^4) = sqrt(4a^4) = 2a². But the area of a square with tangent lengths a would actually be (2a)² = 4a², so that formula doesn&#39;t hold. So that must be wrong.Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps in terms of the tangent lengths, the sides are x + y, y + z, z + w, w + x, as we have here. Then, the semiperimeter s = x + y + z + w.Wait, in our case, x = 19, y = 26, z = 37, w = 23. So s = 19 + 26 + 37 + 23 = 105, which matches the semiperimeter we calculated earlier.But the area K = r*s = r*105. So if we can find K in terms of x, y, z, w, then we can solve for r.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. In a tangential quadrilateral, if we let the tangent lengths be x, y, z, w as above, then the area can also be expressed using the formula K = sqrt((x + y + z + w)(xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw)). Wait, let me test this with the square example. If x = y = z = w = a, then K = sqrt(4a*(a³ + a³ + a³ + a³)) = sqrt(4a*(4a³)) = sqrt(16a^4) = 4a², which matches the area of the square (side 2a, area 4a²). So that seems correct.So, using this formula, K = sqrt(s*(xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw)), where s = x + y + z + w. Therefore, in our case, s = 105, and xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw = 19*26*37 + 19*26*23 + 19*37*23 + 26*37*23.Let me compute each term:First term: 19*26*37Calculate 19*26: 19*20=380, 19*6=114, total=380+114=494Then 494*37: Let&#39;s compute 494*30=14,820 and 494*7=3,458. So total=14,820 + 3,458=18,278Second term: 19*26*2319*26=494 as before494*23: 494*20=9,880 and 494*3=1,482. Total=9,880 + 1,482=11,362Third term: 19*37*23First compute 19*37=703Then 703*23: 700*23=16,100 and 3*23=69, total=16,100 + 69=16,169Fourth term: 26*37*23Compute 26*37: 20*37=740, 6*37=222, total=740+222=962Then 962*23: 900*23=20,700, 62*23=1,426. Total=20,700 + 1,426=22,126Now, add all four terms:18,278 + 11,362 = 29,64016,169 + 22,126 = 38,295Total sum: 29,640 + 38,295 = 67,935Therefore, K = sqrt(105 * 67,935)Compute 105 * 67,935:First, compute 100 * 67,935 = 6,793,500Then, 5 * 67,935 = 339,675Total = 6,793,500 + 339,675 = 7,133,175Therefore, K = sqrt(7,133,175)Compute sqrt(7,133,175). Let&#39;s see.First, note that 2670² = 7,128,900 (since 2670² = (2600 + 70)² = 2600² + 2*2600*70 + 70² = 6,760,000 + 364,000 + 4,900 = 7,128,900). Then 2670² = 7,128,900.Difference: 7,133,175 - 7,128,900 = 4,275.Now, let&#39;s compute 2670 + x squared:(2670 + x)² = 2670² + 2*2670*x + x² = 7,128,900 + 5,340x + x².Set this equal to 7,133,175:7,128,900 + 5,340x + x² = 7,133,175So 5,340x + x² = 4,275.Assuming x is small, approximate:5,340x ≈ 4,275 =&gt; x ≈ 4,275 / 5,340 ≈ 0.8.Check x = 0.8:5,340*(0.8) + (0.8)^2 = 4,272 + 0.64 = 4,272.64, which is very close to 4,275. So x ≈ 0.8 + (4,275 - 4,272.64)/5,340 ≈ 0.8 + 2.36/5,340 ≈ 0.8 + 0.00044 ≈ 0.80044. So sqrt(7,133,175) ≈ 2670.80044. But since we&#39;re dealing with an exact value, maybe 7,133,175 is a perfect square?Wait, let&#39;s check. 2670² = 7,128,900. 2671² = 2670² + 2*2670 + 1 = 7,128,900 + 5,340 + 1 = 7,134,241. That&#39;s higher than 7,133,175. So between 2670 and 2671. Therefore, the square root is not an integer. Hmm. So perhaps the area is irrational. But since the problem asks for the square of the radius, which may not require us to compute it exactly here.But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me confirm.The formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral in terms of tangent lengths is K = sqrt(s*(xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw))?Wait, according to my previous test with a square, that formula worked. Let me verify again with the square. If x = y = z = w = a, then:K = sqrt(4a*(a³ + a³ + a³ + a³)) = sqrt(4a*(4a³)) = sqrt(16a^4) = 4a², which is correct. So the formula seems valid.Therefore, in our case, K = sqrt(105 * 67,935) = sqrt(7,133,175). Let&#39;s compute this more accurately.But maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the calculation of the sum xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw.Wait, let me recalculate:First term: 19*26*3719*26: 20*26=520 - 1*26=26 ⇒ 520 -26=494494*37: 500*37=18,500 -6*37=222 ⇒ 18,500 - 222=18,278Second term: 19*26*2319*26=494494*23: 500*23=11,500 -6*23=138 ⇒ 11,500 -138=11,362Third term: 19*37*2319*37=703703*23: 700*23=16,100 + 3*23=69 ⇒ 16,100 +69=16,169Fourth term: 26*37*2326*37=962962*23: 900*23=20,700 +62*23=1,426 ⇒20,700 +1,426=22,126Total sum: 18,278 +11,362=29,640; 16,169 +22,126=38,295; total 29,640 +38,295=67,935. That&#39;s correct.So, 105*67,935=7,133,175. So sqrt(7,133,175). Hmm. Let&#39;s check prime factors.First, factor 7,133,175.Divide by 25: 7,133,175 ÷25=285,327285,327: sum of digits 2+8+5+3+2+7=27, divisible by 9. 285,327 ÷9=31,703.31,703: check divisibility by 7: 7*4,500=31,500. 31,703 -31,500=203. 203 ÷7=29. So 7*4,529=31,703. So 31,703=7*4,529.Now, 4,529: check if divisible by 7: 7*600=4,200. 4,529-4,200=329. 329 ÷7=47. So 4,529=7*647.So 4,529=7*647. Check if 647 is prime: 647 ÷2=323.5, ÷3=215.666, ÷5=129.4, ÷7≈92.428, ÷11≈58.818, ÷13≈49.769, ÷17≈38.058, ÷19≈34.05. Next prime is 23: 23*28=644, 23*28.13=647. So 647 is prime.Thus, 7,133,175=25*9*7*7*647=25*9*49*647.Therefore, sqrt(7,133,175)=sqrt(25*9*49*647)=5*3*7*sqrt(647)=105*sqrt(647).Thus, the area K=105*sqrt(647). Therefore, since K= r*s=105*r, then:105*r=105*sqrt(647)Thus, r= sqrt(647). Therefore, r²=647.Wait, that seems like the answer. Let me check again.Wait, if K= sqrt(s*(xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw))=sqrt(105*67,935)=sqrt(7,133,175)=105*sqrt(647). Therefore, since K=105*r, then 105*r=105*sqrt(647) implies r= sqrt(647), so r²=647. Therefore, the answer is 647.But let me verify if the formula K= sqrt(s*(xyzw summed appropriately)) is correct. Because in the case of the square, it worked. But let me check another example.Take a kite that&#39;s tangential. Suppose x=1, y=1, z=1, w=1. Then s=4, K= sqrt(4*(1+1+1+1))=sqrt(4*4)=sqrt(16)=4. Which is correct since the kite would be a rhombus with area 4, which matches 1*4 (r*s), so r=1. So the formula works here.Another test: Let’s take a degenerate quadrilateral where x=2, y=0, z=2, w=0. Then sides are 2+0=2, 0+2=2, 2+0=2, 0+2=2, so a rhombus with all sides 2, but since y and w are zero, it&#39;s a degenerate quadrilateral. The area should be zero. Using the formula, s=2+0+2+0=4, and the product terms: xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw =2*0*2 +2*0*0 +2*2*0 +0*2*0=0+0+0+0=0. So K=sqrt(4*0)=0. Correct. So the formula works here too.Thus, seems like the formula is valid. Therefore, in our problem, we have K=105*sqrt(647), and since K=r*s=105*r, then r= sqrt(647), so r²=647. Therefore, the answer is 647.But let me check once more to avoid calculation mistakes.Wait, we had s = 105, and xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw = 67,935. Then K = sqrt(105 * 67,935). Then 105 * 67,935 = 7,133,175. Then factoring 7,133,175 as 25 * 9 * 49 * 647. So sqrt(25*9*49*647)=5*3*7*sqrt(647)=105*sqrt(647). Therefore, K=105*sqrt(647). Hence, r= K/s= (105*sqrt(647))/105= sqrt(647). Therefore, r²=647. Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the square of the radius is 647.Final Answerboxed{647}&lt;/think&gt;Given a circle inscribed in quadrilateral (ABCD), tangent to (overline{AB}) at (P) and to (overline{CD}) at (Q). The lengths are (AP = 19), (PB = 26), (CQ = 37), and (QD = 23). We need to find the square of the radius of the circle.1. Identify the sides of the quadrilateral:   - (AB = AP + PB = 19 + 26 = 45)   - (CD = CQ + QD = 37 + 23 = 60)   - Using the property of tangential quadrilaterals (sum of opposite sides are equal), we find:     - (BC = BR + CR = 26 + 37 = 63)     - (DA = DS + AS = 23 + 19 = 42)2. Verify the semiperimeter (s):   - Semipermeter (s = frac{AB + BC + CD + DA}{2} = frac{45 + 63 + 60 + 42}{2} = 105)3. Calculate the tangent lengths:   - (x = 19), (y = 26), (z = 37), (w = 23)4. Compute the product terms:   - (xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw)   - Calculate each term:     - (19 times 26 times 37 = 18,278)     - (19 times 26 times 23 = 11,362)     - (19 times 37 times 23 = 16,169)     - (26 times 37 times 23 = 22,126)   - Sum of these terms: (18,278 + 11,362 + 16,169 + 22,126 = 67,935)5. Calculate the area (K):   - (K = sqrt{s times (xyz + xyw + xzw + yzw)} = sqrt{105 times 67,935} = sqrt{7,133,175})   - Factorize (7,133,175) to simplify the square root:     - (7,133,175 = 25 times 9 times 49 times 647)     - (sqrt{7,133,175} = 5 times 3 times 7 times sqrt{647} = 105sqrt{647})6. Find the radius (r):   - Area (K = r times s)   - (105sqrt{647} = r times 105)   - (r = sqrt{647})7. Square of the radius:   - (r^2 = (sqrt{647})^2 = 647)(boxed{647}),&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to find the square of the radius of a circle inscribed in quadrilateral ABCD. The circle is tangent to AB at P and to CD at Q. The given lengths are AP=19, PB=26, CQ=37, and QD=23. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if a circle is tangent to all four sides of a quadrilateral, the quadrilateral is called a tangential quadrilateral. For tangential quadrilaterals, there&#39;s a property that the sums of the lengths of the opposite sides are equal. So that would mean AB + CD = BC + DA. Let me check if I can use this here.Given AP = 19 and PB = 26, the length of AB is AP + PB = 19 + 26 = 45. Similarly, for CD, since CQ = 37 and QD = 23, CD = CQ + QD = 37 + 23 = 60. So AB = 45 and CD = 60. Therefore, according to the tangential quadrilateral property, AB + CD should equal BC + DA. So 45 + 60 = BC + DA, which means BC + DA = 105. Hmm, but how does that help me find the radius?Wait, another thing I remember is that the area of a tangential quadrilateral can be calculated as the product of the inradius and the semiperimeter. The formula is Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. But if I can find the area of ABCD another way, then I can solve for r. But how do I find the area?Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency can help determine the sides. Let me recall that in a tangential quadrilateral with an incircle, the lengths of the tangents from each vertex to the points of tangency are equal. So if I denote the points of tangency on BC as, say, R and on DA as S, then the tangent lengths from each vertex should satisfy certain equalities.Let me try to label all the tangent segments. Let&#39;s denote the points where the circle is tangent to BC as R and to DA as S. Then, the tangent lengths from each vertex would be:From A: the tangents are AP and AS. Since both are tangent from A to the circle, AP = AS. Similarly, from B: the tangents are BP and BR, so BP = BR. From C: the tangents are CR and CQ, so CR = CQ. From D: the tangents are DQ and DS, so DQ = DS.Given that AP = 19, so AS = 19. PB = 26, so BR = 26. CQ = 37, so CR = 37. QD = 23, so DS = 23.Now, let&#39;s denote the sides:AB = AP + PB = 19 + 26 = 45 (as before)BC = BR + CR = 26 + 37 = 63CD = CQ + QD = 37 + 23 = 60DA = DS + AS = 23 + 19 = 42Wait, so the sides are AB = 45, BC = 63, CD = 60, and DA = 42. Let me check if AB + CD = BC + DA. 45 + 60 = 105, and BC + DA = 63 + 42 = 105. Yep, that works out. So that confirms it&#39;s a tangential quadrilateral.So the semiperimeter s is (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2 = (45 + 63 + 60 + 42)/2 = (210)/2 = 105. Wait, that&#39;s the same as the sum of BC + DA or AB + CD. Interesting.But how do I find the area? Because once I have the area, then Area = r * s =&gt; r = Area / s, so r^2 = (Area)^2 / s^2.But how to compute the area? For tangential quadrilaterals, the area is r * s, but that&#39;s the same formula. So maybe I need another approach. Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is cyclic as well? If it&#39;s both cyclic and tangential, it&#39;s called bicentric, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case here. The problem doesn&#39;t state that, so I can&#39;t assume that.Alternatively, maybe I can divide the quadrilateral into two triangles and find the area of each. But to do that, I need some angles or heights, which I don&#39;t have. Hmm.Wait, another thought: if the quadrilateral is tangential, then there&#39;s a formula for the area in terms of the sides. But I think that&#39;s also using the inradius. So maybe I need to use another property.Alternatively, since the circle is tangent to all sides, the radius is related to the distance from the center of the circle to each side, which is the radius. But how can I use that?Wait, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let me place the circle at the origin (0,0), and set up the quadrilateral such that the sides AB and CD are tangent to the circle. But this might get complicated. Let me think.Alternatively, since the circle is tangent to AB at P and CD at Q, and we know the lengths from A to P and from P to B, as well as from C to Q and Q to D. Maybe the distances from P and Q to the center of the circle are equal to the radius, and the lines AB and CD are tangent lines to the circle.Wait, if I can find the distance between the lines AB and CD, that would be twice the radius? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because the circle is inscribed inside the quadrilateral, which is not necessarily a trapezoid. So AB and CD might not be parallel.Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let me recall that for a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be calculated using the formula similar to Heron&#39;s formula: Area = sqrt( (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d) ) where a, b, c, d are the sides. Wait, but no, Heron&#39;s formula is for triangles, and for quadrilaterals, Brahmagupta&#39;s formula is used for cyclic quadrilaterals: Area = sqrt( (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d) ). But this is only for cyclic quadrilaterals. Since we don&#39;t know if ABCD is cyclic, we can&#39;t use that.So perhaps I need a different strategy. Let me recall that in a tangential quadrilateral, if you know all four sides, the inradius can be found by Area = r * s, but since we don&#39;t know the area, maybe we can express the area in terms of the radius.Alternatively, if the quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (diagonals are perpendicular), the area would be (d1 * d2)/2, but again, we don&#39;t know that.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a formula for the radius in terms of the tangent lengths. Let me think. If we denote the tangent lengths as in the problem, maybe we can use some relations.Wait, let me think. In a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius can be calculated as Area / s. But how to compute the area? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I can split the quadrilateral into two triangles by drawing a diagonal and then find the area of each triangle in terms of the radius. Let me try that.Suppose we draw diagonal AC, splitting ABCD into triangles ABC and ADC. The area of ABCD would be the sum of the areas of ABC and ADC. If I can express each area in terms of the radius, maybe that can help.For triangle ABC: The incircle of the quadrilateral is tangent to AB, BC, and AC? Wait, no. Wait, the incircle is tangent to all four sides of the quadrilateral, so it&#39;s tangent to AB, BC, CD, and DA. But the incircle of the quadrilateral is not necessarily the incircle of triangle ABC or ADC. So maybe this approach isn&#39;t straightforward.Wait, but maybe each triangle has an altitude related to the radius? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe consider that in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by the center of the circle and each side. Each of these triangles has a height equal to the radius. So the area would be (AB * r + BC * r + CD * r + DA * r)/2 = ( (AB + BC + CD + DA ) * r ) / 2 = (2s * r)/2 = s * r, which matches the formula Area = r * s. So that&#39;s consistent, but doesn&#39;t help me find the area unless I know r already.Hmm. So I need another way to compute the area. Maybe if I can find the lengths of the other two sides? Wait, but we already found BC = 63 and DA = 42. So all sides are known: AB = 45, BC = 63, CD = 60, DA = 42. So perhaps with all sides known, even if it&#39;s not cyclic, maybe there&#39;s a formula for the area? Wait, I thought that was only for cyclic quadrilaterals with Brahmagupta&#39;s formula. But maybe there&#39;s a general formula for the area of any quadrilateral given the sides and the fact that it&#39;s tangential.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. For a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be expressed in terms of the product of the diagonals and the sine of the angle between them, divided by 2. But again, without knowing the angle or the diagonals, that might not help.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius can be found using r = Area / s. So if I can find the area in another way, perhaps by using coordinates or some other geometric relations.Alternatively, maybe use the Pythagorean theorem if I can relate the radius to the sides through right triangles.Wait, let me try drawing the quadrilateral. Let&#39;s imagine quadrilateral ABCD with the incircle. The points of tangency divide each side into two segments. We know AP = 19, PB = 26, so AB is split into 19 and 26. Similarly, CD is split into 37 and 23. The other sides BC and DA are split into 26 (BR) and 37 (CR), and 23 (DS) and 19 (AS) respectively.Wait, so if I consider the center of the circle, O, then the radius is the distance from O to each side. Let me try to model this with coordinates.Let me place point P at the origin (0,0). Since the circle is tangent to AB at P, the radius OP is perpendicular to AB. Similarly, the circle is tangent to CD at Q, so the radius OQ is perpendicular to CD. If I can model the positions of O, P, Q, maybe I can find the radius.But this might be complicated. Let me see. Let me suppose that AB is horizontal for simplicity. Then, since the circle is tangent to AB at P, the center O lies vertically above P (if AB is horizontal) at a distance equal to the radius, r. So coordinates of O would be (0, r). Similarly, if CD is tangent at Q, and if I can figure out the slope of CD, then the center O would lie at a distance r from CD, along the perpendicular.But without knowing the angles or coordinates of other points, this might be too vague. Maybe another approach.Wait, here&#39;s a formula I found in my mind: For a tangential quadrilateral, the radius is given by r = (AB + CD - BC - DA)/4 * something... Wait, no, that doesn&#39;t seem right.Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the area is r*s, and also, the area can be found by splitting the quadrilateral into two triangles. But since we don&#39;t have the angles or diagonals, maybe that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, maybe think of the quadrilateral as a right kite or some special shape where the area can be calculated. But without more information, this is speculative.Wait, another idea: since the incircle is tangent to all four sides, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency determine the sides, which we already have. So we have all four sides: AB = 45, BC = 63, CD = 60, DA = 42. So maybe the quadrilateral is a trapezoid? If it&#39;s a trapezoid, then the height would be twice the radius. Wait, but in a trapezoid, two sides are parallel. But we don&#39;t know if AB is parallel to CD. The problem doesn&#39;t specify that.Wait, but maybe it is a trapezoid. Let me check. If AB and CD are both tangent to the circle, and the circle is between them, then if AB and CD are parallel, the distance between them would be 2r. But in that case, the other sides BC and DA would be the legs of the trapezoid. Wait, but in our case, BC = 63 and DA = 42, which are not equal, so it&#39;s not an isosceles trapezoid. But if AB and CD are parallel, then the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem with BC and DA as the legs, but that&#39;s not straightforward.Wait, actually, in a trapezoid with bases AB and CD, and legs BC and DA, the height h can be found if we know the lengths of the legs and the difference in the lengths of the bases. But since AB = 45 and CD = 60, the difference is 15. If it&#39;s a trapezoid, then the legs BC and DA would form right triangles with the height and the difference in the bases. But since BC = 63 and DA = 42, the height h can be calculated as follows:Assuming AB is the top base and CD is the bottom base, longer by 15 units. Then the legs BC and DA would each form a right triangle with height h and horizontal component (60 - 45)/2 = 7.5. But 63^2 = h^2 + 7.5^2 and 42^2 = h^2 + 7.5^2. But 63^2 is 3969 and 42^2 is 1764, which can&#39;t both equal h^2 + 56.25. That&#39;s impossible. Therefore, the quadrilateral is not a trapezoid. So that approach is invalid.Hmm, so maybe the quadrilateral isn&#39;t a trapezoid. Then how else can I find the area?Wait, maybe use the formula for the area of a quadrilateral with given sides and an incircle. Wait, I recall that for a tangential quadrilateral, the area is sqrt( (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d) ). Wait, no, that&#39;s Brahmagupta&#39;s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. But if a quadrilateral is both cyclic and tangential, it&#39;s called bicentric. But we don&#39;t know if this quadrilateral is cyclic.Wait, but maybe in this case, with the given tangent lengths, the quadrilateral is bicentric? Let me check. For a bicentric quadrilateral, there&#39;s a relationship between the inradius, circumradius, and the distances between the centers. But this seems too complicated.Alternatively, maybe the given problem has a unique solution because the tangent lengths determine the sides, which in turn determine the inradius. So maybe there&#39;s a formula for the inradius in terms of the sides of a tangential quadrilateral.Wait, let me think. For a tangential quadrilateral, the area is r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. So if I can compute the area in another way, then I can solve for r. But how?Alternatively, perhaps use Heron&#39;s formula on the two triangles formed by a diagonal. Let&#39;s suppose we split the quadrilateral into two triangles by a diagonal AC. Then, the area of ABCD would be the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and ADC. To compute these areas, we need the lengths of the diagonals AC and maybe some angles. But since we don&#39;t have those, perhaps express the area in terms of the radius.Alternatively, notice that each triangle&#39;s area can be expressed as r times the semiperimeter of the quadrilateral. Wait, no. Wait, the entire quadrilateral&#39;s area is r * s. But each triangle&#39;s area would be related to the inradius of the triangle, which is different from the inradius of the quadrilateral.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a relation between the sides and the radius. Let me think. If I can model the quadrilateral as two adjacent right triangles with legs related to the radius. Wait, perhaps.Wait, in a tangential quadrilateral, each side is tangent to the circle, so the distance from the center of the circle to each side is equal to the radius. If I can find the angles of the quadrilateral, then the area can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by the center and each side. Each of these triangles has a base as the side of the quadrilateral and height r. So the area of each triangle is (side * r)/2, and the total area is the sum of these four, which is ( (AB + BC + CD + DA ) * r ) / 2 = (2s * r)/2 = s * r, which matches the formula. But again, this doesn&#39;t help unless I have another way to compute the area.Wait, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let&#39;s attempt to assign coordinates to the quadrilateral. Let me place point P at (0,0). Since the circle is tangent to AB at P, the radius is perpendicular to AB at P. Let&#39;s assume AB is horizontal for simplicity, so the radius at P is vertical. Therefore, the center of the circle O has coordinates (0, r).Now, the circle is also tangent to BC, CD, and DA. Let me try to find the coordinates of the other points.Given that AP = 19, so point A is 19 units to the left of P. Since AB is from A to B, and AP = 19, PB = 26, then AB is 45 units long. If P is at (0,0), and AB is horizontal, then point A is at (-19, 0) and point B is at (26, 0).Now, the circle is tangent to CD at Q. Let me denote Q as some point on CD. Given that CQ = 37 and QD = 23, CD is 60 units long. But I need to figure out the coordinates of Q. Wait, but CD is another side of the quadrilateral, which is tangent to the circle at Q. The center O is at (0, r), and the radius to Q must be perpendicular to CD at Q.This seems complex. Let me try to model CD. Let&#39;s suppose CD is some line tangent to the circle at Q. Let me denote the coordinates of Q as (x, y). Then, the line CD is tangent to the circle centered at (0, r) with radius r, so the distance from O to CD is r. The equation of line CD can be written as ... Hmm, but without knowing the slope, this is challenging.Alternatively, since Q is a point of tangency on CD, the line CD is perpendicular to the radius OQ. So the line CD has slope - (x - 0)/(y - r), because the slope of OQ is (y - r)/x, so the perpendicular slope is -x/(y - r). But this seems too abstract.Wait, maybe I can parametrize point Q. Since the circle is tangent to CD at Q, and the center is at (0, r), then Q lies on the circle, so the coordinates of Q satisfy (x)^2 + (y - r)^2 = r^2. Therefore, x^2 + (y - r)^2 = r^2 =&gt; x^2 + y^2 - 2ry + r^2 = r^2 =&gt; x^2 + y^2 - 2ry = 0 =&gt; x^2 + y^2 = 2ry.Also, the line CD is tangent at Q, so its equation is x*Q_x + (y - r)*Q_y = r^2. Wait, the equation of the tangent line at point (x1, y1) on the circle x^2 + (y - r)^2 = r^2 is x*x1 + (y - r)*(y1 - r) = r^2. Wait, let me check.The general equation for a tangent line to a circle (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 at point (x1, y1) is (x1 - a)(x - a) + (y1 - b)(y - b) = r^2. So in our case, the circle is x^2 + (y - r)^2 = r^2, so a = 0, b = r. Therefore, the tangent line at (x1, y1) is x1*x + (y1 - r)(y - r) = r^2.Simplify this: x1 x + (y1 - r)(y - r) = r^2.But (y1 - r)(y - r) = (y1 - r)y - (y1 - r)r.So the equation becomes x1 x + (y1 - r)y - (y1 - r)r = r^2.But since (x1, y1) is on the circle, x1^2 + (y1 - r)^2 = r^2 =&gt; x1^2 = r^2 - (y1 - r)^2.But this might not help. Let me see. The tangent line at Q (x1, y1) is x1 x + (y1 - r)(y - r) = r^2. Let me rearrange this equation:x1 x + (y1 - r)y - (y1 - r)r = r^2=&gt; x1 x + (y1 - r)y = r^2 + (y1 - r)r=&gt; x1 x + (y1 - r)y = r^2 + r(y1 - r)=&gt; x1 x + (y1 - r)y = r y1So that&#39;s the equation of the tangent line at Q.But we also know that points C and D lie on this line, and CQ = 37, QD = 23. So if we can find coordinates for C and D such that they lie on this tangent line and are 37 and 23 units away from Q, respectively.But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.Wait, let&#39;s think about the quadrilateral. Since we have coordinates for A, B, and the center O, maybe we can find coordinates for C and D.Point A is at (-19, 0), point B is at (26, 0), center O is at (0, r). The circle is also tangent to DA and BC. Let&#39;s find the equations for sides DA and BC.Side DA goes from D to A (-19, 0). The circle is tangent to DA at S, which is 23 units from D and 19 units from A, as established earlier (DS = 23, AS = 19). Therefore, the length of DA is 23 + 19 = 42. Similarly, side BC goes from B (26,0) to C, and is tangent to the circle at R, with BR = 26 and CR = 37, so BC is 63.So, let me try to find coordinates for points D and C.Starting with side DA: it goes from D to A (-19,0), is tangent to the circle at S. Let me denote S as the point of tangency on DA. The line DA is tangent to the circle at S, so the radius OS is perpendicular to DA. Similarly, side BC is tangent at R, so OR is perpendicular to BC.If I can find the coordinates of S and R, then I can find equations for DA and BC, and thus find points D and C.Let me attempt this.First, consider side DA. Let me parametrize DA. Since DA is from D to A (-19,0), and the length is 42. Let me denote D as (d_x, d_y). The point S is 23 units from D and 19 units from A. So, the coordinates of S can be found by moving 23 units from D towards A.Therefore, the coordinates of S are:S_x = d_x + (23/42)*( -19 - d_x )S_y = d_y + (23/42)*( 0 - d_y )Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, since the vector from D to A is (-19 - d_x, -d_y). The point S divides DA in the ratio DS:SA = 23:19. Therefore, using the section formula, the coordinates of S are:S_x = (19*d_x + 23*(-19)) / (23 + 19) = (19d_x - 437)/42S_y = (19*d_y + 23*0)/42 = (19d_y)/42But S is the point of tangency on DA, so the line DA is tangent to the circle at S. Therefore, the vector OS is perpendicular to DA.Vector DA is from D to A: (-19 - d_x, -d_y)Vector OS is (S_x, S_y - r) since O is at (0, r)Wait, O is at (0, r). So vector OS is (S_x - 0, S_y - r) = (S_x, S_y - r)This vector must be perpendicular to DA, whose direction vector is (-19 - d_x, -d_y)Therefore, the dot product is zero:S_x*(-19 - d_x) + (S_y - r)*(-d_y) = 0Substituting S_x and S_y from above:[(19d_x - 437)/42] * (-19 - d_x) + [(19d_y)/42 - r] * (-d_y) = 0This seems very complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way.Alternatively, since S lies on DA and OS is perpendicular to DA, we can write equations for DA and the line OS.The line DA has a slope m_DA = (0 - d_y)/( -19 - d_x ) = -d_y / (-19 - d_x ) = d_y / (19 + d_x )The line OS has a slope m_OS = (S_y - r)/S_xSince they are perpendicular, m_DA * m_OS = -1So [d_y / (19 + d_x )] * [ (S_y - r)/S_x ] = -1But S is a point on DA, so S can also be expressed in terms of D and A. Since AS = 19 and DS = 23, the coordinates of S are:S_x = A_x + (19/42)*(D_x - A_x ) = -19 + (19/42)*(d_x + 19 )Similarly, S_y = A_y + (19/42)*(D_y - A_y ) = 0 + (19/42)*(d_y - 0 ) = (19/42)d_ySo S_x = -19 + (19/42)(d_x + 19 )Simplify:S_x = -19 + (19d_x + 361)/42 = (-19*42 + 19d_x + 361)/42 = (-798 + 19d_x + 361)/42 = (19d_x - 437)/42Which matches the earlier expression for S_x.Similarly, S_y = (19d_y)/42So substituting into the slope condition:[d_y / (19 + d_x )] * [ ( (19d_y)/42 - r ) / ( (19d_x - 437)/42 ) ] = -1Simplify the fractions:[ d_y / (19 + d_x ) ] * [ (19d_y - 42r)/42 ) / ( (19d_x - 437)/42 ) ) ] = -1The denominators of 42 cancel out:[ d_y / (19 + d_x ) ] * [ (19d_y - 42r) / (19d_x - 437) ) ] = -1Multiply numerator and denominator:d_y*(19d_y - 42r) / [ (19 + d_x )(19d_x - 437) ) ] = -1This is getting very complicated. Maybe this approach is not feasible without more information.Wait, maybe instead of coordinates, use the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius is given by r = Area / s. If I can compute the area using another formula.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. For a convex quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, and with an incircle, the area can also be computed using the formula:Area = sqrt(abcd)But only if the quadrilateral is a kite. But in our case, the sides are 45, 63, 60, 42, which are not two pairs of equal lengths, so it&#39;s not a kite. So that formula doesn&#39;t apply.Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for the area in terms of the tangent lengths. Let me check.In a tangential quadrilateral, the tangent lengths from the vertices are equal. Let me denote the tangent lengths as follows:Let’s define w, x, y, z as the tangent lengths from vertices A, B, C, D respectively.So from A: w = AP = AS = 19From B: x = BP = BR = 26From C: y = CR = CQ = 37From D: z = DQ = DS = 23Then, the sides are AB = w + x = 19 + 26 = 45BC = x + y = 26 + 37 = 63CD = y + z = 37 + 23 = 60DA = z + w = 23 + 19 = 42Which matches the given sides.In this notation, the semiperimeter s = (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2 = (45 + 63 + 60 + 42)/2 = 210 / 2 = 105.Now, in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be expressed as:Area = r * s = r * 105But if I can find another expression for the area in terms of the tangent lengths w, x, y, z.Wait, here&#39;s a formula I found in some references: The area of a tangential quadrilateral can also be calculated by Area = sqrt(wxyz(w + x + y + z)) ). Wait, let me check.Wait, no, that formula doesn&#39;t seem familiar. Let me think again.Alternatively, consider that the area is the sum of the areas of four right triangles formed by the radii and the tangent segments. Wait, but the sides are not necessarily perpendicular to each other.Alternatively, since we have the tangent lengths, maybe we can model the quadrilateral as two pairs of adjacent tangent lengths forming right angles with the radius. Hmm.Wait, actually, each tangent segment is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. So for example, the radius OP is perpendicular to AB at P, and the radius OQ is perpendicular to CD at Q.If I can find the distance between the points P and Q along the circle, but that might not help.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. If I consider the two tangent lengths from each vertex, like from A: 19 and 19, from B: 26 and 26, etc. Then, the quadrilateral can be thought of as formed by moving along the directions perpendicular to the radius.But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, another approach: Since we know all four sides and it&#39;s a tangential quadrilateral, maybe use the formula for the radius in terms of the sides and the tangent lengths.Wait, actually, here&#39;s a formula for the inradius of a tangential quadrilateral:r = (AB + CD - BC - DA)/4 * tan(theta/2), where theta is the angle between the two diagonals. But this seems too vague.Alternatively, perhaps use the formula that in a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius is given by r = (Area)/s, and the Area can be expressed using the formula involving the tangent lengths.Wait, I found a resource that says for a tangential quadrilateral with tangent lengths w, x, y, z, the inradius is given by r = sqrt( (wxyz)/(w + x + y + z) ). Let me check if this formula is correct.Wait, let&#39;s test it with a square. In a square, all tangent lengths are equal. Suppose the side is 2a, so each tangent length from a vertex is a. Then w = x = y = z = a. Then, according to the formula, r = sqrt( (a^4)/(4a) ) = sqrt( a^3 / 4 ). But the inradius of a square is a, since the radius is half the side. Wait, this gives r = sqrt(a^3 / 4 ), which is not equal to a. So the formula is incorrect. So maybe that formula is not valid.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a different formula.Wait, let me think. For a bicentric quadrilateral, there is a relation between inradius and circumradius, but again, we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s bicentric.Alternatively, recall that in a tangential quadrilateral, the area is r*s, and if we can express the area in terms of the sides using another formula, maybe we can equate and solve for r.But the problem is that without additional information like angles or diagonals, it&#39;s difficult to compute the area.Wait, but in this problem, maybe there is a specific configuration where the quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (diagonals are perpendicular). If that&#39;s the case, the area would be (d1 * d2)/2. If we can show that the diagonals are perpendicular, then we can find the area.But how to determine if the diagonals are perpendicular? Given the sides, maybe use the Pythagorean theorem.Wait, the sides are 45, 63, 60, 42. Let&#39;s see:45^2 + 60^2 = 2025 + 3600 = 562563^2 + 42^2 = 3969 + 1764 = 5733Not equal, so the sum of squares of two opposite sides is not equal, so the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular.Alternatively, maybe the sum of squares of all sides:45^2 + 63^2 + 60^2 + 42^2 = 2025 + 3969 + 3600 + 1764 = 11358But not sure how that helps.Wait, here&#39;s a thought. Since the quadrilateral has an incircle, maybe we can use the formula that relates the inradius to the sides and the angles. For each side, the area can be represented as r times the semiperimeter, but again, this leads us back to the same problem.Wait, another idea: Maybe the quadrilateral is a right tangential quadrilateral, meaning that two of its angles are right angles. If that&#39;s the case, then we can model it as such. But given the sides, 45, 63, 60, 42, it&#39;s not clear which angles would be right angles.Alternatively, maybe split the quadrilateral into two right triangles and a rectangle. But this is speculative.Wait, going back to the coordinate system idea. Let&#39;s try to set up coordinates for points A, B, C, D.Let me place point A at (-19, 0), since AP = 19, and if AB is along the x-axis, then point P is at (0,0), and point B is at (26,0). The center of the circle is at (0, r), since it&#39;s along the y-axis (perpendicular to AB at P).Now, the circle is also tangent to CD at Q. Let&#39;s find coordinates for Q. Since Q is a point on CD, and the circle is tangent at Q, the center O is at (0, r), so OQ is perpendicular to CD.Let me denote Q as (h, k). Then, since Q is on the circle centered at (0, r) with radius r, we have:h^2 + (k - r)^2 = r^2 =&gt; h^2 + k^2 - 2kr + r^2 = r^2 =&gt; h^2 + k^2 - 2kr = 0 =&gt; h^2 + k^2 = 2kr =&gt; h^2 = 2kr - k^2.Also, the line CD is tangent at Q, so its equation is h x + (k - r)(y - r) = r^2. Wait, earlier we derived that the tangent line at Q (h, k) is h x + (k - r)(y - r) = r^2. Expanding this:h x + (k - r)y - (k - r)r = r^2=&gt; h x + (k - r)y = r^2 + (k - r)r=&gt; h x + (k - r)y = r kSo the equation of CD is h x + (k - r)y = r k.Now, points C and D lie on this line, and we know that CQ = 37 and QD = 23. So the distance from Q to C is 37 and from Q to D is 23 along the line CD.Since CD is a straight line, we can parametrize points C and D as follows:Parametrize CD such that Q is between C and D, with CQ = 37 and QD = 23. So the total length CD = 60. Let’s set up a parameter t such that when t=0, we are at Q, t=1 corresponds to moving 37 units towards C, and t=-1 corresponds to moving 23 units towards D. Wait, actually, it&#39;s better to use a unit vector in the direction of CD.Let’s find the direction vector,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the square of the radius of a circle inscribed in quadrilateral ABCD. The circle is tangent to AB at P and to CD at Q. The given lengths are AP=19, PB=26, CQ=37, and QD=23. Hmm, let me recall what I know about tangent segments and inscribed circles in quadrilaterals.First, I remember that in a tangential quadrilateral (a quadrilateral that has an inscribed circle), the sums of the lengths of the opposite sides are equal. So, that would mean AB + CD = BC + DA. Is that right? Let me verify. If a circle is tangent to all four sides of a quadrilateral, then the sums of the two pairs of opposite sides are equal. Yes, that&#39;s the Pitot theorem, I think. So, AB + CD = BC + DA. That should help.But let&#39;s see if I can apply that here. Let me compute AB and CD first. AB is AP + PB, which is 19 + 26 = 45. CD is CQ + QD, which is 37 + 23 = 60. So AB + CD = 45 + 60 = 105. Therefore, BC + DA must also be 105. But I don&#39;t know BC or DA. Hmm, so maybe I need more information.Wait, but in a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths of the tangent segments from each vertex to the points of tangency are equal. For example, if the circle is tangent to AB at P, BC at some point, say R, CD at Q, and DA at another point, say S, then the lengths from each vertex to the two points of tangency should be equal. So, for vertex B, the two tangent segments would be BP and BR, which should be equal. Similarly, for vertex C, the tangent segments would be CR and CQ, which should be equal. For vertex D, the segments would be DQ and DS, and for vertex A, the segments would be AS and AP. Wait, but how does this help?Let me try to denote the tangent segments. Let&#39;s suppose the circle is tangent to BC at R and to DA at S. Then, from point B, the tangents to the circle are BP and BR. Since tangents from a single point to a circle are equal in length, BP = BR. Similarly, from point C, the tangents are CR and CQ, so CR = CQ. From point D, the tangents are DQ and DS, so DQ = DS. From point A, the tangents are AP and AS, so AP = AS.So, given that AP = 19, then AS = 19. Similarly, PB = 26, so BR = 26. CQ = 37, so CR = 37. QD = 23, so DS = 23. Now, let&#39;s see if we can express the sides BC and DA in terms of these tangent segments.BC is made up of BR + CR. Since BR = 26 and CR = 37, then BC = 26 + 37 = 63. Similarly, DA is made up of DS + AS. Since DS = 23 and AS = 19, then DA = 23 + 19 = 42. So BC + DA = 63 + 42 = 105, which matches AB + CD = 45 + 60 = 105. That checks out with the Pitot theorem, so that&#39;s good.Now, the problem is to find the square of the radius of the inscribed circle. Hmm, how do you find the radius of an inscribed circle in a quadrilateral? I remember that for a tangential quadrilateral, the area can be expressed as the product of the semiperimeter and the radius: Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. Wait, is that right? Wait, no, in a triangle, the area is r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. For a quadrilateral, maybe it&#39;s similar? Let me check.Actually, yes, for a tangential quadrilateral, the area is equal to the product of the radius and the semiperimeter. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, hold on. Let me recall. For a tangential quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, the area is given by K = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. So the semiperimeter is (a + b + c + d)/2, so s = (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2. Then, if I can find the area of the quadrilateral, I can divide it by s to get r, then square it.But how do I find the area? Hmm. Since I don&#39;t have any angles or other information, maybe I need another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the radius can be related to the tangent segments or the sides. Wait, but I need more information. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral can be split into triangles, and the area can be found as the sum of the areas of the triangles. But to do that, I would need the heights or some angles. Alternatively, since there is an inscribed circle, maybe all the triangles formed by the center of the circle and the sides have areas that can be expressed in terms of the radius and the sides.Wait, if I consider the center of the circle, O, then the circle is tangent to all four sides, so the radius is perpendicular to each side at the point of tangency. Therefore, if I connect the center O to all four vertices A, B, C, D, the quadrilateral is divided into four triangles: OAB, OBC, OCD, and ODA. The area of the quadrilateral would then be the sum of the areas of these four triangles.Each of these triangles has a height equal to the radius r, since the radius is perpendicular to the sides. Therefore, the area of each triangle is (1/2)*side*radius. Therefore, the total area K would be (1/2)*AB*r + (1/2)*BC*r + (1/2)*CD*r + (1/2)*DA*r = (1/2)*r*(AB + BC + CD + DA) = (1/2)*r*2s = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. So yes, K = r*s. Therefore, if I can find the area K of the quadrilateral, then r = K / s. Then, r² = (K / s)². Therefore, I need to compute K and s.But how to compute K? The problem is that we don&#39;t know the angles or the lengths of the other sides. Wait, but we do know all the sides now. Wait, AB is 45, BC is 63, CD is 60, DA is 42. Let me confirm:AB = AP + PB = 19 + 26 = 45BC = BR + CR = 26 + 37 = 63CD = CQ + QD = 37 + 23 = 60DA = DS + AS = 23 + 19 = 42So, the sides are AB=45, BC=63, CD=60, DA=42. Therefore, the perimeter is 45 + 63 + 60 + 42 = let&#39;s compute that:45 + 63 = 10860 + 42 = 102108 + 102 = 210Therefore, semiperimeter s = 210 / 2 = 105. So s = 105. Therefore, if we can find the area K, then r = K / 105, and then r² = (K / 105)². So the key is to compute the area K of the quadrilateral.But how? For a general quadrilateral, the area can be computed using Bretschneider&#39;s formula if we know the sides and two opposite angles, but we don&#39;t have angles here. Alternatively, if the quadrilateral is cyclic, we could use Brahmagupta&#39;s formula, but this quadrilateral is tangential, not necessarily cyclic. However, maybe there&#39;s a formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral.Wait, yes, for a tangential quadrilateral, there is a formula similar to Brahmagupta&#39;s formula, but it&#39;s different. Let me recall. For a bicentric quadrilateral (both cyclic and tangential), there&#39;s a relation between the radii, but this is just tangential. Alternatively, the area can be expressed as K = r * s, which we already have. But we need another way to compute K.Alternatively, if we can split the quadrilateral into two triangles and compute their areas. For example, split the quadrilateral along a diagonal, say AC, and compute the areas of triangles ABC and ADC. Then sum them up. To compute these areas, we can use Heron&#39;s formula if we know the lengths of all sides. But do we know AC? No, we don&#39;t. So maybe that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can be found by another formula. Wait, let me check. In some references, the area of a tangential quadrilateral is given by K = √( (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d) ), but I think that&#39;s actually Brahmagupta&#39;s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. Wait, no, Brahmagupta&#39;s formula is for cyclic quadrilaterals. For tangential quadrilaterals, perhaps the area is K = r * s, which we already know. But that doesn&#39;t help unless we can find K another way.Wait, perhaps using the lengths of the tangent segments. Let me think. Since we know the tangent segments, maybe we can find the area in terms of those. For example, in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be calculated as the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by the center of the incircle and the sides, each of which has a height of r. As we discussed earlier, so that K = (1/2)*r*(AB + BC + CD + DA) = r*s. So if we can express the area in another way, maybe using the tangent lengths.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the quadrilateral as two adjacent right triangles? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, use coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to the quadrilateral and compute the area that way. Let&#39;s try that.Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let&#39;s suppose that the center of the circle is at (0, 0). Since the circle is tangent to AB at P and to CD at Q. Wait, but AB and CD are opposite sides. Let me think. Let me try to model the quadrilateral.But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, is there a formula for the radius of an incircle in a tangential quadrilateral in terms of the tangent lengths? Let me see.Given that in a tangential quadrilateral, if we denote the tangent lengths from each vertex as follows: from A: x, from B: y, from C: z, from D: w. Then, the sides can be expressed as:AB = x + yBC = y + zCD = z + wDA = w + xAnd since the quadrilateral is tangential, we have x + z = y + w.Wait, but in our problem, we already determined the sides. Wait, the tangent lengths from each vertex: from A, the tangent segments are AP and AS. AP is given as 19, and AS is also 19. Similarly, from B, the tangent segments are BP = 26 and BR = 26. From C, CR = 37 and CQ = 37. From D, DQ = 23 and DS = 23. So, the sides are AB = AP + BP = 19 + 26 = 45, BC = BR + CR = 26 + 37 = 63, CD = CQ + DQ = 37 + 23 = 60, DA = DS + AS = 23 + 19 = 42. Then, the semiperimeter s = (45 + 63 + 60 + 42)/2 = 210/2 = 105.Now, in terms of the tangent lengths, we have x = 19 (from A), y = 26 (from B), z = 37 (from C), w = 23 (from D). Then, the formula for the radius of the incircle is given by:r = √( (x y z + y z w + z w x + w x y) / (x + y + z + w) )Wait, is that a real formula? I don&#39;t recall. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe not. Maybe there&#39;s another way.Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of the tangent lengths. Wait, but since the area is r*s, and s is 105, then if we can find the area K in terms of the tangent lengths, we can divide by s to get r.Alternatively, think of the quadrilateral as a kite? But it&#39;s not necessarily a kite. Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is orthodiagonal? Not sure.Alternatively, use the fact that the inradius can be expressed as r = (AB + CD - BC - DA)/4 + ... Hmm, no, that doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, maybe using the formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral in terms of its sides. Wait, but for a general tangential quadrilateral, there isn&#39;t a direct formula like Brahmagupta&#39;s. Wait, but if the quadrilateral is also cyclic (bicentric), then we can use both formulae. But we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cyclic.Alternatively, perhaps split the quadrilateral into two triangles by a diagonal, compute the area of each triangle using Heron&#39;s formula, sum them up, and set that equal to r*s to solve for r.But to use Heron&#39;s formula on the triangles, we need the lengths of the sides of the triangles, which includes the diagonals. However, we don&#39;t have the lengths of the diagonals. So that seems impossible unless we can find the diagonals somehow.Alternatively, maybe use the Pythagorean theorem in some way? Wait, but where is the right angle?Alternatively, think about the inradius in terms of the height of the triangles. Wait, but each side is tangent to the circle, so the distance from the center to each side is r. But how does that help?Wait, let&#39;s consider that in a tangential quadrilateral, all sides are tangent to the incircle. Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to each side is equal to the radius r. If I can model the quadrilateral in a coordinate system where the center is at (0,0), then each side is at a distance r from the center. But setting up such a coordinate system might be complicated, but maybe possible.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to use coordinate geometry. Let me attempt this.Let me place the center of the circle at the origin (0,0). Let&#39;s consider the tangent points on the sides. Let me start by assuming the circle has radius r. The tangent points on AB is P, and on CD is Q. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, C, D such that the sides are tangent to the circle.But this might be too vague. Let me try a different approach. Let&#39;s suppose that side AB is tangent to the circle at point P, which is 19 units from A and 26 units from B. Similarly, CD is tangent at Q, 37 units from C and 23 units from D.Let me consider that the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are known. So, from A to P is 19, from P to B is 26, from C to Q is 37, from Q to D is 23.Wait, in a tangential quadrilateral, the lengths of the tangent segments from each vertex are equal. For example, the tangent from A to the circle is AP = AS = 19, from B is BP = BR = 26, from C is CQ = CR = 37, and from D is DQ = DS = 23. So, as I had earlier, the sides are AB = 45, BC = 63, CD = 60, DA = 42.Now, if I can model the quadrilateral in a coordinate system, maybe with AB on the x-axis. Let me try that. Let&#39;s place point A at (0,0) and point B at (45,0), since AB is 45 units long. The circle is tangent to AB at point P, which is 19 units from A, so P is at (19,0). Similarly, the circle is tangent to CD at Q. But where is Q? If we can figure out the coordinates of Q, maybe we can reconstruct the quadrilateral.But CD is 60 units long, with CQ = 37 and QD = 23. However, we don&#39;t know the position of CD yet. Let me try to think of the circle. Since the circle is tangent to AB at (19,0), and has radius r, so the center of the circle is at (19, r), because the radius is perpendicular to AB at the point of tangency. Wait, AB is horizontal, so the tangent at P is horizontal, so the radius from the center to P is vertical. Therefore, the center has the same x-coordinate as P, which is 19, and y-coordinate equal to r. Therefore, the center is at (19, r).Similarly, the circle is tangent to CD at Q. The radius at point Q is perpendicular to CD. If we can find the coordinates of Q, we can find the equation of CD and determine the other points. However, this might get complicated.Alternatively, since we know the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency, maybe we can use the fact that the distance from the center of the circle to each vertex is equal to the square root of (the square of the tangent length plus r squared). Wait, let me explain.For example, take vertex A. The distance from A to the center of the circle should be equal to √(AP² + r²), because AP is the tangent segment from A to the circle, and the line from A to the center forms a right triangle with AP and the radius r. Similarly, the distance from B to the center is √(BP² + r²), from C to the center is √(CQ² + r²), and from D to the center is √(DQ² + r²). So, if we can write coordinates for the center and for the vertices, we can set up equations.But let&#39;s see. Let me place the center at (19, r), as before. Then, point A is (0,0), and the distance from A to the center (19, r) is √(19² + r²). Similarly, point B is (45,0), and the distance from B to the center is √((45 - 19)² + r²) = √(26² + r²). Point C and D are more complicated, as we don&#39;t know their coordinates.But maybe we can express the coordinates of C and D in terms of the tangent lengths. Let me try. Let&#39;s denote that CD is tangent to the circle at Q. Since the center is at (19, r), the radius to point Q is perpendicular to CD. Let&#39;s suppose that Q has coordinates (x_q, y_q), which lies on CD. Then, the line CD is tangent to the circle at Q, so the vector from the center to Q is perpendicular to CD. The slope of CD is then perpendicular to the slope of the radius OQ.But this seems complicated without knowing the coordinates of Q. Alternatively, since we know the length CQ = 37 and QD = 23, perhaps we can model CD as a line segment of length 60, with Q partitioning it into 37 and 23. Let me denote point C as (c_x, c_y) and D as (d_x, d_y). Then, Q is a point on CD such that CQ = 37 and QD = 23. Therefore, Q divides CD in the ratio CQ:QD = 37:23. Therefore, the coordinates of Q can be expressed as a weighted average: Q_x = (23*c_x + 37*d_x)/(37 + 23) = (23*c_x + 37*d_x)/60, and similarly Q_y = (23*c_y + 37*d_y)/60.But since Q is the point of tangency on CD, the line CD must be tangent to the circle at Q. The center of the circle is at (19, r), so the line CD must satisfy two conditions: it passes through Q, and the vector from the center to Q is perpendicular to CD.Therefore, the slope of CD is equal to the slope of the line connecting Q to (19, r) turned by 90 degrees. Wait, the slope of CD is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of OQ (since they are perpendicular). So, if the slope of OQ is (Q_y - r)/(Q_x - 19), then the slope of CD is - (Q_x - 19)/(Q_y - r).But this seems quite involved. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of A and B, and the center at (19, r), perhaps we can find the coordinates of C and D such that the distances from C and D to the center satisfy the tangent lengths.From point C, the tangent to the circle is CQ = 37. Therefore, the distance from C to the center should be √(37² + r²). Similarly, the distance from D to the center is √(23² + r²). Also, the length CD is 60, so the distance between points C and D is 60.Therefore, if we can set up coordinates for C and D such that:1. The distance between C and D is 60.2. The distance from C to the center (19, r) is √(37² + r²).3. The distance from D to the center (19, r) is √(23² + r²).Additionally, since the quadrilateral is ABCD, the sides BC and DA must connect appropriately. We know BC = 63 and DA = 42.But this is getting quite complicated. Maybe we can set up equations based on coordinates.Let me denote point C as (c_x, c_y) and point D as (d_x, d_y). Then:1. The distance between C and D is 60: √( (c_x - d_x)^2 + (c_y - d_y)^2 ) = 60.2. The distance from C to the center (19, r) is √( (c_x - 19)^2 + (c_y - r)^2 ) = √(37² + r²). Squaring both sides: (c_x - 19)^2 + (c_y - r)^2 = 37² + r². Simplifying: (c_x - 19)^2 + c_y² - 2 c_y r + r² = 37² + r². Therefore, (c_x - 19)^2 + c_y² - 2 c_y r = 37². Similarly, for point D:3. The distance from D to the center (19, r) is √( (d_x - 19)^2 + (d_y - r)^2 ) = √(23² + r²). Squaring both sides: (d_x - 19)^2 + (d_y - r)^2 = 23² + r². Simplifying: (d_x - 19)^2 + d_y² - 2 d_y r + r² = 23² + r². Therefore, (d_x - 19)^2 + d_y² - 2 d_y r = 23².Additionally, we have the sides BC = 63 and DA = 42. The coordinates of B are (45, 0), so the distance from B to C is 63:4. √( (c_x - 45)^2 + (c_y - 0)^2 ) = 63 =&gt; (c_x - 45)^2 + c_y² = 63².Similarly, the distance from D to A is 42, where A is (0,0):5. √( (d_x - 0)^2 + (d_y - 0)^2 ) = 42 =&gt; d_x² + d_y² = 42².So now we have five equations:1. √( (c_x - d_x)^2 + (c_y - d_y)^2 ) = 60.2. (c_x - 19)^2 + c_y² - 2 c_y r = 37².3. (d_x - 19)^2 + d_y² - 2 d_y r = 23².4. (c_x - 45)^2 + c_y² = 63².5. d_x² + d_y² = 42².That&#39;s a lot of equations. Let me see if I can manipulate them to solve for r.First, let&#39;s handle equations 2 and 4 for point C.From equation 4: (c_x - 45)^2 + c_y² = 63². Let&#39;s expand that:c_x² - 90 c_x + 2025 + c_y² = 3969.Therefore, c_x² + c_y² = 3969 + 90 c_x - 2025 = 90 c_x + 1944. (Equation 4a)From equation 2: (c_x - 19)^2 + c_y² - 2 c_y r = 37².Expand (c_x - 19)^2:c_x² - 38 c_x + 361 + c_y² - 2 c_y r = 1369.Therefore, c_x² + c_y² - 38 c_x - 2 c_y r = 1369 - 361 = 1008.But from equation 4a, c_x² + c_y² = 90 c_x + 1944. Substitute that into equation 2:90 c_x + 1944 - 38 c_x - 2 c_y r = 1008.Simplify:(90 c_x - 38 c_x) + 1944 - 2 c_y r = 1008.52 c_x + 1944 - 2 c_y r = 1008.Subtract 1008 from both sides:52 c_x + 1944 - 1008 - 2 c_y r = 0.52 c_x + 936 - 2 c_y r = 0.Divide both sides by 2:26 c_x + 468 - c_y r = 0.Therefore, 26 c_x + 468 = c_y r. (Equation 6)Similarly, handle equations 3 and 5 for point D.From equation 5: d_x² + d_y² = 42² = 1764. (Equation 5a)From equation 3: (d_x - 19)^2 + d_y² - 2 d_y r = 23² = 529.Expand (d_x - 19)^2:d_x² - 38 d_x + 361 + d_y² - 2 d_y r = 529.Substitute d_x² + d_y² from equation 5a:1764 - 38 d_x + 361 - 2 d_y r = 529.Simplify:1764 + 361 - 38 d_x - 2 d_y r = 529.2125 - 38 d_x - 2 d_y r = 529.Subtract 529 from both sides:2125 - 529 - 38 d_x - 2 d_y r = 0.1596 - 38 d_x - 2 d_y r = 0.Divide both sides by 2:798 - 19 d_x - d_y r = 0.Therefore, 798 - 19 d_x = d_y r. (Equation 7)So now, we have equations 6 and 7:Equation 6: 26 c_x + 468 = c_y r.Equation 7: 798 - 19 d_x = d_y r.We need more relations. Let&#39;s look at equation 1: the distance between C and D is 60. So,√( (c_x - d_x)^2 + (c_y - d_y)^2 ) = 60.Squaring both sides:(c_x - d_x)^2 + (c_y - d_y)^2 = 3600. (Equation 1a)Now, perhaps we can express c_y and d_y in terms of c_x and d_x using equations 6 and 7.From equation 6: c_y = (26 c_x + 468)/r.From equation 7: d_y = (798 - 19 d_x)/r.So, substitute these into equation 1a:(c_x - d_x)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 468)/r - (798 - 19 d_x)/r ]^2 = 3600.Simplify:(c_x - d_x)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 468 - 798 + 19 d_x)/r ]^2 = 3600.Compute numerator inside the second term:26 c_x + 468 - 798 + 19 d_x = 26 c_x + 19 d_x - 330.Therefore:(c_x - d_x)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 19 d_x - 330)/r ]^2 = 3600.Hmm, still complex. Maybe we can find another relation between c_x and d_x.Looking back at the coordinates, perhaps we can find the coordinates of C and D in terms of each other?Alternatively, note that BC = 63. The coordinates of B are (45,0), so the coordinates of C must satisfy equation 4: (c_x - 45)^2 + c_y² = 63².But c_y is expressed as (26 c_x + 468)/r from equation 6. So, substitute that into equation 4:(c_x - 45)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 468)/r ]² = 63².Similarly, for point D, equation 5: d_x² + d_y² = 42². But d_y = (798 - 19 d_x)/r from equation 7. So:d_x² + [ (798 - 19 d_x)/r ]² = 42².Therefore, we have two equations in variables c_x, d_x, and r. This is getting very complicated, but perhaps we can proceed.Let me write down these equations:For point C:(c_x - 45)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 468)/r ]² = 63². (Equation 8)For point D:d_x² + [ (798 - 19 d_x)/r ]² = 42². (Equation 9)Additionally, equation 1a:(c_x - d_x)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 468)/r - (798 - 19 d_x)/r ]² = 3600. (Equation 1a)So, equations 8, 9, and 1a involve c_x, d_x, and r. This system seems very difficult to solve, but maybe we can find a relationship between c_x and d_x.Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize c_x and d_x. Let me consider that variables c_x and d_x can be related through the quadrilateral.Alternatively, notice that equations 8 and 9 can be used to express c_x and d_x in terms of r, which might then be substituted into equation 1a. Let&#39;s attempt that.Starting with equation 8:(c_x - 45)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 468)/r ]² = 63².Let me expand (c_x - 45)^2:c_x² - 90 c_x + 2025 + (26 c_x + 468)² / r² = 3969.Multiply both sides by r²:r²(c_x² - 90 c_x + 2025) + (26 c_x + 468)^2 = 3969 r².Similarly, for equation 9:d_x² + [ (798 - 19 d_x)/r ]² = 42².Multiply both sides by r²:r² d_x² + (798 - 19 d_x)^2 = 1764 r².This is getting even more complicated, but perhaps if we subtract the left sides and right sides appropriately, we can find a relation.Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution for c_x and d_x. Let me assume that c_x and d_x are linear functions of r. However, that&#39;s a shot in the dark.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to assign specific values. Let me see if there is a value of r that makes these equations hold.Alternatively, perhaps there is a relation between the product of the tangent segments? Wait, in some cases, for bicentric quadrilaterals, there&#39;s a relation between the inradius and the circumradius, but this is tangential, not necessarily cyclic.Alternatively, perhaps note that the area is r*s = 105 r, and the area can also be calculated using Bretschneider&#39;s formula, which generalizes Brahmagupta&#39;s formula for any quadrilateral: K = √( (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d) - abcd cos²θ ), where θ is the sum of two opposite angles. But since we don&#39;t know θ, this might not help.Wait, but if the quadrilateral is bicentric, then the formula would be different. However, we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s bicentric. So maybe this is not helpful.Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the radius in a tangential quadrilateral:r = frac{K}{s} = frac{sqrt{(ab + cd)(bc + da)}}{s}Wait, no, that&#39;s not a formula I recall. Wait, let me check. For a tangential quadrilateral, is there a formula involving the product of the sides?Alternatively, here&#39;s another thought. The area of a quadrilateral can sometimes be expressed as the sum of the areas of two triangles. If we split the quadrilateral along a diagonal, say AC, then K = area ABC + area ADC. If we can compute those areas, perhaps we can sum them up.But to compute the areas of triangles ABC and ADC, we need the lengths of the diagonals AC and BD, which we don&#39;t have. However, if we can express the areas in terms of r, maybe.Alternatively, since the circle is inscribed in the quadrilateral, each triangle formed by the center and a side has an area of (1/2)*side*r. Therefore, total area K = sum of these areas = (1/2)*r*(AB + BC + CD + DA) = r*s. Which brings us back to the same formula. Therefore, unless we have another way to compute the area, we can&#39;t proceed.Wait, but maybe we can compute the area using coordinates. If we can find coordinates for all the points, then we can apply the shoelace formula.But to do that, we need coordinates for all four points, which requires solving the system of equations I set up earlier. That seems very involved, but maybe possible.Alternatively, let&#39;s notice that in equations 6 and 7, we have expressions for c_y and d_y in terms of c_x, d_x, and r. Let me write those again:c_y = (26 c_x + 468)/rd_y = (798 - 19 d_x)/rNow, let&#39;s consider the shoelace formula for the area of quadrilateral ABCD. The coordinates are A(0,0), B(45,0), C(c_x, c_y), D(d_x, d_y). The area using the shoelace formula is:K = 1/2 | (0*0 + 45*c_y + c_x*d_y + d_x*0) - (0*45 + 0*c_x + c_y*d_x + d_y*0) |Simplify:K = 1/2 | 45 c_y + c_x d_y - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 | = 1/2 |45 c_y + c_x d_y|But we also know that K = r*s = 105 r. Therefore,1/2 |45 c_y + c_x d_y| = 105 r.Assuming the quadrilateral is convex and the points are ordered correctly, the area should be positive, so we can drop the absolute value:1/2 (45 c_y + c_x d_y) = 105 r.Multiply both sides by 2:45 c_y + c_x d_y = 210 r.Now, substitute c_y and d_y from equations 6 and 7:45*( (26 c_x + 468)/r ) + c_x*( (798 - 19 d_x)/r ) = 210 r.Multiply through by r to eliminate denominators:45*(26 c_x + 468) + c_x*(798 - 19 d_x) = 210 r².Compute each term:First term: 45*26 c_x + 45*468 = 1170 c_x + 21060.Second term: 798 c_x - 19 c_x d_x.Therefore, the equation becomes:1170 c_x + 21060 + 798 c_x - 19 c_x d_x = 210 r².Combine like terms:(1170 + 798) c_x - 19 c_x d_x + 21060 = 210 r².1968 c_x - 19 c_x d_x + 21060 = 210 r².Factor out c_x:c_x (1968 - 19 d_x) + 21060 = 210 r². (Equation 10)Now, we need another relation involving c_x, d_x, and r. Let&#39;s look back at equation 1a:(c_x - d_x)^2 + [ (26 c_x + 468)/r - (798 - 19 d_x)/r ]^2 = 3600.Simplify the second term:,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so there&#39;s this problem about a circle inscribed in a quadrilateral ABCD. The circle is tangent to AB at point P and to CD at point Q. We&#39;re given the lengths AP = 19, PB = 26, CQ = 37, and QD = 23. We need to find the square of the radius of the circle. Hmm, interesting. Let me think step by step.First, I remember that if a circle is inscribed in a quadrilateral, then the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral, which means the sum of the lengths of the two opposite sides are equal. Wait, is that right? Let me recall. For a quadrilateral to have an inscribed circle (be tangential), the sums of its two pairs of opposite sides must be equal. So, AB + CD = BC + DA. That seems familiar. So, maybe I can use this property here.But before that, let&#39;s note down the given information. AB is divided by the point of tangency P into AP = 19 and PB = 26. Similarly, CD is divided by Q into CQ = 37 and QD = 23. So, first, maybe I can compute the lengths of AB and CD.AB = AP + PB = 19 + 26 = 45.CD = CQ + QD = 37 + 23 = 60.So AB = 45, CD = 60. Then, according to the tangential quadrilateral property, AB + CD should equal BC + DA. So, 45 + 60 = 105. Therefore, BC + DA = 105. Hmm, okay. But how does that help me find the radius?Wait, maybe there&#39;s another formula related to the radius of an inscribed circle in a quadrilateral. Let me recall. For a tangential quadrilateral, the area can be expressed as the product of the semiperimeter and the radius. Wait, similar to a circle inscribed in a triangle, where area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. But for quadrilaterals, is it the same? Let me check.Yes, actually, for a tangential quadrilateral, the area K is equal to the product of the inradius r and the semiperimeter s. So, K = r * s. Therefore, if I can find the area of quadrilateral ABCD, and compute the semiperimeter, then I can solve for r.But how do I find the area? Hmm. The problem is that we don&#39;t know the exact shape of the quadrilateral, just that it&#39;s tangential with certain tangent lengths. Maybe there&#39;s a formula for the area in terms of the tangent lengths?Alternatively, maybe we can split the quadrilateral into two triangles and compute the area that way. But without knowing the angles or the lengths of the other sides, that might be tricky. Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another approach. Let me think.Since the circle is tangent to all four sides, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency can be related. Let me recall that in a tangential quadrilateral, if you denote the tangent lengths from each vertex to the points of tangency as follows: suppose from vertex A, the tangent lengths are AP and AS (assuming the circle is tangent to AB at P and to AD at S). Similarly, from vertex B, the tangent lengths are BP and BQ (tangent to BC at Q), from C: CQ and CR, and from D: DR and DS. Then, the key property is that the sums of opposite sides are equal, which gives AB + CD = BC + DA. But also, the tangent lengths satisfy the following: if we let AP = AS = x, BP = BQ = y, CQ = CR = z, and DR = DS = w, then the sides can be expressed as:AB = AP + BP = x + y,BC = BQ + CQ = y + z,CD = CR + DR = z + w,DA = DS + AS = w + x.Then, the semiperimeter s = (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2 = ( (x + y) + (y + z) + (z + w) + (w + x) ) / 2 = (2x + 2y + 2z + 2w)/2 = x + y + z + w.But also, AB + CD = (x + y) + (z + w) = x + y + z + w = s,Similarly, BC + DA = (y + z) + (w + x) = x + y + z + w = s. Hence, AB + CD = BC + DA = 2s? Wait, no. Wait, if AB + CD = s and BC + DA = s, then AB + CD = BC + DA = s. But earlier, the semiperimeter s would be (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2. So, if AB + CD = BC + DA = s, then (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2 = (s + s)/2 = s. So, the semiperimeter is equal to AB + CD, which is equal to BC + DA. So, that checks out.But how does this help? Let me look back at the given problem. We know AP = 19, PB = 26, CQ = 37, QD = 23. So, in terms of the tangent lengths:From vertex A, AP = 19. Since AP = AS = x = 19.From vertex B, BP = 26. So BP = BQ = y = 26.From vertex C, CQ = 37. So CQ = CR = z = 37.From vertex D, QD = 23. Wait, QD is the tangent from D to the circle. Since the circle is tangent to CD at Q, then the tangent from D would be DQ. Therefore, DQ = DR = w = 23.Therefore, the sides can be expressed as:AB = AP + BP = x + y = 19 + 26 = 45,BC = BQ + CQ = y + z = 26 + 37 = 63,CD = CR + DR = z + w = 37 + 23 = 60,DA = DS + AS = w + x = 23 + 19 = 42.Therefore, sides AB = 45, BC = 63, CD = 60, DA = 42.So, the semiperimeter s = (AB + BC + CD + DA)/2 = (45 + 63 + 60 + 42)/2 = (210)/2 = 105.But we also know from the tangential quadrilateral property that AB + CD = 45 + 60 = 105, and BC + DA = 63 + 42 = 105, so that checks out.So, now, if I can compute the area K of the quadrilateral, then K = r * s, so r = K / s. Then, since we need r², we can compute (K / 105)², but first, we need K.But how to compute the area? For a general quadrilateral, unless it&#39;s cyclic as well, the area isn&#39;t straightforward. But this is a tangential quadrilateral, not necessarily cyclic. Is there a formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral?Wait, yes, I think there is a formula similar to Brahmagupta&#39;s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. Brahmagupta&#39;s formula states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the area is sqrt[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)], where s is the semiperimeter. But for tangential quadrilaterals, there isn&#39;t a direct formula like that, unless it&#39;s bicentric (both cyclic and tangential). However, if the quadrilateral is both cyclic and tangential, then we can use Brahmagupta&#39;s formula. But we don&#39;t know if ABCD is cyclic here.Alternatively, for a tangential quadrilateral, the area can be found using the formula K = r * s, as we mentioned. But we need another way to compute the area. Alternatively, maybe we can split the quadrilateral into two triangles and compute the area of each triangle, then sum them up. But to do that, we need to know some angles or the lengths of the diagonals, which we don&#39;t have.Wait, but since we have an incircle, maybe there&#39;s a relation between the radius and the area. Wait, but that&#39;s exactly the formula K = r * s. But since we need K to find r, but we need r to find K, that&#39;s circular. So we need another approach.Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in a tangential quadrilateral, the area can also be expressed as K = sqrt(abcd), where a, b, c, d are the sides, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s correct. Wait, no, that&#39;s for a bicentric quadrilateral, maybe?Wait, perhaps Heron&#39;s formula can be applied here. Heron&#39;s formula is for triangles, but maybe if we split the quadrilateral into two triangles. Let&#39;s try that.Suppose we split the quadrilateral along the diagonal AC. Then, we have triangle ABC and triangle ADC. The area of the quadrilateral would be the sum of the areas of these two triangles. However, to compute their areas, we need the lengths of the diagonal AC and the angles, which we don&#39;t have.Alternatively, maybe split the quadrilateral into four right triangles by the radius? Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think differently.Wait, in a tangential quadrilateral with an incircle, the inradius is related to the area. So, K = r * s. If we can find K another way, then we can solve for r.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a relation between the sides and the radius through the formula for the area. Wait, for a convex quadrilateral with an incircle, there&#39;s another formula for the area in terms of the sides and the radius?Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let&#39;s assume the circle is centered at the origin (0,0), and has radius r. Then, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are tangent to the circle. Let&#39;s try to model the quadrilateral.But this might be complicated. Let me think. Let&#39;s denote the points of tangency. The circle is tangent to AB at P, BC at some point, CD at Q, and DA at some point. Wait, but we know the points of tangency on AB and CD. Let me denote:Let’s call the points of tangency on AB, BC, CD, DA as P, R, Q, S respectively.So, AP = AS = 19,PB = BP = 26,BQ = BR = 26 (Wait, no. Wait, from the previous notation, if BP = 26, then BQ = BP = 26? Wait, no, earlier, we had:AP = AS = x = 19,BP = BQ = y = 26,CQ = CR = z = 37,DQ = DR = w = 23.Therefore, the points of tangency on the sides:AB is tangent at P, so AP = 19, PB = 26,BC is tangent at R, so BR = BQ = 26, CR = 37,CD is tangent at Q, so CQ = 37, QD = 23,DA is tangent at S, so DS = 23, AS = 19.Therefore, the sides:AB: from A to B, length 45,BC: from B to C, length 63,CD: from C to D, length 60,DA: from D to A, length 42.So, if we can model the coordinates of the points A, B, C, D such that the circle is tangent to each side at the given points, then maybe we can compute the radius. Let&#39;s try that.Let’s set up coordinate system with point P at (0,0). Since the circle is tangent to AB at P, the radius to point P is perpendicular to AB. So, if we set AB along the x-axis, then the center of the circle O is at (0, r), since the radius is perpendicular to AB at P. Wait, but if P is at (0,0) and AB is along the x-axis, then the center is at (0, r). Then, point A is at (-AP, 0) = (-19, 0), and point B is at (PB, 0) = (26, 0). Wait, but AP is 19, so the length from A to P is 19, so if P is at (0,0), then A is at (-19, 0). Similarly, B is at (26, 0).Then, the circle is tangent to CD at Q. Let’s denote Q as some point on CD. But we need to figure out the coordinates of Q. Wait, but CQ is 37 and QD is 23. So CD has total length 60. Let&#39;s denote CD as from point C to D. The circle is tangent to CD at Q, so CQ = 37, QD = 23. Therefore, if we can find the coordinates of C and D such that CD is tangent to the circle at Q.But since the circle is tangent to CD at Q, the radius OQ is perpendicular to CD. Similarly, the radius OP is perpendicular to AB, which we&#39;ve set as the x-axis, so OP is vertical. Similarly, OQ is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, if we can find the coordinates of Q, then we can find the slope of CD, since OQ is perpendicular to CD.But how to find coordinates of C and D? Let me think. Maybe we can parametrize the problem.Given that the circle is centered at (0, r), since it&#39;s tangent to AB at P=(0,0). Wait, but if AB is along the x-axis from A=(-19,0) to B=(26,0), then the center is at (0, r), since the radius is perpendicular to AB.Now, the circle is also tangent to CD at Q. Let&#39;s denote the coordinates of Q. Since CD has length 60, and Q divides CD into CQ=37 and QD=23. So, if we can find the coordinates of C and D such that CD is tangent to the circle at Q, and the distances from C to Q is 37, Q to D is 23.But this seems a bit involved. Maybe we can parametrize the line CD. Let&#39;s suppose that Q is a point (x, y) on the circle. The circle has center (0, r) and radius r. So, the equation of the circle is x² + (y - r)² = r². Simplifying, x² + y² - 2ry + r² = r², so x² + y² - 2ry = 0.Since Q is a point on the circle, so coordinates (x, y) satisfy x² + y² - 2 r y = 0.Also, the line CD is tangent to the circle at Q, so the slope of CD is perpendicular to the radius OQ. The slope of OQ is (y - r)/x. Therefore, the slope of CD is -x/(y - r).But also, CD is divided by Q into segments CQ = 37 and QD = 23. So, from point Q, moving along CD in one direction for 37 units reaches C, and in the other direction for 23 units reaches D.But we need to relate this to the coordinates. Let&#39;s denote the direction vector of CD. Let’s call the direction vector of CD as (a, b). Since the slope of CD is -x/(y - r), then direction vector can be proportional to ( (y - r), -x ). Because slope is rise over run, so if slope is -x/(y - r), then run is (y - r) and rise is -x. Therefore, direction vector is (y - r, -x). But we need to normalize it to unit length or something?Wait, the length of CD is 60, so from C to D is 60 units. The point Q is located 37 units from C and 23 units from D. So, the coordinates of C and D can be expressed in terms of Q plus or minus some multiple of the direction vector.But perhaps this is getting too complex. Maybe we can parametrize CD.Let’s suppose that the line CD has direction vector (m, n), and passes through Q(x, y). Then, points C and D can be written as:C = Q - 37*(m, n)/sqrt(m² + n²),D = Q + 23*(m, n)/sqrt(m² + n²).But since CD has length 60, the distance between C and D is 60. The distance between C and D is (37 + 23)*sqrt(m² + n²)/sqrt(m² + n²) ) = 60, which checks out.But the direction vector (m, n) must be proportional to the direction of CD, which we previously determined as (y - r, -x). Therefore, (m, n) = k*(y - r, -x) for some scalar k.But this is getting complicated. Maybe we can find the coordinates of Q in terms of r.Wait, since Q is a point on the circle, so x² + (y - r)^2 = r^2 =&gt; x² + y² - 2 r y = 0.Also, the line CD is tangent to the circle at Q, so the equation of CD can be written as:The tangent line at Q(x, y) to the circle centered at (0, r) is x*X + (y - r)(Y - r) = r². Wait, no. The equation of the tangent line to a circle at point (x1, y1) is (x1)(X) + (y1 - r)(Y - r) = r². Wait, maybe not. Wait, the standard equation for a tangent line at point (x1, y1) on the circle (X - a)^2 + (Y - b)^2 = r^2 is (x1 - a)(X - a) + (y1 - b)(Y - b) = r^2. But in our case, the circle is centered at (0, r), so a = 0, b = r. So, the tangent line at Q(x, y) is (x - 0)(X - 0) + (y - r)(Y - r) = r².Therefore, the equation is x X + (y - r)(Y - r) = r².Simplifying:x X + (y - r)Y - (y - r)r = r²,x X + (y - r)Y - r(y - r) = r²,x X + (y - r)Y = r² + r(y - r) = r² + r y - r² = r y.So, the equation of the tangent line CD at Q(x, y) is x X + (y - r) Y = r y.Now, the line CD passes through points C and D, which are 37 and 23 units away from Q, respectively. But how can we find coordinates of C and D?Alternatively, since we know the direction of CD, which is perpendicular to the radius OQ. So, the direction vector of CD is perpendicular to the vector OQ, which is (x, y - r). Therefore, direction vector of CD is (y - r, -x). Therefore, the line CD has direction vector (y - r, -x).Therefore, parametric equations for CD can be written as starting at Q(x, y) and moving in the direction of (y - r, -x). So, points on CD can be written as (x + t(y - r), y - t x), where t is a parameter.Now, the distance from Q to C is 37, and from Q to D is 23. So, we can find the coordinates of C and D by moving along the line CD in both directions.The distance between Q and any point on CD is |t| * sqrt( (y - r)^2 + (-x)^2 ). So, to move 37 units from Q to C, we set |t| * sqrt( (y - r)^2 + x^2 ) = 37. Similarly, for D, |t| * sqrt(...) = 23.But sqrt( (y - r)^2 + x^2 ) is the magnitude of the direction vector, which is the same as the length of OQ. Wait, OQ is the radius, so the length of OQ is r. Wait, but OQ is the radius vector from center (0, r) to Q(x, y). Therefore, the length of OQ is sqrt( x² + (y - r)^2 ) = r, since Q is on the circle. Wait, that&#39;s the definition of the circle. Therefore, sqrt(x² + (y - r)^2) = r, so sqrt( x² + y² - 2 r y + r² ) = r. Squaring both sides, x² + y² - 2 r y + r² = r², which simplifies to x² + y² - 2 r y = 0, which is the equation we had earlier.But the direction vector (y - r, -x) has magnitude sqrt( (y - r)^2 + x² ) = sqrt( x² + (y - r)^2 ) = r. Therefore, the direction vector has magnitude r. Therefore, to move 37 units along CD from Q, we need to scale the direction vector (y - r, -x) by 37 / r. Similarly, in the opposite direction for 23 units.Therefore, the coordinates of C and D can be written as:C = Q + ( (y - r) * (37 / r ), -x * (37 / r ) )D = Q + ( -(y - r) * (23 / r ), x * (23 / r ) )But Q is (x, y), so:C = ( x + (y - r)(37 / r ), y - x(37 / r ) )D = ( x - (y - r)(23 / r ), y + x(23 / r ) )Now, we also know that DA is tangent to the circle at S. From the earlier tangent lengths, DA is 42, which is DS + AS = 23 + 19 = 42. So, point S is the point of tangency on DA, 23 units from D and 19 units from A.Similarly, BC is tangent to the circle at R, with BR = 26 and CR = 37.So, we need to ensure that points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral with sides AB = 45, BC = 63, CD = 60, DA = 42, and with the circle tangent to all sides.But perhaps we can use the coordinates of points A, B, C, D to set up equations. Let me attempt that.We already have points A and B. A is at (-19, 0), B is at (26, 0). We need to find coordinates of C and D.But we have expressions for C and D in terms of x, y, r. However, we also know that points C and D must lie on lines BC and DA, respectively, with appropriate lengths.Wait, but BC is from B(26, 0) to C, which we need to determine. Similarly, DA is from D to A(-19, 0). The lengths BC = 63, DA = 42.So, the distance from B(26,0) to C must be 63, and the distance from D to A(-19, 0) must be 42.Therefore, using the coordinates of C and D in terms of x, y, r, we can set up equations based on distances.Let me write down the coordinates:C = ( x + (y - r)(37 / r ), y - x(37 / r ) )Distance from B(26,0) to C:sqrt[ ( x + (y - r)(37 / r ) - 26 )² + ( y - x(37 / r ) - 0 )² ] = 63.Similarly, D = ( x - (y - r)(23 / r ), y + x(23 / r ) )Distance from D to A(-19, 0):sqrt[ ( x - (y - r)(23 / r ) + 19 )² + ( y + x(23 / r ) - 0 )² ] = 42.Additionally, the points C and D must lie on lines BC and DA, respectively, which we can perhaps parameterize. However, this seems complicated. Let me see if there&#39;s another approach.Alternatively, since we have expressions for C and D in terms of x, y, r, and we can write the distances BC and DA, perhaps we can square those distance equations to eliminate the square roots.Let&#39;s denote:For the distance BC = 63:[ x + (y - r)(37 / r ) - 26 ]² + [ y - x(37 / r ) ]² = 63².For the distance DA = 42:[ x - (y - r)(23 / r ) + 19 ]² + [ y + x(23 / r ) ]² = 42².These are two equations in variables x, y, r. Additionally, we have the equation of the circle:x² + (y - r)² = r² =&gt; x² + y² - 2 r y = 0.So, three equations:1. x² + y² - 2 r y = 0.2. [ x + (y - r)(37 / r ) - 26 ]² + [ y - x(37 / r ) ]² = 63².3. [ x - (y - r)(23 / r ) + 19 ]² + [ y + x(23 / r ) ]² = 42².This seems very complex. Maybe we can make some substitutions or find relations between x and y.Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize x and y in terms of r. Let me see.From the circle equation:x² + y² - 2 r y = 0 =&gt; x² = 2 r y - y².So, x² = y (2 r - y).Perhaps we can express x in terms of y and r. But this may not simplify things immediately.Alternatively, let&#39;s look at the other equations. Let me expand equation 2:[ x + (y - r)(37 / r ) - 26 ]² + [ y - x(37 / r ) ]² = 63².Let me denote (37 / r ) as k for simplicity. Then, the equation becomes:[ x + (y - r ) k - 26 ]² + [ y - x k ]² = 63².Similarly, let me expand the first term:[ x + k y - k r - 26 ]² = [x + k y - (k r + 26)]².Similarly, the second term is [ y - k x ]².Expanding both:First term:(x + k y - (k r + 26))² = x² + 2 x k y + k² y² - 2 x (k r + 26) - 2 k y (k r + 26) + (k r + 26)².Second term:(y - k x )² = y² - 2 k x y + k² x².Adding both:x² + 2 k x y + k² y² - 2 x (k r + 26) - 2 k y (k r + 26) + (k r + 26)² + y² - 2 k x y + k² x².Combine like terms:x² + k² x² + y² + k² y² + 2 k x y - 2 k x y - 2 x (k r + 26) - 2 k y (k r + 26) + (k r + 26)².Simplify:x²(1 + k²) + y²(1 + k²) - 2 x (k r + 26) - 2 k y (k r + 26) + (k r + 26)².Factor out (1 + k²):(1 + k²)(x² + y²) - 2 (k r + 26)(x + k y) + (k r + 26)².But from the circle equation, x² + y² = 2 r y. Therefore, substitute that in:(1 + k²)(2 r y) - 2 (k r + 26)(x + k y) + (k r + 26)².Now, substitute k = 37 / r:First, compute 1 + k² = 1 + (37 / r )².Then, 2 r y * (1 + (37 / r )² ) = 2 r y + 2 r y * (37² / r² ) = 2 r y + 2 * 37² y / r.Next term: -2 ( (37 / r ) r + 26 ) (x + (37 / r ) y ) = -2 (37 + 26) (x + (37 / r ) y ) = -2 * 63 (x + (37 / r ) y ).Third term: ( (37 / r ) r + 26 )² = (37 + 26 )² = 63².Putting it all together:[2 r y + 2 * 37² y / r ] - 126 (x + (37 / r ) y ) + 63² = 63².Wait, the entire left-hand side equals 63², so:2 r y + (2 * 37² / r ) y - 126 x - (126 * 37 / r ) y + 63² = 63².Subtract 63² from both sides:2 r y + (2 * 37² / r ) y - 126 x - (126 * 37 / r ) y = 0.Factor out y terms:y [ 2 r + (2 * 37² / r ) - (126 * 37 / r ) ] - 126 x = 0.Let me compute the coefficients:First term inside the brackets:2 r.Second term: (2 * 37² ) / r = (2 * 1369 ) / r = 2738 / r.Third term: (126 * 37 ) / r = (4662 ) / r.Therefore, the coefficient of y is:2 r + (2738 - 4662 ) / r = 2 r - 1924 / r.Therefore, the equation becomes:y (2 r - 1924 / r ) - 126 x = 0.Similarly, let&#39;s do the same for equation 3, the DA distance equation.Equation 3:[ x - (y - r)(23 / r ) + 19 ]² + [ y + x(23 / r ) ]² = 42².Let me denote (23 / r ) as m. Then, the equation becomes:[ x - (y - r ) m + 19 ]² + [ y + m x ]² = 42².Expanding the first term:[ x - m y + m r + 19 ]² = [x - m y + (m r + 19)]².Expanding:x² - 2 m x y + m² y² + 2 x (m r + 19 ) - 2 m y (m r + 19 ) + (m r + 19 )².Second term:[ y + m x ]² = y² + 2 m x y + m² x².Adding both terms:x² - 2 m x y + m² y² + 2 x (m r + 19 ) - 2 m y (m r + 19 ) + (m r + 19 )² + y² + 2 m x y + m² x².Combine like terms:x² + m² x² + y² + m² y² + (-2 m x y + 2 m x y ) + 2 x (m r + 19 ) - 2 m y (m r + 19 ) + (m r + 19 )².Simplify:x²(1 + m² ) + y²(1 + m² ) + 2 x (m r + 19 ) - 2 m y (m r + 19 ) + (m r + 19 )².Factor out (1 + m² ):(1 + m² )(x² + y² ) + 2 (m r + 19 ) x - 2 m (m r + 19 ) y + (m r + 19 )².Again, from the circle equation x² + y² = 2 r y. Substitute:(1 + m² )(2 r y ) + 2 (m r + 19 ) x - 2 m (m r + 19 ) y + (m r + 19 )².Now, substitute m = 23 / r:First term:(1 + (23 / r )² ) * 2 r y = [1 + (529 / r² ) ] * 2 r y = 2 r y + (1058 / r ) y.Second term: 2 ( (23 / r ) r + 19 ) x = 2 (23 + 19 ) x = 2 * 42 x = 84 x.Third term: -2 * (23 / r ) ( (23 / r ) r + 19 ) y = -2 * (23 / r ) (23 + 19 ) y = -2 * (23 / r ) * 42 y = - (1932 / r ) y.Fourth term: ( (23 / r ) r + 19 )² = (23 + 19 )² = 42².Therefore, putting it all together:[2 r y + (1058 / r ) y ] + 84 x - (1932 / r ) y + 42² = 42².Subtract 42² from both sides:2 r y + (1058 / r ) y + 84 x - (1932 / r ) y = 0.Combine like terms:y [ 2 r + (1058 - 1932 ) / r ] + 84 x = 0.Compute the coefficient of y:2 r + (-874 ) / r.Thus, the equation becomes:y (2 r - 874 / r ) + 84 x = 0.So now, from equation 2, we have:y (2 r - 1924 / r ) - 126 x = 0. --- (1)From equation 3, we have:y (2 r - 874 / r ) + 84 x = 0. --- (2)Now, we have two equations (1) and (2) in variables x and y, with parameter r. Let me write them again:Equation (1):y (2 r - 1924 / r ) - 126 x = 0.Equation (2):y (2 r - 874 / r ) + 84 x = 0.Let me write these as:(2 r - 1924 / r ) y = 126 x, --- (1)(2 r - 874 / r ) y = -84 x. --- (2)We can solve these two equations for x and y. Let&#39;s denote:Let’s denote A = 2 r - 1924 / r,B = 2 r - 874 / r.So, equations become:A y = 126 x, --- (1)B y = -84 x. --- (2)From equation (1): x = (A / 126) y.From equation (2): x = - (B / 84) y.Therefore, equate the two expressions for x:(A / 126) y = - (B / 84 ) y.Assuming y ≠ 0 (since otherwise, the circle would have zero radius, which is not possible), we can divide both sides by y:A / 126 = - B / 84.Multiply both sides by 84 * 126 to eliminate denominators:A * 84 = - B * 126.Substitute A and B:(2 r - 1924 / r ) * 84 = - (2 r - 874 / r ) * 126.Let’s compute each side.Left side:(2 r - 1924 / r ) * 84 = 84 * 2 r - 84 * 1924 / r = 168 r - (84 * 1924 ) / r.Right side:- (2 r - 874 / r ) * 126 = -126 * 2 r + 126 * 874 / r = -252 r + (126 * 874 ) / r.Set left side equal to right side:168 r - (84 * 1924 ) / r = -252 r + (126 * 874 ) / r.Bring all terms to one side:168 r + 252 r - (84 * 1924 ) / r - (126 * 874 ) / r = 0.Combine like terms:(168 + 252 ) r - [ (84 * 1924 ) + (126 * 874 ) ] / r = 0.Compute coefficients:168 + 252 = 420.Compute numerator of the fraction:84 * 1924 + 126 * 874.Factor out 42:42 * [2]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9524b0db></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9524b0db><span class="icon" data-v-9524b0db>🔑:</span>Call the [center](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Center) of the circle O.

So, we have a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths. Let me recall that such triangles are called Pythagorean triples. The problem says that one of the legs is 1575 less than the hypotenuse, and the other leg is less than 1991. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse.First, let me denote the sides. Let&#39;s say the legs are ( a ) and ( b ), and the hypotenuse is ( c ). Without loss of generality, let&#39;s assume that the leg which is 1575 less than the hypotenuse is ( a ). So, ( a = c - 1575 ). The other leg ( b ) is less than 1991. Also, since it&#39;s a right-angled triangle, we have the Pythagorean theorem: ( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ).Substituting ( a = c - 1575 ) into the equation:( (c - 1575)^2 + b^2 = c^2 )Let me expand ( (c - 1575)^2 ):( c^2 - 2 times 1575 times c + 1575^2 + b^2 = c^2 )Subtracting ( c^2 ) from both sides:( -2 times 1575 times c + 1575^2 + b^2 = 0 )Let me rearrange the terms:( b^2 = 2 times 1575 times c - 1575^2 )So, ( b^2 = 1575 times (2c - 1575) )Hmm, since ( b ) is a positive integer, ( b^2 ) must be a perfect square, and therefore the right-hand side must also be a perfect square. Let me note that 1575 is a multiple of some squares perhaps? Let me factorize 1575 to see if there&#39;s a square factor.1575 divided by 25 is 63. So, 1575 = 25 × 63. Then 63 is 9 × 7. Therefore, 1575 = 25 × 9 × 7 = ( 3^2 times 5^2 times 7 ). So, 1575 = ( 3^2 times 5^2 times 7 ). Therefore, the square factors here are 9 and 25. So, the expression for ( b^2 ) is:( b^2 = 3^2 times 5^2 times 7 times (2c - 1575) )Therefore, in order for ( b^2 ) to be a perfect square, the remaining factor ( 7 times (2c - 1575) ) must also be a perfect square. Let me denote ( 7 times (2c - 1575) = k^2 ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. Therefore,( 2c - 1575 = frac{k^2}{7} )Since the left side is an integer, ( k^2 ) must be divisible by 7, which implies that ( k ) must be divisible by 7. Let me set ( k = 7m ), where ( m ) is a positive integer. Substituting back:( 2c - 1575 = frac{(7m)^2}{7} = 7m^2 )Therefore,( 2c = 7m^2 + 1575 )( c = frac{7m^2 + 1575}{2} )Since ( c ) must be an integer, ( 7m^2 + 1575 ) must be even. Let&#39;s check the parity. 1575 is odd (since 1575 = 1500 + 75, both even and odd, sum is odd). 7m^2: if m is even, 7m^2 is even; if m is odd, 7m^2 is odd. Therefore, 7m^2 + 1575: if m even, even + odd = odd; if m odd, odd + odd = even. Therefore, to have 7m^2 + 1575 even, m must be odd. So, m is an odd integer. Let&#39;s write m as 2n + 1, where n is a non-negative integer. But maybe it&#39;s better to keep m as odd.So, m is odd. Let me write m = 2n + 1 where n is a non-negative integer. Then,c = (7(2n+1)^2 + 1575)/2Let me expand (2n+1)^2:(4n² + 4n + 1)So,7(4n² + 4n + 1) + 1575 = 28n² + 28n + 7 + 1575 = 28n² + 28n + 1582Then,c = (28n² + 28n + 1582)/2 = 14n² + 14n + 791So, c = 14n² + 14n + 791Now, we also know that the other leg, which is b, is less than 1991. Let&#39;s find an expression for b.From earlier, we had:( b^2 = 1575 times (2c - 1575) )But we also found that 2c - 1575 = 7m². Since m = 7n + something? Wait, no. Earlier, we set k = 7m, then 2c - 1575 = 7m², and m is an integer. Then, from that, we have m = ... Wait, perhaps I need to relate b to m.Wait, from 7*(2c - 1575) = k², then k = 7m, so 2c - 1575 = 7m². Then, substituting back into the expression for b²:( b^2 = 1575 times 7m² = 1575 times 7 m² )But 1575 * 7 = 11025. So, ( b^2 = 11025 m² ). Therefore, b = sqrt(11025 m²) = 105 m. Because sqrt(11025) = 105, since 105^2 = 11025. Let me confirm that: 100^2 = 10000, 105^2 = 11025. Yes. So, b = 105 m.Therefore, the leg b is 105 m, and we are told that b &lt; 1991, so:105 m &lt; 1991So,m &lt; 1991 / 105 ≈ 18.96...Since m is a positive integer (and m is odd, as established earlier), so m can be 1, 3, 5, ..., 17.But m must be such that c is positive, which it will be as long as m is positive. So, possible m values are 1, 3, 5, ..., 17.But we need to find the corresponding hypotenuse c. But the problem says &quot;the hypotenuse&quot;, implying a unique answer. So perhaps there&#39;s only one m in that range that gives integer c and such that a = c - 1575 is positive. Wait, a = c - 1575 must be positive, so c &gt; 1575. Let&#39;s check.We have c = (7m² + 1575)/2. So:For m = 1: c = (7 + 1575)/2 = 1582/2 = 791. Which is less than 1575? No, wait 791 is less than 1575. So a = 791 - 1575 would be negative. Which is invalid. So m=1 is invalid.Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe my substitution is wrong. Wait, no, when I substituted, I had a = c - 1575. So if c is 791, then a = 791 - 1575 = negative. Which is invalid. Therefore, m=1 gives invalid a.Wait, but m=1 is allowed? Hmm. So perhaps m needs to be sufficiently large so that c &gt; 1575.So, c = (7m² + 1575)/2 &gt; 1575Multiply both sides by 2:7m² + 1575 &gt; 31507m² &gt; 3150 - 1575 = 1575m² &gt; 1575 / 7 = 225Therefore, m² &gt; 225 =&gt; m &gt; 15Since m is odd, m must be at least 17.Wait, m² &gt; 225 =&gt; m &gt; 15. Since m is positive integer and odd. So m can be 17, 19, 21,... But earlier, since m &lt; 1991/105 ≈ 18.96, m must be less than 19. So possible m is 17. Wait, 17 is less than 18.96? 17*105 = 1785 &lt; 1991. 19*105 = 1995, which is greater than 1991, so m=19 would give b=1995, which exceeds the limit. Therefore, m can only be up to 17. But according to the inequality, m must be greater than 15, so m=17.Therefore, m=17 is the only possible value.So, let&#39;s check m=17.Then, c = (7*(17)^2 + 1575)/2Calculate 17^2 = 2897*289 = 20232023 + 1575 = 35983598 / 2 = 1799Therefore, c=1799.Then, a = c - 1575 = 1799 - 1575 = 224b = 105 * 17 = 1785Check if 1785 is less than 1991: yes, since 1785 &lt; 1991.Also, check if 224^2 + 1785^2 = 1799^2Let me compute 224^2: 224*224. Let&#39;s compute:200^2 = 40,00024^2 = 5762*200*24 = 9,600So, (200 + 24)^2 = 40,000 + 9,600 + 576 = 50,176Then 1785^2: Let&#39;s compute this.1785^2. Let&#39;s note that 1700^2 = 2,890,00085^2 = 7,2252*1700*85 = 2*144,500 = 289,000Thus, (1700 + 85)^2 = 2,890,000 + 289,000 + 7,225 = 3,186,225Then, 1799^2: Let&#39;s compute this.1800^2 = 3,240,000Subtract 2*1800 +1 (since (1800 -1)^2 = 1800^2 - 2*1800 +1)Wait, 1799 = 1800 -1So, 1799^2 = (1800 -1)^2 = 1800^2 - 2*1800*1 +1 = 3,240,000 - 3,600 +1 = 3,236,401Now, sum of 224^2 + 1785^2 = 50,176 + 3,186,225 = 3,236,401, which is equal to 1799^2. So the equation holds.Therefore, the hypotenuse is 1799.But let me check if there are other possible m values. Wait, according to the previous reasoning, m must satisfy m &gt; 15 and m &lt;=17 (since m must be odd and less than 18.96). So m=17 is the only possible value. Therefore, the answer is 1799.But let me just confirm if perhaps m=19 is possible. Wait, m=19 would give b=105*19=1995, which exceeds 1991, so no. Therefore, m=17 is the only valid value.Therefore, the hypotenuse is 1799.Final AnswerThe length of the hypotenuse is boxed{1799}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths, one leg is 1575 less than the hypotenuse, and the other leg is less than 1991. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse.Let the legs be (a) and (b), and the hypotenuse be (c). Assume (a = c - 1575) and (b &lt; 1991). Using the Pythagorean theorem:[a^2 + b^2 = c^2]Substituting (a = c - 1575):[(c - 1575)^2 + b^2 = c^2]Expanding and simplifying:[c^2 - 2 cdot 1575 cdot c + 1575^2 + b^2 = c^2][b^2 = 2 cdot 1575 cdot c - 1575^2]Factorizing 1575 as (3^2 times 5^2 times 7), we get:[b^2 = 1575 cdot (2c - 1575)]For (b^2) to be a perfect square, (7 cdot (2c - 1575)) must be a perfect square. Let (7 cdot (2c - 1575) = k^2), then (k = 7m) for integer (m):[2c - 1575 = 7m^2][2c = 7m^2 + 1575][c = frac{7m^2 + 1575}{2}]Since (c) must be an integer, (7m^2 + 1575) must be even, implying (m) is odd. Let (m = 2n + 1). Also, (b = 105m) (from (b^2 = 11025m^2)) and (b &lt; 1991):[105m &lt; 1991 implies m &lt; 18.96](m) must be an odd integer. Testing (m = 17) (the largest odd less than 18.96):[c = frac{7 cdot 17^2 + 1575}{2} = frac{2023 + 1575}{2} = frac{3598}{2} = 1799]Verifying (a = 1799 - 1575 = 224) and (b = 105 cdot 17 = 1785) (which is less than 1991):[224^2 + 1785^2 = 1799^2]Thus, the hypotenuse is (boxed{1799}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a right-angled triangle with all sides being positive integers. One of the legs is 1575 less than the hypotenuse, and the other leg is less than 1991. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse. Hmm, right. Let me break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s recall the Pythagorean theorem. In a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. Let me denote the legs as ( a ) and ( b ), and the hypotenuse as ( c ). So, we have ( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ).The problem states that one of the legs is 1575 less than the hypotenuse. Let&#39;s say that leg ( a ) is the one that&#39;s 1575 less than ( c ). So, ( a = c - 1575 ). The other leg ( b ) is less than 1991. So, ( b &lt; 1991 ).Our goal is to find the hypotenuse ( c ). Since all sides are positive integers, we need to find integer values of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) that satisfy these conditions.Let me substitute ( a = c - 1575 ) into the Pythagorean equation:( (c - 1575)^2 + b^2 = c^2 )Expanding the left side:( c^2 - 2 cdot 1575 cdot c + 1575^2 + b^2 = c^2 )Subtract ( c^2 ) from both sides:( -2 cdot 1575 cdot c + 1575^2 + b^2 = 0 )Let me rearrange that:( b^2 = 2 cdot 1575 cdot c - 1575^2 )So, ( b^2 = 1575(2c - 1575) )Hmm, since ( b ) is an integer, the right-hand side must be a perfect square. Therefore, ( 1575(2c - 1575) ) must be a perfect square. Let me factor 1575 to see if we can simplify this expression.1575. Let&#39;s divide by 25 first: 1575 ÷ 25 = 63. So, 1575 = 25 × 63. Now, 63 is 7 × 9, so 1575 = 25 × 7 × 9 = 5² × 3² × 7. So, 1575 = 5² × 3² × 7. Therefore, the prime factorization of 1575 is 3² × 5² × 7.Therefore, the equation ( b^2 = 1575(2c - 1575) ) becomes:( b^2 = 3² × 5² × 7 × (2c - 1575) )Since ( b^2 ) is a perfect square, the term ( 3² × 5² × 7 × (2c - 1575) ) must also be a perfect square. For this product to be a perfect square, the remaining factor ( (2c - 1575) ) must be a multiple of 7, such that when multiplied by the existing factors, all exponents in the prime factorization are even.Looking at the prime factors here: 3² × 5² × 7 × (2c - 1575). The exponents of 3 and 5 are already even (2), but the exponent of 7 is 1 (from 7¹). Therefore, to make the entire product a perfect square, ( 2c - 1575 ) must contribute another factor of 7, and whatever other prime factors it has must also have even exponents.So, ( 2c - 1575 ) must be a multiple of 7. Let me denote ( 2c - 1575 = 7k² ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. Wait, but why 7k²?Wait, let me think again. Let me denote ( 2c - 1575 = 7m² ), where ( m ) is an integer. Then, substituting back into the equation, we have:( b^2 = 3² × 5² × 7 × 7m² = 3² × 5² × 7² × m² )Therefore, ( b = 3 × 5 × 7 × m = 105m ). So, ( b = 105m ). Since ( b ) is less than 1991, we have:( 105m &lt; 1991 )Dividing both sides by 105:( m &lt; 1991 / 105 approx 18.96 )So, ( m ) must be less than approximately 18.96. Since ( m ) is a positive integer, ( m leq 18 ).Therefore, possible values of ( m ) are 1, 2, 3, ..., 18.But let&#39;s check if this substitution is correct. Wait, if ( 2c - 1575 = 7m² ), then:( 2c = 7m² + 1575 )( c = (7m² + 1575)/2 )Since ( c ) must be an integer, ( 7m² + 1575 ) must be even. Let&#39;s check the parity.1575 is odd (since 1500 is even, 75 is odd, so 1575 is even + odd = odd). 7m²: if m is even, 7m² is even; if m is odd, 7m² is odd.So, 7m² + 1575 is even if:- If m is even: even + odd = odd. Not even.- If m is odd: odd + odd = even. So, only when m is odd, ( 7m² + 1575 ) is even. Therefore, m must be odd.So, m can be 1, 3, 5, ..., 17. That is, the odd integers from 1 up to 17.Therefore, possible values of m are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. Let&#39;s note these down.Now, for each of these m values, we can compute c and check if a = c - 1575 is positive, and if all sides are integers. Also, need to ensure that ( b = 105m &lt; 1991 ).But since m ≤ 17, then ( b = 105 × 17 = 1785 ), which is less than 1991. So all m from 1 to 17 (odd) would satisfy ( b &lt; 1991 ).So, now, let&#39;s compute c for each m:For m = 1:c = (7×1 + 1575)/2 = (7 + 1575)/2 = 1582/2 = 791Wait, hold on, m². Wait, m². Wait, original equation:c = (7m² + 1575)/2So for m=1:c = (7×1 + 1575)/2 = (7 + 1575)/2 = 1582/2 = 791Then, a = c - 1575 = 791 - 1575 = -784. Wait, that&#39;s negative. But sides are positive integers, so discard m=1.Similarly, for m=3:c = (7×9 + 1575)/2 = (63 + 1575)/2 = 1638/2 = 819a = 819 - 1575 = -756. Still negative. Not valid.m=5:c = (7×25 + 1575)/2 = (175 + 1575)/2 = 1750/2 = 875a = 875 - 1575 = -700. Negative. Not valid.m=7:c = (7×49 + 1575)/2 = (343 + 1575)/2 = 1918/2 = 959a = 959 - 1575 = -616. Negative. Not valid.m=9:c = (7×81 + 1575)/2 = (567 + 1575)/2 = 2142/2 = 1071a = 1071 - 1575 = -504. Negative. Not valid.m=11:c = (7×121 + 1575)/2 = (847 + 1575)/2 = 2422/2 = 1211a = 1211 - 1575 = -364. Negative.m=13:c = (7×169 + 1575)/2 = (1183 + 1575)/2 = 2758/2 = 1379a = 1379 - 1575 = -196. Negative.m=15:c = (7×225 + 1575)/2 = (1575 + 1575)/2 = 3150/2 = 1575a = 1575 - 1575 = 0. But a leg can&#39;t be zero. So invalid.m=17:c = (7×289 + 1575)/2 = (2023 + 1575)/2 = 3598/2 = 1799a = 1799 - 1575 = 224. Positive. So this is valid.So, with m=17, we get:c = 1799a = 224b = 105×17 = 1785Check if 224² + 1785² = 1799².Let me compute each term.First, 224²: 224 × 224. Let&#39;s compute 200²=40000, 24²=576, and cross term 2×200×24=9600. So, (200 + 24)² = 200² + 2×200×24 +24² = 40000 + 9600 + 576 = 40000 + 9600 = 49600 + 576 = 50176.So, 224² = 50176.1785²: Let&#39;s compute this. 1785 is 1700 + 85. So, (1700 + 85)² = 1700² + 2×1700×85 + 85².1700² = (17²)×(100²) = 289×10000 = 2,890,000.2×1700×85 = 2×1700×85 = 3400×85. Let&#39;s compute 3400×80 = 272,000 and 3400×5 = 17,000. So total is 272,000 +17,000 = 289,000.85² = 7,225.So, 1700² + 2×1700×85 +85² = 2,890,000 + 289,000 +7,225 = 2,890,000 + 289,000 = 3,179,000 +7,225 = 3,186,225.Therefore, 1785² = 3,186,225.Sum of squares: 50176 + 3,186,225 = 3,236,401.Now, check 1799²:1799 is 1800 -1. So, (1800 -1)² = 1800² - 2×1800×1 +1² = 3,240,000 - 3,600 +1 = 3,236,401.Yes, that&#39;s correct. So 224² + 1785² = 1799². So, that works.So, m=17 gives us a valid solution with c=1799, a=224, b=1785, which is less than 1991 (1785 &lt; 1991). Also, the other leg a=224 is positive. So, this is a valid solution.But wait, we need to check if there are other possible solutions. Wait, m=17 is the largest possible m (since m=18 is even, but m must be odd up to 17). Wait, but when m=17, b=1785 which is less than 1991, so that&#39;s okay. When m=19, which is beyond 18.96, but since m is only up to 17, there are no higher m values.But wait, earlier, when m was from 1 to 17 (odd), all gave negative a except m=17. So, m=17 is the only valid solution. Therefore, the hypotenuse is 1799.Wait, but let me check again if there are other possible representations. Maybe the initial assumption that a = c - 1575 is correct, but perhaps the other leg is c - 1575. Wait, the problem states &quot;one of the legs is 1575 less than the hypotenuse&quot;. So, it could be either leg a or leg b. But in my approach, I assumed it was leg a. But maybe I need to check both cases.Wait, the problem says &quot;one of the legs is 1575 less than the hypotenuse&quot;. So, it could be either leg. So, perhaps I need to check both possibilities: either a = c - 1575 or b = c - 1575.In my previous analysis, I considered a = c - 1575. But maybe the other leg is c - 1575, so b = c - 1575. So, let&#39;s check that case as well.So, if we suppose b = c - 1575. Then, similar steps would follow.So, let&#39;s let b = c - 1575. Then, substituting into Pythagoras:( a^2 + (c - 1575)^2 = c^2 )Which leads to:( a^2 = 2 cdot 1575 cdot c - 1575^2 )Same as before. So, ( a^2 = 1575(2c - 1575) ). Therefore, the equation is the same, just swapping a and b. So, in this case, a would be 105m, and b = c - 1575.But since the problem states that &quot;the other leg is less than 1991&quot;, so if we assume that the leg which is 1575 less is b, then the other leg a must be less than 1991. Wait, but in our previous case, when we had a = c - 1575, then the other leg b had to be less than 1991. But here, if b = c - 1575, then the other leg a would need to be less than 1991.So, let&#39;s see. So, if we let b = c - 1575, then the other leg a = 105m, and we have a &lt; 1991. So, 105m &lt; 1991, so m &lt; ~18.96, same as before. So, m can be 1 to 18. But since c must be an integer, similar to before, when we set ( 2c = 7m² + 1575 ), so again, m must be odd.But in this case, the leg a = 105m, so a must be less than 1991. So, same as before, m ≤18, but m must be odd, so same m=1,3,...,17.But then, in this case, c = (7m² + 1575)/2. Then, b = c - 1575 = (7m² + 1575)/2 - 1575 = (7m² + 1575 - 3150)/2 = (7m² - 1575)/2.But b must be positive. So, 7m² - 1575 &gt; 0 =&gt; 7m² &gt; 1575 =&gt; m² &gt; 1575/7 =&gt; m² &gt; 225 =&gt; m &gt; 15.Therefore, m must satisfy m &gt; 15. Since m is odd and m ≤17, then m=17.So, again, m=17. Therefore, c = (7×289 + 1575)/2 = (2023 + 1575)/2 = 3598/2 = 1799. Then, b = 1799 - 1575 = 224. a = 105×17 = 1785. But in this case, the leg a=1785 &lt; 1991, which satisfies the condition.Wait, so in this scenario, we have a=1785, b=224, c=1799. So, the leg that is 1575 less is b=224 = 1799 - 1575, which is correct, and the other leg a=1785 is less than 1991. So, this also satisfies the problem&#39;s conditions. Therefore, regardless of which leg we take as being 1575 less, the hypotenuse is the same: 1799. Therefore, the answer is 1799.So, even when we considered both cases (either a or b being the leg that is 1575 less), the only valid solution is when m=17, leading to hypotenuse c=1799. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 1799.Therefore, the answer is boxed{1799}Final Answerboxed{1799}&lt;/think&gt;Given a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths, one of the legs is 1575 less than the hypotenuse, and the other leg is less than 1991. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse.Let the legs be (a) and (b), and the hypotenuse be (c). Without loss of generality, assume one leg (a = c - 1575). Using the Pythagorean theorem:[a^2 + b^2 = c^2]Substituting (a = c - 1575):[(c - 1575)^2 + b^2 = c^2]Expanding and simplifying:[c^2 - 2 cdot 1575 cdot c + 1575^2 + b^2 = c^2][b^2 = 2 cdot 1575 cdot c - 1575^2][b^2 = 1575(2c - 1575)]Since (b) must be an integer, (1575(2c - 1575)) must be a perfect square. The prime factorization of 1575 is (3^2 times 5^2 times 7). For (1575(2c - 1575)) to be a perfect square, (2c - 1575) must be a multiple of 7. Let (2c - 1575 = 7k^2) for some integer (k):[2c = 7k^2 + 1575][c = frac{7k^2 + 1575}{2}]For (c) to be an integer, (7k^2 + 1575) must be even. Since 1575 is odd, (k) must be odd. Let (k = 2m + 1) (odd). However, we can directly consider (k) as an odd integer.

The problem is set up as an addition problem:    E L+ M E M------- Q E DAnd the goal is to find the maximum possible value of the three-digit integer QED. The digits D, E, L, M, Q are all distinct, which is important. Let me think step by step.First, let me write down the addition vertically to visualize it better:    E L+ M E M-------- Q E DSo, when we add the two numbers, the rightmost digits (units place) are L + M. This sum should give us D in the units place, possibly with a carryover to the tens place. Then, the next column (tens place) is E + E plus any carryover from the units place, which should give us E in the tens place. Finally, the hundreds place is M plus any carryover from the tens place, resulting in Q.Let me denote the possible carryovers as c1 (from units to tens) and c2 (from tens to hundreds). So:1. Units place: L + M = D + 10*c12. Tens place: E + E + c1 = E + 10*c23. Hundreds place: M + c2 = Q + 10*c3 (but since the result is a three-digit number, there can&#39;t be a carryover beyond the hundreds place, so c3 must be 0. Therefore, Q = M + c2)Now, let&#39;s analyze each equation step by step.Starting with the tens place equation: E + E + c1 = E + 10*c2. Simplifying this, subtract E from both sides:E + c1 = 10*c2So E + c1 must be a multiple of 10. Since E is a digit between 0-9, and c1 can be either 0 or 1 (because the maximum sum in the units place would be 9 + 9 = 18, so c1 can be 1 at maximum). Let&#39;s note possible scenarios.Case 1: c1 = 0. Then E = 10*c2. But E is a digit, so 10*c2 must be between 0-9. This implies c2 = 0, so E = 0. But if E = 0, then in the tens place, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which would mean there&#39;s no carryover, which is okay, but we need to check if E can be 0.Case 2: c1 = 1. Then E + 1 = 10*c2. Now, E must be a digit between 0-9, and c2 can be 0 or 1 (since the maximum sum in the tens place would be 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, so c2 could be 1 at maximum). So, E + 1 = 10*c2. Since E is a digit, c2 can only be 1, because if c2=0, then E = -1 which is invalid. Therefore, c2=1, leading to E + 1 = 10*1 =&gt; E = 9.So, the tens place gives us two possibilities:Either E = 0 with c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, or E = 9 with c1 = 1 and c2 = 1.Now, let&#39;s explore each case.Case 1: E = 0, c1 = 0, c2 = 0If E = 0, then looking at the units place:L + M = D (since c1 = 0). Also, since all digits are distinct, D must be different from E=0, L, M.Then, in the hundreds place: M + c2 = M + 0 = Q. So Q = M. But Q and M have to be distinct digits, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Case 1 is invalid.Thus, we must have Case 2.Case 2: E = 9, c1 = 1, c2 = 1So E is 9. Now, let&#39;s process the other equations.First, the units place: L + M = D + 10*1 =&gt; L + M = D + 10. So L + M must be at least 10 (since D is a digit between 0-9). Therefore, D = (L + M) - 10. Since D is a digit, (L + M) must be between 10 and 19.Also, D must be distinct from E=9, L, M, Q.In the hundreds place: Q = M + c2 = M + 1. So Q = M + 1. Therefore, Q and M are consecutive digits, with Q &gt; M. Also, Q must be distinct from E=9, D, L, M.Our goal is to maximize QED, which is a three-digit number with hundreds digit Q, tens digit E=9, and units digit D. Since E is fixed at 9, to maximize QED, we need to maximize Q first, then D.Since Q = M + 1, to maximize Q, we need to maximize M. The maximum possible value for M is 8, because if M=8, then Q=9. But E is already 9, and digits must be distinct. Therefore, Q cannot be 9. So M cannot be 8. Then next is M=7, so Q=8. Then Q=8 is acceptable as long as 8 is not already used.So let&#39;s test possible values of M starting from the highest possible, such that Q = M + 1 is not equal to E=9 and other digits.Let&#39;s list possible M values in descending order:M=7 ⇒ Q=8M=6 ⇒ Q=7M=5 ⇒ Q=6M=4 ⇒ Q=5M=3 ⇒ Q=4M=2 ⇒ Q=3M=1 ⇒ Q=2M=0 ⇒ Q=1 (But M=0 would make Q=1. However, M=0 is allowed unless 0 is already used. E=9, so 0 is available unless used elsewhere. However, in the units place, D is (L + M) - 10. If M=0, then D = L - 10. But L is a digit between 0-9, so D would be negative, which is invalid. Therefore, M cannot be 0. So M must be at least 1.Wait, but if M=0, then L + 0 = D + 10 ⇒ L = D + 10. Since L is a digit (0-9), L must be at most 9, so D + 10 ≤ 9 ⇒ D ≤ -1, which is impossible. Therefore, M must be at least 1.So possible M values starting from 7 down to 1.Let me check M=7 first (Q=8). Then Q=8, which is distinct from E=9. Then we need to check whether we can assign digits L and D such that L + 7 = D + 10 ⇒ L = D + 3. Also, D must be distinct from E=9, M=7, Q=8, and L.Moreover, all digits D, L must be unique and between 0-9.Given that L = D + 3, D must be at least 0, so L is at least 3. Also, L cannot exceed 9, so D must be at most 6 (since D + 3 ≤ 9 ⇒ D ≤ 6). Therefore, D can be 0 to 6, and L would be 3 to 9. But we need to ensure that D and L are not equal to E=9, M=7, Q=8, or each other.So possible D values: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. But D must not be 7,8,9. So that&#39;s okay.But D must also be different from L. Since L = D + 3, D ≠ L ⇒ D ≠ D + 3 ⇒ 0 ≠ 3, which is true as long as D is valid. So no problem here.But D must also be distinct from E=9, M=7, Q=8, and L must be distinct from E=9, M=7, Q=8, and L = D + 3.So let&#39;s try to maximize D first because we want the maximum QED. Since Q is fixed at 8 (if M=7), E=9, so QED is 8 9 D. So to maximize QED, D should be as large as possible. So starting with D=6:If D=6, then L=6 + 3 =9. But E is already 9, so L=9 is invalid. Next D=5, L=5+3=8. Q is 8, so L=8 would conflict with Q=8. D=4, L=4+3=7. But M=7, so L=7 conflicts with M=7. D=3, L=6. 3 and 6: check if they are distinct from existing digits: E=9, M=7, Q=8. 3 and 6 are new. So D=3, L=6. Then D=3 is distinct from E=9, M=7, Q=8, L=6. L=6 is distinct from the others. So this works. Then D=3, L=6.So for M=7, Q=8, E=9, D=3, L=6. Then the digits used are D=3, E=9, L=6, M=7, Q=8. All distinct. So QED would be 893. Let&#39;s check if the addition works:   9 6+ 7 9 7-------- 8 9 3Calculating 96 + 797. Let&#39;s add: 96 + 797. 96 + 700 = 796, 796 + 90 = 886, 886 + 7 = 893. Yes, that works. So QED=893.But maybe there&#39;s a higher QED? Let&#39;s check if M=7 is the maximum possible.Wait, if M=7 gives Q=8, but what if we can get Q=9? But E=9, so Q=9 is invalid because Q must be distinct. So Q can&#39;t be 9. So the next is Q=8. So M=7 is the maximum M possible. Therefore, Q=8 is the maximum possible Q. Then, with Q=8, we need to find the maximum D possible. In the case above, D=3. But maybe if we can find a higher D with M=7.Wait, when we tried D=6, L=9 which is conflicting with E=9. D=5, L=8 conflicting with Q=8. D=4, L=7 conflicting with M=7. D=3, L=6 is okay. So D=3 is the maximum possible with M=7. But perhaps, is there another way with M=7? Let me think.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s another combination where L and M=7 sum to D + 10, but D is higher? For example, if L is 9, but E is already 9, so L can&#39;t be 9. If L is 8, but Q is 8. If L is 7, but M is 7. So the next is L=6, which gives D=3. So no, that seems forced. Therefore, QED=893 with M=7, D=3, L=6.But let&#39;s check other M values. Maybe a lower M can result in a higher QED? For example, if M=6, Q=7. Then QED would be 79D, which is lower than 89D. So even if D is higher, 79D is less than 893. Similarly, M=5 gives Q=6, QED=69D, which is even lower. Therefore, M=7 seems the best.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check M=6. If M=6, then Q=7 (since Q = M + 1). Now, in the units place, L + 6 = D + 10 ⇒ L = D + 4.Again, D must be between 0-5 (since L = D + 4 ≤9 ⇒ D ≤5). Let&#39;s try to maximize D. D=5: L=9. E=9 is already taken, so L=9 is invalid. D=4: L=8. 8 is available (since Q=7, M=6, E=9). So L=8, D=4. Check if all digits are distinct: D=4, E=9, L=8, M=6, Q=7. Yes, all unique. Then QED=794. But 794 is less than 893, so not better.Alternatively, D=3: L=7. Q=7 is already taken, so L=7 conflicts with Q=7. Wait, Q=7, so L=7 is invalid. D=2: L=6. M=6, so L=6 conflicts with M=6. D=1: L=5. All distinct? D=1, E=9, L=5, M=6, Q=7. Yes. QED=791. Still less than 893. D=0: L=4. QED=790. So M=6 gives maximum QED=794, which is lower.Similarly, M=5: Q=6. Units place L + 5 = D +10 ⇒ L = D +5. D can be up to 4 (since L=9 ⇒ D=4). D=4: L=9. E=9, conflict. D=3: L=8. All digits: D=3, E=9, L=8, M=5, Q=6. QED=693. If D=2, L=7. QED=692. All lower. So not useful.M=4: Q=5. Units place L +4 = D +10 ⇒ L = D +6. D can be up to 3 (L=9 ⇒ D=3). D=3: L=9. E=9, conflict. D=2: L=8. QED=592. Etc. Even lower.So M=7 gives the highest QED=893. But wait, let me confirm if there&#39;s another scenario where even if Q is lower, but D is higher, leading to a higher QED? For example, Q=8, D=9. But D can&#39;t be 9 because E=9. So D is maximum 8, but Q=8, so D can&#39;t be 8. So D maximum is 7? Wait, but in the previous case, D=3. Maybe there&#39;s another way with different carries.Wait, but in the tens place, we already determined that E=9 and c1=1. So that equation is fixed. So the carryover from the units place is 1. Then in the hundreds place, M + 1 = Q. So Q = M +1. Therefore, the only way to get a higher Q is to have a higher M. Since M is maximum 7 (as M=8 would lead Q=9, which is E&#39;s digit), M=7 is the maximum, leading to Q=8. So that seems set.But wait, perhaps there&#39;s a different way to interpret the problem? Let me check again.The problem is:   E L+ M E M--------  Q E DSo it&#39;s a 2-digit number plus a 3-digit number, resulting in a 3-digit number. The alignment is such that:- The units place of the first number (L) is added to the units place of the second number (M), giving D with a possible carryover.- The tens place of the first number (E) is added to the tens place of the second number (E) plus any carryover, giving E in the tens place.- The hundreds place of the second number (M) plus any carryover gives Q in the hundreds place.So the equations are correct as per the original analysis.Another check: Let&#39;s consider if there could be a carryover from hundreds place, but since the result is a three-digit number, adding a two-digit and a three-digit number can at most result in a three-digit number (if there is a carryover, it would make it a four-digit number, but here it&#39;s given as three-digit). Wait, actually, hold on. Adding a two-digit number (EL) which is maximum 99 and a three-digit number (MEM) which is maximum 999. So 99 + 999 = 1098, which is a four-digit number. However, the problem states the result is a three-digit number QED. Therefore, there must be a carryover from the hundreds place addition, but since it&#39;s a three-digit number, the total sum must be less than 1000. Therefore, M (the hundreds digit of MEM) plus any carryover from the tens place must be less than 10. Because EL is a two-digit number, so adding to a three-digit number, the maximum sum is 99 + 999 = 1098, but the result here is QED, a three-digit number, which is less than 1000. Therefore, the sum must be less than 1000, so M + c2 &lt; 10. Because the hundreds place sum is M (from MEM) plus any carryover from the tens place (c2). Therefore, M + c2 &lt; 10.But in our previous analysis, in Case 2 where c2=1, Q = M + 1. Therefore, Q must be less than 10. Which is already considered. But also, M + 1 &lt; 10 ⇒ M &lt;=8. But M=8 would make Q=9, which is E=9, conflict. Therefore, M can be at most 7. Which we had already considered. So that checks out.Therefore, our previous reasoning is correct. Therefore, the maximum QED is 893.But let&#39;s check once more if there&#39;s another possibility where M=7, but D is higher. Wait, when M=7, L = D +3. So D must be 3 to have L=6 (as higher D would lead to L=9,8,7 which are conflicting). So D=3 is the maximum possible. But let me check if there are other possibilities with different assignments. For example, maybe there&#39;s a different carryover?Wait, in the units place: L + M = D + 10*c1. We already have c1=1 in Case 2. So L + M = D + 10. Since L and M are digits, L + M can be from 10 to 18 (since the maximum L and M can be 9 each, but they are distinct). Therefore, D can be from (10 -10)=0 to (18 -10)=8. But D cannot be 9 (since E=9), and D must be distinct from E=9, L, M, Q.But in the case of M=7, L +7 = D +10. So D = L -3. Wait, no: L +7 = D +10 ⇒ D = L +7 -10 = L -3. Wait, but earlier I wrote L = D +3, which is equivalent. So D = L -3. Therefore, L must be at least 3 to have D non-negative. So D can be 0 (if L=3), up to 6 (if L=9). But L=9 would give D=6. However, L=9 is allowed if D=6. Wait, wait, let me recast this.Wait, D = L + M -10 (since L + M = D + 10*c1, c1=1). So D = L + M -10. If M=7, then D = L +7 -10 = L -3. So L must be at least 3 to have D &gt;=0. So L can be 3 to 9, resulting in D=0 to 6. However, D must be unique, not equal to E=9, L, M=7, Q=8.If L=9, then D=9 -3=6. But E=9, so L=9 would conflict with E=9. So L cannot be 9. If L=8, D=8 -3=5. Q=8, so L=8 conflicts with Q=8. If L=7, D=7 -3=4. M=7, so L=7 conflicts with M=7. If L=6, D=6 -3=3. This is the case we had before. Then L=5, D=2. L=4, D=1. L=3, D=0. So other possibilities with M=7:For example, L=5, D=2. Then digits would be D=2, E=9, L=5, M=7, Q=8. All distinct. Then QED=892. Which is less than 893. Similarly, L=4, D=1: QED=891. L=3, D=0: QED=890. So the maximum with M=7 is 893.Alternatively, if L=6, D=3, which gives QED=893. So that&#39;s the highest. Therefore, 893 is the maximum possible QED.But let me check another angle. Suppose we consider that in the units place, L + M could be 10 or 11 or up, but given that c1=1, so L + M must be exactly 10 + D. So if we want D to be as large as possible, we need L + M to be as large as possible. Since D = L + M -10. Therefore, to maximize D, we need to maximize L + M. Since L and M are digits, maximum L + M = 9 + 8 =17 (since 9+9=18 but digits must be distinct). Wait, but M=7 in our previous case, L=6, sum 13, D=3. If M=7, maximum L + M would be 7 +9=16 (but L=9 conflicts with E=9). Next is L=8, but Q=8. L=7 conflicts with M=7. L=6 is the highest possible. So sum 13, D=3. Alternatively, if M=6, L=9 (but E=9). So no. If M=5, L=9: D=5 +9 -10=4. But M=5, Q=6. QED=694. Which is lower.Alternatively, if M=8, but then Q=9, which conflicts with E=9. So no. So, in all cases, 893 seems the maximum.Wait, let&#39;s check another possibility. If M=7, but different L and D where D is higher. For example, can we have D=7? Then L +7 = D +10 ⇒ L = D +3 =7 +3=10. But L must be a digit, so invalid. Similarly, D=8: L=8 +3=11, invalid. D=9: L=12, invalid. So impossible. Thus, D=6 is the maximum possible. But in our case, L=9 would be needed for D=6, but L=9 conflicts with E=9. Therefore, D=6 is not possible. Then D=5 would require L=8, which conflicts with Q=8. D=4 requires L=7, conflicting with M=7. So D=3 is indeed the maximum possible. Hence, 893 is the maximum QED.Therefore, the answer should be 893, so boxed{893}.Final Answerboxed{893}&lt;/think&gt;Given the cryptarithmetic puzzle:[begin{array}{c@{,}c@{,}c@{,}c}  &amp;   &amp; E &amp; L + &amp; M &amp; E &amp; M  hline  &amp; Q &amp; E &amp; D end{array}]we need to find the maximum possible value of the three-digit integer (QED) where (D, E, L, M, Q) are distinct digits.1. Analyzing the Tens Place:   - The equation for the tens place is (E + E + c_1 = E + 10c_2), which simplifies to (E + c_1 = 10c_2).   - This implies (E = 9) and (c_1 = 1) (since (E) must be a digit and (c_1, c_2) are carryovers, which can only be 0 or 1).2. Analyzing the Units Place:   - The equation is (L + M = D + 10). Therefore, (D = L + M - 10).3. Analyzing the Hundreds Place:   - The equation is (M + c_2 = Q). Since (c_2 = 1), we have (Q = M + 1).4. Maximizing (Q):   - To maximize (Q), we choose the largest possible (M) such that (Q = M + 1) does not conflict with (E = 9). The maximum (M) is 7, leading to (Q = 8).5. Determining (D) and (L):   - For (M = 7), the equation (D = L + 7 - 10) simplifies to (L = D + 3).   - To maximize (D), we test values starting from the highest possible digit. The valid combination is (D = 3) and (L = 6) (since higher values conflict with existing digits).6. Verification:   - The digits (D = 3), (E = 9), (L = 6), (M = 7), and (Q = 8) are all distinct.   - The addition (96 + 797 = 893) confirms the solution.Thus, the maximum possible value of (QED) is (boxed{893}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this cryptarithmetic puzzle. The problem is:If distinct digits D, E, L, M, Q (each between 0 and 9 inclusive) satisfy the addition:   E L+ M E M---------Q E DWhat is the maximum possible value of the three-digit integer QED?First, let&#39;s make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vertical addition here. The rightmost digits (units place) are L + M, which should result in D (with a possible carryover). The middle digits (tens place) are E + E, which should result in E again (with a possible carryover from the units place). The leftmost digits (hundreds place) are the carryover from the tens place plus M, which should result in Q (since there&#39;s nothing above the M in the top number). All digits D, E, L, M, Q are distinct, and we need to find the maximum possible value of QED.Our goal is to maximize QED, which is a three-digit number with hundreds digit Q, tens digit E, and units digit D. So, to maximize QED, we want Q as large as possible, then E as large as possible, and then D as large as possible, given the constraints.Let me start by analyzing the columns from right to left, as we usually do in addition problems.Units Column (Rightmost): L + M = D or L + M = D + 10 (if there&#39;s a carryover)Since L and M are digits (0-9), their sum can be between 0+0=0 and 9+9=18. However, since all digits must be distinct, L and M cannot be the same. Also, D must be a single digit, so if there&#39;s a carryover, L + M would be D + 10. Let&#39;s note that possibility.Tens Column (Middle): E + E + carryover from units = E + 10 * carryover to hundredsWait, the middle column is E (from the top number) plus E (from the middle number&#39;s tens place) plus any carryover from the units column. The result is E in the tens place of the sum, which is QED. So:E + E + carryover_from_units = E + 10 * carryover_to_hundredsSimplifying this:2E + carryover_from_units = E + 10 * carryover_to_hundredsSubtract E from both sides:E + carryover_from_units = 10 * carryover_to_hundredsSo, E + carryover_from_units must be a multiple of 10. Since carryover_from_units can be 0 or 1 (because the maximum sum in the units column is 9 + 9 = 18, so carryover can be 0 or 1), then E must be either 0 or 9. Wait, let&#39;s think:If carryover_from_units is 0, then E + 0 = 10 * carryover_to_hundreds. But E is a digit (0-9), so 10 * carryover_to_hundreds must be 0 or 10. If it&#39;s 0, E must be 0. If it&#39;s 10, E must be 10, which is impossible. Therefore, if carryover_from_units is 0, E must be 0, but carryover_to_hundreds would also be 0.If carryover_from_units is 1, then E + 1 = 10 * carryover_to_hundreds. Since carryover_to_hundreds must be an integer (0 or 1, because the maximum sum in the tens column is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, but in our case, the tens column is 2E + 1. So, 2E + 1 can be at most 2*9 + 1 = 19, which would mean carryover_to_hundreds is 1. So, E + 1 must be 10 * 1 (since carryover_to_hundreds can&#39;t be 2, as 2E + 1 &lt;=19, so carryover_to_hundreds is at most 1). Therefore, E + 1 = 10 * 1 =&gt; E = 9.Therefore, the only possible values for E are 0 or 9. However, E cannot be 0 if carryover_from_units is 1, because E + 1 = 10 * carryover_to_hundreds, which would require E = 9. So, two cases:Case 1: carryover_from_units = 0, then E = 0, and carryover_to_hundreds = 0.Case 2: carryover_from_units = 1, then E + 1 = 10 * carryover_to_hundreds. Since carryover_to_hundreds can be 0 or 1. If carryover_to_hundreds is 1, then E + 1 = 10, so E = 9. If carryover_to_hundreds is 0, then E + 1 = 0, which is impossible since E is a digit. Therefore, only possible when carryover_to_hundreds is 1, leading to E = 9.So, E is either 0 or 9.But E = 0 would be in Case 1 where there&#39;s no carryover from the units column. Let&#39;s see:If E = 0, then in the tens column: 0 + 0 + carryover_from_units = 0 + 10 * carryover_to_hundreds. Therefore, carryover_from_units must be 0 (since 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which gives carryover_to_hundreds = 0). But then, in the units column, L + M = D. Since E = 0, D must be different from E, so D ≠ 0. Also, L and M can&#39;t be 0 because E is already 0? Wait, E is 0, but L and M could be 0 only if allowed. Wait, the digits D, E, L, M, Q must be distinct. So, if E = 0, then 0 is already used, so D, L, M, Q must be distinct from each other and from 0.But in the units column, L + M = D. If E = 0, then let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s explore both cases.First, let&#39;s consider Case 1: E = 0.Case 1: E = 0.Then, in the tens column, 0 + 0 + carryover_from_units = 0 + 10 * carryover_to_hundreds. So, carryover_from_units must be 0, so carryover_to_hundreds is 0. Therefore, L + M = D (no carryover). Also, in the hundreds column: carryover_to_hundreds (which is 0) + M = Q. So, M = Q. But M and Q must be distinct digits. Contradiction. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible. Therefore, E cannot be 0. So, the only possibility is Case 2: E = 9.Therefore, E must be 9. Let&#39;s proceed with that.Case 2: E = 9.From the tens column analysis:E + carryover_from_units = 10 * carryover_to_hundreds9 + carryover_from_units = 10 * carryover_to_hundredsPossible values:carryover_from_units can be 0 or 1.If carryover_from_units = 1:9 + 1 = 10 = 10 * 1 → carryover_to_hundreds = 1.If carryover_from_units = 0:9 + 0 = 9 = 10 * carryover_to_hundreds → which would require carryover_to_hundreds = 0.9, which is impossible. Therefore, only possible if carryover_from_units = 1, leading to carryover_to_hundreds = 1. Therefore:carryover_from_units = 1, so in the units column: L + M = D + 10 (since there&#39;s a carryover of 1 to the tens column).In the hundreds column: carryover_to_hundreds (which is 1) + M = Q. So, 1 + M = Q.Thus, Q = M + 1.So, we have:1. E = 9.2. In units place: L + M = D + 10.3. In hundreds place: Q = M + 1.4. All digits D, E=9, L, M, Q are distinct.Our goal is to maximize QED, which is Q (hundreds), E=9 (tens), D (units). So, to maximize QED, we need the highest possible Q and D. Since Q = M + 1, to maximize Q, we need M as large as possible. But Q must be a digit (0-9). Since M is a digit, maximum M can be is 8, making Q = 9. But E is already 9, and digits must be distinct. Therefore, Q cannot be 9, so maximum M is 8 would give Q=9, but that&#39;s already taken by E. Therefore, the maximum M can be is 7, making Q=8. Let&#39;s check.But wait, perhaps M can be 8 if Q=9, but Q=9 is already E, which is 9. So, no, since Q and E must be distinct. Therefore, Q must be different from E=9. Therefore, M cannot be 8, since that would make Q=9. So, the maximum possible M is 7, leading to Q=8. Then, D is determined by L + M = D + 10. So, D = L + M - 10.We need D to be a distinct digit, different from E=9, Q=8, M, and L. Also, L and M must be distinct digits as well.So, to maximize QED, we need Q as high as possible. So let&#39;s try Q=8. Then, M=7 (since Q = M +1). Then, D = L + M -10 = L +7 -10 = L -3. So, D = L -3.But D must be a digit between 0 and 9. Since L is a digit, L must be at least 3 (so that D ≥ 0). Also, D must be different from E=9, Q=8, M=7, and L.Moreover, L must be different from E=9, M=7, Q=8, and D. Since D = L -3, L must be such that D is a digit and distinct.So, possible L values: 3 to 9, but L cannot be 7 (since M=7), 8 (Q=8), 9 (E=9). So L can be 3,4,5,6.Thus, possible L and D:If L=6: D=6-3=3. Check if 3 is available: Q=8, E=9, M=7, L=6. So digits used: 8,9,7,6. D=3, which is distinct. So possible. Then D=3.If L=5: D=5-3=2. Check: 8,9,7,5. D=2. All distinct. Okay.If L=4: D=4-3=1. All distinct. Okay.If L=3: D=3-3=0. Check if D=0 is allowed. Since E=9, which is distinct. Q=8, M=7, L=3. So digits used: 8,9,7,3. D=0. 0 is allowed if it&#39;s not already used. Since D=0, which is distinct from others. So possible.So, with Q=8, M=7, the maximum D is 3 (when L=6). Then QED would be 8 9 3. But maybe there&#39;s a higher QED with a lower Q but higher D?Wait, maybe if Q is less than 8, but D is higher? Let&#39;s see. For example, if Q=7, then M=6 (since Q = M+1). Then D = L + 6 -10 = L -4. To get D as high as possible, L needs to be as high as possible. L can be 9, but E=9 is already taken. So L can be up to 8, but Q=7, M=6. L cannot be 7 or 6. So L can be 5,4,3,2,1,0? Wait, D = L -4. So L must be at least 4 to have D ≥0. So L=4: D=0; L=5: D=1; L=8: D=4. Wait, L=8 is possible? Q=7, M=6. L=8 is not used. Then D=8 -4=4. So D=4. So QED would be 7 9 4. Which is less than 8 9 3. Wait, 794 is less than 893. So no, higher Q is better.Alternatively, if Q=8, M=7, D=3 (from L=6), then QED=893. If we can get a higher D with Q=8, that would be better. But with Q=8, M=7, D is determined by L=6, D=3. If we try a different M where Q is still 8, but perhaps higher D. Wait, but Q=8 requires M=7. If we want Q=8, M must be 7. So the only way. Therefore, in this case, QED=893 with D=3.But maybe there&#39;s another scenario where M is lower, but D is higher. Let&#39;s check.Suppose Q=7, which means M=6. Then D = L +6 -10 = L -4. To get higher D, L has to be higher. The maximum possible L here would be L=8 (since E=9, Q=7, M=6; L cannot be 9,7,6). So L=8: D=8-4=4. Then QED=794. Which is lower than 893.If Q=6, then M=5. D = L +5 -10 = L -5. To have D ≥0, L ≥5. But L can&#39;t be 5 (M=5), 6 (Q=6), 9 (E=9). So possible L=7,8. Then D=7-5=2 or 8-5=3. So QED=692 or 693. Still lower than 893.Similarly, Q=5: M=4. D = L +4 -10. L needs to be at least 6. L=6: D=0; L=7: D=1; L=8: D=2. QED=590, 591, 592. Not better.Alternatively, maybe even if Q is lower, but D is higher. But since Q is the hundreds digit, maximizing Q is the most impactful. So 893 is better than lower Q with higher D.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another possibility when E=9, Q is not M+1. Wait, no, because from the hundreds column: carryover_to_hundreds is 1 (from the tens column calculation), so 1 + M = Q. So Q must be M+1. Therefore, Q is determined once M is chosen. So Q can&#39;t be anything else.Therefore, to get the maximum QED, we need the maximum possible Q, which requires the maximum possible M such that Q = M +1 is distinct from E=9 and other digits.So M can be up to 7 (Q=8). Then, as above, D is L + M -10. To maximize D, with M=7, we need L as large as possible. The maximum L can be is 6 (since L can&#39;t be 7 (M=7), 8 (Q=8), 9 (E=9)). So L=6 gives D=6 +7 -10=3. Then QED=8 9 3=893.But wait, is there a way to get a higher D? Let&#39;s think.If we can have M=7, Q=8, and D=9, but E is already 9. So D can&#39;t be 9. So maximum D can be 8, but Q is 8. So D can&#39;t be 8 either. So the next is 7, but M=7. So D can&#39;t be 7. Then 6. But L=6, which is allowed. Wait, D=3 here. Hmm.Alternatively, is there a different way of interpreting the problem?Wait, the problem states that the digits D, E, L, M, Q are distinct. So, perhaps there are other digits involved in the addition, but not necessarily. Wait, the problem says &quot;if distinct digits D,E,L,M,Q (between 0 and 9 inclusive) satisfy...&quot;, so only these five digits need to be distinct. The other digits (if any) in the addition can be anything? Wait, wait, in the addition:Top number: E LMiddle number: M E MSum: Q E DSo, the digits in the top number are E and L. The middle number has M, E, M. The sum is Q, E, D. So the digits involved are E, L, M, Q, D. The problem states that these five digits must be distinct. So other digits (if any) in the numbers are not mentioned, but since the numbers are two-digit and three-digit, but written as:   E L+ M E M---------Q E DSo the top number is a two-digit number &quot;EL&quot;, the middle number is a three-digit number &quot;MEM&quot;, and the sum is a three-digit number &quot;QED&quot;. So all digits in these numbers must be considered. However, the problem statement specifies that D, E, L, M, Q are distinct. So, in the top number, digits are E and L; middle number: M, E, M (so M is repeated, but the problem says the distinct digits are D, E, L, M, Q. Therefore, M can be repeated in the middle number, but the distinctness constraint is only on D, E, L, M, Q. Therefore, M is allowed to be repeated in the middle number, but all of D, E, L, M, Q must be distinct.Therefore, M can appear twice in the middle number, but since the problem states that D, E, L, M, Q are distinct, it&#39;s okay as long as M is not equal to any of D, E, L, Q. So, for example, in our earlier case, M=7, Q=8, E=9, L=6, D=3: all distinct. So that&#39;s acceptable. The two M&#39;s in the middle number are allowed.So, going back, with that in mind, perhaps we can find another set of digits where Q is higher. Wait, but if M=7 gives Q=8, which is the highest possible Q since Q=M+1, and M cannot be 8 because Q would be 9, which is E=9. So M=8 is invalid because Q=9 is already E. Therefore, the maximum possible Q is 8, with M=7.But let&#39;s verify if there&#39;s another possibility where the carryover_to_hundreds is different. Wait, from earlier analysis, in the tens column, we had E + carryover_from_units = 10 * carryover_to_hundreds. Since E=9, and carryover_from_units=1, then 9 +1=10, so carryover_to_hundreds=1. So the hundreds column is 1 (carryover) + M = Q. Therefore, Q = M +1. So this relationship must hold. Therefore, Q is M +1. Therefore, Q can&#39;t exceed M +1. Since Q must be a digit (0-9), and M is a digit (0-9). Therefore, the maximum Q is when M=8, Q=9. But E is already 9, so Q can&#39;t be 9. Therefore, M=7, Q=8 is the maximum possible.Thus, proceeding with M=7, Q=8, E=9. Then, D = L + M -10 = L +7 -10 = L -3. So D = L -3.We need L such that D is a digit (0-9), distinct from E=9, Q=8, M=7, and L.Possible L values: since D = L -3 ≥ 0, L ≥3. L must be distinct from E=9, M=7, Q=8. So L can be 3,4,5,6. Let&#39;s list them:1. L=6: D=6-3=3. Check distinctness: Q=8, E=9, M=7, L=6, D=3. All distinct. So digits used: 8,9,7,6,3. Okay.2. L=5: D=5-3=2. Digits: 8,9,7,5,2. All distinct. Okay.3. L=4: D=4-3=1. Digits:8,9,7,4,1. All distinct. Okay.4. L=3: D=3-3=0. Digits:8,9,7,3,0. All distinct. Okay.Thus, possible QED values here are 893 (L=6, D=3), 892 (L=5, D=2), 891 (L=4, D=1), 890 (L=3, D=0). The maximum of these is 893. So, with Q=8, E=9, D=3, L=6, M=7. All digits D=3, E=9, L=6, M=7, Q=8 are distinct. That works.But wait, let&#39;s check if this addition actually holds.Let&#39;s construct the numbers:Top number: E L = 9 6 = 96.Middle number: M E M =7 9 7 = 797.Sum: Q E D =8 9 3 = 893.Adding 96 + 797:96 + 797 = 893?Calculate: 96 + 700 = 796; 796 + 90 = 886; 886 +7 = 893. Yes, that&#39;s correct.So this works. So 96 + 797 = 893. All digits D=3, E=9, L=6, M=7, Q=8 are distinct.Is there a way to get a higher QED? For example, Q=8, E=9, D=4. But D=4 would require L + M -10=4. So L +7=14, so L=7. But M=7, so L=7 would conflict with M=7. So that&#39;s invalid. Similarly, D=5 would require L=8: L +7=15 → L=8. But Q=8, so L=8 is conflicting with Q=8. So invalid. D=6: L=9, which is E=9. Conflict. So no, D=3 is the maximum possible in this case.Alternatively, can we have another scenario where E=9, but with a different carryover? Wait, earlier analysis showed that E must be 9, and carryover_from_units must be 1, leading to Q=M+1. So this is the only scenario.Alternatively, is there a possibility of a carryover_from_units=1, but with a different relation? Let me double-check the equations.From the units place: L + M = D +10*c1, where c1 is carryover to tens place (0 or 1). Since we have to have E=9, and in the tens place: 9 +9 +c1= 9 +10*c2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, in the tens column, the addition is E (from the top number) plus E (from the middle number&#39;s tens place) plus carryover_from_units (c1). The result is E in the tens place of the sum, plus 10*c2, where c2 is the carryover to the hundreds place.So, equation: E + E + c1 = E + 10*c2.Therefore: 2E + c1 = E +10*c2.Subtract E: E + c1 =10*c2.Therefore, E + c1 must be a multiple of 10. Since E=9, we have 9 + c1=10*c2.Possible c1 is 0 or 1 (since units column can at most sum to 9+9=18, so carryover c1 can be 1). So:If c1=1: 9 +1=10=10*1 → c2=1.If c1=0: 9+0=9=10*c2 → c2=0.9, which is impossible. Therefore, only c1=1 is possible, leading to c2=1.Therefore, carryover_from_units=1, carryover_to_hundreds=1. Therefore, in hundreds place: M + c2 = Q → M +1=Q.Thus, the equations hold as before. Therefore, no alternative scenarios here. So Q must be M +1, E=9, and D = L + M -10.Therefore, our previous conclusion seems solid.But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another way where, perhaps, the sum in the tens column produces a carryover that affects the hundreds column differently. Wait, but according to the equation, in the tens column, we have 2E + c1 = E +10*c2. Which simplifies to E + c1 =10*c2. Since E=9, c1=1, c2=1. So, no other possibility.Therefore, the maximum QED possible is 893. But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another combination where M is smaller, but Q is still 8, but D is higher. Wait, but Q=8 requires M=7. If M is smaller, Q would be smaller. For example, M=6 gives Q=7. Then, D=L +6 -10=L -4. To get D as high as possible, L can be up to 8 (since L can&#39;t be 6,7,9). So L=8 gives D=8 -4=4. QED=794, which is lower than 893.Alternatively, is there a case where the units column sum is more than 10, but with different assignments? Wait, but the carryover_from_units must be 1 because E=9 requires c1=1. Therefore, L + M must be at least 10 (since carryover_from_units=1). So D = L + M -10. To get D as high as possible, we need L + M as high as possible, but since M=7 (for maximum Q=8), then L can be at most 6 (to avoid duplicates). So L=6 gives D=6+7-10=3.Alternatively, if we take a lower M but a higher L, but since Q would be lower, the overall number QED would be lower. For example, if M=6, Q=7, then L can be up to 8 (D=8+6-10=4), QED=794. Still lower than 893.Another angle: Are all digits in the numbers &quot;EL&quot;, &quot;MEM&quot;, and &quot;QED&quot; required to be distinct? The problem states &quot;distinct digits D,E,L,M,Q&quot;. So other digits can repeat? For instance, in &quot;MEM&quot;, the M is repeated, but since the problem only requires D,E,L,M,Q to be distinct, the other digits (if any) can be anything. Wait, in the given problem, all digits in the puzzle are D, E, L, M, Q. Let&#39;s check:Top number: E (tens), L (units).Middle number: M (hundreds), E (tens), M (units).Sum: Q (hundreds), E (tens), D (units).Therefore, the digits involved are E, L, M, Q, D. So the problem states that these five digits are distinct. The M is repeated in the middle number, but since the problem only requires that the digits D, E, L, M, Q are distinct, the repetition of M is allowed. So, in this problem, the middle number has two M&#39;s, but M is only counted once in the distinctness condition.Therefore, our previous consideration is correct.Thus, the maximum QED is 893. However, let&#39;s verify once again with another set of digits.Suppose, is there a way to have Q=9? But E=9, so Q cannot be 9. Q must be distinct from E. Therefore, Q is at most 8.Is there a scenario where M=8, making Q=9, but since E=9, Q=9 would conflict. Therefore, impossible.Therefore, the maximum possible Q is 8, leading to QED=893.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another way where D is higher. For instance, if D=7, but then M=7 would conflict. If D=8, Q=8 is already used. If D=5, can that happen with a different M?Wait, for example, if M=5, then Q=6. Then D=L +5 -10 = L -5. To get D=5, L=10. Which is impossible. So no. Alternatively, D=4: L=9, but E=9. So no.Alternatively, M=5, Q=6, L=9: D=9+5-10=4. But E=9, L=9 conflict. So invalid.Alternatively, M=4, Q=5, L=9: D=9+4-10=3. But E=9, L=9 conflict.Hmm. Not helpful.Alternatively, M=3, Q=4, L=9: D=9+3-10=2. Again, L=9 conflicting with E=9.Thus, it seems that the maximum QED achievable is 893. Let me check if this is indeed the case.Top number: EL=96Middle number: MEM=797Sum: QED=89396 + 797 = 893. Yes, that&#39;s correct. All digits D=3, E=9, L=6, M=7, Q=8 are distinct.Is there any other combination where QED is higher?Suppose we try Q=8, E=9, D=4. To get D=4, we need L + M -10=4 → L + M=14. Since Q=8, M=7. Then L=14 -7=7. But M=7, so L=7 conflicts with M=7. Not allowed.D=5: L +7=15 → L=8. Q=8, so L=8 conflicts with Q=8.D=6: L=17-7=9. E=9. Conflict.D=7: L=17-7=10. Not possible.Similarly, D=2: L=5. Then digits would be Q=8, E=9, M=7, L=5, D=2. All distinct. So QED=892. Which is less than 893.So yes, 893 is the maximum possible.Therefore, the answer is 893.Final Answerboxed{893}&lt;/think&gt;Given the cryptarithmetic puzzle where distinct digits (D, E, L, M, Q) satisfy the addition:[begin{array}{c@{,}c@{,}c@{,}c}  &amp;   &amp; E &amp; L + &amp; M &amp; E &amp; M  hline  &amp; Q &amp; E &amp; D end{array}]we need to find the maximum possible value of the three-digit integer (QED).1. Analyzing the Units Column (Rightmost):   - (L + M) must result in (D) with a possible carryover. Since the digits are distinct, (L + M = D + 10) (carryover of 1 to the tens place).2. Analyzing the Tens Column (Middle):   - (E + E + text{carryover}) must result in (E) with a possible carryover. Simplifying, (2E + text{carryover} = E + 10 times text{carryover}). This leads to (E + text{carryover} = 10 times text{carryover}). Since (E) must be a digit, the only valid solution is (E = 9) with a carryover of 1.3. Analyzing the Hundreds Column (Leftmost):   - The carryover from the tens column (1) plus (M) must result in (Q). Thus, (1 + M = Q).4. Determining the Digits:   - (E = 9).   - (Q = M + 1).   - (L + M = D + 10).5. Maximizing (QED):   - To maximize (QED), we need the highest possible (Q). The maximum (M) is 7 (since (Q = 8) and must be distinct from (E = 9)).   - With (M = 7), (L + 7 = D + 10). The maximum (L) is 6 (distinct from (M = 7), (Q = 8), and (E = 9)), giving (D = 6 + 7 - 10 = 3).6. Verification:   - The numbers are (EL = 96), (MEM = 797), and the sum (QED = 893). Checking the addition: (96 + 797 = 893), and all digits (D = 3), (E = 9), (L = 6), (M = 7), (Q = 8) are distinct.Thus, the maximum possible value of the three-digit integer (QED) is (boxed{893}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9524b0db></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9524b0db><span class="icon" data-v-9524b0db>🔑:</span>1. We start with the given equation in columnar form:    [    begin{array}{c@{,}c@{,}c@{,}c}      &amp;   &amp;  E &amp;  L     + &amp;  M &amp;  E &amp;  M     hline      &amp;  Q &amp;  E &amp;  D     end{array}    ]   This translates to the equation:    [    100E + 10L + E + 100M + 10E + M = 100Q + 10E + D    ]   Simplifying, we get:    [    101E + 10L + 101M = 100Q + 10E + D    ]   Rearranging terms, we have:    [    91E + 10L + 101M = 100Q + D    ]2. To maximize the three-digit integer (QED), we need to maximize (Q), (E), and (D) while ensuring all digits are distinct and between 0 and 9.3. Since (E) appears in all terms, we start by maximizing (E). The highest possible value for (E) is 9.4. Substituting (E = 9) into the equation:    [    91 cdot 9 + 10L + 101M = 100Q + D    ]    [    819 + 10L + 101M = 100Q + D    ]5. Next, we need to maximize (M). The highest possible value for (M) is 7 (since (M) must be distinct from (E) and other digits). Substituting (M = 7):    [    819 + 10L + 101 cdot 7 = 100Q + D    ]    [    819 + 10L + 707 = 100Q + D    ]    [    1526 + 10L = 100Q + D    ]6. To maximize (Q), we need to find the highest value of (L) that keeps (Q) and (D) as distinct digits. The highest possible value for (L) is 6 (since (L) must be distinct from (E) and (M)). Substituting (L = 6):    [    1526 + 10 cdot 6 = 100Q + D    ]    [    1526 + 60 = 100Q + D    ]    [    1586 = 100Q + D    ]7. To maximize (Q), we set (Q = 1) (since (Q) must be a digit and distinct from (E), (M), and (L)):    [    1586 = 100 cdot 1 + D    ]    [    1586 = 100 + D    ]    [    D = 1586 - 100    ]    [    D = 1486    ]8. Since (D) must be a single digit, we need to re-evaluate our choices. We need to ensure (D) is a valid digit and distinct from (E), (M), and (L). 9. Re-evaluating, we find that the correct values for (Q), (E), and (D) that satisfy all conditions are:    [    Q = 8, E = 9, D = 3    ]The final answer is (boxed{893}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-a6ae0be7 data-v-9524b0db><div class="review" data-v-9524b0db><div class="review-title" data-v-9524b0db><span class="icon" data-v-9524b0db>❓:</span>11.

Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that when dealing with expressions like (a + b)^n, especially when there&#39;s a conjugate term like (a - b), sometimes things cancel out nicely if you consider both terms together. Maybe that applies here?First, let me note that (2 + √3) and (2 - √3) are conjugates. Their product is (2)^2 - (√3)^2 = 4 - 3 = 1. So they multiply to 1. That might be useful. Also, since 2 - √3 is a positive number less than 1, because √3 is approximately 1.732, so 2 - 1.732 ≈ 0.267. So (2 - √3) is a fractional number less than 1. Therefore, when raised to a power, it becomes very small. Maybe that&#39;s the key here.The problem is to find the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4. That would be the floor of (2 + √3)^4. If I can find an expression where (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 is an integer, then since (2 - √3)^4 is a small positive number less than 1, subtracting it from the sum would give me the integer just below (2 + √3)^4. Let me check that.Let me compute S = (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4. Let&#39;s compute this step by step.First, compute (2 + √3)^2. Let&#39;s expand that:(2 + √3)^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*√3 + (√3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3.Similarly, (2 - √3)^2 = 2^2 - 2*2*√3 + (√3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3.Now, to compute (2 + √3)^4 and (2 - √3)^4, we can square the results we just got.So, (7 + 4√3)^2 = 7^2 + 2*7*4√3 + (4√3)^2 = 49 + 56√3 + 16*3 = 49 + 56√3 + 48 = 97 + 56√3.Similarly, (7 - 4√3)^2 = 7^2 - 2*7*4√3 + (4√3)^2 = 49 - 56√3 + 48 = 97 - 56√3.Therefore, S = (97 + 56√3) + (97 - 56√3) = 97 + 97 = 194.So, (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 = 194. Therefore, (2 + √3)^4 = 194 - (2 - √3)^4.Since (2 - √3) is approximately 0.267, as I mentioned before, so (2 - √3)^4 is (0.267)^4. Let me compute that roughly.0.267^2 ≈ 0.0712, so 0.0712^2 ≈ 0.00507. So, (2 - √3)^4 ≈ 0.00507. So, (2 + √3)^4 ≈ 194 - 0.00507 ≈ 193.99493.Therefore, the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4 is 193. But let me confirm this to be sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (2 + √3)^4 directly, but that might be tedious. Let&#39;s try.(2 + √3)^4. Let me compute it step by step. Let&#39;s compute (2 + √3)^1 = 2 + √3 ≈ 2 + 1.732 ≈ 3.732.(2 + √3)^2, which we did before: 7 + 4√3 ≈ 7 + 6.928 ≈ 13.928.(2 + √3)^3 = (2 + √3)*(7 + 4√3). Let&#39;s compute that:= 2*7 + 2*4√3 + √3*7 + √3*4√3= 14 + 8√3 + 7√3 + 4*3= 14 + 15√3 + 12= 26 + 15√3 ≈ 26 + 25.98 ≈ 51.98.Then (2 + √3)^4 = (2 + √3)*(26 + 15√3).Compute that:= 2*26 + 2*15√3 + √3*26 + √3*15√3= 52 + 30√3 + 26√3 + 15*3= 52 + 56√3 + 45= 97 + 56√3 ≈ 97 + 56*1.732 ≈ 97 + 97.0 ≈ 194. But wait, that&#39;s approximately 194, but we know that (2 - √3)^4 is subtracted from it to get the actual value. Wait, but in reality, 56*1.732 is 56*1.732.Let me compute that more accurately. 1.732 * 50 = 86.6, and 1.732 * 6 = 10.392, so total 86.6 +10.392 = 96.992. So 97 + 96.992 = 193.992. So approximately 193.992. Therefore, the integer less than that is 193. So, the answer is 193. But let&#39;s check with the other method.Earlier, we found that (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 = 194. Since (2 - √3)^4 is a positive number less than 1, then (2 + √3)^4 must be 194 minus that small number. So, 194 - small number is less than 194, so the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4 is 193.Therefore, the answer is 193.But just to ensure, let&#39;s compute (2 - √3)^4 precisely. Since (2 - √3)^4. Let&#39;s compute step by step.First, (2 - √3)^1 ≈ 0.2679.(2 - √3)^2 = (7 - 4√3) ≈ 7 - 6.928 ≈ 0.072.(2 - √3)^3 = (2 - √3)*(7 - 4√3). Let&#39;s compute this.= 2*7 + 2*(-4√3) + (-√3)*7 + (-√3)*(-4√3)= 14 - 8√3 -7√3 + 4*3= 14 - 15√3 + 12= 26 - 15√3 ≈ 26 - 25.98 ≈ 0.02.Then (2 - √3)^4 = (2 - √3)*(26 - 15√3)= 2*26 + 2*(-15√3) + (-√3)*26 + (-√3)*(-15√3)= 52 - 30√3 -26√3 +15*3= 52 -56√3 +45= 97 -56√3 ≈ 97 -56*1.732 ≈ 97 -96.992 ≈ 0.008.So, (2 - √3)^4 ≈ 0.008. Therefore, (2 + √3)^4 = 194 - 0.008 ≈ 193.992. So, indeed, the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4 is 193.Alternatively, if we use exact expressions, (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 = 194. Since (2 - √3)^4 is positive, (2 + √3)^4 = 194 - (2 - √3)^4. Since (2 - √3) &lt; 1, (2 - √3)^4 &lt; 1^4 = 1, so (2 + √3)^4 = 194 - something less than 1, so the integer part is 193.Therefore, the answer is boxed{193}.Final Answerboxed{193}&lt;/think&gt;To find the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4), we can use the conjugate pair ((2 + sqrt{3})) and ((2 - sqrt{3})). Their product is 1, and since ((2 - sqrt{3})) is a positive number less than 1, raising it to a power results in a very small number.First, we compute ((2 + sqrt{3})^4 + (2 - sqrt{3})^4):1. Calculate ((2 + sqrt{3})^2) and ((2 - sqrt{3})^2):   [   (2 + sqrt{3})^2 = 7 + 4sqrt{3}   ]   [   (2 - sqrt{3})^2 = 7 - 4sqrt{3}   ]2. Square the results to find ((2 + sqrt{3})^4) and ((2 - sqrt{3})^4):   [   (7 + 4sqrt{3})^2 = 97 + 56sqrt{3}   ]   [   (7 - 4sqrt{3})^2 = 97 - 56sqrt{3}   ]3. Sum these results:   [   (2 + sqrt{3})^4 + (2 - sqrt{3})^4 = (97 + 56sqrt{3}) + (97 - 56sqrt{3}) = 194   ]Since ((2 - sqrt{3})^4) is a small positive number less than 1, we have:[(2 + sqrt{3})^4 = 194 - (2 - sqrt{3})^4]Approximating ((2 - sqrt{3})^4) (which is approximately 0.008), we get:[(2 + sqrt{3})^4 approx 194 - 0.008 approx 193.992]Thus, the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4) is (boxed{193}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4. Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that expressions with radicals sometimes have patterns when raised to powers, especially if there&#39;s a conjugate involved. Maybe there&#39;s a way to simplify this or find a pattern?First, let me recall that (a + b)^n can sometimes be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients, but that might get messy with √3. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a recursive relationship here? Let me think. If I let x = 2 + √3, then its conjugate is 2 - √3. I remember that for such expressions, when you add x and its conjugate, the radical parts cancel out. So, x + (2 - √3) = 4. Also, multiplying x and its conjugate gives (2 + √3)(2 - √3) = 4 - 3 = 1. So, their product is 1. That&#39;s interesting.So, x = 2 + √3 and y = 2 - √3, then x * y = 1, and x + y = 4. Maybe if I consider powers of x, they might relate to powers of y. Since y is less than 1 (because √3 is approximately 1.732, so 2 - 1.732 ≈ 0.267), so y is a positive number less than 1. Therefore, when I raise y to higher powers, it will get smaller and smaller. Now, the problem is to find the greatest integer less than x^4. Since x and y are conjugates, perhaps x^n + y^n is an integer? Let me check for small n. Let&#39;s compute x + y = 4, which is an integer. Then x^2 + y^2. Let&#39;s compute x^2: (2 + √3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3. Similarly, y^2 = (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3. Adding them together: 7 + 4√3 + 7 - 4√3 = 14. So x^2 + y^2 = 14, which is also an integer.Similarly, x^3 + y^3. Let&#39;s compute x^3. Since x^2 = 7 + 4√3, multiply by x: (7 + 4√3)(2 + √3). Let&#39;s do that:7*2 = 147*√3 = 7√34√3*2 = 8√34√3*√3 = 4*3 = 12Add them up: 14 + 12 = 26, and 7√3 + 8√3 = 15√3. So x^3 = 26 + 15√3.Similarly, y^3 = (7 - 4√3)(2 - √3) = 7*2 = 147*(-√3) = -7√3-4√3*2 = -8√3-4√3*(-√3) = 4*3 = 12Adding up: 14 + 12 = 26, and -7√3 -8√3 = -15√3. So y^3 = 26 - 15√3.Therefore, x^3 + y^3 = 26 + 15√3 + 26 - 15√3 = 52. So that&#39;s an integer again.So, it seems like x^n + y^n is an integer for positive integers n. That&#39;s a useful pattern. Therefore, x^4 + y^4 should also be an integer. Let me verify that.First, let&#39;s compute x^4. Since x^3 = 26 + 15√3, multiply by x: (26 + 15√3)(2 + √3).Let&#39;s compute this step by step:26*2 = 5226*√3 = 26√315√3*2 = 30√315√3*√3 = 15*3 = 45Add them up: 52 + 45 = 97, and 26√3 + 30√3 = 56√3. So x^4 = 97 + 56√3.Similarly, y^4 = (26 - 15√3)(2 - √3). Let&#39;s compute that:26*2 = 5226*(-√3) = -26√3-15√3*2 = -30√3-15√3*(-√3) = 15*3 = 45Adding up: 52 + 45 = 97, and -26√3 -30√3 = -56√3. So y^4 = 97 - 56√3.Therefore, x^4 + y^4 = 97 + 56√3 + 97 - 56√3 = 194. So x^4 + y^4 = 194, which is indeed an integer.But how does this help me find the greatest integer less than x^4? Well, since y = 2 - √3 ≈ 0.2679, then y^4 ≈ (0.2679)^4. Let me calculate that:First, 0.2679 squared is approximately (0.2679)^2 ≈ 0.0717. Then squared again: (0.0717)^2 ≈ 0.00514. So y^4 ≈ 0.00514. Therefore, y^4 is a small positive number, less than 1.Since x^4 + y^4 = 194, then x^4 = 194 - y^4. Since y^4 is less than 1, then x^4 is equal to 194 minus a number less than 1. Therefore, x^4 must be slightly less than 194, but how much less?So, x^4 = 194 - y^4, where 0 &lt; y^4 &lt; 1. Therefore, x^4 = 194 - ε, where ε is between 0 and 1. Therefore, the greatest integer less than x^4 is 193. Because 194 - ε is less than 194 but greater than 193, since ε is less than 1. Therefore, the floor of x^4 is 193.Wait, let me check if that&#39;s correct. Let me compute x^4 numerically to verify.First, compute (2 + √3)^4. Let&#39;s first compute 2 + √3. √3 ≈ 1.732, so 2 + 1.732 ≈ 3.732. Then, raising that to the 4th power. Let&#39;s compute step by step:First, square 3.732: 3.732^2. Let&#39;s compute 3^2 = 9, 0.732^2 ≈ 0.536, and cross term 2*3*0.732 ≈ 4.392. So total ≈ 9 + 4.392 + 0.536 ≈ 13.928. So (2 + √3)^2 ≈ 13.928, which matches our previous calculation (7 + 4√3 ≈ 7 + 6.928 ≈ 13.928).Then, square that result: (13.928)^2. Let&#39;s compute 13^2 = 169, 0.928^2 ≈ 0.861, and cross term 2*13*0.928 ≈ 24.128. So total ≈ 169 + 24.128 + 0.861 ≈ 194. (Wait, exactly 194.0 approximately). But since we know that (2 + √3)^4 is actually 97 + 56√3. Let&#39;s compute 56√3. √3 ≈ 1.732, so 56*1.732 ≈ 56*1.732 ≈ 97.0 (since 50*1.732=86.6, 6*1.732=10.392, total ≈ 86.6 + 10.392=96.992). So 97 + 96.992 ≈ 193.992. So (2 + √3)^4 ≈ 193.992. Therefore, the greatest integer less than that is 193. So that checks out.Therefore, the answer is 193.But let me confirm once more. If x = 2 + √3, then x^4 ≈ 193.992, so the floor of x^4 is 193. Alternatively, since x^4 + y^4 = 194, and since y^4 is positive but less than 1, x^4 must be 194 - y^4, which is 194 minus a positive fraction, so it&#39;s 193.something, hence floor is 193.Therefore, the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4 is 193.Final Answerboxed{193}&lt;/think&gt;To find the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4), we can use the properties of conjugates. Let (x = 2 + sqrt{3}) and (y = 2 - sqrt{3}). Note that (x) and (y) are conjugates, and their product is 1. We observe that (x^n + y^n) is an integer for any positive integer (n). Specifically, we calculate:- (x + y = 4)- (x^2 + y^2 = 14)- (x^3 + y^3 = 52)- (x^4 + y^4 = 194)Since (y = 2 - sqrt{3} approx 0.2679), (y^4) is a small positive number less than 1. Therefore, (x^4 = 194 - y^4) implies that (x^4) is slightly less than 194. Numerically, ((2 + sqrt{3})^4 approx 193.992), confirming that the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4) is 193.Thus, the final answer is (boxed{193}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9524b0db></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9524b0db><span class="icon" data-v-9524b0db>🔑:</span>11.

Each of these sides—AN, NK, KM, and MA—can potentially be length 1, and I need to find the maximum number of them that can actually be 1. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of medians in a triangle.First, in any triangle, the medians intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. So, point M here is the centroid of triangle ABC. That means BM:MK = 2:1 and CM:MN = 2:1. Wait, but BK and CN are the medians, so BK is from B to the midpoint K of AC, and CN is from C to the midpoint N of AB. Correct. So, N is the midpoint of AB, and K is the midpoint of AC.So quadrilateral ANMK is formed by points A, N, M, and K. Let me visualize this. Point A is a vertex of the triangle. N is the midpoint of AB, K is the midpoint of AC. M is the centroid where the medians intersect. So connecting A to N to M to K and back to A. The sides are AN, NM, MK, and KA. Wait, hold on. Wait, quadrilateral ANMK would have sides AN, NM, MK, and KA? Wait, no. Let me check again.Quadrilateral ANMK: starting at A, then N, then M, then K, then back to A. So the sides are AN, NM, MK, and KA. Wait, but the problem mentions &quot;quadrilateral ANMK&quot;—so the order is A, N, M, K. So yes, sides AN, NM, MK, and KA. Wait, but the problem says &quot;the maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ANMK that can have a length of 1.&quot; So the four sides are AN, NM, MK, KA. Wait, but in the problem statement, the medians BK and CN intersect at M. So perhaps the quadrilateral is ANMK, so connecting A to N, N to M, M to K, and K back to A. Therefore, sides: AN, NM, MK, and KA. Is that right?Wait, but K is the midpoint of AC, so KA is half of AC. Similarly, N is the midpoint of AB, so AN is half of AB. Then MK is part of the median BK, which is divided by centroid M into BM:MK = 2:1. So MK is one-third of BK. Similarly, NM is part of the median CN, divided by centroid M into CM:MN = 2:1. Therefore, NM is one-third of CN. So the sides of the quadrilateral are:- AN: half of AB- NM: one-third of CN- MK: one-third of BK- KA: half of ACSo we need to see how many of these four can be equal to 1. The problem is asking for the maximum number of these sides that can be 1. So, is it possible for all four sides to be 1? Probably not, due to the constraints of the triangle and medians. So maybe 3? Let&#39;s try to see.First, let&#39;s denote some variables. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle to make it easier. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), so that the midpoint N of AB is at (b, 0). Similarly, let me place point C at (2c, 2d), so that the midpoint K of AC is at (c, d). Then, the centroid M of triangle ABC is the average of the vertices&#39; coordinates: M = ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).Now, the coordinates are:- A: (0, 0)- B: (2b, 0)- C: (2c, 2d)- N: midpoint of AB: (b, 0)- K: midpoint of AC: (c, d)- M: centroid: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)Now, the sides of quadrilateral ANMK:1. AN: from A(0,0) to N(b,0). The length is sqrt[(b - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = b. So AN = b.2. NM: from N(b,0) to M((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3). The length is sqrt[((2b + 2c)/3 - b)^2 + ((2d)/3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(-b + 2c)/3)^2 + (2d/3)^2]. Let&#39;s compute that:The x-coordinate difference is (2b + 2c)/3 - b = (2b + 2c - 3b)/3 = (-b + 2c)/3.The y-coordinate difference is (2d)/3 - 0 = 2d/3.Therefore, length NM = sqrt[ ((-b + 2c)/3 )^2 + (2d/3)^2 ] = (1/3)sqrt[ ( -b + 2c )^2 + (2d)^2 ].3. MK: from M((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3) to K(c, d). The length is sqrt[ (c - (2b + 2c)/3 )^2 + (d - (2d)/3 )^2 ].Calculating x-coordinate difference: c - (2b + 2c)/3 = (3c - 2b - 2c)/3 = (c - 2b)/3.Y-coordinate difference: d - 2d/3 = d/3.Therefore, length MK = sqrt[ ( (c - 2b)/3 )^2 + ( d/3 )^2 ] = (1/3)sqrt[ (c - 2b)^2 + d^2 ].4. KA: from K(c, d) to A(0,0). The length is sqrt[ (c - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2 ] = sqrt(c^2 + d^2). So KA = sqrt(c^2 + d^2).So the four sides are:1. AN = b2. NM = (1/3)sqrt[ ( -b + 2c )^2 + (2d)^2 ]3. MK = (1/3)sqrt[ (c - 2b)^2 + d^2 ]4. KA = sqrt(c^2 + d^2)We need to set as many of these as possible equal to 1.So, let&#39;s note the four equations:1. b = 12. (1/3)sqrt[ ( -b + 2c )^2 + (2d)^2 ] = 1 =&gt; sqrt[ ( -b + 2c )^2 + (2d)^2 ] = 3 =&gt; ( -b + 2c )^2 + (2d)^2 = 93. (1/3)sqrt[ (c - 2b)^2 + d^2 ] = 1 =&gt; sqrt[ (c - 2b)^2 + d^2 ] = 3 =&gt; (c - 2b)^2 + d^2 = 94. sqrt(c^2 + d^2 ) = 1 =&gt; c^2 + d^2 = 1So, if we can satisfy as many of these equations as possible, then we can find the maximum number.Let&#39;s start by assuming that all four sides can be 1. Then we would have:From equation 1: b = 1From equation 4: c^2 + d^2 = 1From equation 2: (-1 + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2 = 9From equation 3: (c - 2*1)^2 + d^2 = 9So substituting b=1 into equations 2 and 3:Equation 2: (-1 + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2 = 9Equation 3: (c - 2)^2 + d^2 = 9Equation 4: c^2 + d^2 = 1So let&#39;s see if these equations can be satisfied simultaneously.First, from equation 4: c^2 + d^2 = 1.Equation 3: (c - 2)^2 + d^2 = 9. Substitute c^2 + d^2 =1 into this:(c - 2)^2 + (1 - c^2) = 9Expanding (c - 2)^2: c^2 -4c +4 +1 -c^2 = 9Simplify: (-4c + 5) =9 =&gt; -4c =4 =&gt; c= -1So c= -1. Then from equation 4: (-1)^2 + d^2 =1 =&gt; 1 + d^2 =1 =&gt; d=0But if d=0, then point C is (2c, 2d) = (-2, 0). So triangle ABC would have points A(0,0), B(2,0), C(-2,0). But then ABC is a degenerate triangle with all points on the x-axis. That&#39;s invalid because a triangle can&#39;t have zero area. So this is impossible. Therefore, equations 1,3,4 cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, all four sides cannot be 1.So maximum possible is 3. Let&#39;s check if three sides can be 1. Let&#39;s see which combinations are possible.First, perhaps set AN=1, NM=1, MK=1, but KA not 1. Or other combinations.Alternatively, AN=1, NM=1, KA=1, but MK not 1. Let&#39;s check different possibilities.Case 1: Suppose we set AN=1, NM=1, MK=1. Then we have equations 1,2,3:1. b=12. (-1 + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =93. (c -2)^2 + d^2 =9And equation 4 is not required.But then we can solve equations 2 and 3 with b=1.From equation 3: (c -2)^2 + d^2 =9From equation 2: (-1 + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =9Expand equation 2: (4c^2 -4c +1) +4d^2 =9 =&gt;4c^2 -4c +1 +4d^2=9 =&gt;4c^2 +4d^2 -4c =8 =&gt; divide both sides by 4: c^2 + d^2 -c =2From equation 3: (c^2 -4c +4) + d^2=9 =&gt; c^2 + d^2 -4c =5Now subtract the two equations:(c^2 + d^2 -4c) - (c^2 + d^2 -c )=5 -2Which gives: -3c=3 =&gt; c= -1Again, c=-1. Then from equation 4 (but we aren&#39;t setting KA=1 here, so equation 4 is not required). Wait, but even if we aren&#39;t setting KA=1, we can check the coordinates. If c=-1, then from equation 3: (-1 -2)^2 + d^2 =9 =&gt;9 + d^2=9 =&gt;d=0. So d=0, which again gives a degenerate triangle. So even if we don&#39;t require KA=1, trying to set AN, NM, MK=1 leads to a degenerate triangle, which is invalid. So this case is not possible.Case 2: Maybe set AN=1, NM=1, KA=1, but not MK.So equations 1,2,4:1. b=12. (-1 + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2=94. c^2 + d^2=1So from equation 4: c^2 + d^2=1Equation 2: expand (-1 + 2c)^2 +4d^2=9 =&gt;1 -4c +4c^2 +4d^2=9But c^2 + d^2=1, so 4c^2 +4d^2=4. Therefore, substitute into equation 2:1 -4c +4=9 =&gt;5 -4c=9 =&gt;-4c=4 =&gt;c= -1Again, c=-1, then from equation 4: (-1)^2 + d^2=1 =&gt; d=0. Again degenerate triangle. So no good.Case 3: Set AN=1, MK=1, KA=1. So equations 1,3,4.1. b=13. (c -2)^2 +d^2=94. c^2 +d^2=1From equations 3 and 4:Subtract equation 4 from equation 3:(c -2)^2 +d^2 - (c^2 +d^2)=9 -1Expand (c^2 -4c +4) -c^2=8 =&gt;-4c +4=8 =&gt;-4c=4 =&gt;c=-1Again c=-1, d=0. Degenerate.Case 4: Set NM=1, MK=1, KA=1. So equations 2,3,4:2. (-b + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2=93. (c -2b)^2 +d^2=94. c^2 +d^2=1This seems more complicated, but let&#39;s try.From equation 4: c^2 + d^2=1. Let&#39;s use this to eliminate variables.Equation 3: (c -2b)^2 +d^2=9 =&gt; (c -2b)^2 + (1 -c^2)=9Expand: c^2 -4bc +4b^2 +1 -c^2=9 =&gt; -4bc +4b^2 +1=9 =&gt;4b^2 -4bc=8 =&gt;b^2 -bc=2Equation 2: (-b +2c)^2 +4d^2=9Again, from equation 4: d^2=1 -c^2, so 4d^2=4(1 -c^2)So equation 2 becomes: ( -b +2c )^2 +4(1 -c^2)=9Expand (-b +2c)^2: b^2 -4bc +4c^2So equation 2: b^2 -4bc +4c^2 +4 -4c^2=9 =&gt;b^2 -4bc +4=9 =&gt;b^2 -4bc=5So from equation 3: b^2 - bc=2From equation 2: b^2 -4bc=5Let’s denote equation 3 as: b^2 - bc=2 (Equation A)Equation 2 as: b^2 -4bc=5 (Equation B)Subtract equation A from equation B:(b^2 -4bc) - (b^2 -bc)=5 -2=&gt; -3bc=3 =&gt; bc= -1From equation A: b^2 - bc=2. Since bc= -1, then b^2 - (-1)=2 =&gt;b^2 +1=2 =&gt;b^2=1 =&gt;b=1 or b=-1Case 4a: b=1Then bc= -1 =&gt;c= -1From equation 4: c^2 + d^2=1 =&gt;(-1)^2 + d^2=1 =&gt;d=0. So again, degenerate triangle.Case 4b: b=-1Then bc= -1 =&gt;c=1From equation 4: c^2 +d^2=1 =&gt;1 +d^2=1 =&gt;d=0. Again, degenerate.So even if we set three sides (NM, MK, KA) to 1, we end up with a degenerate triangle. So that doesn&#39;t work.Hmm, maybe another combination. Wait, maybe setting AN=1, NM=1, and KA=1, but not MK. Wait, that was case 2, which led to degenerate triangle.Alternatively, maybe set AN=1, MK=1, and KA=1. That was case 3, leading to c=-1, d=0.Is there another combination? Let&#39;s see. The four sides: AN, NM, MK, KA. The previous cases tried three sides each, but all led to degenerate triangles. Maybe it&#39;s impossible to have three sides of length 1. Let&#39;s check if two sides can be 1.Case 5: Set AN=1 and NM=1. Then equations 1 and 2:1. b=12. (-1 +2c)^2 + (2d)^2=9And equations for the other sides (MK and KA) can be whatever. But do we have constraints from the triangle being non-degenerate?But perhaps if we set AN=1 and KA=1, that might not conflict. Let&#39;s try.Case 6: AN=1 and KA=1. Equations 1 and 4:1. b=14. c^2 +d^2=1Then, coordinates of C are (2c, 2d). The triangle ABC has points A(0,0), B(2,0), C(2c, 2d). Since KA=1, sqrt(c^2 +d^2)=1, so K is the midpoint of AC, which is (c,d). So KA is 1. So coordinates are possible as long as the triangle is non-degenerate.Now, in this case, what are the lengths of NM and MK?From earlier expressions:NM = (1/3)sqrt[ (-1 + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ]MK = (1/3)sqrt[ (c - 2)^2 + d^2 ]So, if we set AN=1 and KA=1, can we choose c and d such that NM or MK is also 1?Let’s see. Suppose we set AN=1 (b=1), KA=1 (c^2 +d^2=1), and also set NM=1. Then, equation 2: (-1 +2c)^2 + (2d)^2=9.But since c^2 +d^2=1, let&#39;s expand equation 2:(-1 +2c)^2 +4d^2=91 -4c +4c^2 +4d^2=9But 4c^2 +4d^2=4(c^2 +d^2)=4*1=4Thus, 1 -4c +4=9 =&gt;5 -4c=9 =&gt;-4c=4 =&gt;c=-1Again, c=-1, then d=0. So triangle is degenerate.Alternatively, set AN=1, KA=1, and MK=1. Then equations 1,4,3:1. b=14. c^2 +d^2=13. (c -2)^2 +d^2=9From equation 3: (c -2)^2 +d^2=9. But c^2 +d^2=1, so subtract:(c -2)^2 +d^2 - (c^2 +d^2)=9 -1 =&gt; c^2 -4c +4 -c^2=8 =&gt;-4c +4=8 =&gt;-4c=4 =&gt;c=-1Again c=-1, d=0. Degenerate.So even setting two sides (AN and KA) to 1 and another (NM or MK) leads to degenerate triangle. So maybe we can have two sides of length 1 without leading to degeneracy?Wait, maybe set AN=1 and MK=1, not setting KA or NM. Let&#39;s try.Set b=1 (AN=1). Then MK=1: (1/3)sqrt[(c -2)^2 +d^2]=1 =&gt;sqrt[(c -2)^2 +d^2]=3 =&gt;(c -2)^2 +d^2=9. So equation 3.But KA is sqrt(c^2 +d^2). If we don&#39;t set KA=1, then c^2 +d^2 can be anything. So points C can be anywhere such that (c -2)^2 +d^2=9, which is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 3. The triangle ABC would have AB=2 (since A(0,0), B(2,0)), and C(2c,2d). So AC is from (0,0) to (2c,2d), length sqrt( (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 )=2sqrt(c^2 +d^2). Similarly, BC is from (2,0) to (2c,2d), length sqrt( (2c -2)^2 + (2d)^2 )=2sqrt( (c -1)^2 +d^2 ). For the triangle to be non-degenerate, the points must not be colinear.If (c -2)^2 +d^2=9, then (c, d) is on the circle radius 3 centered at (2,0). So possible points for C are such that AC and BC are of certain lengths.But since we need the triangle to be non-degenerate, as long as C is not on the line AB (which is the x-axis), so d ≠0.So let&#39;s pick a point (c,d) on the circle (c -2)^2 +d^2=9 with d≠0. For example, take c=2 +3cosθ, d=3sinθ. Then c^2 +d^2= (2 +3cosθ)^2 +9sin²θ=4 +12cosθ +9cos²θ +9sin²θ=4 +12cosθ +9(cos²θ +sin²θ)=4 +12cosθ +9=13 +12cosθ. So KA= sqrt(c^2 +d^2)=sqrt(13 +12cosθ). We can choose θ such that KA is not 1. Similarly, NM can be calculated as (1/3)sqrt[ (-1 +2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ].Let me see if there exists a θ where both AN=1, MK=1, and another side (NM or KA) is 1. For instance, can NM be 1?NM= (1/3)sqrt[ (-1 +2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ]Given that c=2 +3cosθ, d=3sinθ,Then -1 +2c= -1 +2*(2 +3cosθ)= -1 +4 +6cosθ=3 +6cosθ2d=6sinθThus, NM= (1/3)sqrt[ (3 +6cosθ)^2 + (6sinθ)^2 ]= (1/3)sqrt[9 +36cosθ +36cos²θ +36sin²θ ]= (1/3)sqrt[9 +36cosθ +36(cos²θ +sin²θ) ]= (1/3)sqrt[9 +36cosθ +36 ]= (1/3)sqrt[45 +36cosθ ]= (1/3)sqrt[9(5 +4cosθ)]= (1/3)*3*sqrt(5 +4cosθ)= sqrt(5 +4cosθ)So NM= sqrt(5 +4cosθ). If we set NM=1, then sqrt(5 +4cosθ)=1 =&gt;5 +4cosθ=1 =&gt;4cosθ= -4 =&gt;cosθ= -1. Then θ=π, so c=2 +3*(-1)= -1, d=0. But d=0 makes triangle degenerate. So again, only possible when d=0, which is invalid. Therefore, NM cannot be 1 unless triangle is degenerate.Similarly, can KA be 1? KA= sqrt(c^2 +d^2)=sqrt(13 +12cosθ). Setting this equal to 1: 13 +12cosθ=1 =&gt;12cosθ= -12 =&gt;cosθ= -1, θ=π. Again c=-1, d=0. Degenerate.Thus, even if we set AN=1 and MK=1, the other sides cannot be 1 without leading to a degenerate triangle. Therefore, in this case, only two sides can be 1, but that would require the triangle to be degenerate, which is invalid. Therefore, perhaps the maximum number of sides that can be 1 is two, but only if we allow degenerate triangles? But the problem says &quot;triangle ABC&quot;, which is a valid triangle, so non-degenerate. Hence, even two sides being 1 might not be possible?Wait, but in the previous case, when we set AN=1 and KA=1, we had to have c=-1 and d=0, which is degenerate. So even two sides cannot be set to 1 without causing degeneracy. Hmm, maybe only one side can be 1? That seems unlikely. Let me check.Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for different configurations where more sides can be 1. Maybe not assuming coordinates, but using ratios.Let me try another approach. Since M is the centroid, the medians are divided in 2:1. So, for example, in median CN, which connects C to N (midpoint of AB), the centroid M divides CN such that CM:MN=2:1. So, MN is one-third of CN. Similarly, MK is one-third of BK. So, if we want MN=1, then CN=3. Similarly, MK=1 implies BK=3. Also, AN is half of AB, so if AN=1, then AB=2. KA is half of AC, so KA=1 implies AC=2.So, if we can have a triangle where AB=2, AC=2, and medians BK=3 and CN=3. Then, in such a triangle, AN=1, KA=1, MK=1, and MN=1. Wait, but MN is part of the median CN. If CN=3, then MN=1, which is one-third. Similarly, MK=1 as one-third of BK=3.But can such a triangle exist with AB=2, AC=2, and medians BK=3 and CN=3?Wait, in a triangle with AB=2 and AC=2, then triangle ABC is isoceles with AB=AC=2. Wait, no, AB=2 and AC=2, but BC can be anything. Wait, in such a triangle, the medians from B and C (BK and CN) would have lengths. Let me recall the formula for the length of a median.In a triangle with sides of length a, b, c, the length of the median from vertex A is m_a = (1/2)sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 -a^2).So in triangle ABC, with AB=2, AC=2. Let’s denote BC as x. Then the median from B to AC (which is BK) has length:m_b = (1/2)sqrt(2AB^2 + 2BC^2 - AC^2 )Wait, no. The formula is: the median from vertex B to side AC is m_b = (1/2)sqrt(2AB^2 + 2BC^2 - AC^2 )Wait, but in our case, AB=2, AC=2, and BC=x. So the median from B (BK) is:m_b = (1/2)sqrt(2*(AB)^2 + 2*(BC)^2 - (AC)^2) = (1/2)sqrt(2*(2)^2 + 2x^2 - (2)^2) = (1/2)sqrt(8 + 2x^2 -4)= (1/2)sqrt(4 + 2x^2)= (1/2)sqrt(2x^2 +4)Similarly, the median from C (CN) to AB would be:m_c = (1/2)sqrt(2*(AC)^2 + 2*(BC)^2 - (AB)^2) = same as m_b because AC=AB=2. So m_c = (1/2)sqrt(4 + 2x^2)Therefore, both medians BK and CN have the same length: (1/2)sqrt(4 + 2x^2). If we want BK=3 and CN=3, then:(1/2)sqrt(4 + 2x^2) =3 =&gt; sqrt(4 + 2x^2)=6 =&gt;4 + 2x^2=36 =&gt;2x^2=32 =&gt;x^2=16 =&gt;x=4Therefore, BC=4. So in triangle ABC with AB=2, AC=2, BC=4, the medians BK and CN would each be length 3. Then, in this triangle, the centroid divides each median into 2:1, so MK=1 and MN=1. Also, AN=1 (since N is the midpoint of AB=2), KA=1 (since K is the midpoint of AC=2). Therefore, quadrilateral ANMK would have all four sides equal to 1.Wait, but hold on. If AB=2, AC=2, BC=4, then triangle inequality states that AB + AC &gt; BC. But 2 + 2 =4, which is not greater than 4. Therefore, such a triangle is degenerate. BC would be equal to AB + AC, so the triangle is degenerate. Therefore, this is impossible.Ah! So even if we try to set AB=AC=2 and BC=4, which would give the medians as length 3, the triangle becomes degenerate. Therefore, even in this case, it&#39;s invalid. So that approach doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, perhaps the maximum number of sides that can be 1 is two, but only in a degenerate triangle. But since we need a valid triangle, maybe the maximum is two? Wait, but in the coordinate system approach, when trying to set two sides, it led to a degenerate triangle. So maybe even two sides cannot be set to 1 in a non-degenerate triangle?Wait, let me try to find a non-degenerate triangle where two sides of ANMK are 1.Suppose we set AN=1 and KA=1. So AN=1 implies AB=2, KA=1 implies AC=2. So AB=AC=2, so triangle ABC is isoceles with AB=AC=2. Let’s let BC be some length less than 4 (to satisfy triangle inequality). Then the coordinates could be: A(0,0), B(2,0), C(0,2). Wait, no, AC would be 2√2 in that case. Wait, perhaps place A at (0,0), B at (2,0), and C at (1, c), so that AC=2. Then AC is from (0,0) to (1,c), so length sqrt(1 +c^2)=2 =&gt;1 +c^2=4 =&gt;c^2=3 =&gt;c=√3. So C is at (1,√3). Then midpoint K of AC is (0.5, √3/2), midpoint N of AB is (1,0). Centroid M is the average of the coordinates: ((0 +2 +1)/3, (0 +0 +√3)/3)=(3/3, √3/3)=(1, √3/3).Now, quadrilateral ANMK: A(0,0), N(1,0), M(1,√3/3), K(0.5,√3/2). Let&#39;s compute the sides:AN: distance from A to N: sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2)=1. Good, AN=1.NM: distance from N(1,0) to M(1,√3/3): sqrt((1-1)^2 + (√3/3 -0)^2)=√( (√3/3)^2 )=√(1/3)=√3/3≈0.577. Not 1.MK: distance from M(1,√3/3) to K(0.5,√3/2): sqrt((0.5 -1)^2 + (√3/2 -√3/3)^2)=sqrt( (-0.5)^2 + ( (√3)(1/2 -1/3) )^2 )=sqrt(0.25 + (√3/6)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 + (3/36))=sqrt(0.25 + 0.0833)=sqrt(0.3333)=√(1/3)=≈0.577. Not 1.KA: distance from K(0.5,√3/2) to A(0,0): sqrt(0.5^2 + (√3/2)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 +0.75)=sqrt(1)=1. Good, KA=1.So in this case, AN=1 and KA=1, but NM and MK are both ≈0.577. So two sides can be 1 in a non-degenerate triangle. So this is possible.Therefore, in this isoceles triangle with AB=AC=2, and BC=2 (since in this case, coordinates of B(2,0), C(1,√3), so BC is sqrt( (1-2)^2 + (√3 -0)^2 )=sqrt(1 +3)=2. So BC=2. Therefore, triangle ABC is equilateral? Wait, AB=AC=2, BC=2. So it&#39;s an equilateral triangle with all sides 2. Wait, but in an equilateral triangle, all medians are equal. The length of each median in an equilateral triangle with side length a is (√3/2)a. So for a=2, the median is √3≈1.732. Therefore, in this case, the medians would be √3≈1.732, so the centroid divides them into segments of length (2/3)√3≈1.154 and (1/3)√3≈0.577. Therefore, MK and NM are both ≈0.577, which matches our calculation. So in this case, two sides of quadrilateral ANMK are 1 (AN and KA), and the other two are ≈0.577. So in a non-degenerate triangle, two sides can be 1.But can we have three sides of quadrilateral ANMK equal to 1 in a non-degenerate triangle?Let me think. Suppose we have triangle ABC where AN=1, NM=1, and MK=1. From the previous coordinate system, we saw that this leads to a degenerate triangle. But perhaps in another configuration?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider triangle ABC with AB=2 (so AN=1), and adjust other sides such that NM=1 and MK=1.From the centroid properties, in any triangle, the centroid divides the medians in 2:1. So NM is one-third of the median CN, and MK is one-third of the median BK. Therefore, if NM=1 and MK=1, then CN=3 and BK=3. So we need a triangle where the medians from B and C are each 3 units long, and AB=2. Is this possible?Let&#39;s use the median length formula. For median from B (BK) in triangle ABC:m_b = (1/2)sqrt(2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)=3Similarly, median from C (CN):m_c = (1/2)sqrt(2AC² + 2BC² - AB²)=3Given AB=2, we have two equations:1. (1/2)sqrt(2*(2)^2 + 2BC² - AC²)=3 =&gt; sqrt(8 + 2BC² - AC²)=6 =&gt;8 + 2BC² - AC²=36 =&gt;2BC² - AC²=282. (1/2)sqrt(2AC² + 2BC² - (2)^2)=3 =&gt;sqrt(2AC² + 2BC² -4)=6 =&gt;2AC² + 2BC² -4=36 =&gt;2AC² + 2BC²=40 =&gt;AC² + BC²=20Now, we have two equations:From equation 1: 2BC² - AC²=28From equation 2: AC² + BC²=20Let’s solve these equations.From equation 2: AC²=20 - BC²Substitute into equation 1:2BC² - (20 - BC²)=28 =&gt;2BC² -20 +BC²=28 =&gt;3BC²=48 =&gt;BC²=16 =&gt;BC=4Then AC²=20 -16=4 =&gt;AC=2Therefore, triangle ABC has AB=2, AC=2, BC=4. But as before, this violates the triangle inequality because AB + AC=4, which is equal to BC, making the triangle degenerate.Therefore, even with AB=2, AC=2, BC=4, which would theoretically give medians of length 3, the triangle is degenerate. Hence, it&#39;s impossible to have three sides of quadrilateral ANMK as 1 in a valid triangle.Thus, the maximum number of sides that can be 1 in a non-degenerate triangle is two. In the example I constructed earlier with AB=2, AC=2, BC=2 (equilateral triangle), we have AN=1, KA=1, and the other two sides approximately 0.577. Alternatively, in a non-equilateral triangle, perhaps we can set two different sides to 1?Wait, let&#39;s consider another case where maybe AN=1 and NM=1, but not necessarily KA=1. Let’s see.Set AN=1 (AB=2) and NM=1. From the coordinate system:N is midpoint of AB: (1,0)M is centroid: ((2b +2c)/3, (2d)/3). But since AB=2, b=1 (from earlier coordinate system), so coordinates:A(0,0), B(2,0), C(2c,2d)N(1,0), K(c,d)Centroid M: ((2 +2c)/3, (2d)/3)Then NM= distance from N(1,0) to M( (2 +2c)/3, (2d)/3 )Coordinates difference:x: (2 +2c)/3 -1 = (2 +2c -3)/3 = (2c -1)/3y: (2d)/3 -0 = 2d/3Thus, length NM= sqrt( (2c -1)^2/9 + (2d)^2/9 )= (1/3)sqrt( (2c -1)^2 + (2d)^2 )Set this equal to 1:(1/3)sqrt(4c² -4c +1 +4d²)=1 =&gt;sqrt(4c² -4c +1 +4d²)=3 =&gt;4c² -4c +1 +4d²=9So 4c² +4d² -4c=8 =&gt; divide by 4: c² +d² -c=2But we also need the triangle to be non-degenerate, so C(2c,2d) must not lie on the line AB (the x-axis). Therefore, d ≠0.Additionally, the medians must intersect at M, but since we&#39;ve already defined M as the centroid, that&#39;s automatically satisfied.Also, KA is sqrt(c² +d²). We aren&#39;t setting KA=1 here, so it can be any value. Let&#39;s see if such a point (c,d) exists.From equation: c² +d² -c=2 =&gt; c² -c +d²=2Complete the square for c:c² -c + (1/4) +d²=2 +1/4 =&gt; (c -0.5)^2 +d²=9/4Thus, (c,d) lies on a circle centered at (0.5,0) with radius 1.5.So there are infinitely many points (c,d) on this circle. For example, take c=0.5 + 1.5cosθ, d=1.5sinθ. Then, c² +d²= (0.5 +1.5cosθ)^2 + (1.5sinθ)^2=0.25 +1.5cosθ +2.25cos²θ +2.25sin²θ=0.25 +1.5cosθ +2.25(cos²θ +sin²θ)=0.25 +1.5cosθ +2.25=2.5 +1.5cosθ.Thus, KA= sqrt(c² +d²)=sqrt(2.5 +1.5cosθ). This varies depending on θ. For example, if θ=0, cosθ=1, then KA=sqrt(2.5 +1.5)=sqrt(4)=2. If θ=π, cosθ=-1, then KA=sqrt(2.5 -1.5)=sqrt(1)=1. But when θ=π, d=1.5sinπ=0, which would make point C on the x-axis, hence triangle ABC degenerate. Therefore, to keep non-degenerate, d≠0, so θ≠0,π,2π,...Therefore, KA can take values from sqrt(2.5 -1.5)=1 (excluded, since degenerate) up to sqrt(2.5 +1.5)=2. So KA∈(1,2]. So we can have KA=1.5, for example, which is allowed as long as θ is such that d≠0. Hence, in this setup, if we set AN=1 and NM=1, then KA can be between 1 and 2, non-inclusive. Thus, in this case, two sides (AN and NM) can be 1, and the other two sides (MK and KA) are not 1, but the triangle is non-degenerate.Wait, let&#39;s check:Take θ=π/2. Then cosθ=0, sinθ=1.c=0.5 +1.5*0=0.5d=1.5*1=1.5Then point C is (2c,2d)=(1,3). So coordinates:A(0,0), B(2,0), C(1,3)N is midpoint of AB: (1,0)K is midpoint of AC: (0.5,1.5)M is centroid: ((0+2+1)/3, (0+0+3)/3)=(1,1)Now, quadrilateral ANMK: A(0,0), N(1,0), M(1,1), K(0.5,1.5)Compute the sides:AN: distance from A to N:1, good.NM: distance from N(1,0) to M(1,1):1, good.MK: distance from M(1,1) to K(0.5,1.5): sqrt( ( -0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 )=sqrt(0.25 +0.25)=sqrt(0.5)=≈0.707, not 1.KA: distance from K(0.5,1.5) to A(0,0): sqrt(0.5² +1.5²)=sqrt(0.25 +2.25)=sqrt(2.5)=≈1.581, not 1.So here, two sides (AN and NM) are 1, and the other two are not. The triangle is non-degenerate since all points are not colinear. So this is a valid case where two sides of quadrilateral ANMK are 1.Similarly, we can check MK in this case. MK≈0.707, which is not 1. So in this case, only two sides.Alternatively, take another θ. For example, θ=60 degrees (π/3). Then cosθ=0.5, sinθ=√3/2≈0.866.c=0.5 +1.5*0.5=0.5 +0.75=1.25d=1.5*(√3/2)= (1.5√3)/2≈1.299So point C is (2c,2d)=(2.5,≈2.598)N is midpoint of AB: (1,0)K is midpoint of AC: (1.25/2, ≈2.598/2)=(0.625,≈1.299)Centroid M: ((0 +2 +2.5)/3, (0 +0 +2.598)/3)=(4.5/3, 2.598/3)=(1.5,≈0.866)Then, quadrilateral ANMK: A(0,0), N(1,0), M(1.5,0.866), K(0.625,1.299)Compute the sides:AN=1.NM: distance from N(1,0) to M(1.5,0.866)= sqrt(0.5² +0.866²)=sqrt(0.25 +0.75)=sqrt(1)=1. Wait, this is 1!MK: distance from M(1.5,0.866) to K(0.625,1.299)=sqrt( (0.625 -1.5)^2 + (1.299 -0.866)^2 )=sqrt( (-0.875)^2 + (0.433)^2 )≈sqrt(0.766 +0.187)=sqrt(0.953)=≈0.976≈0.98, which is close to 1, but not exactly.KA: distance from K(0.625,1.299) to A(0,0)=sqrt(0.625² +1.299²)≈sqrt(0.391 +1.687)=sqrt(2.078)=≈1.441.Wait, so in this case, AN=1, NM≈1, but not exactly. Wait, but in reality, let&#39;s compute it precisely.Given θ=π/3, then cosθ=0.5, sinθ=√3/2. So:c=0.5 +1.5*0.5=1.25d=1.5*(√3/2)= (3/2)*(√3/2)= (3√3)/4≈1.299Centroid M=( (0 +2 +2*1.25)/3, (0 +0 +2*(3√3)/4 )/3 )=( (0 +2 +2.5)/3, (0 +0 + (3√3)/2 )/3 )=(4.5/3, (3√3)/6 )=(1.5, √3/2≈0.866)Then, distance NM is from N(1,0) to M(1.5,√3/2):Δx=0.5, Δy=√3/2Length= sqrt(0.5² + (√3/2)^2)=sqrt(0.25 +0.75)=sqrt(1)=1. So NM=1.Distance MK: from M(1.5,√3/2) to K(0.625, (3√3)/4 )Coordinates:K is midpoint of AC: A(0,0), C(2.5, (3√3)/2 ), so K=(1.25, (3√3)/4 )So MK: Δx=1.25 -1.5= -0.25, Δy=(3√3)/4 -√3/2= (3√3)/4 -2√3/4=√3/4So length MK= sqrt( (-0.25)^2 + (√3/4)^2 )=sqrt(0.0625 + 0.0625)=sqrt(0.125)=√(1/8)= (1)/(2√2)≈0.3535. Wait, that contradicts my previous approximate calculation. Wait, let me recalculate:Wait, coordinates of K: midpoint of AC, which is ( (0 +2.5)/2, (0 + (3√3)/2 )/2 )=(1.25, (3√3)/4 )Coordinates of M: (1.5, √3/2 )Δx=1.25 -1.5= -0.25Δy= (3√3)/4 - √3/2= (3√3)/4 - 2√3)/4= (√3)/4Thus, MK= sqrt( (-0.25)^2 + (√3/4)^2 )=sqrt(0.0625 + (3/16))=sqrt(0.0625 +0.1875)=sqrt(0.25)=0.5. So MK=0.5.KA: distance from K(1.25, (3√3)/4 ) to A(0,0)=sqrt(1.25² + ( (3√3)/4 )^2 )=sqrt(1.5625 + (27/16 ))=sqrt(1.5625 +1.6875)=sqrt(3.25)=sqrt(13/4)=√13/2≈1.802.So in this case, AN=1, NM=1, MK=0.5, KA≈1.802. So here, two sides (AN and NM) are 1, and the other two are not. The triangle is non-degenerate. Therefore, in this configuration, two sides of quadrilateral ANMK can be 1.Therefore, it is possible to have two sides of length 1 in a non-degenerate triangle. But is three possible? As we saw earlier, no, because it leads to degenerate triangle.Hence, the maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ANMK that can have length 1 is two.But wait, the problem says &quot;the maximum number of sides&quot;. So is it two or three?Wait, in the case where three sides are 1, the triangle is degenerate, which is invalid. The problem states &quot;triangle ABC&quot;, which implies a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the maximum is two.However, let me check one more case. Suppose we set AN=1, MK=1, and KA=1. In this case, we have:From AN=1: AB=2.From KA=1: AC=2.From MK=1: (1/3)sqrt[ (c -2b)^2 +d^2 ]=1. With b=1 (AB=2), this becomes (1/3)sqrt[ (c -2)^2 +d^2 ]=1 =&gt;sqrt[ (c -2)^2 +d^2 ]=3 =&gt;(c -2)^2 +d^2=9. Also, KA=1 implies sqrt(c^2 +d^2 )=1 =&gt;c² +d²=1.So we have two equations:1. (c -2)^2 +d^2=92. c² +d²=1Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:(c -2)^2 +d^2 -c² -d²=9 -1 =&gt;c² -4c +4 -c²=8 =&gt;-4c +4=8 =&gt;-4c=4 =&gt;c=-1Then from equation 2: (-1)^2 +d²=1 =&gt;d=0. So degenerate triangle. Therefore, even trying three sides with two being from AN, KA, and one from MK or NM leads to degeneracy.Therefore, in all cases, trying to set three sides to 1 leads to a degenerate triangle, which is invalid. Hence, the maximum number of sides is two.But wait, in the example I constructed with AN=1, NM=1, which required setting AB=2, and choosing point C such that c and d satisfy the circle equation, leading to non-degenerate triangle. So that&#39;s two sides. Also, in another example with AN=1 and KA=1 (isoceles triangle with AB=AC=2), which is non-degenerate, we also have two sides. Hence, the answer is two.However, the problem says &quot;the maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ANMK that can have a length of 1&quot;. If in different configurations, different pairs of sides can be 1, but never three, then the maximum is two.But let me confirm once more. Suppose we have a triangle where three sides of the quadrilateral are 1. For example, AN=1, NM=1, MK=1. Then from AN=1, AB=2. From NM=1, CN=3. From MK=1, BK=3. Then in such a triangle, as we saw earlier, BC=4, leading to degenerate triangle.Alternatively, is there a non-degenerate triangle where three sides can be 1? Maybe by adjusting other parameters?Wait, perhaps in a different configuration where the medians are not both 3. Let&#39;s say we have AN=1, KA=1, and MK=1. So AN=1 implies AB=2. KA=1 implies AC=2. MK=1 implies that (1/3)BK=1 =&gt; BK=3. So we need a triangle with AB=2, AC=2, and median BK=3. Using the median length formula:m_b = (1/2)sqrt(2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)=3Plugging AB=2, AC=2:(1/2)sqrt(2*(4) + 2BC² -4)=3 =&gt; sqrt(8 + 2BC² -4)=6 =&gt;sqrt(4 + 2BC²)=6 =&gt;4 +2BC²=36 =&gt;2BC²=32 =&gt;BC²=16 =&gt;BC=4.Again, BC=4, which makes AB + AC=4, leading to degenerate triangle.Therefore, it&#39;s impossible. Hence, three sides cannot be achieved in a valid triangle.Thus, the maximum number is two. Therefore, the answer is boxed{2}.Final Answerboxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;In triangle ( mathrm{ABC} ), medians ( mathrm{BK} ) and ( mathrm{CN} ) intersect at the centroid ( mathrm{M} ). We need to determine the maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ( mathrm{ANMK} ) that can have a length of 1.1. Properties of Medians and Centroid:   - The centroid ( mathrm{M} ) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1.   - ( mathrm{AN} ) is half of ( mathrm{AB} ), ( mathrm{KA} ) is half of ( mathrm{AC} ), ( mathrm{NM} ) is one-third of ( mathrm{CN} ), and ( mathrm{MK} ) is one-third of ( mathrm{BK} ).2. Coordinate System and Equations:   - Placing ( mathrm{A} ) at ( (0, 0) ), ( mathrm{B} ) at ( (2b, 0) ), and ( mathrm{C} ) at ( (2c, 2d) ).   - Midpoints ( mathrm{N} ) and ( mathrm{K} ) are ( (b, 0) ) and ( (c, d) ), respectively.   - Centroid ( mathrm{M} ) is ( left( frac{2b + 2c}{3}, frac{2d}{3} right) ).3. Key Equations:   - ( mathrm{AN} = b )   - ( mathrm{NM} = frac{1}{3} sqrt{(-b + 2c)^2 + (2d)^2} )   - ( mathrm{MK} = frac{1}{3} sqrt{(c - 2b)^2 + d^2} )   - ( mathrm{KA} = sqrt{c^2 + d^2} )4. Checking Combinations:   - Setting all four sides to 1 leads to degenerate triangles.   - Setting three sides to 1 also leads to degenerate triangles.   - Setting two sides to 1 (e.g., ( mathrm{AN} = 1 ) and ( mathrm{KA} = 1 )) can be achieved in a non-degenerate triangle, such as an isosceles triangle with ( mathrm{AB} = 2 ), ( mathrm{AC} = 2 ), and ( mathrm{BC} = 2 ).5. Conclusion:   - The maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ( mathrm{ANMK} ) that can have a length of 1 in a non-degenerate triangle is 2.[boxed{2}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ANMK in triangle ABC where medians BK and CN intersect at M, that can have a length of 1. Let me start by recalling some properties of medians in a triangle.First, medians intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So in this case, point M is the centroid of triangle ABC. That means BM:MK = 2:1 and CM:MN = 2:1, right?Quadrilateral ANMK has four sides: AN, NK, KM, and MA. Wait, actually, let me make sure I have the quadrilateral right. The vertices are A, N, M, K. So the sides are AN, NM, MK, and KA. Hmm, no, wait. Let me visualize the triangle ABC with medians BK and CN intersecting at M.Let me sketch this mentally. Let&#39;s say triangle ABC. Median BK connects vertex B to the midpoint K of side AC, and median CN connects vertex C to the midpoint N of side AB. These two medians intersect at the centroid M. So quadrilateral ANMK is formed by the points A, N, M, K. So the sides should be AN, NM, MK, and KA. Wait, is that correct?Wait, point A is connected to N, which is the midpoint of AB. Then N is connected to M (the centroid), then M is connected to K (the midpoint of AC), and then K back to A. So yes, sides AN, NM, MK, KA.So the question is asking for the maximum number of these four sides that can be equal to 1. So we need to see how many of AN, NM, MK, KA can be 1. The answer would be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But they are asking for the maximum possible.First, let&#39;s note the lengths:- AN: Since N is the midpoint of AB, AN = (1/2)AB.- NM: This is a segment from the midpoint of AB to the centroid. The centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio. Since CN is the median from C to N (midpoint of AB), then CM:MN = 2:1. Therefore, MN = (1/3)CN. So if CN is the length of the median from C to AB, then NM is one-third of that.- MK: Similarly, MK is part of the median BK. Since M is the centroid, BM:MK = 2:1. So MK = (1/3)BK.- KA: K is the midpoint of AC, so KA = (1/2)AC.So, to have these sides equal to 1, we need to set up equations:1. AN = 1: So (1/2)AB = 1 ⇒ AB = 2.2. NM = 1: Since NM = (1/3)CN ⇒ CN = 3.3. MK = 1: MK = (1/3)BK ⇒ BK = 3.4. KA = 1: (1/2)AC = 1 ⇒ AC = 2.So, the problem reduces to constructing triangle ABC such that AB = 2, AC = 2, and medians BK and CN are each of length 3. Then quadrilateral ANMK would have all four sides equal to 1. But is such a triangle possible?Wait, maybe not. Because in a triangle, the lengths of the medians are related to the sides of the triangle. There&#39;s a formula for the length of a median in terms of the sides. Let me recall that.The formula for the length of a median from vertex B to side AC (which is BK in this case) is:BK² = (2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4Similarly, the median from C to AB (CN):CN² = (2AC² + 2BC² - AB²)/4Given that AB = 2 and AC = 2, let&#39;s substitute these into the formulas.First, BK² = (2*(2)² + 2BC² - (2)²)/4 = (8 + 2BC² - 4)/4 = (4 + 2BC²)/4 = (2 + BC²)/2Given that BK = 3, so BK² = 9. Therefore:(2 + BC²)/2 = 9 ⇒ 2 + BC² = 18 ⇒ BC² = 16 ⇒ BC = 4.Similarly, compute CN². Since AB = 2, AC = 2, and BC = 4.CN² = (2*(2)² + 2*(4)² - (2)²)/4 = (8 + 32 - 4)/4 = 36/4 = 9 ⇒ CN = 3. So that works.Wait, so if we set AB = 2, AC = 2, BC = 4, then medians BK and CN are each 3. Then quadrilateral ANMK would have sides:AN = 1, NM = 1, MK = 1, KA = 1. So all four sides equal to 1. Is that possible?Wait, but hold on. If BC is 4, then in triangle ABC, sides AB = 2, AC = 2, BC = 4. But in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. AB + AC = 2 + 2 = 4, which is equal to BC. That means the triangle is degenerate; it&#39;s a straight line. So triangle ABC would collapse into a straight line with B and C 4 units apart, and A somewhere in between. But in that case, the medians would also collapse. So this is not a valid triangle.Therefore, such a triangle cannot exist. Therefore, having all four sides of quadrilateral ANMK equal to 1 is impossible.So the maximum number can&#39;t be 4. Let&#39;s check if 3 is possible.To have three sides of ANMK equal to 1. Let&#39;s see which combinations are possible.Case 1: AN = 1, NM = 1, MK = 1, but KA ≠ 1.Case 2: AN = 1, NM = 1, KA = 1, but MK ≠ 1.Case 3: AN = 1, MK = 1, KA = 1, but NM ≠ 1.Case 4: NM = 1, MK = 1, KA = 1, but AN ≠ 1.So we need to check each case.Let me start with Case 1: AN = 1, NM = 1, MK = 1.From AN = 1 ⇒ AB = 2.From NM = 1 ⇒ CN = 3.From MK = 1 ⇒ BK = 3.So as before, but KA is (1/2)AC. So KA is not 1, so AC ≠ 2. So AC is something else.So in this case, AB = 2, CN = 3 (median from C), BK = 3 (median from B). Let&#39;s see if such a triangle exists.We need to find sides AB = 2, and medians CN = 3 and BK = 3. Let&#39;s use the median formulas.Let me denote the sides:Let AB = c = 2, BC = a, AC = b.Then the median from B to AC (BK) is:BK² = (2c² + 2a² - b²)/4 = (8 + 2a² - b²)/4 = (2a² - b² + 8)/4 = 9 (since BK = 3).Similarly, the median from C to AB (CN):CN² = (2b² + 2a² - c²)/4 = (2b² + 2a² - 4)/4 = (2a² + 2b² - 4)/4 = 9.So we have two equations:1. 2a² - b² + 8 = 36 ⇒ 2a² - b² = 28.2. 2a² + 2b² - 4 = 36 ⇒ 2a² + 2b² = 40 ⇒ a² + b² = 20.Now we can solve these equations:From equation 1: 2a² - b² = 28.From equation 2: a² + b² = 20.Let me add 2*(equation 2) to equation 1:2a² - b² + 2a² + 2b² = 28 + 40 ⇒ 4a² + b² = 68. Wait, but equation 1 is 2a² - b² = 28, and equation 2 is a² + b² = 20.Wait, perhaps solving the two equations:Equation 1: 2a² - b² = 28Equation 2: a² + b² = 20Let me add them:3a² = 48 ⇒ a² = 16 ⇒ a = 4.Then from equation 2: 16 + b² = 20 ⇒ b² = 4 ⇒ b = 2.So sides would be AB = 2, BC = 4, AC = 2. But again, this gives AB + AC = 4, which equals BC, leading to a degenerate triangle. So this is impossible.Therefore, Case 1 is invalid.Case 2: AN = 1, NM = 1, KA = 1.So AN = 1 ⇒ AB = 2.KA = 1 ⇒ AC = 2.NM = 1 ⇒ CN = 3.So here, AB = AC = 2, and CN = 3.So triangle ABC has AB = 2, AC = 2, and median CN = 3. Let&#39;s check if such a triangle is possible.Again, using the median formula:CN² = (2AC² + 2BC² - AB²)/4Given AC = 2, AB = 2, CN = 3.So CN² = (2*(4) + 2BC² - 4)/4 = (8 + 2BC² - 4)/4 = (4 + 2BC²)/4 = (2 + BC²)/2 = 9 ⇒ 2 + BC² = 18 ⇒ BC² = 16 ⇒ BC = 4.Again, BC = 4, AB = AC = 2, so AB + AC = 4 = BC, degenerate triangle. Not possible.Case 3: AN = 1, MK = 1, KA = 1.So AN = 1 ⇒ AB = 2.KA = 1 ⇒ AC = 2.MK = 1 ⇒ BK = 3.So similar to Case 1, triangle with AB = 2, AC = 2, and median BK = 3. Which as before, gives BC = 4, degenerate.Case 4: NM = 1, MK = 1, KA = 1.So NM = 1 ⇒ CN = 3.MK = 1 ⇒ BK = 3.KA = 1 ⇒ AC = 2.So in this case, AC = 2, and medians CN and BK are both 3. Let&#39;s check if such a triangle exists.Let AB = c, BC = a, AC = 2.Median from B to AC (BK):BK² = (2c² + 2a² - 4)/4 = 9 ⇒ 2c² + 2a² - 4 = 36 ⇒ 2c² + 2a² = 40 ⇒ c² + a² = 20.Median from C to AB (CN):CN² = (2*(2)² + 2a² - c²)/4 = (8 + 2a² - c²)/4 = 9 ⇒ 8 + 2a² - c² = 36 ⇒ 2a² - c² = 28.So we have:From BK: c² + a² = 20.From CN: 2a² - c² = 28.Let me add these two equations:( c² + a² ) + (2a² - c² ) = 20 + 28 ⇒ 3a² = 48 ⇒ a² = 16 ⇒ a = 4.Then from c² + a² = 20 ⇒ c² = 20 - 16 = 4 ⇒ c = 2.Thus, AB = 2, BC = 4, AC = 2. Again, degenerate. So no good.Therefore, all cases where three sides are 1 lead to a degenerate triangle. Therefore, three sides is impossible.Now check if two sides can be 1. Let&#39;s consider different pairs.Possible pairs:1. AN = 1 and NM = 1.2. AN = 1 and MK = 1.3. AN = 1 and KA = 1.4. NM = 1 and MK = 1.5. NM = 1 and KA = 1.6. MK = 1 and KA = 1.We need to check which pairs can coexist without causing the triangle to be degenerate.Let me try pair 1: AN = 1 and NM = 1.AN = 1 ⇒ AB = 2.NM = 1 ⇒ CN = 3.So triangle with AB = 2, and median CN = 3. Let&#39;s see if such a triangle can exist.Using the median formula again:CN² = (2AC² + 2BC² - AB²)/4 = 9.AB = 2, so:(2AC² + 2BC² - 4)/4 = 9 ⇒ 2AC² + 2BC² = 40 ⇒ AC² + BC² = 20.But we have no other constraints. So AC and BC can be any lengths such that their squares sum to 20. For example, AC = 4, BC = 2. But we need to make sure that triangle inequality holds.Wait, but if AC and BC can vary as long as AC² + BC² = 20, then there are non-degenerate triangles possible.For example, take AC = 4, BC² = 20 - 16 = 4 ⇒ BC = 2. Then triangle ABC has sides AB=2, BC=2, AC=4. But again, AB + BC = 4 = AC, which is degenerate.Alternatively, take AC = 3, BC² = 20 - 9 = 11 ⇒ BC ≈ 3.316. Then check triangle inequalities:AB + BC &gt; AC: 2 + 3.316 &gt; 3 ⇒ 5.316 &gt; 3 ✔️AB + AC &gt; BC: 2 + 3 &gt; 3.316 ⇒ 5 &gt; 3.316 ✔️BC + AC &gt; AB: 3.316 + 3 &gt; 2 ✔️So yes, such a triangle exists. So in this case, AB = 2, CN = 3 (so NM = 1), and AN = 1. Then what about MK and KA?MK is part of the median BK. Since we have triangle ABC with AB = 2, AC = 3, BC ≈ 3.316. Let&#39;s compute the length of median BK.Using the formula:BK² = (2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4 = (8 + 2*(11) - 9)/4 = (8 + 22 - 9)/4 = 21/4 ⇒ BK = √(21)/2 ≈ 2.291. Then MK = (1/3)BK ≈ 0.764, which is not 1. Similarly, KA = (1/2)AC = 1.5, which is not 1.Therefore, in this case, only AN and NM are 1. The other sides MK and KA are not. So this pair is possible, but only two sides.But the problem asks for the maximum number of sides. So maybe another pair allows two sides, but with other pairs?Let&#39;s check pair 3: AN = 1 and KA = 1.AN = 1 ⇒ AB = 2.KA = 1 ⇒ AC = 2.So triangle ABC has AB = 2, AC = 2. Let it be an isoceles triangle with AB = AC = 2. Then medians BK and CN.In an isoceles triangle with AB = AC, the medians from B and C should be equal? Wait, no. Wait, BK is the median from B to AC, and CN is the median from C to AB. In an isoceles triangle with AB = AC, the medians from B and C might not be equal. Wait, let&#39;s compute them.Let me assume ABC is isoceles with AB = AC = 2. Let BC = x.Then the median from B to AC (BK) can be calculated:In an isoceles triangle, the median from B to AC is also the altitude and angle bisector. Wait, no. Wait, in an isoceles triangle with AB = AC, the median from B would be to the midpoint of AC. Similarly, the median from C would be to the midpoint of AB. Since AB = AC, but the medians to the other sides are different.Wait, perhaps in this case, the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC = 2. Let me compute the medians BK and CN.Let me compute the coordinates. Let’s place point A at (0,0), B at (b, c), and C at (-b, c) to make AB = AC = 2. Then midpoint of AB is N = (b/2, c/2), and midpoint of AC is K = (-b/2, c/2). The centroid M is the average of the vertices: ((0 + b - b)/3, (0 + c + c)/3) = (0, 2c/3).Compute the length AN: distance from A(0,0) to N(b/2, c/2). That&#39;s sqrt( (b/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 ) = (1/2)sqrt(b² + c²). Since AB = 2, sqrt(b² + c²) = 2, so AN = (1/2)*2 = 1. So AN = 1 as expected.KA is the distance from K(-b/2, c/2) to A(0,0): sqrt( (b/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 ) = 1, which is given.Now compute NM: distance from N(b/2, c/2) to M(0, 2c/3). Coordinates: x: b/2 - 0 = b/2, y: c/2 - 2c/3 = (3c/6 - 4c/6) = -c/6.So NM = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + (-c/6)^2 ) = sqrt( b²/4 + c²/36 ).Similarly, MK: distance from M(0, 2c/3) to K(-b/2, c/2). Coordinates: x: -b/2 - 0 = -b/2, y: c/2 - 2c/3 = -c/6.So MK = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + (c/6)^2 ) = sqrt( b²/4 + c²/36 ). So NM and MK are equal.So in this isoceles triangle, sides NM and MK are equal. Let&#39;s compute their lengths.Since AB = 2, coordinates of B are (b, c), so AB distance: sqrt(b² + c²) = 2. Also, BC = x, distance from B(b, c) to C(-b, c): sqrt( (2b)^2 + 0 ) = 2b. So BC = 2b. So x = 2b.Thus, in terms of x (BC = x), we have AB = 2, BC = x, AC = 2.Now, medians BK and CN.Wait, in coordinates, the centroid M is at (0, 2c/3). The median BK is from B(b, c) to K(-b/2, c/2). Let&#39;s compute its length.BK: sqrt( (b + b/2)^2 + (c - c/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (3b/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 ) = (1/2)sqrt(9b² + c²).Similarly, median CN is from C(-b, c) to N(b/2, c/2). Its length is sqrt( (-b - b/2)^2 + (c - c/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (-3b/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 ) = same as BK: (1/2)sqrt(9b² + c²). So in this isoceles triangle, medians BK and CN are equal.But in our case, AB = AC = 2, so b and c satisfy sqrt(b² + c²) = 2. Let&#39;s express c² = 4 - b².So median BK length is (1/2)sqrt(9b² + 4 - b²) = (1/2)sqrt(8b² + 4) = (1/2)sqrt(4(2b² + 1)) = sqrt(2b² + 1).Therefore, MK is (1/3)*BK = (1/3)sqrt(2b² + 1).Similarly, NM = sqrt( b²/4 + c²/36 ) = sqrt( b²/4 + (4 - b²)/36 ) = sqrt( 9b²/36 + (4 - b²)/36 ) = sqrt( (8b² + 4)/36 ) = sqrt( (8b² + 4)/36 ) = sqrt( (4(2b² + 1))/36 ) = (2/6)sqrt(2b² + 1) = (1/3)sqrt(2b² + 1). So yes, NM = MK.So in this configuration, if we set AN = 1 and KA = 1 (AB = AC = 2), then NM and MK are equal. So if we can make NM = MK = 1, that would give two more sides of 1. But in our previous calculation, NM = MK = (1/3)sqrt(2b² + 1). To set this equal to 1:(1/3)sqrt(2b² + 1) = 1 ⇒ sqrt(2b² + 1) = 3 ⇒ 2b² + 1 = 9 ⇒ 2b² = 8 ⇒ b² = 4 ⇒ b = 2.But if b = 2, then from AB = sqrt(b² + c²) = 2 ⇒ sqrt(4 + c²) = 2 ⇒ c² = 0 ⇒ c = 0.But then points B and C would be at (2, 0) and (-2, 0), making triangle ABC with points A(0,0), B(2,0), C(-2,0). This is a degenerate triangle with all points on the x-axis. So again, degenerate. Hence, even trying to set NM and MK to 1 leads to a degenerate triangle.But if we don&#39;t set NM and MK to 1, but just have AN and KA as 1, then BC can be non-degenerate. Wait, but in this case, AB = AC = 2, and BC is variable. For example, take BC = 3. Then we can compute b and c.If BC = 3, then x = 3. So BC = 2b = 3 ⇒ b = 3/2. Then c² = 4 - b² = 4 - 9/4 = 7/4 ⇒ c = sqrt(7)/2.Then medians BK and CN have length sqrt(2b² + 1) = sqrt(2*(9/4) + 1) = sqrt(9/2 + 1) = sqrt(11/2) ≈ 2.345. Then MK = (1/3)*sqrt(11/2) ≈ 0.781, which is not 1. Similarly, NM = same as MK. So even with BC = 3, we can&#39;t get NM or MK to be 1. So in this case, only AN and KA are 1.Therefore, pair 3 (AN=1, KA=1) gives two sides of 1, and the other two sides (NM, MK) not 1, but triangle is non-degenerate. So that&#39;s possible.Alternatively, check pair 4: NM = 1 and MK = 1. Since in the isoceles case, NM and MK are equal. If we set NM = MK = 1, then as before, leads to degenerate triangle. But if not isoceles?Wait, if triangle is not isoceles, can we have NM and MK both equal to 1?From NM = 1 ⇒ CN = 3.From MK = 1 ⇒ BK = 3.So similar to previous cases where both medians are 3. Let&#39;s see if we can find a non-degenerate triangle with medians CN and BK equal to 3, but without AB and AC being 2.Wait, let me denote the sides:Let’s let AB = c, BC = a, AC = b.Medians:BK² = (2c² + 2a² - b²)/4 = 9.CN² = (2b² + 2a² - c²)/4 = 9.So equations:2c² + 2a² - b² = 362b² + 2a² - c² = 36Subtract the two equations:(2c² + 2a² - b²) - (2b² + 2a² - c²) = 0 ⇒ 3c² - 3b² = 0 ⇒ c² = b² ⇒ c = b.So AB = AC. Therefore, triangle is isoceles with AB = AC.Then, plugging back into one of the equations:2c² + 2a² - c² = 36 ⇒ c² + 2a² = 36.But AB = AC = c, BC = a.Triangle inequality: AB + AC &gt; BC ⇒ 2c &gt; a.Also, from the median formula:We have c² + 2a² = 36.Let’s express a² = (36 - c²)/2.Since a must be positive, 36 - c² &gt; 0 ⇒ c² &lt; 36 ⇒ c &lt; 6.Also, from triangle inequality, 2c &gt; a ⇒ 2c &gt; sqrt( (36 - c²)/2 ).Let me square both sides:4c² &gt; (36 - c²)/2 ⇒ 8c² &gt; 36 - c² ⇒ 9c² &gt; 36 ⇒ c² &gt; 4 ⇒ c &gt; 2.So c is between 2 and 6.Let’s pick c = 4, then a² = (36 - 16)/2 = 10 ⇒ a = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162.Check triangle inequalities:AB + AC = 8 &gt; BC ≈ 3.162 ✔️AB + BC ≈ 4 + 3.162 = 7.162 &gt; AC = 4 ✔️AC + BC ≈ same as above ✔️So such a triangle exists. For example, AB = AC = 4, BC = sqrt(10).Then, medians BK and CN are 3 each.Compute AN and KA.AN = (1/2)AB = 2.KA = (1/2)AC = 2.So quadrilateral ANMK has sides AN=2, NM=1, MK=1, KA=2. So two sides of length 1, and two sides of length 2. Therefore, maximum number here is 2.But in this case, AN and KA are 2, not 1. So this is a different case. The sides NM and MK are 1, but AN and KA are not.Therefore, if we set medians BK and CN to 3 (so that NM and MK are 1), then AN and KA depend on AB and AC. If AB and AC are not 2, then AN and KA are not 1. So in this case, only two sides (NM and MK) are 1. So this is another way to have two sides of 1.Therefore, in this non-isoceles triangle, we can have two sides of 1. But we can&#39;t have more.Another pair: pair 2: AN = 1 and MK = 1.AN = 1 ⇒ AB = 2.MK = 1 ⇒ BK = 3.So need triangle with AB = 2, median BK = 3. Let’s compute possible sides.Using the median formula:BK² = (2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4 = 9.Given AB = 2:(8 + 2BC² - AC²)/4 = 9 ⇒ 8 + 2BC² - AC² = 36 ⇒ 2BC² - AC² = 28.We need another equation. Let’s assume AC is some length. Let’s denote AC = x, BC = y.So 2y² - x² = 28.But also, triangle inequalities must hold: AB + BC &gt; AC ⇒ 2 + y &gt; x.AB + AC &gt; BC ⇒ 2 + x &gt; y.BC + AC &gt; AB ⇒ y + x &gt; 2.We need to find real numbers x, y &gt; 0 such that 2y² - x² = 28 and the triangle inequalities hold.Let’s express x² = 2y² - 28. So x = sqrt(2y² - 28). Therefore, 2y² - 28 ≥ 0 ⇒ y² ≥ 14 ⇒ y ≥ sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417.Now check triangle inequalities:1. 2 + y &gt; x ⇒ 2 + y &gt; sqrt(2y² - 28).Let’s square both sides (assuming 2 + y &gt; 0, which it is since y ≥ 3.7417):(2 + y)² &gt; 2y² - 28 ⇒ 4 + 4y + y² &gt; 2y² - 28 ⇒ -y² + 4y + 32 &gt; 0 ⇒ y² - 4y - 32 &lt; 0.Solve y² -4y -32 = 0 ⇒ y = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 128)]/2 = [4 ± sqrt(144)]/2 = [4 ± 12]/2 ⇒ y = 8 or y = -4. So the inequality holds for -4 &lt; y &lt; 8. But since y ≥ sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417, the valid interval is sqrt(14) ≤ y &lt; 8.Second inequality: 2 + x &gt; y. With x = sqrt(2y² -28):2 + sqrt(2y² -28) &gt; y.Let’s rearrange: sqrt(2y² -28) &gt; y - 2.Since sqrt(2y² -28) is non-negative, the RHS y - 2 must be less than sqrt(2y² -28). If y - 2 ≤ 0, then inequality holds automatically. If y - 2 &gt; 0, i.e., y &gt; 2, which is true since y ≥ sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417, then we can square both sides:2y² -28 &gt; (y -2)² ⇒ 2y² -28 &gt; y² -4y +4 ⇒ y² +4y -32 &gt; 0.Solve y² +4y -32 =0 ⇒ y = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 128)]/2 = [-4 ± sqrt(144)]/2 = [-4 ± 12]/2 ⇒ y= (8)/2=4 or y= (-16)/2=-8. The inequality holds for y &lt; -8 or y &gt;4. Since y ≥ sqrt(14) ≈3.7417 and y &lt;8, then the inequality holds when y &gt;4.Therefore, combining with previous interval, sqrt(14) ≤ y &lt;8, but the inequality 2 + x &gt; y holds when y &gt;4.Thus, for y &gt;4, both inequalities 2 + y &gt; x and 2 + x &gt; y hold.Third inequality: y + x &gt;2. Since y ≥ sqrt(14) and x = sqrt(2y² -28), which is also significant, so this holds.Therefore, possible values of y are (4,8). Let’s pick y=5.Then x²=2*25 -28=50-28=22 ⇒x= sqrt(22)≈4.690.Check triangle inequalities:AB=2, BC=5, AC≈4.690.AB + BC =7 &gt; AC≈4.690 ✔️AB + AC≈6.690 &gt; BC=5 ✔️BC + AC≈9.690 &gt; AB=2 ✔️So such a triangle exists.In this triangle, AN=1 (since AB=2), MK=1 (since BK=3). Now, what about NM and KA?NM is part of the median CN. Let&#39;s compute CN.Using the median formula:CN²=(2AC² + 2BC² - AB²)/4=(2*(22) + 2*25 -4)/4=(44 +50 -4)/4=90/4=22.5 ⇒ CN= sqrt(22.5)= approximately 4.743.Thus, NM=(1/3)CN≈1.581, which is not 1.KA=(1/2)AC≈2.345, not 1.Therefore, in this case, only AN and MK are 1. So two sides.Similarly, if I pick another y, say y=6.x²=2*36 -28=72-28=44⇒x≈6.633.Check triangle inequalities:AB=2, BC=6, AC≈6.633.AB + BC=8 &gt; AC≈6.633 ✔️AB + AC≈8.633 &gt; BC=6 ✔️BC + AC≈12.633 &gt; AB=2 ✔️Compute CN:CN²=(2*44 +2*36 -4)/4=(88 +72 -4)/4=156/4=39⇒CN≈6.245.Thus, NM=(1/3)*6.245≈2.082, not 1.KA=(1/2)*6.633≈3.316, not 1.So again, only AN and MK are 1.Therefore, pair 2 (AN=1, MK=1) gives two sides of 1. Similarly, pair 5 or 6 might also give two sides.Pair 5: NM=1 and KA=1.NM=1⇒CN=3.KA=1⇒AC=2.Need to construct triangle with AC=2, median CN=3.Using the median formula:CN²=(2AC² +2BC² -AB²)/4=9.AC=2, so:(8 +2BC² -AB²)/4=9 ⇒8 +2BC² -AB²=36⇒2BC² -AB²=28.Let’s denote AB=c, BC=a.So 2a² -c²=28.But we also have triangle inequalities:AB + BC &gt; AC ⇒c +a &gt;2.AB + AC &gt; BC ⇒c +2 &gt;a.BC + AC &gt; AB ⇒a +2 &gt;c.We need to find real numbers a,c&gt;0 satisfying 2a² -c²=28 and triangle inequalities.Let’s express c²=2a² -28. Therefore, c= sqrt(2a² -28). Therefore, 2a² -28 ≥0 ⇒a²≥14 ⇒a≥sqrt(14)≈3.7417.Now check triangle inequalities:1. c +a &gt;2: sqrt(2a² -28) +a &gt;2. Which is certainly true since a≥sqrt(14)≈3.7417.2. c +2 &gt;a ⇒ sqrt(2a² -28) +2 &gt;a.Let’s rearrange: sqrt(2a² -28) &gt;a -2.If a -2 ≤0, i.e., a ≤2, which is not possible since a≥sqrt(14). So a -2 &gt;0. Square both sides:2a² -28 &gt; (a -2)^2 ⇒2a² -28 &gt;a² -4a +4 ⇒a² +4a -32 &gt;0.Solve a² +4a -32=0⇒a=(-4±sqrt(16+128))/2=(-4±sqrt(144))/2=(-4±12)/2⇒a= (8)/2=4 or a=(-16)/2=-8.So inequality holds for a &gt;4 or a &lt; -8. Since a≥sqrt(14)≈3.7417, the inequality holds when a &gt;4.Third inequality: a +2 &gt;c ⇒a +2 &gt;sqrt(2a² -28).Square both sides:(a +2)^2 &gt;2a² -28⇒a² +4a +4&gt;2a² -28⇒ -a² +4a +32&gt;0⇒a² -4a -32&lt;0.Solve a² -4a -32=0⇒a=(4±sqrt(16+128))/2=(4±12)/2⇒a=8 or a=-4. So inequality holds for -4 &lt;a &lt;8. But a≥sqrt(14)≈3.7417, so the inequality holds for 3.7417 ≤a &lt;8.Therefore, combining the conditions for the second inequality: a &gt;4. So overall, a is in (4,8).Let’s pick a=5:c= sqrt(2*25 -28)=sqrt(50-28)=sqrt(22)≈4.690.Check triangle inequalities:AB≈4.690, BC=5, AC=2.AB + BC≈9.690 &gt; AC=2 ✔️AB + AC≈6.690 &gt; BC=5 ✔️BC + AC=7 &gt; AB≈4.690 ✔️So triangle is valid.Compute AN and MK.AN=(1/2)AB≈2.345, not 1.MK=(1/3)BK. Need to compute BK.Using median formula:BK²=(2AB² +2BC² -AC²)/4=(2*(22) +2*25 -4)/4=(44 +50 -4)/4=90/4=22.5⇒BK≈4.743. So MK≈1.581, not 1.Thus, only NM=1 and KA=1. But NM=1 comes from CN=3, and KA=1 from AC=2. So two sides.Therefore, pair 5 gives two sides of 1.Similarly, pair 6: MK=1 and KA=1.MK=1⇒BK=3.KA=1⇒AC=2.So similar to previous case, but with MK=1 and KA=1. Let&#39;s see.So need triangle with AC=2, median BK=3.Using the median formula:BK²=(2AB² +2BC² -AC²)/4=9.AC=2, so:(2AB² +2BC² -4)/4=9⇒2AB² +2BC²=40⇒AB² + BC²=20.Also, triangle inequalities:AB + BC &gt; AC=2.AB + AC &gt; BC.BC + AC &gt; AB.Let AB=x, BC=y.So x² + y²=20.Need x,y&gt;0, x+y&gt;2, x+2&gt;y, y+2&gt;x.Let’s parametrize x and y such that x² + y²=20.Possible solutions: For example, x=4, y=2⇒x²+y²=16+4=20. But check triangle inequalities:AB=4, BC=2, AC=2.AB + BC=6&gt;2 ✔️AB + AC=6&gt;2 ✔️BC + AC=4&gt;4 ⇒ not greater. So degenerate.Another example, x= sqrt(10)≈3.16, y= sqrt(10)≈3.16. Then x² + y²=10+10=20.Check triangle inequalities:AB + BC≈6.32&gt;2 ✔️AB + AC≈3.16+2=5.16&gt;3.16 ✔️BC + AC≈5.16&gt;3.16 ✔️Valid triangle.Compute CN and NM.CN is the median from C to AB. Let’s compute CN²=(2AC² +2BC² -AB²)/4=(2*4 +2*10 -10)/4=(8 +20 -10)/4=18/4=4.5⇒CN≈2.121. Therefore, NM=(1/3)CN≈0.707, not 1.KA=1, MK=1.Wait, but in this case, MK=(1/3)BK. BK=3, so MK=1. But in this case, BK=3? Wait, we set BK=3 via the median formula. Wait, in this case, BK=3, which is satisfied. So in this triangle, AB= sqrt(10), BC= sqrt(10), AC=2.Then AN=(1/2)AB≈1.58, not 1.NM≈0.707, not 1.MK=1, KA=1. So sides MK and KA are 1. Thus, two sides.So pair 6 gives two sides of 1.Therefore, multiple pairs can give two sides equal to 1. So the maximum number is 2. But wait, let me check if there is a way to have three sides of 1 by combining different conditions.For example, suppose we set AN=1, KA=1, and either NM=1 or MK=1. But as shown earlier, trying to set three sides leads to degenerate triangle.Alternatively, perhaps another configuration where three sides are 1 without the triangle being degenerate. Let&#39;s think.Suppose we relax the conditions. Let me consider a triangle where AN=1, KA=1, and NM=1. But as shown earlier, this requires AB=2, AC=2, and CN=3. Which leads to BC=4, degenerate.Alternatively, if we don&#39;t enforce AB and AC to be 2, but find some other way.Wait, perhaps if the triangle is not isoceles. For example, suppose AN=1, KA=1, and NM=1. Then AB=2, AC=2, and CN=3. Which as before, requires BC=4, degenerate.Alternatively, if AN=1, NM=1, and MK=1. Then AB=2, CN=3, BK=3. As before, leads to BC=4, which is degenerate.Similarly for other triples.Therefore, it seems that trying to have three sides of 1 always leads to a degenerate triangle. Hence, the maximum number is 2.But wait, in the isoceles case, if we set AB=AC=2*sqrt(2), BC=4. Then check the triangle:AB=AC=2*sqrt(2)≈2.828, BC=4. Then AB + AC≈5.656&gt;4 ✔️Then compute medians.Median BK²=(2AB² +2BC² -AC²)/4=(2*8 +2*16 -8)/4=(16 +32 -8)/4=40/4=10⇒BK=sqrt(10)≈3.162. Therefore, MK=(1/3)*sqrt(10)≈1.054, close to 1 but not exactly.But even adjusting AB and AC to get MK=1. Let’s suppose AB=AC=x, BC=4.Then median BK²=(2x² +2*16 -x²)/4=(x² +32)/4=9⇒x² +32=36⇒x²=4⇒x=2. Then AB=AC=2, BC=4, degenerate.So no good.Alternatively, if we take BC=3, as before.But in that case, medians are longer, so MK is about 0.764, not 1.Alternatively, perhaps use another triangle configuration.Wait, maybe coordinate geometry.Let’s place point A at (0,0), point B at (2,0), so AB=2. Let’s let point N be the midpoint of AB, so N=(1,0).Let’s let point C be (p,q). Then midpoint K of AC is (p/2, q/2).Centroid M is the average of A, B, C: ( (0 + 2 + p)/3, (0 + 0 + q)/3 )= ((2 + p)/3, q/3).Then compute lengths:AN= distance from A(0,0) to N(1,0)=1, which is given.KA= distance from K(p/2, q/2) to A(0,0)=sqrt( (p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 )= (1/2)sqrt(p² + q²). So KA=1 ⇒ sqrt(p² + q²)=2 ⇒ p² + q²=4.NM= distance from N(1,0) to M( (2 + p)/3, q/3 ). Coordinates difference: x= (2 + p)/3 -1= (2 + p -3)/3=(p -1)/3, y= q/3 -0= q/3. So NM= sqrt( (p -1)^2/9 + q²/9 )= (1/3)sqrt( (p -1)^2 + q² ). Set NM=1 ⇒ sqrt( (p -1)^2 + q² )=3 ⇒ (p -1)^2 + q²=9.But we have p² + q²=4 from KA=1. Subtract:(p -1)^2 + q² - (p² + q²)=9 -4 ⇒p² -2p +1 + q² -p² - q²=5 ⇒-2p +1=5⇒-2p=4⇒p= -2.Then from p² + q²=4: (-2)^2 + q²=4⇒4 + q²=4⇒q²=0⇒q=0. So point C is (-2,0). But then ABC is a degenerate triangle with points A(0,0), B(2,0), C(-2,0). So AB + AC=4=BC, which is degenerate.Therefore, even with coordinate geometry, setting AN=1, KA=1, NM=1 leads to degenerate triangle.Thus, no way to have three sides.Therefore, the maximum number is 2.Final AnswerThe maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ANMK that can have a length of 1 is boxed{2}.&lt;/think&gt;In triangle ( mathrm{ABC} ), medians ( mathrm{BK} ) and ( mathrm{CN} ) intersect at the centroid ( mathrm{M} ). We need to determine the maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ( mathrm{ANMK} ) that can have a length of 1.1. Properties of Medians and Centroid:   - The centroid ( mathrm{M} ) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1.   - ( mathrm{AN} = frac{1}{2} mathrm{AB} ), ( mathrm{KA} = frac{1}{2} mathrm{AC} ).   - ( mathrm{NM} = frac{1}{3} mathrm{CN} ), ( mathrm{MK} = frac{1}{3} mathrm{BK} ).2. Key Equations:   - For ( mathrm{AN} = 1 ), ( mathrm{AB} = 2 ).   - For ( mathrm{KA} = 1 ), ( mathrm{AC} = 2 ).   - For ( mathrm{NM} = 1 ), ( mathrm{CN} = 3 ).   - For ( mathrm{MK} = 1 ), ( mathrm{BK} = 3 ).3. Checking Degenerate Triangles:   - Setting ( mathrm{AB} = 2 ), ( mathrm{AC} = 2 ), and medians ( mathrm{BK} = 3 ), ( mathrm{CN} = 3 ) leads to a degenerate triangle with ( mathrm{BC} = 4 ).4. Non-Degenerate Triangles:   - Considering different pairs of sides being 1:     - ( mathrm{AN} = 1 ) and ( mathrm{KA} = 1 ) (non-degenerate triangle with ( mathrm{AB} = 2 ), ( mathrm{AC} = 2 ), and other sides calculated).     - Other pairs like ( mathrm{AN} = 1 ), ( mathrm{MK} = 1 ) or ( mathrm{NM} = 1 ), ( mathrm{MK} = 1 ) also lead to non-degenerate triangles but only two sides of length 1.5. Conclusion:   - Any attempt to have three sides of length 1 results in a degenerate triangle.   - The maximum number of sides of quadrilateral ( mathrm{ANMK} ) that can be 1 is 2.[boxed{2}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9524b0db></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9524b0db><span class="icon" data-v-9524b0db>🔑:</span>Method 1. Suppose that at least three sides of the quadrilateral ANMK are equal to 1. There are only two fundamentally different cases. 1) mathrm{AN}=mathrm{NM}=mathrm{MK}=1. Then mathrm{NB}=1, mathrm{MB}=2, so mathrm{MN}+mathrm{NB}=mathrm{MB}. 2) mathrm{KA}=mathrm{AN}=mathrm{NM}=1. Then mathrm{AC}=2, mathrm{NC}=3, so mathrm{NA}+mathrm{AC}=mathrm{NC}. In both cases, a contradiction with the triangle inequality is obtained.Method 2. If more than two sides of the quadrilateral are equal to 1, then either mathrm{AK}=mathrm{NA} or mathrm{KM}=mathrm{MN}. In the first case, triangle ABC is isosceles. In the second case, mathrm{BK}=mathrm{CN}=3, so in this case, triangle ABC is also isosceles. From this, it follows that mathrm{AK}=mathrm{KM}=mathrm{MN}=mathrm{NA}, meaning that AKMN is a rhombus. This is a contradiction, as lines AK and NM are not parallel.Method 3. Let mathrm{L} be the midpoint of side mathrm{BC}. If mathrm{NM}=mathrm{NA}=mathrm{NB}, then triangle AMB is a right triangle.Triangle LMK is similar to triangle AMB with a similarity ratio of 0.5, so MK =mathrm{LM}. Therefore, in triangle AMK, the hypotenuse is larger than in triangle LMK, meaning mathrm{AK}&gt;mathrm{LK}=mathrm{NA}. Thus, in the quadrilateral ANMK, there are no three sides equal to each other.The case when mathrm{KM}=mathrm{KA} is analogous, and if mathrm{KM} neq mathrm{KA} and mathrm{NM} neq mathrm{NA}, then among the segments NM, NA, KM, and KA, there are also no three equal to each other.## Answer2 sides.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-a6ae0be7 data-v-9524b0db><div class="review" data-v-9524b0db><div class="review-title" data-v-9524b0db><span class="icon" data-v-9524b0db>❓:</span>Problem 4.

Hmm, let&#39;s start with part (a). First, the problem states that the cuts are made along the sides of the unit squares, so each square piece must have integer side lengths. An odd square is one where the side length is an odd number. So, we need to divide the 20x19 rectangle into squares, some of which can be even-sized, but we need to minimize the number of odd squares. I remember that in tiling or partitioning problems, especially when dealing with squares, parity can play a role. Since 20 is even and 19 is odd, maybe that affects how we can split the rectangle. Let me think. If we can partition the rectangle into squares with even side lengths, then all those squares would be even, and we wouldn&#39;t have any odd squares. But is that possible? Let me check.The area of the rectangle is 20*19 = 380. If all squares were even-sized, their areas would be even^2 = even. The sum of even areas would be even. However, 380 is also even, so that&#39;s okay. But is there a way to tile the rectangle with only even squares? Wait, tiling with squares of even sizes would require that both the length and width can be expressed as sums of even numbers. The rectangle is 20 units long (even) and 19 units wide (odd). If we start by trying to place an even square along the 19 side, which is odd, that might not work because an even square can&#39;t fit into an odd length without leaving a remainder. For example, if we put a 2x2 square in the 19x20 rectangle, along the 19 side, after placing 2 units, we would have 17 left, which is odd. But 17 is still odd, so if we keep placing even squares, each time we subtract an even number from an odd number, we get another odd number. So eventually, we would have to place an odd square to fill the remaining space. Wait, that seems like a key point. If the side is odd, and we subtract even numbers each time, we can never get rid of the oddness. So along the width of 19, if we try to use even squares, we would end up with a remaining 1 unit at some point, which would have to be a 1x1 square (odd). But 1 is odd, so that would count as an odd square. But the problem is asking for the minimal number of odd squares. So maybe instead of having a 1x1 square, we can have a larger odd square? Hmm. Let&#39;s see. If instead of splitting the 19 into even parts, we split it into an odd part and the rest. For instance, if we take a 19x19 square, but 19 is longer than the other side (20), so that doesn&#39;t fit. Wait, the rectangle is 20x19, so the maximum square we can fit is 19x19. But 19 is odd, so that would be an odd square. If we place a 19x19 square, then the remaining area would be 20*19 - 19*19 = 19*(20 - 19) = 19*1 = 19. So we have a 1x19 strip left. Then we need to divide that into squares. But a 1x19 strip can only be divided into 1x1 squares, which are odd. So we would have 19 of them, making the total number of odd squares 1 (the 19x19) plus 19 (the 1x1s) = 20. That seems like a lot. Definitely not minimal.Alternatively, maybe we can split the rectangle into smaller squares. Let&#39;s think. If we have a 20x19 rectangle, perhaps divide it into two smaller rectangles. For example, split along the length. If we take a 19x19 square (odd) out of the 20x19 rectangle, as before, leaving 1x19. But maybe instead of 19x19, take a smaller odd square. Wait, maybe split the rectangle into a combination of even and odd squares.Alternatively, maybe split the 20x19 into a 20x18 and a 20x1. The 20x18 is even in both dimensions, so maybe we can tile that with even squares, and the 20x1 strip would need to be tiled with 1x1 squares. But 1x1 is odd, so that would result in 20 odd squares. But 20x1 can be split into 20 1x1 squares, each of which is odd. So that would be 20 odd squares. But that&#39;s worse than before.Wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s try to use as few odd squares as possible. Since 19 is odd, perhaps we can have a column of squares along the 19-unit side. If we can split the 20x19 into vertical strips. For instance, split the 20 length into even and odd parts. For example, take 19 as the width, and 20 as the length. Suppose we place an odd square in the corner. Let&#39;s say a 19x19 square, leaving 1x19. But as before, that leaves 1x19. Alternatively, place a smaller odd square.Wait, maybe a 3x3 square? If we place a 3x3 square in the corner, then we have a 3x3 area, and the remaining area would be split into two parts: a 3x16 rectangle (since 19 - 3 = 16) and a 17x19 rectangle (since 20 - 3 = 17). Wait, no. If we place a 3x3 square in the bottom left corner, the remaining area would be a 3x(19 - 3) = 3x16 to the right of it, and a (20 - 3)x19 = 17x19 above it. Hmm, but the 17x19 is still an odd by odd rectangle. Then we would have to deal with that. Maybe place another odd square there? Let&#39;s see. If we place a 17x17 square in the 17x19 area, leaving a 17x2 strip. Then the 17x2 strip can be split into 2x2 squares and a 1x2 strip. Wait, 2x2 is even, but the 1x2 strip would need 1x1 squares, which are odd. So again, seems like a lot of odd squares.Alternatively, maybe split the original rectangle into even and odd parts differently. Let&#39;s think about parity. The area is 380. Each odd square has an area of (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1, which is 1 mod 4. Even squares have area (2k)^2 = 4k^2, which is 0 mod 4. So the total area of odd squares must be congruent to the number of odd squares mod 4. The total area is 380, which is 380/4 = 95, so 380 mod 4 is 0. Therefore, the total area of odd squares must be 0 mod 4. But each odd square contributes 1 mod 4. So the number of odd squares must be 0 mod 4. Therefore, the minimal number of odd squares must be a multiple of 4. So possible minimal numbers are 0, 4, 8, etc. But can we have 0? If 0, then all squares are even, but as we saw earlier, the 19 side is odd. If we tile the rectangle with even squares, each even square has even sides. But along the 19 side, we can&#39;t sum even numbers to get an odd total. So each row of even squares along the 19 side would leave a remainder, which would have to be filled with odd squares. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have 0 odd squares. Hence, the minimal number must be at least 4. Wait, but why 4? Because the number has to be a multiple of 4. So the minimal number of odd squares is 4? Let&#39;s check. If we can find a tiling with 4 odd squares, that would be the answer. How can we achieve 4 odd squares? Let&#39;s think. Maybe split the rectangle into four odd squares and the rest even squares. For example, suppose we divide the 20x19 into four odd squares and some even squares. Let&#39;s try to find such a partition.First, notice that 19 and 20 are both 1 mod 3 (19=3*6+1, 20=3*6+2). Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe divide the rectangle into four regions, each containing an odd square. For example, let&#39;s split the rectangle into four smaller rectangles, each of which requires one odd square. But how?Alternatively, consider splitting the 20x19 into a grid. For example, divide the 20 length into parts: 1 + 19, but 1 is odd. Alternatively, 3 + 17, both odd. If we split the 20 length into 3 and 17, both odd numbers, then each of those can be paired with the 19 width. But 19 is odd. So each of the resulting rectangles would be 3x19 and 17x19. Then, each of those can be split into squares. For the 3x19 rectangle, we can have a 3x3 square (odd), leaving 3x16. The 3x16 can be split into 3x3 squares and 3x13, but this seems messy. Alternatively, the 3x16 can be split into 3x3 squares and 16-3=13, which is still not helpful. Maybe instead, tile the 3x16 with 3x3 squares and 3x1 strips. But 3x1 strips would need 1x1 squares, which are odd. So each 3x16 would require multiple 1x1 squares, which would add to the count. Similarly, the 17x19 rectangle: 17 is odd, 19 is odd. If we take a 17x17 square (odd), leaving a 17x2 strip. The 17x2 strip would be split into 2x2 squares and a 1x2 strip, leading to 1x1 squares. Again, adding more odd squares. So this approach might not help.Alternatively, perhaps use a checkerboard pattern or some other tiling. Wait, maybe the key is to minimize the number of odd squares by using the largest possible odd squares. For example, using one large odd square and then tiling the remaining area with even squares. But as before, using a 19x19 square leaves a 1x19 strip, which requires 19 1x1 squares, totaling 20 odd squares, which is too many.Alternatively, use two odd squares. Let&#39;s see. Suppose we divide the rectangle into two parts: 19x19 and 1x19 as before, but wait, that&#39;s the same as before. Alternatively, divide the rectangle vertically. Suppose we split the 20 length into two parts: 19 and 1. Then we have a 19x19 square (odd) and a 1x19 strip (needs 19 1x1 squares). Still 20 odd squares.Alternatively, split the rectangle into two parts horizontally. The width is 19. If we split into two parts, say 10 and 9. 10 is even, 9 is odd. Then, the 20x10 rectangle can be tiled with even squares (since both sides are even). The 20x9 rectangle is 20 (even) x9 (odd). To tile this, we can split it into 9x9 squares (odd) and the remaining area. 20 divided by 9 gives 2 squares of 9x9 with 2 units remaining. So two 9x9 squares (odd) and a 2x9 strip. The 2x9 strip can be split into 2x2 squares (even) and a 2x1 strip. The 2x1 strip needs 1x1 squares (odd). So total odd squares: 2 (the 9x9s) + 2 (from the 2x1 strips) = 4. Wait, that&#39;s interesting.Wait, let&#39;s recast that. If we split the original 20x19 rectangle into two parts: 20x9 and 20x10. The 20x10 can be tiled with 10x10 squares (even). The 20x9 can be divided as follows: place two 9x9 squares (odd) along the length. Each 9x9 square takes up 9 units of the 20 length, so two of them take 18, leaving 2 units. So the remaining area is 2x9. Then, split the 2x9 into 9 2x1 strips. Each 2x1 strip can be split into two 1x1 squares. So each 2x1 strip requires two 1x1 squares (odd). There are 9 strips, so 18 1x1 squares. Therefore, the total number of odd squares would be 2 (9x9) + 18 (1x1) = 20. That&#39;s still 20, which is not better.Wait, maybe a different split. Instead of 20x9 and 20x10, split into 19x19 and 1x19, but we already saw that. Alternatively, split the rectangle into four regions. Let me think. Maybe divide the 20x19 into four odd squares and the rest even. For example, take four 1x1 squares and the rest even. But that would require that the remaining area is 380 - 4 = 376, which must be filled with even squares. But 376 is divisible by 4, so that&#39;s possible. However, arranging the squares such that the four 1x1 squares are placed in positions that don&#39;t disrupt the even tiling. But how?Alternatively, think of the entire rectangle as a checkerboard. Since the rectangle is 20x19, which is even x odd, the number of black and white squares would differ by 19 (since each row has 10 black and 10 white, except for the odd row which would have one extra). Wait, actually, a 20x19 grid has 20 columns and 19 rows. Each column has 19 squares. If colored like a checkerboard, each column would alternate colors. Since 19 is odd, each column would start and end with the same color. So there would be (19+1)/2 = 10 of one color and 9 of the other per column. Wait, this might not be straightforward. Maybe parity arguments can help here.Each odd square, when placed on the checkerboard, will cover an odd number of squares, so it will cover either one more black or white square. Since the total area is even, the total number of black and white squares must be equal. However, because the rectangle is 20x19, which is 380 squares, which is even, so 190 black and 190 white. Each even square covers an even number of both colors, so they don&#39;t affect the balance. Each odd square covers (k^2 + 1)/2 of one color and (k^2 - 1)/2 of the other, where k is the side length. So each odd square creates a difference of 1 in the count of black and white squares. Since the total difference must be zero, the number of odd squares must be even. Wait, but earlier we thought the number of odd squares must be a multiple of 4. Let me check.If each odd square changes the balance by +1 or -1, and the total balance is 0, then the sum of these changes must be 0. Therefore, the number of odd squares that contribute +1 must equal the number that contribute -1. Hence, the total number of odd squares must be even. So minimal number is 0, 2, 4, etc. But we already saw that 0 is impossible. So the minimal number is 2 or 4. Wait, but earlier the parity mod 4 said it must be a multiple of 4. Which is correct?Wait, let&#39;s recast the problem. When you tile the rectangle with squares, each odd square will cover an odd number of black and white squares. Let&#39;s assume the checkerboard coloring. An odd-sized square will have (k^2 + 1)/2 of one color and (k^2 - 1)/2 of the other. So, for example, a 1x1 square covers 1 square of one color. A 3x3 square covers 5 of one color and 4 of the other. A 5x5 covers 13 of one color and 12 of the other, etc. Each odd square creates an imbalance of 1. The total imbalance must be zero because the entire rectangle has equal black and white squares. Therefore, the number of odd squares that contribute +1 must equal those that contribute -1, hence the total number of odd squares must be even. So the minimal number is even, but not necessarily a multiple of 4. Wait, but each odd square contributes a net of +1 or -1, so if you have two squares, one contributing +1 and the other -1, total imbalance is zero. So the minimal number could be 2. But earlier, the area modulo 4 requires that the number of odd squares is 0 mod 4, because each odd square contributes 1 mod 4 to the total area. Since the total area is 0 mod 4, the number of odd squares must be 0 mod 4. So both conditions must hold: number of odd squares is even (from the checkerboard) and 0 mod 4 (from the area). Therefore, the minimal number must be a multiple of 4. So 0, 4, 8, etc. But 0 is impossible, so minimal is 4.Therefore, the minimal number of odd squares is 4. Now, how can we achieve that?Let&#39;s try to construct such a tiling. Let me think. If we can divide the 20x19 rectangle into four odd squares and the rest even squares. Let me try to find such a division.One approach is to divide the rectangle into four regions each containing an odd square, and the rest can be tiled with even squares. Let&#39;s attempt to do this.First, consider splitting the rectangle into four smaller rectangles, each requiring one odd square. For example, divide the 20x19 into four equal parts, but 20 and 19 aren&#39;t easily divisible by 4. Alternatively, divide the length 20 into four parts: for example, 5, 5, 5, 5. But 5 is odd. Each 5x19 strip. Then, each 5x19 can be split into a 5x5 square (odd) and a 5x14 strip. Then, the 5x14 can be split into 5x5 and 5x9, but this seems to lead to more odd squares. Not helpful.Alternatively, divide the 20x19 into four regions each with odd dimensions. For example, divide the length 20 into 1 + 1 + 1 + 17 (four parts, three 1s and a 17). Then each 1x19 strip would need 1x1 squares. No, that&#39;s worse.Alternatively, think of placing four odd squares in the corners. For example, place a 1x1 square in each corner. Then the remaining area would be a (20 - 2)x(19 - 2) = 18x17 rectangle. But 18 is even and 17 is odd. Then, how to tile the 18x17. If we can tile that with even squares, then the total odd squares would be 4. Let&#39;s check. 18x17 can be split into 17x17 (odd) and 1x17 strip. But 17x17 is odd, so that would add another odd square. Not helpful.Alternatively, tile 18x17 with even squares. Since 18 is even and 17 is odd, similar to the original problem. If we place an even square in the 18x17, say 16x16, leaving 16x1 and 2x17. Then 16x1 and 2x17 would need to be tiled with 1x1 and 2x2 squares. But 1x1 is odd. So that adds more odd squares. So this approach isn&#39;t working.Alternatively, split the 18x17 into 16x16 and 2x16 and 18x1. But again, the 18x1 would need 1x1 squares.Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let me recall that in some tiling problems, a rectangle can be divided into squares of different sizes. Let me see if there&#39;s a known theorem or method for minimal number of squares. But since we have the restriction of minimizing the number of odd squares, maybe it&#39;s possible to do it with four odd squares.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. If we divide the 20x19 rectangle into four L-shaped regions, each containing an odd square, and the rest filled with even squares. For example, place four 1x1 squares (odd) at strategic points so that the remaining areas are all even in both dimensions. But 1x1 squares are too small. If we place four 1x1 squares, then the remaining area is 380 - 4 = 376, which is divisible by 4, so possible to tile with even squares. But how to arrange them? Let&#39;s try.Imagine placing four 1x1 squares in positions such that they split the 20x19 into four even-sized regions. For example, place two 1x1 squares along the length and two along the width. Wait, but arranging them such that the remaining regions have even lengths and widths.Wait, suppose we divide the 20x19 rectangle into four smaller rectangles by making two vertical cuts and two horizontal cuts. Each cut is between unit squares. If we place the cuts such that the resulting regions have even dimensions. For example, make a vertical cut at x=1 and x=19 (leaving 1 unit in the middle), and horizontal cuts at y=1 and y=18 (leaving 1 unit at the top and bottom). But this would create regions of size 1x1, which are odd, but we need four of them, and the rest would be even? Not sure. Let me visualize.Alternatively, divide the rectangle into four quadrants, each with an odd dimension. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, place four 1x1 squares in the center, creating a cross shape. Then, the remaining areas would be four rectangles around the cross. If the cross is 1x1 in the center, but 20 and 19 are both larger than 1. Wait, perhaps the cross would split the rectangle into four regions. For example, if we have a cross of width 1, then the remaining areas would be four rectangles: top, bottom, left, right. The top and bottom would be 1 unit high, which is odd, but their lengths would be 20 units. Similarly, left and right would be 1 unit wide. But that would require tiling 20x1 and 1x19 strips, which would need 1x1 squares. Hence, leading to more odd squares. Not helpful.Alternatively, use larger odd squares. Let&#39;s try to use four 3x3 squares. Place them in the corners. Then, each corner has a 3x3 square. The remaining area would be the central part. Let&#39;s calculate the remaining area. Original area: 20*19 = 380. Four 3x3 squares: 4*9=36. Remaining area: 380 - 36 = 344. 344 is divisible by 4 (344/4 = 86), so possible to tile with even squares. But how to arrange the remaining area.After placing four 3x3 squares in the corners, the remaining shape would be a central rectangle plus four strips. Wait, actually, placing a 3x3 in each corner would leave:- Along the top: between the two top 3x3 squares, a rectangle of (20 - 3 - 3) x 3 = 14x3- Similarly, along the bottom: 14x3- On the left and right sides: between the left and right 3x3 squares, rectangles of 3x(19 - 3 - 3) = 3x13- And the central area: (20 - 6)x(19 - 6) = 14x13So total remaining areas: two 14x3, two 3x13, and one 14x13. All of these have at least one odd dimension. For example, 14x3: 14 is even, 3 is odd. Similarly, 3x13 and 14x13. So these cannot be tiled with even squares only. Therefore, each of these regions would require additional odd squares. Hence, this approach doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, use larger odd squares. Let&#39;s try four 5x5 squares. Area would be 4*25=100. Remaining area: 380 - 100 = 280. 280 is divisible by 4 (280/4=70). So possible to tile with even squares. Let&#39;s see the arrangement.Placing four 5x5 squares in the corners. Then, the remaining areas would be:- Top and bottom: (20 - 5 -5) x5 =10x5- Left and right:5x(19 -5 -5)=5x9- Central area: (20 -10)x(19 -10)=10x9Again, all these remaining regions have at least one odd dimension: 10x5 (even x odd), 5x9 (odd x odd), 10x9 (even x odd). So again, they can&#39;t be tiled with even squares only. Hence, leading to more odd squares.Hmm. Maybe the key is to use four odd squares of different sizes? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we use two 1x1 squares and two 3x3 squares. Then the remaining area is 380 - (2*1 + 2*9) = 380 - 20 = 360. 360 is divisible by 4. But again, arranging them such that the remaining regions can be tiled with even squares. It&#39;s unclear.Alternatively, maybe use four 1x1 squares and tile the rest with even squares. Let&#39;s try that. Place four 1x1 squares in positions that split the rectangle into four even-sized regions. For example, place two 1x1 squares along the length and two along the width, such that the remaining regions are even in both dimensions. Let&#39;s try:If we place a 1x1 square at position (10,10), but coordinates might complicate. Alternatively, divide the rectangle into four quadrants by making a vertical cut at 10 and a horizontal cut at 9.5, but we can&#39;t cut at half units. Alternatively, make a vertical cut at 10 (even) and a horizontal cut at 9 or 10. Wait, 19 is odd. If we make a horizontal cut at 9 (leaving 9 and 10), but 9 is odd. So if we make vertical cut at 10 (even) and horizontal cut at 10 (even). Wait, but the height is 19. If we make a horizontal cut at 10, we get 10 and 9. 10 is even, 9 is odd. So the resulting four regions would be:- Top left: 10x10 (even x even)- Top right: 10x10 (even x even)- Bottom left: 10x9 (even x odd)- Bottom right: 10x9 (even x odd)The top two regions can be tiled with even squares. The bottom two regions (10x9) need to be tiled. Each 10x9 can be split into a 9x9 square (odd) and a 1x9 strip (needs nine 1x1 squares). So each 10x9 would require 1 odd square (9x9) and 9 odd squares (1x1). So total odd squares would be 4 (from the four 1x1s) + 2*(1 +9) = 4 + 20 = 24. That&#39;s worse.Alternatively, if we place four 1x1 squares in the vertical and horizontal cuts. Suppose we split the 20 length into 1 + 18 +1 and the 19 width into 1 + 17 +1. Then, the four 1x1 squares are at the corners, and the central area is 18x17. The 18x17 can be split into even squares? 18 is even, 17 is odd. Similar problem as before. So 18x17 would need to be tiled with, say, 17x17 (odd) and 1x17. Again, leading to more odd squares.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a different way to partition. Let me think of the following approach inspired by the checkerboard parity. Since we need four odd squares, perhaps place them in such a way that they balance the color parity. Each odd square of size 1x1, 3x3, etc., but arranged so that their color imbalances cancel out.Alternatively, maybe use four 1x1 squares placed such that the remaining area is divisible into even squares. For example, if we place four 1x1 squares at positions (1,1), (1,19), (20,1), (20,19). Then, the remaining area is 380 -4 = 376. Now, 376 is 4*94. So maybe divide the remaining area into 2x2 squares. But the remaining area is the entire rectangle minus four corners. The remaining shape is a rectangle with four 1x1 corners removed. This shape is not a rectangle, but a more complex polygon. Tiling this with 2x2 squares might not be possible because of the missing corners. Each missing corner is a 1x1 square, so adjacent to the corners, there are 1x1 notches. A 2x2 square can&#39;t fit into those notches. Therefore, this approach won&#39;t work.Alternatively, place the four 1x1 squares not at the corners but somewhere else. For example, place them along the edges such that the remaining regions are rectangles. Suppose we place two 1x1 squares along the top edge and two along the bottom edge, spaced such that they divide the top and bottom into even lengths. For example, place a 1x1 square at (1,1) and (2,1), splitting the top edge into segments of 1,1,18. But 18 is even. Similarly, on the bottom edge. Then, the vertical strips between the 1x1 squares would be 18 units wide (even). But the heights would be 19 -2 =17 (odd). So again, we have regions with odd dimensions.Alternatively, place four 1x1 squares in the middle of the rectangle, forming a 2x2 square of 1x1s. Then, the remaining area is 380 -4 = 376. The shape would be the original rectangle with a 2x2 hole in the center. However, tiling this with even squares is possible? The hole is 2x2, so the remaining area is a frame around it. The frame has outer dimensions 20x19 and inner dimensions 2x2. This is a complex shape. Maybe it can be divided into even squares. For example, divide the frame into vertical and horizontal strips. But since both 20 and 19 are larger than 2, the frame has varying widths. The top and bottom parts would be 20 units long and varying heights. The sides would be 19 - 2 =17 units high. Not sure.Alternatively, think of the frame as four rectangles: top, bottom, left, right. The top and bottom would be 20x1 (since the hole is 2x2, but wait, actually, the hole is in the center. Let me calculate the exact dimensions. If the hole is 2x2 in the center, then the remaining areas are:- Top: 20 x ( (19 -2)/2 ) = 20x8.5, which is not integer. So impossible. Therefore, can&#39;t have a 2x2 hole centered.Alternatively, place the hole off-center. For example, place a 2x2 hole starting at (10,9), so the hole occupies columns 10-11 and rows 9-10. Then, the remaining areas would be:- Left: 9 columns (1-9) x 19 rows- Right: 10 columns (12-20) x 19 rows- Above the hole: rows 1-8, columns 10-11- Below the hole: rows 11-19, columns 10-11But this complicates the tiling further, with non-rectangular regions. Not helpful.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter way. Let me think of the following tiling. Use four odd squares of size 1x1, and the rest even squares. Since the total area is 380, and four 1x1s take up 4, the remaining 376 must be even squares. Since 376 is divisible by 4, this is possible. However, arranging the squares such that the remaining area is tileable with even squares. The problem is that the four 1x1 squares would split the rectangle into regions that may not have even dimensions. Wait, here&#39;s an idea. If we can place the four 1x1 squares in such a way that they are each in separate &quot;parity&quot; regions, allowing the remaining areas to be even in both dimensions. For example, imagine dividing the 20x19 grid into four quadrants, each with a 1x1 square removed. If each quadrant has even dimensions after the removal, then they can be tiled with even squares. Let&#39;s try.Divide the rectangle into four quadrants with vertical and horizontal cuts. Let&#39;s make a vertical cut at column 10 (even) and a horizontal cut at row 9 (odd). So the four quadrants would be:1. Top-left: 10x9 (even x odd)2. Top-right: 10x9 (even x odd)3. Bottom-left: 10x10 (even x even)4. Bottom-right: 10x10 (even x even)If we remove a 1x1 square from each of the top-left and top-right quadrants, their dimensions become 10x9 -1x1. But 10x9 minus 1x1 is still 10x9 with a missing square, which isn&#39;t a rectangle. So that doesn&#39;t help. Alternatively, place the 1x1 squares such that the remaining areas are even in both dimensions. For example, in the top-left quadrant (10x9), if we place a 1x1 square at the corner, the remaining area is 10x9 -1x1 = 89. Which is odd, so can&#39;t be divided into even squares. Not helpful.Alternatively, place the 1x1 squares in the bottom quadrants. The bottom-left and bottom-right are 10x10. If we remove a 1x1 from each, they become 10x10 -1x1 = 99 each. 99 is odd, so can&#39;t be tiled with even squares. Hmm.Alternatively, make different cuts. Suppose we make vertical cuts at columns 1 and 19, and horizontal cuts at rows 1 and 19. Then, we have four 1x1 squares at the corners, and the remaining area is 18x17. But 18x17 is even x odd. As before, can&#39;t be tiled with even squares. Alternatively, place the four 1x1 squares along the edges such that they split the rectangle into even-sized regions. For example, place two 1x1 squares along the top edge at positions dividing the length into even segments, and two along the bottom edge similarly. But similar to previous attempts, this creates regions with odd dimensions.Wait, maybe use a different size for the odd squares. Instead of 1x1, use 3x3. Let&#39;s say we place four 3x3 squares. Their total area is 4*9=36. Remaining area: 380 -36=344=4*86. If we can arrange the four 3x3 squares such that the remaining regions are all even in both dimensions, then we can tile them with even squares. How?Imagine placing the four 3x3 squares in such a way that they are spaced apart to leave even gaps. For example, place one 3x3 square in each corner. Then, between them horizontally, we have 20 - 3 -3 =14 units, which is even. Vertically, between them, we have 19 -3 -3=13 units, which is odd. So the central horizontal strip would be 14x13, which is even x odd. Not helpful. Similarly, vertical gaps would be 3 units high, leading to 3x14 strips. Again, odd x even. Alternatively, place the four 3x3 squares not at the corners but offset. For example, place two 3x3 squares along the top edge, spaced such that the remaining length is even. Let&#39;s say place them starting at columns 1 and 17 (since 17 +3=20). Wait, 1 to 3 and 17 to 20. Then between them is 17 -3=14. So the top edge would have two 3x3 squares and a 14x3 strip. The 14x3 strip is even x odd. Then vertically, the remaining area would be 3x16 (odd x even) and 14x16 (even x even). But again, the 14x3 and 3x16 strips have odd dimensions.This seems like a recurring issue. Whenever we place an odd square, the remaining dimensions often end up being odd, necessitating more odd squares. Therefore, maybe the minimal number of odd squares is indeed 4, but we need a smarter tiling.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach. Use the fact that 20 = 5*4 and 19 = 5*3 +4. Maybe divide the rectangle into 5x5 squares. But 5 is odd. If we use 5x5 squares, then we can fit 4 along the 20 length (4*5=20) and 3 along the 19 width (3*5=15), leaving 4 units. So the tiling would be 4x3=12 squares of 5x5 (which are odd) and a remaining 20x4 strip. The 20x4 strip can be divided into 5x4 rectangles, each of which can be split into 4x4 and 1x4. Wait, no. A 5x4 can be split into a 4x4 square (even) and a 1x4 strip. The 1x4 strip needs 4 1x1 squares (odd). So each 5x4 would contribute 1 odd square (the 1x1s). There are 5 such 5x4s in the 20x4 strip. Therefore, total odd squares: 12 (5x5) +5*4=12+20=32. Which is way more than 4.Alternatively, maybe combine the 20x4 strip into 4x4 squares. 20x4 can be divided into 5 of 4x4 squares. Since 4 is even, no problem. But wait, 4x4 squares. But 20 is divisible by 4 (5 times), and 4 is divisible by 4 (once). So 20x4 can be divided into 5x1=5 squares of 4x4. Therefore, no odd squares needed for the strip. Wait, but how does that work? If we have a 20x4 strip, you can divide it into 5 squares of 4x4 each. Because 4*5=20. So each 4x4 square occupies 4 units in length and 4 units in width. Wait, but the width is only 4, so each 4x4 square would take up the entire width. So 20 length divided by 4 gives 5 squares. Yes, that works. So the 20x4 strip can be tiled with five 4x4 squares (even). Therefore, total odd squares would be 12 (from the 5x5s). But 12 is more than 4. Not helpful.Wait, perhaps a different base square size. Let&#39;s try 3x3. If we tile as many 3x3 squares as possible. Along the 20 length, we can fit 6 squares (3*6=18), leaving 2 units. Along the 19 width, we can fit 6 squares (3*6=18), leaving 1 unit. So the main area would be 18x18, tiled with 36 3x3 squares, and remaining areas:- Right strip: 2x18- Bottom strip: 18x1- Corner: 2x1All these need to be tiled. The right strip (2x18) can be tiled with 2x2 squares (9 of them). The bottom strip (18x1) needs 18 1x1 squares. The corner (2x1) needs 2 1x1 squares. Total odd squares: 36 (3x3) +18 +2=56. That&#39;s way too many.Hmm, maybe a different approach. Let&#39;s recall that the minimal number of squares needed to tile a rectangle is a classic problem, but here we have the added constraint of minimizing the number of odd squares. Wait, maybe the answer is 4, and here&#39;s how. Use four 1x1 squares and the rest even squares. Even though earlier attempts to arrange this geometrically failed, perhaps there is a way. The key is that the four 1x1 squares are placed such that the remaining regions are all even in both dimensions. For example, place each 1x1 square at the intersection of even and odd coordinates, effectively dividing the rectangle into even-even regions.Let me think in terms of coordinates. Let&#39;s number the columns 1 to 20 and rows 1 to 19. Place a 1x1 square at (2,2), (2,18), (19,2), (19,18). Wait, but 19 is odd. Alternatively, place them at (1,1), (1,19), (20,1), (20,19). Then, the remaining area is 380 -4=376. However, the remaining shape is the original rectangle minus four 1x1 corners. This creates a sort of picture frame with the outer edges and inner edges. The inner dimensions would be (20-2)x(19-2)=18x17. The problem is the inner 18x17 is still even x odd. So we need to tile that. If we can tile 18x17 with even squares, then the total odd squares would be 4. But 18x17 cannot be tiled with even squares only, because 17 is odd. Similar to the original problem. Hence, leading us back to needing more odd squares.Wait, but what if after removing the four 1x1 squares, we can split the remaining area into regions that are even-even. For example, after removing four 1x1 squares, maybe divide the remaining area into four even-even rectangles.For instance, if we place four 1x1 squares in such a way that splits the original rectangle into four smaller rectangles, each with even dimensions. For example:- Place a 1x1 square at (10,10). Then make vertical and horizontal cuts through this square, dividing the original rectangle into four quadrants. Each quadrant would then be (10-1)x(10-1)=9x9, but 9 is odd. Not helpful.Alternatively, place the four 1x1 squares such that each is in a separate quadrant, allowing the quadrants to have even dimensions. For example, divide the rectangle into four quadrants with a vertical cut at 10 and horizontal cut at 9. Then each quadrant is 10x9 (even x odd), 10x10 (even x even), 10x10, and 10x9. Place a 1x1 square in each 10x9 quadrant, reducing their dimensions to 10x9 -1x1. But again, not rectangular.Alternatively, place the four 1x1 squares along the central cross, splitting the rectangle into four even-even regions. For example, vertical cut between columns 10 and 11, horizontal cut between rows 9 and 10. Then, insert four 1x1 squares at the intersections. This creates four regions: top-left (10x9), top-right (10x9), bottom-left (10x10), bottom-right (10x10). Again, same as before.Wait, maybe instead of removing the 1x1 squares, we use them as part of the tiling. For example, the four 1x1 squares are part of the tiling, and the remaining areas are even-even. But how?Wait, here&#39;s an idea inspired by the parity argument. Since we need four odd squares, let&#39;s use four 1x1 squares. Place them at positions where they each take one unit from both the length and the width. For example, place a 1x1 square at (1,1), then the remaining area is (20-1)x(19-1)=19x18. But 19 is odd, 18 is even. Not helpful. Alternatively, place four 1x1 squares in such a way that each subtraction reduces both dimensions by 1. But I don&#39;t see how.Alternatively, use four 3x3 squares. Each 3x3 square takes up 3 units in both directions. Place them such that the remaining area is even in both dimensions. For example, place two 3x3 squares along the length and two along the width. The remaining length would be 20 -3*2=14, remaining width 19 -3*2=13. 14 is even, 13 is odd. Not helpful.Alternatively, place the four 3x3 squares in a 2x2 grid. Each pair takes 6 units. So remaining length 20 -6=14, remaining width 19 -6=13. Again, 14x13 is even x odd.Wait, this seems impossible. Every time we try to place four odd squares, the remaining area has at least one odd dimension. Therefore, maybe the minimal number is higher than 4? But earlier parity arguments suggest it must be a multiple of 4, and we can&#39;t have 0, so 4 is the minimal. There must be a way.Wait, maybe use four 5x5 squares. Place them in such a way that the remaining area is even in both dimensions. For example, place two 5x5 squares along the length: 5*2=10, remaining length=20-10=10 (even). Place two 5x5 squares along the width: 5*2=10, remaining width=19-10=9 (odd). So remaining area is 10x9 (even x odd). Still problematic.Alternatively, place four 5x5 squares two in length and two in width but differently. For example, place two 5x5 squares along the length (total 10), remaining length 10. Place two 5x5 squares along the width (total 10), remaining width 9. Again, 10x9.Alternatively, place the four 5x5 squares not aligned. For example, place one in each corner. Then remaining length 20-10=10, remaining width 19-10=9. The central area would be 10x9. Still even x odd.Hmm. Is there a way to place four odd squares such that the remaining area is even in both dimensions? Let&#39;s think. Suppose we use four odd squares of size k x k. Then, the remaining area must be (20 - a*k) x (19 - b*k), where a and b are the number of squares along each dimension. Wait, but unless we arrange the squares in some non-grid layout.Alternatively, place the four odd squares in a 2x2 grid, each shifted by some amount. For example, imagine four 5x5 squares arranged in a square formation, leaving a cross-shaped area in the middle. The remaining area would be 20x19 -4*25=380-100=280. The remaining area would need to be even x even. But the shape might not be a rectangle. If the four 5x5 squares are placed at the corners, the remaining area is a central rectangle plus four strips. The central rectangle would be (20 -10)x(19 -10)=10x9, which is even x odd. So still problematic.Wait, maybe use different sized odd squares. For example, use two 3x3 and two 5x5 squares. Total area: 2*9 +2*25=18+50=68. Remaining area: 380-68=312. 312 is divisible by 4 (312/4=78). Now, if the remaining area can be tiled with even squares, that would work. But again, the problem is the remaining area&#39;s dimensions. If the odd squares are placed such that the remaining regions have even dimensions.For example, place two 5x5 squares along the length: 5+5=10, remaining length=10 (even). Place two 3x3 squares along the width: 3+3=6, remaining width=13 (odd). So remaining area is 10x13 (even x odd). Not helpful.Alternatively, arrange the odd squares differently. Place a 5x5 and a 3x3 along the length: 5+3=8, remaining length=12 (even). Along the width, same: 5+3=8, remaining width=11 (odd). Still problematic.This seems like a dead end. Maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s look up similar problems or recall that the minimum number of odd squares in a tiling of an even x odd rectangle is 4. According to some tiling theorems, perhaps. But I need to think without external resources.Wait, here&#39;s another idea. Use four odd squares in a checkerboard pattern. For example, divide the rectangle into 2x2 blocks. Each 2x2 block can be tiled with one 1x1 square (odd) and three 1x1 squares, but that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, in each 2x2 block, place a 1x1 and three 2x2s, but that would mean more odd squares.Alternatively, tile the entire rectangle with 2x2 squares and four 1x1 squares. Since 20 and 19 are not multiples of 2, we can&#39;t tile the entire rectangle with 2x2s. The number of 2x2 squares would be floor(20/2)*floor(19/2)=10*9=90, covering 90*4=360 area. Remaining area=380-360=20, which would require five 2x2 squares but we have 20 unit squares left. Wait, 20 unit squares can be arranged as five 2x2 squares (covering 20 units), but we need 20/4=5, but 20 is not divisible by 4. Wait, 20 unit squares would require 5 2x2 squares (5*4=20). But 20 is divisible by 4 (20=5*4). Wait, 20 unit squares can be covered by five 2x2 squares. But the remaining area after placing 90 2x2 squares is 20 unit squares, which can be covered by five 2x2 squares. Wait, but 90*4 +5*4= 360 +20=380. But the original area is 380. Therefore, the entire rectangle can be tiled with 95 2x2 squares. But that&#39;s impossible because 20x19 has dimensions not both even. 20 is even, 19 is odd. A 2x2 square tiling requires both dimensions to be even. Since 19 is odd, we can&#39;t tile 20x19 with 2x2 squares. Therefore, this approach is invalid.The key is that when tiling with 2x2 squares, the number of squares needed would be (20/2)*(19/2) =10*9.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible. Hence, we must have some regions that can&#39;t be tiled with 2x2 squares, necessitating odd squares.But according to the earlier parity argument, we need four odd squares. Maybe the minimal tiling consists of four 1x1 squares and the rest 2x2 squares. But since 380 -4=376=94*4. So 94 2x2 squares and four 1x1 squares. But arranging them such that the 1x1 squares are placed and the rest is tileable with 2x2s.However, as previously discussed, placing four 1x1 squares in the corners leaves a central area that is not a rectangle. But perhaps if we place the four 1x1 squares in such a way that the remaining area is a union of even-even rectangles.For example, place the four 1x1 squares at positions (1,1), (1,19), (20,1), (20,19). Then, the remaining area is 20x19 minus four corners. The remaining area can be divided into:- A central rectangle of 18x17.- Four 1x1 squares missing.But 18x17 is even x odd, so it cannot be tiled with 2x2 squares. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, place the four 1x1 squares along the central cross. For example, place them at (10,9), (10,10), (11,9), (11,10). This creates a 2x2 hole in the center. The remaining area is 380 -4=376. The remaining area consists of the original rectangle with a 2x2 hole. Can this be tiled with 2x2 squares? A 2x2 hole can be considered as a single missing 2x2 square. However, the rest of the area is 376, which is 94*4. If we can tile the remaining area with 94 2x2 squares, then it works. But the presence of the hole complicates things. In general, tiling a rectangle with a hole using dominoes or squares is possible under certain conditions.But in this case, the hole is 2x2, which is congruent to 0 mod 2 in both dimensions. The remaining area is 20x19 -2x2=380-4=376. 376 is 94*4, so it&#39;s possible if the remaining shape is tileable with 2x2 squares. However, the hole breaks the continuity. Whether it&#39;s possible depends on the position of the hole. According to tiling theory, a rectangle with a 2x2 hole can be tiled with 2x2 squares if the original rectangle has both sides even and the hole is placed appropriately. However, our original rectangle is 20x19, which is even x odd. After creating a 2x2 hole, the remaining area is still even x odd minus 2x2. The parity might still be an issue.Alternatively, think of the rectangle as a 20x19 grid. If we remove a 2x2 square from the center, the remaining grid has certain properties. However, since 19 is odd, the center is at position (10, 9.5), which is not an integer. Therefore, we can&#39;t have a centered 2x2 hole. Instead, the hole must be placed off-center. For example, remove a 2x2 square starting at (10,9), which is at columns 10-11 and rows 9-10. This creates a hole in the lower middle. The remaining area is 20x19 -4=376. Now, can this shape be tiled with 2x2 squares? Visually, the hole is located such that it breaks the grid into parts. However, since 20 is even and 19 is odd, the rows above and below the hole have different parities. Specifically, rows 1-8 are even, rows 9-10 are modified by the hole, and rows 11-19 are even. This might create an imbalance in the tiling. Alternatively, since 2x2 squares cover two rows and two columns, the key is whether the remaining area can be divided into such blocks.But given the complexity, I&#39;m not sure. It might require a more detailed analysis or a different approach.Given that I&#39;m stuck here, but based on the earlier parity arguments (number of odd squares must be a multiple of 4) and the fact that it&#39;s impossible to tile the rectangle with 0 or 2 odd squares, I think the minimal number is 4. Even though I can&#39;t construct the tiling explicitly, the parity conditions suggest that 4 is the minimal possible. Therefore, the answer to part (a) is 4.For part (b), we need the smallest sum of perimeters of the odd squares. Since perimeter is 4 times the side length, minimizing the sum of perimeters is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the side lengths. Therefore, to minimize the total perimeter, we should use the smallest possible odd squares. Since the minimal number of odd squares is 4, and the smallest odd square is 1x1, using four 1x1 squares would give the minimal sum of perimeters. However, we need to check if it&#39;s possible to tile the rectangle with four 1x1 squares and the rest even squares. As discussed earlier, this requires that the remaining area (376) is tileable with even squares, but the placement of the four 1x1 squares might prevent this due to the remaining regions having odd dimensions. However, if it&#39;s possible, then the minimal sum would be 4*4=16. If not, we might need larger odd squares.But from the earlier reasoning, it&#39;s possible that the four 1x1 squares can be placed such that the remaining area is tileable with even squares. Even though I couldn&#39;t construct such a tiling, if the parity conditions allow it, then 16 would be the answer. However, another possibility is that the minimal sum requires larger odd squares. For example, using four 3x3 squares instead. The perimeter would be 4*(4*3)=48, which is larger than 16. Therefore, if four 1x1 squares are possible, 16 is the minimal. If not, then we need to check.But according to the problem statement, part (a) asks for the minimal number of odd squares, which we concluded is 4. If four 1x1 squares are possible, then part (b) answer is 16. If not, then the minimal sum would be higher. However, given that the area modulo 4 allows four 1x1 squares (since 4*1=4, and 380 -4=376=4*94), it&#39;s theoretically possible if the tiling can be arranged. Therefore, I think the answer to part (b) is 16.But wait, perhaps even with four 1x1 squares, the sum of perimeters is 4*(4*1)=16. If we use larger odd squares, even if their number is still 4, the sum would be larger. Hence, to minimize the sum, use the smallest possible odd squares. Therefore, 16 is the minimal sum.But to confirm, I need to ensure that such a tiling exists. Since we couldn&#39;t construct it explicitly, there&#39;s some doubt. However, based on the area and parity conditions, it should be possible. Therefore, I will go with 16.Final Answera) boxed{4}b) boxed{16}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of minimizing the number of odd squares and the smallest sum of their perimeters when cutting a 20x19 rectangular piece of paper, we need to consider the parity and tiling constraints. Part (a)1. Parity Considerations:    - The area of the rectangle is 380, which is even. Each odd square has an area congruent to 1 mod 4, and each even square has an area congruent to 0 mod 4. The total number of odd squares must be a multiple of 4.   - Using a checkerboard argument, each odd square creates an imbalance of 1 in the count of black and white squares. The total imbalance must be zero, requiring an even number of odd squares. Combined with the modulo 4 condition, the minimal number of odd squares must be 4.2. Tiling Attempts:   - Various attempts to tile the rectangle with four odd squares and the rest even squares were considered. Although explicit tiling wasn&#39;t constructed, the parity arguments confirmed that 4 is the minimal number.Answer for Part (a):[boxed{4}] Part (b)1. Minimizing Perimeter Sum:   - The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. To minimize the sum of perimeters, use the smallest possible odd squares. The smallest odd square is 1x1 with a perimeter of 4.   - Using four 1x1 squares gives a total perimeter of (4 times 4 = 16). Despite challenges in constructing the tiling explicitly, the parity and area conditions suggest it is feasible.Answer for Part (b):[boxed{16}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9524b0db></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9524b0db><span class="icon" data-v-9524b0db>🔑:</span>## Solution and grading criteria:a) If we denote by k the number of square pieces obtained and by x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{k} their dimensions, then writing the area of the rectangle in two ways, we get 19 cdot 20=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+ldots+x_{k}^{2}. Since 19 cdot 20=380 is divisible by 4, the square of an even number is a multiple of 4, and the square of an odd number is a number that gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, we deduce that the number of square pieces of odd dimension must be a multiple of 4. ...1p Note further that this number cannot be 0: the side of length 19 cannot be composed of only squares of even dimension. (Another argument: if we color the piece of paper in columns, alternately with white and black such that the first and last columns are black, we would have 20 more black squares than white ones, and a square of even dimension occupies the same number of white and black squares, so we cannot have only these.) 1 p An example with 4 squares of odd dimension is easy to give: for example, cutting from the last 5 columns 4 pieces 5 times 5 (these are the 4 squares of odd dimension). The remaining rectangular piece 20 times 14 can be cut into pieces 2 times 2. 1pb) We color the piece of paper in columns, alternately with white and black such that the first and last columns are black. We will have 20 more black squares than white ones, and a square of even dimension occupies the same number of white and black squares. A square of odd dimension ell occupies either ell more white squares than black ones or ell more black squares than white ones. Therefore, the sum of the dimensions of the squares that cover more black squares than white ones must be 20 more than the sum of the dimensions of the squares that cover more white squares than black ones. It follows that the sum of the dimensions of the squares that cover more black squares than white ones must be at least 20, so the sum of the dimensions of the squares of odd dimension must be at least 20, thus the sum of the perimeters of the odd squares is at least 80. ........ 3p An example in which the required sum is exactly 80 is the one given in part a). .......................1p</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-a6ae0be7><span data-v-a6ae0be7>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
