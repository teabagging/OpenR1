The figure shows a plan of the road system of a certain city. In this city, there are 8 straight streets, and 11 intersections are named with Latin letters A, B, C, ldots, J, K.Three police officers need to be placed at some intersections so that at least one police officer is on each of the 8 streets. Which three intersections should the police officers be placed at? It is sufficient to provide at least one suitable arrangement.All streets run along straight lines.Horizontal streets: A-B-C-D, E-F-G, H-I-J-K.Vertical streets: A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J.Diagonal streets: H-F-C, C-G-K.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_86512448fd32765ac040g-09.jpg?height=359&amp;width=601&amp;top_left_y=886&amp;top_left_x=420)</div><div class="divider" data-v-b904caef></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about placing three police officers at intersections such that every one of the 8 streets has at least one officer. The city has a road system with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal streets. There are 11 intersections labeled A through K. The streets are as follows:Horizontal:1. A-B-C-D2. E-F-G3. H-I-J-KVertical:4. A-E-H5. B-F-I6. D-G-JDiagonal:7. H-F-C8. C-G-KSo, we need to cover all 8 streets with three police officers. Each officer is placed at an intersection, which can cover all streets that pass through that intersection. The challenge is to find three intersections such that every street is covered by at least one of these intersections.First, let me visualize the layout. Maybe drawing a grid would help. Let&#39;s consider the intersections:Horizontal lines:Top horizontal: A-B-C-D (left to right)Middle horizontal: E-F-G (probably directly below A-B-C-D? Maybe E is below A, F below B, G below C or D?)Bottom horizontal: H-I-J-K (probably below E-F-G? H below E, I below F, J below G, K extending further?)Vertical lines:Left vertical: A-E-H (so A is top, E middle, H bottom)Middle vertical: B-F-I (B top, F middle, I bottom)Right vertical: D-G-J (D top, G middle, J bottom)Diagonal streets:H-F-C: Starting from H (bottom left), going up through F (middle center) to C (top right)C-G-K: Starting from C (top right), going down through G (middle right) to K (bottom far right)Wait, so the diagonal streets cross through multiple intersections. For example, H-F-C connects H, F, and C. Similarly, C-G-K connects C, G, and K.So, the intersections are arranged in a grid-like structure but with some diagonals. Let me try to sketch this mentally.Top row: A - B - C - DMiddle row: E - F - GBottom row: H - I - J - KBut vertically aligned as:A, E, HB, F, IC, G, JD, G, J? Wait, vertical streets are A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J. So D-G-J is another vertical? But then G is in both the middle horizontal (E-F-G) and the vertical D-G-J. So G is connected to D above and J below. So vertical line D-G-J goes from D (top) down to G (middle) then to J (bottom). Similarly, C-G-K is a diagonal from C (top) through G (middle) to K (bottom). So G is a key intersection here, connected to D, J, C, and K.Similarly, H-F-C is a diagonal from H (bottom left) through F (middle center) to C (top right). So F is connected to H, C, and also B-F-I vertically. So F is another key intersection.Given that, the problem is to choose three intersections such that all 8 streets have at least one police officer on them. Each officer can cover all streets that pass through their intersection.We need to cover 8 streets with three intersections. Let&#39;s list all streets with their intersections:1. A-B-C-D: Covers A, B, C, D2. E-F-G: Covers E, F, G3. H-I-J-K: Covers H, I, J, K4. A-E-H: Covers A, E, H5. B-F-I: Covers B, F, I6. D-G-J: Covers D, G, J7. H-F-C: Covers H, F, C8. C-G-K: Covers C, G, KWe need to select three intersections such that every street (1-8) includes at least one of these three intersections.So, the strategy is to find intersections that are part of multiple streets. For example, intersection F is part of streets 2 (E-F-G), 5 (B-F-I), and 7 (H-F-C). So F is on three streets. Similarly, C is on streets 1 (A-B-C-D), 7 (H-F-C), and 8 (C-G-K). So C is on three streets. G is on streets 2 (E-F-G), 6 (D-G-J), and 8 (C-G-K). Also three streets. So F, C, G are high-value targets because they cover multiple streets.If we place officers at F, C, and G, let&#39;s check coverage:1. A-B-C-D: Covered by C2. E-F-G: Covered by F or G3. H-I-J-K: Hmm, none of F, C, G are on H-I-J-K. H-I-J-K is the bottom horizontal street. So we need someone at H, I, J, or K. But our current selection is F, C, G. So street 3 is not covered. Therefore, this trio is insufficient.So we need to adjust. Maybe replace one of them with an intersection that covers street 3. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we take F, C, and K. Then:1. Covered by C2. Covered by F3. Covered by K4. A-E-H: Not covered by F, C, K. So need someone at A, E, or H.5. Covered by F6. D-G-J: Not covered unless we have G or D or J. But we have K. So street 6 is not covered.7. Covered by F and C8. Covered by C and KSo still missing coverage on streets 4 (A-E-H) and 6 (D-G-J). So this trio also fails.Alternatively, maybe F, G, and H.Check coverage:1. A-B-C-D: Covered by F? No. F is on street 2. So need someone on street 1. Street 1 is A-B-C-D. So unless H is on street 1? H is on street 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H), and 7 (H-F-C). So H is not on street 1. Therefore, street 1 is not covered.So H-F-C (street 7) is covered by H and F, but street 1 (A-B-C-D) is not covered. So need someone at A, B, C, or D. If we take F, G, and C. Wait, we tried that before but street 3 (H-I-J-K) wasn&#39;t covered. So, maybe F, C, and J.Check F, C, J.1. A-B-C-D: C2. E-F-G: F3. H-I-J-K: J4. A-E-H: Not covered by F, C, J. So need someone at A, E, or H.5. B-F-I: F6. D-G-J: J7. H-F-C: F and C8. C-G-K: C. But K isn&#39;t covered? Wait, street 8 is C-G-K. If we have C, but G and K aren&#39;t covered. Wait, street 8 is covered if any of C, G, or K is covered. Since we have C, that covers street 8. So street 8 is covered.But street 4 (A-E-H) is not covered. So need someone at A, E, or H. So maybe replace J with H? Let&#39;s try F, C, H.Check F, C, H.1. A-B-C-D: C2. E-F-G: F3. H-I-J-K: H4. A-E-H: H5. B-F-I: F6. D-G-J: Not covered. Needs someone at D, G, or J. We have none of these.7. H-F-C: H and F8. C-G-K: CSo missing street 6 (D-G-J). Therefore, need someone at D, G, or J. So perhaps swap H with G? Let&#39;s try F, C, G.1. Covered by C2. Covered by F or G3. Not covered (H-I-J-K)4. A-E-H: Not covered5. Covered by F6. Covered by G7. Covered by F and C8. Covered by C and GSo streets 3 and 4 are not covered. Hmm. So maybe we need a different combination.Alternatively, what if we take C, G, and I?Check:1. Covered by C2. Covered by G (E-F-G)3. Covered by I (H-I-J-K)4. A-E-H: Not covered5. Covered by I (B-F-I)6. Covered by G (D-G-J)7. Covered by C (H-F-C)8. Covered by C and GSo missing street 4 (A-E-H). So need someone at A, E, or H. So if we replace I with H? Let&#39;s try C, G, H.1. Covered by C2. Covered by G3. Covered by H4. Covered by H5. B-F-I: Not covered. Needs B, F, or I. We have none.6. Covered by G7. Covered by H and C8. Covered by C and GSo missing street 5. So need someone at B, F, or I. Maybe replace H with F? Then C, G, F.But as before, street 3 (H-I-J-K) is not covered. Hmm. Let&#39;s check.C, G, F:1. C2. F or G3. Not covered4. A-E-H: Not covered5. F6. G7. F and C8. C and GSo missing streets 3 and 4. So not good.Alternatively, maybe C, G, and K. Let&#39;s see.C, G, K:1. C2. G3. K (part of H-I-J-K)4. A-E-H: Not covered5. B-F-I: Not covered6. G7. C8. C and G and KSo missing streets 4, 5, and parts of 3. Wait, street 3 is H-I-J-K. If K is covered, does that cover the entire street? Wait, no. The street is H-I-J-K. To cover the entire street, at least one of H, I, J, or K must have an officer. If we have K, then street 3 is covered. So that&#39;s okay. But streets 4 (A-E-H) and 5 (B-F-I) are not covered. So need someone at A, E, H or B, F, I.But we have three officers: C, G, K. So if we can only have three, we need to cover all streets. So streets 4 and 5 are missing. So maybe swap G with F? C, F, K.Covers:1. C2. F3. K4. A-E-H: Not covered5. F6. D-G-J: Not covered (needs D, G, J)7. F and C8. C and KStill missing streets 4 and 6. So need to cover A-E-H and D-G-J.This is tricky. Let&#39;s think differently.Each officer can cover multiple streets. Let&#39;s see which intersections cover the most streets.Intersection A: streets 1 (A-B-C-D) and 4 (A-E-H). So 2 streets.Intersection B: streets 1 (A-B-C-D) and 5 (B-F-I). 2 streets.Intersection C: streets 1, 7, 8. 3 streets.Intersection D: streets 1 and 6. 2 streets.Intersection E: streets 2 (E-F-G) and 4. 2 streets.Intersection F: streets 2, 5, 7. 3 streets.Intersection G: streets 2, 6, 8. 3 streets.Intersection H: streets 3 (H-I-J-K), 4, 7. 3 streets.Intersection I: streets 3, 5. 2 streets.Intersection J: streets 3, 6. 2 streets.Intersection K: streets 3, 8. 2 streets.So the intersections with the most coverage (3 streets each) are C, F, G, H. So these are the best candidates.If we can use three of them, maybe C, F, G. Let&#39;s check:1. C2. F or G3. Not covered (needs H, I, J, K)4. H is not covered, but street 4 (A-E-H) needs one of A, E, H. None of these are in our trio.5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GSo missing streets 3 (H-I-J-K) and 4 (A-E-H). So we need to cover those.Alternatively, if we take C, F, H.Check:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered (D-G-J)7. C and F and H8. CMissing street 6 (D-G-J). So need someone at D, G, or J. But we can&#39;t add a fourth officer. So maybe swap H with G. Then C, F, G.But then street 3 (H-I-J-K) is not covered. So Hmm.Alternatively, take F, G, H.1. Not covered (A-B-C-D)2. F or G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1 (A-B-C-D). So need someone at A, B, C, D. So perhaps swap G with C. Then F, C, H.But that was tried earlier, missing street 6 (D-G-J). Wait, street 6 is D-G-J. If we have C, F, H, none of them are on D-G-J. So missing street 6.Alternatively, take C, G, H.Coverage:1. C2. G3. H4. H5. Not covered (B-F-I)6. G7. H and C8. C and GMissing street 5 (B-F-I). So need someone at B, F, I. So if we can take one of those. But we have three officers: C, G, H. So missing street 5.This is getting complicated. Let&#39;s try another approach. Maybe look for intersections that cover unique streets.Looking at the list of streets:Street 4 (A-E-H): Only covered by A, E, H.Street 6 (D-G-J): Only covered by D, G, J.Street 8 (C-G-K): Covered by C, G, K.Street 7 (H-F-C): Covered by H, F, C.Street 3 (H-I-J-K): Covered by H, I, J, K.So to cover street 4 (A-E-H), we need at least one of A, E, H. Similarly, street 6 (D-G-J) needs one of D, G, J.If we can cover these with the same officer, that would be efficient. For example, if we choose H, which covers street 4, 3, and 7. Then G covers street 2, 6, 8. Then F covers 2, 5, 7. But overlapping.Wait, H covers 3, 4, 7.G covers 2, 6, 8.F covers 2, 5, 7.C covers 1, 7, 8.So if we take H, G, and C:Covered streets:1. C2. G3. H4. H5. Not covered (B-F-I). So need someone at B, F, or I.6. G7. H and C8. C and GSo missing street 5. Therefore, need to include F or someone else. But with three officers, if we take H, G, C, missing street 5. If we replace one with F, then lose something else.Alternatively, if we take F, G, and H:Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GSo missing street 1 (A-B-C-D). So need someone at A, B, C, D.But with three officers, we can&#39;t cover everything.Alternatively, take C, F, G:1. C2. F or G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GMissing streets 3 and 4. So need to cover H-I-J-K and A-E-H.Alternatively, take C, F, H:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. C and F and H8. CMissing street 6. So need someone at D, G, J. If we could replace H with G, but then street 3 is not covered. Hmm.Wait, street 6 is D-G-J. If we take G, then street 6 is covered. So let&#39;s see:If we take C, F, G:Covered:1. C2. F and G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GSo still missing streets 3 and 4. So need to cover 3 and 4.But street 3 is H-I-J-K. To cover that, need H, I, J, or K.Street 4 is A-E-H. To cover that, need A, E, or H.So if we can take H instead of G, but then street 6 is uncovered. Alternatively, take H and G. But with three officers.Wait, if we take C, G, H:Covered streets:1. C2. G3. H4. H5. Not covered6. G7. C and H8. C and GSo missing street 5 (B-F-I). If we can cover street 5 with another officer, but we only have three.Alternatively, take C, F, H:Covered:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. C and F8. CMissing street 6. So need someone at D, G, J.This seems like a dead end. Maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s see which streets intersect at common points.For example, intersection F is on streets 2, 5, 7. If we place an officer at F, that covers three streets. Similarly, intersection C is on streets 1,7,8. G is on 2,6,8. H is on 3,4,7.Suppose we place officers at F, C, and H.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered (needs G, D, J)7. F and C and H8. CSo missing street 6 (D-G-J). But we can&#39;t add another officer. Alternatively, if we place an officer at G instead of C or H, but then lose coverage on some streets.If we place officers at F, G, and H.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1 (A-B-C-D). So need someone at A, B, C, D. But we can&#39;t add. So this trio also misses.Alternatively, if we place an officer at C, G, and H.Covered streets:1. C2. G3. H4. H5. Not covered6. G7. C and H8. C and GMissing street 5 (B-F-I). So officer needed at B, F, I.Alternatively, if we place officers at F, G, and J.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. J4. Not covered5. F6. G and J7. F8. GMissing streets 1, 4, and 3 (only J covers part of 3 but street 3 is H-I-J-K; J is covered, so street 3 is covered. Wait, street 3 is H-I-J-K. If J is covered, then street 3 is covered. So street 3 is okay. Then missing streets 1 (A-B-C-D) and 4 (A-E-H). So need someone at A, B, C, D or A, E, H.But we only have three officers: F, G, J. So can&#39;t cover streets 1 and 4.This is really challenging. Let me think if there&#39;s a different combination.What about C, F, K?Covered streets:1. C2. F3. K4. Not covered5. F6. Not covered7. C and F8. C and KMissing streets 4 and 6. So not good.Alternatively, C, F, J.Covered:1. C2. F3. J4. Not covered5. F6. J7. C and F8. CMissing streets 4 and 8? Wait, street 8 is C-G-K. We have C, so street 8 is covered. So missing street 4 (A-E-H). So need someone at A, E, H. But we can&#39;t add.Alternatively, replace J with H. So C, F, H.As before, missing street 6.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a different intersection that covers multiple critical streets.Intersection E is on streets 2 and 4. If we place an officer at E, that covers streets 2 and 4. But maybe not efficient.Wait, if we take E, F, G. That&#39;s three officers at E, F, G.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. E, F, G3. Not covered4. E5. F6. G7. Not covered8. GSo missing streets 1, 3, 7. Not good.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to think step by step. Let&#39;s cover street 3 (H-I-J-K). To cover it, we need one of H, I, J, K.Similarly, street 4 (A-E-H) needs one of A, E, H.If we choose H, we can cover both street 3 and 4. So H is a good candidate here.Similarly, street 6 (D-G-J) needs one of D, G, J. G is also on street 2 and 8, so G is a good candidate.Street 1 (A-B-C-D) needs one of A, B, C, D. C is also on streets 7 and 8.Street 5 (B-F-I) needs one of B, F, I. F is on streets 2,5,7.Street 7 (H-F-C) is covered if we have H, F, or C.Street 8 (C-G-K) is covered if we have C, G, or K.So maybe choosing H, G, and C.H covers streets 3,4,7.G covers streets 2,6,8.C covers streets 1,7,8.But overlapping coverage on streets 7 and 8.Check:1. C2. G3. H4. H5. Not covered (B-F-I)6. G7. H and C8. C and GMissing street 5 (B-F-I). So need someone at B, F, or I. But we can only have three officers. So this trio is missing street 5.Alternatively, replace C with F. So H, G, F.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. H and F8. GMissing street 1 (A-B-C-D). So need someone at A, B, C, D.Alternatively, replace G with C. So H, C, F.Covered:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. H and F and C8. CMissing street 6 (D-G-J). So officer needed at D, G, J. But we can&#39;t add.Alternatively, replace H with J. So J, G, F.Covered:1. Not covered2. F and G3. J4. Not covered5. F6. G and J7. F8. GMissing streets 1,4. Not good.This is really tricky. Let&#39;s think of another way. Maybe start by covering the diagonal streets, which are H-F-C and C-G-K. These diagonals might cross key intersections.If we cover C and F, that would handle both diagonals. C is on H-F-C and C-G-K, and F is on H-F-C.But still need to cover other streets.Alternatively, think about the vertical streets. Vertical streets are A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J. If we cover F and G, that covers B-F-I and D-G-J. Then need to cover A-E-H with H or E or A.But then we also need to cover horizontal streets. Let&#39;s see:Suppose we place officers at F, G, H.Covered verticals: B-F-I (F), D-G-J (G), A-E-H (H)Covered horizontals: E-F-G (F, G), H-I-J-K (H)But horizontal street A-B-C-D is not covered. So need someone at A, B, C, D.If we replace H with C, then:F, G, C.Covered verticals: B-F-I (F), D-G-J (G), A-E-H (not covered). So need H or A or E.But we have C instead. So street A-B-C-D is covered by C.But vertical street A-E-H is not covered. So street 4 (A-E-H) is uncovered.So we have to choose: cover street 1 (A-B-C-D) with C or someone else, but then street 4 may be left out.Alternatively, cover street 4 with H, but then street 1 is uncovered.This seems like a conflict. Maybe there is no solution with three officers? But the problem states that three police officers can be placed. So there must be a solution.Wait, maybe an intersection that covers two critical streets. Let&#39;s think again.What if we place an officer at C. Then C covers streets 1 (A-B-C-D), 7 (H-F-C), and 8 (C-G-K).Then place an officer at F. F covers streets 2 (E-F-G), 5 (B-F-I), 7 (H-F-C).Now, we need a third officer to cover the remaining streets: 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H), 6 (D-G-J).So remaining streets: 3,4,6. What intersection covers the most of these?Street 3: H, I, J, KStreet 4: A, E, HStreet 6: D, G, JAn intersection that is on two of these streets. For example, H is on street 3 and 4. If we place an officer at H, that covers streets 3 and 4, leaving only street 6 (D-G-J) uncovered. Then we need someone at D, G, or J. But we can&#39;t add a fourth officer. So this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, place the third officer at G. G covers streets 2 (already covered by F), 6 (D-G-J), and 8 (already covered by C). So placing at G would cover street 6. Then remaining streets: 3 and 4.But street 3 (H-I-J-K) and 4 (A-E-H) are still uncovered. So need someone at H to cover both, but we can&#39;t. Alternatively, place at H, which covers 3 and 4, but then street 6 remains.Alternatively, is there a way to cover street 6 with someone else? If we place the third officer at J, which is on street 3 and 6. Then:C, F, J.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. J4. Not covered (A-E-H)5. F6. J7. C and F8. CSo missing street 4 (A-E-H). But maybe we can adjust. If we replace J with H:C, F, H.Covered:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. C and F and H8. CMissing street 6. Alternatively, replace C with G:G, F, H.Covered:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1 (A-B-C-D). Still a problem.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. What if we take intersections C, F, and G?C covers 1,7,8F covers 2,5,7G covers 2,6,8So combined, C, F, G cover:1. C2. F and G3. Not covered (H-I-J-K)4. Not covered (A-E-H)5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GSo missing streets 3 and 4. But maybe there&#39;s overlap I&#39;m not considering. For example, if street 3 (H-I-J-K) is not covered by any of C, F, G. So need an officer at H, I, J, or K. But we have only three officers. If we replace one of C, F, G with H, then:H, F, G.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1.Alternatively, if we take C, F, K.Covered:1. C2. F3. K4. Not covered5. F6. Not covered7. C and F8. C and KStill missing 4 and 6.Wait, maybe the answer is C, F, and H? Even though street 6 is not covered. But the problem says &quot;at least one police officer is on each of the 8 streets&quot;. So each street must have at least one officer. Therefore, all 8 streets must be covered. So C, F, H is missing street 6. So that&#39;s invalid.Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let&#39;s list all streets again with C, F, H.1. A-B-C-D: Covered by C2. E-F-G: Covered by F3. H-I-J-K: Covered by H4. A-E-H: Covered by H5. B-F-I: Covered by F6. D-G-J: Not covered (needs D, G, J)7. H-F-C: Covered by H and F and C8. C-G-K: Covered by CSo street 6 is D-G-J. None of C, F, H are on D-G-J. So street 6 is not covered.Therefore, this is invalid.Similarly, C, G, K:1. C2. G3. K4. Not covered5. Not covered6. G7. C8. C, G, KMissing streets 4 and 5.Alternatively, C, G, D:1. C and D2. G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. Not covered6. D and G7. C8. C and GStill missing streets 3,4,5.This is really frustrating. Wait, maybe the answer is F, G, and C. Let me check once more:1. A-B-C-D: C2. E-F-G: F and G3. H-I-J-K: Not covered4. A-E-H: Not covered5. B-F-I: F6. D-G-J: G7. H-F-C: F and C8. C-G-K: C and GSo missing streets 3 and 4. So not all streets are covered.Wait, maybe there is an intersection that covers both street 3 and 4. That intersection is H. So if we place an officer at H, that covers street 3 and 4. Then we need to cover the remaining streets.Suppose we place officers at H, F, G.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1 (A-B-C-D). So need someone at A, B, C, D. If we replace G with C:H, F, C.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. H and F and C8. CMissing street 6.This is not working. Wait, is there an intersection that is on street 1 and another street? For example, D is on street 1 and 6. So if we place an officer at D, that covers street 1 and 6. Let&#39;s see:Officers at D, F, H.Covered streets:1. D2. F3. H4. H5. F6. D7. H and F8. Not covered (C-G-K)Missing street 8. So need someone at C, G, K. Replace D with C:C, F, H.As before, missing street 6.Alternatively, officers at D, F, G.Covered streets:1. D2. F and G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. F6. D and G7. F8. GMissing streets 3 and 4.This is so frustrating. Maybe the answer is H, F, G.Wait, let&#39;s check again:Officers at H, F, G.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. H and F8. GMissing street 1 (A-B-C-D). So not covered.But the problem states that three officers are sufficient. Maybe there&#39;s an intersection that covers multiple streets we&#39;re missing.Wait, street 1 (A-B-C-D) and street 4 (A-E-H) both include A. If we place an officer at A, that covers street 1 and 4. Then we need to cover the remaining streets with two officers.Let&#39;s try A, F, G.Covered streets:1. A2. F and G3. Not covered4. A5. F6. G7. F8. GMissing streets 3 and 7. Wait, street 7 (H-F-C) is covered by F. So street 7 is covered. So missing street 3 (H-I-J-K). So need someone at H, I, J, K. But we have three officers: A, F, G. So cannot cover street 3.Alternatively, replace A with H. So H, F, G.Covered streets as before, missing street 1.Alternatively, place an officer at C instead of A. So C, F, G.Covered streets:1. C2. F and G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GMissing streets 3 and 4.Hmm. Maybe the answer is C, F, and J.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. J4. Not covered5. F6. J7. C and F8. CMissing streets 4 and 8? No, street 8 is covered by C. So missing street 4 (A-E-H).Alternatively, replace J with E. So C, F, E.Covered streets:1. C2. E and F3. Not covered4. E5. F6. Not covered7. C and F8. CMissing streets 3 and 6.No good. This is really perplexing. Maybe I need to think outside the box.Wait, the diagonal streets: H-F-C and C-G-K. If we place officers at F and G, they cover a lot. F covers streets 2,5,7. G covers 2,6,8. Then third officer needs to cover streets 1,3,4.Street 1: A-B-C-DStreet 3: H-I-J-KStreet 4: A-E-HSo if the third officer is at C, which covers street 1,7,8. But street 3 and 4 still need coverage. Alternatively, officer at H: covers 3,4,7. So officers at F, G, H.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1. So need someone at A, B, C, D. But only three officers.Wait, street 1 is A-B-C-D. If officer is at C, that covers street 1. But then if we have officers at C, F, G:1. C2. F and G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GMissing streets 3 and 4. But if we can cover 3 and 4 with another officer, but we can&#39;t.Alternatively, is there an intersection that is part of both street 1 and another street? For example, C is part of street 1,7,8. So if we have C, that covers street 1. Then we need to cover street 3 and 4.Street 3: H-I-J-KStreet 4: A-E-HIf we place an officer at H, that covers both 3 and 4. So officers at C, H, and one more to cover remaining streets.Remaining streets after C and H:Covered:1. C3. H4. H7. C and H8. CUncovered streets: 2 (E-F-G), 5 (B-F-I), 6 (D-G-J)So need to cover streets 2,5,6. If we place an officer at F, that covers 2,5, and 7 (already covered). So officer at F.Thus, trio C, H, F.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. C and H and F8. CMissing street 6 (D-G-J). So need someone at D, G, J. But we can&#39;t add. So still missing street 6.Alternatively, replace F with G. So C, H, G.Covered streets:1. C2. G3. H4. H5. Not covered6. G7. C and H8. C and GMissing street 5 (B-F-I). Still a problem.Alternatively, officers at C, H, G.Same as above.Alternatively, officers at C, H, D.Covered streets:1. C and D2. Not covered3. H4. H5. Not covered6. D7. C and H8. CMissing streets 2,5. Not good.Wait, this is impossible. But the problem says three officers are sufficient. Therefore, I must be missing something.Let me check the problem statement again: &quot;three police officers need to be placed at some intersections so that at least one police officer is on each of the 8 streets.&quot; So each street must have at least one officer on it, not necessarily covering all intersections of the street. So if a street has at least one officer stationed at any of its intersections, it&#39;s covered.Therefore, for example, street A-B-C-D needs at least one officer at A, B, C, or D. Similarly for other streets.Given that, let&#39;s try officers at F, G, and C.Covered streets:1. C (A-B-C-D)2. F and G (E-F-G)3. Not covered (H-I-J-K)4. Not covered (A-E-H)5. F (B-F-I)6. G (D-G-J)7. F and C (H-F-C)8. C and G (C-G-K)So missing streets 3 and 4.But what if we replace C with H? Officers at F, G, H.Covered streets:1. Not covered (A-B-C-D)2. F and G (E-F-G)3. H (H-I-J-K)4. H (A-E-H)5. F (B-F-I)6. G (D-G-J)7. F and H (H-F-C)8. G (C-G-K) Not covered, because C-G-K needs C, G, or K. G is covered, so street 8 is covered.Wait, street 8: C-G-K. G is covered, so street 8 is covered.Ah! So street 8 is covered by G. So in this case, officers at F, G, H:Covered streets:1. Not covered (A-B-C-D)2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GSo street 1 is still not covered. If we replace H with C, we get F, G, C:Covered streets:1. C2. F and G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. F6. G7. F and C8. C and GSo missing streets 3 and 4.But if we take F, G, K:Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. K4. Not covered5. F6. G7. F8. G and KMissing streets 1 and 4.Wait a second, street 8 is C-G-K. If we have K, then street 8 is covered. So officers at F, G, K cover streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. K4. Not covered5. F6. G7. F8. K and GStill missing 1 and 4.This is really perplexing. Is there a way to cover street 1 and 4 with one officer?Street 1 is A-B-C-D, street 4 is A-E-H. If we place an officer at A, that covers both streets 1 and 4. Then the other two officers can cover the remaining streets.So let&#39;s try officers at A, F, G.Covered streets:1. A2. F and G3. Not covered4. A5. F6. G7. F8. GMissing streets 3 (H-I-J-K) and 7 (H-F-C). Wait, street 7 is H-F-C. If we have F, then street 7 is covered. So street 7 is covered by F. Then missing street 3.So officers at A, F, G:Covered streets:1. A2. F and G3. Not covered4. A5. F6. G7. F8. GMissing street 3. So need someone at H, I, J, K. But can&#39;t add. So not enough.Alternatively, replace A with H. Officers at H, F, G.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1. So no.Alternatively, officers at C, F, H.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. C and F and H8. CMissing street 6. D-G-J. So need someone at D, G, J. If we replace H with G, officers at C, F, G.Covered streets:1. C2. F and G3. Not covered4. Not covered5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GStill missing streets 3 and 4.Wait, maybe the answer is H, F, C.Wait, let me check once more.Officers at H, F, C.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. H, F, C8. CMissing street 6. D-G-J. So need an officer at D, G, or J. Can&#39;t add. Therefore, not covered.But the problem states that three officers are sufficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, maybe the diagonal streets are considered as separate streets. For example, street H-F-C is a single street, not three separate segments. So if an officer is placed at F, they cover the entire diagonal street H-F-C. Similarly, street C-G-K is one street, so an officer at G covers C-G-K.So maybe the key is to realize that covering an intersection on a diagonal street covers the entire diagonal. So if we place an officer at F, that covers the entire diagonal H-F-C, meaning all three intersections H, F, C are covered for that street. Wait, no. The police officer is placed at an intersection, and they cover all streets that pass through that intersection. So if an officer is at F, they cover the streets that go through F: E-F-G (street 2), B-F-I (street 5), and H-F-C (street 7). So the entire street H-F-C is covered by an officer at F, not necessarily that the entire street is covered by the officer&#39;s presence, but that the officer is on that street. Since the officer is at F, which is on street H-F-C, then street H-F-C is covered.So same logic applies. So the problem is still as before.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a trick where an officer at G covers both street 6 (D-G-J) and street 8 (C-G-K), and also street 2 (E-F-G). So G is very efficient.Similarly, officer at F covers streets 2,5,7.Officer at C covers streets 1,7,8.Wait, officer at C and G both cover street 8 (C-G-K). So if we have both C and G, street 8 is covered.But we need three officers. Let&#39;s try C, F, G.As before, missing streets 3 and 4.Alternatively, officer at H covers streets 3,4,7.So H, F, G.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F, G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F, H8. GMissing street 1.But street 1 is A-B-C-D. If we have someone at C, that covers street 1.So trio C, F, H.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. C, F, H8. CMissing street 6. So officer needed at G.But we can&#39;t. So this is not possible. Wait, unless there&#39;s a different way.Wait, maybe the answer is F, G, and C. Even though it leaves streets 3 and 4 uncovered, but that can&#39;t be.Wait, maybe the diagram has a different layout where some streets share intersections beyond what&#39;s listed. The problem mentions the figure, which I can&#39;t see, but described as:Horizontal streets: A-B-C-D, E-F-G, H-I-J-K.Vertical streets: A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J.Diagonal streets: H-F-C, C-G-K.So according to this, intersection D is connected to G via vertical street D-G-J, which means D is vertically above G, and G is above J.Similarly, diagonal street C-G-K connects C to G to K, so C is above G, and G is connected to K.Diagonal street H-F-C connects H to F to C.So the layout is likely a grid with three horizontal lines:Top horizontal: A-B-C-DMiddle horizontal: E-F-GBottom horizontal: H-I-J-KVertical lines:Left: A-E-HMiddle: B-F-IRight: D-G-JDiagonals:From H to F to C (bottom-left to middle-center to top-right)From C to G to K (top-right to middle-right to bottom-right)So, in this layout, intersection G is connected to D (above), J (below), C (diagonally), and K (diagonally).Intersection C is connected to B, D (horizontal), H-F-C (diagonal), and C-G-K (diagonal).Intersection F is connected to E, G (horizontal), B, I (vertical), and H-F-C (diagonal).Intersection H is connected to E, A (vertical), H-I-J-K (horizontal), and H-F-C (diagonal).Given this, maybe there&#39;s an overlapping coverage I&#39;m not considering.Wait, if we place officers at F, G, and C:- F covers streets E-F-G, B-F-I, H-F-C- G covers E-F-G, D-G-J, C-G-K- C covers A-B-C-D, H-F-C, C-G-KCombined coverage:1. A-B-C-D (C)2. E-F-G (F and G)3. H-I-J-K (Not covered)4. A-E-H (Not covered)5. B-F-I (F)6. D-G-J (G)7. H-F-C (F and C)8. C-G-K (C and G)So streets 3 and 4 are uncovered. However, according to the problem statement, we need to cover all 8 streets. Therefore, this trio is insufficient.Similarly, officers at F, G, H:- F: 2,5,7- G: 2,6,8- H: 3,4,7Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F, G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F, H8. GMissing street 1.But the problem states that it&#39;s possible. I must be missing something.Wait, maybe the intersection C is part of the diagonal C-G-K, which is street 8. If an officer is at C, they cover street 8. But street 8 is C-G-K. So if there&#39;s an officer at C, street 8 is covered. Similarly, officer at G covers street 8. Officer at K also covers street 8.But in the previous example, officers at F, G, and H do not cover street 1, which is A-B-C-D. So need someone at A, B, C, or D.If we place an officer at C, replacing H, we get F, G, C, which misses streets 3 and 4.But the problem must have a solution. Let me check once more.Wait, maybe the answer is C, F, and H. Let&#39;s verify:- C covers streets 1,7,8- F covers streets 2,5,7- H covers streets 3,4,7Combined coverage:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered (D-G-J)7. C, F, H8. CMissing street 6. But the problem requires covering all 8 streets. So this is invalid.Wait, the problem says &quot;at least one police officer is on each of the 8 streets&quot;. So each street must have at least one officer. So even if a street has multiple intersections, as long as one intersection has an officer, the street is covered.Given that, street 6 (D-G-J) must have an officer at D, G, or J. If none of these have an officer, street 6 is uncovered. So in the trio C, F, H, street 6 is uncovered. So invalid.Similarly, in F, G, H, street 1 is uncovered.Is there a trio that covers all 8 streets?Let&#39;s try C, G, K.Covered streets:1. C2. G3. K4. Not covered5. Not covered6. G7. C8. C, G, KMissing streets 4 and 5.No good.Another approach: Since street 4 (A-E-H) and street 1 (A-B-C-D) both include A. If we place an officer at A, that covers street 1 and 4. Then remaining streets: 2,3,5,6,7,8.Then place officers at F and G. F covers 2,5,7; G covers 2,6,8. So combined:Covered streets:1. A4. A2. F and G5. F6. G7. F8. GRemaining streets: 3 (H-I-J-K). So need an officer at H, I, J, K. But we can&#39;t add a third officer because we already have A, F, G.So trio A, F, G misses street 3.Alternatively, replace A with H. Then H, F, G.Covered streets:3. H4. H2. F and G5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1.But again, missing street 1.Alternatively, officer at C instead of A: C, F, G.Covered streets:1. C2. F and G5. F6. G7. C and F8. C and GMissing streets 3 and 4.No.Wait, if we take officer at H, covering streets 3,4,7. Then officer at F, covering streets 2,5,7. Then officer at G, covering streets 2,6,8. So trio H, F, G.Covered streets:3. H4. H7. H and F2. F and G5. F6. G8. GMissing streets 1.So officer needed at A, B, C, D.But three officers already. So impossible.But the problem states it&#39;s possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.Wait, maybe there&#39;s an intersection that covers street 1 and another street.Intersection D is on street 1 and 6. So officer at D covers street 1 and 6.Then officers at D, F, H.Covered streets:1. D6. D2. F5. F3. H4. H7. F and H8. Not covered (needs C, G, K)Missing street 8.But D, F, H don&#39;t cover street 8.Alternatively, replace H with G. Officers at D, F, G.Covered streets:1. D6. D and G2. F and G5. F7. F8. GMissing streets 3 (H-I-J-K) and 4 (A-E-H).Not good.Another try: officers at C, G, and H.Covered streets:1. C7. C and H8. C and G3. H4. H6. G2. G5. Not covered (B-F-I)So missing street 5.If we swap G with F, officers at C, F, H.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F7. C and F and H8. CMissing street 6 (D-G-J) and 8 (C-G-K). Wait, street 8 is C-G-K. If officer is at C, street 8 is covered. So only missing street 6.But street 6 is D-G-J. Need someone at D, G, J. Can&#39;t add.Wait, this is impossible. The problem must have a solution. Maybe the intended answer is C, F, G.But according to my analysis, that leaves streets 3 and 4 uncovered. Maybe I miscounted.Wait, street 3 is H-I-J-K. If none of the officers are at H, I, J, K, then street 3 is uncovered. But if we have officers at C, F, G, none are on H-I-J-K. So street 3 is uncovered.Similarly, street 4 is A-E-H. None of C, F, G are on A-E-H. So street 4 is uncovered.But the problem states that three officers suffice. Therefore, perhaps there&#39;s an intersection that covers both street 3 and 4, which is H. But as above, officers at H, F, G leave street 1 uncovered. If we take H, C, G.Covered streets:1. C3. H4. H6. G2. G5. Not covered7. C and H8. C and GMissing street 5. So officer needed at B, F, I.But we can&#39;t. Maybe the problem requires diagonal streets to be covered even if only part of them is covered. But no, the problem states that each street must have at least one officer. So each entire street must have at least one officer on it.Wait, maybe the diagonals count differently. For example, diagonal street H-F-C is considered a single street. If an officer is placed at F, that street is covered. Similarly, diagonal street C-G-K is covered if an officer is at G or C or K.But in that case, the horizontal and vertical streets are also considered single streets. So, for example, horizontal street A-B-C-D is a single street; having an officer at C covers that entire street.Similarly, vertical street A-E-H is a single street; an officer at H covers it.Given that, let&#39;s try the following:Officer at F: covers streets E-F-G (horizontal), B-F-I (vertical), H-F-C (diagonal).Officer at G: covers streets E-F-G (horizontal), D-G-J (vertical), C-G-K (diagonal).Officer at C: covers streets A-B-C-D (horizontal), H-F-C (diagonal), C-G-K (diagonal).Now, let&#39;s verify each street:1. A-B-C-D: Covered by C2. E-F-G: Covered by F and G3. H-I-J-K: Not covered (needs H, I, J, or K)4. A-E-H: Not covered (needs A, E, or H)5. B-F-I: Covered by F6. D-G-J: Covered by G7. H-F-C: Covered by F and C8. C-G-K: Covered by C and GSo streets 3 and 4 are not covered. Therefore, this trio is insufficient.Alternatively, replace C with H:Officers at F, G, H.Covered streets:1. Not covered2. F and G3. H4. H5. F6. G7. F and H8. GMissing street 1. Still a problem.Alternatively, officers at C, F, H.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. H4. H5. F6. Not covered7. C and F and H8. CMissing street 6. Not good.Wait, what if the answer is C, F, and K.Covered streets:1. C2. F3. K4. Not covered5. F6. Not covered7. C and F8. C and KMissing streets 4 and 6. So no.Alternatively, officers at C, H, J.Covered streets:1. C3. H4. H7. C and H8. C6. J2. Not covered5. Not coveredSo missing streets 2 and 5.No.This is really frustrating. Maybe the intended answer is C, F, and G, accepting that streets 3 and 4 are not covered, but that contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the figure has a different layout where, for example, intersection C is part of street H-I-J-K or something, but according to the problem description, it&#39;s not.Wait, the horizontal streets are:A-B-C-D,E-F-G,H-I-J-K.Vertical streets:A-E-H,B-F-I,D-G-J.Diagonals:H-F-C,C-G-K.So intersection C is on horizontal A-B-C-D, diagonal H-F-C, and diagonal C-G-K.Intersection H is on vertical A-E-H, diagonal H-F-C, and horizontal H-I-J-K.Intersection F is on horizontal E-F-G, vertical B-F-I, and diagonal H-F-C.Intersection G is on horizontal E-F-G, vertical D-G-J, and diagonal C-G-K.Intersection K is on horizontal H-I-J-K and diagonal C-G-K.So, if we place officers at H, F, and G:Covered streets:H: A-E-H (vertical), H-I-J-K (horizontal), H-F-C (diagonal)F: E-F-G (horizontal), B-F-I (vertical), H-F-C (diagonal)G: E-F-G (horizontal), D-G-J (vertical), C-G-K (diagonal)Thus, streets covered:1. A-B-C-D: Not covered2. E-F-G: Covered3. H-I-J-K: Covered4. A-E-H: Covered5. B-F-I: Covered6. D-G-J: Covered7. H-F-C: Covered8. C-G-K: CoveredMissing street 1: A-B-C-D. So officer at H, F, G leaves street 1 uncovered.But the problem states that three officers suffice. Maybe the answer is supposed to be H, F, G, but with a miscalculation regarding street 1.Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that street A-B-C-D is covered if any of its sub-streets are covered. But no, the problem states each street must have at least one officer.Wait, the problem says &quot;at least one police officer is on each of the 8 streets&quot;. So each of the 8 streets must have at least one officer stationed at any intersection along that street. Therefore, if we have officers at H, F, G, then:- Street 1: A-B-C-D: No officer. Not covered.But the problem requires all 8 streets to be covered. Therefore, this is invalid.Therefore, the only possible way is that there is a trio that covers all 8 streets. Given that I&#39;ve tried all combinations and none work, perhaps the intended answer is C, F, G, and the diagram has a different configuration where C is also on street H-I-J-K or something, but according to the problem statement, that&#39;s not the case.Alternatively, perhaps the diagonal streets are considered to cover multiple streets. For example, officer at C covers street 1 (A-B-C-D), 7 (H-F-C), and 8 (C-G-K). Officer at F covers streets 2 (E-F-G), 5 (B-F-I), 7 (H-F-C). Officer at G covers streets 2 (E-F-G), 6 (D-G-J), 8 (C-G-K). So together, C, F, G cover all streets except 3 (H-I-J-K) and 4 (A-E-H). But then, how are streets 3 and 4 covered?Wait, maybe the officer at C covers street 4 via some other connection? No, according to the problem statement, street 4 is A-E-H, which is a vertical street. C is not on that street.Similarly, street 3 is H-I-J-K, a horizontal street. None of the officers are at H, I, J, K.This is really confusing. I must be missing something.Wait, maybe officer at G is on street 3 via some connection? No, street 3 is H-I-J-K. G is not on that street.Wait, is there an error in the problem&#39;s street description? Let me double-check.Horizontal streets: A-B-C-D, E-F-G, H-I-J-K.Vertical streets: A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J.Diagonal streets: H-F-C, C-G-K.No, according to this, street 3 is H-I-J-K, which is separate from G. Therefore, officer at G doesn&#39;t cover street 3.Therefore, unless there is a trick, the answer must be C, F, and H.But as established earlier, this leaves street 6 (D-G-J) uncovered.Wait, street 6 is D-G-J. If officer at G is present, then street 6 is covered. Wait, in trio C, F, H, there is no officer at G. So street 6 is uncovered.Wait, officer at G is necessary to cover street 6. But then, how to cover street 3 and 4.This is impossible with three officers.But the problem states it&#39;s possible. Therefore, I must concede and consider that perhaps the intended answer is C, F, G, accepting that streets 3 and 4 are not covered, but that contradicts the problem&#39;s requirement.Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different interpretation. For example, a police officer at an intersection can monitor all streets that pass through that intersection, but not necessarily the entire street. However, the problem states &quot;at least one police officer is on each of the 8 streets&quot;, meaning that for each street, at least one of its intersections has an officer. Therefore, each street must have at least one officer stationed at one of its intersections.Given that, if I cannot find a trio that covers all 8 streets, I must have made a mistake.Wait, another approach: use set cover. The universe is 8 streets. We need to cover all with three intersections.Intersection coverage:A: {1,4}B: {1,5}C: {1,7,8}D: {1,6}E: {2,4}F: {2,5,7}G: {2,6,8}H: {3,4,7}I: {3,5}J: {3,6}K: {3,8}We need to select three sets (intersections) that cover all 8 streets.Let&#39;s look for intersections that cover unique streets.Street 4 is only covered by A, E, H.Street 6 is only covered by D, G, J.Street 8 is covered by C, G, K.Street 7 is covered by C, F, H.Street 3 is covered by H, I, J, K.To cover street 4, we need one of A, E, H.To cover street 6, we need one of D, G, J.To cover street 3, we need one of H, I, J, K.If we choose H, that covers street 3, 4, and 7.Then we need to cover street 6 and 8.Street 6: D, G, JStreet 8: C, G, KIf we choose G, that covers street 6 and 8, and also street 2.Then we have officers at H and G. Third officer needs to cover streets 1,5, remaining.Streets covered so far by H and G:3,4,7,6,8,2.Remaining streets: 1,5.Street 1: A, B, C, DStreet 5: B, F, ITo cover both street 1 and 5, the best is to choose B (covers 1 and 5), but B only covers streets 1 and 5.Alternatively, choose F, which covers street 5 and 2,7.But street 1 is still uncovered. So choose C, which covers street 1,7,8.So officers at H, G, C.Covered streets:H: 3,4,7G: 2,6,8C: 1,7,8Combined coverage: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8. Missing streets 5.Street 5: B-F-I. Not covered by H, G, C. So need officer at B, F, or I.But we can&#39;t add. Therefore, missing street 5.Alternatively, choose F instead of C.Officers at H, G, F.Covered streets:H: 3,4,7G: 2,6,8F: 2,5,7Combined coverage: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing street 1.Still missing street 1.Alternatively, choose officer at H, G, B.Covered:H: 3,4,7G: 2,6,8B: 1,5Combined coverage: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. All streets covered!Wait, this works! Officers at H, G, B.Let&#39;s verify:- Officer at B covers streets 1 (A-B-C-D) and 5 (B-F-I).- Officer at H covers streets 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H), and 7 (H-F-C).- Officer at G covers streets 2 (E-F-G), 6 (D-G-J), and 8 (C-G-K).All streets are covered:1. A-B-C-D: B2. E-F-G: G3. H-I-J-K: H4. A-E-H: H5. B-F-I: B6. D-G-J: G7. H-F-C: H8. C-G-K: GYes! This works. So the solution is placing officers at B, G, and H.But wait, according to the earlier analysis, officer at B covers streets 1 and 5.Officer at G covers 2,6,8.Officer at H covers 3,4,7.That covers all 8 streets. So the answer is B, G, H.But why didn&#39;t I think of this earlier? Because I was focusing on intersections that cover multiple streets, but B only covers two streets. However, combining B with H and G, which cover multiple streets, results in full coverage.So the suitable arrangement is officers at intersections B, G, and H.But let me verify again:- B is on street 1 (A-B-C-D) and 5 (B-F-I). So covers streets 1 and 5.- G is on street 2 (E-F-G), 6 (D-G-J), and 8 (C-G-K). So covers streets 2,6,8.- H is on street 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H), and 7 (H-F-C). So covers streets 3,4,7.All 8 streets are covered. Therefore, this is a valid solution.I didn&#39;t consider B initially because it only covers two streets, but in combination with G and H, it&#39;s efficient.Final AnswerThe police officers should be placed at intersections boxed{B}, boxed{G}, and boxed{H}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of placing three police officers at intersections such that each of the 8 streets is covered, we need to ensure that each street has at least one officer on it. The key is to find intersections that cover multiple streets efficiently.1. Identify the streets and intersections:   - Horizontal streets: (A-B-C-D), (E-F-G), (H-I-J-K)   - Vertical streets: (A-E-H), (B-F-I), (D-G-J)   - Diagonal streets: (H-F-C), (C-G-K)2. Analyze intersections covering multiple streets:   - Intersection B: Covers streets (A-B-C-D) (horizontal) and (B-F-I) (vertical).   - Intersection G: Covers streets (E-F-G) (horizontal), (D-G-J) (vertical), and (C-G-K) (diagonal).   - Intersection H: Covers streets (H-I-J-K) (horizontal), (A-E-H) (vertical), and (H-F-C) (diagonal).3. Verify coverage:   - Officer at B: Covers streets (A-B-C-D) and (B-F-I).   - Officer at G: Covers,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about placing three police officers at intersections in such a way that every one of the 8 streets has at least one police officer on it. The city has horizontal, vertical, and diagonal streets, totaling 8. The intersections are labeled from A to K. Hmm, let me try to visualize the figure based on the description.First, horizontal streets are three: A-B-C-D, E-F-G, and H-I-J-K. So, that&#39;s three horizontal lines. Then vertical streets are A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J. Wait, that&#39;s three vertical streets. Diagonal streets are H-F-C and C-G-K. That adds two more streets. So total is 3 horizontal + 3 vertical + 2 diagonal = 8 streets. Got it.So, the goal is to cover all these 8 streets with three police officers. Each officer is at an intersection, and each street must have at least one officer on it. So, we need to choose three intersections such that every street has at least one of these three intersections on it.First, maybe I should list all the streets and see which intersections are on them.Horizontal streets:1. A-B-C-D: So, covers A, B, C, D.2. E-F-G: Covers E, F, G.3. H-I-J-K: Covers H, I, J, K.Vertical streets:4. A-E-H: A, E, H.5. B-F-I: B, F, I.6. D-G-J: D, G, J.Diagonal streets:7. H-F-C: H, F, C.8. C-G-K: C, G, K.So, each street is a line connecting certain intersections. Now, we need to select three intersections such that each of these 8 streets has at least one of the selected intersections.Let me start by trying to identify intersections that are on multiple streets. Because placing an officer at a highly connected intersection could cover multiple streets at once.Looking at the intersections:- A: on horizontal 1 (A-B-C-D) and vertical 4 (A-E-H)- B: horizontal 1 and vertical 5 (B-F-I)- C: horizontal 1, diagonal 7 (H-F-C), and diagonal 8 (C-G-K)- D: horizontal 1 and vertical 6 (D-G-J)- E: horizontal 2 (E-F-G) and vertical 4- F: horizontal 2, vertical 5, diagonal 7- G: horizontal 2, vertical 6, diagonal 8- H: horizontal 3 (H-I-J-K), vertical 4, diagonal 7- I: horizontal 3 and vertical 5- J: horizontal 3 and vertical 6- K: horizontal 3 and diagonal 8So, intersections with the most streets are C, F, G, H. Let&#39;s check:- C is on horizontal 1, diagonal 7, and diagonal 8. So three streets.- F is on horizontal 2, vertical 5, diagonal 7. Three streets.- G is on horizontal 2, vertical 6, diagonal 8. Three streets.- H is on horizontal 3, vertical 4, diagonal 7. Three streets.So, these four intersections each cover three streets. Then, maybe choosing among these would be efficient.But we need to cover 8 streets with three officers. Let&#39;s see. If we can choose three intersections that cover all 8 streets without overlap, that would be ideal. However, there might be some overlaps.Let me try combinations.First, suppose we choose C. Then, C covers horizontal 1, diagonal 7 (H-F-C), and diagonal 8 (C-G-K). So, streets covered: 1,7,8. Remaining streets: 2,3,4,5,6.Then, let&#39;s pick F. F covers horizontal 2, vertical 5, diagonal 7. But diagonal 7 is already covered by C, so we get new streets 2 and 5. Now covered streets: 1,2,5,7,8. Remaining: 3,4,6.Third officer: Let&#39;s pick H. H covers horizontal 3, vertical 4, diagonal 7. Diagonal 7 is already covered, so new streets: 3 and 4. Now covered streets: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Remaining: 6 (D-G-J) and 6 is vertical street 6, which is D-G-J. Hmm, who covers vertical 6? D-G-J. So, D, G, J. So, none of the current officers (C, F, H) are on vertical 6. So vertical 6 is still uncovered. So this combination (C, F, H) leaves street 6 uncovered. So, not good.Alternatively, instead of H, maybe pick G as the third officer. Let&#39;s see.C covers 1,7,8.F covers 2,5,7.G covers 2 (already covered), 6,8 (already covered). So G would add street 6. So with C, F, G: covered streets are 1,2,5,6,7,8. Remaining: 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H), 5 (B-F-I, already covered by F). Wait, no: streets left would be 3 and 4. So need someone to cover H-I-J-K (street 3) and A-E-H (street 4). If we pick G as third officer, then maybe we need someone else.Wait, perhaps C, F, G. So streets covered:C: 1,7,8.F: 2,5,7.G: 2,6,8.So combined, covered streets: 1,2,5,6,7,8. Remaining: 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H). So need two more streets. But we only have three officers. So this is not enough.Alternatively, maybe pick H as third officer. Then C, F, H. As before, streets 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing street 6 (D-G-J) and 6 is vertical. So need someone at D, G, or J. If we can&#39;t add a fourth officer, perhaps adjust the selection.Alternatively, maybe choose different intersections. Let&#39;s try another approach.Suppose we pick F, G, and C. As above, but missing streets 3 and 4.Alternatively, pick H, F, and G. Let&#39;s check:H covers 3,4,7.F covers 2,5,7.G covers 2,6,8.Combined, covered streets: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing street 1 (A-B-C-D) and 8 is covered by G via C-G-K. Wait, street 1 is A-B-C-D. So, if we have H, F, G, then street 1 (A-B-C-D) is not covered. So need someone at A, B, C, or D. H is not on that street. F is not on that street. G is not on that street. So we need to replace one officer with someone on street 1.But we only have three officers. So maybe H, F, C? Let&#39;s see:H covers 3,4,7.F covers 2,5,7.C covers 1,7,8.Combined: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing street 6 (D-G-J). So street 6 is D-G-J. So need someone at D, G, or J. But we have H, F, C. None of them are on street 6. Therefore, we need to replace one officer. For example, replace H with G. Then C, F, G. As before, which misses streets 3 and 4. So street 3 is H-I-J-K. So if we have G instead of H, then street 3 is not covered. So this seems like a problem.Alternatively, maybe pick C, G, and H. Let&#39;s see:C covers 1,7,8.G covers 2,6,8.H covers 3,4,7.Combined: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8. Missing streets 5 (B-F-I) and maybe not. Wait, street 5 is B-F-I. Is that covered? None of C, G, H are on street 5. So street 5 is missing. So, no good.Hmm. So perhaps another combination. Let&#39;s see, maybe F, G, and someone else.F covers 2,5,7.G covers 2,6,8.So together they cover 2,5,6,7,8. Need to cover 1,3,4.So third officer needs to cover streets 1 (A-B-C-D), 3 (H-I-J-K), and 4 (A-E-H). That&#39;s three streets. So the third officer must be on all three? But intersections can only be on some streets. Let&#39;s see:Street 1: A-B-C-D. To cover street 1, the officer must be at A, B, C, or D.Street 3: H-I-J-K. To cover street 3, officer must be at H, I, J, K.Street 4: A-E-H. To cover street 4, officer must be at A, E, H.So the third officer needs to be at an intersection that is on street 1, 3, or 4. But if we need to cover all three streets with one officer, is that possible? Let&#39;s check intersections:- A is on street 1 and 4. So if we place an officer at A, they cover street 1 and 4. Then street 3 (H-I-J-K) remains. So we still need someone on street 3. But we only have three officers. So with F, G, A: covered streets are 1,2,4,5,6,7,8. Missing streets 3 and 3 is H-I-J-K, which needs an officer at H, I, J, or K. But we have only three officers. So maybe A is not enough.Alternatively, place the third officer at H. H is on street 3 and 4 and diagonal 7. So if we have F, G, H:F: 2,5,7G: 2,6,8H: 3,4,7Combined: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing street 1 (A-B-C-D). So need someone on street 1. But only three officers. So this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, third officer at C. So F, G, C:F: 2,5,7G: 2,6,8C: 1,7,8Combined: 1,2,5,6,7,8. Missing 3,4. So again, need someone on 3 and 4. Not possible.Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let&#39;s think about covering the diagonal streets since there are only two, and they might be the trickier ones.Diagonal streets are H-F-C and C-G-K. So these two diagonals. If we can cover both diagonals with one officer, that would be great. But H-F-C and C-G-K intersect at C. So if we place an officer at C, they cover both diagonals. Because C is on both H-F-C and C-G-K. So C is a good candidate for covering both diagonals. Then, if we place an officer at C, that takes care of diagonals 7 and 8, and horizontal street 1 (A-B-C-D). Then, remaining streets are 2,3,4,5,6.Then, perhaps place another officer at F. F covers horizontal 2 (E-F-G), vertical 5 (B-F-I), and diagonal 7 (H-F-C). But diagonal 7 is already covered by C, so F would cover streets 2 and 5. Now covered streets: 1,2,5,7,8. Remaining: 3,4,6.Third officer needs to cover streets 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H), and 6 (D-G-J). To cover street 3, officer needs to be at H, I, J, K. To cover street 4, officer needs to be at A, E, H. To cover street 6, officer needs to be at D, G, J. So the third officer must be at an intersection that is on street 3, 4, and 6. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s such an intersection.Looking at street 3: H-I-J-K. Street 4: A-E-H. Street 6: D-G-J. The intersection H is on street 3 and 4 but not 6. J is on street 3 and 6 but not 4. A, E, D, G are on other streets. So there&#39;s no intersection that is on streets 3, 4, and 6. Therefore, the third officer can cover at most two of these streets. Let&#39;s see:If we place the third officer at H: covers streets 3,4,7 (but 7 is already covered). So streets 3 and 4. Then street 6 (D-G-J) remains. So we still need someone on street 6. But we have only three officers. So this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, place the third officer at J: covers street 3 and 6. Then street 4 (A-E-H) remains. So need someone at A, E, or H. But we already have three officers: C, F, J. So street 4 is not covered. Similarly, if we place officer at D: covers street 6 (D-G-J) and street 1 (A-B-C-D, already covered). So only street 6. Then street 3 and 4 still need coverage. Not helpful.Alternatively, third officer at G: G is on street 2 (E-F-G, already covered by F), street 6 (D-G-J), and diagonal 8 (C-G-K, already covered by C). So G would cover street 6. Then remaining streets 3 and 4. So with officers at C, F, G: covered streets 1,2,5,6,7,8. Missing 3,4. Again, same problem.Alternatively, maybe third officer at E: E is on street 2 (E-F-G, covered by F) and street 4 (A-E-H). So E would cover street 4. Then, remaining streets 3 and 6. So we need someone else. But we can&#39;t add a fourth officer. So, stuck again.Hmm. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t working. Let&#39;s try different starting points.Suppose we start with officer at F. Covers streets 2,5,7.Second officer at G. Covers streets 2,6,8.Third officer at H. Covers streets 3,4,7.So combined: streets 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing streets 1 (A-B-C-D) and... wait, street 8 is C-G-K, which is covered by G. Street 1 is A-B-C-D, which is not covered by any of F, G, H. So missing street 1. Therefore, need an officer on street 1. But only three officers. So maybe replace one.If instead of H, pick C as the third officer. So F, G, C. Then covered streets: 2,5,7 (F); 2,6,8 (G); 1,7,8 (C). So combined: 1,2,5,6,7,8. Missing 3,4. So again, same issue.Alternatively, replace G with J. So F, J, H. Let&#39;s see:F: 2,5,7.J: 3 (H-I-J-K), 6 (D-G-J).H: 3,4,7.Combined: 2,3,4,5,6,7. Missing streets 1,8. So street 1 (A-B-C-D) and 8 (C-G-K). So need someone at street 1 or 8. But only three officers. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe officer at C, F, and J. C covers 1,7,8. F covers 2,5,7. J covers 3,6. So combined: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing streets 4 (A-E-H) and... 4. So need someone at A, E, or H. But only three officers. So this is missing street 4.Hmm. Maybe we need to accept that some streets will be covered by multiple officers. Let&#39;s see.Perhaps instead of trying to cover the diagonals first, try to cover the verticals and horizontals. Let&#39;s see.There are 3 horizontal streets: A-B-C-D, E-F-G, H-I-J-K.3 vertical streets: A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J.2 diagonals: H-F-C, C-G-K.Suppose we place an officer at F. Covers horizontal 2 (E-F-G), vertical 5 (B-F-I), diagonal 7 (H-F-C). So three streets.Another officer at C. Covers horizontal 1 (A-B-C-D), diagonal 7 and 8 (H-F-C, C-G-K). But diagonal 7 is already covered by F, so C covers horizontal 1 and diagonal 8.Third officer. Let&#39;s see, remaining streets: vertical 4 (A-E-H), vertical 6 (D-G-J), horizontal 3 (H-I-J-K). So streets 3,4,6.Need to cover these with one officer. The third officer must be on street 3, 4, and 6. As before, there&#39;s no such intersection. But perhaps an officer can cover two of them.If we place the third officer at H: covers horizontal 3 (H-I-J-K), vertical 4 (A-E-H), and diagonal 7 (already covered). So streets 3 and 4. Then street 6 (D-G-J) is still uncovered. So need someone else, but can&#39;t.Alternatively, officer at J: covers horizontal 3 and vertical 6. Then vertical 4 (A-E-H) remains. So need an officer at A, E, or H. But only three officers. So with F, C, J: streets covered are 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing 4.Alternatively, officer at D: covers horizontal 1 (already covered by C) and vertical 6 (D-G-J). So vertical 6 is covered. Then street 3 (H-I-J-K) and 4 (A-E-H) remain. Again, need two more streets.Alternatively, third officer at G: covers vertical 6 (D-G-J), horizontal 2 (E-F-G, already covered), and diagonal 8 (C-G-K, already covered). So covers vertical 6. Then streets 3 and 4 remain. So again, same problem.This is frustrating. Maybe there&#39;s a different combination. Let&#39;s try another approach. Let&#39;s list all possible triplets and check coverage.But there are 11 intersections, so C(11,3)=165 combinations. That&#39;s too many. Instead, maybe focus on key intersections.Wait, another idea. The problem states that it&#39;s sufficient to provide at least one suitable arrangement. Maybe there is a standard solution for such problems. Let me think.In covering problems like this, sometimes the optimal solution involves covering the most &quot;unique&quot; streets. Let&#39;s see.Looking at the diagonal streets: H-F-C and C-G-K. These are the only two diagonals. If we can cover both with one officer at C, that&#39;s efficient. Then, need to cover the rest.If we place an officer at C, that covers horizontal 1, diagonal 7, diagonal 8.Then, for horizontal streets, we still have E-F-G and H-I-J-K. For vertical streets, A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J. So remaining streets: E-F-G, H-I-J-K, A-E-H, B-F-I, D-G-J.If we place an officer at F. Then F covers E-F-G (horizontal 2), B-F-I (vertical 5), and H-F-C (diagonal 7, already covered). So F would cover streets 2 and 5.Now, remaining streets: H-I-J-K (3), A-E-H (4), D-G-J (6).Third officer needs to cover 3,4,6. As before, no single intersection covers all three. So maybe officer at H. Then H covers 3 (H-I-J-K), 4 (A-E-H), and diagonal 7 (already covered). So covers 3 and 4. Then D-G-J (street 6) remains. So we need someone at D, G, or J. But we have only three officers. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, third officer at J. J is on 3 (H-I-J-K) and 6 (D-G-J). So covers 3 and 6. Then street 4 (A-E-H) remains. So need someone at A, E, or H. But only three officers. So if we have C, F, J, then streets covered: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing 4 (A-E-H). So not good.Alternatively, third officer at E. E is on street 2 (E-F-G, covered) and 4 (A-E-H). So covers 4. Then streets 3 and 6 remain. So need someone else. No good.Wait, maybe third officer at G. G is on street 2 (E-F-G, covered), 6 (D-G-J), and 8 (C-G-K, covered). So covers 6. Then streets 3 and 4 remain. Still need two more.This seems like a recurring issue. Maybe the problem requires overlapping coverage. Let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a combination where two officers cover street 4 and 6 through overlapping.Wait, street 4 is A-E-H. If we have an officer at H, that covers street 4 and 3. Then street 6 is D-G-J. If we have an officer at G, that covers street 6 and 8. Then with C, F, G, H: Wait, but that&#39;s four officers. Not allowed.Alternatively, officer at H and officer at J. H covers 3 and 4. J covers 3 and 6. Together, H and J cover 3,4,6. But that&#39;s two officers. Then with C and F, total four. Not allowed.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s an intersection that can cover street 4 and 6 via different streets. For example, officer at G: covers street 6 (D-G-J) and 8 (C-G-K). Not street 4. Officer at E: covers street 4 and 2. But E is on street 2 and 4.Alternatively, officer at A: covers street 1 and 4. Then with officers at C, F, A. Let&#39;s check:C covers 1,7,8.F covers 2,5,7.A covers 1,4.Combined: streets 1,2,4,5,7,8. Missing 3,6. So third officer needs to cover 3 and 6. But officer at A can&#39;t. So third officer could be J: covers 3 and 6. Then total officers: C, F, A, J. Four, which is over the limit.Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe there&#39;s a different trio. Let&#39;s try B, G, H.B is on street 1 (A-B-C-D) and vertical 5 (B-F-I). So covers 1 and 5.G is on street 2 (E-F-G), vertical 6 (D-G-J), diagonal 8 (C-G-K). So covers 2,6,8.H is on street 3 (H-I-J-K), vertical 4 (A-E-H), diagonal 7 (H-F-C). So covers 3,4,7.Combined: streets 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. All covered! Wait, is this possible? Let&#39;s check each street:1. A-B-C-D: Covered by B.2. E-F-G: Covered by G.3. H-I-J-K: Covered by H.4. A-E-H: Covered by H.5. B-F-I: Covered by B.6. D-G-J: Covered by G.7. H-F-C: Covered by H.8. C-G-K: Covered by G.Yes! All streets are covered. So officers at B, G, H.Wait, that works. So why didn&#39;t I think of this before? Maybe because B is not one of the high-coverage intersections (only two streets). But by combining B, G, H, we manage to cover all streets. Let&#39;s verify again.Officer at B: covers horizontal 1 (A-B-C-D) and vertical 5 (B-F-I).Officer at G: covers horizontal 2 (E-F-G), vertical 6 (D-G-J), diagonal 8 (C-G-K).Officer at H: covers horizontal 3 (H-I-J-K), vertical 4 (A-E-H), diagonal 7 (H-F-C).Yes, all eight streets are covered. So this is a valid solution: B, G, H.Alternatively, are there other combinations? Let&#39;s check.Alternatively, officer at F, G, H. Let&#39;s check:F covers 2,5,7.G covers 2,6,8.H covers 3,4,7.Combined: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing 1 (A-B-C-D). So not good.Officer at B, F, G:B: 1,5.F: 2,5,7.G: 2,6,8.Combined: 1,2,5,6,7,8. Missing 3,4. Not good.But officer at B, G, H worked. Let me check another combination. For example, officer at B, G, K.B: 1,5.G: 2,6,8.K: 3 (H-I-J-K) and 8 (C-G-K). Wait, K is on street 3 and 8.So combined: streets 1,2,3,5,6,8. Missing 4,7. So need more.Hmm. So B, G, H seems to be the magic trio. Let me check another possible trio.How about C, F, J.C: 1,7,8.F: 2,5,7.J: 3,6.Combined: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing 4 (A-E-H). So need someone at A, E, or H. But only three officers.Alternatively, C, F, E.C: 1,7,8.F: 2,5,7.E: 2 (E-F-G) and 4 (A-E-H).Combined: 1,2,4,5,7,8. Missing 3,6. So need someone else. Not good.Another combination: C, I, G.C: 1,7,8.I: 3 (H-I-J-K) and vertical 5 (B-F-I).G: 2,6,8.Combined: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing 4. So officer at I would cover street 5 but not 4. So need someone at H, A, or E. So not covered.Alternatively, officer at C, H, G.C: 1,7,8.H: 3,4,7.G: 2,6,8.Combined: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8. Missing 5 (B-F-I). So need someone at B, F, or I. But only three officers. Not covered.Wait, but in the B, G, H combination, all streets are covered. Let me check again:- Street 1: A-B-C-D. Officer at B.- Street 2: E-F-G. Officer at G.- Street 3: H-I-J-K. Officer at H.- Street 4: A-E-H. Officer at H.- Street 5: B-F-I. Officer at B.- Street 6: D-G-J. Officer at G.- Street 7: H-F-C. Officer at H.- Street 8: C-G-K. Officer at G.Yes, every street has at least one officer. So B, G, H is a valid solution.Is there another combination? Let&#39;s see. Maybe D, F, H.D is on 1 (A-B-C-D) and 6 (D-G-J).F: 2,5,7.H: 3,4,7.Combined: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Missing 8 (C-G-K). So need someone at C, G, or K. Can&#39;t add.Alternatively, officer at G instead of D: F, G, H. As before, missing street 1.Alternatively, officer at C, F, H: covered streets 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing 6.But B, G, H works. So I think that&#39;s the answer.Alternatively, maybe another combination. Let me check intersections B, G, and H.Another possible trio: F, G, H.F: 2,5,7.G: 2,6,8.H: 3,4,7.Combined: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing 1. So not good.Alternatively, officer at B, F, H.B: 1,5.F: 2,5,7.H: 3,4,7.Combined: 1,2,3,4,5,7. Missing 6,8. So need G or C or K.But with three officers: no.So yes, B, G, H is the only combination I found so far that covers all streets. Let me see if there are others.How about officer at B, F, G.B: 1,5.F: 2,5,7.G: 2,6,8.Combined: 1,2,5,6,7,8. Missing 3,4. So no.Another idea: officer at B, E, G.B: 1,5.E: 2,4.G: 2,6,8.Combined: 1,2,4,5,6,8. Missing 3,7. Not good.Alternatively, officer at B, H, J.B: 1,5.H: 3,4,7.J: 3,6.Combined: 1,3,4,5,6,7. Missing 2,8. Not good.Hmm. It seems like B, G, H is the only trio that covers all eight streets. Let me check once more.B is on street 1 and 5.G is on street 2,6,8.H is on street 3,4,7.So:1: B2: G3: H4: H5: B6: G7: H8: GYes, all eight streets. Perfect. So the answer is B, G, H.I think that&#39;s the solution. Let me see if there are other possible solutions. Maybe another trio.How about officer at F, G, K.F: 2,5,7.G: 2,6,8.K: 3,8.Combined: 2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing 1,4. Not good.Officer at C, G, H.C:1,7,8.G:2,6,8.H:3,4,7.Combined:1,2,3,4,6,7,8. Missing 5. So street 5 (B-F-I). Need someone at B, F, or I. Can&#39;t add.Officer at C, F, H: covered streets 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing 6.So no.Another possibility: officer at F, I, G.F:2,5,7.I:3,5.G:2,6,8.Combined:2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing 1,4.No.How about officer at A, G, H.A:1,4.G:2,6,8.H:3,4,7.Combined:1,2,3,4,6,7,8. Missing 5.So street 5 (B-F-I) is uncovered. Need officer at B, F, or I. Can&#39;t.Another trio: officer at B, F, H.B:1,5.F:2,5,7.H:3,4,7.Combined:1,2,3,4,5,7. Missing 6,8.So not good.Alternatively, officer at B, G, K.B:1,5.G:2,6,8.K:3,8.Combined:1,2,3,5,6,8. Missing 4,7.No.Alternatively, officer at D, G, H.D:1,6.G:2,6,8.H:3,4,7.Combined:1,2,3,4,6,7,8. Missing 5.Street 5 (B-F-I) uncovered.Hmm. It seems that B, G, H is the only trio that covers all eight streets. Let me confirm once more.Yes, B covers street 1 and 5. G covers 2,6,8. H covers 3,4,7. All streets accounted for. Therefore, the answer is B, G, H.Final AnswerThe police officers should be placed at intersections boxed{B}, boxed{G}, and boxed{H}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of placing three police officers at intersections such that all 8 streets are covered, we need to ensure each street has at least one officer. The streets are divided into horizontal, vertical, and diagonal categories. Key steps leading to the solution:1. Identify intersections covering multiple streets: Intersections like B, G, and H were considered due to their coverage of multiple streets.2. Check coverage for each combination: Various combinations of intersections were evaluated to ensure all streets are covered.3. Verify the final combination: The combination of intersections B, G, and H was found to cover all 8 streets.Final Answer:The police officers should be placed at intersections boxed{B}, boxed{G}, and boxed{H}. Verification:- B covers horizontal street A-B-C-D and vertical street B-F-I.- G covers horizontal street E-F-G, vertical street D-G-J, and diagonal street C-G-K.- H covers horizontal street H-I-J-K, vertical street A-E-H, and diagonal street H-F-C.All 8 streets are covered by these three intersections.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b904caef></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>🔑:</span>Answer: B, G, H.Solution. The option will work if police officers are placed at intersections B, G, H. It can be shown that this is the only possible option.Since there are only three vertical streets, and each must have one police officer, there are definitely no police officers at intersections C and K. Therefore, there must be a police officer at intersection G. Then, on street E-F-G, there are no more police officers (since there is at least one police officer on streets A-B-C-D and H-I-J-K). On street C-F-H, there must be a police officer, and he can only be placed at intersection H. The streets A-B-C-D and B-F-I remain uncovered, so the third police officer needs to be placed at intersection B.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-5cba23f0 data-v-b904caef><div class="review" data-v-b904caef><div class="review-title" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>❓:</span>Let ABCD be a square of side length 1, and let E and F be points on BC and DC such that angle{EAF}=30^circ and CE=CF.

So, we have a square ABCD with side length 1. Points E and F are on sides BC and DC respectively, such that angle EAF is 30 degrees, and CE equals CF. We need to find the length of BD. Wait, BD is the diagonal of the square, right? Since it&#39;s a square with side length 1, the diagonal should be √2. But maybe I&#39;m missing something here. Let me check the problem again.Wait, the problem says &quot;Determine the length of BD.&quot; But BD is the diagonal of the square ABCD. In a square, the diagonal length is side length times √2, so that&#39;s 1*√2 = √2. But that seems too straightforward. The rest of the problem mentions points E and F with angle EAF 30 degrees and CE=CF. Maybe BD isn&#39;t the diagonal? Wait, no. In a square ABCD, the vertices are ordered such that AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. So, BD would be connecting vertices B and D. Let me visualize the square: A is top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left. Then BD would be from top-right to bottom-left, which is indeed a diagonal, same as AC. Both diagonals in a square are equal and have length √2. So maybe the problem is a trick question? But why mention points E and F then?Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: &quot;Let ABCD be a square of side length 1, and let E and F be points on BC and DC such that angle EAF=30 degrees and CE=CF. Determine the length of BD.&quot; Hmm, BD is definitely the diagonal, which is √2. Maybe there&#39;s a typo in the problem? Or maybe BD refers to something else? Wait, in the square ABCD, the points are labeled in order, so BD is indeed a diagonal. Unless the square is labeled differently, but standard labeling would have BD as a diagonal.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D? But the problem doesn&#39;t mention 3D. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe BD is a segment connecting B to D through some other points? But no, BD is just the diagonal. The problem must have a typo, or perhaps BD is a different segment? Wait, the original problem is from 2015 CCA Math Bonanza Lightning Round #4.2. Maybe the original problem had a different figure? Wait, but the user has provided the problem as is.Alternatively, maybe BD is BE or something else? Wait, no. The problem states &quot;Determine the length of BD.&quot; So BD is the diagonal. Maybe the points E and F are red herrings? But that seems unlikely. Wait, in that case, why specify angle EAF and CE=CF? Maybe BD is not the diagonal but another segment? Wait, unless there&#39;s a typo and they meant BE, BF, EF, or something else? But the problem says BD. Let me check once more.Wait, perhaps BD is not the diagonal but a line from B to D passing through some point? But no, BD is just the straight line from B to D. In a square, that&#39;s the diagonal. So, regardless of points E and F, BD remains √2. Therefore, maybe the answer is indeed √2. But that seems too straightforward, especially since the problem is from a competition, which usually has non-trivial problems. Therefore, perhaps I misread the problem.Wait, let me read the problem again. &quot;Let ABCD be a square of side length 1, and let E and F be points on BC and DC such that angle EAF=30 degrees and CE=CF. Determine the length of BD.&quot;Wait a second. Maybe BD is not the diagonal but another segment? For example, in some contexts, BD could be a median or something else. Wait, no, in a square ABCD, BD is unambiguously the diagonal. Unless the square is labeled differently. Wait, maybe the square is labeled in a different order. If the square is labeled A, B, C, D clockwise, then BD is the diagonal. If it&#39;s labeled differently, maybe not. But standard labeling is clockwise or counter-clockwise. Let me confirm the standard labeling.In standard notation, square ABCD has vertices in order, so that AB is adjacent to BC, etc., either clockwise or counter-clockwise. So, if you have a square, the order is typically such that moving from A to B to C to D brings you back to A, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Therefore, BD is a diagonal in either case.Wait, unless the problem is using a different notation where BD is a side? But BD would have to connect two adjacent vertices for that, but in a square, adjacent vertices are connected by sides of length 1. BD as a diagonal is length √2. Therefore, the problem must have a typo, or the answer is indeed √2, and the information about E and F is extraneous. But competition problems usually don&#39;t have extraneous information. Therefore, maybe I misread something.Wait, maybe BD is BE or ED? But the problem says BD. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not in 2D? Wait, no, it&#39;s a square, so 2D. Wait, perhaps there is a reflection or something? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the length of EF, but the user mistyped it as BD? Because BD is straightforward. Alternatively, maybe BD is a different segment in the figure that&#39;s not the diagonal? But according to the problem statement, it&#39;s just the square ABCD with points E and F on BC and DC.Wait, let me try to parse the problem again. &quot;Let ABCD be a square of side length 1, and let E and F be points on BC and DC such that angle EAF=30 degrees and CE=CF. Determine the length of BD.&quot;Wait, CE=CF. Since E is on BC and F is on DC, CE and CF are segments on BC and DC respectively. Since BC and DC are sides of the square of length 1, CE=CF implies that E and F are equidistant from point C. So, if CE=CF=x, then E is x units away from C on BC, and F is x units away from C on DC. Therefore, BE = BC - CE = 1 - x, and DF = DC - CF = 1 - x.Therefore, coordinates: Let&#39;s assign coordinates to the square. Let me place point A at (0,1), B at (1,1), C at (1,0), D at (0,0). Therefore, BC is from (1,1) to (1,0), which is actually BC is vertical, but wait, in standard notation, ABCD is a square. Wait, maybe my coordinate system is off.Wait, if ABCD is a square, let&#39;s assign coordinates more carefully. Let me define the square with A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1,1), D at (0,1). Wait, no, that would make AB horizontal, BC vertical, etc. Wait, in standard notation, moving around the square, so if A is at (0,0), then B would be (1,0), C (1,1), D (0,1). Then BD would be from (1,0) to (0,1), which is a diagonal of length √2. Alternatively, if the square is labeled differently, but BD is still a diagonal. Hmm.But maybe assigning coordinates would help. Let me try that. Let&#39;s set coordinate system with point A at (0,1), B at (1,1), C at (1,0), D at (0,0). So AB is horizontal from (0,1) to (1,1), BC is vertical from (1,1) to (1,0), CD is horizontal from (1,0) to (0,0), and DA is vertical from (0,0) to (0,1). Then BD would be from (1,1) to (0,0), which is the diagonal, length √[(1)^2 + (1)^2] = √2. So BD is indeed the diagonal. Therefore, regardless of points E and F, BD is √2. But the problem gives conditions about E and F. So why are they asking for BD? Maybe the problem was supposed to ask for EF or AE or AF?Wait, maybe the original problem had a different figure, but in the version presented here, it&#39;s BD. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that BD is related to E and F in some way. Wait, but BD is fixed as the diagonal. Unless the square is not of side length 1? Wait, no, the problem says side length 1. Therefore, BD must be √2. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check the problem&#39;s source: 2015 CCA Math Bonanza Lightning Round #4.2. Lightning Round problems are usually quick, but maybe this is a trick question where BD is indeed the diagonal, and the rest is a distraction.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D, but it just mentions a square, which is 2D. Alternatively, maybe the problem involves some projective geometry or something else. Alternatively, maybe the points E and F are placed such that BD is something else? Wait, but BD is a diagonal of the square, independent of E and F.Alternatively, perhaps BD is a typo, and the problem meant BE or BF or ED or FD. For example, if the problem asked for EF, then we would need to use the given conditions. Let me check: If BD is a diagonal, answer is √2, but given the problem&#39;s context, maybe the answer is different. Wait, let me check the angle EAF=30 degrees.If I consider points E on BC and F on DC, such that CE=CF, and angle EAF=30 degrees, then perhaps we can find coordinates of E and F, and maybe BD is related. But since BD is fixed, maybe the problem is a trick. Alternatively, maybe BD is not the diagonal but another segment. Wait, unless BD is a segment from B to D through points E and F? Wait, but BD is a straight line; unless E and F are on BD, but BD is the diagonal from B(1,1) to D(0,0) in my coordinate system. Then points on BD would satisfy y = -x +1. But E is on BC, which is the vertical line x=1 from (1,1) to (1,0), and F is on DC, which is the horizontal line y=0 from (1,0) to (0,0). So BD is the line from (1,1) to (0,0), passing through (1,0) which is point C. Wait, but point C is (1,0). So BD is from (1,1) to (0,0), passing through (1,0)? Wait, no. Wait, if you draw a diagonal from B(1,1) to D(0,0), it goes through the point (0.5,0.5), the center, but not through C(1,0). So E is on BC (from (1,1) to (1,0)) and F is on DC (from (1,0) to (0,0)). So E is somewhere on the vertical edge BC, and F is somewhere on the horizontal edge DC. CE=CF, so if CE=CF=x, then E is (1, x) and F is (1 - x, 0). Wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify.In the coordinate system where A is (0,1), B is (1,1), C is (1,0), D is (0,0). Then BC is the vertical segment from (1,1) to (1,0). So point E is on BC, so its coordinates are (1, y) where y ranges from 1 to 0. Similarly, DC is the horizontal segment from (1,0) to (0,0), so point F is on DC, coordinates (x, 0) where x ranges from 1 to 0. Then CE is the distance from C(1,0) to E(1,y), which is |y - 0| = |y|. Similarly, CF is the distance from C(1,0) to F(x,0), which is |1 - x|. Since CE=CF, we have |y| = |1 - x|. Since E is on BC, y is between 0 and 1, so CE = y. Similarly, F is on DC, x is between 0 and 1, so CF = 1 - x. Therefore, y = 1 - x. Therefore, coordinates of E are (1, 1 - x) and coordinates of F are (x, 0), where x is between 0 and 1. So, we can parameterize E and F by x.Now, angle EAF is 30 degrees. Let&#39;s find the coordinates of E and F such that angle EAF=30 degrees. Point A is (0,1). So, angle EAF is the angle at point A between points E and F. So, vectors AE and AF. Let&#39;s compute vectors AE and AF. Vector AE goes from A(0,1) to E(1, 1 - x): so the vector is (1 - 0, (1 - x) - 1) = (1, -x). Vector AF goes from A(0,1) to F(x, 0): vector is (x - 0, 0 - 1) = (x, -1). The angle between vectors AE and AF is 30 degrees. So, using the dot product formula:cos(theta) = (AE · AF) / (|AE| |AF|)Given theta = 30 degrees, so cos(theta) = √3 / 2.Compute the dot product AE · AF = (1)(x) + (-x)(-1) = x + x = 2x.Compute |AE|: sqrt(1^2 + (-x)^2) = sqrt(1 + x^2).Compute |AF|: sqrt(x^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(x^2 + 1).Therefore, cos(theta) = 2x / (sqrt(1 + x^2) * sqrt(1 + x^2)) ) = 2x / (1 + x^2).Set this equal to √3 / 2:2x / (1 + x^2) = √3 / 2Multiply both sides by (1 + x^2):2x = (√3 / 2)(1 + x^2)Multiply both sides by 2:4x = √3 (1 + x^2)Rearrange:√3 x^2 - 4x + √3 = 0This is a quadratic equation in x. Let&#39;s write it as:√3 x² - 4x + √3 = 0We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:x = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 4 * √3 * √3)] / (2 * √3)Simplify the discriminant:sqrt(16 - 4 * 3) = sqrt(16 - 12) = sqrt(4) = 2Therefore, x = [4 ± 2]/(2√3) = (4 + 2)/(2√3) or (4 - 2)/(2√3) = 6/(2√3)=3/√3=√3 or 2/(2√3)=1/√3.But x must be between 0 and 1 because F is on DC. √3 ≈1.732, which is greater than 1, so we discard that solution. The other solution is x=1/√3≈0.577, which is between 0 and 1. So x=1/√3.Therefore, coordinates of F are (x, 0) = (1/√3, 0), and coordinates of E are (1, 1 - x) = (1, 1 - 1/√3). But we need to confirm this.Wait, so x = 1/√3, so CF = 1 - x = 1 - 1/√3, but CE is supposed to be equal to CF. CE = y = 1 - x = 1 - 1/√3. Wait, but E is at (1, 1 - x) = (1, 1 - 1/√3). Therefore, CE = 1 - (1 - 1/√3) = 1/√3, which is equal to CF = 1 - x = 1 - 1/√3. Wait, no: CE is the distance from C(1,0) to E(1, 1 - 1/√3), which is along the y-axis, so CE = |1 - 1/√3 - 0| = 1 - 1/√3. Similarly, CF is the distance from C(1,0) to F(1/√3,0), which is along the x-axis, so CF = 1 - 1/√3. Therefore, CE=CF=1 - 1/√3. Wait, but earlier, we had CE=CF=x. Wait, maybe there was confusion in variable names.Wait, let me re-express this. Let me define CE = CF = t. Then, since E is on BC, which is vertical from (1,1) to (1,0), CE = t implies E is at (1, t). Similarly, F is on DC, which is horizontal from (1,0) to (0,0), so CF = t implies F is at (1 - t, 0). Then, we need to compute angle EAF=30 degrees.Coordinates: A is (0,1), E is (1, t), F is (1 - t, 0). Then vectors AE and AF:AE vector: from A(0,1) to E(1, t): (1 - 0, t - 1) = (1, t - 1)AF vector: from A(0,1) to F(1 - t, 0): (1 - t - 0, 0 - 1) = (1 - t, -1)Then the angle between AE and AF is 30 degrees.Dot product: AE · AF = (1)(1 - t) + (t - 1)(-1) = (1 - t) - (t - 1) = 1 - t - t + 1 = 2 - 2tMagnitude of AE: sqrt(1^2 + (t - 1)^2) = sqrt(1 + (t - 1)^2)Magnitude of AF: sqrt((1 - t)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt((1 - t)^2 + 1) = sqrt(1 - 2t + t^2 + 1) = sqrt(t^2 - 2t + 2)Therefore, cos(theta) = (2 - 2t) / [sqrt(1 + (t - 1)^2) * sqrt(t^2 - 2t + 2)]But theta is 30 degrees, so cos(theta) = √3 / 2.Therefore:(2 - 2t) / [sqrt(1 + (t - 1)^2) * sqrt(t^2 - 2t + 2)] = √3 / 2Let me simplify the denominator:sqrt(1 + (t - 1)^2) = sqrt(1 + t^2 - 2t + 1) = sqrt(t^2 - 2t + 2)Therefore, denominator becomes sqrt(t^2 - 2t + 2) * sqrt(t^2 - 2t + 2) = (t^2 - 2t + 2)Therefore, the equation simplifies to:(2 - 2t) / (t^2 - 2t + 2) = √3 / 2Cross-multiplying:2(2 - 2t) = √3 (t^2 - 2t + 2)Simplify left side: 4 - 4tRight side: √3 t^2 - 2√3 t + 2√3Bring all terms to one side:√3 t^2 - 2√3 t + 2√3 - 4 + 4t = 0Combine like terms:√3 t^2 + (-2√3 + 4) t + (2√3 - 4) = 0This is a quadratic in t: let&#39;s write it as:√3 t² + (4 - 2√3) t + (2√3 - 4) = 0Let me factor out common terms or see if it&#39;s factorable. Alternatively, use quadratic formula.Quadratic formula:t = [ - (4 - 2√3) ± sqrt( (4 - 2√3)^2 - 4 * √3 * (2√3 - 4) ) ] / (2 * √3 )First compute discriminant:D = (4 - 2√3)^2 - 4 * √3 * (2√3 - 4)Expand (4 - 2√3)^2:= 16 - 16√3 + 12= 28 - 16√3Compute 4 * √3 * (2√3 -4):= 4√3 * 2√3 - 4√3 * 4= 8 * 3 - 16√3= 24 - 16√3Therefore, D = (28 - 16√3) - (24 - 16√3) = 28 - 16√3 -24 +16√3 = 4So discriminant D=4.Therefore,t = [ - (4 - 2√3) ± 2 ] / (2√3 )Compute both solutions:First solution:t = [ -4 + 2√3 + 2 ] / (2√3 ) = [ -2 + 2√3 ] / (2√3 ) = [ -1 + √3 ] / √3Multiply numerator and denominator by √3:= [ (-1 + √3 ) * √3 ] / 3 = [ -√3 + 3 ] / 3 = (3 - √3)/3 = 1 - √3/3 ≈ 1 - 0.577 ≈ 0.423Second solution:t = [ -4 + 2√3 - 2 ] / (2√3 ) = [ -6 + 2√3 ] / (2√3 ) = [ -3 + √3 ] / √3Multiply numerator and denominator by √3:= [ (-3 + √3 ) * √3 ] / 3 = [ -3√3 + 3 ] / 3 = (3 - 3√3)/3 = 1 - √3 ≈ 1 - 1.732 ≈ -0.732But t must be positive since it&#39;s a length (CE=CF=t), so we discard the negative solution. Therefore, t = (3 - √3)/3 ≈0.423.Therefore, CE=CF=t=(3 - √3)/3. Then, points E and F are located at:E is on BC at (1, t) = (1, (3 - √3)/3 )F is on DC at (1 - t, 0) = (1 - (3 - √3)/3 , 0) = ( (3 - (3 - √3))/3 , 0 ) = ( √3 / 3 , 0 )So coordinates:A(0,1), E(1, (3 - √3)/3 ), F(√3 /3, 0 )Now, angle EAF is 30 degrees, which we used to find t.But the problem asks for the length of BD. In our coordinate system, BD is from B(1,1) to D(0,0), which is a diagonal of the square. The distance between (1,1) and (0,0) is sqrt((1)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(2). So BD = sqrt(2). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(2). But that seems too straightforward. However, the problem gives all the information about E and F, but BD is fixed regardless of E and F. So maybe the answer is indeed sqrt(2). But the problem is from a competition, which usually doesn&#39;t have such straightforward problems unless it&#39;s a trick question.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a different interpretation of BD. If BD is not the diagonal but another segment. Wait, but in the square, BD is unambiguously the diagonal. Unless the square is folded or something, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention that. Alternatively, maybe BD is a different line segment in the figure created by E and F? For example, maybe BD is BE + ED? But BD is a straight line. Alternatively, the length from B to D passing through E and F? But BD is a straight line, and E is on BC, F is on DC, so BD doesn&#39;t pass through E or F unless E or F are at C. But CE=CF=t=(3 - √3)/3 ≈0.423, so E and F are not at C. Therefore, BD is just the diagonal, length sqrt(2). Therefore, the answer must be sqrt(2).But why does the problem give all the information about E and F? Maybe it&#39;s a red herring, or perhaps there was a misprint in the problem, and they intended to ask for something else, like the length of AE or AF or EF. Let&#39;s check what EF would be.Coordinates of E(1, (3 - √3)/3 ) and F(√3 /3, 0 ). So the distance EF is sqrt( (1 - √3 /3 )^2 + ( (3 - √3)/3 - 0 )^2 )Compute:Δx = 1 - √3 /3 ≈1 - 0.577 ≈0.423Δy = (3 - √3)/3 ≈ (3 -1.732)/3 ≈1.268/3≈0.423Therefore, EF≈sqrt(0.423² +0.423² )≈sqrt(0.179 +0.179)=sqrt(0.358)≈0.598But exact value:sqrt( (1 - √3/3)^2 + ((3 - √3)/3)^2 )First term: (1 - √3/3)^2 = 1 - 2√3/3 + ( (√3)^2 )/9 =1 - 2√3/3 + 3/9=1 - 2√3/3 +1/3= (3/3 +1/3) -2√3/3=4/3 -2√3/3Second term: ((3 - √3)/3)^2= (9 -6√3 +3)/9=(12 -6√3)/9= (4 -2√3)/3Therefore, total inside sqrt:(4/3 -2√3/3) + (4/3 -2√3/3)=8/3 -4√3/3Therefore, EF= sqrt(8/3 -4√3/3)=sqrt( (8 -4√3)/3 )=sqrt(4(2 -√3)/3)=2 sqrt( (2 -√3)/3 )But this seems messy. Not sure if it simplifies further. But in any case, the problem asks for BD, which is sqrt(2). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(2). But since the problem came from a competition, perhaps there&#39;s a catch. Wait, maybe I messed up the coordinate system? Let me verify once more.Alternative coordinate system: Let me place A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1,1), D at (0,1). Then BD is from (1,0) to (0,1), which is still a diagonal of length sqrt(2). Points E on BC (from (1,0) to (1,1)) and F on DC (from (1,1) to (0,1)). Wait, in this case, DC is vertical? Wait, no, in this coordinate system, DC would be from (1,1) to (0,1), horizontal. Wait, no. If A is (0,0), B(1,0), C(1,1), D(0,1). Then BC is from (1,0) to (1,1), vertical. CD is from (1,1) to (0,1), horizontal. Then CE and CF: CE is on BC (vertical), so CE would be from C(1,1) down to E(1,1 - t), and CF is on CD (horizontal) from C(1,1) left to F(1 - t,1). Then angle EAF would be at A(0,0). Wait, in this case, angle EAF is at A(0,0) between points E and F. So coordinates would be similar but with different positions.But regardless of the coordinate system, BD remains the diagonal of the square with length sqrt(2). Therefore, unless the problem has a typo, the answer should be sqrt(2). Given that the problem is from a competition, maybe they intended to test the ability to see through extraneous information and recognize that BD is the diagonal regardless of other points. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(2), which in boxed form is boxed{sqrt{2}}.Final Answerboxed{sqrt{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given a square (ABCD) with side length 1, points (E) and (F) are on sides (BC) and (DC) respectively such that (angle EAF = 30^circ) and (CE = CF). We need to determine the length of (BD).1. Identify the coordinates of the square:   - Place the square in a coordinate system with (A(0,1)), (B(1,1)), (C(1,0)), and (D(0,0)).2. Determine the coordinates of points (E) and (F):   - Since (CE = CF = t), point (E) is on (BC) at ((1, t)) and point (F) is on (DC) at ((1 - t, 0)).3. Calculate the vectors (AE) and (AF):   - Vector (AE) from (A(0,1)) to (E(1, t)) is ((1, t - 1)).   - Vector (AF) from (A(0,1)) to (F(1 - t, 0)) is ((1 - t, -1)).4. Use the dot product to find the angle:   - The dot product of (AE) and (AF) is (2 - 2t).   - The magnitudes of (AE) and (AF) are both (sqrt{t^2 - 2t + 2}).   - Using (cos(30^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), solve the equation (frac{2 - 2t}{t^2 - 2t + 2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).5. Solve the quadratic equation:   - Solving the quadratic equation gives (t = frac{3 - sqrt{3}}{3}).6. Determine the length of (BD):   - The diagonal (BD) in a square of side length 1 is always (sqrt{2}).Thus, the length of (BD) is (boxed{sqrt{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a square ABCD with side length 1. Points E and F are on sides BC and DC respectively, such that angle EAF is 30 degrees, and CE equals CF. We need to find the length of BD. Wait, BD is a diagonal of the square, right? In a square with side length 1, the diagonal should be √2. But maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem? Let me check again.Wait, the problem says &quot;determine the length of BD.&quot; But BD in a square is definitely the diagonal. But the problem mentions points E and F with certain conditions. Maybe there&#39;s a typo? Or maybe BD isn&#39;t the diagonal? Wait, in a square ABCD, the vertices are usually labeled in order, so AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. Then BD would be from vertex B to vertex D, which is indeed the diagonal. So in a unit square, BD is √2. But that seems too straightforward. The rest of the problem gives conditions about E, F, angle EAF, and CE=CF. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the length of EF or something else? Wait, no, the problem clearly states BD. Hmm. Maybe the problem is a trick question, where BD is just the diagonal, regardless of the other conditions. But that seems unlikely for a competition problem. Maybe I need to verify.Wait, the original problem is from the 2015 CCA Math Bonanza Lightning Round #4.2. Maybe they intended BD to be something else? Or maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement? Alternatively, perhaps BD refers to another segment in the figure, but in a square labeled ABCD, BD is unambiguously the diagonal. Let me check again.Wait, the problem says: &quot;Let ABCD be a square of side length 1, and let E and F be points on BC and DC such that angle EAF=30 degrees and CE=CF. Determine the length of BD.&quot;So BD is the diagonal of the square, which is √2. So unless there&#39;s some transformation or something else, but no. The square is fixed with side length 1. So BD is √2. Therefore, maybe the problem is misstated? Or perhaps BD is a typo, and they meant EF? Because otherwise, the rest of the problem is irrelevant. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe BD is not the diagonal, but another segment. Wait, in a square ABCD, the points are arranged in order, so A-B-C-D-A. So BD connects B to D, which is indeed the diagonal. If E is on BC and F is on DC, then BD is separate from E and F. So unless the problem is in 3D, but the problem mentions BC and DC, which are sides of the square, so it&#39;s 2D.Alternatively, maybe BD is a typo for BE, BF, EF, or something else. But the problem says BD. Hmm. Let me check the original problem again as presented:&quot;Let ABCD be a square of side length 1, and let E and F be points on BC and DC such that angle EAF=30 degrees and CE=CF. Determine the length of BD.&quot;Unless there is a figure where BD is different, but in a standard square, BD is the diagonal. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a different configuration? Maybe the square is labeled differently? For example, if the square is labeled A-B-C-D in a different order? But no, standard labeling is either clockwise or counter-clockwise. If it&#39;s a square, then BD is the diagonal regardless. So unless there&#39;s some other meaning.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D, but it just says &quot;square,&quot; which is 2D. So BD is the diagonal, length √2. But then why give all the other conditions about E and F? That seems irrelevant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and the actual question is to find the length of EF or AE or AF or something else. Let me consider that possibility.Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, but BD is in another figure, but that doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, the problem is from the 2015 CCA Math Bonanza Lightning Round #4.2. Maybe in the original problem, the figure is different? But the user provided the text as is. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is indeed √2, but the problem includes extra information to throw us off. But that would be unusual for a competition problem. Typically, all information given is necessary.Wait, maybe CE=CF, so points E and F are such that CE=CF. Let&#39;s try to visualize this. Let me sketch the square ABCD with A at the top-left corner, B at top-right, C at bottom-right, D at bottom-left. Then BC is the right side, DC is the bottom side. Points E is on BC, F is on DC. CE=CF, so the distance from C to E on BC is equal to the distance from C to F on DC. Since BC and DC are both length 1, then CE=CF=x, so E is x units below C on BC, and F is x units to the left of C on DC. Wait, BC is vertical from B(1,1) to C(1,0) in a coordinate system where A is (0,1), B(1,1), C(1,0), D(0,0). Then E is on BC, which is the vertical segment from (1,1) to (1,0). So E would be at (1, 1 - x). Similarly, DC is the horizontal segment from D(0,0) to C(1,0). So F is x units to the left of C on DC, so F is at (1 - x, 0). So CE = x, CF = x. So E is (1, 1 - x) and F is (1 - x, 0). Then angle EAF is 30 degrees. So point A is at (0,1). So angle at A between points E and F is 30 degrees. So we need to find x such that angle EAF = 30 degrees, then perhaps from that x, compute BD? But BD is always √2. So unless there&#39;s some other BD.Wait, unless BD is a typo for BE, DF, EF, or something else. Let me check again. The problem says &quot;Determine the length of BD.&quot; BD in the square is the diagonal, length √2. So unless there&#39;s a different BD. Wait, in the problem statement, it&#39;s possible that BD is a segment connecting B to D through some other points, but no. The problem states &quot;BD&quot; without qualification. In standard notation, BD is the diagonal.Wait, maybe the problem is in 3D? But it says &quot;square ABCD,&quot; which is 2D. Unless it&#39;s a cube, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe BD is a different diagonal in another figure? No, the figure is a square.Alternatively, maybe the problem is mistyped and BD is supposed to be EF. Let me check the problem again. The original problem is from 2015 CCA Math Bonanza Lightning Round #4.2. Maybe the original problem had a different segment. But the user provided the problem as stated. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and BD is indeed the diagonal, which is √2, and the rest is a red herring, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps CE=CF is a red herring? Wait, but angle EAF is given. Maybe BD is a typo for BE or BF? Let me see.Wait, let&#39;s try to solve the problem as stated. Let me proceed step by step.Given square ABCD with side length 1. Let me assign coordinates:Let’s place the square in coordinate system with A at (0,1), B at (1,1), C at (1,0), D at (0,0). Then:- AB is from (0,1) to (1,1)- BC is from (1,1) to (1,0)- CD is from (1,0) to (0,0)- DA is from (0,0) to (0,1)Points E and F are on BC and DC respectively such that CE = CF = x (let’s denote the length as x). Therefore:- Point E is on BC, which is vertical from (1,1) to (1,0). CE = x, so since C is at (1,0), moving up x units along BC, E is at (1, 0 + x) = (1, x). Wait, but BC is from (1,1) to (1,0). So CE is the distance from C to E. If CE = x, then E is x units away from C along BC. Since BC is length 1, then E is at (1, 0 + x) if we consider from C upwards. Wait, but BC goes from B(1,1) to C(1,0). So if E is on BC, then starting from B(1,1) to C(1,0), the distance from C to E is x. So E is located x units above C on BC. Therefore, since BC is vertical, the coordinates of E would be (1, 0 + x). Similarly, CF = x, so F is x units left from C on DC. DC goes from D(0,0) to C(1,0), so F is at (1 - x, 0).Therefore, coordinates:- E: (1, x)- F: (1 - x, 0)- A: (0,1)We need angle EAF = 30 degrees. So angle at point A between points E and F is 30 degrees. Let me recall that the angle between two lines can be found using the tangent formula or the dot product. Since we have coordinates, perhaps we can compute vectors AE and AF and use the dot product formula.First, find vectors AE and AF.Vector AE is from A(0,1) to E(1, x): (1 - 0, x - 1) = (1, x - 1)Vector AF is from A(0,1) to F(1 - x, 0): (1 - x - 0, 0 - 1) = (1 - x, -1)The angle between vectors AE and AF is 30 degrees. The formula for the angle θ between two vectors u and v is:cosθ = (u • v) / (|u| |v|)We have θ = 30°, so cosθ = √3/2Compute the dot product u • v:(1)(1 - x) + (x - 1)(-1) = (1 - x) - (x - 1) = 1 - x - x + 1 = 2 - 2xCompute |u| and |v|:|u| = |AE| = sqrt(1² + (x - 1)²) = sqrt(1 + (x - 1)²)|v| = |AF| = sqrt((1 - x)² + (-1)²) = sqrt((1 - x)² + 1)So:(2 - 2x) / [sqrt(1 + (x - 1)²) * sqrt((1 - x)² + 1)] = √3 / 2Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: 2(1 - x)Denominator: sqrt(1 + (x - 1)^2) * sqrt((1 - x)^2 + 1)Notice that (x - 1)^2 = (1 - x)^2, so both terms under the square roots are the same:sqrt(1 + (1 - x)^2) * sqrt(1 + (1 - x)^2) = [sqrt(1 + (1 - x)^2)]^2 = 1 + (1 - x)^2Therefore, denominator simplifies to 1 + (1 - x)^2So we have:[2(1 - x)] / [1 + (1 - x)^2] = √3 / 2Let me denote y = 1 - x to simplify the equation:[2y] / [1 + y^2] = √3 / 2Cross-multiplying:4y = √3 (1 + y^2)Bring all terms to one side:√3 y^2 - 4y + √3 = 0This is a quadratic equation in y:√3 y^2 - 4y + √3 = 0Let me solve for y using the quadratic formula:y = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 4 * √3 * √3)] / (2 * √3)Compute discriminant:16 - 4 * √3 * √3 = 16 - 4 * 3 = 16 - 12 = 4Therefore:y = [4 ± 2]/(2√3) = [4 + 2]/(2√3) or [4 - 2]/(2√3)So:y = 6/(2√3) = 3/√3 = √3ory = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3Therefore, y = √3 or y = 1/√3But y = 1 - x, and since x is the distance from C to E and C to F on sides of length 1, x must be between 0 and 1. Therefore, y = 1 - x must also be between 0 and 1. However, √3 ≈ 1.732, which is greater than 1, so y = √3 is invalid. Therefore, the only valid solution is y = 1/√3, so 1 - x = 1/√3, which implies x = 1 - 1/√3 ≈ 1 - 0.577 ≈ 0.423.Therefore, x = 1 - 1/√3Thus, points E and F are located at:E: (1, x) = (1, 1 - 1/√3)F: (1 - x, 0) = (1 - (1 - 1/√3), 0) = (1/√3, 0)So, we have E at (1, 1 - 1/√3) and F at (1/√3, 0)But the problem asks for the length of BD. Wait, BD is the diagonal of the square from B(1,1) to D(0,0). The distance between (1,1) and (0,0) is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2] = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). So BD = sqrt(2). Therefore, regardless of the positions of E and F, BD remains sqrt(2). So the answer is sqrt(2). But why does the problem give all those conditions? Maybe BD was a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is sqrt(2). But given that this is a competition problem, perhaps there is a trick. Wait, but in that case, the problem would be too straightforward. Let me check again.Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the length of BD in another figure. Wait, no. The problem states that ABCD is a square. So BD is fixed. Therefore, even with points E and F defined as such, BD remains sqrt(2). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(2). But maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me check once more.Wait, the problem says &quot;Let ABCD be a square... Determine the length of BD.&quot; In a square, BD is the diagonal. So unless the figure is not a square, but the problem says it is a square. Therefore, BD must be sqrt(2). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(2). The rest of the conditions about E and F and angle EAF=30 degrees are perhaps part of another problem, but as stated, the answer is sqrt(2). Alternatively, maybe BD is a different segment, but in standard notation, BD is the diagonal. So I think the answer is sqrt(2). Maybe the problem had a typo, but as given, BD is the diagonal.Wait, but the problem is from a competition, so maybe there&#39;s more to it. Let me see if in the process of finding x, we can confirm BD&#39;s length.Wait, in the square, BD is always sqrt(2). So unless the problem is referring to another BD, but I don&#39;t see how. Maybe the problem meant BE or DF? If BD is a typo, maybe the answer is different. Let me check the steps again.We found that x = 1 - 1/√3. Then points E and F are determined. If the problem had asked for EF, then we could compute the distance between E(1, 1 - 1/√3) and F(1/√3, 0). Let&#39;s compute that:EF = sqrt[(1 - 1/√3)^2 + (1 - 1/√3 - 0)^2]?Wait, coordinates of E: (1, 1 - 1/√3)Coordinates of F: (1/√3, 0)So difference in x-coordinates: 1 - 1/√3Difference in y-coordinates: (1 - 1/√3) - 0 = 1 - 1/√3Therefore, EF = sqrt[(1 - 1/√3)^2 + (1 - 1/√3)^2] = sqrt[2*(1 - 2/√3 + 1/3)] = sqrt[2*( (3 - 2√3 + 1)/3 )] = sqrt[2*( (4 - 2√3)/3 )] = sqrt[ (8 - 4√3)/3 ].But this is speculative. The problem asks for BD, which is the diagonal. So unless there&#39;s a different interpretation, BD is sqrt(2). Therefore, maybe the answer is sqrt(2). But given that the problem includes other conditions, which we used to find x, but BD is independent of x. Therefore, maybe the answer is indeed sqrt(2). Therefore, I think the answer is boxed{sqrt{2}}.Final Answerboxed{sqrt{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given a square (ABCD) with side length 1, points (E) and (F) are on sides (BC) and (DC) respectively such that (angle EAF = 30^circ) and (CE = CF).

Vectors Calculation:   - Vector ( overrightarrow{AE} ) from (A(0,1)) to (E(1, x)) is ((1, x - 1)).   - Vector ( overrightarrow{AF} ) from (A(0,1)) to (F(1 - x, 0)) is ((1 - x, -1)).3. Dot Product and Magnitudes:   - Dot product of ( overrightarrow{AE} ) and ( overrightarrow{AF} ): ( (1)(1 - x) + (x - 1)(-1) = 2 - 2x ).   - Magnitudes of vectors ( overrightarrow{AE} ) and ( overrightarrow{AF} ): ( sqrt{1 + (x - 1)^2} ) and ( sqrt{(1 - x)^2 + 1} ).4. Angle Calculation:   - Using the cosine formula for the angle between vectors:      [     frac{2(1 - x)}{sqrt{1 + (1 - x)^2} cdot sqrt{1 + (1 - x)^2}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}     ]   - Simplifying, we find ( x = 1 - frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ).5. Length of (BD):   - (BD) is the diagonal of the square (ABCD). The diagonal of a square with side length 1 is ( sqrt{2} ).Thus, the length of (BD) is (boxed{sqrt{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b904caef></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>🔑:</span>1. Understanding the problem: We are given a square (ABCD) with side length 1. Points (E) and (F) are on sides (BC) and (DC) respectively, such that (angle EAF = 30^circ) and (CE = CF).

The length of the diagonal of a square with side length (s) is given by:   [   text{Diagonal} = ssqrt{2}   ]   Here, (s = 1), so the length of the diagonal (BD) is:   [   BD = 1sqrt{2} = sqrt{2}   ]3. Considering the additional information: The problem mentions points (E) and (F) and the angle (angle EAF = 30^circ). However, this information is not necessary to determine the length of the diagonal (BD) of the square. The length of the diagonal is solely dependent on the side length of the square.4. Conclusion: The length of the diagonal (BD) of the square (ABCD) with side length 1 is (sqrt{2}).The final answer is (boxed{sqrt{2}}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-5cba23f0 data-v-b904caef><div class="review" data-v-b904caef><div class="review-title" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>❓:</span>(6) For all real numbers x, y satisfying |x|+|y| leqslant 1, the inequality left|2 x-3 y+frac{3}{2}right|+|y-1|+|2 y-x-3| leqslant a always holds, then the minimum value of the real number a is qquad.</div><div class="divider" data-v-b904caef></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of &#39;a&#39; such that the inequality |2x - 3y + 3/2| + |y - 1| + |2y - x - 3| ≤ a holds for all real numbers x, y satisfying |x| + |y| ≤ 1. Hmm, let&#39;s try to break this down.First, the condition |x| + |y| ≤ 1 describes a diamond-shaped region (a square rotated 45 degrees) centered at the origin with vertices at (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1). So x and y are constrained within this diamond.The expression we need to maximize (to find the minimal &#39;a&#39;) is |2x - 3y + 3/2| + |y - 1| + |2y - x - 3|. Since we&#39;re dealing with absolute values, the maximum could occur at one of the vertices or along the edges of the diamond. Maybe even in the interior, but often maxima/minima of such expressions occur on the boundary.Let me list the vertices first: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1). Let&#39;s compute the value of the expression at each of these points.Starting with (1,0):Compute each term:- |2(1) - 3(0) + 3/2| = |2 + 0 + 1.5| = |3.5| = 3.5- |0 - 1| = | -1 | = 1- |2(0) - 1 - 3| = |0 -1 -3| = | -4 | = 4Sum: 3.5 + 1 + 4 = 8.5Next, (-1,0):First term: |2(-1) -3(0) + 3/2| = |-2 + 0 + 1.5| = |-0.5| = 0.5Second term: |0 -1| = 1Third term: |2(0) - (-1) -3| = |0 +1 -3| = |-2| = 2Sum: 0.5 + 1 + 2 = 3.5That&#39;s much lower. Now (0,1):First term: |2(0) -3(1) + 3/2| = |0 -3 + 1.5| = |-1.5| = 1.5Second term: |1 -1| = 0Third term: |2(1) -0 -3| = |2 -3| = |-1| = 1Sum: 1.5 + 0 + 1 = 2.5Even lower. Then (0,-1):First term: |2(0) -3(-1) + 3/2| = |0 +3 +1.5| = |4.5| = 4.5Second term: |-1 -1| = |-2| = 2Third term: |2(-1) -0 -3| = |-2 -3| = |-5| = 5Sum: 4.5 + 2 +5 = 11.5So the maximum among the vertices is 11.5 at (0,-1). But wait, maybe there&#39;s a higher value along the edges?The diamond has four edges: between (1,0) and (0,1), (0,1) and (-1,0), (-1,0) and (0,-1), (0,-1) and (1,0). So I need to check each edge.First edge: from (1,0) to (0,1). Parametrize this as x = 1 - t, y = 0 + t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. So substitute x = 1 - t, y = t, 0 ≤ t ≤1.Compute each term:First term: |2(1 - t) - 3t + 3/2| = |2 - 2t -3t + 1.5| = |3.5 -5t|Second term: |t -1| = |1 - t|Third term: |2t - (1 - t) -3| = |2t -1 + t -3| = |3t -4|So the expression becomes |3.5 -5t| + |1 - t| + |3t -4|We need to maximize this over t in [0,1]. Let&#39;s break down each absolute value.First term: |3.5 -5t|- 3.5 -5t is positive when 5t &lt; 3.5 =&gt; t &lt; 0.7. So for t &lt; 0.7, it&#39;s 3.5 -5t; for t ≥ 0.7, it&#39;s 5t -3.5.Second term: |1 - t|. For t ≤1, it&#39;s 1 - t.Third term: |3t -4|. Since 3t -4 is negative for t &lt; 4/3, which is always true since t ≤1. So it&#39;s 4 -3t.So the expression becomes:For t &lt; 0.7: (3.5 -5t) + (1 - t) + (4 -3t) = 3.5 +1 +4 -5t -t -3t = 8.5 -9tFor t ≥ 0.7: (5t -3.5) + (1 - t) + (4 -3t) = 5t -3.5 +1 +4 -t -3t = (5t -t -3t) + (-3.5 +5) = t +1.5So on [0,0.7), the expression is 8.5 -9t, which is decreasing. So maximum at t=0: 8.5.On [0.7,1], the expression is t +1.5, which is increasing. So maximum at t=1: 1 +1.5 =2.5.Hence, on this edge, maximum is 8.5 (at t=0, which is (1,0)), same as the vertex. So no higher value here.Second edge: from (0,1) to (-1,0). Let&#39;s parametrize as x = -t, y =1 - t, t from 0 to1.Compute the expression:First term: |2(-t) -3(1 - t) + 3/2| = |-2t -3 +3t +1.5| = |t -1.5|Second term: |(1 - t) -1| = |-t| = tThird term: |2(1 - t) - (-t) -3| = |2 -2t + t -3| = |-1 -t| = | -1 -t | = t +1So the expression is |t -1.5| + t + t +1 = |t -1.5| +2t +1Let&#39;s analyze |t -1.5|. Since t is in [0,1], t -1.5 is always negative, so |t -1.5| =1.5 - t.Thus, the expression becomes (1.5 - t) +2t +1 =1.5 -t +2t +1 =2.5 +tThis is increasing in t, so maximum at t=1: 2.5 +1=3.5, which occurs at (-1,0). So again, the same as the vertex value.Third edge: from (-1,0) to (0,-1). Parametrize as x = -1 + t, y =0 - t, t from 0 to1.Compute each term:First term: |2(-1 + t) -3(-t) + 3/2| = |-2 +2t +3t +1.5| = |( -2 +1.5 ) +5t| = |-0.5 +5t|Second term: |(-t) -1| = |-t -1| = t +1Third term: |2(-t) - (-1 + t) -3| = |-2t +1 -t -3| = |-3t -2| = 3t +2So the expression is |-0.5 +5t| + t +1 +3t +2 = |5t -0.5| +4t +3Break down |5t -0.5|:5t -0.5 ≥0 when t ≥0.1. So for t &lt;0.1, it&#39;s 0.5 -5t; for t ≥0.1, it&#39;s 5t -0.5.Thus, the expression becomes:For t &lt;0.1: (0.5 -5t) +4t +3 =0.5 -5t +4t +3 =3.5 -tFor t ≥0.1: (5t -0.5) +4t +3 =9t +2.5So on [0,0.1), the expression is 3.5 -t, decreasing, so maximum at t=0:3.5On [0.1,1], it&#39;s 9t +2.5, increasing. So maximum at t=1:9 +2.5=11.5Hence, maximum on this edge is 11.5 at t=1, which is (0,-1). Same as vertex.Fourth edge: from (0,-1) to (1,0). Parametrize as x = t, y = -1 + t, t from 0 to1.Compute each term:First term: |2t -3(-1 + t) +3/2| = |2t +3 -3t +1.5| = |-t +4.5| = |4.5 -t|Second term: |(-1 + t) -1| = |t -2| =2 - t (since t ≤1)Third term: |2(-1 + t) -t -3| = |-2 +2t -t -3| = |-5 +t| =5 -tThus, the expression is |4.5 -t| + (2 -t) + (5 -t) = |4.5 -t| +7 -2tSince t is between 0 and1, 4.5 -t is always positive, so |4.5 -t|=4.5 -tTherefore, expression becomes 4.5 -t +7 -2t=11.5 -3t, which is decreasing in t. So maximum at t=0:11.5, which is (0,-1). Again, same as vertex.So along all edges, the maximum is 11.5 at (0,-1). But maybe there&#39;s a higher value inside the diamond?To check if there&#39;s a maximum in the interior, maybe we need to set up Lagrange multipliers. But since the expression is a sum of absolute values, which are piecewise linear, the maximum should occur at a corner or along an edge where the expression&#39;s gradient changes, but in this case, since the diamond is a convex polygon and the function is convex (sum of absolute values), the maximum will occur at an extreme point, i.e., a vertex. Wait, is the function convex? A sum of convex functions is convex, yes. Therefore, the maximum over a convex set occurs at an extreme point. Therefore, since the diamond is a convex set and the function is convex, the maximum is achieved at one of the vertices. Therefore, the maximum is 11.5, so the minimal &#39;a&#39; is 11.5, which is 23/2. Wait, 11.5 is 23/2? Wait, 11.5 is 23/2? Wait, 11.5 is 23/2? Let me check: 23 divided by 2 is 11.5, yes. So the minimal a is 23/2. But wait, let me check if that&#39;s correct. Wait, the answer at (0,-1) was 4.5 + 2 +5=11.5. So 11.5 is 23/2. Hmm.But wait, before confirming, let me check if my reasoning is correct. The function is convex, so maximum over a convex set is at an extreme point. But wait, wait. Wait, the maximum of a convex function over a convex set is attained at an extreme point? Wait, actually, no. Wait, convex functions attain their maxima at extreme points, but concave functions can have maxima inside. Wait, actually, for convex functions on convex sets, the maximum is attained at the boundary. But whether it&#39;s at an extreme point depends. If the function is convex, then yes, the maximum is attained at an extreme point. Wait, let me recall the theorem.According to convex optimization theory, the maximum of a convex function over a compact convex set is attained at an extreme point. Similarly, the minimum of a convex function is attained at an extreme point if the function is concave? Wait, no. Wait, actually, for a convex function, the maximum is attained at an extreme point of the set, but the minimum might be in the interior. Similarly, for a concave function, the minimum is attained at an extreme point, and maximum might be in the interior.Wait, so in our case, the function we are dealing with is a sum of absolute values, which is convex. So the maximum of a convex function over a convex compact set (the diamond) is attained at an extreme point, which are the vertices. Therefore, our initial conclusion that the maximum is at (0,-1) giving 11.5 is correct. Therefore, the minimal &#39;a&#39; is 23/2.But wait, let me test another point in the interior. For example, take (0,0). Let&#39;s compute the expression there:|2*0 -3*0 +3/2| + |0 -1| + |2*0 -0 -3| = |1.5| +1 + | -3 | =1.5 +1 +3=5.5, which is much less than 11.5.How about (0.5, 0.5). But wait, |x| + |y| =0.5 +0.5=1, which is on the edge. Wait, but we already checked edges.Alternatively, take (0.5, -0.5). Then |x| + |y| =0.5 +0.5=1, so it&#39;s on the edge from (1,0) to (0,-1). Let&#39;s compute the expression:First term: |2*0.5 -3*(-0.5) +3/2| = |1 +1.5 +1.5| = |4| =4Second term: |-0.5 -1| = |-1.5| =1.5Third term: |2*(-0.5) -0.5 -3| = |-1 -0.5 -3| = |-4.5| =4.5Total sum:4 +1.5 +4.5=10, which is less than 11.5.Another point, say (0.25, -0.75). Then |x| + |y| =0.25 +0.75=1, so it&#39;s on the edge from (0,-1) to (1,0). Let&#39;s compute:First term: |2*0.25 -3*(-0.75) +3/2| = |0.5 +2.25 +1.5| = |4.25| =4.25Second term: |-0.75 -1| =1.75Third term: |2*(-0.75) -0.25 -3| = |-1.5 -0.25 -3| = |-4.75| =4.75Total sum:4.25 +1.75 +4.75=10.75, still less than 11.5.How about (0, -1): already checked, gives 11.5.Wait, let&#39;s try (0.1, -0.9). Then |x| + |y|=0.1 +0.9=1. Compute the expression:First term: |2*0.1 -3*(-0.9) +1.5| = |0.2 +2.7 +1.5| = |4.4| =4.4Second term: |-0.9 -1| =1.9Third term: |2*(-0.9) -0.1 -3| = |-1.8 -0.1 -3| = |-4.9| =4.9Sum:4.4 +1.9 +4.9=11.2, which is still less than 11.5.Hmm, getting closer but not exceeding 11.5. So it seems 11.5 is indeed the maximum. So the minimal a is 11.5, which is 23/2. Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{23}{2}}.But wait, let me just check once more if there is a point where the combination of the terms might lead to a higher value. Suppose we have some x and y inside the diamond such that each absolute term is maximized. But due to the constraints of |x| + |y| ≤1, variables can&#39;t be too large.Alternatively, maybe consider the individual terms. Let&#39;s see:The first term is |2x -3y +1.5|. To maximize this, we want 2x -3y to be as large as possible in absolute value. Similarly, the second term |y -1|. Since y is constrained by |y| ≤1 - |x|, the maximum |y -1| occurs when y is as small as possible. Since y ≥ - (1 - |x|), the minimal y is -1 + |x|. So |y -1| is maximized when y is minimal. For example, at y=-1, |y -1| =2, which is part of the third term&#39;s contribution.Similarly, the third term is |2y -x -3|. To maximize this, we need 2y -x -3 to be as large as possible in absolute value. Since x and y are constrained, let&#39;s see:If we take y as negative as possible (y approaching -1) and x as positive as possible (x approaching 1), then 2y -x -3 ≈ -2 -1 -3 = -6, absolute value 6. But wait, when y=-1 and x=0, we have |2*(-1) -0 -3|=|-5|=5, which was in our vertex calculation. But if x=1 and y=0, |0 -1 -3|=4. If x is negative, say x=-1 and y=0, |0 - (-1) -3|=|1 -3|=2. So the maximum here is 5 at (0,-1).Wait, but if we take x=1, y=-0: 2y -x -3 =0 -1 -3= -4, absolute 4.But how is 5 achieved? At (0,-1). So indeed, the third term is maximized at 5 there.Similarly, the second term |y -1| is maximized when y is minimal, i.e., at y=-1, which gives 2.The first term |2x -3y +1.5|: at (0,-1), this is |0 +3 +1.5|=4.5. If we can get this term larger, maybe. For example, if x is positive and y is negative. Let&#39;s see:Suppose x=1, y=-0: |2(1) -0 +1.5|=3.5If x=0.5, y=-0.5: |1 -(-1.5) +1.5|=|1 +1.5 +1.5|=4, as before.Wait, perhaps if x is negative and y is positive? Wait, but then y is limited by |x| + |y| ≤1. If x is negative, say x=-a, y=b, then a + b ≤1. Then 2x -3y +1.5= -2a -3b +1.5. To maximize the absolute value, we can make this expression as negative or positive as possible.If we make it positive: -2a -3b +1.5 &gt;0. Since a and b are positive (x=-a, y=b), so we need -2a -3b &gt; -1.5, which would require 2a +3b &lt;1.5. But since a + b ≤1, then 2a +3b ≤2a +2b +b=2(a +b) +b ≤2*1 +b. But since b ≤1 -a, then 2*1 + (1 -a) =3 -a. So 2a +3b ≤3 -a, which is maximized when a=0, giving 3*1=3. So 2a +3b can be up to 3, but that would make -2a -3b +1.5=1.5 -3= -1.5. Wait, maybe this approach is getting complicated.Alternatively, since we already checked all vertices and edges and the maximum was at (0,-1), and the function is convex, which attains its maximum at vertices, it&#39;s safe to conclude that the minimal &#39;a&#39; is 23/2.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( a ) is boxed{dfrac{23}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find the minimum value of ( a ) such that the inequality ( left|2x - 3y + frac{3}{2}right| + |y - 1| + |2y - x - 3| leqslant a ) holds for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ) satisfying ( |x| + |y| leqslant 1 ).First, we consider the vertices of the diamond-shaped region defined by ( |x| + |y| leqslant 1 ). These vertices are ((1, 0)), ((-1, 0)), ((0, 1)), and ((0, -1)). We evaluate the given expression at each vertex:1. At ((1, 0)):   [   left|2(1) - 3(0) + frac{3}{2}right| + |0 - 1| + |2(0) - 1 - 3| = left|3.5right| + 1 + 4 = 8.5   ]2. At ((-1, 0)):   [   left|2(-1) - 3(0) + frac{3}{2}right| + |0 - 1| + |2(0) - (-1) - 3| = left|0.5right| + 1 + 2 = 3.5   ]3. At ((0, 1)):   [   left|2(0) - 3(1) + frac{3}{2}right| + |1 - 1| + |2(1) - 0 - 3| = left|1.5right| + 0 + 1 = 2.5   ]4. At ((0, -1)):   [   left|2(0) - 3(-1) + frac{3}{2}right| + |-1 - 1| + |2(-1) - 0 - 3| = left|4.5right| + 2 + 5 = 11.5   ]The maximum value at the vertices is ( 11.5 ).Next, we check the edges of the diamond. For each edge, we parametrize the coordinates and evaluate the expression. After detailed calculations, we find that the maximum value on each edge is also ( 11.5 ), occurring at the vertex ((0, -1)).Since the function is convex and the maximum of a convex function over a convex set is attained at an extreme point, we conclude that the maximum value of the expression within the region ( |x| + |y| leqslant 1 ) is indeed ( 11.5 ).Thus, the minimum value of ( a ) is (boxed{dfrac{23}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this problem here: For all real numbers x, y satisfying |x| + |y| ≤ 1, the inequality |2x - 3y + 3/2| + |y - 1| + |2y - x - 3| ≤ a always holds. I need to find the minimum value of a. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand what&#39;s given. The set of all real numbers x and y such that |x| + |y| ≤ 1. That&#39;s a diamond-shaped region in the coordinate plane, right? With vertices at (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1). So, the problem is saying that within this diamond, the expression |2x - 3y + 3/2| + |y - 1| + |2y - x - 3| must be less than or equal to a, and I need the smallest possible a where this is true for all (x,y) in the diamond.Since the expression is a sum of absolute values, which are all convex functions, the maximum value of this expression over a convex set (like the diamond) should occur at one of the vertices. Wait, is that always true? Let me recall. The maximum of a convex function over a convex set is attained at an extreme point. But here we have a sum of absolute values, which is convex, so yes, the maximum should be at one of the vertices of the diamond. But maybe not? Let me check. Suppose the function is linear in each region defined by the diamond&#39;s edges. Hmm, actually, the diamond itself is the intersection of four half-planes: x + y ≤ 1, -x + y ≤ 1, -x - y ≤ 1, and x - y ≤ 1. Each of these defines a side of the diamond.But the expression we have is |2x - 3y + 3/2| + |y - 1| + |2y - x - 3|. To analyze this, maybe I can split the problem into different cases based on the signs of the expressions inside the absolute values. But that might be complicated because there are three absolute values. Each one can split into two cases, so 2^3 = 8 cases. That seems like a lot, but maybe manageable. Alternatively, since the region is a convex polygon (the diamond), maybe the maximum occurs at one of the vertices. Let me check both approaches.First, let&#39;s check the vertices of the diamond. The diamond has four vertices: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1). Let me compute the value of the expression at each of these points.Starting with (1,0):Compute each term:1. |2*1 - 3*0 + 3/2| = |2 + 0 + 1.5| = |3.5| = 3.52. |0 - 1| = | -1 | = 13. |2*0 - 1 - 3| = |0 -1 -3| = | -4 | = 4Sum: 3.5 + 1 + 4 = 8.5So at (1,0), the expression is 8.5.Next, (-1,0):1. |2*(-1) -3*0 + 3/2| = |-2 + 0 + 1.5| = |-0.5| = 0.52. |0 -1| = 13. |2*0 - (-1) -3| = |0 +1 -3| = |-2| = 2Sum: 0.5 + 1 + 2 = 3.5Hmm, that&#39;s much smaller. So (-1,0) gives 3.5.Third vertex: (0,1):1. |2*0 -3*1 + 3/2| = |0 -3 +1.5| = |-1.5| = 1.52. |1 -1| = |0| = 03. |2*1 -0 -3| = |2 -0 -3| = |-1| =1Sum: 1.5 + 0 +1 = 2.5Even smaller. So (0,1) gives 2.5.Fourth vertex: (0,-1):1. |2*0 -3*(-1) + 3/2| = |0 +3 +1.5| = |4.5| =4.52. |-1 -1| = |-2| =23. |2*(-1) -0 -3| = |-2 -0 -3| = |-5| =5Sum: 4.5 +2 +5 =11.5Wow, that&#39;s the highest so far. So (0,-1) gives 11.5.Wait, so according to the vertices, the maximum is 11.5. But hold on, maybe the maximum occurs on an edge or a face, not just at the vertices? Because even though the function is convex, the maximum might still be on an edge. Hmm. Wait, but convex functions attain their maxima at extreme points. Wait, no. Wait, the sum of convex functions is convex, so the function we&#39;re dealing with is convex. For convex functions on convex compact sets, the maximum is attained at an extreme point. Since the diamond is a convex compact set, the maximum should be at one of the vertices. Therefore, according to that, 11.5 is the maximum. But wait, let me verify this with some points on the edges.Take for example the edge between (1,0) and (0,1). Parametrize this edge as x = 1 - t, y = t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. Then let&#39;s plug into the expression:Compute each term:1. |2(1 - t) -3t + 3/2| = |2 -2t -3t + 1.5| = |3.5 -5t|2. |t -1| = |1 - t|3. |2t - (1 - t) -3| = |2t -1 + t -3| = |3t -4|So the sum is |3.5 -5t| + |1 - t| + |3t -4|. Let&#39;s see if this sum exceeds 11.5 somewhere between t=0 and t=1.At t=0: |3.5| + |1| + |-4| = 3.5 +1 +4 =8.5At t=1: |3.5 -5| + |0| + |3 -4| = |-1.5| +0 +1=1.5 +0 +1=2.5So between 8.5 and 2.5. Let&#39;s check t=0.5:|3.5 -2.5| + |0.5| + |1.5 -4| = |1| +0.5 + | -2.5 | =1 +0.5 +2.5=4.0Still less than 11.5. So on this edge, the maximum is at t=0, which is 8.5, which is less than 11.5.Check another edge: between (0,1) and (-1,0). Parametrize x = -t, y=1 - t, t from 0 to1.Compute terms:1. |2*(-t) -3*(1 - t) +3/2| = |-2t -3 +3t +1.5| = |t -1.5|2. |(1 - t) -1| = |-t| =t3. |2*(1 - t) - (-t) -3| = |2 -2t +t -3| = |-1 -t| = |t +1|Sum: |t -1.5| + t + |t +1|At t=0: | -1.5 | +0 +1=1.5+0+1=2.5At t=1: |1 -1.5| +1 +2=0.5 +1 +2=3.5At t=0.5: |0.5 -1.5| +0.5 +1.5=1 +0.5 +1.5=3.0So the maximum here is 3.5 at t=1, which is (-1,0), which we already considered. Still lower than 11.5.Another edge: (-1,0) to (0,-1). Parametrize x = -1 + t, y=0 -t, t from 0 to1.Compute each term:1. |2*(-1 + t) -3*(-t) +3/2| = |-2 +2t +3t +1.5| = |-0.5 +5t|2. |-t -1| = | -t -1 | = t +13. |2*(-t) - (-1 + t) -3| = |-2t +1 -t -3| = |-3t -2| = |3t +2|Sum: |-0.5 +5t| + (t +1) + |3t +2|At t=0: |-0.5| +1 + |2| =0.5 +1 +2=3.5At t=1: |4.5| +2 +5=4.5 +2 +5=11.5So here, at t=1, which is (0,-1), the sum is 11.5, which matches the vertex value. What about in between?Take t=0.5: |-0.5 +2.5| +1.5 + |3.5 +2| = |2| +1.5 +5.5=2 +1.5 +5.5=9.0Still less than 11.5.Another edge: (0,-1) to (1,0). Parametrize x = t, y= -1 + t, t from 0 to1.Compute each term:1. |2t -3*(-1 + t) +3/2| = |2t +3 -3t +1.5| = |-t +4.5|2. |(-1 + t) -1| = |t -2|3. |2*(-1 + t) - t -3| = |-2 +2t -t -3| = |-5 +t|Sum: |-t +4.5| + |t -2| + |-5 +t|Simplify each term:1. |-t +4.5| = |4.5 - t|2. |t -2|3. |t -5|So sum is |4.5 - t| + |t -2| + |t -5|At t=0: 4.5 +2 +5=11.5At t=1: 3.5 +1 +4=8.5At t=0.5: 4.0 +1.5 +4.5=10.0So maximum here is at t=0 (which is (0,-1)) with 11.5. So on all edges, the maximum at the vertices.Therefore, according to this, the maximum value is 11.5, which occurs at (0,-1). Therefore, the minimal a is 11.5, which is 23/2. So the answer should be boxed{dfrac{23}{2}}?Wait, 11.5 is 23/2? Wait, 11.5 is 23/2? Wait, 23 divided by 2 is 11.5. Yes. But wait, let me double-check the calculation at (0,-1):First term: |2*0 -3*(-1) +3/2| = |0 +3 +1.5| = |4.5| =4.5Second term: |-1 -1| = |-2| =2Third term: |2*(-1) -0 -3| = |-2 -3| = |-5| =5Sum: 4.5 +2 +5=11.5=23/2. Yes, correct.But just to be thorough, let me check if there&#39;s a point inside the diamond where the expression could be larger. Since the function is convex, the maximum should be on the boundary, but let me take an interior point and see. For example, the origin (0,0):Compute each term:1. |0 -0 +1.5| =1.52. |0 -1| =13. |0 -0 -3| =3Sum:1.5 +1 +3=5.5, which is way less than 11.5.Another point: Let&#39;s say (0.5,0.5). Is this inside the diamond? |0.5| + |0.5|=1 ≤1, so yes.Compute each term:1. |2*0.5 -3*0.5 +1.5| = |1 -1.5 +1.5| = |1| =12. |0.5 -1| =0.53. |2*0.5 -0.5 -3| = |1 -0.5 -3| = |-2.5| =2.5Sum:1 +0.5 +2.5=4.0. Still way less.How about a point on the edge between (0,-1) and (1,0). Let&#39;s take t=0.25, so x=0.25, y=-1 +0.25=-0.75. Check if |x| + |y|=0.25 +0.75=1.0, okay.Compute each term:1. |2*0.25 -3*(-0.75) +1.5| = |0.5 +2.25 +1.5| = |4.25| =4.252. |-0.75 -1| = |-1.75| =1.753. |2*(-0.75) -0.25 -3| = |-1.5 -0.25 -3| = |-4.75| =4.75Sum:4.25 +1.75 +4.75=10.75, which is still less than 11.5.So seems like 11.5 is indeed the maximum.Wait, but just to make sure, let me check another point near (0,-1). Let&#39;s take (0.1, -0.9). Check |0.1| + | -0.9 | =0.1 +0.9=1.0, okay.Compute each term:1. |2*0.1 -3*(-0.9) +1.5| = |0.2 +2.7 +1.5| = |4.4| =4.42. |-0.9 -1| = |-1.9| =1.93. |2*(-0.9) -0.1 -3| = |-1.8 -0.1 -3| = |-4.9| =4.9Sum:4.4 +1.9 +4.9=11.2, which is still less than 11.5.Another point: (0, -1 + ε) where ε is small. Wait, but (0, -1) is the vertex. If I take a point approaching (0, -1) from inside, like (0, -0.99). Then:1. |0 -3*(-0.99) +1.5| = |2.97 +1.5| =4.472. |-0.99 -1| =1.993. |2*(-0.99) -0 -3| = |-1.98 -3| =4.98Sum:4.47 +1.99 +4.98≈11.44, which approaches 11.5 as ε approaches 0. So it seems the maximum is indeed achieved exactly at (0,-1).Therefore, the minimal value of a is 23/2, which is 11.5.But just to be 100% thorough, is there any other point in the diamond where the sum could be higher?Suppose we take a point on the edge between (0,-1) and (-1,0). Let&#39;s say t=0.5, so x=-0.5, y=-0.5.Wait, but |x| + |y|=0.5 +0.5=1, so that&#39;s on the edge.Compute each term:1. |2*(-0.5) -3*(-0.5) +1.5| = |-1 +1.5 +1.5| = |2| =22. |-0.5 -1| =1.53. |2*(-0.5) -(-0.5) -3| = |-1 +0.5 -3| = |-3.5| =3.5Sum:2 +1.5 +3.5=7.0. Still less than 11.5.Another edge point between (-1,0) and (0,1). Wait, already checked those.Alternatively, check a point where maybe one of the absolute value expressions inside is zero. For example, set 2x -3y +3/2=0. Let&#39;s see if this line intersects the diamond |x| + |y| ≤1.Solve 2x -3y = -3/2. Let&#39;s see:If we can find x and y such that 2x -3y = -1.5 and |x| + |y| ≤1.Express x in terms of y: x = (3y -1.5)/2Then |(3y -1.5)/2| + |y| ≤1Let me consider different cases based on the sign of y.Case 1: y ≥0Then |y|=y, and x=(3y -1.5)/2. Let&#39;s substitute into |x| + y ≤1.So |(3y -1.5)/2| + y ≤1If 3y -1.5 ≥0, then 3y ≥1.5 =&gt; y ≥0.5. But y ≤1 since |x| + |y| ≤1 and y is non-negative.So for y ≥0.5:(3y -1.5)/2 + y ≤1Multiply by 2: 3y -1.5 + 2y ≤2 =&gt;5y ≤3.5 =&gt; y ≤0.7But y ≥0.5 and y ≤0.7. So possible y between 0.5 and 0.7.Then x=(3y -1.5)/2. Let&#39;s pick y=0.6:x=(1.8 -1.5)/2=0.3/2=0.15Check |0.15| +0.6=0.75 ≤1. Good.So the point (0.15, 0.6) lies on 2x -3y +1.5=0 and inside the diamond.Compute the sum:1. |2*0.15 -3*0.6 +1.5| = |0.3 -1.8 +1.5| = |0| =02. |0.6 -1| =0.43. |2*0.6 -0.15 -3| = |1.2 -0.15 -3| = |-1.95| =1.95Sum:0 +0.4 +1.95=2.35, which is still less than 11.5.Alternatively, set y -1=0, but y=1 is only at (0,1), which we already checked. Similarly, set 2y -x -3=0. Let&#39;s see if this line intersects the diamond.Solve 2y -x -3=0 =&gt;x=2y -3But |x| + |y| ≤1 =&gt; |2y -3| + |y| ≤1But 2y -3 is negative for y &lt;1.5. Since |y| ≤1, y is between -1 and1, so 2y -3 ranges from -5 to -1. So |2y -3| =3 -2y.Thus, 3 -2y + |y| ≤1For y ≥0:3 -2y + y ≤1 =&gt;3 -y ≤1 =&gt; y ≥2, which is impossible since y ≤1.For y &lt;0:3 -2y -y ≤1 =&gt;3 -3y ≤1 =&gt; -3y ≤-2 =&gt;3y ≥2 =&gt; y ≥2/3, but y &lt;0. Contradiction. So no solution. Therefore, the line 2y -x -3=0 does not intersect the diamond.Similarly, setting other expressions inside the absolute values to zero: For example, |y -1|. The line y=1 is outside the diamond except at (0,1). So the only intersection is at (0,1).So the critical points where any of the absolute values switch their expressions are either at the vertices or outside the diamond, except for the line 2x -3y +3/2=0, which intersects the diamond at some interior points, but even there, the sum is lower than 11.5.Therefore, after checking all vertices, edges, and possible critical points inside, the maximum value of the expression is indeed 11.5 at (0,-1). Therefore, the minimal a is 23/2.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{23}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem of finding the minimum value of ( a ) such that the inequality (left|2x - 3y + frac{3}{2}right| + |y - 1| + |2y - x - 3| leq a) holds for all real numbers ( x, y ) satisfying ( |x| + |y| leq 1 ), we analyze the expression by evaluating it at the vertices of the diamond-shaped region defined by ( |x| + |y| leq 1 ).The vertices of the diamond are ((1, 0)), ((-1, 0)), ((0, 1)), and ((0, -1)). We calculate the expression at each vertex:1. At ((1, 0)):   [   left|2(1) - 3(0) + frac{3}{2}right| + |0 - 1| + |2(0) - 1 - 3| = |3.5| + 1 + 4 = 3.5 + 1 + 4 = 8.5   ]2. At ((-1, 0)):   [   left|2(-1) - 3(0) + frac{3}{2}right| + |0 - 1| + |2(0) - (-1) - 3| = |-0.5| + 1 + 2 = 0.5 + 1 + 2 = 3.5   ]3. At ((0, 1)):   [   left|2(0) - 3(1) + frac{3}{2}right| + |1 - 1| + |2(1) - 0 - 3| = |-1.5| + 0 + 1 = 1.5 + 0 + 1 = 2.5   ]4. At ((0, -1)):   [   left|2(0) - 3(-1) + frac{3}{2}right| + |-1 - 1| + |2(-1) - 0 - 3| = |4.5| + 2 + 5 = 4.5 + 2 + 5 = 11.5   ]The maximum value of the expression is found at the vertex ((0, -1)), yielding a value of (11.5). Checking the edges and other potential points within the diamond confirms that the maximum value does not exceed (11.5).Thus, the minimum value of ( a ) is (boxed{dfrac{23}{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-b904caef></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>🔑:</span>(6) frac{23}{2}</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-5cba23f0 data-v-b904caef><div class="review" data-v-b904caef><div class="review-title" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>❓:</span>Given vectors a=(m,4), b=(5,-2), and aparallel b, then m= ______.</div><div class="divider" data-v-b904caef></div><p class="review-content" data-v-b904caef><span class="icon" data-v-b904caef>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have this problem here where I need to find the value of m such that vectors a and b are parallel. The vectors are given as a = (m, 4) and b = (5, -2). Hmm, parallel vectors... Alright, I remember from my math class that if two vectors are parallel, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. So, that means there&#39;s some scalar k where each component of vector a is k times the corresponding component of vector b. Let me write that down.So, if a is parallel to b, then a = k * b for some scalar k. Translating that into the components, that would mean:m = k * 5  4 = k * (-2)Okay, so we have two equations here. The first one is from the x-components and the second one from the y-components. Since both equations involve the same scalar k, I can solve one of them for k and then substitute into the other to find m.Let&#39;s take the second equation first because it has numbers I can work with. So, 4 = k * (-2). To solve for k, I can divide both sides by -2. Let me do that:k = 4 / (-2)  k = -2Alright, so k is -2. Now, plug this value of k back into the first equation to find m.m = k * 5  m = (-2) * 5  m = -10Wait, so m is -10? Let me check if that makes sense. Let&#39;s verify by plugging m back into vector a and see if it&#39;s indeed a scalar multiple of b.If m = -10, then vector a is (-10, 4). Vector b is (5, -2). Let&#39;s see if each component of a is -2 times the corresponding component of b.For the x-component: 5 * (-2) = -10, which matches the x-component of a. For the y-component: -2 * (-2) = 4, which also matches the y-component of a. Perfect, that works out.Hmm, so seems like m = -10 is the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn&#39;t mix up the equations or make any arithmetic mistakes. The key idea is that parallel vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. So, by setting up the ratios between the corresponding components, we can find the scalar and thus solve for the unknown variable.Another way to think about it is using the concept of direction. For two vectors to be parallel, their direction ratios must be proportional. So, the ratio of the x-components should be equal to the ratio of the y-components. Let me express that:m / 5 = 4 / (-2)Solving this equation would give the same result. Let me compute the right side first:4 / (-2) = -2So, m / 5 = -2  Multiply both sides by 5:  m = -2 * 5  m = -10Same answer. That&#39;s reassuring. So, both methods lead to m = -10. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.Just to recap, the steps were:1. Recognize that parallel vectors are scalar multiples of each other.2. Set up equations based on the components.3. Solve for the scalar k using the known component (y-component in this case).4. Substitute k into the other equation to find m.5. Verify the result by plugging back into the original vectors.Alternatively, using the proportionality of components directly gives the same result. Either way, m is indeed -10. I don&#39;t see any errors in the reasoning, so I think that&#39;s the right answer.Final AnswerThe value of ( m ) is boxed{-10}.&lt;/think&gt;Given vectors ( a = (m, 4) ) and ( b = (5, -2) ), and the condition that ( a parallel b ), we need to find the value of ( m ).If two vectors are parallel, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. Therefore, there exists a scalar ( k ) such that ( a = k cdot b ). This gives us the following system of equations:[m = k cdot 5][4 = k cdot (-2)]Solving the second equation for ( k ):[4 = -2k implies k = frac{4}{-2} = -2]Substituting ( k = -2 ) into the first equation:[m = -2 cdot 5 = -10]To verify, we check if ( a = (-10, 4) ) is indeed a scalar multiple of ( b = (5, -2) ):- The x-component: ( 5 cdot (-2) = -10 )- The y-component: ( -2 cdot (-2) = 4 )Both components confirm that ( a ) is a scalar multiple of ( b ). Therefore, the value of ( m ) is (boxed{-10}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have this problem where there are two vectors, a and b. Vector a is (m, 4) and vector b is (5, -2). The question says that a is parallel to b, and I need to find the value of m. Hmm, parallel vectors. What does that mean exactly?I remember that if two vectors are parallel, they must be scalar multiples of each other. That is, one vector can be obtained by multiplying the other vector by a scalar. So, if a is parallel to b, then there exists some scalar k such that a = k*b. Or equivalently, b = k*a. Let me write that down.So, if a = (m, 4) is parallel to b = (5, -2), then there exists a scalar k where:m = 5k  4 = -2kWait, because each component of a must be k times the corresponding component of b. So, the x-component of a (which is m) is equal to k times the x-component of b (which is 5k). Similarly, the y-component of a (which is 4) is equal to k times the y-component of b (which is -2k). So, setting up these two equations:1. m = 5k  2. 4 = -2kNow, I can solve for k first using the second equation and then substitute back to find m. Let&#39;s do that.From equation 2: 4 = -2k  Divide both sides by -2:  k = 4 / (-2)  k = -2So, k is -2. Now plug this value of k into equation 1 to find m.m = 5k  m = 5*(-2)  m = -10Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. If k is -2, then the vector a should be -2 times vector b. Let&#39;s verify.Vector b is (5, -2). Multiplying by -2 gives:  -2*(5, -2) = (-10, 4)Which is exactly vector a, since a is (m, 4). So, m is indeed -10. That seems to check out.Alternatively, another way to think about parallel vectors is that their direction ratios are proportional. So, the ratios of the corresponding components should be equal. So, m/5 should equal 4/(-2). Let&#39;s see:m/5 = 4/(-2)  m/5 = -2  Multiply both sides by 5:  m = -2*5  m = -10Same result. So that&#39;s another way to look at it. The ratios of the corresponding components must be equal because they are scalar multiples. So, either approach gives m = -10. That&#39;s reassuring.Alternatively, thinking in terms of slopes. If vectors are parallel, their slopes must be equal. But since these are vectors in component form, maybe slopes aren&#39;t the most straightforward way, but let me try.The slope of vector a would be 4/m (since rise over run is y/x). The slope of vector b would be (-2)/5. If they are parallel, their slopes must be equal:4/m = (-2)/5  Cross-multiplying:  4*5 = (-2)*m  20 = -2m  Divide both sides by -2:  m = 20/(-2)  m = -10Again, the same answer. So, all three methods: scalar multiple, proportional components, and equal slopes, give m = -10. So, definitely confident that the answer is -10.But just to be thorough, let me recap. The key idea here is that parallel vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. So, each component of one vector is the same scalar multiple of the corresponding component of the other vector. So, setting up the equations based on that gives two equations here, but since we only have one unknown (m), we can solve for k first from the second equation and then find m. Alternatively, setting the ratios equal gives the same equation, leading to the same result.So, no matter which method I use, the answer is m = -10. Therefore, I think that&#39;s the correct answer.Final AnswerThe value of ( m ) is boxed{-10}.&lt;/think&gt;Given vectors ( a = (m, 4) ) and ( b = (5, -2) ), and knowing that ( a parallel b ), we need to find the value of ( m ).Since parallel vectors are scalar multiples of each other, there exists a scalar ( k ) such that ( a = k cdot b ). This gives us the equations:1. ( m = 5k )2.

So, the question is: For n consecutive natural numbers starting from 1, if one of the numbers is removed, the average of the remaining numbers is 152/7. We need to find the removed number. Hmm, okay.First, let me make sure I understand the problem. We have numbers from 1 up to some number n, right? So like 1, 2, 3, ..., n. Then, one number is removed from this sequence, and the average of the remaining numbers is 152/7. We need to figure out which number was removed. Got it.Let me start by recalling some formulas. The average of numbers is the sum divided by the number of numbers. So, originally, the average of numbers from 1 to n is (sum of numbers)/n. The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2. So the original average is (n(n+1)/2)/n = (n+1)/2. That makes sense. If you take numbers from 1 to n, the average is the middle value, which is (n+1)/2. But in this case, we removed one number, so we have (n - 1) numbers left. The average of the remaining numbers is given as 152/7. So, the new average is (original sum - removed number)/(n - 1) = 152/7. So, let&#39;s write that as an equation:(Original sum - removed number) / (n - 1) = 152/7We know the original sum is n(n + 1)/2, so substituting that in:(n(n + 1)/2 - x) / (n - 1) = 152/7Here, x is the removed number. We need to find x. But we have two variables here: n and x. So, we need to find integers n and x such that this equation holds, where n is a positive integer, x is a natural number between 1 and n inclusive.So, the key is to solve for n and x. Since 152/7 is a fraction, approximately 21.714... So the average of the remaining numbers is approximately 21.71. That might help us estimate n.Wait, since the original average is (n + 1)/2. After removing a number, the average becomes 152/7. So, depending on whether x is higher or lower than the original average, the new average would increase or decrease.But in this case, the new average is 152/7 ≈ 21.71. Let&#39;s see. Suppose the original average was around that. If we remove a number higher than the average, the new average would increase; if we remove a number lower than the average, the new average would decrease. Wait, no: if we remove a number higher than the average, the sum decreases more, so the average would decrease. Wait, no, maybe I need to think again.Original average is (n + 1)/2. After removing x, the new average is (original sum - x)/(n - 1). Let&#39;s denote original average as A = (n + 1)/2. Then the new average A&#39; = (n(n + 1)/2 - x)/(n - 1). Let&#39;s express A&#39; in terms of A:A&#39; = (nA - x)/(n - 1) = (nA - x)/(n - 1). Hmm. Let&#39;s rearrange this:A&#39; = [nA - x]/(n - 1) = [A + (n - 1)A - x]/(n - 1) = A + [ (n - 1)A - x ]/(n - 1 )Wait, maybe that&#39;s complicating things. Alternatively, think of the difference between the original average and the new average.The original total sum is nA, and the new total sum is (n - 1)A&#39;. The difference is x = nA - (n - 1)A&#39;.So, x = nA - (n - 1)A&#39;But A is (n + 1)/2, and A&#39; is 152/7.So substituting in:x = n*(n + 1)/2 - (n - 1)*(152/7)So, x = [n(n + 1)/2] - [(152/7)(n - 1)]But x must be an integer between 1 and n. So, we can write:x = [n(n + 1)/2 - 152(n - 1)/7]Since x is an integer, the expression [n(n + 1)/2 - 152(n - 1)/7] must be an integer. Therefore, the term 152(n - 1)/7 must result in a value such that when subtracted from n(n + 1)/2, the result is an integer. So, 152(n - 1) must be divisible by 7. Because 152(n - 1)/7 must be a number that, when subtracted from the sum (which is an integer), gives an integer. So 152(n - 1) must be divisible by 7. Hence, 152(n - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.Since 152 divided by 7 is 21 with a remainder of 5, because 21*7=147, 152-147=5. So 152 ≡ 5 mod 7. Therefore, 152(n - 1) ≡ 5(n - 1) mod 7. So 5(n - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7. That implies that (n - 1) must be congruent to 0 mod 7, since 5 and 7 are coprime. Therefore, n - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Therefore, n ≡ 1 mod 7. So n is of the form 7k + 1, where k is a positive integer.So n can be 8, 15, 22, 29, etc. Let&#39;s note that.Also, since x must be between 1 and n, we can maybe estimate possible values of n.Original average was (n + 1)/2. The new average is 152/7 ≈ 21.71. Let&#39;s suppose that n is such that (n + 1)/2 is slightly higher or lower than 21.71. If the original average was higher, then removing a number higher than the average would bring the average down. If original average was lower, removing a number lower than the average would bring the average up. Hmm, but in this case, 152/7 is approximately 21.71. Let&#39;s see.Suppose n is around 43, since (43 + 1)/2 = 22. So original average is 22. Then, removing a number that&#39;s a bit higher than the average (maybe 22 or 23) would bring the average down to 21.71. Alternatively, if n is smaller. Wait, but maybe let&#39;s work more precisely.We can use the equation we had earlier:x = [n(n + 1)/2 - 152(n - 1)/7]We can write this as:x = (7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1)) / 14Since x must be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 14. Let&#39;s compute the numerator:7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1) = 7n² + 7n - 304n + 304 = 7n² - 297n + 304Therefore, 7n² - 297n + 304 must be divisible by 14. Wait, but that&#39;s a bit complicated. Alternatively, since we know that n ≡ 1 mod 7, n can be written as 7k + 1. Let&#39;s substitute n = 7k + 1 into the equation.So n = 7k + 1, then:x = [ (7k + 1)(7k + 2)/2 - 152(7k + 1 - 1)/7 ]Simplify:First term: (7k + 1)(7k + 2)/2Second term: 152(7k)/7 = 152kSo x = [ (7k + 1)(7k + 2)/2 - 152k ]Compute (7k + 1)(7k + 2):= 49k² + 14k + 7k + 2 = 49k² + 21k + 2Therefore:x = (49k² + 21k + 2)/2 - 152k= (49k² + 21k + 2 - 304k)/2= (49k² - 283k + 2)/2Since x must be a positive integer, (49k² - 283k + 2) must be even, so the numerator must be even. Let&#39;s check:49k² is odd if k is odd, even if k is even. 283k is odd if k is odd, even if k is even. Then 49k² - 283k is even when k is even (even - even) and odd when k is odd (odd - odd = even). Wait, hold on:Wait, 49k²: 49 is odd, so 49k² is odd if k is odd, even if k is even.Similarly, 283k: 283 is odd, so 283k is odd if k is odd, even if k is even.Therefore, 49k² - 283k is odd - odd = even if k is odd; even - even = even if k is even. Therefore, regardless of k, 49k² - 283k is even. Then adding 2, which is even, so total is even + even = even. Therefore, the numerator is even, so x is an integer. So that condition is satisfied.Therefore, x = (49k² - 283k + 2)/2But x must be between 1 and n = 7k + 1.So:1 ≤ (49k² - 283k + 2)/2 ≤ 7k + 1Multiply all parts by 2:2 ≤ 49k² - 283k + 2 ≤ 14k + 2Subtract 2 from all parts:0 ≤ 49k² - 283k ≤ 14kSo, first inequality: 49k² - 283k ≥ 0Second inequality: 49k² - 283k ≤ 14kFirst inequality: 49k² - 283k ≥ 0Factor out k: k(49k - 283) ≥ 0Since k is a positive integer (since n = 7k + 1 must be at least 1, so k ≥ 0, but n must be at least 1, so k ≥ 0. But when k = 0, n = 1, which is trivial and probably not the case here. So k ≥ 1.Therefore, k(49k - 283) ≥ 0Since k ≥ 1, the term (49k - 283) must be ≥ 0. So:49k - 283 ≥ 0 =&gt; 49k ≥ 283 =&gt; k ≥ 283/49 ≈ 5.7755. Therefore, k ≥ 6.Second inequality: 49k² - 283k ≤ 14kSo, 49k² - 297k ≤ 0Factor out k: k(49k - 297) ≤ 0Again, since k ≥ 1, 49k - 297 ≤ 0 =&gt; 49k ≤ 297 =&gt; k ≤ 297/49 ≈ 6.061. Therefore, k ≤ 6.So combining both inequalities, k must be ≥ 6 and ≤ 6. Therefore, k = 6.So k = 6. Therefore, n = 7k + 1 = 7*6 + 1 = 43. So n = 43.Then x = (49k² - 283k + 2)/2. Let&#39;s compute that:k = 6:49*(6)^2 - 283*(6) + 2 = 49*36 - 283*6 + 2Calculate each term:49*36: Let&#39;s compute 50*36 = 1800, subtract 1*36 = 36, so 1800 - 36 = 1764283*6: 280*6 = 1680, 3*6 = 18, so 1680 + 18 = 1698Then, 1764 - 1698 + 2 = (1764 - 1698) + 2 = 66 + 2 = 68Then x = 68 / 2 = 34.Therefore, x = 34. Let me check if that makes sense.So, n = 43, numbers from 1 to 43. The sum is 43*44/2 = (43*22) = 946. If we remove 34, the sum becomes 946 - 34 = 912. The number of remaining numbers is 42. Then the average is 912/42. Let&#39;s compute that.Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 912 ÷ 6 = 152, 42 ÷ 6 = 7. So 152/7 ≈ 21.714, which is 152/7. That&#39;s exactly the average given. So this checks out.Therefore, the removed number is 34. So the answer is 34.But let me just verify once more. Let&#39;s compute 43*44/2 = 43*22 = 946. Then subtract 34: 946 - 34 = 912. Then 912 divided by 42 is indeed 21.714285..., which is 152/7. Yep, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the answer is 34.Final AnswerThe removed number is boxed{34}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( n ) consecutive natural numbers starting from 1, if one of the numbers is removed, the average of the remaining numbers is (frac{152}{7}). We need to find the removed number.1. The sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is (frac{n(n+1)}{2}).2. After removing a number ( x ), the sum of the remaining numbers is (frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x).3. The average of the remaining ( n - 1 ) numbers is (frac{152}{7}).Setting up the equation:[frac{frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x}{n - 1} = frac{152}{7}]Multiplying both sides by ( n - 1 ):[frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x = frac{152}{7}(n - 1)]Rearranging to solve for ( x ):[x = frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{152}{7}(n - 1)]To ensure ( x ) is an integer, ( frac{152(n - 1)}{7} ) must be an integer. Since 152 ≡ 5 mod 7, ( n - 1 ) must be a multiple of 7. Let ( n = 7k + 1 ).Substituting ( n = 7k + 1 ):[x = frac{(7k + 1)(7k + 2)}{2} - 152k]Simplifying:[x = frac{49k^2 + 21k + 2}{2} - 152k = frac{49k^2 - 283k + 2}{2}]For ( x ) to be an integer, the numerator must be even. Solving inequalities for ( k ):[1 leq frac{49k^2 - 283k + 2}{2} leq 7k + 1]This results in ( k = 6 ), giving ( n = 43 ). Substituting ( k = 6 ):[x = frac{49(6)^2 - 283(6) + 2}{2} = frac{1764 - 1698 + 2}{2} = frac{68}{2} = 34]Verification:- Original sum: (frac{43 cdot 44}{2} = 946)- After removing 34: (946 - 34 = 912)- Average: (frac{912}{42} = frac{152}{7})Thus, the removed number is (boxed{34}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about consecutive natural numbers starting from 1. So, if we have n consecutive numbers starting at 1, that&#39;s just the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n. Then, one of these numbers is removed, and the average of the remaining numbers is 152/7. We need to find which number was removed. First, let me recall that the average of a set of numbers is the sum divided by the number of elements. So, originally, without any numbers removed, the average of numbers from 1 to n would be (1 + 2 + ... + n)/n. The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)/2, so the average is (n + 1)/2. But in this case, a number is removed, so the new average is given as 152/7. Let me denote the removed number as x. Then, the sum of the remaining numbers would be the original sum minus x, and the number of remaining numbers is n - 1. Therefore, the new average is (original sum - x)/(n - 1) = 152/7.So, let&#39;s write that equation. The original sum is n(n + 1)/2. Therefore:(n(n + 1)/2 - x)/(n - 1) = 152/7.Our goal is to find x, but we might need to figure out n first. Because both n and x are integers, and 152/7 is a fraction, which is approximately 21.714... So, the average after removing the number is a little less than 22. Let me write the equation again:(n(n + 1)/2 - x) = (152/7)(n - 1).Multiply both sides by 14 to eliminate denominators:7n(n + 1) - 14x = 304(n - 1).Hmm, but maybe that&#39;s complicating. Let&#39;s try to rearrange the original equation. Let me express x in terms of n:x = n(n + 1)/2 - (152/7)(n - 1).Since x must be a natural number between 1 and n, the right-hand side must be an integer. Therefore, (152/7)(n - 1) must be such that when subtracted from n(n + 1)/2, the result is an integer. Which suggests that (152/7)(n - 1) must be a rational number with denominator dividing 2, perhaps. Wait, but 152/7 is already a fraction. Let&#39;s see:First, note that 152/7 is equal to 21 and 5/7. So, the average after removal is 21 and 5/7. The original average is (n + 1)/2. Since removing a number will affect the average, maybe the original average is higher than 21.714... Let&#39;s see.Suppose the original average is (n + 1)/2. Then, after removing a number, the average becomes lower if the removed number is higher than the original average, or higher if the removed number is lower. Wait, but actually, the average will change depending on the value of the removed number. If you remove a number higher than the original average, the new average will decrease. If you remove a number lower than the original average, the new average will increase. Hmm. But here, the new average is 152/7 ≈ 21.714. So, if the original average was higher than that, then the removed number was higher than the original average. If the original average was lower, then the removed number was lower. But we don&#39;t know the original average. But perhaps we can express the original average in terms of n and see how it relates.Alternatively, let&#39;s go back to the equation:(n(n + 1)/2 - x)/(n - 1) = 152/7.Multiply both sides by (n - 1):n(n + 1)/2 - x = (152/7)(n - 1).Then, solving for x:x = n(n + 1)/2 - (152/7)(n - 1).So, x must be a positive integer between 1 and n. Therefore, the right-hand side must be an integer. Let&#39;s express this equation with a common denominator:x = (7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1)) / 14.Because:n(n + 1)/2 = (7n(n + 1))/14,and (152/7)(n - 1) = (152(n - 1))/7 = (304(n - 1))/14,so subtracting gives [7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1)] / 14.Therefore, 7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1) must be divisible by 14, and the result is x, which is between 1 and n.Therefore, 7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1) ≡ 0 mod 14.Let me compute this modulo 14:First, 7n(n + 1) mod 14: since 7 is a factor, 7n(n + 1) is congruent to 0 mod 7, but we need mod 14. Let&#39;s see:7n(n + 1) mod 14: since 7 is multiplied by n(n + 1), which is two consecutive integers, so one of them is even. Therefore, n(n + 1) is even, so 7 * even = 14k, so 7n(n + 1) is divisible by 14, hence 7n(n + 1) ≡ 0 mod 14.Then, -304(n - 1) mod 14. Let&#39;s compute -304 mod 14 first.14*21 = 294, so 304 - 294 = 10, so 304 ≡ 10 mod 14. Therefore, -304 ≡ -10 mod 14, which is equivalent to 4 mod 14 (since -10 + 14 = 4). Therefore, -304(n - 1) ≡ 4(n - 1) mod 14.Therefore, overall, the expression 7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1) ≡ 0 + 4(n - 1) ≡ 4(n - 1) mod 14. Since this expression must be congruent to 0 mod 14, we have:4(n - 1) ≡ 0 mod 14.Divide both sides by 2:2(n - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.Therefore, 2(n - 1) must be divisible by 7. Therefore, (n - 1) must be divisible by 7/ gcd(2,7) = 7. Since gcd(2,7)=1, so (n - 1) must be divisible by 7. Therefore, n - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 =&gt; n ≡ 1 mod 7. Therefore, n = 7k + 1 for some integer k.So, n is one more than a multiple of 7. That gives possible n values as 8, 15, 22, 29, etc. But since the average after removal is 152/7 ≈ 21.714, which is a bit over 21, let&#39;s see. The original average (n + 1)/2 must be close to that. If the original average is around 21.714, then (n + 1)/2 ≈ 21.714 =&gt; n + 1 ≈ 43.428 =&gt; n ≈ 42.428. Since n must be an integer, possible n is 42 or 43. But wait, we just found that n must be ≡1 mod 7. So, n=43 would be 43-1=42, which is not divisible by 7. 42 divided by 7 is 6, so 42 is divisible by 7. Wait, hold on: n-1 must be divisible by 7. So, n=1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,... So, in the vicinity of 42.428, the closest n would be 43, but n=43 is 43-1=42, which is 6*7=42. So yes, 43 is 7k +1 where k=6: 7*6 +1=43. So n=43 is a possible candidate.Wait, but let&#39;s check the original average when n=43: (43 +1)/2=44/2=22. So the original average is 22. The new average is 152/7≈21.714, which is lower. Therefore, the removed number must be higher than the original average. So x&gt;22. So x is between 23 and 43.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if n=43 works. Let&#39;s compute x using the equation:x = (7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1)) / 14.Plugging in n=43:x = (7*43*44 - 304*42)/14.First compute 7*43*44:7*43=301, 301*44. Let&#39;s compute 300*44 +1*44=13200 +44=13244.Then 304*42: 300*42 +4*42=12600 +168=12768.So x=(13244 -12768)/14=(476)/14=34.34 is an integer, and it is between 1 and 43. So x=34. Therefore, if n=43, the removed number is 34. Let&#39;s verify this.Original sum is 43*44/2= (43*22)=946. Then, after removing 34, the sum becomes 946 -34=912. The number of remaining numbers is 42. Then, 912/42=21.714285..., which is 152/7≈21.7142857. So that checks out. Therefore, n=43, x=34.But wait, the problem states &quot;For n consecutive natural numbers starting from 1...&quot;, so n is the number of numbers, starting from 1. So n is 43. Then, the removed number is 34. Therefore, the answer should be 34.But before finalizing, let&#39;s check if there could be another possible n. Let&#39;s see, suppose n=7k +1, and the next possible n would be 50. Let&#39;s check n=50.Original average is (50 +1)/2=25.5. The new average is 152/7≈21.714, which is significantly lower. The difference in averages would require that the removed number is much higher. Let&#39;s compute x:x = (7*50*51 - 304*49)/14.Compute 7*50*51: 7*50=350, 350*51=17850.304*49: 300*49=14700, 4*49=196, so total=14700+196=14896.x=(17850 -14896)/14=(2954)/14=211. So 2954 ÷14: 14*211=2954. So x=211. But x must be between 1 and 50. So 211 is way larger than 50. Therefore, invalid. So n=50 is impossible.Similarly, the previous n=36. Let&#39;s check n=36.Original average (36 +1)/2=18.5. The new average is 21.714, which is higher. So the removed number must be lower than the original average. Let&#39;s compute x:x=(7*36*37 - 304*35)/14.7*36=252, 252*37=9324.304*35=10640.x=(9324 -10640)/14=(-1316)/14= -94. Not possible, as x must be positive. Therefore, invalid.Similarly, n=29:Original average (29 +1)/2=15. New average≈21.714, which is higher. So need to remove a number lower than 15. Let&#39;s compute x:x=(7*29*30 -304*28)/14.7*29=203, 203*30=6090.304*28=8512.x=(6090 -8512)/14=(-2422)/14≈-173. Again negative. Not possible.n=22:Original average (22 +1)/2=11.5. New average≈21.714. So need to remove a number lower than 11.5, but x must be between 1 and 22. Let&#39;s compute:x=(7*22*23 -304*21)/14.7*22=154, 154*23=3542.304*21=6384.x=(3542 -6384)/14=(-2842)/14=-203. Negative, invalid.n=15:Original average (15 +1)/2=8. New average≈21.714. Even more discrepancy. x=(7*15*16 -304*14)/14.7*15=105, 105*16=1680.304*14=4256.x=(1680 -4256)/14=(-2576)/14=-184. Still negative.n=8:Original average (8+1)/2=4.5. New average≈21.714. Not possible. x=(7*8*9 -304*7)/14.7*8*9=504.304*7=2128.x=(504 -2128)/14=(-1624)/14=-116. Negative. So, the only valid n is 43, giving x=34. Hence, the removed number is 34.But let me check once again to make sure.Original numbers are 1 to 43. Sum is 43*44/2=946. Remove 34, sum becomes 946 -34=912. Number of numbers is 42. 912 divided by 42: let&#39;s compute 42*21=882, 912 -882=30, so 21 + 30/42=21 + 5/7=152/7. Yes, exactly. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the answer is 34.Final Answerboxed{34}&lt;/think&gt;Given ( n ) consecutive natural numbers starting from 1, if one of the numbers is removed, the average of the remaining numbers is ( frac{152}{7} ). We need to find the removed number.1. The original sum of ( n ) consecutive natural numbers is ( frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ).2. Let ( x ) be the removed number. The sum of the remaining numbers is ( frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - x ).3. The number of remaining numbers is ( n - 1 ).4. The average of the remaining numbers is given by:   [   frac{frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - x}{n - 1} = frac{152}{7}   ]5. Rearranging the equation to solve for ( x ):   [   x = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - frac{152}{7}(n - 1)   ]6. Simplifying the equation with a common denominator:   [   x = frac{7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1)}{14}   ]7. For ( x ) to be an integer, ( 7n(n + 1) - 304(n - 1) ) must be divisible by 14. This implies ( n - 1 ) must be divisible by 7, so ( n equiv 1 mod 7 ).8. Testing possible values of ( n ) around the approximate average ( frac{152}{7} approx 21.714 ), we find ( n = 43 ) (since ( 43 - 1 = 42 ) is divisible by 7).9.

It has three parts, so I need to focus on each one at a time. Let me start with part (1): finding the equation of line l. The problem states that line l passes through the point P(2, -1), and the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2. So, first, I need to recall that the intercepts of a line are the points where it crosses the x-axis and y-axis. For the x-intercept, the y-coordinate is 0, and for the y-intercept, the x-coordinate is 0. Let me denote the x-intercept as (a, 0) and the y-intercept as (0, b). The sum of these intercepts is given as 2. Wait, actually, hold on—is the sum of the intercepts the sum of the coordinates or the sum of the intercept values? Hmm. Let me think. The problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2.&quot; So, intercepts here refer to the intercept values. That is, the x-intercept is a (the value where x=a when y=0) and the y-intercept is b (the value where y=b when x=0). Therefore, the sum a + b = 2. So, the equation of the line in intercept form is x/a + y/b = 1. Since the line passes through P(2, -1), substituting x=2 and y=-1 into this equation should satisfy it. So, 2/a + (-1)/b = 1. Also, we know that a + b = 2. So, we have two equations:1. 2/a - 1/b = 12. a + b = 2I need to solve these two equations for a and b. Let me write them again:Equation 1: 2/a - 1/b = 1Equation 2: a + b = 2Let me denote equation 2 as b = 2 - a. Then substitute b into equation 1.So, replacing b in equation 1 with 2 - a:2/a - 1/(2 - a) = 1Now, let&#39;s solve for a. To do this, find a common denominator. The denominators are a and (2 - a), so common denominator is a(2 - a). Multiply each term by a(2 - a):2*(2 - a) - a = a(2 - a)Simplify each term:First term: 2*(2 - a) = 4 - 2aSecond term: -aThird term: a*(2 - a) = 2a - a²So, combining the left side:4 - 2a - a = 4 - 3aRight side: 2a - a²So, equation becomes:4 - 3a = 2a - a²Bring all terms to left side:4 - 3a - 2a + a² = 0Simplify:a² - 5a + 4 = 0Factor the quadratic equation:Looking for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add up to -5. Wait, the equation is a² -5a +4. So, factors of 4 that add to -5. The factors would be -1 and -4. So, (a -1)(a -4) = 0. Therefore, a = 1 or a =4.Therefore, possible solutions for a are 1 and 4. Then, since b = 2 - a, if a=1, then b=1; if a=4, then b= -2.So, we have two possible pairs of intercepts: (a=1, b=1) and (a=4, b=-2). Now, we need to check if these are valid.First, let&#39;s check a=1 and b=1. Then the equation of the line would be x/1 + y/1 =1, which simplifies to x + y =1. Does this line pass through P(2, -1)? Let&#39;s check: 2 + (-1) =1. Yes, 1=1. So, that works.Next, a=4 and b=-2. The equation would be x/4 + y/(-2) =1, which can be written as x/4 - y/2 =1. Multiply both sides by 4: x - 2y =4. Let&#39;s check if this passes through P(2, -1). Substitute x=2, y=-1: 2 -2*(-1) = 2 +2=4. Yes, 4=4. So, this also works.Therefore, there are two possible lines: x + y =1 and x -2y =4. But the problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. Let&#39;s check if both solutions satisfy this.For the first line, intercepts are a=1 and b=1. Sum is 1 +1=2. Correct.For the second line, intercepts are a=4 and b=-2. Sum is 4 + (-2)=2. Also correct. So both lines satisfy the given condition.But the problem asks for &quot;the equation of line l&quot;. Wait, but the problem is presented in a way that suggests there is a unique answer. Maybe I missed something here. Let me check again.Wait, perhaps even though the sum of the intercepts is 2, the intercepts themselves can be negative. For example, if the line crosses the negative part of the axis, the intercept would be negative, but the problem didn&#39;t specify that the intercepts are positive. So both solutions are valid. But then the problem might need both equations? But the answer is supposed to be boxed, so likely there is a unique answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me check the problem again. It says line l passes through point P(2, -1), and the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2. So, intercepts can be positive or negative. So both lines x + y =1 and x -2y =4 are valid. Therefore, there are two possible lines. But the problem says &quot;Find the equation of line l&quot;. Hmm, so maybe both are acceptable? But the problem is structured with three parts, so part (1) might have two answers? But perhaps there is a mistake here. Wait, let me check the calculations again.Wait, when a=4, then b= -2. So the intercepts are (4,0) and (0, -2). But the problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. So the intercepts are a and b, so 4 + (-2)=2. Correct. So that&#39;s acceptable.But when the line crosses the y-axis at a negative point, the y-intercept is negative, but the problem didn&#39;t restrict intercepts to be positive. Therefore, both lines are valid. Therefore, part (1) might have two answers. However, let me check if both lines are possible for the subsequent parts. The circle M is tangent to line l at point P, and its center lies on 2x + y =0. So maybe only one of the lines allows such a circle? Therefore, maybe we need to check both possibilities and see which one fits for part (2).So perhaps part (1) has two answers, but part (2) can only be solved for one of them. Wait, the problem is in Chinese, but translated here, part (1) is to find the equation of line l, and then part (2) is to find the equation of circle M. So if there are two possible lines l, each would correspond to a different circle M. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify any other conditions, so perhaps the problem expects both answers? But given that the problem is structured with three parts, likely expecting a single answer for each, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the intercepts. Wait, in the problem statement, &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. So, if intercepts can be positive or negative, but the sum is 2. So if intercepts are a and b, then a + b =2. However, in the case of a=4 and b=-2, the line crosses the y-axis at (0, -2), so the y-intercept is -2. So sum 4 + (-2) =2. Correct. Similarly, a=1, b=1, sum 2. Both lines are acceptable.But perhaps the problem expects intercepts to be positive? If intercepts are required to be positive, then only the first case (a=1, b=1) is valid. But the problem didn&#39;t specify that. So, maybe there&#39;s an error here. Alternatively, maybe in Chinese problems, intercepts are considered as lengths, hence positive. But I need to check.Alternatively, maybe when the problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;, it refers to the sum of the lengths, hence absolute values. Then, |a| + |b| =2. In that case, the sum would be different. Let&#39;s check.Wait, in Chinese math problems, sometimes intercepts are considered as lengths, so absolute values. But the problem here is translated, so it&#39;s not clear. If we take intercepts as lengths, then |a| + |b| =2, which complicates things.But given that the problem statement says &quot;the sum of its intercepts&quot;, without specifying absolute values, it&#39;s more likely that the intercepts are taken as values, not their absolute values. Therefore, both solutions are possible.Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed to have two possible lines, but in the subsequent parts, the circle M must be tangent to line l at point P, with center on 2x + y =0. So for each line l, there might be a unique circle. Therefore, maybe both lines and circles are possible. But the problem asks &quot;Find the equation of line l&quot; and &quot;Find the equation of circle M&quot;. If there are two possibilities, then the answers would have two options each. But given that the problem is presented with three parts, each expecting a single answer, likely only one solution is valid, so perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, let me check the problem again. The problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. So if &quot;intercepts&quot; are the x-intercept and y-intercept, which are points, but their sum might mean the sum of their coordinates. Wait, but intercepts on axes are points. For example, the x-intercept is (a, 0), and the y-intercept is (0, b). Then, the sum of the intercepts could mean adding these points as vectors, which would be (a, b). But the problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. So this is ambiguous.Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the sum of the intercepts as the sum of the x-intercept and the y-intercept. So, meaning if x-intercept is a, y-intercept is b, then a + b =2. Then, same as before.But perhaps the problem uses intercepts as lengths, so positive quantities, which would mean that if a line crosses the negative y-axis, the intercept is considered positive? But that&#39;s not standard. Usually, intercepts can be positive or negative. For example, the line y = -x -2 has a y-intercept at (0, -2), so the intercept is -2. Therefore, if the problem didn&#39;t specify, we have to consider intercepts as signed numbers.Therefore, with that in mind, both lines x + y =1 and x -2y =4 are valid. Therefore, part (1) has two answers. However, moving on to part (2), if we need to find the circle tangent to line l at P(2, -1) with center on 2x + y =0, perhaps only one of the lines will result in a valid circle.Therefore, perhaps I need to proceed with both possibilities for line l and check which one gives a valid circle.So, let&#39;s first take line l as x + y =1. Then, find the circle tangent to this line at P(2, -1) with center on 2x + y =0.Similarly, for line l as x -2y =4, find the circle tangent to this line at P(2, -1) with center on 2x + y =0.Then, check if both circles exist, or if one of them doesn&#39;t. Let&#39;s start with the first line: x + y =1.First, the general approach: the circle is tangent to line l at point P, so the center of the circle must lie along the line perpendicular to l at point P. The center is also on the line 2x + y =0. Therefore, the intersection of the perpendicular line at P and the line 2x + y =0 is the center of the circle.So, let&#39;s compute the slope of line l. For the first line, x + y =1. Let&#39;s rearrange to slope-intercept form: y = -x +1. Therefore, slope m1 = -1. The perpendicular slope would be the negative reciprocal, so m_perp =1.Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular line at P(2, -1) is y - (-1) =1*(x -2), which simplifies to y +1 = x -2, so y = x -3.Now, the center of the circle lies on both this perpendicular line (y =x -3) and the line 2x + y =0. Let&#39;s find their intersection.Solve the system:1. y = x -32. 2x + y =0Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:2x + (x -3) =03x -3 =03x=3x=1Then, y=1 -3= -2Therefore, the center is (1, -2). Now, the radius is the distance from the center to point P(2, -1). Let&#39;s compute that:Distance = sqrt[(2 -1)^2 + (-1 - (-2))^2] = sqrt[1^2 +1^2] = sqrt[2]Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =2.Now, let&#39;s check if this circle is indeed tangent to line l at P. Since the center is on the perpendicular line at P, and the radius is the distance from the center to P, which is also the distance from the center to line l (because the radius is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency). Therefore, this should be correct.Now, let&#39;s do the same for the second line l: x -2y =4.First, find the slope of line l. Rearranged: x -4 =2y =&gt; y = (1/2)x -2. So, slope m2 =1/2. The perpendicular slope is m_perp = -2.Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular line at P(2, -1) is y - (-1) = -2*(x -2) =&gt; y +1 = -2x +4 =&gt; y = -2x +3.Now, the center lies on both this perpendicular line (y = -2x +3) and the line 2x + y =0. Let&#39;s solve the system:1. y = -2x +32. 2x + y =0Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:2x + (-2x +3) =0 =&gt; 2x -2x +3 =0 =&gt; 3=0Wait, that&#39;s impossible. 3=0 is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution. Therefore, for the second line l: x -2y =4, there is no such circle M whose center lies on 2x + y=0 and is tangent to line l at P(2, -1). Therefore, this line is invalid for the given conditions. Therefore, only the first line x + y =1 is valid. Therefore, part (1) answer is x + y =1.Therefore, this resolves the ambiguity. So, even though there are two lines satisfying the intercept condition, only one of them allows a circle with center on 2x + y=0 and tangent at P. Therefore, the answer for part (1) is x + y =1.So, moving to part (2): Find the equation of circle M. As calculated above, the center is (1, -2), radius sqrt(2). Therefore, equation is (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =2. To confirm, let&#39;s check if this circle is tangent to line l at P. The distance from the center (1, -2) to line l: x + y -1=0 is |1 + (-2) -1| / sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = | -2 | / sqrt(2) =2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2), which equals the radius. Therefore, yes, it&#39;s tangent. And since the point P(2, -1) is on the circle: (2 -1)^2 + (-1 +2)^2 =1 +1=2. Correct.Therefore, equation of circle M is (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =2.Part (3): Find the length of the chord intercepted by circle M on the y-axis.To find the length of the chord on the y-axis, we need to find the points where the circle intersects the y-axis (x=0), then compute the distance between these two points.Set x=0 in the circle equation:(0 -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =2Simplify:1 + (y +2)^2 =2Subtract 1:(y +2)^2 =1Take square roots:y +2 = ±1Therefore, y= -2 +1= -1 or y= -2 -1= -3.Therefore, the points of intersection are (0, -1) and (0, -3). The distance between these two points is the difference in y-coordinates, since x=0 for both. So, distance = |(-1) - (-3)| = |2|=2. Therefore, the length of the chord is 2.But let me verify. The two points are (0, -1) and (0, -3). The vertical distance is |-1 - (-3)| = |-1 +3| = |2| =2. So, yes, the chord length is 2 units.Therefore, the answers are:(1) x + y =1(2) (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =2(3) 2Final Answer(1) boxed{x + y = 1}(2) boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 2}(3) boxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;Given that line ( l ) passes through point ( P(2, -1) ) and the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2, we need to find the equation of line ( l ). 1. Equation of line ( l ):   - Let the x-intercept be ( a ) and the y-intercept be ( b ). We have ( a + b = 2 ).   - The equation of the line in intercept form is ( frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} = 1 ).   - Substituting ( P(2, -1) ) into the equation, we get ( frac{2}{a} - frac{1}{b} = 1 ).   - Solving the system of equations ( frac{2}{a} - frac{1}{b} = 1 ) and ( a + b = 2 ), we find two possible solutions: ( (a = 1, b = 1) ) and ( (a = 4, b = -2) ).   - Checking the validity for the circle tangent to line ( l ) at ( P ) with center on ( 2x + y = 0 ), we find only the line ( x + y = 1 ) is valid.   [   boxed{x + y = 1}   ]2. Equation of circle ( M ):   - The center of the circle lies on the line ( 2x + y = 0 ) and the perpendicular to line ( l ) at ( P(2, -1) ).   - The slope of line ( l ) is -1, so the perpendicular slope is 1. The equation of the perpendicular line at ( P ) is ( y = x - 3 ).   - Solving the intersection of ( y = x - 3 ) and ( 2x + y = 0 ), we find the center is ( (1, -2) ).   - The radius is the distance from ( (1, -2) ) to ( P(2, -1) ), which is ( sqrt{2} ).   [   boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 2}   ]3. Length of the chord intercepted by circle ( M ) on the y-axis:   - Setting ( x = 0 ) in the circle&#39;s equation, we find the points of intersection with the y-axis: ( (0, -1) ) and ( (0, -3) ).   - The length of the chord is the distance between these points, which is 2.   [   boxed{2}   ],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. There are three parts: finding the equation of line l, finding the equation of circle M, and finding the length of the chord intercepted by circle M on the y-axis. Let&#39;s start with part (1).Problem (1): Find the equation of line l.Given that line l passes through point P(2, -1) and the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2. So, we need to find the equation of a line that satisfies these two conditions.First, let&#39;s recall that the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b = 1, where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept. The sum of the intercepts is a + b = 2. Also, the line passes through the point (2, -1), so substituting x=2 and y=-1 into the equation should satisfy it.So, let&#39;s set up the equations:1. 2/a + (-1)/b = 12. a + b = 2We have two equations with two variables, a and b. Let&#39;s try to solve them.From equation 2: b = 2 - a. Substitute this into equation 1:2/a + (-1)/(2 - a) = 1Let me write that down:2/a - 1/(2 - a) = 1To solve this equation for a, we can find a common denominator, which would be a(2 - a). Multiply each term by a(2 - a):2*(2 - a) - a = a(2 - a)Let&#39;s expand each term:Left side:2*(2 - a) = 4 - 2aThen subtract a: 4 - 2a - a = 4 - 3aRight side:a*(2 - a) = 2a - a^2So, the equation becomes:4 - 3a = 2a - a^2Bring all terms to one side:4 - 3a - 2a + a^2 = 0Simplify:a^2 -5a +4 =0Factor the quadratic:(a - 1)(a - 4) =0So, a =1 or a=4.If a=1, then from equation 2, b=2 -1=1.If a=4, then b=2 -4= -2.Now, let&#39;s check these solutions to make sure they are valid.Case 1: a=1, b=1.Intercept form: x/1 + y/1 =1, which is x + y =1.Does this line pass through (2, -1)? Let&#39;s check:2 + (-1) =1, which is correct. So, this works.Case 2: a=4, b=-2.Intercept form: x/4 + y/(-2) =1, which is x/4 - y/2 =1.Multiply both sides by 4: x - 2y =4.Check if (2, -1) is on this line:2 -2*(-1)=2 +2=4. Correct. So, this also works.Therefore, there are two possible lines: x + y =1 and x - 2y =4.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. Let&#39;s check if intercepts are a and b, but when b is negative, does the sum still count as a + b?Wait, the problem says &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. If the line has intercepts at (a,0) and (0,b), then the sum is |a| + |b|? Or is it a + b? The problem statement is in Chinese, but translated as &quot;the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. The original problem might use the term &quot;截距之和&quot;, which in Chinese usually refers to the algebraic sum, i.e., a + b, not the absolute values. However, intercepts can be negative if the line crosses the negative axis. So, in the second case, a=4, b=-2. The sum is 4 + (-2)=2, which is given. So, according to this, both solutions are valid.However, sometimes in some contexts, intercepts are considered as distances, hence positive. But in Chinese textbooks, 截距 can be positive or negative. So, the problem is likely expecting both solutions. But let&#39;s check the next parts. If there are two possible lines, then the circle in part (2) might also have two possibilities. But let&#39;s see what the problem asks. For part (1), it&#39;s just asking for the equation of line l. If there are two lines, we need to confirm whether both are possible.Wait, but the problem statement says &quot;line l passes through point P(2,-1), and the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2&quot;. So, if we have two solutions for line l, both of which satisfy these conditions, then both are correct. However, the subsequent parts (2) and (3) might require unique answers. Therefore, perhaps only one of the lines is valid when considering the circle&#39;s tangency condition. So, maybe we need to check which of the two lines is actually tangent to the circle M at point P, given that the center lies on 2x + y =0.But since part (1) is before part (2), maybe part (1) can have two answers, but the problem says &quot;Find the equation of line l&quot;. If it&#39;s expecting a single answer, perhaps there&#39;s an error in the problem or maybe I made a mistake in assuming that both are valid.Wait, let&#39;s check the equations again. For the intercept form, the intercepts are (a,0) and (0,b). So, for line x + y =1, the intercepts are (1,0) and (0,1), sum is 2. For line x - 2y =4, x-intercept is 4, y-intercept is -2, sum is 2. So, both are correct. Therefore, maybe part (1) has two solutions, but part (2) would depend on which line is chosen.But the problem says &quot;circle M&#39;s center lies on the line 2x + y =0, and it is tangent to line l at point P&quot;. So, if there are two lines l, then there would be two circles. But the problem states &quot;circle M&quot;, implying a single circle. So, perhaps there is only one valid line l for which such a circle exists. Therefore, we need to check which of the two lines allows for a circle centered on 2x + y =0 and tangent to l at P.Therefore, maybe only one of the lines is possible. Let&#39;s check.So, for each line l, we need to find a circle centered on 2x + y =0, passing through P(2,-1), and tangent to line l at P. The condition for tangency is that the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. Therefore, the center of the circle must lie along the line perpendicular to l at point P.Therefore, for each line l, we can find the perpendicular line at P, and find the intersection of this perpendicular line with the line 2x + y =0. That intersection point would be the center of the circle.Therefore, let&#39;s compute for both lines.First, line l1: x + y =1.The slope of l1 is -1. Therefore, the perpendicular slope is 1. So, the line perpendicular to l1 at P(2,-1) is y +1 =1*(x -2), which simplifies to y = x -3.Now, the center of the circle lies on both this perpendicular line (y = x -3) and the line 2x + y =0.Solve the system:y = x -32x + y =0Substitute y from the first equation into the second:2x + (x -3) =03x -3=0 =&gt; 3x =3 =&gt;x=1Then y=1 -3= -2So, center is (1, -2). Let&#39;s check if this is correct.The center (1,-2) is on 2x + y=0: 2*1 + (-2)=0. Yes, 2-2=0. Correct.Now, the radius is the distance from center to P(2,-1):sqrt[(2-1)^2 + (-1 +2)^2] = sqrt[1 +1] = sqrt(2). So, the circle equation is (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =2.Now, check if this circle is tangent to line l1 at P. Since the radius is perpendicular to l1, which is already considered, so yes, it is tangent.Now, let&#39;s check the other line l2: x -2y=4.First, find the slope of l2. Rewrite in slope-intercept form:x -4 =2y =&gt; y=(1/2)x -2. So, slope is 1/2. Therefore, the perpendicular slope is -2.The line perpendicular to l2 at P(2,-1) is y +1 = -2(x -2)Simplify: y +1 = -2x +4 =&gt; y = -2x +3Now, find the intersection of this line with 2x + y =0.So, substitute y = -2x +3 into 2x + y =0:2x + (-2x +3) =0 =&gt; 0x +3=0 =&gt; 3=0. Which is impossible.Therefore, no solution. That means there is no center on 2x + y =0 for the circle tangent to l2 at P. Therefore, the second line l2 is invalid because it does not allow such a circle. Therefore, the only valid line l is the first one: x + y =1.Therefore, answer to part (1) is x + y =1.Wait, that&#39;s crucial. So even though algebraically there were two lines satisfying the intercept condition, only one of them allows for a circle centered on 2x + y =0 and tangent at P. Therefore, part (1) answer is x + y =1.Therefore, moving forward with line l: x + y =1.Problem (2): Find the equation of circle M.From the previous part, we found that the center is (1, -2), and the radius is sqrt(2). Therefore, the equation is (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 = 2. Let me verify again.Yes, the center is on 2x + y =0: 2*1 + (-2) =0. Correct. The circle passes through P(2,-1):(2 -1)^2 + (-1 +2)^2 =1 +1=2. Correct. And the radius is perpendicular to line l at P, so it is tangent. Therefore, this is the correct circle.Problem (3): Find the length of the chord intercepted by circle M on the y-axis.To find the length of the chord on the y-axis, we need to find the points where the circle intersects the y-axis (x=0), then compute the distance between these two points.Substitute x=0 into the circle equation:(0 -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =21 + (y +2)^2 =2(y +2)^2 =1Take square roots:y +2 = ±1Therefore, y= -2 +1= -1 and y= -2 -1= -3So, the points are (0, -1) and (0, -3). The distance between them is |(-1) - (-3)| = |2| =2.Wait, but the distance between (0, -1) and (0, -3) is along the y-axis, so the vertical distance is 2 units. Therefore, the length of the chord is 2.But let me confirm by using the distance formula:sqrt[(0 -0)^2 + (-3 - (-1))^2] =sqrt[0 + (-2)^2]=sqrt[4]=2. Correct.Therefore, the length is 2.So, summarizing:1. Line l: x + y =12. Circle M: (x -1)^2 + (y +2)^2 =23. Chord length on y-axis: 2Final Answer(1) boxed{x + y = 1}(2) boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 2}(3) boxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;Given that line ( l ) passes through point ( P(2, -1) ) and the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2, we need to find the equation of line ( l ). 1. Equation of line ( l ):   - The intercept form of the line is ( frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} = 1 ) with ( a + b = 2 ).   - Substituting ( P(2, -1) ) into the intercept form, we get ( frac{2}{a} - frac{1}{b} = 1 ).   - Solving the system of equations ( frac{2}{a} - frac{1}{2 - a} = 1 ) and ( a + b = 2 ), we find ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 1 ), or ( a = 4 ) and ( b = -2 ).   - Checking the validity for the circle tangency condition, only the line ( x + y = 1 ) (with intercepts ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 1 )) allows a circle centered on ( 2x + y = 0 ) and tangent at ( P ).   [   boxed{x + y = 1}   ]2. Equation of circle ( M ):   - The center of the circle lies on the line ( 2x + y = 0 ) and is tangent to line ( l ) at ( P ).   - The perpendicular line to ( l ) at ( P ) intersects ( 2x + y = 0 ) at the center ( (1, -2) ).   - The radius is the distance from ( (1, -2) ) to ( P(2, -1) ), which is ( sqrt{2} ).   [   boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 2}   ]3. Length of the chord intercepted by circle ( M ) on the ( y )-axis:   - Substituting ( x = 0 ) into the circle equation, we find the intersection points ( (0, -1) ) and ( (0, -3) ).   - The distance between these points is 2.

Since line l passes through point P(2,-1), and the sum of its intercepts on the two coordinate axes is 2, we have the following system of equations:begin{cases} frac{2}{a} + frac{-1}{b} = 1  a + b = 2 end{cases}Solving this system, we get a=1 and b=1. Therefore, the equation of line l is boxed{x + y = 1}.(2) Let the coordinates of the center of circle M be (m, -2m). Then, we have frac{-2m + 1}{m - 2} = 1. Solving this equation, we get m=1. Therefore, the center of circle M is M(1, -2), and its radius is r = sqrt{2}. Hence, the equation of circle M is boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 2}.(3) Let x=0. Then, we can find the points of intersection of circle M with the y-axis, which are y = -2 pm 1. Therefore, the length of the chord intercepted by circle M on the y-axis is boxed{2}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-5cba23f0><span data-v-5cba23f0>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
