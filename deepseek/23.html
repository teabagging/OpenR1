The problem is about finding the number of subsets A of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} such that if an element a is in A, then 8 - a must also be in A. And the set A has to be non-empty. Hmm.First, I need to understand the condition properly. So, for any element a in A, its complement with respect to 8, which is 8 - a, must also be in A. Let me list out the pairs where each element and its complement are paired together. Let&#39;s see:1 and 7 (since 8 - 1 = 7)2 and 6 (8 - 2 = 6)3 and 5 (8 - 3 = 5)4 is alone because 8 - 4 = 4. So, 4 pairs with itself.So the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} can be divided into these pairs: {1,7}, {2,6}, {3,5}, and the singleton {4}.Now, the condition says that if you include any element from a pair, you must include its complement as well. For the singleton {4}, including 4 doesn&#39;t require anything else because 8 - 4 is 4 itself. So, for each of the three pairs {1,7}, {2,6}, {3,5}, we have choices: either include both elements or include neither. For the singleton {4}, we can choose to include it or not.So, how many ways can we make these choices? For each of the three pairs, there are 2 choices (include both or exclude both). For the singleton {4}, there are also 2 choices (include it or not). Therefore, the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition would be 2 (for pair 1) * 2 (for pair 2) * 2 (for pair 3) * 2 (for the singleton) = 2^4 = 16.But wait, the problem states that the set A must be non-empty. So, we need to subtract the case where all elements are excluded. In the total count of 16 subsets, one of them is the empty set. Therefore, the number of non-empty subsets would be 16 - 1 = 15.Wait, hold on. Let me verify this again. The total number of valid subsets (including the empty set) is indeed 2^4 = 16. Because each pair is an independent choice. But the problem requires non-empty sets. So subtracting 1 gives 15. But let me think again if I missed something.Alternatively, maybe I miscounted. Let&#39;s see:Each of the three pairs contributes 2 choices (include both or not), and the singleton 4 contributes 2 choices. So total subsets: 2*2*2*2 = 16. Yes. Then subtract 1 to exclude the empty set. So the answer is 15.But wait, let&#39;s make sure. For example, the set containing only the element 4: is that allowed? Yes, because 8 - 4 = 4, so including 4 satisfies the condition. So that set is valid and non-empty. Similarly, any combination where for each pair, either both are included or excluded. So the total valid subsets are indeed 16, and subtracting the empty set gives 15. So the answer should be 15.But wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s consider the problem as forming subsets where each element is part of a complementary pair. The pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4). So for each of the first three pairs, we can choose to include the pair or not. For the element 4, we can choose to include it or not. Therefore, the number of subsets is 2^3 (for the three pairs) multiplied by 2 (for the singleton) = 8 * 2 = 16. Then subtract 1 for the empty set, giving 15. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, maybe the problem counts the singleton {4} as non-empty. So if we don&#39;t include any pairs but include 4, that&#39;s a valid non-empty set. So the total number is 15. Let me check if there are any constraints I missed. The problem says &quot;non-empty set A&quot;, so yes, the empty set is excluded. So 16 total subsets minus 1 gives 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.But let me verify by enumerating small cases. For example, how many subsets are there if there&#39;s only one pair and the singleton. Suppose the set is {1,7,4}. Then the valid subsets would be: {}, {1,7}, {4}, {1,7,4}. That&#39;s 4 subsets. Non-empty would be 3. But according to the formula, it would be 2 pairs (the pair {1,7} and singleton {4}), so 2^2 = 4 total subsets, minus 1 empty set gives 3. Which matches. So scaling up, with three pairs and one singleton, the formula would be 2^(3+1) = 16, subtract 1 gives 15. Therefore, the answer should be 15.&lt;/think&gt;You will be given a problem. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within boxed{}:3. Let there be a non-empty set A subseteq{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and when a in A, it must also be that 8-a in A. The number of such sets A is qquadThe problem requires finding the number of non-empty subsets ( A ) of ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7}) such that if ( a in A ), then ( 8 - a in A ).  First, identify pairs of numbers that sum to 8:  - ( (1, 7) )  - ( (2, 6) )  - ( (3, 5) )  - ( 4 ) (since ( 8 - 4 = 4 ))  For each pair, there are two choices: include both elements or exclude both. For the singleton ( 4 ), there are two choices: include or exclude. This gives ( 2^3 times 2 = 16 ) total subsets.  Subtract the empty set to ensure ( A ) is non-empty:  [16 - 1 = 15]  Answer: (boxed{15}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about finding the number of subsets A of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} that are non-empty and satisfy the condition that if an element a is in A, then 8 - a must also be in A. Alright, so I need to figure out how many such subsets exist.First, let me parse the problem again. A must be a non-empty subset of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, and for every element a in A, the element 8 - a must also be in A. So, for example, if 1 is in A, then 7 must also be in A. Similarly, if 2 is in A, then 6 must be in A, and so on. The key here is that elements come in pairs that add up to 8. Let me list out these pairs:- 1 and 7 (since 1 + 7 = 8)- 2 and 6 (2 + 6 = 8)- 3 and 5 (3 + 5 = 8)- 4 and 4 (4 + 4 = 8, but 4 is alone)Wait, 4 is a special case because 8 - 4 is 4 itself. So, if 4 is included in A, then it must also be included, which is trivial because it&#39;s the same element. So, for the pair (4,4), including 4 in A doesn&#39;t require another distinct element; it just requires that 4 is there if it&#39;s there. So, 4 is a singleton in this pairing structure.Therefore, the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} can be partitioned into the pairs (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and the single element 4. Each of these pairs must be treated as a unit when building the subset A. That is, for each of the pairs, we can either include both elements or neither. For the element 4, we can choose to include it or not, but since 8 - 4 is itself, including 4 doesn&#39;t affect anything else.Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets formed by these pairs and the singleton, ensuring that the entire subset A is non-empty.Let me formalize this. The original set can be divided into three pairs and one singleton:1. Pair 1: {1,7}2. Pair 2: {2,6}3. Pair 3: {3,5}4. Singleton: {4}For each of the pairs, there are two choices: include both elements or include neither. For the singleton {4}, there are two choices: include it or not. Therefore, the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition (including the empty set) would be 2^3 (for the three pairs) multiplied by 2 (for the singleton), which is 2^4 = 16. But since we need non-empty subsets, we subtract 1 (the empty set), giving 15.Wait, hold on. Let me verify. Each pair has two options: include or exclude. There are three such pairs. The singleton {4} can be included or excluded. So total subsets are 2^3 * 2 = 16. But this includes the empty set. The problem states that A must be non-empty. Therefore, subtract 1, resulting in 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.But let me check again. Let&#39;s enumerate the possibilities. Each pair (1,7), (2,6), (3,5) can be either included or not. So for each pair, there&#39;s a binary choice. That&#39;s three independent choices, each with two options, so 2*2*2 = 8 possibilities. Then, for the element 4, we have two choices: include or exclude. So total subsets are 8*2=16. Subtract the empty set, which is when all pairs are excluded and 4 is excluded. So 16 -1 =15. That seems correct.But wait, is there a case where even if you include 4, you might still end up with an empty set? No, because if you include 4, then the set is non-empty. So the empty set is only when all pairs are excluded and 4 is excluded. Therefore, total valid subsets are 16 -1 =15.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: since each pair and the singleton are independent, except for the non-emptiness condition. So, the number of subsets is (number of subsets of pairs) multiplied by (number of subsets of singleton). The number of subsets of the pairs is 2^3=8 (each pair can be included or not). The number of subsets of the singleton is 2 (include or exclude). So total subsets including empty set: 8*2=16. Subtract 1 to exclude the empty set: 15.Therefore, the answer should be 15. Let me see if that makes sense.Wait, let&#39;s check with smaller examples. Suppose the set was {1,2,3,4} with the condition that if a is in A, then 5 -a is in A. Then the pairs would be (1,4) and (2,3). The singleton would be none, since 5-1=4, 5-2=3, etc. Then the number of subsets would be 2^2=4, minus 1 for non-empty, so 3. Let&#39;s verify:Possible non-empty subsets:- {1,4}- {2,3}- {1,4,2,3}- Wait, but that&#39;s three subsets. Wait, no. Wait, 2^2=4 subsets, including the empty set, so non-empty is 3. Yes, that works. So in this smaller example, the logic holds.Similarly, in the original problem, with three pairs and a singleton, the total is 2^(3+1)=16, minus 1=15. So that seems correct.Alternatively, think of the pairs as elements. Each pair is a &quot;composite element&quot;. The singleton is another element. So in total, 3 pairs +1 singleton=4 &quot;elements&quot;. Each can be chosen independently. So 2^4=16 subsets. Subtract 1 for empty set:15. So yes, that works.Therefore, the number of such sets A is 15. The answer is 15. Therefore, the boxed answer should be boxed{15}.&lt;/think&gt;You will be given a problem. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within boxed{}:3. Let there be a non-empty set A subseteq{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and when a in A, it must also be that 8-a in A. The number of such sets A is qquad---Step-by-Step Explanation:1. Identify Complementary Pairs:     The condition a in A implies 8 - a in A implies that elements must appear in complementary pairs summing to 8. The pairs are:     - (1, 7)     - (2, 6)     - (3, 5)     - The singleton 4 (since 8 - 4 = 4).  2. Structure of Valid Subsets:     - Each pair must be included or excluded entirely.     - The singleton 4 can be included or excluded independently.  3. Counting Subsets:     - Pairs: There are 3 pairs, each with 2 choices (include/exclude). Total: 2^3 = 8 options.     - Singleton: 2 choices (include/exclude 4). Total: 8 times 2 = 16 subsets.  4. Exclude the Empty Set:     Subtract the empty set (where all pairs and 4 are excluded). Total valid sets: 16 - 1 = 15.

(15 points) For 155 boxes containing red, yellow, and blue balls, there are three classification methods: for each color, boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class.

The problem mentions three classification methods based on each color. For each color, boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class. Then it says that all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification. Part (1) asks for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. Let me try to understand this. So, for each color (red, yellow, blue), we group boxes by the number of balls they have of that color. Each group is a class, right? The number of classes for each color would be the number of distinct quantities of that color&#39;s balls across all boxes. But the problem also states that all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification. Hmm, so for each number from 1 to 30, there exists at least one class (in either the red, yellow, or blue classification) that has exactly that number of boxes. So, the class sizes for the three color classifications cover all numbers from 1 to 30. Therefore, each number from 1 to 30 is represented exactly once as a class size in one of the three color classifications. But wait, does that mean that each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across all three classifications? Or could a number be used in more than one classification? For example, could there be a class of size 5 in red and another class of size 5 in yellow? The problem says &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify that they are unique, so maybe some numbers can be repeated across different colors. But if they can be repeated, then the total number of classes could be more than 30. However, since the problem is asking for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications, and given that we need to cover numbers from 1 to 30, perhaps each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across all three classifications? But that might not be possible since the sum of the classes in each classification must account for all 155 boxes. Let me think more carefully.Let me parse the problem again: &quot;for each color, boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class. If all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification, then...&quot; So &quot;classification&quot; here refers to each color&#39;s grouping. So each color (red, yellow, blue) has its own classification. Each classification is a partitioning of the 155 boxes into classes where each class has the same number of balls of that color. The size of a class (i.e., the number of boxes in it) can be any natural number. The problem states that all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification. That is, for each number n from 1 to 30, there exists at least one class (in either the red, yellow, or blue classification) that has exactly n boxes. Therefore, the class sizes for the three color classifications collectively include every integer from 1 to 30. However, some numbers might be used more than once across different colors, but each number from 1 to 30 must appear at least once. But we need to find the sum of the number of classes in each classification. So, for each color, the number of classes is the number of distinct quantities of that color&#39;s balls. For example, if in the red classification there are classes of size 2, 5, 10, then the number of classes for red is 3. Similarly for yellow and blue. Then, the sum of these three numbers (for red, yellow, blue) is what we need to find. But how does this relate to the fact that all numbers from 1 to 30 are represented as class sizes? Let&#39;s think. Each class size from 1 to 30 must be present in at least one of the three color classifications. However, each color&#39;s classification can have multiple class sizes, but the total number of boxes in each classification must sum up to 155. Wait, no. Each classification (for a color) is a partition of all 155 boxes into classes where each class has the same number of that color&#39;s balls. So, for each color, the classes are groups of boxes with the same number of red, yellow, or blue balls. However, the number of boxes in each class can vary. Wait, no: For a given color, each class is defined by a specific number of balls of that color. All boxes in a class have that number of balls. The number of boxes in a class is how many boxes have that number of balls. So, for example, in the red classification, if there are 5 boxes with 2 red balls, 10 boxes with 3 red balls, etc. Then, the class sizes (number of boxes in each class) for red would be 5, 10, etc. Similarly for yellow and blue. Therefore, for each color, the class sizes are the counts of boxes that have a particular number of balls of that color. The problem states that the numbers from 1 to 30 all appear as class sizes in at least one of the three color classifications. So, each number from 1 to 30 is the size of some class in red, yellow, or blue. Now, the total number of classes across all three classifications would be the sum we need, which is part (1). But how to compute this?Each class size (from 1 to 30) is present in at least one color. However, a class size can be present in multiple colors. For instance, there could be a class of size 5 in red and another class of size 5 in yellow. But the problem states that &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification&quot;. So each number 1 to 30 must be present at least once, but they can be present multiple times. However, the problem is asking for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. So, if, for example, each number from 1 to 30 is present in exactly one classification, then the total number of classes would be 30 in each classification? Wait, no. Each classification can have multiple classes. Wait, for each color, the number of classes is equal to the number of distinct quantities of that color&#39;s balls. For example, if red has 10 different quantities of red balls across all boxes, then red classification has 10 classes, each class being boxes with that quantity. The class sizes (number of boxes in each class) can be from 1 to 30, but each class size must be used at least once across all three colors. But the key here is that the total number of boxes is 155. For each color, the sum of all class sizes (i.e., the total number of boxes) must be 155. So for each color, the sum of the class sizes (which are the counts of boxes with each distinct number of that color&#39;s balls) must be 155. However, the problem states that all numbers from 1 to 30 are included as class sizes in some classification. Therefore, each of the numbers 1 through 30 must be a class size in at least one of the three color classifications. But since each color&#39;s classification is a partition of the 155 boxes into classes of different sizes (which are counts of boxes with the same number of that color&#39;s balls), we need to have that in each color&#39;s classification, the sum of the class sizes is 155. So, for red, yellow, and blue, we have:Sum_{r} n_r = 155,Sum_{y} n_y = 155,Sum_{b} n_b = 155,where n_r, n_y, n_b are the class sizes (number of boxes) in each color&#39;s classification.But the problem states that for each number from 1 to 30, there is at least one class (in red, yellow, or blue) with that number of boxes. So, the class sizes across all three colors must cover 1 to 30. Therefore, the union of the class sizes from red, yellow, and blue is exactly the set {1, 2, ..., 30}. But each color can have multiple class sizes, and they can overlap. For example, red might have class sizes {1, 2, 3}, yellow {2, 4, 5}, blue {6, ..., 30}, but the union would still be 1 to 30. But the problem is asking for the sum of the number of classes in each classification. Let’s denote the number of classes in red, yellow, blue as R, Y, B respectively. Then the total sum is R + Y + B. Each of R, Y, B is the number of distinct class sizes in their respective color. But since the class sizes must cover all numbers from 1 to 30, but each color&#39;s class sizes can overlap, how can we compute R + Y + B?Wait, but the class sizes for each color must be a collection of integers where each integer from 1 to 30 appears in at least one of the three collections. Additionally, for each color, the sum of its class sizes must equal 155. So, for each color, we have a multiset of integers (possibly with repeats?) but the problem says &quot;boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class&quot;. So, for a given color, each distinct number of balls corresponds to a class, and the size of the class is the number of boxes with that count. Therefore, each class size is a positive integer, and they can be anything, but for each color, the sum of the class sizes must be 155. Moreover, across all three colors, every integer from 1 to 30 must be a class size in at least one color. So, each color&#39;s classification is a partition of 155 into some number of positive integers (class sizes), and the union of all class sizes from the three colors is exactly {1, 2, ..., 30}. But now, to find R + Y + B, which is the total number of distinct class sizes across all three colors. Wait, no. Wait, R is the number of classes in red classification, which is the number of distinct red ball counts. Similarly, Y is the number of distinct yellow ball counts, B the number of distinct blue ball counts. But the class sizes (number of boxes per class) in each color can be overlapping. But the problem says that for each number from 1 to 30, that number is the size of some class in one of the classifications. Therefore, each number from 1 to 30 must be present as a class size in red, yellow, or blue. So, the total number of class sizes across all three classifications is at least 30, but possibly more if some numbers are repeated in different colors. However, the problem is asking for the sum of the number of classes in each classification. So, if a number is used in two different color classifications, it&#39;s counted twice. For example, if both red and yellow have a class of size 5, then 5 is counted in both R and Y. But the challenge is that for each color, the sum of the class sizes must be 155. Therefore, each color&#39;s classification must have class sizes that sum to 155. Let’s consider the minimal case where each class size from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across the three colors, but that would mean that the total number of classes is 30, but the sum for each color would need to be 155, which is a problem because the sum of numbers from 1 to 30 is 465. But we have three colors each needing to sum to 155, so total sum would be 3*155=465, which matches. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. The sum from 1 to 30 is (30*31)/2=465, which is exactly 3*155. Therefore, if we can partition the numbers 1 through 30 into three groups, each summing to 155, then each group corresponds to a color&#39;s class sizes, and each number is used exactly once. Therefore, in this case, R, Y, B would be the number of numbers in each group, and since all numbers from 1 to 30 are used once, R + Y + B = 30. But wait, but the problem says &quot;the number of classes in the three classifications&quot;, which would correspond to the number of elements in each partition. If each number is used exactly once, then the total number of classes would be 30. Therefore, the sum R + Y + B would be 30. But is this possible? Wait, because 1 + 2 + ... + 30 = 465, and 3*155=465. So, if we can partition the numbers 1 through 30 into three disjoint subsets each summing to 155, then each subset corresponds to the class sizes of a color. Therefore, each color&#39;s class sizes would be exactly the numbers in one subset, and since the subsets are disjoint, each number is used once. Therefore, the total number of classes would be 30. Hence, the answer to part (1) would be 30. But is this feasible? Can we partition 1-30 into three subsets each summing to 155?Alternatively, if the numbers can be reused across different colors, then the sum could be higher. However, since the total sum of all class sizes across all three colors would be 3*155=465, which is exactly the sum of 1 through 30. Therefore, if we use each number exactly once across the three colors, that&#39;s possible. But if we reuse numbers, then the total sum would exceed 465, which is not possible. Therefore, each number from 1 to 30 must be used exactly once across the three colors. Hence, the total number of classes is 30, so R + Y + B = 30. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is 30. But wait, before finalizing this, let me verify. Suppose we have three color classifications, each needing their class sizes to sum to 155, and the union of all class sizes is exactly 1 through 30 with no duplicates. Then each number is used exactly once in one of the three color classifications. Therefore, the total number of classes is 30, so sum R + Y + B = 30. So, the answer to part (1) is 30. Therefore, (1) is 30. Let me check with an example. Suppose we divide the numbers 1-30 into three groups each summing to 155. Let&#39;s see. For example, the first group could have numbers from 1 to k, such that their sum is 155. Let&#39;s see: 1+2+...+30=465, so each group should sum to 155. Let&#39;s attempt a rough partition. Let me try to find three subsets each adding up to 155.Alternatively, since the total is 465, which is 3*155, such a partition must exist if possible. However, partitioning the numbers 1-30 into three equal subsets is a known problem. It&#39;s similar to the partition into three equal parts problem. However, the feasibility depends on the numbers. Since 465 is divisible by 3, it&#39;s possible. But actually arranging the numbers into such subsets might be complex, but the problem doesn&#39;t require us to do that. It just states that such a classification exists. Therefore, given that the total is correct, the answer is 30. Therefore, part (1) answer is 30. Now part (2): Explain that it is possible to find three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.Hmm. So, we need to show that among the 155 boxes, there exist three boxes such that for at least two colors, the number of balls of those colors are the same in those three boxes. Wait, more precisely: &quot;the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same&quot;. So, for three boxes, at least two of the colors have the same count in those boxes. For example, two boxes might have the same number of red and yellow balls, and the third box also has the same number of red and yellow balls? Or each of the three boxes has the same number for two different colors? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe it means that in the three boxes, for at least two different colors, the number of balls of those colors are the same across the three boxes. For example, all three boxes have the same number of red balls, or all three have the same number of yellow balls, or same number of blue balls. But the problem says &quot;the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same&quot;. So, perhaps in each of the three boxes, two of the color counts are the same. But that might not make sense. Wait, the problem says &quot;three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same&quot;. So, maybe in these three boxes, for two colors, each box has the same number for those two colors. For example, all three boxes have the same number of red and yellow balls. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s saying that among the three boxes, there are two colors such that the number of balls of those two colors is the same in each of the three boxes. But that&#39;s a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s saying that in at least two of the colors, the three boxes have the same number of balls. For example, for two colors, say red and yellow, each of the three boxes has, say, 5 red and 3 yellow, but different blue. But that seems too specific. Alternatively, the problem could mean that among the three boxes, there are two colors such that all three boxes have the same number for those two colors. For example, two colors have the same number in all three boxes. But perhaps more likely, the problem is asking to find three boxes such that for at least two of the colors, each of those two colors has the same number across the three boxes. For instance, all three boxes have the same number of red balls and the same number of yellow balls, but different blue. Or same red and blue, same yellow and blue, etc. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s three boxes where for two different colors, the counts for those colors are the same in all three boxes. So, for example, all three boxes have the same number of red balls and the same number of yellow balls. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find three boxes where two of the boxes have the same number for one color, and another two boxes have the same number for another color. But the problem says &quot;three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same&quot;. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s similar to the pigeonhole principle. Since there are three boxes, and three colors, perhaps by some combinatorial argument, two colors must have the same number in at least two boxes, but extended to three boxes. Wait, the exact wording is: &quot;Explain that it is possible to find three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot;Maybe it means that in these three boxes, for at least two colors, the number of balls of those colors are the same in each of the three boxes. For example, all three boxes have 5 red balls and 3 yellow balls, but different blue. So, two colors are the same across all three boxes. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s three boxes such that for each of at least two colors, the three boxes have the same number for that color. For example, two colors are fixed across the three boxes. Alternatively, the problem might be asking to show that there exist three boxes where for at least two colors, the number of balls of those colors are equal within each box. For example, in each of the three boxes, the number of red balls equals the number of yellow balls. But that seems different. Wait, the problem is translated, so maybe the translation is a bit unclear. Let me check the original Chinese. Hmm, I can&#39;t do that. But given the problem as stated, perhaps the most straightforward interpretation is that among the three boxes, there are two colors such that all three boxes have the same number of balls for those two colors. So, for two colors, the count is the same in all three boxes. Alternatively, it could be that in the three boxes, at least two colors have the same number of balls in each box. For example, each box has the same number of red and yellow balls. But that would mean that in each box, red = yellow, but blue varies. But the problem says &quot;the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same&quot;. Alternatively, maybe that in the three boxes, for two colors, the numbers are the same. That is, two of the colors have the same count in each of the three boxes. So, for example, all three boxes have 5 red and 5 yellow, but different blue. But how do we approach this? The problem is part (2) following part (1), which we reasoned is 30. So, likely part (2) requires using the pigeonhole principle or some combinatorial argument based on the classes from part (1). Given that the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications is 30 (from part (1)), so each classification (red, yellow, blue) has some number of classes. Let&#39;s denote R, Y, B as the number of classes for red, yellow, blue respectively, with R + Y + B = 30. Each class in a color corresponds to a distinct number of balls of that color. For example, red has R different quantities, yellow has Y different, blue has B different. Each box is in exactly one class per color, meaning for each color, the box has a certain number of balls of that color, corresponding to a class. So, each box can be represented by a triple (r, y, b), where r is the number of red balls, y the number of yellow, and b the number of blue. The total number of possible triples is R * Y * B. However, there are 155 boxes. If R * Y * B &gt;= 155, but since R + Y + B = 30, we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality. The arithmetic mean of R, Y, B is 10, so the geometric mean is &lt;= 10, so R * Y * B &lt;= 10^3 = 1000. But 155 &lt; 1000, so that might not help. Alternatively, since each color&#39;s classes partition the 155 boxes. For red, there are R classes, each class being a group of boxes with the same number of red balls. Similarly for Y and B. But how to relate this to finding three boxes with two colors having the same number. Alternatively, consider that each box is characterized by a triple (r_i, y_j, b_k). If we can find three boxes such that two of their coordinates are the same. For example, three boxes that have the same r_i and y_j, but different b_k. Or same r_i and b_k, etc. But how does the number of classes factor into this? If R, Y, B are the number of classes, then the total number of possible pairs (r_i, y_j) is R * Y. Since there are 155 boxes, if R * Y &lt; 155, then by pigeonhole principle, some pair (r_i, y_j) must contain at least two boxes. But since we need three boxes, perhaps we need a different approach. Wait, the problem is asking for three boxes where for at least two colors, the numbers are the same. So, maybe in two of the colors, all three boxes share the same number. For example, all three have the same red and yellow counts, but different blue. Alternatively, for two colors, say red and yellow, there exists three boxes with the same red and same yellow counts. But since each color&#39;s classes are groupings where each class is a unique count, the number of distinct pairs (red, yellow) would be R * Y. If R * Y &lt; 155, then by pigeonhole principle, some pair would have multiple boxes. But since R + Y + B = 30, perhaps R * Y is sufficiently large? Wait, but if R + Y + B = 30, then the maximum possible R * Y occurs when R and Y are as large as possible. For example, if B is minimized. Let’s suppose B = 1, then R + Y = 29. The maximum product R * Y would be when R = 14.5, but since integers, R=14, Y=15, product 14*15=210. 210 is greater than 155, so even in that case, the number of pairs (r, y) is 210, which is more than 155, so no pigeonhole. Wait, but if R * Y &gt; 155, then the pigeonhole principle would not guarantee any duplicates. However, if R * Y &lt;=155, then we would have duplicates. But since R + Y + B =30, and B &gt;=1, R + Y &lt;=29. The maximum R * Y given R + Y =29 is when R=14, Y=15, which gives 210 as above. So 210 &gt;155, so even with R=14, Y=15, R*Y=210, which is more than 155, so you can have unique pairs. Therefore, with R * Y * B being the total number of possible triples, and since 155 is the number of boxes, if R * Y * B &gt;=155, which it likely is, then boxes can be unique. But the problem is not about uniqueness but about finding three boxes with two colors having the same counts. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, think of each box as a point in a 3-dimensional space with coordinates (r, y, b). We need to find three points such that two of their coordinates are the same. For example, three points with the same r and y, same r and b, or same y and b. But how to ensure that such triples exist? Alternatively, use the pigeonhole principle on the pairs. For each pair of colors, consider the number of possible pairs. For example, for red-yellow pairs, there are R * Y possible pairs. Similarly, red-blue: R * B, yellow-blue: Y * B. The total number of distinct pairs across all three color pairs is R*Y + R*B + Y*B. Each box corresponds to a unique triple (r, y, b), but contributes to three pairs: (r, y), (r, b), (y, b). If we have 155 boxes, each contributing to three pairs, the total number of pair occurrences is 155 * 3 = 465. The number of distinct pairs is R*Y + R*B + Y*B. Let’s denote P = R*Y + R*B + Y*B. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one pair must be shared by at least ceiling(465 / P) boxes. We need to find that there exists a pair shared by at least three boxes. If ceiling(465 / P) &gt;=3, then that would imply that some pair is shared by three boxes, which would give the three boxes we need. So, we need 465 / P &gt;= 2, i.e., P &lt;= 232.5, which would imply ceiling(465 / P) &gt;=3. But we need to compute P = R*Y + R*B + Y*B. Given that R + Y + B =30, we can express P = RY + RB + YB = (R + Y + B)^2 - (R^2 + Y^2 + B^2) / 2. Wait, no, actually:(R + Y + B)^2 = R^2 + Y^2 + B^2 + 2(RY + RB + YB). Therefore, RY + RB + YB = [(R + Y + B)^2 - (R^2 + Y^2 + B^2)] / 2. Since R + Y + B =30, then:RY + RB + YB = (900 - (R^2 + Y^2 + B^2)) / 2.To minimize P = RY + RB + YB, we need to maximize R^2 + Y^2 + B^2. The maximum of R^2 + Y^2 + B^2 occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the others as small as possible, due to the convexity of the square function. For example, if R=28, Y=1, B=1, then R^2 + Y^2 + B^2 =784 +1 +1=786.If R=15, Y=15, B=0, but B can&#39;t be 0. If B=1, R=15, Y=14, then R^2 + Y^2 + B^2=225 +196 +1=422.Alternatively, distributing the values more evenly. For example, if R=10, Y=10, B=10, then R^2 + Y^2 + B^2=300. Then P=(900 -300)/2=300.But we need to find the maximum possible R^2 + Y^2 + B^2. The maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible. For example, R=28, Y=1, B=1 gives R^2 + Y^2 + B^2=784+1+1=786. Then P=(900 -786)/2=57. Thus, the minimal P is 57. But 57 is the minimal P. So, depending on how R, Y, B are distributed, P can range from 57 up to 300. Wait, but if P is minimized when one variable is maximized, then minimal P is 57. But in that case, the number of pairs would be 57, and 465 /57≈8.15. Therefore, ceiling(465 /57)=9, so there must be a pair shared by at least 9 boxes. But the problem asks for three boxes. So, even in the minimal case, there are pairs shared by 9 boxes. But this seems overkill. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Wait, the minimal P is 57, which would lead to 465 /57≈8.15. Therefore, at least one pair is shared by 9 boxes. Therefore, there exist pairs (r, y), (r, b), or (y, b) that are shared by 9 boxes. Therefore, certainly, there are three boxes sharing the same pair. Therefore, in such a case, those three boxes would have the same two colors&#39; counts. But even if P is larger, say 300, then 465 /300≈1.55, so ceiling is 2. So, even in the maximum case, there exists a pair shared by at least 2 boxes. But the problem asks for three boxes. Wait, but in our case, since the minimal number of shared boxes per pair is 465 / P. If P is at maximum 300, then 465 /300≈1.55, so at least 2 boxes per pair. But the problem requires three boxes. So, this approach might not work. Wait, but if we can guarantee that there&#39;s a pair shared by at least three boxes, then we can get the required three boxes. So, we need 465 / P &gt;= 3 -1, i.e., 465 / P &gt;=2, so P &lt;=232.5. But if P&lt;=232.5, then ceiling(465 / P)&gt;=2. But to get three boxes, we need at least 3. So, we need 465 / P &gt;=3, so P &lt;=155. Then ceiling(465 /155)=3. But is P&lt;=155 possible? Let&#39;s compute. Earlier, when R=10,Y=10,B=10, then P=300. If we take R=28,Y=1,B=1, P=57. So, even if P=57, which is much less than 155, then 465 /57≈8.15, so some pair is shared by 9 boxes, which is more than three. But if P is, say, 155, then 465 /155=3. So, if P=155, then there must be a pair shared by at least 3 boxes. But how do we know if P&lt;=155?Wait, but P can be as low as 57 and as high as 300, depending on R,Y,B. So, unless we can prove that P&lt;=155, which I don&#39;t think is necessarily true. For example, if R=15,Y=15,B=0 (but B can&#39;t be 0). If B=1, R=15,Y=14, then P=15*14 +15*1 +14*1=210 +15 +14=239. Which is greater than 155. So, in such a case, P=239. Then 465 /239≈1.94, so ceiling is 2. Therefore, only two boxes per pair. But the problem states that it is possible to find three boxes where at least two colors have the same numbers. So, maybe not for all configurations, but given the specific conditions of the problem (i.e., that each number from 1 to 30 is a class size in some classification), which we&#39;ve used in part (1). Therefore, maybe the key is in part (1)&#39;s conclusion. If the sum of the number of classes is 30, then the number of triples (r, y, b) is R*Y*B. Since R + Y + B=30, by AM ≥ GM, R*Y*B &lt;= (30/3)^3=1000. But 155 &lt;1000, so possibly not. Alternatively, since each class size from 1 to 30 is used exactly once, then for each color, the classes correspond to a partition of the 155 boxes into class sizes that are exactly the numbers from 1 to 10, or something. Wait, no. Wait, in part (1), we concluded that the sum is 30 because the numbers 1 through 30 are each used once across all three color classifications, summing to 465=3*155. Therefore, each color&#39;s class sizes are a partition of 155 into distinct numbers from 1 to 30. But how does this affect the number of classes per color? For example, if a color has class sizes that are a subset of 1-30 summing to 155. The minimal number of classes for a color would be when using the largest numbers. For example, using the largest numbers: 30 + 29 + 28 + ... until we reach 155. Let&#39;s see: 30+29+28+27+26+25=165, which is over 155. So, 30+29+28+27+26=140, then need 15, which is 15. So, classes of sizes 30,29,28,27,26,15. That&#39;s 6 classes summing to 155. Similarly, another color could use the next largest numbers: 25,24,23,22,21,20,19, etc., but need to sum to 155. Let&#39;s see: 25+24+23+22+21+20=135, then need 20 more, but 19 is already used. Wait, but numbers are used only once. So if one color uses 30,29,28,27,26,15, another color uses 25,24,23,22,21,20,19,..., but need to sum to 155. This might get complex. But the key point is that each color&#39;s class sizes are distinct numbers from 1 to 30, and the sum is 155. However, the number of classes per color can vary. But since R + Y + B=30, each color must have a certain number of classes. But how does this relate to part (2)? Maybe using the classes structure. Suppose each color&#39;s classification has a certain number of classes. For example, red has classes with sizes 1,2,...,k summing to 155. Similarly for yellow and blue. But this is vague. Maybe another approach. Since each color&#39;s class sizes are distinct integers from 1 to 30, and each number is used exactly once. So, for example, red might have classes of sizes 1-10 summing to 155? Wait, sum from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. Let&#39;s see, if n=17: 17*18/2=153, close to 155. Then sum from 1 to 17 is 153, so adding 2 more would make 155, but 2 is already in the sum. So, can&#39;t have duplicate. So, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Alternatively, the class sizes for each color are a set of distinct integers summing to 155. Since the numbers are distinct and from 1 to 30, each color&#39;s class sizes are a subset of 1-30, summing to 155. But how does this help with part (2)? Maybe consider that each color has a certain number of classes, say R, Y, B, and R + Y + B=30. Then, the number of possible triples (r, y, b) is R*Y*B. But there are 155 boxes. If R*Y*B &lt;155, then by pigeonhole principle, some triples must repeat. But since we have R + Y + B=30, the product R*Y*B is maximized when R=Y=B=10, giving 1000, which is much larger than 155. Therefore, the pigeonhole principle doesn&#39;t directly apply here. Alternatively, consider that for each box, it has a certain number of red, yellow, blue balls. For each box, the red number is in one of R classes, yellow in Y, blue in B. So, each box is identified by a triple (r, y, b). The total number of possible triples is R*Y*B. If R*Y*B &gt;=155, which it is (since up to 1000), then it&#39;s possible that all triples are unique. However, the problem states that it&#39;s possible to find three boxes where at least two colors have the same number. So, even if all triples are unique, there might still be three boxes that have, say, the same red and yellow numbers. But if all triples are unique, then no two boxes share the same triple. But two boxes could share a pair, like same red and yellow, but different blue. But how to ensure three boxes share two colors?Alternatively, think of it as a combinatorial cube. The dimensions are R, Y, B. We have 155 points in this cube. We need to find three points that lie on a line along two dimensions, i.e., share two coordinates. But how to guarantee that? Maybe using the Erdős–Szemerédi theorem or similar combinatorial results, but I might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, think of the classes for each color. For red, there are R classes. Each class has a distinct number of red balls, and the number of boxes in each red class is the size of the class (from 1 to 30). Similarly for yellow and blue. Given that each class size from 1 to 30 is used exactly once, so each number from 1 to 30 is a class size in exactly one color. Therefore, for example, if a class size of 5 is used in red, then there are 5 boxes with a certain number of red balls. Now, considering the classes across all three colors, each class size is unique to a color. Now, to find three boxes where two of their colors have the same number. For example, three boxes that are in the same red class and the same yellow class. Since each red class has size equal to some number from 1 to 30, and each yellow class also has size from 1 to 30. But since each class size is used exactly once, the red class sizes and yellow class sizes are distinct. So, if there&#39;s a red class of size 5 and a yellow class of size 5, but since each number is used once, this is not possible. Wait, in part (1), we concluded that each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across all three colors. Therefore, for example, if there&#39;s a red class of size 5, then there cannot be a yellow or blue class of size 5. Therefore, class sizes are unique per color. Therefore, for red, yellow, blue, their class sizes are distinct subsets of 1-30, with no overlaps. Therefore, for example, red classes have sizes {1,2,3}, yellow {4,5,6}, blue {7,...30}, etc. Therefore, if a red class has size 5, then yellow and blue cannot have any class of size 5. Therefore, considering two colors, say red and yellow, their class sizes are disjoint. So, the class sizes for red are a subset S_r ⊂ {1,...,30}, class sizes for yellow S_y ⊂ {1,...,30}, and blue S_b ⊂ {1,...,30}, with S_r ∪ S_y ∪ S_b = {1,...,30}, and S_r, S_y, S_b pairwise disjoint. Now, the number of red classes is |S_r| = R, yellow |S_y|=Y, blue |S_b|=B, and R + Y + B=30. Each red class corresponds to a group of boxes with a unique number of red balls, and the size of the class is the number of boxes in that group. Similarly for yellow and blue. Now, suppose we consider the Cartesian product of red classes and yellow classes. Each combination of a red class and a yellow class defines a group of boxes that have that particular number of red balls and that particular number of yellow balls. The number of such groups is R * Y. The size of each such group is the number of boxes that have both that red class and yellow class. However, since each box is in exactly one red class, one yellow class, and one blue class, the size of each (red, yellow) group is at most the size of the corresponding blue classes. But since the blue class sizes are unique numbers from 1 to 30, and they are all distinct from red and yellow class sizes. Wait, but if we have a (red class size, yellow class size) pair, then the number of boxes in that combination is the number of blue classes that have size equal to the number of boxes in that (red, yellow) group. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, think of each (red, yellow) pair as potentially corresponding to multiple boxes, each with different blue classes. However, since blue class sizes are unique and from 1 to 30, and the number of boxes in each blue class is its size. But this line of reasoning might not be fruitful. Let me try another approach. Given that all class sizes are distinct across the three colors, we can consider that for any two colors, their class sizes are distinct. Therefore, for example, if a red class has size 5, there is no yellow or blue class of size 5. Therefore, for any two colors, say red and yellow, their class sizes are completely distinct. Therefore, the intersection of class sizes between red and yellow is empty. Now, consider the classes of red and yellow. For red, the class sizes are some subset S_r of 1-30, and for yellow, S_y, which is disjoint from S_r. The number of red classes is R = |S_r|, yellow is Y = |S_y|. Now, the total number of boxes is 155, which is the sum of the red class sizes, which is also the sum of the yellow class sizes, and the sum of the blue class sizes. Therefore, sum(S_r) = sum(S_y) = sum(S_b) = 155. But since S_r, S_y, S_b are disjoint subsets of 1-30, each summing to 155, and their union is 1-30. Therefore, we have three disjoint subsets S_r, S_y, S_b of {1, ..., 30}, each summing to 155, and their union is the entire set. This is a known problem in mathematics called the &quot;3-way equal sum partition&quot; problem. It&#39;s a special case where the total sum is 3*155=465, which is the sum from 1 to 30. But how does this help with part (2)? Perhaps we can use the fact that each color&#39;s class sizes are unique and cover the entire set 1-30. Suppose we consider the red classes. Each red class has a size from S_r. Since S_r is a subset of 1-30 summing to 155, and the same for S_y and S_b. Now, each red class size corresponds to a number of boxes with a certain number of red balls. Similarly for yellow and blue. The problem wants three boxes where at least two colors have the same number. That is, in these three boxes, two of the colors have the same count. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Since each class size from 1 to 30 is used exactly once, the largest class size is 30. Therefore, there exists a color (say, red) that has a class of size 30. That means 30 boxes have the same number of red balls. Similarly, there&#39;s a class of size 29, which could be in another color, say yellow, so 29 boxes have the same number of yellow balls. Now, in the red class of size 30, all these 30 boxes have the same number of red balls, but their yellow and blue counts can vary. However, since there are only 155 boxes, and 30 of them are in this red class, we can consider the intersection of this red class with the other color classes. Similarly, the yellow class of size 29 has 29 boxes with the same yellow count. The intersection of the red class (size 30) and yellow class (size 29) would be at least 30 + 29 -155= -96, which is not useful. But by the pigeonhole principle, the number of boxes in the intersection of the red class of size 30 and any yellow class must be at least 30 + 29 -155= -96, which isn&#39;t helpful. Alternatively, consider that in the red class of size 30, each box has a unique combination of yellow and blue classes. Since yellow has class sizes from S_y (distinct from S_r), and blue from S_b. But if the red class has 30 boxes, each with the same red count, but different yellow and/or blue counts. The number of possible distinct yellow classes is Y, and blue classes is B. If Y * B &gt;=30, then the 30 boxes can be distinct. But since Y + B=30 - R. If R is say 1 (if the red classification has only one class of size 30), then Y + B=29. The maximum Y * B in that case is when Y=14, B=15, product=210. 210 &gt;=30, so yes, the 30 boxes can have distinct yellow and blue classes. Therefore, it&#39;s possible that all 30 boxes in the red class have distinct yellow and blue classes. But the problem states that it&#39;s possible to find three boxes where at least two colors have the same number. So, even if the 30 red boxes are all different in yellow and blue, there might still be three boxes elsewhere that satisfy the condition. But maybe using the fact that there are classes of sizes 1. For example, there is a class (in some color) with only one box. Similarly, classes of size 2, etc. Suppose there is a blue class of size 1. That single box has a unique number of blue balls. However, its red and yellow counts are shared with other boxes. But this is getting too vague. Maybe another approach. Consider that each color&#39;s classes have sizes that are all distinct numbers from 1 to 30. Therefore, in each color, there is one class of size 1, one of size 2, up to size 30, but partitioned among the three colors. But no, because the classes are partitioned among three colors, each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once in one color. Therefore, for example, red might have classes of sizes {1, 3, 5,...}, yellow {2,4,6,...}, blue {7,8,...30}. But how does this help? The key idea is that with classes of size 1, 2, etc., there must be overlaps in the counts across different colors. Wait, maybe think in terms of the birthday paradox. If we have 155 boxes, each with a triple (r, y, b), and we need three boxes where two of their coordinates are the same. But the number of possible pairs (r, y), (r, b), (y, b) is RY + RB + YB. As before, this is P. If P &lt; 155*2/3, then by the pigeonhole principle, some pair must be shared by three boxes. But I need to check the exact calculation. Alternatively, the total number of ordered pairs (considering all three types) is 3*155=465, as before. The number of distinct pairs is P=RY + RB + YB. To have three boxes sharing the same pair, we need at least one pair to have three boxes. The average number of boxes per pair is 465 / P. If 465 / P &gt;= 3, then some pair has at least three boxes. Therefore, if P &lt;=155, then 465 /155=3. So, if P &lt;=155, then there must exist a pair shared by at least three boxes. But is P &lt;=155 possible? Given R + Y + B=30, we need to see if RY + RB + YB &lt;=155. Let’s attempt to minimize P. As before, P = RY + RB + YB. Using the identity: (R + Y + B)^2 = R^2 + Y^2 + B^2 + 2(RY + RB + YB)Therefore, RY + RB + YB = [ (R + Y + B)^2 - (R^2 + Y^2 + B^2) ] / 2Since R + Y + B =30,RY + RB + YB = (900 - (R^2 + Y^2 + B^2)) /2To minimize P, we need to maximize R^2 + Y^2 + B^2.The maximum of R^2 + Y^2 + B^2 occurs when one variable is as large as possible. For example, let’s set R=28, Y=1, B=1. Then,R^2 + Y^2 + B^2=784 +1 +1=786Thus,RY + RB + YB=(900 -786)/2=57So P=57. If R=27, Y=2, B=1,R^2 + Y^2 + B^2=729 +4 +1=734P=(900-734)/2=83Similarly, R=26, Y=3, B=1:26² +3² +1=676 +9 +1=686P=(900-686)/2=107Continuing this, R=25, Y=4, B=1:25² +16 +1=625 +16 +1=642P=(900-642)/2=129Next, R=24, Y=5, B=1:24²=576 +25 +1=602P=(900-602)/2=149Then R=23, Y=6, B=1:23²=529 +36 +1=566P=(900-566)/2=167Which exceeds 155. Therefore, the maximal R^2 + Y^2 + B^2 for which P&lt;=155 is when R=24, Y=5, B=1, giving P=149. Wait, 149 is less than 155. So, if we have R=24, Y=5, B=1, then P=149. Then 465 /149≈3.12, so there must be a pair shared by at least 4 boxes. Wait, but in this case, since P=149, ceiling(465 /149)=4. Therefore, there is a pair shared by at least 4 boxes, which certainly includes three boxes. Therefore, in this case, we can find three boxes sharing the same pair, i.e., two colors with the same counts. However, this is specific to the case where P=149. But according to the problem&#39;s conditions, the class sizes must cover 1-30. In the case where R=24, Y=5, B=1, the class sizes for red would be 24 distinct numbers from 1-30, yellow 5 distinct numbers, and blue 1 number. But since all numbers from 1-30 must be used, the blue class size would be 1 number, say 30. Then the red class sizes would be 24 numbers excluding 30 and the yellow&#39;s 5 numbers. Similarly, yellow&#39;s class sizes would be 5 numbers, not overlapping with red or blue. But in this case, blue has a class size of 30 (if we assign the largest number to blue), but blue&#39;s sum must be 155. If blue has a class size of 30, but 30≠155. Wait, no. The class sizes are the number of boxes in each class. Wait, if blue has a class size of 30, that means 30 boxes have the same number of blue balls. But the sum of the class sizes for blue must be 155. Therefore, blue can&#39;t have just one class of size 30. It must have multiple classes summing to 155. Ah, here&#39;s the confusion. Previously, I thought that each color&#39;s class sizes are a subset of 1-30, but in reality, the class sizes are the number of boxes in each class, and each class size is a number from 1-30, with each number from 1-30 appearing exactly once across all three colors. Therefore, in the case where blue has a class size of 30, that would mean 30 boxes have the same number of blue balls. Then, the sum of blue&#39;s class sizes must be 155. So, if blue has a class of 30, it needs more classes to sum to 155. For example, 30 + 29 + 28 + ... But 30+29+28+27+26=140, then 15 needed, but 15 is already used in another color. Wait, but the problem states that all numbers from 1-30 are used exactly once as class sizes in the three colors. Therefore, each number from 1-30 is a class size in exactly one color. Therefore, if blue has a class size of 30, it cannot have any other class sizes. Because 30 alone sums to 30, which is much less than 155. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the previous approach where one color has class sizes with large numbers is invalid, because the sum of class sizes for each color must be 155. Therefore, each color&#39;s class sizes must sum to 155, and the numbers from 1-30 are each used exactly once across all three colors. Therefore, for each color, we need to partition 155 into distinct numbers from 1-30, with each number used exactly once across all three colors. This complicates things. For example, one color&#39;s class sizes could be {30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25}, but sum =30+29+28+27+26+25=165, which is over 155. So, we need to find a subset of numbers from 1-30 that sum to 155, with each number used at most once. This is the subset sum problem. For example, what&#39;s the maximum number of classes a color can have? The minimal sum for maximum classes is 1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2 &lt;=155. For n=17: 17*18/2=153. n=18:171. So, up to 17 classes summing to 153, needing an additional 2. But can&#39;t have duplicate. Therefore, maybe replace 17 with 19? Wait, not sure. But regardless, the exact partitioning is complex. However, the key insight for part (2) is that given each color must have class sizes that sum to 155 using distinct numbers from 1-30, and the sum of class sizes across all colors is 465=3*155. But how does this guarantee the existence of three boxes with two colors the same? Perhaps consider the following: Each color&#39;s classification corresponds to a set of class sizes (numbers from 1-30), summing to 155. The number of classes per color is the number of elements in that set. Since R + Y + B=30, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color has at least 10 classes. Because 30/3=10. Suppose red has at least 10 classes. Each class in red has a distinct number of red balls, and the class sizes are distinct numbers from 1-30. But the class sizes for red are distinct numbers that sum to 155. If red has 10 classes, the minimal sum is 1+2+...+10=55, which is much less than 155. The maximal sum with 10 classes would be 21+22+...+30=255, which is larger than 155. So, red&#39;s class sizes would be a subset of 10 distinct numbers from 1-30 summing to 155. But even with 10 classes, the minimal sum is 55, so there&#39;s flexibility. However, the key is that if a color has many classes, say red has R classes, then there are R different red ball counts. Each box must have one of these R red counts. Similarly for yellow and blue. Now, if a color has many classes, the number of possible values for that color is high, leading to more combinations. However, with 155 boxes, if two colors have many classes, the third must have fewer. But how does this lead to three boxes with two colors the same? Perhaps using the following argument: Consider the three classifications with R, Y, B classes respectively, R + Y + B=30. If each classification&#39;s classes are assigned to the boxes, then each box has a red class, yellow class, and blue class. Suppose we fix two colors, say red and yellow. The number of possible pairs (red class, yellow class) is R * Y. For each pair, the number of boxes with that pair is the number of blue classes that have a size equal to the number of boxes in that pair. But since blue class sizes are distinct and from 1-30, and each blue class size is used exactly once, the number of boxes in each (red, yellow) pair must correspond to a blue class size. Therefore, the number of boxes in each (red, yellow) pair must be a unique number from 1-30 not used in red or yellow class sizes. But since R + Y + B=30, and blue has B classes, the number of (red, yellow) pairs is R * Y. For each of these pairs, there must be a unique blue class size assigned to them. Therefore, R * Y &lt;= B. But B=30 - R - Y. Therefore, R * Y &lt;=30 - R - Y. This is a key inequality. Similarly, we can write:R * Y + R + Y &lt;=30Which is equivalent to (R +1)(Y +1) &lt;=31Since (R +1)(Y +1)=R Y + R + Y +1 &lt;=31 +1=32Wait, not sure. Let&#39;s check:From R * Y &lt;=30 - R - Y,Add R + Y to both sides:R * Y + R + Y &lt;=30Factor the left side:R * Y + R + Y = R(Y +1) + Y = (R +1)(Y +1) -1Therefore,(R +1)(Y +1) -1 &lt;=30So,(R +1)(Y +1) &lt;=31Since R and Y are positive integers.So, (R +1)(Y +1) &lt;=31Possible integer pairs (R +1, Y +1) are such that their product &lt;=31. Possible pairs:(1,31), but R +1 &lt;=30(2,15), (3,10), (5,6), etc. But since R + Y + B=30, and B=30 - R - Y. This implies that for the pair (R +1, Y +1), their product is &lt;=31, so R and Y are small. For example, if R +1=5, Y +1=6, then R=4, Y=5. Product 5*6=30&lt;=31. Then B=30 -4 -5=21. Check if R * Y=4*5=20 &lt;= B=21. Yes, 20&lt;=21. Alternatively, R +1=6, Y +1=5. Same result. Another example, R +1=3, Y +1=10: R=2, Y=9. B=30 -2 -9=19. R * Y=2*9=18 &lt;=19. Yes. Similarly, R +1=2, Y +1=15: R=1, Y=14. B=30 -1 -14=15. R * Y=14&lt;=15. Yes. Therefore, the maximum possible R * Y is when R +1 and Y +1 are as close as possible to sqrt(31)=5.56. So, 5*6=30, which is the maximum. Therefore, R * Y &lt;=20, with R=4, Y=5. But if R * Y &lt;=20, and B=21, then P=RY + RB + YB=20 +4*21 +5*21=20 +84 +105=209. Then 465 /209≈2.22, so there must be a pair shared by at least 3 boxes. Therefore, in this case, there exists a pair shared by at least 3 boxes. Therefore, three boxes with the same red and yellow class, i.e., same number of red and yellow balls. Therefore, this satisfies part (2). But this is under the assumption that R * Y &lt;= B, derived from the class size uniqueness. But since in the problem&#39;s setup, each blue class size is unique and corresponds to the number of boxes in a (red, yellow) pair, and each blue class size is a distinct number from 1-30 not used in red or yellow. Therefore, the number of (red, yellow) pairs must be &lt;= the number of available blue class sizes, which is B=30 - R - Y. Therefore, R * Y &lt;=30 - R - Y, leading to (R +1)(Y +1) &lt;=31. This limits R and Y to small values, and thus R * Y is small, leading to a higher number of overlaps in pairs. Therefore, in all cases, since R * Y &lt;=30 - R - Y, and hence R * Y + R + Y &lt;=30, and therefore, the total number of pairs P=RY + RB + YB=RY + R(30 - R - Y) + Y(30 - R - Y)=RY +30R - R^2 - RY +30Y - RY - Y^2=30R +30Y - R^2 - Y^2 - RY. But this is complicated. However, the key takeaway is that due to the class size uniqueness constraint, the number of pairs is limited, leading to a lower P, and thus a higher average number of boxes per pair, ensuring that some pair has at least three boxes. Therefore, in all cases, there must exist at least one pair shared by three boxes, which answers part (2). Final Answer(1) boxed{30}(2) By the pigeonhole principle and the constraints on class sizes, there must exist three boxes sharing the same pair of classes for at least two colors, ensuring the numbers of those two colors are the same.&lt;/think&gt;Given 155 boxes containing red, yellow, and blue balls, we need to solve two parts based on the classification of boxes by the number of balls of each color. Part (1)The problem states that all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification. Each classification (red, yellow, blue) partitions the 155 boxes into classes where each class size is a distinct number from 1 to 30. The sum of the class sizes for each color must be 155. Since the sum of numbers from 1 to 30 is 465, which is exactly 3 times 155, each number from 1 to 30 must be used exactly once across the three classifications. Therefore, the total number of classes (distinct numbers) across all three classifications is 30. Answer (1): boxed{30} Part (2)To show that there exist three boxes where at least two colors have the same number of balls, we use the pigeonhole principle. Each box can be represented as a triple (r, y, b) where r, y, b are the number of balls of each color. The total number of pairs (r, y), (r, b), and (y, b) across all boxes is 465. Given the constraints on class sizes and the distinct usage of numbers from 1 to 30, the number of distinct pairs is limited. By the pigeonhole principle, some pair must be shared by at least three boxes, ensuring two colors have the same number in those boxes.Answer (2): By the pigeonhole principle and the constraints on class sizes, there must exist three boxes sharing the same pair of classes for at least two colors, ensuring the numbers of those two colors are the same.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand what&#39;s being asked here. We have 155 boxes, each containing red, yellow, and blue balls. The classification method is such that for each color (red, yellow, blue), boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class. So, for example, all boxes with exactly 5 red balls would be in the same class for the red classification. The problem states that for each color&#39;s classification, the number of boxes in each class is every natural number from 1 to 30. That means for each color, there are classes with 1 box, 2 boxes, ..., up to 30 boxes. But wait, hold on. If all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification, does that mean that each color&#39;s classification has exactly 30 classes, each corresponding to a different number of boxes from 1 to 30? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.The problem says: &quot;If all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification.&quot; So for each classification (red, yellow, blue), when you look at the sizes of the classes (i.e., how many boxes are in each class), those sizes are exactly the numbers 1 through 30. That is, for each color, there&#39;s a class with 1 box, a class with 2 boxes, ..., up to a class with 30 boxes. So each classification (red, yellow, blue) must have exactly 30 classes, right? Because the sizes go from 1 to 30. Therefore, each classification has 30 classes. So the total number of classes across all three classifications would be 30 * 3 = 90. But wait, the first question is asking for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. If each classification has 30 classes, then the sum would be 90. But let me check if I interpreted that correctly.Wait, hold on. Let me parse the problem statement again: &quot;If all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification.&quot; So for each classification (each color), the number of boxes in each class are the numbers 1 through 30. That is, when you group boxes by the number of balls of a particular color, each group (class) has a unique number of boxes, and these numbers are exactly 1, 2, ..., 30. Therefore, for each color, there are 30 classes, each of size 1 to 30. Therefore, each color&#39;s classification has 30 classes. Therefore, three classifications (red, yellow, blue) would have 30 * 3 = 90 classes in total. So part (1) would be 90. But before I settle on that answer, let me make sure.Wait, but the total number of boxes is 155. If each classification (for each color) requires that there are classes of sizes 1 through 30, then the total number of boxes for each color would be the sum from 1 to 30, which is (30*31)/2 = 465. But we have only 155 boxes. That&#39;s a contradiction. Therefore, my initial interpretation must be wrong. Hmm, okay. So there&#39;s a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.&quot;For each color, boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class. If all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification, then...&quot; Wait, maybe it&#39;s saying that for each classification (each color), the sizes of the classes (i.e., the number of boxes in each class) are all the natural numbers from 1 to 30. That would mean that for each color, when you group the boxes by the number of balls of that color, you have classes where the size of the class (number of boxes in that class) is each number from 1 to 30. So for red, there is a class with 1 box, a class with 2 boxes, ..., up to a class with 30 boxes. Similarly for yellow and blue. But if that&#39;s the case, then the total number of boxes for each color would be the sum from 1 to 30, which is 465, but we have only 155 boxes. That&#39;s impossible. Therefore, my interpretation is definitely wrong. So maybe the problem is not saying that for each color, all class sizes from 1 to 30 are present, but rather that across all three classifications, every number from 1 to 30 is the size of some class in at least one of the classifications. That is, when you look at the class sizes for red, yellow, and blue, every number from 1 to 30 appears at least once in some color&#39;s class. For example, maybe the red classification has classes with sizes 1, 2, ..., 10, the yellow has 11, ..., 20, and blue has 21, ..., 30. Then all numbers 1-30 are covered. But that would mean each color&#39;s classification has 10 classes, so total classes would be 30. But the problem says &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification.&quot; So each number from 1 to 30 must be the size of at least one class in each classification? Wait, no. The problem says &quot;for each color, boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class. If all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification, then...&quot;Wait, perhaps &quot;classification&quot; here refers to each color&#39;s grouping. So for each color&#39;s classification (red, yellow, blue), the sizes of the classes (number of boxes in each class) include every natural number from 1 to 30. That is, for each color, when you group the boxes by the number of balls of that color, you end up with classes where the sizes of these classes are exactly 1, 2, ..., 30. But as before, that would require 465 boxes per color, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps &quot;the number of boxes in some class of a classification&quot; refers to that across all three classifications, each number from 1 to 30 appears as a class size in at least one of the three classifications.That is, for each number k from 1 to 30, there exists at least one class (in red, yellow, or blue) that has exactly k boxes. So the union of class sizes across all three colors is exactly the set {1, 2, ..., 30}. Then, the problem is asking in part (1) for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. Each classification (red, yellow, blue) can have some number of classes, and the union of their class sizes is {1, 2, ..., 30}. Then, the total number of classes would be the number of distinct class sizes in each color summed over the three colors. But since the problem states that &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification,&quot; meaning each number from 1 to 30 is covered by at least one class in one of the classifications, but there could be overlaps. For example, a class size of 5 could be present in both red and yellow classifications.However, the problem is asking for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. So we need to find the total number of classes across red, yellow, and blue, where each classification can have overlapping class sizes. But the key is that all numbers from 1 to 30 must be represented in at least one of the classifications. However, since each color&#39;s classes are determined by grouping boxes with the same number of balls of that color, the class sizes for each color are the counts of how many boxes have a particular number of that color. Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as follows: For each color, when you group the boxes by the number of balls of that color, the sizes of these groups (classes) are the numbers from 1 to 30. But since each box has all three colors, the same box is counted in all three color classifications. However, the class size for a color is the number of boxes with a specific number of that color. Therefore, if a box has, say, 5 red balls, 3 yellow balls, and 7 blue balls, it is in the class of 5 red balls, the class of 3 yellow balls, and the class of 7 blue balls. The size of each class is the number of boxes in that class. Therefore, the problem says that for each color, the class sizes (i.e., the number of boxes in each class for that color) include all natural numbers from 1 to 30. So for red, the number of boxes with r red balls for some r is 1, 2, ..., 30. Similarly for yellow and blue. But the same box is part of a red class, a yellow class, and a blue class. Therefore, the total number of boxes is 155, which is much less than the sum of class sizes for any one color (which would be 465). Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, my interpretation is definitely wrong. Wait, maybe the problem is saying that in each classification (each color), the number of classes is a natural number from 1 to 30. But that doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, the original problem is in Chinese, and the translation might be tricky. Let me parse the problem statement again:&quot;For 155 boxes containing red, yellow, and blue balls, there are three classification methods: for each color, boxes with the same number of balls of that color are grouped into one class. If all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification, then, (1) What is the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications? (2) Explain that it is possible to find three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot;So, the key is: when you classify the boxes by the number of red balls, you get classes; similarly for yellow and blue. For each classification (each color), the sizes of these classes (i.e., how many boxes are in each class) include all natural numbers from 1 to 30. That is, for red, there is a class with 1 box, a class with 2 boxes, ..., up to a class with 30 boxes. Similarly, for yellow and blue. But if that were the case, then the total number of boxes required for red alone would be 1+2+...+30 = 465, which is way more than 155. Therefore, this must not be the correct interpretation.Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that across all three classifications (red, yellow, blue), the sizes of the classes (number of boxes in each class) cover all natural numbers from 1 to 30. That is, for each number k from 1 to 30, there is at least one class (in red, yellow, or blue) that has exactly k boxes. Therefore, the union of class sizes across all three colors is {1, 2, ..., 30}. Then, the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications would be the total number of distinct class sizes in each color. Wait, but class sizes can overlap between colors. For example, red could have a class of size 5, yellow could also have a class of size 5, and blue could have a class of size 5. So the same class size can be present in multiple colors. However, the problem states that all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are represented as class sizes in some classification. That is, for each k from 1 to 30, at least one of the three colors has a class of size k. Therefore, to cover all 30 numbers, the minimal number of classes across all three classifications would be 30 (if each number is covered exactly once in one of the colors). But since the problem is asking for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications, which would be the number of classes in red plus the number in yellow plus the number in blue.However, in reality, each color&#39;s classification is determined by how many boxes have each number of balls of that color. For example, for red, if there are m different quantities of red balls among the boxes, then the red classification has m classes. Similarly for yellow and blue. The problem states that the sizes of these classes (i.e., the number of boxes in each class) are exactly the numbers from 1 to 30. Wait, but again, this seems conflicting with the total number of boxes. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that for each classification (each color), the number of boxes in each class can be any natural number from 1 to 30. That is, each class size is between 1 and 30, but not necessarily that all numbers from 1 to 30 are present. But the problem says &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification.&quot; So it&#39;s not that the sizes are within that range, but that each number in that range is the size of some class in some classification. Therefore, across the three classifications, every number from 1 to 30 is used as a class size in at least one of the classifications. Therefore, for example, the red classification might have classes of sizes 1, 2, ..., 15, the yellow might have 16, ..., 25, and blue might have 26, ..., 30. Then, all numbers from 1 to 30 are covered. In this case, the total number of classes would be 15 + 10 + 5 = 30. But the problem is asking for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. However, this is just an example; the actual distribution could be different, but the key is that each number from 1 to 30 must be a class size in at least one classification. Therefore, the minimal total number of classes would be 30, but if there is overlap (i.e., a class size appearing in more than one classification), the total number of classes would be more than 30. However, the problem states &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification.&quot; It doesn&#39;t say &quot;in each classification,&quot; so overlapping is allowed. Therefore, the total number of classes would be at least 30, but since each classification (red, yellow, blue) can have overlapping sizes, the total could be more. However, the problem asks for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. How can we determine that?Wait, but each classification (each color) partitions the 155 boxes into classes where each class has boxes with the same number of that color. Therefore, for each color, the number of classes is equal to the number of distinct counts of that color in the boxes. For example, if there are 10 different quantities of red balls among the 155 boxes, then the red classification has 10 classes. Similarly for yellow and blue. However, the problem states that for each classification, the sizes of the classes (i.e., the number of boxes in each class) include all natural numbers from 1 to 30. Wait, but if for each classification, the class sizes are exactly the numbers 1 to 30, then each classification must have 30 classes (one of each size), but that would require 465 boxes per color, which is impossible. Therefore, this can&#39;t be. So perhaps the problem is that across all three classifications, every number from 1 to 30 is a class size in at least one of the classifications. That is, for each k from 1 to 30, there exists a color (red, yellow, or blue) such that there is a class of size k in that color&#39;s classification. Therefore, the union of all class sizes across all three colors is {1, 2, ..., 30}. In that case, the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications would be the total number of distinct class sizes across all three, considering overlaps. For example, if a class size of 5 appears in all three colors, then that contributes 3 to the total. But since the problem states that all numbers from 1 to 30 must appear in at least one classification, the minimal total number of classes would be 30 (if each number appears in exactly one classification). However, the actual total could be more if some numbers appear in multiple classifications. But how does the number of boxes factor into this? The total number of boxes is 155. Each box is in exactly one class per classification. So for each color, the sum of the class sizes equals 155. Therefore, for each color, the sum of class sizes (which are numbers between 1 and 30) must equal 155. However, if for each color, the class sizes are some numbers (not necessarily all from 1 to 30), but across all three colors, every number from 1 to 30 is used as a class size in at least one color. So we have three color classifications (red, yellow, blue), each with some number of classes. For each color, the sum of the class sizes is 155. Moreover, every number from 1 to 30 is a class size in at least one of the three colors. Now, the question (1) is asking for the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications. Let&#39;s denote the number of classes in red, yellow, blue as R, Y, B respectively. We need to find R + Y + B. To find this, we need to note that for each color, the sum of its class sizes is 155. Therefore, for red: sum_{i=1}^{R} s_i^{(red)} = 155, where each s_i^{(red)} is the size of a class in red&#39;s classification, and similarly for yellow and blue. But across all three colors, every integer from 1 to 30 is used as a class size in at least one color. Our goal is to minimize R + Y + B, but since the problem doesn&#39;t specify that we need to minimize or maximize, it&#39;s likely that there&#39;s a unique answer determined by the constraints. However, the problem states that &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification,&quot; so we need to cover all 30 numbers. But how does this relate to the sum R + Y + B? Each class size from 1 to 30 must be used at least once across the three colors. Therefore, the minimal total number of classes is 30 (if each number is used exactly once). However, each color&#39;s sum of class sizes is 155. So we need to partition the numbers 1 to 30 into three groups (red, yellow, blue) such that each group&#39;s sum is 155. But the sum of numbers from 1 to 30 is (30)(31)/2 = 465. If we need to partition these numbers into three groups, each summing to 155, but 465 divided by 3 is 155. Therefore, it&#39;s possible that each color&#39;s class sizes are exactly the numbers 1 to 30, but partitioned into three groups each summing to 155. Wait, but 465 divided by 3 is indeed 155. So if we can partition the numbers 1 to 30 into three disjoint subsets, each summing to 155, then each color&#39;s classification would consist of the classes in that subset, and the total number of classes would be 30 (since the numbers 1-30 are split into three subsets). But wait, if we partition the numbers 1-30 into three subsets, each subset would have 10 numbers? Wait, 30 divided by 3 is 10. But each subset needs to sum to 155. Let&#39;s check: the sum of numbers 1 to 30 is 465, so each third would be 155. Therefore, if we can partition 1-30 into three groups of 10 numbers each, each group summing to 155, then each color&#39;s classification would have 10 classes, totaling 30 classes in sum. Therefore, the answer to part (1) would be 30. But wait, the sum of three subsets each with 10 numbers would give total classes as 10+10+10=30. But is such a partition possible? Let&#39;s check. The numbers 1 to 30 can be partitioned into three groups with equal sums. Since 465 is divisible by 3, it&#39;s possible. For example, we can construct three groups each summing to 155. However, constructing such a partition is non-trivial, but the problem doesn&#39;t require us to show how, just to answer the sum. So if each color&#39;s classification consists of 10 classes with sizes summing to 155, then R + Y + B = 30. However, the problem statement says &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification,&quot; which suggests that each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across the three classifications. If that&#39;s the case, then each number is used in exactly one classification, hence total classes are 30. Therefore, the answer to (1) is 30. But I need to verify this.But wait, another way: each class size from 1 to 30 must be present in at least one classification, but they can be present in more than one. However, if the problem requires that all numbers from 1 to 30 are present in each classification, which was the initial interpretation, but that led to a contradiction. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that each number from 1 to 30 is present in at least one classification. Therefore, the minimal total number of classes is 30, but the actual total could be more if some numbers are repeated across classifications. However, the problem states &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify &quot;exactly&quot; or &quot;at least,&quot; so it&#39;s likely that each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across the three classifications. Because if they could be used multiple times, the total number of boxes would exceed 155. For example, if the number 1 is used in all three classifications, that would require 1+1+1=3 boxes, but since each box is counted in all three classifications, we can&#39;t have overlapping class sizes like that. Wait, actually, a single box is part of three different classes (one for each color). Therefore, the same box contributes to the class size of its red count, yellow count, and blue count. Therefore, if there&#39;s a class of size 1 in red, that means there&#39;s exactly one box with a certain number of red balls. Similarly, a class of size 1 in yellow means exactly one box with a certain number of yellow balls. These could be the same box or different boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes is 155, and each box is in three classes (one for each color). The sum of the class sizes for each color is 155. If we have to cover all numbers from 1 to 30 as class sizes across the three colors, but each class size can be in any color. So, for example, if we use class size 1 in red, class size 2 in yellow, etc., but need to distribute all 30 numbers across the three colors. However, each color&#39;s sum of class sizes must be 155. So if we assign numbers 1-30 to the three colors such that the sum for each color is 155, then the total number of classes per color would be the number of numbers assigned to that color, and the sum of classes would be 30. But this is only possible if the numbers 1-30 can be partitioned into three groups, each summing to 155. Since the total sum is 465, and 465/3 = 155, this is possible. Therefore, if we can partition the numbers 1-30 into three disjoint subsets, each summing to 155, then each subset corresponds to a color&#39;s class sizes, and each color would have 10 classes (since 30 numbers divided into three groups). Wait, 30 numbers divided into three groups would be 10 numbers each. But 10 numbers summing to 155? Let&#39;s check. For example, the sum of numbers 1 to 10 is 55, which is much less than 155. The sum of numbers 21 to 30 is 255, which is more than 155. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work. So perhaps the partitions are not equal in size. Wait, no. If we need to partition the numbers 1 to 30 into three subsets, each summing to 155, the number of elements in each subset can vary. For example, one subset might have more large numbers and fewer small numbers to reach the sum. However, constructing such a partition is non-trivial, but the problem doesn&#39;t require us to construct it, just to reason about the sum of the number of classes. Assuming that such a partition exists, then each color&#39;s classification would have a certain number of classes (each class size being a unique number from 1 to 30), and the total number of classes across all three colors would be 30, since all numbers from 1 to 30 are used exactly once. Therefore, the answer to part (1) would be 30. But wait, this contradicts the initial thought where each color would need 30 classes. However, in reality, if each color&#39;s class sizes are a subset of 1-30, and all numbers are used across the three colors, then the total number of classes is 30. However, if some numbers are used in multiple colors, then the total number of classes would be more than 30. But the problem states that &quot;all natural numbers from 1 to 30 are the number of boxes in some class of a classification,&quot; meaning they need to appear at least once, but can appear multiple times. But since the sum of class sizes for each color is 155, and the total sum of numbers 1-30 is 465, if we use each number exactly once, the total sum would be 465, but we need three times 155, which is 465. Therefore, it&#39;s possible only if each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across the three classifications. That is, each number is used in exactly one color&#39;s classification. Therefore, the total number of classes is 30, and each color&#39;s classification has a subset of the numbers 1-30, with their sum being 155. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is 30. But let me verify this with an example. Suppose we have three color classifications: red, yellow, blue. We need to assign each number from 1 to 30 to one of the three colors such that the sum for each color is 155. Since 1+2+...+30=465, and 465=3*155, such a partition is possible. Therefore, each number is assigned to exactly one color, and each color&#39;s assigned numbers sum to 155. Therefore, each color&#39;s classification has 10, 10, and 10 classes (since 30 numbers divided equally), but wait, 30 numbers divided into three groups would require each group to have 10 numbers only if 30 is divisible by 3, which it is. But does each group of 10 numbers sum to 155? Let&#39;s check. Take the first 10 numbers: 1+2+...+10=55. The next 10: 11+12+...+20=155. The last 10: 21+22+...+30=255. Oh, wait, the middle group (11-20) sums to 155. Therefore, if we assign red to classes 11-20 (sum 155), yellow to 21-30 (sum 255), and blue to 1-10 (sum 55), this doesn&#39;t work because the sums are not equal. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, the partitioning must be more nuanced. For example, combining small and large numbers in each group to balance the sums. For instance, one possible way is to have each color&#39;s classification include a mix of small, medium, and large numbers such that each sums to 155. But constructing such a partition requires some effort, but since the problem doesn&#39;t ask for the partition, just the sum of the number of classes, which would be 30, as each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across the three classifications. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is 30. However, I need to confirm this with another angle. If each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across the three classifications, then the total number of classes is 30. But each box is counted in three classes (one for each color). However, the total number of class memberships is 3*155=465, which matches the total sum of class sizes (since each class size is counted once per color it&#39;s assigned to). But if each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once, then the total number of class memberships is 1+2+...+30=465, which matches 3*155=465. Therefore, this makes sense. Therefore, each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once as a class size in one of the three classifications. Therefore, the total number of classes is 30, hence the sum of the number of classes in the three classifications is 30. So part (1) answer is 30. Now, part (2) asks to explain that it is possible to find three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same. This sounds like an application of the pigeonhole principle. Given that there are 155 boxes, and considering the possible combinations of red, yellow, and blue counts. However, since each classification (color) has classes of sizes 1 to 30, but assigned across the three colors. Wait, but we established that each color&#39;s classes have sizes that are a subset of 1-30, with each number used exactly once. Therefore, each color has 10 class sizes summing to 155. But how does this relate to finding three boxes with at least two colors having the same count? Wait, the problem is asking to find three boxes where for at least two colors, the number of balls of those colors are the same. So in other words, among any three boxes, there are two that have the same number of red balls, or the same number of yellow balls, or the same number of blue balls. But the problem says &quot;it is possible to find three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot; Wait, no, more precisely: &quot;three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot; So in three boxes, for at least two of the colors, each of those two colors has the same number across the three boxes. Wait, actually, the wording is: &quot;three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot; So perhaps in each of the three boxes, for at least two colors, the number of balls is the same. For example, Box A and Box B have the same number of red balls, Box B and Box C have the same number of yellow balls, and Box C and Box A have the same number of blue balls. But the problem says &quot;the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot; So maybe in the three boxes, there are two colors such that all three boxes have the same number for those two colors? Or that for two of the colors, each of those two colors has the same number in all three boxes? Alternatively, it could mean that among the three boxes, for at least two of the colors, there exists a pair of boxes that have the same number for that color. For example, two boxes share the same red count, two share the same yellow count, etc. But the exact wording is: &quot;three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot; This is a bit ambiguous, but likely it means that in the three boxes, there are two colors such that for each of those two colors, all three boxes have the same number of balls of that color. But that would require that for two colors, say red and yellow, all three boxes have the same red count and the same yellow count. However, since each class size is unique per color (since each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once per classification), wait no. Wait, in our previous reasoning, each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once across all three classifications. So for example, the class size 5 might be assigned to red, meaning there is exactly one class in red with 5 boxes, each with a certain number of red balls. Similarly, class size 5 cannot be used in yellow or blue. Therefore, for each color, the class sizes are distinct numbers from 1 to 30, and each number is used exactly once in one color. Wait, no. If we assigned each number from 1 to 30 to exactly one color, then each color has some subset of these numbers as their class sizes. Therefore, for example, red might have class sizes 1, 4, 5, ..., yellow has 2, 3, 6, ..., etc. Each number is used exactly once. Therefore, for each color, the class sizes are unique and cover a subset of 1-30. Therefore, for each color, the number of classes is equal to the number of distinct class sizes assigned to that color. For example, if red has class sizes 1-10, then it has 10 classes. Wait, but earlier we saw that the sum of class sizes per color is 155. If we assign numbers 1-30 to three colors such that each color&#39;s assigned numbers sum to 155, then the number of classes per color would be the number of numbers assigned to it. Since the total numbers are 30, and we need to partition them into three groups summing to 155 each, the number of numbers in each group can vary. For example, one color might have more large numbers (requiring fewer classes to sum to 155), and another might have more small numbers (requiring more classes). However, the exact distribution isn&#39;t specified, but the key is that all numbers 1-30 are used exactly once across the three colors. Therefore, the total number of classes is 30. Now, for part (2), we need to explain that there exist three boxes where for at least two colors, the number of balls of those colors are the same. Given that there are 155 boxes, and each color&#39;s classification has a number of classes (summing to 30 total classes). Wait, but with 30 classes across three colors, and 155 boxes, the average number of boxes per class is about 155/30 ≈ 5.17. However, each class size is exactly one of the numbers from 1 to 30. But we need to find three boxes such that for at least two colors, the numbers of balls are the same. That is, in three boxes, there are two colors where each of those two colors has the same number in all three boxes. Or, alternatively, that among the three boxes, two of them share the same number for one color, and another two share the same number for another color. The exact wording is a bit unclear, but likely it&#39;s the former: in three boxes, there are two colors where all three boxes have the same number for those two colors. But how can we guarantee that? Let&#39;s think in terms of the pigeonhole principle. Each box is characterized by three numbers: (r, y, b), where r is the number of red balls, y the number of yellow, and b the number of blue. We need to find three boxes such that for at least two of the colors, say red and yellow, all three boxes have the same r and y values. Alternatively, for two colors, say red and yellow, each of the three boxes has the same value for red, or the same value for yellow, but not necessarily the same across all three. Wait, the problem says &quot;the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot; So maybe in the three boxes, for two colors, the numbers are the same across all three boxes. For example, all three boxes have the same number of red balls and the same number of yellow balls. But given that each class size for each color is unique (since each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once per classification), this would mean that for a given color, there is only one class of each size. Therefore, if two boxes are in the same class for red, they have the same number of red balls, and the size of that class is unique. Similarly for yellow and blue. Wait, but if a class size is unique across all three colors, meaning that each number from 1 to 30 is used exactly once as a class size in one of the three colors, then for each color, the class sizes are distinct. For example, if red has a class of size 5, then no other class in red, yellow, or blue has size 5. Therefore, for each color, the classes have unique sizes (1-30), each assigned to exactly one color. Therefore, for each color, the number of classes is equal to the number of class sizes assigned to it. For example, if red has class sizes 1, 2, ..., 10, then it has 10 classes, each of size 1 to 10. Wait, no. Wait, if each class size is unique across all three colors, then if red has a class of size 5, then yellow and blue cannot have a class of size 5. Therefore, each color&#39;s classes have distinct sizes not overlapping with the other colors. Therefore, for each color, the number of classes is equal to the number of class sizes assigned to it, and the total across all three colors is 30. But then, each class size corresponds to exactly one color. So, for example, class size 1 is assigned to red, meaning there is exactly one class in red with size 1 (i.e., one unique number of red balls that appears in exactly one box). Similarly, class size 2 might be assigned to yellow, meaning there is a class in yellow with 2 boxes that have the same number of yellow balls. Given that, if we want to find three boxes where two colors have the same number across all three boxes, we need to find three boxes that share the same number in two colors. However, since for each color, each class size is unique (i.e., each number of balls for a color corresponds to a class of unique size), this seems challenging. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking to find three boxes where at least two of the boxes share the same number for one color, and at least two share the same number for another color. For example, Box1 and Box2 have the same red count, Box2 and Box3 have the same yellow count. This would mean that in the three boxes, there are two pairs sharing a color count. The problem states: &quot;three boxes where the numbers of at least two colors of balls are the same.&quot; This could be interpreted as: among the three boxes, for at least two colors, there exists a pair of boxes that share the same count for that color. For example, two boxes share the same red count, and two boxes share the same yellow count (which could be the same pair or different pairs). To prove that such three boxes exist, we can use the pigeonhole principle. Let&#39;s consider the number of possible distinct values for each color. For each color, the number of classes is the number of distinct counts for that color. Since the total number of classes across all three colors is 30, each color has a certain number of classes. Let’s denote R, Y, B as the number of classes for red, yellow, blue respectively, with R + Y + B = 30. The total number of boxes is 155. If we consider the possible pairs of colors, we can use the pigeonhole principle to show that there must be three boxes that overlap in two colors. Alternatively, think of each box as a triplet (r, y, b), where r is the red count class, y the yellow, and b the blue. Each r, y, b corresponds to a class in their respective color. Since there are R red classes, Y yellow classes, and B blue classes, the total number of possible triplets is R * Y * B. However, we have 155 boxes. If R * Y * B &lt; 155, which it likely is not, but given that R + Y + B = 30, the product could be large. Alternatively, use the pigeonhole principle on pairs. For each box, we can consider the pairs (r, y), (r, b), (y, b). There are R * Y possible (r, y) pairs, R * B possible (r, b) pairs, and Y * B possible (y, b) pairs. If the total number of boxes is large enough, some triplet must share two pairs. But let&#39;s calculate. The number of distinct pairs (r, y) is R * Y. Similarly for the others. If we have 155 boxes, each contributing three pairs, the total number of pair occurrences is 3*155=465. The number of distinct pairs across all three types is R*Y + R*B + Y*B. To ensure that some three boxes share two pairs, we need to show that the number of pairs is less than the number of boxes times 2, but this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, use the fact that with 155 boxes and considering the classes for each color, there must be overlaps in two colors. Given that the number of classes per color varies, but the total is 30, maybe we can use an averaging argument. Suppose that each color has approximately 10 classes (since 30 total). Then the number of distinct (r, y) pairs would be 10*10=100. If we have 155 boxes, each contributing a unique (r, y) pair, we would need at least 155 pairs, which exceeds 100, so by pigeonhole, some pairs must be repeated. Similarly, this applies to (r, b) and (y, b). Therefore, there must be at least two boxes with the same (r, y) pair, meaning they share both red and yellow counts. But the problem asks for three boxes where at least two colors have the same numbers. If we can find two boxes that share two colors, that&#39;s a stronger result. However, the problem asks for three boxes where at least two colors are the same. Wait, if we have two boxes that share two colors, that would mean they have the same counts for two colors, but the problem asks for three boxes where at least two colors are the same. Perhaps the three boxes have two pairs sharing two different colors. Alternatively, use the Erdős–Rényi theorem on tripartite hypergraphs, but that&#39;s probably overcomplicating. Another approach: consider that each box is identified by its three class memberships (r, y, b). We need to show that there exist three boxes such that two of their class memberships are the same. But perhaps a more straightforward way: Since the total number of classes is 30, and there are 155 boxes, by the pigeonhole principle, some class must have at least ⎄155/30⎄ = 6 boxes (since 155 divided by 30 is approximately 5.17). However, each class size is exactly the numbers 1 to 30 assigned to the three colors. Wait, no. Earlier, we established that each number from 1 to 30 is a class size in exactly one color. Therefore, the largest class size is 30 (assigned to one color), then 29, etc., down to 1. But the total sum is 465, which is 3*155. But how does this help? If there&#39;s a class of size 30 in one color, that means 30 boxes have the same number of that color&#39;s balls. Then, among these 30 boxes, consider their counts for the other two colors. Since the other two colors have class sizes summing to 155 - 30 = 125, but their class sizes are numbers from 1 to 30 excluding the ones assigned to the first color. But maybe this is not helpful. Alternatively, consider that for each color, the average number of boxes per class is 155 / K, where K is the number of classes for that color. Since K is part of the total 30 classes, the average number of boxes per class across all colors is 155 / 30 ≈ 5.17. But some classes have only 1 box, others up to 30. But perhaps using double counting. Let&#39;s consider the number of pairs of boxes that share the same count for a particular color. For each color, the number of pairs sharing that color is the sum over its classes of C(s_i, 2), where s_i is the size of class i. The total number of pairs sharing any color is the sum over all three colors of these values. If we can show that this total is large enough, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be three boxes where two pairs share different colors. But this is getting too vague. Let&#39;s try concrete numbers. Total number of pairs of boxes: C(155, 2) = 155*154/2 = 11935 pairs. For each color, the number of pairs sharing that color is sum_{s in class sizes} C(s, 2). Given that class sizes for each color are some subset of 1-30, with sum 155. To maximize the number of pairs, class sizes should be as large as possible. To minimize, as small as possible. But we know that the class sizes are exactly the numbers 1-30 assigned to the three colors. Therefore, for each color, the number of pairs is sum_{k in assigned class sizes} C(k, 2) = sum_{k} (k(k-1)/2). The total number of pairs across all three colors is sum_{k=1}^{30} C(k, 2) = sum_{k=1}^{30} k(k-1)/2. Calculate this sum:sum_{k=1}^{30} k(k-1)/2 = (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{30} (k² - k) = (1/2)(sum_{k=1}^{30} k² - sum_{k=1}^{30} k)We know sum_{k=1}^{30} k = 465, sum_{k=1}^{30} k² = (30)(31)(61)/6 = 9455.Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{30} k(k-1)/2 = (1/2)(9455 - 465) = (1/2)(8990) = 4495.Therefore, the total number of pairs of boxes sharing the same class in some color is 4495. But there are C(155, 2) = 11935 total pairs. Therefore, the average number of pairs per color is 4495/3 ≈ 1498.33. But this might not directly help. However, note that 4495 pairs of boxes share a common class in some color. If we consider that these are distributed among 11935 total pairs, the probability that a random pair shares a class is 4495/11935 ≈ 0.376. But how does this help us find three boxes with two colors the same? Alternatively, consider that there are 4495 pairs sharing a class. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one pair that shares more than one class. But since each pair of boxes can share at most three classes (if they have the same count in all three colors). However, if two boxes share two or more classes, that would mean they have the same count in two or more colors. But the problem asks for three boxes where at least two colors are the same. Wait, if we have a large number of pairs sharing a class, perhaps we can use the pigeonhole principle to find three boxes that pairwise share a class. For example, if we have many pairs sharing a red class, many sharing yellow, etc., there might be three boxes where each pair shares a different color. But this is getting too abstract. Maybe there&#39;s a simpler way. Let’s consider the possible trios of boxes. There are C(155, 3) trios. Each trio can have varying degrees of shared colors. We need to show that at least one trio has at least two colors where all three boxes share that color&#39;s count. Alternatively, use the fact that with 155 boxes and classes sizes up to 30, there must be overlaps. Alternatively, think about it this way: since each color&#39;s classification uses class sizes from 1 to 30, and there are 155 boxes, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be some overlaps in the classes. For example, if we consider the number of classes for each color, say R, Y, B, with R + Y + B = 30, then the average number of boxes per class is 155/30 ≈ 5.17. This suggests that many classes have multiple boxes. But if we consider that each class size is a unique number from 1 to 30, then there is exactly one class of size 1, one class of size 2, ..., up to one class of size 30, spread across the three colors. Therefore, the class sizes are exactly the numbers 1 to 30, with each number assigned to one color. Therefore, for example, the class of size 30 is in one color, say red, meaning 30 boxes have the same red count. Similarly, the class of size 29 is in another color, say yellow, meaning 29 boxes have the same yellow count, and so on. Given that, in the class of size 30 (red), there are 30 boxes with the same red count. Within these 30 boxes, their yellow and blue counts must vary. Since the total number of boxes is 155, the remaining 125 boxes are in other classes. But within these 30 boxes, consider their yellow counts. The yellow classification has class sizes that sum to 155. If the yellow class sizes include numbers from 1 to 30 (excluding the ones assigned to red and blue), but each class size is unique. Similarly for blue. Within the 30 boxes sharing the same red count, their yellow and blue counts must belong to some classes in yellow and blue. However, since the class sizes for yellow and blue are also unique numbers from 1 to 30, the pigeonhole principle implies that within these 30 boxes, there must be some overlaps in yellow or blue counts. For example, if we have 30 boxes with the same red count, and these 30 boxes have different yellow counts, then since the yellow classification has class sizes summing to 155, but the 30 boxes would require at least 30 different yellow classes (each with at least 1 box). However, the yellow classification only has, say, Y classes, where Y is part of the 30 total. If Y is, say, 10, then having 30 boxes with different yellow counts would require 30 classes, which exceeds the available classes. Therefore, there must be overlaps in the yellow counts among these 30 boxes. Similarly, if the class of size 30 (red) has 30 boxes, and the yellow classification has, say, Y classes, then by the pigeonhole principle, these 30 boxes must have at least ⎄30/Y⎄ boxes sharing the same yellow count. If Y is 10, then there are 3 boxes sharing the same yellow count. Therefore, within the red class of size 30, there are 3 boxes with the same yellow count. Therefore, these three boxes share the same red count and the same yellow count, which gives us three boxes where two colors (red and yellow) have the same numbers. Therefore, this proves part (2). In general, since there is a class of size 30 (in one color), and within that class, the other two colors must have counts that are covered by the remaining class sizes. Given that the other two colors have class sizes that are unique numbers from 1 to 30 (excluding the 30), the number of classes available for the other colors is limited, leading to overlaps by the pigeonhole principle. Therefore, the answer to part (2) is that in the largest class (size 30) of one color, the other two colors must have repeated counts due to the limited number of available classes, leading to three boxes sharing two colors.&lt;/think&gt;(1) Sum of the number of classes in the three classifications:  The problem states that each natural number from 1 to 30 is the size of some class in one of the three color classifications. Since the total number of boxes (155) is exactly one-third of the sum of numbers 1 to 30 ((465/3 = 155)), each color&#39;s classification must use a distinct subset of these numbers such that their sum equals 155. This partitions the numbers 1–30 into three groups, each summing to 155. Since all 30 numbers are used exactly once across the three colors, the total number of classes (one per number) is 30.  Answer: (boxed{30})(2) Existence of three boxes with at least two colors having the same count:  Consider the class with the largest size (30 boxes) in one color, say red. These 30 boxes must have distinct class sizes for yellow and blue due to the unique assignment of numbers 1–30. However, the remaining two colors (yellow and blue) have only (30 - 1 = 29) distinct class sizes left. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these 30 boxes must share the same class size in one of the other colors (yellow or blue). Repeating this argument for three boxes within this group ensures there are three boxes where two colors share the same count.  Explanation: The largest class (size 30) forces overlaps in another color&#39;s classes, guaranteeing three boxes with matching counts in two colors.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e582b305></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e582b305><span class="icon" data-v-e582b305>🔑:</span>【Analysis】According to the problem, we can get a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, cdots, a_{i} ; b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, cdots, b_{j} ; c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, cdots, c_{k}, which includes all integers from 1 to 30, so n geqslant 30.

Hmm, let&#39;s start by remembering what the domain of a function is. The domain is all the possible x-values that we can plug into the function without it blowing up or giving us something undefined, right?Now, specifically for logarithmic functions, I recall that you can&#39;t take the logarithm of a non-positive number. Logarithms are only defined for positive real numbers. So, whatever is inside the log function, which in this case is (x - 1), must be greater than zero. That seems like the key point here.So, setting up the inequality: the argument inside the log, which is (x - 1), has to be greater than 0. Let me write that down:x - 1 &gt; 0Solving this inequality should give me the domain. Let&#39;s solve for x. If I add 1 to both sides of the inequality:x - 1 + 1 &gt; 0 + 1Simplifying that:x &gt; 1So, does that mean the domain is all real numbers greater than 1? Let me verify.If x is 1, then the argument becomes 0, and log base 2 of 0 is undefined. If x is less than 1, like 0, then we get log base 2 of -1, which is also undefined. So, yes, x has to be greater than 1.But wait, let me make sure I&#39;m not missing anything else. Is there any other restriction on the domain here? The logarithmic function log_2(u) is defined when u &gt; 0, so as long as we ensure that u = x - 1 is positive, we&#39;re good. The base of the logarithm is 2, which is a valid base because it&#39;s positive and not equal to 1. If the base were something like 1 or a negative number, that would be an issue, but since the base is 2, we don&#39;t have to worry about that.Therefore, the only restriction comes from the argument of the logarithm. So the domain is all real numbers x such that x is greater than 1. In interval notation, that would be (1, ∞). Let me check again with some example values. If x is 2, then the argument is 1, and log base 2 of 1 is 0, which is fine. If x is 3, the argument is 2, and log base 2 of 2 is 1, which is also okay. What about x approaching 1 from the right? As x approaches 1 from values slightly larger than 1, the argument approaches 0 from the positive side, and the logarithm approaches negative infinity, but it&#39;s still defined for any x &gt; 1, just the outputs get very large in the negative direction. So, the vertical asymptote is at x = 1, but the domain is still everything to the right of that.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else here. The function is a standard logarithmic function shifted horizontally. The parent function log base 2 of x has a domain of (0, ∞), and this one is shifted to the right by 1 unit, so the domain shifts accordingly to (1, ∞). That makes sense.So, putting it all together, the domain is all real numbers x where x is greater than 1. In interval notation, that&#39;s (1, infinity). So, I think that&#39;s the answer.Final AnswerThe domain of the function is boxed{(1, infty)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the domain of the function ( y = log_{2}(x - 1) ), we need to ensure that the argument of the logarithm is positive. The logarithm function is only defined for positive real numbers, so we set up the inequality:[x - 1 &gt; 0]Solving this inequality for ( x ):[x - 1 &gt; 0 implies x &gt; 1]This means that ( x ) must be greater than 1 for the argument of the logarithm to be positive. Therefore, the domain of the function is all real numbers greater than 1. In interval notation, this is written as:[(1, infty)][boxed{(1, infty)}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the domain of the function y equals log base 2 of (x minus 1). Hmm, let me recall what the domain of a logarithmic function is. From what I remember, logarithmic functions are only defined when their argument is positive. That is, log base a of b is defined only if b is greater than zero. So, in this case, the argument of the logarithm is (x - 1). Therefore, for the function to be defined, (x - 1) must be greater than zero. Let me write that down: x - 1 &gt; 0. To solve this inequality, I can add 1 to both sides. That would give me x &gt; 1. So, does that mean the domain is all real numbers x such that x is greater than 1? Wait, let me double-check. The base of the logarithm is 2, which is a valid base because it&#39;s greater than 1. Bases for logarithms must be positive and not equal to 1. Since 2 is positive and not 1, that&#39;s okay. So, the base isn&#39;t the issue here; it&#39;s just the argument we need to worry about.Therefore, the only restriction comes from the argument (x - 1) needing to be positive. So, solving x - 1 &gt; 0 gives x &gt; 1. Therefore, the domain is all real numbers greater than 1. But let me make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything else. Sometimes functions can have other restrictions, like denominators or square roots, but in this case, it&#39;s just a logarithm. The logarithm only imposes the condition that its argument must be positive. There&#39;s no denominator here that could be zero, and no square roots that would require non-negative arguments. So, the only condition is x - 1 &gt; 0.Therefore, the domain should be all real numbers x where x is greater than 1. In interval notation, that would be (1, infinity). Wait, but the problem just says to put the answer in a box. It doesn&#39;t specify the format. The question says &quot;The domain of the function y = log₂(x - 1) is ____.&quot; So, probably they want it in inequality notation or interval notation. Let me check the standard way domains are presented. Usually, for logarithmic functions, the domain is expressed as x &gt; 1, or in interval notation (1, ∞). Either is acceptable, but since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, maybe I should write both? Wait, no, the original problem probably expects interval notation, but let me see. If they use words like &quot;the domain is...&quot;, sometimes they want the inequality. But given the way the problem is written, with a blank, maybe they want interval notation. Let me check standard math problems. Hmm, often when domains are asked without specific format, interval notation is common. So, (1, ∞). But maybe they want x &gt; 1. Wait, the problem is presented as &quot;The domain of the function y = log_{2}(x - 1) is ____.&quot; So, they might be expecting an inequality like x &gt; 1, or using set-builder notation. Hmm. But in many textbooks, the answer would be written in interval notation. Let me think. If I recall, for the domain of log functions, typically the answer is presented as all real numbers greater than some value, which can be written as x &gt; 1 or (1, ∞). Since the problem is presented with a blank, maybe they want interval notation. However, sometimes teachers prefer inequalities. But since it&#39;s unspecified, maybe I can write both? Wait, no, the user just wants the final answer in a box. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: &quot;The domain of the function y = log_{2}(x - 1) is ____. Please reason step by step...&quot; So, they left a blank. The way it&#39;s phrased is similar to multiple-choice questions where the answer is an inequality or interval. Given that, maybe safest to write in interval notation. But just to be thorough, let&#39;s confirm. The domain is all real numbers x such that x - 1 &gt; 0, which is x &gt; 1. So, in interval notation, that&#39;s (1, ∞). Yes, that&#39;s correct. Alternatively, if written as an inequality, it&#39;s x &gt; 1. But in many contexts, especially when the answer is to be boxed, interval notation is expected. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify. Hmm. Wait, maybe the original problem uses inequality notation. Let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;The domain of the function y = log_{2}(x - 1) is ____.&quot; The blank is after &quot;is,&quot; so maybe they want something like &quot;all real numbers x such that x &gt; 1,&quot; but maybe in a shorter form. Since the user hasn&#39;t specified, but given that on tests and textbooks, when the domain is asked for a logarithmic function, the answer is usually expressed in interval notation. However, sometimes it&#39;s written with inequalities. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, since they used the notation log_{2}(x - 1), which is a standard LaTeX notation, maybe they expect the answer in interval notation inside a box. But I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, they might want the set-builder notation: {x | x &gt; 1}. However, given that the problem is presented in a short-answer format, the most common way to present the domain is interval notation. So, (1, ∞). Alternatively, since the base of the logarithm is 2, which is greater than 1, the function is defined for x - 1 &gt; 0, hence x &gt; 1. So, the domain is x &gt; 1. Either way is correct. But to be safe, maybe write both? Wait, no, in the answer, the user wants the final answer in a box. So, maybe they just want the inequality. Let me check another source. For example, if I look up similar problems, sometimes they write the domain of log functions as interval notation. For example, the domain of log base 2 of x is (0, ∞). So, in this case, shifting x by 1, the domain would be (1, ∞). Therefore, perhaps interval notation is expected here. Alternatively, the problem might be from a source that uses inequality notation. But since it&#39;s unspecified, I think interval notation is safer. So, the answer is (1, ∞). Therefore, inside a box, it would be boxed{(1, infty)}. But let me check once more. If I consider that the original function is log_2(x - 1), then the argument must be positive. x - 1 &gt; 0 implies x &gt; 1. So, in interval notation, this is (1, infinity). Yes. So, I think that&#39;s correct. Therefore, the domain is all real numbers greater than 1, which is written as (1, ∞) in interval notation. So, the final answer is boxed{(1, infty)}. Alternatively, if they expect inequality notation, it would be boxed{x &gt; 1}. But I need to recall if the user has any preference. Since the user hasn&#39;t specified, but in the problem statement, they use the notation y = log_{2}(x - 1), which is LaTeX. So, in many math problems using LaTeX, especially in textbooks, interval notation is preferred. Thus, I think boxed{(1, infty)} is the most appropriate answer here. Wait, but maybe I can check similar problems online. For example, if I search &quot;domain of log base 2 of (x - 1)&quot;, the top results say the domain is x &gt; 1, or in interval notation, (1, ∞). So, both are correct, but depending on the context. However, given that in the problem statement, the blank is after &quot;is&quot;, and given that the answer is to be boxed, I think they might be expecting interval notation. But perhaps the user expects inequality notation. Hmm. Since the problem is in Chinese (the original user may have Chinese context), but since it&#39;s translated to English here, maybe following the general math conventions. In many cases, both are acceptable, but interval notation is more concise. Alternatively, let me check the initial problem statement once again. It says &quot;the domain of the function y = log_{2}(x - 1) is ____.&quot; So, if I were to fill in the blank, in a textbook, they might write &quot;all real numbers x such that x &gt; 1&quot; or use interval notation. Since the answer is to be put inside a box, and mathematical answers in boxes often use interval notation for domains, especially in calculus and precalculus problems. Therefore, I think (1, ∞) is the answer they are looking for. But just to be thorough, maybe I should present both. But the problem says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which suggests a single answer. Therefore, I have to choose the most appropriate one. Alternatively, maybe check if the question is from an SAT or ACT test, where they often prefer interval notation. But since I don&#39;t have that context, perhaps safest to use interval notation. So, my final answer is boxed{(1, infty)}. But wait, in some regions, like in some European countries, they use ]1, ∞[ for open intervals. But in the US, it&#39;s (1, ∞). Since the problem is written in LaTeX, which commonly uses parentheses for open intervals, so (1, ∞) is correct. Alternatively, if the answer is supposed to be in Chinese math notation, but since it&#39;s translated here, probably follows the standard (1, ∞). So, I think that&#39;s safe. Therefore, after all this thinking, I conclude the domain is (1, ∞), so the answer is boxed{(1, infty)}.Final AnswerThe domain of the function ( y = log_{2}(x - 1) ) is boxed{(1, infty)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the domain of the function ( y = log_{2}(x - 1) ), we need to ensure the argument of the logarithm is positive. The logarithmic function ( log_{2}(a) ) is defined only when ( a &gt; 0 ). For the given function, the argument is ( x - 1 ). Therefore, we set up the inequality:[x - 1 &gt; 0]Solving this inequality, we add 1 to both sides:[x &gt; 1]This means the domain of the function is all real numbers ( x ) such that ( x ) is greater than 1. In interval notation, this is written as ( (1, infty) ).Thus, the domain of the function ( y = log_{2}(x - 1) ) is (boxed{(1, infty)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e582b305></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e582b305><span class="icon" data-v-e582b305>🔑:</span>Since y = log_{2}(x - 1), we have x - 1 &gt; 0, which implies x &gt; 1.

The problem is: If (a + b)² minus (a - b)² equals 4, then what&#39;s the relationship between a and b? The options are opposites, equal, reciprocals, or negative reciprocals. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.First, maybe I should expand both squares and see what happens. Let&#39;s start with expanding (a + b)². That formula is a² + 2ab + b². Right? And then (a - b)² would be a² - 2ab + b². So if I subtract the second one from the first, that would be (a² + 2ab + b²) - (a² - 2ab + b²). Let me write that out:(a² + 2ab + b²) - (a² - 2ab + b²)Now, distribute the subtraction sign to each term inside the parentheses:a² + 2ab + b² - a² + 2ab - b²Hmm, let&#39;s combine like terms here. The a² and -a² cancel out, same with the b² and -b². Then we have 2ab + 2ab, which is 4ab. So the entire expression simplifies to 4ab. So according to the problem, this equals 4:4ab = 4Okay, so if I divide both sides by 4, I get:ab = 1So the product of a and b is 1. Now, what does that mean about their relationship? Let&#39;s check the options.A: Opposites of each other. That would mean a = -b. If that were true, then ab = -b². But the equation is ab = 1, so unless b is imaginary, that&#39;s not possible. So probably not A.B: Equal. If a = b, then ab = a² = 1. So a would be either 1 or -1. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify that a and b are positive, so they could be equal and 1 or -1. Wait, but is that the only case? If they are equal, their product is 1. So a² = 1, so a = 1 or -1, same with b. But is &quot;equal&quot; the correct relationship here? Because ab =1 could be achieved in other ways too, like a=2 and b=1/2. But then they are reciprocals. Wait, maybe I&#39;m confused.C: Reciprocals of each other. That would mean a = 1/b. Then ab = 1. Exactly. So if they are reciprocals, then ab =1. So that&#39;s exactly what we have here.D: Negative reciprocals. That would be a = -1/b, so ab = -1. But our equation is ab =1, so D is not correct.Wait, but let me check option B again. If a and b are equal, then a = b. Then substituting into ab =1, we get a² =1, so a=1 or a=-1. So in that case, a and b would be equal but they could be 1 or -1. However, the problem is asking for the relationship between a and b. So ab=1 doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they are reciprocals. For example, if a=2 and b=0.5, then ab=1, and they are reciprocals. But if a=1 and b=1, they are equal and their product is 1. So in that case, they are both equal and reciprocals. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Wait, the question is asking for the relationship. So, does ab=1 imply that they are reciprocals? Or does it imply that they are equal? Because if a and b are equal, then ab=1 would require that a²=1, so they are equal only if a and b are both 1 or both -1. But in general, ab=1 could have other solutions where a and b are not equal but reciprocals. So in general, the equation ab=1 is equivalent to a and b being reciprocals. But when they are equal, that&#39;s a special case where a and b are both 1 or -1. So the general relationship is that they are reciprocals. So the answer should be C.But let&#39;s double-check. Let&#39;s test some numbers. Let&#39;s say a=2 and b=1/2. Then (2 + 1/2)² - (2 - 1/2)². Let&#39;s compute that:First term: (2.5)² = 6.25Second term: (1.5)² = 2.25Subtracting: 6.25 - 2.25 = 4. Which matches the given equation. So in this case, a and b are reciprocals but not equal. So that works. If I take a=1 and b=1, which are equal, then (1+1)^2 - (1-1)^2 = 4 - 0 = 4. Also works. But here they are equal. So in this case, they are both equal and reciprocals. So in that specific case, both B and C are true. But the question is asking for the relationship. So in general, ab=1 implies that they are reciprocals. Because even when they are equal, they are still reciprocals (since 1 is its own reciprocal, same with -1). So the answer is C: Reciprocals of each other.Wait, but the problem is from a multiple-choice question, so the answer must be one of the options. Let me check if in the problem statement, the question is asking for &quot;the relationship&quot;, which is a general case, not specific. So even though in some cases they could be equal, the general relationship is that they are reciprocals, because ab=1. So the answer is C.Therefore, the correct answer is C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem: If ((a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 = 4), then the relationship between (a) and (b) is:First, we expand both squares:[(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2][(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2]Subtracting the second expression from the first:[(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - a^2 + 2ab - b^2]Combining like terms, we get:[4ab]According to the problem, this equals 4:[4ab = 4]Dividing both sides by 4:[ab = 1]This implies that the product of (a) and (b) is 1. The relationship where the product of two numbers is 1 is that they are reciprocals of each other. Therefore, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem says: If (a + b) squared minus (a - b) squared equals 4, then what is the relationship between a and b? The options are opposites, equal, reciprocals, or negative reciprocals. Hmm. Alright, let&#39;s start by expanding the left side of the equation to see if we can simplify it.First, I remember that (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y² and (x - y)² = x² - 2xy + y². So maybe if I expand both (a + b)² and (a - b)², subtract them, and see what&#39;s left.Let&#39;s do that step by step. Expanding (a + b)² gives a² + 2ab + b². Expanding (a - b)² gives a² - 2ab + b². Now, subtracting the second expansion from the first: (a² + 2ab + b²) - (a² - 2ab + b²). Let&#39;s subtract term by term.First, a² minus a² cancels out. Then, 2ab minus (-2ab) would be 2ab + 2ab, which is 4ab. Next, b² minus b² also cancels out. So the entire left side simplifies to 4ab. So according to the problem, 4ab = 4.Then, dividing both sides by 4, we get ab = 1. So the product of a and b is 1. Now, looking at the answer choices: opposites would mean a = -b, which would give ab = -b², not necessarily 1. Equal would mean a = b, so ab = a², which would only be 1 if a is 1 or -1, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that. Reciprocals of each other would mean a = 1/b, so then ab = 1, which matches our result. Negative reciprocals would be a = -1/b, leading to ab = -1, which doesn&#39;t fit.So the relationship is that a and b are reciprocals of each other. Let me check again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in expanding. (a + b)² - (a - b)². Let me compute that again. (a + b)² is a² + 2ab + b². (a - b)² is a² - 2ab + b². Subtracting them: (a² + 2ab + b²) - (a² - 2ab + b²). Let&#39;s subtract the terms: a² - a² = 0, 2ab - (-2ab) = 4ab, b² - b² = 0. So indeed, 4ab = 4, so ab = 1. Therefore, a and b are reciprocals. So the answer should be C.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another possible interpretation. If ab = 1, that means b = 1/a, right? So reciprocals. So C: Reciprocals of each other. That seems right. Let&#39;s think if any other option could be possible. If a and b were equal, then ab = a². The equation would be 4a² = 4, so a² = 1, so a = 1 or -1, but the question doesn&#39;t specify that a and b are specific numbers, just the general relationship. So it&#39;s possible for a and b to be equal only if their squares are 1, but the problem doesn&#39;t state that. So the general relationship is ab =1, meaning reciprocals, regardless of their specific values. So C is the answer.Alternatively, maybe I could have recognized this identity earlier. The difference of squares: (a + b)² - (a - b)². I remember that x² - y² = (x - y)(x + y). So maybe applying that here. Let x = (a + b) and y = (a - b). Then, x² - y² = (x - y)(x + y). Let&#39;s compute x - y and x + y.x - y = (a + b) - (a - b) = a + b - a + b = 2b.x + y = (a + b) + (a - b) = a + b + a - b = 2a.So x² - y² = (2b)(2a) = 4ab. So indeed, the original equation is 4ab = 4, leading to ab =1. So that&#39;s another way to see it. Either way, same result. So the answer is C. So I think that&#39;s correct.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we start by expanding the given expression ((a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2):1. Expand ((a + b)^2) and ((a - b)^2):   [   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2   ]   [   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2   ]2. Subtract the two expansions:   [   (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - a^2 + 2ab - b^2   ]3. Simplify the result:   [   a^2 - a^2 + b^2 - b^2 + 2ab + 2ab = 4ab   ]4. Given the equation (4ab = 4), we divide both sides by 4:   [   ab = 1   ]This result indicates that the product of (a) and (b) is 1, meaning (a) and (b) are reciprocals of each other. Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e582b305></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e582b305><span class="icon" data-v-e582b305>🔑:</span>Solution: Given (a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - a^2 + 2ab - b^2 = 4ab,  Therefore, 4ab = 4,  Solving this, we get ab = 1.

The problem says that school starts classes at 8:10 in the morning, and each class lasts for 40 minutes. We need to figure out what time the class ends. Hmm, right. So starting at 8:10 AM, adding 40 minutes to that. Let me break this down step by step.First, I know that time can sometimes be tricky because of the 60-minute hours. So adding 40 minutes to 8:10. Let me think. If I add 40 minutes to 8:10, I can split the 40 minutes into two parts to make it easier. Maybe 20 minutes and another 20 minutes? Or perhaps 10 minutes and 30 minutes? Let&#39;s try that.Starting at 8:10, if I add 10 minutes, that would take us to 8:20. Then, adding the remaining 30 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to 8:20 would be 8:50. Wait, so 8:10 plus 10 minutes is 8:20, plus 30 minutes is 8:50. So the total time added is 40 minutes, leading to 8:50 AM.Alternatively, I could just add 40 minutes directly. Let&#39;s check that method. From 8:10, adding 40 minutes. Since each hour has 60 minutes, 40 minutes is less than an hour. So, 8:10 plus 40 minutes. Let&#39;s separate the minutes. 10 minutes plus 40 minutes is 50 minutes. So the hour part stays the same? Wait, yes, because we haven&#39;t reached the next hour. So the time would be 8:50 AM. Hmm, same result.Wait, is there another way to verify this? Maybe by converting the time to minutes past a certain hour and then converting back. Let&#39;s try that. If the class starts at 8:10, that&#39;s 8 hours and 10 minutes. Let&#39;s convert the start time to total minutes since midnight. 8 hours is 8*60 = 480 minutes. 480 +10 = 490 minutes. Then, adding 40 minutes gives 490 +40 = 530 minutes. Now, convert 530 minutes back to hours and minutes. 530 divided by 60 is 8 with a remainder of 50. So that&#39;s 8 hours and 50 minutes, which is 8:50 AM. Yep, that checks out.Wait, so all three methods give me the same answer. Starting at 8:10, adding 40 minutes leads to 8:50 AM. So the class should end at 8:50 in the morning. Let me just make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in any of the steps.First method: 8:10 +10 minutes =8:20; 8:20 +30 minutes=8:50. That seems right. Second method: 8:10 +40 minutes. 10+40=50, so 8:50. Third method: converting to minutes since midnight. 8*60+10=490. 490+40=530. 530 minutes is 8h50m. All consistent.Alternatively, maybe using a number line approach. Starting at 8:10, each segment is 10 minutes. So 8:10, 8:20, 8:30, 8:40, 8:50. That&#39;s four 10-minute segments. 4*10=40. So that&#39;s 8:50. Yeah, same result.I guess another way to think about it is that 40 minutes is two-thirds of an hour. But since 8:10 is the start time, adding two-thirds of an hour. However, that might complicate things since dealing with fractions. But let&#39;s try. One hour is 60 minutes. Two-thirds of 60 is 40 minutes, which is exactly the duration. So starting at 8:10, adding two-thirds of an hour (40 minutes) brings us to 8:50. So that also works.So all different methods confirm that the class ends at 8:50 AM. Therefore, the answer should be 8:50 in the morning. I can&#39;t see any mistakes in the reasoning here. It all adds up. So the box should be 8:50.Final AnswerThe class should end at boxed{8:50} in the morning.&lt;/think&gt;The school starts classes at 8:10 in the morning, and each class lasts for 40 minutes. To determine the end time, we add 40 minutes to 8:10 AM.1. Direct Addition Method:   - Starting at 8:10 AM, adding 40 minutes:     - 8:10 AM + 40 minutes = 8:50 AM.2. Splitting the Time:   - Split 40 minutes into 10 minutes and 30 minutes:     - 8:10 AM + 10 minutes = 8:20 AM.     - 8:20 AM + 30 minutes = 8:50 AM.3. Conversion to Minutes Since Midnight:   - Convert start time to minutes: 8 hours * 60 + 10 minutes = 490 minutes.   - Add 40 minutes: 490 + 40 = 530 minutes.   - Convert back to hours and minutes: 530 ÷ 60 = 8 hours and 50 minutes, which is 8:50 AM.All methods confirm that the class ends at 8:50 AM. [boxed{8:50}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is about figuring out when the class ends. The school starts at 8:10 AM, and each class lasts 40 minutes. I need to find out the ending time. Hmm, let&#39;s think.First, starting time is 8:10. Each class is 40 minutes. So, adding 40 minutes to 8:10 should give the end time. Let me break down the 40 minutes. 40 minutes can be split into 20 minutes and another 20 minutes, or maybe 30 and 10. Let me try adding step by step.If I add 20 minutes to 8:10, that would be 8:30. Then adding another 20 minutes would make it 8:50. Wait, 20 + 20 is 40, right? So 8:10 plus 40 minutes is 8:50. So the class ends at 8:50 AM? That seems straightforward.Wait, let me double-check. Starting at 8:10, adding 40 minutes. 8:10 plus 30 minutes is 8:40. Then adding the remaining 10 minutes would take it to 8:50. Yeah, same result. Okay, so that seems correct.Alternatively, if I convert the starting time to minutes past midnight. 8 hours is 480 minutes, plus 10 minutes is 490 minutes. Adding 40 minutes gives 530 minutes. Then converting back to hours and minutes: 530 divided by 60 is 8 hours with 50 minutes left. So 8:50 AM. Yep, that checks out.I think that&#39;s solid. So the answer should be 8:50 in the morning. Let me just make sure there&#39;s no trick here. Maybe daylight saving or something? But the problem doesn&#39;t mention anything like that. It&#39;s a straightforward time addition. So yeah, 40 minutes after 8:10 is 8:50. The class ends at 8:50 AM.Final AnswerThe class should end at boxed{8:50} in the morning.&lt;/think&gt;The school starts classes at 8:10 in the morning, and each class lasts for 40 minutes. To find the ending time, we need to add 40 minutes to the starting time of 8:10 AM.1. Starting time: 8:10 AM.2. Adding 40 minutes to 8:10 AM:   - 8:10 AM + 20 minutes = 8:30 AM   - 8:30 AM + 20 minutes = 8:50 AMAlternatively, converting the starting time to minutes past midnight:- 8 hours = 480 minutes- 480 minutes + 10 minutes = 490 minutes- Adding 40 minutes: 490 minutes + 40 minutes = 530 minutes- Converting back to hours and minutes: 530 minutes = 8 hours and 50 minutes, which is 8:50 AM.Thus, the class should end at boxed{8:50} in the morning.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e582b305></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e582b305><span class="icon" data-v-e582b305>🔑:</span>Solution: 8:10 + 40 minutes = 8:50,Answer: A class lasts for 40 minutes.

So, we have a rectangle ABCD. Let me visualize it first. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. Let&#39;s label the rectangle with points A, B, C, D in order, so that AB and CD are the lengths, and AD and BC are the widths. Now, the problem says that on the extension of side AD beyond point D, there&#39;s a point E such that DE = 0.5 AD. So, if I imagine extending the side AD past D, E is a point that&#39;s half the length of AD away from D. So, DE is half of AD. We are also told that angle BEC is 30 degrees. The goal is to find the ratio of the sides of the rectangle ABCD. So, the sides are AB and AD (since in a rectangle, adjacent sides are the length and width). So, the ratio would be AB:AD, or maybe AD:AB? Let me make sure. The problem just says &quot;the ratio of the sides,&quot; so probably length over width or vice versa. But in any case, once we find one, the other is just the reciprocal.Let me start by drawing a diagram to help visualize. Let&#39;s denote the rectangle ABCD with AB and CD as the top and bottom sides, and AD and BC as the left and right sides. Extending AD beyond D, point E is located such that DE = 0.5 AD. So, if AD is, say, 2 units, then DE would be 1 unit. But maybe assigning variables would be better.Let me assign variables. Let’s let AD = x, so DE = 0.5x. Then AB = y (since in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = x, and AB = CD = y). So, the sides are AB = y and AD = x, and we need to find y/x or x/y.Given angle BEC is 30 degrees. So, points B, E, and C form triangle BEC with angle at E being 30 degrees. We need to relate the sides x and y using this information.First, let&#39;s figure out the coordinates of the points to perhaps use coordinate geometry. Let&#39;s place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since AD is one side, and AD = x, point D would be at (0, x). Wait, no, if we place A at (0,0), and since ABCD is a rectangle, then if AB is horizontal, point B would be at (y, 0), point C at (y, x), and point D at (0, x). Wait, but in that case, AD would be vertical, from A(0,0) to D(0, x). Then, the extension of AD beyond D would be along the vertical line x=0, going upwards from D(0, x). So, point E would be 0.5x above D, so at (0, x + 0.5x) = (0, 1.5x). Wait, but DE is 0.5 AD, and AD is length x, so DE = 0.5x. Since AD is from A(0,0) to D(0, x), then extending beyond D by DE = 0.5x would place E at (0, x + 0.5x) = (0, 1.5x).Alternatively, maybe coordinate system placement is making this vertical. But perhaps another way is to set AD as horizontal? Wait, no, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if we place A at (0,0), then if AB is horizontal, AD must be vertical.Wait, maybe I need to fix the coordinate system. Let me confirm:Let’s set point A at (0,0). Then, since it&#39;s a rectangle, if AB is along the x-axis, then point B is at (a, 0), where a is the length AB. Then, point D would be at (0, b), where b is the length AD. Then, point C, which is diagonally opposite to A, would be at (a, b). So, sides AB = a, AD = b. Then, DE is 0.5 AD, which is 0.5b, and since we are extending AD beyond D, which is along the y-axis from A(0,0) to D(0, b), so beyond D is in the positive y-direction. So, point E would be at (0, b + 0.5b) = (0, 1.5b).Then, points B is at (a, 0), E is at (0, 1.5b), and C is at (a, b). So, angle BEC is 30 degrees. So, angle at E between points B, E, C. So, angle BEC is 30 degrees. So, we need to compute angle at E between EB and EC.To find this angle, we can use coordinates to find vectors EB and EC, then use the dot product formula to find the angle between them. Since we know the coordinates of points B, E, and C, we can compute the vectors.First, vector EB is from E to B: B - E = (a - 0, 0 - 1.5b) = (a, -1.5b)Vector EC is from E to C: C - E = (a - 0, b - 1.5b) = (a, -0.5b)Then, the angle between vectors EB and EC is given by:cos(theta) = (EB . EC) / (|EB| |EC|)We know theta is 30 degrees, so cos(theta) = cos(30°) = √3 / 2.Compute the dot product EB . EC:= (a)(a) + (-1.5b)(-0.5b) = a² + 0.75b²Compute |EB|:= sqrt(a² + (-1.5b)²) = sqrt(a² + 2.25b²)Compute |EC|:= sqrt(a² + (-0.5b)²) = sqrt(a² + 0.25b²)So, putting it into the cosine formula:(a² + 0.75b²) / [sqrt(a² + 2.25b²) * sqrt(a² + 0.25b²)] = √3 / 2That&#39;s the equation we need to solve for the ratio a/b or b/a.Let me let k = a/b. Then, a = k*b. Let&#39;s substitute a = k*b into the equation.First, substitute a = k*b:Numerator: (k²b² + 0.75b²) = b²(k² + 0.75)Denominator: sqrt(k²b² + 2.25b²) * sqrt(k²b² + 0.25b²) = b*sqrt(k² + 2.25) * b*sqrt(k² + 0.25) = b²*sqrt((k² + 2.25)(k² + 0.25))So, the equation becomes:[b²(k² + 0.75)] / [b²*sqrt((k² + 2.25)(k² + 0.25))] = √3 / 2Simplify b² cancels:(k² + 0.75) / sqrt((k² + 2.25)(k² + 0.25)) = √3 / 2Let me write that as:(k² + 3/4) / sqrt((k² + 9/4)(k² + 1/4)) = √3 / 2Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:[(k² + 3/4)^2] / [(k² + 9/4)(k² + 1/4)] = 3/4Multiply both sides by [(k² + 9/4)(k² + 1/4)]:(k² + 3/4)^2 = (3/4)(k² + 9/4)(k² + 1/4)Expand both sides:Left side: (k² + 3/4)^2 = k^4 + (3/4)*2k² + (3/4)^2 = k^4 + (3/2)k² + 9/16Wait, actually, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², so:(k² + 3/4)^2 = (k²)^2 + 2*k²*(3/4) + (3/4)^2 = k^4 + (3/2)k² + 9/16Right side: (3/4)(k² + 9/4)(k² + 1/4)First compute (k² + 9/4)(k² + 1/4):= k^4 + (1/4)k² + (9/4)k² + (9/4)(1/4) = k^4 + (10/4)k² + 9/16 = k^4 + (5/2)k² + 9/16Multiply by 3/4:= 3/4*k^4 + (15/8)k² + 27/64So, left side: k^4 + (3/2)k² + 9/16Right side: (3/4)k^4 + (15/8)k² + 27/64Bring all terms to left side:k^4 + (3/2)k² + 9/16 - (3/4)k^4 - (15/8)k² - 27/64 = 0Combine like terms:k^4 - (3/4)k^4 = (1/4)k^4(3/2)k² - (15/8)k² = (12/8 - 15/8)k² = (-3/8)k²9/16 - 27/64 = (36/64 - 27/64) = 9/64So, equation becomes:(1/4)k^4 - (3/8)k² + 9/64 = 0Multiply all terms by 64 to eliminate denominators:16k^4 - 24k² + 9 = 0So, 16k^4 -24k² +9 =0Let me let m = k², so equation becomes:16m² -24m +9 =0Solve quadratic equation:m = [24 ± sqrt(576 - 4*16*9)] / (2*16)Compute discriminant:sqrt(576 - 576) = sqrt(0) =0So, m = [24]/32 = 3/4Since discriminant is zero, there is one real solution: m = 3/4Therefore, k²= 3/4, so k= sqrt(3)/2 or k= -sqrt(3)/2, but since k is a ratio of lengths, it&#39;s positive. So, k= sqrt(3)/2Therefore, the ratio a/b= sqrt(3)/2, so the sides AB/AD= sqrt(3)/2But the problem says &quot;the ratio of the sides of rectangle ABCD&quot;. Since a rectangle has sides of length AB and AD, the ratio can be presented as AB:AD = sqrt(3):2, or if simplified as a fraction, sqrt(3)/2.Alternatively, sometimes ratios are expressed in the order of adjacent sides, but since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, either could be acceptable, but likely they want AB/AD, which is the length over the width, which is sqrt(3)/2.But let me double-check the steps to ensure no mistakes.1. Assigned coordinates correctly with A at (0,0), B at (a,0), D at (0,b), C at (a,b), E at (0,1.5b). Correct.2. Vectors EB = (a, -1.5b), EC = (a, -0.5b). Correct.3. Dot product: a^2 + (-1.5b)(-0.5b) = a² + 0.75b². Correct.4. |EB| = sqrt(a² + 2.25b²), |EC| = sqrt(a² + 0.25b²). Correct.5. Substitute a = k*b, then equation becomes (k² + 0.75)/sqrt((k² + 2.25)(k² + 0.25)) = sqrt(3)/2. Correct.6. Squared both sides: (k² + 0.75)^2 / [(k² + 2.25)(k² + 0.25)] = 3/4. Correct.7. Expanded both sides and simplified to 16k^4 -24k² +9 =0. Correct.8. Solved quadratic in m =k², found m=3/4. Therefore, k= sqrt(3)/2. Correct.Therefore, the ratio AB/AD is sqrt(3)/2. So, the sides are in the ratio sqrt(3) : 2.But let me check if the problem expects AD/AB instead. Since AD is the side being extended, maybe they consider AD as one side. But the problem says &quot;the ratio of the sides of rectangle ABCD&quot;. In a rectangle, it&#39;s standard to present the ratio as length to width. If AB is the length and AD is the width, then the ratio is AB:AD = sqrt(3)/2. Alternatively, if AD is considered the length, but in a rectangle, sides are adjacent, so unless specified, it&#39;s ambiguous. But since in the problem, DE is given as 0.5 AD, so AD is a side. Since in the coordinate system we set AB as horizontal and AD as vertical, but in reality, rectangles can be oriented either way. However, in the absence of specific orientation, perhaps the answer is expected as AB:AD = sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.Alternatively, sometimes ratios are expressed in whole numbers. Let me see. sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866:1, but since sqrt(3) and 2 are both coefficients, maybe they want it as sqrt(3):2. But likely, the answer is AB:AD = sqrt(3)/2, so the ratio is sqrt(3) to 2. Thus, the box should be boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.But let me check once more with an alternative approach to confirm.Alternative approach: Using trigonometry in triangle BEC.Given angle at E is 30 degrees. So, in triangle BEC, angle at E is 30 degrees. Let&#39;s compute the lengths of EB, EC, and BC? Wait, BC is a side of the rectangle, BC = AD = x. Wait, but BC is vertical from B to C? Wait, no, in the rectangle, BC is adjacent to B, so BC is vertical. Wait, in the coordinate system, BC is from (a,0) to (a, b), so it&#39;s vertical with length b. But in triangle BEC, points B, E, C. So, points B(a,0), E(0,1.5b), C(a,b). So, triangle with vertices at (a,0), (0,1.5b), (a,b).Alternatively, maybe using coordinates complicates, but using distance formula.Wait, but we already did the coordinate approach. Alternatively, using Law of Sines or Cosines.In triangle BEC, with angle at E being 30 degrees. Let&#39;s apply the Law of Cosines.Law of Cosines: BC² = EB² + EC² - 2*EB*EC*cos(theta)Wait, but BC is a side of the rectangle, which is equal to AD = x. Wait, but BC in the rectangle is vertical from B(a,0) to C(a,b), so length BC = b. Wait, but in the problem statement, AD is extended, so AD is one side. Wait, in the rectangle, sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, BC is equal in length to AD, so BC = AD = x. Wait, but in the coordinate system, BC is vertical with length b. Wait, perhaps my initial variable assignment was conflicting.Wait, maybe there was confusion in variable assignment. Let&#39;s re-examine.Earlier, I let AD = x, so AD is vertical from A(0,0) to D(0,x). Then DE = 0.5x, so E is at (0, 1.5x). Then AB is horizontal from A(0,0) to B(y,0), so AB = y. Then BC is from B(y,0) to C(y,x), so BC = x. Then in this case, the sides of the rectangle are AB = y and AD = x. So, the ratio is AB:AD = y:x.But in the problem statement, we need to find the ratio of the sides. So, if they&#39;re asking for AB:AD or AD:AB? The problem says &quot;the ratio of the sides of rectangle ABCD&quot;. Since a rectangle has two pairs of sides, the ratio would typically be expressed as the longer side to the shorter side, but unless specified, it&#39;s the order of the sides as adjacent. So, if AB and AD are adjacent sides, the ratio is AB:AD.But in our solution, we found that AB/AD = sqrt(3)/2. So, the ratio is sqrt(3):2. But let me confirm with Law of Cosines.In triangle BEC, angle at E is 30 degrees. Let&#39;s compute the lengths.EB: distance from E(0,1.5x) to B(y,0): sqrt((y)^2 + (1.5x)^2)EC: distance from E(0,1.5x) to C(y,x): sqrt((y)^2 + (0.5x)^2)BC: distance from B(y,0) to C(y,x): xWait, but BC is not a side of triangle BEC. Wait, triangle BEC has sides EB, EC, and BC? No, points B, E, C. So, sides are EB, EC, and BC? Wait, no, BC is a different side. Wait, no, in triangle BEC, the sides are BE, EC, and BC. Wait, but point B is connected to E and C, so in triangle BEC, the sides are BE, EC, and BC. Wait, but BC is part of the rectangle, but in the coordinate system, distance from B(y,0) to C(y,x) is x, but in the triangle BEC, the side BC is indeed part of the rectangle. Wait, but is BC a side of triangle BEC? Let me check.Points B, E, C: connected as B to E to C to B. So, the triangle has sides BE, EC, and CB. So, CB is a side of the rectangle, length x. So, in triangle BEC, sides are BE, EC, CB with lengths sqrt(y² + (1.5x)^2), sqrt(y² + (0.5x)^2), and x.Therefore, applying Law of Cosines on triangle BEC with angle at E being 30 degrees.Wait, angle at E is 30 degrees, so sides adjacent to E are BE and EC, and the side opposite angle E is BC.Wait, Law of Cosines: BC² = BE² + EC² - 2*BE*EC*cos(angle E)So, BC² = BE² + EC² - 2*BE*EC*cos(30°)Substitute BC = x, BE = sqrt(y² + (1.5x)^2), EC = sqrt(y² + (0.5x)^2)Thus:x² = [y² + (2.25x²)] + [y² + 0.25x²] - 2*sqrt(y² + 2.25x²)*sqrt(y² + 0.25x²)*(√3/2)Simplify left side: x²Right side: y² + 2.25x² + y² + 0.25x² - √3*sqrt(y² + 2.25x²)*sqrt(y² + 0.25x²)Combine terms:2y² + 2.5x² - √3*sqrt((y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²)) = x²Bring x² to the right:2y² + 2.5x² - x² = √3*sqrt((y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²))Simplify:2y² + 1.5x² = √3*sqrt((y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²))Square both sides:(2y² + 1.5x²)^2 = 3*(y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²)Expand left side:(2y² + 1.5x²)^2 = 4y⁴ + 6y²x² + 2.25x⁴Right side:3*(y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²) = 3*[y⁴ + 0.25x²y² + 2.25x²y² + 0.5625x⁴] = 3*[y⁴ + 2.5x²y² + 0.5625x⁴] = 3y⁴ + 7.5x²y² + 1.6875x⁴Set left and right sides equal:4y⁴ + 6y²x² + 2.25x⁴ = 3y⁴ + 7.5x²y² + 1.6875x⁴Bring all terms to left:4y⁴ -3y⁴ + 6y²x² -7.5x²y² + 2.25x⁴ -1.6875x⁴ =0Simplify:y⁴ -1.5x²y² + 0.5625x⁴ =0Multiply through by 16 to eliminate decimals:16y⁴ -24x²y² +9x⁴=0Which is the same as earlier equation when substituting k = y/x. Let k = y/x, so y = kx. Substitute into equation:16(kx)^4 -24x²(kx)^2 +9x⁴ =016k⁴x⁴ -24k²x⁴ +9x⁴=0Divide by x⁴:16k⁴ -24k² +9=0Which is same as before, leading to k²=3/4, so k= sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, y/x= sqrt(3)/2, so ratio AB/AD= sqrt(3)/2. Thus, confirming our previous result.Therefore, the ratio is sqrt(3)/2.Hence, the answer is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.Final AnswerThe ratio of the sides of rectangle (ABCD) is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a rectangle (ABCD) with (AD) extended beyond (D) to a point (E) such that (DE = 0.5 cdot AD) and (angle BEC = 30^circ), we need to find the ratio of the sides (AB) and (AD).1. Assign Variables and Coordinates:   - Let (AD = x) and (AB = y).   - Place (A) at ((0, 0)), (B) at ((y, 0)), (D) at ((0, x)), and (C) at ((y, x)).   - Point (E) is on the extension of (AD) beyond (D), so (E) is at ((0, 1.5x)).2. Vectors and Dot Product:   - Vectors ( overrightarrow{EB} ) and ( overrightarrow{EC} ) are calculated as:     [     overrightarrow{EB} = (y, -1.5x), quad overrightarrow{EC} = (y, -0.5x)     ]   - Dot product: ( overrightarrow{EB} cdot overrightarrow{EC} = y^2 + 0.75x^2 )   - Magnitudes: ( |overrightarrow{EB}| = sqrt{y^2 + (1.5x)^2} ), ( |overrightarrow{EC}| = sqrt{y^2 + (0.5x)^2} )3. Using Cosine Formula:   - Given (cos(30^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), we set up the equation:     [     frac{y^2 + 0.75x^2}{sqrt{(y^2 + 2.25x^2)(y^2 + 0.25x^2)}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}     ]   - Let (k = frac{y}{x}), substitute (y = kx) and simplify:     [     frac{k^2 + 0.75}{sqrt{(k^2 + 2.25)(k^2 + 0.25)}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}     ]   - Squaring both sides and simplifying leads to the quadratic equation in (k^2):     [     16k^4 - 24k^2 + 9 = 0     ]   - Solving this quadratic equation gives (k^2 = frac{3}{4}), so (k = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).Thus, the ratio of the sides (AB) to (AD) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the sides of rectangle ABCD. Let me start by visualizing the problem. A rectangle ABCD, with AD being one of the sides. Then, on the extension of AD beyond point D, there&#39;s a point E such that DE is half of AD. Also, the angle BEC is 30 degrees. The goal is to find the ratio of the sides of the rectangle, which I assume is AB to AD, since those are the two adjacent sides of the rectangle.First, let me draw a rectangle. Let&#39;s label the rectangle with points A, B, C, D in order, so that AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD, and BC equals AD. The problem mentions side AD, so AD is one of the sides. Then, the extension of AD beyond D is where point E is located, such that DE is half of AD. So, starting from D, moving along AD&#39;s extension (which would be the same line as AD but beyond D), we place E such that DE = 0.5 AD.So DE is half the length of AD. Let me assign variables to the sides to make this more concrete. Let’s let AD = x, so DE = 0.5x. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, AB = CD = y (let’s say), and BC = AD = x. Wait, no, BC would be equal to AD? Wait, no, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So sides AB and CD are equal, and sides BC and AD are equal. So if ABCD is the rectangle, going around the rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Therefore, AB is adjacent to BC, so AB and BC are the two different sides.Therefore, if AD is one side, then AD is equal to BC. Then AB is equal to CD. So, if I let AD = x, then BC = x, and AB = y, CD = y. So the sides of the rectangle are x and y. The problem asks for the ratio of the sides, so that would be y/x or x/y. Probably y/x since usually ratios are presented in the order of the sides mentioned, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify, so I need to be careful.Anyway, let&#39;s set up a coordinate system to model this. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if AD is vertical, then moving from A(0,0) to D(0, x) since AD = x. Then, AB would be horizontal from A(0,0) to B(y, 0), and then C(y, x). Wait, but if BC is equal to AD, then BC is x. So from B(y,0) to C(y, x), which is vertical. That makes sense.So coordinates:A: (0,0)B: (y,0)C: (y,x)D: (0,x)Now, the extension of AD beyond D is along the line from A(0,0) to D(0,x), so beyond D, that&#39;s the positive y-direction. Wait, no. Wait, AD goes from A(0,0) to D(0,x). So the extension beyond D would be continuing in the same direction, which is upwards along the y-axis. Wait, but D is at (0,x), so the extension beyond D would be points with coordinates (0, x + t) where t &gt; 0. Then, DE = 0.5 AD. Since AD is length x, DE = 0.5x. Therefore, E is located 0.5x beyond D along AD&#39;s extension. Therefore, E&#39;s coordinates would be (0, x + 0.5x) = (0, 1.5x).So E is at (0, 1.5x).Now, angle BEC is 30 degrees. Points B, E, C. So angle at E between points B, E, C is 30 degrees. So angle BEC = 30°. Need to find the ratio of the sides of the rectangle, which is y/x.To find this ratio, we need to relate the coordinates of points B, E, C and use the angle between them. Let me recall that the angle between three points can be found using vector analysis or coordinate geometry. Since we have coordinates for B, E, and C, we can compute vectors EB and EC and then use the dot product formula to find the angle between them. The angle between EB and EC is 30 degrees. Let me verify that.Wait, angle BEC is the angle at point E between points B, E, and C. So yes, it&#39;s the angle at E formed by EB and EC. Therefore, vectors would be EB and EC. So vectors from E to B and from E to C. Wait, no. Wait, angle at E is between EB and EC. So vectors are EB and EC. But depending on direction, but since the angle is at E, the vectors would be from E to B and from E to C.But in the standard notation, angle BEC is the angle at E between EB and EC, so vectors EB and EC emanate from E. So vectors EB = B - E and EC = C - E. Then, the angle between vectors EB and EC is 30 degrees. So we can use the dot product formula:cos(theta) = (EB . EC) / (|EB| |EC|)Given theta = 30°, so cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2.Therefore, we can compute vectors EB and EC, compute their dot product, divide by the product of their magnitudes, set it equal to sqrt(3)/2, and solve for y/x.Let me compute the coordinates:Point E: (0, 1.5x)Point B: (y, 0)Point C: (y, x)Therefore, vector EB = B - E = (y - 0, 0 - 1.5x) = (y, -1.5x)Vector EC = C - E = (y - 0, x - 1.5x) = (y, -0.5x)Now, compute the dot product EB . EC = (y)(y) + (-1.5x)(-0.5x) = y² + 0.75x²Then, compute |EB| = sqrt(y² + (-1.5x)²) = sqrt(y² + 2.25x²)Compute |EC| = sqrt(y² + (-0.5x)²) = sqrt(y² + 0.25x²)Therefore, according to the dot product formula:(y² + 0.75x²) / (sqrt(y² + 2.25x²) * sqrt(y² + 0.25x²)) = cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2So:(y² + 0.75x²) / (sqrt((y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²))) = sqrt(3)/2Let me write this equation:(y² + 0.75x²) = (sqrt(3)/2) * sqrt((y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²))To eliminate the square roots, let&#39;s square both sides:(y² + 0.75x²)^2 = (3/4) * (y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²)Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) separately.First, LHS:(y² + 0.75x²)^2 = y^4 + 2*y²*(0.75x²) + (0.75x²)^2 = y^4 + 1.5x²y² + 0.5625x^4RHS:(3/4) * (y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²)First compute (y² + 2.25x²)(y² + 0.25x²):= y²*y² + y²*0.25x² + 2.25x²*y² + 2.25x²*0.25x²= y^4 + 0.25x²y² + 2.25x²y² + 0.5625x^4Combine like terms:= y^4 + (0.25 + 2.25)x²y² + 0.5625x^4= y^4 + 2.5x²y² + 0.5625x^4Multiply by 3/4:= (3/4)(y^4 + 2.5x²y² + 0.5625x^4)= (3/4)y^4 + (3/4)(2.5x²y²) + (3/4)(0.5625x^4)Compute each term:(3/4)y^4 = (3/4)y^4(3/4)(2.5x²y²) = (3/4)*(5/2)x²y² = (15/8)x²y²(3/4)(0.5625x^4) = (3/4)*(9/16)x^4 = (27/64)x^4So RHS becomes:(3/4)y^4 + (15/8)x²y² + (27/64)x^4Therefore, equating LHS and RHS:y^4 + 1.5x²y² + 0.5625x^4 = (3/4)y^4 + (15/8)x²y² + (27/64)x^4Let me convert all coefficients to fractions to make calculation easier.Note that:1.5 = 3/20.5625 = 9/1615/8 = 1.87527/64 ≈ 0.421875But maybe better to express everything in 64 denominators to combine terms.Alternatively, bring all terms to the left side:y^4 + 1.5x²y² + 0.5625x^4 - (3/4)y^4 - (15/8)x²y² - (27/64)x^4 = 0Compute each term:y^4 - (3/4)y^4 = (1 - 3/4)y^4 = (1/4)y^41.5x²y² - (15/8)x²y² = (3/2 - 15/8)x²y² = (12/8 - 15/8)x²y² = (-3/8)x²y²0.5625x^4 - 27/64x^4 = (9/16 - 27/64)x^4 = (36/64 - 27/64)x^4 = (9/64)x^4So the equation becomes:(1/4)y^4 - (3/8)x²y² + (9/64)x^4 = 0Multiply both sides by 64 to eliminate denominators:16y^4 - 24x²y² + 9x^4 = 0This is a quartic equation, but it&#39;s quadratic in terms of y². Let me set z = y². Then the equation becomes:16z² - 24x²z + 9x^4 = 0This is a quadratic in z:16z² -24x²z +9x^4 =0Let me solve for z using quadratic formula:z = [24x² ± sqrt( (24x²)^2 - 4*16*9x^4 )]/(2*16)Compute discriminant:(24x²)^2 - 4*16*9x^4 = 576x^4 - 576x^4 = 0So discriminant is zero, which means there&#39;s one real solution:z = (24x²)/(2*16) = (24x²)/32 = (3x²)/4Therefore, z = (3x²)/4. Recall z = y², so:y² = (3x²)/4 =&gt; y = (sqrt(3)/2)xTherefore, the ratio y/x is sqrt(3)/2.Wait, but the problem asks for the ratio of the sides of the rectangle. Since a rectangle&#39;s sides are adjacent sides, which are AB and AD. AB is y, AD is x, so the ratio AB/AD = y/x = sqrt(3)/2.But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Let&#39;s verify with the coordinates.Given that E is at (0, 1.5x), B is at (y, 0), C is at (y, x). Then vectors EB = (y, -1.5x), EC = (y, -0.5x). Then, if y = (sqrt(3)/2)x, let&#39;s compute the angle.Compute the dot product:EB . EC = y² + 0.75x² = (3/4)x² + 0.75x² = (3/4 + 3/4)x² = 1.5x²|EB| = sqrt(y² + (1.5x)^2) = sqrt( (3/4)x² + 2.25x² ) = sqrt( (0.75 + 2.25 )x² ) = sqrt(3x²) = x*sqrt(3)|EC| = sqrt(y² + (0.5x)^2) = sqrt( (3/4)x² + 0.25x² ) = sqrt(x²) = xTherefore, cos(theta) = (1.5x²) / (x*sqrt(3)*x) = 1.5 / sqrt(3) = (3/2)/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/2, which is indeed cos(30°). So that checks out.Therefore, the ratio of AB to AD is sqrt(3)/2, which is the ratio y/x. Therefore, the sides are in the ratio sqrt(3)/2.But the problem says &quot;the ratio of the sides of rectangle ABCD&quot;. Depending on the convention, it might need to be written as a simplified fraction or in terms of square roots. Since sqrt(3)/2 is already simplified, that&#39;s probably the answer. However, sometimes ratios are presented as two numbers, like AB : AD = sqrt(3) : 2. So maybe we need to write it as sqrt(3) : 2.But the problem didn&#39;t specify, so either form should be acceptable. But since the answer is to be boxed, and mathematical expressions often prefer the fractional form, I can write it as boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.Alternatively, if they want it in terms of a ratio with a colon, it would be boxed{sqrt{3} : 2}. But given that the problem says &quot;ratio of the sides&quot;, and sides are AB and AD, which are y and x. Since the answer is y/x = sqrt(3)/2, so either representation is okay, but in the context of the question, which is a ratio, maybe the colon form is expected. However, in many math problems, especially in geometry, it&#39;s common to present the ratio as a single fraction when it&#39;s a numerical value. Since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, but since it&#39;s exact, writing it as sqrt(3)/2 is appropriate.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another way to represent this. Suppose the rectangle sides are AD and AB. Then the ratio could be AD : AB, which would be x : y, so 1 : (sqrt(3)/2), which simplifies to 2 : sqrt(3). But usually, the ratio is presented in the order mentioned. The problem says &quot;the ratio of the sides of rectangle ABCD&quot;. Since a rectangle has two sides, adjacent sides. The problem didn&#39;t specify which order, so maybe we need to confirm.But in the problem statement, they mention &quot;the extension of side AD beyond point D&quot;, so AD is a side. Then the other side would be AB. So the ratio is AB : AD, which is y : x, which is sqrt(3)/2 : 1, or simplified as sqrt(3) : 2. So writing it as sqrt(3) : 2 is also correct.But given that ratios can be represented as fractions, and depending on the problem&#39;s expectation, both are correct. However, in the answer, they probably want it in the form with a fraction, so boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.Alternatively, the problem might expect rationalizing the denominator or some other form, but sqrt(3)/2 is already simplified. So I think that&#39;s the answer.But let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn&#39;t make any errors:1. Assigned coordinates with A at (0,0), so D is (0,x), B is (y,0), C is (y,x), E is (0,1.5x).2. Calculated vectors EB = (y, -1.5x) and EC = (y, -0.5x).3. Applied the dot product formula, set up the equation with cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2.4. Derived the equation, squared both sides, simplified, ended up with a quadratic in y², solved to find y = (sqrt(3)/2)x.5. Verified the result by plugging back into the vectors and confirming the angle is 30°, which it was.Therefore, the ratio AB/AD is sqrt(3)/2, which is the answer.Final AnswerThe ratio of the sides of rectangle (ABCD) is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a rectangle (ABCD) with (AD) as one of its sides, a point (E) is taken on the extension of (AD) beyond (D) such that (DE = 0.5 AD) and (angle BEC = 30^circ). We need to find the ratio of the sides of the rectangle (ABCD).1. Assigning Coordinates:   - Place (A) at ((0, 0)), (D) at ((0, x)), (B) at ((y, 0)), and (C) at ((y, x)).   - Point (E) is on the extension of (AD) beyond (D), so (E) is at ((0, 1.5x)).2. Vectors Calculation:   - Vector (EB) from (E) to (B) is ((y, -1.5x)).   - Vector (EC) from (E) to (C) is ((y, -0.5x)).3. Dot Product and Magnitudes:   - Dot product (EB cdot EC = y^2 + 0.75x^2).   - Magnitude of (EB) is (sqrt{y^2 + (1.5x)^2} = sqrt{y^2 + 2.25x^2}).   - Magnitude of (EC) is (sqrt{y^2 + (0.5x)^2} = sqrt{y^2 + 0.25x^2}).4. Using Dot Product Formula:   - (cos(30^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).   - (frac{y^2 + 0.75x^2}{sqrt{(y^2 + 2.25x^2)(y^2 + 0.25x^2)}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).5. Solving the Equation:   - Squaring both sides and simplifying leads to the quadratic equation (16z^2 - 24x^2z + 9x^4 = 0) where (z = y^2).   - Solving this quadratic equation gives (z = frac{3x^2}{4}), hence (y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}x).6. Ratio Calculation:   - The ratio of the sides (AB) to (AD) is (frac{y}{x} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).Thus, the ratio of the sides of rectangle (ABCD) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e582b305></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e582b305><span class="icon" data-v-e582b305>🔑:</span>Apply the formula for the tangent of the difference.## SolutionLet angle B E A=alpha, angle C E A=beta, AB / BC=t.
