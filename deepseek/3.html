Can the detective definitely solve the case in 12 days?</div><div class="divider" data-v-817cadee></div><p class="review-content" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there are 80 people involved in a case: one criminal, one witness, and 78 others who are innocent. Detective Nero Wolfe can invite groups of people each day. The key point is that if the witness is in the group and the criminal isn&#39;t, then the witness will reveal the criminal. The question is whether the detective can definitely solve the case within 12 days.First, I need to understand the constraints. Each day, the detective can invite any subset of the 80 people. If the subset contains the witness but not the criminal, then the witness will point out the criminal. So, the detective wants to ensure that within 12 days, no matter who the criminal and witness are, there will be at least one day where the witness is present and the criminal isn&#39;t. Then, the detective will get the information needed to solve the case.So, the problem reduces to designing a sequence of 12 subsets (groups invited each day) such that for every possible pair (criminal, witness) where criminal ≠ witness, there exists at least one subset in the sequence where the witness is included and the criminal is excluded.Alternatively, for each possible witness, the subsets should cover all criminals except the witness. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, let&#39;s think differently.Suppose we fix a witness W and a criminal C (W ≠ C). We need to have a day where W is in the group and C is not. Then, the witness will reveal C as the criminal. So, for every pair (W, C) where W ≠ C, there must be a subset in the 12-day sequence where W is present and C is absent.This is similar to covering all such pairs with the subsets. Each subset S_i can be thought of as covering all pairs (W, C) where W ∈ S_i and C ∉ S_i. The question is, can we cover all such (W, C) pairs with 12 subsets?The total number of pairs (W, C) where W ≠ C is 80*79 = 6320. Each subset S_i covers a certain number of pairs. The challenge is to find 12 subsets such that every possible (W, C) pair is covered by at least one subset.Alternatively, each subset S can be considered as a test. If we include a person W in S and exclude a person C, then we can test the possibility that W is the witness and C is the criminal. But since we need to cover all such possibilities, we need each (W, C) pair to be covered by at least one test.This seems similar to covering codes or set cover problems. However, set cover is NP-hard, but here we need an existence proof whether 12 subsets are sufficient.Alternatively, we can think of this problem in terms of information theory. Each test (subset) gives a bit of information: either the witness is present and the criminal is not (leading to the case being solved), or not. But since the detective wants to guarantee that the case is solved, he needs to structure the tests such that in the worst case, one of the tests must trigger the witness revealing the criminal.But perhaps a better approach is to model this as a matrix. Let&#39;s consider a matrix with 80 rows (each representing a person as a witness) and 80 columns (each representing a person as a criminal). The diagonal entries (where W = C) are irrelevant since the witness cannot be the criminal. Each entry (W, C) where W ≠ C needs to be &quot;covered&quot; by a test where W is in the test and C is not. Each test (subset) corresponds to a collection of entries: for each person in the test, all entries (W, C) where W is that person and C is not in the test. Therefore, each test is a union over all W in S_i of the rows W with columns C not in S_i.To cover all off-diagonal entries with 12 such subsets. Is this possible?Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of separating systems. In combinatorics, a separating system is a set system where for any two distinct elements, there is a set in the system that contains one but not the other. However, in this problem, the requirement is a bit different. For each pair (W, C) with W ≠ C, we need a set that contains W and excludes C. This is similar to a separating system, but specifically for ordered pairs.This is actually called an &quot;identifying code&quot; in some contexts, but maybe more precisely, it&#39;s similar to a family of sets that can distinguish all ordered pairs. Let me check.Yes, in literature, a family of subsets S_1, S_2, ..., S_t of [n] is called an (n, t) separating system if for any two distinct elements x and y, there exists at least one set S_i such that x ∈ S_i and y ∉ S_i, or vice versa. However, in our case, we need for every ordered pair (W, C), W ≠ C, there exists a set S_i such that W ∈ S_i and C ∉ S_i. So this is a directed version of a separating system, where we only care about one direction.This seems related to covering all ordered pairs with the required condition. There might be known bounds on such systems.Alternatively, we can model each person as a vector in {0,1}^12, where each coordinate corresponds to a day, and the entry is 1 if the person is included on that day, 0 otherwise. Then, for two people W and C, we need that there exists at least one coordinate (day) where W has a 1 and C has a 0. If this is satisfied for all W ≠ C, then the detective can solve the case in 12 days.This is equivalent to requiring that the set of vectors forms a code with the property that for any two distinct vectors, there is a coordinate where the first has a 1 and the second has a 0. This is similar to a code with a certain separability property.In coding theory, this is sometimes called a &quot;superimposed code&quot; or a &quot;cover code&quot;. Let me recall.Wait, actually, if we consider the dual problem: each person is assigned a 12-bit vector, and we need that for any two distinct persons, there is a position where the first has a 1 and the second has a 0. This is similar to requiring that the set of vectors are such that no vector is component-wise less than or equal to another. Wait, no. If we require that for every pair (W, C), there exists a coordinate where W is 1 and C is 0, that&#39;s equivalent to saying that the vector for W is not component-wise less than or equal to the vector for C. Therefore, the set of vectors must form an antichain under the component-wise ordering. However, the size of the largest antichain in {0,1}^12 is given by Sperner&#39;s theorem as C(12, floor(12/2)) = C(12,6) = 924. But we need 80 vectors, which is much smaller than 924. So perhaps this is possible.But actually, Sperner&#39;s theorem is about families of subsets where no one is a subset of another. Translating to vectors, it&#39;s about vectors where no one is component-wise less than or equal to another. So if the detective can assign to each person a 12-bit vector such that no two vectors are comparable (i.e., for any two people W and C, there exists a day where W is in the set and C is not, and vice versa). However, our requirement is weaker. We only need that for each pair (W, C), there exists a day where W is included and C is excluded. We don&#39;t need the reverse (i.e., a day where C is included and W is excluded). Therefore, the condition is not requiring an antichain, but a weaker condition. Hence, Sperner&#39;s theorem may not directly apply here.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem. Consider a directed graph where each node is a person, and there is an edge from W to C if there is a test (subset) where W is included and C is excluded. Our goal is to have a directed edge from every W to every C ≠ W. Then, the question is: can we construct such a graph with 12 edges per node (since each test corresponds to a subset, and each person can be in up to 12 subsets), but I think this approach is not straightforward.Alternatively, think of each test as a characteristic vector. For each day, the detective chooses a subset S_i. For person W, let’s define their characteristic vector as a binary string of length 12, where each bit indicates presence (1) or absence (0) in the subset of that day. The requirement is that for any two distinct persons W and C, there exists at least one day (bit position) where W&#39;s bit is 1 and C&#39;s bit is 0.This is equivalent to saying that the characteristic vectors form a set where no two vectors are such that one is component-wise less than or equal to the other. Wait, actually, no. If we require that for every pair W ≠ C, there is a coordinate where W is 1 and C is 0, this is equivalent to saying that the vector for W is not component-wise less than or equal to the vector for C. Therefore, the family of characteristic vectors must form an antichain under the component-wise ordering. But in that case, Sperner&#39;s theorem tells us that the maximum size of such an antichain in {0,1}^12 is C(12,6), which is 924, so since 80 &lt; 924, it&#39;s possible. Therefore, it is possible to have 80 distinct vectors in {0,1}^12 such that none is component-wise less than or equal to another. Therefore, such a set exists, and hence the detective can construct 12 subsets (each corresponding to a coordinate) where each person is assigned a vector, and the subsets are designed such that on day i, person j is in subset S_i if and only if the j-th vector has a 1 in position i.Therefore, this would ensure that for any W and C, since W&#39;s vector is not component-wise less than or equal to C&#39;s vector, there must be some coordinate i where W has a 1 and C has a 0, meaning on day i, W is in S_i and C is not. Hence, the detective can solve the case in 12 days.Wait, but Sperner&#39;s theorem is about families of subsets where no subset is contained in another. Translating to vectors, it&#39;s about vectors where no one is component-wise less than or equal to another. But here, our requirement is slightly different: for each pair (W, C), we don&#39;t need that C&#39;s vector isn&#39;t component-wise less than or equal to W&#39;s, only that W&#39;s vector isn&#39;t component-wise less than or equal to C&#39;s. But actually, in Sperner&#39;s theorem, the antichain condition is symmetric: if no vector is component-wise less than or equal to another, then both directions are prohibited. However, in our problem, the requirement is asymmetric: we only need that for any W ≠ C, W is not component-wise less than or equal to C. But this is equivalent to saying that all vectors are incomparable in the component-wise ordering, which is exactly Sperner&#39;s theorem. Wait, no. If we require only that W is not ≤ C for any W ≠ C, then vectors could still have C ≤ W, but we don&#39;t care. However, in our problem, we need that for every ordered pair (W, C) with W ≠ C, there exists a coordinate where W is 1 and C is 0. This is equivalent to saying that the set of vectors is such that for every pair W ≠ C, W is not ≤ C. This is actually the definition of an antichain. Because if you have an antichain, then for any two distinct elements, neither is ≤ the other. Hence, in that case, for any W ≠ C, W is not ≤ C and C is not ≤ W. Therefore, the condition required here is weaker than an antichain. Wait, no. If we only require that for every W ≠ C, W is not ≤ C, then it&#39;s possible that C ≤ W. But in that case, the condition is not symmetric. However, in our problem, we need that for every ordered pair (W, C) where W ≠ C, there is a coordinate where W is 1 and C is 0. This is equivalent to saying that for every W ≠ C, the vector of W is not component-wise ≤ the vector of C. Therefore, the entire set of vectors must be such that no two distinct vectors are comparable, i.e., it&#39;s an antichain. Because if you have two vectors where one is ≤ the other, say W ≤ C, then there is no coordinate where W is 1 and C is 0, which violates the requirement for the pair (W, C). Similarly, if C ≤ W, then the pair (C, W) would violate the requirement. Therefore, to satisfy the condition for all ordered pairs, it&#39;s necessary that the entire family of vectors is an antichain, where no two distinct vectors are comparable. Therefore, Sperner&#39;s theorem applies here, which states that the maximum size of an antichain in {0,1}^n is C(n, floor(n/2)). For n=12, floor(12/2)=6, so C(12,6)=924. Since 80 &lt; 924, it is possible to have 80 vectors in {0,1}^12 that form an antichain. Therefore, such a family of subsets exists, meaning that the detective can design 12 subsets (days) such that for any two people, neither is always present when the other is absent, which in turn means that for any witness and criminal pair, there will be a day where the witness is present and the criminal is absent. Hence, the detective can indeed solve the case within 12 days.But wait, let me verify this logic again. The key idea is that by assigning each person a unique 12-bit vector from an antichain family, we ensure that for any two people W and C, W&#39;s vector is not component-wise ≤ C&#39;s vector. Therefore, there must be at least one bit (day) where W has a 1 and C has a 0. Hence, on that day, if W is the witness and C is the criminal, the witness would be present and the criminal absent, leading to the crime being solved.However, the problem states that there is one criminal and one witness, both unknown. The detective needs to ensure that for whichever pair (W, C) exists, there is at least one day where W is present and C is absent. Therefore, by constructing the 12 subsets corresponding to the antichain vectors, we cover all possible pairs. Hence, the answer should be yes, it&#39;s possible.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the pigeonhole principle. Each person can be represented by a binary string of length 12. For each person, the number of subsets they are in can vary. However, the critical point is that for any two people, there&#39;s a subset where one is in and the other is out. The number of possible pairs is 80*79=6320. Each subset can cover a certain number of pairs. For a subset S_i with k_i members, it covers k_i*(80 - k_i) pairs (since for each member W in S_i, it pairs with all non-members C). To maximize the number of pairs covered per subset, we should choose subsets of size 40, as 40*40=1600 is the maximum. So, each subset can cover up to 1600 pairs. Therefore, with 12 subsets, the maximum number of pairs covered is 12*1600=19200. Since 19200 &gt; 6320, it&#39;s possible, but this is just an upper bound. However, overlaps might occur, so this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s possible. But given the antichain argument above, since 80 is less than the maximum antichain size in 12 dimensions, it is possible. Therefore, the answer is yes.But let me check another approach. Suppose we use a binary matrix where each column represents a person, each row represents a day, and the entry is 1 if the person is invited on that day. We need that for any two columns W and C, there is a row where W has 1 and C has 0. The minimal number of rows needed for such a matrix with 80 columns is called the identifying code or separating code in coding theory. The minimal number of rows t needed so that the 80x t binary matrix has the property that for any two distinct columns, there is a row where the first is 1 and the second is 0.There is a theorem called the set basis theorem, which might relate here. Alternatively, the problem is similar to teaching sets in machine learning, where each example must be uniquely identified by the set of features.Alternatively, in terms of combinatorics, the minimal number of tests t required can be determined by the ceiling of log2(80 choose 2)), but that might not apply here. Wait, log2(80*79) ≈ log2(6320) ≈ 12.6, so you need at least 13 tests. But this contradicts the previous argument. Wait, perhaps my previous reasoning was flawed.Wait, information-theoretically, each test can give up to 1 bit of information: either the witness is in the set and the criminal is not (leading to detection), or not. But since we need to identify the criminal and witness pair, which has 80*79 possibilities, the number of bits required is log2(80*79) ≈ 12.6 bits. Therefore, you would need at least 13 days if each test gives 1 bit. However, in reality, each test can potentially give more information, because if the witness is present and the criminal is not, you get a lot of information (the criminal&#39;s identity), but if not, you only get a bit (that the criminal might be in the set or the witness is not). However, since the detective needs to guarantee that the case is solved, regardless of the outcomes, he must structure the tests such that at least one test will trigger the witness revealing the criminal. So, the information-theoretic lower bound is actually different here.Wait, but in our problem, the detective doesn&#39;t get feedback each day. He just schedules all 12 days in advance, and if on any day the witness is present and the criminal isn&#39;t, then the case is solved. So, it&#39;s not adaptive. Therefore, the detective must choose 12 subsets in advance such that for every possible (W, C) pair, at least one subset includes W and excludes C.Therefore, the problem is equivalent to covering all (W, C) pairs with subsets S_1, ..., S_12, where each pair is covered by some S_i if W ∈ S_i and C ∉ S_i.This is similar to a covering code problem. The number of pairs is 80*79=6320. Each subset S_i of size k_i covers k_i*(80 - k_i) pairs. To maximize coverage, we should choose subsets of size 40, as mentioned before. However, even with 12 subsets of size 40, the total coverage would be 12*40*40=19200, which is more than 6320. However, this counts overlapping coverage multiple times. The actual number of unique pairs covered might be less. Therefore, the question is whether 12 subsets can cover all 6320 pairs. The antichain argument suggests yes, but let&#39;s verify.If we can assign each person a 12-bit vector such that for any two distinct persons W and C, there is a position where W is 1 and C is 0, then such an assignment would work. The minimal number of bits required is the minimal t such that 80 ≤ Sperner(t), where Sperner(t) is the maximum size of an antichain in {0,1}^t. Sperner&#39;s theorem says Sperner(t) = C(t, floor(t/2)). We need C(t, floor(t/2)) ≥ 80. Let&#39;s compute C(t, floor(t/2)) for t=12: C(12,6)=924 ≥80. Therefore, t=12 is sufficient. Thus, such an assignment exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.Therefore, the detective can definitely solve the case in 12 days.Final Answerboxed{Yes}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves Detective Nero Wolfe investigating a crime with 80 people, one of whom is the criminal and another is the witness. The detective needs to determine if he can solve the case within 12 days by inviting subsets of people such that if the witness is present and the criminal is not, the witness will reveal the criminal.Key steps to solve the problem:1. Understanding the Requirement: For every possible pair of witness (W) and criminal (C), there must be at least one day where W is present and C is absent. This ensures the witness will reveal the criminal.2. Antichain Concept: The problem can be translated into finding a set of 12-bit vectors for each person such that no vector is component-wise less than or equal to another. This is known as an antichain in combinatorics.3. Sperner&#39;s Theorem: Sperner&#39;s theorem states that the maximum size of an antichain in the Boolean lattice {0,1}^n is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, floor(n/2)). For n=12, the maximum size is C(12, 6) = 924, which is larger than 80.4. Application to the Problem: Since 80 vectors can be assigned to the 80 people such that no two vectors are component-wise comparable, the detective can design 12 subsets (days) where each subset corresponds to a bit position. This ensures that for any pair (W, C), there is a day where W is present and C is absent.Thus, using the concept of antichains and Sperner&#39;s theorem, it is possible to cover all pairs (W, C) within 12 days. Therefore, the detective can definitely solve the case in 12 days.[boxed{Yes}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, so Detective Nero Wolfe has to figure out who the criminal and the witness are among 80 people. The key here is that each day, he can invite one or several people to his office. If the witness is among them and the criminal isn&#39;t, then the witness will reveal the criminal. The question is, can he definitely solve the case in 12 days?Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. We have 80 people. One is the criminal (let&#39;s say C), and another is the witness (W). The detective doesn&#39;t know who they are. Each day, he can invite a subset of these people. If his subset includes W but not C, then W will point out C. If either W isn&#39;t in the subset or C is also there, then nothing happens. The goal is to guarantee that within 12 days, the detective can identify both C and W.So the challenge is designing a strategy where over 12 days, through cleverly choosing subsets each day, he can ensure that at least one of those days will have the witness present without the criminal, leading to an immediate identification. But even if that happens, how does he figure out who the witness is? Wait, because once the witness reveals the criminal, then the detective knows who C is, but still needs to determine W. But maybe if he can identify C on a particular day, he can use that information to backtrack and figure out who W is.Alternatively, maybe he needs to not only trigger the revelation but also have a way to determine W through some process of elimination. Let me think.First, let&#39;s consider the problem where the detective just needs to identify the criminal. If he can do that, then once he knows C, he can potentially figure out W by checking which people were in the subsets that didn&#39;t include C but included W. Wait, but he doesn&#39;t know W. Hmm.Alternatively, if he can set up the invitations such that each person is excluded from certain subsets and included in others, then based on the days when the witness reveals the criminal, he can cross-reference the subsets to narrow down who W is.But this seems complicated. Let&#39;s think of this as a covering problem or maybe using some combinatorial group testing strategies.Group testing is a method where you test groups of items to identify defective ones. In standard group testing, you might have defective items that can be identified through tests indicating whether a subset contains a defective. This seems similar but a bit different because here, the &quot;test&quot; (inviting a subset) only gives a positive result (W revealing C) if the subset contains W but not C. So, the positive result not only tells you that W was in the subset but also that C wasn&#39;t, and it immediately identifies C. But if the result is negative, you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because W wasn&#39;t there, or C was there, or both.This seems like a trickier problem than standard group testing because the outcome isn&#39;t just a binary yes/no about the presence of a defective, but it&#39;s conditional on the presence of one element (W) and the absence of another (C). Also, when the outcome is positive, it gives specific information about C&#39;s identity, which is different.So, the detective&#39;s challenge is two-fold: identify C and W. But once C is identified, maybe W can be inferred through subsequent tests? Wait, but once C is known, the detective can just invite all people except C in subsequent days and see if the witness is among them. But he still needs to figure out who W is. However, since W would only reveal C if in a group without C, but once C is known, W could be any of the other 79 people. But how would the detective know which one? Because if he invites a group that includes W without C, W would have already revealed C. Wait, but once C is known, the detective can perhaps design tests to identify W by excluding C and including different subsets of the remaining people. If W is in a subset, but since C is excluded, if the detective invites that subset and doesn&#39;t get a revelation, then he knows W isn&#39;t in that subset. But since he doesn&#39;t get any feedback except when W is present and C is not, he can&#39;t directly test for W&#39;s presence unless he can trigger a revelation. But once C is known, the revelation would only happen if W is in a subset without C, but since C is already known, the detective might not need any more revelations. Wait, no—if the detective already knows C, he can just ask each person individually if they are W, but that would take 79 days. But he needs to do it in 12 days total.Wait, the original problem says &quot;Can the detective definitely solve the case in 12 days?&quot; So both identifying C and W within 12 days. So perhaps the key is that when a revelation happens, it gives both C and implicitly information about W. Because if on a particular day, when you invite a subset S, and you get a revelation, then you know that W is in S and C is not. So C is identified, and W is in S. Then, the detective can note that W must be in S. If he can arrange the subsets such that each individual is excluded from some subsets and included in others, he can use the information from the days when a revelation happened to narrow down W&#39;s identity.But the problem is that the detective doesn&#39;t know in advance which day will result in a revelation. So he needs a strategy where, regardless of who C and W are, there will be at least one day where W is invited and C is not, thereby causing a revelation. Then, using the information from all days, the detective can determine both C and W.So, the plan is:1. Design a sequence of subsets S₁, S₂, ..., S₁₂ such that for any pair (C, W) with C ≠ W, there exists at least one day i where W ∈ Sᵢ and C ∉ Sᵢ.2. Once such a day i occurs, the detective learns C&#39;s identity. Then, since W must be in Sᵢ, the detective can look at all the other days where Sⱼ includes someone from Sᵢ, but C is excluded. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since the detective knows that W is in Sᵢ, and if the subsets are designed such that each person is in some unique combination of subsets, then the detective can use the other days&#39; results to determine which person in Sᵢ is the witness.But this seems complex. Let&#39;s think of an example with smaller numbers. Suppose there are 3 people: A, B, C. Suppose the detective uses 2 days. On day 1, invite {A}, day 2 invite {B}. If the criminal is C, then if the witness is A, day 1 would result in a revelation. If the witness is B, day 2 would reveal C. If the witness is C, but the criminal is someone else, but since the criminal can&#39;t be the witness, this is impossible. Wait, the problem states that the criminal and witness are two different people. So in the case of 3 people, the criminal and witness are distinct. So in the example, if the criminal is A, then the witness is either B or C. Then, if on day 1, he invites {A}, then since the criminal is in the subset, the witness (if B or C) is not in the subset, so nothing happens. On day 2, he invites {B}. If the witness is B and criminal is A, then since criminal is not invited, and witness is invited, B would reveal A. If the witness is C, since C isn&#39;t invited on day 2, nothing happens. So in this case, if the criminal is A and the witness is C, the detective would not get any revelations over the two days. So he wouldn&#39;t solve the case. Therefore, this strategy is insufficient.So, for the 3-person case, how can he guarantee to solve it in 2 days? Maybe a different strategy: on day 1, invite {A, B}, day 2 invite {A, C}. If the criminal is A, then any witness (B or C) would be in the subset on day 1 or 2, but since the criminal is also there, they won&#39;t reveal. If the criminal is B, then on day 2, if the witness is A or C, but if the witness is A, since A is in the subset on day 2 with criminal B? Wait, no, the criminal is B. On day 1, the detective invites {A, B}. If the criminal is B, and the witness is A, then since the witness is in the subset but so is the criminal, nothing happens. On day 2, invites {A, C}. If the witness is A, then since the criminal B is not in the subset, A would reveal B. If the witness is C, then since the criminal B is not in day 2&#39;s subset, C would reveal B. So in this case, if the criminal is B, then on day 2, regardless of who the witness is (A or C), the witness is in the subset (either A or C) and the criminal is not, so the witness would reveal B. Similarly, if the criminal is C, then on day 1, the detective invites {A, B}. If the witness is A or B, and the criminal is C (not in the subset), then the witness would reveal C. If the witness is A, they are in the subset, criminal is not, so they reveal. Same for witness B. If the criminal is C and the witness is, say, A, then on day 1, A is present, criminal not, so revelation. If the witness is B, same. If the criminal is A, then witness is B or C. On day 1, invites {A, B}, so if witness is B, since criminal A is present, no revelation. If witness is C, not in day 1. On day 2, invites {A, C}, if witness is C, since criminal A is present, no revelation. If witness is B, not in day 2. So in this case, if criminal is A and witness is B or C, there&#39;s no revelation. Therefore, this strategy also fails.So, for the 3-person case, the detective needs more days? Or a better strategy.Alternatively, maybe use all subsets. For example, each day, invite a different individual. So in 3 days, invite each person alone. If the criminal is, say, A, then on days when B or C are invited, if the witness is B or C, then since the criminal isn&#39;t there, they will reveal. So if the detective invites A on day 1, B on day 2, C on day 3. If the criminal is A, then the witness is B or C. If the witness is B, then on day 2, when B is invited, since criminal A is not there, B would reveal A. Similarly, if the witness is C, on day 3, C would reveal A. So in this case, the detective would get a revelation on day 2 or 3. Then, he would know the criminal is A, and the witness is the person invited on that day. If the criminal is B, similar: witness is A or C. If the witness is A, invited on day 1, criminal B not there, so A reveals B. If witness is C, day 3, reveals B. If the criminal is C, witness is A or B. If witness is A, day 1 reveals C; if witness is B, day 2 reveals C. So in this case, by testing each individual on separate days, the detective can identify the criminal in 3 days, and the witness is the one who was tested on the day of revelation. But this takes 3 days for 3 people.So in this case, the number of days equals the number of people. But in the original problem, we have 80 people and 12 days. 12 is much less than 80, so the strategy of testing each person individually isn&#39;t feasible. Therefore, we need a more efficient method, likely using group testing.Group testing can help reduce the number of tests by testing multiple people at once. In standard group testing, if you have n items and d defectives, you can find the defectives in log(n choose d) tests or something like that. But here, the problem is different because we have two special people: one criminal and one witness, and the test result depends on the presence of the witness and the absence of the criminal.So, perhaps we can model this as follows: each test (day) can give us a result of either:1. Revelation: which tells us that the tested subset S contains W but not C, and reveals C&#39;s identity.2. No revelation: which tells us that either W is not in S or C is in S (or both).So the problem becomes designing a set of tests such that for any pair (C, W), there is at least one test where W is in S and C is not in S. Then, once such a test happens, C is identified, and W is known to be in that S. However, the detective also needs to figure out who W is. But once C is known, the detective can look back at all the tests that included W (which he doesn&#39;t know yet) but excluded C. But since C is known, the detective can check all tests that excluded C and see in which of those tests a revelation occurred. The witness must be in the intersection of all the subsets that excluded C and resulted in a revelation. Wait, but if multiple tests excluded C, the witness must be in all subsets that were tested on days when a revelation occurred (since those are the days when W was present and C wasn&#39;t), and not in any subsets that excluded C but didn&#39;t result in a revelation (since those would mean W wasn&#39;t in those subsets).But actually, if the detective has a set of tests, and after identifying C, he can look at all tests where C was not invited. Among those tests, the ones that resulted in a revelation must have included W, and the ones that didn&#39;t result in a revelation must have excluded W. Therefore, W is the person who is included in all the tests (excluding C) that resulted in a revelation and excluded from all the tests (excluding C) that didn&#39;t result in a revelation.Therefore, if the detective can design the tests such that for each person (other than C), there&#39;s a unique pattern of which tests (excluding C) they were in, then the detective can determine W based on the pattern of test results.This is similar to using a covering code or a disjunct matrix in group testing. Each person (potential witness) has a unique incidence vector across the tests that exclude the criminal. The results of the tests (whether they resulted in a revelation or not) give a vector that must match exactly the incidence vector of the witness.Therefore, to uniquely identify W, the tests must be designed such that each potential witness has a unique signature across the tests, even when considering that some tests might include the criminal (and hence their result is obscured).Wait, but the complication is that the tests that include the criminal can&#39;t be used to determine the presence of the witness, because even if the witness is in such a test, the presence of the criminal would suppress the revelation. So the detective cannot get any information about the witness from tests that include the criminal.Therefore, the effective tests for identifying the witness are only those tests that exclude the criminal. But the detective doesn&#39;t know who the criminal is in advance, so he has to design tests in such a way that for any possible criminal, the tests excluding that criminal can uniquely identify the witness.This seems like a tall order. Let me think. For each person C, the tests that exclude C must be able to uniquely identify any witness W ≠ C. Therefore, for each C, the remaining 79 people must have unique signatures in the tests that exclude C.But since the detective doesn&#39;t know C in advance, he has to design all tests such that for every possible C, the tests not involving C form a set of tests that can uniquely identify any W among the remaining 79.This sounds like the detective needs the set of tests to have the property that for any subset of tests corresponding to excluding a single person C, the remaining tests form a disjunct matrix that can identify any single defective (the witness W). In group testing terms, this would be a type of superimposed code or a code that allows for universal identification regardless of which element is excluded.But I&#39;m not sure if such codes exist with the parameters needed here (80 people, 12 tests). Let&#39;s try to estimate.If we think of each person being assigned a binary vector of length 12, where each bit indicates whether they are included in a particular test or not. Then, for any two distinct people C and W, there must be at least one test where W is included and C is not. This is equivalent to saying that the vector for W is not covered by the vector for C. In other words, the code must be such that no vector is covered by another. Here, a vector v is covered by u if whenever u has a 1, v also has a 1. If we can ensure that no two vectors have this covering property, then for any C and W, there will be a test where W is present and C is not.But actually, we need more than that. Because even if the vectors are not covered, we need that for every pair (C, W), there is at least one test where W is in the test and C is not. Which is equivalent to the set of tests forming a separating system. A separating system is a collection of subsets such that for any two distinct elements, there is a subset containing one but not the other. In our case, we need a (80, 2)-separating system, which ensures that for any two distinct elements, there is a set in the system that contains exactly one of them.The size of a separating system can be bounded. For n elements, the minimum number of subsets required for a (n, 2)-separating system is known to be on the order of log n. Specifically, it&#39;s known that the minimum number of tests m required satisfies m ≥ log₂(n(n-1)) ≈ 2 log₂ n. For n=80, log₂(80) ≈ 6.32, so 2 log₂(80) ≈ 12.64. Therefore, we might need at least 13 tests. But the problem allows 12 days. Hmm, so this suggests that it&#39;s not possible? But the answer might be yes, depending on exact constructions.Wait, but separating systems are about distinguishing every pair, but in our problem, we need that for every pair (C, W), with C ≠ W, there exists a test where W is in and C is out. Which is exactly a (2,1)-separating system, which requires that for any two distinct elements x and y, there is a set in the system that contains y but not x. The size of such a system is again related to covering codes.Alternatively, this can be thought of as a hitting set problem. For each pair (C, W), we need a test that hits W and misses C. The question is, what&#39;s the minimal number of tests needed so that every such pair is &quot;hit&quot; by at least one test.Another way: think of the problem as a hypergraph covering problem. The hypergraph has vertices as the 80 people, and hyperedges as the tests. We need to cover all pairs (C, W) with a hyperedge that includes W and excludes C. So each hyperedge S can cover all pairs (C, W) where W ∈ S and C ∉ S. The goal is to cover all such pairs with as few hyperedges as possible.The number of pairs to cover is 80*79=6320. Each test (subset S) can cover |S|*(80 - |S|) pairs. To maximize coverage, each test should be roughly half the size, but since we want to minimize the number of tests, we need an efficient covering.But this is a standard set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but we can estimate bounds. The greedy algorithm for set cover chooses the subset that covers the most uncovered pairs, then repeats. The approximation ratio is ln(n), but we are interested in the existence here, not computation.Alternatively, using probabilistic methods, what&#39;s the chance that a random subset S of size k covers a particular pair (C, W)? It&#39;s the probability that W ∈ S and C ∉ S. If each element is included independently with probability p, then the probability is p*(1 - p). To cover all pairs with high probability, we need m tests such that m * p*(1 - p) ≥ ln(6320). But this is a rough estimate.Alternatively, if we use each test with p = 1/2, then each pair has a 1/4 chance of being covered in a test. Then, the expected number of tests needed to cover all pairs is about ln(6320)/ln(1 - 1/4) ≈ ln(6320)/-ln(3/4) ≈ 8.45/0.287 ≈ 29.5. So about 30 tests. But this is way more than 12.Alternatively, if we use smaller subsets. If each test has size 80 - 1 = 79, i.e., excluding one person each day. Then, on day 1, exclude person 1, day 2 exclude person 2, etc. Then, for any pair (C, W), when we exclude C, if we include W in that day&#39;s test (which is everyone except C), so if W is included (since W ≠ C), then on day C&#39;s exclusion, the test includes W and excludes C. Thus, this would trigger a revelation on day when C is excluded, provided that the detective&#39;s test on day i is &quot;exclude i&quot;. Then, the witness W would be in all tests except the one excluding W. Wait, no.Wait, if the detective cycles through excluding each person one by one. So on day 1, invite everyone except person 1. If the criminal is person 1, then the witness, whoever they are, is in the invited group, so if the witness is not person 1, they will be there and the criminal is excluded, leading to a revelation. So if the criminal is person 1, then the witness is in the group, and the revelation happens on day 1. Similarly, if the criminal is person 2, then on day 2, when everyone except person 2 is invited, the witness (if not person 2) is present, and since criminal is excluded, the witness reveals. Therefore, in this strategy, the detective can identify the criminal in at most 80 days, by excluding one person each day. But 80 days is too much; we need to do it in 12.Therefore, this strategy is not efficient. However, if instead of excluding one person each day, the detective can exclude multiple people each day in a structured way.This is similar to binary search. If each day, the detective partitions the group into two halves and excludes one half, inviting the other half. Then, depending on whether a revelation occurs, he can narrow down the criminal to the excluded half or the witness to the invited half. But this seems like it would require log₂(80) ≈ 7 days for each, but since we need to find both, perhaps 14 days? But the problem allows 12.Alternatively, use combinatorial group testing where each test corresponds to a bit in a binary identifier. Assign each person a unique binary ID of length m, and on each day i, invite all people whose ith bit is 1. Then, after m days, the detective can use the test results to determine which IDs correspond to the criminal and witness. But how does this apply here?Wait, in standard group testing, each test result tells you whether at least one defective is present. Here, the test result is more specific: it tells you if a particular pair (witness present, criminal absent) is true. So the analogy isn&#39;t direct.But suppose the detective assigns each person a unique m-bit ID. Then, for each bit position, he creates a test where he invites everyone with a 1 in that bit. Then, over m days, he gets m test results. The criminal and witness will have their own IDs. If in a test (bit position) where the witness has a 1 and the criminal has a 0, then that test would result in a revelation, identifying the criminal. The number of bits m needs to be sufficient so that for any two IDs (C and W), there is at least one bit where W has a 1 and C has a 0. This is equivalent to the requirement that no two IDs are such that one is a superset of the other&#39;s 1s. This can be achieved if all IDs are distinct and have a certain number of 1s and 0s.But actually, to ensure that for any two distinct IDs, there is at least one position where W has 1 and C has 0, the set of IDs must form a code with the property that no two codewords are comparable under inclusion. This is similar to an antichain in the Boolean lattice. Sperner&#39;s theorem tells us that the maximum size of an antichain in the Boolean lattice of size n is C(n, floor(n/2)). But we need 80 codewords, so for m bits, we need C(m, floor(m/2)) ≥ 80. Solving for m, we find that C(8,4)=70, C(9,4)=126, so m=9 would suffice. Therefore, if we use 9-bit IDs where each ID has exactly 4 ones, then no two are comparable, so for any two IDs, there is at least one position where one has a 1 and the other has a 0. Wait, but actually, if two codewords have the same number of 1s, they can still be incomparable. For example, two different 4-element subsets of a 9-element set can be incomparable. So, Sperner&#39;s theorem says that the largest antichain in the n-dimensional Boolean lattice is C(n, floor(n/2)). So, with m=9, we can have C(9,4)=126 codewords, which is more than 80. Therefore, assigning each person a unique 9-bit ID with exactly 4 ones would ensure that for any two codewords (C and W), there is at least one bit where W has a 1 and C has a 0 (since they are incomparable). Therefore, if the detective uses these 9 tests (each corresponding to a bit position), then for any criminal and witness pair, there will be at least one test where W is included and C is excluded, leading to a revelation. Then, the criminal would be identified on that day, and the witness&#39;s ID would have a 1 in that bit position. But wait, how does the detective figure out the witness&#39;s identity?Once the criminal is identified (say on day i), the detective knows that the witness must be someone who was included in the test on day i (since the witness was present and the criminal wasn&#39;t). But the witness could be any of the people included in that test. However, since each person&#39;s ID is a unique 9-bit code with 4 ones, the witness&#39;s code must have a 1 in the position where the revelation occurred and must differ from the criminal&#39;s code in at least one other position. But how does the detective figure out who the witness is?Actually, once the criminal is identified, the detective can look at all the tests where the criminal was excluded. For those tests, if a revelation occurred, the witness must be in the intersection of all the subsets that caused a revelation (excluding the criminal). Since the witness&#39;s code has 1s in all the test positions where a revelation occurred (when the criminal was excluded), and 0s in the test positions where no revelation occurred (when the criminal was excluded). Therefore, the witness&#39;s code can be reconstructed by looking at the test results on days when the criminal was excluded. Because on days when the criminal was excluded, if the test resulted in a revelation, the witness was present (so their bit is 1), and if it didn&#39;t, the witness was absent (bit is 0). Therefore, the witness&#39;s code is exactly the vector of test results on the days when the criminal was excluded.But wait, the problem is that the detective doesn&#39;t know in advance which days the criminal was excluded. The criminal&#39;s identity is unknown until a revelation occurs. So, suppose a revelation happens on day i. Then, the detective knows that the criminal is the person identified on that day. Then, he can look at all other days and determine on which days the criminal was excluded (all days except those where the criminal was included). For each of those days, if a revelation occurred, it must have been due to the witness being present. However, there could be multiple revelations if the witness was included in multiple tests where the criminal was excluded. But the detective can then intersect the subsets of those revelation days (excluding the criminal) to find the witness.But if each person&#39;s code is unique, then the witness&#39;s code is uniquely determined by the set of days where the criminal was excluded and a revelation occurred. Since the criminal&#39;s code is known, the detective can look at all days and for each day, check if the criminal was included or not. For the days where the criminal was excluded, the test result (revelation or not) gives a bit for the witness&#39;s code. Therefore, the witness&#39;s code is exactly the vector of test results on the days when the criminal was excluded.Therefore, if the detective uses m days with each day corresponding to a bit in the code, and assigns each person a unique m-bit code, then:1. If a revelation occurs on day i, the criminal is identified as the person whose code has a 0 in bit i (since the test on day i includes the witness (who has a 1 in bit i) and excludes the criminal (who has a 0 in bit i)).2. Once the criminal is identified, the detective can look at all days and determine which days the criminal was excluded (bits where the criminal&#39;s code has 0). For those days, the test results (revelation or not) give the bits of the witness&#39;s code. Therefore, the witness&#39;s code is the vector of test results on the days where the criminal was excluded. Since all codes are unique, this uniquely identifies the witness.Therefore, the number of days needed is equal to the number of bits m required such that:- Each person has a unique m-bit code.- For any two codes (C, W), there is at least one bit where W has 1 and C has 0.As we saw earlier, using m=9 bits with codes of weight 4 allows for 126 unique codes, which is more than 80, and satisfies the condition that no code is covered by another. Therefore, 9 days would suffice. But the problem allows 12 days, which is more than 9. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the detective can definitely solve the case in 12 days.Wait, but wait. Let me verify this.If we use 9 days with this coding strategy, we can solve it. But the question is 12 days. So even safer. Alternatively, maybe a different construction.Alternatively, the detective can use the 12 days to create a binary matrix where each column is a person, each row is a day, and the entry is 1 if the person is invited on that day. The matrix must have the property that for any two distinct columns C and W, there is a row where W is 1 and C is 0. This is exactly a disjunct matrix in group testing, which allows for identification of defectives. The size of such a matrix with n columns and m rows must satisfy certain conditions.In our case, we need a matrix that is 12x80, such that for any two distinct columns, there exists a row where W has a 1 and C has a 0. This is equivalent to saying that the matrix is a (80, 1)-separating system. The required number of rows m for an (n, 1)-separating system is m ≥ log₂(n(n-1)) as we discussed before, which for n=80 is about 12.64. So 12 days would not be sufficient, but 13 days would be. Therefore, this suggests that it&#39;s not possible with 12 days.But wait, this contradicts the previous coding approach. What&#39;s the discrepancy here?In the coding approach, we required that the codes are incomparable, which can be done with m=9 days. However, in the separating system approach, the lower bound is m ≥ log₂(n(n-1)) ≈ log₂(6320) ≈ 12.64. So why is there a difference?Because the separating system requirement is weaker than the incomparable codes. A separating system only requires that for any two elements, there exists a set that contains one but not the other. In coding terms, this corresponds to for any two codewords, there exists a coordinate where one has a 1 and the other has a 0. This is a weaker condition than the codes being incomparable (which would require that neither codeword is covered by the other). Therefore, the separating system requires that for any two codewords, there is at least one coordinate where they differ in a specific way (one has 1, the other 0). The incomparable codes require that for any two codewords, there are coordinates where each has a 1 while the other has a 0. So incomparable codes are a stricter requirement, hence requiring more bits (m=9), while a separating system is a less strict requirement, theoretically achievable with fewer bits.But the lower bound for a separating system is m ≈ log₂(n(n-1)), which for n=80 is ≈12.64. Since we can&#39;t have a fraction of a day, this suggests that 13 days are required. However, the problem allows 12 days. Therefore, is it possible to construct such a separating system with 12 days?But this lower bound is not necessarily tight. It&#39;s a lower bound, meaning you can&#39;t do it with fewer than approximately 12.64 days, but in practice, the actual number might be higher. However, upper bounds can sometimes be better. For example, using probabilistic methods, you might show that with high probability, a random matrix with m=O(log n) rows is a separating system. But exact numbers vary.Wait, let&#39;s calculate the exact lower bound. The number of pairs (C, W) is 80*79=6320. Each test (row) can cover (number of people in the test) * (number of people not in the test) pairs. To cover all 6320 pairs, with m tests, each covering up to k*(80 - k) pairs, where k is the size of the test. The maximum coverage per test is when k=40, giving 40*40=1600 pairs. To cover 6320 pairs, you would need at least 6320/1600 ≈4 tests. But this is a rough upper bound. However, this doesn&#39;t account for overlap between tests.But in reality, it&#39;s more efficient to structure the tests so that each pair is covered by at least one test. The information-theoretic lower bound is log₂(6320) ≈12.64, so 13 bits. This suggests that 13 days are needed. Therefore, with 12 days, it might not be possible.However, in practice, using a specific construction like the binary identification approach with m=12, even if slightly below the lower bound, might work. Wait, how does that work?If the detective assigns each person a unique 12-bit ID, ensuring that for any two IDs, there is at least one bit where they differ. But we need more than that: we need for any two people C and W, there&#39;s a bit where W is 1 and C is 0. This is equivalent to the negation of the following: there exist two people C and W such that wherever W has a 1, C also has a 1. That is, W&#39;s code is a subset of C&#39;s code. To prevent this, we need that the code is a separating system.However, the number of possible 12-bit codes is 2¹²=4096, which is more than 80, so we can assign unique codes. However, the question is whether we can assign 80 codes such that for any two, there&#39;s a bit where W has 1 and C has 0. This is equivalent to the codes not being contained in each other. Wait, no. It&#39;s equivalent to the codes not being such that W&#39;s code is a subset of C&#39;s code. But actually, even if W&#39;s code is not a subset of C&#39;s code, there could still be some bits where W has 1 and C has 0. Wait, no. If W&#39;s code is not a subset of C&#39;s code, then there exists at least one bit where W has 1 and C has 0. Therefore, the code just needs to be such that no code is a subset of another. Therefore, if we assign 80 codes of 12 bits such that none is a subset of another, then we&#39;re good. This is the same as an antichain in the Boolean lattice. Sperner&#39;s theorem tells us that the maximum size of an antichain in the n-dimensional Boolean lattice is C(n, floor(n/2)). For n=12, the maximum antichain is C(12,6)=924, which is way more than 80. Therefore, it&#39;s possible to select 80 codes of 12 bits such that none is a subset of another. Therefore, such a code assignment would allow the detective to test each bit position, and guarantee that for any C and W, there is a test where W is present and C is not.Therefore, with 12 days, assigning each person a unique 12-bit code from an antichain (no two codes are subsets), and testing each bit position by inviting all people with a 1 in that position, the detective can ensure that for any criminal and witness pair, there will be a day where the witness is present and the criminal is not, leading to a revelation. Once the criminal is identified, the detective can look at the test results on all days when the criminal was excluded (i.e., days where the criminal&#39;s code has a 0) and the witness&#39;s code will be the vector of test results on those days. Since all codes are unique and not subsets of each other, this will uniquely identify the witness.Therefore, yes, it is possible for the detective to solve the case in 12 days.&lt;/think&gt;The detective can solve the case in 12 days using a combinatorial strategy. By assigning each person a unique 12-bit identifier such that no identifier is a subset of another (an antichain), the detective tests each bit position by inviting all individuals with a &#39;1&#39; in that position. For any criminal-witness pair, there will be a day where the witness is included and the criminal excluded, prompting the witness to reveal the criminal. Once identified, the witness is determined by the test results on days the criminal was excluded. This method ensures both the criminal and witness are uniquely identified within 12 days.Answer: boxed{Yes}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-817cadee></div><p class="review-content" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>🔑:</span>The first method. We will number 80 suspects with four-digit ternary numbers overline{a b c d} from 0001 to 2222 (there are exactly 3^{4}-1=80 such numbers).On the k-th day (k=1,2, ldots, 12), Nero Wolfe invites those suspects whose numbers satisfy the k-th of the equalities a=0, a=1, a=2,b=0, b=1, b=2, c=0, c=1, c=2, d=0, d=1, d=2. Then, on one of these days, he will invite the witness, but will not invite the criminal, since their numbers differ in at least one digit.The second method. We will divide the suspects into 16 groups of 5 people each. We will number the groups with four-digit binary numbers overline{a b c d} from 0000 to 1111, and we will number the members of each group from 1 to 5.On the k-th day (k=1,2, ldots, 8), Nero Wolfe invites suspects from groups whose numbers satisfy the k-th of the equalities: a=0, a=1,b=0, b=1, c=0, c=1, d=0, d=1. If the criminal and the witness are in different groups, the crime will be solved on one of these days.Suppose the witness is in the same group as the criminal. Let m and n be the numbers of the witness and the criminal in this group, respectively. On the 9th day, Nero Wolfe invites suspects with numbers 1 and 2 from each group, on the 10th day - suspects with numbers 3 and 4, on the 11th day - suspects with numbers 1, 3, and 5, and on the 12th day - suspects with numbers 2, 4, and 5. Then there will be one of these days when suspects with number m are invited from each group, but suspects with number n are not invited. This means that on this day, the crime will be solved.The third method. We will show that Nero Wolfe can find the criminal even in 9 days. For this, we will assign each suspect a number - a nine-digit binary number, four digits of which are ones, and five are zeros (this is possible since there are C_{9}^{4}=126 such numbers).On the k-th day (k=1,2, ldots, 9), Nero Wolfe invites those suspects whose k-th digit of the number is 1. Since all numbers contain exactly 4 ones, there will be a number m from 1 to 9 such that the witness has a 1 in the m-th place, and the criminal has a 0. This means that on the m-th day, the witness will be invited to Nero Wolfe without the criminal, and the crime will be solved.## AnswerYes.Submit a comment</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-fe07697a data-v-817cadee><div class="review" data-v-817cadee><div class="review-title" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>❓:</span>The sum 29+12+23 is equal to(A) 6^{2}(B) 4^{4}(C) 8^{8}(D) 64^{0}(E) 2^{6}</div><div class="divider" data-v-817cadee></div><p class="review-content" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is asking what the sum of 29, 12, and 23 equals, and then gives five options labeled (A) through (E), each of which is a different exponentiation expression. The options are: (A) 6²  (B) 4⁴  (C) 8⁸  (D) 64⁰  (E) 2⁶  First, I need to compute the sum of 29, 12, and 23. Let me do that step by step to make sure I don&#39;t make a mistake. Starting with 29 and adding 12. Hmm, 29 + 12. Let&#39;s break it down: 20 + 10 is 30, and 9 + 2 is 11. Then, 30 + 11 is 41. So, 29 + 12 equals 41. Now, add the next number, which is 23, to this result. So, 41 + 23. Breaking it down again: 40 + 20 is 60, and 1 + 3 is 4. Then, 60 + 4 equals 64. So, the total sum of 29 + 12 + 23 is 64. Okay, so the problem is now asking which of the given options is equal to 64. Each option is a different exponent. Let me check each one by one.Starting with option (A): 6². That means 6 multiplied by 6. 6 times 6 is 36. So, 6² equals 36. But 36 is not 64, so (A) is not the correct answer.Next, option (B): 4⁴. That&#39;s 4 raised to the fourth power. Let&#39;s compute that. 4 multiplied by 4 is 16. Then, 16 multiplied by 4 is 64. Then, 64 multiplied by 4 is 256. So, 4⁴ equals 256, which is much larger than 64. So, (B) is not the answer either.Moving on to option (C): 8⁸. That&#39;s 8 to the eighth power. Hmm, that&#39;s going to be a huge number. 8 squared is 64, 8 cubed is 512, and each subsequent power just keeps increasing exponentially. So, 8⁸ is definitely way larger than 64. So, (C) is out.Option (D): 64⁰. Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, 64⁰ equals 1. But 1 is not 64, so (D) isn&#39;t correct either.Lastly, option (E): 2⁶. Let&#39;s calculate that. 2 to the sixth power. 2 multiplied by itself six times: 2 × 2 is 4, ×2 is 8, ×2 is 16, ×2 is 32, ×2 is 64. So, 2⁶ equals 64. Therefore, the sum 29 + 12 + 23 is 64, which is equal to 2⁶, so the correct answer must be option (E).Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Adding 29, 12, and 23 again: 29 + 12 is indeed 41, and 41 + 23 is 64. Then, checking the exponents again:6² is 36, 4⁴ is 256, 8⁸ is way too big, 64⁰ is 1, and 2⁶ is 64. Yep, everything checks out. So, I&#39;m confident that the answer is (E).Final Answerboxed{E}&lt;/think&gt;The sum of (29 + 12 + 23) is calculated as follows:First, add (29) and (12):[29 + 12 = 41]Next, add the result to (23):[41 + 23 = 64]Now, we compare this result to the given options:- (A) (6^2 = 36)- (B) (4^4 = 256)- (C) (8^8) (a very large number, much larger than 64)- (D) (64^0 = 1)- (E) (2^6 = 64)The correct option is (E) (2^6), which equals 64.[boxed{E}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to figure out which of the options A through E is equal to the sum of 29, 12, and 23. Let me start by adding those numbers together first. So, 29 plus 12. Hmm, 29 plus 10 is 39, and then adding 2 more would make it 41. Then, I need to add 23 to that result. Let me break that down too. 41 plus 20 is 61, and then adding 3 gives me 64. So, the total sum is 64. Now, I need to check which of the options equals 64. Let me go through each option one by one. Option A is 6 squared. 6 times 6 is 36. Hmm, that&#39;s not 64. So A is out. Option B is 4 to the fourth power. Let&#39;s calculate that. 4 times 4 is 16, then 16 times 4 is 64, and 64 times 4 is 256. So 4^4 is 256, which is way bigger than 64. So B isn&#39;t correct either.Option C is 8 to the eighth power. Wow, that&#39;s going to be a huge number. 8 times 8 is 64, but then you keep multiplying by 8 six more times. Definitely way larger than 64. So C is not the answer.Option D is 64 to the power of 0. Any number to the power of 0 is 1, right? So 64^0 is 1. That&#39;s not 64. So D is out.Option E is 2 to the sixth power. Let&#39;s calculate that. 2 multiplied by itself six times. 2 times 2 is 4, times 2 is 8, times 2 is 16, times 2 is 32, times 2 is 64. So 2^6 equals 64. That matches the sum we calculated earlier. Let me double-check everything to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes. The sum: 29 + 12 is indeed 41, and 41 + 23 is 64. Then, the options: 6^2=36, 4^4=256, 8^8 is huge, 64^0=1, and 2^6=64. Yep, looks like E is the correct answer. I don&#39;t think I missed anything here. Final Answerboxed{E}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which option is equal to the sum (29 + 12 + 23):1. Calculate the sum:   [   29 + 12 = 41   ]   [   41 + 23 = 64   ]2. Check each option:   - Option A: (6^2 = 36)   - Option B: (4^4 = 256)   - Option C: (8^8) (a very large number, much greater than 64)   - Option D: (64^0 = 1)   - Option E: (2^6 = 64)The sum (29 + 12 + 23 = 64) matches (2^6).[boxed{E}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-817cadee></div><p class="review-content" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>🔑:</span>The sum 29+12+23 is equal to(A) 6^{2}(B) 4^{4}(C) 8^{8}(D) 64^{0}(E) 2^{6}Solution29+12+23=64=2^{6}ANSWER: (E)</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-fe07697a data-v-817cadee><div class="review" data-v-817cadee><div class="review-title" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>❓:</span>Triangle ABC is inscribed in circle omega with AB=5, BC=7, and AC=3.

Hmm, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The sides are AB=5, BC=7, and AC=3. The angle bisector of angle A meets BC at D and the circle ω again at E. Then γ is the circle with diameter DE, and ω and γ intersect again at F. We need to find AF², which is a fraction m/n, and then compute m + n where m and n are coprime. Okay, let me start breaking this down.First, maybe drawing a diagram would help. But since I can&#39;t draw here, I&#39;ll visualize it. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=7, AC=3. So sides are known. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The angle bisector of angle A meets BC at D. Then, since E is the other intersection point of the angle bisector with ω, E is the point diametrically opposite to A if the angle bisector were a diameter, but it&#39;s not necessarily. Then, γ is the circle with diameter DE. The circles ω and γ meet at E and another point F. Then we need AF².Let me recall some theorems that might help here. Since AD is the angle bisector of angle A, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = 5/3. Since BC is 7, then BD = (5/8)*7 = 35/8 and DC = 21/8. So BD=35/8, DC=21/8. That&#39;s straightforward.Now, point E is the second intersection of the angle bisector with the circumcircle ω. So AE is a chord of ω that is the angle bisector. There might be some properties about angle bisectors intersecting circumcircles. Maybe using power of a point, or cyclic quadrilaterals. Alternatively, since E is on the circumcircle, maybe some properties related to that.Then, circle γ has diameter DE. So the center of γ is the midpoint of DE, and its radius is half of DE. The circle γ intersects ω again at F, so F is the other intersection point. Then AF² is to be found.Possible approaches: Coordinates? Maybe place the triangle in coordinate system to compute coordinates of all points. Alternatively, use inversion or projective geometry, but since this is likely a problem solvable with classical geometry, maybe using power of a point, similar triangles, intersecting chords theorem, etc.Alternatively, use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let&#39;s set up coordinate system.Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me let AB lie along the x-axis, so point B is at (5,0). Then point C is somewhere in the plane. Given that AC=3 and BC=7. So coordinates of C: Let’s denote C as (x,y). Then distance from A to C is √(x² + y²) = 3, so x² + y² = 9. Distance from B to C is √((x - 5)² + y²) = 7, so (x - 5)² + y² = 49. Subtract the first equation from the second:(x - 5)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 49 - 9 → x² -10x +25 + y² -x² - y² = 40 → -10x +25 = 40 → -10x = 15 → x = -1.5. So x = -3/2.Then plug back x into x² + y² = 9: (9/4) + y² = 9 → y² = 9 - 9/4 = 27/4 → y = ±(3√3)/2. Let&#39;s take y positive, so C is (-3/2, (3√3)/2). So coordinates:A: (0,0)B: (5,0)C: (-3/2, (3√3)/2)Now, angle bisector from A meets BC at D. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = 5/3. So BD = 35/8, DC =21/8 as before. Coordinates of D: Since BC is from B(5,0) to C(-3/2, (3√3)/2). Let me parametrize BC.Parametric equations for BC: Let t be the parameter from B to C. So starting at B(5,0) when t=0 and reaching C(-3/2, (3√3)/2) when t=1. The vector from B to C is (-3/2 -5, (3√3)/2 -0) = (-13/2, (3√3)/2). So the parametric coordinates are (5 - (13/2)t, 0 + (3√3)/2 t).We need to find t such that BD/DC = 5/3. Since BD = 35/8 and BC=7, which is 56/8. So BD =35/8, DC=21/8. So t corresponds to the fraction BD/BC = (35/8)/7 = 35/56 = 5/8. So t=5/8? Wait, but in parametrization from B to C with t=0 at B and t=1 at C, the length is BC=7. So if BD=35/8, then the parameter t would be BD/BC = (35/8)/7 = 5/8. Therefore, t=5/8. So coordinates of D are:x = 5 - (13/2)(5/8) = 5 - (65/16) = (80/16 - 65/16) = 15/16y = 0 + (3√3)/2*(5/8) = (15√3)/16Therefore, D is (15/16, 15√3/16)Now, angle bisector AE. We need to find point E on the circumcircle ω, along the angle bisector from A. Since A is at (0,0), and the angle bisector goes through D, so the line AD is parameterizable. Let&#39;s find parametric equations for AD.Vector from A(0,0) to D(15/16, 15√3/16). So the direction vector is (15/16, 15√3/16), which can be simplified to (1, √3). Therefore, the parametric equations for AD (and extended to E) are x = t, y = t√3, where t is a parameter. When t=15/16, we reach D. Then E is another intersection point of this line with the circumcircle ω. Since A is on ω, E is the other intersection.So we need to find t ≠0 such that (t)^2 + (t√3)^2 = (radius of ω)^2? Wait, no. The circumcircle ω passes through A, B, C. So we need to find E on line AD (parametric equations x=t, y=t√3) such that E is on ω. So substituting into the equation of ω.First, let&#39;s find the equation of ω. The circumcircle of triangle ABC with coordinates A(0,0), B(5,0), C(-3/2, 3√3/2). Let&#39;s compute the circumcircle equation.The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in A(0,0):0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 → F=0.Plugging in B(5,0):25 +0 +5D +0 +0=0 → 25 +5D =0 → D= -5.Plugging in C(-3/2, 3√3/2):(9/4) + (27/4) + (-3/2)D + (3√3/2)E +0=0.So (36/4) + (-3/2)(-5) + (3√3/2)E =0 → 9 + (15/2) + (3√3/2)E =0 → (15/2 +9) + (3√3/2)E =0. Wait, 9 is 18/2, so total is (15/2 +18/2)=33/2. So 33/2 + (3√3/2)E =0 → (3√3/2)E = -33/2 → E= (-33/2)/(3√3/2)= -11/√3= -11√3/3.Therefore, the equation of ω is x² + y² -5x - (11√3/3)y =0.Now, parametric equations for AE are x = t, y = t√3. Substitute into the circle equation:t² + (t²*3) -5t - (11√3/3)(t√3) =0Simplify:t² +3t² -5t - (11√3/3)(t√3)=04t² -5t - (11*3/3)t=04t² -5t -11t=04t² -16t=0t(4t -16)=0So t=0 (point A) or t=16/4=4. So t=4. Therefore, point E is at (4, 4√3).So coordinates:E: (4, 4√3)Now, circle γ has diameter DE. So we need coordinates of D and E. D is (15/16, 15√3/16), E is (4,4√3). The midpoint of DE is the center of γ, and the radius is half of DE.First, compute midpoint M of DE:x-coordinate: (15/16 +4)/2 = (15/16 +64/16)/2 = (79/16)/2 = 79/32y-coordinate: (15√3/16 +4√3)/2 = (15√3/16 +64√3/16)/2 = (79√3/16)/2 =79√3/32So center M is (79/32,79√3/32)Now, compute DE length. First, compute differences:Δx =4 -15/16=64/16 -15/16=49/16Δy=4√3 -15√3/16=64√3/16 -15√3/16=49√3/16So DE=√[(49/16)^2 + (49√3/16)^2]=√[49²/16² (1 +3)]=√[49²*4/16²]=√[49²/(16²/4)]=√[49²/(64)]=49/8Therefore, DE=49/8, so radius of γ is 49/16.Thus, equation of circle γ: (x -79/32)^2 + (y -79√3/32)^2 = (49/16)^2.Now, we need to find intersection points of ω and γ. We know they intersect at E(4,4√3) and F. So we need to find coordinates of F.First, write equations of both circles:ω: x² + y² -5x - (11√3/3)y =0γ: (x -79/32)^2 + (y -79√3/32)^2 = (49/16)^2We can solve these two equations to find points E and F. Since E is already known, we can find F by solving the system.Alternatively, subtract the equations to find the radical line, which is the line EF. Then parametrize this line and find the other intersection point.First, expand the equation of γ:(x -79/32)^2 + (y -79√3/32)^2 = (49/16)^2Expanding:x² - (2*79/32)x + (79/32)^2 + y² - (2*79√3/32)y + (79√3/32)^2 = (49/16)^2Simplify:x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y + (79²/32² + 79²*3/32²) = 49²/16²Note that (79²/32²)(1 +3) = 4*79²/32² =79²/(8²*16)= wait, perhaps compute the constants:First term: (79/32)^2 = 6241/1024Second term: (79√3/32)^2 = 79² *3 /1024 = 3*6241/1024So total constants: 6241/1024 +3*6241/1024=4*6241/1024=6241/256Thus, the equation becomes:x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +6241/256 = 2401/256Then, subtract 2401/256:x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +6241/256 -2401/256 =0Simplify constants: 6241 -2401= 3840, so 3840/256=15. So equation:x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +15=0Now, subtract the equation of ω from this equation:(x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +15) - (x² + y² -5x - (11√3/3)y)=0Simplify:- (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +15 - (-5x - (11√3/3)y)=0So:-79/16 x +5x -79√3/16 y +11√3/3 y +15=0Compute coefficients:For x terms: (-79/16 +5)x = (-79/16 +80/16)x= (1/16)xFor y terms: (-79√3/16 +11√3/3)y = √3(-79/16 +11/3)y = √3((-237 +176)/48)y = √3(-61/48)yThus, the equation becomes:(1/16)x - (61√3/48)y +15=0Multiply both sides by 48 to eliminate denominators:3x -61√3 y +720=0Thus, the radical line EF is 3x -61√3 y +720=0.But we know E(4,4√3) lies on this line. Let&#39;s check:3*4 -61√3*4√3 +720=12 -61*12 +720=12 -732 +720=0. Correct.Now, parametric equations of radical line EF: Let&#39;s express in terms of x or y. Let&#39;s solve for x:3x =61√3 y -720 → x= (61√3 y -720)/3= (61√3/3)y -240But maybe parameterizing with a parameter s. Let’s set y = s, then x= (61√3/3)s -240. But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, since E is on the line, we can parametrize from E.Since EF is the radical line, and we need the other intersection point F. Since E is (4,4√3), maybe parameterizing the line as follows.Direction vector of radical line: coefficients from the equation 3x -61√3 y +720=0. So direction vector is (61√3, 3). Wait, because the line equation Ax + By +C=0 has direction vector (B, -A). So here, A=3, B=-61√3, so direction vector is (61√3,3). But let me confirm. If the equation is 3x -61√3 y +720=0, then direction vector perpendicular to (3, -61√3). So direction vector parallel to (61√3,3). Yes.Therefore, parametrize from E(4,4√3) along direction vector (61√3,3). Let’s let parameter k, so points on the line are (4 +61√3 k, 4√3 +3k). Then, this parametric line intersects both circles ω and γ. Since E is one intersection, F is the other. So we can substitute into ω’s equation and solve for k.Equation of ω: x² + y² -5x - (11√3/3)y =0Substitute x=4 +61√3 k, y=4√3 +3k.Compute x²: (4 +61√3 k)^2=16 + 488√3 k + (61√3 k)^2=16 +488√3 k +61²*3 k²=16 +488√3 k +3*3721 k²=16 +488√3 k +11163 k²y²: (4√3 +3k)^2=16*3 +24√3 k +9k²=48 +24√3 k +9k²-5x: -5*(4 +61√3 k)= -20 -305√3 k-(11√3/3)y: -(11√3/3)*(4√3 +3k)= -(11√3/3)*4√3 - (11√3/3)*3k= -11*4*3/3 -11√3 k= -44 -11√3 kCombine all terms:(16 +488√3 k +11163 k²) + (48 +24√3 k +9k²) + (-20 -305√3 k) + (-44 -11√3 k) =0Compute term by term:Constants: 16 +48 -20 -44=0k terms:√3 k terms: 488√3 k +24√3 k -305√3 k -11√3 k= (488 +24 -305 -11)√3 k= (512 -316)√3 k=196√3 kk² terms:11163k² +9k²=11172k²So equation becomes 196√3 k +11172k²=0Factor out k:k(196√3 +11172k)=0Solutions: k=0, which corresponds to E, and 196√3 +11172k=0 → k= -196√3 /11172=Simplify:Divide numerator and denominator by 4: -49√3 /27932793 divided by 49: 2793 ÷49=57 (since 49*50=2450, 49*57=2450+343=2793)So k= -49√3 /2793= -√3 /57Thus, the other intersection point F is when k= -√3 /57:x=4 +61√3*(-√3 /57)=4 -61*3/57=4 -183/57=4 - (183/57)=4 - (61/19)= (76/19 -61/19)=15/19y=4√3 +3*(-√3 /57)=4√3 - (3√3)/57=4√3 - √3/19= (76√3/19 -√3/19)=75√3/19Therefore, coordinates of F are (15/19,75√3/19)Now, we need to compute AF². Since A is at (0,0), the distance from A to F is sqrt[(15/19)^2 + (75√3/19)^2]Compute this squared:AF²= (15/19)^2 + (75√3/19)^2= (225/361) + (5625*3)/361=225/361 +16875/361=17100/361Simplify 17100/361. Let&#39;s check if 17100 and 361 have common factors. 361 is 19²=361. 17100 divided by 19: 17100 ÷19= 17100/19=900. So 17100=19*900=19*19* (900/19)= but wait 900 divided by19 is 47.368… which is not integer. Wait, wait: 17100 ÷ 361=17100 ÷ (19²)= (17100 ÷19)=900 ÷19= approximately 47.368. Wait, but 17100 divided by 361: 361*47=16967, 17100-16967=133. 361*0.37≈133. So it&#39;s 47.37, not integer. Therefore, 17100 and 361: since 361 is 19², check if 19 divides 17100. 17100 ÷19= 17100/19=900. So 17100=19*900. 900=19*47 +7, so 19 does not divide 900. Therefore, 17100 and 361 share a common factor of 19. So 17100/361= (19*900)/(19²)=900/19. Therefore, AF²=900/19.Wait, let me confirm:Wait, AF²=(15/19)^2 + (75√3/19)^2= (225 + 5625*3)/361= (225 +16875)/361=17100/361. Then, 17100 ÷19= 900, 361 ÷19=19. So 17100/361=900/19. Yes, because 17100=19*900 and 361=19². Therefore, AF²=900/19. Since 900 and 19 are coprime (19 is prime and doesn&#39;t divide 900), so m=900, n=19, m+n=919.Final Answerboxed{919}&lt;/think&gt;Given triangle (ABC) with (AB = 5), (BC = 7), and (AC = 3), we need to find (AF^2) where (F) is the second intersection point of the circumcircle (omega) of (ABC) and the circle (gamma) with diameter (DE). Here, (D) is the point where the angle bisector of (angle A) meets (BC), and (E) is the second intersection of this angle bisector with (omega).1. Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:   - (BD/DC = AB/AC = 5/3)   - (BD = 35/8) and (DC = 21/8)2. Coordinates of Points:   - Place (A) at ((0, 0)), (B) at ((5, 0)), and (C) at ((-3/2, 3sqrt{3}/2))   - Coordinates of (D) found by parametrizing (BC) and using (BD/BC = 5/8):     - (D = (15/16, 15sqrt{3}/16))3. Finding Point (E):   - Parametric equations for line (AD) (angle bisector) intersect the circumcircle (omega) again at (E):     - Solving the circumcircle equation, (E) is found at ((4, 4sqrt{3}))4. Circle (gamma) with Diameter (DE):   - Midpoint of (DE) is ((79/32, 79sqrt{3}/32))   - Radius of (gamma) is (49/16)5. Finding Intersection (F):   - Solving the system of equations for circles (omega) and (gamma), we find (F) at ((15/19, 75sqrt{3}/19))6. Calculating (AF^2):   - Distance squared from (A(0, 0)) to (F(15/19, 75sqrt{3}/19)):     - (AF^2 = left(frac{15}{19}right)^2 + left(frac{75sqrt{3}}{19}right)^2 = frac{225 + 16875}{361} = frac{17100}{361} = frac{900}{19})Thus, (m = 900) and (n = 19), leading to (m + n = 919).(boxed{919}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 7, and AC is 3. The angle bisector of angle A meets BC at D and then meets the circle ω again at E. Then there&#39;s another circle γ, which has DE as its diameter. The circles ω and γ intersect again at a point F, and we need to find AF², which is equal to m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.Alright, let&#39;s start by drawing triangle ABC with the given side lengths. AB = 5, BC = 7, AC = 3. Hmm, first thought: maybe use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find BD and DC? Since AD is the angle bisector of angle A, it should divide BC into segments proportional to AB and AC. So BD/DC = AB/AC = 5/3. Since BC is 7, let me set BD = 5k and DC = 3k. Then 5k + 3k = 8k = 7, so k = 7/8. Therefore, BD = 35/8 and DC = 21/8. Okay, so D divides BC into BD = 35/8 and DC = 21/8. Got that.Now, point E is the second intersection of the angle bisector AE with the circumcircle ω. So, AE is a chord of ω passing through A and E, with E on ω. Then circle γ has diameter DE. So, DE is the diameter of γ, meaning that the center of γ is the midpoint of DE, and the radius is half of DE.We need to find the other intersection point F of ω and γ, and then compute AF².Hmm. Let me recall that when two circles intersect at two points, the line joining those two points is their radical axis. So, EF is the radical axis of ω and γ. But maybe that&#39;s not directly helpful here. Alternatively, since γ has diameter DE, any point on γ will satisfy that the angle DFE is a right angle? Wait, no, because if DE is the diameter, then any point F on γ will make angle DFE a right angle. Wait, actually, yes! Because in a circle with diameter DE, any point F on the circle will form a right angle with DE, so ∠DFE = 90°. So, ∠DFE is 90°.Therefore, in triangle DFE, angle at F is 90°. So, DF is perpendicular to FE. But F is also on the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. So, point F is such that it&#39;s on ω and γ, so ∠DFE = 90°, and AF is the segment from A to F whose square we need to compute.This seems a bit abstract. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here? Let me set up coordinates. Alternatively, use power of a point, similar triangles, properties of angle bisectors, cyclic quadrilaterals, etc.Alternatively, since E is on the circumcircle, and AE is the angle bisector, maybe some properties related to that. Let me recall that when an angle bisector meets the circumcircle, there might be some known relations. For instance, in triangle ABC, if AE is the angle bisector, then E is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A? Wait, no, that&#39;s if it&#39;s the symmedian or something. Wait, actually, the angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle at the midpoint of arc BC that contains A? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.In a triangle, the angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle at the midpoint of arc BC that doesn&#39;t contain A. Wait, is that true? Hmm. Let me recall. The angle bisector of angle A divides BC in the ratio of the adjacent sides. But the arc midpoint divides the arc into two equal arcs. So, perhaps the angle bisector and the arc midpoint are different points unless the triangle is isoceles. So, in this case, since the triangle is scalene (5, 7, 3), the angle bisector will meet the circumcircle at a different point than the arc midpoint.But maybe there&#39;s a relation between E and the arcs. Alternatively, perhaps use power of a point with respect to γ. Since F is on both circles, power of point F with respect to both circles could be related. But maybe that&#39;s too vague.Alternatively, inversion? Not sure.Alternatively, use coordinates. Let&#39;s try coordinate geometry.Let me place triangle ABC in coordinate plane. Let me set point B at (0,0), point C at (7,0). Then point A is somewhere such that AB = 5 and AC = 3. Let me find coordinates of A.So, coordinates: B (0,0), C (7,0). Let A be (x,y). Then distance from A to B is 5: √(x² + y²) = 5. Distance from A to C is 3: √((x - 7)² + y²) = 3.So, equations:x² + y² = 25,(x - 7)² + y² = 9.Subtract the first equation from the second:(x - 7)² + y² - x² - y² = 9 - 25Expanding (x - 7)² = x² - 14x + 49,So x² - 14x + 49 - x² = -14x + 49 = -16Therefore, -14x + 49 = -16 → -14x = -65 → x = 65/14.Then x = 65/14. Plugging back into x² + y² = 25:(65/14)² + y² = 25.Calculate (65/14)^2: 65² = 4225, 14² = 196, so 4225/196 + y² = 25.25 is 4900/196. So y² = 4900/196 - 4225/196 = 675/196.Therefore, y = √(675/196) = (15√3)/14.Therefore, coordinates of A are (65/14, 15√3/14). That&#39;s a bit messy, but manageable.Now, point D is on BC, which is from (0,0) to (7,0). We already found BD = 35/8, so D is located at x = BD = 35/8, y = 0. So coordinates of D are (35/8, 0).Now, we need to find point E, which is the second intersection of angle bisector AE with the circumcircle ω. Since AE is the angle bisector, which we already have as AD extended to E on ω.Wait, but in our coordinate system, A is (65/14, 15√3/14), D is (35/8, 0). Let&#39;s confirm if AD is indeed the angle bisector.Wait, in the problem statement, the angle bisector of angle A meets BC at D, which we computed using the Angle Bisector Theorem. So, the line AD is the angle bisector, and E is the other intersection of this bisector with ω.Therefore, parametrize line AE (which passes through A and D) and find its other intersection with ω.First, find the parametric equation of line AD. Since it goes from A (65/14, 15√3/14) to D (35/8, 0). Let&#39;s compute the direction vector.Compute coordinates difference: x-coordinate: 35/8 - 65/14. Let&#39;s convert to common denominator 56.35/8 = 245/56, 65/14 = 260/56. So difference is 245/56 - 260/56 = -15/56.y-coordinate: 0 - 15√3/14 = -15√3/14.So the direction vector is (-15/56, -15√3/14). We can simplify this by factoring out -15/14:Direction vector: (-15/14)(1/4, √3). So, direction vector is proportional to (1/4, √3). Let me write parametric equations for line AD.Parametric equations starting from A:x = 65/14 + t*( -15/56 )y = 15√3/14 + t*( -15√3/14 )We can write this as:x = 65/14 - (15/56)ty = 15√3/14 - (15√3/14)tWe can factor out 15/14 in both:x = 65/14 - (15/56)t = 65/14 - (15/14)(t/4)y = 15√3/14 (1 - t)Alternatively, parameter t can be scaled. Let me choose parameter s such that when s=0, we are at A, and when s=1, we reach D.So from A to D, the parameter s goes from 0 to 1.Then:x = 65/14 + s*(35/8 - 65/14)Similarly for y.Compute 35/8 - 65/14: convert to common denominator 56:35/8 = 245/56, 65/14 = 260/56. So difference is 245/56 - 260/56 = -15/56.Similarly, y-coordinate difference: 0 - 15√3/14 = -15√3/14.Therefore, parametric equations:x = 65/14 - (15/56)sy = 15√3/14 - (15√3/14)sSo when s = 0, we are at A, s = 1 at D. To find E, we need to extend the line beyond D (since E is the second intersection with ω, and A is already on ω). So E is another point on line AD beyond D. So we can parametrize beyond s = 1.So E corresponds to some s &gt; 1. Let&#39;s find the value of s where this line intersects ω again.The equation of ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can find the equation of ω.Points on ω: A (65/14, 15√3/14), B (0,0), C (7,0). Let&#39;s find the equation of the circumcircle.General equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.Plug in B (0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 ⇒ F = 0.So equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.Plug in point C (7,0): 49 + 0 + 7D + 0 = 0 ⇒ 7D = -49 ⇒ D = -7.Plug in point A (65/14, 15√3/14):(65/14)² + (15√3/14)^2 + (-7)(65/14) + E(15√3/14) = 0.Compute each term:(65/14)^2 = (4225)/196,(15√3/14)^2 = (225*3)/196 = 675/196,-7*(65/14) = -455/14 = -65/2,E*(15√3/14) remains as is.So sum:4225/196 + 675/196 - 65/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0.Combine fractions:(4225 + 675)/196 - 65/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0 ⇒ 4900/196 - 65/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0.4900/196 = 25.So 25 - 65/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0.25 - 32.5 = -7.5 = -15/2.Therefore:-15/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0 ⇒ (15√3/14)E = 15/2 ⇒ E = (15/2) / (15√3/14) = (15/2) * (14)/(15√3) = (14)/(2√3) = 7/√3 = 7√3/3.Therefore, the equation of ω is x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y = 0.Now, we can substitute the parametric equations of line AD into the circle equation to find points of intersection.Parametric equations:x = 65/14 - (15/56)s,y = 15√3/14 - (15√3/14)s.Plug into x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y = 0.First, compute x²:(65/14 - 15s/56)^2 = [ (65*4 - 15s)/56 ]^2 = [ (260 - 15s)/56 ]^2 = (260 - 15s)^2 / 3136.Similarly, y²:[15√3/14 (1 - s)]^2 = (225*3)/196 (1 - s)^2 = 675/196 (1 - s)^2.Compute -7x:-7*(65/14 - 15s/56) = -7*( (65*4 - 15s)/56 ) = -7*(260 - 15s)/56 = - (1820 - 105s)/56 = (-1820 + 105s)/56.Compute (7√3/3)y:(7√3/3)*(15√3/14 (1 - s)) = (7√3 *15√3)/(3*14) (1 - s) = (105*3)/(42) (1 - s) = (315)/42 (1 - s) = 15/2 (1 - s).Now, putting all together:x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y = 0:(260 - 15s)^2 / 3136 + 675/196 (1 - s)^2 + (-1820 + 105s)/56 + (15/2)(1 - s) = 0.This seems complicated. Let me compute each term step by step.First term: (260 - 15s)^2 / 3136Expand numerator: (260)^2 - 2*260*15s + (15s)^2 = 67600 - 7800s + 225s².Divide by 3136: (67600 - 7800s + 225s²)/3136.Second term: 675/196 (1 - s)^2 = 675/196*(1 - 2s + s²) = 675/196 - 1350/196 s + 675/196 s².Third term: (-1820 + 105s)/56 = -1820/56 + 105s/56 = -32.5 + (105/56)s. Wait, 1820 divided by 56: 56*32 = 1792, 1820 - 1792 = 28, so 1820/56 = 32.5. So it&#39;s -32.5 + (105/56)s.Fourth term: 15/2 (1 - s) = 15/2 - 15/2 s.So combining all terms:First term: (67600 - 7800s + 225s²)/3136Second term: 675/196 - 1350/196 s + 675/196 s²Third term: -32.5 + (105/56)sFourth term: 15/2 - 15/2 sLet me convert all terms to have denominator 3136 for ease of addition.First term is already over 3136.Second term: 675/196 = (675*16)/3136 = 10800/3136Similarly, -1350/196 s = (-1350*16)/3136 s = -21600/3136 s675/196 s² = 10800/3136 s²Third term: -32.5 = -65/2 = (-65/2)*(16/16) = -520/32, but wait, better convert to over 3136:-32.5 = -65/2 = (-65/2)*(1568/1568) = (-65*784)/3136. Wait, this is getting messy. Alternatively, convert -32.5 to a fraction over 3136.-32.5 = -65/2. Multiply numerator and denominator by 1568 (since 2*1568=3136):-65/2 = (-65*1568)/3136 = (-65*1568)/3136. Compute 65*1568: 65*1500=97500, 65*68=4420, so total 97500 + 4420 = 101920. So -101920/3136.Similarly, (105/56)s = (105/56)*(56/56)*(s) = (105*56)/3136 s = 5880/3136 s.Fourth term: 15/2 = (15/2)*(1568/1568) = (15*784)/3136 = 11760/3136-15/2 s = (-15/2)*(1568/1568)s = (-15*784)/3136 s = -11760/3136 s.Now, combine all terms:First term: (67600 - 7800s + 225s²)/3136Second term: 10800/3136 - 21600/3136 s + 10800/3136 s²Third term: -101920/3136 + 5880/3136 sFourth term: 11760/3136 - 11760/3136 sNow, sum all terms:Numerators:s² terms: 225s² + 10800s² = 11025s²s terms: -7800s -21600s + 5880s -11760s = (-7800 -21600 + 5880 -11760)s = (-7800 -21600 = -29400; 5880 -11760 = -5880; total -29400 -5880 = -35280)sConstant terms: 67600 + 10800 -101920 + 11760 = (67600 + 10800 = 78400; -101920 + 11760 = -90160; 78400 -90160 = -11760)Therefore, the entire numerator is:11025s² -35280s -11760 = 0Divide both sides by 105 to simplify:11025/105 = 105, 35280/105 = 336, 11760/105 = 112.Thus, 105s² -336s -112 = 0.Divide again by 7: 15s² -48s -16 = 0.Solve quadratic equation 15s² -48s -16 = 0.Using quadratic formula: s = [48 ± √(48² + 4*15*16)]/(2*15)Compute discriminant: 2304 + 960 = 3264√3264 = √(16*204) = 4√204 = 4√(4*51) = 8√51.Wait, 204 is 4*51, so √204 = 2√51. Therefore, √3264 = √(16*204) = 4*2√51 = 8√51.Therefore, s = [48 ±8√51]/30 = [24 ±4√51]/15.So two solutions: s = [24 +4√51]/15 and s = [24 -4√51]/15.But we know that when s=0, we are at A, and s=1 at D. Since E is the other intersection point of line AD with ω, and since A is already on ω when s=0, the other solution corresponds to E. So we take s = [24 +4√51]/15 or s = [24 -4√51]/15. Since E is beyond D, which is at s=1, so we need s &gt;1. Let&#39;s check:Compute [24 +4√51]/15: √51 ≈ 7.1414, so 4√51 ≈28.5656. Then 24 +28.5656 ≈52.5656, divided by 15 ≈3.504. So s≈3.5, which is beyond D (s=1). The other solution is [24 -4√51]/15 ≈ (24 -28.5656)/15 ≈ (-4.5656)/15 ≈-0.304, which is negative, so that&#39;s the other direction, not needed. Therefore, E corresponds to s = [24 +4√51]/15 ≈3.5.Therefore, coordinates of E are given by plugging s = [24 +4√51]/15 into parametric equations:x = 65/14 - (15/56)s = 65/14 - (15/56)*[24 +4√51]/15 = 65/14 - [24 +4√51]/56 = (65*4 -24 -4√51)/56 = (260 -24 -4√51)/56 = (236 -4√51)/56 = (59 - √51)/14.Similarly, y = 15√3/14 - (15√3/14)s = (15√3/14)(1 - s) = (15√3/14)(1 - [24 +4√51]/15) = (15√3/14)( [15 -24 -4√51]/15 ) = (15√3/14)( [ -9 -4√51 ]/15 ) = (√3/14)( -9 -4√51 ) = (-9√3 -4√153)/14.But √153 = √(9*17) = 3√17, so:y = (-9√3 -12√17)/14.Hmm, that&#39;s quite complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check:Wait, the parametric equation for y was y = 15√3/14 - (15√3/14)s. So when we plug in s = [24 +4√51]/15, we get:y = 15√3/14 - (15√3/14)*( [24 +4√51]/15 ) = 15√3/14*(1 - [24 +4√51]/15 ) = 15√3/14*( [15 -24 -4√51]/15 ) = 15√3/14*( [ -9 -4√51 ]/15 ) = √3/14*(-9 -4√51 ) = (-9√3 -4√51√3)/14 = (-9√3 -4√153)/14. Since √153 = √(9*17) = 3√17, so yes, y = (-9√3 -12√17)/14.So E has coordinates:x = (59 - √51)/14,y = (-9√3 -12√17)/14.Wow, that&#39;s pretty complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way to approach this problem without getting into such messy algebra. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or power of a point. Let&#39;s recall that since F is on both circles ω and γ, then DF * EF = power of F with respect to γ, but since γ has diameter DE, then any point on γ satisfies DF * FE = 0 (since DE is the diameter, but that might not be helpful). Wait, no. For a circle with diameter DE, any point F on γ satisfies that ∠DFE = 90°, so triangle DFE is right-angled at F.Alternatively, since F is on both circles, perhaps we can use radical axis properties. The radical axis of ω and γ is the line EF. So, AF is a line from A to F, which is on both circles. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, since F is on γ, which has DE as diameter, then DF is perpendicular to FE. So, in triangle DFE, right-angled at F. So, DF ⊥ FE.Also, F is on ω, so lies on the circumcircle of ABC. Maybe use coordinate geometry with the coordinates we have? But the coordinates are very messy.Alternatively, consider inversion with respect to point D or E. Not sure.Alternatively, use complex numbers. Maybe set the circumcircle ω as the unit circle. Wait, but the triangle isn&#39;t regular, so coordinates would still be complex.Alternatively, use the Power of a Point theorem. For example, since F is on both circles, power of point F with respect to ω is zero (since it&#39;s on ω), and power with respect to γ is also zero. Therefore, the power of F with respect to both circles is zero. Hmm.Alternatively, use the fact that AF * AE = power of A with respect to γ. Wait, since A is outside circle γ, the power of A with respect to γ is equal to AF * AE (if AF is secant). Wait, but AE is a line passing through γ? Wait, E is on γ? Wait, no. Circle γ has diameter DE, so points D and E are on γ. Since E is on both ω and γ, and F is the other intersection. So AE passes through E, which is on γ, but A might not be related directly.Alternatively, since F is on γ, which has diameter DE, then power of F with respect to γ is zero: FD * FE = 0. Wait, no, the power of a point on a circle is zero. Wait, yes, but how does that help.Wait, maybe use coordinates to find F.We have points D (35/8, 0) and E ((59 - √51)/14, (-9√3 -12√17)/14). So the circle γ has diameter DE. Let&#39;s find the equation of circle γ.The general equation of a circle with diameter DE: all points F such that ∠DFE = 90°. Alternatively, the equation can be written using coordinates.Let me find the midpoint of DE, which is the center of γ, and the radius is half of DE.Midpoint M of DE:x-coordinate: [35/8 + (59 - √51)/14]/2,y-coordinate: [0 + (-9√3 -12√17)/14]/2.First, convert 35/8 to fourteenths: 35/8 = (35*14)/(8*14) = 490/112, wait, no. Alternatively, common denominator of 8 and 14 is 56.35/8 = (35*7)/56 = 245/56,(59 - √51)/14 = (59 - √51)*4/56 = (236 -4√51)/56.So midpoint x-coordinate: [245/56 + (236 -4√51)/56]/2 = (245 +236 -4√51)/56 /2 = (481 -4√51)/56 /2 = (481 -4√51)/112.Similarly, y-coordinate:[ (-9√3 -12√17)/14 ] /2 = (-9√3 -12√17)/28.Radius of γ is half of DE. Compute DE&#39;s length.Coordinates of D: (35/8, 0) = (245/56, 0),Coordinates of E: ( (59 - √51)/14, (-9√3 -12√17)/14 ) = ( (236 -4√51)/56, (-9√3 -12√17)/14 ).So DE vector:Δx = (236 -4√51)/56 -245/56 = (236 -4√51 -245)/56 = (-9 -4√51)/56,Δy = (-9√3 -12√17)/14 -0 = (-9√3 -12√17)/14.Length DE squared:(Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 = [ (-9 -4√51)/56 ]^2 + [ (-9√3 -12√17)/14 ]^2.This is going to be messy. Maybe we can avoid computing it directly.Alternatively, the equation of circle γ can be written as:(x - Mx)^2 + (y - My)^2 = (DE/2)^2,where M is the midpoint.Alternatively, use the property that for any point F on γ, (F - D)·(F - E) = 0, since ∠DFE = 90°. Wait, yes! Because in vectors, if DF is perpendicular to EF, then (F - D) · (F - E) = 0.Therefore, equation of circle γ is (x - Dx)(x - Ex) + (y - Dy)(y - Ey) = 0.Wait, more precisely, if DF is perpendicular to EF, then vectors DF and EF are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Vector DF = (x - Dx, y - Dy), vector EF = (x - Ex, y - Ey). So (x - Dx)(x - Ex) + (y - Dy)(y - Ey) = 0.Therefore, equation of γ is (x - Dx)(x - Ex) + (y - Dy)(y - Ey) = 0.Given that D is (35/8, 0) and E is ((59 - √51)/14, (-9√3 -12√17)/14), we can write the equation.But this seems very complicated. Maybe plugging in the parametric coordinates of F from circle ω into this equation and solving for AF²?Alternatively, since F is on both circles ω and γ, we can try to solve their equations simultaneously.But given the complexity of the coordinates, this might be very tedious. Maybe there&#39;s a synthetic approach.Wait, let&#39;s recall that in triangle ABC, with angle bisector AD, and E on the circumcircle. There&#39;s a property that relates AE and AD. Specifically, in a triangle, if an angle bisector meets the circumcircle again, then there&#39;s a relation: AE = (bc)/(s(s - a)) or something similar. Wait, maybe use the formula for the length of the angle bisector?Alternatively, use the theorem that relates the length of AE. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, if AE is the angle bisector of angle A and meets the circumcircle at E, then AE = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2). But I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, maybe use power of a point.The Power of Point A with respect to circle γ is equal to AF * AE, since AF is a secant line passing through A and F intersecting γ at F and E (but A is outside γ, so power of A is AF * AE).But also, the power of A with respect to γ can be computed as AD * AE, since AD is a secant line passing through A and D intersecting γ at D and ... Wait, no, circle γ has diameter DE, so points D and E are on γ. Therefore, if we draw line AD, it passes through D and E. So the power of A with respect to γ is AD * AE.Therefore, Power of A with respect to γ is AD * AE = AF * AE (since AF is another secant line). Wait, but AF intersects γ at F and E. Therefore, Power of A is AF * AE = AD * AE. Wait, that would imply AF * AE = AD * AE ⇒ AF = AD, which can&#39;t be right unless F=D, which it&#39;s not. So, probably made a mistake.Wait, the power of a point A with respect to circle γ is equal to the product of the lengths from A to the points of intersection with γ along any line through A. Since line AE passes through E and D (since AE is the angle bisector, passing through D and E), the power of A with respect to γ is AD * AE. But line AF passes through F and E, so it&#39;s also AF * AE. Therefore, AD * AE = AF * AE ⇒ AD = AF. But that would mean AF = AD, implying F=D, which isn&#39;t the case. So, clearly, there&#39;s an error here.Wait, perhaps the power of A with respect to γ is AD * AE, yes. But line AF intersects γ at F and E, so power of A should be AF * AE. Therefore, AF * AE = AD * AE ⇒ AF = AD. But this suggests AF = AD, which is a contradiction unless F = D, which is not the case. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.Wait, maybe line AE passes through E and D, but since E is on γ and D is also on γ, then the power of A with respect to γ is AD * AE (since A outside γ, and secant line ADE). But since AF is another secant line intersecting γ at F and E, then power of A is also AF * AE. Therefore, equating the two, AD * AE = AF * AE ⇒ AD = AF. Therefore, AF = AD. But this would imply F = D, which is not possible because F is another intersection point. Therefore, something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, perhaps the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to each intersection point. So if line AE meets γ at E and D, then power of A is AD * AE. If line AF meets γ at F and E, then power of A is AF * AE. Therefore, AD * AE = AF * AE ⇒ AD = AF. Hence, AF = AD.But in the problem statement, F is another point, not D. So this suggests that either my application of the Power of a Point theorem is wrong, or there&#39;s a misunderstanding. Maybe line AF meets γ at F and E, but since E is already on line AE, which is different from AF unless F is on AE. Wait, but F is the other intersection point of circles ω and γ. If F is on ω and γ, then line AF is a different line? Or is F on AE?Wait, E is the second intersection of AE with ω, so E is on both AE and ω. Then circles ω and γ intersect at E and F. Therefore, line EF is the radical axis of ω and γ. Thus, F is not on line AE unless AF is the same as AE, which would mean F=E, but F is the other intersection point. Hence, F is not on line AE.Therefore, my previous reasoning is invalid because line AF is not the same as line AE, so Power of a Point theorem can&#39;t be applied that way. Therefore, my mistake was assuming that AF is a secant line passing through E, but in reality, F is not on line AE.Therefore, need another approach.Alternatively, maybe use coordinates to find F.We have equations of ω and γ. If we can write both equations and solve them, we can find coordinates of F (other than E), then compute AF².Equation of ω: x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y = 0.Equation of γ: (x - Dx)(x - Ex) + (y - Dy)(y - Ey) = 0. Where D is (35/8, 0), E is ((59 - √51)/14, (-9√3 -12√17)/14).But computing this seems extremely tedious. Maybe we can substitute variables.Let me denote Ex = (59 - √51)/14 ≈ (59 - 7.1414)/14 ≈ 51.8586/14 ≈ 3.704, which is approx coordinates. Similarly, Ey is messy.Alternatively, recognize that this problem is likely set up with a nice answer, so there might be a synthetic approach.Let me think about properties of angle bisectors and circles.Since E is on the circumcircle and on the angle bisector, perhaps there is a symmedian or some harmonic division properties. Alternatively, use the fact that DE is a diameter of γ, so F lies such that ∠DFE = 90°, and F is on ω.Alternatively, since ∠DFE = 90°, and F is on ω, maybe DF is tangent to some circle related to triangle ABC? Not sure.Alternatively, use coordinates but with a different setup. Maybe place the triangle in a coordinate system where calculations are simpler.Wait, alternatively, use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC. But I might not remember the exact formulas.Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines to find angles in triangle ABC.Given triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=7, AC=3.Compute angles using Law of Cosines.For example, angle at A:cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2*AB*AC) = (25 + 9 - 49)/(2*5*3) = (-15)/30 = -0.5. Therefore, angle A is 120°, since cos A = -0.5.Ah! So angle A is 120 degrees. That&#39;s a key point. So angle BAC = 120°, which is probably useful.Given that, perhaps we can use properties related to 120° angles.Since angle A is 120°, and AD is the angle bisector, then angle BAD = angle CAD = 60°.Hmm, that&#39;s useful. Also, since E is on the circumcircle, maybe we can find some arcs.In triangle ABC with angle A = 120°, the circumradius R can be computed using the formula:R = a/(2 sin A) where a is BC =7.Wait, but formula is a/(2 sin A) = BC/(2 sin A) = 7/(2 sin 120°) = 7/(2*(√3/2)) = 7/√3.So circumradius R = 7/√3.But maybe not directly helpful.Alternatively, coordinates. Let me try placing point A at the origin to simplify.Wait, let me place point A at (0,0), since angle BAC is 120°, and AB=5, AC=3.Let me place point A at (0,0). Let me set AB along the x-axis. So point B is at (5,0). Then point C is somewhere such that AC=3 and angle BAC=120°.To find coordinates of C:From A(0,0) to C: distance 3, angle 120°, so coordinates:x = 3 cos 120° = 3*(-1/2) = -3/2,y = 3 sin 120° = 3*(√3/2) = (3√3)/2.Therefore, coordinates of C are (-3/2, (3√3)/2).Point B is at (5,0).Then BC can be computed to confirm it&#39;s 7:Distance between B(5,0) and C(-3/2, 3√3/2):Δx = 5 - (-3/2) = 5 + 3/2 = 13/2,Δy = 0 - 3√3/2 = -3√3/2.Distance BC = √( (13/2)^2 + ( -3√3/2 )^2 ) = √(169/4 + 27/4 ) = √(196/4) = √(49) = 7. Perfect.So coordinates:A(0,0), B(5,0), C(-3/2, 3√3/2).Much nicer! This should simplify calculations.Now, angle bisector AD meets BC at D. Using Angle Bisector Theorem, as before, BD/DC = AB/AC =5/3. Since BC=7, BD=35/8, DC=21/8.Coordinates of D: Since B(5,0) to C(-3/2, 3√3/2), we can parametrize BC.Parametric equations for BC: from B(5,0) to C(-3/2, 3√3/2). The vector is (-13/2, 3√3/2).To find D dividing BC in ratio BD:DC =5:3. So, using section formula:D_x = (3*5 +5*(-3/2))/(5+3) = (15 -15/2)/8 = (15/2)/8 = 15/16,D_y = (3*0 +5*(3√3/2))/8 = (15√3/2)/8 = 15√3/16.Wait, hold on. Section formula: if BD:DC = m:n, then coordinates of D = (n*B + m*C)/(m +n).Here, BD:DC =5:3, so m=5, n=3.Thus,D_x = (3*5 +5*(-3/2))/(5+3) = (15 -15/2)/8 = (15/2)/8 = 15/16,D_y = (3*0 +5*(3√3/2))/8 = (15√3/2)/8 = 15√3/16.Yes, so D is at (15/16, 15√3/16).Then, angle bisector AE meets circumcircle ω at E. So line AD extended meets ω again at E. Let&#39;s find coordinates of E.Parametrize line AD. Since A is (0,0) and D is (15/16, 15√3/16). Direction vector is (15/16, 15√3/16). Parametric equations: t*(15/16, 15√3/16), t ∈ ℝ.We need to find the other intersection point E of this line with ω (circumcircle of ABC).Equation of circumcircle ω: Let&#39;s find it using coordinates of A, B, C.Points A(0,0), B(5,0), C(-3/2, 3√3/2).General equation of circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.Plug in A(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +F =0 ⇒ F=0.Plug in B(5,0): 25 +0 +5D +0 +0=0 ⇒5D = -25 ⇒D= -5.Plug in C(-3/2, 3√3/2):(-3/2)^2 + (3√3/2)^2 + D*(-3/2) + E*(3√3/2) =0.Calculate:9/4 + 27/4 + (-5)(-3/2) + E*(3√3/2) =0 ⇒36/4 + 15/2 + (3√3/2)E =0 ⇒9 + 7.5 + (3√3/2)E =0 ⇒16.5 + (3√3/2)E =0 ⇒(3√3/2)E = -16.5 ⇒E = -16.5 * 2 / (3√3) = -33 / (3√3) = -11/√3 = -11√3/3.Thus, equation of ω is x² + y² -5x - (11√3/3)y =0.Parametric line AD: x =15t/16, y=15√3 t/16.Plug into circle equation:(15t/16)^2 + (15√3 t/16)^2 -5*(15t/16) - (11√3/3)*(15√3 t/16) =0.Compute each term:(225t²)/256 + (225*3 t²)/256 - (75t)/16 - (11√3 *15√3 t)/(3*16).Simplify:225t²/256 + 675t²/256 - 75t/16 - (165*3 t)/48.Combine t² terms:(225 + 675)/256 t² = 900/256 t² = 225/64 t².Next term: -75t/16.Last term: - (495 t)/48 = - (165 t)/16.Therefore, equation becomes:225/64 t² -75t/16 -165t/16 =0.Combine the linear terms:- (75 +165)/16 t = -240/16 t = -15t.Thus:225/64 t² -15t =0.Factor out t:t(225/64 t -15)=0.Solutions: t=0 (which is point A) and 225/64 t -15=0 ⇒ t= (15*64)/225 = (64*15)/225 = (64/15) = 64/15 ≈4.2667.Thus, E corresponds to t=64/15.Therefore, coordinates of E are:x=15/16 *64/15=64/16=4,y=15√3/16 *64/15=64√3/16=4√3.So E is at (4,4√3). That&#39;s much nicer than previous coordinates! I must have messed up the coordinate system earlier by choosing a bad placement. This is why choosing a good coordinate system is crucial.So E is at (4,4√3). Much better.Now, circle γ has diameter DE. Points D(15/16, 15√3/16) and E(4,4√3). Let&#39;s find the equation of circle γ.Midpoint M of DE is the center:M_x=(15/16 +4)/2=(15/16 +64/16)/2=(79/16)/2=79/32,M_y=(15√3/16 +4√3)/2=(15√3/16 +64√3/16)/2=(79√3/16)/2=79√3/32.Radius is half the distance between D and E.Compute DE distance:Δx=4 -15/16=64/16 -15/16=49/16,Δy=4√3 -15√3/16=64√3/16 -15√3/16=49√3/16.Thus, DE=√( (49/16)^2 + (49√3/16)^2 )=√(49²/16² (1 +3))=√(49²/16² *4)=49/16*2=49/8.Therefore, radius of γ is 49/16.Equation of circle γ: (x -79/32)² + (y -79√3/32)²=(49/16)²=2401/256.Now, we need to find intersection points of ω and γ, which are E and F.We know E is at (4,4√3). Let&#39;s verify that it satisfies both equations.Check for ω: x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y.At E(4,4√3):16 + 16*3 -5*4 -11√3/3*4√3 = 16 +48 -20 - (44*3)/3 = 64 -20 -44=0. Yes, satisfies.For γ: (4 -79/32)² + (4√3 -79√3/32)².4=128/32, so 128/32 -79/32=49/32,4√3=128√3/32, so 128√3/32 -79√3/32=49√3/32.Thus, (49/32)^2 + (49√3/32)^2=49²/32² (1 +3)=49²*4/32²=49²/(8²*16)=2401/256, which matches the radius squared. So correct.Now, find the other intersection point F.We need to solve the system:1. x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y =0 (Equation of ω)2. (x -79/32)² + (y -79√3/32)²=2401/256 (Equation of γ)Expand equation 2:(x² - 2*79/32 x + (79/32)^2) + (y² - 2*79√3/32 y + (79√3/32)^2) =2401/256.Simplify:x² + y² - (158/32)x - (158√3/32)y + (79²/32² +79²*3/32²) =2401/256.Compute constants:79²(1 +3)/32² =79²*4/32²= (79²)/(16*256)=6241/1024.Wait, 79²=6241, 32²=1024.So constants term is 6241/1024 *4=6241/256.Therefore, equation 2 becomes:x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +6241/256=2401/256.Bring 2401/256 to left:x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +6241/256 -2401/256=0 ⇒x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +3840/256=0 ⇒x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +15=0.Now, subtract equation 1 (ω&#39;s equation) from equation 2:(Equation 2 - Equation 1):[x² + y² - (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +15] - [x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y] =0 -0.Simplify:- (79/16)x - (79√3/16)y +15 - (-5x -11√3/3 y)=0 ⇒-79/16 x +5x -79√3/16 y +11√3/3 y +15=0.Combine like terms:x terms: (-79/16 +5)= (-79/16 +80/16)=1/16 x,y terms: (-79√3/16 +11√3/3)= √3*(-79/16 +11/3)= √3*(-237 +176)/48= √3*(-61)/48.Thus:(1/16)x - (61√3/48)y +15=0.Multiply through by 48 to eliminate denominators:3x -61√3 y +720=0.Thus, 3x -61√3 y =-720.This is the equation of the radical axis of circles ω and γ, which is the line EF.We need to find the other intersection point F. We already know E(4,4√3) is on this line. So parametrize this line and find its other intersection with ω or γ.Alternatively, solve the system of the radical axis and one of the circles.Let me solve 3x -61√3 y = -720 together with ω&#39;s equation: x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y =0.Express x from the radical axis equation:3x =61√3 y -720 ⇒x= (61√3 y -720)/3.Substitute into ω&#39;s equation:[(61√3 y -720)/3]^2 + y² -5*[(61√3 y -720)/3] -11√3/3 y =0.This will be messy, but let&#39;s proceed step by step.First, compute [(61√3 y -720)/3]^2:= (61√3 y -720)^2 /9= [ (61√3 y)^2 -2*61√3 y*720 +720^2 ] /9= [ 61²*3 y² - 2*61*720√3 y + 720² ] /9= [ 11163 y² - 105840√3 y + 518400 ] /9Next, compute -5*[(61√3 y -720)/3]:= -5*(61√3 y -720)/3= (-305√3 y +3600)/3Similarly, -11√3/3 y remains as is.Therefore, putting all into equation:[11163 y² -105840√3 y +518400]/9 + y² + (-305√3 y +3600)/3 -11√3/3 y =0.Multiply all terms by 9 to eliminate denominators:11163 y² -105840√3 y +518400 +9y² -915√3 y +10800 -33√3 y =0.Combine like terms:y² terms: 11163 +9=11172.y terms: -105840√3 y -915√3 y -33√3 y = -105840√3 -948√3 = -(105840 +948)√3 y = -106788√3 y.Constant terms:518400 +10800=529200.Thus:11172 y² -106788√3 y +529200=0.Divide all terms by 12 to simplify:11172/12=931,106788/12=8899,529200/12=44100.Thus:931y² -8899√3 y +44100=0.This quadratic in y can be solved using the quadratic formula.Discriminant D= (8899√3)^2 -4*931*44100.Compute D:(8899)^2 *3 -4*931*44100.This is going to be very large. Let me compute each part:First term:8899² *3.8899²: compute 9000²=81,000,000, subtract 101²=10,201, and cross terms: (9000 -101)^2=9000² -2*9000*101 +101²=81,000,000 -1,818,000 +10,201=79,192,201.Thus, 8899²=79,192,201. Multiply by3:237,576,603.Second term:4*931*44100=4*931*44100.Compute 4*44100=176,400.176,400*931= let&#39;s compute 176,400*900=158,760,000 and 176,400*31=5,468,400. Total=158,760,000 +5,468,400=164,228,400.Thus, discriminant D=237,576,603 -164,228,400=73,348,203.Now, compute √D=√73,348,203.But this is equal to √(73,348,203). Hmm, note that 73,348,203 divided by3 is24,449,401. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s a square. 4943²=24,433,249, which is close. 4944²=24,449, 4944^2=4944*4944= (5000 -56)^2=25,000,000 - 2*5000*56 +56²=25,000,000 -560,000 +3,136=24,443,136. Not matching. So perhaps not a perfect square. Hence, this approach is leading to a dead end due to the messy calculations.Alternatively, recall that we know E is on both the radical axis and the circles, so the other solution must correspond to F. Given the complexity, perhaps we can use parametric coordinates.Let me parametrize the radical axis line 3x -61√3 y =-720.Let me solve for x in terms of y:x = (61√3 y -720)/3.Now, substitute into ω&#39;s equation:x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y =0.Plugging x:[(61√3 y -720)/3]^2 + y² -5*(61√3 y -720)/3 -11√3/3 y =0.This is the same equation as before. Alternatively, since we know that E(4,4√3) is a solution, we can factor it out.Let me let y =4√3. Then x=(61√3*4√3 -720)/3=(61*12 -720)/3=(732 -720)/3=12/3=4. Which is point E. So (y -4√3) is a factor.Thus, the quadratic equation in y can be written as (y -4√3)(something)=0.Let me denote the quadratic equation as 931y² -8899√3 y +44100=0.Divide by 931:y² - (8899√3 /931)y +44100/931=0.But this might not help.Alternatively, use Vieta&#39;s formula: sum of roots y₁ + y₂ =8899√3 /931,product y₁ y₂=44100/931≈47.38.We know one root is y=4√3≈6.9282. Let&#39;s compute the other root y₂=44100/(931*4√3).Compute 44100/(931*4√3)=44100/(3724√3)= (44100/3724)/√3≈(11.84)/1.732≈6.84. But not sure. Alternatively, approximate calculations might not help.Given that this is a competition problem, the answer AF² is a rational number, which suggests that coordinates of F are such that AF² is rational. Given the complexity of the radical axis solution, perhaps another approach is needed.Let me recall that in circle γ with diameter DE, any point F on γ satisfies ∠DFE=90°. Therefore, triangle DFE is right-angled at F. Since F is also on ω, the circumcircle of ABC, maybe use cyclic quadrilaterals or orthocenters.Alternatively, use the fact that AF² is required, so maybe use coordinates to compute AF² once F is found. But given the previous quadratic equation is too complicated, perhaps there&#39;s a property we&#39;re missing.Wait, perhaps inversion. Inversion with respect to point D or E. But not sure.Alternatively, use complex numbers. Let me try.Let me model the plane as complex numbers, with point A at 0, B at5, and C at (-3/2, 3√3/2). Let me convert coordinates to complex numbers.A=0, B=5, C= -3/2 + (3√3/2)i.D is the point on BC such that BD/DC=5/3. As before, D=15/16 +15√3/16i.E is at4 +4√3i.Circle γ has diameter DE. The other intersection F of γ and ω.In complex numbers, the condition for F to be on γ is that (F - D)/(E - D) is imaginary. Because in a circle with diameter DE, the argument of (F - D)/(E - D) is 90°, so it&#39;s purely imaginary.Therefore, (F - D)/(E - D) = ki, where k is real.Therefore, F = D + ki(E - D).Also, F is on ω, the circumcircle of ABC. The circumcircle of ABC can be defined in complex numbers too. Since A, B, C are on ω, we can find its equation.The circumcircle of ABC in complex plane can be represented using the real plane. Given three points A(0,0), B(5,0), C(-3/2, 3√3/2), the circumcircle equation is already known: x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y =0.In complex numbers, a point z=x + yi lies on ω if x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y =0.Let me write this equation in terms of z and its conjugate.For z =x + yi, x=(z + overline{z})/2, y=(z - overline{z})/(2i).Plugging into the equation:x² + y² -5x -11√3/3 y =0.This will involve z and overline{z}, but it might be complicated.Alternatively, note that the circumcircle of ABC can be parametrized. Since angle at A is 120°, and the circumradius is 7/√3, as we found earlier.But perhaps use rotation.Let me consider rotating the complex plane such that point A is at the origin, and AB is along the real axis. Then point B is at5, and point C is at-3/2 + (3√3/2)i.The circumcircle of ABC has center at some complex number O.But finding O might help. Let me compute the circumcircle center.The perpendicular bisector of AB (from0 to5) is the line x=2.5.The perpendicular bisector of AC.Coordinates of A(0,0), C(-3/2,3√3/2).Midpoint of AC: (-3/4, 3√3/4).Slope of AC: (3√3/2 -0)/(-3/2 -0)= (3√3/2)/(-3/2)= -√3.Therefore, perpendicular bisector slope is 1/√3.Equation: y -3√3/4 = (1/√3)(x +3/4).Find intersection with x=2.5.Substitute x=5/2:y -3√3/4 = (1/√3)(5/2 +3/4)= (1/√3)(13/4).Thus, y= 3√3/4 +13/(4√3)= rationalize 13/(4√3)=13√3/12.Therefore, y= (9√3/12 +13√3/12)=22√3/12=11√3/6.Thus, circumcircle center is at (5/2,11√3/6).Therefore, in complex numbers, O=5/2 +11√3/6 i.The radius R is the distance from O to A(0,0):√( (5/2)^2 + (11√3/6)^2 )=√(25/4 + (121*3)/36 )=√(25/4 + 121/12)=√(75/12 +121/12)=√(196/12)=√(49/3)=7/√3, which matches earlier result.Thus, the equation in complex numbers is |z - O|² = R².So for a point z on ω, |z - (5/2 +11√3/6 i)|²= (7/√3)²=49/3.But we need to relate this to the expression for F.Given that F = D + ki(E - D).Let me compute E - D in complex numbers.E is4 +4√3i.D is15/16 +15√3/16i.E - D=4 -15/16 + (4√3 -15√3/16)i= (64/16 -15/16) + (64√3/16 -15√3/16)i=49/16 +49√3/16i=49/16(1 +√3i).Therefore, E - D=49/16(1 +√3i).Thus, F= D + ki*(49/16)(1 +√3i).Since ki is a purely imaginary number, let me write ki= k e^{iπ/2}=k(0 +i)=k i, where k is real.Therefore, F= D + (49/16)k i (1 +√3i).Compute this:D=15/16 +15√3/16i,(49/16)k i (1 +√3i)= (49k/16)i + (49k/16)i*√3i=49k/16 i -49k√3/16.Therefore, F= (15/16 -49k√3/16) + (15√3/16 +49k/16)i.So real part= (15 -49k√3)/16,imaginary part= (15√3 +49k)/16.Now, since F lies on ω, we can substitute this into the equation |z - O|²=49/3.Compute O=5/2 +11√3/6 i=40/16 +88√3/48 i=40/16 +11√3/6 i.But to avoid confusion, let me compute using fractions.Real part of z - O= (15 -49k√3)/16 -5/2= (15 -49k√3)/16 -40/16= (-25 -49k√3)/16.Imaginary part of z - O= (15√3 +49k)/16 -11√3/6= [15√3 +49k]/16 - (88√3)/48= [15√3 +49k]/16 - (11√3)/6= common denominator 48:= [ (15√3 +49k)*3 -11√3 *8 ] /48= [45√3 +147k -88√3]/48= (-43√3 +147k)/48.Therefore, |z - O|²= [(-25 -49k√3)/16]^2 + [(-43√3 +147k)/48]^2=49/3.This equation in k should allow us to solve for k.This looks complicated, but let&#39;s proceed.First term:[(-25 -49k√3)/16]^2= (625 + 2450k√3 + 49²*3k²)/256= (625 +2450k√3 +7203k²)/256.Second term:[(-43√3 +147k)/48]^2= ( (43√3)^2 -2*43√3*147k + (147k)^2 )/48²= ( 5547 -12642√3 k +21609k² )/2304.Sum of terms equals49/3:(625 +2450k√3 +7203k²)/256 + (5547 -12642√3 k +21609k²)/2304 =49/3.Multiply both sides by 2304 to eliminate denominators:9*(625 +2450k√3 +7203k²) + (5547 -12642√3 k +21609k²)=49*768.Compute each part:First term:9*625=5625, 9*2450k√3=22050k√3,9*7203k²=64827k².Second term:5547 -12642√3k +21609k².Sum of terms:5625 +5547 +22050k√3 -12642√3k +64827k² +21609k²=49*768.Compute constants:5625 +5547=11172.k√3 terms:22050k√3 -12642k√3=9408k√3.k² terms:64827k² +21609k²=86436k².Right side:49*768=37632.Thus:86436k² +9408√3 k +11172=37632.Subtract 37632:86436k² +9408√3 k +11172 -37632=0 ⇒86436k² +9408√3 k -26460=0.Divide equation by 12 to simplify:7203k² +784√3 k -2205=0.Now, this quadratic equation in k can be solved using quadratic formula:k = [ -784√3 ±√( (784√3)^2 +4*7203*2205 ) ]/(2*7203).Compute discriminant D:(784√3)^2 +4*7203*2205=784²*3 +4*7203*2205.First term:784²*3=614,656*3=1,843,968.Second term:4*7203*2205=4*7203*2205.Calculate 7203*4=28,812. 28,812*2205.Let me compute 28,812*2000=57,624,000,28,812*205=28,812*(200 +5)=5,762,400 +144,060=5,906,460.Thus total second term=57,624,000 +5,906,460=63,530,460.Therefore, D=1,843,968 +63,530,460=65,374,428.Now, compute √D=√65,374,428.Let me check if this is a perfect square.Calculate approximate value: 8085²=65,387,225 which is higher than 65,374,428. 8080²=65,286,400. 8080²=65,286,400. 65,374,428 -65,286,400=88,028. So between 8080 and8085. Not a perfect square. Therefore, this approach is also leading to messy calculations.Given the time invested and the fact that this is a competition problem, likely there is a synthetic solution.Let me recall that in triangle ABC, angle bisector AD, E is the other intersection with circumcircle, and F is the other intersection of circles ω and γ (with DE as diameter). We need to find AF².Since angle DFE=90°, and F is on ω, then AF might be related to some other lengths. Perhaps use the fact that AF is the symmedian or some other property.Alternatively, use the following theorem: If two circles intersect at F and E, then the line EF is the radical axis. The power of point A with respect to both circles is equal. So, power of A with respect to ω is zero (since A is on ω). Power of A with respect to γ is AF * AE = AD * AE (since line AD passes through D and E on γ). But AF * AE = AD * AE ⇒ AF = AD. But this again suggests AF = AD, which would mean F = D, which is not the case. Therefore, this approach is invalid.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. The power of A with respect to γ should be equal along any secant line. Since line AE passes through E (on γ) and D (on γ), so power of A is AD * AE. Similarly, line AF passes through F and E (both on γ), so power of A is AF * AE. Therefore, AD * AE = AF * AE ⇒ AD=AF. Therefore, AF=AD.But if AF=AD, then F lies on the angle bisector AD such that AF=AD. Therefore, F is a point beyond D such that AF=AD.But AD is the length from A to D. Let&#39;s compute AD.Coordinates of A(0,0), D(15/16,15√3/16).AD distance: √( (15/16)^2 + (15√3/16)^2 )=√(225/256 +675/256 )=√(900/256 )=30/16=15/8.Therefore, AD=15/8. If AF=AD=15/8, then AF=15/8. Therefore, AF²=225/64. But the problem states that AF²= m/n with m and n coprime. 225 and 64 are coprime, so m+n=225+64=289.But wait, this seems too straightforward. However, the problem says circles ω and γ meet at E and F, and F is different from E. If AF=AD=15/8, then F would be the reflection of D over A, but in our coordinate system, A is at (0,0), D is at (15/16,15√3/16). Reflecting D over A would give (-15/16, -15√3/16), which is not on ω.Wait, this suggests that AF=AD is not possible unless F is a different point. Therefore, there must be an error in the Power of a Point reasoning. Maybe because line AF is not a secant passing through two points on γ. Wait, F is on γ, but E is also on γ. Therefore, line AF passes through A and F, with F on γ, and E is also on γ. Therefore, line AF passes through A and F, with F and E on γ. Wait, but A is outside γ, so the power of A with respect to γ is AF * AE, where AF is the entire secant from A through F to E. However, line AE passes through E and D, both on γ, so power of A is AD * AE.Therefore, equate AF * AE = AD * AE ⇒ AF=AD. But since AF=AD, and AD=15/8, then AF=15/8. Therefore, AF²=(15/8)²=225/64, which is reduced fraction, so m=225, n=64, m+n=289.However, in the coordinate system, we have F as another intersection point, but according to this, AF=AD=15/8. Let&#39;s verify if this is the case.From previous coordinate calculations, AF is the distance from A(0,0) to F. If AF=15/8, then F would be at a distance of15/8 from A. Let&#39;s check if such a point exists on both circles.Given that AD=15/8, and F is supposed to satisfy AF=15/8, then F would be a point at distance15/8 from A on the radical axis line EF. But in our coordinate system, point D is at15/16, which is closer to A than15/8.Wait, there&#39;s confusion here. AD is length15/8, which is approximately1.875. In coordinate system, distance from A(0,0) to D(15/16,15√3/16):√( (15/16)^2 + (15√3/16)^2 )= √(225/256 + 675/256 )=√(900/256 )=30/16=15/8=1.875. So AD=15/8. If AF=AD=15/8, then F is a point at distance15/8 from A. However, in the radical axis solution, we had quadratic equation leading to two points E and F. Since E is at distance from A:Distance AE= distance from A(0,0) to E(4,4√3)= √(16 + 48)=√64=8. So AE=8. If AF=15/8, then AF * AE= (15/8)*8=15= AD * AE= (15/8)*8=15. So this checks out.But coordinates of F would have to satisfy AF=15/8 and lying on radical axis. Let&#39;s check if such a point exists.Radical axis equation:3x -61√3 y =-720.Parametrize x in terms of y: x= (]</p><div class="divider" data-v-817cadee></div><p class="review-content" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>🔑:</span>Use the angle bisector theorem to find CD=tfrac{21}{8}, BD=tfrac{35}{8}, and use Stewart&#39;s Theorem to find AD=tfrac{15}{8}.

So, first, the aquarium is on a level table, and it&#39;s rectangular. The dimensions given are 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. Hmm, wait, they mention it has rectangular faces, so it must be a rectangular prism, right? So, length, width, height. They told us the width is 10 inches and the height is 8 inches. But they didn&#39;t mention the length. Hmm, maybe that&#39;s important? Or maybe it&#39;s not needed because the answer might not depend on it? Let me see.The problem says that when the aquarium was tilted, the water covered an 8 by 10 inch end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. Wait, the wording here is a bit confusing. Let me parse this again. &quot;Covered an 8&#39;&#39; × 10&#39;&#39; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; Hmm. Maybe &quot;room&quot; is a typo? Maybe they meant &quot;base&quot; or &quot;face&quot;? Because an aquarium doesn&#39;t have a room. Maybe it&#39;s supposed to be &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular base&quot;? That would make more sense. Alternatively, maybe &quot;rectangular room&quot; refers to the space inside the aquarium when tilted? Not sure. Let me think.Alternatively, the problem might be saying that when tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end (which is one of the sides) but only three-fourths of another rectangular face. Wait, maybe the original aquarium has dimensions: since it&#39;s 10 inches wide and 8 inches high, maybe the third dimension (length) is something else? Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention the length. Hmm. So maybe the aquarium is a rectangular prism with width 10&quot;, height 8&quot;, and length L, which is not given. But when it&#39;s tilted, the water covers an 8x10 end entirely, but only three-fourths of another face. Hmm.Wait, the original problem says &quot;covered an 8&#39;&#39;×10&#39;&#39; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; Maybe &quot;room&quot; is a mistranslation or typo. Maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular base&quot;? If that&#39;s the case, when it&#39;s tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end (which is the front face, maybe) but only three-fourths of the base. The base would be length times width, which is L x 10. If three-fourths of that is covered, then maybe the area of the water&#39;s surface on the base is three-fourths of L x 10. But I&#39;m not sure. Maybe I need to visualize this.When the aquarium is tilted, the water level forms a slanted surface. Depending on how it&#39;s tilted, the water might cover the entire 8x10 end, meaning that when you tilt it so that the water reaches the top of one end, the other end is exposed. But the problem says it covers the entire 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. Hmm. Maybe &quot;room&quot; refers to the area of the water&#39;s surface when it&#39;s tilted. If the aquarium is tilted, the water forms a slanted surface, which would be a rectangle. If normally the base is 10 inches wide and length L, then when tilted, the water surface might be a diagonal, making a triangular prism of water. But the problem states that the water covers an 8x10 end. Wait, maybe the 8x10 end is the front face, and when tilted, the water covers that entire face, but the surface area of the water is three-fourths of the original base&#39;s area?Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that when the aquarium is tilted, the water occupies a volume such that it covers the entire 8x10 end (which is 8 inches high and 10 inches wide) but only three-fourths of the... something. Maybe the base? If the base is L x 10, then three-fourths of that would be (3/4)L x 10. But if the water covers the entire 8x10 end, that might imply that the height of the water when tilted is 8 inches, but spread over a larger area? I&#39;m confused.Wait, let me read the problem again:&quot;An aquarium on a level table has rectangular faces and is 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. When it was tilted, the water in it covered an 8&#39;&#39;×10&#39;&#39; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. The depth of the water when the bottom was again made level, was...&quot;Hmm. So, the aquarium is 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. So, the dimensions are: width (which I assume is the front-to-back dimension) is 10 inches, height is 8 inches, and the length (left-to-right) isn&#39;t specified. Maybe that&#39;s the missing dimension. The aquarium has rectangular faces, so it&#39;s a rectangular prism with width 10&quot;, height 8&quot;, and length L&quot;. When it&#39;s tilted, the water covers an 8&quot;×10&quot; end. The ends are probably the width by height, so 10&quot; wide and 8&quot; high, which is 8x10. Wait, but 8&quot; is the height and 10&quot; is the width, so an end would be 8x10. So, when tilted, the water covers that entire end. So, when it&#39;s tilted, the water reaches the top of that end, meaning that the water level is at the brim on that side. But on the opposite end, the water level would be lower. Then, the problem says &quot;but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; Hmm. Maybe &quot;rectangular room&quot; refers to the base? The base of the aquarium is length L x width 10&quot;. If when tilted, the water covers three-fourths of the base, then the area of the water&#39;s surface is (3/4)*L*10. But how does that relate to the volume of water?Alternatively, maybe when the aquarium is tilted, the water occupies three-fourths of the volume? But the answer choices are in inches, so the depth when level is asked. So, if we can find the volume of water when it&#39;s tilted, then when we make the aquarium level again, the depth would be volume divided by the base area.Wait, that might be the key. The volume of water remains the same whether the aquarium is tilted or level. So, if we can find the volume when it&#39;s tilted, then divide by the base area (which is length times width) to get the depth when it&#39;s level. However, we need to figure out the volume when it&#39;s tilted. The problem states that when tilted, the water covers an 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. Hmm.Wait, maybe when tilted, the water forms a triangular prism. If the aquarium is tilted so that the water reaches the top of one end, then the shape of the water is a triangular prism with base area (1/2)*10*8, but that&#39;s only if it&#39;s tilted along one edge. Wait, but the problem says the water covers the entire 8x10 end. So, the entire end is submerged. But if it&#39;s tilted, the water would cover that end, but the other end would have less water. However, the volume of water would be the area of the triangular cross-section times the length of the aquarium. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention the length. Hmm.Wait, maybe the aquarium is a cube? But it&#39;s 10 inches wide and 8 inches high, so no. It must be a rectangular prism with width 10&quot;, height 8&quot;, and length, say, L&quot;. If when it&#39;s tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end, then the volume of water would be (1/2)*10*8*L, since it&#39;s a triangular prism. Then, when it&#39;s level, the volume would be 10*L*d, where d is the depth. Therefore, setting them equal: 10*L*d = (1/2)*10*8*L =&gt; d = (1/2)*8 = 4&quot;. But 4&quot; is one of the answer choices (E). However, the problem says &quot;only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; So maybe my assumption is wrong.Wait, the problem says that when tilted, the water covers the 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. So maybe the volume isn&#39;t half, but three-fourths? Maybe. If when tilted, the water occupies three-fourths of the volume, then when level, the depth would be three-fourths of the height? But the height is 8&quot;, so 6&quot;, but 6&quot; isn&#39;t an answer choice. Hmm.Wait, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to the area of the water&#39;s surface when tilted. If the aquarium is tilted, the water surface is a rectangle, but only three-fourths of the original base area. If the original base area is L x 10, then three-fourths of that is (3/4)L x 10. But how does that relate to the volume? The volume would be the area of the water&#39;s surface times the average depth? Wait, no. If the aquarium is tilted, the water forms a slanted surface. The volume is the same as the area of the base times the depth when level. But when tilted, the volume can be calculated by integrating over the area, but since it&#39;s a prism, it&#39;s equivalent to the area of the triangular cross-section times the length.Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the area of the water&#39;s surface. When the aquarium is tilted, the water surface is a rectangle that&#39;s 8&quot; in one dimension and 10&quot; in the other, but only three-fourths of the original room. Wait, maybe &quot;room&quot; here refers to the total area of the base? If the original base area is L x 10, then three-fourths of that is (3/4)L x 10. But the water&#39;s surface when tilted is 8 x 10. Wait, 8 x 10 is 80 square inches, and three-fourths of the original base area is (3/4)L x 10. So, 80 = (3/4)L x 10 =&gt; 80 = (30/4)L =&gt; 80 = 7.5 L =&gt; L = 80 / 7.5 = 10.666... inches. But that seems odd. Also, we don&#39;t know L. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to the area of the water covering three-fourths of another face. The aquarium has multiple faces: front, back, sides, top, bottom. When tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end (front or back face) and three-fourths of another face, maybe the bottom or top. Wait, if it&#39;s tilted, the bottom is still the same. Maybe the side? If the aquarium is tilted, the water might cover part of a side face. But the problem is a bit ambiguous. Maybe &quot;rectangular room&quot; is a mistranslation or misprint. Maybe it should be &quot;rectangular base&quot;? If so, then when tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the base. Then the volume of water would be the area of the base times the depth when level. But how does tilting affect this? Hmm.Alternatively, think of the aquarium as having length, width, height. When it&#39;s upright, the base is length x width. When it&#39;s tilted, the water forms a slanted surface. The area of the water&#39;s surface would be the same as the area of the base if it&#39;s not tilted, but since it&#39;s tilted, the surface is a rectangle that&#39;s longer in one dimension. Wait, no. If you tilt a rectangular prism, the surface of the water becomes a parallelogram, but its area remains the same as the original base area. Wait, but the problem says it covers three-fourths of the rectangular room. Maybe the surface area is three-fourths? But that doesn&#39;t directly relate to volume.This is confusing. Let&#39;s try a different approach. Let&#39;s assume that the aquarium&#39;s dimensions are length L, width 10&quot;, height 8&quot;. When it&#39;s tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end, which would mean that the water reaches the top of that end. The volume of water when tilted would then be the volume of a triangular prism. The triangular cross-section would have a base of 10&quot; (width) and a height of 8&quot; (since the water reaches the top). The area of the triangle is (1/2)*10*8 = 40 square inches. Then the volume would be 40*L cubic inches. When the aquarium is placed level again, the volume of water remains the same. The base area when level is L*10, so the depth d would satisfy L*10*d = 40*L =&gt; d = 4&quot;. But 4&quot; is option E. However, the problem states that when tilted, the water only covers three-fourths of the rectangular room. So my previous assumption must be missing something.Ah, the problem says &quot;covered an 8&#39;&#39;×10&#39;&#39; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; So maybe the water doesn&#39;t cover the entire triangular prism, but three-fourths of it? Wait, maybe the volume is three-fourths of the triangular prism volume? If the triangular prism volume is 40*L, then three-fourths of that is 30*L. Then, when level, the depth would be 30*L / (10*L) = 3&quot;. Which is option B. That seems possible. But why does the problem mention covering an 8x10 end? Maybe when tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end (so height is 8&quot;) but the length is three-fourths? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the &quot;rectangular room&quot; is the floor of the aquarium, which is 10&quot; wide and length L. When tilted, the water covers three-fourths of the floor. So the area covered is (3/4)*10*L. But the shape of the water when tilted is a slanted surface. If the aquarium is tilted such that the water covers the entire 8x10 end, the slanted surface would extend from the top of one end to some point along the other end. The area of the water&#39;s surface would be a rectangle with one side 10&quot; (width) and the other side equal to the length of the aquarium, but only three-fourths of that area is covered? Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, perhaps when the aquarium is tilted, the water occupies a volume that is three-fourths of the total volume. The total volume of the aquarium is 10*8*L. If the water is three-fourths of that, then the volume is (3/4)*10*8*L = 60*L. When placed level, the depth d is 60*L / (10*L) = 6&quot;. But 6&quot; isn&#39;t one of the options. So that can&#39;t be right.Wait, the answer choices are 2.5&quot;, 3&quot;, 3.25&quot;, 3.5&quot;, 4&quot;. So 3&quot; and 4&quot; are options. Maybe the answer is 3&quot;. How?Let me try to visualize the tilted aquarium. Suppose the aquarium is tilted along its width, so that one of the 8&quot; high ends is lower. When tilted, the water level covers the entire 8x10 end (so up to the brim on that side) but on the opposite side, the water level is lower. The surface of the water would be a slanted plane from the top of one end to some point on the other end. The volume of water in this case is the area of the trapezoidal cross-section times the width. Wait, no. If it&#39;s tilted along the width, the cross-section along the length would be a triangle. Wait, maybe not.Wait, the aquarium has width 10&quot;, height 8&quot;, and length L&quot;. If it&#39;s tilted along the length, so that one of the 8&quot; high ends is lower, then the water would form a slanted surface along the length. The cross-section would be a right triangle with legs of 8&quot; and L&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t seem right.Alternatively, if it&#39;s tilted along the width, then the cross-section (viewed from the front) would be a rectangle 10&quot; wide and 8&quot; high, but the water would form a slant from the top of one end to the bottom of the other. Wait, if it&#39;s tilted so that the water just covers the entire 8x10 end, that means that on the front face, the water reaches the full height of 8&quot; at one end and slopes down to the other end. The volume of water would then be the area of this triangular cross-section times the width? Wait, the width is 10&quot;, but the cross-section is a triangle with base L and height 8&quot;. Wait, I&#39;m getting confused.Let me try to draw a diagram mentally. The aquarium is a rectangular box. When placed on a level table, it&#39;s upright with width 10&quot;, height 8&quot;, and length L&quot;. When tilted, perhaps we are tilting it so that one of the vertical edges (height 8&quot;) is now lower, causing the water to cover that entire vertical face (8&quot; high and 10&quot; wide), but the water only covers three-fourths of the base. Wait, if the base is length L&quot; and width 10&quot;, then three-fourths of the base area is (3/4)L*10. But the volume of water would be the area of the base covered times the depth? But when it&#39;s tilted, the depth varies.Alternatively, the volume of water can be found by considering the shape when tilted. If the aquarium is tilted such that the water covers the entire 8x10 end, the water forms a slanted surface. The volume of water is equal to the area of the triangular cross-section multiplied by the length (which is 10&quot;). Wait, no. If the aquarium is length L, width 10&quot;, height 8&quot;, then tilting it would affect different dimensions.Wait, perhaps the key is that when tilted, the water forms a rectangular surface covering 8x10, but only three-fourths of some other dimension. Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that when tilted, the water occupies a volume that is three-fourths of the volume of the aquarium. But the aquarium&#39;s total volume is 10*8*L, so three-fourths of that is 60*L. Then, when level, the depth would be 60*L/(10*L) = 6&quot;. Not an option. So that can&#39;t be.Wait, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to the horizontal area. Wait, maybe &quot;room&quot; is supposed to be &quot;base&quot;? If so, then when tilted, the water covers three-fourths of the base area. But the base area is 10*L. So three-fourths is (3/4)*10*L = 7.5*L. If the water&#39;s surface when tilted is a rectangle of 8x10, then the area is 80. So 80 = 7.5*L =&gt; L = 80 / 7.5 = 10.666...&quot;. But then the volume would be 80 * something? Wait, no.Alternatively, the volume of water when tilted is the area of the water&#39;s surface times the &quot;depth&quot; in the direction perpendicular to the surface. But since it&#39;s tilted, this is complicated.Wait, maybe we can think in terms of the area of the water when tilted. If the aquarium is tilted so that the water covers an 8x10 end, then the surface of the water is that 8x10 end. But that doesn&#39;t make sense because the water surface should be a plane. If the aquarium is tilted, the water surface should be slanting, so the area of the water surface would be larger than the base.Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me check similar problems. Typically, when a rectangular tank is tilted, the volume of water can be calculated by considering the average depth or the area of the triangular cross-section. For example, if a tank is tilted so that the water just covers the entire base, the volume is half the tank&#39;s volume. But in this problem, it&#39;s covering an 8x10 end but three-fourths of the room.Wait, another approach: Since the aquarium is 10 inches wide and 8 inches high, and when tilted, the water covers the 8x10 end. So the 8x10 end is completely submerged. The question is, what&#39;s the volume of the water? If the aquarium is tilted such that the 8x10 end is fully submerged, but the other end is only partially submerged. The shape of the water would be a triangular prism if the tilt is along one edge.Wait, imagine tilting the aquarium so that one of the 8-inch high edges is on the table, and the opposite edge is lifted. The water would form a diagonal across the aquarium. The submerged part would be a triangular prism. The volume of the triangular prism would be (1/2)*base*height*length. Here, base and height would be 10 inches and 8 inches, and length is the third dimension. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention the length. Unless the length is 10 inches? Wait, the aquarium is 10 inches wide, 8 inches high, but the length isn&#39;t given. Maybe it&#39;s a cube, but 10 wide and 8 high would not be a cube.Alternatively, maybe the aquarium is 10 inches wide (front to back), 8 inches high (vertical), and the length (left to right) is also 10 inches? But that&#39;s an assumption.Wait, the problem says &quot;rectangular faces&quot;. So all faces are rectangles. Therefore, the aquarium has length, width, and height all different? Or some the same? Since it&#39;s 10 inches wide and 8 inches high, but length isn&#39;t given. Maybe the length is 10 inches? If so, then the aquarium is 10x10x8. But that&#39;s an assumption.Alternatively, maybe the aquarium is 10 inches in width (depth), 8 inches in height, and the length is something else, which we can call L. But since the problem doesn&#39;t mention it, maybe it cancels out in the equations.Let me try to proceed with variables.Let the aquarium have width W = 10&quot;, height H = 8&quot;, and length L (unknown).When tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end. So, the front face (8x10) is fully submerged. The volume of water is then the volume of a triangular prism. The triangular cross-section would have base W = 10&quot; and height H = 8&quot;, so area = (1/2)*10*8 = 40 in². Then, the volume would be 40*L in³.But the problem also says &quot;only three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot;. If &quot;room&quot; is supposed to be &quot;base&quot;, then the area of the water&#39;s surface when tilted is three-fourths of the base area. The base area is L*W = L*10. So, three-fourths of that is (3/4)*10*L = 7.5*L. But the area of the water&#39;s surface when tilted is a parallelogram with area = base * height. The base is L, and the height is the width W = 10&quot;. Wait, no. When tilted, the water surface is a rectangle. If the aquarium is tilted along its length, the water surface would be a rectangle with dimensions equal to the length L and the width of the aquarium, which is 10&quot;. But that doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, maybe the water surface is inclined, so its area is larger. The area of the water&#39;s surface when tilted is equal to the area of the original base divided by the cosine of the tilt angle. But since the problem mentions three-fourths, maybe the area is three-fourths of the original? Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps when the aquarium is tilted, the projection of the water&#39;s surface onto the base is three-fourths of the base area. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s standard terminology.Wait, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to the horizontal cross-sectional area when tilted. If the aquarium is tilted, the effective area over which the water spreads is three-fourths of the original base. So, the volume would be three-fourths of the base area times the height of the water when level? Wait, no.Alternatively, the problem might be in two dimensions. Maybe it&#39;s considering the front face of the aquarium, which is 8x10. When tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 front face (area 80 in²) but only three-fourths of the &quot;rectangular room&quot;, which might be the horizontal area. If the horizontal area is three-fourths, then the volume is 80 * (3/4) * something. Hmm, not sure.This is really confusing. Maybe I need to look for another approach. Let&#39;s think about the answer choices. If when tilted, the volume is such that when leveled, the depth is 3&quot;, then the volume is 3*10*L. When tilted, the volume is the same. If the volume when tilted is a triangular prism, then 3*10*L = (1/2)*10*8*L =&gt; 30L = 40L, which is not possible. So that can&#39;t be.Wait, but if the volume when tilted is three-fourths of the triangular prism volume, then 3/4 * 40L = 30L. Then, when leveled, the depth is 30L / (10L) = 3&quot;, which is option B. So maybe that&#39;s the answer. But why is the volume three-fourths?Alternatively, maybe when the aquarium is tilted, the water doesn&#39;t form a full triangular prism but a trapezoidal prism or something else. If the problem states that when tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room, which might mean that the length of the water&#39;s surface is three-fourths of the aquarium&#39;s length. So, if the aquarium&#39;s length is L, then the water&#39;s surface length is (3/4)L. Then, the volume of water would be the area of the trapezoid times width. Wait, maybe.But I don&#39;t have enough information. This problem is very ambiguously worded. Given that the answer is one of the options, and my earlier calculation gave 4&quot;, but the mention of three-fourths suggests maybe 3&quot;, I might need to consider that the volume is three-fourths of the triangular prism volume. But why?Alternatively, suppose that when the aquarium is tilted, the water&#39;s surface covers the entire 8x10 end (area 80 in²) and three-fourths of the length. So, the volume is 80 * (3/4)L = 60L. When leveled, the volume is 10*L*d = 60L, so d = 6&quot;. Not an option. Hmm.Wait, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to the height? If the water covers three-fourths of the height when tilted, then the depth when leveled is three-fourths of 8&quot;, which is 6&quot;. Again, not an option.Alternatively, maybe when the aquarium is tilted, the water forms a slanted surface such that the area of the water&#39;s surface is three-fourths of the area of the 8x10 end. But the 8x10 end is 80 in², so three-fourths is 60 in². Then, the volume is 60 * L, and when leveled, depth d = 60L / (10L) = 6&quot;. Not an option.Wait, I&#39;m going in circles. Let&#39;s look for similar problems. In some problems, when a tank is tilted such that the water reaches the top at one end and the bottom at the other, the volume is half the tank&#39;s volume. If the tank&#39;s full volume is length*width*height, then tilting it such that the water forms a diagonal would give a volume of half. So, if the aquarium is 10 wide, 8 high, and length L, full volume is 10*8*L = 80L. Half of that is 40L. When leveled, the depth would be 40L / (10L) = 4&quot;, which is option E. But the problem says &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot;, which might mean it&#39;s three-fourths of the full volume? Then the volume would be 60L, leading to a depth of 6&quot;, which isn&#39;t an option. But maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to something else.Wait, maybe &quot;rectangular room&quot; refers to the surface area of the water when tilted. If the water&#39;s surface is a rectangle, then its area is length*width. If the aquarium is tilted, the water&#39;s surface area might be larger. If it&#39;s three-fourths of that, then... Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; is a typo and should be &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular base&quot;. Then, when tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the base. If the base is 10 inches wide and length L, three-fourths is 7.5L. The volume of water is then 7.5L * 8&quot;? Wait, no.Alternatively, if the aquarium is tilted so that the water covers the entire 8x10 end, the volume is the area of the end (8x10) multiplied by the average length submerged. If the average length submerged is three-fourths of L, then volume is 80*(3/4)L = 60L. When leveled, depth is 60L/(10L) = 6&quot;. Still not an option.This is frustrating. Maybe I should consider that the &quot;rectangular room&quot; is the horizontal cross-section when tilted. If the aquarium is tilted, the horizontal cross-section (the area you see from above) is a rectangle that&#39;s compressed. If it&#39;s three-fourths of the original, then the area is (3/4)*10*L. The volume would then be that area times the height of the water. But the height when tilted varies.Alternatively, since the problem is from an old exam, maybe the term &quot;rectangular room&quot; refers to the space that the water occupies. When the aquarium is tilted, the water occupies a rectangular prism that is 8x10x(some depth). But only three-fourths of that room is filled. So, the volume is 8*10*(3/4)*something. Not sure.Wait, let&#39;s look at the answer choices. The options are between 2.5&quot; and 4&quot;. If when tilted, the volume of water is such that when leveled, it&#39;s 3&quot;, that might correspond to a scenario where the tilted volume is a triangular prism with a certain height. Let&#39;s suppose that when tilted, the water forms a triangular prism with base 10&quot; and height h, and length L. Then, the volume is (1/2)*10*h*L. When leveled, the volume is 10*L*d. Setting them equal: 5*h*L = 10*d*L =&gt; d = (5h)/10 = h/2. So, the depth when leveled is half the height of the triangular cross-section. The problem states that when tilted, the water covers an 8&quot;x10&quot; end. So, the height h of the triangular cross-section must be 8&quot;. Therefore, d = 8/2 = 4&quot;. But that&#39;s option E. However, the problem also mentions &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot;. If this is accounted for, maybe the height isn&#39;t full 8&quot;, but three-fourths of it. Then, h = 6&quot;, so d = 3&quot;. That would be option B. But why would the height be three-fourths?Wait, maybe when the aquarium is tilted, the water doesn&#39;t reach the full height of 8&quot;, but only three-fourths of the room. If the &quot;room&quot; is the height, then three-fourths of 8&quot; is 6&quot;. Then, the volume is (1/2)*10*6*L = 30L. Leveling it, depth d = 30L/(10L) = 3&quot;, which is option B. That makes sense. But the problem says &quot;covered an 8&#39;&#39;×10&#39;&#39; end&quot;, which would imply that the full 8&quot; height is covered. But if it&#39;s only three-fourths of the room (height), then the water covers 6&quot;. But the problem states it covers the 8x10 end. Hmm, contradiction.Wait, maybe &quot;covered an 8&#39;&#39;×10&#39;&#39; end&quot; means that the water reaches the full 8&quot; height on that end, but due to tilting, on the other end, it only covers three-fourths of the height. So, the shape of the water is a trapezoidal prism. The cross-section is a trapezoid with one base 8&quot; (full height) and the other base (3/4)*8&quot; = 6&quot;. The average height is (8 + 6)/2 = 7&quot;. Then, the area of the cross-section is 7&quot; * 10&quot; (width) = 70 in². Then, volume is 70*L. When leveled, depth d = 70*L / (10*L) = 7&quot;. But 7&quot; isn&#39;t an option. Hmm.Alternatively, if the tilt causes the water to cover the entire 8&quot; on one end and three-fourths of the height on the other end. The cross-section is a trapezoid with bases 8&quot; and 6&quot;, height = 10&quot; (width of the aquarium). Wait, no, the height of the trapezoid would be the length along which the tilt occurs. This is confusing.Maybe another approach: since the problem gives answer choices, and my initial calculation assuming full triangular prism gives 4&quot;, but the problem mentions three-fourths, perhaps the answer is 3&quot;. Maybe the question is saying that when tilted, the water covers three-fourths of the aquarium&#39;s volume, which would make the depth when leveled three-fourths of 4&quot;, which is 3&quot;. But that&#39;s speculative.Alternatively, think of the aquarium as having two ends: 8x10. When tilted, one end is fully submerged (8x10), and the other end is submerged to three-fourths. So, the volume is the average of the two ends times the length. The volume would be [(8x10) + (3/4)(8x10)] / 2 * L = [80 + 60]/2 * L = 70L. When leveled, depth d = 70L / (10L) = 7&quot;. Still not an option.Wait, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to the fact that when tilted, the water&#39;s surface covers three-fourths of the aquarium&#39;s length. If the aquarium&#39;s length is L, then the submerged length is (3/4)L. If the water forms a triangular prism with base 8&quot;, height 10&quot;, and length (3/4)L, then volume is (1/2)*8*10*(3/4)L = 30L. When leveled, depth d = 30L / (10L) = 3&quot;. That gives answer B. This seems plausible. The &quot;rectangular room&quot; might refer to the length of the aquarium, and three-fourths of that length is submerged when tilted. Therefore, the volume is based on three-fourths of the length. That would make sense.So, if the aquarium&#39;s length is L, and when tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the length (the &quot;rectangular room&quot; being the length), then the volume is (1/2)*8*10*(3/4)L = 30L. Then, when leveled, the depth is 30L / (10L) = 3 inches. Therefore, the answer is B) 3&quot;.This seems to fit the problem statement, interpreting &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; as three-fourths of the aquarium&#39;s length. Though the wording is unclear, this leads to one of the answer choices. Given that, I think the answer is 3 inches.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves an aquarium with dimensions 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. When tilted, the water covers an 8&quot;×10&quot; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. We need to find the depth of the water when the aquarium is again made level.1. Understanding the Aquarium Dimensions:   - The aquarium is a rectangular prism with width 10 inches, height 8 inches, and an unspecified length ( L ).2. Interpreting the Tilted Aquarium:   - When tilted, the water covers the entire 8&quot;×10&quot; end, implying the water reaches the full height of 8 inches on one end.   - The phrase &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; is interpreted as three-fourths of the length ( L ) of the aquarium being submerged.3. Volume Calculation When Tilted:   - The water forms a triangular prism when tilted. The volume of a triangular prism is given by ( frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} times text{length} ).   - Here, the base is 10 inches (width), the height is 8 inches (full height), and the length is three-fourths of ( L ).   - Volume when tilted: ( frac{1}{2} times 10 times 8 times frac{3}{4}L = 30L ) cubic inches.4. Volume When Level:   - When the aquarium is level, the volume of water remains the same and is calculated as ( text{length} times text{width} times text{depth} ).   - Setting the volumes equal: ( 10 times L times d = 30L ).5. Solving for Depth:   - ( 10L times d = 30L )   - ( d = frac{30L}{10L} = 3 ) inches.Thus, the depth of the water when the aquarium is again made level is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this aquarium problem. Hmm, so there&#39;s an aquarium that&#39;s on a level table. It has rectangular faces, so it&#39;s probably a rectangular prism. The width is 10 inches and the height is 8 inches. Wait, but they didn&#39;t mention the length? Hmm, maybe that&#39;s part of the problem? Let me read the problem again.&quot;An aquarium on a level table has rectangular faces and is 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. When it was tilted, the water in it covered an 8x10 inch end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. The depth of the water when the bottom was again made level was...&quot;Wait, the problem mentions &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; Maybe that&#39;s a typo? Maybe &quot;rectangular room&quot; should be &quot;rectangular base&quot;? Or maybe &quot;rectangular face&quot;? Let me check the original problem again.Original problem: &quot;...covered an 8x10&quot; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. The depth of the water when the bottom was again made level...&quot;Hmm, &quot;rectangular room&quot; seems odd. Maybe it&#39;s supposed to be &quot;rectangular base&quot;? Because when you tilt the aquarium, the water might cover a certain area of the base. If the original aquarium is 10 inches wide (so one dimension) and 8 inches high, but they don&#39;t mention the length. Wait, maybe the other dimension is the length? So if it&#39;s on a level table, the aquarium&#39;s dimensions are length x width x height. Wait, but the problem says it&#39;s 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. So if it&#39;s a rectangular prism, we have three dimensions: length, width, height. But the problem only gives two: width and height. So maybe the length is missing? Or maybe the 10 inches is the length?Wait, perhaps the aquarium is 10 inches wide (front to back), 8 inches high (vertical), and the length (left to right) is not given. Wait, but the problem mentions that when tilted, the water covered an 8x10 inch end. So when it&#39;s tilted, the end that&#39;s covered is 8x10 inches. So that end must be one of the vertical faces. So maybe the aquarium&#39;s dimensions are length (let&#39;s say L) x width (10 inches) x height (8 inches). So the ends would be length x height, which is L x 8 inches. But the problem says that when tilted, the water covered an 8x10 inch end. So maybe when tilted, the end that&#39;s covered is 8x10 inches. That would mean that when it&#39;s tilted, the end that&#39;s submerged in water has dimensions 8x10. Wait, but the original aquarium&#39;s ends would be either width x height (10x8) or length x height (L x8). Hmm.Wait, perhaps the aquarium is 10 inches in width (front to back), 8 inches in height, and the length (left to right) is the third dimension. So the front and back faces are 10 inches wide by 8 inches high. The left and right ends would be length x height. But the problem mentions that when tilted, the water covers an 8x10 inch end. So maybe when it&#39;s tilted, the water covers one of the ends which is 8x10 inches. But if the original aquarium&#39;s ends (front and back) are 10 inches wide and 8 inches high, then those are 10x8. If you tilt it, maybe that becomes the base? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the aquarium is normally sitting on the table with its base being length x width (L x 10 inches), and the height is 8 inches. When it&#39;s tilted, it&#39;s tilted so that one of the ends (which is L x8 inches) becomes the base, but the water covers only three-fourths of the original base? Wait, this is confusing.Let me parse the problem again:Original aquarium: on a level table, has rectangular faces, 10 inches wide, 8 inches high. So when it&#39;s upright, the base is 10 inches wide (front to back), and the height is 8 inches. But what&#39;s the length? Maybe the length is another dimension. Wait, if it&#39;s on a table, the base would typically be length x width, and height is vertical. So if it&#39;s 10 inches wide (width being front to back), and 8 inches high, then the length (left to right) is another dimension. But the problem doesn&#39;t mention the length. Hmm. Maybe the length is also 8 inches? Because when tilted, the water covers an 8x10 end. Wait, if the aquarium is tilted so that one of its ends is now the base, then that end would be 8x10 inches. But if the original length (left to right) was, say, 12 inches, then tilting it might not result in an 8x10 end. Wait, maybe the aquarium is a cube? But no, it&#39;s 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. So not a cube. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps the aquarium is 10 inches in length, 10 inches in width, and 8 inches in height? Wait, but the problem says it&#39;s 10 inches wide and 8 inches high. Maybe the third dimension (length) is not given, but we can find it? Wait, the problem is asking for the depth of the water when it&#39;s made level again, so maybe the length isn&#39;t necessary? Wait, maybe when it&#39;s tilted, the volume of water can be calculated based on the area covered when tilted, and then when it&#39;s made level again, the depth can be found by dividing the volume by the base area. So maybe we can find the volume when tilted, and then divide by the base area (which would be length x width) to get the depth. But since we don&#39;t know the length, maybe the length cancels out?Wait, let me try to visualize this. When the aquarium is upright, it has a base area (length x width) and height 8 inches. When it&#39;s tilted, the water covers an 8x10 inch end. So maybe tilting it causes the water to form a slanted surface, but covering the entire 8x10 end. However, only three-fourths of the rectangular &quot;room&quot; (maybe they meant &quot;base&quot;) is covered. Wait, the problem says &quot;covered an 8x10&quot; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; Maybe when it&#39;s tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end (which is one of the vertical ends), but only three-fourths of the base (the original base when it was level). Wait, but if it&#39;s tilted, the base would be different. Hmm, this is confusing.Alternatively, maybe &quot;three-fourths of the rectangular room&quot; refers to the floor area of the room? But that seems unrelated. Maybe it&#39;s a mistranslation or typo. Given that the answer choices are in inches, and the problem is about the aquarium, perhaps &quot;rectangular room&quot; was supposed to be &quot;rectangular base&quot;. So when tilted, the water covers the 8x10 end entirely but only three-fourths of the rectangular base. But if the aquarium is tilted, the base would be a different face. Wait, maybe when it&#39;s tilted, it&#39;s resting on one of its ends, so the new base is 8x10 inches (the end), and the water covers three-fourths of that base? But the problem says &quot;covered an 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; Hmm.Wait, perhaps the key here is that the volume of water remains the same whether the aquarium is tilted or level. So if we can find the volume when it&#39;s tilted, then when it&#39;s made level again, the depth will be the volume divided by the base area. Let&#39;s try to approach it that way.First, the aquarium has width 10 inches and height 8 inches. Assuming that the length (the third dimension) is L inches. So the aquarium&#39;s dimensions are L x 10 x 8.When it&#39;s tilted, the water covers an 8x10 end. That suggests that when tilted, the water forms a prism with base area 8x10, but only part of the length. Wait, but the problem says &quot;covered an 8x10&quot; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; If &quot;room&quot; is supposed to be &quot;base,&quot; then when tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end (so area 8x10) but only three-fourths of the base. Wait, but the base when tilted would be different. If it&#39;s resting on the 8x10 end, then the new base is 8x10, and the length is L. So if the water covers three-fourths of the base, then the area covered is (3/4)(8x10). Wait, but then the volume would be (3/4)(8x10) * L. But when it&#39;s upright, the volume is (10xL) * depth, where depth is what we need to find. So setting them equal: (3/4)(8x10xL) = 10xLxdepth. Then depth = (3/4)(8x10xL)/(10xL) = (3/4)*8 = 6 inches. But 6 inches isn&#39;t one of the answer choices. So this approach must be wrong.Alternatively, maybe when it&#39;s tilted, the water forms a slanted surface, and the volume is calculated as a triangular prism or something. Let&#39;s think: if the aquarium is tilted, the water level would form a diagonal. So the shape of the water would be a triangular prism. The volume would then be (1/2)*base*height*length. If the end that&#39;s covered is 8x10, maybe the base of the triangle is 10 inches and the height is 8 inches? So volume would be (1/2)*10*8*L. Then when it&#39;s upright, the volume is 10*L*depth. So (1/2)*10*8*L = 10*L*depth =&gt; depth = (1/2)*8 = 4 inches. But 4 inches is option E, but the answer is supposed to be 3.5 or something. Wait, but the problem says &quot;covered an 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; So maybe the area of the water when tilted is three-fourths of the original base?Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to parse the problem sentence by sentence.Original aquarium: on a level table, has rectangular faces, 10 inches wide, 8 inches high. So dimensions: length (unknown) x width (10&quot;) x height (8&quot;). When it was tilted, the water covered an 8&quot;x10&quot; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular room. The depth of the water when the bottom was again made level was...Wait, maybe &quot;rectangular room&quot; is a mistranslation or typo. Maybe it&#39;s &quot;rectangular base&quot;. So when tilted, the water covers the 8x10 end (so the end that&#39;s now acting as the base when tilted) but only three-fourths of the original rectangular base (when it was level). Hmm. Wait, that might not make sense. If it&#39;s tilted, the base is now the 8x10 end, so why would it cover three-fourths of the original base?Alternatively, when it&#39;s tilted, the water covers an 8x10 end (so the vertical end is covered by water), and three-fourths of the rectangular base (original base) is covered. But how can water cover both an end and part of the base? Maybe when tilted, the water reaches up to the 8x10 end, but only covers three-fourths of the base&#39;s area.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when it&#39;s tilted, the water surface covers the entire 8x10 end (so the vertical face is entirely under water), but the horizontal coverage (the footprint on the table) is only three-fourths of the original base area. But the original base area is length x width (L x10). If it&#39;s tilted, the footprint might change? Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe the &quot;rectangular room&quot; refers to the surface area of the water. When tilted, the water&#39;s surface is a rectangle covering the 8x10 end, but only three-fourths of another rectangle. Hmm, this is unclear.Wait, perhaps looking at the answer choices could help. The options are 2.5, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 4 inches. So the answer is likely between 2.5 and 4. Maybe 3.5? Let&#39;s see. If the volume when tilted is (3/4) of the original volume, then depth would be (3/4)*8 = 6&quot;, but that&#39;s not an option. Alternatively, if the volume is (3/4) of something else.Wait, maybe when the aquarium is tilted, the water forms a triangular prism. The volume would then be (1/2)*base*height*length. If the base is 10 inches (width) and height is 8 inches (height), then the volume is (1/2)*10*8*L. Then when upright, volume is 10*L*depth. So (1/2)*10*8*L =10*L*depth =&gt; depth = 4&quot;. But 4&quot; is an option (E). But the problem says &quot;only three-fourths of the rectangular room.&quot; So maybe my assumption is missing the three-fourths part.Wait, if the problem states that when tilted, the water covers three-fourths of the rectangular room (maybe surface area?), then perhaps the area of the water&#39;s surface is three-fourths of some rectangle. If the water&#39;s surface when tilted is a rectangle that&#39;s 8x10, but only three-fourths of that area? Wait, but 8x10 is 80, three-fourths is 60. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe when it&#39;s tilted, the water occupies three-fourths of the space of the aquarium. But then the depth would be three-fourths of 8, which is 6&quot;, again not an option.Wait, maybe the key is that when the aquarium is tilted, the water covers the entire 8x10 end, which is one vertical face, but only three-fourths of the horizontal base. So the volume of water is the area of the 8x10 end times three-fourths of the length? Wait, maybe the length is 10 inches? Wait, but the width is 10 inches. Hmm.Alternatively, let&#39;s suppose that the aquarium has dimensions length L x width W=10&quot; x height H=8&quot;. When it&#39;s tilted, the water covers the 8x10 end. That suggests that the water reaches the full height of 8&quot; on that end. But the other dimension (length L) is only three-fourths covered? Wait, maybe when tilted, the aquarium is resting on one of its edges, causing the water to form a slanted surface. The area of the water&#39;s surface would then be a rectangle, part of which covers the 8x10 end. Maybe the problem is saying that the water covers the entire 8x10 end (so up to the top) but only three-fourths of the length? So if the aquarium&#39;s length is L, then the volume of water is 8*10*(3/4)L. Then when it&#39;s upright, the volume is L*10*depth. So equate them: 8*10*(3/4)L = L*10*depth =&gt; depth = 8*(3/4) = 6&quot;. Still 6&quot;, which is not an option. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the three-fourths refers to the height. If when tilted, the water covers the 8x10 end but only three-fourths of the height. So the height of the water is 3/4*8 = 6&quot;. Then the volume would be 6*10*L, and when upright, depth = 6*10*L/(10*L) = 6&quot;. Again, 6&quot;, not an option. Hmm.Wait, maybe the problem is that when the aquarium is tilted, the water forms a slanted surface, so the volume is a triangular prism. Let me try that. Suppose the aquarium is tilted so that the water level goes from one corner to another. The volume would then be (1/2)*length*width*height. Wait, but which dimensions?If the aquarium is L x 10 x8. If it&#39;s tilted along the 10&quot; width, then the triangular cross-section would have base 10&quot; and height 8&quot;. So the volume would be (1/2)*10*8*L. Then when upright, the volume is 10*L*depth. So (1/2)*10*8*L =10*L*depth =&gt; depth=4. But 4&quot; is option E, but the problem mentions three-fourths. So maybe the slanted water surface covers three-fourths of the horizontal distance?Wait, maybe instead of the full diagonal, the water covers three-fourths of the length when tilted. So if the aquarium&#39;s length is L, then the horizontal distance covered by the water is (3/4)L. Then the volume would be the area of the triangle times width. Wait, the cross-sectional area would be (1/2)*base*height, where base is (3/4)L and height is 8&quot;. Then volume would be (1/2)*(3/4)L*8*10. When upright, volume is 10*L*depth. So equate:(1/2)*(3/4)L*8*10 =10*L*depthSimplify left side: (1/2)*(3/4)*8*10*L = (3/8)*8*10*L = 3*10*L =30LRight side:10*L*depthSo 30L =10*L*depth =&gt; depth=3. So 3 inches, which is option B. Hmm, that&#39;s one of the options. Let me check that again.Wait, if when tilted, the water covers three-fourths of the length. So the horizontal length of the water surface is (3/4)L, forming a triangle with height 8&quot;. Then cross-sectional area is (1/2)*(3/4)L*8. Then volume is that area times the width (10&quot;). So:Volume = (1/2)*(3/4)L*8*10 = (1/2)*(3/4)*8*10*L = (3/8)*8*10*L = 3*10*LWhen upright, volume =10*L*depthThus, 3*10*L=10*L*depth =&gt; depth=3&quot;Which is answer choice B. That seems plausible. So the answer is 3 inches.But let me make sure. The key idea is that when the aquarium is tilted, the water surface is a plane that covers the entire 8&quot; height on one end but only extends three-fourths of the way along the length. So the shape of the water is a triangular prism with cross-section a right triangle with legs of 8&quot; and (3/4)L. Then the volume is (1/2)*8*(3/4)L*10. Then depth is 3&quot;.Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is 3&quot;, option B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves an aquarium with dimensions 10 inches wide (width) and 8 inches high (height). When tilted, the water covers an 8&quot; x 10&quot; end but only three-fourths of the rectangular base. We need to find the depth of the water when the aquarium is again made level.1. Understanding the Aquarium Dimensions:   - The aquarium is a rectangular prism with width 10 inches, height 8 inches, and an unknown length ( L ).2. Volume Calculation When Tilted:   - When tilted, the water covers the entire 8&quot; x 10&quot; end but only three-fourths of the length ( L ). This forms a triangular prism.   - The cross-sectional area of the water when tilted is a right triangle with legs 8 inches (height) and (frac{3}{4}L) (three-fourths of the length).   - The volume of water is calculated as:     [     text{Volume} = frac{1}{2} times 8 times left(frac{3}{4}Lright) times 10     ]   - Simplifying this:     [     text{Volume} = frac{1}{2} times 8 times frac{3}{4}L times 10 = frac{1}{2} times 6L times 10 = 3 times 10 times L = 30L     ]3. Volume Calculation When Level:   - When the aquarium is level, the volume of water is:     [     text{Volume} = 10 times L times text{depth}     ]4. Equating the Volumes:   - Setting the volumes equal:     [     30L = 10L times text{depth}     ]   - Solving for depth:     [     text{depth} = frac{30L}{10L} = 3 text{ inches}     ]Thus, the depth of the water when the aquarium is again made level is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-817cadee></div><p class="review-content" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>🔑:</span>1. Understanding the problem: The aquarium has a rectangular base of dimensions (10) inches by (8) inches and is (8) inches high. When tilted, the water covers an (8 times 10) end but only three-fourths of the rectangular bottom. We need to find the depth of the water when the aquarium is level again.2. Visualizing the tilt: When the aquarium is tilted, the water forms a right triangle on the (8 times 10) end. The height of this triangle is (8) inches (the height of the aquarium), and the base of the triangle is (frac{3}{4} times 10 = 7.5) inches (since it covers three-fourths of the bottom).3. Calculating the area of the triangle: The area of the water triangle when tilted is:   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 7.5 times 8 = 30 text{ square inches}   ]4. Finding the volume of water: Since the area of the triangle represents the cross-sectional area of the water, and the width of the aquarium is (10) inches, the volume of the water is:   [   text{Volume} = text{Area} times text{width} = 30 times 10 = 300 text{ cubic inches}   ]5. Calculating the depth of water when level: When the aquarium is level, the water will form a rectangular prism with a base area of (10 times 8 = 80) square inches. Let (h) be the depth of the water. The volume of the water is:   [   text{Volume} = text{base area} times text{depth} = 80 times h   ]   Setting this equal to the volume of water calculated earlier:   [   80h = 300   ]   Solving for (h):   [   h = frac{300}{80} = 3.75 text{ inches}   ]6. Conclusion: The depth of the water when the aquarium is level is (3.75) inches.The final answer is (boxed{3.75})</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-fe07697a data-v-817cadee><div class="review" data-v-817cadee><div class="review-title" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>❓:</span>Form a five-digit number with the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition and ensuring that the digits 1 and 2 are not adjacent.

The problem is to form a five-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repeating any digits, and making sure that the digits 1 and 2 are not next to each other. We need to find out how many such numbers there are. Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this.First, without any restrictions, the number of five-digit numbers we can form with digits 1-5 without repetition is just 5 factorial, right? Which is 5! = 120. But since we have a restriction here, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where 1 and 2 are adjacent. That makes sense. So, total valid numbers = total permutations - permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent. Yeah, that&#39;s a common technique in combinatorics: subtracting the unwanted cases from the total.So, how do we calculate the number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent? Well, when two specific digits are adjacent, we can treat them as a single unit or &quot;block.&quot; So instead of having five separate digits, we have this block plus the other three digits, making it four units in total. Then, the number of ways to arrange these four units is 4! = 24. But wait, within the block, 1 and 2 can be in two different orders: 1 followed by 2 or 2 followed by 1. So, we need to multiply by 2. Therefore, the number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent is 4! * 2 = 24 * 2 = 48. Therefore, the number of valid permutations should be 5! - 4! * 2 = 120 - 48 = 72. So, the answer is 72. Hmm, but wait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Wait, so total permutations are 5! = 120. Then, treating 1 and 2 as a single block, so we have four elements: [1-2], 3, 4, 5. These four can be arranged in 4! ways, and the block itself can be [1-2] or [2-1], so times 2. So, 24 * 2 = 48. Then, subtracting that from 120 gives 72. That seems correct. But let me think if there&#39;s another way to approach this problem, maybe using inclusion-exclusion or something else, just to confirm the answer. Alternatively, we could calculate the valid permutations by considering positions for 1 and 2 such that they are not adjacent.Suppose we first place the digits 1 and 2 in the five-digit number such that they are not adjacent, and then arrange the remaining digits 3, 4, 5 in the remaining positions. So, how many ways can we place 1 and 2 non-adjacent? Let&#39;s see.In a five-digit number, there are 5 positions. We need to choose two positions for 1 and 2 such that they are not next to each other. The number of ways to choose two positions out of five is C(5,2) = 10. But from these 10, how many are adjacent? Let&#39;s count the adjacent pairs. In five positions, the adjacent pairs are positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5. So, four adjacent pairs. Therefore, the number of non-adjacent pairs is 10 - 4 = 6. Then, for each such non-adjacent pair of positions, we can arrange 1 and 2 in 2! ways (either 1 first or 2 first). Then, for the remaining three positions, we arrange 3, 4, 5 in 3! ways. Therefore, total number of permutations is 6 * 2! * 3! = 6 * 2 * 6 = 72. Same answer. So that confirms it. So, either way, the answer is 72. Therefore, the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the conditions is 72. Hmm, that seems solid. Both methods give the same result, so I feel confident about it.But just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Let&#39;s consider the total number of permutations, 5! = 120. The number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent is 48, as calculated before. Then, 120 - 48 = 72. Alternatively, if I think in terms of complement probability, but in combinatorics here, it&#39;s straightforward subtraction.Alternatively, could I use the inclusion-exclusion principle here? Let me see. The total number of permutations is 5! The number of permutations where 1 is adjacent to 2 is calculated by considering them as a single entity. So, yes, as above, that&#39;s inclusion-exclusion. So, perhaps that&#39;s the same as the first method. So, in any case, all methods point to 72. Another way: think of the problem as placing the 1 and 2 such that they are not next to each other. Let&#39;s fix the position of 1 first. Then, count the number of available positions for 2. Then, multiply by the number of permutations for the remaining digits.Suppose we fix 1 in the first position. Then, 2 cannot be in the second position. So, 2 can be in positions 3, 4, or 5. That&#39;s 3 choices. Then, the remaining three digits (3,4,5) can be arranged in the remaining three positions in 3! = 6 ways. Similarly, if 1 is in the second position, then 2 cannot be in positions 1 or 3. So, 2 can be in positions 4 or 5. That&#39;s 2 choices. Then, the remaining digits have 3! arrangements. If 1 is in the third position, then 2 cannot be in positions 2 or 4. So, 2 can be in positions 1 or 5. Again, 2 choices. If 1 is in the fourth position, similar to when 1 is in the second position: 2 cannot be in positions 3 or 5, so 2 can be in positions 1 or 2. That&#39;s 2 choices. Finally, if 1 is in the fifth position, similar to the first position: 2 cannot be in position 4, so 2 can be in positions 1, 2, or 3. 3 choices.So, let&#39;s tabulate this:- 1 in position 1: 3 choices for 2, then 6 permutations: 3*6=18- 1 in position 2: 2 choices for 2, then 6 permutations: 2*6=12- 1 in position 3: 2 choices for 2, then 6 permutations: 2*6=12- 1 in position 4: 2 choices for 2, then 6 permutations: 2*6=12- 1 in position 5: 3 choices for 2, then 6 permutations: 3*6=18Adding these up: 18 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 18 = 72. Yep, same answer. So regardless of the method, we get 72. That seems pretty conclusive.So, the answer should be 72. Therefore, the number of such five-digit numbers is boxed{72}.Final AnswerThe number of such five-digit numbers is boxed{72}.&lt;/think&gt;To form a five-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition and ensuring that the digits 1 and 2 are not adjacent, we can use the following reasoning:1. Total permutations without any restrictions: The total number of five-digit numbers that can be formed is (5! = 120).2. Permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent:   - Treat 1 and 2 as a single unit or &quot;block&quot;. This reduces the problem to arranging 4 units (the block and the digits 3, 4, 5).   - The number of ways to arrange these 4 units is (4!).   - Within the block, 1 and 2 can be in two different orders (1 followed by 2 or 2 followed by 1), so we multiply by 2.   - Therefore, the number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent is (4! times 2 = 24 times 2 = 48).3. Subtracting the unwanted cases:   - Subtract the number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent from the total permutations: (120 - 48 = 72).This result can be verified using different methods, such as counting non-adjacent positions for 1 and 2, or fixing the position of 1 and counting valid positions for 2. All methods consistently yield the same result.Thus, the number of five-digit numbers formed with the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition and ensuring that 1 and 2 are not adjacent is (boxed{72}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out how many five-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repeating any digits, and also making sure that the digits 1 and 2 aren&#39;t next to each other. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, if there were no restrictions, the total number of five-digit numbers we could form is just the number of permutations of 5 distinct digits. Since all digits are unique and we have to use all of them, that would be 5 factorial, which is 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. So there are 120 possible numbers without any restrictions.But now we have a restriction: digits 1 and 2 can&#39;t be adjacent. Hmm, how do we account for that? I remember that sometimes it&#39;s easier to calculate the total number without restrictions and then subtract the number of arrangements that violate the restriction. That should give us the valid number of arrangements.So, total valid numbers = total permutations - permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent. Let&#39;s use that approach.First, let&#39;s calculate the number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent. To do this, I can treat the pair &quot;1 and 2&quot; as a single unit or &quot;block.&quot; Then, instead of having 5 separate digits, we have this block plus the other three digits: 3, 4, 5. So that&#39;s a total of 4 &quot;units&quot; to arrange: the block, 3, 4, 5.The number of ways to arrange these 4 units is 4! = 24. But wait, within the block, the digits 1 and 2 can be in two different orders: &quot;1 2&quot; or &quot;2 1&quot;. So we need to multiply by 2 to account for both possibilities. Therefore, the total number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent is 4! × 2 = 24 × 2 = 48.So, subtracting that from the total permutations: 120 - 48 = 72. Therefore, there should be 72 valid five-digit numbers where 1 and 2 are not adjacent.Wait a second, let me verify this. Let&#39;s make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in calculating the adjacent cases. So when we consider the block of 1 and 2, we have 4 units: block, 3, 4, 5. These can indeed be arranged in 4! ways, and the block itself can have 2 arrangements, so 4!×2=48. That seems right.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: how many positions can the 1 and 2 occupy such that they are next to each other? In a five-digit number, there are 4 possible adjacent pairs: positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5. For each of these pairs, 1 and 2 can be arranged in 2 ways. Then the remaining 3 digits can be arranged in the remaining 3 positions. So that would be 4 (pairs) × 2 (arrangements of 1 and 2) × 3! (arrangements of the remaining digits) = 4 × 2 × 6 = 48. Yep, same result. So that part checks out.Therefore, subtracting these 48 invalid permutations from the total 120 gives us 72 valid permutations. So the answer should be 72. But let me just think if there&#39;s another angle to approach this problem.Alternatively, maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle? But I think that&#39;s essentially what I did here. The inclusion-exclusion principle says that the number of elements not in any of the restricted sets is equal to the total minus the number in the restricted sets. Here, the restricted set is the permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent. So yes, subtracting those gives the valid permutations.Alternatively, could I compute it directly? Like, first place the digits 1 and 2 such that they are not adjacent, and then arrange the other digits. Let&#39;s see.First, arrange all five digits such that 1 and 2 are not adjacent. Let&#39;s first place the other digits: 3, 4, 5. Then insert 1 and 2 into the gaps so they aren&#39;t adjacent.Wait, that&#39;s a common strategy for permutation with restrictions. So let&#39;s try that.First, arrange the three digits 3, 4, 5. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them. For example, one arrangement is 3, 4, 5. Then, how many gaps are there to insert the remaining digits 1 and 2? Well, in the case of three digits, there are 4 gaps: before the first digit, between the first and second, between the second and third, and after the third. So, for example, _ 3 _ 4 _ 5 _.We need to choose two different gaps to place 1 and 2. Since 1 and 2 can&#39;t be adjacent, we don&#39;t want them in the same gap or in adjacent gaps. Wait, actually, inserting them into different gaps ensures they aren&#39;t adjacent. Because if they are in different gaps, then there&#39;s at least one digit between them.Wait, actually, in the linear arrangement, if you insert 1 and 2 into two different gaps, they can&#39;t be adjacent. For example, if you put 1 in the first gap and 2 in the second gap, then 1 is before 3, and 2 is between 3 and 4, so they are separated by the 3. Similarly, any two different gaps will result in 1 and 2 not being adjacent.So the number of ways to insert 1 and 2 is the number of ways to choose 2 distinct gaps out of 4, which is C(4,2) = 6. Then, for each of these choices, we can arrange 1 and 2 in order: 1 first then 2, or 2 first then 1. So that&#39;s 2! = 2 ways.Therefore, the total number of valid permutations would be 3! × C(4,2) × 2! = 6 × 6 × 2 = 72. Which matches our previous result. So that&#39;s another way to confirm it.So both methods give 72, which is reassuring.Wait, let me double-check with another approach. Let&#39;s fix the positions of 1 and 2.How many ways can we place 1 and 2 in the five-digit number such that they are not adjacent?First, the total number of ways to choose two positions out of five for digits 1 and 2 is C(5,2) = 10. Then, for each pair of positions, if they are not adjacent, then we count them. Then, for each valid pair of positions, we can arrange 1 and 2 in 2 ways, and the remaining digits in 3! ways. So, total number would be [number of non-adjacent pairs] × 2 × 6.So, how many non-adjacent pairs are there in five positions?Total pairs: C(5,2) = 10.Number of adjacent pairs: in a 5-position line, the adjacent pairs are positions (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). So 4 adjacent pairs. Therefore, non-adjacent pairs are 10 - 4 = 6.Therefore, number of valid permutations is 6 × 2 × 6 = 72. Again, same answer. So this method also gives 72. So three different methods all leading to the same answer. That gives me confidence that 72 is the correct number.Therefore, the number of five-digit numbers formed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition and with 1 and 2 not adjacent is 72.Final AnswerThe number of such five-digit numbers is boxed{72}.&lt;/think&gt;To form a five-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition and ensuring that the digits 1 and 2 are not adjacent, we can follow these steps:1. Calculate the total number of permutations without restrictions:    [   5! = 120   ]2. Calculate the number of permutations where 1 and 2 are adjacent:   - Treat the pair &quot;1 and 2&quot; as a single unit or &quot;block&quot;. This gives us 4 units to arrange: the block, 3, 4, 5.   - The number of ways to arrange these 4 units is (4!):     [     4! = 24     ]   - The block &quot;1 and 2&quot; can be arranged in 2 ways (1 followed by 2 or 2 followed by 1):     [     24 times 2 = 48     ]3. Subtract the invalid permutations from the total permutations:   [   120 - 48 = 72   ]4. Verification using alternative methods:   - Arranging 3, 4, 5 first and inserting 1 and 2 into gaps:     - Arrange 3, 4, 5: (3! = 6)     - Choose 2 gaps out of 4: (binom{4}{2} = 6)     - Arrange 1 and 2 in the gaps: (2! = 2)     - Total permutations: (6 times 6 times 2 = 72)   - Counting non-adjacent pairs:     - Total pairs of positions: (binom{5}{2} = 10)     - Adjacent pairs: 4     - Non-adjacent pairs: (10 - 4 = 6)     - Total permutations: (6 times 2 times 3! = 6 times 2 times 6 = 72)Thus, the number of valid five-digit numbers is (boxed{72}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-817cadee></div><p class="review-content" data-v-817cadee><span class="icon" data-v-817cadee>🔑:</span>According to the problem, to form a five-digit number without repetition and ensuring that the digits 1 and 2 are not adjacent, we can use the slot method.

The options are A: 2, B: 6, C: ( sqrt{2} ), D: ( sqrt{6} ). Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, I remember that expressions involving ( x ) and ( x^{-1} ) can sometimes be simplified by squaring them or by using substitution. Since the problem is asking for ( x^{1/2} + x^{-1/2} ), maybe if I let ( y = x^{1/2} + x^{-1/2} ), then squaring both sides might help relate it to the given equation. Let me try that.Let ( y = x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} ). Then, squaring both sides gives:[y^2 = left( x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} right)^2]Expanding the right side:[y^2 = left( x^{frac{1}{2}} right)^2 + 2 cdot x^{frac{1}{2}} cdot x^{-frac{1}{2}} + left( x^{-frac{1}{2}} right)^2]Simplifying each term:- The first term is ( x^{frac{1}{2} cdot 2} = x^{1} = x )- The middle term is ( 2 cdot x^{frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}} = 2 cdot x^{0} = 2 cdot 1 = 2 )- The last term is ( x^{-frac{1}{2} cdot 2} = x^{-1} )So putting it all together:[y^2 = x + 2 + x^{-1}]But wait, from the problem statement, we know that ( x + x^{-1} = 4 ). So substituting that into the equation above:[y^2 = 4 + 2 = 6]Therefore, ( y^2 = 6 ), so ( y = sqrt{6} ) or ( y = -sqrt{6} ). However, the problem states that ( x &gt; 0 ). Let&#39;s check if ( x^{1/2} + x^{-1/2} ) can be negative. Since ( x &gt; 0 ), both ( x^{1/2} ) and ( x^{-1/2} ) are positive real numbers. The sum of two positive numbers is also positive. Therefore, ( y ) must be positive. Hence, ( y = sqrt{6} ). Looking at the options provided, D is ( sqrt{6} ). Therefore, the answer should be D.Wait, let me verify this again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Let me go through each step once more.Starting with ( x + x^{-1} = 4 ). Let ( y = sqrt{x} + frac{1}{sqrt{x}} ). Then, squaring ( y ):( y^2 = (sqrt{x} + frac{1}{sqrt{x}})^2 = x + 2 + frac{1}{x} ). Which is the same as ( (x + frac{1}{x}) + 2 ). Since ( x + frac{1}{x} = 4 ), then ( y^2 = 4 + 2 = 6 ). So ( y = sqrt{6} ). Yes, that seems right. Therefore, the correct answer is D.Alternatively, maybe we can solve for ( x ) first? Let&#39;s see. If ( x + x^{-1} = 4 ), multiply both sides by ( x ):[x^2 + 1 = 4x]Which rearranges to:[x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0]Using the quadratic formula, ( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{(4)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3} ).Since ( x &gt; 0 ), both solutions are positive because ( 2 + sqrt{3} ) is obviously positive and ( 2 - sqrt{3} ) is approximately 2 - 1.732 = 0.268, which is also positive. So ( x = 2 + sqrt{3} ) or ( x = 2 - sqrt{3} ).Now, let&#39;s compute ( sqrt{x} + frac{1}{sqrt{x}} ).Take ( x = 2 + sqrt{3} ). Then ( sqrt{x} ) would be ( sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} ). Similarly, ( frac{1}{sqrt{x}} = sqrt{frac{1}{2 + sqrt{3}}} ). Maybe rationalizing the denominator:( frac{1}{sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}} = sqrt{frac{1}{2 + sqrt{3}}} times sqrt{frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2 - sqrt{3}}} = sqrt{frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{(2 + sqrt{3})(2 - sqrt{3})}} = sqrt{frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{4 - 3}} = sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}} ).So, ( sqrt{x} + frac{1}{sqrt{x}} = sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} + sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}} ). Let me compute this.Let me square this sum to check:( (sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} + sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}})^2 = (2 + sqrt{3}) + 2 cdot sqrt{(2 + sqrt{3})(2 - sqrt{3})} + (2 - sqrt{3}) )Simplifying each term:First term: 2 + sqrt3Second term: 2 times sqrt{(4 - (sqrt3)^2)} = 2 * sqrt{4 - 3} = 2*1 = 2Third term: 2 - sqrt3Adding them all together: (2 + sqrt3 + 2 - sqrt3) + 2 = (4) + 2 = 6Therefore, the square is 6, so the original expression is sqrt6. Therefore, that&#39;s consistent with the previous method.Similarly, if x was 2 - sqrt3, then sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x) would also be sqrt6? Let me check.If x = 2 - sqrt3, then sqrt(x) would be sqrt(2 - sqrt3), and 1/sqrt(x) is sqrt(2 + sqrt3), as before. So again, sqrt(2 - sqrt3) + sqrt(2 + sqrt3) which is the same as before, so the same result sqrt6. So yes, either way, the result is sqrt6. Therefore, answer D is correct.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach? Let me think. Maybe using substitution variables or another algebraic manipulation, but I think the methods above are solid. Since both methods lead to the answer sqrt6, I think that&#39;s correct. So the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given ( x + x^{-1} = 4 ) (where ( x &gt; 0 )), we need to find the value of ( x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} ).Let ( y = x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} ). Squaring both sides, we get:[y^2 = left( x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} right)^2]Expanding the right-hand side:[y^2 = x + 2 + x^{-1}]We know from the given equation that ( x + x^{-1} = 4 ). Substituting this into the equation:[y^2 = 4 + 2 = 6]Thus, ( y = sqrt{6} ) (since ( x &gt; 0 ), ( y ) must be positive).To verify, we solve the quadratic equation derived from ( x + x^{-1} = 4 ):[x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0]The solutions are ( x = 2 pm sqrt{3} ). Both solutions are positive. Calculating ( sqrt{x} + frac{1}{sqrt{x}} ) for ( x = 2 + sqrt{3} ) or ( x = 2 - sqrt{3} ) results in ( sqrt{6} ).Thus, the value of ( x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} ) is ( sqrt{6} ).[boxed{D}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is: Given that x plus its reciprocal equals 4, and x is greater than 0. We need to find the value of the square root of x plus the reciprocal of the square root of x. The options are A: 2, B: 6, C: square root of 2, D: square root of 6. Hmm. Alright, let&#39;s break this down.First, the given equation is x + 1/x = 4. And we need to find sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x). Let me denote sqrt(x) as t. Then, 1/sqrt(x) would be 1/t. So, the expression we need is t + 1/t. Maybe if I can express t + 1/t in terms of x + 1/x, that would help. Let&#39;s see.But sqrt(x) is x^(1/2). So, t = x^(1/2). Then t squared is x. So, t^2 = x. Similarly, 1/t^2 = 1/x. So, maybe if I can relate t + 1/t to t^2 + 1/t^2, which is x + 1/x. That seems like a possible approach.We know that (t + 1/t)^2 = t^2 + 2*(t)*(1/t) + 1/t^2. Which simplifies to t^2 + 2 + 1/t^2. So, that&#39;s equal to (x + 1/x) + 2. Because t^2 is x and 1/t^2 is 1/x. Therefore, (t + 1/t)^2 = (x + 1/x) + 2. Since x + 1/x is given as 4, then substituting that in, we have (t + 1/t)^2 = 4 + 2 = 6. Therefore, t + 1/t is sqrt(6). Since the problem states that x is positive, sqrt(x) is also positive, so t is positive. Therefore, t + 1/t is positive sqrt(6). So, the answer should be D: sqrt(6). Let me check if there&#39;s any mistake here.Wait, let&#39;s go through it step by step again to confirm. Let me verify the algebra.Starting with (sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x))^2. Expanding this, we get (sqrt(x))^2 + 2*sqrt(x)*(1/sqrt(x)) + (1/sqrt(x))^2. That&#39;s x + 2 + 1/x. Then, x + 1/x is given as 4, so substituting that in, we get 4 + 2 = 6. Therefore, the square of the desired expression is 6, so the expression itself is sqrt(6). Since x is positive, sqrt(x) is real and positive, so the expression is positive sqrt(6). Therefore, the answer is D. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute x first from the equation x + 1/x = 4 and then compute sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x). Let&#39;s try that approach to double-check.Starting with x + 1/x = 4. Let&#39;s multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator. So, x^2 + 1 = 4x. Bringing all terms to one side, we have x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. This is a quadratic equation. The solutions are x = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 4*1*1)] / 2 = [4 ± sqrt(12)] / 2 = [4 ± 2*sqrt(3)] / 2 = 2 ± sqrt(3). Since x is positive, both solutions are positive because 2 + sqrt(3) is definitely positive, and 2 - sqrt(3) is approximately 2 - 1.732 = 0.267, which is also positive. So, x could be either 2 + sqrt(3) or 2 - sqrt(3).Let&#39;s take x = 2 + sqrt(3). Then sqrt(x) would be sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)). Hmm, I need to compute sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) + 1/sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)). Let&#39;s compute this expression.Let’s denote s = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)). Then 1/s = 1/sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)). Let me rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)):1/s = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) / (2 + sqrt(3)). Hmm, maybe there&#39;s a better way. Alternatively, note that sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Let me try to express sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).Suppose sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Then squaring both sides, we get 2 + sqrt(3) = a + b + 2*sqrt(ab). Comparing the terms, we have:a + b = 2,and2*sqrt(ab) = sqrt(3). Squaring both sides, 4ab = 3. Therefore, ab = 3/4.So, we have a + b = 2 and ab = 3/4. The solutions for a and b would be the roots of the equation t^2 - 2t + 3/4 = 0. Solving this, t = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 3)] / 2 = [2 ± 1]/2, so t = 3/2 or t = 1/2. Therefore, a = 3/2 and b = 1/2. So, sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3/2) + sqrt(1/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(3) + 1)/sqrt(2). Therefore, sqrt(x) = (sqrt(3) + 1)/sqrt(2), and 1/sqrt(x) = sqrt(2)/(sqrt(3) + 1). Let me rationalize this denominator.Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) - 1):sqrt(2)/(sqrt(3) + 1) * (sqrt(3) - 1)/(sqrt(3) - 1) = sqrt(2)(sqrt(3) - 1)/( (sqrt(3))^2 -1^2 ) = sqrt(2)(sqrt(3) -1)/(3 -1) = sqrt(2)(sqrt(3) -1)/2.So, 1/sqrt(x) = [sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)] / 2.Therefore, sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x) = (sqrt(3) + 1)/sqrt(2) + [sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)] / 2.Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, let&#39;s compute numerically.Let me compute x = 2 + sqrt(3). Then sqrt(x) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)). Let&#39;s approximate sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. Therefore, 2 + sqrt(3) ≈ 3.732. Then sqrt(3.732) ≈ 1.931. Then 1/sqrt(3.732) ≈ 1/1.931 ≈ 0.517. Therefore, 1.931 + 0.517 ≈ 2.448. Now, sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449. So, close to that. Therefore, the answer is approximately sqrt(6). So, that matches the previous result.Alternatively, if x is 2 - sqrt(3). Then x ≈ 2 - 1.732 ≈ 0.267. Then sqrt(x) ≈ sqrt(0.267) ≈ 0.517. Then 1/sqrt(x) ≈ 1/0.517 ≈ 1.931. Then 0.517 + 1.931 ≈ 2.448 again, which is approximately sqrt(6). So, regardless of which root x takes, sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x) is sqrt(6). Therefore, the answer is D.Therefore, both methods lead to the conclusion that the value is sqrt(6). So, I think the correct answer is D. Let me check again the steps to make sure there is no mistake.First method: Let t = sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x). Then t^2 = x + 2 + 1/x = (x + 1/x) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6. Therefore, t = sqrt(6). Since x is positive, sqrt(x) is positive, so t is positive. Therefore, answer is D. Seems solid.Second method: Solving quadratic equation, getting x = 2 ± sqrt(3), then computing sqrt(x) + 1/sqrt(x) numerically gives approximately sqrt(6). So, both methods confirm.Therefore, the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation ( x + frac{1}{x} = 4 ) where ( x &gt; 0 ), we need to find the value of ( x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} ).First, let ( t = x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} ). Then, squaring both sides, we get:[t^2 = left( x^{frac{1}{2}} + x^{-frac{1}{2}} right)^2 = x + 2 + frac{1}{x}]We know from the given equation that ( x + frac{1}{x} = 4 ). Substituting this into the equation for ( t^2 ), we have:[t^2 = 4 + 2 = 6]Taking the square root of both sides, we get:[t = sqrt{6}]Since ( x &gt; 0 ), ( x^{frac{1}{2}} ) is positive, so ( t ) must be positive.
