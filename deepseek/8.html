Hmm, let&#39;s start by recalling some properties of hyperbolas.First, the standard equation of the hyperbola is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1. The foci are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². The eccentricity e is c/a, which is what we need to find. So, e = c/a, and since c = √(a² + b²), e = √(1 + (b²/a²)). Therefore, if I can find the relationship between a and b, I can determine e.Now, the asymptotes of this hyperbola are the lines y = ±(b/a)x. The problem states that a line passing through the right focus F (which is at (c, 0)) with a slope of 1 intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. Wait, but two lines can intersect at exactly one point unless they are parallel. But if the line through the focus has a slope of 1, and the asymptotes have slopes ±b/a. If the line is not parallel to the asymptote, they will intersect at one point. But if they are parallel, they would never intersect or coincide. However, the problem says that the line intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. But normally, two lines with different slopes intersect at one point. So, maybe the line is tangent to the asymptote? But asymptotes are straight lines, so a line can&#39;t be tangent to another line unless they coincide. That can&#39;t be. Wait, maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem.Wait, let me read it again: &quot;a line passing through the right focus F of the hyperbola with a slope of 1 intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. Hmm. If a line with slope 1 passes through the focus (c, 0), then the equation of that line is y = x - c. Because the slope is 1, so y = 1*(x - c). Now, the asymptotes are y = (b/a)x and y = -(b/a)x. So, we need to find where the line y = x - c intersects these asymptotes.But normally, a line with slope 1 will intersect each asymptote (which have slopes ±b/a) unless they are parallel. So, if the line y = x - c is parallel to one of the asymptotes, then they won&#39;t intersect. But if they aren&#39;t parallel, they will intersect at exactly one point. However, the problem says that the line intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. Wait, but unless the line is tangent to the hyperbola? Wait, no, the line is intersecting the asymptote, not the hyperbola. So, maybe the problem is that the line is tangent to the hyperbola and also passes through the focus? But the problem states that the line intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. Hmm.Wait, but if the line is intersecting the asymptote at exactly one point, but asymptotes are straight lines. Two lines intersect at exactly one point unless they are parallel. So, if the line with slope 1 is not parallel to the asymptote, they will intersect at one point. If they are parallel, they don&#39;t intersect. So, maybe the problem is saying that the line is tangent to the hyperbola and also passes through the focus, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s written. Let me check again.Wait, the problem says: &quot;a line passing through the right focus F of the hyperbola with a slope of 1 intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. So, the line passes through the focus, has a slope of 1, and intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. Since asymptotes are lines, the only way a line can intersect another line at exactly one point is if they are not parallel. If they are parallel, they either don&#39;t intersect or are coincident (which would be infinitely many points). So, if the line intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point, then they must not be parallel. But the problem states that this is the case. Wait, but how is this a special condition? Any line with slope 1 through the focus will intersect each asymptote (unless it&#39;s parallel) at one point each. So, maybe the problem is saying that it intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point, meaning that for the other asymptote, it&#39;s parallel? So, the line is parallel to one asymptote and intersects the other? That would make sense. So, if the line with slope 1 is parallel to one of the asymptotes, then it won&#39;t intersect that asymptote, and will intersect the other asymptote at one point. So, the problem is probably implying that the line is parallel to one asymptote (hence, intersects the other asymptote at one point). Therefore, the slope of the line (which is 1) must be equal to the slope of one of the asymptotes. The asymptotes have slopes ±b/a. So, either 1 = b/a or 1 = -b/a. Since a and b are positive, 1 = b/a, so b = a. Therefore, if b = a, then the eccentricity e = c/a = √(a² + b²)/a = √(2a²)/a = √2. So, the eccentricity is √2. Wait, but is that correct? Let me verify.Wait, if the line has slope 1 and is parallel to the asymptote y = (b/a)x, then setting 1 = b/a gives b = a. Then c² = a² + b² = 2a², so c = a√2, hence e = c/a = √2. Alternatively, if the line is parallel to the other asymptote y = - (b/a)x, then we would have 1 = -b/a, which would give b = -a, but since b &gt; 0 and a &gt; 0, this is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is b = a, leading to e = √2. So, the answer should be √2. But let me check this again because the problem says &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. If the line is parallel to one asymptote, then it will only intersect the other asymptote. But if the line is not parallel to any asymptote, then it would intersect both asymptotes at one point each. So, the problem states that it intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. So, does that mean it only intersects one asymptote? Then, that would require the line to be parallel to the other asymptote, hence only intersecting one asymptote. Therefore, the slope of the line (1) must match the slope of one asymptote, leading to b/a = 1. Hence, e = √(1 + (b/a)^2) = √(1 + 1) = √2. So, that seems to make sense.Alternatively, perhaps there is another interpretation. Maybe the line is tangent to an asymptote? But asymptotes are lines, and a line can only be tangent to another line if they are the same line. But the line in question has slope 1 and passes through (c, 0). The asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x. So, unless (c, 0) lies on the asymptote, which would mean 0 = ±(b/a)c, but c is non-zero, so that&#39;s not possible. Therefore, the line cannot coincide with the asymptote. Therefore, the only way for the line to intersect one asymptote at exactly one point is if it&#39;s parallel to the other asymptote, hence only intersecting one. Therefore, I think my initial reasoning is correct: slope of the line is 1, which must equal one of the asymptotes&#39; slopes. Since the asymptotes have slopes ±b/a, and 1 must equal either b/a or -b/a. But since b and a are positive, 1 = b/a, so b = a. Therefore, the eccentricity is √2. But let me double-check this with equations. Let&#39;s write the equations of the asymptotes and the line. The line is y = x - c. The asymptotes are y = (b/a)x and y = -(b/a)x. Let&#39;s find the intersection points. For the first asymptote y = (b/a)x, set equal to the line: (b/a)x = x - c. Rearranged: (b/a - 1)x + c = 0 =&gt; x = c / (1 - b/a). Similarly, for the second asymptote y = -(b/a)x, set equal to the line: -(b/a)x = x - c =&gt; (-b/a - 1)x + c = 0 =&gt; x = c / (-1 - b/a).Now, if the line is parallel to one of the asymptotes, the denominator in one of these expressions becomes zero. For example, if 1 - b/a = 0, i.e., b/a = 1, then the first equation would have division by zero, meaning no solution (lines are parallel). Similarly, if -1 - b/a = 0, then b/a = -1, which is impossible. Therefore, if b/a = 1, the line y = x - c is parallel to the first asymptote y = (b/a)x = x, and thus does not intersect it, but does intersect the second asymptote y = -x at x = c / (-1 - 1) = c / (-2). So, x = -c/2, y = -(-c/2) = c/2. Wait, but then the line would intersect the second asymptote at (-c/2, c/2). But according to the problem statement, the line intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. Which is true here: since it&#39;s parallel to one asymptote, it only intersects the other asymptote once. So, in this case, the line does intersect one asymptote at exactly one point. Therefore, the condition given in the problem is satisfied when the line is parallel to one asymptote, which happens when 1 = b/a or 1 = -b/a. Since the latter is impossible, we have b/a = 1, so b = a. Therefore, c² = a² + b² = 2a², so c = a√2, and e = c/a = √2.Therefore, the eccentricity is √2. Let me check for any possible mistakes here. If the line is parallel to an asymptote, then it will not intersect that asymptote and will intersect the other one. So, the problem says that the line intersects one asymptote at exactly one point, which is always true unless the line is parallel to both asymptotes, which isn&#39;t possible here. Wait, no. The line can only be parallel to one asymptote at a time. So, if the line is not parallel to either asymptote, it will intersect both asymptotes at one point each. The problem says &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;, which could be interpreted as it only intersects one asymptote (i.e., it&#39;s parallel to the other), which is the case when b/a = 1. Therefore, the answer is √2. That seems solid.Final AnswerThe eccentricity of the hyperbola is boxed{sqrt{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the hyperbola (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1) with (a &gt; 0) and (b &gt; 0), we need to find the eccentricity (e) if a line passing through the right focus (F) with a slope of 1 intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point.1. Hyperbola Properties:   - The foci are located at ((pm c, 0)) where (c^2 = a^2 + b^2).   - The eccentricity (e) is given by (e = frac{c}{a}).   - The asymptotes of the hyperbola are (y = pm frac{b}{a}x).2. Line Equation:   - The line passing through the right focus ((c, 0)) with slope 1 is (y = x - c).3. Intersection with Asymptotes:   - The line (y = x - c) intersects the asymptotes (y = frac{b}{a}x) and (y = -frac{b}{a}x).   - For the line to intersect one asymptote at exactly one point, it must be parallel to the other asymptote. This happens when the slope of the line matches the slope of one asymptote.4. Slope Condition:   - The slope of the line is 1, so we set (frac{b}{a} = 1) (since the other asymptote slope (-frac{b}{a}) cannot be 1 for positive (a) and (b)).   - This gives (b = a).5. Eccentricity Calculation:   - Substituting (b = a) into (c^2 = a^2 + b^2), we get (c^2 = 2a^2), so (c = asqrt{2}).   - The eccentricity (e = frac{c}{a} = sqrt{2}).Thus, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is (boxed{sqrt{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the eccentricity of a hyperbola given a specific condition about a line passing through the right focus with a slope of 1 intersecting one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. Let me recall what the eccentricity is. For a hyperbola, the eccentricity e is given by e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to each focus, and a is the distance from the center to each vertex. So, I need to find e in terms of a and b, but probably it will just be a numerical value since the problem doesn&#39;t mention specific values for a and b. Hmm.First, let me write down the standard equation of the hyperbola: x²/a² - y²/b² = 1. The asymptotes of this hyperbola are the lines y = ±(b/a)x. The foci are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². So the right focus F is at (c, 0).The problem says there&#39;s a line passing through F with a slope of 1. So the equation of this line should be y = 1*(x - c), since it passes through (c, 0). Wait, slope is 1, so using point-slope form: y - 0 = 1*(x - c), so y = x - c. That seems right.This line is supposed to intersect one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. Wait, but asymptotes are lines, so unless the line is parallel to the asymptote, they should intersect at exactly one point. However, if the line is parallel, they don&#39;t intersect. But the asymptotes have slopes ±b/a. The given line has slope 1. So if 1 equals ±b/a, then the line is parallel to one of the asymptotes. But in that case, if it&#39;s parallel, then it would either not intersect (if it&#39;s not the same line) or coincide with it (which would mean infinitely many intersections). However, the problem states that it intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. That seems contradictory if the slopes are equal. So maybe the line is tangent to the asymptote? But asymptotes are straight lines, so a line can&#39;t be tangent to another line unless they coincide, but then they would have infinitely many intersections. Therefore, perhaps the line intersects one of the asymptotes, but only once because the other intersection is at infinity? Wait, that&#39;s not possible in Euclidean geometry.Wait, maybe I&#39;m misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: &quot;a line passing through the right focus F of the hyperbola with a slope of 1 intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. So, if the line is not parallel to the asymptote, then they should intersect at one point. If it is parallel, they don&#39;t intersect. But the problem says the line intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. So, unless maybe the line is tangent to the hyperbola and the asymptote? Wait, but asymptotes aren&#39;t part of the hyperbola. A line can&#39;t be tangent to an asymptote and the hyperbola at the same time. Hmm.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me think again. The line passes through the focus with slope 1. The hyperbola has asymptotes y = ±(b/a)x. If the line intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point, but asymptotes are straight lines, so unless the line is coinciding with the asymptote, which would have infinitely many points. So the only way for a line to intersect an asymptote at exactly one point is if the line is the asymptote itself, but in that case, they would have infinitely many points. Therefore, the problem must be implying something else. Maybe the line is tangent to the hyperbola, and that point of tangency is also on the asymptote? But that&#39;s not necessarily true. Wait, maybe the line intersects the asymptote and the hyperbola at the same point? But the hyperbola doesn&#39;t include its asymptotes. So perhaps the line is tangent to the hyperbola and intersects the asymptote at that same point? But tangency to the hyperbola would require that the line touches the hyperbola at exactly one point, and that point is also on the asymptote? Hmm, that might be possible.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistranslated or misphrased. The original problem says &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. Maybe it means that the line and the asymptote intersect at exactly one point, which is always true unless they are parallel. But if they are not parallel, they intersect at one point. So if the line with slope 1 is not parallel to the asymptotes, which have slopes ±b/a. So if 1 ≠ ±b/a, then the line intersects each asymptote at one point. But the problem says &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. Wait, maybe it only intersects one asymptote? But if the slope is 1, then depending on the asymptotes&#39; slopes, maybe it only intersects one? For example, if the asymptotes are steeper than 1, then a line with slope 1 might only cross one of them? No, because the asymptotes are symmetric. For a hyperbola of the form x²/a² - y²/b² =1, the asymptotes are y= (b/a)x and y=-(b/a)x. So, regardless of the slope of the line, unless it&#39;s parallel to one of them, it should intersect both asymptotes at one point each. Wait, unless the line is arranged such that one of the intersections is at infinity, but in real plane, two lines with different slopes intersect at exactly one point.Wait a second, this is getting confusing. Let&#39;s parse the problem again:&quot;If a line passing through the right focus F of the hyperbola with a slope of 1 intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point, find the eccentricity of the hyperbola.&quot;So, if the line passes through F with slope 1, and intersects one asymptote at exactly one point. But since asymptotes are straight lines, unless the line is parallel to the asymptote, it must intersect it at exactly one point. If it&#39;s parallel, it doesn&#39;t intersect. So the problem must mean that the line intersects one asymptote at exactly one point (which would always be the case if they are not parallel) and the other asymptote not at all (i.e., parallel). Wait, but the line can&#39;t be parallel to both asymptotes unless it&#39;s horizontal or vertical, but the slope is 1. The asymptotes have slopes ±b/a. So, if the line with slope 1 is parallel to one of the asymptotes, then 1 = b/a or 1 = -b/a. But since a and b are positive, 1 = b/a. Therefore, if b/a =1, then one asymptote is y = x, the other is y = -x. Then the line with slope 1 passing through focus (c,0) is y = x - c. If b/a =1, then the asymptote is y =x. So the line y = x - c and asymptote y = x are parallel if c=0, but c is sqrt(a² +b²), which can&#39;t be zero. Wait, but if b/a =1, then the asymptotes are y=±x. The line in question is y =x - c. This line is not parallel to the asymptote y =x, unless c=0, which it isn&#39;t. Therefore, if b/a=1, then the line y=x - c and the asymptote y=x are not parallel, so they intersect at one point. The other asymptote is y = -x, which is not parallel to the line either, so the line will intersect both asymptotes. So in this case, the line intersects both asymptotes. Therefore, that&#39;s not the case where it intersects only one asymptote. Therefore, perhaps the problem is not about being parallel, but something else.Wait, maybe the line is tangent to the hyperbola, and this tangent line also intersects the asymptote at exactly one point. But tangency to the hyperbola would mean that the line touches the hyperbola at exactly one point. Then, since asymptotes are not part of the hyperbola, the line would intersect the asymptote at another point. But the problem states &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. So maybe the tangent line is such that when it touches the hyperbola, it also only intersects the asymptote once? Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the line passes through the focus, has slope 1, and is tangent to an asymptote? But asymptotes are lines, so the line can only be tangent to an asymptote if they coincide, which would mean infinite intersections. Hmm.Wait, perhaps the problem is in Chinese, and the translation might be slightly off. The original problem says &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;. Maybe it&#39;s supposed to say &quot;intersects the hyperbola at exactly one point&quot;, which would make it a tangent line. But the problem says &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes&quot;. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the line intersects the asymptote and the hyperbola at the same point, meaning that the point of intersection is shared between the hyperbola and the asymptote. But asymptotes don&#39;t intersect the hyperbola, so that point would be at infinity. Hmm.Wait, perhaps the line passes through the focus, has slope 1, and is such that when it intersects the asymptote, it does so at a single point, but due to some condition related to the hyperbola&#39;s properties. Wait, I need to approach this step by step.First, find the equation of the line: passing through F(c,0) with slope 1: y = x - c.Second, find the equations of the asymptotes: y = (b/a)x and y = -(b/a)x.Third, find where the line intersects each asymptote. Let&#39;s compute the intersection points.Intersection with y = (b/a)x:Set x - c = (b/a)xSo x - (b/a)x = cx(1 - b/a) = cx = c / (1 - b/a) = (a c) / (a - b)Similarly, y = (b/a)x = (b/a)*(a c)/(a - b) = (b c)/(a - b)Intersection with y = -(b/a)x:Set x - c = -(b/a)xx + (b/a)x = cx(1 + b/a) = cx = c / (1 + b/a) = (a c)/(a + b)y = -(b/a)x = -(b/a)*(a c)/(a + b) = - (b c)/(a + b)So the line intersects both asymptotes at two distinct points unless the denominators are zero, which would happen if 1 - b/a = 0 or 1 + b/a = 0. But since a and b are positive, 1 + b/a is never zero, and 1 - b/a = 0 would mean b = a. If b = a, then the first intersection point would be undefined (division by zero), which implies that the line is parallel to the asymptote y = (b/a)x = x. So if b = a, the asymptotes are y = x and y = -x. Then, the line y = x - c would be parallel to the asymptote y = x only if c =0, but c = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(2)a², which is not zero. Therefore, if b = a, the line is not parallel to the asymptote y = x, but in that case, the denominator 1 - b/a = 0, which would mean that when trying to compute the intersection, it&#39;s undefined, implying that the line is parallel. Wait, but if b = a, then the asymptote is y = x, and the line is y = x - c. These two lines are not parallel; they have the same slope, so they are parallel. Wait, yes, if b = a, then the asymptote is y = x, and the line is y = x - c. Since they have the same slope, they are parallel. Therefore, they do not intersect, which is why when we tried to compute the intersection, we got division by zero. So, if b = a, the line is parallel to one asymptote (y = x) and intersects the other asymptote (y = -x) at one point. Therefore, in that case, the line intersects one asymptote at exactly one point. Therefore, the condition of the problem is satisfied when b = a. Therefore, the eccentricity e = c/a. Since c = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(a² + a²) = sqrt(2a²) = a√2. Therefore, e = (a√2)/a = √2. Therefore, the eccentricity is √2.Wait, but let me check this again. If b = a, then the hyperbola is x²/a² - y²/a² = 1. The asymptotes are y = ±x. The line is y = x - c, where c = sqrt(a² + a²) = a√2. So the line is y = x - a√2. This line is parallel to the asymptote y = x, so they don&#39;t intersect, and intersects the other asymptote y = -x at some point. Solving y = x - a√2 and y = -x:x - a√2 = -x2x = a√2x = (a√2)/2 = a/√2Then y = -x = -a/√2So the line intersects the asymptote y = -x at (a/√2, -a/√2). Therefore, only one intersection point with the asymptotes. So the problem&#39;s condition is satisfied when b = a, leading to e = √2. Therefore, the answer is √2. But let me confirm with another approach to be sure.Alternative approach: The problem states that the line with slope 1 through focus F intersects one asymptote at exactly one point. Since a line and an asymptote are both straight lines, they can either intersect at one point (if they are not parallel) or not intersect at all (if they are parallel). Therefore, the statement &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot; would mean that the line is not parallel to that asymptote, hence intersects it once. However, since there are two asymptotes, the line could intersect both asymptotes at one point each. However, the problem says &quot;intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point&quot;, which might be emphasizing that it only intersects one asymptote, implying that it&#39;s parallel to the other. Therefore, for the line to intersect only one asymptote, it must be parallel to the other asymptote. Therefore, the slope of the line must be equal to the slope of one asymptote, making it parallel to that asymptote, hence not intersecting it, and intersecting the other asymptote once. Since the line has slope 1, this means that one of the asymptotes must have slope 1, hence b/a =1 =&gt; b =a. Therefore, the hyperbola has b =a, so c = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(2a²) = a√2, so e = c/a = √2. Therefore, the same result as before. Therefore, the eccentricity is √2.Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is √2.Final AnswerThe eccentricity of the hyperbola is boxed{sqrt{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the eccentricity of the hyperbola given by the equation (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1) with the condition that a line passing through the right focus (F) with a slope of 1 intersects one of the asymptotes at exactly one point, we start by noting the following:1. Equation of the Hyperbola and Asymptotes:   - The hyperbola is (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1).   - The asymptotes are (y = pm frac{b}{a}x).2. Focus Coordinates:   - The right focus (F) is at ((c, 0)) where (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}).3. Equation of the Line:   - The line passing through (F) with slope 1 is (y = x - c).4. Condition for Intersection:   - The line (y = x - c) must intersect one of the asymptotes at exactly one point. This implies the line must be parallel to one asymptote (thus not intersecting it) and intersect the other asymptote once.5. Slope Analysis:   - The slopes of the asymptotes are (pm frac{b}{a}).   - For the line (y = x - c) to be parallel to one asymptote, its slope (1) must equal (pm frac{b}{a}).6. Solving for (b/a):   - Since (a) and (b) are positive, we have (1 = frac{b}{a}) leading to (b = a).7. Eccentricity Calculation:   - With (b = a), the distance to the focus (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{2a^2} = asqrt{2}).   - The eccentricity (e = frac{c}{a} = sqrt{2}).Thus, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is (boxed{sqrt{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a016c3d6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a016c3d6><span class="icon" data-v-a016c3d6>🔑:</span>Since the line passing through the right focus of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0) has a slope of 1, it follows from the geometric properties of hyperbolas that this line should be parallel to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola, namely y = frac{b}{a}x.Thus, we have frac{b}{a} = 1.

The problem is asking for the value of a real number &#39;a&#39; such that the system of inequalities has a unique solution. The system is:1. ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 )2. ( x + y + a = 0 )And then we also need to find that unique solution. Hmm, so first, let me understand what these equations represent.The first inequality is a quadratic in x and y. Maybe it&#39;s a circle or something? Let me rewrite it. If I complete the square for the y terms:( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 )Let&#39;s take the y terms: ( y^2 - 2y ). Completing the square, we add and subtract (2/2)^2 = 1.So, ( y^2 - 2y + 1 - 1 = (y - 1)^2 - 1 )Therefore, substituting back into the inequality:( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - 1 leq 1 )Which simplifies to:( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 leq 2 )Okay, so that&#39;s a circle centered at (0, 1) with radius √2. The inequality includes all the points inside and on the circle.The second equation is a straight line: ( x + y + a = 0 ) or ( y = -x - a ). So, this is a line with slope -1 and y-intercept -a.Now, the problem says that the system has a unique solution. That should mean that the line is tangent to the circle. Because if the line intersects the circle at exactly one point, then there&#39;s only one solution. If it intersects at two points, there are two solutions, and if it doesn&#39;t intersect, there are no solutions. So, for a unique solution, the line must be tangent to the circle.Therefore, the key is to find the value of &#39;a&#39; such that the line ( y = -x - a ) is tangent to the circle ( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2 ).To find the condition for tangency, the distance from the center of the circle to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle.The formula for the distance from a point (h, k) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is ( frac{|Ah + Bk + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ).First, let&#39;s write the line in standard form. The given line is ( x + y + a = 0 ). So, A = 1, B = 1, C = a.The center of the circle is (0, 1). So, plug into the distance formula:Distance = ( frac{|1*0 + 1*1 + a|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|1 + a|}{sqrt{2}} )This distance should be equal to the radius of the circle, which is √2.So, set up the equation:( frac{|1 + a|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} )Multiply both sides by √2:( |1 + a| = 2 )So, the absolute value equation leads to two cases:1. ( 1 + a = 2 ) =&gt; a = 12. ( 1 + a = -2 ) =&gt; a = -3Wait, but hold on. The problem says &quot;the inequality system has a unique solution&quot;. The inequality is ( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 leq 2 ), so it&#39;s a closed disk. The line ( x + y + a = 0 ) being tangent to the circle would intersect the disk at exactly one point, which is the tangent point. However, depending on the position of the line, even if the line is tangent, maybe the tangent point is on the boundary. But since the inequality includes the boundary, then tangency would mean exactly one solution. So, yes, either a = 1 or a = -3. But we need to check if both these values of a result in the line being tangent and intersecting the disk at exactly one point.Wait, but maybe depending on the direction of the line, both could be valid. Let&#39;s check.If a = 1, then the line is ( x + y + 1 = 0 ) or ( y = -x - 1 ).If a = -3, then the line is ( x + y - 3 = 0 ) or ( y = -x + 3 ).We need to see if both these lines are tangent to the circle.But perhaps both are, but maybe one is above and one is below. Let&#39;s check.The circle is centered at (0,1) with radius √2 ≈ 1.414.For the line y = -x -1, when a=1. Let&#39;s see the y-intercept is -1, which is below the center (0,1). The distance from the center (0,1) to the line is √2, which equals the radius. So, the line is tangent at the bottom of the circle.Similarly, for the line y = -x + 3. The y-intercept is 3, which is above the center. The distance from the center (0,1) to the line is |1 + (-3)| / √2 = | -2 | / √2 = 2/√2 = √2, which is equal to the radius. So, this line is tangent at the top of the circle.But since the inequality is x² + (y -1)² ≤ 2, which is the disk, then both these tangent lines would touch the disk at exactly one point each. So, both a=1 and a=-3 would make the system have a unique solution? But the problem states &quot;the value of the real number a&quot;, implying a unique a. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, perhaps when a=1, the line y = -x -1 is tangent to the circle, so the intersection is exactly one point on the circle, which satisfies the inequality (since the inequality includes equality). Similarly for a=-3. Therefore, there are two possible values for a? But the problem says &quot;for what value of the real number a&quot;, which is singular. So perhaps the problem is in the wording? Maybe not. Let me check again.Wait, maybe there&#39;s something wrong here. Let me visualize the circle and the lines.The circle is centered at (0,1) with radius √2. The line y = -x - a. For a =1, the line is going through points like (0, -1), (-1, 0). Since the center is at (0,1), and radius √2 ≈ 1.414, so the line y = -x -1 is below the center. The distance from center to line is √2, which is equal to the radius, so the line is tangent at the bottom. Similarly, for a = -3, the line is y = -x +3, which is above the center. The distance is √2, tangent at the top.But does the inequality x² + (y -1)^2 ≤ 2 include all points inside the circle. So, if the line is tangent above, at the top, then the line y = -x +3 would intersect the disk at that tangent point. Similarly, the line y = -x -1 would intersect the disk at the bottom tangent point.But both would yield one solution. So, the system would have a unique solution in both cases. Therefore, there are two values of a. But the problem says &quot;the value of the real number a&quot;, in singular. Maybe the problem is misstated? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let me check the distance again. For the line x + y + a =0, the distance from (0,1):|0 +1 +a| / sqrt(1 +1) = |1 + a| / sqrt(2) = radius = sqrt(2). Therefore, |1 +a| = 2, so 1 +a = ±2 =&gt; a =1 or a= -3.So, two solutions. But the problem says &quot;the value&quot;, maybe expecting both? Or perhaps only one of them is valid?Wait, maybe when a = -3, the line y = -x +3. Let&#39;s see, does this line really touch the circle? Let&#39;s substitute y = -x +3 into the circle equation:x² + ( (-x +3) -1 )² = 2x² + (-x +2)^2 = 2x² + x² -4x +4 = 22x² -4x +4 -2 =02x² -4x +2=0Divide by 2: x² -2x +1=0 =&gt; (x-1)^2=0, so x=1. Then y = -1 +3=2. So, the point is (1,2). That is on the circle, and substituting into the inequality, it&#39;s equal, so it&#39;s a solution. So, that&#39;s one solution.Similarly, for a=1: line y= -x -1. Substitute into the circle:x² + ( (-x -1) -1 )² = 2x² + (-x -2)^2 = 2x² + x² +4x +4=22x² +4x +4 -2=02x² +4x +2=0Divide by 2: x² +2x +1=0 =&gt; (x+1)^2=0 =&gt; x=-1. Then y = -(-1) -1=1 -1=0. So, the point is (-1,0). Which is on the circle. So, substituting into the inequality, it&#39;s equal, so that&#39;s a solution.Therefore, both a=1 and a=-3 give a unique solution. However, the problem says &quot;the value of the real number a&quot;, singular. So maybe there&#39;s a mistake here, but according to the math, there are two possible values. But let me check the problem again.The problem says: &quot;For what value of the real number a does the inequality system ... have a unique solution, and find this solution.&quot;Hmm, the wording is in singular, but according to the calculation, there are two such a&#39;s. Maybe the problem is expecting both? But in Chinese problems sometimes even if there are two solutions, the question is phrased in singular. Wait, let me check again.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the calculation? Let me check.We started with the inequality x² + (y -1)^2 ≤ 2. The line x + y + a =0. The system has a unique solution, which would mean that the line is tangent to the circle (so one point on the circle) and that this is the only point in the intersection. Since the inequality includes the interior of the circle, if the line passes through the interior, then there would be infinitely many solutions. Therefore, the line must touch the circle at exactly one point and not pass through any other points of the disk. So, if the line is tangent to the circle, then it touches the circle at one point, and since it&#39;s tangent, it doesn&#39;t enter the disk, hence that single point is the only solution. Therefore, the two values a=1 and a=-3 would correspond to the two tangent lines, one above and one below, both touching the circle at one point each. Therefore, both are valid.But why does the problem say &quot;the value&quot;? Maybe there&#39;s a translation issue, or maybe the problem is from a source where it&#39;s known that there are two solutions. Wait, perhaps when the user input the problem, he wrote &quot;the value&quot;, but actually in Chinese, maybe it&#39;s different. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the system.Wait, the system is:1. x² + y² -2y ≤12. x + y +a =0Wait, the second equation is an equation, not an inequality. So, the system is looking for points (x, y) that satisfy both the inequality and the equation. So, the solution set is the intersection of the line x + y +a =0 and the closed disk x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2. So, when is the intersection a single point? That is, when the line is tangent to the circle. Because if the line is tangent, it touches the circle at exactly one point, and since the disk includes the boundary, that point is the only solution. If the line is secant (cuts through the circle), then there are two points, which would both satisfy the system (since the line is in the equation, so those two points are solutions). If the line doesn&#39;t intersect the circle, then no solutions. Therefore, for the system to have exactly one solution, the line must be tangent. Hence, two possible a&#39;s, as we found.But the problem is phrased as &quot;the value of a&quot;, but the answer is two values. Maybe the original problem in Chinese might have a different phrasing, but according to the translation, maybe it&#39;s an oversight. However, since the user presented the problem in English as is, perhaps we need to answer both values? But I need to check.Wait, let me think. Maybe due to the inequality being ≤1 instead of ≤2? Wait, original inequality was x² + y² -2y ≤1. Then we converted it to x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2. Let me check again.Original inequality:x² + y² -2y ≤1Complete the square for y:y² -2y = (y -1)^2 -1Thus,x² + (y -1)^2 -1 ≤1Which gives:x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2Yes, correct. So the disk has radius √2, center at (0,1).Therefore, the two tangent lines at distance √2 from center (0,1) are the ones with a=1 and a=-3.So, unless there&#39;s an error in this reasoning, the answer should be two values. But the problem says &quot;the value&quot;, which is confusing. Maybe the user made a typo, or maybe it&#39;s supposed to be a system with equations, but the first is an inequality. Wait, the system is:1. x² + y² -2y ≤12. x + y +a =0So, the solutions are points on the line x + y +a =0 that are inside or on the circle. For there to be a unique solution, the line must intersect the disk at exactly one point. That occurs when the line is tangent to the circle. So, yes, two possible a&#39;s. So, maybe the problem is incorrect, or maybe I need to consider something else.Alternatively, maybe when substituting the line into the inequality, the quadratic equation has a unique solution. Let&#39;s check that approach.Substitute y = -x -a into the inequality x² + y² -2y ≤1.Compute x² + (-x -a)^2 -2(-x -a) ≤1.Expand:x² + (x² + 2ax + a²) + 2x + 2a ≤1Combine terms:x² + x² + 2ax + a² + 2x + 2a ≤12x² + (2a + 2)x + (a² + 2a) ≤1Subtract 1:2x² + (2a + 2)x + (a² + 2a -1) ≤0So, this is a quadratic inequality in x. For the quadratic to be ≤0 for exactly one value of x, the quadratic must touch the x-axis at exactly one point (i.e., discriminant zero) and the coefficient of x² is positive, so the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the inequality 2x² + (2a + 2)x + (a² + 2a -1) ≤0 is satisfied only at the vertex when the discriminant is zero.So, discriminant D = (2a + 2)^2 - 4*2*(a² + 2a -1)Compute D:= 4a² + 8a +4 - 8(a² + 2a -1)= 4a² +8a +4 -8a² -16a +8= (4a² -8a²) + (8a -16a) + (4 +8)= (-4a²) + (-8a) +12Set discriminant to zero:-4a² -8a +12 =0Multiply both sides by -1:4a² +8a -12=0Divide by 4:a² +2a -3=0Solving:a = [-2 ±√(4 +12)]/2 = [-2 ±√16]/2 = [-2 ±4]/2Thus:a = (-2 +4)/2=2/2=1a = (-2 -4)/2= -6/2=-3So, same result: a=1 and a=-3. Therefore, these are the two values for which the quadratic in x has exactly one solution (double root), and since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient 2&gt;0), the inequality is satisfied only at that point. Therefore, these are the two values.Therefore, the answer should be a=1 and a=-3, with corresponding solutions (-1,0) and (1,2).But the problem says &quot;the value of the real number a&quot; and &quot;find this solution&quot;, again in singular. So, maybe the problem expects both? Or maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation here.Wait, but let&#39;s check when a=1, the solution is x=-1, y=0. Let me verify that in the original inequality:x² + y² -2y = (-1)^2 +0^2 -2*0 =1 +0 -0=1 ≤1. So, equality holds. And x + y +a = -1 +0 +1=0. Correct.Similarly, when a=-3, solution is x=1, y=2.Check in original inequality:x² + y² -2y =1 +4 -4=1 ≤1. Equality holds. And x + y +a=1 +2 +(-3)=0. Correct.So both are valid. Therefore, the problem must have two solutions. But the way the problem is phrased seems to expect a single answer, so maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps in the translation. However, given the mathematics, there are two values of a and two solutions.But let me check once again if there could be another reason for uniqueness. Suppose the line is not tangent, but passes through the center? Then, it would intersect the disk at infinitely many points. No. If the line is vertical or horizontal? No, the line has slope -1. Wait, unless there&#39;s another condition where even if the line is secant, but the inequality only includes one point. But since the inequality is ≤1, after substitution, maybe in some cases the quadratic in x is satisfied for one x only. But as shown earlier, unless discriminant is zero, quadratic would have two solutions. Therefore, the only way is discriminant zero, leading to two a&#39;s.Hence, I think the answer is that a can be 1 or -3, with corresponding solutions (-1,0) and (1,2). However, since the problem says &quot;the value&quot; and &quot;this solution&quot;, perhaps it&#39;s expecting both? Or maybe the user needs to specify both.But since the original problem is translated, maybe the correct answer is a=3? Wait no, the solutions were a=1 and a=-3.Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the problem, and the inequality is x² + y² -2y ≤0, which would be a circle with radius 1. But according to the problem, it&#39;s ≤1.Wait, original inequality is x² + y² -2y ≤1. We transformed it to x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2. If it had been x² + (y -1)^2 ≤1, then the radius would be 1, but in our case, it&#39;s radius √2.Therefore, unless there&#39;s a different interpretation, I think the answer is two values. However, since the problem states &quot;the value&quot;, which is singular, there might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I need to confirm if both solutions are valid.Wait, maybe when a=-3, the line y = -x +3 is tangent at (1,2). Let&#39;s check if that point is in the original inequality:x² + y² -2y =1 +4 -4=1 ≤1. So, equality holds. So, yes, valid.Similarly, when a=1, the line y=-x -1 is tangent at (-1,0):x² + y² -2y=1 +0 -0=1 ≤1. Also equality.Therefore, both are correct.Therefore, I think the problem might have a typo, but according to the math, there are two solutions. Therefore, the answer should be a=1 and a=-3 with solutions (-1,0) and (1,2).But given the problem&#39;s phrasing, maybe the user expects only one answer. Let me check the equations again.Wait, original equations:1. ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 )2. ( x + y + a =0 )So, substituting the line into the inequality gives a quadratic in x. For the quadratic to have exactly one solution, discriminant zero, leading to two a&#39;s. Therefore, the answer is two a&#39;s. Since the problem might have an error, but according to strict mathematics, there are two possible a&#39;s. Therefore, the answer is a=1 and a=-3, with solutions (-1,0) and (1,2).However, the problem says &quot;have a unique solution&quot;, so maybe in Chinese, the problem might have considered both cases, but the user inputted it as singular. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer in a specific format. Since the problem asks for &quot;the value of the real number a&quot; and &quot;find this solution&quot;, and if we need to answer according to the system&#39;s requirement, perhaps write both values and solutions.But given the instructions here, the user might expect the answer in boxed notation. Since the problem might expect two answers, but if the original problem is translated with &quot;the value&quot;, maybe the answer is only one? But according to our analysis, two.Wait, let me check the distance from the center to the line again. The radius is √2, the distance is |1 + a| / √2 = √2 =&gt; |1 +a|=2, so a=1 or a=-3.Therefore, there are two real numbers. Therefore, the correct answer is a=1 and a=-3, each with their own unique solution. So, writing the answer as two possible pairs.But since the problem says &quot;the value&quot; and &quot;this solution&quot;, perhaps it&#39;s a mistake. Given that, but to adhere to the problem&#39;s phrasing, maybe I should present both.Alternatively, maybe the user intended the equation to be an inequality? Let&#39;s check.Wait, the system is:1. ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 )2. ( x + y + a =0 )If the second equation was an inequality, like ( x + y + a leq 0 ), then it would be different. But as it stands, it&#39;s an equation, so the solutions are the intersection points of the line and the disk. Therefore, for unique solution, the line must be tangent. Hence, two values. So, I think the problem might have a typo, but given the information, the answer is two values. Therefore, I will present both.Final AnswerThe value of ( a ) is ( boxed{1} ) and the unique solution is ( boxed{(-1, 0)} ), or the value of ( a ) is ( boxed{-3} ) and the unique solution is ( boxed{(1, 2)} ).However, due to the problem&#39;s phrasing expecting a singular answer, it&#39;s possible that only ( a = 1 ) is intended. But based on the mathematical reasoning, both values are correct. To ensure completeness, both answers are provided.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the value of the real number ( a ) for which the inequality system [left{begin{array}{l}x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1, x + y + a = 0end{array}right.]has a unique solution, we start by analyzing the given inequalities and equations.1. The first inequality ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 ) can be rewritten by completing the square for the ( y )-terms:   [   x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - 1 leq 1 implies x^2 + (y - 1)^2 leq 2.   ]   This represents a circle centered at ( (0, 1) ) with radius ( sqrt{2} ).2. The second equation ( x + y + a = 0 ) is a straight line. For the system to have a unique solution, this line must be tangent to the circle. The distance from the center of the circle ( (0, 1) ) to the line ( x + y + a = 0 ) must equal the radius ( sqrt{2} ).The distance from a point ( (h, k) ) to the line ( Ax + By + C = 0 ) is given by:[frac{|Ah + Bk + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}.]Substituting ( A = 1 ), ( B = 1 ), ( C = a ), ( h = 0 ), and ( k = 1 ):[frac{|0 + 1 + a|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|1 + a|}{sqrt{2}}.]Setting this equal to the radius ( sqrt{2} ):[frac{|1 + a|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} implies |1 + a| = 2.]This gives two solutions:[1 + a = 2 implies a = 1 quad text{or} quad 1 + a = -2 implies a = -3.]For ( a = 1 ), the line ( x + y + 1 = 0 ) intersects the circle at ( (-1, 0) ). For ( a = -3 ), the line ( x + y - 3 = 0 ) intersects the circle at ( (1, 2) ).Both solutions satisfy the original inequality and equation. Therefore, the values of ( a ) are ( 1 ) and ( -3 ), with corresponding unique solutions ( (-1, 0) ) and ( (1, 2) ).[boxed{1} text{ and the unique solution is } boxed{(-1, 0)}, text{ or } boxed{-3} text{ and the unique solution is } boxed{(1, 2)}.],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of the real number &#39;a&#39; for which the system of inequalities has a unique solution. The system is:1. ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 )2. ( x + y + a = 0 )Hmm, let me start by understanding each part of the problem. The first inequality is a quadratic in x and y, which probably represents a circle or some conic section. The second equation is a linear equation, so it&#39;s a straight line. The problem says that these two should have a unique solution, meaning the line is tangent to the circle represented by the first inequality. Because if there&#39;s only one solution, the line just touches the circle at one point.First, let me rewrite the first inequality in standard form to see what kind of shape it is. The equation is ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 ). Let&#39;s complete the square for the y terms.Starting with ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 ):The y terms are ( y^2 - 2y ). Completing the square:( y^2 - 2y = (y - 1)^2 - 1 ).So substituting back into the inequality:( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - 1 leq 1 )Adding 1 to both sides:( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 leq 2 )Ah, okay, so this is a circle centered at (0, 1) with radius √2. The inequality includes all points inside and on the circle.The second equation is the line ( x + y + a = 0 ), which can be rewritten as ( y = -x - a ).So now, we need to find the value of &#39;a&#39; such that the line ( y = -x - a ) is tangent to the circle ( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2 ). Because if it&#39;s tangent, there will be exactly one point of intersection, which gives the unique solution.To find when a line is tangent to a circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line should be equal to the radius of the circle.The formula for the distance from a point (h, k) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is:( text{Distance} = frac{|Ah + Bk + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} )Our line is ( x + y + a = 0 ). Comparing with Ax + By + C = 0, we have A = 1, B = 1, C = a.The center of the circle is (0, 1), so h = 0, k = 1.The radius of the circle is √2, and we want the distance from the center to the line to be equal to √2.So plugging into the distance formula:( frac{|1*0 + 1*1 + a|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = sqrt{2} )Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: |0 + 1 + a| = |a + 1|Denominator: √(1 + 1) = √2So equation becomes:( frac{|a + 1|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} )Multiply both sides by √2:( |a + 1| = 2 )This equation gives two solutions:1. ( a + 1 = 2 ) =&gt; ( a = 1 )2. ( a + 1 = -2 ) =&gt; ( a = -3 )Wait, so there are two possible values for a? But the problem says &quot;for what value of the real number a&quot;, implying there is only one. Hmm, maybe I need to check which of these actually results in a unique solution.Wait, but tangents from a point outside a circle can have two different tangent lines. But here, the line is x + y + a = 0. Depending on the direction, maybe both a=1 and a=-3 are valid. But let me check.Wait, the problem is asking for the value of a such that the system has a unique solution. Since the inequality is ≤ 1, which includes the interior of the circle as well. But if the line is tangent, it will touch the circle at exactly one point, and since the inequality includes the circle itself, that point will satisfy both equations. However, if the line intersects the circle at two points, then those two points would satisfy the system, but since the problem wants a unique solution, we need only the tangent case. So there should be two possible values of a? But the problem states &quot;the value of the real number a&quot;, which is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, let&#39;s check again. The original inequality is x² + y² - 2y ≤ 1, which as we converted is x² + (y - 1)^2 ≤ 2. So it&#39;s a closed disk centered at (0,1) with radius √2. The line x + y + a = 0. For the system to have a unique solution, the line must be tangent to the disk, which occurs when the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius. Therefore, we found |a + 1| = 2, so a = 1 or a = -3. Therefore, there are two possible values for a. However, the problem says &quot;the value of the real number a&quot;, which is singular. So maybe there&#39;s a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, perhaps the line has to be tangent, but depending on the direction, one of the solutions might result in the line intersecting the disk at only one point, but the other solution might not. Wait, but the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius, so the line is tangent to the circle. Therefore, in both cases, the line is tangent, so both a=1 and a=-3 would give exactly one solution. But why does the problem say &quot;the value&quot;? Maybe there&#39;s an error in my calculation.Wait, let me check again.Given the circle equation x² + (y - 1)^2 = 2, radius √2, center (0,1).The line is x + y + a = 0, which is same as y = -x - a.Distance from center (0,1) to the line x + y + a = 0 is |0 + 1 + a| / sqrt(1 + 1) = |a + 1| / sqrt(2). Set equal to radius sqrt(2):|a + 1| / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) =&gt; |a +1| = 2 =&gt; a +1 = ±2 =&gt; a = 1 or a = -3.So two solutions. But the problem states &quot;the value of a&quot;, which is singular. Hmm.Wait, perhaps in Chinese, maybe the problem is translated as &quot;for what value of a...&quot;, but actually, in Chinese, sometimes even if plural, they might use singular. But in English, the user wrote &quot;the value&quot;, so maybe there&#39;s only one. Maybe I need to check which of these a=1 or a=-3 gives a unique solution.Wait, maybe when a=1, the line is x + y + 1 = 0, which is y = -x -1. Let&#39;s see if this is tangent to the circle.Similarly, when a=-3, the line is x + y -3 = 0, which is y = -x + 3. Let&#39;s check if both of these lines are tangent.Wait, but maybe the inequality is x² + y² - 2y ≤1, which is the closed disk. If the line is tangent to the circle, then the system would have exactly one solution, which is the point of tangency. However, if the line is outside the circle, then there would be no solution, and if it&#39;s intersecting, two solutions. So when the line is tangent, there is exactly one solution. So both a=1 and a=-3 would give one solution each. But why does the problem say &quot;the value&quot;? Maybe the original problem has a typo, or I made a mistake.Wait, let me verify with substitution.Suppose a=1: The line is x + y +1=0 =&gt; y = -x -1.Substitute into the circle equation:x² + (y -1)^2 = 2=&gt; x² + (-x -1 -1)^2 = 2=&gt; x² + (-x -2)^2 = 2=&gt; x² + x² +4x +4 = 2=&gt; 2x² +4x +4 -2 =0=&gt; 2x² +4x +2 =0Divide by 2: x² +2x +1=0 =&gt; (x+1)^2=0 =&gt; x=-1, then y = -(-1) -1=1 -1=0.So the point (-1, 0) is the solution. Since the discriminant is zero, only one solution. So a=1 gives unique solution (-1,0).Similarly, for a=-3: The line is x + y -3=0 =&gt; y = -x +3.Substitute into the circle equation:x² + (-x +3 -1)^2 = 2=&gt; x² + (-x +2)^2 =2=&gt; x² + x² -4x +4 =2=&gt; 2x² -4x +4 -2=0=&gt; 2x² -4x +2=0Divide by 2: x² -2x +1=0 =&gt; (x -1)^2=0 =&gt; x=1, then y = -1 +3=2.So the point (1,2). Again, discriminant zero, unique solution.So both a=1 and a=-3 give unique solutions. But the problem states &quot;the value of a&quot;, so maybe the problem is expecting both values? But the user wrote &quot;the value&quot; in singular. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I misread the problem.Wait, looking back at the problem: it says &quot;the inequality system&quot; which includes the first inequality and the equation x + y + a =0. So the solution must satisfy both the inequality and the equation.But when we substitute the line into the inequality, we get the equation of the circle. But actually, the inequality is x² + y² -2y ≤1, which is the same as x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2. So the solutions are points on the line x + y +a=0 that lie inside or on the circle.However, if the line is tangent to the circle, then there&#39;s exactly one point of intersection, which is on the circle, so it satisfies the inequality (since the inequality includes the boundary). Therefore, the unique solution is the tangent point.But as we saw, there are two possible a&#39;s for which the line is tangent. Therefore, there are two values of a. But the problem asks &quot;for what value of the real number a&quot;. Hmm.Wait, maybe the problem is translated from Chinese, and in Chinese, sometimes they might use singular even when plural is intended, but perhaps the user made a typo, or maybe I need to check again.Alternatively, maybe one of the lines when substituted into the inequality actually only has one solution, whereas the other might have the line passing through the circle but intersecting at one point. But no, if the line is tangent, it only intersects at one point, which is on the circle. So both a=1 and a=-3 should work.Wait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;the inequality system&quot; has a unique solution. The system is:1. x² + y² -2y ≤12. x + y +a=0So the solutions are the points (x,y) that lie on the line x + y +a=0 and also lie inside or on the circle x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2.If the line is tangent to the circle, then there is exactly one such point: the point of tangency. If the line intersects the circle at two points, then those two points would be solutions. If the line is outside the circle, no solutions. Therefore, the system will have exactly one solution only when the line is tangent to the circle, which gives two values of a. But since the problem says &quot;the value&quot;, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, unless the line is not only tangent but also lies within the inequality. Wait, but the tangent point is on the circle, which is included in the inequality. So even if the line is tangent, the system will have that one point as the solution. If the line is outside, no solutions. If the line cuts through the circle, two solutions. So unique solution only when tangent. So two possible a&#39;s. But the problem says &quot;the value&quot;. Maybe the problem is misstated, or perhaps in the original problem, there&#39;s a condition that a is positive or something, but the user didn&#39;t mention. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when computing.Wait, let me check the substitution again.For a=1: The line is x + y +1=0. The solution is (-1, 0). Let&#39;s plug into the inequality:x² + y² -2y = (-1)^2 + 0^2 -2*0 =1 +0 -0=1 ≤1: True.For a=-3: The line is x + y -3=0. The solution is (1, 2). Check the inequality:x² + y² -2y =1^2 + 2^2 -2*2=1 +4 -4=1 ≤1: True.So both solutions are valid. Therefore, the answer should be a=1 and a=-3. But the problem says &quot;the value of a&quot;, so maybe the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s only one solution if considering other constraints. Wait, but how? The algebra shows two solutions.Wait, perhaps there is an error in completing the square. Let me check again.Original inequality: x² + y² -2y ≤1.Completing the square for y:y² -2y = (y -1)^2 -1.So x² + (y -1)^2 -1 ≤1.Adding 1 to both sides: x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2. Correct.So the circle is radius √2, center (0,1). Correct.The line x + y +a=0. Distance from center to line is |a +1| / sqrt(2) = radius √2. So |a +1| =2. Hence, a=1 or a=-3. Correct.Therefore, there are two values. But since the problem says &quot;the value&quot;, maybe the answer is both, but expressed as a set. However, in the problem statement, it&#39;s possible that there was a misstatement, or maybe I need to check again.Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the equation is x + y + a ≤0 or something else, but according to the given problem, it&#39;s x + y +a=0.Alternatively, maybe there is a unique solution when considering the entire system. Wait, no. If a line is tangent to the circle, the system (inequality and equation) will have exactly one solution. If the line is inside the circle, then there are infinitely many solutions, right? Because the line would intersect the circle in two points, but all the points on the line between those two intersections would satisfy the inequality. Wait, no. Wait, the inequality is x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2, which is the disk. The line x + y +a=0. If the line passes through the disk, then all points on the line that lie within the disk are solutions. So, if the line cuts through the disk, the system has infinitely many solutions. If the line is tangent to the disk, then there is exactly one solution. If the line doesn&#39;t intersect the disk, then there are no solutions. Therefore, the system has a unique solution only when the line is tangent to the disk, which gives a=1 and a=-3. Therefore, two values. But the problem says &quot;the value&quot;, which is confusing.Wait, maybe the problem is written in Chinese, and the original problem had a specific context where only one value is possible. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I need to check the problem again.Wait, the problem says: &quot;have a unique solution, and find this solution.&quot; If there are two different a&#39;s, each leading to a unique solution, then each a corresponds to a unique solution. Therefore, maybe the problem expects both answers. However, the way it&#39;s phrased is &quot;the value of the real number a&quot; and &quot;find this solution&quot;, which suggests a single answer. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem or in my solution.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a miscalculation in the distance formula. Let me check again.Center (0,1). Line x + y +a =0.Distance is |0 +1 +a| / sqrt(1 +1) = |a +1| / sqrt(2).Set equal to radius sqrt(2): |a +1| / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) =&gt; |a +1| = 2. Hence, a=1 or a=-3.Correct. So two values.Alternatively, maybe the problem meant &quot;the solution&quot; as in the pair (a, solution). But no, the problem says &quot;have a unique solution, and find this solution&quot;. So if a=1, the solution is (-1,0); if a=-3, it&#39;s (1,2). Therefore, two different solutions. But the problem says &quot;this solution&quot;, singular. Therefore, something&#39;s wrong.Wait, maybe I misunderstood the system. The system is:1. x² + y² -2y ≤12. x + y + a =0It&#39;s the intersection of the line x + y +a=0 and the closed disk x² + (y -1)^2 ≤2. The system has a unique solution only when the line is tangent to the disk. Therefore, two values of a. But the problem says &quot;the value of a&quot; and &quot;this solution&quot;. Therefore, perhaps the problem is ill-posed.Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the inequality is actually an equality? If so, then the system would be:1. x² + y² -2y =12. x + y + a =0Which would represent the intersection of a line and a circle. Then, the system would have a unique solution only when the line is tangent to the circle, which gives the same a=1 and a=-3. But again, two values.But given the original problem has the inequality, maybe the user intended it as equality, but wrote inequality. Alternatively, maybe not.Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find a such that the inequality system has exactly one solution. So, the solutions are all points on the line that lie inside or on the circle. If the line is outside the disk, no solutions. If the line is tangent, one solution. If the line intersects the disk, infinitely many solutions. Wait, hold on. Wait, if the line passes through the disk, then the set of solutions is all the points on the line that are within the disk, which would be a line segment, hence infinitely many points. Therefore, the system would have infinitely many solutions. But if the line is tangent, then only one point. If the line doesn&#39;t intersect, no solutions. Therefore, the only case when the system has a unique solution is when the line is tangent to the disk, which gives a=1 and a=-3. Therefore, two values. But the problem says &quot;the value&quot;. So perhaps the answer is both a=1 and a=-3, with their respective solutions. But the problem says &quot;the value... and find this solution&quot;. Which suggests that maybe there&#39;s a unique a and a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is probably mistyped.Alternatively, perhaps I need to check again the calculation.Wait, let&#39;s consider that if the line is tangent to the circle, the system has exactly one solution. But if the line is tangent but lies entirely inside the disk, then there would be infinitely many solutions. Wait, but if the line is tangent to the circle, it touches the circle at exactly one point, and since the disk includes all points inside, the line would pass through the disk, but only tangent at that one point. Wait, no. If a line is tangent to a circle, it touches the circle at exactly one point and does not enter the circle. Therefore, the set of solutions would be only that single point where the line touches the circle, because all other points on the line are outside the circle. Wait, is that correct?Wait, if the line is tangent to the circle, then the line touches the circle at exactly one point, but the rest of the line is outside the circle. Therefore, the only solution is the point of tangency. Therefore, in that case, the system would have exactly one solution. However, if the line cuts through the circle, then the solutions are all the points on the line that are inside the circle, which is a line segment, hence infinitely many solutions. If the line is entirely outside the circle, no solutions. Therefore, unique solution occurs only when the line is tangent to the circle, which gives two values of a. Therefore, the answer must be two values of a, each corresponding to a unique solution. But the problem states &quot;the value&quot;, which is conflicting.Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the inequality is actually x² + y² -2y ≥1, which would be the exterior of the circle. In that case, if the line is tangent, the system would have one solution. But since it&#39;s an inequality, the line could intersect the exterior in multiple points, but tangency would still be one. However, given the original problem is written as ≤1, it&#39;s an internal disk.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation in the distance from the center to the line. Let me check again.Given the line x + y + a =0, and center at (0,1). Then:Distance = |0 +1 +a| / sqrt(1 +1) = |a +1| / sqrt(2). Setting equal to radius sqrt(2):|a +1| / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) =&gt; |a +1| = 2, so a=1 or a=-3. Correct.Therefore, unless there&#39;s a restriction on a, the problem likely has two solutions. Since the problem asks for &quot;the value&quot;, maybe the answer is both a=1 and a=-3, each with their respective solutions. But the problem says &quot;this solution&quot;, implying singular. Maybe the user wants both solutions presented. But in the original problem statement in Chinese, maybe it&#39;s clearer. Since we need to follow the user&#39;s instruction, which says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, likely expecting one value. But we have two. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem.Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the equation is x + y + a ≤0, but no, the original problem says x + y +a=0. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the inequality. Let me check again.The first inequality is x² + y² -2y ≤1. Converting to standard form:x² + (y -1)^2 ≤ 2. Correct.So, given that, the problem is as before.Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find a such that the system has a unique solution (x,y). But if a=1, solution is (-1,0); if a=-3, solution is (1,2). So two different a&#39;s, each leading to a unique solution. Therefore, the answer should be a=1 and a=-3, with their respective solutions. But the problem says &quot;the value of the real number a&quot; and &quot;find this solution&quot;. Maybe the problem is in Chinese and there&#39;s a translation issue. Since the user hasn&#39;t specified, but according to the mathematical reasoning, there are two solutions. However, since the problem says &quot;the value&quot;, maybe the answer is a=1 and solution (-1,0), but why? Maybe my initial reasoning is wrong.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe substituting the line into the inequality and finding when the quadratic equation has exactly one solution.Given the line x + y +a=0, so y = -x -a. Substitute into the inequality:x² + (-x -a)^2 -2(-x -a) ≤1.Expand:x² + x² + 2ax + a² + 2x + 2a ≤1.Combine like terms:2x² + (2a + 2)x + (a² + 2a) ≤1.Subtract 1:2x² + (2a + 2)x + (a² + 2a -1) ≤0.This is a quadratic inequality in x. For this inequality to have a unique solution, the quadratic must be equal to zero at exactly one point, and the quadratic must open upwards (coefficient of x² is positive, which it is, 2&gt;0). Therefore, the quadratic equation 2x² + (2a + 2)x + (a² + 2a -1)=0 must have exactly one real root, and the inequality would then be satisfied only at that root. Therefore, discriminant must be zero.Compute discriminant D:D = (2a + 2)^2 - 4*2*(a² + 2a -1).Compute:D = 4a² +8a +4 -8a² -16a +8= (4a² -8a²) + (8a -16a) + (4 +8)= (-4a²) + (-8a) +12Set D=0:-4a² -8a +12=0Divide by -4:a² +2a -3=0Factor:(a +3)(a -1)=0 =&gt; a= -3 or a=1.So again, we get a=1 and a=-3. Therefore, this method also gives two values.Therefore, the answer must be that a can be either 1 or -3, with corresponding solutions (-1,0) and (1,2). However, the problem states &quot;the value&quot; and &quot;this solution&quot;, suggesting a single answer. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the problem, or maybe I need to check again.Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different inequality, such as x² + y² -2y ≥1, which would change things. But as given, it&#39;s ≤1.Alternatively, maybe there is a constraint on a being positive or negative, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify.Given that the problem is as stated, and according to the mathematics, there are two solutions. However, since the problem asks for &quot;the value&quot; and &quot;this solution&quot;, maybe I need to check if both solutions are valid.For a=1, the solution is (-1,0). For a=-3, the solution is (1,2). Both satisfy the original system.Check for a=1:1. (-1)^2 +0^2 -2*0 =1 ≤1: True.2. -1 +0 +1=0: True.For a=-3:1. 1^2 +2^2 -2*2=1 +4 -4=1 ≤1: True.2.1 +2 +(-3)=0: True.Both are valid.Therefore, the answer is two values of a: 1 and -3, with corresponding solutions (-1,0) and (1,2). However, since the problem asks for &quot;the value&quot; and &quot;this solution&quot;, which is singular, there might be an error. Alternatively, the problem might have a condition that a is positive or something, but the user didn&#39;t mention.But given the problem as stated, the correct answer should be a=1 and a=-3, each corresponding to their solutions. Since the user might expect both, but due to translation or formatting issues, they wrote &quot;the value&quot;, but in mathematics, we need to present both.However, in the Chinese curriculum, sometimes problems like this might have two solutions, and the answer requires both. So maybe the answer is a=1 and solution (-1,0), and a=-3 and solution (1,2). But the problem says &quot;the value of a&quot; and &quot;find this solution&quot;. So unless there&#39;s a specific context, both are valid.Alternatively, perhaps I need to check for a in real numbers, and the system has a unique solution when a=1 and a=-3. Therefore, writing both as answers.But the user instruction says: &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. Usually, boxed{} is used for single answers. If there are two answers, they might need to be boxed separately. But maybe in the original problem, due to translation, the answer is two values. But since the user instruction says &quot;the value&quot;, it&#39;s conflicting.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation. Let&#39;s see:If a=1, line is x + y +1=0, tangent at (-1,0).If a=-3, line is x + y -3=0, tangent at (1,2).Both correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find a so that the equation x + y +a=0 and the inequality x² + y² -2y ≤1 have exactly one solution. As we reasoned, this is when the line is tangent to the circle. Hence, two values. Therefore, the answer is a=1 and a=-3, with respective solutions. Since the problem says &quot;the solution&quot;, maybe both are required.However, since the user&#39;s problem says &quot;the value of the real number a&quot; and &quot;find this solution&quot;, and in Chinese sometimes questions might expect multiple answers, but the translation uses singular. Maybe the user expects both answers. However, given the final answer should be in boxed, perhaps:The values of a are boxed{1} and boxed{-3}, with corresponding solutions boxed{(-1, 0)} and boxed{(1, 2)}.But I need to confirm if that&#39;s acceptable. However, in many cases, such problems might have two solutions, and the answer should present both. However, the problem says &quot;have a unique solution&quot;, which for each a, there&#39;s a unique solution, so technically, each a corresponds to a unique solution. Therefore, the problem might have two answers. Therefore, I should present both.But since the user&#39;s instructions say &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, maybe they want both values of a and both solutions. But how to box them? Maybe:The value of a is boxed{1} and boxed{-3}, and the solutions are boxed{(-1, 0)} and boxed{(1, 2)}.But I need to follow the user&#39;s requirement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects one answer, and there is a mistake in my thinking.Alternatively, let&#39;s visualize.The circle is centered at (0,1), radius approx 1.414.The line x + y +a=0. When a=1, the line is y=-x-1, which passes through (-1,0) and (0,-1). The point (-1,0) is on the circle. When a=-3, the line is y=-x+3, passing through (1,2) and (0,3). The point (1,2) is on the circle. Both lines are tangent at those points. So two different tangent lines. Therefore, two different a&#39;s.Hence, the answer is two a&#39;s and two solutions. Therefore, the correct answer is a=1 and a=-3, with solutions (-1,0) and (1,2). Since the problem says &quot;the value&quot; and &quot;this solution&quot;, maybe it&#39;s a mistake. But given the mathematical reasoning, the answer is two values.However, since the user might expect a single answer, and the problem might have a typo, but in the absence of further information, I&#39;ll proceed to state both solutions.Final AnswerThe value of ( a ) is (boxed{1}) with the solution (boxed{(-1, 0)}) and (boxed{-3}) with the solution (boxed{(1, 2)}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of the real number (a) for which the system of inequalities has a unique solution, we start by analyzing the given system:1. ( x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 )2. ( x + y + a = 0 )First, we rewrite the first inequality in standard form by completing the square:[x^2 + y^2 - 2y leq 1 implies x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - 1 leq 1 implies x^2 + (y - 1)^2 leq 2]This represents a circle centered at ((0, 1)) with radius (sqrt{2}).The second equation is the line (x + y + a = 0). For this line to be tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle ((0, 1)) to the line must be equal to the radius (sqrt{2}).The distance from a point ((h, k)) to the line (Ax + By + C = 0) is given by:[frac{|Ah + Bk + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}]For the line (x + y + a = 0) (where (A = 1), (B = 1), (C = a)), the distance from ((0, 1)) to the line is:[frac{|0 + 1 + a|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|a + 1|}{sqrt{2}}]Setting this equal to the radius (sqrt{2}), we solve:[frac{|a + 1|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} implies |a + 1| = 2 implies a + 1 = 2 text{ or } a + 1 = -2 implies a = 1 text{ or } a = -3]Next, we find the unique solutions for each value of (a):1. For (a = 1), the line equation becomes (x + y + 1 = 0). Substituting (y = -x - 1) into the circle equation:[x^2 + (-x - 1 - 1)^2 = 2 implies x^2 + (-x - 2)^2 = 2 implies 2x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0 implies (x + 1)^2 = 0 implies x = -1]Substituting (x = -1) into (y = -x - 1) gives (y = 0). The solution is ((-1, 0)).2. For (a = -3), the line equation becomes (x + y - 3 = 0). Substituting (y = -x + 3) into the circle equation:[x^2 + (-x + 3 - 1)^2 = 2 implies x^2 + (-x + 2)^2 = 2 implies 2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0 implies (x - 1)^2 = 0 implies x = 1]Substituting (x = 1) into (y = -x + 3) gives (y = 2). The solution is ((1, 2)).Thus, the values of (a) are (boxed{1}) and (boxed{-3}) with corresponding solutions (boxed{(-1, 0)}) and (boxed{(1, 2)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a016c3d6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a016c3d6><span class="icon" data-v-a016c3d6>🔑:</span>(1) When a=1, there is a unique solution left{begin{array}{l}x=-1,  y=0 ;end{array}right.

So, we have a triangular prism ABC-A₁B₁C₁. The side length of the square AA₁C₁C is 4. Hmm, a square has all sides equal, so that means AA₁, A₁C₁, C₁C, and AC are all 4 units long. Wait, but the problem mentions the square AA₁C₁C, which is one of the lateral faces of the prism. So, that face is a square with side length 4. That tells me that the edges AA₁, AC, C₁C, and A₁C₁ are all 4 units. Also, since it&#39;s a square, the angle between AA₁ and AC must be 90 degrees. Then, the plane ABC is perpendicular to the plane AA₁C₁C. So, the base triangle ABC is perpendicular to the lateral face AA₁C₁C. That probably means that the triangle ABC is standing upright relative to the square face. Given AB = 3 and BC = 5. So, triangle ABC has sides AB = 3, BC = 5. Since ABC is a triangle, we can maybe use the Pythagorean theorem here? Let&#39;s check if triangle ABC is a right triangle. If AB = 3, BC = 5, then if AC is 4, it would be a right triangle because 3² + 4² = 5². Wait, but AC is part of the square AA₁C₁C, so AC is 4. So, triangle ABC must be a right triangle with right angle at A? Wait, but AC is 4, AB is 3, BC is 5. So, 3² + 4² = 5², so triangle ABC is right-angled at A. Wait, but hold on. If ABC is right-angled at A, then AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. But in the problem statement, they mention AB = 3 and BC = 5. If AB is 3 and BC is 5, then AC must be 4 to satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, which matches the square side length. So, that makes sense. So, triangle ABC is right-angled at A with AB = 3, AC = 4, BC = 5. But the problem states that the plane ABC is perpendicular to the plane AA₁C₁C. Since AA₁C₁C is a square, which is in the plane of AA₁C₁C. So, if ABC is perpendicular to that, then the line AC is the intersection of the two planes. Since ABC is perpendicular to AA₁C₁C, then the line AC must be the line where the two planes meet, and the dihedral angle between the two planes is 90 degrees. Therefore, the triangle ABC is perpendicular to the square AA₁C₁C along the edge AC. So, now we need to find a point D on BC₁ such that AD is perpendicular to A₁B. Then, we need to find the ratio BD/BC₁. First, let&#39;s sketch the prism. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points to make this easier. Since we have a right triangle ABC with right angle at A, and the square AA₁C₁C. Let&#39;s place point A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since AC is 4, and the square is AA₁C₁C, which is in the plane of AA₁C₁C. Since ABC is perpendicular to AA₁C₁C, then if AA₁ is along the z-axis, and AC is along the x-axis, then AB would be along the y-axis. Let me confirm:Let me set up a coordinate system. Let’s take point A at (0,0,0). Since AC is 4, and it&#39;s part of the square AA₁C₁C, which is in the x-z plane. So, point C would be at (4,0,0). Then, since AA₁ is also part of the square, which has side length 4, so point A₁ is at (0,0,4). Then, point C₁ is at (4,0,4). Now, the triangle ABC is in a plane perpendicular to the square AA₁C₁C. Since ABC is perpendicular to AA₁C₁C, which is the x-z plane. So, the plane ABC must be the x-y plane? Wait, but if ABC is in the x-y plane, then AB would be along the y-axis, and AC is along the x-axis. Then, point B would be at (0,3,0), since AB = 3. Then, point C is at (4,0,0). Then, BC is the distance from (0,3,0) to (4,0,0), which is sqrt((4-0)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5, which matches BC = 5. That works. So, coordinates:A = (0,0,0)B = (0,3,0)C = (4,0,0)A₁ = (0,0,4)C₁ = (4,0,4)Now, the prism is formed by translating the triangle ABC along the vector AA₁ to get the triangle A₁B₁C₁. But wait, actually, in a triangular prism, the triangles ABC and A₁B₁C₁ are congruent and connected by rectangles. However, in this case, since AA₁C₁C is a square, the translation is along the z-axis. But point B is connected to B₁, which would be at (0,3,4), right? Because if we move along the AA₁ vector (0,0,0) to (0,0,4), then similarly, B would move to (0,3,4). But the problem statement doesn&#39;t mention B₁, but maybe we need to figure it out.Wait, the problem is a triangular prism ABC-A₁B₁C₁. So, the vertices are ABC on the base and A₁B₁C₁ on the top, with edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁. Since AA₁C₁C is a square, AA₁ is vertical, and CC₁ is vertical. Since ABC is in the x-y plane, A₁B₁C₁ would be in the plane z = 4. So, coordinates:A₁ = (0,0,4)B₁ = (0,3,4)C₁ = (4,0,4)Therefore, the segment BC₁ connects point B (0,3,0) to point C₁ (4,0,4). So, parametrize BC₁. Let&#39;s parameterize BC₁ with a parameter t from 0 to 1. So, point D is on BC₁, so its coordinates can be written as:D = B + t*(C₁ - B) = (0,3,0) + t*(4 - 0, 0 - 3, 4 - 0) = (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t)So, D = (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t) for some t between 0 and 1. Then, BD is t*BC₁, so BD/BC₁ = t. Therefore, we need to find t such that AD is perpendicular to A₁B.First, let&#39;s find the coordinates of AD and A₁B.Point A is (0,0,0), so vector AD is D - A = (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t)Point A₁ is (0,0,4), point B is (0,3,0), so vector A₁B is B - A₁ = (0 - 0, 3 - 0, 0 - 4) = (0, 3, -4)We need vector AD to be perpendicular to vector A₁B. So, their dot product should be zero.Compute the dot product:AD • A₁B = (4t)(0) + (3 - 3t)(3) + (4t)(-4) = 0 + 9 - 9t - 16t = 9 - 25tSet this equal to zero:9 - 25t = 0Solving for t:25t = 9 =&gt; t = 9/25Therefore, BD/BC₁ = t = 9/25Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify.First, coordinates:A: (0,0,0)B: (0,3,0)C: (4,0,0)A₁: (0,0,4)C₁: (4,0,4)Vector BC₁: from B (0,3,0) to C₁ (4,0,4): (4, -3, 4)Parametric equation of BC₁: (0 + 4t, 3 - 3t, 0 + 4t), which is (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t). So D is (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t). Then vector AD is (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t). Vector A₁B is from A₁ (0,0,4) to B (0,3,0), which is (0 - 0, 3 - 0, 0 - 4) = (0, 3, -4). Then, the dot product of AD and A₁B is indeed 4t*0 + (3 - 3t)*3 + 4t*(-4) = 0 + 9 - 9t -16t = 9 -25t. Setting equal to zero gives t = 9/25. Therefore, BD is t times BC₁, so the ratio is 9/25. But let me check the length of BC₁. Coordinates of B (0,3,0) and C₁ (4,0,4). The distance is sqrt((4)^2 + (-3)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(16 + 9 + 16) = sqrt(41). So BC₁ is sqrt(41). But BD is t*sqrt(41), so BD/BC₁ = t = 9/25. Therefore, the answer should be 9/25. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn&#39;t make any mistakes in the coordinate setup. Let me confirm the perpendicularity of the planes. The plane ABC is the x-y plane, and the plane AA₁C₁C is the x-z plane. These two planes are indeed perpendicular, since the x-y plane and x-z plane are perpendicular. So that checks out. Also, the triangle ABC is right-angled at A, with AB = 3, AC = 4, BC = 5. So that&#39;s correct. Vector AD is from A(0,0,0) to D(4t, 3 - 3t, 4t). Vector A₁B is from A₁(0,0,4) to B(0,3,0), which is (0,3,-4). Dot product is (4t)(0) + (3 - 3t)(3) + (4t)(-4) = 9 -9t -16t = 9 -25t. Set to zero gives t = 9/25. Therefore, BD/BC₁ = 9/25. Seems correct.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{9}{25}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the triangular prism (ABC-A_1B_1C_1) with the side length of the square (AA_1C_1C) being 4, and the plane (ABC) perpendicular to the plane (AA_1C_1C). The coordinates of the vertices are set as follows:- (A = (0, 0, 0))- (B = (0, 3, 0))- (C = (4, 0, 0))- (A_1 = (0, 0, 4))- (C_1 = (4, 0, 4))The point (D) is on the line segment (BC_1). We parameterize (D) using a parameter (t) such that (D = (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t)) for (0 leq t leq 1).We need to find (t) such that (AD perp A_1B). The vector (AD) is ((4t, 3 - 3t, 4t)) and the vector (A_1B) is ((0, 3, -4)). The dot product of these vectors must be zero:[(4t) cdot 0 + (3 - 3t) cdot 3 + (4t) cdot (-4) = 0]Simplifying this equation:[9 - 9t - 16t = 0 implies 9 - 25t = 0 implies t = frac{9}{25}]Thus, the ratio (frac{BD}{BC_1}) is equal to (t), which is (frac{9}{25}).[boxed{dfrac{9}{25}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. So, we have a triangular prism ABC-A₁B₁C₁. The side length of the square AA₁C₁C is 4. Hmm, so AA₁C₁C is a square with side length 4. That means all edges of that square are 4 units long. So AA₁, A₁C₁, C₁C, and CA are all 4. Got it. Then it says the plane ABC is perpendicular to the plane AA₁C₁C. Since ABC is the base triangle and AA₁C₁C is a lateral face, which is a square, their being perpendicular makes sense in a prism. Given AB = 3 and BC = 5. So triangle ABC has sides AB=3, BC=5, and we can maybe find AC using the Pythagorean theorem if ABC is a right triangle? Wait, but we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a right triangle. Wait, but the problem says plane ABC is perpendicular to plane AA₁C₁C. Since AA₁C₁C is a square, which is in a plane, and ABC is perpendicular to that. So maybe triangle ABC is in a plane perpendicular to the square&#39;s plane. So their line of intersection would be the line AC, because both planes ABC and AA₁C₁C contain the line AC. So the dihedral angle between the two planes is 90 degrees, so they are perpendicular along AC.Therefore, triangle ABC is in a plane perpendicular to the square AA₁C₁C, which suggests that the height from B to AC is perpendicular to the square. Hmm, maybe.But AB=3, BC=5. So maybe triangle ABC is a triangle with AB=3, BC=5, and AC is some length. Wait, but if ABC is in a plane perpendicular to AA₁C₁C, which is a square with side 4. Since AC is part of both planes, and AA₁C₁C has AC=4 as a side of the square. Wait, hold on. Wait, the square AA₁C₁C has side length 4. So each edge of the square is 4. So AC is a side of the square, so AC=4. Therefore, in triangle ABC, AC=4, AB=3, BC=5. Wait, 3-4-5 triangle! That&#39;s a right triangle. So triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A? Because 3² + 4² = 5². 9 + 16 = 25. Yes, that works. So angle at A is the right angle. Therefore, AB is perpendicular to AC. But since the plane ABC is perpendicular to the plane AA₁C₁C, which is the square. So that makes sense because if in the base triangle ABC, AB is perpendicular to AC, and the square AA₁C₁C is built on AC, then the two planes are perpendicular.So now, in this triangular prism, we have to find a point D on BC₁ such that AD is perpendicular to A₁B. Then we need to find the ratio BD/BC₁.Alright, let&#39;s start by visualizing or setting up coordinates. Let&#39;s assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.Let’s place point A at the origin (0,0,0). Since AC is part of the square AA₁C₁C and AC=4, let&#39;s set point C at (4,0,0). Then, since AA₁ is also a side of the square, which is 4 units, point A₁ would be at (0,0,4). Similarly, point C₁ is at (4,0,4).Now, the plane ABC is perpendicular to the plane AA₁C₁C. The plane ABC contains points A(0,0,0), B, and C(4,0,0). Since ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A, point B must lie along the y-axis (since AB is perpendicular to AC, which is along the x-axis). So coordinates of B would be (0,3,0) because AB=3. Wait, but in 3D space, since plane ABC is perpendicular to plane AA₁C₁C, which is the x-z plane (since A is (0,0,0), C is (4,0,0), A₁ is (0,0,4), C₁ is (4,0,4)). So plane AA₁C₁C is the x-z plane. Then plane ABC must be perpendicular to the x-z plane, which would make it a vertical plane. But if ABC has points A(0,0,0), B(0,3,0), and C(4,0,0), then that plane is the x-y plane, which is actually not perpendicular to the x-z plane. Wait, the x-y plane and x-z plane are perpendicular? Wait, no, the x-y plane and y-z plane are perpendicular. The x-y plane has normal vector along the z-axis, and the x-z plane has normal vector along the y-axis. So their dihedral angle is 90 degrees? Wait, actually, the angle between two planes is determined by the angle between their normal vectors. The normal vector of the x-y plane is along the z-axis, and the normal vector of the x-z plane is along the y-axis. The angle between the z-axis and y-axis is 90 degrees, so yes, the two planes are perpendicular. So if ABC is in the x-y plane and AA₁C₁C is in the x-z plane, then they are indeed perpendicular. But in that case, point B is (0,3,0), point C is (4,0,0), so BC would be the distance from (0,3,0) to (4,0,0), which is sqrt((4)^2 + (-3)^2) = 5, which matches the given BC=5. Perfect.So coordinates:A: (0,0,0)B: (0,3,0)C: (4,0,0)A₁: (0,0,4)C₁: (4,0,4)Now, we need to find the coordinates of B₁. Since it&#39;s a triangular prism, the edges AA₁, BB₁, CC₁ are all parallel and equal. So since AA₁ is from (0,0,0) to (0,0,4), BB₁ should go from (0,3,0) to (0,3,4), and CC₁ is from (4,0,0) to (4,0,4). Therefore, B₁ is (0,3,4).Wait, but in the prism, the top face A₁B₁C₁ should be congruent to the base face ABC. So triangle A₁B₁C₁ should be congruent to triangle ABC. Let me verify.A₁ is (0,0,4), B₁ is (0,3,4), C₁ is (4,0,4). So the triangle A₁B₁C₁ has sides A₁B₁ = 3, B₁C₁ = sqrt((4-0)^2 + (0-3)^2 + (4-4)^2) = sqrt(16 +9) = 5, and A₁C₁ = 4. So yes, congruent to ABC. That checks out.So now, the line segment BC₁ connects point B(0,3,0) to C₁(4,0,4). We need to find point D on BC₁ such that AD is perpendicular to A₁B.First, let&#39;s parametrize the line segment BC₁. Let&#39;s let D divide BC₁ in the ratio t:(1-t), where t is from 0 to 1. So when t=0, D is at B, and t=1, D is at C₁.Parametric equations:The vector from B to C₁ is (4-0, 0-3, 4-0) = (4, -3, 4). So any point D on BC₁ can be written as B + t*(vector BC₁) = (0,3,0) + t*(4, -3,4) = (4t, 3 -3t, 4t). So coordinates of D are (4t, 3 -3t, 4t).Now, vector AD is from A(0,0,0) to D(4t, 3-3t,4t), so vector AD is (4t, 3-3t,4t).Vector A₁B is from A₁(0,0,4) to B(0,3,0). So vector A₁B is (0 -0, 3 -0, 0 -4) = (0,3,-4).We need AD to be perpendicular to A₁B. The dot product of AD and A₁B should be zero.Compute the dot product:AD • A₁B = (4t)(0) + (3 -3t)(3) + (4t)(-4) = 0 + 9 -9t -16t = 9 -25t.Set this equal to zero:9 -25t = 0 =&gt; t = 9/25.Therefore, the parameter t is 9/25. Therefore, point D divides BC₁ such that BD = t*BC₁ and DC₁ = (1 - t)*BC₁. Therefore, the ratio BD/BC₁ is t = 9/25.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify. If t is the parameter such that D = B + t*(C₁ - B), then BD = t*|BC₁|, so BD/BC₁ = t. Since t=9/25, then the ratio is 9/25.But let me confirm with coordinates.Coordinates of D: (4*(9/25), 3 -3*(9/25), 4*(9/25)) = (36/25, 3 -27/25, 36/25) = (36/25, 75/25 -27/25, 36/25) = (36/25, 48/25, 36/25).Then vector AD is (36/25, 48/25, 36/25). Vector A₁B is (0,3,-4). Their dot product is 0*36/25 + 3*(48/25) + (-4)*(36/25) = 0 + 144/25 -144/25 = 0. So yes, correct.Therefore, the ratio BD/BC₁ is t=9/25.But wait, is BC₁ the length of the diagonal from B to C₁? Let&#39;s compute |BC₁| to make sure.Coordinates of B: (0,3,0), C₁: (4,0,4). The distance BC₁ is sqrt((4-0)^2 + (0-3)^2 + (4-0)^2) = sqrt(16 +9 +16) = sqrt(41). So BC₁ = sqrt(41). Then BD = t*sqrt(41) = (9/25)*sqrt(41). Therefore, BD/BC₁ is 9/25. So the ratio is 9/25.Therefore, the answer is 9/25, which in box is boxed{dfrac{9}{25}}.But just to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes in parametrization. Let&#39;s double-check the parametrization of D. Since D is on BC₁, and we used the parameter t where t=0 is at B and t=1 is at C₁, so yes, moving from B to C₁ as t increases from 0 to 1. Then vector BC₁ is (4, -3, 4), so parametrization is correct. Then AD is (4t,3-3t,4t), that&#39;s correct. A₁B is (0,3,-4), yes. Then the dot product calculation: 0*4t + 3*(3-3t) + (-4)*(4t) = 9 -9t -16t =9 -25t. Correct. Then setting to 0 gives t=9/25. So yes, the ratio is 9/25. Looks solid.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{9}{25}}&lt;/think&gt;Given a triangular prism (ABC-A_1B_1C_1) with the side length of the square (AA_1C_1C) being 4, and the plane (ABC) perpendicular to the plane (AA_1C_1C). The lengths (AB = 3) and (BC = 5) are given. We need to find the value of (frac{BD}{BC_1}) where (D) is a point on segment (BC_1) such that (AD perp A_1B).1. Coordinates Assignment:   - (A = (0, 0, 0))   - (C = (4, 0, 0))   - (A_1 = (0, 0, 4))   - (C_1 = (4, 0, 4))   - (B) is determined using the right triangle (ABC) with (AB = 3), (BC = 5), and (AC = 4). Thus, (B = (0, 3, 0)).2. Coordinates of (B_1):   - Since (B_1) is the translation of (B) along the z-axis by 4 units, (B_1 = (0, 3, 4)).3. Parametrization of (D):   - The segment (BC_1) is parametrized as (D = B + t cdot (C_1 - B)).   - Coordinates of (D) are ((4t, 3 - 3t, 4t)).4. Vectors Calculation:   - Vector (AD = (4t, 3 - 3t, 4t))   - Vector (A_1B = (0, 3, -4))5. Dot Product Condition:   - For (AD perp A_1B), the dot product must be zero:     [     (4t) cdot 0 + (3 - 3t) cdot 3 + (4t) cdot (-4) = 0     ]     Simplifying, (9 - 25t = 0) gives (t = frac{9}{25}).6. Ratio Calculation:   - The ratio (frac{BD}{BC_1}) is equal to the parameter (t), which is (frac{9}{25}).Thus, the value of (frac{BD}{BC_1}) is (boxed{dfrac{9}{25}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a016c3d6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a016c3d6><span class="icon" data-v-a016c3d6>🔑:</span>4. frac{9}{25}.Establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system with overrightarrow{A C} as the x-axis, overrightarrow{A B} as the y-axis, and overrightarrow{A A_{1}} as the z-axis.

The equation is (frac{x^2}{m^2 + n} - frac{y^2}{3m^2 - n} = 1). The answer choices are given, so I need to find which interval for n satisfies the condition that the distance between the foci is 4.First, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas. For a hyperbola of the form (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), the distance between the foci is (2c), where (c^2 = a^2 + b^2). So in this case, the distance between the foci is given as 4, which means (2c = 4), so (c = 2). Therefore, we must have (c^2 = 4 = a^2 + b^2).Looking back at the given equation, the denominators under (x^2) and (y^2) correspond to (a^2) and (b^2) respectively. So here, (a^2 = m^2 + n) and (b^2 = 3m^2 - n). Therefore, according to the hyperbola formula, (c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (m^2 + n) + (3m^2 - n) = 4m^2). Wait, that&#39;s interesting. If (c^2 = 4m^2), then (c = 2|m|). The problem states that the distance between the foci is 4, so (2c = 4) which leads to (c = 2). Therefore, (2|m| = 2), so |m| = 1. Therefore, m can be 1 or -1, but since m is squared in the equation, the sign might not matter. But wait, is m a variable here or a constant?Wait, hold on. The equation is given as a hyperbola equation, so the denominators must be positive. That is, (m^2 + n &gt; 0) and (3m^2 - n &gt; 0). These are necessary conditions for the equation to represent a hyperbola. So n must satisfy both (n &gt; -m^2) and (n &lt; 3m^2). But we also found that (c = 2|m| = 2), so |m| = 1, which means m^2 = 1. Therefore, substituting m^2 = 1 into the inequalities for n:First inequality: (n &gt; -m^2 = -1).Second inequality: (n &lt; 3m^2 = 3*1 = 3.Therefore, combining these two inequalities, n must be in (-1, 3). So the range of n is (-1, 3), which is option A.But wait, let me double-check. The problem states that the equation represents a hyperbola. For that, both denominators must be positive. So (m^2 + n &gt; 0) and (3m^2 - n &gt; 0). But we also found that m^2 must be 1 because the distance between the foci is 4. Therefore, substituting m^2 = 1, we get:1 + n &gt; 0 =&gt; n &gt; -1,and3*1 - n &gt; 0 =&gt; n &lt; 3.Therefore, the range for n is indeed (-1, 3). So the answer should be option A.But wait, why are the options including things like (0,3) or (0, sqrt(3))? Maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s check again. The problem says &quot;the equation represents a hyperbola&quot;, so the denominators must be positive. Then, the hyperbola has foci at a distance of 4. So maybe m is a parameter, not a variable? Wait, the problem is about finding the range of n given that for some m, the equation represents a hyperbola with foci 4 apart.Wait, hold on. The problem says &quot;the equation (frac{x^2}{m^2 + n} - frac{y^2}{3m^2 - n} = 1) represents a hyperbola, and the distance between the two foci of this hyperbola is 4. Then, the range of n is...&quot; So, the equation is given with parameters m and n. So, m is not fixed here. Wait, but we need to find the range of n such that there exists some m for which the equation is a hyperbola with foci 4 apart. Or is m given?Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it again:&quot;The equation (frac{x^2}{m^2 + n} - frac{y^2}{3m^2 - n} = 1) represents a hyperbola, and the distance between the two foci of this hyperbola is 4. Then, the range of n is...&quot; So, the equation is a hyperbola for some m and n, and given that the distance between foci is 4, find the possible n.Therefore, m is a variable here as well? Or is m a fixed number?Wait, actually, in hyperbola equations, the denominators are constants. So m and n are parameters. So for given m and n, this equation represents a hyperbola with certain properties. The problem states that the distance between the foci is 4, so given that, we need to find the range of n.But then, m is another parameter here. So the equation must be a hyperbola (so denominators positive) and have foci 4 apart. So perhaps the answer is the set of n such that there exists an m where both the hyperbola conditions and the foci distance condition are satisfied.Therefore, to find the range of n, we need to find all n for which there exists some m such that:1. (m^2 + n &gt; 0)2. (3m^2 - n &gt; 0)3. (c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (m^2 + n) + (3m^2 - n) = 4m^2), so (c = 2|m|). Then, the distance between foci is (2c = 4|m|). The problem says this distance is 4, so 4|m| = 4, hence |m| = 1, so m^2 = 1.Therefore, substituting m^2 = 1 into the inequalities 1 and 2:1. (1 + n &gt; 0) =&gt; (n &gt; -1)2. (3*1 - n &gt; 0) =&gt; (n &lt; 3)Therefore, combining these, n must be in (-1, 3). So the answer is A.But wait, that makes sense. So because m^2 must be 1 to satisfy the foci distance, the inequalities for n become dependent on m^2 = 1, leading to n &gt; -1 and n &lt; 3.Therefore, the range of n is (-1, 3), which is option A. Therefore, I think the answer is A.But the options also include B: (-1, sqrt(3)), C: (0,3), D: (0, sqrt(3)). So why are these other options here? Let me check if I made a mistake.Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is saying that for all m, the equation represents a hyperbola with foci 4 apart, so n must satisfy conditions for all m? But that doesn&#39;t make sense because m is in the equation. If the problem is stating that the equation represents a hyperbola (so for some m and n) with foci 4 apart, then n&#39;s range is as I found. But if it&#39;s saying that for all m, the equation is a hyperbola with foci 4 apart, then n would have to satisfy the inequalities for all m, which would be different, but that seems impossible because m can vary.But the problem states: &quot;the equation ... represents a hyperbola, and the distance between the two foci ... is 4. Then, the range of n is...&quot; So it&#39;s probably referring to the equation with parameters m and n, such that it is a hyperbola with foci distance 4. Therefore, n must be such that there exists an m making denominators positive and foci distance 4. Therefore, as I solved before, substituting m^2 =1, leading to n in (-1,3). Therefore, answer A.But perhaps I need to check if the equations for the hyperbola are valid for m^2 =1. Let&#39;s substitute m^2=1, so the equation becomes (frac{x^2}{1 + n} - frac{y^2}{3 - n} = 1). For this to be a hyperbola, we need 1 + n &gt; 0 and 3 - n &gt; 0, which again gives n &gt; -1 and n &lt; 3. So the range is (-1, 3). Hence, option A.Therefore, I think the correct answer is A. The options with sqrt(3) might be trying to trick us, but unless there&#39;s a miscalculation, my steps seem correct. Let me double-check the foci distance.For hyperbola (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} =1), the distance between foci is 2c, where c^2 =a^2 + b^2. Here, a^2 = m^2 +n, b^2 = 3m^2 -n. Then c^2 = (m^2 +n)+(3m^2 -n) =4m^2. Therefore, c=2|m|. The distance between foci is 2c =4|m|. This is given as 4, so 4|m|=4 =&gt; |m|=1 =&gt; m=1 or m=-1, so m^2=1. Therefore, substituting back, the conditions on n are n &gt; -1 and n &lt;3. Thus, n is in (-1,3), which is answer A.Therefore, I think the answer is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given the hyperbola equation (frac{x^2}{m^2 + n} - frac{y^2}{3m^2 - n} = 1) with the distance between the foci being 4, we need to determine the range of (n).1. Hyperbola Properties: For a hyperbola of the form (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), the distance between the foci is (2c), where (c^2 = a^2 + b^2).2. Given Distance: The distance between the foci is 4, so (2c = 4) implies (c = 2). Therefore, (c^2 = 4).3. Identify (a^2) and (b^2): For the given equation, (a^2 = m^2 + n) and (b^2 = 3m^2 - n).4. Calculate (c^2):    [   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (m^2 + n) + (3m^2 - n) = 4m^2   ]   Given (c^2 = 4), we have (4m^2 = 4) which implies (m^2 = 1).5. Conditions for Hyperbola: The denominators must be positive:   - (m^2 + n &gt; 0)   - (3m^2 - n &gt; 0)6. Substitute (m^2 = 1):   - (1 + n &gt; 0 implies n &gt; -1)   - (3(1) - n &gt; 0 implies n &lt; 3)Combining these inequalities, the range of (n) is ((-1, 3)).Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{A}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the range of n for the hyperbola equation given that the distance between the two foci is 4. The equation is (x²)/(m² + n) - (y²)/(3m² - n) = 1. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.First, I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola is (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1, which has foci at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². The distance between the foci is 2c. In this problem, the distance is 4, so 2c = 4, which means c = 2. Therefore, c² = 4.So applying this to the given equation, the denominators under x² and y² are a² and b² respectively. But here, a² is (m² + n) and b² is (3m² - n). Therefore, c² = a² + b² = (m² + n) + (3m² - n) = 4m². Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So c² = 4m². But we know c² must be 4. So 4m² = 4, which simplifies to m² = 1. Therefore, m² is 1. So m can be either 1 or -1, but since m² is 1, m is ±1. But since m is squared in the equation, maybe the actual value of m doesn&#39;t matter, just m²=1.But hold on, if m² is fixed at 1, then we can substitute that into the denominators. Let me check that again.Given the hyperbola equation: (x²)/(m² + n) - (y²)/(3m² - n) = 1. The standard form requires that both denominators are positive because a² and b² must be positive. So for the hyperbola to exist, m² + n &gt; 0 and 3m² - n &gt; 0. These are the conditions for the denominators to be positive.But we just found that c² = 4m² = 4, so m² = 1. Therefore, substituting m² = 1 into the denominators:For the x² denominator: 1 + n &gt; 0 ⇒ n &gt; -1.For the y² denominator: 3*1 - n &gt; 0 ⇒ 3 - n &gt; 0 ⇒ n &lt; 3.Therefore, combining these two inequalities, n must be greater than -1 and less than 3. So the range is (-1, 3), which is option A.Wait, but let me double-check. Since m² is 1, then the denominators are 1 + n and 3 - n. So yes, both must be positive. Therefore, 1 + n &gt; 0 ⇒ n &gt; -1 and 3 - n &gt; 0 ⇒ n &lt; 3. So combining gives -1 &lt; n &lt; 3. That&#39;s the range. Therefore, the answer should be A.But let me check again if there&#39;s any other condition. For a hyperbola, both denominators must be positive, which we considered. Also, the foci distance is given, which led us to c² = 4, and since c² = a² + b² = (1 + n) + (3 - n) = 4, which is consistent. So regardless of n, the sum of a² and b² is 4. But since a² and b² have to individually be positive, the constraints on n are just the ones leading to those denominators being positive. Therefore, n must lie between -1 and 3. So the correct answer is A.But hold on, the options given are A: (-1,3), B: (-1, sqrt(3)), C: (0,3), D: (0, sqrt(3)). So A is (-1,3). The reasoning seems to lead to A, but let me check once more.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in assuming that m² is 1. Let&#39;s see. The problem states that the equation represents a hyperbola, and the distance between the foci is 4. So perhaps m is a variable here? Wait, the problem says &quot;the equation represents a hyperbola&quot;, so m and n must be such that the denominators are positive. Then, given that, the distance between the foci is 4. So maybe m isn&#39;t fixed? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.Let me go back. The equation is (x²)/(m² + n) - (y²)/(3m² - n) = 1. For this to be a hyperbola, the denominators must be positive. So m² + n &gt; 0 and 3m² - n &gt; 0. The distance between foci is 4, which is 2c = 4, so c = 2. Then, for hyperbola, c² = a² + b². Here, a² = m² + n, b² = 3m² - n. Therefore, c² = (m² + n) + (3m² - n) = 4m². Therefore, c² = 4m². But we have c = 2, so c² = 4. Therefore, 4m² = 4 ⇒ m² = 1. Therefore, m² must be 1. So m is ±1, but since m is squared, m² is 1 regardless.So with m² = 1, the denominators become 1 + n and 3 - n. Therefore, the conditions for the hyperbola are 1 + n &gt; 0 and 3 - n &gt; 0, which gives n &gt; -1 and n &lt; 3, so n ∈ (-1, 3). Therefore, the answer is A.But the problem didn&#39;t specify any constraints on m. Wait, but in the problem statement, the hyperbola is given with m and n, and the distance between foci is 4. Then, solving for that distance gives us m² = 1. So m is fixed in terms of the foci distance. Therefore, once m² is fixed, the conditions on n are just 1 + n &gt; 0 and 3 - n &gt; 0, leading to n ∈ (-1,3). So the answer is A.But the options include other ranges. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake here. Let me check once again.Wait, the problem says &quot;the equation represents a hyperbola, and the distance between the two foci of this hyperbola is 4&quot;. So both conditions must hold. So first, to be a hyperbola, the denominators must be positive. Then, the foci distance is 4, leading to c² = 4, which in turn leads to m² = 1. Then, with m² = 1, the denominators are 1 + n and 3 - n, which must be positive. Hence, n &gt; -1 and n &lt; 3. Therefore, n ∈ (-1,3). So A is correct.But why is there an option C: (0,3)? Maybe I&#39;m missing something.Wait, perhaps m² is not necessarily 1? Wait, how did we get m² = 1? From the distance between foci being 4. Let me check that again.The standard hyperbola has foci distance 2c, which is given as 4, so c = 2. For the given hyperbola equation, c² = a² + b². Here, a² is m² + n and b² is 3m² - n. Therefore, c² = (m² + n) + (3m² - n) = 4m². So c² = 4m². But c is given as 2, so c² = 4. Therefore, 4m² = 4 ⇒ m² = 1. Therefore, m² must equal 1. So that&#39;s fixed. Therefore, m is ±1, but m² is 1 regardless.Therefore, substituting m² = 1 into the denominators, we get 1 + n and 3 - n. These denominators must be positive. So 1 + n &gt; 0 ⇒ n &gt; -1, and 3 - n &gt; 0 ⇒ n &lt; 3. Therefore, the range of n is (-1, 3). So the answer is A. Therefore, the answer is option A.But let me think again if there is any other possible interpretation. Maybe m is a variable and n is a parameter? Wait, the problem states the equation represents a hyperbola with foci distance 4, and asks for the range of n. So m is part of the equation, but perhaps m can be any real number, and n is to be found such that for some m, the equation is a hyperbola with foci 4 apart? Wait, but the problem says &quot;the equation represents a hyperbola, and the distance...&quot;, so maybe m and n are parameters such that the equation is a hyperbola with the given foci distance. Therefore, we need to find all n such that there exists an m where the equation is a hyperbola (so denominators positive) and foci distance 4. Therefore, in this case, m can vary, but needs to satisfy 4m² = 4 (from c² = 4m² = 4). Therefore, m² = 1. Therefore, m must be ±1. So m is fixed. Then, with m² = 1, n must satisfy 1 + n &gt; 0 and 3 - n &gt; 0. So n ∈ (-1,3). Therefore, regardless of m (as m is fixed to ±1), the range of n is (-1,3). Therefore, the answer is A.Alternatively, if m could vary, but I don&#39;t think so. Because the foci distance is given as 4, which leads to m² = 1. So m is fixed. Therefore, the only variables here are n, but m is determined by the foci distance. So the hyperbola equation has m and n, but once the foci distance is given, m is fixed, and n is constrained by the positivity of denominators. Therefore, n must be in (-1,3). So answer is A.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation here. Let me verify each step.1. The equation is a hyperbola, so denominators must be positive: m² + n &gt; 0 and 3m² - n &gt; 0.2. The foci distance is 4, so 2c = 4 ⇒ c = 2 ⇒ c² = 4.3. For hyperbola, c² = a² + b² = (m² + n) + (3m² - n) = 4m².4. Therefore, 4m² = 4 ⇒ m² = 1.5. Substitute m² = 1 into the denominators: 1 + n &gt; 0 and 3 - n &gt; 0.6. Solving these gives n &gt; -1 and n &lt; 3 ⇒ n ∈ (-1, 3).Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is A. Therefore, the correct option is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given the hyperbola equation (frac{x^2}{m^2 + n} - frac{y^2}{3m^2 - n} = 1) and the distance between the foci being 4, we need to determine the range of (n).1. Identify the standard form of the hyperbola:   - The standard form is (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1).   - For this hyperbola, (a^2 = m^2 + n) and (b^2 = 3m^2 - n).2. Distance between foci:   - The distance between the foci is (2c), which is given as 4. Therefore, (c = 2).   - For a hyperbola, (c^2 = a^2 + b^2).3. Calculate (c^2):   - Substitute (a^2) and (b^2) into the equation: (c^2 = (m^2 + n) + (3m^2 - n) = 4m^2).   - Given (c = 2), we have (c^2 = 4). Thus, (4m^2 = 4) implies (m^2 = 1).4. Conditions for the denominators:   - Substitute (m^2 = 1) into the denominators:     - (m^2 + n = 1 + n &gt; 0 implies n &gt; -1)     - (3m^2 - n = 3 - n &gt; 0 implies n &lt; 3)5.

The condition is that there are exactly two adjacent empty seats. And the answer is supposed to be 480. Hmm, let me try to figure out how that works.First, let me visualize the scenario. There are 7 seats in a row, and 4 are occupied by students, leaving 3 empty seats. The key condition here is that exactly two of those empty seats are adjacent, and the third one is separate. So, we need to count all possible seating arrangements where this specific condition holds.Alright, step one: maybe I should figure out how many ways there are to arrange the students and the empty seats such that exactly two are adjacent. Then, multiply by the permutations of the students.But let&#39;s break it down. First, how many ways can we arrange the empty seats? Since there are 3 empty seats, and they must have exactly two adjacent and one separate. So, we need to place these three empty seats in the row of 7, with exactly two adjacent and the third not adjacent to them. So, the two adjacent empty seats form a block, and the third empty seat is somewhere else not adjacent to this block.Wait, but in a row of 7 seats, if we have a block of two adjacent empty seats and one separate empty seat, we need to ensure that the separate one isn&#39;t adjacent to the block. So, the block can be placed in different positions, and the single empty seat has to be placed such that it&#39;s not next to the block.Alternatively, maybe another approach is to first place the students and then consider where the empty seats can be. Let&#39;s see.But perhaps it&#39;s easier to model the empty seats. Let&#39;s think of arranging the three empty seats with exactly two adjacent. So, the two adjacent empty seats can be considered as a single entity (a &quot;double&quot; empty seat), and then the third empty seat is a single entity. However, we have to make sure that the single empty seat is not adjacent to the double empty seat. Otherwise, if the single is adjacent to the double, that would form three consecutive empty seats, which violates the condition of having exactly two adjacent.Therefore, we need to place these two entities (the double empty seat and the single empty seat) in the row of 7 seats such that they are not adjacent. Then, the remaining seats are occupied by students.Wait, but how do we model this? Let&#39;s think of the 7 seats as positions 1 to 7. We need to place a block of two adjacent seats (double empty) and one single empty seat such that they are not adjacent. Then, the remaining 4 seats are occupied by students.First, let&#39;s compute the number of ways to place the double empty seat and the single empty seat with the non-adjacency condition.To do this, perhaps we can model the problem as arranging the two entities (double and single) in the row. The number of ways to arrange these two entities without them being adjacent.But actually, the two entities are the double empty seat (which occupies 2 seats) and the single empty seat (which occupies 1 seat). So, effectively, we need to place these two entities in the 7 seats such that they don&#39;t overlap and aren&#39;t adjacent.But how do we compute that?Alternatively, think of the problem as first placing the double empty seat, then placing the single empty seat such that it&#39;s not adjacent to the double.So, first, how many ways are there to place the double empty seat in 7 seats? The number of positions for a block of 2 adjacent seats is 6 (positions 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7). Then, once the double is placed, we need to place the single empty seat in the remaining seats that are not adjacent to the double block.But after placing the double block, how many seats are left? Let&#39;s see.If we have a double block in positions i and i+1, then the adjacent seats would be i-1 and i+2 (if they exist). So, the seats adjacent to the double block are the ones just before and just after the block.Therefore, the remaining available seats for the single empty seat would be total seats (7) minus the double block (2) minus the adjacent seats (which could be 2, 1, or 0 depending on the position of the block).Wait, actually, the number of forbidden seats for the single empty seat depends on where the double block is placed.For example, if the double block is at the beginning (positions 1-2), then the adjacent seats would be position 3. Similarly, if the double block is at the end (positions 6-7), the adjacent seat would be position 5. If the double block is in the middle (positions 3-4, say), then the adjacent seats would be positions 2 and 5.Therefore, depending on the position of the double block, the number of forbidden seats (adjacent to the block) is:- If the double block is at the very start (positions 1-2) or very end (positions 6-7), then there is 1 adjacent seat (position 3 or 5 respectively).- If the double block is in the middle (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6), then there are 2 adjacent seats (position i-1 and i+2).Therefore, when placing the single empty seat, the number of available seats would be:Total seats: 7Minus seats occupied by the double block: 2Minus seats adjacent to the double block: either 1 or 2So, available seats for the single empty seat: 7 - 2 - adjacent seats.Wait, but actually, the adjacent seats are not necessarily occupied. The adjacent seats are forbidden to be occupied by the single empty seat. So, the remaining seats are 7 - 2 (double) = 5, but we need to subtract the adjacent seats (1 or 2) from these 5, because the single empty seat cannot be placed there.Therefore, the available seats for the single empty seat would be 5 - adjacent seats.So, for double blocks at the ends (positions 1-2 or 6-7), adjacent seats are 1, so available seats: 5 - 1 = 4.For double blocks in the middle (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6), adjacent seats are 2, so available seats: 5 - 2 = 3.Therefore, total number of ways to place the double and single empty seats:Number of double blocks at the ends: 2 (positions 1-2 and 6-7). For each, available seats for single empty: 4. So, 2 * 4 = 8.Number of double blocks in the middle: 4 (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6). For each, available seats: 3. So, 4 * 3 = 12.Total ways to place the empty seats: 8 + 12 = 20.But wait, but each of these placements corresponds to different configurations. However, we need to consider that the single empty seat is distinguishable? No, actually, the empty seats are indistinct. Wait, but in our case, we&#39;re placing the double block and the single empty seat. Since all empty seats are the same, but the double block is two adjacent seats. So, perhaps each placement is unique based on the positions.But let me check. For example, if we have a double block at positions 1-2 and a single empty seat at position 4. Then, the total empty seats are 1,2,4. If we have a double block at positions 1-2 and a single empty seat at position 5, then the empty seats are 1,2,5. These are different configurations. So, yes, each placement is unique.Therefore, the total number of ways to place the empty seats is 20.But wait, but in the problem statement, there are 3 empty seats. So, in total, 7 seats, 3 empty, 4 occupied. However, when we place the double block and the single seat, that accounts for all three empty seats. So, the number of ways is 20.Therefore, once we have the positions of the empty seats determined, we need to arrange the 4 students in the remaining 4 seats. Since the students are distinct, the number of permutations is 4! = 24.Therefore, total number of seating arrangements is 20 * 24 = 480. Oh, that&#39;s the answer given. So that seems to check out.Wait, but let me confirm.Wait, when we calculated the number of ways to place the empty seats, we considered the double blocks and the single empty seat. So:- For double blocks at the ends (positions 1-2 and 6-7), each allows 4 choices for the single empty seat. So 2 blocks * 4 seats = 8.- For double blocks in the middle (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6), each allows 3 choices for the single empty seat. So 4 blocks * 3 seats = 12.Total 8 + 12 = 20. Then, multiplied by 4! (24) gives 480. That makes sense.But let me check with another approach to make sure.Alternative approach: consider all possible ways to arrange 4 students and 3 empty seats, then subtract those arrangements where the three empty seats are all together or all separated.Wait, but the condition is exactly two adjacent empty seats. So, total number of arrangements with three empty seats is C(7,3) * 4! = 35 * 24 = 840.But from this, we need to subtract the cases where all three empty seats are adjacent (forming a block of three) or where all three empty seats are isolated (no two are adjacent).So, total invalid cases are:1. All three empty seats adjacent: there are 5 such positions (positions 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6, 5-6-7). For each of these, the number of arrangements is 5 * 4! = 5 * 24 = 120.2. All three empty seats isolated: meaning no two are adjacent. So, we need to choose three seats such that none are adjacent. How many ways are there to choose three non-adjacent seats in 7 seats?This is equivalent to placing three objects in seven seats with no two adjacent. The formula for choosing k non-adjacent items in n seats is C(n - k + 1, k). So here, n =7, k=3. So C(7 - 3 +1, 3) = C(5,3) = 10. Therefore, 10 ways. Then, arrangements would be 10 * 4! = 10 * 24 = 240.Therefore, total invalid cases are 120 + 240 = 360. Therefore, valid cases are total arrangements 840 - 360 = 480. Which matches the answer.So, that&#39;s another way to confirm. Therefore, the answer is indeed 480.But let me try yet another approach for thoroughness.Third approach: Treat the three empty seats. The condition is exactly one pair of adjacent empty seats and one separate. So, first, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the three empty seats with exactly one pair.To compute this, we can think of arranging the three empty seats as a block of two and a single, with the single not adjacent to the block.The number of ways to place such a configuration in the row of 7 seats is equal to the number computed before, 20. Therefore, 20 * 4! = 480.Alternatively, another way to compute the number of such configurations:First, choose the position for the block of two adjacent empty seats. There are 6 possible blocks (as before: 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7). For each such block, we need to place the third empty seat such that it is not adjacent to the block.As before, for blocks at the ends (positions 1-2 and 6-7), the forbidden positions for the third seat are 3 and 5, respectively. So, for block 1-2, forbidden is 3; remaining seats: 4,5,6,7. Wait, but total seats are 7. If the block is 1-2, the occupied seats by the block are 1 and 2. The forbidden seat is 3. So, the third empty seat can be placed in seats 4,5,6,7. That&#39;s 4 choices.Similarly, for block 6-7, forbidden seat is 5. So, third empty seat can be placed in 1,2,3,4. That&#39;s 4 choices.For the blocks in the middle (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6), the forbidden seats are the ones adjacent to the block. For example, block 2-3: forbidden seats are 1 and 4. So, third empty seat can be placed in 5,6,7. Similarly, block 3-4: forbidden seats are 2 and 5; third empty seat can be placed in 1,6,7. Wait, but in a 7-seat row, for block 3-4, forbidden are 2 and 5. So available seats are 1,6,7. That&#39;s 3 choices. Similarly for other middle blocks.So, for each middle block, there are 3 available seats for the third empty seat. Since there are 4 middle blocks, total is 4*3=12.For the two end blocks, 2 blocks *4 seats=8. Total 8+12=20. Then, 20 *4! =480. Same result.Therefore, all approaches lead to 480. So, the answer is indeed correct.But just to ensure I haven&#39;t missed anything, let me consider a small case. Suppose there are 4 seats and 2 students. Wait, no, maybe not. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, maybe check with n=5 seats, 2 students, 3 empty seats with exactly two adjacent. But this might complicate. Alternatively, maybe step through the original problem again.Total seats:7. Students:4. Empty:3. Exactly two adjacent empty seats.First method: Place the double block and the single empty seat not adjacent. 20 ways. Multiply by 4! =24. 20*24=480.Second method: Total arrangements C(7,3)*4! =35*24=840. Subtract arrangements where all three empty are adjacent (5*24=120) and all three empty are isolated (10*24=240). 840-120-240=480.Third method: same as first. So, all methods concur.Therefore, the answer is 480. Seems solid.Final AnswerThe number of different seating arrangements is boxed{480}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of different seating arrangements for four students in a row of 7 seats such that there are exactly two adjacent empty seats, we can break down the problem as follows:1. Identify the positions for the empty seats:   - We need exactly two adjacent empty seats (forming a block) and one separate empty seat not adjacent to this block.   - Calculate the number of ways to place the block of two adjacent empty seats and the single empty seat.2. Calculate the number of valid configurations for the empty seats:   - Blocks at the ends (positions 1-2 or 6-7):     - For each end block, there are 4 available seats for the single empty seat.     - Total: (2 text{ blocks} times 4 text{ seats} = 8).   - Blocks in the middle (positions 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6):     - For each middle block, there are 3 available seats for the single empty seat.     - Total: (4 text{ blocks} times 3 text{ seats} = 12).   - Total configurations: (8 + 12 = 20).3. Arrange the students:   - The 4 students can be arranged in the 4 occupied seats in (4!) ways.   - Total permutations: (4! = 24).4. Calculate the total number of seating arrangements:   - Multiply the number of valid configurations by the permutations of the students: (20 times 24 = 480).Thus, the number of different seating arrangements is (boxed{480}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there are four students sitting in a row of 7 seats. The condition is that there are exactly two adjacent empty seats. I need to find the number of different seating arrangements. The answer is supposed to be 480, but I need to work through it step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have 7 seats in a row. Four students are sitting there, so 4 seats are occupied and 3 are empty. But the empty seats have to be exactly two adjacent ones and one separate. So, the three empty seats can&#39;t all be together, and they can&#39;t all be separate. They must form a block of two and then a single one somewhere else. Wait, no—actually, the problem says &quot;exactly two adjacent empty seats.&quot; Hmm. Does that mean that among the three empty seats, exactly two are adjacent and the third is not adjacent to them? Because if the three empty seats were two adjacent and one adjacent to that block, then that would make three adjacent empty seats. So the problem says there are exactly two adjacent empty seats, so that the third empty seat is not adjacent to the block of two. So, the total empty seats are three: two together and one separate. That seems right.So, the first thing is to model the seating. We need to arrange four students in seven seats such that exactly two of the empty seats are adjacent and the third is separate. So, the three empty seats can be divided into a block of two and a single, with the single not adjacent to the block. Let&#39;s confirm that. If we have three empty seats, two adjacent and one separate, then the total number of empty seats is three. So, the total seats are seven. So, the occupied seats are four. So, seating arrangements would be the number of ways to place the students such that the empty seats meet that adjacency condition.So, perhaps the way to approach this is to first count the number of ways to arrange the empty seats, and then multiply by the number of permutations of the students. So, first, how many ways can we arrange the three empty seats such that exactly two are adjacent and the third is separate. Then, once we have those positions, we can arrange the four students in the remaining four seats, which would be 4! = 24 ways. So, the total number of arrangements would be the number of ways to choose the empty seats times 24.So, first step: find the number of ways to place three empty seats in seven seats with exactly two adjacent and the third not adjacent.To compute that, perhaps we can model the problem as placing a block of two empty seats and a single empty seat, such that the single is not adjacent to the block.First, let&#39;s think of the two adjacent empty seats as a single entity or block. Then, the single empty seat is another entity. So, we need to place these two entities (the block of two and the single) in the row of seven seats such that they are not adjacent to each other.But wait, when we place the block of two and the single, they can&#39;t be adjacent. So, it&#39;s similar to placing two non-adjacent objects in the row. The total number of seats occupied by these two entities is 2 (for the block) + 1 (for the single) = 3 seats. But since they can&#39;t be adjacent, we need to ensure that there is at least one seat between the block and the single.Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as arranging the four occupied seats and three empty seats with the condition on the empty seats.But maybe starting with the empty seats is better.First, let&#39;s count the number of ways to choose positions for the three empty seats such that exactly two are adjacent and the third is not adjacent to them. So, the three empty seats consist of a pair and a single, not forming a triplet.So, to count the number of such arrangements:First, find all possible positions for a block of two adjacent seats. Then, for each such block, find the number of single seats that are not adjacent to the block.But need to ensure that the single seat is not adjacent to the two-seat block. Also, after placing the two-seat block and the single seat, the remaining seats are occupied.Alternatively, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion. Let&#39;s see.Total number of ways to choose three empty seats: C(7,3) = 35. From these, we subtract the number of arrangements where all three empty seats are adjacent (which would form a block of three), and subtract the number of arrangements where all three empty seats are isolated (i.e., no two are adjacent). Wait, but the problem states that exactly two are adjacent, so we need exactly one pair of adjacent empty seats and the third is separate. So, actually, maybe we need to compute directly the number of ways where there is exactly one pair of adjacent empty seats and the third is not adjacent to that pair.Alternatively, here&#39;s a method:First, compute the number of ways to have exactly one pair of adjacent empty seats and one separate empty seat. To compute this, we can consider:1. Choose the position for the pair of adjacent empty seats. The number of possible adjacent pairs in 7 seats is 6 (since pairs can be seats 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7).2. For each such pair, we need to choose a position for the third empty seat such that it is not adjacent to the pair. So, after placing the pair, some seats become unavailable for the single empty seat.Let&#39;s think. For example, suppose the pair is in positions i and i+1. Then, the seats adjacent to this pair are i-1 and i+2 (if they exist). So, the third empty seat cannot be in i-1, i, i+1, or i+2. Wait, but seats i and i+1 are already part of the pair, so they are already occupied (or rather, empty). Wait, actually, the third empty seat has to be in one of the remaining seats, but not adjacent to the pair. So, if the pair is in seats i and i+1, then the seats adjacent to the pair are i-1 and i+2. Therefore, the third empty seat cannot be in i-1 or i+2. So, for each pair, we need to subtract those adjacent seats from the available seats.But the total seats are 7. If we have a pair in positions i and i+1, then the forbidden seats for the third empty seat are i-1 and i+2 (if they exist). Also, the seats i and i+1 are already taken by the pair. So, the available seats for the third empty seat would be 7 - 2 (the pair) - 2 (the adjacent ones if they exist). But depending on where the pair is, the number of forbidden seats might be less. For example, if the pair is at the beginning (seats 1-2), then the adjacent seat to the pair is seat 3. Similarly, if the pair is at the end (seats 6-7), the adjacent seat is seat 5. For pairs in the middle, like seats 3-4, the adjacent seats are 2 and 5.So, let&#39;s formalize this.Total adjacent pairs: 6 (positions 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7). For each pair, the adjacent seats are:- For pair 1-2: adjacent seat is 3. So, forbidden seats are 3. Also, seats 1 and 2 are already part of the pair. So, the remaining available seats are 4,5,6,7. But seat 3 is forbidden. So, available seats for the third empty seat are 4,5,6,7: 4 seats.- For pair 2-3: adjacent seats are 1 and 4. So, forbidden seats are 1 and 4. So, available seats: 5,6,7. 3 seats.Wait, but the total seats are 7. The pair is 2-3. So, seats 2 and 3 are taken. Forbidden seats are 1 and 4. So, remaining seats: 5,6,7. So, 3 seats.Similarly, for pair 3-4: adjacent seats are 2 and 5. So, forbidden seats 2 and 5. Remaining available seats: 1,6,7. 3 seats.For pair 4-5: adjacent seats 3 and 6. Forbidden seats 3 and 6. Remaining available seats: 1,2,7. 3 seats.For pair 5-6: adjacent seats 4 and 7. Forbidden seats 4 and 7. Remaining available seats: 1,2,3. 3 seats.For pair 6-7: adjacent seat 5. Forbidden seat 5. Remaining available seats: 1,2,3,4. 4 seats.So, for each pair:- Pairs at the ends (1-2 and 6-7) have 4 available seats for the third empty seat.- Pairs in the middle (2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6) have 3 available seats each.Therefore, the total number of ways is:For pairs 1-2 and 6-7: 2 pairs * 4 seats = 8.For pairs 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6: 4 pairs * 3 seats = 12.Total: 8 + 12 = 20.But wait, is this the number of ways to choose the three empty seats? Wait, each pair and a single seat. But when we choose a pair and a single seat not adjacent to the pair, each combination is unique? Let&#39;s check for overcounting.Suppose we have three empty seats: two adjacent and one separate. For example, seats 1-2 and 4. This would be counted when we choose the pair 1-2 and the single seat 4. Similarly, seats 2-3 and 5: pair 2-3 and single seat 5.But what if the single seat is adjacent to the pair but on the other side? Wait, no. Because when we choose the pair, we exclude the adjacent seats. So, for example, if we have pair 2-3, we can&#39;t have the single seat in 1 or 4. So, the third seat is in 5,6,7. So, there&#39;s no overlap. So, each combination is unique. So, 20 possible ways.But wait, 20 possible ways to choose the three empty seats (two adjacent and one separate). Then, the number of seating arrangements is 20 * 4! = 20 * 24 = 480. Which matches the given answer. So, that&#39;s the solution.But wait, let me confirm. Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose pair 1-2 and single seat 4. Then, the empty seats are 1,2,4. The occupied seats are 3,5,6,7. Then, the students can be arranged in those four seats in 4! ways. Similarly, for each of the 20 seat combinations, we have 4! arrangements. So, 20*24=480.But let me double-check the count of the empty seat arrangements. Let&#39;s see:First, pairs at the ends (1-2 and 6-7):For pair 1-2: forbidden seat is 3. Available seats for third empty seat: 4,5,6,7. So, 4 options.For pair 6-7: forbidden seat is 5. Available seats: 1,2,3,4. So, 4 options. Total for end pairs: 4+4=8.Middle pairs (2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6):For pair 2-3: forbidden seats 1 and 4. Available seats:5,6,7. 3 options.For pair 3-4: forbidden seats 2 and5. Available seats:1,6,7. 3 options.For pair 4-5: forbidden seats3 and6. Available seats:1,2,7. 3 options.For pair5-6: forbidden seats4 and7. Available seats:1,2,3. 3 options.So, 3 options each, four pairs: 3*4=12.Total:8+12=20.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s model the problem as inserting the block of two empty seats and the single empty seat into the row, considering the occupied seats.But maybe the first approach is correct.Alternatively, perhaps using stars and bars. Let&#39;s think of the four occupied seats as dividers, creating five gaps (before the first seat, between seats 1 and 2, etc., up to after seat7). Wait, actually, since the seats are in a row, the arrangement is linear. So, arranging four occupied seats and three empty seats with the condition on the empty seats.But stars and bars is for indistinct objects, but here the seats are distinct because their positions matter. So, maybe not directly applicable.Alternatively, here&#39;s another way. Let&#39;s consider that the three empty seats must consist of exactly one block of two and one single, with the single not adjacent to the block. So, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to place the block of two and the single, with the single not adjacent.So, first, place the block of two. There are 6 possible blocks (positions 1-2, ..., 6-7). For each block, the number of available seats for the single is 7 - 2 (the block) - 2 (adjacent seats if they exist). As calculated before, for end blocks, you subtract 1 adjacent seat, so 7 - 2 -1 =4. For middle blocks, subtract 2 adjacent seats, so 7 -2 -2=3. So, same as before.So, same calculation: 2*4 + 4*3=20. Therefore, 20 ways to place the empty seats, times 4! for arranging students: 20*24=480.Therefore, the answer is 480.But let me check with another approach to confirm.Suppose we consider the problem as arranging the four students and three empty seats, with exactly two adjacent empty seats. So, first, we can think of the three empty seats as a block of two and a single. The number of ways to arrange these blocks in the row.So, treating the block of two empty seats as an entity and the single empty seat as another entity, we need to place these two entities in the row such that they are not adjacent. Then, the remaining seats are occupied by students.So, the total number of entities is 4 students + 1 block + 1 single = 6 entities. Wait, no. Wait, if we consider the block of two empty seats as one entity and the single empty seat as another, then the total number of entities is 4 students + 1 block +1 single = 6 entities. But the students are individual entities. Wait, but the students are separate, so maybe this approach is not straightforward.Alternatively, the number of ways to place the block of two empty seats and the single empty seat in the row, with the single not adjacent to the block. Then, the remaining seats are filled with students. The number of ways to arrange the students is 4!.So, the problem reduces to placing two entities: a block (size 2) and a single (size 1), such that they are not adjacent. Then, the rest are filled with students.The number of ways to place these two entities in the row is equal to the number of ways to choose positions for the block and the single seat with the required condition.To compute this, we can model it as arranging the block and the single seat in the 7-seat row, with the restriction that they are not adjacent. The total number of ways to place the block and the single seat without any restrictions is C(7 - 2 +1, 1) * C(7 -1,1). Wait, perhaps another way.Alternatively, the number of ways to place the block of two is 6 (as before). For each block, the number of ways to place the single seat is (7 - 2 - 2) if the block is in the middle, or (7 - 2 -1) if the block is at the end. As before, so 20 ways. So, same result.Alternatively, think of the problem as arranging the four students first, and then placing the empty seats. But that might complicate things.If we arrange the four students first, they occupy four seats, leaving three empty. The condition is that exactly two of these empty seats are adjacent. So, how many ways can the three empty seats be placed such that exactly two are adjacent.But arranging the students first might not be the best approach because the positions of the students and empty seats are interdependent.Alternatively, use inclusion-exclusion. Total number of seating arrangements with four students: C(7,4)*4! = 35*24=840. Now, subtract the arrangements where the three empty seats are all adjacent or all isolated.Wait, but the problem states exactly two adjacent empty seats. So, total invalid cases are when all three empty seats are adjacent or when all three are isolated (no two are adjacent). So, the number of valid arrangements is total arrangements minus arrangements with all three empty seats adjacent minus arrangements with all three empty seats isolated.First, total arrangements: 7C4 *4! =35*24=840.Number of arrangements where all three empty seats are adjacent: this is equivalent to having a block of three empty seats. The number of positions for a block of three in seven seats is 5 (positions 1-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-6,5-7). For each such block, the number of seating arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the four students in the remaining four seats. So, 5*4! =5*24=120.Number of arrangements where all three empty seats are isolated (i.e., no two are adjacent). To compute this, we need to place three empty seats such that none are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing three seats with at least one seat between each. The number of ways to choose three non-adjacent seats out of seven can be computed using stars and bars.The formula for the number of ways to place k non-adjacent items in n seats is C(n -k +1, k). So here, n=7, k=3. So, C(7 -3 +1,3)=C(5,3)=10. But wait, is that correct?Wait, the formula for placing k non-adjacent objects in n seats is C(n -k +1, k). Let me verify. If you have n seats and you want to place k non-adjacent objects, you need at least one seat between each object. So, you can model this as arranging k objects and (n -k) seats, with the condition that there&#39;s at least one seat between each object. This is equivalent to placing k objects with gaps between them, so the number of ways is C(n -k +1, k). For example, n=7, k=3: C(7-3+1,3)=C(5,3)=10.Therefore, the number of ways to choose three non-adjacent empty seats is 10. Then, the number of seating arrangements is 10*4! =10*24=240.Therefore, the total invalid arrangements are 120 (all three empty adjacent) +240 (all three empty isolated)=360.Therefore, the valid arrangements (exactly two adjacent empty seats) would be total arrangements 840 - invalid 360=480. So, 480. Which matches the answer.So, this approach also gives 480. Therefore, the answer is correct.So, the two different methods both lead to the answer 480, so that&#39;s confirmed.Therefore, the number of different seating arrangements is 480.Final AnswerThe number of different seating arrangements is boxed{480}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the number of different seating arrangements for four students in a row of 7 seats such that there are exactly two adjacent empty seats, we can use the following steps:1. Understanding the problem: We need exactly two adjacent empty seats and one separate empty seat. This means the three empty seats must form a block of two and one single seat not adjacent to the block.2. Counting valid empty seat arrangements:   - Total adjacent pairs: There are 6 possible pairs of adjacent seats in 7 seats (1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7).   - Forbidden seats: For each pair of adjacent seats, we need to ensure the third empty seat is not adjacent to the pair.   - Available seats for the third empty seat:     - For pairs at the ends (1-2 and 6-7), there are 4 available seats each.     - For middle pairs (2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6), there are 3 available seats each.   - Calculating total ways:     - Pairs at the ends: (2 text{ pairs} times 4 text{ seats} = 8)     - Middle pairs: (4 text{ pairs} times 3 text{ seats} = 12)     - Total ways to choose empty seats: (8 + 12 = 20)3. Considering student arrangements: For each valid arrangement of empty seats, the four students can be arranged in (4!) ways.4. Total seating arrangements: Multiply the number of valid empty seat arrangements by the number of student permutations:   [   20 times 4! = 20 times 24 = 480   ]5. Verification using inclusion-exclusion:   - Total arrangements: ( binom{7}{4} times 4! = 35 times 24 = 840 )   - Invalid arrangements:     - All three empty seats adjacent: (5 times 4! = 120)     - All three empty seats isolated: ( binom{5}{3} times 4! = 10 times 24 = 240 )   - Valid arrangements: (840 - 120 - 240 = 480)Thus, the number of different seating arrangements is (boxed{480}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a016c3d6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a016c3d6><span class="icon" data-v-a016c3d6>🔑:</span>We can divide the three empty seats into two groups: one with 2 adjacent seats and one single seat.The number of ways to arrange the four students (without considering the empty seats) is A_4^4 = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24.Next, we insert the two groups of empty seats into the 5 gaps created by the four students, which can be done in A_5^2 = 5 times 4 = 20 ways.Therefore, the total number of different seating arrangements that meet the criteria is 24 times 20 = 480.Hence, the answer is boxed{480}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-d0e2228e data-v-a016c3d6><div class="review" data-v-a016c3d6><div class="review-title" data-v-a016c3d6><span class="icon" data-v-a016c3d6>❓:</span>7. cos frac{pi}{15} cos frac{2 pi}{15} cos frac{3 pi}{15} cdots cos frac{7 pi}{15} The value is qquad</div><div class="divider" data-v-a016c3d6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a016c3d6><span class="icon" data-v-a016c3d6>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of the product cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(3π/15) * ... * cos(7π/15). Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be evaluated using certain trigonometric identities or formulas. Maybe there&#39;s a product formula for multiple angles?Wait, π/15 is 12 degrees, right? Because π radians is 180 degrees, so π/15 is 12 degrees. Then 2π/15 is 24 degrees, 3π/15 is 36 degrees, which is π/5, and so on up to 7π/15, which is 84 degrees. So the product is of cosines of angles increasing by 12 degrees each time from 12 degrees to 84 degrees. Interesting.I recall that there&#39;s a formula for the product of cosines of the form cos(π/(2n+1)) * cos(2π/(2n+1)) * ... * cos(nπ/(2n+1)) which equals 1/(2^n). But in this case, the angles go up to 7π/15, which is less than π/2 (which is 15π/30 or 90 degrees). Wait, 7π/15 is 84 degrees, so it&#39;s still acute. Hmm, maybe this isn&#39;t directly applicable.Alternatively, perhaps using complex numbers? Since products of cosines can sometimes be related to roots of unity. Let me think. If I consider the roots of the equation z^(15) = 1, the roots are e^(2πik/15) for k from 0 to 14. The product of (z - e^(2πik/15)) for k=1 to 14 is z^14 + z^13 + ... + z + 1. Wait, maybe that&#39;s not directly helpful here.Alternatively, I remember that the product of sines or cosines in arithmetic progression can be evaluated using certain formulas. Let me check my memory here. For example, the product sin(π/n) sin(2π/n) ... sin((n-1)π/n) = n/(2^{n-1}). But that&#39;s for sines. For cosines, maybe a similar formula exists?Wait, the problem here is a product of cosines from k=1 to 7 of kπ/15. So 7 terms. Let me list them:cos(π/15), cos(2π/15), cos(3π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(5π/15), cos(6π/15), cos(7π/15).Note that 5π/15 is π/3, which is 60 degrees, and 6π/15 is 2π/5, which is 72 degrees. 7π/15 is 84 degrees.Also, note that cos(π - x) = -cos(x). So for example, cos(7π/15) = cos(π - 8π/15) = -cos(8π/15). Similarly, cos(6π/15) = cos(π - 9π/15) = -cos(9π/15), and cos(5π/15) is cos(π/3) which is 0.5, but 5π/15 is π/3, so cos(π/3) = 1/2. Wait, but 5π/15 is π/3, so maybe that&#39;s a known value. Similarly, 3π/15 is π/5, so cos(π/5) is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2? Wait, actually, cos(π/5) is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2? Wait, let me check. Cos(36 degrees) is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 multiplied by 2. Let me compute cos(π/5):cos(π/5) = cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/2 * 1/2 * 2? Wait, maybe I&#39;m miscalculating. Wait, actually, cos(36°) is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which is (1 + √5)/2 * 1/2 * 2. Hmm, maybe I need to recall the exact value. Let me remember that cos(36°) is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, no. Wait, actually, let me derive it.In a regular pentagon, the cosine of 36 degrees relates to the golden ratio. Let&#39;s recall that cos(36°) = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, actually, using the identity that 2*cos(2π/5) = (√5 - 1)/2, but maybe I need to do a more precise calculation.Alternatively, using the identity for cos(5θ) in terms of cosθ. Let me set θ = π/5, so 5θ = π, so cos(5θ) = cosπ = -1. The expansion of cos(5θ) is 16cos^5θ - 20cos^3θ + 5cosθ. Setting this equal to -1:16x^5 - 20x^3 + 5x + 1 = 0, where x = cos(π/5). Hmm, maybe factor this equation. Let me try x = -1: 16(-1)^5 -20(-1)^3 +5(-1) +1 = -16 +20 -5 +1 = 0. So x +1 is a factor. Dividing the polynomial by x +1:Using polynomial division or synthetic division. Let&#39;s use synthetic division for x = -1:Coefficients: 16, 0, -20, 0, 5, 1Bring down 16.Multiply by -1: -16.Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-16) = -16.Multiply by -1: 16.Add to next coefficient: -20 +16 = -4.Multiply by -1: 4.Add to next coefficient: 0 +4 =4.Multiply by -1: -4.Add to next coefficient:5 + (-4)=1.Multiply by -1: -1.Add to last coefficient:1 + (-1)=0.So the quotient is 16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1.Thus, 16x^5 -20x^3 +5x +1 = (x +1)(16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1). So now, set 16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1=0. Let me divide this equation by x^2 to make it easier: 16x^2 -16x -4 +4/x +1/x^2=0. Let y = x + 1/x. Then x^2 +1/x^2 = y^2 -2. So substituting:16(y^2 - 2) -16y -4 +4*(y) =0.Wait, let&#39;s check:Original equation: 16x^2 -16x -4 +4/x +1/x^2=0Expressed as 16x^2 +1/x^2 -16x +4/x -4 =0.Let y = x - 1/x. Then x^2 +1/x^2 = y^2 + 2, but here we have x^2 +1/x^2 multiplied by 16, and -16x +4/x.Alternatively, maybe let z = x +1/x. Then x^2 +1/x^2 = z^2 -2. But here, the coefficients for x and 1/x are -16x +4/x. Hmm, not sure. Maybe another substitution.Alternatively, multiply through by x^2 to get:16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1=0.Wait, but this quartic equation. Maybe factor it. Let me try to factor 16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1.Looking for rational roots with Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8, ±1/16. Let&#39;s test x=1: 16 -16 -4 +4 +1=1≠0. x=-1: 16 +16 -4 -4 +1=25≠0. x=1/2: 16*(1/16) -16*(1/8) -4*(1/4) +4*(1/2)+1=1 -2 -1 +2 +1=1≠0. x=1/4: 16*(1/256) -16*(1/64) -4*(1/16)+4*(1/4)+1= (1/16) - (1/4) - (1/4) +1 +1= (1/16 -1/4 -1/4) +2= (1/16 - 2/4) +2= (1/16 - 1/2) +2= (-7/16) +2= 25/16≠0. Hmm, no luck. Maybe it&#39;s a quadratic in x^2? Let me check:16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1. Doesn&#39;t seem to be. Alternatively, maybe group terms:(16x^4 -16x^3) + (-4x^2 +4x) +1= 16x^3(x -1) -4x(x -1) +1= (x -1)(16x^3 -4x) +1. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe this equation factors into two quadratics: (ax^2 +bx +c)(dx^2 +ex +f). Let&#39;s suppose a=4, d=4 (since 16=4*4). Then:(4x^2 + bx + c)(4x^2 + ex +f) = 16x^4 + (4e +4b)x^3 + (be +4f +4c)x^2 + (bf + ec)x + cf.Compare to 16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1.So equate coefficients:1. 4e +4b = -16 ⇒ e + b = -4.2. be +4f +4c = -4.3. bf + ec =4.4. cf =1.Possible c and f are 1 and1 or -1 and -1. Since cf=1, so c=1, f=1 or c=-1, f=-1. Let&#39;s try c=1, f=1.Then equation 4 is satisfied. Equation 3: b*1 + e*1 =4 ⇒ b + e=4. But from equation 1: b + e = -4. Contradiction. So discard.Next try c=-1, f=-1. Then equation 4: (-1)(-1)=1, which works. Equation 3: b*(-1) + e*(-1)=4 ⇒ -b -e=4 ⇒ b + e=-4. Which matches equation 1. So equation 1 and 3 are consistent. Now equation 2: be +4*(-1) +4*(-1)= -4 ⇒ be -4 -4 = -4 ⇒ be=4.So we have:From equation 1: b + e = -4.From equation 2: be =4.So solve for b and e. They are roots of t^2 +4t +4=0. The discriminant is 16 -16=0, so t=(-4)/2=-2. So both b and e are -2. So the factors would be (4x^2 -2x -1)(4x^2 -2x -1). Let&#39;s check:(4x^2 -2x -1)^2 =16x^4 -16x^3 +4x^2 +8x^2 + ... Wait, no. Wait, (4x^2 -2x -1)(4x^2 -2x -1) =16x^4 -8x^3 -4x^2 -8x^3 +4x^2 +2x -4x^2 +2x +1= 16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1. Yes! Perfect. So the quartic factors as (4x^2 -2x -1)^2.Therefore, 16x^4 -16x^3 -4x^2 +4x +1=(4x^2 -2x -1)^2.So going back to the equation (4x^2 -2x -1)^2=0. So 4x^2 -2x -1=0. Solving for x:x = [2 ± sqrt(4 +16)]/(8) = [2 ± sqrt(20)]/8 = [2 ± 2sqrt(5)]/8 = [1 ± sqrt(5)]/4.Since x = cos(π/5) must be positive, so we take the positive root: [1 + sqrt(5)]/4. Wait, [1 + sqrt(5)]/4 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 0.809, which is about cos(36°), which is correct. So cos(π/5)= (1 + √5)/4 * 2? Wait, wait: [1 + sqrt(5)]/4 is approximately 0.809/2 ≈0.4045, which is not. Wait, actually, wait. Wait cos(36°) is approx 0.8090, which is [sqrt(5)+1]/4 multiplied by 2. Wait, let&#39;s compute [1 + sqrt(5)]/4 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 3.236/4≈0.809. Yes, so cos(π/5)= (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no: the solution is x = [1 + sqrt(5)]/4 ≈0.809/2≈0.4045? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the quadratic equation was 4x^2 -2x -1=0, so solution x=(2 ± sqrt(4 + 16))/8=(2 ± sqrt(20))/8=(2 ± 2sqrt5)/8=(1 ± sqrt5)/4. Then, since cos(π/5) is positive and approximately 0.809, we take the positive root: (1 + sqrt5)/4≈(1 + 2.236)/4≈3.236/4≈0.809. Yes, so cos(π/5)= (1 + sqrt5)/4≈0.809. Wait, no: (1 + sqrt5)/4≈0.809, which is exactly the value. So cos(36°)= (1 + sqrt5)/4 * 2? Wait, no, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt5)/4 * 2? Wait, no, actually, 0.809 is approximately (sqrt5 +1)/4 * 2. Let me compute (sqrt5 +1)/4 ≈(2.236 +1)/4≈3.236/4≈0.809, so actually, cos(36°)= (sqrt5 +1)/4 * 2? Wait, no, wait:Wait, solving 4x^2 - 2x -1=0, we have x=(1 + sqrt5)/4≈0.809, which is exactly cos(36°). So cos(π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4≈0.809. Wait, but (sqrt5 +1)/4 is approximately (2.236 +1)/4≈3.236/4≈0.809. So yes, cos(π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4. Wait, no, wait: cos(36°)= (sqrt5 +1)/4 * 2?Wait, hold on, sqrt5 is approximately 2.236, so sqrt5 +1≈3.236. Divided by 4, that&#39;s≈0.809. So cos(36°)= (sqrt5 +1)/4≈0.809, which is correct. So that&#39;s settled. Therefore, cos(π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4. Wait, no: (sqrt5 +1)/4 is approximately 0.809, but (sqrt5 +1)/4 is actually (2.236 +1)/4≈3.236/4≈0.809. So yes, cos(36°)= (sqrt5 +1)/4≈0.809. Wait, but actually, cos(36°)= (1 + sqrt5)/4 multiplied by 2? Let me check the exact value. From the quadratic equation, x= [1 + sqrt5]/4≈0.809, which is exactly cos(36°). So that&#39;s correct. So cos(π/5)= [1 + sqrt5]/4. Wait, but [1 + sqrt5]/4 is approximately 0.809, which is correct. So cos(π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4. Wait, but wait, (sqrt5 +1)/4 is approximately 0.809, which is correct. So, okay, so cos(π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4. Wait, no, actually, if we compute (sqrt5 +1)/4, sqrt5≈2.236, so sqrt5 +1≈3.236, divided by 4≈0.809, which is correct. So cos(36°)= (sqrt5 +1)/4≈0.809. Okay, so that&#39;s exact value.Similarly, cos(3π/15)=cos(π/5)= same value. Wait, 3π/15=π/5. So cos(π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4. But wait, 3π/15 is π/5, so that term is cos(π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4. Then 4π/15 is 48°, 5π/15 is π/3, which is 60°, cos(π/3)=1/2. 6π/15=2π/5=72°, and 7π/15=84°.But perhaps instead of computing each term separately, which would be complicated, maybe there&#39;s a product formula. Let me recall that the product of cosines from k=1 to n-1 of cos(kπ/(2n+1)) is 1/2^n. Wait, here we have angles up to 7π/15. Let me check if this is similar.Wait, the formula I remember is for the product of cosines of the form cos(π/(2n+1)) * cos(2π/(2n+1)) * ... * cos(nπ/(2n+1)) = 1/2^n. For example, if n=3, then product is cos(π/7)cos(2π/7)cos(3π/7)=1/8. Similarly, if n=1, cos(π/3)=1/2=1/2^1. So that formula.But in our problem, the angles are π/15, 2π/15,...,7π/15. Note that 7π/15=7π/(15)= (15/2 -0.5)π/15? Wait, not sure. Wait, 15=2*7 +1. Yes, because 2n+1=15 implies n=7. Therefore, according to the formula, the product cos(π/15)cos(2π/15)...cos(7π/15)=1/2^7=1/128.But wait, let me check if the formula applies here. The formula states that for n=7 (since 2n+1=15), the product of cos(π/15)cos(2π/15)...cos(7π/15)=1/2^7=1/128. So that&#39;s the answer? That seems too straightforward. But let me verify.Wait, the formula for the product of cos(kπ/(2n+1)) from k=1 to n is 1/2^n. So if 2n+1=15, then n=7, so the product from k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15)=1/2^7=1/128. Therefore, the answer is 1/128. But let me check with an example. For n=1, 2n+1=3, product cos(π/3)=1/2=1/2^1. Correct. For n=2, 2n+1=5, product cos(π/5)cos(2π/5)= (sqrt5 +1)/4 * (sqrt5 -1)/4= [ (sqrt5 +1)(sqrt5 -1) ] / 16= (5 -1)/16=4/16=1/4=1/2^2. So yes, the formula works here. Similarly, for n=3, 2n+1=7, product cos(π/7)cos(2π/7)cos(3π/7)=1/8=1/2^3. So it seems the formula holds. Therefore, for n=7, product cos(kπ/15) from k=1 to7=1/2^7=1/128. Therefore, the answer is 1/128. Hence, the value is 1/128.But wait, the problem gives the product up to 7π/15, which is exactly the case for 2n+1=15, n=7. Therefore, according to the formula, the product is 1/2^7=1/128. Therefore, the answer is 1/128.But to be thorough, let me check this with a smaller n where I can compute manually. For example, when n=2 (2n+1=5), the product is cos(π/5)cos(2π/5). As we saw earlier, cos(π/5)=(sqrt5 +1)/4≈0.809, and cos(2π/5)=cos(72°)= (sqrt5 -1)/4≈0.309. So multiplying them: (sqrt5 +1)(sqrt5 -1)/16= (5 -1)/16=4/16=1/4=1/2^2, which matches the formula. So the formula works here. Hence, trusting the formula, the answer should be 1/128.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using complex roots. The product can be related to the roots of unity. Let me recall that for the equation z^(2n) -1 =0, the roots are e^(2πik/(2n)) for k=0 to 2n-1. But perhaps using the identity for the product of sines or cosines.Alternatively, recall that the product over k=1 to n-1 of sin(kπ/n) = n/(2^{n-1}). But that&#39;s for sines. For cosines, the formula is similar but different.Alternatively, using the identity that the product of cos(theta_k) for k=1 to n can be expressed as sum over certain terms or via exponentials. But since the formula gives 1/128 for n=7, and our case fits into that, perhaps that&#39;s the way to go.Therefore, after checking with lower n and seeing the formula holds, I can conclude that the value of the product is 1/128.Final AnswerThe value of the product is boxed{dfrac{1}{128}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of the product (cos frac{pi}{15} cos frac{2 pi}{15} cos frac{3 pi}{15} cdots cos frac{7 pi}{15}), we can use a known formula for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression. The formula states that for ( n = 7 ) (since ( 2n + 1 = 15 )), the product of cosines (cos frac{pi}{15} cos frac{2 pi}{15} cos frac{3 pi}{15} cdots cos frac{7 pi}{15}) is given by (frac{1}{2^n}). Here, ( n = 7 ), so the product is (frac{1}{2^7} = frac{1}{128}).Thus, the value of the product is (boxed{dfrac{1}{128}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of the product: cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(3π/15) * ... * cos(7π/15). Hmm, that&#39;s seven cosine terms multiplied together. Let me start by writing out all the terms explicitly. First, let&#39;s note that 3π/15 simplifies to π/5, and similarly, 5π/15 is π/3, 6π/15 is 2π/5, and 7π/15 is 7π/15. So, the angles in the cosines are π/15, 2π/15, π/5, 4π/15, π/3, 2π/5, and 7π/15. I remember that there are product formulas for multiple cosine terms, especially those related to roots of unity or using complex numbers. Alternatively, maybe using properties of cosine products, like pairing terms or using product-to-sum identities. But with seven terms, that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a symmetry here. The angles go from π/15 up to 7π/15. Since cos(θ) = cos(π - θ), let me check if these angles can be paired in some way. For example, cos(7π/15) = cos(π - 8π/15) = cos(7π/15) [Wait, π is 15π/15, so π - 7π/15 is 8π/15. So, cos(7π/15) = cos(8π/15). But 8π/15 isn&#39;t in our list. Hmm. Similarly, cos(6π/15) = cos(2π/5) = cos(π - 3π/5) = cos(2π/5). Not sure if that helps.Wait, let me list all the angles again:1. π/15 ≈ 12°2. 2π/15 ≈ 24°3. 3π/15 = π/5 ≈ 36°4. 4π/15 ≈ 48°5. 5π/15 = π/3 ≈ 60°6. 6π/15 = 2π/5 ≈ 72°7. 7π/15 ≈ 84°So, the angles go from 12° up to 84°, in increments of 12°, except between π/5 and 4π/15 which is 12° as well. Wait, actually, 3π/15 is π/5, which is 36°, then 4π/15 is 48°, so each step is 12°, which is π/15. So, the product is cos(kπ/15) for k = 1 to 7.So, actually, the product is from k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15). Hmm.I recall that there&#39;s a formula for the product of cosines of the form cos(π/(2n+1)) * cos(3π/(2n+1)) * ... * cos((2n-1)π/(2n+1)) = 1/2^n. But here, our product isn&#39;t exactly like that. Here, we have consecutive k&#39;s from 1 to 7 multiplied by π/15. Let me check if there&#39;s a general formula for the product of cos(kπ/N) from k=1 to n.Wait, maybe another approach. Consider the roots of unity. The roots of the equation z^{15} - 1 = 0 are e^{2πik/15} for k = 0 to 14. Then, we can factor z^{15} - 1 into cyclotomic polynomials. But I&#39;m not sure how that directly relates to the product of cosines. However, perhaps using the identity that relates the product of sines or cosines over certain angles to values involving roots of unity.Alternatively, recall that for real numbers, the product of cosines can sometimes be expressed in terms of sine products. For example, using the identity sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. Maybe multiplying numerator and denominator by appropriate sine terms to create telescoping products.Wait, here&#39;s a method I remember: if you have a product of cosines, you can use the formula that involves multiplying both numerator and denominator by a power of 2 and some sines to create a telescoping product.Alternatively, consider that the product of cos(kπ/15) from k=1 to 7 can be related to the real parts of the roots of unity. But perhaps that&#39;s too vague.Alternatively, note that 15 is an odd number, so 15 = 2*7 +1. Wait, 2*7 +1 is 15? 2*7=14 +1=15. Yes. So, that might be relevant. There is a formula for the product of cosines of the form cos(π/(2n+1)) up to cos(nπ/(2n+1)) which equals 1/2^n. For example, when n=1, 2n+1=3, product is cos(π/3) = 1/2, which is 1/2^1. For n=2, product is cos(π/5)cos(2π/5) = 1/4, which is 1/2^2. For n=3, product is cos(π/7)cos(3π/7)cos(5π/7)=1/8, etc. So, in general, the product of cos((2k-1)π/(2n+1)) for k=1 to n is 1/2^n.But in our problem, the product is from k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15). So, k=1 to 7, and 2n+1=15, which would mean n=7. Wait, but according to the formula above, when n=7, the product would be cos(π/15)cos(3π/15)...cos(13π/15). But in our case, the product is consecutive terms from k=1 to 7, which would include both even and odd multiples. So, perhaps not directly applicable. But maybe we can adjust it.Wait, let&#39;s see. Let me try to write the product as:Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15) = [Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15)].But note that 15 is 2*7 +1. So, the formula for the product of cos((2k-1)π/(2n+1)) for k=1 to n is 1/2^n. Here, n=7, so Product_{k=1}^7 cos((2k-1)π/15) = 1/2^7. However, our product includes all k=1 to 7, which includes both odd and even multiples. So, perhaps if we can separate the product into even and odd terms?Wait, let&#39;s see: For k from 1 to 7, we have:k=1: π/15 (odd multiple)k=2: 2π/15 (even multiple)k=3: 3π/15 = π/5 (odd multiple)k=4: 4π/15 (even multiple)k=5: 5π/15 = π/3 (odd multiple)k=6: 6π/15 = 2π/5 (even multiple)k=7: 7π/15 (odd multiple)So, the product can be separated into two products: one over odd multiples and one over even multiples:Product_{odd k=1,3,5,7} cos(kπ/15) * Product_{even k=2,4,6} cos(kπ/15)So, first product is cos(π/15) * cos(3π/15) * cos(5π/15) * cos(7π/15)Second product is cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(6π/15)Now, the first product is the product of cos((2m-1)π/15) for m=1 to 4 (wait, but 1,3,5,7: four terms). However, according to the formula, when n=7, Product_{k=1}^7 cos((2k-1)π/15) = 1/2^7. But here, we have only the first four odd terms? Wait, no. Wait, the formula would be for k=1 to 7, the product of cos((2k-1)π/15) would be 1/2^7. But in our case, in the original product, the odd terms are k=1,3,5,7. Wait, 2k-1 where k=1 to 7 would give 1,3,5,7,9,11,13. But we only have k=1,3,5,7 in the first product, which correspond to 1,3,5,7. Then 9,11,13 would correspond to angles 9π/15, 11π/15, 13π/15. However, cos(9π/15) = cos(3π/5), which is equal to cos(π - 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5). Similarly, cos(11π/15) = cos(π - 4π/15) = -cos(4π/15), and cos(13π/15) = cos(π - 2π/15) = -cos(2π/15). So, the product of cos((2k-1)π/15) from k=1 to 7 would be [Product_{k=1}^7 cos((2k-1)π/15)] = [cos(π/15)cos(3π/15)cos(5π/15)cos(7π/15)cos(9π/15)cos(11π/15)cos(13π/15)].But since cos(9π/15) = -cos(2π/5), cos(11π/15) = -cos(4π/15), cos(13π/15) = -cos(2π/15). Therefore, the product becomes:[cos(π/15)cos(3π/15)cos(5π/15)cos(7π/15)] * [-cos(2π/5)][-cos(4π/15)][-cos(2π/15)].Which simplifies to:[cos(π/15)cos(3π/15)cos(5π/15)cos(7π/15)] * (-1)^3 [cos(2π/15)cos(4π/15)cos(2π/5)].Therefore, the product of the seven terms cos((2k-1)π/15) from k=1 to 7 is equal to - [cos(π/15)cos(3π/15)cos(5π/15)cos(7π/15)cos(2π/15)cos(4π/15)cos(2π/5)].But according to the formula, this product is 1/2^7. Therefore,- [Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15)] = 1/2^7Wait, because the original product (from k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15)) includes all the terms cos(π/15) up to cos(7π/15). But in our case, the product over the seven odd angles (as per 2k-1) is equal to -1 times the product over k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15). Therefore,- [Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15)] = 1/2^7Therefore,Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15) = -1/2^7.But wait, the formula states that the product of cos((2k-1)π/(2n+1)) from k=1 to n is 1/2^n. In our case, n=7, so the product of cos((2k-1)π/15) from k=1 to 7 is 1/2^7. However, we saw that this product is equal to - [Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15)]. Therefore,- [Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15)] = 1/2^7Thus,Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15) = -1/128.But wait, cosine is positive in the first quadrant (angles between 0 and π/2). All our angles are between 0 and 7π/15 ≈ 84°, which is less than π/2 (90°). Wait, 7π/15 is approximately 84°, so it&#39;s still in the first quadrant, where cosine is positive. Therefore, the product of positive numbers should be positive. But according to this, we get -1/128. That&#39;s a contradiction. So, where did I go wrong?Ah, let me check the steps again. Let me retrace:1. The formula says that Product_{k=1}^n cos((2k-1)π/(2n+1)) = 1/2^n. For n=7, this would be Product_{k=1}^7 cos((2k-1)π/15) = 1/2^7. 2. However, the product Product_{k=1}^7 cos((2k-1)π/15) is equal to:cos(π/15) * cos(3π/15) * cos(5π/15) * cos(7π/15) * cos(9π/15) * cos(11π/15) * cos(13π/15)3. Now, angles beyond π/2 (which is 7.5π/15 or 15π/30) start at 9π/15 (which is 3π/5 or 108°). Wait, 9π/15 is 3π/5, which is 108°, so that&#39;s in the second quadrant. Similarly, 11π/15 is 132°, 13π/15 is 156°, which are also in the second quadrant. So, cosines of these angles are negative. Therefore, cos(9π/15) = cos(3π/5) = negative, cos(11π/15) = negative, cos(13π/15) = negative. So, in the product, three negative terms. Therefore, the total product would be negative. But according to the formula, it&#39;s 1/2^7 which is positive. Therefore, there must be an absolute value or something missing?Wait, hold on. Let me compute the actual numerical values. Let&#39;s take n=7, so the formula claims that:Product_{k=1}^7 cos((2k-1)π/15) = 1/2^7 ≈ 0.0078125But let&#39;s compute the product step by step:cos(π/15) ≈ 0.9781cos(3π/15) = cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090cos(5π/15) = cos(π/3) = 0.5cos(7π/15) ≈ 0.6691cos(9π/15) = cos(3π/5) ≈ -0.3090cos(11π/15) ≈ -0.9135cos(13π/15) ≈ -0.9781Multiplying all these together:0.9781 * 0.8090 ≈ 0.79120.7912 * 0.5 ≈ 0.39560.3956 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.26480.2648 * (-0.3090) ≈ -0.0818-0.0818 * (-0.9135) ≈ 0.07470.0747 * (-0.9781) ≈ -0.0731So, the product is approximately -0.0731, which is approximately -1/13.67, not 1/128 ≈ 0.0078125. Therefore, the formula must not apply here as I thought. Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again.Wait, the formula I recall is for the product of cosines of the form cos(π/(2n + 1)), cos(3π/(2n + 1)), ..., cos((2n - 1)π/(2n + 1))). For example, when n=1, product is cos(π/3) = 1/2. When n=2, product is cos(π/5)cos(3π/5) = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * (sqrt(5)-1)/4 = 1/4. Wait, but actually, cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090, cos(3π/5) ≈ -0.3090, product is ≈ -0.25. But the formula says 1/2^n = 1/4. So, it&#39;s actually the absolute value? Wait, in the case of n=2, the formula gives 1/4, but the actual product is negative. Hmm, maybe the formula is considering magnitudes. Therefore, perhaps the formula is Product_{k=1}^n |cos((2k -1)π/(2n +1))| = 1/2^n. Then, in that case, our previous computation had magnitude approximately 0.0731, which is not 1/128≈0.0078125. So, perhaps the formula is different.Wait, maybe my memory is faulty. Let me check.Alternatively, perhaps the formula applies when the angles are in the first quadrant. However, in our case, when n=7, 2n+1=15, the angles (2k-1)π/15 for k=1 to 7 are π/15, 3π/15, 5π/15, 7π/15, 9π/15, 11π/15, 13π/15. The angles beyond 7π/15 (which is less than π/2) are in the second quadrant. So, perhaps the formula does not apply here because some of the cosines are negative. Therefore, the formula might be considering the product of their absolute values. Then, the product of |cos((2k -1)π/(2n +1))| for k=1 to n is 1/2^n. Therefore, in that case, the actual product (with signs) would be (-1)^{number of terms in second quadrant} * 1/2^n. In our case, angles greater than π/2 are 9π/15, 11π/15, 13π/15. That&#39;s three angles. So, their cosines are negative, so three negative terms. So, the product would be (-1)^3 * 1/2^7 = -1/128. However, when I computed the numerical value earlier, I got approximately -0.0731, which is approximately -1/13.67, not -1/128≈-0.0078125. So, there&#39;s a discrepancy here. Therefore, my initial assumption about the formula must be incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the formula applies when n is the number of angles in the first quadrant. Wait, let me check references in my mind.Wait, here&#39;s another approach. There is a formula for the product of sines: Product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}}. But we have cosines here. Maybe there&#39;s a similar formula for cosines.Alternatively, use complex numbers. Let me recall that the product of cos(kπ/n) for k=1 to m can sometimes be related to the real parts of the roots of a certain polynomial.Alternatively, consider using multiple-angle identities. Let&#39;s think about the Chebyshev polynomials. The product of cosines might relate to the evaluation of a Chebyshev polynomial at a certain point.Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that sin(15θ) can be expressed as a product involving sines or cosines. But I need to find a connection.Alternatively, consider that the product we want is related to the real parts of the 30th roots of unity, but I might be overcomplicating.Wait, here&#39;s an idea: use the identity that the product of cos(θ_k) can be written in terms of the sum of angles, but that might not directly help.Alternatively, use logarithms: take the logarithm of the product, which becomes the sum of the logs of the cosines, and then try to evaluate that sum. But integrating or summing logs of cosines can be tricky.Alternatively, consider that 15 is 3*5. Maybe break the problem down using properties of 3 and 5.Alternatively, use the identity that cos(π - x) = -cos(x). Let&#39;s see. For example, cos(7π/15) = cos(π - 8π/15) = -cos(8π/15). Similarly, cos(6π/15) = cos(2π/5) = cos(72°), cos(4π/15) = cos(48°), cos(2π/15) = cos(24°), etc. So, perhaps express some terms as negative cosines of other angles.Wait, but the product is from k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15). Let me pair terms symmetrically. For example, cos(π/15) and cos(7π/15); cos(2π/15) and cos(6π/15); cos(3π/15) and cos(5π/15); and the middle term is cos(4π/15). Wait, but 7π/15 is paired with π/15? Wait:Wait, cos(7π/15) = cos(π - 8π/15) = -cos(8π/15). Similarly, cos(6π/15) = cos(2π/5) = cos(72°), cos(5π/15) = cos(π/3) = 0.5, cos(4π/15) is as is, etc.Alternatively, perhaps use the identity:cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2But multiplying seven terms would require applying this multiple times, which might be too cumbersome. However, maybe proceed step by step.Alternatively, recall that the product of cosines can be expressed as a sum. But this might not be helpful for a seven-term product.Alternatively, use the formula for the product of multiple cosines in terms of sines:Product_{k=1}^n cos(θ_k) = 1/2^{n-1}} Σ ... (sum over certain combinations). But this seems complicated for n=7.Wait, here&#39;s another approach: Use the identity that relates the product of cosines to the determinant of a certain matrix or to a Fourier transform. Probably not helpful.Alternatively, use induction or recursion. Suppose I know the product up to n terms and relate it to n+1 terms, but not sure.Wait, here&#39;s a different idea: use the identity that sin(2^n θ) = 2^n sinθ cosθ cos2θ cos4θ ... cos2^{n-1}θ. But this is for angles doubling each time. Not sure if applicable here.Alternatively, note that the product is from k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15). Let&#39;s note that 15 is the denominator. Let me consider writing this product as:Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15) = Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15)Let me check the product formula for cosines in arithmetic progression.I found a formula online once that says:Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd) = (2 sin(d/2))^{-n} Σ ... )But I can&#39;t recall the exact formula. Maybe that&#39;s not helpful here.Alternatively, use the identity that relates the product of sines or cosines to the sum of angles.Wait, here&#39;s a thought. Let me consider the complex exponential form. The product of cos(kπ/15) for k=1 to 7 can be written as the product of (e^{ikπ/15} + e^{-ikπ/15}) / 2. Therefore, the product is 1 / 2^7 times the product of (e^{ikπ/15} + e^{-ikπ/15}) from k=1 to 7.Expanding this product would give a sum of terms of the form e^{iπ/15 Σ ±k} where each ±k is either +k or -k. But this seems too complicated.However, maybe note that the product is related to the roots of the equation z^{30} = 1, since each term e^{ikπ/15} is a 30th root of unity. Wait, because e^{ikπ/15} = e^{i2kπ/30}, so these are 30th roots of unity. So, the product is 1/2^7 times the product of (z^k + z^{-k}) where z = e^{iπ/15} and k=1 to 7.But z^k + z^{-k} = 2 cos(kπ/15). So, the product is 1 / 2^7 times the product of (z^k + z^{-k}) from k=1 to 7.But perhaps factoring this product. Let me note that z^{15} = e^{i15π/15} = e^{iπ} = -1. Similarly, z^{30}=1. So, z is a primitive 30th root of unity.Therefore, the product over (z^k + z^{-k}) is the same as the product over (z^k + z^{30 -k}) because z^{-k} = z^{30 -k}. So, maybe the product can be related to the minimal polynomial of z over the reals. Since z is a primitive 30th root of unity, its minimal polynomial is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_{30}(x). But Φ_{30}(x) is of degree φ(30) = φ(2*3*5) = 30*(1-1/2)*(1-1/3)*(1-1/5) = 30*1/2*2/3*4/5 = 8. So, degree 8. Hmm. But maybe not helpful.Alternatively, note that (z^k + z^{-k}) = 2 cos(kπ/15). Therefore, the product is 1/2^7 times the product of 2 cos(kπ/15) from k=1 to 7. Wait, that would be redundant because we already have that. Hmm.Alternatively, consider that the product of (z^k + z^{-k}) from k=1 to 7 is equal to some expression involving z. But I need to find a better way.Alternatively, note that (z^k + z^{-k}) = (z^{2k} + 1)/z^k. So, the product becomes Product_{k=1}^7 (z^{2k} + 1)/z^k = (Product_{k=1}^7 (z^{2k} + 1)) / z^{Σk=1^7 k}.The denominator is z^{28}, since Σk=1^7 k = 28. The numerator is Product_{k=1}^7 (z^{2k} + 1). So, the entire expression is [Product_{k=1}^7 (z^{2k} +1)] / z^{28}.But z^{30} =1, so z^{28} = z^{-2}. Therefore, the expression is [Product_{k=1}^7 (z^{2k} +1)] * z^{2}.But z^{2k} cycles through even exponents modulo 30. Let&#39;s compute the exponents:For k=1: 2*1=2k=2: 4k=3:6k=4:8k=5:10k=6:12k=7:14So, the product is (z^2 +1)(z^4 +1)(z^6 +1)(z^8 +1)(z^{10} +1)(z^{12} +1)(z^{14} +1).But note that z^{10} = e^{i10π/15} = e^{i2π/3} = -1/2 + i√3/2. But z^{10} +1 = (-1/2 +1) + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2. Similarly, z^{14} = e^{i14π/15} = e^{i(π - π/15)} = -e^{-iπ/15}, so z^{14} +1 = 1 - e^{-iπ/15}.Not sure if this helps. Maybe pairing terms:(z^2 +1)(z^{28} +1) since z^{28} = z^{-2}, so (z^2 +1)(z^{-2} +1) = 2 + z^2 + z^{-2}But this seems messy. Alternatively, note that z^{2k} +1 = 0 when z^{2k} = -1. The roots of z^{2k} +1 =0 are the odd multiples of π/(2k). Not sure.Alternatively, notice that z is a primitive 30th root of unity, so z^30=1. Then, the product (z^{2k} +1). But maybe relate this product to cyclotomic polynomials.But this seems too vague. Maybe it&#39;s better to abandon this approach.Wait, returning to the original problem. The user asks for the product of cos(kπ/15) from k=1 to 7. Let me recall that for certain products, especially ones that are symmetric around π/2, the product can be simplified. However, in this case, the angles go up to 7π/15, which is less than π/2 (which is 15π/30= π/2, so 7π/15=14π/30, so close to π/2). So, they&#39;re all in the first quadrant, but not symmetric.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s a reflection formula. Let me pair the terms:cos(π/15) and cos(7π/15)cos(2π/15) and cos(6π/15)=cos(2π/5)cos(3π/15)=cos(π/5) and cos(5π/15)=cos(π/3)and the middle term is cos(4π/15)So, let me compute each pair:First pair: cos(π/15) * cos(7π/15)Second pair: cos(2π/15) * cos(6π/15)Third pair: cos(3π/15) * cos(5π/15)Middle term: cos(4π/15)Let me compute each pair.First pair: cos(π/15) * cos(7π/15). Using the product-to-sum identity:cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2So, cos(π/15)cos(7π/15) = [cos(8π/15) + cos(-6π/15)] / 2 = [cos(8π/15) + cos(6π/15)] / 2Similarly, second pair: cos(2π/15)cos(6π/15) = [cos(8π/15) + cos(-4π/15)] / 2 = [cos(8π/15) + cos(4π/15)] / 2Third pair: cos(3π/15)cos(5π/15) = cos(π/5)cos(π/3) = [cos(8π/15) + cos(2π/15)] / 2Middle term: cos(4π/15)So, putting this all together:Product = [ ( [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2 ) * ( [cos8π/15 + cos4π/15]/2 ) * ( [cos8π/15 + cos2π/15]/2 ) * cos4π/15 ]Hmm, this seems to be getting more complicated. Let me compute each step.First pair: [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2Second pair: [cos8π/15 + cos4π/15]/2Third pair: [cos8π/15 + cos2π/15]/2Then multiply all these together along with the middle term cos4π/15.This seems quite involved. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern here. Let&#39;s denote C8 = cos8π/15, C6 = cos6π/15, C4 = cos4π/15, C2 = cos2π/15. Then:Product = [ (C8 + C6)/2 * (C8 + C4)/2 * (C8 + C2)/2 ] * C4Expanding this would require multiplying three binomials. Let&#39;s see:First, multiply (C8 + C6)(C8 + C4) = C8^2 + C8C4 + C8C6 + C6C4Then multiply this by (C8 + C2):= [C8^2 + C8C4 + C8C6 + C6C4] * (C8 + C2)= C8^3 + C8^2 C2 + C8^2 C4 + C8C4C2 + C8^2 C6 + C8C6C2 + C8C6C4 + C6C4C2Then multiply by C4 and divide by 8 (from the three factors of 1/2):Product = [C8^3 + C8^2 C2 + C8^2 C4 + C8C4C2 + C8^2 C6 + C8C6C2 + C8C6C4 + C6C4C2] * C4 / 8This is getting extremely complicated. Perhaps this is not the right path. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter substitution or identity.Alternatively, let&#39;s recall that 8π/15 = π - 7π/15, so cos8π/15 = -cos7π/15. Similarly, 6π/15 = 2π/5, which is already in the product. Similarly, 4π/15 is in the product, and 2π/15 is also in the product.But not sure. Alternatively, use exact values for the cosines.Alternatively, remember that cos(π/3) = 1/2, which is one of the terms. Let me note that in the original product, we have cos(5π/15) = cos(π/3) = 1/2. So, perhaps factor that out.Original product: cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(π/5) * cos(4π/15) * (1/2) * cos(2π/5) * cos(7π/15)So, the product is (1/2) times [cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(π/5) * cos(4π/15) * cos(2π/5) * cos(7π/15)]Still, six terms left. Maybe group them into pairs:cos(π/15) * cos(7π/15) = [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2 (as before)cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) = [cos6π/15 + cos2π/15]/2cos(π/5) * cos(2π/5) = [cos3π/5 + cosπ/5]/2 = [cos(108°) + cos(36°)]/2But even then, this is still complicated. Let me compute each pair step by step.First pair: cos(π/15) * cos(7π/15) = [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2Second pair: cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) = [cos6π/15 + cos2π/15]/2Third pair: cos(π/5) * cos(2π/5) = [cos3π/5 + cosπ/5]/2Then, multiply these three results together and multiply by the remaining term (1/2) and the sixth term cos(7π/15) was already paired.Wait, no. Wait, after pairing:We have:( [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2 ) * ( [cos6π/15 + cos2π/15]/2 ) * ( [cos3π/5 + cosπ/5]/2 ) * (1/2)But cos3π/5 = cos108°, which is equal to -cos72°, and cosπ/5 = cos36°. So, [cos3π/5 + cosπ/5] = [ -cos72° + cos36° ].But cos36° - cos72° is known? Let me compute:cos36° ≈ 0.8090, cos72° ≈ 0.3090, so cos36° - cos72° ≈ 0.5. Exactly, in fact. Let&#39;s check:cos36° = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2? Wait, no. Let&#39;s recall exact values:cos36° = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, actually, cos36° = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (and do) have exact expressions. Wait, cos36° is equal to (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2. Wait, no. Let&#39;s recall that cos36° = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 1/2? Wait, perhaps better to use exact values.We know that cos36° = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, more accurately, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2. Let me recall that cos(36°) = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 0.5. No, actually, here&#39;s the exact value:cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2. Wait, but (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 is approximately (2.236 + 1)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809, which matches the approximate value. So, cos36° = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 0.5. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s look it up properly.Actually, cos(36°) is equal to (1 + sqrt(5))/4 × 2, which equals (1 + sqrt(5))/2 × 0.5. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let&#39;s use the identity that cos(36°) = sin(54°), and from the formula for regular pentagons, we know that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 × 2. However, to avoid confusion, let&#39;s just note that cos36° - cos72° = ?Let me compute cos36° - cos72°:cos36° - cos72° = Using the identity cos A - cos B = -2 sin[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]So, A=36°, B=72°, so (A+B)/2=54°, (A-B)/2= -18°. Therefore:cos36° - cos72° = -2 sin54° sin(-18°) = 2 sin54° sin18°Since sin(-18°)= -sin18°, so the negatives cancel.Now, sin54° = cos36°, and sin18° is known. Let&#39;s compute this:2 sin54° sin18° = 2 cos36° sin18°We can use the identity sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ. Let&#39;s see:But 2 cos36° sin18° = sin(36° + 18°) + sin(-18° + 36°) ? Wait, no. The identity is 2 sinA cosB = sin(A+B) + sin(A-B). So:2 cos36° sin18° = sin(18° + 36°) + sin(18° - 36°) = sin54° + sin(-18°) = sin54° - sin18°But we have 2 cos36° sin18° = sin54° - sin18°. Hmm, but that brings us back. Let me compute sin54° - sin18°:sin54° - sin18° = Using the identity sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]So, A=54°, B=18°, so (A+B)/2=36°, (A-B)/2=18°, so:sin54° - sin18° = 2 cos36° sin18°Which brings us back. Therefore, this is circular.Alternatively, use exact values:sin54° = cos36° = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 ≈ 0.8090 * 2 ≈ 1.618/2 ≈ 0.8090Wait, no. Let&#39;s recall that sin54° = cos36° = [sqrt(5)+1]/4 * 2, but I need to look up exact values.Actually, sin54° = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5)+1)/2. Wait:sin54° = sin(3π/10) = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 0.5. Hmm, perhaps it&#39;s better to use exact decimal values:sin54° ≈ 0.8090sin18° ≈ 0.3090Thus, 2 * 0.8090 * 0.3090 ≈ 2 * 0.250 ≈ 0.5. Indeed, 0.8090 - 0.3090 = 0.5. Therefore, cos36° - cos72° = 0.5Therefore, [cos3π/5 + cosπ/5] = [ -cos72° + cos36° ] = cos36° - cos72° = 0.5So, the third pair simplifies to 0.5 / 2 = 0.25Now, back to the product:Product = [ (cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)/2 * (cos6π/15 + cos2π/15)/2 * 0.25 ] * 0.5Wait, let&#39;s step back.First pair: [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2Second pair: [cos6π/15 + cos2π/15]/2Third pair: [cos3π/5 + cosπ/5]/2 = 0.5/2 = 0.25Middle term: already included? Wait, the original product after factoring out 1/2 was:(1/2) * [cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) * cos(π/5) * cos(4π/15) * cos(2π/5) * cos(7π/15)]Which we grouped into three pairs:1. cos(π/15) * cos(7π/15) = [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/22. cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) = [cos6π/15 + cos2π/15]/23. cos(π/5) * cos(2π/5) = [cos3π/5 + cosπ/5]/2 = 0.25Then, the product becomes:(1/2) * [ (pair1) * (pair2) * (pair3) ]= (1/2) * [ ([cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2) * ([cos6π/15 + cos2π/15]/2) * (0.25) ]= (1/2) * [ ( (cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)(cos6π/15 + cos2π/15) ) / 4 * 0.25 ]= (1/2) * [ ( (cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)(cos6π/15 + cos2π/15) ) / 16 ]Wait, no:Wait, (pair1) * (pair2) * (pair3) = ( [cos8π/15 + cos6π/15]/2 ) * ( [cos6π/15 + cos2π/15]/2 ) * (0.25 )= (cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)(cos6π/15 + cos2π/15) * 0.25 / 4= (cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)(cos6π/15 + cos2π/15) * 1/16Then multiplied by the initial (1/2):Total product = (1/2) * (1/16) * (cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)(cos6π/15 + cos2π/15)= (1/32) * (cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)(cos6π/15 + cos2π/15)Now, expand the product:(cos8π/15 + cos6π/15)(cos6π/15 + cos2π/15) = cos8π/15 cos6π/15 + cos8π/15 cos2π/15 + cos6π/15 cos6π/15 + cos6π/15 cos2π/15Compute each term:1. cos8π/15 cos6π/15 = [cos14π/15 + cos2π/15]/22. cos8π/15 cos2π/15 = [cos10π/15 + cos6π/15]/2 = [cos2π/3 + cos6π/15]/23. cos6π/15 cos6π/15 = cos²6π/154. cos6π/15 cos2π/15 = [cos8π/15 + cos4π/15]/2Therefore, expanding all:= [cos14π/15 + cos2π/15]/2 + [cos2π/3 + cos6π/15]/2 + cos²6π/15 + [cos8π/15 + cos4π/15]/2Simplify each term:1. cos14π/15 = cos(π - π/15) = -cosπ/152. cos2π/15 remains as is.3. cos2π/3 = -1/24. cos6π/15 = cos2π/55. cos²6π/15 = cos²2π/56. cos8π/15 = cos8π/157. cos4π/15 = cos4π/15So, substituting:= [ -cosπ/15 + cos2π/15 ] / 2 + [ -1/2 + cos2π/5 ] / 2 + cos²2π/5 + [ cos8π/15 + cos4π/15 ] / 2Now, combining all terms:= (-cosπ/15 + cos2π/15 - 1/2 + cos2π/5)/2 + cos²2π/5 + (cos8π/15 + cos4π/15)/2This is getting really messy. I think I need to abandon this approach and look for a different method.Wait, going back to the original product, maybe use logarithms to approximate the value and see if it&#39;s a simple fraction. But the problem likely expects an exact value, probably a simple fraction like 1/128 or something. Given that earlier attempts pointed to -1/128, but that contradicts the positivity. However, since all terms are positive, the product must be positive. So, perhaps 1/128.But wait, when I computed numerically earlier, the product was approximately 0.0731, which is roughly 1/13.67, not 1/128. But 1/128 is approximately 0.0078125. So, there&#39;s a discrepancy. Therefore, my earlier approach must have an error.Wait, perhaps the formula I recalled was incorrect. Let me check the formula again.According to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the product formula for cosines in arithmetic progression is a known result but can be complex. However, for specific cases, particularly when the angles are related to roots of unity, there might be simplifications.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach inspired by Fourier transforms or Vieta&#39;s formula.Consider the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, T_n(x), which has roots at cos((2k-1)π/(2n)) for k=1 to n. However, I&#39;m not sure if this directly applies.Alternatively, consider that the product of cos(kπ/N) for k=1 to n can be related to the determinant of a certain matrix, but I need a more concrete idea.Wait, here&#39;s a breakthrough. In the paper &quot;Products of Cosines&quot; by some authors, it is mentioned that the product of cos(kπ/(2n+1)) for k=1 to n is 1/2^n. But wait, that&#39;s the same formula I mentioned before. But in our problem, the product is from k=1 to 7 of cos(kπ/15). 2n+1=15 implies n=7. But according to the formula, the product of cos(kπ/(2n+1)) for k=1 to n is 1/2^n. However, in our case, it&#39;s Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15). But in the formula, it&#39;s Product_{k=1}^n cos(kπ/(2n+1)) = 1/2^n. For n=7, this would be Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15) = 1/2^7 = 1/128.But wait, that contradicts the numerical calculation earlier where the product was approximately 0.0731. But 1/128 is approximately 0.0078125. So, there&#39;s a factor of 10 difference. That suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or my understanding of the formula is incorrect.Wait, no, wait. Let me check. If the formula is Product_{k=1}^n cos(kπ/(2n+1)) = 1/2^n. For n=1: Product_{k=1}^1 cos(π/3) = 1/2. Correct.For n=2: Product_{k=1}^2 cos(π/5)cos(2π/5) = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * (sqrt(5)-1)/4 = (5 -1)/16 = 1/4. Yes, indeed, 1/2^2.For n=3: Product_{k=1}^3 cos(π/7)cos(2π/7)cos(3π/7) = 1/8. Yes, correct.So, for n=7, Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15) should be 1/128. However, when I computed numerically, I got approximately 0.0731, which is roughly 1/13.67, not 1/128.Ah, but wait! Wait, in the formula, it&#39;s Product_{k=1}^n cos(kπ/(2n+1)), which for n=7 is Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15). So, exactly our product! Therefore, according to the formula, the answer should be 1/128. But my numerical calculation gave approximately -0.0731. Wait, why the discrepancy?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation. Let me recheck.Compute the product of cos(kπ/15) for k=1 to 7:1. cos(π/15) ≈ 0.97814762. cos(2π/15) ≈ 0.9135454573. cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090169944. cos(4π/15) ≈ 0.6691306065. cos(π/3) = 0.56. cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090169947. cos(7π/15) ≈ 0.669130606 (wait, cos(7π/15 is 7π/15 ≈ 1.466 radians ≈ 84 degrees, cos(84°) ≈ 0.104528463. Wait, wait, this is a mistake! Earlier when I computed cos(7π/15), I must have miscalculated.Wait, cos(7π/15) is cos(84°), which is approximately 0.104528463. Not 0.6691. Wait, 0.6691 is cos(48°), which is 4π/15.Yes, so:1. cos(π/15) ≈ 0.97814762. cos(2π/15) ≈ 0.9135454573. cos(3π/15)=cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090169944. cos(4π/15) ≈ 0.6691306065. cos(5π/15)=cos(π/3)=0.56. cos(6π/15)=cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090169947. cos(7π/15)=cos(84°)=≈0.104528463Now, compute the product:0.9781476 * 0.913545457 ≈ 0.9781 * 0.9135 ≈ 0.9781 * 0.9 = 0.88029, 0.9781 * 0.013545457 ≈ ~0.01325, total≈0.8935Next multiply by 0.809016994: 0.8935 * 0.8090 ≈ 0.723Multiply by 0.669130606: 0.723 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.483Multiply by 0.5: 0.483 * 0.5 = 0.2415Multiply by 0.309016994: 0.2415 * 0.3090 ≈ 0.0746Multiply by 0.104528463: 0.0746 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.0078Which is approximately 0.0078125, which is exactly 1/128.But earlier I must have mistakenly used cos(7π/15) as 0.6691 instead of 0.1045. That was the error. Therefore, the correct product is approximately 1/128, which matches the formula.Therefore, the answer is 1/128. However, earlier when we derived using the formula, we thought it was -1/128, but the actual product is positive. So, the formula must actually give the absolute value, or perhaps the sign is positive.In our previous derivation, we assumed that Product_{k=1}^7 cos((2k-1)π/15) = 1/2^7, but when we expanded, we saw that it was equal to -Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15). However, since the product is positive, then Product_{k=1}^7 cos(kπ/15) = 1/128.Therefore, the correct answer is 1/128.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{1}{128}}&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of the product (cos frac{pi}{15} cos frac{2 pi}{15} cos frac{3 pi}{15} cdots cos frac{7 pi}{15}), we use the known formula for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression. The formula states that for (n) angles, the product of (cosleft(frac{kpi}{2n+1}right)) for (k = 1) to (n) is (frac{1}{2^n}). Here, we have (2n + 1 = 15), which implies (n = 7). Therefore, the product of (cosleft(frac{kpi}{15}right)) for (k = 1) to (7) is (frac{1}{2^7} = frac{1}{128}).Numerical verification confirms this result. The product of the cosines, when calculated step-by-step, results in approximately (0.0078125), which is indeed (frac{1}{128}).Thus, the value of the product is (boxed{dfrac{1}{128}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a016c3d6></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a016c3d6><span class="icon" data-v-a016c3d6>🔑:</span>7. frac{1}{128} Using the formula cos theta cdot cos left(frac{pi}{3}-thetaright) cdot cos left(frac{pi}{3}+thetaright)=frac{1}{4} cos 3 theta, we get:begin{array}{l}cos frac{pi}{15} cdot cos left(frac{pi}{3}-frac{pi}{15}right) cdot cos left(frac{pi}{3}+frac{pi}{15}right)=cos frac{pi}{15} cdot cos frac{4 pi}{15} cdot cos frac{6 pi}{15}=frac{1}{4} cos frac{pi}{5} cos frac{2 pi}{15} cdot cos left(frac{pi}{3}-frac{2 pi}{15}right) cdot cos left(frac{pi}{3}+frac{2 pi}{15}right)=cos frac{2 pi}{15} cdot cos frac{3 pi}{15} cdot cos frac{7 pi}{15}=frac{1}{4} cos frac{2 pi}{5}end{array}And cos frac{pi}{5} cos frac{2 pi}{5}=frac{sin frac{4 pi}{5}}{4 sin frac{pi}{5}}=frac{1}{4}So the original expression =frac{1}{16} times frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{2}=frac{1}{128}</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-d0e2228e><span data-v-d0e2228e>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
