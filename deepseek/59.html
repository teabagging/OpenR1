We have a square ABCD with each side 31 cm. Points E, F, G are on sides AB, BC, and CD respectively. Specifically, AE is 11 cm, BF is 14 cm, and CG is 10 cm. We need to find the area of triangle EFG. Hmm.First, maybe I should draw the square and mark the points. Let me visualize it. Square ABCD: let&#39;s say A is at the bottom-left corner, B at the bottom-right, C at the top-right, and D at the top-left. So, moving clockwise. Then, point E is on AB, 11 cm from A. Since AB is 31 cm, EB must be 31 - 11 = 20 cm. Then, point F is on BC, 14 cm from B. So, FC is 31 - 14 = 17 cm. Point G is on CD, 10 cm from C, so GD is 31 - 10 = 21 cm.To find the area of triangle EFG, maybe coordinate geometry would work here. Let&#39;s assign coordinates to each point. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since the square has sides of 31 cm, the coordinates of the other points would be: B at (31,0), C at (31,31), and D at (0,31). Now, point E is on AB, 11 cm from A. Since AB is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (31,0), moving 11 cm from A would place E at (11, 0).Point F is on BC, 14 cm from B. BC goes from (31,0) to (31,31). Moving up 14 cm from B, so the coordinates would be (31,14).Point G is on CD, 10 cm from C. CD goes from (31,31) to (0,31). Moving left 10 cm from C, so G is at (31 - 10, 31) = (21,31).Now we have the coordinates of E, F, G:- E: (11, 0)- F: (31,14)- G: (21,31)To find the area of triangle EFG, there are a few methods. One is using the shoelace formula. Let&#39;s recall the formula for the area of a triangle given three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|Let me plug in the coordinates:x1 = 11, y1 = 0x2 = 31, y2 =14x3 =21, y3=31So compute:11*(14 -31) +31*(31 -0) +21*(0 -14)First, compute each term:11*(14 -31) = 11*(-17) = -18731*(31 -0) =31*31=96121*(0 -14)=21*(-14)= -294Add them together: -187 + 961 -294 = let&#39;s compute step by step.-187 +961 = 774774 -294=480Take absolute value (which is still 480) and divide by 2: 480/2=240So area is 240 cm². Wait, but let me check if that&#39;s correct. Let me verify.Alternatively, maybe using vectors or base-height. Let&#39;s see. Alternatively, plotting the points might help. Let me verify the shoelace formula again.Alternatively, the shoelace formula can be set up as:Arrange the coordinates in order (either clockwise or counter-clockwise) and compute the sum of products diagonally and subtract. Let&#39;s list the points E(11,0), F(31,14), G(21,31). Let&#39;s list them in order and repeat the first at the end:11, 031,1421,3111, 0Compute sum of products going down-right: (11*14 +31*31 +21*0) = 154 +961 +0=1115Compute sum of products going up-right: (0*31 +14*21 +31*11)=0 +294 +341=635Subtract the two: 1115 -635=480Take absolute value and divide by 2: 480/2=240. Same result. So area is 240 cm². Hmm, that seems straightforward.Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in coordinates. Let me confirm the coordinates again.Point E: On AB, 11 cm from A. AB is from (0,0) to (31,0). So moving 11 cm along x-axis: (11,0). Correct.Point F: On BC, 14 cm from B. BC is vertical from (31,0) to (31,31). So moving up 14 cm: (31,14). Correct.Point G: On CD, 10 cm from C. CD is from (31,31) to (0,31). Moving left 10 cm: (31-10,31)=(21,31). Correct.Coordinates are correct. Shoelace formula applied correctly, gives 240. Hmm. But wait, 240 cm² seems a bit large? Let me see.The square has area 31²=961 cm². A triangle inside would be a fraction of that. 240 is about a quarter of 961, which is possible. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Let&#39;s compute vectors EF and EG, then take half the magnitude of their cross product.First, vector EF: from E(11,0) to F(31,14): (31-11,14-0)=(20,14)Vector EG: from E(11,0) to G(21,31): (21-11,31-0)=(10,31)Cross product of EF and EG is (20)(31) - (14)(10) = 620 -140=480Area is half the absolute value: 480/2=240. Same result. So that&#39;s another confirmation.Therefore, the area of triangle EFG is 240 cm². Hmm. So maybe that&#39;s the answer. But let me check once more.Alternatively, maybe using coordinates and determinants. The area formula with coordinates:Area = 1/2 | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |Which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to 240. So multiple methods give the same result. So I think that&#39;s solid.Therefore, the area is 240 cm². I think that&#39;s the answer.Final AnswerThe area of triangle ( EFG ) is boxed{240} square centimeters.&lt;/think&gt;Let (ABCD) be a square with side lengths of (31 , text{cm}). Points (E), (F), and (G) are chosen on sides (overline{AB}), (overline{BC}), and (overline{CD}) respectively such that (|AE| = 11 , text{cm}), (|BF| = 14 , text{cm}), and (|CG| = 10 , text{cm}). We need to determine the area of triangle (EFG).First, we assign coordinates to the vertices of the square:- (A = (0, 0))- (B = (31, 0))- (C = (31, 31))- (D = (0, 31))Next, we determine the coordinates of points (E), (F), and (G):- (E) is on (overline{AB}), 11 cm from (A), so (E = (11, 0)).- (F) is on (overline{BC}), 14 cm from (B), so (F = (31, 14)).- (G) is on (overline{CD}), 10 cm from (C), so (G = (21, 31)).Using the shoelace formula to find the area of triangle (EFG) with coordinates (E(11, 0)), (F(31, 14)), and (G(21, 31)):[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right|]Substituting the coordinates:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| 11(14 - 31) + 31(31 - 0) + 21(0 - 14) right|]Calculating each term:[11(14 - 31) = 11 times (-17) = -187][31(31 - 0) = 31 times 31 = 961][21(0 - 14) = 21 times (-14) = -294]Summing these values:[-187 + 961 - 294 = 480]Taking the absolute value and dividing by 2:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 480 = 240]Thus, the area of triangle (EFG) is (boxed{240}) square centimeters.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the area of triangle EFG in a square ABCD with each side being 31 cm. Let me start by visualizing the square. Let&#39;s label the square so that point A is at the bottom left, B is at the bottom right, C is at the top right, and D is at the top left. That way, the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA are the bottom, right, top, and left sides respectively.Now, point E is on side AB such that AE = 11 cm. Since AB is 31 cm long, that means EB = 31 - 11 = 20 cm. So E is 11 cm from A along the bottom side.Point F is on side BC such that BF = 14 cm. Since BC is 31 cm, FC = 31 - 14 = 17 cm. So F is 14 cm up from B along the right side.Point G is on side CD such that CG = 10 cm. CD is the top side from C to D, which is 31 cm. So GD = 31 - 10 = 21 cm. Therefore, G is 10 cm to the left from C along the top side.To find the area of triangle EFG, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to each of the points. Let&#39;s place point A at the origin (0,0). Then:- Point B will be at (31, 0) because it&#39;s 31 cm to the right of A.- Point C will be at (31, 31) because it&#39;s 31 cm up from B.- Point D will be at (0, 31) because it&#39;s 31 cm to the left from C.Now, let&#39;s find the coordinates of points E, F, and G.- Point E is on AB, 11 cm from A. Since AB is horizontal from (0,0) to (31,0), moving 11 cm right from A gives E at (11, 0).- Point F is on BC, 14 cm from B. BC is vertical from (31,0) to (31,31), moving up 14 cm from B gives F at (31, 14).- Point G is on CD, 10 cm from C. CD is horizontal from (31,31) to (0,31), moving left 10 cm from C gives G at (31 - 10, 31) = (21, 31).So now we have coordinates for E (11,0), F (31,14), and G (21,31). To find the area of triangle EFG, we can use the shoelace formula. The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2|Plugging in the coordinates:x1 = 11, y1 = 0x2 = 31, y2 = 14x3 = 21, y3 = 31So,Area = |(11*(14 - 31) + 31*(31 - 0) + 21*(0 - 14)) / 2|Let me compute each term step by step.First term: 11*(14 - 31) = 11*(-17) = -187Second term: 31*(31 - 0) = 31*31 = 961Third term: 21*(0 - 14) = 21*(-14) = -294Adding these three terms: -187 + 961 - 294First, -187 - 294 = -481Then, 961 - 481 = 480Take the absolute value (which is still 480) and divide by 2: 480 / 2 = 240So the area is 240 cm². Wait, let me verify that calculation again to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes.Breaking it down:First term: 11*(14 - 31) = 11*(-17) = -187. Correct.Second term: 31*(31 - 0) = 31*31. 30*30=900, 30*1=30, 1*30=30, 1*1=1, so 900+30+30+1=961. Correct.Third term: 21*(0 -14)=21*(-14). 20*(-14)= -280, 1*(-14)= -14, so total -294. Correct.Sum: -187 + 961 = 774. Then 774 -294=480. Absolute value is 480, divide by 2 gives 240. Yes, that seems right.Alternatively, maybe I can cross-validate using vectors or base-height.Alternatively, plot the points and see.But let me think again. Coordinates:E (11, 0)F (31,14)G (21,31)Alternatively, compute vectors EF and EG and take half the magnitude of the cross product.Vector EF: from E to F is (31-11,14-0) = (20,14)Vector EG: from E to G is (21-11,31-0) = (10,31)Cross product EF × EG = (20)(31) - (14)(10) = 620 - 140 = 480Area is half the absolute value of that cross product, so 480 / 2 = 240. Same result. So that confirms it.So the area of triangle EFG is 240 cm².Wait, but just to make sure, maybe draw a rough sketch mentally. E is on the bottom side, F is on the right side, G is on the top side. Connecting these three points. Since all three are on different sides, the triangle is within the square but spans across. The calculation using coordinates gives 240. Since the square area is 31² = 961, 240 is a reasonable area for a triangle inside.Alternatively, maybe use coordinates to compute using base and height. Let&#39;s see.To use base and height, we need to find the length of one side as the base and then the corresponding height. But since it&#39;s a triangle with coordinates given, shoelace or cross product is more straightforward.Alternatively, divide the figure into parts. But the previous methods already give 240, and cross-validated with cross product, so it&#39;s likely correct.Therefore, the area of triangle EFG is 240 cm².Final AnswerThe area of triangle ( EFG ) is boxed{240} (text{cm}^2).&lt;/think&gt;To determine the area of triangle (EFG) in a square (ABCD) with side lengths of (31 , text{cm}), we first assign coordinates to the vertices of the square:- (A = (0, 0))- (B = (31, 0))- (C = (31, 31))- (D = (0, 31))Next, we find the coordinates of points (E), (F), and (G):- Point (E) is on (AB) such that (AE = 11 , text{cm}), so (E = (11, 0)).- Point (F) is on (BC) such that (BF = 14 , text{cm}), so (F = (31, 14)).- Point (G) is on (CD) such that (CG = 10 , text{cm}), so (G = (21, 31)).Using the coordinates of (E(11, 0)), (F(31, 14)), and (G(21, 31)), we apply the shoelace formula to find the area of triangle (EFG):[text{Area} = left| frac{1}{2} left( x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right) right|]Substituting the coordinates:[text{Area} = left| frac{1}{2} left( 11(14 - 31) + 31(31 - 0) + 21(0 - 14) right) right|]Calculating each term:[11(14 - 31) = 11(-17) = -187][31(31 - 0) = 31 times 31 = 961][21(0 - 14) = 21(-14) = -294]Summing these terms:[-187 + 961 - 294 = 480]Taking the absolute value and dividing by 2:[text{Area} = left| frac{480}{2} right| = 240]Thus, the area of triangle (EFG) is (boxed{240} , text{cm}^2).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-7ab06a9d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>🔑:</span>## Solution:The area of triangle EFG is obtained by subtracting the area of rectangle AEHD and the areas of three right-angled triangles EGH, EBF, and FCG from the area of rectangle ABCD:P_{E F G}=P_{A B C D}-left(P_{A E H D}+P_{E G H}+P_{G F C}+P_{E B F}right)Since the area of a right-angled triangle is half the area of the rectangle whose sides correspond to the legs of the triangle that lie along the right angle, it follows:P_{E F G}=31 cdot 31-(11 cdot 31+10 cdot 31: 2+10 cdot 17: 2+20 cdot 14: 2)P_{E F G}=961-(341+155+85+140)=961-721=240Therefore, the area of triangle EFG is 240 mathrm{~cm}^{2}![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_30_8f249fc2b96bc1b5a03dg-4.jpg?height=647&amp;width=683&amp;top_left_y=533&amp;top_left_x=1339)</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b2f8d6 data-v-7ab06a9d><div class="review" data-v-7ab06a9d><div class="review-title" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>❓:</span>Problem 7. (6 points)Sergei, being a student, worked part-time in a student cafe after classes for a year. Sergei&#39;s salary was 9000 rubles per month. In the same year, Sergei paid for his medical treatment at a healthcare facility in the amount of 100000 rubles and purchased medications on a doctor&#39;s prescription for 20000 rubles (eligible for deduction). The following year, Sergei decided to apply for a social tax deduction. What amount of the paid personal income tax is subject to refund to Sergei from the budget? (Provide the answer as a whole number, without spaces and units of measurement.)## Answer: 14040.## Comment:</div><div class="divider" data-v-7ab06a9d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out how much personal income tax Sergei can get refunded. So, he worked part-time and earned 9000 rubles a month for a year. First, I need to calculate his total income for the year. Since he earned 9000 each month, over 12 months that would be 9000 multiplied by 12. Let me do that: 9000 * 12 is 108,000 rubles total income for the year.Next, personal income tax in Russia is typically 13%. So, the tax he paid for the year would be 13% of his total income. Let&#39;s calculate that: 108,000 * 0.13. Hmm, 108,000 divided by 100 is 1080, times 13 is 14,040. So, he paid 14,040 rubles in personal income tax for the year. Got that part.Now, he paid for medical treatment and medications. The problem says he paid 100,000 rubles for treatment at a healthcare facility and 20,000 rubles for prescribed medications, which are eligible for deduction. So, the total eligible medical expenses are 100,000 + 20,000 = 120,000 rubles.But I remember there are limits on social tax deductions for medical expenses. Let me recall: in Russia, the deduction for medical services and medications is limited to the amount actually paid, but cannot exceed 120,000 rubles per year for certain categories, which includes medical expenses. Wait, no, maybe the 120,000 is the overall social deduction limit, and medical treatment might be part of that. Wait, I need to check the rules again.Wait, social tax deductions include expenses for education, medical treatment, etc. The maximum total deduction for these social expenses (excluding expensive treatments) is 120,000 rubles per year. But expensive treatments have a separate category where you can deduct the full amount. So, first, we need to determine if Sergei&#39;s medical treatment is classified as standard or expensive.The problem mentions &quot;healthcare facility&quot; and &quot;medications on a doctor&#39;s prescription.&quot; Since it doesn&#39;t specify that the treatment was for an expensive type listed by the government, we can assume it&#39;s under the standard social deduction. Therefore, the maximum deduction he can claim for medical expenses (including medications) is 120,000 rubles. But wait, his actual expenses were 120,000 (100k + 20k). But if the maximum allowed is 120,000, then he can claim the full amount. Wait, but the standard social deduction limit is 120,000 total for all social expenses, which includes medical, education, etc. So in this case, since his medical expenses are 120k, he can deduct the full amount.But let me confirm. In Russia, the social tax deduction for medical treatment and medications (if not classified as expensive) is limited to 120,000 rubles per year. So, even if his expenses were higher than 120k, he can only deduct up to 120k. But here his expenses are exactly 120k, so he can deduct the full amount.Therefore, his taxable income would be reduced by 120,000 rubles. His original taxable income was 108,000 rubles. Wait a minute, that can&#39;t be. If his income was 108k, and he wants to deduct 120k, but you can&#39;t deduct more than your income, right? Because deductions reduce the taxable income, so if the deduction is more than the income, the taxable income becomes zero, and you can only get back the tax paid on the actual income.So here&#39;s the catch: Sergei&#39;s income was 108,000 rubles, and his deduction is 120,000 rubles. So, he can only deduct up to his income, meaning 108,000 rubles. Wait, but the deduction limit is 120k, but his income is 108k. So he can deduct the entire 108k, because you can&#39;t deduct more than your income. But the maximum deduction allowed is 120k, but since his income is less, he can only deduct his actual income. Wait, but I might be mixing things up.Wait, the personal income tax is calculated on the income. If he applies a deduction, he subtracts the deduction amount from his taxable income. So, if his taxable income was 108k, and he has a deduction of 120k, then his taxable income becomes 108k - 120k = negative 12k, which is not possible. In such cases, the taxable income is considered zero, and he can get a refund on the tax he paid, which is 13% of his original income (since the deduction reduces his taxable income to zero). Therefore, the maximum refund would be 13% of 108k, which is 14,040 rubles, which matches the initial tax he paid. So regardless of the deduction amount (120k), since his income was 108k, the maximum he can get back is the entire tax he paid.Therefore, the answer should be 14,040 rubles.Wait, but let me check again. Suppose the deduction is 120k, but his income is 108k. The tax deduction would allow him to reduce his taxable income by 108k (since you can&#39;t deduct more than your income). Therefore, the tax refund would be 13% of 108k, which is exactly the tax he paid. So yes, the entire amount he paid in personal income tax would be refunded.But wait, the rules might state that the social deduction is up to 120k, but you can&#39;t get back more than the tax you paid. So even if your deduction is higher than your income, you can only get a refund of the tax you actually paid. So in this case, Sergei&#39;s deduction is 120k, but his income is 108k, so the maximum deduction applied is 108k, leading to a refund of 13% of 108k = 14,040. Which is exactly the tax he paid, so he gets all of it back.Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the answer is 14040.&lt;/think&gt;Sergei&#39;s annual income is (9000 text{ rubles/month} times 12 = 108{,}000 text{ rubles}). The personal income tax (13%) paid is (108{,}000 times 0.13 = 14{,}040 text{ rubles}).His eligible medical expenses total (100{,}000 + 20{,}000 = 120{,}000 text{ rubles}). The social tax deduction limit is (120{,}000 text{ rubles}), but the deduction cannot exceed his taxable income ((108{,}000 text{ rubles})). Thus, the deduction reduces his taxable income to (108{,}000 - 108{,}000 = 0), allowing a full refund of the paid tax.boxed{14040},&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. Sergei wants to apply for a social tax deduction for his medical expenses. I need to figure out how much personal income tax he can get back. First, I remember that in Russia, the social tax deduction for medical treatment allows you to deduct certain medical expenses from your taxable income. The deduction includes costs for treatment and medications as prescribed by a doctor. There&#39;s a limit, though. From what I recall, the maximum deduction for medical expenses is the amount paid, but it can&#39;t exceed 120,000 rubles per year for most social deductions, including medical. Wait, but wait, there&#39;s also a separate limit for expensive treatments. But in this case, Sergei&#39;s treatment was at a healthcare facility for 100,000 rubles and medications for 20,000. I need to check if the treatment is considered expensive or not. Because expensive treatments have a higher limit, but maybe these are standard?Hmm, maybe the 100,000 rubles for treatment isn&#39;t classified as expensive. So, the total deduction would be 100,000 + 20,000 = 120,000 rubles. But wait, if the total social deductions (including medical) can&#39;t exceed 120,000 per year, then Sergei&#39;s total deduction here would be capped at 120,000. But wait, his expenses are exactly 120,000 (100k + 20k). So he can claim the full amount.But wait, another point: the deduction is applied to his taxable income, and the tax refund is 13% of the deduction amount. So he can get back 13% of 120,000. Let&#39;s calculate that: 120,000 * 0.13 = 15,600. But the answer given is 14,040. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?Wait, maybe there&#39;s another factor. Sergei&#39;s income during the year. His salary was 9,000 rubles per month. So for the year, that&#39;s 9,000 * 12 = 108,000 rubles. The personal income tax (NDFL) is 13%, so he paid 108,000 * 0.13 = 14,040 rubles in taxes for the year. Ah, right! The tax deduction cannot exceed the amount of tax he actually paid. Even if his eligible expenses are 120,000, the maximum refund is 13% of 120,000 (15,600), but he only paid 14,040 in taxes. So he can&#39;t get back more than he paid. Therefore, the refund is the total tax he paid, which is 14,040 rubles. So the steps are:1. Calculate Sergei&#39;s annual income: 9,000 * 12 = 108,000 rubles.2. Calculate the personal income tax he paid: 108,000 * 13% = 14,040 rubles.3. Determine the eligible medical expenses: 100,000 + 20,000 = 120,000 rubles.4. Calculate the potential deduction: 120,000 * 13% = 15,600 rubles.5. Compare the potential refund with the actual tax paid. Since 15,600 is more than 14,040, the refund is capped at 14,040.Therefore, the correct answer is 14040.&lt;/think&gt;Sergei&#39;s annual income is 9,000 rubles/month × 12 = 108,000 rubles. The personal income tax (13%) paid is 108,000 × 0.13 = 14,040 rubles. Eligible medical expenses (100,000 + 20,000 = 120,000 rubles) qualify for a deduction. The potential refund (120,000 × 0.13 = 15,600 rubles) exceeds the actual tax paid (14,040 rubles), so the refund is capped at the tax paid. boxed{14040}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-7ab06a9d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>🔑:</span>Solution: the amount of the social tax deduction for medical treatment will be: 100000+20000= 120000 rubles.

Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, since all the balls are arranged in a straight line, we&#39;re dealing with a linear arrangement. The balls are identical except for their color, so the only difference is their positions relative to each other. The key constraint here is that between any two red balls, there must be at least one blue ball. That means no two red balls can be adjacent; there has to be at least a blue ball separating them.Let me start by thinking about how to place the red balls such that the condition is satisfied. If I have 5 red balls, each of them needs at least one blue ball between them. So, if I were to place the 5 red balls first with one blue ball between each pair, how many blue balls would that require?Between 5 red balls, there are 4 gaps (since the number of gaps between n objects is n-1). Each of these gaps needs at least one blue ball. So that&#39;s 4 blue balls already accounted for. Then, we have the remaining blue balls to place. Since there are 13 blue balls in total, subtracting the 4 required between the red balls leaves us with 13 - 4 = 9 blue balls. These remaining 9 blue balls can be distributed freely in the available spots.Where are the available spots? When arranging the red balls with the required blue balls in between, we can think of the arrangement as:R [B] R [B] R [B] R [B] RHere, each [B] represents the required blue ball between the red ones. Additionally, there can be blue balls before the first red ball, between the required blue balls and the red balls, and after the last red ball. So, there are 5 red balls, which create 6 slots where the remaining blue balls can go: one before the first red, four between the reds (but each of those already has one blue), and one after the last red. Wait, actually, the required blue balls are in between the reds, but the remaining blue balls can go into these slots as well. Let me clarify.If we fix the positions of the red balls with the minimum required blue balls, we can model this as:* R B R B R B R B R *Here, the * symbols represent the possible places where the remaining blue balls can be placed. There&#39;s a slot before the first red ball, between each pair of red balls (but each already has a blue), and after the last red ball. However, since we already placed the required blue balls between the reds, the remaining blue balls can go into any of these slots, including the ones between the red balls, but adding to the existing blue balls there.Wait, but actually, when we model this problem, the required blue balls are part of the fixed arrangement, and the remaining blue balls can be placed in the gaps. Let me recall the stars and bars method here. The idea is that if we have a certain number of identical items to distribute into different slots, the number of ways is given by combinations with repetition.In this case, once we&#39;ve placed the 5 red balls with the 4 blue balls between them, we have 5 red + 4 blue = 9 balls already placed. The remaining 13 - 4 = 9 blue balls can be placed in the 6 available slots: before the first red, between the reds (but in each of the four gaps between reds, we can add more blue balls), and after the last red.So, the problem reduces to distributing 9 identical blue balls into 6 distinct slots (the 5+1=6 gaps around the red balls). The number of ways to do this is given by the stars and bars theorem, which states that the number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes is C(n + k - 1, k - 1). So here, n is 9 (the remaining blue balls) and k is 6 (the number of slots). Therefore, the number of ways should be C(9 + 6 - 1, 6 - 1) = C(14, 5).Wait, let me confirm that. Stars and bars formula: the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n is C(n + k - 1, k - 1). So in this case, yes, n = 9, k = 6, so it&#39;s C(9 + 6 -1, 6 -1) = C(14,5). Calculating that, C(14,5) is 2002. But wait, let me check if that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, maybe I messed up the initial step. Let me start over to be sure.We have 5 red balls. To ensure that there&#39;s at least one blue between any two reds, we can place the 5 red balls with one blue between each pair. That uses up 5 red balls and 4 blue balls. Then, the remaining blue balls are 13 - 4 = 9. These 9 can be distributed into the 6 possible positions: before the first red, between each pair of reds (there are 4 such gaps, each already containing one blue), and after the last red. So each of these 6 gaps can receive 0 or more additional blue balls. Therefore, the number of ways is the number of non-negative integer solutions to:x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 = 9where x1 is the number of blue balls before the first red, x2 to x5 are the number of blue balls added between the reds, and x6 is the number after the last red. By stars and bars, this is C(9 + 6 -1, 6 -1) = C(14,5). Calculating C(14,5):C(14,5) = 14! / (5! * 9!) = (14*13*12*11*10)/(5*4*3*2*1) = (14*13*12*11*10)/120Let&#39;s compute that:14*13 = 182182*12 = 21842184*11 = 2402424024*10 = 240240Divide by 120: 240240 / 120 = 2002So yes, that&#39;s 2002. Therefore, the number of arrangements is 2002.But wait, let me check if this approach is correct. Another way to think about it is to first place the red balls with the required blue balls and then distribute the remaining blue balls. So, if we consider the 5 red balls, each separated by at least one blue, we can model this as R B R B R B R B R. This uses 5 red and 4 blue balls. Then, we have 13 - 4 = 9 blue balls left. These can be placed anywhere in the 6 gaps (before the first R, between the R and B pairs, and after the last R). Since the blue balls are identical, the number of ways to distribute these 9 blue balls into 6 gaps is indeed C(14,5). So that seems right.Alternatively, another approach is to consider the problem as arranging the red and blue balls with the given constraint. Since between any two red balls there must be at least one blue, the red balls cannot be adjacent. So this is similar to arranging non-adjacent objects.Another method: first place the blue balls, then choose positions for the red balls such that no two are adjacent. Let&#39;s see if that gives the same answer.If we have 13 blue balls arranged in a line, there are 14 gaps (including the ends) where we can place the red balls. We need to choose 5 gaps such that no two are adjacent. Wait, but if we place red balls in the gaps between blue balls, they are already separated by at least one blue ball.Wait, but in this case, the total number of positions is 13 + 1 = 14 (since for n objects, there are n+1 gaps). We need to choose 5 positions among these 14 gaps to place the red balls. However, since the red balls cannot be adjacent, the gaps we choose must not be adjacent. But if the red balls are placed in different gaps between blue balls, they are automatically separated by at least one blue ball. So actually, in this case, the number of ways would be C(14 - 5 +1, 5) = C(10,5)? Wait, that doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, no. Let me recall: when placing objects in gaps with no two adjacent, the formula is C(n - k + 1, k), where n is the number of gaps and k is the number of objects. Wait, in this case, n = 14 (number of gaps) and k = 5. But the formula for non-adjacent placement is C(n - k + 1, k). Wait, that might not be the exact formula.Wait, actually, the formula for placing k non-adjacent objects in n slots is C(n - k + 1, k). Let me confirm. For example, if we have n slots and want to place k objects such that no two are adjacent, the number of ways is C(n - k +1, k). So here, n = 14 (the number of gaps between blue balls and at the ends), k = 5. Then, the number of ways is C(14 - 5 +1, 5) = C(10,5). Calculating C(10,5) is 252. But wait, this conflicts with the previous answer of 2002. Clearly, something is wrong here.Wait, but that can&#39;t be. Which approach is correct? Let&#39;s think again.First approach: Place red balls with at least one blue between them. Then, distribute remaining blue balls. This gives 2002.Second approach: Place blue balls first, then choose gaps to place red balls. This gives 252. These two results are different, so one must be wrong.Wait, perhaps the second approach is wrong. Let me check again.If we have 13 blue balls, they create 14 gaps (including the ends). To place 5 red balls in these gaps with no two red balls in the same gap (since if two red balls are in the same gap, they would be adjacent). Wait, no, if two red balls are placed in the same gap, they would actually be adjacent. Wait, actually, the problem states that between any two red balls there must be at least one blue ball. Therefore, two red balls cannot be adjacent. If we place two red balls in the same gap between blue balls, then those two reds would be adjacent, which violates the condition.Therefore, we must place each red ball in separate gaps. Since the red balls are identical, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose 5 distinct gaps out of 14, with no two gaps adjacent. Wait, but the gaps are already separated by blue balls, so placing red balls in different gaps automatically ensures that they are separated by at least one blue ball. Wait, actually, if you place a red ball in a gap between blue balls, since each gap is between two blue balls (or at the ends), then putting a red in a gap means it&#39;s between blues or at the end. Therefore, if you place two reds in different gaps, they are separated by at least one blue ball. Therefore, actually, the number of ways should be C(14,5). But that would be 2002, same as the first approach. Wait, but in that case, if the gaps are between blue balls, and placing reds in any of the 14 gaps, even adjacent gaps, but adjacent gaps are separated by a blue ball. Wait, no. Let me visualize.Suppose the blue balls are arranged as:_ B _ B _ B _ ... _ B _Each underscore represents a gap where a red ball can be placed. There are 14 gaps for 13 blue balls. If we place a red in one gap, the next gap is separated by a blue ball. Therefore, even if we place reds in adjacent gaps, like the first and second gap, they are actually separated by a blue ball. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a blue ball followed by a gap, then a blue ball, then a gap, etc. So the gaps are between the blue balls. So adjacent gaps are separated by a blue ball. Therefore, placing red balls in adjacent gaps would actually result in red balls separated by a blue ball. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Let me think.Wait, if the blue balls are in a line: B B B ... B (13 times). The gaps are before the first B, between each pair of B&#39;s, and after the last B. So the positions for red balls are:Position 1: before the first BPosition 2: between B1 and B2Position 3: between B2 and B3...Position 14: after the last BSo, if I place a red in position 1 and position 2, then the red in position 1 is before the first B, and the red in position 2 is between B1 and B2. So the two reds would be separated by B1. So they are not adjacent. Similarly, placing reds in positions 2 and 3 would result in reds between B1-B2 and B2-B3, which are separated by B2, so again not adjacent. Therefore, actually, placing reds in any of the 14 gaps, even adjacent ones, results in non-adjacent red balls. Wait, so in this case, there&#39;s no restriction? That can&#39;t be.But the problem states that between any two red balls, there must be at least one blue ball. If two reds are placed in adjacent gaps, they are separated by a blue ball. Therefore, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, all combinations of placing 5 reds in the 14 gaps are valid. Therefore, the number of ways should be C(14,5) = 2002, which matches the first approach.But then earlier when I thought of the formula C(n - k +1, k), which would give C(10,5) = 252, that was incorrect. So why was that?Because in some problems where you place objects in a line with no two adjacent, like placing red balls among blue balls arranged in a line, you need to subtract the number of forbidden positions. But in this case, because the gaps are between blue balls, placing reds in different gaps automatically ensures that they are separated by at least one blue. Therefore, in this problem, the number of ways is actually C(14,5), not C(10,5). So the initial thought that it&#39;s C(10,5) was wrong because it misapplied the formula. The formula C(n - k +1, k) applies when placing objects in positions where adjacency is possible, but here the adjacency is prevented by the structure of the gaps.Therefore, both approaches agree that the answer is C(14,5) = 2002. Therefore, the correct number of arrangements is 2002.Wait, but let me test with a smaller case to verify. Let&#39;s take 2 red balls and 3 blue balls, with the condition that between the two reds there&#39;s at least one blue. How many arrangements?First approach: Place the two reds with one blue between them: R B R. Then, remaining blue balls: 3 -1 = 2. These can be distributed into the 3 gaps: before the first R, between the Rs (already has 1), and after the last R. So distributing 2 blue balls into 3 gaps: C(2 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(4,2) = 6.Second approach: Place the 3 blue balls, creating 4 gaps. Choose 2 gaps to place the reds: C(4,2) = 6. The possible arrangements are:1. R R B B B → invalid (two reds adjacent)Wait, no. Wait, in the second approach, placing reds in gaps between blues. If we have 3 blue balls: _ B _ B _ B _So four gaps. Placing two reds in these gaps. Each gap is separated by blue balls, so even if we place reds in adjacent gaps, they are separated by a blue. Wait, but in reality, the possible arrangements are:- R R B B B: invalid (two reds adjacent)- R B R B B: valid- R B B R B: valid- R B B B R: valid- B R R B B: invalid- B R B R B: valid- B R B B R: valid- B B R R B: invalid- B B R B R: valid- B B B R R: invalidWait, so actually, there are 6 valid arrangements:1. R B R B B2. R B B R B3. R B B B R4. B R B R B5. B R B B R6. B B R B RWhich is 6, matching C(4,2)=6. But in the explicit enumeration, we see that even placing reds in adjacent gaps (like first and second gap) results in R B R B B, which is valid. Wait, no, if you place reds in the first and second gap, that would be R in position 1 and R in position 2 (between first and second blue). Wait, but with 3 blue balls, the gaps are:1: before B12: between B1 and B23: between B2 and B34: after B3So placing a red in gap 1 and gap 2 would result in:R B1 R B2 B3. So the two reds are separated by B1, which is allowed. Therefore, it&#39;s a valid arrangement.Therefore, in the case of 2 reds and 3 blues, the answer is indeed 6, which is C(4,2). So the formula works here. Therefore, returning to the original problem, the answer is C(14,5)=2002. Therefore, the first approach is correct.Therefore, the number of ways is 2002. Therefore, the answer is boxed{2002}.Final Answerboxed{2002}&lt;/think&gt;To find the number of ways to arrange 13 identical blue balls and 5 identical red balls such that between any two red balls there is at least one blue ball, we can use the following approach:1. Place the red balls with the required blue balls: We need to ensure that there is at least one blue ball between each pair of red balls. For 5 red balls, this requires 4 blue balls. This arrangement can be visualized as:   [   R , B , R , B , R , B , R , B , R   ]   Here, we have used 5 red balls and 4 blue balls.2. Distribute the remaining blue balls: After placing the 4 required blue balls, we have (13 - 4 = 9) remaining blue balls. These 9 blue balls can be distributed into the 6 possible gaps created by the 5 red balls (before the first red ball, between each pair of red balls, and after the last red ball).3. Use the stars and bars method: The number of ways to distribute 9 identical blue balls into 6 distinct gaps is given by the combination formula ( binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ), where ( n ) is the number of remaining blue balls (9) and ( k ) is the number of gaps (6). This results in:   [   binom{9 + 6 - 1}{6 - 1} = binom{14}{5}   ]4. Calculate the combination:    [   binom{14}{5} = frac{14!}{5! cdot 9!} = 2002   ]Thus, the number of ways to arrange the balls is (boxed{2002}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have 13 identical blue balls and 5 identical red balls, and we need to arrange them in a straight line such that between any two red balls there is at least one blue ball. Hmm, alright. Let me think step by step.First, I remember that when arranging objects with certain conditions, sometimes it&#39;s helpful to use the concept of &quot;gaps&quot; or &quot;spaces&quot; where certain objects must be placed. Since the red balls need to have at least one blue ball between them, maybe I should first place the blue balls and then find suitable spots to insert the red balls in between them.Let&#39;s start by considering the 13 blue balls. If we line them up, there will be spaces where we can insert the red balls. Specifically, the number of gaps between blue balls is equal to the number of blue balls plus one. Wait, is that right? Let me visualize this. If you have, say, 3 blue balls: B B B, the gaps where you can insert red balls would be: before the first B, between the first and second B, between the second and third B, and after the third B. So that&#39;s 4 gaps, which is indeed 3 + 1. So, for 13 blue balls, there would be 14 gaps.But hold on, the problem says that between any two red balls there must be at least one blue ball. So, if we place red balls in these gaps, each red ball will be separated by at least one blue ball. But do we need to consider anything else? For example, if we place multiple red balls in the same gap, that might violate the condition, right? Because if two red balls are in the same gap, they would be adjacent without a blue ball in between. So, to satisfy the condition, each red ball must be placed in a separate gap, with at least one blue ball between them.Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing 5 distinct gaps out of the 14 available gaps between the blue balls (including the ends) to place the red balls. Since the red balls are identical, the number of ways should be the combination of 14 gaps taken 5 at a time. So, that would be C(14,5). Let me check if that makes sense.Wait, but let&#39;s confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose we have 2 blue balls and 2 red balls. According to this method, the number of gaps would be 3 (since 2 blue balls have 3 gaps). Then choosing 2 gaps out of 3 would give us 3 combinations. Let&#39;s list them:1. R R B B2. R B R B3. R B B R4. B R R B5. B R B R6. B B R RBut wait, this gives 6 possibilities, but according to C(3,2) = 3. Hmm, there&#39;s a discrepancy here. So my reasoning must be flawed.Wait, hold on. The problem is that the red balls are identical. In the example above, the 6 arrangements I listed are if the red balls are distinct, but since they are identical, some of these are duplicates. Let&#39;s correct that.If the red balls are identical, then the actual distinct arrangements would be:1. R R B B2. R B R B3. R B B R4. B R R B5. B R B R6. B B R RBut since the red balls are identical, each of these 6 arrangements is unique in terms of positions. Wait, but C(3,2) is 3, but here we have 6. So that doesn&#39;t align. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, no, maybe not. Let&#39;s think again. If we have 2 red balls and 2 blue balls, and we need at least one blue between reds. Then the valid arrangements are:1. R B R B2. R B B R3. B R R B4. B R B RWait, but these are 4 arrangements. Hmm, this is conflicting with both the previous counts. What&#39;s the correct answer here?Wait, perhaps my initial problem is that the example is conflicting with the formula. Let me clarify. If we have 2 blue balls and 2 red balls, and we need at least one blue between any two reds. Let&#39;s list all possible arrangements where between any two reds there&#39;s at least one blue.Total arrangements without any restriction: C(4,2) = 6. The invalid arrangements are those where the two reds are adjacent. How many are there? There are 3: positions (1,2), (2,3), (3,4). So, invalid arrangements are 3. Therefore, valid arrangements are 6 - 3 = 3. Wait, but when I listed them earlier, I found 4. There&#39;s confusion here.Wait, let&#39;s list all possible positions with 2 red and 2 blue balls without restriction:1. R R B B2. R B R B3. R B B R4. B R R B5. B R B R6. B B R RNow, the arrangements where red balls are not adjacent are 2,3,5,6. Wait, in arrangement 6: B B R R, the reds are adjacent. So that&#39;s invalid. Similarly, arrangement 1: R R B B, reds are adjacent. Arrangement 4: B R R B, reds are adjacent. So the invalid ones are 1,4,6. So three invalid, hence valid ones are 3: 2,3,5.So three valid arrangements. Therefore, the formula C(3,2) = 3 works here. Wait, but how? Because when I tried to visualize, the gaps between blue balls. If we have 2 blue balls, B B, the gaps are: before first B, between the B&#39;s, and after the second B. So three gaps. Choosing 2 gaps to place red balls, each in a separate gap. Since the red balls are identical, that&#39;s C(3,2)=3. But when I list the valid arrangements, they are:2. R B R B (places R in first and middle gap)3. R B B R (places R in first and last gap)5. B R B R (places R in middle and last gap)So that&#39;s three arrangements. So that&#39;s correct. So in the initial problem, with 13 blue balls and 5 red balls, the number of gaps is 14, so the number of ways is C(14,5). Therefore, that formula works.But in my first example, when I thought I had 6 arrangements, I was wrong because I forgot that some of those would have adjacent red balls, but actually, in that case, only three are valid. So that&#39;s why the formula works.Therefore, going back to the original problem, arranging 13 blue balls and 5 red balls with at least one blue between any two reds. The number of gaps between blue balls is 14, and we need to choose 5 gaps to place the red balls. Since the red balls are identical, the number of ways is the combination C(14,5).Let me compute that. C(14,5) is 14! / (5! * 9!) = (14*13*12*11*10)/(5*4*3*2*1) = let&#39;s calculate that step by step.14*13 = 182182*12 = 21842184*11 = 2402424024*10 = 240240Divide by 5*4*3*2*1 = 120240240 / 120 = 2002So the answer is 2002. Let me check if that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, I can compute 14 choose 5:14C5 = 2002. Yes, that&#39;s correct.But let me make sure there&#39;s no other constraint I missed. The problem says &quot;between any two red balls there is at least one blue ball&quot;. So, for example, if we have multiple red balls in the same gap, that would make them adjacent without a blue ball in between, which is invalid. Therefore, each red ball must be in a separate gap. So the formula of choosing 5 gaps out of 14 is correct. Since the blue balls are already placed, and red balls are placed in the gaps, each in their own gap, ensuring that between any two red balls there is at least one blue ball. Therefore, the answer is indeed 2002.Wait, just to confirm with another example. Suppose 3 blue balls and 2 red balls. Then gaps would be 4. Choosing 2 gaps: C(4,2) = 6. Let&#39;s list them:Positions for red balls:1. First and second gap: R R B B B (but wait, that&#39;s two reds adjacent. Wait, no. If we place red in first gap (before first blue) and second gap (between first and second blue), that would result in R B R B B, which has a red, then blue, then red, then blue. Wait, actually, that is valid. Wait, maybe my previous assumption was wrong. Wait, maybe even if we place reds in adjacent gaps, as long as there&#39;s a blue in between. Wait, confusion here.Wait, no. If you have blue balls as B B B. The gaps are: [1] before first B, [2] between first and second B, [3] between second and third B, [4] after third B.If we place a red in gap 1 and gap 2, then the arrangement is R B R B B. Here, the two reds are separated by a blue. So that is allowed. Similarly, placing reds in gap 2 and 3: B R B R B. Also allowed. Placing reds in gap 3 and 4: B B R B R. Allowed. Similarly, placing reds in gaps 1 and 3: R B B R B. Allowed. Gaps 1 and 4: R B B B R. Allowed. Gaps 2 and 4: B R B B R. Allowed. So all 6 combinations are allowed. Wait, but according to the earlier problem when we had 2 blue and 2 red, we had only 3 valid arrangements. Hmm. So why is there a difference here?Wait, in the previous example with 2 blue and 2 red balls, if we use the same formula, gaps would be 3, so C(3,2)=3. Which matches the valid arrangements. But in the 3 blue and 2 red case, according to this method, we have C(4,2)=6, and all of those are valid. Let me check if those are actually valid.In the case of 3 blue balls and 2 reds:1. R R B B B: two reds adjacent. But according to the gap method, placing reds in gaps 1 and 2 would be R B R B B, right? Wait, no. Wait, if you have 3 blue balls arranged as B B B. The gaps are:1. Before the first B.2. Between first and second B.3. Between second and third B.4. After the third B.If you place reds in gaps 1 and 2, that would be R (gap1) then B, then R (gap2) then B, then B. So the arrangement is R B R B B. Here, the two reds are separated by a blue. So they are not adjacent. Similarly, placing reds in gaps 1 and 3: R B B R B. The two reds are separated by two blues. Placing in gaps 1 and 4: R B B B R. Separated by three blues. Similarly, gaps 2 and 3: B R R B B. Wait, no, placing in gaps 2 and 3 would result in B R B R B. Wait, no. Wait, if you place a red in gap 2 (between first and second B) and gap3 (between second and third B), then it&#39;s B R (gap2) B R (gap3) B. So the arrangement is B R B R B. Here, the reds are separated by a blue. So in all cases, the reds are separated by at least one blue. Therefore, all 6 arrangements are valid, which is different from the previous example where some arrangements had adjacent reds. Wait, why is that?Ah, because in the previous example with 2 blue balls and 2 red balls, when we placed reds in adjacent gaps, such as gaps 1 and 2, that led to R R B B, which is two reds adjacent. Wait, but in the 3 blue and 2 red example, placing reds in adjacent gaps (e.g., gaps 2 and 3) resulted in B R B R B, which is separated by a blue. Wait, why the difference?Oh, because in the 2 blue balls case, the gaps are before first B, between Bs, and after second B. So placing reds in gaps 1 and 2 (before first B and between the two Bs) would give R R B B. But in the 3 blue balls case, gaps 2 and 3 are between first and second B, and between second and third B. So placing reds there gives B R B R B, which is separated. So the key is that adjacent gaps in the 3 blue case are separated by a blue ball, whereas in the 2 blue case, adjacent gaps can lead to adjacent reds.Wait, so maybe the formula works when the number of blue balls is sufficient to separate the gaps. Wait, in the 2 blue case, if you place reds in adjacent gaps, they end up adjacent. But in the 3 blue case, placing reds in adjacent gaps still gives separation because the blue balls are in between. Hmm.Wait, perhaps the key is that when we have n blue balls, the number of gaps is n+1. When placing red balls in these gaps, even if we choose adjacent gaps, the red balls are separated by at least one blue ball. Wait, no. Wait, in the 2 blue case, placing reds in gaps 1 and 2 (which are adjacent) gives R R B B, where the reds are adjacent. But in the 3 blue case, placing reds in gaps 2 and 3 (adjacent gaps) gives B R B R B, where the reds are separated by a blue. So in the 3 blue case, adjacent gaps correspond to positions separated by a blue, whereas in the 2 blue case, adjacent gaps can lead to adjacent reds.Wait, so maybe the formula works only when the number of blue balls is at least the number of red balls minus 1? Wait, no. Let me think again.Wait, actually, when you model the problem as placing red balls into the gaps between blue balls, each gap can hold at most one red ball to satisfy the condition. Because if you put two reds in the same gap, they would be adjacent. Therefore, regardless of the number of blue balls, the condition is that each red must be in a separate gap. Therefore, the number of ways is C(n+1, k), where n is the number of blue balls and k is the number of red balls. But in the 2 blue, 2 red example, that would be C(3,2)=3. But when I actually tried to list the possibilities, there were 3 valid arrangements, so that works.However, when I considered 3 blue and 2 red, the formula gives C(4,2)=6, and all those 6 arrangements are valid. So in that case, putting reds in adjacent gaps is allowed, but in that case, the reds are separated by a blue. So the key is that the gaps are separated by blue balls. So adjacent gaps in the original blue arrangement correspond to positions separated by at least one blue. Therefore, when we place reds in different gaps, regardless of which gaps, they are automatically separated by at least one blue. Therefore, the formula C(n+1, k) is correct for n blue balls and k red balls with the condition of at least one blue between any two reds.Wait, but in the 2 blue and 2 red case, if we use the formula, we get 3, which matches the actual valid arrangements. But when I first thought that arranging 2 red and 2 blue balls would have 6 possibilities but only 3 valid, that was incorrect because I considered positions where reds could be adjacent, but according to the gap method, all the placements are valid. Wait, no. Wait, in the 2 blue and 2 red case, the formula gives 3, but when I list all possible arrangements with the condition, there are only 3 valid ones, as shown earlier. So the formula works. So the confusion was in the initial example where I miscounted the valid arrangements.Therefore, going back to the original problem, with 13 blue balls and 5 red balls, the number of gaps is 14, and the number of ways is C(14,5)=2002. Therefore, the answer should be 2002.But let me double-check with another approach. Suppose we model this as arranging the red balls with at least one blue between them. So first, we place the 5 red balls with one blue ball between each pair. That would require 5 red balls and 4 blue balls (since between 5 reds, there are 4 gaps). Then, we have 13 - 4 = 9 remaining blue balls to distribute.These remaining 9 blue balls can be distributed into the gaps before the first red, between the reds, and after the last red. There are 5 + 1 = 6 gaps (since 5 reds create 6 gaps: before, between, and after). Each of these gaps can have any number of blue balls, including zero. So the number of ways is the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 = 9where xi &gt;= 0. The number of solutions is C(9 + 6 - 1, 6 - 1) = C(14,5)=2002. This matches the previous result.Therefore, this confirms that the answer is indeed 2002.So, summarizing:Method 1: Place the blue balls first, creating 14 gaps. Choose 5 gaps to place the red balls: C(14,5)=2002.Method 2: Consider placing 5 reds with at least one blue between each, using 4 blues, then distributing the remaining 9 blues into 6 gaps: C(14,5)=2002.Both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is 2002.Final Answerboxed{2002}&lt;/think&gt;To find the number of ways of arranging 13 identical blue balls and 5 identical red balls on a straight line such that between any 2 red balls there is at least 1 blue ball, we can use the concept of gaps between blue balls.1. Gaps Method:   - First, arrange the 13 blue balls. This creates 14 gaps (spaces) where the red balls can be placed. These gaps include the positions before the first blue ball, between each pair of blue balls, and after the last blue ball.   - We need to place 5 red balls into these 14 gaps such that each red ball is in a separate gap to ensure there is at least one blue ball between any two red balls.   - The number of ways to choose 5 gaps out of 14 is given by the combination ( binom{14}{5} ).2. Stars and Bars Method:   - Alternatively, consider placing the 5 red balls with at least one blue ball between each pair. This requires 4 blue balls, leaving 9 blue balls to distribute.   - These remaining 9 blue balls can be distributed into 6 gaps (before the first red ball, between each pair of red balls, and after the last red ball). The number of ways to distribute these 9 blue balls is given by the combination ( binom{9 + 6 - 1}{6 - 1} = binom{14}{5} ).Both methods lead to the same result:[binom{14}{5} = frac{14!}{5! cdot 9!} = 2002]Thus, the number of ways to arrange the balls is (boxed{2002}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-7ab06a9d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>🔑:</span>25. Answer: 2002First we place the 5 red balls on a straight line and then place 1 blue ball between 2 adjacent red balls. With this arrangement fixed, the condition of the question is satisfied. We are now left with 9 blue balls. We can place the remaining 9 blue balls into the spaces before, after or in between the 5 red balls. The number of ways that this can be done is the answer to the question. Including the two ends, there are 4+2=6 spaces into which these 9 blue balls can be placed.

A gardener is preparing to plant a row of 20 trees, with two types of trees available: maple trees or sycamore trees.

How many maple trees can there be at most among the 20 trees? qquad</div><div class="divider" data-v-7ab06a9d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is about planting 20 trees in a row, and we can choose between maple and sycamore trees. The key constraint is that between any two maple trees, the number of trees (which would be sycamores) can&#39;t be exactly 3. We need to figure out the maximum number of maple trees we can plant without violating this rule.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. If we have two maple trees, say at positions 1 and 5, then between them are positions 2, 3, 4. That&#39;s three trees. But the problem states that the number of trees between two maple trees cannot be equal to 3. Wait, the problem says &quot;the number of trees between any two maple trees (not including these two maple trees) cannot be equal to 3.&quot; So in my example, between positions 1 and 5, there are 3 trees. That&#39;s exactly the number we can&#39;t have. So that arrangement would be invalid. Therefore, we need to ensure that between any two maple trees, there are either fewer than 3 or more than 3 sycamore trees. But since we&#39;re trying to maximize the number of maple trees, we probably want to minimize the number of sycamores between them, but not less than 3. Wait, no. Wait, if we want to maximize maple trees, we want as many maple trees as possible, but we have to ensure that between any two maple trees, there are not exactly 3 sycamores. So maybe we can have either 0, 1, 2, 4, 5,... sycamores between maples, but not 3. So how can we arrange the maple trees so that the gaps between them (i.e., the number of sycamores) are not 3.This seems similar to spacing constraints in combinatorics. Maybe we can model this as a sequence where we need to avoid having two maple trees with exactly 3 sycamores between them. So, if we have a maple tree, the next maple tree can&#39;t be 4 positions away (since 3 sycamores in between), but could be 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. positions away? Wait, actually, the distance between two maple trees would be the number of positions between them plus 1. Wait, positions 1 and 5 are 4 positions apart, with 3 trees in between. So the distance is 4, which is 3 sycamores. So perhaps, the distance between two maple trees must not be 4. So the problem is equivalent to placing as many maple trees as possible in 20 positions such that no two are 4 apart.Alternatively, if we model the positions as a linear graph, where each node is a position, and edges connect nodes that are 4 apart, then we need to select a set of nodes with no two connected by an edge. That would be an independent set problem. But this might complicate things.Alternatively, think of it as a forbidden distance problem: we cannot have two maple trees at distance 4. So the problem reduces to placing as many objects as possible on a line of 20 positions, such that no two objects are exactly 4 units apart. The maximum number is what we need to find.This seems similar to a problem where you can&#39;t have two points at a certain distance. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is a position, and edges connect nodes 4 apart, then the maximum independent set would give the answer. But computing the maximum independent set for a graph of 20 nodes is tedious, but maybe there&#39;s a pattern.Alternatively, perhaps we can construct a pattern that avoids having maple trees 4 apart, and then see how many we can fit in 20 positions.Let me try constructing such a sequence.Let&#39;s denote M as maple and S as sycamore.If we start with M at position 1, then the next M cannot be at position 5. So positions 5 must be S. Then, the next M could be at position 2. But then from position 2, we have to check that positions 2+4=6 is not M. But position 6 can be M or S? Wait, if we have M at position 2, then position 6 must be S. But if we have M at position 1 and 2, then between them there is 0 sycamores, which is allowed because the forbidden number is 3. So multiple maple trees adjacent are allowed.Wait, the problem says &quot;between any two maple trees, the number of sycamores cannot be equal to 3.&quot; So between two maple trees, if they are adjacent (no sycamores in between), that&#39;s allowed. If they have 1, 2, 4, 5, etc., sycamores in between, that&#39;s okay. Only exactly 3 is forbidden.Therefore, we need to arrange the maple trees such that between any two of them, there are not exactly 3 sycamores. So the minimal distance between two maple trees can&#39;t be 4 (since 3 sycamores in between), but they can be 1, 2, 3, 5, etc.So, to maximize the number of maple trees, we need to place them as close as possible without violating the 3-sycamore rule.If we place them with 0 sycamores in between (i.e., consecutive maples), that&#39;s allowed. But if we place them with 1 sycamore in between, that&#39;s allowed as well. So maybe the optimal arrangement is to use the minimal number of sycamores between maples, but avoiding exactly 3.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify any other constraints, like the total number of sycamores. So maybe the way to maximize maple trees is to cluster them as much as possible where allowed, but avoiding spacing of 4.Alternatively, perhaps a periodic pattern where we alternate between blocks of maples and sycamores with certain lengths.Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each position is a node, and edges connect nodes that are 4 apart, and then the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum independent set on this graph. However, maximum independent set is NP-hard in general, but for a path graph with certain edges, maybe there&#39;s a dynamic programming approach.Alternatively, think of it as a recurrence relation. Let&#39;s denote f(n) as the maximum number of maple trees in a row of n trees.For the base cases:- If n &lt;= 4, then we can plant all maple trees because there&#39;s no room to have two maple trees with 3 sycamores in between. For example, n=1: 1 maple; n=2: 2 maples; n=3: 3 maples; n=4: 4 maples.Wait, but if n=4, can we plant 4 maples? Yes, because there are no two maples with 3 sycamores in between. Because all are maples. So between any two maples, there are 0 sycamores. So yes, allowed.For n=5: If we plant a maple at position 5, but we need to check the previous positions. If we have maples at positions 1 through 4, then planting a maple at 5 would mean that between position 1 and 5, there are 3 sycamores (positions 2,3,4) if they are sycamores. Wait, but if positions 1-5 are all maples, then between positions 1 and 5, there are 3 trees (positions 2,3,4), which are all maples. The problem states that the number of trees between two maples cannot be equal to 3, but it doesn&#39;t specify the type. Wait, the problem says &quot;the number of trees between any two maple trees (not including these two maple trees) cannot be equal to 3.&quot; So even if those trees are maple trees, as long as the count is 3, it&#39;s invalid.Wait, wait, hold on. The problem says &quot;the number of trees between any two maple trees (not including these two maple trees) cannot be equal to 3.&quot; So between two maples, regardless of the type of the trees in between, the total number of trees (which could be maples or sycamores) cannot be 3. Wait, no, the wording is ambiguous. Wait, let me check again.Original problem: &quot;The number of trees between any two maple trees (not including these two maple trees) cannot be equal to 3.&quot;So, between two maple trees, the count of trees (regardless of type) is not allowed to be 3. So even if between two maple trees there are 3 maple trees, that&#39;s still invalid. Because the count is 3. So regardless of the type, the number must not be 3.Therefore, in such a case, even if two maple trees have 3 maple trees in between, that&#39;s invalid. So the key is the distance between two maple trees. If two maple trees are 4 apart (positions 1 and 5), then there are 3 trees in between. So regardless of their types, that&#39;s invalid.Therefore, the problem is equivalent to: Place as many maple trees as possible in 20 positions, such that no two are exactly 4 apart. All other distances are allowed.Therefore, this is similar to a constraint where two maples cannot be separated by exactly 3 trees (i.e., distance 4). So the forbidden distance is 4.This is similar to a maximum independent set problem on a graph where each vertex is connected to the vertex 4 positions away. But since it&#39;s a linear arrangement, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming.Let me try to model this with recurrence relations.Let f(n) be the maximum number of maple trees in a row of n trees.To compute f(n), consider whether the nth position is a maple or not.Case 1: The nth position is a sycamore. Then, f(n) = f(n-1).Case 2: The nth position is a maple. Then, we must ensure that positions n-4 cannot be a maple. Therefore, if we place a maple at position n, positions n-4 must be a sycamore. However, positions before n-4 can be anything. So in this case, the maximum number would be 1 (for the maple at n) plus f(n-5), since positions n-4 must be sycamore, and we can add the maximum for the first n-5 positions.Wait, but if we place a maple at position n, we have to make sure that position n-4 is not a maple. But the problem is, when we place a maple at n, we need to look back 4 positions. If n &gt;=5, position n-4 must be sycamore. But how does that affect the recurrence?Alternatively, maybe the recurrence is:If we place a maple at position n, then position n-4 cannot be a maple, so the maximum number would be 1 + f(n-1 - 4) = 1 + f(n-5). But the problem is, positions between n-4 and n-1 can have maples as long as they don&#39;t conflict.Wait, perhaps the correct recurrence is:f(n) = max(f(n-1), 1 + f(n-5))But is that accurate?Wait, let&#39;s see. If we don&#39;t place a maple at position n, then it&#39;s f(n-1). If we do place a maple at position n, we have to ensure that position n-4 is not a maple. However, to compute f(n) when placing a maple at n, we need to consider the maximum number of maples up to position n-5, plus 1 (for position n), and also ensuring that position n-4 is a sycamore. But since f(n-5) is the maximum number of maples up to position n-5, regardless of whether position n-5 is a maple or not. However, placing a maple at n requires position n-4 to be sycamore, which isn&#39;t directly accounted for in f(n-5). Therefore, maybe this recurrence isn&#39;t precise.Alternatively, perhaps we need a state-dependent DP where we track whether certain previous positions are maples or not.Let me think. Suppose we define f(n) as the maximum number of maples in the first n positions, with the additional constraint that position n is a maple. Similarly, g(n) as the maximum number of maples in the first n positions where position n is a sycamore. Then:- If position n is a maple, then position n-4 must be a sycamore. Therefore, the maximum number when placing a maple at n is 1 + max{ f(n-5), g(n-5) }, but wait, no. If we place a maple at n, we have to look back 4 positions to n-4. So regardless of what&#39;s before n-4, position n-4 must not be a maple. Therefore, if we place a maple at n, the maximum would be 1 + the maximum number of maples in the first n-1 positions where position n-4 is a sycamore. But this complicates the recurrence because it&#39;s not just f(n-1) or f(n-5), but depends on the state at n-4.Alternatively, maybe we need to track the last few positions. Since the forbidden distance is 4, maybe we need to track the last 4 positions.But this might get complicated, but let&#39;s attempt.Suppose we model the DP state as the status of positions n-4 to n-1. Since placing a maple at n affects position n-4, we need to remember whether position n-4 was a maple or not. However, considering that the forbidden distance is 4, maybe we need to track the last 4 positions to ensure that none of them are maples if we place a maple at n.Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to structure the DP.Define f(n) as the maximum number of maples in the first n positions, without any restriction on the nth position.If we place a maple at position n, then we need to make sure that positions n-4 is not a maple. However, positions n-1, n-2, n-3 can be anything. So the maximum number of maples would be 1 + the maximum number of maples in the first n-1 positions where position n-4 is not a maple.But how do we model that? Because the state of position n-4 affects the current choice. Maybe we need a state that keeps track of the last 4 positions.Alternatively, define f(n) as the maximum number of maples in the first n positions, with the constraint that position n is a maple. Similarly, g(n) as the maximum number when position n is a sycamore. Then:- If position n is a sycamore, then the maximum is max(f(n-1), g(n-1)).- If position n is a maple, then position n-4 must be a sycamore. Therefore, the maximum is 1 + max(f(n-1), g(n-1)) but ensuring that position n-4 is a sycamore. Wait, this is confusing.Alternatively, when placing a maple at position n, we need to look back 4 positions. So the recurrence for f(n) would be 1 + h(n-1), where h(n-1) is the maximum number of maples in the first n-1 positions with the constraint that position n-4 is a sycamore. But this requires tracking additional states.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s simpler to think in terms of forbidden positions. If we place a maple at position n, then positions n-4 cannot be a maple. So when we place a maple at n, we have to subtract the possibility of having a maple at n-4. Therefore, f(n) = max( f(n-1), 1 + f(n-5) )Wait, this is similar to the earlier idea. Let&#39;s check with small n:For n=1: f(1)=1For n=2: max(f(1),1 + f(-3)). Since f(-3)=0, so f(2)=max(1,1)=1? But actually, we can have 2 maples here. Hmm, this suggests the recurrence is not correct.Wait, maybe f(n) = max( f(n-1), 1 + f(n-5) )But for n=5:If we place a maple at 5, then position 1 must not be a maple, so the maximum would be 1 + f(0) =1. If we don&#39;t place a maple at 5, then it&#39;s f(4)=4. Therefore, f(5)=max(4,1)=4. But that&#39;s not possible, because if we have maples at positions 1-4, then placing a maple at 5 would create a conflict with position 1 (distance 4). So we can&#39;t have 5 maples. Therefore, f(5)=4, which matches the recurrence. But for n=2, according to the recurrence f(2)=max(f(1)=1, 1 + f(-3)=1). But actually, we can have 2 maples at positions 1 and 2, since there is no distance of 4 between them. So f(2)=2. Therefore, the recurrence is incorrect.Hence, this approach might not work.Alternative approach: Let&#39;s try to manually construct the sequence for n=20, using a pattern that avoids placing maples 4 apart.To maximize the number of maples, let&#39;s try to place them as close as possible, but skipping every 4th position.Wait, perhaps the pattern is to place a maple every 4 positions. Wait, no, that would result in maples at positions 1,5,9,... which are 4 apart, which is exactly the forbidden distance. So that&#39;s invalid.Alternatively, place maples in blocks of 3, then skip 1, then repeat. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, since the forbidden distance is 4, maybe we can partition the 20 positions into groups where each group can have at most one maple, such that any two maples in different groups are more than 4 apart. But how?Alternatively, if we partition the positions into 5 groups, each of 4 consecutive positions. But if we take one maple from each group, that might result in distances of 4. Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, think of the problem as coloring the positions with two colors (maple or sycamore), such that no two maples are exactly 4 apart. This is equivalent to a graph coloring problem where each node is connected to the node 4 positions away, and we want the maximum number of nodes colored maple with no two connected nodes colored maple.In graph terms, this graph is a union of several paths. For example, in 20 nodes, connecting each node to the node 4 positions ahead. So node 1 connected to 5, 5 connected to 9, etc. Similarly, node 2 connected to 6, 6 to 10, etc. So the graph consists of 4 separate paths: 1-5-9-13-17, 2-6-10-14-18, 3-7-11-15-19, 4-8-12-16-20. Each of these is a path of 5 nodes (for the first chain: 1,5,9,13,17) spaced 4 apart.In each of these chains, the maximum independent set is the ceiling of the number of nodes divided by 2, but since it&#39;s a path graph, the maximum independent set can be calculated.Wait, for a path graph of n nodes, the maximum independent set can be computed with dynamic programming. For a single path of 5 nodes (like 1-5-9-13-17), the maximum independent set would be 3 (select 1,9,17 or 5,13, etc.). Wait, let me confirm:For a path of 5 nodes: nodes A-B-C-D-E. The maximum independent set is 3 (e.g., A, C, E). Similarly, for a path of 4 nodes: A-B-C-D, maximum independent set is 2 (A and C or B and D). For a path of 3 nodes: A-B-C, maximum is 2 (A and C). For a path of 2 nodes: A-B, maximum is 1. For a single node, it&#39;s 1.So applying this to each of the 4 chains:Each chain (positions 1-5-9-13-17, 2-6-10-14-18, 3-7-11-15-19, 4-8-12-16-20) has 5 nodes. The maximum independent set for each is 3. Therefore, total maximum independent set across all chains is 4 chains * 3 = 12. Therefore, the maximum number of maples is 12.Wait, but let me verify this. If we can select 3 maples from each of the 4 chains without any two maples being 4 apart, then total is 12. But since the chains are independent (no connections between them), yes, the maximum independent set for the entire graph is the sum of the maximum independent sets for each chain.But is this the case?Wait, the original graph is 20 nodes, with edges between nodes 4 apart. So as per the earlier breakdown, there are 4 separate chains, each a path of 5 nodes. Each chain is non-overlapping, so the maximum independent set is indeed 3 per chain, totaling 12. So according to this, the answer is 12.But let&#39;s check with an example. Let&#39;s take chain 1: positions 1,5,9,13,17. If we choose maples at 1,9,17, then they are spaced 8 apart, which is allowed. Similarly, chain 2: 2,6,10,14,18. Choose 2,10,18. Similarly, chain 3: 3,7,11,15,19. Choose 3,11,19. Chain 4: 4,8,12,16,20. Choose 4,12,20. So in total, 3*4=12 maples. None of these maples are 4 apart because each selected maple is in a separate chain, and within each chain, the maples are spaced 8 apart. Therefore, no two maples are 4 apart. Therefore, 12 seems achievable.But can we do better?Suppose instead of dividing into 4 chains, we consider overlapping chains? Wait, but the original graph is actually composed of those 4 separate chains. Since edges only connect nodes 4 apart, and the chains are separate, the maximum independent set is indeed the sum over each chain. So 12 is the maximum.But let&#39;s test with a smaller n. For example, n=5. If we use this method, chain 1 has 1,5; chain 2 has 2; chain 3 has 3; chain 4 has 4. Wait, no, for n=5, the chains would be:1-5,2-6 (but 6 &gt;5),3-7,4-8,so actually, chain 1:1-5, chain 2:2, chain3:3, chain4:4. So maximum independent set would be for chain1: maximum independent set is 2 (positions1 and 5 are connected, so max independent set is1). Then chains2-4 have 1 each. Total 1+1+1+1=4, which matches f(5)=4.Alternatively, if we use the path graph approach for each chain. For chain1:1-5, which is a path of 2 nodes, maximum independent set is1. So total 1+1+1+1=4.So that works.Therefore, for n=20, divided into 4 chains each of length 5, each chain can have a maximum independent set of3, so total 12. Hence, the answer is12.But let me try constructing such a configuration.Plant maples at positions:Chain1:1,9,17Chain2:2,10,18Chain3:3,11,19Chain4:4,12,20So positions1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12,17,18,19,20: total12 maples.Now check if any two maples are 4 apart.Check between chain1 and others:Position1 and chain2&#39;s position2: difference1, okay.Position1 and position9: difference8, okay.Position1 and position10: difference9, okay.Similarly, all differences are more than4 or less.Wait, but between position9 (chain1) and position5 (not a maple), etc. So seems okay.But wait, in this configuration, between position4 (maple) and position8 (sycamore), then position12 (maple). So between 4 and12, there are7 positions:5-11. So number of trees between4 and12 is7, which is allowed.Similarly, between1 and2: adjacent, allowed.Therefore, this configuration has12 maples, none of which are4 apart. So it&#39;s valid.But can we add another maple?Suppose we try to add a maple at position5. Now, check if position5 conflicts with any existing maples.Existing maples at1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12,17,18,19,20.Position5: check if there&#39;s a maple at position1 (yes). 5-1=4, so positions1 and5 would be4 apart. Since position1 is a maple, we cannot have another maple at5. Therefore, position5 cannot be a maple.Similarly, trying to add a maple at position6. Check existing maples at2,10, etc. 6-2=4, so position2 is maple, so cannot have maple at6. Similarly, position7: 7-3=4, maple at3, so no. Position8: 8-4=4, maple at4, so no. Positions13-16: check conflicts.Position13: existing maple at9 and17. 13-9=4, maple at9, so cannot have maple at13. Similarly,14-10=4,15-11=4,16-12=4. So positions13-16 cannot have maples.Similarly, positions5-8,13-16 cannot have maples due to conflicts with the existing ones. Therefore, cannot add any more maples without violating the constraint. Therefore,12 is indeed the maximum.Alternatively, is there a different arrangement where we can have more than12 maples?Suppose instead of spacing them 8 apart in each chain, we do something else. For example, in chain1:1,6,11,16. But wait,1 and6 are5 apart, which is allowed.6 and11 are5 apart, etc. But position1 and6: between them are4 trees (positions2-5). Number of trees between1 and6 is4, which is not equal to3, so allowed. Similarly, between6 and11: positions7-10, 4 trees, allowed. Similarly,11 and16:4 trees. So in this case, chain1 could have4 maples:1,6,11,16. Wait, but this is within the 20 positions. Let&#39;s check if any are4 apart.Position1 and5: if position5 is maple, but in this case, position5 isn&#39;t. 1 and6: difference5, allowed. Similarly,6 and11:5.11 and16:5. So allowed. Then in chain1, we could have4 maples. Similarly, in chain2:2,7,12,17. Chain3:3,8,13,18. Chain4:4,9,14,19. Then each chain has4 maples. Wait, but positions17,18,19 are in multiple chains?Wait, if we take chain1 as1,6,11,16, chain2 as2,7,12,17, chain3 as3,8,13,18, chain4 as4,9,14,19, and chain5 as5,10,15,20. Wait, but the original chains were based on modulo4, but if we shift the chains, maybe we can get more.Wait, this approach is overlapping chains, so maybe we can interleave them.But in this case, for example, position6 is in chain1 and chain2? No, if chain1 is1,6,11,16, and chain2 is2,7,12,17, they don&#39;t overlap. Each position is in only one chain. Then, in this arrangement, each chain is spaced5 apart, so each maple is5 apart within the chain. Therefore, no two maples are4 apart. Therefore, in this case, each chain of4 maples. But how many chains do we have?Wait, starting at1:1,6,11,16Starting at2:2,7,12,17Starting at3:3,8,13,18Starting at4:4,9,14,19Starting at5:5,10,15,20But 5 chains. However, each position is only in one chain. So total maples would be4 maples per chain *5 chains=20. But that&#39;s impossible because we only have20 positions. But clearly, if we do that, all positions would be maples, which is invalid because two maples would be adjacent (e.g.,1 and2), but the problem only forbids two maples with exactly3 sycamores between them. Adjacent maples are allowed. Wait, but in this case, all trees are maples. The problem states &quot;the number of trees between any two maple trees cannot be equal to3&quot;. If all trees are maples, then between any two maples, the number of trees is the difference minus2. For example, between position1 and5: positions2,3,4, which are3 trees. But since they are all maples, the number of trees (of any type) between them is3, which is forbidden. Therefore, such a configuration is invalid.Therefore, this approach of spacing every5 positions doesn&#39;t work because it leads to two maples with exactly3 trees in between.Hence, going back, the initial approach of dividing into4 chains each spaced4 apart and selecting3 maples from each chain gives12 maples, which seems to be the maximum.Alternatively, another way: consider that each time you place a maple, you have to avoid placing another maple4 positions ahead or behind. So it&#39;s like a graph where each node is connected to the node4 away, and we need the maximum independent set.As previously, the graph is4 separate paths, each of5 nodes. The maximum independent set for each path of5 nodes is3. Hence, total12.Therefore, the answer should be12.But let me check another arrangement. Suppose we do a pattern of M, M, M, S, M, M, M, S,... etc.So every4th position is S. Let&#39;s see:Positions1-3:M, position4:S, positions5-7:M, position8:S, positions9-11:M, position12:S, positions13-15:M, position16:S, positions17-19:M, position20:S.Total maples:3+3+3+3+3=15. Wait, positions1-3:M (3), positions5-7:M (3), positions9-11:M (3), positions13-15:M (3), positions17-19:M (3), position20:S. Total maple trees:15. But let&#39;s check the distances.Between position3 and5: two positions apart (positions4:S), so number of trees between them is1 (position4), which is allowed. Between position7 and9: similarly, position8:S. Trees between them:1, allowed. Between position1 and5: positions2,3,4. Wait, position1 and5 are both M. The number of trees between them is3 (positions2,3,4). But according to the problem, this is forbidden. Because between two Ms, there are3 trees (positions2,3,4). Even though those trees are Ms, the count is3, which is invalid.Therefore, this arrangement is invalid. Hence, even though we have alternating blocks of3 Ms and1 S, the distance between Ms across the S is4, leading to3 trees in between, which is forbidden.Therefore, this pattern doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, try a pattern of M, S, M, S,... alternating. But that would give10 Ms. But10 is less than12, so not optimal.Alternatively, another pattern: M, M, S, M, M, S,... So two Ms followed by one S. Let&#39;s see:Positions1-2:M, 3:S,4-5:M,6:S,7-8:M,9:S,10-11:M,12:S,13-14:M,15:S,16-17:M,18:S,19-20:M.Total Ms:2+2+2+2+2+2=12. Wait, same as before. Let&#39;s check distances.Between position2 and4: positions3:S. Number of trees between2 and4 is1, allowed.Between position5 and7: positions6:S. Number of trees is1, allowed.But between position1 and5: positions2,3,4. Number of trees is3 (positions2:M,3:S,4:M). Wait, the count is3 trees, regardless of type. So between1 and5, there are3 trees. Which is forbidden. Hence, invalid.Therefore, this pattern also results in forbidden distances.Hence, the initial approach of dividing into4 chains and taking3 from each seems to be the only valid method.Therefore, the maximum number of maple trees is12.Final AnswerThe maximum number of maple trees that can be planted is boxed{12}.&lt;/think&gt;The problem is to determine the maximum number of maple trees that can be planted in a row of 20 trees, such that the number of trees between any two maple trees (not including these two maple trees) is not equal to 3. Key steps to solve the problem:1. Understanding the Constraint: The number of trees between any two maple trees (not including the two maple trees) cannot be 3. This means that the distance between any two maple trees cannot be 4 (since 3 trees in between).2. Graph Representation: The problem can be modeled as a graph where each position is a node, and edges connect nodes that are 4 positions apart. This graph is composed of 4 separate chains, each corresponding to positions 1-5-9-13-17, 2-6-10-14-18, 3-7-11-15-19, and 4-8-12-16-20.3. Maximum Independent Set: For each chain (path graph of 5 nodes), the maximum independent set (the largest set of nodes with no two adjacent) is 3. This is because in a path graph of 5 nodes, the maximum independent set can be 3 by selecting nodes that are not adjacent.4. Summing Independent Sets: Since there are 4 independent chains, the total maximum number of maple trees is the sum of the maximum independent sets for each chain. Each chain contributes 3 maple trees, leading to a total of (4 times 3 = 12).5. Verification: The configuration of planting maple trees at positions 1, 9, 17; 2, 10, 18; 3, 11, 19; and 4, 12, 20 ensures that no two maple trees are 4 positions apart, thus satisfying the constraint.Thus, the maximum number of maple trees that can be planted is (boxed{12}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is about planting 20 trees in a row, and we can choose between maple and sycamore trees. The key constraint is that between any two maple trees, the number of trees in between them (not including the two maple trees themselves) cannot be equal to 3. We need to figure out the maximum number of maple trees possible under this rule. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down.First, let me make sure I understand the constraint correctly. If we have two maple trees, say at positions i and j where i &lt; j, then the number of trees between them is (j - i - 1). This number cannot be equal to 3. So, (j - i - 1) ≠ 3, which simplifies to (j - i) ≠ 4. Therefore, the distance between any two maple trees (in terms of positions) cannot be 4. So, two maple trees cannot be 4 positions apart. That means we can&#39;t have maple trees at positions 1 and 5, for example, because there are 3 trees in between (positions 2, 3, 4), which violates the constraint.So, our goal is to place as many maple trees as possible in 20 positions, such that no two maple trees are exactly 4 positions apart. This seems similar to certain combinatorial problems where you have to place objects with spacing constraints. Maybe like a maximum independent set problem on a graph where nodes represent positions and edges represent forbidden distances?Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a sequence where we need to avoid having two maple trees with 3 trees between them. Let me think about how to approach this.One possible strategy is to construct a pattern or a spacing sequence that avoids having gaps of 4 (since the distance between two maples can&#39;t be 4). So, if we can find a repeating pattern that allows the maximum number of maple trees while avoiding gaps of 4, we can then apply that pattern to the 20 positions and calculate the total.Let me try constructing such a pattern. Let&#39;s start by placing a maple tree. Then, the next maple tree can&#39;t be 4 positions away. Let&#39;s see:If we place a maple tree at position 1, the next maple tree can&#39;t be at position 5. So, possible positions for the next maple tree after 1 are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, etc. But if we place them too close, we might limit the total number. So maybe we need to space them out as much as possible without violating the constraint.Wait, but if we space them too far apart, we might end up with fewer maple trees. So there&#39;s a balance here. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we place a maple tree every 5 positions. Then, the distance between them would be 4 positions, which is allowed? Wait, no. Wait, if we place them every 5 positions, the distance between two consecutive maples would be 5 - 1 = 4 positions. Wait, the distance is (j - i) = 5 - 1 = 4, which is exactly the forbidden distance. So that&#39;s not allowed. So placing maples every 5 positions is invalid.What about every 5 positions? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The forbidden distance is 4, so the next maple tree after position i cannot be at i + 4. So, the next maple tree must be either i + 1, i + 2, i + 3, or i + 5 or more. But if we choose i + 1, then we have consecutive maples. That might allow more maples, but maybe creates conflicts with subsequent placements.Alternatively, maybe a pattern like M, S, S, S, M, S, S, S, M,... but that has a gap of 3 trees between maples (distance 4), which is invalid. So that&#39;s not allowed.Alternatively, M, S, S, M, S, S, M,... Here, between M&#39;s there are two S&#39;s, so the number of trees between is 2, which is allowed. The distance between M&#39;s is 3. Then, this might be okay, but is it optimal? Let&#39;s see. If we have a repeating pattern of M, S, S, M, S, S, etc., which is a cycle of 3 positions. Then, in 20 positions, how many M&#39;s would that be?20 divided by 3 is 6 cycles with 2 positions remaining. So, 6*1 + 2 = 8 M&#39;s? Wait, no. Wait, each cycle is 3 positions (M, S, S), so each cycle has 1 M and 2 S&#39;s. Therefore, in 3n positions, we have n M&#39;s. For 20 positions, 3*6 = 18, so 6 M&#39;s, and then 2 positions left. If we add an M in the 19th position, that would make 7 M&#39;s, but we need to check the constraints.Wait, the last M would be at position 19. The previous M would be at position 18 - 3 = 15. The distance between 15 and 19 is 4, which is forbidden. So we can&#39;t place an M at 19 if there&#39;s an M at 15. Therefore, instead, in the remaining 2 positions (19 and 20), we can&#39;t place an M. So total M&#39;s would be 6. But this might not be the maximum. Because maybe another pattern allows more M&#39;s.Alternatively, suppose we use a different pattern. Let&#39;s try to place M&#39;s such that between them there are 1, 2, or 4 trees. Let&#39;s see.Wait, the problem says that the number of trees between any two M&#39;s cannot be equal to 3. So between any two M&#39;s, the number of trees (not including the two M&#39;s) is either 0,1,2,4,5,... So, the distance between M&#39;s (difference in positions) can&#39;t be 4. So positions can&#39;t differ by 4.So, for example, if we have M at position 1, then positions 5,9,13,17 can&#39;t have M&#39;s. Similarly, if we have M at position 2, then 6,10,14,18 can&#39;t have M&#39;s, and so on.This seems like a graph where each position is a node, and edges connect nodes that are 4 apart. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. However, maximum independent set is a hard problem in general, but maybe for this specific graph structure (a path graph with additional edges between nodes 4 apart), we can find a pattern.Alternatively, maybe use a greedy algorithm. Start placing M&#39;s as much as possible, skipping 4 positions after each M. Wait, but that might not work because the constraints are bidirectional. For example, if you place an M at position 1, you can&#39;t place at 5, but placing at 2 would restrict 6, etc. It might get complex.Alternatively, divide the positions into groups where placing an M in one group doesn&#39;t affect others. For example, modular arithmetic. If we consider positions modulo 5, since the forbidden distance is 4, which is one less than 5. Let me see.If we partition the 20 positions into 5 groups based on their position modulo 5:Group 0: positions 1, 6, 11, 16Group 1: positions 2, 7, 12, 17Group 2: positions 3, 8, 13, 18Group 3: positions 4, 9, 14, 19Group 4: positions 5, 10, 15, 20Now, if we choose one group, say group 0, and place M&#39;s in all those positions, then since the distance between any two M&#39;s in group 0 is 5, which is allowed (since 5 -1 =4 trees in between, but wait, the distance between positions 1 and 6 is 5, so the number of trees between them is 4, which is forbidden. Wait, so if we place M&#39;s in group 0, positions 1,6,11,16, then between 1 and 6, there are 4 trees (positions 2,3,4,5), which is exactly the forbidden number. So we can&#39;t have M&#39;s in the same group.Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is a position, and edges connect nodes that are 4 apart. Then, the maximum independent set in this graph would be the answer. But building such a graph for 20 nodes and finding the maximum independent set might be tedious, but maybe manageable.Let me try to visualize the graph. Positions 1 to 20. Each position is connected to the position 4 away from it. So, 1 connected to 5, 5 connected to 9, 9 to 13, 13 to 17, 17 to 21 (which doesn&#39;t exist). Similarly, 2 connected to 6, 6 to 10, 10 to 14, 14 to 18, 18 to 22. 3 connected to 7, 7 to 11, 11 to 15, 15 to 19, 19 to 23. 4 connected to 8, 8 to 12, 12 to 16, 16 to 20, 20 to 24. So, it&#39;s a union of several paths. Each starting from 1-5-9-13-17, 2-6-10-14-18, 3-7-11-15-19, 4-8-12-16-20.Each of these is a path of length 4 or 5. For example, the first path 1-5-9-13-17 has 5 nodes. The maximum independent set on a path graph can be found using dynamic programming. For a path of n nodes, the maximum independent set can be calculated as follows: for each node, you can either include it and add the MIS of the nodes before the previous one, or exclude it and take the MIS of the previous nodes.Applying this to each of the four paths:1. Path 1: 1-5-9-13-17 (5 nodes)2. Path 2: 2-6-10-14-18 (5 nodes)3. Path 3: 3-7-11-15-19 (5 nodes)4. Path 4: 4-8-12-16-20 (5 nodes)Each path has 5 nodes. Let&#39;s compute the maximum independent set for a 5-node path.For a path with 1 node: MIS =1For 2 nodes: MIS=1For 3 nodes: MIS=2For 4 nodes: MIS=2Wait, wait, maybe I need to recall the formula. The maximum independent set for a path graph with n nodes is given by the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, MIS(n) = MIS(n-1) + MIS(n-2), with base cases MIS(1)=1, MIS(2)=1. Therefore:MIS(1) =1MIS(2)=1MIS(3)= MIS(2) + MIS(1)=1+1=2MIS(4)= MIS(3)+MIS(2)=2+1=3MIS(5)= MIS(4)+MIS(3)=3+2=5? Wait, but that can&#39;t be. Wait, for a path of 5 nodes connected as 1-2-3-4-5, the maximum independent set would be 3. Because you can pick nodes 1,3,5 or 2,4, etc. Wait, maybe my recurrence is wrong.Wait, actually, the standard recurrence is that for each node i, if you include it, you can&#39;t include i-1, so you add 1 + MIS(i-2). If you exclude it, you take MIS(i-1). So MIS(n) = max(MIS(n-1), 1 + MIS(n-2)). So starting from:MIS(1) =1MIS(2)=1MIS(3)= max(MIS(2), 1 + MIS(1)) = max(1,2)=2MIS(4)= max(MIS(3),1 + MIS(2))= max(2,2)=2Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let&#39;s think. For a path of 4 nodes: 1-2-3-4. The maximum independent set would be 2 (nodes 1 and 3, or 2 and 4). So MIS(4)=2.MIS(5)= max(MIS(4),1 + MIS(3))= max(2,1 + 2)=3. So for a path of 5 nodes, MIS is 3. For example, nodes 1,3,5.But in our case, each path is of length 5, but the nodes are not consecutive. Wait, in our problem, the path is 1-5-9-13-17. Each node is 4 apart. Wait, no. Wait, in the graph we constructed, each path is actually a linear chain where each node is connected to the next one 4 positions ahead. But the actual graph for each path is just a linear chain of 5 nodes, each connected to the next. So the structure is similar to a path graph with 5 nodes in a line. Therefore, the maximum independent set for each such path would be 3.Therefore, each of the four paths (each with 5 nodes) can have an MIS of 3. Therefore, the total maximum number of maple trees would be 4 paths * 3 = 12. But wait, let&#39;s confirm this.For each path like 1-5-9-13-17, the maximum independent set is 3. So choosing, for example, 1,9,17. Then in the next path 2-6-10-14-18, choose 2,10,18. Similarly, for path 3: 3,11,19. Path 4:4,12,20. So that&#39;s 3*4=12 maple trees. However, we need to check if there are any conflicts between these choices. Because even though within each path the nodes are 4 apart, between different paths, the nodes might be closer.Wait, for example, if we choose position 1 from path 1, position 2 from path 2, position 3 from path3, etc., then the distance between position 1 and 2 is 1, which is allowed (since the forbidden distance is 4). Similarly, the distance between 1 and 5 is 4, but 5 is in the same path, which we didn&#39;t choose. Wait, in our selection, we picked 1,9,17 from path1; 2,10,18 from path2; 3,11,19 from path3; and 4,12,20 from path4. So let&#39;s check the distances between any two selected positions.Take 1 (path1) and 2 (path2): distance 1, allowed.1 and 3: distance 2, allowed.1 and 4: distance 3, allowed.1 and 9: distance 8, which is allowed (since only distance 4 is forbidden).Wait, the forbidden distance is 4, so any two M&#39;s cannot be 4 apart. So the difference in their positions cannot be 4. So, for example, between 1 and 5 is 4, which is forbidden. But in our selection, we have 1,9,17 in path1. 1 and 9 are 8 apart, which is okay. Similarly, 9 and 17 are 8 apart. So within the same path, they are spaced 8 apart, which is allowed.But what about across different paths? For example, position 2 (path2) and position 6 (path2) are 4 apart, but we didn&#39;t choose 6. However, position 2 and position 6: if someone else had chosen 6, but we didn&#39;t. Wait, no. In our selection, we have 2,10,18 from path2. The distance between 2 and 10 is 8, which is okay. 10 and 18 is 8. Similarly, path3 has 3,11,19. 3 to 11 is 8, 11 to 19 is 8. Path4 has 4,12,20. 4 to12 is 8, 12 to20 is 8.Now, checking between different paths. For example, position1 (from path1) and position5 (from path1) is 4 apart, but we didn&#39;t choose position5. Similarly, position1 and position2 (from path2) is 1 apart, which is allowed. Position1 and position6 (from path2) is 5 apart, which is allowed. So all selected positions are at least 1 apart, but the only forbidden distance is 4. So between any two selected positions, their difference should not be 4.Let me check a few examples:- 1 (path1) and 5 (path1): not selected, so okay.- 1 and 2: difference 1, okay.- 1 and 3: difference 2, okay.- 1 and 4: difference 3, okay.- 1 and 9: difference 8, okay.- 2 and 6: 2 is selected, 6 is not, so okay.- 2 and 3: difference 1, okay.- 3 and 7: 3 is selected, 7 is not, okay.- 4 and 8: 4 is selected, 8 is not, okay.- 9 (path1) and 13 (path1): not selected, okay.- 9 and 10 (path2): difference 1, okay.- 10 and 11 (path3): difference 1, okay.- 11 and 12 (path4): difference1, okay.- 12 and 13 (path1): difference1, okay.Wait, but in our selection, path1 has 1,9,17; path2 has 2,10,18; path3 has 3,11,19; path4 has 4,12,20.So looking at position 17 (path1) and 18 (path2): difference1, okay.19 (path3) and 20 (path4): difference1, okay.All the selected positions are at differences that are not 4. Therefore, this selection of 12 maple trees is valid.But wait, 4 paths, each contributing 3 M&#39;s, totaling 12. But 4*5=20 positions, but since we have 4 paths each with 5 nodes, and selecting 3 from each, that&#39;s 12. But let me count how many positions are actually selected:Path1:1,9,17Path2:2,10,18Path3:3,11,19Path4:4,12,20That&#39;s 3*4=12 positions. So 12 maple trees. But the total positions are 20. So 12 out of 20. Is this the maximum?But wait, maybe there&#39;s a way to arrange more than 12. Let me see. Let&#39;s try to see if this is actually the maximum.Alternatively, suppose we use a different arrangement. Let&#39;s try to place M&#39;s every other position. So M, S, M, S,... This would give 10 M&#39;s. But check if any two M&#39;s are 4 apart. The distance between M&#39;s would be 2 positions (since they&#39;re every other). So, the number of trees between them is 1, which is allowed. Wait, but wait: positions 1 and 3 would be 2 apart (distance 2), so trees between them is 1. That&#39;s okay. Similarly, positions 3 and 5: distance 2, trees between is1. Wait, but 1 and 5: distance 4, which is forbidden. So if we place M&#39;s at 1,3,5,7,... then 1 and 5 are 4 apart, which is invalid. So this arrangement doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, placing M&#39;s every other position would result in some pairs being 4 apart, which is forbidden.Therefore, the maximum can&#39;t be 10. Hmm. So perhaps the previous approach of 12 is better. Wait, but how come? If 12 is possible, that seems higher than 10. But how is that possible? Because 12 is more than half. Wait, but in the previous arrangement, we are placing M&#39;s in 12 positions without any two being 4 apart. That seems correct.Wait, let me check again. If we have M&#39;s at positions 1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12,17,18,19,20. Wait, but that&#39;s not the case. The previous selection was 1,9,17; 2,10,18; 3,11,19; 4,12,20. So that&#39;s 12 positions. For example, in the first five positions: 1,2,3,4,5. M&#39;s at 1,2,3,4. Then next five:6,7,8,9,10. M&#39;s at9,10. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the selection is spread out. Let me list all selected positions:1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12,17,18,19,20. So in the first 4 positions, M&#39;s are at 1,2,3,4. Then positions 5-8 have no M&#39;s. Then positions9-12 have M&#39;s, 17-20 have M&#39;s. Wait, but the distance between 4 and9 is5, which is allowed. Between 12 and17 is5, allowed. So all selected M&#39;s are spaced either next to each other or with gaps larger than4. But between 1 and2, the distance is1, which is allowed. So even adjacent M&#39;s are allowed. The only forbidden distance is4. Therefore, having consecutive M&#39;s is okay.But wait, the problem says &quot;the number of trees between any two maple trees cannot be equal to3&quot;. So if two maple trees are adjacent, there are0 trees between them, which is allowed. If they have1 tree between, that&#39;s allowed. Similarly, 2 trees, allowed. 3 trees forbidden, 4 trees allowed, etc. So in our selection of 12 M&#39;s, we have many adjacent M&#39;s (positions1-4,9-12,17-20). But adjacent M&#39;s are allowed. The only restriction is when there are exactly3 trees between them. So for example, M at1 and M at5 would have3 trees between (positions2,3,4), which is forbidden. But in our selection, there are no M&#39;s at5,6,7,8,13,14,15,16. So all forbidden distances are avoided.Therefore, the arrangement with12 M&#39;s is valid. But the question is, can we have more than12?Wait, let&#39;s try. Suppose we try to add another M somewhere. Let&#39;s say we add an M at position5. Now, check the distances. Position5 is4 apart from1. Since1 is already an M, we can&#39;t have5. Similarly, if we add an M at position6, which is4 apart from2 (which is an M). Similarly, position7 is4 apart from3, and position8 is4 apart from4. So we can&#39;t add M&#39;s at5,6,7,8. Similarly, positions13,14,15,16 are4 apart from9,10,11,12. So adding M&#39;s there would conflict. Positions17-20 are already M&#39;s. So there&#39;s nowhere to add an M without conflicting. Therefore, 12 seems to be the maximum.But let&#39;s see another approach. Suppose instead of dividing into four paths, we use a different partitioning. For example, if we can find a pattern that repeats every 5 positions, allowing 3 M&#39;s in each 5-position block. Then, over 20 positions, we&#39;d have4 blocks *3 =12 M&#39;s. Which matches the previous result. So perhaps 12 is indeed the maximum.Alternatively, suppose we try a different pattern. Let&#39;s consider placing M&#39;s with spacing of 1,2,1,2,... etc. For example, M, M, S, M, M, S,... This would have two M&#39;s followed by one S. Let&#39;s check the distances. For example, M at1, M at2: distance1 (allowed). Then S at3, M at4: distance between2 and4 is2 (allowed). Then M at5: distance between4 and5 is1 (allowed). Wait, but M at4 and M at5: distance1, allowed. However, between M at1 and M at5: distance4, which is forbidden. So this arrangement is invalid because positions1 and5 would be4 apart, which is not allowed. So this pattern doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, try spacing M&#39;s with at least4 positions apart. Wait, but that would lead to fewer M&#39;s. For example, placing an M every5 positions would give4 M&#39;s (positions1,6,11,16). But we know we can do better.Wait, another idea: since the forbidden distance is4, maybe we can use a pattern that avoids this distance by grouping M&#39;s in clusters where within the cluster, M&#39;s are spaced by less than4, and between clusters, spaced by more than4.For example, cluster of2 M&#39;s (distance1), then skip3 positions, then another cluster. Let&#39;s see:Positions1,2 (cluster), then skip3 positions (positions3,4,5), then cluster at6,7, skip8,9,10, etc. Wait, the distance between cluster at2 and6 is4 (positions3,4,5 between), which is forbidden. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, clusters of3 M&#39;s with spacing1, then skip4 positions. But again, the skip of4 positions would create forbidden distances.Alternatively, maybe interleave small clusters with safe gaps. This is getting complicated. Maybe the initial approach of dividing into four paths and getting12 M&#39;s is actually the optimal.But let&#39;s verify with smaller cases. Let&#39;s take n=5. How many M&#39;s can we place? If we follow the 12 M&#39;s pattern, for n=5, per path it would be1 M (since 5 nodes, MIS=3). Wait, no. Wait, in the original problem, n=20 divided into four paths of5 nodes each. For n=5, it&#39;s one path. Wait, perhaps my earlier reasoning was flawed.Wait, let me test n=5. If we have5 positions, and want to place M&#39;s such that no two are4 apart. So possible placements:Option1: place M at1, then cannot place at5. Then can place at2,3,4. But placing at2 would restrict6, which is beyond. So maximum M&#39;s? Let&#39;s see.If we place M at1, we can&#39;t place at5. Then positions2,3,4 can be M&#39;s. But if we place at2, no conflict with1, since distance1. Placing at3, distance2 from1, allowed. Placing at4, distance3 from1, allowed. So total M&#39;s:1,2,3,4. That&#39;s4 M&#39;s. But wait, check distances between them:1 and2: distance1, allowed.1 and3:2, allowed.1 and4:3, allowed.2 and3:1, allowed.2 and4:2, allowed.3 and4:1, allowed.But wait, the forbidden distance is4. None of these pairs are4 apart. So in5 positions, maximum M&#39;s is4. But according to our earlier method, for a single path of5 nodes, the maximum independent set is3. Which contradicts. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my earlier reasoning.Wait, so in the graph where each node is connected to the node4 apart, for n=5, the graph is1-5-9-... but for n=5, it&#39;s just1 connected to5. So the graph is two disconnected nodes1 and5, and nodes2,3,4 are isolated. Therefore, the maximum independent set would be3 (nodes1,2,3,4) or similar. Wait, but nodes2,3,4 are not connected to anything. So maximum independent set would be all nodes except those connected. Since1 and5 are connected, you can choose at most one of them, and then all others. So maximum independent set is1 (either1 or5) +3 (2,3,4)=4. Which matches the manual count.Therefore, my earlier assertion that the maximum independent set for a path of5 nodes is3 was wrong. Because in reality, the graph isn&#39;t a path but a set of disconnected edges and isolated nodes. Therefore, the maximum independent set for each of the four paths (1-5-9-13-17, etc.) is actually higher.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the graph structure. Each of the four paths (1-5-9-13-17, etc.) is actually a linear chain where each node is connected to the next one 4 positions ahead. So for example, in path1:1 connected to5,5 connected to9,9 connected to13,13 connected to17. So it&#39;s a path graph of5 nodes connected sequentially. Therefore, the maximum independent set for this path would indeed follow the standard path graph MIS recurrence.But in the case of n=5 (positions1-5), it&#39;s only1-5 connected, and nodes2,3,4 are isolated. So that&#39;s a different structure. So perhaps the initial problem&#39;s graph is not exactly four separate path graphs but a combination.Wait, perhaps my original partitioning into four separate paths is incorrect. Let me think again.If we model the forbidden distance as edges between nodes i and i+4, then the graph consists of multiple components. For example:- Starting from1:1-5-9-13-17- Starting from2:2-6-10-14-18- Starting from3:3-7-11-15-19- Starting from4:4-8-12-16-20So each of these is a path of5 nodes. Therefore, each is a linear chain of5 nodes where each node is connected to the next one 4 positions ahead. Therefore, each of these is a path graph with5 nodes. Then, the maximum independent set for each path graph of5 nodes is indeed3, as per the standard MIS recurrence.Wait, but in the earlier n=5 case, if it&#39;s a path graph of5 nodes connected as1-5-9-13-17, but actually in n=5, the path would be1-5 only, since9 is beyond. So in the general case, for each starting position1-4, we have a path of5 nodes:1,5,9,13,17;2,6,10,14,18; etc.Therefore, each path is indeed length5 (5 nodes), connected sequentially. So each path is a linear chain of5 nodes. Then, applying the MIS formula:For a path of5 nodes, MIS=3. Therefore, each of the four paths can contribute3 M&#39;s, totaling12. As previously calculated.But in the n=5 case, if we only have1-5, which is a path of2 nodes, MIS=1. Then nodes2,3,4 are isolated, so MIS for the entire graph would be1 +3=4, which matches.Therefore, returning to the original problem: four separate paths, each with5 nodes, each contributing3 M&#39;s, totaling12. This seems valid. However, when we tried to place4 M&#39;s in n=5, that was possible because nodes2,3,4 are isolated and can all be selected. But in the original problem&#39;s graph, the four paths are entirely separate, meaning that the M&#39;s chosen in one path don&#39;t conflict with M&#39;s in another path. Therefore, the total is indeed4 paths *3 M&#39;s=12.But wait, in the original problem, the four paths are separate in terms of connections (no edges between them), but the nodes themselves are interleaved in the 20 positions. Therefore, when selecting M&#39;s from different paths, we need to ensure that no two M&#39;s from different paths are4 apart. Wait, but in our initial selection, for example, M at1 (path1) and M at5 (path1) would be4 apart, but we didn&#39;t select5. However, M at1 (path1) and M at2 (path2) are1 apart, which is allowed. The forbidden distance is4, regardless of which path they are in. So even though the four paths are separate in terms of edges (i.e., edges only within each path), when considering the entire graph, nodes from different paths can still be4 apart.Wait, hold on. This is a critical mistake. In the original graph, nodes are connected if they are4 apart, regardless of which path they belong to. However, when we partitioned the nodes into four paths based on modulo5, we thought that edges only exist within each path. But actually, edges can exist between nodes from different paths if they are4 apart.For example, node1 (path1) is connected to node5 (path1). Node2 (path2) is connected to node6 (path2), etc. But node1 (path1) is also connected to node5 (path1), but what about node1 and node2? They are1 apart, which is allowed, so no edge. Similarly, node1 and node6: difference5, so no edge. Wait, connections are only between nodes4 apart. So node1 is connected to5,9,13,17. Node2 is connected to6,10,14,18. Etc. So actually, the four paths are entirely separate components. There are no edges between different paths because two nodes from different paths cannot be4 apart. Because if you take two nodes from different paths, their positions differ by some number not divisible by4. Wait, positions in path1 are1,5,9,13,17; positions in path2 are2,6,10,14,18; path3:3,7,11,15,19; path4:4,8,12,16,20. The difference between any two nodes from different paths would be (i - j) where i and j are in different modulo5 classes. So, for example, node1 (path1) and node2 (path2) differ by1, which is not4. Node1 and node6 (path2) differ by5, which is not4. Node1 and node3 (path3) differ by2, etc. Therefore, there are no edges between different paths. Therefore, the graph is actually four separate path components, each with5 nodes. Therefore, the maximum independent set is indeed the sum of the maximum independent sets of each component.Therefore, if each component (path of5 nodes) can have3 M&#39;s, then total is12. Therefore, the answer should be12.But to confirm, let&#39;s try to actually write out the 12 M&#39;s:Path1:1,9,17Path2:2,10,18Path3:3,11,19Path4:4,12,20So these are the selected positions. Now, let&#39;s check all pairs to ensure none are4 apart.Take1 and5:1 is selected,5 is not. 1 and9: distance8, okay.2 and6:2 is selected,6 is not.3 and7:3 is selected,7 is not.4 and8:4 is selected,8 is not.Similarly,9 and13:9 is selected,13 is not.10 and14:10 is selected,14 is not.11 and15:11 is selected,15 is not.12 and16:12 is selected,16 is not.17 and21:17 is selected,21 doesn&#39;t exist.18 and22: same.19 and23: same.20 and24: same.Now, check between different paths:1 and2: distance1, allowed.1 and3:2, allowed.1 and4:3, allowed.1 and10:9, allowed.Etc. All distances between selected M&#39;s are not4. Therefore, this configuration is valid.But let&#39;s check if we can add another M. Suppose we try to add position5. But position5 is connected to1 and9. Since1 and9 are already selected, we can&#39;t add5. Similarly, adding position6 would conflict with2 and10. Etc. So no extra M&#39;s can be added without violating the constraints. Therefore,12 is indeed the maximum.Alternatively, is there another configuration with more M&#39;s? Let&#39;s suppose we try a different selection. For example, let&#39;s try to include some overlapping M&#39;s from different paths.Wait, if we take positions1,2,3,4, then next M&#39;s at9,10,11,12, then17,18,19,20. That&#39;s12 M&#39;s, same as before. But also similar.Alternatively, suppose we do a more dense packing in some parts. For example, positions1,2,3,4, then skip5,6,7,8, then9,10,11,12, skip13,14,15,16, then17,18,19,20. That&#39;s4+4+4=12 M&#39;s. But same as before.Alternatively, what if we intersperse more M&#39;s in the middle. For example, include position5. But position5 is4 away from1, which is already an M. So can&#39;t do that. Similarly, position6 is4 away from2, etc. So no.Alternatively, perhaps place M&#39;s at positions1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12,17,18,19,20 and also add position16. But position16 is4 away from12. Since12 is already an M, can&#39;t add16. Similarly, position13 is4 away from9. Can&#39;t add13. So no.Therefore, it seems that12 is indeed the maximum number of M&#39;s possible.But to double-check, let&#39;s consider another approach. Let&#39;s model this as a graph where each node represents a position, and edges connect nodes that are4 apart. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set (MIS) of this graph. Since the graph is composed of four separate paths each with five nodes, and the MIS of each path is3, then the total MIS is4*3=12. Therefore, the answer is12.Therefore, the maximum number of maple trees is12.Final AnswerThe maximum number of maple trees that can be planted is boxed{12}.&lt;/think&gt;The problem requires planting 20 trees such that the number of trees between any two maple trees (not including the two maple trees) cannot be equal to 3. This means the distance between any two maple trees (in terms of positions) cannot be 4. To solve this, we model the problem as a graph where each position is a node, and edges connect nodes that are 4 positions apart. This graph can be divided into four separate paths, each representing positions modulo 5:- Path 1: positions 1, 5, 9, 13, 17- Path 2: positions 2, 6, 10, 14, 18- Path 3: positions 3, 7, 11, 15, 19- Path 4: positions 4, 8, 12, 16, 20Each path is a linear chain of 5 nodes. The maximum independent set (MIS) for a path of 5 nodes is 3. Therefore, each path can contribute 3 maple trees. Summing the MIS for all four paths:- Path 1 contributes 3 maple trees (positions 1, 9, 17)- Path 2 contributes 3 maple trees (positions 2, 10, 18)- Path 3 contributes 3 maple trees (positions 3, 11, 19)- Path 4 contributes 3 maple trees (positions 4, 12, 20)Thus, the total number of maple trees is (3 times 4 = 12).Verification confirms that no two selected positions are 4 apart, ensuring the constraint is satisfied. Therefore, the maximum number of maple trees that can be planted is (boxed{12}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-7ab06a9d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>🔑:</span>【Answer】 12【Solution】In any continuous eight trees, once a maple tree is planted, it means that another position can only plant a sycamore tree.

I need to find the measures of angles ROM, AOD, and the angle between the bisectors of AOC and BOR. First, let me visualize the problem. Lines AB and CD intersect at point O. So, AB and CD are two lines crossing each other at O. Then, there are three angle bisectors: OM bisects angle BOD, OT bisects angle DOM, and OR bisects angle COB. We&#39;re given that the measure of angle AOM is 130 degrees. Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. AB and CD intersect at O, creating vertical angles. Let&#39;s assume AB is horizontal and CD is vertical for simplicity. So, the four angles around O would be: AOC, COB, BOD, and DOA. These are all vertical angles, so opposite angles are equal. Now, OM is the bisector of angle BOD. So, angle BOD is one of the angles formed by the intersection, and OM splits it into two equal parts. Similarly, OR is the bisector of angle COB. So, OR splits angle COB into two equal parts. OT bisects angle DOM, but maybe we&#39;ll get to that later. Given that angle AOM is 130 degrees. Let me see: point M is on the bisector of BOD, so M is somewhere in the region of angle BOD. Since A is on line AB, and O is the intersection point, angle AOM would be formed by points A, O, M. Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates to make this clearer. Let&#39;s set point O at the origin (0,0). Let me assume AB is the x-axis, so A is on the left, B on the right. CD is the y-axis, so C is up and D is down. Then, angle AOC is 90 degrees if CD is perpendicular, but wait, the problem doesn&#39;t state that the lines are perpendicular. Hmm, right, they just intersect, so the angles could be any measure. But since angle bisectors are involved, maybe we can work with variables. Let me denote angle BOD as 2x, so that OM bisects it into two angles of x each. Similarly, angle COB is 2y, so OR bisects it into two angles of y each. Then, since lines AB and CD intersect at O, the sum of angles around O should be 360 degrees. So, angle AOC + angle COB + angle BOD + angle DOA = 360. But angle AOC and angle BOD are vertical angles, so they are equal. Similarly, angle COB and angle DOA are vertical angles. So, 2*(angle AOC) + 2*(angle COB) = 360, so angle AOC + angle COB = 180. But we have angle AOM given as 130 degrees. Let me see how that relates. Point M is on the bisector of angle BOD, which is 2x. So, angle BOM is x. Since AB is a line, angle AOB is 180 degrees. Then, angle AOM is angle AOB minus angle BOM? Wait, no. If O is the intersection, then points A, O, B are colinear, so angle AOB is a straight line, 180 degrees. Wait, angle AOM is formed by OA, O, and OM. So, OA is part of line AB, and OM is the bisector of angle BOD. So, angle AOM is the angle from OA to OM. Let me think. If AB and CD intersect at O, then the angles around O are as follows: starting from OA, going counterclockwise, we have angle AOC, then angle COB, then angle BOD, then angle DOA. Since OM is the bisector of angle BOD, which is between OB and OD. So, angle BOD is between OB and OD, and OM splits it into two equal parts. So, OM is in the interior of angle BOD. Therefore, angle BOM is x, and angle MOD is also x. Given that angle AOM is 130 degrees. Angle AOM is the angle from OA to OM. OA is along AB, and OM is inside angle BOD. Let me express angle AOM in terms of other angles. From OA to OM, that would cross angle AOC, angle COB, and then part of angle BOD. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s consider the positions. If AB is horizontal, with A on the left and B on the right, CD is another line intersecting at O. If D is below O and C is above, then angle BOD is the angle between OB and OD. So, from OB (right) to OD (down). The bisector OM would split that angle into two equal parts. So, from OB, moving down towards OD, OM is in the lower right quadrant. Then, angle AOM is the angle from OA (left) to OM (lower right). So, starting at OA (which is to the left of O), going through O, then to M. Wait, but OA is a line from O to A, so OA is the left direction. OM is a ray from O towards M, which is in the direction of the bisector of BOD. So, if BOD is the angle between OB (right) and OD (down), then the bisector OM is halfway between right and down, so it&#39;s pointing southeast. Therefore, angle AOM is the angle between OA (west) and OM (southeast). The measure of this angle is 130 degrees. Since OA is directly opposite to OB (east), the angle from OA to OB is 180 degrees. Then, angle AOM is 130 degrees, which is OA to OM, so angle between OA and OM is 130, meaning that angle between OM and OB is 50 degrees (since 180 - 130 = 50). But OM is the bisector of angle BOD. So, angle BOD is split into two angles of x each, so angle BOD = 2x. But angle between OM and OB is x, which we just found is 50 degrees. Therefore, x = 50 degrees, so angle BOD = 100 degrees. Since angle BOD is 100 degrees, then its vertical angle AOC is also 100 degrees. Then, the other angles around O, angle COB and angle DOA, should each be (360 - 2*100)/2 = 80 degrees. So, angle COB = 80 degrees and angle DOA = 80 degrees. Now, OR is the bisector of angle COB. Since angle COB is 80 degrees, OR divides it into two angles of 40 degrees each. So, angle COR = angle ROB = 40 degrees. Now, part a) asks for angle ROM. Let&#39;s find points R, O, M. ROM is the angle at O between OR and OM. OR is the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees), so OR is splitting angle COB into two 40-degree angles. So, starting from OC (up) to OR is 40 degrees, and from OR to OB (right) is 40 degrees. OM is the bisector of angle BOD (100 degrees), which is split into two 50-degree angles. So, from OB (right) to OM is 50 degrees, and from OM to OD (down) is 50 degrees. Therefore, OR is 40 degrees from OC towards OB, and OM is 50 degrees from OB towards OD. So, the angle between OR and OM would be the angle from OR to OB (40 degrees) plus the angle from OB to OM (50 degrees). So, 40 + 50 = 90 degrees. Wait, but angle ROM is the angle between OR and OM. Wait, OR is inside angle COB (from OC to OB), and OM is inside angle BOD (from OB to OD). So, the angle between OR and OM would be the angle from OR to OB (which is 40 degrees) plus the angle from OB to OM (which is 50 degrees). So, total angle ROM is 40 + 50 = 90 degrees. Therefore, angle ROM is 90 degrees. But let me confirm this. Let me consider the positions again. Point C is above O, B is to the right, D is below. OR bisects angle COB, so it&#39;s 40 degrees from OC and 40 degrees from OB. So, OR is in the upper right quadrant, 40 degrees from OC (which is vertical up). Then, OM is the bisector of BOD, which is 50 degrees from OB (right) towards OD (down). So, OM is in the lower right quadrant, 50 degrees below OB. So, from OR (which is 40 degrees above OB) to OM (50 degrees below OB), the angle between them is 40 + 50 = 90 degrees. That makes sense. So, angle ROM is 90 degrees. Therefore, part a) is 90 degrees. Now part b) asks for angle AOD. Angle AOD is the angle from OA to OD. Since OA is to the left and OD is down, we need to find the measure between them. From the earlier analysis, angle AOC is 100 degrees (vertical angle of BOD). Then, angle COB is 80 degrees, angle BOD is 100 degrees, and angle DOA is 80 degrees. Wait, but angle DOA is the angle from OD to OA. If angle DOA is 80 degrees, then angle AOD is also 80 degrees? Wait, but angle AOD would be the same as angle DOA? Wait, angles are measured in specific directions. If OA is left and OD is down, then angle AOD is the angle from OA to OD, which would be the same as angle DOA, but depending on the direction of measurement. Wait, angle at O between OA and OD. Since OA and OD are two rays from O, angle AOD is the angle between them. But in our earlier calculation, angle DOA was 80 degrees. Wait, perhaps we have some confusion here. Let me recall that when two lines intersect, the sum of adjacent angles is 180 degrees. So, angle AOD (from OA to OD) plus angle DOB (from OD to OB) should be 180 degrees. But angle DOB is part of angle BOD, which we found to be 100 degrees. Wait, angle BOD is 100 degrees, which is the angle from OB to OD. So, angle between OB and OD is 100 degrees. Wait, let me re-examine the angles around point O. When lines AB and CD intersect at O, they form four angles: 1. Angle AOC (between OA and OC)2. Angle COB (between OC and OB)3. Angle BOD (between OB and OD)4. Angle DOA (between OD and OA)These four angles add up to 360 degrees. We found angle BOD = 100 degrees (since its bisected by OM into two 50-degree angles, given angle AOM = 130 degrees). Then, angle AOC is also 100 degrees (vertical angles). Therefore, the remaining two angles, COB and DOA, sum to 160 degrees. Since they are vertical angles, each is 80 degrees. Therefore, angle COB = 80 degrees, angle DOA = 80 degrees. Therefore, angle AOD is the same as angle DOA, which is 80 degrees. But angle AOD is measured from OA to OD, which is the same as angle DOA. However, angles are typically measured as the smallest angle between the two rays. But since OA and OD are in different directions (OA is left, OD is down), the angle between them could be 80 degrees or 280 degrees, depending on direction. But in geometry, we usually take the smaller angle. But according to our calculation, angle DOA is 80 degrees. So, angle AOD is 80 degrees. Wait, but let me confirm. If angle DOA is 80 degrees, then from D to O to A is 80 degrees. So, angle AOD is the same as angle DOA, which is 80 degrees. So, yes, angle AOD is 80 degrees. Therefore, part b) is 80 degrees. Now part c) asks for the measure of the angle between the bisectors of angles AOC and BOR. First, let&#39;s identify the bisectors. The bisector of angle AOC and the bisector of angle BOR. Angle AOC is 100 degrees, as established earlier. So, its bisector will split it into two angles of 50 degrees each. Let&#39;s call this bisector OQ (assuming Q is some point). Angle BOR: Let&#39;s find angle BOR first. OR is the bisector of angle COB, which is 80 degrees, so angle ROB is 40 degrees. Therefore, angle BOR is 40 degrees. Wait, but we need to bisect angle BOR. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;the bisectors of angles AOC and BOR&quot;. So, first, angle AOC is 100 degrees, bisected into two 50-degree angles. Then, angle BOR is... Let&#39;s see. First, where is point R? OR is the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees), so angle COR = angle ROB = 40 degrees each. Therefore, angle BOR is 40 degrees. So, angle BOR is 40 degrees. Then, the bisector of angle BOR will split this 40-degree angle into two 20-degree angles. Therefore, the bisector of angle AOC (which is 100 degrees) is a ray that splits it into 50 degrees each. The bisector of angle BOR (40 degrees) is a ray that splits it into 20 degrees each. We need to find the angle between these two bisectors. Let me try to visualize this. First, angle AOC is 100 degrees. Since A is to the left, O is the origin, and C is up, angle AOC is between OA and OC. Its bisector OQ will be a ray that splits angle AOC into two 50-degree angles. So, starting from OA (left), moving up 50 degrees towards OC. So, OQ is in the upper left quadrant, 50 degrees above OA. Angle BOR is 40 degrees. Angle BOR is between BO (which is to the right, along OB) and OR. Since OR is the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees), which is 40 degrees from both OC and OB. So, OR is 40 degrees above OB. Therefore, angle BOR is the angle from OB to OR, which is 40 degrees. Therefore, the bisector of angle BOR will be a ray that splits this 40-degree angle into two 20-degree angles. Let&#39;s call this bisector OS. So, OS is 20 degrees above OB towards OR. Now, we need to find the angle between OQ (bisector of AOC) and OS (bisector of BOR). To find this angle, we need to determine their positions relative to each other. First, OQ is in the upper left quadrant, 50 degrees above OA (which is left). So, from OA, moving up 50 degrees towards OC. Since OA is left, OQ is in the direction of 180 - 50 = 130 degrees from the positive x-axis (if we take OB as positive x-axis). On the other hand, OS is the bisector of angle BOR, which is 20 degrees above OB (which is the positive x-axis). So, OS is at 20 degrees from OB towards OR. Therefore, the angle between OQ and OS would be the difference between their respective directions. If we consider the positive x-axis as OB (0 degrees), then OS is at 20 degrees (above OB), and OQ is at 180 - 50 = 130 degrees from the positive x-axis. Therefore, the angle between them is 130 - 20 = 110 degrees. However, we need to check if this is the smaller angle or the larger one. Since 110 degrees is less than 180, that&#39;s the angle between them. But let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, since OQ is the bisector of AOC (100 degrees), which is in the upper left. Angle AOC is between OA (left) and OC (up). The bisector OQ is 50 degrees from OA towards OC. OS is the bisector of BOR (40 degrees), which is 20 degrees above OB (right). To find the angle between OQ and OS, we can consider the total angles around point O. From OA to OC is 100 degrees. The bisector OQ is 50 degrees from OA. Then, from OC to OB is 80 degrees (angle COB). OR is 40 degrees from OC, so 40 degrees towards OB. Then, angle BOR is 40 degrees, bisected by OS into 20 degrees. Alternatively, the angle between OQ and OS can be calculated by adding the angles from OQ to OC, then OC to OR, then OR to OS. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let&#39;s use coordinates. Let&#39;s assign coordinates with O at the origin. Let’s set OB as the positive x-axis and OC as the positive y-axis. Wait, but in the original problem, lines AB and CD intersect at O. If we take AB as the x-axis (from left A to right B) and CD as another line intersecting at O. Let me assign coordinates properly. Let’s define:- OA is along the negative x-axis (A is left of O).- OB is along the positive x-axis (B is right of O).- OC is along the positive y-axis (C is above O).- OD is along some direction, but since angle BOD is 100 degrees, OD is 100 degrees from OB (positive x-axis) downwards. Wait, angle BOD is 100 degrees, so from OB to OD is 100 degrees. So, if OB is positive x-axis, OD is 100 degrees below OB, which would be in the direction of 180 - 100 = 80 degrees from the positive y-axis. Wait, maybe better to use standard position.Alternatively, since angle BOD is 100 degrees, and OM is its bisector, so angle BOM is 50 degrees. Therefore, OM is at 50 degrees below the positive x-axis (OB). So, OM is in the fourth quadrant, 50 degrees below the x-axis.OR is the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees). Since angle COB is between OC (positive y-axis) and OB (positive x-axis), which is 80 degrees. Therefore, OR bisects this 80 degrees into two 40-degree angles. Therefore, OR is 40 degrees below the positive y-axis? Wait, no. If angle COB is from OC (positive y-axis) to OB (positive x-axis), then OR bisects this angle. So, starting at OC (positive y-axis), moving 40 degrees towards OB (positive x-axis). Therefore, OR is in the direction of 90 - 40 = 50 degrees from the positive x-axis. So, OR is at 50 degrees above the positive x-axis.Wait, this seems conflicting with my earlier analysis. Let me clarify. If angle COB is 80 degrees between OC (positive y-axis) and OB (positive x-axis), then the angle between positive y-axis and positive x-axis is 80 degrees. So, that would mean that line CD is not perpendicular to AB. If the angle between OC (positive y-axis) and OB (positive x-axis) is 80 degrees, then the line CD is at an 80-degree angle from AB. But this complicates things. Maybe it&#39;s better to use coordinate system with AB along x-axis and OC somewhere in the plane. Alternatively, let&#39;s use standard angles. Let me set OB as the positive x-axis. Then OA is the negative x-axis. Angle COB is 80 degrees, so OC is 80 degrees above OB (positive x-axis). Wait, angle COB is between OC and OB, which is 80 degrees. Therefore, OC is 80 degrees above OB. Therefore, OC is in the direction of 80 degrees from the positive x-axis. Wait, but that would mean that line CD is at 80 degrees from AB (the x-axis). Then, angle between AB and CD is 80 degrees. Then, angle AOC, which is between OA (negative x-axis) and OC (80 degrees from positive x-axis), is 180 - 80 = 100 degrees, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, OC is at 80 degrees from the positive x-axis (OB), so its direction is 80 degrees. Then, OD is the opposite direction from OC, so OD is 80 degrees + 180 degrees = 260 degrees from the positive x-axis, which is equivalent to -80 degrees (260 - 360 = -100, wait, maybe I&#39;m miscalculating). Wait, since lines AB and CD intersect at O, then CD is a straight line, so OC and OD are opposite directions. Therefore, if OC is at 80 degrees from positive x-axis, then OD is at 80 degrees + 180 degrees = 260 degrees from positive x-axis, which is 260 - 180 = 80 degrees below the negative x-axis. So, OD is in the direction of 80 degrees below the negative x-axis. But angle BOD is 100 degrees. Let&#39;s confirm. Angle between OB (positive x-axis) and OD (260 degrees) is 260 - 0 = 260 degrees, but the smaller angle is 100 degrees, which is correct since 260 - 180 = 80, but 180 - 80 = 100. Wait, no. The angle between two directions is the absolute difference, but if it&#39;s more than 180, subtract from 360. The angle between OB (0 degrees) and OD (260 degrees) is min(|260 - 0|, 360 - |260 - 0|) = min(260, 100) = 100 degrees. Yes, that matches. So, angle BOD is 100 degrees, as given. Now, the bisector of angle AOC (100 degrees). Angle AOC is between OA (negative x-axis) and OC (80 degrees from positive x-axis). The bisector OQ will split this 100-degree angle into two 50-degree angles. Starting from OA (negative x-axis), moving 50 degrees towards OC. Since OA is at 180 degrees, moving 50 degrees towards OC (which is at 80 degrees). So, the direction of OQ is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees from the positive x-axis. So, OQ is in the second quadrant, 50 degrees above the negative x-axis. The bisector of angle BOR. Angle BOR is 40 degrees. Let&#39;s see, OR is the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees), so OR is at 40 degrees from OC (80 degrees) towards OB (0 degrees). So, OR is at 80 - 40 = 40 degrees from the positive x-axis. Therefore, OR is at 40 degrees. Angle BOR is the angle between OB (0 degrees) and OR (40 degrees), which is 40 degrees. The bisector of angle BOR will split this 40-degree angle into two 20-degree angles. Therefore, the bisector OS is at 20 degrees from OB towards OR. So, OS is at 0 + 20 = 20 degrees from the positive x-axis. Now, we have OQ at 130 degrees and OS at 20 degrees. The angle between them is the difference between 130 and 20, which is 110 degrees. Since 110 degrees is less than 180, that&#39;s the angle between them. Therefore, the measure of the angle between the bisectors of angles AOC and BOR is 110 degrees. But let me check once more to avoid mistakes. OQ is the bisector of AOC (100 degrees), located at 130 degrees (180 - 50). OS is the bisector of BOR (40 degrees), located at 20 degrees. The angle between 130 and 20 degrees. To compute the angle between two directions, subtract the smaller from the larger: 130 - 20 = 110 degrees. Since this is less than 180, it&#39;s the correct angle. Therefore, part c) is 110 degrees. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn&#39;t skip anything:1. Given angle AOM = 130 degrees. OM bisects BOD. Found that angle BOD = 100 degrees, so angle AOC = 100 degrees. 2. Calculated remaining angles around O as 80 degrees each (COB and DOA). 3. For part a), angle ROM is between OR (bisector of COB) and OM (bisector of BOD). Calculated their positions leading to 90 degrees. 4. For part b), angle AOD is equal to angle DOA = 80 degrees. 5. For part c), determined bisectors of AOC (100 degrees) and BOR (40 degrees) are at 130 degrees and 20 degrees respectively, leading to an angle of 110 degrees between them. Seems consistent. Final Answera) boxed{90^circ}b) boxed{80^circ}c) boxed{110^circ}&lt;/think&gt;Given lines AB and CD intersect at point O. Rays OM, OT, and OR are the bisectors of angles ∠BOD, ∠DOM, and ∠COB respectively. We know that ( mathrm{m}(angle mathrm{AOM}) = 130^circ ). Summary of Steps:1. Angle BOD Calculation:   - OM bisects ∠BOD. Given ( mathrm{m}(angle mathrm{AOM}) = 130^circ ), we find that ∠BOM (half of ∠BOD) is 50°, making ∠BOD = 100°.   - Vertical angles ∠AOC is also 100°.2. Remaining Angles Around O:   - The sum of angles around O is 360°. Subtracting 200° (from ∠AOC and ∠BOD), the remaining angles ∠COB and ∠DOA are each 80°.3. Bisectors:   - OR bisects ∠COB (80°) into two 40° angles.   - OM bisects ∠BOD (100°) into two 50° angles. Detailed Solutions:a) Measure of ∠ROM:- OR bisects ∠COB (80°) into 40° each.- OM bisects ∠BOD (100°) into 50° each.- ∠ROM is the sum of the angles from OR to OB (40°) and from OB to OM (50°), resulting in ( 40^circ + 50^circ = 90^circ ).b) Measure of ∠AOD:- ∠DOA is 80°, which is the same as ∠AOD when measured as the smallest angle between OA and OD.c) Angle Between Bisectors of ∠AOC and ∠BOR:- Bisector of ∠AOC (100°) splits it into 50° each, positioned at 130° from the positive x-axis.- Bisector of ∠BOR (40°) splits it into 20° each, positioned at 20° from the positive x-axis.- The angle between these bisectors is ( 130^circ - 20^circ = 110^circ ). Final Answers:a) (boxed{90^circ})b) (boxed{80^circ})c) (boxed{110^circ}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me start by understanding the given information and what needs to be found. We have lines AB and CD intersecting at point O. There are three angle bisectors: OM, OT, and OR. Specifically, OM is the bisector of angle BOD, OT is the bisector of angle DOM, and OR is the bisector of angle COB. We&#39;re given that the measure of angle AOM is 130 degrees, and we need to calculate three things: a) the measure of angle ROM, b) the measure of angle AOD, and c) the measure of the angle between the bisectors of angles AOC and BOR.First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me sketch lines AB and CD intersecting at O. Since they intersect, they form vertical angles. Let me label the points: AB is a line, so points A and B are on either side of O, and CD is another line intersecting AB at O, so points C and D are on the other two sides. Now, angles around point O will add up to 360 degrees.Now, the bisectors. OM is the bisector of angle BOD. So, angle BOD is one of the angles formed by the intersection of AB and CD. Let me see: when two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. If AB and CD intersect at O, then angle AOC and angle BOD are vertical angles, as well as angles AOD and BOC. Wait, no. Let me confirm. If AB is a straight line and CD crosses it at O, then angles around O would be angles like AOC, COB, BOD, and DOA. Hmm. Maybe I need to clarify.Wait, angle BOD is the angle formed by points B, O, D. So, points B and D are on opposite sides of O. Since AB is a line, B is on one end, and D is on the line CD. So, angle BOD is between BO and OD. Similarly, angle DOM would be between DO and OM, but OM is a bisector. Wait, this might get confusing. Let me try to be precise.Let me consider the intersection at O. AB is a line, so points A and B are on opposite sides of O. Similarly, CD is another line, so points C and D are on opposite sides of O. So, the four angles around O are AOC, COB, BOD, and DOA. These four angles add up to 360 degrees. Since they are formed by two intersecting lines, the vertical angles are equal: angle AOC equals angle BOD, and angle COB equals angle AOD.Given that, OM is the bisector of angle BOD. So, angle BOD is split into two equal parts by OM. Similarly, OT is the bisector of angle DOM. Wait, angle DOM is part of angle BOD? Because OM is already the bisector of BOD, so angle DOM would be half of BOD, and then OT is bisecting that. Hmm. Then OR is the bisector of angle COB. So, angle COB is split into two equal parts by OR.We also know that the measure of angle AOM is 130 degrees. Angle AOM is the angle from AO to OM. Since AO is part of line AB, and OM is the bisector of angle BOD. So, angle AOM is formed by going from AO to OM, passing through some portion around point O.Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s note that angles around point O sum to 360 degrees. Let&#39;s denote the measures of the angles as follows:- Let angle AOC = x degrees. Then, vertical angle BOD is also x degrees.- Then, the other two angles, COB and AOD, would each be (180 - x) degrees because angles on a straight line sum to 180. Wait, no. Wait, when two lines intersect, the sum of adjacent angles is 180. So, angle AOC + angle COB = 180 degrees, as they are adjacent and form a linear pair. Similarly, angle COB + angle BOD = 180 degrees, and so on. Therefore, if angle AOC = x degrees, then angle COB = 180 - x degrees, angle BOD = x degrees (vertical angle), and angle AOD = 180 - x degrees.So, angles at point O: AOC = x, COB = 180 - x, BOD = x, and DOA = 180 - x.Now, OM is the bisector of angle BOD. Since angle BOD is x degrees, bisecting it would create two angles of x/2 degrees each. So, angle BOM = angle MOD = x/2.Similarly, OT is the bisector of angle DOM. Wait, angle DOM is part of angle BOD, which has already been bisected by OM. So, angle DOM is angle DOM, which is x/2 degrees (since MOD is x/2). Then, OT bisects angle DOM, so each of those smaller angles would be (x/2)/2 = x/4 degrees. Therefore, angle DOT = angle TOM = x/4 degrees.OR is the bisector of angle COB. Angle COB is 180 - x degrees, so bisecting it would create two angles of (180 - x)/2 degrees each. So, angle COR = angle ROB = (180 - x)/2 degrees.We are given that the measure of angle AOM is 130 degrees. Let&#39;s figure out what angle AOM corresponds to. AOM is the angle from AO to OM. Let&#39;s consider the direction. Starting from AO, which is part of line AB, moving towards OM, which is the bisector of angle BOD.Angle AOM would be angle AOM = angle AOC + angle COM. Wait, not necessarily. Let me think. AO is one side (from A to O), and OM is the bisector. Depending on where OM is located, the angle from AO to OM could be a combination of angles. Let me try to visualize.Since OM is the bisector of angle BOD, which is x degrees. So, angle BOD is between BO and OD, and OM splits it into two equal parts. So, OM is a ray starting at O, going between B and D. So, starting from AO, which is on the opposite side of BO. Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the full circle around point O.If we imagine point O as the center, with lines AB and CD crossing at O. Then, angle AOM is from AO to OM. If AO is part of line AB, going towards A, and OM is the bisector of BOD. Let&#39;s consider the positions.Since angle BOD is between BO and OD, and OM bisects it, so OM is in the interior of angle BOD. So, from point O, the ray OM is going into the angle BOD, splitting it into two parts. Therefore, to get from AO to OM, we have to go from AO, which is adjacent to angle AOC, through angle COB, then through angle BOM. Wait, maybe.Wait, AO is one ray, and OM is another ray. The angle between them, angle AOM, is formed by rotating from AO to OM. So, the measure of angle AOM would be equal to the sum of angle AOC, angle COB, and angle BOM? Wait, no. Let me think again.If AO is one arm, then going counterclockwise (assuming standard position), the angles around O would be AO to CO (angle AOC), CO to BO (angle COB), BO to DO (angle BOD), and DO to AO (angle DOA). But OM is the bisector of BOD, so between BO and OD. So, angle from AO to OM would be angle AOM, which is composed of angle AOC + angle COM? Wait, maybe not. Let me think step by step.Alternatively, let&#39;s assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place point O at the origin. Let me assume line AB is the x-axis, with A on the positive x side and B on the negative x side. Line CD is then crossing AB at O, let&#39;s say forming some angles. Let me assume line CD is in the plane, making angles with AB. Then, angles can be measured accordingly.But maybe a better approach is to use variables for the angles and set up equations.Given that angle AOM is 130 degrees. Let&#39;s express angle AOM in terms of x. Since angle AOM is from AO to OM, and OM is the bisector of angle BOD (which is x degrees), so OM splits angle BOD into two angles of x/2 each. Therefore, angle BOM is x/2. Then, angle AOM would be angle AOB (which is 180 degrees, since AB is a straight line) minus angle BOM. Wait, AO is from A to O, and OM is the bisector. Wait, maybe not. Wait, angle AOM is formed by AO and OM. If AO is along one direction, and OM is somewhere else.Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions again. Let me think of point O with four quadrants formed by AB and CD. Let&#39;s say AB is horizontal, CD is vertical. Then, AO is to the right, BO to the left, CO up, and DO down. Then, angle BOD is the angle from BO to DO, which would be 180 degrees if CD is straight, but since CD is a line, angle BOD is actually 180 degrees. Wait, no, if AB and CD intersect, then they form angles less than 180. Wait, perhaps my coordinate system is conflicting.Wait, maybe the confusion comes from how the lines intersect. Let me try again. Let me suppose AB is a horizontal line, with A to the right and B to the left of O. CD is another line intersecting AB at O, making an &#39;X&#39; shape. So, C is above O and D is below O. Then, angle BOD is the angle from BO (left) to OD (down), which would be some acute or obtuse angle depending on the slope of CD.But in this case, lines AB and CD intersect, so vertical angles are equal. Let&#39;s suppose angle AOC is x degrees, so angle BOD is also x degrees, and angles COB and AOD are each 180 - x degrees.Now, OM bisects angle BOD (x degrees), so angle BOM is x/2 degrees. Similarly, OT bisects angle DOM. Since angle DOM is part of angle BOD, which has already been bisected by OM, angle DOM is angle from DO to OM, which is x/2 degrees. So OT bisects angle DOM into two angles of x/4 degrees each. Then, OR is the bisector of angle COB (180 - x degrees), so angle COR is (180 - x)/2 degrees.Now, angle AOM is given as 130 degrees. Let&#39;s find angle AOM in terms of x. Angle AOM is from AO (right) to OM. Since AO is on AB (right), and OM is the bisector of angle BOD (which is x degrees). So, starting at AO, going counterclockwise to OM. How much is that?Let&#39;s see. If we start at AO, moving counterclockwise around O, the angles would be AOC = x degrees, then angle COM = ? Wait, not sure. Wait, after AO, the next angle is AOC, which is x degrees, then angle COB, which is 180 - x degrees, then angle BOD, which is x degrees, and so on.But OM is in angle BOD. So, starting from AO, going to OC is x degrees, then from OC to OB is 180 - x degrees, then from OB to OM is angle BOM, which is x/2 degrees. So, angle AOM would be angle AOC + angle COB + angle BOM = x + (180 - x) + x/2 = 180 + x/2 degrees. But this equals 130 degrees? Wait, that can&#39;t be, because 180 + x/2 = 130 implies x/2 = -50, which is impossible.Hmm, that suggests my reasoning is flawed. Maybe the direction is clockwise instead. Let me try again.If angle AOM is 130 degrees, starting from AO and moving clockwise to OM. Then, angle AOM would consist of angle AOD (which is 180 - x degrees) plus angle DOM (x/2 degrees). Wait, angle AOD is from AO to OD, which is 180 - x degrees. Then, from OD to OM is angle DOM, which is x/2 degrees (since OM bisects BOD). Wait, but angle DOM is part of the bisected angle. If OM bisects BOD, which is x degrees, then MOD is x/2. So, angle DOM would be the same as MOD, which is x/2. Therefore, angle AOM, going clockwise from AO to OM, would be angle AOD + angle DOM = (180 - x) + (x/2) = 180 - x/2 degrees. According to the problem, angle AOM is 130 degrees, so:180 - x/2 = 130Solving for x:180 - 130 = x/250 = x/2x = 100 degreesSo angle AOC and angle BOD are 100 degrees each, and angles COB and AOD are 80 degrees each (since 180 - x = 80). Let me confirm this.If x = 100, then angle BOD is 100 degrees, bisected by OM into two angles of 50 degrees each. Then angle AOM, going clockwise from AO to OM, is angle AOD (80 degrees) + angle DOM (50 degrees) = 130 degrees. That matches the given information. Perfect.So, x = 100 degrees.Therefore, we now have:- angle AOC = 100°- angle COB = 80°- angle BOD = 100°- angle AOD = 80°Now, moving to part a) Calculate measure of angle ROM.First, we need to figure out where points R and M are located.OR is the bisector of angle COB. Angle COB is 80 degrees, so bisected by OR, meaning angle COR = angle ROB = 40 degrees each.OM is the bisector of angle BOD (100 degrees), so angle BOM = angle MOD = 50 degrees each.We need to find angle ROM. So, angle from RO to MO. Let&#39;s see where R and M are.Since OR bisects angle COB (80 degrees), which is the angle from CO to BO. So, starting from CO (upwards), OR splits it into two 40-degree angles. Therefore, OR is a ray inside angle COB, 40 degrees from both CO and BO.Similarly, OM is the bisector of angle BOD (100 degrees), so it&#39;s 50 degrees from BO and 50 degrees from OD.So, point R is in the angle COB, 40 degrees from CO and BO, and point M is in angle BOD, 50 degrees from BO and OD.To find angle ROM, we need to determine the angle between OR and OM.Let&#39;s consider their positions. Starting from point O, OR is 40 degrees from BO towards CO. OM is 50 degrees from BO towards OD. Wait, no. Wait, OR is in angle COB, which is between CO and BO. So, OR is going from O towards somewhere between C and B. While OM is in angle BOD, between B and D.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the angle between OR and OM by considering the sum of angles around point O.Alternatively, since we know the positions of OR and OM relative to BO, perhaps we can compute the angle between them.OR is in angle COB, which is 80 degrees. Since OR bisects angle COB, angle COR = angle ROB = 40 degrees. So, OR is 40 degrees away from both CO and BO.Similarly, OM is the bisector of angle BOD (100 degrees), so angle BOM = 50 degrees.Therefore, the angle between OR and OM would be the angle from OR to OM, passing through BO. Since OR is 40 degrees away from BO (towards CO), and OM is 50 degrees away from BO (towards OD). Therefore, the total angle between OR and OM is 40 + 50 = 90 degrees. Therefore, angle ROM is 90 degrees.Wait, is that correct? Let me visualize. If OR is 40 degrees above BO (towards CO), and OM is 50 degrees below BO (towards OD), then the angle between OR and OM is indeed 40 + 50 = 90 degrees. So, angle ROM is 90 degrees. Therefore, part a) is 90 degrees.But let me verify this with another approach to be safe.Alternatively, since angle COB is 80 degrees, and OR bisects it, so angle COR = 40 degrees. Similarly, angle BOD is 100 degrees, bisected by OM, so angle BOM = 50 degrees. Now, angle ROM is the angle between OR and OM. Let&#39;s compute this by considering the directions.Starting from OR, which is 40 degrees from BO towards CO, moving to OM, which is 50 degrees from BO towards OD. The angle between them would be the sum of these two angles if they are on opposite sides of BO. Since OR is on the CO side of BO, and OM is on the OD side of BO, the angle between OR and OM is indeed 40 + 50 = 90 degrees. Therefore, angle ROM is 90 degrees. So, part a) is 90°.Moving to part b) measure of angle AOD. Wait, earlier we found angle AOD is 80 degrees, since angle AOD = 180 - x = 180 - 100 = 80 degrees. So, unless there&#39;s a trick here, the answer should be 80 degrees. Let me confirm.Given that lines AB and CD intersect at O, angle AOD is the angle between AO and OD. Since AO and BO form a straight line (AB), angle AOD is supplementary to angle BOD. Since angle BOD is x = 100 degrees, angle AOD is 180 - 100 = 80 degrees. Therefore, part b) is 80 degrees.Now, part c) the measure of the angle between the bisectors of angles AOC and BOR.First, we need to identify the bisectors of angles AOC and BOR.Angle AOC is given as x = 100 degrees. Its bisector will split it into two angles of 50 degrees each. Let&#39;s call this bisector OQ (assuming Q is a point somewhere). Similarly, angle BOR is another angle that we need to bisect.Wait, angle BOR. Let&#39;s clarify angle BOR. OR is the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees), so angle BOR is half of angle COB, which is 40 degrees. So, angle BOR is 40 degrees. Therefore, the bisector of angle BOR will split it into two angles of 20 degrees each.Therefore, the bisectors we&#39;re considering are:1. The bisector of angle AOC (100 degrees), which is OQ, creating two 50-degree angles.2. The bisector of angle BOR (40 degrees), which is another ray, let&#39;s say OS, creating two 20-degree angles.We need to find the measure of the angle between these two bisectors (OQ and OS).First, let&#39;s determine the positions of these bisectors.Angle AOC is 100 degrees, between AO and CO. Its bisector OQ will be 50 degrees from both AO and CO. So, starting from AO, moving 50 degrees towards CO.Angle BOR is 40 degrees, between BO and OR. Since OR is already the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees), angle BOR is 40 degrees. The bisector of angle BOR will be a ray OS that splits BOR into two 20-degree angles. So, starting from BO, moving 20 degrees towards OR.Now, we need to find the angle between OQ and OS.To compute this, we need to determine their positions relative to each other.Let me try to map this out step by step.First, let&#39;s consider angle AOC is 100 degrees, between AO and CO. Its bisector OQ is 50 degrees from AO towards CO. So, in terms of direction, if AO is along the positive x-axis, CO is 100 degrees above AO, so OQ is 50 degrees above AO.Angle BOR is 40 degrees, between BO and OR. BO is the opposite direction of AO, so if AO is 0 degrees, BO is 180 degrees. OR is the bisector of angle COB (80 degrees), which is between CO (100 degrees from AO) and BO (180 degrees). So, angle COB is 80 degrees, so OR is 40 degrees from both CO and BO. Therefore, OR is 40 degrees from BO towards CO. Since BO is 180 degrees, moving 40 degrees towards CO (which is at 100 degrees). Wait, directionally, from BO (180 degrees) moving towards CO (100 degrees), which is a direction of 100 degrees, so the angle between BO (180) and CO (100) is 80 degrees (as previously established). So, OR is 40 degrees from BO towards CO. Therefore, OR is at 180 - 40 = 140 degrees from the positive x-axis (AO direction).Then, angle BOR is 40 degrees, between BO (180 degrees) and OR (140 degrees). The bisector OS of angle BOR will split this 40-degree angle into two 20-degree angles. So, starting from BO (180 degrees), moving 20 degrees towards OR (140 degrees). Therefore, OS is at 180 - 20 = 160 degrees from the positive x-axis.Meanwhile, the bisector OQ of angle AOC (100 degrees) is 50 degrees from AO (0 degrees) towards CO (100 degrees). So, OQ is at 0 + 50 = 50 degrees from the positive x-axis.Now, we need to find the angle between OQ (50 degrees) and OS (160 degrees). The angle between them is the absolute difference between their positions if they are in different quadrants. However, since 50 degrees is in the first quadrant and 160 degrees is in the second quadrant, the angle between them is 160 - 50 = 110 degrees. But angles between two rays are the smallest angle between them, so 110 degrees or 250 degrees, but we take the smaller one, which is 110 degrees. Wait, but let me check.Wait, from 50 degrees to 160 degrees, moving counterclockwise, it&#39;s 160 - 50 = 110 degrees. Moving clockwise, it&#39;s 360 - 160 + 50 = 250 degrees. So, the smaller angle is 110 degrees. Therefore, the angle between OQ and OS is 110 degrees.Wait, but let&#39;s verify this with another method.Alternatively, since OQ is at 50 degrees and OS is at 160 degrees. The angle between them can be calculated as |160 - 50| = 110 degrees. Since this is less than 180, it&#39;s the correct angle. Therefore, the measure is 110 degrees.But let me confirm this with the given information without assigning coordinates.Alternatively, angle AOC is 100 degrees, bisected by OQ into 50 degrees each. So, OQ is 50 degrees from AO towards CO. Angle BOR is 40 degrees, bisected by OS into 20 degrees each. Since BOR is 40 degrees between BO and OR, which is 40 degrees from BO towards CO. So, OS is 20 degrees from BO towards OR. Since OR is 40 degrees from BO towards CO, OS is 20 degrees from BO towards OR, which is 20 degrees towards CO from BO. Therefore, OS is 20 degrees from BO towards CO.BO is 180 degrees from AO. So, moving 20 degrees towards CO (which is 100 degrees from AO) from BO (180 degrees) would place OS at 180 - 20 = 160 degrees from AO.Similarly, OQ is 50 degrees from AO towards CO (which is 100 degrees from AO), so OQ is at 50 degrees.The angle between 50 degrees and 160 degrees is 110 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the bisectors is 110 degrees.Therefore, part c) answer is 110 degrees.But let me check once more for any miscalculations.Wait, angle between bisectors: OQ is the bisector of AOC (100°), so at 50°, and OS is the bisector of BOR (40°), so at 20° from BO. BO is 180°, so 180° - 20° = 160°. The angle between 50° and 160° is 160 - 50 = 110°, which is correct. Since 110° is less than 180°, that&#39;s the angle between them. Therefore, part c) is 110 degrees.But let me think if there&#39;s another way this could be approached. Maybe using the properties of angle bisectors and summing angles.Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of the bisectors, we can calculate the angle between them using their positions. But the previous method seems correct. Therefore, I think 110 degrees is the answer for part c).Final Answera) boxed{90^circ}b) boxed{80^circ}c) boxed{110^circ}&lt;/think&gt;Given lines AB and CD intersect at O, with rays OM, OT, and OR as the bisectors of angles ∠BOD, ∠DOM, and ∠COB respectively, and m(∠AOM) = 130°, we need to calculate the measures of angles ROM, AOD, and the angle between the bisectors of ∠AOC and ∠BOR.1.

The problem is about finding the probability of randomly selecting a defective switch from a batch. They inspected 100 switches out of 2000, and 10 of those inspected were defective. Hmm, so I need to figure out the probability based on this sample.First, probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes would be the defective switches, and the total possible outcomes are all the switches that were inspected. Wait, but the total number of switches is 2000, but they only checked 100. So does the probability apply to the entire 2000 or just the sample?Well, the question says, &quot;the probability of drawing a defective product if one is randomly selected.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify whether we&#39;re selecting from the entire 2000 or from the sample. But since they checked 100 and found 10 defective, I think they want us to use the sample to estimate the probability for the whole population. So, the idea is that the sample is representative of the whole, right?So, if 10 out of 100 inspected switches are defective, then the probability would be 10 divided by 100, which is 0.1 or 10%. That seems straightforward. But wait, maybe there&#39;s a catch here. Let me double-check.The total number of switches is 2000, but only 100 were tested. The defective rate in the sample is 10%, so we can estimate that the defective rate in the entire population is also around 10%. Therefore, if we pick one switch at random from all 2000, the probability that it&#39;s defective is approximately 10%.Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking about the probability based on the sample itself. But since the question is phrased as &quot;the probability of drawing a defective product if one is randomly selected,&quot; without specifying the group, I think they want the probability based on the sample data. So, since in the sample of 100, 10 were defective, the probability would be 10/100.But wait, another thought: maybe the 10 defective switches found in the sample of 100 would imply something about the remaining 1900 switches. But unless they tell us how the defects are distributed, we can&#39;t assume anything else. The standard approach in such cases is to use the sample proportion as an estimate for the population proportion. So unless told otherwise, we use the sample&#39;s defective rate.Therefore, the probability is 10 divided by 100, which simplifies to 1/10, or 0.1. Converting that to a percentage if needed, but the question just asks for the probability, so 0.1 or 1/10. Depending on how they want the answer, maybe as a fraction.Wait, but the total number of defective switches in the entire 2000 could be estimated as 10% of 2000, which is 200. So if we take 200 defective out of 2000 total, that&#39;s also 200/2000 = 0.1. So either way, whether we calculate it based on the sample proportion or estimate the total defects and then calculate, we get the same probability. That&#39;s interesting.So, even though they tested 100, the probability ends up being the same because when you scale up the number of defective switches proportionally, the ratio remains the same. Hence, the probability is 10%.Therefore, the answer should be 0.1 or 1/10. Let me check the question again to make sure. It says &quot;the probability of drawing a defective product if one is randomly selected is ____.&quot; Yes, so they just want the probability based on the sample data, which is 10/100. So, simplifying, that&#39;s 1/10. In box form, that&#39;s boxed{dfrac{1}{10}} or boxed{0.1}. Since fractions are often preferred in probability unless specified otherwise, probably the fraction.Final AnswerThe probability of drawing a defective product is boxed{dfrac{1}{10}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the probability of randomly selecting a defective switch, we use the data from the sample inspection. Out of 100 randomly checked switches, 10 were found to be defective. The probability is calculated by dividing the number of defective switches found in the sample by the total number of switches inspected in the sample:[text{Probability} = frac{text{Number of defective switches}}{text{Total number of inspected switches}} = frac{10}{100} = frac{1}{10}]This sample proportion is used to estimate the probability for the entire population of 2000 switches. Therefore, the probability of drawing a defective product is boxed{dfrac{1}{10}}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of randomly selecting a defective switch from the 2000 switches based on the sample inspection they did. Let me start by understanding the problem again. They checked 100 switches out of 2000, and 10 of those 100 were defective. The question is asking for the probability that a randomly selected switch from the entire batch is defective.Hmm, probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes would be the number of defective switches, and the total possible outcomes are all the switches in the batch, which is 2000. But wait, they didn&#39;t check all 2000 switches, only 100 of them. So how do I estimate the number of defective switches in the entire batch?I remember that when you have a sample, you can use the proportion of defective items in the sample to estimate the proportion in the entire population. That makes sense because the sample is supposed to be representative. So if 10 out of 100 switches were defective in the sample, that&#39;s 10%. So maybe we can estimate that 10% of the entire 2000 switches are defective.Let me check that logic. If 10% of the sample is defective, and the sample is random and representative, then we can extrapolate that to the whole population. So 10% of 2000 is 200 defective switches. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a defective switch would be 200 out of 2000, which simplifies to 1/10 or 10%.But wait, is this a case of using relative frequency probability? Yeah, that&#39;s right. The probability is based on the relative frequency of defective switches in the sample. So the formula would be:Probability = (Number of defective in sample) / (Sample size) = 10 / 100 = 0.1Then apply that probability to the entire population. So the estimated number of defective switches is 0.1 * 2000 = 200. But the question is asking for the probability, not the estimated number. Wait, actually, maybe the question is just asking for the probability based on the sample. Since the sample is part of the population, maybe they just want the empirical probability, which is the ratio found in the sample.But then, is there a difference between the sample proportion and the population proportion? The problem says &quot;the probability of drawing a defective product if one is randomly selected&quot;. Since we don&#39;t have information about the entire population, the best estimate we can give is based on the sample. So the sample proportion is 10/100 = 0.1, so the estimated probability is 0.1 or 10%.Alternatively, maybe they want us to use the actual numbers? Wait, but in the entire population, we don&#39;t know the actual number of defective switches. The inspection only checked 100. So if we are to give a probability, the best we can do is use the sample data. That seems right.But let me think again. Suppose they check 100 switches and 10 are defective. The probability that any one switch is defective is estimated as 10/100, which is 0.1. So even though the total population is 2000, the probability is still 10% because that&#39;s the observed frequency. So the answer should be 0.1, or 10%, which can be written as 1/10.Wait, but another way to think about it is, if we consider the entire population, we might use the hypergeometric distribution or something else. But since we are sampling without replacement, but the population is large (2000) and the sample is relatively small (100), maybe the difference is negligible. However, in this case, the question is about the probability of selecting a defective switch from the entire population, not from the sample. So how do we relate the sample to the population?Alternatively, maybe they expect us to assume that the proportion of defective switches in the sample is the same as in the population. So 10% defective in the sample implies 10% defective in the population, hence the probability is 10%. That seems to be the standard approach in such problems. So I think the answer is 10%, which is 0.1, or 1/10.But wait, let me confirm. Suppose the entire population has D defective switches. The probability of selecting a defective switch is D/2000. But we don&#39;t know D. However, in the sample of 100 switches, 10 were defective. So the maximum likelihood estimate for D would be (10/100)*2000 = 200, so D=200. Therefore, the probability would be 200/2000 = 1/10. So that gives the same result.Yes, so whether we use the sample proportion directly or estimate the number of defective switches in the population and then compute the probability, we end up with the same answer of 1/10.Therefore, the probability is 10%, or 0.1, which is 1/10.But wait, the problem says &quot;the probability of drawing a defective product if one is randomly selected&quot;. Since the selection is from the entire 2000, and we have an estimate based on the sample, the answer is 1/10. So in box form, it should be boxed{dfrac{1}{10}}.I think that&#39;s correct. Let me check once more. If I have a sample size of 100, 10 defective, the proportion is 10%. Assuming the sample is representative, the population proportion is estimated as 10%, so the probability is 10%. Yep. So 10% is 1/10. So the answer is 1/10.Final AnswerThe probability of drawing a defective product is boxed{dfrac{1}{10}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the probability of drawing a defective switch from the entire batch of 2000 switches based on the sample inspection, we start by analyzing the sample data. Out of 100 randomly checked switches, 10 were found to be defective. The proportion of defective switches in the sample is calculated as follows:[text{Proportion of defective switches in sample} = frac{text{Number of defective switches}}{text{Sample size}} = frac{10}{100} = 0.1]This sample proportion is used to estimate the proportion of defective switches in the entire population. Assuming the sample is representative of the entire batch, we estimate that 10% of the 2000 switches are defective. The estimated number of defective switches in the population is:[0.1 times 2000 = 200]Thus, the probability of randomly selecting a defective switch from the entire batch is:[frac{text{Estimated number of defective switches}}{text{Total number of switches}} = frac{200}{2000} = frac{1}{10}]Therefore, the probability of drawing a defective product is boxed{dfrac{1}{10}}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-7ab06a9d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-7ab06a9d><span class="icon" data-v-7ab06a9d>🔑:</span>Since 100 out of 2000 switches were checked, and 10 of them were found to be defective,  when randomly selecting one switch for inspection, the probability of drawing a defective product isfrac{10}{100}which simplifies tofrac{1}{10}.
