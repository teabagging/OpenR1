Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember from algebra that when you have expressions like this, maybe you can use some inequalities, like the AM-GM inequality or something. Let me think.First, since x and y are positive and add up to 1, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me try that. If x + y = 1, then y = 1 - x. So substituting that into the expression 1/x + 1/y, it becomes 1/x + 1/(1 - x). Now, the problem reduces to finding the minimum of this function for x in (0, 1).Alright, so maybe calculus could work here. Let me take the derivative of the function f(x) = 1/x + 1/(1 - x). Let&#39;s compute f&#39;(x):f&#39;(x) = -1/x² + 1/(1 - x)². To find the critical points, set this equal to zero:-1/x² + 1/(1 - x)² = 0=&gt; 1/(1 - x)² = 1/x²Taking square roots on both sides (since x and 1 - x are positive),1/(1 - x) = 1/xCross-multiplying:x = 1 - x=&gt; 2x = 1=&gt; x = 1/2So x = 1/2, which means y = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Then, substituting back into the original expression:1/(1/2) + 1/(1/2) = 2 + 2 = 4. So the minimum value is 4? But wait, the options include 4 as choice D. So is that the answer?But wait, let me check if this is indeed a minimum. Maybe I should do the second derivative test. Let me compute f&#39;&#39;(x):First, f&#39;(x) = -1/x² + 1/(1 - x)²Then f&#39;&#39;(x) = 2/x³ + 2/(1 - x)^3At x = 1/2, f&#39;&#39;(1/2) = 2/( (1/2)^3 ) + 2/( (1/2)^3 ) = 2/(1/8) + 2/(1/8) = 16 + 16 = 32, which is positive. So the function is concave up at that point, which means it&#39;s a local minimum. Since the function tends to infinity as x approaches 0 or 1, this must be the global minimum. So the minimum value is indeed 4, which is option D.Alternatively, I could use the AM-HM inequality. The harmonic mean of x and y is 2/(1/x + 1/y), and we know that the harmonic mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean of x and y is (x + y)/2 = 1/2. So,HM = 2/(1/x + 1/y) ≤ AM = 1/2Multiply both sides by (1/x + 1/y):2 ≤ (1/x + 1/y)(1/2)Multiply both sides by 2:4 ≤ 1/x + 1/ySo 1/x + 1/y ≥ 4, which means the minimum value is 4, achieved when x = y = 1/2. So that&#39;s another way to confirm it.Wait, but in the AM-HM inequality, equality holds when all the numbers are equal. Since x + y = 1, if x = y, then x = y = 1/2, which is exactly where the minimum occurs. So that&#39;s consistent.So both calculus and the inequality approach give the same answer. Therefore, the minimum value is 4, which is option D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given (x + y = 1) where (x, y &gt; 0), we need to find the minimum value of (dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y}).First, we express (y) in terms of (x): (y = 1 - x). Substituting this into the expression, we get:[dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{1 - x}]To find the critical points, we take the derivative of the function (f(x) = dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{1 - x}):[f&#39;(x) = -dfrac{1}{x^2} + dfrac{1}{(1 - x)^2}]Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:[-dfrac{1}{x^2} + dfrac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = 0 implies dfrac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = dfrac{1}{x^2}]Solving this, we get:[dfrac{1}{1 - x} = dfrac{1}{x} implies x = 1 - x implies 2x = 1 implies x = dfrac{1}{2}]Thus, (x = dfrac{1}{2}) and (y = dfrac{1}{2}). Substituting these values back into the expression:[dfrac{1}{dfrac{1}{2}} + dfrac{1}{dfrac{1}{2}} = 2 + 2 = 4]To confirm this is a minimum, we use the second derivative test:[f&#39;&#39;(x) = dfrac{2}{x^3} + dfrac{2}{(1 - x)^3}]At (x = dfrac{1}{2}):[f&#39;&#39;left(dfrac{1}{2}right) = dfrac{2}{left(dfrac{1}{2}right)^3} + dfrac{2}{left(dfrac{1}{2}right)^3} = 16 + 16 = 32 &gt; 0]Since the second derivative is positive, (x = dfrac{1}{2}) is a local minimum, which is also the global minimum.Using the AM-HM inequality:[text{Harmonic Mean} = dfrac{2}{dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y}} leq text{Arithmetic Mean} = dfrac{x + y}{2} = dfrac{1}{2}][dfrac{2}{dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y}} leq dfrac{1}{2} implies dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y} geq 4]Equality holds when (x = y = dfrac{1}{2}), confirming the minimum value is 4.Thus, the minimum value is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of 1/x + 1/y given that x + y = 1 and both x and y are positive. Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that when dealing with optimization problems like this, especially with constraints, methods like substitution or using inequalities such as AM-GM might be useful here.First, since x + y = 1, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me try that. If I solve for y, I get y = 1 - x. Then I can substitute that into the expression we need to minimize. So, 1/x + 1/y becomes 1/x + 1/(1 - x). Now, the problem is to find the minimum of this function for x in (0,1).Let me write that down: f(x) = 1/x + 1/(1 - x). To find its minimum, I can take the derivative and set it to zero. Let&#39;s compute f&#39;(x). The derivative of 1/x is -1/x², and the derivative of 1/(1 - x) is 1/(1 - x)². So f&#39;(x) = -1/x² + 1/(1 - x)².Setting this equal to zero: -1/x² + 1/(1 - x)² = 0. Which implies 1/(1 - x)² = 1/x². Taking reciprocals on both sides, (1 - x)² = x². Taking square roots (since x and 1 - x are positive, we don&#39;t have to worry about signs), we get 1 - x = x. Solving for x: 1 = 2x =&gt; x = 1/2. Then y = 1 - x = 1/2.So when x = y = 1/2, the expression 1/x + 1/y becomes 1/(1/2) + 1/(1/2) = 2 + 2 = 4. So the minimum value is 4? But let me check if that&#39;s actually the minimum.Alternatively, maybe using AM-GM inequality. The expression 1/x + 1/y. Let&#39;s see. Since x and y are positive, perhaps we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Or maybe harmonic mean.Wait, the harmonic mean of x and y is 2/(1/x + 1/y). The arithmetic mean of x and y is (x + y)/2 = 1/2. We know that harmonic mean ≤ arithmetic mean. So 2/(1/x + 1/y) ≤ 1/2. Multiplying both sides by (1/x + 1/y) and by 2 (since all terms are positive), we get 4 ≤ (1/x + 1/y). Wait, that would imply that 1/x + 1/y is at least 4. So the minimum value is 4, which occurs when x = y = 1/2. That matches the calculus result. So the answer is D: 4.But let me verify again. If x and y are both 1/2, then 1/x +1/y is 2 +2=4. If I take another point, say x=1/3, then y=2/3. Then 1/x +1/y=3 + 3/2=4.5, which is larger. If x approaches 0, then 1/x approaches infinity, so the expression would go to infinity. Similarly for y approaching 0. So the minimum must occur at x=y=1/2, giving 4. Therefore, the answer is D:4.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given ( x + y = 1 ) where ( x, y &gt; 0 ), we need to find the minimum value of ( dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y} ).First, we express ( y ) in terms of ( x ): ( y = 1 - x ). Substituting this into the expression, we get:[f(x) = dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{1 - x}]To find the minimum, we take the derivative of ( f(x) ):[f&#39;(x) = -dfrac{1}{x^2} + dfrac{1}{(1 - x)^2}]Setting the derivative equal to zero:[-dfrac{1}{x^2} + dfrac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = 0 implies dfrac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = dfrac{1}{x^2}]Taking reciprocals and solving:[(1 - x)^2 = x^2 implies 1 - x = x implies 1 = 2x implies x = dfrac{1}{2}]Thus, ( y = 1 - x = dfrac{1}{2} ). Substituting ( x = y = dfrac{1}{2} ) into the expression:[dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y} = dfrac{1}{1/2} + dfrac{1}{1/2} = 2 + 2 = 4]We can also verify this using the harmonic mean inequality. The harmonic mean of ( x ) and ( y ) is ( dfrac{2}{dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y}} ), and the arithmetic mean is ( dfrac{x + y}{2} = dfrac{1}{2} ). Since harmonic mean ≤ arithmetic mean:[dfrac{2}{dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y}} leq dfrac{1}{2} implies 4 leq dfrac{1}{x} + dfrac{1}{y}]Thus, the minimum value is indeed 4, achieved when ( x = y = dfrac{1}{2} ).[boxed{D}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-40815de7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>🔑:</span>Since (x+y=1) where (x,y &gt; 0),  we have ( dfrac {1}{x}+ dfrac {1}{y}=(x+y)( dfrac {1}{x}+ dfrac {1}{y})=2+ dfrac {y}{x}+ dfrac {x}{y} geqslant 2+2 sqrt { dfrac {y}{x} cdot dfrac {x}{y}}=4), which equals to 4 if and only if (x=y= dfrac {1}{2}).

The problem is asking: if there are four non-coplanar points, how many planes are equally distant from these four points? Hmm, interesting. So first, I need to understand what it means for a plane to be equally distant from four points. Since the points are non-coplanar, they don&#39;t all lie on the same plane, which probably means they form a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, right? So maybe the problem is related to the geometry of a tetrahedron.Alright, so if I have four points not all on the same plane, they must form a three-dimensional figure. The question is about planes that are equidistant from all four points. Equidistant in what sense? I think it means that the distance from each point to the plane is the same. So a plane where each of the four points has the same perpendicular distance to the plane.Now, how do I find such planes? Let me recall. In three-dimensional space, the set of points equidistant from two points is a plane that&#39;s the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. So if I have two points, the perpendicular bisector plane is all points equidistant to both. But here, we need a plane equidistant to four points. That seems more complex.Since the four points are non-coplanar, they form a tetrahedron. For a tetrahedron, there are several special planes and points, like the centroid, circumcenter, etc. Maybe the circumscribed sphere around the tetrahedron? The center of the sphere would be equidistant to all four points, but the question is about planes, not points. So maybe the plane that&#39;s tangent to the sphere at some point? Wait, no. Tangent planes would only touch the sphere at one point, but we need a plane that is equidistant to all four points.Alternatively, maybe planes that pass through the centroids or something. Let me think.Wait, the distance from a point to a plane is calculated by the formula |ax + by + cz + d| / sqrt(a² + b² + c²) where ax + by + cz + d = 0 is the plane equation and (x, y, z) is the point. So if the distance is the same for all four points, then |ax + by + cz + d| must be proportional to sqrt(a² + b² + c²), but since the same for all four points, maybe |ax + by + cz + d| is the same for each point. But because distance is absolute, the sign could vary. However, the problem says &quot;equally distant,&quot; which is a magnitude, so signs might not matter. So we need a plane such that the absolute value of the expression ax + by + cz + d is equal for all four points when divided by the norm of the normal vector.Hmm, so maybe we can set up equations where for each point (xi, yi, zi), |axi + byi + czi + d| = k * sqrt(a² + b² + c²) for some constant k. But since k is a scalar, maybe we can just set |axi + byi + czi + d| equal for all four points.But solving this system might be complicated. Let me think if there&#39;s a geometric interpretation instead.In 3D space, given four non-coplanar points, how many planes have the same distance to all four?I remember that for three non-collinear points, there&#39;s exactly one plane that is equidistant from them, which is the plane passing through their centroid and perpendicular to the line joining the centroid to the orthocenter or something? Wait, maybe not. For three points, the set of points equidistant from all three would be the perpendicular bisector plane of the triangle, which is a line in 3D space? Wait, no.Wait, in 3D, the set of points equidistant from three non-collinear points is a line perpendicular to the plane of the triangle at its circumcenter. But the question is about planes equidistant to four points.Alternatively, maybe consider that a plane equidistant to four points would have to lie in some symmetrical position relative to the tetrahedron.In a tetrahedron, there are several planes of symmetry. For example, the planes that bisect edges and are perpendicular to them. Also, the planes that pass through the midpoints of edges.Alternatively, maybe the number of such planes is related to the number of ways to partition the four points into two pairs. For each pair, the plane could be the perpendicular bisecting plane of the segment joining the pair. But if we have two pairs, maybe the intersection of two such planes? Wait, but the problem states the plane must be equidistant to all four points, not just two pairs.Wait, perhaps if we partition the four points into two pairs, such that the plane is the perpendicular bisector of each pair. But for a plane to be the perpendicular bisector of two different segments, those segments must lie in parallel planes? Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe there are planes that lie halfway between two points. For example, between each pair of points, there&#39;s a plane equidistant to those two points. But to be equidistant to all four, the plane needs to be equidistant to each of the four. That seems like the plane would need to be equidistant to each point, so perhaps it&#39;s similar to the concept of a radical plane in two dimensions, but extended.Wait, in 3D, the radical center of four spheres would be a point, but here we are talking about a plane. Maybe the locus of points equidistant to four points is empty or a lower-dimensional space, but we&#39;re looking for planes, not points.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a plane such that two points are on one side and two points on the other, each pair symmetric with respect to the plane. So, for instance, if the plane is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting two points, and also the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the other two points. In that case, the plane would be equidistant to all four points.But how many such planes are possible? For four non-coplanar points, how many ways can we pair them such that the perpendicular bisector planes of both pairs coincide?Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple such planes depending on the pairings.Wait, let&#39;s consider that in order for a plane to be equidistant to all four points, each point must be the same distance from the plane. Since the distance from a point to a plane is absolute, this could happen in two ways: either all four points are on the same side of the plane but at the same distance (which seems impossible unless they are coplanar, which they are not), or the plane is positioned such that two points are on one side and two on the other, each at the same distance.Ah, that makes sense. So if the plane is placed exactly halfway between two pairs of points, such that for each pair, their midpoint lies on the plane, and the plane is perpendicular to the line connecting the two pairs. Wait, but connecting which pairs?Alternatively, think of the four points as vertices of a tetrahedron. A plane that bisects the tetrahedron into two equal volumes, with two points on each side. But such a plane would need to be equidistant from all four points. However, volume bisectors don&#39;t necessarily have to be equidistant to all points.Alternatively, consider that for each edge of the tetrahedron, there is a plane that is the perpendicular bisector of that edge. If two such planes intersect, their line of intersection would be equidistant to the four points? Maybe not.Wait, maybe the answer is related to the number of ways you can have a plane equidistant to two pairs of points. For four points, how many ways can you partition them into two pairs? For four points, the number of ways to partition into two pairs is 3. For example, if the points are A, B, C, D, the partitions are (AB and CD), (AC and BD), (AD and BC). For each partition, there might be a plane that is the perpendicular bisector of both pairs.But wait, if you have two pairs, say AB and CD, then the plane that is the perpendicular bisector of AB and also the perpendicular bisector of CD. But does such a plane exist?The perpendicular bisector of AB is the set of points equidistant to A and B, which is a plane. Similarly for CD. The intersection of these two planes is the set of points equidistant to A and B and also to C and D, which is a line. But we need a plane that is equidistant to all four points, not a line.Wait, but the problem is not about points equidistant to all four points, but a plane. So maybe if there&#39;s a plane that is equidistant to each of the four points. That would require that for each point, the distance to the plane is the same. So each point lies on one of two parallel planes at distance d from the given plane, with two points on each. So the given plane is exactly halfway between the two parallel planes containing two points each.Ah! So if the four points can be divided into two pairs, each pair lying on a parallel plane, then the mid-plane between them would be equidistant to all four points. But since the original four points are non-coplanar, such parallel planes can&#39;t be the same plane, so this would require that the four points lie on two parallel planes, two on each. But if the four points are non-coplanar, then they can&#39;t all lie on two parallel planes either, unless they form a kind of prism, but a tetrahedron isn&#39;t a prism.Wait, no. A tetrahedron is a simplex, all edges are connected. If four points are non-coplanar, they can lie on two parallel planes, two on each. For example, think of a tetrahedron where two vertices are on one plane and the other two on a parallel plane. In that case, the plane halfway between them would be equidistant to all four points. But is that always possible?Wait, not all tetrahedrons have this property. It depends on their configuration. So maybe the number of such mid-planes depends on how the points are arranged. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify any particular arrangement, just four non-coplanar points. So maybe the answer is that there can be up to three such planes, corresponding to the three ways to partition the four points into two pairs.But wait, how do we know that such a plane exists for each partition?Suppose we have four points A, B, C, D. If we partition them into (A,B) and (C,D), then we can construct a plane that is the perpendicular bisector of the segment AB and also the perpendicular bisector of the segment CD. However, for such a plane to exist, the segments AB and CD must be parallel and equal in length? Because otherwise their perpendicular bisector planes might not coincide or intersect in a way that forms a single plane.But the problem states the four points are non-coplanar, but doesn&#39;t specify any other conditions. So in general, for an arbitrary tetrahedron, the segments AB and CD might not be parallel or equal. Therefore, their perpendicular bisector planes might not form a single plane equidistant to all four points. So maybe such a plane only exists under certain conditions.But the problem is asking how many planes are equally distant from these four points, given that they are non-coplanar. So maybe the answer is not fixed unless there&#39;s a general result.Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the affine space. For four non-coplanar points, there is a unique sphere (the circumscribed sphere) that passes through all four points, but again, that&#39;s a sphere, not a plane. The center of that sphere is equidistant to all four points, but it&#39;s a point, not a plane.Alternatively, the concept of a equidistant plane in the context of a tetrahedron. Maybe for each face, there is a plane parallel to the face and at a certain distance from it, such that the opposite vertex is at the same distance. But since the tetrahedron is irregular, the distance would vary. Hmm.Wait, another approach. Let&#39;s think about the equation of the plane. Let’s denote the plane as ax + by + cz + d = 0. The distance from a point (xi, yi, zi) to this plane is |axi + byi + czi + d| / sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, for all four points, this value must be equal. Let&#39;s denote the distance as k. Therefore, for each point, we have:|axi + byi + czi + d| = k * sqrt(a² + b² + c²)But since k is the same for all four points, the equations become:axi + byi + czi + d = ±k * sqrt(a² + b² + c²)However, the signs can vary. So for four points, we can have different combinations of signs. However, the problem states that the plane must be equally distant from all four points, which is a magnitude, so the sign only indicates the side of the plane. But since distance is non-negative, regardless of the side, the distance is the same.Therefore, to have equal distance, the absolute value expressions must be equal. So, we can have either all four points on the same side of the plane, which would mean axi + byi + czi + d has the same sign for all i, and thus equal to k * sqrt(a² + b² + c²). But since the points are non-coplanar, they can&#39;t all lie on the same plane, but they could be on the same side of a plane. However, having all four points on one side of a plane at equal distance would require them to lie on a sphere, perhaps? But again, not sure.Alternatively, the plane could have two points on one side and two on the other, such that for two points, axi + byi + czi + d = k * sqrt(a² + b² + c²), and for the other two, axi + byi + czi + d = -k * sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the plane is equidistant from all four points, with two points on each side.So, in this case, we need to solve the system where for two points, the expression equals +k and for the other two, -k. But since k and -k would correspond to distances on either side, but the distance is |expression| / norm, which would be the same. So, if we can find a plane such that two points are at distance k on one side, and two points at distance k on the other side.This seems plausible. So, how many such planes exist?Well, for four points in general position (non-coplanar), the number of such planes would depend on the number of ways to split them into two pairs. As mentioned earlier, there are three ways to split four points into two pairs. For each such pairing, there might be a plane equidistant to all four points.But does each pairing correspond to exactly one plane?Suppose we pair the points as (A,B) and (C,D). Then, we want a plane such that A and B are on one side at distance k, and C and D are on the other side at the same distance k. The set of planes that are equidistant to A and B is the perpendicular bisector plane of segment AB. Similarly, the set of planes equidistant to C and D is the perpendicular bisector plane of segment CD. The intersection of these two planes would be a line where all points are equidistant to A and B and to C and D. But we need a single plane equidistant to all four points. Wait, maybe the plane must be equidistant to both pairs simultaneously.Alternatively, perhaps the plane we are looking for is one that is a perpendicular bisector of both segments AB and CD. However, unless AB and CD are parallel and of equal length, such a plane might not exist. In general, for an arbitrary tetrahedron, the edges AB and CD may not be parallel or congruent, so such a plane may not exist.But the problem states four non-coplanar points, without any other conditions, so perhaps in the general case, such planes do exist for each pairing? Or maybe not?Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Suppose we have two pairs of points, (A,B) and (C,D). Let’s consider the line segment connecting the midpoints of AB and CD. The plane that is perpendicular to this line segment and passes through its midpoint might be equidistant to all four points.Let me verify. Let M be the midpoint of AB and N be the midpoint of CD. Then, the line MN connects these midpoints. If we construct a plane perpendicular to MN at its midpoint, then this plane would be equidistant to M and N. But does that make it equidistant to A, B, C, D?Well, the distance from A to the plane would be the distance from A to the plane. Since the plane is perpendicular to MN and passes through the midpoint of MN, any point on the plane is equidistant to M and N. But how does that relate to A, B, C, D?Wait, perhaps not directly. Let&#39;s consider coordinates. Let&#39;s assign coordinates to make it easier. Let’s place point M at the origin, and let the line MN be along the x-axis. Let’s assume that the midpoint of MN is at the origin, so M is at (-a, 0, 0) and N is at (a, 0, 0). Then the plane perpendicular to MN (the x-axis) at the origin is the y-z plane (x=0). The distance from A to the plane x=0: since M is the midpoint of AB, if M is at (-a, 0, 0), then A and B are symmetric around M. Let’s say A is at (-a - b, y1, z1) and B is at (-a + b, -y1, -z1) to make M the midpoint. Similarly, N is the midpoint of CD, so if N is at (a, 0, 0), then C and D would be at (a + c, y2, z2) and (a - c, -y2, -z2).Now, the distance from A to the plane x=0 is |-a - b|, since the x-coordinate of A is -a - b. Similarly, the distance from B is |-a + b|. For these distances to be equal, |-a - b| = |-a + b|. This would require that | -a - b | = | -a + b |. Squaring both sides: ( -a - b )² = ( -a + b )² =&gt; (a + b)² = (a - b)² =&gt; a² + 2ab + b² = a² - 2ab + b² =&gt; 4ab = 0. Therefore, either a=0 or b=0.If a=0, then points M and N coincide at the origin, which would mean AB and CD have the same midpoint, but since the four points are non-coplanar, this might not hold. If b=0, then points A and B are both at (-a, 0, 0), which would collapse them into the same point, but the problem states four points, so they must be distinct. Hence, this suggests that unless specific conditions are met, the distances from A and B to the plane x=0 would not be equal.Therefore, this approach might not work. So maybe the idea of taking the midpoint plane between the midpoints of AB and CD doesn&#39;t necessarily result in a plane equidistant to all four points unless some symmetry is present.Given that the problem states four non-coplanar points without any symmetry, it&#39;s possible that such planes might not exist. But the problem is asking how many planes are equally distant from four non-coplanar points. So maybe in the general case, the number is zero? But that seems unlikely, as the answer is probably a fixed number.Wait, let me think of a regular tetrahedron. In a regular tetrahedron, which is highly symmetrical, how many planes are equidistant from all four vertices?In a regular tetrahedron, there are planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through a edge and the midpoint of the opposite edge. There are six edges, but each plane is associated with a pair of opposite edges, so there are six / 2 = 3 such planes. Each of these planes divides the tetrahedron into two mirror images. Are these planes equidistant from all four vertices?Wait, let&#39;s see. Take a regular tetrahedron with vertices A, B, C, D. Consider the plane passing through edge AB and the midpoint of edge CD. Is this plane equidistant from all four vertices?The distance from vertex C to this plane: since the plane contains edge AB and the midpoint of CD, which is a point, say M. The plane is ABM. The distance from C to plane ABM can be calculated. Similarly, the distance from D to plane ABM would be the same, since M is the midpoint of CD. But what about the distances from A and B? Since A and B lie on the plane, their distance is zero. Therefore, this plane is not equidistant to all four points, only to C and D (and A and B are on the plane). So this is not equidistant to all four.Alternatively, consider a plane that doesn&#39;t contain any edges. For example, the plane equidistant from all four vertices. In a regular tetrahedron, the centroid is equidistant to all vertices, so the planes passing through the centroid might be candidates. But a plane through the centroid would have varying distances to the vertices unless it&#39;s arranged symmetrically.Wait, in a regular tetrahedron, the six planes that are perpendicular bisectors of the edges each pass through the centroid, but again, those are planes equidistant to two vertices each, not all four.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a plane that&#39;s equidistant to all four vertices. For a regular tetrahedron, such a plane would need to have all four vertices at the same distance. But in a regular tetrahedron, any plane at a certain distance from the centroid... Wait, no. The set of points equidistant from all four vertices of a regular tetrahedron is just the center point. There&#39;s no plane where all four vertices are equidistant. Wait, unless the plane is at infinity, but that&#39;s not applicable here.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe in a regular tetrahedron, there are no planes equidistant to all four vertices. But that contradicts intuition. Wait, maybe in the regular tetrahedron, there are three such planes, each corresponding to a pair of opposite edges.Wait, let&#39;s think again. Suppose we have a regular tetrahedron. Take an edge AB and the opposite edge CD. The midpoint of AB is M, and the midpoint of CD is N. The line MN is perpendicular to both AB and CD. Then, the plane that is the perpendicular bisector of MN (i.e., the plane that passes through the midpoint of MN and is perpendicular to it) should be equidistant to all four points. Because it&#39;s equidistant to M and N, which are midpoints of AB and CD. So, points A and B are symmetric with respect to this plane, as are points C and D. Therefore, the distance from A and B to the plane is the same, and the distance from C and D to the plane is the same. But in a regular tetrahedron, the length of MN is equal to the distance between the midpoints of two opposite edges, which is equal for all pairs. So in this case, the plane would be equidistant to all four vertices. Wait, is that true?Let me calculate. In a regular tetrahedron with edge length s, the distance between midpoints of opposite edges can be calculated. Let&#39;s assign coordinates. Let’s place the tetrahedron with vertices at (1,1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1). This is a regular tetrahedron centered at the origin. Let&#39;s take edges from (1,1,1) to (-1,-1,1) and from (-1,1,-1) to (1,-1,-1). The midpoints of these edges are M = (0,0,1) and N = (0,0,-1). The line MN is along the z-axis from (0,0,1) to (0,0,-1). The plane perpendicular to MN (the z-axis) at its midpoint (the origin) is the xy-plane (z=0). Now, let&#39;s compute the distance from each vertex to the plane z=0.For vertex (1,1,1): distance is |1| / 1 = 1.Similarly, (-1,-1,1): |1| / 1 = 1.(-1,1,-1): |-1| / 1 = 1.(1,-1,-1): |-1| / 1 = 1.So in this case, the plane z=0 is equidistant to all four vertices. So in a regular tetrahedron, this plane is equidistant to all four points. Similarly, there are other planes. For example, considering another pair of opposite edges, say from (1,1,1) to (-1,1,-1) and from (-1,-1,1) to (1,-1,-1). Their midpoints would be (0,1,0) and (0,-1,0). The plane perpendicular to the line connecting these midpoints (the y-axis) at the origin is the xz-plane (y=0). Similarly, the distance from each vertex to this plane is 1. And the third plane would be the yz-plane (x=0), from the other pair of opposite edges. So in the regular tetrahedron, there are three such planes: the xy-plane, xz-plane, and yz-plane, each equidistant to all four vertices.Therefore, in a regular tetrahedron, there are three planes equidistant from all four vertices. Therefore, maybe the answer is three.But the problem states four non-coplanar points, not necessarily forming a regular tetrahedron. However, the answer might still be three, as the number of planes would correspond to the number of ways to partition the four points into two pairs, which is three. For each partition, there exists a plane equidistant to all four points. Therefore, the answer is three.But wait, in the regular tetrahedron, the three planes exist because of the high symmetry. In an irregular tetrahedron, how many such planes exist?I need to check if, for any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape, there are three planes equidistant to all four vertices. But perhaps not. Maybe in a general tetrahedron, there can be up to three such planes, but depending on the shape, there could be fewer. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify any particular tetrahedron, just four non-coplanar points. So maybe it&#39;s assuming the general case where such three planes exist.Alternatively, maybe there are seven. Wait, no. Wait, in 3D, the number of planes equidistant from four points could also relate to the number of faces, edges, etc. Wait, but a tetrahedron has four faces. Each face is a plane, but the distance from the opposite vertex to the face is not the same as the distance from the face&#39;s own points (which are on the face, distance zero). So those are not equidistant.Alternatively, the bisector planes between two points. For four points, there are six edges, each with a perpendicular bisector plane. The intersection of these planes could give lines or points, but not sure.Wait, another thought. The set of planes equidistant from four points would satisfy the equation |ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d| = |ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d| = |ax3 + by3 + cz3 + d| = |ax4 + by4 + cz4 + d|. Each equality |ax + by + cz + d| = |ax&#39; + by&#39; + cz&#39; + d| corresponds to the plane equidistant between points (x,y,z) and (x&#39;,y&#39;,z&#39;). So, for four points, we have multiple such equalities.For four points, the number of independent equations would be C(4,2) = 6, but since we are looking for a plane that satisfies three equalities (distance equal for all four points), the system might be overdetermined. However, in the regular tetrahedron case, we do have three planes. But in a general tetrahedron, such planes might not exist. However, the problem is asking how many planes are equally distant from four non-coplanar points. If it&#39;s a general tetrahedron, maybe the answer is seven? Wait, that seems too many. Wait, in 3D space, the number of planes equidistant from four non-coplanar points is either 1, 3, 7, or something else.Wait, let me recall: in 2D, the number of lines equidistant from three non-collinear points is three (the perpendicular bisectors of each side, which meet at the circumcenter). But in 3D, it&#39;s different. For four non-coplanar points, the set of planes equidistant from all four points... Hmm. Maybe the answer is 7, as per the similar problem for points in 3D, where the number of planes equidistant from four points is 7. Wait, is that a known result?Alternatively, the problem might be analogous to the number of circles in 2D equidistant to three non-collinear points, which is one (the circumcircle). But for planes in 3D equidistant to four non-coplanar points, maybe there are seven. Wait, I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, the number could be related to the number of solutions of a system of equations.Let’s think of the equations. Let’s assume the plane is ax + by + cz + d = 0, and we need the distances from four points (xi, yi, zi) to this plane to be equal. So, |axi + byi + czi + d| = k for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. But since we can scale the plane equation, we can set k = 1 (since the equation is homogeneous). So we have:axi + byi + czi + d = ±1 for each i.But there are four equations with variables a, b, c, d, and each equation can have a +1 or -1 on the right-hand side. Each combination of signs gives a different system of equations. The number of possible combinations is 2^4 = 16, but many of these will be inconsistent or lead to the same plane.However, we need to consider that the four points are non-coplanar, so the system of equations for a particular combination of signs may have a unique solution, no solution, or multiple solutions. However, solving 16 systems is complicated.Alternatively, if all four equations have the same sign, say all +1, then we have a system:ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 1ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d = 1ax3 + by3 + cz3 + d = 1ax4 + by4 + cz4 + d = 1This is a linear system with four equations and four variables (a, b, c, d). However, since the four points are non-coplanar, the system is inconsistent. Because if they were coplanar, they would lie on the plane ax + by + cz + d = 1, but they are non-coplanar, so no solution here.Similarly, if three equations are +1 and one is -1, or other combinations. The only feasible case is when two equations are +1 and two are -1, which would split the four points into two pairs on either side of the plane. For each such partition, we can set up a system:ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 1ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d = 1ax3 + by3 + cz3 + d = -1ax4 + by4 + cz4 + d = -1This is a system of four equations. If the four points are in general position (non-coplanar), this system will have a unique solution, provided that the two pairs of points (1,2) and (3,4) can be separated by a plane. According to the separability of points in 3D, two pairs can be separated by a plane if they are not interleaved. For four points, the number of such separable partitions is equal to the number of ways to split them into two pairs that are not interleaved.But for four non-coplanar points, how many such separable pairings are there? For four points in general position, the number of planes that separate them into two pairs is equal to the number of ways to partition them into two pairs, which is three. However, each such partition might or might not be linearly separable.In three-dimensional space, any two pairs of points can be separated by a plane if they form a &quot;linear&quot; partition. So, for any partition of four points into two pairs, there exists a plane that separates them. Therefore, for each of the three partitions, there is one plane. Hence, three planes.But wait, in three-dimensional space, can any two pairs of points be separated by a plane? For example, suppose the four points form a tetrahedron. For any partition into two pairs, say (A,B) and (C,D), is there a plane such that A and B are on one side, and C and D on the other? Yes, because in 3D, unlike 2D, you can always find a plane that separates any two disjoint convex sets. Since two points form a convex set, and the other two points form another convex set, there exists a plane that separates them.Therefore, for each of the three partitions of four points into two pairs, there exists a separating plane. Moreover, if we require that the plane is equidistant from all four points, then for each such partition, there is exactly one plane that is the perpendicular bisector between the two pairs, hence equidistant to all four points.Therefore, the answer should be three.But wait, in my previous coordinate example with the regular tetrahedron, there were three planes. So this seems to align. Therefore, the answer is three.Hence, the number of planes equally distant from four non-coplanar points is three.Final AnswerThe number of equally distant planes is boxed{3}.&lt;/think&gt;Given four non-coplanar points, we need to determine how many planes are equally distant from all four points. 1. Understanding Equidistant Planes: A plane equidistant from four points means each point has the same perpendicular distance to the plane. For non-coplanar points (forming a tetrahedron), this involves considering planes that symmetrically partition the points.2. Partitions into Pairs: For four points, there are three ways to partition them into two pairs. Each partition can potentially correspond to a plane equidistant from all four points. The three partitions are:   - (A, B) and (C, D)   - (A, C) and (B, D)   - (A, D) and (B, C)3. Perpendicular Bisector Planes: For each partition, the plane must be the perpendicular bisector of the line segments joining each pair. In three-dimensional space, such a plane can exist for each partition, ensuring the plane is equidistant from all four points.4. Regular Tetrahedron Insight: In a regular tetrahedron, there are three planes equidistant from all four vertices, each corresponding to a partition of pairs. This generalizes to any tetrahedron due to the symmetry in partitioning pairs and the existence of separating planes in three-dimensional space.5. Conclusion: For any four non-coplanar points, there are three planes equidistant from all four points, corresponding to the three ways of partitioning the points into two pairs.[boxed{3}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is: There are four non-coplanar points. How many planes are equally distant from these four points? Hmm, let&#39;s try to figure this out step by step.First, let&#39;s recall that four non-coplanar points mean they don&#39;t all lie on the same plane, right? So they form a three-dimensional figure, maybe a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, four vertices, and six edges. So maybe this is a tetrahedron? I think in 3D space, four non-coplanar points are the vertices of a tetrahedron, so perhaps we can model this problem using a tetrahedron.Now, the question is about planes that are equally distant from all four points. Equidistant, I guess. Wait, but how can a plane be equidistant from four points in space? For a plane to be equidistant from points, each of those points must be at the same distance from the plane. So, the distance from each point to the plane is the same. Let me recall that the distance from a point to a plane is calculated by the formula: if the plane is ax + by + cz + d = 0, and the point is (x₀, y₀, z₀), then the distance is |ax₀ + by₀ + cz₀ + d| / sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, for four points, each with coordinates plugged into this formula, should give the same value. But solving such equations for four points might be complex. Maybe there&#39;s a geometric way to think about it. For example, in lower dimensions, the set of points equidistant from two points is the perpendicular bisector plane (in 3D) or line (in 2D). Similarly, in 3D, the set of points equidistant from three non-colinear points is a line (the perpendicular bisector line of the plane formed by the three points). But here, we have four points, so maybe the equidistant &quot;set&quot; is a point or something else? But the question is about planes equidistant from four points, not points equidistant.Wait, so we need planes where each of the four points has the same distance to the plane. Hmm. For a plane to be equidistant from four non-coplanar points, how is that possible?First, let&#39;s consider simpler cases. For two points, the set of planes equidistant from them is the perpendicular bisector plane of the segment connecting them. So, for two points, infinitely many planes (all those passing through the perpendicular bisector plane). For three points, if they are not colinear, then the set of planes equidistant from them would be... Hmm, maybe the perpendicular line to the plane of the three points through their circumcenter? So, in that case, there&#39;s a line such that any plane containing this line and at the right angle would be equidistant? Wait, not sure. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe for three non-colinear points, the planes equidistant from all three would be the planes that pass through the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the three points? Wait, no, the circumcircle is in the plane of the triangle. If we&#39;re talking about planes in 3D space, equidistant to three points. Let me recall that the set of points equidistant to three points is a line (the perpendicular line to the plane of the triangle through its circumcenter). Therefore, the set of planes equidistant to three points would be planes perpendicular to this line at specific distances? Hmm, maybe not.Alternatively, perhaps there are no planes equidistant to three non-colinear points unless they lie on a circle. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.If I have three points in a plane, then in that plane, the set of points equidistant to all three is the circumcenter (if they form a triangle). But in 3D, the set of points equidistant to three non-colinear points is a line perpendicular to the plane of the triangle through the circumcenter. So, if we are looking for planes equidistant to three points, maybe the plane has to be equidistant in some way.Wait, maybe if the three points are in a plane, then a plane parallel to that plane at some distance could be equidistant? No, if the three points are in a plane, a parallel plane would have each point at the same distance only if all three points are equidistant from the parallel plane, which would mean they lie on a line or something. Wait, this seems complicated.Alternatively, for four points, maybe there&#39;s a unique plane equidistant to all four? But the problem states &quot;how many planes,&quot; so we need to count them. The answer is probably a specific number.Let me recall that in 3D space, given four non-coplanar points, the number of planes equidistant from all four is 7. Wait, is that right? But why 7? Maybe I should try to visualize.First, if we have a tetrahedron, there are several planes associated with it. The bisecting planes between pairs of points, the planes of its faces, etc. But how does equidistant plane come into play?Wait, equidistant from all four points. So each of the four points is at the same distance from the plane. So, how can such a plane be situated with respect to the tetrahedron?Perhaps such a plane must pass through the centroid of the tetrahedron? Or maybe not. Let me think.Alternatively, for each pair of points, there is a plane equidistant to both. So, maybe for four points, you can have planes that bisect the tetrahedron in some way. But four points is more complex.Alternatively, consider that each plane equidistant to four points must lie in such a way that two points are on one side and two points are on the other side, each pair at the same distance. So, this is similar to a bisecting plane between two pairs of points. How many such planes are there?Given four non-coplanar points, how many ways can we split them into two pairs? For four points, the number of ways to partition into two pairs is 3. Each partition corresponds to a plane equidistant to both pairs. But perhaps each partition can give rise to multiple planes?Wait, for example, if we have two pairs of points, say (A,B) and (C,D), then the set of planes equidistant from (A,B) is the perpendicular bisector plane of segment AB, and similarly for (C,D). The intersection of these two planes would be a line, and along this line, there might be a plane that is equidistant to both pairs. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, for each pair of points, the plane equidistant to both is the perpendicular bisector plane. So, if we take two such perpendicular bisector planes, their intersection is a line. Then, along that line, there might be planes that are equidistant to all four points? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe there are three such planes, each corresponding to a different partition of the four points into two pairs. So, three planes. But the answer is 7, isn&#39;t it? Wait, I might be wrong here.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. For four points in general position (non-coplanar), the number of planes equidistant from all four can be found by considering that each plane must be the perpendicular bisector of a line segment connecting a pair of points, but since there are six pairs, maybe six planes? But no, that&#39;s not necessarily correct because the perpendicular bisector plane of a segment is equidistant to the two endpoints, but not necessarily to the other points.Alternatively, think about the reflection planes. For each face of the tetrahedron, there is a plane of reflection symmetry. But a tetrahedron has four faces, so four reflection planes. But these planes might not be equidistant to all four points.Wait, perhaps the answer is related to the concept of a &quot;bisector&quot; plane. For four points, maybe the number of planes equidistant to all four is equal to the number of ways the points can be arranged symmetrically with respect to the plane.In 3D space, for four non-coplanar points, the possible planes that are equidistant to all four can be in different configurations. Let&#39;s try enumerating them.First, if the plane is such that two points are on one side and two on the other, each pair being equidistant from the plane. For each such partition of the four points into two pairs, there is a plane that is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the centroids of each pair. Wait, maybe for each partition into two pairs, there is a unique plane equidistant to all four points? If there are three such partitions (since four points can be partitioned into two pairs in three ways), then three planes.Alternatively, if the plane is such that three points are on one side and one point on the other. In this case, the plane would need to be equidistant to all four points, but three points are on one side. However, this might not be possible because three points on one side and one on the other would require the single point to be at the same distance as each of the three, which would mean the three points lie on a plane parallel to the original plane but offset by some distance. But since the original four points are non-coplanar, this might not be possible. So maybe such planes don&#39;t exist.Similarly, if the plane has all four points on one side. Then, equidistant would mean they are all at the same distance, which would require them to lie on a plane parallel to the given plane. But since the four points are non-coplanar, this is impossible.Alternatively, if the plane contains one of the points. Then, that point is at distance zero, and the other three must be at the same non-zero distance. But again, since the four points are non-coplanar, the three points can&#39;t lie on a plane parallel to the given plane, so this might not be possible.So, the only possible configuration is that the plane has two points on each side. Each such plane is equidistant from the two pairs. For each partition of the four points into two pairs, there might be a unique plane. Since there are three ways to partition four points into two pairs, that would give three planes. But I remember reading somewhere that the answer is seven. So, where do the other four planes come from?Wait, maybe there are also planes that are equidistant to all four points without separating them into two pairs. For example, planes that pass through the centroid of the tetrahedron and are tangent to some sphere? Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, in a tetrahedron, there are seven planes of symmetry. Wait, no, a regular tetrahedron has six planes of symmetry, each passing through an edge and the midpoint of the opposite edge. But a general tetrahedron (non-regular) might not have any planes of symmetry. But since the problem states four non-coplanar points, not necessarily forming a regular tetrahedron, so perhaps symmetry isn&#39;t the right approach.Alternatively, think about the concept of the radical planes. In 3D, the radical plane of two spheres is the locus of points with equal power concerning both spheres. If we consider spheres centered at each of the four points with equal radii, then the radical planes would be where the planes are equidistant. But this seems complicated.Wait, let&#39;s consider the equation approach. Let the four points be A, B, C, D. Let the plane be defined by equation ax + by + cz + d = 0. The distance from each point to the plane is |ax_i + by_i + cz_i + d| / sqrt(a² + b² + c²). For these distances to be equal, we have |ax_A + by_A + cz_A + d| = |ax_B + by_B + cz_B + d| = |ax_C + by_C + cz_C + d| = |ax_D + by_D + cz_D + d|. Let&#39;s denote this common absolute value as k sqrt(a² + b² + c²), where k is the distance.So, we have four equations:ax_A + by_A + cz_A + d = ±k sqrt(a² + b² + c²)Similarly for B, C, D. But this seems too abstract. Maybe we can subtract equations pairwise. For example, subtract the equation for A and B:a(x_A - x_B) + b(y_A - y_B) + c(z_A - z_B) = ±k sqrt(a² + b² + c²) - ±k sqrt(a² + b² + c²)Wait, this seems messy because of the ± signs. Alternatively, if we suppose that all four points lie on the same side of the plane, then the expressions inside the absolute value would have the same sign, so we can drop the absolute value. But since the four points are non-coplanar, they can&#39;t all lie on the same plane, but they can lie on the same side of a plane. However, if all four lie on the same side, their distances would need to be equal, which would require them to lie on a plane parallel to the given plane, which contradicts them being non-coplanar. Therefore, the plane must have points on both sides. Therefore, some points have positive distances and some negative, but the absolute values are equal.So, suppose two points are on one side and two on the other. So, for two points, the expression ax + by + cz + d is equal to +k sqrt(a² + b² + c²), and for the other two, it&#39;s equal to -k sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, we have:ax_A + by_A + cz_A + d = ax_B + by_B + cz_B + d = k sqrt(a² + b² + c²)ax_C + by_C + cz_C + d = ax_D + by_D + cz_D + d = -k sqrt(a² + b² + c²)Subtracting the equations for A and B, we get a(x_A - x_B) + b(y_A - y_B) + c(z_A - z_B) = 0Similarly, subtracting equations for C and D: a(x_C - x_D) + b(y_C - y_D) + c(z_C - z_D) = 0Also, subtracting equation A and C: a(x_A - x_C) + b(y_A - y_C) + c(z_A - z_C) + 2d = 2k sqrt(a² + b² + c²)This seems complex. Maybe there&#39;s a better way.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that if two points are equidistant from the plane, then the plane is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining those two points. So, if the plane is equidistant to all four points, it must be a perpendicular bisector for each pair. But that&#39;s only possible if all pairs are symmetric with respect to the plane, which would require the plane to be a symmetry plane of the tetrahedron. However, a general tetrahedron doesn&#39;t have symmetry planes. Only regular tetrahedrons have symmetry planes.But the problem states four non-coplanar points, not necessarily a regular tetrahedron. So, maybe in the general case, such planes don&#39;t exist, but the answer is non-zero.Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to look for the answer in another way.I remember that in 3D space, the number of planes equidistant from four non-coplanar points is 7. The reasoning is as follows:For four non-coplanar points, there are two types of equidistant planes:1. Planes that bisect the four points such that two points are on each side. There are three ways to partition four points into two pairs, and for each partition, there is one plane. So, 3 planes.2. Planes that pass through one of the points and are equidistant to the other three. For each point, there is one such plane. Since there are four points, this gives 4 planes.3. Additionally, there might be planes that are equidistant to all four points without passing through any of them. Wait, but how?Wait, if a plane is equidistant to four non-coplanar points, and it doesn&#39;t pass through any of them, then the four points must lie on two different sides of the plane, with two points on each side. So, that&#39;s the first case. So, 3 planes.But if we consider that for three points, the set of points equidistant to them is a line (the perpendicular line to their plane through the circumcenter). So, perhaps a plane that is equidistant to three points must contain this line. Then, if we want a plane equidistant to four points, it must be equidistant to the fourth point as well. So, the intersection of the equidistant line of three points and the equidistant plane of the fourth point... but this seems complex.Alternatively, maybe for each of the four points, the plane that is equidistant to the other three. How?If we take three points, then the set of points equidistant to them is a line. Then, a plane that contains this line and is at a certain distance from the fourth point. Wait, but how?Alternatively, perhaps the plane is the set of points equidistant to three points and the fourth point. So, if we fix three points, the locus of points equidistant to them is a line. Then, the points on this line that are also equidistant to the fourth point would be the intersection of this line with the perpendicular bisector plane of the segment connecting the fourth point to any of the first three. So, this would give a unique point. Therefore, for each set of three points, there is one plane equidistant to all four points. Since there are four such sets (choosing three out of four points), this gives four planes.So, combining the two cases: 3 planes from partitioning into two pairs and 4 planes from each trio, totaling 7 planes. Hence, the answer is 7.Wait, that seems to make sense. Let me verify:Case 1: Partitioning the four points into two pairs. Each partition gives a unique plane equidistant from both pairs. There are three such partitions (since the number of ways to split four elements into two pairs is 3). So, 3 planes.Case 2: For each individual point, find a plane that is equidistant from that point and the other three. For each point, there is one such plane. Since there are four points, 4 planes.Total: 3 + 4 = 7 planes.Therefore, the answer should be 7.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about this in another way. For four points in general position (non-coplanar), the number of equidistant planes can be determined by the different configurations:- Planes bisecting the set into two pairs: 3 planes.- Planes through one point and equidistant to the other three: 4 planes.Hence, total of 7.Therefore, the answer is boxed{7}.Final Answerboxed{7}&lt;/think&gt;Given four non-coplanar points, we need to determine the number of planes that are equally distant from all four points. 1. Partitioning into Two Pairs:   - For four non-coplanar points, we can partition them into two pairs in three different ways. Each partition corresponds to a plane that is equidistant from both pairs of points. This results in 3 planes.2. Equidistant Planes for Each Point:   - For each of the four points, there exists a plane that is equidistant from that point and the other three points. This results in 4 planes (one for each point).Combining these two cases, we get a total of (3 + 4 = 7) planes.Thus, the number of planes equally distant from all four non-coplanar points is (boxed{7}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-40815de7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>🔑:</span>4.3. All 4 points cannot be on the same side of a plane, as they would otherwise be coplanar. Thus, we distinguish two cases. In the first case, three points are located on one side of the plane, and the fourth is on the other side. There are four such planes. In the second case, two points are located on different sides of the plane. The selection of a pair of points then uniquely determines the plane. It represents the perpendicular bisector of the common normal of the skew lines determined by the corresponding pairs of points. In this case, we have three planes. In total, therefore, seven.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-3299abab data-v-40815de7><div class="review" data-v-40815de7><div class="review-title" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>❓:</span>If sin theta =1-log_{2}x, then the range of x is (     )A: [1,4]B: [frac{1}{4},1]C: [2,4]D: [frac{1}{4},4]</div><div class="divider" data-v-40815de7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the range of x for which sinθ equals 1 minus the logarithm base 2 of x. The answer choices are given as intervals, so I need to find all possible x values that satisfy the equation sinθ = 1 - log₂x. Hmm, let&#39;s start by recalling some basic facts about the sine function and logarithms.First, the sine of any angle θ must lie between -1 and 1. That&#39;s a fundamental property of the sine function. So, whatever 1 - log₂x is, it has to be within that interval. Therefore, I can write:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Now, I need to solve this compound inequality for x. Let&#39;s break it down into two separate inequalities:1. 1 - log₂x ≤ 12. -1 ≤ 1 - log₂xStarting with the first inequality: 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:-log₂x ≤ 0Multiplying both sides by -1 (and remembering to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying by a negative):log₂x ≥ 0A logarithm base 2 of x is greater than or equal to 0 when x is greater than or equal to 2^0, which is 1. So from this inequality, we get x ≥ 1.Now, moving to the second inequality: -1 ≤ 1 - log₂xSubtracting 1 from both sides:-2 ≤ -log₂xMultiplying both sides by -1 again, which reverses the inequality:2 ≥ log₂xWhich is the same as:log₂x ≤ 2This implies that x ≤ 2^2, which is 4. So from the second inequality, x ≤ 4.Putting both inequalities together: 1 ≤ x ≤ 4. So the range of x is [1,4]. Looking back at the answer choices, that&#39;s option A.Wait a second, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with logarithms and inequalities, especially reversing signs, it&#39;s easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each step again.Starting with the original inequality:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1First, solving the left part: -1 ≤ 1 - log₂xSubtract 1 from both sides: -2 ≤ -log₂xMultiply by -1 (reverse inequality): 2 ≥ log₂x → log₂x ≤ 2 → x ≤ 4. That seems right.Then solving the right part: 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Subtract 1: -log₂x ≤ 0 → log₂x ≥ 0 → x ≥ 1. That also checks out.So combining these, x must be between 1 and 4, inclusive. Therefore, the range is [1,4], which is option A. But hold on, the answer choices include option D: [1/4,4]. Maybe I missed something here?Wait, maybe I need to consider the domain of the logarithm function. The logarithm base 2 of x is only defined when x &gt; 0. However, in my solution, x is already between 1 and 4, which are positive numbers, so that&#39;s already covered. So the domain of log₂x is satisfied.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the manipulation. Let me check again.Original inequality:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Let me solve the left inequality first:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂xSubtract 1: -2 ≤ -log₂xMultiply by -1: 2 ≥ log₂x → log₂x ≤ 2 → x ≤ 4Right inequality:1 - log₂x ≤ 1Subtract 1: -log₂x ≤ 0Multiply by -1: log₂x ≥ 0 → x ≥ 1So combining x ≥ 1 and x ≤ 4 gives [1,4]. Therefore, the answer should be A. But why is option D present? Let me check if perhaps there was a miscalculation.Wait, is it possible that when we reverse the inequality, we might have to adjust something else? Let&#39;s see:From the left inequality: -1 ≤ 1 - log₂x=&gt; -1 -1 ≤ -log₂x=&gt; -2 ≤ -log₂xMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):2 ≥ log₂xWhich is log₂x ≤ 2 → x ≤ 4. Correct.Right inequality: 1 - log₂x ≤1Same as before.Hmm. Maybe the problem is that when dealing with logarithms, we can also have negative values? Wait, if log₂x can be negative, which it is when x is between 0 and 1. However, in our solution, x is between 1 and 4, which restricts log₂x to be between 0 and 2. But perhaps when they set the equation sinθ = 1 - log₂x, the right-hand side must be in the range [-1,1], but if x is allowed to be less than 1, then log₂x can be negative, making 1 - log₂x larger than 1. Wait, but sine can&#39;t be larger than 1. So if x is less than 1, log₂x is negative, so 1 - log₂x would be 1 minus a negative number, which is 1 + |log₂x|, which would be greater than 1. But sine cannot be greater than 1, so those x&#39;s would be invalid. Similarly, if x is greater than 4, log₂x is greater than 2, so 1 - log₂x would be less than -1, which is also outside the sine range. Therefore, x must be between 1 and 4. Hence, answer A. Therefore, I think the answer is A.But why is there an option D? Let me check the problem again.The problem says: &quot;If sinθ = 1 - log₂x, then the range of x is (     )&quot; with options A to D. The options are:A: [1,4]B: [1/4,1]C: [2,4]D: [1/4,4]Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in solving the inequalities. Let me try solving the original inequality again step by step.Starting with:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Let me subtract 1 from all parts:-1 -1 ≤ - log₂x ≤ 1 -1Which is:-2 ≤ - log₂x ≤ 0Then multiply all parts by -1, remembering to reverse the inequalities:2 ≥ log₂x ≥ 0Which is equivalent to:0 ≤ log₂x ≤ 2Now, converting back to x by exponentiating each part with base 2:2^0 ≤ x ≤ 2^2Which is:1 ≤ x ≤ 4Therefore, the range is [1,4], which is option A. So I think the answer is A. Maybe option D is a common mistake if someone incorrectly manipulates the inequality? Let me see.Wait, perhaps someone could mistakenly not reverse the inequality signs when multiplying by -1? Let&#39;s see. If we have:-2 ≤ -log₂x ≤ 0If someone multiplies by -1 but forgets to reverse the inequalities, they would get:2 ≤ log₂x ≤ 0Which is impossible since 2 is not less than 0. So that&#39;s not possible.Alternatively, maybe someone subtracts 1 incorrectly?Wait, original inequality:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1If someone subtracts 1 in a wrong way, but I don&#39;t see how. Alternatively, maybe they consider that log₂x can take values from negative infinity to positive infinity, but when solving for x, you have to restrict to x &gt; 0. But in our solution, x is already between 1 and 4, which is positive. So that&#39;s covered.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a misunderstanding in the problem? If θ is restricted to a certain domain, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify. It just says sinθ = 1 - log₂x. So θ can be any real number such that sinθ is in [-1,1]. Therefore, we just need 1 - log₂x to be in [-1,1], leading to x in [1,4].Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation in the step where we go from log₂x ≥ 0 to x ≥ 1. Since log₂x is greater than or equal to 0 when x is greater than or equal to 1, correct. And log₂x ≤ 2 implies x ≤ 4, correct. So that&#39;s [1,4].Therefore, the correct answer should be A. However, the presence of option D is confusing. Let me check the problem statement again to make sure I didn&#39;t misread anything.The problem states: If sinθ = 1 - log₂x, then the range of x is (     ). The options are A: [1,4], B: [1/4,1], C: [2,4], D: [1/4,4].Wait, perhaps there&#39;s an error in the problem&#39;s options, but given the way it&#39;s presented, I need to choose from these. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that θ is in a certain interval? The problem doesn&#39;t specify, so θ can be any real number. Therefore, sinθ can be any value between -1 and 1. Therefore, 1 - log₂x must lie in [-1,1], so solving for x gives [1,4]. So the answer is A.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese and there&#39;s a translation error? But no, the problem is presented in English. Wait, the original problem might have been in Chinese, but the translation seems accurate here.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider complex logarithms? But no, since x is a real number in the logarithm, and the problem is about real functions.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where even though 1 - log₂x must lie between -1 and 1, but log₂x can take values beyond that, but we have to restrict x so that 1 - log₂x is within the sine&#39;s range. Therefore, as we did, leading to x in [1,4].Alternatively, maybe I should check with sample values. Let me pick x=1. Then log₂1=0, so 1 - 0=1, which is sinθ=1. That&#39;s valid because sinθ=1 at θ=π/2 + 2πk. So x=1 is allowed.x=4: log₂4=2, so 1 - 2=-1, which is sinθ=-1, valid at θ=3π/2 + 2πk. So x=4 is allowed.What about x=2: log₂2=1, so 1 -1=0. sinθ=0 is valid at θ=0, π, 2π, etc.x=1/2: log₂(1/2)=-1, so 1 - (-1)=2. But sinθ=2 is impossible, so x=1/2 is invalid.Similarly, x=8: log₂8=3, so 1 -3=-2, sinθ=-2 is invalid.Therefore, x must be between 1 and 4. So answer A. Hence, even with test values, it&#39;s confirmed. So why is option D present? Maybe a common mistake where someone flips the inequality incorrectly and includes 1/4? Let me see.If someone incorrectly solves 1 - log₂x ≥ -1:1 - log₂x ≥ -1Subtract 1: -log₂x ≥ -2Multiply by -1: log₂x ≤ 2 → x ≤ 4. That&#39;s correct.But if someone instead of that, does:From 1 - log₂x ≥ -1:Add log₂x to both sides: 1 ≥ -1 + log₂xAdd 1 to both sides: 2 ≥ log₂x. Same result.Alternatively, maybe they set up 1 - log₂x ≥ -1 and 1 - log₂x ≤1, and solve both. Which is what I did.Alternatively, maybe they think log₂x can be from -2 to 2, leading to x from 1/4 to 4. But that would be incorrect because 1 - log₂x must be between -1 and 1, not log₂x itself. Let me see.If someone thought that log₂x must be between -1 and1, then x would be between 1/2 and 2. But that&#39;s not the case.Alternatively, if someone set up:Since sinθ =1 - log₂x, then 1 - log₂x must be between -1 and1. So:-1 ≤1 - log₂x ≤1Subtract 1:-2 ≤ - log₂x ≤0Multiply by -1 (reverse inequalities):2 ≥ log₂x ≥0Which translates to:0 ≤ log₂x ≤2Thus, x is between 2^0=1 and 2^2=4, so [1,4]. So that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, someone might solve:From -1 ≤1 - log₂x ≤1,Then, subtract 1:-2 ≤ - log₂x ≤0,Then, divide by -1 (without reversing inequalities):2 ≥ log₂x ≥0,Which is same as above.But if someone mistakenly reverses only one inequality? For example:From -2 ≤ - log₂x ≤0,Multiply by -1:Left inequality: 2 ≥ log₂x,Right inequality: 0 ≤ log₂x,But that is combining to 0 ≤ log₂x ≤2,Which is correct. So no, that&#39;s not a mistake.Alternatively, maybe the problem originally had log_2(x) with a coefficient, but here it&#39;s 1 - log_2x. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the range of θ instead of x, but no, it&#39;s asking for the range of x. So unless there&#39;s a misread, but the user specifies the problem as given.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation when exponentiating. Let&#39;s check:If log₂x is between 0 and2, then x is between 2^0=1 and 2^2=4. So that&#39;s [1,4]. So that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, if someone thought log₂x is between -2 and2, then x would be between 1/4 and4. But that&#39;s not correct because 1 - log₂x must be between -1 and1, so log₂x must be between0 and2, not -2 and2.Wait, if someone set 1 - log₂x &gt;= -1, then log₂x &lt;= 2, and 1 - log₂x &lt;=1, which gives log₂x &gt;=0. So log₂x is between0 and2, so x is between1 and4. Therefore, the answer is A. Hence, the answer is A.But why is D an option? Maybe the test question is trying to trick students into combining the domains where log₂x is defined (x&gt;0) with the solution? But even so, the solution [1,4] is within x&gt;0, so that&#39;s not necessary.Alternatively, maybe there was a different approach where someone considered θ&#39;s domain. For example, θ is such that sinθ is defined, but θ can be any real number, so sinθ can be between -1 and1, hence 1 - log₂x must be in that interval, leading to x in [1,4]. So answer A.Alternatively, if someone thought that θ is restricted to a principal value, say θ in [-π/2, π/2], but even then, sinθ can still be between -1 and1. So it doesn&#39;t affect the result.Therefore, after thorough checking, I think the correct answer is A: [1,4]. The other options don&#39;t fit.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation (sin theta = 1 - log_{2} x), we need to determine the range of (x). First, recall that the sine function (sin theta) must lie between -1 and 1. Therefore, we have the inequality:[-1 leq 1 - log_{2} x leq 1]We solve this compound inequality step by step:1. Right part of the inequality:   [   1 - log_{2} x leq 1   ]   Subtract 1 from both sides:   [   -log_{2} x leq 0   ]   Multiply by -1 (reversing the inequality):   [   log_{2} x geq 0   ]   This implies:   [   x geq 2^0 = 1   ]2. Left part of the inequality:   [   -1 leq 1 - log_{2} x   ]   Subtract 1 from both sides:   [   -2 leq -log_{2} x   ]   Multiply by -1 (reversing the inequality):   [   2 geq log_{2} x   ]   This implies:   [   x leq 2^2 = 4   ]Combining both results, we get:[1 leq x leq 4]Thus, the range of (x) is ([1, 4]), which corresponds to option A.[boxed{A}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this trigonometry problem here: If sinθ equals 1 minus log base 2 of x, then I need to find the range of x. The options are given as A to D. Let me see how to approach this.First, I know that the sine function has a range between -1 and 1. That is, for any angle θ, the value of sinθ must satisfy -1 ≤ sinθ ≤ 1. So whatever 1 - log₂x is, it has to be within this interval. The equation given is sinθ = 1 - log₂x. Therefore, substituting the range of sine into this equation, I can write:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Now, I need to solve this inequality for x. Let me break it down into two separate inequalities.First, the left part: -1 ≤ 1 - log₂xSubtract 1 from both sides:-1 - 1 ≤ - log₂xWhich simplifies to:-2 ≤ - log₂xMultiply both sides by -1, which reverses the inequality:2 ≥ log₂xOr, log₂x ≤ 2Converting this logarithmic inequality to exponential form:x ≤ 2² =&gt; x ≤ 4Okay, that gives me the upper bound for x as 4.Now the right part of the original inequality: 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Subtract 1 from both sides:- log₂x ≤ 0Multiply both sides by -1 (again reversing the inequality):log₂x ≥ 0Converting this to exponential form:x ≥ 2⁰ =&gt; x ≥ 1So combining both inequalities, x must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 4. So the range of x is [1, 4]. Hmm, that would correspond to option A.Wait a second, but the answer choices include [1/4, 1], [2,4], [1/4,4], and [1,4]. So according to my calculation, the answer is A. But let me check again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting with -1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1.Let me rephrase the left inequality first:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂xSubtract 1: -2 ≤ -log₂xMultiply by -1 (reverse inequality): 2 ≥ log₂x, so log₂x ≤ 2, which is x ≤ 2² = 4. That seems right.Right inequality:1 - log₂x ≤ 1Subtract 1: -log₂x ≤ 0Multiply by -1: log₂x ≥ 0, which is x ≥ 2⁰ = 1. So x ≥ 1. Therefore, combining both, x is between 1 and 4 inclusive. So [1,4], which is option A.But wait, I feel like sometimes when dealing with logarithmic inequalities, especially with different domains, but the log base 2 is defined for x &gt; 0. So in the problem statement, is there any restriction on x besides the result of the inequality? The logarithm log₂x is defined when x &gt; 0. But in our solution, x is between 1 and 4, which is within x &gt; 0, so that&#39;s fine.But let me check if perhaps I messed up the direction of the inequalities when multiplying by -1. Let&#39;s verify each step again.Left inequality:Start with -1 ≤ 1 - log₂x.Subtract 1: -2 ≤ -log₂x.Multiply by -1: 2 ≥ log₂x. Which is correct because when you multiply or divide by a negative number, the inequality flips. So 2 ≥ log₂x is correct, which is log₂x ≤ 2, so x ≤ 4.Right inequality:1 - log₂x ≤ 1.Subtract 1: -log₂x ≤ 0.Multiply by -1: log₂x ≥ 0. Which is correct, flipping the inequality. So log₂x ≥ 0 implies x ≥ 1. Therefore, x must be in [1,4], which is option A. But wait, the given options include D: [1/4,4]. Why is that? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a misunderstanding here. The problem says sinθ = 1 - log₂x. So the sine function ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, 1 - log₂x must also be between -1 and 1.So, writing that as:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1.Yes. Then solving:Left inequality: -1 ≤ 1 - log₂xSubtract 1: -2 ≤ -log₂xMultiply by -1: 2 ≥ log₂x → log₂x ≤ 2 → x ≤ 4.Right inequality: 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Subtract 1: -log₂x ≤ 0Multiply by -1: log₂x ≥ 0 → x ≥ 1.So x ∈ [1,4]. So answer A. But why is there an option D which is [1/4,4]? Let me check again.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the inequalities. Let me check the steps again.Original inequality: -1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤ 1Subtract 1 from all parts:-1 -1 ≤ -log₂x ≤ 1 -1Simplifies to:-2 ≤ -log₂x ≤ 0Multiply all parts by -1, which reverses the inequalities:2 ≥ log₂x ≥ 0So log₂x is between 0 and 2.Therefore, converting to x:x = 2^{log₂x}, so x is between 2^0 and 2^2, which is 1 and 4. So x ∈ [1,4]. So that&#39;s correct. So answer is A.But perhaps the answer is D? Maybe the problem is written differently. Let me check again.Wait, if the equation was sinθ = log₂x -1 instead of 1 - log₂x, then the range would be different. Let me confirm the original problem.Original problem: &quot;If sinθ =1−log₂x, then the range of x is (     )&quot;Yes, so it&#39;s 1 minus log₂x. So that&#39;s correct. Therefore, solving gives x ∈ [1,4], which is option A. So why is D an option here? Maybe I need to check if the question was copied correctly.Wait, perhaps when I subtract 1, I should have done it differently. Let me do the entire process again.Given sinθ = 1 - log₂x.We know that sinθ ∈ [-1,1]. Therefore:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤1Let me subtract 1 from all parts:Left: -1 -1 ≤ -log₂x → -2 ≤ -log₂xMiddle: 1 - log₂x stays, but actually, subtract 1:Wait, no, the correct way is to subtract 1 from all three parts:Left part: -1 -1 ≤ -log₂xMiddle part: 1 - log₂x -1 becomes -log₂xRight part: 1 -1 is 0Wait, actually, when solving inequalities with three parts, the operation is applied to all three parts. Let me see:Original inequality:-1 ≤ 1 - log₂x ≤1Subtract 1 from all three parts:-1 -1 ≤ -log₂x ≤ 1 -1Which gives:-2 ≤ -log₂x ≤0Then multiply all parts by -1, reversing inequalities:2 ≥ log₂x ≥0Which is the same as:0 ≤ log₂x ≤2Therefore, converting to x:2^0 ≤ x ≤2^2 → 1 ≤x ≤4.Therefore, x is in [1,4]. So answer A. So why is D: [1/4,4] an option? Maybe a miscalculation when reversing the inequality?Wait, maybe when multiplying by -1, the direction is reversed, but let&#39;s check:If we have -2 ≤ -log₂x ≤0Multiply by -1:2 ≥ log₂x ≥0Which is the same as 0 ≤ log₂x ≤2Which gives x in [1,4]. So that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, if someone incorrectly multiplied without flipping the inequality, they would get log₂x ≥2 and log₂x ≤0, which would lead to x ≥4 or x ≤1, but that&#39;s not the case here.Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation when solving the inequalities. Let me check again.Alternatively, perhaps the original problem was written with sinθ = log₂x -1, which would flip the signs. Let&#39;s see:If sinθ = log₂x -1, then the range would be:-1 ≤ log₂x -1 ≤1Add 1 to all parts:0 ≤ log₂x ≤2Which gives x ∈ [1,4], same result. Wait, same answer. Hmm.Alternatively, if the equation was sinθ = |1 - log₂x|, then the range would be different. But the problem states sinθ =1 - log₂x. So unless there&#39;s a modulus, but there isn&#39;t.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider different quadrants or something. Wait, but sine can take any value between -1 and 1 regardless of the quadrant, so θ can be any angle such that sinθ is in that range, which is always possible. So the only constraint is on the expression 1 - log₂x, which must lie in [-1,1]. So that gives log₂x must be between 0 and 2, hence x between 1 and 4.Therefore, the correct answer should be A. But the options include D: [1/4,4]. Maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation here. Wait, perhaps in solving the inequality.Wait, let me consider this again.Original inequality:-1 ≤1 - log₂x ≤1Let me split it into two inequalities:1 - log₂x ≥ -1 and 1 - log₂x ≤1First inequality:1 - log₂x ≥ -1Subtract 1:-log₂x ≥ -2Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):log₂x ≤2Which gives x ≤4Second inequality:1 - log₂x ≤1Subtract 1:-log₂x ≤0Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):log₂x ≥0Which gives x ≥1Therefore, combining both, x ∈ [1,4]. So answer A.Therefore, the answer is A. But the options given are A: [1,4], B: [1/4,1], C: [2,4], D: [1/4,4]. So if the answer is A, then A is correct. But maybe the problem was copied incorrectly? Let me check again the original problem.Original problem: &quot;If sinθ =1−log₂x, then the range of x is (     ). A: [1,4], B: [1/4,1], C: [2,4], D: [1/4,4]&quot;.Yes, so the answer should be A. But just to make sure, maybe the problem is written with log base 2 of x, so log₂x. Maybe the user confused log base 2 with log base 10 or natural log? But no, the problem specifies log base 2.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a miscalculation when converting the logarithmic inequality. Let me check:log₂x ≤2 implies x ≤2²=4log₂x ≥0 implies x ≥2⁰=1. So yes, x ∈ [1,4]. So A is correct.But maybe the answer is D: [1/4,4]. Let me see why that could be. If someone incorrectly solved the inequality as follows:Starting from -1 ≤1 - log₂x ≤1Subtract 1: -2 ≤-log₂x ≤0Multiply by -1: 2 ≥log₂x ≥0But if they thought that multiplying inequalities in separate steps and messed up the direction, but no, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe they considered that log₂x can be negative. For example, if x is between 1/4 and 1, log₂x is between -2 and 0. But in this problem, log₂x is involved in the expression 1 - log₂x. So if log₂x is negative, then 1 - log₂x would be greater than 1. But the sine function can&#39;t be greater than 1. Therefore, 1 - log₂x must be ≤1, which requires log₂x ≥0, hence x ≥1. Therefore, x cannot be less than 1 because that would make the sine function exceed 1, which is impossible.Similarly, if log₂x is greater than 2, then 1 - log₂x would be less than -1, which is also impossible for sine. Therefore, x must be between 1 and 4. So answer is A.But wait, perhaps there&#39;s a different interpretation. Maybe θ is restricted to a certain interval? But the problem doesn&#39;t specify any restrictions on θ. Since sine can take any angle, θ can be any real number, but the sine of any real number is always between -1 and 1. Therefore, regardless of θ, 1 - log₂x must lie in [-1,1]. Therefore, the same conclusion.Alternatively, perhaps the question was mistyped, and the original problem had sinθ =1 - log₂(x/4), which would change the base. Let me check. If the equation was sinθ =1 - log₂(x/4), then:log₂(x/4) = log₂x - log₂4 = log₂x -2.Therefore, 1 - log₂(x/4) =1 - (log₂x -2)=3 - log₂x. Then the equation would be sinθ =3 - log₂x, but sinθ can&#39;t be more than 1, so 3 - log₂x ≤1 ⇒ log₂x ≥2 ⇒x≥4, and 3 - log₂x ≥-1 ⇒log₂x ≤4 ⇒x ≤16. So x∈[4,16], which isn&#39;t any of the options. So that&#39;s not the case.Alternatively, if it was log₂(4x), then log₂4x = log₂4 + log₂x =2 + log₂x. So 1 - log₂(4x)=1 -2 - log₂x= -1 - log₂x. Then sinθ = -1 - log₂x. Then:-1 ≤ -1 - log₂x ≤1Adding 1:0 ≤ -log₂x ≤2Multiply by -1:0 ≥ log₂x ≥ -2 ⇒ -2 ≤ log₂x ≤0 ⇒x∈[1/4,1]. Which is option B. But again, the original problem is stated as log₂x, not log₂(4x) or anything else.Therefore, unless there&#39;s a misinterpretation, the answer is A: [1,4]. However, the options include D: [1/4,4]. Let me check once more.Wait, could there be an error in how I manipulated the inequalities? Let me verify once again.Given:-1 ≤1 - log₂x ≤1Subtract 1:-2 ≤ -log₂x ≤0Multiply by -1 (remember to reverse inequalities):2 ≥ log₂x ≥0Which is equivalent to:0 ≤ log₂x ≤2Therefore, x is between 2^0=1 and 2^2=4. Hence, x∈[1,4]. So answer A. So I don&#39;t see any mistake here.Alternatively, if someone thought that log₂x can be from -2 to 2, leading to x from 1/4 to 4, but that would be incorrect because in the inequality, log₂x is only allowed to be between 0 and 2, not -2 to 2. Because in the process, we derived log₂x between 0 and 2, not -2 to 2.So if someone mistakenly thought that since multiplying by -1 flips the inequality, but maybe they thought log₂x can be from -2 to 2, leading to x from 1/4 to 4. But that&#39;s not the case here. The correct interval is [1,4].Therefore, I think the correct answer is A. But since the options include D, which is [1/4,4], I need to check if there is a different approach.Wait, perhaps I should consider the equation sinθ =1 - log₂x. Since sinθ is between -1 and1, we have:1 - log₂x ∈ [-1,1]Which implies:log₂x ∈ [0,2]Thus, x ∈ [1,4]. So answer A. So why is D an option? Maybe the problem was in Chinese and there was a mistranslation? Or perhaps the original problem had a different equation. But as per the given problem, the answer is A.Alternatively, perhaps the problem was presented incorrectly in the question here. Let me check once again.Original problem as presented: &quot;If sinθ =1−log₂x, then the range of x is (     ) A: [1,4] B: [1/4,1] C: [2,4] D: [1/4,4]&quot;.Yes, as given. So the answer is A. Therefore, unless I made a fundamental mistake in solving inequalities, which I don&#39;t see, the answer should be A.But given that D is a common distractor, maybe the test maker thought that the log can be negative and positive, but in this case, because of the equation, log₂x is restricted to [0,2], not the entire real line. So x is restricted accordingly.Therefore, I will stick with answer A: [1,4].Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation (sin theta = 1 - log_{2} x), we need to determine the range of (x).1. The sine function (sin theta) has a range of ([-1, 1]). Therefore, the expression (1 - log_{2} x) must lie within this interval:   [   -1 leq 1 - log_{2} x leq 1   ]2. Solving the left part of the inequality:   [   -1 leq 1 - log_{2} x   ]   Subtract 1 from both sides:   [   -2 leq -log_{2} x   ]   Multiply by -1 (reversing the inequality):   [   2 geq log_{2} x   ]   Converting to exponential form:   [   x leq 2^2 implies x leq 4   ]3. Solving the right part of the inequality:   [   1 - log_{2} x leq 1   ]   Subtract 1 from both sides:   [   -log_{2} x leq 0   ]   Multiply by -1 (reversing the inequality):   [   log_{2} x geq 0   ]   Converting to exponential form:   [   x geq 2^0 implies x geq 1   ]4. Combining both results, we find:   [   1 leq x leq 4   ]Thus, the range of (x) is ([1, 4]), which corresponds to option (boxed{A}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-40815de7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>🔑:</span>AnalysisThis question mainly examines the graph and properties of the sine function, as well as the properties of the logarithmic function.SolutionGiven log_{2}x=1-sin theta,Since -1leqslant sin thetaleqslant 1,It follows that 0leqslant log_{2}xleqslant 2, solving this yields 1leqslant xleqslant 4,Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{A}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-3299abab data-v-40815de7><div class="review" data-v-40815de7><div class="review-title" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>❓:</span>8.

I need to find the range of the function f(x) = 2|sin x| + 3|cos x|. Hmm, so the range is all the possible values that this function can take as x varies over all real numbers. Since sine and cosine are periodic functions, their absolute values will also be periodic. The function f(x) is a combination of these absolute values scaled by coefficients 2 and 3. First, I remember that the range of |sin x| is [0,1], and similarly |cos x| is [0,1]. So multiplying by 2 and 3, the terms 2|sin x| and 3|cos x| would have ranges [0,2] and [0,3] respectively. But since they are added together, maybe the maximum and minimum of the sum aren&#39;t just 0+0=0 and 2+3=5? Probably not, because when one is at its maximum, the other might not be at its minimum. Since sin and cos are related, their absolute values also have some relationship.Wait, maybe I should think about the function without the absolute values first. If it were f(x) = 2 sin x + 3 cos x, then I know that the maximum and minimum can be found using the amplitude formula, which is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So the range would be [-sqrt(13), sqrt(13)]. But here, the function has absolute values. That complicates things because taking absolute values of sin and cos individually before adding them changes the behavior.Alternatively, since both |sin x| and |cos x| are non-negative, their combination will also be non-negative. So f(x) is always at least 0. But with coefficients 2 and 3, the minimum might be higher. Wait, when does 2|sin x| + 3|cos x| reach its minimum?Since both terms are non-negative, the minimum value would occur when both terms are as small as possible. But |sin x| and |cos x| can&#39;t both be zero at the same time. Because sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1, so if sin x is 0, then cos x is ±1, and vice versa. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) should be when either |sin x| is 0 or |cos x| is 0.If |sin x| = 0, then |cos x| = 1, so f(x) = 0 + 3*1 = 3.If |cos x| = 0, then |sin x| = 1, so f(x) = 2*1 + 0 = 2.Wait, but 2 is less than 3, so the minimum value of the function is 2? Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Let me check again.Wait, if |sin x| is 0, then f(x) is 3. If |cos x| is 0, then f(x) is 2. So 2 is smaller than 3, so the minimum value of f(x) is 2. But is that really the case? Because |sin x| and |cos x| can&#39;t both be zero, but they can take other values. For example, when x = π/4, then |sin x| = |cos x| = √2/2 ≈ 0.707. Then f(x) = 2*(√2/2) + 3*(√2/2) = (2 + 3)/√2 = 5/√2 ≈ 3.535. Which is between 2 and 5. Wait, but the previous minimum was 2, but maybe there&#39;s a lower value?Wait, suppose x is such that |sin x| is small but |cos x| is not 1. Maybe when |sin x| is small, |cos x| is slightly less than 1. Let me compute f(x) at x=0. At x=0, sin x=0, cos x=1, so f(x)=3. At x=π/2, sin x=1, cos x=0, so f(x)=2. At x=π/4, as before, f(x)=5/√2 ≈3.535. What about x=π/6? sin x=1/2, cos x=√3/2. So f(x)=2*(1/2) + 3*(√3/2)=1 + (3√3)/2 ≈1 + 2.598≈3.598. Hmm, higher than 3. So perhaps the minimum is indeed 2, and maximum is somewhere higher than 5/√2. Wait, but let&#39;s check when maybe both terms are contributing but maybe due to the coefficients, the maximum is higher.Alternatively, maybe I can use calculus to find the extrema. But since the function involves absolute values, the derivative might be tricky. Let&#39;s see. The function is periodic with period π/2, because after π/2, both |sin x| and |cos x| repeat their values. So maybe we can consider x in [0, π/2], and analyze the function there.In the interval [0, π/2], sin x and cos x are non-negative, so the absolute values can be removed. Therefore, f(x) = 2 sin x + 3 cos x. So in this interval, we can find the maximum and minimum.Wait, but in [0, π/2], sin x goes from 0 to 1, and cos x goes from 1 to 0. So f(x) = 2 sin x + 3 cos x starts at 3 when x=0, increases as sin x increases and cos x decreases? Wait, but 2 sin x + 3 cos x. Let&#39;s compute the derivative: f’(x) = 2 cos x - 3 sin x. Setting derivative to zero: 2 cos x - 3 sin x = 0 =&gt; 2 cos x = 3 sin x =&gt; tan x = 2/3. So x = arctan(2/3). Let&#39;s compute f(arctan(2/3)).Let’s let x = arctan(2/3). Then, in a right triangle, opposite side 2, adjacent side 3, hypotenuse sqrt(13). So sin x = 2/sqrt(13), cos x = 3/sqrt(13). Then f(x) = 2*(2/sqrt(13)) + 3*(3/sqrt(13)) = (4 + 9)/sqrt(13) = 13/sqrt(13) = sqrt(13) ≈3.605. So in the interval [0, π/2], the maximum is sqrt(13) and the minimum is 2 (at x=π/2) and 3 (at x=0). Wait, but wait, when x=0, f(x)=3, when x=π/2, f(x)=2, and the critical point at arctan(2/3) gives sqrt(13)≈3.605. So in this interval, the maximum is sqrt(13) and the minimum is 2. But since the original function is made up of absolute values, and the function is periodic with period π/2, then in each interval of length π/2, the behavior repeats. Therefore, the maximum of f(x) over all x is sqrt(13) and the minimum is 2. But wait, but sqrt(13) is approximately 3.605, but when x=π/4, we get 5/√2≈3.535, which is less than sqrt(13). Wait, so maybe my calculation was wrong.Wait, no. At x=arctan(2/3), which is approximately 0.588 radians (since arctan(2/3)≈33.69 degrees), sin x≈0.5547, cos x≈0.832. Then f(x)=2*0.5547 +3*0.832≈1.109 +2.496≈3.605, which is sqrt(13). So in the interval [0, π/2], the maximum is sqrt(13), and the minimum is 2 at x=π/2.But wait, then in other intervals, the function would have the same maximum and minimum? For example, in the interval [π/2, π], sin x is still non-negative, but cos x is non-positive. So |cos x| = -cos x. So f(x)=2 sin x + 3*(-cos x). But in this interval, sin x decreases from 1 to 0, and |cos x| increases from 0 to 1. So f(x)=2 sin x + 3 |cos x|. Similarly, but the critical points here would be different. Wait, maybe we need to analyze each interval where sin and cos are positive or negative, but due to the absolute values, the function is actually symmetric in each quadrant.Alternatively, since the function is periodic with period π/2, as in each quadrant (0 to π/2, π/2 to π, etc.), the behavior of |sin x| and |cos x| repeats. Therefore, the maximum and minimum values would be the same in each interval.But wait, if that&#39;s the case, then the maximum value of f(x) is sqrt(13), and the minimum is 2. But when x=0, f(x)=3; when x=π/2, f(x)=2. So the function&#39;s minimum is 2, and maximum is sqrt(13). But wait, sqrt(13)≈3.605, which is less than 5. Wait, but when x=0, f(x)=3, which is less than sqrt(13). So the maximum is sqrt(13), which occurs at x=arctan(2/3). Then, in other intervals, when we take absolute values, the function is symmetric, so the maximum remains sqrt(13), and the minimum remains 2. So the range of f(x) would be [2, sqrt(13)].But let me check another interval. Let&#39;s take x in [π, 3π/2]. Here, sin x is negative, so |sin x| = -sin x; cos x is negative, so |cos x| = -cos x. Then f(x)=2*(-sin x) + 3*(-cos x) = -2 sin x -3 cos x. But since sin x is negative in [π, 3π/2], -sin x is positive, and similarly -cos x is positive. So f(x) is 2*(-sin x) +3*(-cos x)=2|sin x| +3|cos x|. So in terms of behavior, it&#39;s similar to the first quadrant. Therefore, in each interval, the function can reach up to sqrt(13) and down to 2. Therefore, the range is [2, sqrt(13)].Wait, but earlier I thought that at x=π/4, f(x)=5/√2≈3.535, which is less than sqrt(13)≈3.605. So that&#39;s consistent. So sqrt(13) is indeed the maximum.But let me verify this with another approach. Let&#39;s suppose we can write the function as f(x)=2|sin x| +3|cos x|. Let&#39;s consider squaring the function to find maxima and minima, but that might complicate things because of cross terms. Alternatively, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.Wait, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for vectors u and v, |u⋅v| ≤ ||u|| ||v||. If we consider the function as a dot product of (2,3) and (|sin x|, |cos x|). But the problem is that |sin x| and |cos x| are not independent variables; they satisfy |sin x|^2 + |cos x|^2 = 1. Wait, but actually, |sin x|^2 + |cos x|^2 = sin^2 x + cos^2 x =1. So the vector (|sin x|, |cos x|) is a unit vector in the first quadrant, since both components are non-negative.So applying Cauchy-Schwarz, the maximum value of f(x) = 2|sin x| +3|cos x| is equal to the dot product of vectors (2,3) and (|sin x|, |cos x|). The maximum value of this dot product, given that (|sin x|, |cos x|) is a unit vector, is the norm of (2,3), which is sqrt(2^2 +3^2)=sqrt(13). But wait, this is under the condition that (|sin x|, |cos x|) is in the same direction as (2,3). But (|sin x|, |cos x|) must lie in the first quadrant, and (2,3) is also in the first quadrant, so the maximum is achieved when (|sin x|, |cos x|) is in the direction of (2,3). That is, when |sin x| / 2 = |cos x| /3 = k for some k. Since |sin x|^2 + |cos x|^2 =1, then (2k)^2 + (3k)^2 =1 =&gt;4k^2 +9k^2=13k^2=1 =&gt;k=1/sqrt(13). Therefore, |sin x|=2/sqrt(13) and |cos x|=3/sqrt(13). Therefore, f(x)=2*(2/sqrt(13)) +3*(3/sqrt(13))= (4 +9)/sqrt(13)=13/sqrt(13)=sqrt(13). So the maximum value is indeed sqrt(13).For the minimum value, since (|sin x|, |cos x|) is a unit vector, the minimum of the dot product would be when the vectors are in opposite directions. But since both vectors (2,3) and (|sin x|, |cos x|) are in the first quadrant, the minimum dot product occurs when (|sin x|, |cos x|) is as &quot;opposite&quot; as possible to (2,3). However, since both components are non-negative, the direction opposite to (2,3) would be in the negative quadrant, which is not allowed here. Therefore, the minimum occurs at one of the axes.That is, when either |sin x|=0 or |cos x|=0. If |sin x|=0, then |cos x|=1, so f(x)=0 +3*1=3. If |cos x|=0, then |sin x|=1, so f(x)=2*1 +0=2. Therefore, the minimum value is 2.Therefore, the range of f(x) is [2, sqrt(13)].But let me just confirm with another method. Suppose we set y = |sin x| and z = |cos x|. Then we know that y^2 + z^2 =1, and y, z ≥0. We need to find the range of 2y +3z.This is a linear function in y and z, subject to the constraint y^2 + z^2 =1, y,z ≥0. The maximum and minimum can be found geometrically as the maximum and minimum of the linear function over the quarter-circle in the first quadrant.The maximum occurs at the point where the line 2y +3z = k is tangent to the quarter-circle. The minimum occurs at one of the endpoints (y=0,z=1 or y=1,z=0).As calculated before, the maximum is sqrt(13), and the minimum is 2. Therefore, the range is [2, sqrt(13)].Therefore, the answer should be from 2 to sqrt(13). So the range is [2, √13].Final AnswerThe range of the function is boxed{[2, sqrt{13}]}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the range of the function ( f(x) = 2|sin x| + 3|cos x| ), we start by noting that both ( |sin x| ) and ( |cos x| ) are non-negative and periodic with period ( pi/2 ). 1. Identifying Critical Points:   - The function ( f(x) ) can be analyzed in the interval ( [0, pi/2] ) where both ( sin x ) and ( cos x ) are non-negative. Here, ( f(x) = 2sin x + 3cos x ).   - To find the critical points, we compute the derivative: ( f&#39;(x) = 2cos x - 3sin x ). Setting the derivative to zero gives ( 2cos x - 3sin x = 0 ), leading to ( tan x = frac{2}{3} ). Solving for ( x ) gives ( x = arctanleft(frac{2}{3}right) ).2. Evaluating at Critical Points:   - At ( x = arctanleft(frac{2}{3}right) ), we form a right triangle with opposite side 2 and adjacent side 3, giving ( sin x = frac{2}{sqrt{13}} ) and ( cos x = frac{3}{sqrt{13}} ). Substituting these into ( f(x) ) gives ( f(x) = sqrt{13} ).3. Checking Endpoints:   - At ( x = 0 ), ( f(0) = 3 ).   - At ( x = pi/2 ), ( f(pi/2) = 2 ).4. Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:   - The function ( f(x) ) can be seen as the dot product of vectors ( (2, 3) ) and ( (|sin x|, |cos x|) ). The maximum value is the norm of ( (2, 3) ), which is ( sqrt{13} ).5. Minimum Value:   - The minimum value occurs when either ( |sin x| = 0 ) or ( |cos x| = 0 ). Evaluating these cases gives ( f(x) = 2 ) or ( f(x) = 3 ), with the minimum being 2.Thus, the range of the function ( f(x) = 2|sin x| + 3|cos x| ) is (boxed{[2, sqrt{13}]}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the range of the function f(x) = 2|sin x| + 3|cos x|. Hmm, let&#39;s think. The range of a function is all the possible values it can take. Since both sine and cosine functions have outputs between -1 and 1, their absolute values will be between 0 and 1. So, 2|sin x| will be between 0 and 2, and 3|cos x| will be between 0 and 3. Adding them together, the function f(x) should be between 0 and 5. But wait, that&#39;s probably not precise enough because the maximums of |sin x| and |cos x| don&#39;t occur at the same x. Let me check.First, since both sine and cosine are involved with absolute values, maybe we can consider the function in the first quadrant where both sin x and cos x are non-negative, and then generalize due to symmetry. So, if we take x in [0, π/2], then |sin x| = sin x and |cos x| = cos x. So, f(x) = 2 sin x + 3 cos x. Then we can find the maximum and minimum in this interval and since the function is periodic and symmetric, the range would just depend on that.Alternatively, maybe we can express this as a single sinusoidal function? But since there&#39;s coefficients 2 and 3, it might form a sinusoidal function with a phase shift. But because both sine and cosine have absolute values, the function is actually a combination of their absolute values. So the standard method of combining sinusoids might not directly apply here. Hmm, tricky.Wait, perhaps we can square the function to use some trigonometric identities? Let me think. If I consider f(x) = 2|sin x| + 3|cos x|. If I square both sides, f(x)^2 = 4 sin^2 x + 12 |sin x cos x| + 9 cos^2 x. But that introduces a cross term with |sin x cos x|, which might complicate things. Maybe not the best approach.Alternatively, since both |sin x| and |cos x| are periodic with period π/2, the function f(x) will also have period π/2. Therefore, we can study the function in the interval [0, π/2], where sin x and cos x are non-negative, so the absolute values can be dropped. Then f(x) = 2 sin x + 3 cos x in this interval. Then, to find the maximum and minimum of this function over [0, π/2], we can take the derivative and find critical points.Let&#39;s try that. Let&#39;s define f(x) = 2 sin x + 3 cos x on [0, π/2]. Compute f&#39;(x) = 2 cos x - 3 sin x. Set derivative equal to zero: 2 cos x - 3 sin x = 0. Then 2 cos x = 3 sin x =&gt; tan x = 2/3. So x = arctan(2/3). Let&#39;s check this critical point.Compute f(arctan(2/3)). Let me compute sin(arctan(2/3)) and cos(arctan(2/3)). If we have a right triangle where the opposite side is 2 and adjacent is 3, hypotenuse is sqrt(2^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(13). Therefore, sin(arctan(2/3)) = 2/sqrt(13), cos(arctan(2/3)) = 3/sqrt(13). Then f(x) at this point is 2*(2/sqrt(13)) + 3*(3/sqrt(13)) = (4 + 9)/sqrt(13) = 13/sqrt(13) = sqrt(13). So sqrt(13) is approximately 3.605.Now, check the endpoints of the interval [0, π/2]. At x = 0: f(0) = 2*0 + 3*1 = 3. At x = π/2: f(π/2) = 2*1 + 3*0 = 2. So in the interval [0, π/2], the maximum value is sqrt(13) and the minimum is 2. But wait, we also need to check if the critical point is a maximum or minimum. Since the derivative changes from positive to negative there? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s pick a point slightly less than arctan(2/3). Suppose x is slightly less, so tan x is slightly less than 2/3, so sin x is slightly less than 2/sqrt(13), cos x slightly more than 3/sqrt(13). Then f&#39;(x) = 2 cos x - 3 sin x. If x is less than arctan(2/3), then cos x is larger and sin x is smaller, so f&#39;(x) would be positive. If x is larger than arctan(2/3), then cos x is smaller and sin x is larger, so f&#39;(x) would be negative. Therefore, the critical point at arctan(2/3) is a maximum. Therefore, in [0, π/2], the function f(x) reaches a maximum of sqrt(13) and minimum of 2.But wait, the original function is 2|sin x| + 3|cos x|, which has a period of π/2, as both |sin x| and |cos x| have a period of π. Wait, actually, |sin x| and |cos x| both have periods of π. But when combined, does the function f(x) have period π/2? Let&#39;s verify:For f(x + π/2) = 2|sin(x + π/2)| + 3|cos(x + π/2)| = 2|cos x| + 3|sin x|. Which is different from f(x). So f(x + π/2) = 3|sin x| + 2|cos x|, which is not the same as f(x). Therefore, the function&#39;s period is actually π. Because |sin(x + π)| = |sin x| and |cos(x + π)| = |cos x|, so f(x + π) = f(x). Therefore, the period is π. So perhaps we need to analyze the function over [0, π], but considering symmetry.But since |sin x| and |cos x| in [0, π] can be split into two intervals: [0, π/2] where sin x and cos x are non-negative, and [π/2, π] where sin x is non-negative but cos x is non-positive. Therefore, in [π/2, π], |cos x| = -cos x. So f(x) = 2 sin x + 3(-cos x) = 2 sin x - 3 cos x. But this complicates things. Maybe it&#39;s easier to analyze over [0, π/2] first, then consider the other intervals?Alternatively, since the function is symmetric every π/2, but transformed. Wait, maybe not. Let me plot the function mentally. Since |sin x| and |cos x| have their maxima at different points. Hmm. Alternatively, think of t = |sin x| and s = |cos x|, then t^2 + s^2 = 1. So we can parametrize t and s as non-negative real numbers with t^2 + s^2 = 1. Then the function becomes 2t + 3s. So we can think of this as maximizing and minimizing 2t + 3s subject to t^2 + s^2 = 1 and t, s ≥ 0.Ah! That&#39;s a good approach. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum and minimum of 2t + 3s where (t, s) lies on the intersection of the unit circle in the first quadrant. Since t and s are absolute values, they are non-negative, so we only consider the first quadrant. So this is a constrained optimization problem.To find the maximum and minimum of 2t + 3s subject to t^2 + s^2 = 1 and t, s ≥ 0.The maximum can be found using the method of Lagrange multipliers or geometrically by considering the line 2t + 3s = k tangent to the circle t^2 + s^2 =1 in the first quadrant.Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: (2t + 3s)^2 ≤ (2^2 + 3^2)(t^2 + s^2) = 13*1 =13. So maximum value is sqrt(13), as we found earlier. Equality occurs when (t, s) is proportional to (2,3). Which would be t = 2/sqrt(13), s = 3/sqrt(13). Which corresponds to x = arctan(2/3), as before.For the minimum value, since we are in the first quadrant, t and s are non-negative. The expression 2t + 3s will attain its minimum when either t or s is zero. Wait, but if both are non-negative, then the minimum would occur at one of the endpoints. Let&#39;s check: when t=0, s=1, then 2t +3s=3. When s=0, t=1, then 2t +3s=2. So the minimum is 2. So the range is [2, sqrt(13)].But wait, but in our original problem, f(x) = 2|sin x| +3|cos x|. However, in the first quadrant, we saw the maximum is sqrt(13) and minimum is 2, but does this hold over the entire domain? Wait, but in other quadrants, since we have absolute values, the function is symmetric. For example, in the second quadrant, |sin x| = sin x (since sin x is non-negative there) and |cos x| = -cos x (since cos x is non-positive). So f(x) = 2 sin x + 3(-cos x) in the second quadrant. But would that affect the maximum and minimum?Wait, but since in each quadrant, the function f(x) can be expressed as a combination similar to the first quadrant but with different signs. However, due to the absolute values, all terms become positive. Wait, no. Wait, |sin x| is always non-negative, and |cos x| is also always non-negative. Therefore, regardless of the quadrant, f(x) is always 2|sin x| + 3|cos x|, which is equivalent to 2 sin x&#39; + 3 cos x&#39; where x&#39; is in the first quadrant. Because |sin x| and |cos x| can be seen as sin(x&#39;) and cos(x&#39;) where x&#39; is the reference angle in [0, π/2]. Therefore, the function f(x) can be considered as having the same range as the function 2 sin x&#39; + 3 cos x&#39; where x&#39; ∈ [0, π/2]. Therefore, the maximum is sqrt(13) and the minimum is 2.But wait, let&#39;s verify with some specific values. For example, when x = 0: f(0) = 2*0 +3*1=3. When x= π/2: f(π/2)=2*1 +3*0=2. When x= arctan(2/3): f(x)=sqrt(13). So in the first quadrant, these are the key points. But what about other quadrants? For example, x = π: f(π) =2*0 +3*1=3, same as x=0. x=3π/2: f(3π/2)=2*1 +3*0=2. So same as x=π/2. So in all cases, the maximum possible value is sqrt(13) and the minimum is 2. Therefore, the range is [2, sqrt(13)].Wait, but in the first analysis, considering the entire domain, the minimum value is 2, achieved when |sin x|=1 and |cos x|=0, i.e., at x= π/2 + kπ, and the maximum is sqrt(13), achieved when |sin x|=2/sqrt(13) and |cos x|=3/sqrt(13). So yes, the range should be [2, sqrt(13)]. So the answer is [2, √13]. Therefore, the range is from 2 to sqrt(13).But let me double-check. Suppose someone suggests that the minimum is 3 when |cos x|=1. Wait, when x=0, f(0)=3, which is higher than 2. So 3 is not the minimum. The minimum is actually 2, achieved when |sin x|=1 and |cos x|=0. So that&#39;s correct. So the range is [2, sqrt(13)].Therefore, the final answer is that the range of the function is [2, √13], which is written as boxed{[2, sqrt{13}]}.Final AnswerThe range of the function is boxed{[2, sqrt{13}]}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the range of the function ( f(x) = 2|sin x| + 3|cos x| ), we start by noting that both ( |sin x| ) and ( |cos x| ) have values between 0 and 1. However, the maximum and minimum values of the function do not occur at the endpoints of these intervals. We consider the function in the interval ([0, pi/2]) where both ( sin x ) and ( cos x ) are non-negative, so the absolute values can be dropped. Here, the function simplifies to ( f(x) = 2sin x + 3cos x ).To find the critical points, we take the derivative:[ f&#39;(x) = 2cos x - 3sin x. ]Setting the derivative equal to zero, we solve:[ 2cos x - 3sin x = 0 implies tan x = frac{2}{3}. ]The critical point is ( x = arctanleft(frac{2}{3}right) ).Evaluating ( f(x) ) at this critical point, we use the right triangle with opposite side 2 and adjacent side 3, giving hypotenuse ( sqrt{13} ). Thus,[ sinleft(arctanleft(frac{2}{3}right)right) = frac{2}{sqrt{13}}, quad cosleft(arctanleft(frac{2}{3}right)right) = frac{3}{sqrt{13}}. ]Substituting these into ( f(x) ):[ fleft(arctanleft(frac{2}{3}right)right) = 2 cdot frac{2}{sqrt{13}} + 3 cdot frac{3}{sqrt{13}} = frac{13}{sqrt{13}} = sqrt{13}. ]Checking the endpoints of ([0, pi/2]):- At ( x = 0 ), ( f(0) = 3 ).- At ( x = pi/2 ), ( f(pi/2) = 2 ).Thus, in ([0, pi/2]), the maximum value is ( sqrt{13} ) and the minimum is 2. Due to the periodicity and symmetry of the function, this analysis holds for all ( x ).Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we confirm the maximum value:[ (2|sin x| + 3|cos x|)^2 leq (2^2 + 3^2)(sin^2 x + cos^2 x) = 13, ]hence the maximum value is ( sqrt{13} ).The minimum value is found by evaluating the function at points where either ( |sin x| ) or ( |cos x| ) is zero, giving 2.Thus, the range of the function ( f(x) = 2|sin x| + 3|cos x| ) is (boxed{[2, sqrt{13}]}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-40815de7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>🔑:</span>8.

Then I need to find the number of all non-empty proper subsets of M. The options are A) 254, B) 255, C) 510, D) 511. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, let me recall what N* means. Usually, N* refers to the set of positive integers, which is the same as natural numbers starting from 1. So N* = {1, 2, 3, ...}. Therefore, the condition here is that 5 - |2x - 3| must be a positive integer. So 5 - |2x - 3| ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}. However, since 5 - |2x - 3| must be positive, that means |2x - 3| must be less than 5. Because if 5 minus something is positive, that something must be less than 5. So |2x - 3| &lt; 5. But also, since N* includes 1, 2, 3, etc., 5 - |2x - 3| must be at least 1. Therefore, |2x - 3| ≤ 4. Wait, let&#39;s see:If 5 - |2x - 3| ∈ N*, then 5 - |2x - 3| ≥ 1, so |2x - 3| ≤ 4. So that gives us |2x - 3| ≤ 4. Therefore, solving that inequality:|2x - 3| ≤ 4This breaks down to:-4 ≤ 2x - 3 ≤ 4Adding 3 to all parts:-4 + 3 ≤ 2x ≤ 4 + 3-1 ≤ 2x ≤ 7Divide by 2:-0.5 ≤ x ≤ 3.5So x is in the interval [-0.5, 3.5]. But that&#39;s just the solution to |2x - 3| ≤ 4. However, the original condition is that 5 - |2x - 3| is a positive integer. So 5 - |2x - 3| must be an element of {1,2,3,4,5,...}. But since |2x - 3| is a non-negative real number, 5 - |2x - 3| can be any real number less than or equal to 5. However, we need it to be a positive integer, so possible values of 5 - |2x - 3| are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Wait, because if |2x - 3| is an integer, then 5 - |2x - 3| would be integer. But is |2x - 3| required to be an integer here?Wait, the problem says 5 - |2x - 3| ∈ N*, which is positive integers. So 5 - |2x - 3| must equal 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Because if |2x - 3| is 0, then 5 - 0 = 5, which is allowed. But if |2x - 3| is 1, then 5 - 1 = 4; if |2x - 3| is 2, 5 - 2 = 3; |2x - 3| = 3, 5 - 3 = 2; |2x - 3| = 4, 5 - 4 = 1; and |2x - 3| = 5 would give 5 - 5 = 0, which is not in N*. So the possible values of |2x - 3| are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore, |2x - 3| can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each of these will give a corresponding x value. Let me write down each case.Case 1: |2x - 3| = 0Then 2x - 3 = 0 =&gt; x = 3/2Case 2: |2x - 3| = 1Then 2x - 3 = 1 or 2x - 3 = -1Solving 2x - 3 = 1 =&gt; 2x = 4 =&gt; x = 2Solving 2x - 3 = -1 =&gt; 2x = 2 =&gt; x = 1Case 3: |2x - 3| = 2Then 2x - 3 = 2 or 2x - 3 = -2Solving 2x - 3 = 2 =&gt; 2x = 5 =&gt; x = 5/2 = 2.5Solving 2x - 3 = -2 =&gt; 2x = 1 =&gt; x = 0.5Case 4: |2x - 3| = 3Then 2x - 3 = 3 or 2x - 3 = -3Solving 2x - 3 = 3 =&gt; 2x = 6 =&gt; x = 3Solving 2x - 3 = -3 =&gt; 2x = 0 =&gt; x = 0Case 5: |2x - 3| = 4Then 2x - 3 = 4 or 2x - 3 = -4Solving 2x - 3 = 4 =&gt; 2x = 7 =&gt; x = 3.5Solving 2x - 3 = -4 =&gt; 2x = -1 =&gt; x = -0.5So for each value of |2x - 3| from 0 to 4, we get the corresponding x values. Let&#39;s list all these x values:From Case 1: x = 3/2 (1.5)Case 2: x = 2, 1Case 3: x = 2.5, 0.5Case 4: x = 3, 0Case 5: x = 3.5, -0.5So compiling all these, the set M is:M = {-0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5}Let me check if I missed any:Case 1: 1.5Case 2: 1, 2Case 3: 0.5, 2.5Case 4: 0, 3Case 5: -0.5, 3.5Yes, that&#39;s 9 elements. Let me count them:1. -0.52. 03. 0.54. 15. 1.56. 27. 2.58. 39. 3.5Yep, 9 elements in total.So M has 9 elements. Now, the question is asking for the number of all non-empty proper subsets of M.First, recall that for a set with n elements, the number of subsets is 2^n. The number of non-empty subsets is 2^n - 1 (excluding the empty set). The number of proper subsets is 2^n - 1 (excluding the set itself). Wait, but &quot;non-empty proper subsets&quot; would be subsets that are neither empty nor the entire set. So the total number of subsets is 2^n. Then subtract 1 for the empty set and subtract 1 for the entire set, giving 2^n - 2.Therefore, the number of non-empty proper subsets is 2^9 - 2 = 512 - 2 = 510.Looking at the options, C is 510. So the answer should be C) 510.But let me double-check my steps to be sure.First, verifying the elements of M:We started with 5 - |2x - 3| ∈ N*, which requires that 5 - |2x - 3| is a positive integer, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Therefore, |2x - 3| must be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Each of these leads to two solutions (except when |2x - 3| = 0, which gives one solution). Therefore, total solutions:For |2x - 3| = 0: 1 solutionFor |2x - 3| = 1: 2 solutionsFor |2x - 3| = 2: 2 solutionsFor |2x - 3| = 3: 2 solutionsFor |2x - 3| = 4: 2 solutionsTotal: 1 + 2*4 = 1 + 8 = 9 elements. Correct.Therefore, M has 9 elements, so the number of non-empty proper subsets is 2^9 - 2 = 512 - 2 = 510, which is option C.But let me check if &quot;non-empty proper subsets&quot; is indeed 2^n - 2. A proper subset is any subset that is not equal to the set itself. So all subsets except the entire set. But non-empty proper subsets would exclude both the empty set and the entire set, so yes, 2^n - 2. So 512 - 2 = 510. So yes, option C. The answer is C) 510.But wait, just to make sure that when I calculated the elements of M, I didn&#39;t make a mistake in solving the equations. Let&#39;s verify each x value:Case 1: |2x - 3| = 0 =&gt; x = 3/2. Plugging back in, 5 - |2*(1.5) - 3| = 5 - |3 - 3| = 5 - 0 = 5, which is in N*. Correct.Case 2: x = 2. 5 - |2*2 - 3| = 5 - |4 - 3| = 5 - 1 = 4. Correct. x = 1: 5 - |2*1 - 3| = 5 - |2 - 3| = 5 - 1 = 4. Correct.Case 3: x = 2.5: 5 - |2*2.5 - 3| = 5 - |5 - 3| = 5 - 2 = 3. Correct. x = 0.5: 5 - |2*0.5 - 3| = 5 - |1 - 3| = 5 - 2 = 3. Correct.Case 4: x = 3: 5 - |2*3 - 3| = 5 - |6 - 3| = 5 - 3 = 2. Correct. x = 0: 5 - |2*0 - 3| = 5 - |0 - 3| = 5 - 3 = 2. Correct.Case 5: x = 3.5: 5 - |2*3.5 - 3| = 5 - |7 - 3| = 5 - 4 = 1. Correct. x = -0.5: 5 - |2*(-0.5) - 3| = 5 - |-1 - 3| = 5 - 4 = 1. Correct.All x values check out. So M indeed has 9 elements. Thus, the number of non-empty proper subsets is 2^9 - 2 = 510. Therefore, the answer is C) 510.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( M = {x mid 5 - |2x - 3| in mathbf{N}^*} ), we need to determine the number of all non-empty proper subsets of ( M ).1. Understanding the condition:   - ( 5 - |2x - 3| ) must be a positive integer, i.e., ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ).   - This implies ( |2x - 3| ) can be ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ).2. Solving for ( x ):   - For each value of ( |2x - 3| ), we solve the equations:     - ( |2x - 3| = 0 Rightarrow x = frac{3}{2} )     - ( |2x - 3| = 1 Rightarrow x = 2 ) or ( x = 1 )     - ( |2x - 3| = 2 Rightarrow x = frac{5}{2} ) or ( x = frac{1}{2} )     - ( |2x - 3| = 3 Rightarrow x = 3 ) or ( x = 0 )     - ( |2x - 3| = 4 Rightarrow x = frac{7}{2} ) or ( x = -frac{1}{2} )3. Elements of ( M ):   - The solutions yield the set ( M = {-0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5} ), which has 9 elements.4. Number of non-empty proper subsets:   - The number of subsets of a set with ( n ) elements is ( 2^n ).   - The number of non-empty proper subsets is ( 2^n - 2 ) (excluding the empty set and the set itself).   - For ( n = 9 ), this is ( 2^9 - 2 = 512 - 2 = 510 ).Thus, the number of all non-empty proper subsets of ( M ) is (boxed{C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. The question is about finding the number of all non-empty proper subsets of a set M, which is defined as M = {x | 5 - |2x - 3| is a positive natural number}. The options given are A) 254, B) 255, C) 510, D) 511. First, I need to understand what the set M consists of. The condition for an element x to be in M is that 5 - |2x - 3| is a positive natural number, which is N*. So N* here probably means the set of positive integers, so 1, 2, 3, ... etc. Therefore, 5 - |2x - 3| must be in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}. But since 5 - |2x - 3| is subtracted by an absolute value, let&#39;s see what possible values this expression can take.Let me consider the expression 5 - |2x - 3|. The absolute value |2x - 3| is always non-negative, so 5 - |2x - 3| will be less than or equal to 5. Also, since |2x - 3| can be as small as 0, the expression can be as large as 5. However, since we need 5 - |2x - 3| to be a positive natural number, it can take values 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Wait, but 5 - |2x - 3| must be a positive integer, so it can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let me verify that.If |2x - 3| is such that 5 - |2x - 3| is a natural number, then |2x - 3| must be 5 - k where k is in N*. So |2x - 3| = 5 - k. Since |2x - 3| is non-negative, 5 - k must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, 5 - k &gt;= 0 =&gt; k &lt;=5. Since k is a positive integer, k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, |2x - 3| can take values 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0. Thus, for each of these values of |2x - 3|, we can solve for x and find the corresponding elements in set M.So let me list the possible values of |2x - 3| and solve for x in each case.Case 1: |2x - 3| = 4This equation splits into two cases:a) 2x - 3 = 4 =&gt; 2x = 7 =&gt; x = 7/2b) 2x - 3 = -4 =&gt; 2x = -1 =&gt; x = -1/2Case 2: |2x - 3| = 3Similarly:a) 2x - 3 = 3 =&gt; 2x = 6 =&gt; x = 3b) 2x - 3 = -3 =&gt; 2x = 0 =&gt; x = 0Case 3: |2x - 3| = 2a) 2x - 3 = 2 =&gt; 2x = 5 =&gt; x = 5/2b) 2x - 3 = -2 =&gt; 2x = 1 =&gt; x = 1/2Case 4: |2x - 3| = 1a) 2x - 3 = 1 =&gt; 2x = 4 =&gt; x = 2b) 2x - 3 = -1 =&gt; 2x = 2 =&gt; x = 1Case 5: |2x - 3| = 0Only one solution here:2x - 3 = 0 =&gt; 2x = 3 =&gt; x = 3/2So, compiling all these solutions, the set M should have the elements:From Case 1: 7/2 and -1/2From Case 2: 3 and 0From Case 3: 5/2 and 1/2From Case 4: 2 and 1From Case 5: 3/2Let me list all these x values:-1/2, 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, 3, 7/2Let me count them: that&#39;s 9 elements. Let me check each case:Case 1: 2 elementsCase 2: 2 elementsCase 3: 2 elementsCase 4: 2 elementsCase 5: 1 elementTotal: 2+2+2+2+1=9. That seems right. So set M has 9 elements.Therefore, the number of all non-empty proper subsets of M is 2^9 - 2. Because the total number of subsets is 2^9, and non-empty proper subsets exclude the empty set and the set itself. So 2^9 is 512, so 512 - 2 = 510. Wait, but 510 is one of the options (Option C). But let me confirm again.Wait, but before that, let me verify that the set M indeed has 9 elements. Let&#39;s list them again:1. -1/22. 03. 1/24. 15. 3/26. 27. 5/28. 39. 7/2Yes, that&#39;s 9 distinct elements. Each case gives distinct solutions, and there&#39;s no overlap between the solutions. For example, 3/2 comes only from the case where |2x - 3| = 0, which is unique. Similarly, 7/2 and -1/2 are unique, etc. So, yes, M has 9 elements.Therefore, the number of subsets of M is 2^9 = 512. The number of non-empty proper subsets is 512 - 2 = 510. Because non-empty means excluding the empty set, and proper means excluding the set itself. Therefore, subtract 2.So the answer should be 510, which is option C. But wait, let me check the options again.Options given are (A) 254, (B) 255, (C) 510, (D) 511. So 510 is option C. Therefore, the answer is C.But wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculation. If the set has n elements, the number of non-empty proper subsets is 2^n - 2. Here n=9, so 2^9=512, 512-2=510. That&#39;s correct. Therefore, 510 is the right answer, which is option C.But just to make sure, let me verify if M is correctly constructed. Let&#39;s take each x value and check if 5 - |2x - 3| is indeed in N*.Take x = -1/2:|2*(-1/2) -3| = |-1 -3| = | -4 | = 45 - 4 = 1, which is in N*. Correct.x = 0:|2*0 -3| = | -3 | = 35 - 3 = 2, which is in N*. Correct.x = 1/2:|2*(1/2) -3| = |1 -3| = | -2 | = 25 - 2 = 3, in N*. Correct.x = 1:|2*1 -3| = |2 -3| = 15 -1 =4, in N*.

Thus, the number of non-empty proper subsets is 2^9 -2=510. So the answer is C.But wait, looking at the options, 510 is C. So this seems correct. However, the options also include 254, 255, 511. Let me check if perhaps the problem was not with the number of elements. Wait, 2^9=512. 512-2=510. So unless I made a mistake in the count of elements.Wait, maybe I miscounted the elements. Let&#39;s list them again:1. -1/22. 03. 1/24. 15. 3/26. 27. 5/28. 39. 7/2Yes, that&#39;s 9 elements. Each is distinct. Each case gives unique solutions, and since in each case the solutions are different. For example, solving |2x -3|=4 gives x=7/2 and -1/2. These are not repeated in other cases. Similarly, |2x-3|=3 gives x=3 and 0, which aren&#39;t elsewhere. So no overlaps. Therefore, 9 elements. Therefore, the answer is 510, option C.Therefore, I think the correct answer is C) 510.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( M = left{ x mid 5 - |2x - 3| in mathbf{N}^* right} ), we need to find the number of all non-empty proper subsets of ( M ).First, we determine the elements of ( M ). The expression ( 5 - |2x - 3| ) must be a positive natural number, i.e., ( 1, 2, 3, 4, ) or ( 5 ). This implies ( |2x - 3| ) can be ( 4, 3, 2, 1, ) or ( 0 ).Solving for each case:1. ( |2x - 3| = 4 ) gives ( x = frac{7}{2} ) or ( x = -frac{1}{2} ).2. ( |2x - 3| = 3 ) gives ( x = 3 ) or ( x = 0 ).3. ( |2x - 3| = 2 ) gives ( x = frac{5}{2} ) or ( x = frac{1}{2} ).4. ( |2x - 3| = 1 ) gives ( x = 2 ) or ( x = 1 ).5. ( |2x - 3| = 0 ) gives ( x = frac{3}{2} ).Listing all elements of ( M ):[ M = left{ -frac{1}{2}, 0, frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{3}{2}, 2, frac{5}{2}, 3, frac{7}{2} right} ]The set ( M ) has 9 elements. The number of non-empty proper subsets of a set with ( n ) elements is ( 2^n - 2 ). For ( n = 9 ):[ 2^9 - 2 = 512 - 2 = 510 ]Thus, the number of all non-empty proper subsets of ( M ) is (boxed{C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-40815de7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>🔑:</span>(1) mathrm{C} Hint: From 5-|2 x-3| in mathbf{N}^{*}, i.e., |2 x-3|=0,1,2,3,4, thusM=left{-frac{1}{2}, 0, frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{3}{2}, 2, frac{5}{2}, 3, frac{7}{2}right},M contains 9 elements, so the number of all non-empty proper subsets of M is 2^{9}-2= 510.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the problem.First, since ABC is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. Let me sketch this in my mind: points A, B, C form a triangle with AB = BC = CA. Now, BCKM is a parallelogram. A parallelogram has opposite sides equal and parallel. So, BC is one side of the parallelogram, which is also a side of the triangle. That means BCKM must be constructed such that BC is one side, and then we need another side adjacent to it. Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are equal and opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, BC is one side, and then CK must be equal and parallel to BM, and BK equal and parallel to CM. Hmm, but I need to figure out where points K and M are located.Wait, the notation BCKM suggests that the parallelogram has vertices B, C, K, M connected in that order. So, starting at B, then to C, then to K, then to M, and back to B. So BC is the first side, CK is the next, KM, then MB. So in that case, BC and KM would be opposite sides of the parallelogram, meaning they are equal and parallel. Similarly, CK and BM would be the other pair of opposite sides. But wait, in the problem statement, it&#39;s called a parallelogram BCKM, so maybe the order is B-C-K-M, forming the parallelogram. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the sides BC and KM are opposite sides, so BC is one side, and KM is the opposite side. So BC is equal and parallel to KM. If that&#39;s the case, then KM is equal in length to BC and parallel to it. Then, since BC is part of the equilateral triangle, which is length equal to AB, BC, CA. So if BC is parallel to KM, then AB and KM would form some angle. But AB is a side of the triangle, which is at 60 degrees to BC, because in an equilateral triangle, each angle is 60 degrees. So if BC is parallel to KM, then the angle between AB and KM would be the same as the angle between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#39;m missing something here.Wait, but maybe the parallelogram is not drawn in the way I&#39;m thinking. Let me try to clarify. Let&#39;s consider coordinate geometry. Maybe assigning coordinates to points A, B, C will make this easier.Let&#39;s place point B at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, we can place point C at (1,0). Then point A will be at (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) because the height of an equilateral triangle with side length 1 is sqrt(3)/2. So coordinates are:B: (0,0)C: (1,0)A: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2)Now, BCKM is a parallelogram. Let&#39;s figure out where K and M are. Since BC is from B(0,0) to C(1,0). In a parallelogram, the vector from B to C is the same as the vector from K to M. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the vectors BC and BK should be the adjacent sides. Wait, the notation BCKM as a parallelogram would mean that the sides are BC, CK, KM, and MB. So starting at B, moving to C, then to K, then to M, then back to B. So BC and KM are opposite sides, as well as CK and MB.But to construct this parallelogram, we need to determine the position of K and M. Since BC is from B(0,0) to C(1,0), then to form the parallelogram, we need another side from C. Let&#39;s denote that CK is another side. But the direction of CK is not specified. Hmm, so maybe we need to assume that the parallelogram is constructed such that BC is one side, and then the other side is, say, going upwards or downwards. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify the orientation, maybe there are multiple possibilities. Wait, but in that case, the answer might not be unique. But the problem asks to find the angle, so likely there is a specific answer, so the parallelogram must be constructed in a specific way.Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the parallelogram is constructed by extending sides or something. Let me think. If ABC is the equilateral triangle, and BCKM is a parallelogram. So BC is a common side between the triangle and the parallelogram. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are both equal and parallel. So BC is a side, and KM must be equal and parallel to BC, so KM is also of length BC and parallel to BC. Then, the other sides CK and BM must be equal and parallel.So, starting at point C, moving in some direction to point K, then from K moving parallel to BC (i.e., in the direction opposite to BC) to point M, then from M moving parallel to CK back to B. Wait, but how does that connect back to B?Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to think in vectors. Let&#39;s assign coordinates as before. Let me try again with coordinates.Let me fix coordinate system:Let’s set point B at (0, 0), point C at (1, 0), then point A is at (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Now, BC is the vector from B to C: (1, 0). In the parallelogram BCKM, the sides BC and CK must be vectors. The other adjacent side from C is CK. Let’s denote vector CK as some vector (a, b). Then, since BCKM is a parallelogram, the vector from K to M must be equal to the vector from B to C, which is (1, 0). Similarly, the vector from M to B must be equal to the vector from C to K, which is (a, b). So let&#39;s find coordinates for K and M.Starting from B(0,0):- Move along BC to C(1,0).- From C, move along CK to K(1 + a, 0 + b).- From K, move along KM (which is same as BC) to M(1 + a + 1, 0 + b + 0) = (2 + a, b).- From M, move back to B(0,0). The vector from M to B should be the same as vector from K to C. Wait, maybe I need to check.Alternatively, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. The midpoint of BC and KM should be the same. But since BC is from (0,0) to (1,0), its midpoint is (0.5, 0). The midpoint of KM should also be (0.5, 0). So if K is (x, y), then M must be (1 - x, -y), so that the midpoint ((x + 1 - x)/2, (y + (-y))/2) = (0.5, 0). Hmm, that&#39;s a way to find coordinates of K and M.But how to determine K and M? Since BCKM is a parallelogram, the sides CK and BM must be equal and parallel. So vector CK is K - C = (x - 1, y - 0) = (x - 1, y). Vector BM is M - B = ( (1 - x) - 0, (-y) - 0 ) = (1 - x, -y). For vectors CK and BM to be equal and opposite, since in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Wait, actually in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are vectors, but opposite sides are equal vectors. Wait, maybe I&#39;m mixing something up.Wait, in a parallelogram, vectors BC and KM are equal, and vectors CK and BM are equal. So vector BC is (1,0). Then vector KM must also be (1,0). Vector CK is (x - 1, y), and vector BM is M - B = (m_x, m_y). Since vectors CK and BM are equal, so (x - 1, y) = (m_x, m_y). Also, since KM is (1,0), then vector from K to M is (1,0), so M = K + (1,0). Therefore, if K is (k_x, k_y), then M is (k_x + 1, k_y). Also, BM is vector from B(0,0) to M(k_x + 1, k_y), so BM = (k_x + 1, k_y). But CK is vector from C(1,0) to K(k_x, k_y) = (k_x - 1, k_y - 0) = (k_x - 1, k_y). Since in a parallelogram, CK = BM, so:k_x - 1 = k_x + 1? Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, if vectors CK and BM are equal, then (k_x - 1, k_y) = (k_x + 1, k_y). Then equating components:k_x - 1 = k_x + 1 → -1 = 1? That&#39;s impossible. So something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, maybe my approach is incorrect. Let&#39;s step back.In the parallelogram BCKM, the sides are BC, CK, KM, MB. So:- Vector BC is C - B = (1,0) - (0,0) = (1,0)- Vector CK is K - C- Vector KM is M - K- Vector MB is B - MIn a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore:- BC = KM- CK = MBSo BC is (1,0), so KM must also be (1,0). Therefore, M = K + (1,0)Similarly, CK = MB. CK is K - C, and MB is B - M. So:K - C = B - MBut M = K + (1,0), so substitute:K - C = B - (K + (1,0))Let&#39;s compute:Left side: K - C = (k_x, k_y) - (1,0) = (k_x - 1, k_y)Right side: B - M = (0,0) - (k_x + 1, k_y) = (-k_x - 1, -k_y)So equation:(k_x - 1, k_y) = (-k_x - 1, -k_y)Therefore, equating components:k_x - 1 = -k_x - 1 → 2k_x = 0 → k_x = 0k_y = -k_y → 2k_y = 0 → k_y = 0So K is (0,0). But K can&#39;t be (0,0) because that&#39;s point B. So this is a problem. Wait, that suggests that the only solution is K = B and M = K + (1,0) = (1,0), which is point C. But then BCKM would collapse into BC, which is not a parallelogram. So this seems like a contradiction. Which suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong.Alternatively, perhaps the labeling of the parallelogram is different. Maybe it&#39;s B-C-K-M in order, but the connections are BC, CK, KM, MB. Wait, but if K is (0,0), which is B, then that&#39;s overlapping.Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the parallelogram is labeled. In some notations, the order of the letters indicates the path, so BCKM would mean B to C to K to M to B. So if BC is from B to C, then CK is from C to K, then KM is from K to M, then MB is from M back to B. For this to be a parallelogram, the vectors BC and KM must be equal and parallel, and vectors CK and MB must be equal and parallel.So, vector BC is (1,0). Therefore, vector KM must also be (1,0). So starting from K, moving (1,0) gets to M. Vector CK is from C(1,0) to K. Vector MB is from M to B(0,0). Since CK and MB must be equal and parallel, vector CK = vector MB.Let me denote K as (k_x, k_y). Then M is K + (1,0) = (k_x + 1, k_y).Vector CK is K - C = (k_x - 1, k_y - 0) = (k_x -1, k_y)Vector MB is B - M = (0 - (k_x +1), 0 - k_y) = (-k_x -1, -k_y)Since vectors CK and MB are equal:(k_x -1, k_y) = (-k_x -1, -k_y)Therefore,k_x -1 = -k_x -1 → 2k_x = 0 → k_x = 0k_y = -k_y → 2k_y = 0 → k_y = 0Thus, K is (0,0), which is point B, and M is (1,0), which is point C. So the parallelogram BCKM collapses into the line segment BC, which is degenerate. That can&#39;t be right. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning or in the problem&#39;s setup.Wait, perhaps the order of the parallelogram is different. Maybe it&#39;s B-K-C-M? But the problem says BCKM. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a different configuration.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D space? But the problem mentions lines and angles, so likely 2D.Wait, perhaps I misapplied the properties of the parallelogram. Let&#39;s recall that in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the opposite angles are equal. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. So another way to approach this is to find points K and M such that BCKM is a parallelogram, given ABC is equilateral.Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is constructed by translating the side BC. For example, if we translate BC to some position to form KM. But how?Alternatively, maybe K is a reflection of B over some line, but not sure.Alternatively, since ABC is equilateral, and BC is part of the parallelogram, perhaps K is a point such that CK is equal to BC, but that might not form a parallelogram.Wait, perhaps BCKM is constructed by extending sides of the triangle. For example, in an equilateral triangle, if you extend side BC beyond C to point K, and then construct the parallelogram. But without more information, it&#39;s hard to tell.Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, the parallelogram is constructed such that point M is on AB or something. Wait, but the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify.Wait, maybe the key is that since ABC is equilateral, and BCKM is a parallelogram, the position of K and M can be determined based on the triangle. Let me think differently.Suppose we consider vectors. Let’s denote vectors with their coordinates.Given points:B: (0, 0)C: (1, 0)A: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2)We need to find points K and M such that BCKM is a parallelogram. So, in terms of vectors, BC is the vector from B to C: (1, 0). In a parallelogram BCKM, the vector CK must be equal to the vector BM. Also, vector KM equals vector BC.So, if we let vector BM = vector CK, then:Vector BM is M - B = (m_x, m_y)Vector CK is K - C = (k_x - 1, k_y)So, (m_x, m_y) = (k_x -1, k_y)Also, vector KM = vector BC = (1, 0), so M - K = (1, 0), hence M = K + (1, 0)Therefore, M = (k_x + 1, k_y)But we also have from the previous equation:m_x = k_x -1m_y = k_yBut since M is (k_x +1, k_y), then:m_x = k_x +1 = k_x -1 → k_x +1 = k_x -1 → 1 = -1, which is impossible.This contradiction again. So that suggests that my approach is wrong.Wait, maybe the vectors aren&#39;t BM and CK, but instead CK and MB. Let me check again.In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So BC and KM are opposite sides, so BC = KM. Then CK and MB are opposite sides, so CK = MB.Therefore, vector BC = (1,0), so vector KM = (1,0). Vector CK = vector MB.Vector CK is K - C = (k_x -1, k_y)Vector MB is B - M = ( -m_x, -m_y )So setting them equal:(k_x -1, k_y) = (-m_x, -m_y)But since M = K + (1,0), as vector KM = (1,0), then M = (k_x +1, k_y). Therefore:m_x = k_x +1m_y = k_ySubstituting into the previous equation:(k_x -1, k_y) = ( - (k_x +1), -k_y )So component-wise:k_x -1 = -k_x -1 → 2k_x = 0 → k_x = 0k_y = -k_y → 2k_y = 0 → k_y = 0Thus, K is (0,0), which is point B, and M is (1,0), which is point C. Again, this results in a degenerate parallelogram. So this suggests that with the given information, the only possible parallelogram BCKM is degenerate. But that can&#39;t be right because the problem states it&#39;s a parallelogram, so it must be non-degenerate.Therefore, my coordinate system assumption might be causing this problem. Maybe I placed the points in a way that forces the parallelogram to be degenerate. Let me try a different approach.Instead of placing B at (0,0), let me consider another coordinate system. Let&#39;s place point A at the origin for a different perspective.Wait, but maybe the problem is that in my coordinate system, BC is horizontal, and the way I derived leads to a degenerate parallelogram, but in reality, the parallelogram could be constructed in another orientation. But how?Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is not lying on the same plane as the triangle? No, the problem is in plane geometry.Wait, perhaps the parallelogram is constructed by moving BC in a different direction. For instance, in the equilateral triangle ABC, if we take BC and then construct the parallelogram by moving BC upward or downward. Wait, but then points K and M would be somewhere else.Alternatively, maybe point K is the same as point A? But then BCKM would be B-C-A-M. Not sure.Wait, another way: Since ABC is equilateral, and BCKM is a parallelogram, maybe K is a point such that BM is parallel and equal to CK, where M is some point. But I need more information.Alternatively, perhaps using complex numbers could help. Let me assign complex numbers to points.Let me denote:Let’s place point B at 0 (complex plane), point C at 1, and point A at e^(iπ/3) = 0.5 + i*(sqrt(3)/2).Then, BC is the vector from B to C: 1 - 0 = 1.In the parallelogram BCKM, the other sides need to be determined. Let’s denote K as a complex number k, and M as m.In a parallelogram, the sum of the vectors BC and CK should give the diagonal. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the position vectors satisfy:The vector from B to C is c - b = 1 - 0 = 1.The vector from C to K is k - c = k - 1.The vector from K to M is m - k.The vector from M to B is b - m = -m.In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and adjacent sides are head-to-tail.So, the vector BC (1) should be equal to vector KM (m - k).The vector CK (k - 1) should be equal to vector MB (-m).So:1) m - k = 1 (since BC = KM)2) k - 1 = -m (since CK = MB)From equation 2: m = 1 - kSubstitute into equation 1: (1 - k) - k = 1 → 1 - 2k = 1 → -2k = 0 → k = 0Then m = 1 - 0 = 1So K is 0 (point B) and M is 1 (point C). Again, degenerate. So regardless of the coordinate system, this seems to lead to a degenerate parallelogram. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or my interpretation.Wait, perhaps the parallelogram is labeled differently. Maybe it&#39;s B-K-M-C? But the problem says BCKM. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a different order.Wait, maybe in the problem statement, the parallelogram is BCKM, which is different from B-C-K-M. For example, in some notations, BCKM could mean that sides are BC, CK, KM, MB. But as we saw, this leads to a degenerate parallelogram.Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is B-C-M-K, which would change the vectors. Let&#39;s try that.If the parallelogram is B-C-M-K, then the sides are BC, CM, MK, KB.Then, vectors:BC = C - B = (1,0)CM = M - CMK = K - MKB = B - KIn a parallelogram, BC and MK are equal and parallel, CM and KB are equal and parallel.So, BC = MK → MK = (1,0). Therefore, K = M + (1,0)Also, CM = KB.CM is M - C = (m_x -1, m_y)KB is B - K = ( -k_x, -k_y )But since K = M + (1,0), then K = (m_x +1, m_y)Thus, KB = ( - (m_x +1), -m_y )Setting CM = KB:(m_x -1, m_y) = ( -m_x -1, -m_y )So,m_x -1 = -m_x -1 → 2m_x = 0 → m_x = 0m_y = -m_y → 2m_y = 0 → m_y = 0Thus, M is (0,0), which is point B, and K is (1,0), point C. Again, degenerate.This is perplexing. It seems like no matter how I arrange the parallelogram BCKM in this coordinate system, it becomes degenerate. That must mean that either the problem has a typo, or I&#39;m missing some crucial information.Wait, perhaps the parallelogram is not BCKM, but B-C-K-M with K and M located such that the sides BC and BK are adjacent. Wait, that&#39;s possible. Let me consider that.If BCKM is a parallelogram with sides BC and BK. So, starting at B, going to C, then from C to K, then from K to M, then back to B. Wait, but then BK would be another side.But then, in this case, vectors BC and BK would be adjacent sides. Then, vectors BC and KM are opposite, vectors BK and CM are opposite.So, in this case:Vector BC = (1,0)Vector BK = K - B = (k_x, k_y)Vector KM = Vector BC = (1,0)Vector CM = Vector BK = (k_x, k_y)Thus, point M is K + (1,0)Vector CM = M - C = (k_x +1 -1, k_y -0) = (k_x, k_y) which is equal to BK = (k_x, k_y). So this holds.So in this case, point M is (k_x +1, k_y), and point K is arbitrary? But how do we determine its position?But in this case, since ABC is an equilateral triangle, perhaps K is a point related to the triangle. The problem statement doesn&#39;t specify, so maybe there&#39;s a standard way to place the parallelogram.Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, the parallelogram is constructed such that point M is the same as point A. Let me check.If M is point A (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), then K would be M - (1,0) = (0.5 -1, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Then vector BK would be K - B = (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Then vector CM would be M - C = (0.5 -1, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2), which is equal to BK. So in this case, BCKM would be a parallelogram with points:B(0,0), C(1,0), K(-0.5, sqrt(3)/2), M(0.5, sqrt(3)/2)But is this a valid construction? Let&#39;s check if BCKM is a parallelogram.Vectors:BC: (1,0)CK: K - C = (-0.5 -1, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (-1.5, sqrt(3)/2)KM: M - K = (0.5 - (-0.5), sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2) = (1,0)MB: B - M = (0 - 0.5, 0 - sqrt(3)/2) = (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2)Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides should be BC and CK, then KM and MB. But vectors BC is (1,0), CK is (-1.5, sqrt(3)/2). Then vector KM is (1,0), MB is (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). For it to be a parallelogram, BC should be equal and parallel to KM, which they are (both (1,0)). And CK should be equal and parallel to MB.Check if CK = MB:CK is (-1.5, sqrt(3)/2)MB is (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2)These are not equal. So this is not a parallelogram. So this approach doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe K is a reflection of point A over point C? Let&#39;s see.Reflecting A(0.5, sqrt(3)/2) over C(1,0):The reflection of a point (x, y) over (a, b) is (2a - x, 2b - y). So:K would be (2*1 - 0.5, 2*0 - sqrt(3)/2) = (1.5, -sqrt(3)/2)Then M would be K + (1,0) = (2.5, -sqrt(3)/2)Vector CM = M - C = (2.5 -1, -sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (1.5, -sqrt(3)/2)Vector BK = K - B = (1.5, -sqrt(3)/2)So yes, vectors CM and BK are equal. Then BCKM is a parallelogram with sides BC(1,0), CK(0.5, -sqrt(3)/2), KM(1,0), and MB. Wait, no, vector CK is K - C = (1.5 -1, -sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). Vector MB is B - M = (0 -2.5, 0 - (-sqrt(3)/2)) = (-2.5, sqrt(3)/2). Wait, but in this case, vectors CK and MB are not equal. So that&#39;s not a parallelogram.Wait, but earlier I thought CM = BK, but in this case:CM = M - C = (2.5 -1, -sqrt(3)/2) = (1.5, -sqrt(3)/2)BK = K - B = (1.5, -sqrt(3)/2)So vectors CM and BK are equal, but in the parallelogram, the opposite sides are BC and KM, which are equal, and CK and MB. So CK is (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2), and MB is (-2.5, sqrt(3)/2). Which are not equal. Therefore, this is not a parallelogram.Hmm, this is really confusing. Maybe there is a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I need to approach this differently.Wait, perhaps the problem is from a Russian textbook or another source where the notation might imply something else. In some notations, BCKM could imply that B is connected to C, C to K, K to M, and M to B, forming a quadrilateral, but not necessarily in that order.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a rhombus or something else, but the problem states it&#39;s a parallelogram.Alternatively, maybe the angle between AB and KM is 60 degrees, but the answer is 60 degrees. But given that in my first assumption, if KM is parallel to BC, then angle between AB and KM is 60 degrees. But when I tried to find coordinates, it leads to a degenerate parallelogram. So maybe the answer is 60 degrees, but I need to confirm.Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is constructed such that point K is the same as point A. Let me check.If K is point A(0.5, sqrt(3)/2), then since BCKM is a parallelogram, vector BC = vector KM. Vector BC is (1,0), so vector KM must be (1,0). Therefore, M = K + (1,0) = (0.5 +1, sqrt(3)/2 +0) = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2). Then check if CK is equal to BM.Vector CK = K - C = (0.5 -1, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2)Vector BM = M - B = (1.5 -0, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2)These are not equal, so not a parallelogram. So this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe point M is the same as point A. Then K = M - (1,0) = (0.5 -1, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Then vector CK = K - C = (-0.5 -1, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (-1.5, sqrt(3)/2), and vector BM = M - B = (0.5 -0, sqrt(3)/2 -0) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Not equal. Not a parallelogram.I&#39;m really stuck here. Maybe I need to think geometrically. Since ABC is equilateral, and BCKM is a parallelogram. If I can draw this, maybe the angle between AB and KM is 60 degrees or 30 degrees.Wait, another approach: In an equilateral triangle, the medians, angle bisectors, heights, and perpendicular bisectors coincide. So the line AB has a slope, and if KM is parallel to BC, then the angle between AB and BC is 60 degrees. If KM is not parallel to BC, then the angle would be different. But how to confirm?Wait, but if BCKM is a parallelogram, then BC is parallel to KM. So KM is parallel to BC. Therefore, the angle between AB and KM is the same as the angle between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees. Because in the equilateral triangle, angle at B is 60 degrees between AB and BC.So maybe the answer is 60 degrees. But then why does the coordinate approach lead to a degenerate parallelogram?Ah, wait, maybe even if the parallelogram is degenerate, the angle is still defined as between the lines AB and KM. If KM is parallel to BC, then the angle between AB and KM is 60 degrees. But if KM is not parallel to BC, then the angle could be different. However, since BCKM is a parallelogram, BC is parallel to KM, hence the angle is 60 degrees.But if the parallelogram is degenerate, then KM is the same line as BC, so the angle between AB and BC is 60 degrees. Hence, regardless of the parallelogram being degenerate or not, the angle is 60 degrees.Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes a non-degenerate parallelogram, but according to the coordinate analysis, that&#39;s not possible unless the parallelogram is in a different plane or something. But since the problem is in plane geometry, that&#39;s not the case.Wait, another thought: perhaps the parallelogram is constructed on the other side of BC. For example, extending BC beyond B to point K, and beyond C to point M, such that BK = CM and BC is the base. But then BK and CM need to be equal and the sides KM and BC need to be equal. Wait, but no, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So BC and KM must be equal and parallel. So if BC is length 1, then KM is also length 1, and BK and CM are equal.But in that case, if you have BC as the base, then K and M would be located such that BK and CM are equal in length and direction. For example, if we take K such that BK is upwards from B, and M such that CM is upwards from C, maintaining BK = CM, then KM would be parallel to BC.But then in that case, the angle between AB and KM would still be the same as angle between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees.Alternatively, if BK and CM are in a different direction, say, downwards, then KM is parallel to BC but displaced downward, but the angle between AB and KM would still be 60 degrees.Therefore, regardless of the position of the parallelogram, as long as BC is a side and KM is parallel to BC, the angle between AB and KM is the same as between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees.Therefore, the answer is 60 degrees. But this seems to contradict the coordinate system approach where the parallelogram is degenerate, but maybe in reality, the problem assumes a non-degenerate parallelogram, and the angle remains the same.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have KM not parallel to BC, but my reasoning is flawed.Wait, let me think again: if BCKM is a parallelogram, then BC is parallel to KM, so yes, the angle between AB and KM is the same as between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees.Therefore, the answer is 60 degrees. Therefore, the angle is 60 degrees, and the answer is boxed{60^circ}.But to confirm, even if the parallelogram is degenerate, the lines AB and KM (which is BC) would form a 60-degree angle. If it&#39;s non-degenerate, KM is parallel to BC but shifted, so the angle remains the same. Hence, regardless, the angle is 60 degrees.So I think the answer is 60 degrees.Final Answerboxed{60^circ}&lt;/think&gt;Given an equilateral triangle (ABC) and a parallelogram (BCKM), we need to find the angle between the lines (AB) and (KM).1. Equilateral Triangle Properties: Since (ABC) is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal and all internal angles are (60^circ). Therefore, the angle between (AB) and (BC) is (60^circ).2. Parallelogram Properties: In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. For the parallelogram (BCKM), the sides (BC) and (KM) are opposite sides. Hence, (BC) is parallel to (KM).3. Angle Between Lines: Since (BC) is parallel to (KM), the angle between (AB) and (KM) is the same as the angle between (AB) and (BC). This angle is (60^circ) because (ABC) is an equilateral triangle.Thus, the angle between the lines (AB) and (KM) is (boxed{60^circ}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There&#39;s an equilateral triangle ABC, which means all sides are equal and all angles are 60 degrees. Then there&#39;s a parallelogram BCKM. Hmm, parallelograms have opposite sides equal and parallel. So BCKM is a parallelogram with BC as one of its sides. That makes sense because BC is a side of the triangle, right?Wait, the problem says &quot;B C K M&quot; is a parallelogram. So the vertices are B, C, K, M connected in that order. So BC is one side, then CK, then KM, then MB? Or is it BC, then C to K, then K to M, then M to B? Wait, no. Parallelogram sides need to be parallel. So BC is connected to CK, which must be parallel to MB, and then KM is connected to MB. Let me draw this out mentally.In an equilateral triangle ABC, all sides are length, let&#39;s say, s. Then BC is a side of the triangle. The parallelogram BCKM would have BC and CK as adjacent sides. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So BC and KM should be opposite sides, meaning BC is equal and parallel to KM. Similarly, BK and CM should be the other pair of opposite sides. Wait, no, maybe I&#39;m mixing up the letters.Let me think again. The parallelogram is BCKM, so the order of the vertices is B, C, K, M. So BC is the first side, then CK is the next, then KM, then MB. So BC is connected to C, which connects to K, then K connects to M, then M connects back to B. So BC and KM are opposite sides, and CK and MB are the other pair. Therefore, BC is parallel and equal to KM, and CK is parallel and equal to MB.But since BC is a side of the equilateral triangle ABC, then BC is of length s. Therefore, KM must also be length s and parallel to BC. So KM is parallel to BC. But BC is part of the triangle. The problem asks for the angle between the lines AB and KM.Since KM is parallel to BC, the angle between AB and KM should be the same as the angle between AB and BC. Wait, but AB and BC meet at point B in the triangle. What&#39;s that angle? In an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees. So AB meets BC at a 60-degree angle. But if KM is parallel to BC, then the angle between AB and KM should also be 60 degrees? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but maybe I&#39;m missing something.Wait, no. Wait, the angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them. So if KM is parallel to BC, then the angle between AB and KM is equal to the angle between AB and BC. But in the triangle ABC, AB and BC meet at 60 degrees. However, since KM is parallel to BC, the direction of KM is the same as BC. So when we consider the angle between AB and KM, it&#39;s the same as the angle between AB and BC. Therefore, 60 degrees. But I need to confirm.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different configuration. Let me try to sketch it out step by step. Let&#39;s place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make it clearer. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let&#39;s set point B at the origin (0,0). Since ABC is equilateral, let&#39;s place point C at (1,0). Then point A will be at (0.5, (√3)/2), because in an equilateral triangle with side length 1, the height is (√3)/2.Now, the parallelogram BCKM. So starting from point B (0,0), then C is (1,0). Then we need to find points K and M such that BCKM is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the vector from B to C should be the same as the vector from K to M, and the vector from C to K should be the same as the vector from M to B.Wait, vectors might help here. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the position vectors of the points satisfy certain conditions. Let&#39;s denote vectors for each point. Let me denote point B as (0,0), C as (1,0). Let me let point K be (x,y), then point M would be such that the sides BC and CK are adjacent sides. Wait, in the parallelogram BCKM, moving from B to C to K to M to B. So BC is the first side, then CK is the next side, then KM, then MB. So vectors:From B to C is vector (1,0). Then from C to K is vector (x-1, y-0) = (x-1, y). Then from K to M should be the same as from B to C, so vector (1,0). So from K to M is (1,0), so M would be (x+1, y). Then from M to B should be the same as from C to K. Wait, this might get confusing. Maybe another approach.In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So BC is equal and parallel to KM, and CK is equal and parallel to MB. Since BC is from B(0,0) to C(1,0), the vector BC is (1,0). Therefore, KM must also be vector (1,0), so from K to M is (1,0). Similarly, CK is equal and parallel to MB. So vector CK is from C(1,0) to K(x,y) which is (x-1, y), and vector MB is from M(?,?) to B(0,0). Wait, since M is connected to K and B, so M is connected from K via KM, which is (1,0), so M is (x+1, y). Then vector MB is from M(x+1, y) to B(0,0), which is (-x-1, -y). This should be equal to vector CK which is (x -1, y). So:(-x -1, -y) = (x -1, y)Therefore, equating components:-x -1 = x -1and-y = yFrom the second equation, -y = y ⇒ 2y = 0 ⇒ y = 0.From the first equation: -x -1 = x -1 ⇒ -x -1 = x -1 ⇒ -x = x ⇒ -2x = 0 ⇒ x = 0.Wait, so point K would be (0,0). But point B is already (0,0). That would make point K coincide with B, which can&#39;t be right because then the parallelogram would collapse. Hmm, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Maybe my approach is wrong.Wait, perhaps I messed up the order of the parallelogram. Let me check again. The parallelogram is BCKM. So the sides are BC, CK, KM, MB. So starting at B, then to C, then to K, then to M, then back to B. So in this case, BC and KM are opposite sides, as well as CK and MB.Therefore, BC is from B to C, which is vector (1,0). Then KM should be from K to M, which is same as BC, so vector (1,0). Similarly, CK is from C to K, and MB is from M to B. So vector CK should equal vector MB.So let&#39;s denote point K as (a, b). Then vector CK is (a -1, b -0) = (a -1, b). Then vector MB is from M to B. But M is the fourth vertex. Since KM is vector (1,0), then point M is K + vector KM. Since KM is same as BC, which is (1,0), so M is (a +1, b). Therefore, vector MB is from M(a +1, b) to B(0,0) which is (-a -1, -b). This must equal vector CK which is (a -1, b). So:(-a -1, -b) = (a -1, b)Therefore, equating components:- a -1 = a -1and- b = bFrom the second equation: -b = b ⇒ 2b = 0 ⇒ b = 0.From the first equation: -a -1 = a -1 ⇒ -a -1 = a -1 ⇒ -a = a ⇒ -2a = 0 ⇒ a = 0.Thus, point K is (0,0), which is point B. So that&#39;s a problem because the parallelogram would have overlapping points. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the configuration is wrong.Wait, maybe the order of the parallelogram is different? Maybe it&#39;s B, K, C, M? Wait, the problem says &quot;B C K M&quot; so the order is B, C, K, M. So in order, the sides are BC, CK, KM, MB. So perhaps the problem is that the parallelogram is not possible unless points are overlapping? That can&#39;t be. There must be a mistake here.Wait, perhaps BCKM is a parallelogram with BC and BK as adjacent sides? Wait, the problem states &quot;B C K M&quot; as the parallelogram. So the sequence is B connected to C, C connected to K, K connected to M, M connected to B. Therefore, BC and CK are adjacent sides. Therefore, in a parallelogram, BC and CK must be two adjacent sides, so BC is from B to C, and CK is from C to K. Then, the opposite sides would be BC and KM, and CK and MB. But then, as above, this seems to collapse.Wait, maybe I need to use a different coordinate system. Let me try again, perhaps assigning coordinates differently. Let&#39;s take ABC as an equilateral triangle. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0), and point C at (0.5, (√3)/2). That way, ABC is equilateral with side length 1.Then, the parallelogram BCKM. So starting at point B(1,0), then to point C(0.5, (√3)/2), then to point K, then to point M, then back to B. So in this case, sides BC, CK, KM, MB.Since it&#39;s a parallelogram, BC and KM are opposite sides, so they should be equal and parallel. Similarly, CK and MB are opposite sides. Let&#39;s compute vectors.Vector BC is C - B = (0.5 -1, (√3)/2 -0) = (-0.5, (√3)/2). Therefore, vector KM should be equal to vector BC, so KM = (-0.5, (√3)/2). Vector CK is K - C, and vector MB is B - M. Since CK and MB are equal and opposite? Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector CK should equal vector MB. So CK = K - C, and MB = B - M. Therefore, K - C = B - M ⇒ M = B - (K - C) = B - K + C.But also, vector KM = M - K = (-0.5, (√3)/2). So M = K + (-0.5, (√3)/2). But from the previous equation, M = B - K + C. Therefore,K + (-0.5, (√3)/2) = B - K + CLet me substitute the coordinates:B is (1,0), C is (0.5, (√3)/2). So:K + (-0.5, (√3)/2) = (1,0) - K + (0.5, (√3)/2)Simplify the right-hand side: (1 + 0.5, 0 + (√3)/2) - K = (1.5, (√3)/2) - KTherefore, equation becomes:K + (-0.5, (√3)/2) = (1.5, (√3)/2) - KBring all K terms to the left and constants to the right:K + K = (1.5, (√3)/2) - (-0.5, (√3)/2)Left-hand side: 2KRight-hand side: (1.5 + 0.5, (√3)/2 - (√3)/2) = (2, 0)Therefore, 2K = (2, 0) ⇒ K = (1, 0)But point K is (1,0), which is point B. So again, this leads to point K coinciding with point B, which is not possible. So this suggests that there&#39;s a problem with the configuration.Wait, this can&#39;t be right. The problem states that BCKM is a parallelogram, so it must exist without overlapping points. Maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate system.Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is not constructed by extending from BC but in a different direction. Let me think differently. Let&#39;s consider that in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. If we have a parallelogram BCKM, then BC is a side, and we need to determine the positions of K and M such that BCKM is a parallelogram.In a parallelogram, adjacent sides are vectors. So if BC is one side, then the other side CK can be in any direction, but such that CK is equal and parallel to MB, and BC equal and parallel to KM.Wait, but in the triangle ABC, BC is a side. So maybe the parallelogram is constructed by translating BC to another position?Wait, perhaps it&#39;s better to use vectors. Let me denote vectors with boldface letters. Let’s set point B as the origin. Then vector BC is from B to C, which is vector c. Then, in the parallelogram BCKM, vector BC is one side, and vector BK is another side. Wait, no. Wait, if the parallelogram is BCKM, starting at B, then going to C, then to K, then to M, back to B. So vectors BC and CK are the adjacent sides. Then vector BC is c, vector CK is k - c (if K is at position k), then vector KM is m - k, and vector MB is b - m. But since it&#39;s a parallelogram, BC is equal and parallel to KM, so KM = BC = c. Also, CK is equal and parallel to MB. So CK = MB.But if B is the origin, then vector BC = C - B = C (since B is origin). Then vector KM should be equal to BC = C. Therefore, KM = C. Also, vector CK = MB. Vector CK is K - C, vector MB is B - M. But B is origin, so MB = -M. Therefore, K - C = -M ⇒ M = C - K.Also, since KM = C, vector KM = M - K = (C - K) - K = C - 2K. But KM should be equal to BC which is C. Therefore:C - 2K = C ⇒ -2K = 0 ⇒ K = 0. But then K is at the origin, which is point B. Again, overlapping points. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is that my initial assumption of setting B as the origin is causing issues?Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is not in the plane of the triangle? No, that&#39;s probably not the case. The problem is in plane geometry.Wait, perhaps the key is that in the problem statement, BCKM is a parallelogram, but it doesn&#39;t specify whether it&#39;s inside or outside the triangle. So maybe point K is outside the triangle, which would prevent overlapping.Wait, let&#39;s try again with coordinates. Let me place the triangle ABC with point A at the top. Let me assign coordinates differently. Let me set point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0), and point A at (0.5, (√3)/2). So ABC is equilateral with side length 1.Now, the parallelogram BCKM. Let me denote points:- B is (0,0)- C is (1,0)- K is (x, y)- M is (p, q)Since BCKM is a parallelogram, the vectors BC and CK must be equal to vectors KM and MB respectively. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So BC and KM are opposite, so BC = KM, and CK and MB are opposite, so CK = MB.Vector BC is C - B = (1,0) - (0,0) = (1,0). Therefore, vector KM must also be (1,0). So vector KM = M - K = (1,0). Therefore, M = K + (1,0).Vector CK is K - C = (x -1, y -0) = (x -1, y). Vector MB is B - M = (0 - p, 0 - q) = (-p, -q). Since CK = MB, then:x -1 = -py = -qBut since M = K + (1,0), which means M = (x +1, y). Therefore, p = x +1 and q = y.Substituting into the previous equations:x -1 = -p = -(x +1) ⇒ x -1 = -x -1 ⇒ x -1 + x +1 = 0 ⇒ 2x = 0 ⇒ x = 0From y = -q, and since q = y (because M = (x +1, y)), then y = -y ⇒ 2y = 0 ⇒ y = 0Therefore, point K is (0,0), which is point B, and point M is (1,0), which is point C. So BCKM would be the points B, C, B, C, which is not a valid parallelogram. So again, we have overlapping points. This is a problem.Wait a second, this suggests that under this configuration, the parallelogram BCKM collapses into the line BC, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation of the problem.Wait, perhaps the problem is not in the plane of the triangle? No, that seems unlikely. Maybe the parallelogram is constructed differently. Wait, maybe BCKM is a three-dimensional figure? The problem doesn&#39;t specify, but since it&#39;s talking about lines AB and KM, which could be skew lines, but the angle between skew lines is determined by their direction vectors. However, the problem probably assumes everything is in the same plane.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a typo in the problem, and the parallelogram is BKCM instead of BCKM? Let me check. No, the problem states BCKM.Wait, maybe the order of the letters is different. Maybe B-C-K-M-B is the parallelogram, but in such a way that BC is one side, and BK is another side? So, if the parallelogram is BCKM, then sides BC and BK. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are BC and CK. So unless the letters are ordered differently.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a different orientation. Let me try to think without coordinates. In an equilateral triangle ABC, with BC as a base. If we construct a parallelogram BCKM, then starting at B, moving to C, then from C, moving in some direction to K, then from K moving parallel to BC to M, then back to B. So for BCKM to be a parallelogram, the side CK must be equal and parallel to BM. So vector CK = vector BM.In the triangle, point M would be somewhere such that BM is equal and parallel to CK. Hmm. Maybe if we extend sides beyond C?Wait, let&#39;s suppose that from point C, we draw a line CK equal in length and parallel to BM. But since ABC is equilateral, BM is a side from B to M. Wait, this is getting too vague.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider constructing the parallelogram such that BC is the base, and the other side is upward or downward from the triangle. Let me try drawing it mentally. If BC is the base of the triangle, then K could be above or below the triangle. Suppose K is above the triangle. Then, since BCKM is a parallelogram, KM must be parallel and equal to BC. Then M would be located such that from K, moving the same vector as BC brings us to M.But in that case, the angle between AB and KM would depend on where K is located. Hmm.Wait, but in an equilateral triangle, all sides are the same. Maybe the parallelogram BCKM is actually a rhombus? Or maybe it&#39;s a different shape.Alternatively, maybe BCKM is constructed by translating the side BC. For example, if you take side BC and translate it to some position to form KM. But since KM is part of the parallelogram BCKM, the translation must be such that the entire figure is a parallelogram.Wait, this is getting too abstract. Let&#39;s try assigning coordinates again, but perhaps with a different approach.Let’s fix the triangle ABC with coordinates:- Let’s place point B at (0,0).- Since it&#39;s equilateral, point C can be at (1,0).- Point A will then be at (0.5, √3/2).Now, the parallelogram BCKM.We need to find points K and M such that BCKM is a parallelogram.In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel.So BC and KM are opposite sides. Therefore, BC is from (0,0) to (1,0), so vector BC is (1,0). Therefore, KM must also be vector (1,0). So if we can find points K and M such that the vector from K to M is (1,0), i.e., M = K + (1,0).Also, sides CK and BM must be equal and parallel. So vector CK = vector BM.Vector CK is K - C. Since C is (1,0), vector CK is (Kx -1, Ky -0) = (Kx -1, Ky).Vector BM is M - B. Since M is K + (1,0), vector BM is (Kx +1 -0, Ky +0 -0) = (Kx +1, Ky).Therefore, vector CK must equal vector BM:(Kx -1, Ky) = (Kx +1, Ky)This gives:Kx -1 = Kx +1 ⇒ -1 = 1, which is impossible.So again, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation.Wait a second, perhaps in the parallelogram BCKM, the sides are BC, CK, KM, and MB. Therefore, vectors BC and CK are adjacent sides. Therefore, vector BC is (1,0), vector CK is (Kx -1, Ky). Then the other sides are KM and MB. Vector KM should be equal to BC, which is (1,0). Vector MB should be equal to CK, which is (Kx -1, Ky). But vector MB is also M - B = (Mx, My). Since KM is (1,0), M = K + (1,0). Therefore, vector MB is (Kx +1, Ky). Therefore, setting vector MB equal to vector CK:(Kx +1, Ky) = (Kx -1, Ky)Which again implies Kx +1 = Kx -1 ⇒ 1 = -1, which is impossible. So again, contradiction.This is very confusing. It seems like no matter how I set it up, the parallelogram BCKM collapses or leads to a contradiction. Therefore, maybe there&#39;s a different way to interpret the problem.Wait, maybe BCKM is not labeled in order? Like, maybe it&#39;s B-K-C-M? But the problem says B C K M. So order is B to C to K to M.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in three dimensions? But the problem mentions lines and angles, which are typically planar unless stated otherwise.Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is constructed such that BC is a diagonal, not a side? But that contradicts the definition of a parallelogram. Diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at their midpoints, but the problem states BCKM as a parallelogram, so BC must be a side.Wait, hold on. Let me check the original problem again: &quot;Let ABC be an equilateral triangle, and BCKM be a parallelogram. Find the angle between the lines AB and KM.&quot;Maybe BCKM is a parallelogram where BC is a side, but the other side is not adjacent in the triangle. Maybe K and M are points outside the triangle.Wait, perhaps if we construct the parallelogram BCKM such that BC is one side, and the other side is of the same length but in a different direction. For example, if from point C, we draw a segment CK equal in length to BC but in a different direction, then complete the parallelogram.Since ABC is equilateral, BC is length s. Then CK should also be length s. Then KM is parallel and equal to BC, so KM is also length s and parallel to BC.But in that case, the direction of CK would determine where K is. If we choose CK to be at 60 degrees from BC, similar to the triangle, but that might overlap with the triangle.Alternatively, if we take CK to be in the opposite direction. Wait, but then again, we might end up with overlapping points.Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that KM is parallel to BC, so the angle between AB and KM is equal to the angle between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees. But in the triangle, AB and BC meet at 60 degrees. However, depending on the direction of KM, the angle could be 60 degrees or 120 degrees.Wait, angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them. If KM is parallel to BC, then depending on the direction, the angle between AB and KM could be the same as AB and BC or its supplement.But in the triangle ABC, AB goes from A to B, and BC goes from B to C. If KM is parallel to BC but in the same direction, then the angle between AB and KM would be 60 degrees. If KM is parallel but in the opposite direction, the angle might be 120 degrees. Wait, no. If the lines are parallel, the angle between them is 0 degrees. Wait, no, that&#39;s if they are the same line. If they are parallel but different lines, then the angle between them is 0 degrees, but when considered as vectors, the angle can be measured as the angle between their direction vectors.Wait, maybe I&#39;m getting confused. Let&#39;s clarify:The angle between two lines is defined as the smallest angle between their direction vectors. So if KM is parallel to BC, then the direction vectors of KM and BC are the same (or opposite). So the angle between AB and KM is the same as the angle between AB and BC. Since AB and BC meet at 60 degrees in the triangle, but when considered as lines extending infinitely, the angle between them is 60 degrees. However, since KM is parallel to BC, the angle between AB and KM is also 60 degrees. So is the answer 60 degrees?But wait, in that case, why would the problem mention the parallelogram? There must be something else. Maybe my initial assumption that KM is parallel to BC is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is such that KM is not parallel to BC but to another side. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. So BC is parallel to KM, and CK is parallel to BM. Therefore, KM must be parallel to BC.Therefore, if KM is parallel to BC, then the angle between AB and KM is equal to the angle between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees. But in that case, the problem seems too straightforward, and maybe I&#39;m missing a key detail.Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is constructed in such a way that KM is in a different orientation. Let me try again with coordinates.Let me place the triangle ABC with coordinates:- A at (0,0)- B at (1,0)- C at (0.5, (√3)/2)This forms an equilateral triangle with side length 1.Now, parallelogram BCKM. Let&#39;s denote points:- B is (1,0)- C is (0.5, √3/2)- K is (x,y)- M is (p,q)Since BCKM is a parallelogram, vectors BC and CK must be equal to vectors KM and MB respectively.Wait, no. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, BC is equal and parallel to KM, and CK is equal and parallel to BM.So vector BC = C - B = (0.5 -1, (√3)/2 -0) = (-0.5, √3/2)Therefore, vector KM must also be (-0.5, √3/2). So KM = M - K = (-0.5, √3/2). Therefore, M = K + (-0.5, √3/2)Vector CK = K - C = (x -0.5, y - (√3)/2)Vector BM = M - B = (p -1, q -0) = (p -1, q). But since M = K + (-0.5, √3/2), then p = x -0.5, q = y + √3/2. Therefore, vector BM = (x -0.5 -1, y + √3/2 -0) = (x -1.5, y + √3/2)Since vector CK = vector BM:(x -0.5, y - √3/2) = (x -1.5, y + √3/2)Equate components:x -0.5 = x -1.5 ⇒ -0.5 = -1.5 ⇒ Contradiction.Similarly, y - √3/2 = y + √3/2 ⇒ -√3/2 = √3/2 ⇒ Contradiction.Again, this leads to a contradiction, meaning that such a parallelogram cannot exist? But the problem states that BCKM is a parallelogram, so it must exist. Therefore, my coordinate system must be wrong or my interpretation is incorrect.Wait, perhaps the parallelogram is not placed with BC as a side but as a diagonal? Wait, but the problem says &quot;B C K M be a parallelogram,&quot; which usually implies that the points are listed in order, so BC and CK are sides. If BC is a diagonal, the labeling would be different.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in three dimensions? But the problem asks for the angle between lines, which would be straightforward in 3D but the problem seems planar.Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not in the standard orientation. Wait, but even so, the relationships should hold.Wait, this is really perplexing. According to the problem, there exists a parallelogram BCKM with ABC being equilateral. The fact that in all coordinate systems I try, the parallelogram collapses suggests that maybe there&#39;s a different configuration.Wait, perhaps the parallelogram is BCKM with BC and BK as adjacent sides. So BC is from B to C, and BK is from B to K. Then, CK would be from C to K, but this would not form a parallelogram unless...Wait, no. In a parallelogram, adjacent sides are two sides that meet at a vertex. So if BC and BK are adjacent sides meeting at B, then the parallelogram would be BCKMB, but the problem states BCKM.Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the parallelogram is BCMK, which would make more sense? Let&#39;s check.If the parallelogram is BCMK, then the sides would be BC, CM, MK, and KB. Then, BC and MK would be opposite sides, CM and KB would be opposite sides.But in that case, vector BC = vector MK, and vector CM = vector KB.But given ABC is equilateral, let&#39;s see. If BC is a side of the triangle, then CM would be a side of the parallelogram. If M is some point, then K would be determined accordingly. This might avoid the collapsing issue.But the problem explicitly states the parallelogram as BCKM, not BCMK. So that might not be the case.Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is constructed by extending sides of the triangle. For example, in triangle ABC, after constructing BC, we can extend AB beyond B and construct a parallelogram.Wait, let me try a different approach. Let&#39;s consider that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So the midpoint of BC and the midpoint of KM must coincide.In the triangle ABC, midpoint of BC is ((Bx + Cx)/2, (By + Cy)/2). Let me compute that.Assume B is (0,0), C is (1,0). Midpoint of BC is (0.5, 0). Then midpoint of KM must also be (0.5, 0). Therefore, if K is (x,y), then M must be (1 - x, -y). Because midpoint of KM is ((x + (1 - x))/2, (y + (-y))/2) = (0.5, 0). So this satisfies the midpoint condition.Additionally, in a parallelogram, sides BC and KM are equal and parallel. So vector BC is (1,0), so vector KM must also be (1,0). Therefore, M = K + (1,0). But also, from the midpoint condition, M = (1 - x, -y). Therefore:K + (1,0) = (1 - x, -y)But K is (x,y), so:(x +1, y +0) = (1 - x, -y)Therefore:x +1 = 1 - x ⇒ 2x = 0 ⇒ x = 0y = -y ⇒ 2y = 0 ⇒ y = 0Therefore, K is (0,0), which is point B, and M is (1,0), which is point C. So again, the parallelogram collapses to the line BC. Therefore, this is impossible.This suggests that with BC as a side of the parallelogram, and given the midpoint condition, the only solution is the degenerate parallelogram where points overlap. Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. However, the problem states that BCKM is a parallelogram, so it must be non-degenerate. Therefore, my initial assumptions must be wrong.Wait, perhaps the problem is in three-dimensional space? Let me consider that. If the parallelogram is not restricted to the plane of the triangle, then points K and M could be located out of the plane. However, the problem asks for the angle between lines AB and KM, which is well-defined even if they are skew lines, as the angle between their direction vectors.In that case, perhaps the angle can be found by considering the direction vectors of AB and KM. Let&#39;s try that.Assume ABC is in the plane z=0. Let&#39;s assign coordinates:- A at (0,0,0)- B at (1,0,0)- C at (0.5, √3/2,0)Then, the parallelogram BCKM can be constructed in 3D space. Let&#39;s assume that vector BC is ( -0.5, √3/2,0 ), as before. Then, to form a non-degenerate parallelogram, we can choose vector CK in some z-direction. For example, let’s say point K is at (0.5, √3/2, h). Then, vector CK would be K - C = (0.5 -0.5, √3/2 - √3/2, h -0 ) = (0,0,h). Then vector BM would be equal to vector CK, so vector BM = (0,0,h). Therefore, point M is B + vector BM = (1,0,0) + (0,0,h) = (1,0,h).Then vector KM is M - K = (1 -0.5, 0 - √3/2, h - h ) = (0.5, -√3/2,0 ). But vector BC is ( -0.5, √3/2,0 ). Vector KM should be equal to BC, but here KM is (0.5, -√3/2,0 ), which is not equal to BC. So this doesn&#39;t satisfy the parallelogram condition.Alternatively, if vector CK is in the z-direction and vector BC is in the plane, then vector KM must be equal to BC, which is in the plane, but vector CK is out of plane, leading to inconsistency.This seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s recall that the problem asks for the angle between AB and KM. If we can find the direction vectors of AB and KM, then the angle can be found using the dot product.Assuming that BCKM is a parallelogram in the same plane as ABC:If KM is parallel to BC, then the direction vector of KM is the same as BC. Then AB has a direction vector, and BC has another direction vector. The angle between AB and BC is 60 degrees, but depending on the direction, the angle between AB and KM could be 60 degrees or 120 degrees.Wait, in the equilateral triangle, AB and BC meet at 60 degrees. If KM is parallel to BC but in the opposite direction, then the angle between AB and KM would be 120 degrees, since the direction vector of KM would be opposite to BC. But in reality, the angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them, so even if they are in opposite directions, the angle is still 60 degrees. Wait, no.Wait, the angle between two lines is determined by the smallest angle between their direction vectors. If two lines are parallel but opposite in direction, the angle between them is 180 degrees, but the smallest angle is considered, so 0 degrees if they are parallel. Wait, no, actually, if two lines are parallel but in opposite directions, the angle between them is 180 degrees, but since we take the smallest angle, it&#39;s actually 0 degrees if they are parallel. Wait, no, I&#39;m confused.Wait, definition: The angle between two lines is the smallest angle between their direction vectors. So if two lines are parallel, regardless of direction, the angle between them is 0 degrees. Because you can take the smallest angle, which is 0. But if the lines are in opposite directions, then the angle between them is 180 degrees, but since we take the smallest, it&#39;s 180 - 180 = 0. Wait, no, that&#39;s not right.Actually, the angle between two lines is defined as the angle between their direction vectors when they are intersecting. If they are parallel, the angle is 0 degrees. If they are skew lines, the angle is still defined as the angle between their direction vectors. So regardless of direction, the angle is the smallest one between the two vectors.So, for example, if two direction vectors are opposite, the angle between them is 180 degrees, but when considering the angle between the lines, it&#39;s the acute or obtuse angle? Wait, no. The angle between two lines is the smallest positive angle between their direction vectors. So if the angle between the direction vectors is θ, then the angle between the lines is min(θ, 180 - θ). But I&#39;m not sure.Actually, according to standard definition, the angle between two lines is the smallest angle between their direction vectors. So if two vectors are in opposite directions, the angle between them is 180 degrees, but the angle between the lines is considered as 0 degrees because they are parallel. Wait, no. If two lines are parallel, they either coincide or are parallel but distinct. If they are parallel but distinct, the angle between them is 0 degrees. If they are intersecting, the angle is the smallest angle between them.But in our case, if KM is parallel to BC, then regardless of direction, the lines AB and KM would form the same angle as AB and BC. But AB and BC meet at 60 degrees, but AB is a line extending infinitely in both directions, and KM is a line parallel to BC. So the angle between AB and KM would be the same as the angle between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees.Alternatively, if KM is in the opposite direction, then the angle might be 120 degrees. But since we take the smallest angle, it would be 60 degrees. Wait, no. The angle between two lines is determined by their slope. If KM is parallel to BC, then they have the same slope. The line AB has a certain slope, and the angle between AB and KM is the angle between AB and a line with the same slope as BC. Which is 60 degrees.Wait, let&#39;s compute the slopes. In coordinate system where B is at (0,0), C is at (1,0), and A is at (0.5, √3/2). Then, AB goes from (0.5, √3/2) to (0,0). So the slope of AB is (0 - √3/2)/(0 - 0.5) = (-√3/2)/(-0.5) = √3. So the slope of AB is √3, which corresponds to an angle of arctangent(√3) = 60 degrees with the positive x-axis.Slope of BC is (0 - 0)/(1 - 0) = 0, so it&#39;s horizontal. So the angle between AB and BC is 60 degrees, as AB is at 60 degrees from the x-axis, and BC is along the x-axis.If KM is parallel to BC, then KM is also horizontal, slope 0. Therefore, the angle between AB (slope √3) and KM (slope 0) is 60 degrees, since AB is at 60 degrees from the horizontal.Therefore, the angle between AB and KM is 60 degrees.But this seems too straightforward, and why does the problem mention the parallelogram BCKM? Because even if KM is part of the parallelogram, as long as it&#39;s parallel to BC, the angle is determined. Maybe there&#39;s a trick here where the parallelogram causes KM to be in a different orientation, but based on the properties of a parallelogram, KM must be parallel to BC.Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is not in the same plane? But as mentioned before, angles between lines are calculated using their direction vectors regardless of the plane, but in this problem, since it&#39;s unspecified, we assume they&#39;re in the same plane.Therefore, the answer is 60 degrees. But I need to confirm once more.Wait, in the coordinate system where AB has a slope of √3, which is 60 degrees from the x-axis. Then KM, being parallel to BC (the x-axis), has a slope of 0. The angle between a line with slope √3 and the x-axis is 60 degrees, so the angle between AB and KM (which is along the x-axis) is 60 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 60 degrees.But earlier attempts to model the parallelogram led to contradictions, implying that such a parallelogram cannot exist unless it&#39;s degenerate, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, BCKM is a parallelogram, but with BC as a diagonal instead of a side. If BC is a diagonal of the parallelogram, then the other diagonal is KM. In that case, the midpoint of BC and KM would be the same. Then, if ABC is equilateral, we can find points K and M such that BC and KM are diagonals.But the problem says BCKM is a parallelogram, which typically is defined by its vertices listed in order, implying BC and CK are sides. If BC is a diagonal, the labeling would typically be different, like BKC M or something.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a different configuration where BC is a side of the parallelogram, but the other side is not collapsing.Wait, let me try to construct it again with BC as a side. Suppose we have an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 1. Let’s place B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and A at (0.5, √3/2). Now, construct a parallelogram BCKM. To avoid collapsing, we need to ensure that point K is not coinciding with B.Suppose we take K such that BC and CK are vectors forming the parallelogram. Since BC is vector (1,0), and CK is some vector, then M would be B + CK + BC. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, if you have adjacent sides vectors v and w, then the other vertices are v + w.So if BC is vector v = (1,0), and CK is vector w = (a,b), then point K is C + w = (1 + a, 0 + b). Point M is B + v + w = (0 +1 + a, 0 +0 + b) = (1 + a, b). Alternatively, since BCKM is the order, then moving from B to C is v, from C to K is w, from K to M is v, and from M to B is w.Therefore, vector from K to M should be equal to vector from B to C, which is (1,0). Therefore, M = K + (1,0). Also, vector from M to B should be equal to vector from C to K. So vector MB = B - M = (0 - Mx, 0 - My) = (-Mx, -My). Vector CK = K - C = (Kx -1, Ky -0) = (Kx -1, Ky). Therefore:-Mx = Kx -1-My = KyBut M = K + (1,0), so Mx = Kx +1, My = Ky. Substitute into equations:-(Kx +1) = Kx -1 ⇒ -Kx -1 = Kx -1 ⇒ -Kx -1 - Kx +1 = 0 ⇒ -2Kx = 0 ⇒ Kx = 0-Ky = Ky ⇒ -Ky = Ky ⇒ Ky = 0Therefore, K is (0,0), which is point B, and M is (1,0), which is point C. Again, the same problem.This suggests that in a plane, the only way to form parallelogram BCKM with BC as a side is if it&#39;s degenerate. Therefore, the problem might have a typo, or the parallelogram is considered in a different way.Given that the problem is from a source that presumably is correct, maybe the answer is 60 degrees, considering that KM is parallel to BC, hence the angle between AB and KM is the same as between AB and BC, which is 60 degrees.Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 30 degrees. Let me think differently. If the parallelogram is constructed such that KM is at a 30-degree angle to BC, then the angle between AB and KM would be 30 degrees. But how?Wait, in an equilateral triangle, the altitude from A to BC is at 90 degrees to BC. If the parallelogram were constructed such that CK is along the altitude, then KM would be parallel to BC, and the angle between AB and KM would be 60 degrees. If the parallelogram is constructed such that CK is in a different direction, perhaps perpendicular, then KM would be at some other angle.But given the information, since the problem states it&#39;s a parallelogram without additional constraints, the only valid conclusion is that KM is parallel to BC, leading to the angle between AB and KM being 60 degrees.Therefore, despite the coordinate contradictions, the logical answer is 60 degrees. But I&#39;m not fully confident because of the earlier contradictions. Alternatively, maybe the angle is 30 degrees.Wait, let me compute using vectors. If AB and KM have direction vectors, the angle between them can be found by the dot product formula.Let’s assume AB is from A to B. In coordinate system where A is (0.5, √3/2), B is (0,0). So vector AB is (-0.5, -√3/2).Vector KM is parallel to BC, which is vector (1,0). So direction vector of KM is (1,0).The angle θ between AB and KM is calculated by:cosθ = (AB · KM) / (|AB| |KM|)AB · KM = (-0.5)(1) + (-√3/2)(0) = -0.5|AB| = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (-√3/2)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(1) = 1|KM| = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1Therefore, cosθ = -0.5 / (1*1) = -0.5Therefore, θ = arccos(-0.5) = 120 degrees. But the angle between two lines is the smallest angle, which is 60 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, the angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them, so if the calculated angle is 120 degrees, the angle between the lines is 60 degrees.But in reality, the angle between vectors AB and KM is 120 degrees, but the angle between the lines is the acute angle between them, which is 60 degrees.Therefore, the angle between lines AB and KM is 60 degrees.But why does the dot product give 120 degrees? Because vectors AB and KM are pointing in specific directions. The vector AB is pointing from A to B, which is southwest in the coordinate system, and KM is pointing east. The angle between the vectors is 120 degrees, but the angle between the lines is the acute angle, which is 60 degrees.Yes, that makes sense. The angle between two lines is always the smallest one, so even if the vectors form an angle of 120 degrees, the angle between the lines is 60 degrees.Therefore, the answer is 60 degrees. However, according to the dot product, the angle between the vectors is 120 degrees, but the angle between the lines is the acute angle, 60 degrees.Therefore, the angle between lines AB and KM is 60 degrees. So the answer is 60 degrees, or π/3 radians.But wait, let me verify with another coordinate system. If I place B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and A at (0.5, √3/2).Vector AB is from A to B: (0 - 0.5, 0 - √3/2) = (-0.5, -√3/2)Vector KM is parallel to BC, which is (1,0). So direction vector (1,0).The angle between AB and KM is calculated as:cosθ = ( (-0.5)(1) + (-√3/2)(0) ) / ( |AB| |KM| )Which is (-0.5)/1 = -0.5Therefore θ = 120 degrees, but the angle between the lines is the acute angle, 60 degrees.Yes, so the answer should be 60 degrees.But the problem says &quot;angle between the lines AB and KM&quot;. In geometry, the angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them, so 60 degrees.Therefore, the answer is 60 degrees, which corresponds to boxed{60^circ} or boxed{dfrac{pi}{3}} radians. Since the problem likely expects degrees, the answer is boxed{60^circ}.Final AnswerThe angle between the lines ( AB ) and ( KM ) is boxed{60^circ}.&lt;/think&gt;Given an equilateral triangle (ABC) and a parallelogram (BCKM), we need to find the angle between the lines (AB) and (KM).1. Understanding the Parallelogram:   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, (BC parallel KM) and (BC = KM).   - Since (ABC) is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal and all angles are (60^circ).2. Key Properties:   - The line segment (BC) is a side of the equilateral triangle (ABC).   - The parallelogram (BCKM) implies (BC parallel KM).3. Angle Calculation:   - The angle between lines (AB) and (BC) in the equilateral triangle is (60^circ).   - Since (KM parallel BC), the angle between lines (AB) and (KM) is the same as the angle between lines (AB) and (BC).4. Verification Using Vectors:   - The direction vector of (AB) can be calculated, and the direction vector of (KM) is parallel to (BC).   - Using the dot product formula, the angle between vectors (AB) and (KM) is found to be (120^circ), but the smallest angle between the lines is (60^circ).Thus, the angle between the lines (AB) and (KM) is (boxed{60^circ}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-40815de7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-40815de7><span class="icon" data-v-40815de7>🔑:</span>Since V S K M is a parallelogram, line K M is parallel to line B C.
