We have vectors a and b with |a| = √2, |b| = 1, and a is perpendicular to (a + 2b). We need to find the angle between a and b. Hmm, right. Let me start by recalling some vector properties.First, if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, since a is perpendicular to (a + 2b), their dot product should be zero. Let me write that down:a · (a + 2b) = 0Expanding this dot product, we get:a · a + 2a · b = 0I remember that the dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude. So, a · a = |a|². Similarly, a · b is |a||b|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. Let me substitute these into the equation:|a|² + 2|a||b|cosθ = 0We know |a| is √2 and |b| is 1. Plugging those values in:(√2)² + 2*(√2)*1*cosθ = 0Calculating (√2)², that&#39;s 2. So the equation becomes:2 + 2√2 cosθ = 0Now, let&#39;s solve for cosθ. Subtract 2 from both sides:2√2 cosθ = -2Divide both sides by 2√2:cosθ = -2 / (2√2) = -1/√2Hmm, cosθ equals -1/√2. Now, I need to find the angle θ whose cosine is -1/√2. I remember that cos(135°) = cos(3π/4 radians) = -√2/2, which is the same as -1/√2. Let me verify that.Yes, √2/2 is approximately 0.7071, so 1/√2 is the same as √2/2. Therefore, -1/√2 is -√2/2. The angle whose cosine is -√2/2 is indeed 135 degrees or 3π/4 radians. So θ is 135 degrees.Wait, but let me just check if there&#39;s another angle with the same cosine. Cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants, but since we&#39;re dealing with angles between vectors, the angle should be between 0 and 180 degrees. So 135 degrees is the correct answer here.Let me recap to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Starting with the perpendicular condition, expanded the dot product, substituted magnitudes, solved for cosθ, recognized the cosine value corresponds to 135 degrees. Seems solid. Let me double-check the algebra:Original equation: a · (a + 2b) = 0Expanding: a · a + 2a · b = 0 → |a|² + 2|a||b|cosθ = 0Substituting |a| = √2 and |b| = 1: 2 + 2√2 cosθ = 0 → 2√2 cosθ = -2 → cosθ = -1/√2Yes, that all checks out. So θ is 135 degrees. Alright, confident with that answer.Final AnswerThe angle between vector (a) and vector (b) is boxed{dfrac{3pi}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given (|a| = sqrt{2}), (|b| = 1), and (a perp (a + 2b)), we need to find the angle between vectors (a) and (b).Since (a) is perpendicular to (a + 2b), their dot product is zero:[a cdot (a + 2b) = 0]Expanding this dot product, we get:[a cdot a + 2a cdot b = 0]Using the properties of the dot product, we know (a cdot a = |a|^2) and (a cdot b = |a||b|costheta), where (theta) is the angle between (a) and (b). Substituting these into the equation:[|a|^2 + 2|a||b|costheta = 0]Given (|a| = sqrt{2}) and (|b| = 1), we substitute these values:[(sqrt{2})^2 + 2(sqrt{2})(1)costheta = 0]Simplifying ((sqrt{2})^2) to 2, the equation becomes:[2 + 2sqrt{2}costheta = 0]Solving for (costheta):[2sqrt{2}costheta = -2 implies costheta = -frac{2}{2sqrt{2}} = -frac{1}{sqrt{2}}]Recognizing that (costheta = -frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) corresponds to an angle of (135^circ) or (frac{3pi}{4}) radians, we conclude the angle between vectors (a) and (b) is:[boxed{dfrac{3pi}{4}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the angle between vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of a is sqrt(2), the magnitude of b is 1, and a is perpendicular to (a + 2b). Hmm. Alright, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, since a is perpendicular to (a + 2b), that means the dot product of a and (a + 2b) should be zero. Let me write that out:a · (a + 2b) = 0Expanding this dot product, it becomes:a · a + 2a · b = 0I also recall that the dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude. So, a · a = |a|². Similarly, a · b is |a||b|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them, which is what we need to find.Given that |a| = sqrt(2) and |b| = 1, substituting these values in:|a|² + 2|a||b|cosθ = 0Plugging the magnitudes:(sqrt(2))² + 2*(sqrt(2))*1*cosθ = 0Calculating (sqrt(2))², which is 2:2 + 2*sqrt(2)*cosθ = 0Now, let&#39;s solve for cosθ:2*sqrt(2)*cosθ = -2Divide both sides by 2*sqrt(2):cosθ = -2 / (2*sqrt(2)) = -1 / sqrt(2)Hmm, cosθ = -1/sqrt(2). What angle has a cosine of -1/sqrt(2)? Let me recall the unit circle. Cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants. The reference angle for 1/sqrt(2) is 45 degrees or π/4 radians. Since it&#39;s negative, the angle must be in the second quadrant here (assuming angle between vectors is between 0 and π). So, 180 - 45 = 135 degrees, which is 3π/4 radians.Therefore, θ = 135 degrees or 3π/4 radians.Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting from the beginning: a is perpendicular to (a + 2b), so their dot product is zero. Then expanding gives a·a + 2a·b = 0. Since a·a is |a|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2. Then 2a·b term: a·b is |a||b|cosθ. So, 2* sqrt(2)*1*cosθ. Then setting the equation: 2 + 2*sqrt(2)cosθ = 0. Solving for cosθ: 2*sqrt(2)cosθ = -2. Then dividing both sides by 2*sqrt(2): cosθ = -1/sqrt(2). That&#39;s correct.Yes, cosθ = -√2/2, which is equivalent to -1/sqrt(2). Rationalizing the denominator, it would be -√2/2, which is the same value. And that corresponds to 135 degrees. So the angle between a and b is 135 degrees or 3π/4 radians.I think that&#39;s it. Let me just visualize to confirm. If a is perpendicular to (a + 2b), then the vector (a + 2b) is at a right angle to a. So, geometrically, adding 2b to a results in a vector that&#39;s perpendicular to a. That would mean that 2b has a component that cancels out the projection of a onto itself? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe drawing a diagram would help. Suppose vector a is pointing along the x-axis for simplicity. Then the vector a + 2b would have to be pointing along the y-axis (since it&#39;s perpendicular to a). So if a is along the x-axis with magnitude sqrt(2), then a is (sqrt(2), 0). Then a + 2b would be (sqrt(2) + 2b_x, 0 + 2b_y). For this to be perpendicular to a, their dot product must be zero. The dot product would be sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 2b_x) + 0*(2b_y) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)*2b_x = 2 + 2sqrt(2) b_x. Setting this equal to zero: 2 + 2sqrt(2) b_x = 0 =&gt; b_x = -2/(2sqrt(2)) = -1/sqrt(2). So the x-component of b is -1/sqrt(2). Since |b| = 1, then the y-component would be sqrt(1 - (1/sqrt(2))²) = sqrt(1 - 1/2) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2). But wait, the y-component could also be negative, but since we are dealing with the angle between a and b, which is determined by the smallest angle between them, it should be between 0 and 180 degrees. So if b has components (-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), then the angle with a (which is along the x-axis) would be 180 - 45 = 135 degrees. Alternatively, if the y-component was negative, the angle would still be measured as 135 degrees. So this matches our previous result. Therefore, the angle is indeed 135 degrees.Therefore, the answer is 3π/4 radians or 135 degrees. Depending on what the problem expects, but since it&#39;s common to express angles in radians in higher mathematics, probably 3π/4.Final AnswerThe angle between vector (a) and vector (b) is boxed{dfrac{3pi}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given (|a| = sqrt{2}), (|b| = 1), and (a perp (a + 2b)), we need to find the angle between vector (a) and vector (b).Since (a) is perpendicular to (a + 2b), their dot product is zero:[a cdot (a + 2b) = 0]Expanding the dot product:[a cdot a + 2a cdot b = 0]Using the property (a cdot a = |a|^2) and substituting the magnitudes:[|a|^2 + 2|a||b|costheta = 0]Substituting (|a| = sqrt{2}) and (|b| = 1):[(sqrt{2})^2 + 2 cdot sqrt{2} cdot 1 cdot costheta = 0]Simplifying:[2 + 2sqrt{2}costheta = 0]Solving for (costheta):[2sqrt{2}costheta = -2 implies costheta = -frac{2}{2sqrt{2}} = -frac{1}{sqrt{2}}]The angle (theta) whose cosine is (-frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) is (135^circ) or (frac{3pi}{4}) radians.Thus, the angle between vector (a) and vector (b) is (boxed{dfrac{3pi}{4}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a9560956></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a9560956><span class="icon" data-v-a9560956>🔑:</span>AnalysisThis problem examines the dot product of planar vectors and the angle between vectors, as well as the condition for vectors to be perpendicular.

Frank&#39;s teacher asks him to write down five integers such that the median is one more than the mean, and the mode is one greater than the median.

Frank needs to write down five integers with certain conditions. Let&#39;s break down the problem step by step.First, the median is given as 10. Since there are five numbers, the median will be the third number when they are arranged in order. So, if we list the numbers as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order, then c is 10.Next, the median is one more than the mean. The mean is the average of all five numbers. So, the median (which is 10) should be equal to the mean plus 1. Let&#39;s write that as an equation:Median = Mean + 1  10 = (a + b + c + d + e)/5 + 1  Subtracting 1 from both sides:  9 = (a + b + c + d + e)/5  Multiply both sides by 5:  45 = a + b + c + d + eSo the sum of the five numbers must be 45. Since the median c is 10, we can substitute that in:a + b + 10 + d + e = 45  Therefore, a + b + d + e = 35Now, the mode is one greater than the median. The median is 10, so the mode must be 11. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. So, 11 has to appear more times than any other number in the list.Given that, we need to have at least two instances of 11 (since if all numbers are unique, there is no mode). However, to ensure that 11 is the mode, it has to appear more frequently than any other number. If another number also appears twice, then 11 needs to appear at least three times. So, we need to structure the list such that 11 is the most frequent.But we also need to make sure that the numbers are as small as possible, particularly the smallest number, because the question is asking for the smallest possible integer Frank could include in his list. So, we need to minimize &#39;a&#39;, the first number.Let&#39;s recall that the numbers are in order: a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e, with c = 10.We know that the mode is 11, so 11 has to appear at least twice. Let&#39;s think about how we can fit 11 into the list. Since c is 10, which is the median, the numbers after the median (d and e) have to be greater than or equal to 10. But since 11 is the mode, which is one more than the median, we can have two 11s in d and e. But if we have two 11s, then we need to check if there are other numbers that could also appear twice. If so, then 11 needs to appear more times.Alternatively, maybe we can have three 11s. Let&#39;s explore both possibilities.Case 1: 11 appears twice. Then, the numbers after the median would be 11 and 11. So, d = 11 and e = 11. Then, let&#39;s check the total sum.We have a + b + 10 + 11 + 11 = 45  So, a + b + 32 = 45  Therefore, a + b = 13Since we need the mode to be 11, we must ensure that no other number appears twice. So, a and b must be distinct, or if they are the same, they must not be equal to 11. But wait, a and b are before the median, which is 10. So, a and b are less than or equal to 10, but 11 is already in d and e. Therefore, even if a and b are the same, they can&#39;t be 11. So, if we have two 11s in d and e, and a and b are both less than or equal to 10, then the only numbers that could possibly repeat are a and b. If a and b are the same, that would create a mode at their value. But since 11 is already appearing twice, if another number appears twice, then there would be two modes. But the problem states that the mode is 11, which means 11 must be the only mode.Therefore, in order to have 11 as the unique mode, we need to ensure that no other number is repeated twice. So, a and b must be distinct. But if a and b are distinct, then the only repeated numbers are the two 11s. So, in that case, 11 would be the mode. Therefore, perhaps we can have 11 as the mode with two occurrences if all other numbers are unique.But wait, the definition of mode is the most frequently occurring value. If 11 appears twice, and all others appear once, then 11 is indeed the mode. So, that would work. So, maybe two 11s are sufficient.But let&#39;s check if that works. Let&#39;s try to set d and e as 11. Then, a + b = 13. To minimize &#39;a&#39;, we can set a as small as possible and b as large as possible. Since a ≤ b ≤ 10, the maximum value b can take is 10. So, if b is 10, then a = 13 - 10 = 3. But wait, if b is 10, then since the median is also 10, we would have the sequence: a, 10, 10, 11, 11. But in this case, 10 appears twice and 11 appears twice. Then, there are two modes: 10 and 11. That&#39;s a problem because the mode is supposed to be 11 only.Therefore, in this case, setting b = 10 would create a bimodal distribution, which isn&#39;t allowed. So, we need to make sure that 11 is the only mode. Therefore, 11 must appear more times than any other number.Therefore, if another number appears twice, 11 must appear three times. So, in order to ensure that 11 is the only mode, we need at least three 11s.So, let&#39;s adjust. Let&#39;s have three 11s. Then, two of them would be in d and e, and one more in either a, b, or c. But c is already 10, so c cannot be 11. Therefore, the three 11s would have to be in positions d, e, and one of a or b? But wait, a and b are before the median, which is 10, so they must be less than or equal to 10. Therefore, a or b can&#39;t be 11. Hence, the only way to have three 11s is to have three numbers after the median. But since there are only two positions after the median (d and e), this is impossible. Wait, this seems contradictory.Wait, the list is a, b, c, d, e with c = 10. So, d and e must be ≥10. If we want three 11s, they would have to be in positions c, d, e? But c is 10, so that can&#39;t be. Therefore, the 11s can only be in d and e, and possibly in b? But b is ≤10. So, 11 can&#39;t be in a or b. Therefore, in order to have three 11s, we need three numbers after the median (positions d and e). Wait, but there are only two positions. That&#39;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps we can&#39;t have three 11s. Therefore, the maximum number of 11s we can have is two, in positions d and e. But then, as we saw earlier, if another number appears twice, then we have two modes.So, the problem arises if there&#39;s another number that appears twice. So, to prevent that, the numbers a and b must be unique, and different from each other and different from the rest.But let&#39;s go back. If we have two 11s (d and e), then 11 is the mode if no other number is repeated. So, a, b, c are all distinct, and different from 11. So, c is 10, a and b are less than or equal to 10, and distinct. Then, d and e are 11. In that case, the numbers would be a, b, 10, 11, 11. Then, the mode is 11, as it appears twice, and all others once. So that works.But earlier, if we set a =3 and b=10, then we have two 10s (b and c), which would conflict. So, we need to make sure that b is less than 10 so that there&#39;s only one 10. Wait, c is 10, so if b is 10, then we have two 10s (b and c). Therefore, to avoid that, b must be less than 10. Because if b is equal to 10, then we have two 10s and two 11s, leading to two modes. So, to have a unique mode at 11, b must be less than 10. Therefore, b ≤9.So, if we need a + b = 13, with a ≤ b ≤9, then the maximum b can be is 9, which would make a =13 -9=4. Then, the numbers would be 4,9,10,11,11. Let&#39;s check the conditions:Median is 10: Correct.Mean is (4 +9 +10 +11 +11)/5 = (45)/5=9. Median is 10, which is one more than the mean (9). Correct.Mode is 11 (appears twice), and all others appear once. So, mode is 11, which is one more than the median (10 +1=11). Correct.In this case, the smallest number is 4. But the options include 3 as a possible answer. So, maybe we can do better?Wait, but if a=3, then b=13 -3=10. But if b=10, then we have two 10s (b and c). Then, the numbers would be 3,10,10,11,11. Then, the modes are 10 and 11, each appearing twice. So, bimodal, which is not allowed since the mode must be one specific number, 11. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, if a=3, then b=10, leading to two modes. So, that&#39;s invalid. Hence, the next possible a is 4, with b=9, as above. Then the smallest number is 4, which is option B.But wait, maybe there&#39;s another way to arrange the numbers where 11 appears three times? Wait, earlier we thought that&#39;s impossible because there are only two positions after the median. Wait, unless we have a number before the median that is 11. But since the median is 10, the numbers before the median (a and b) must be ≤10. So, they can&#39;t be 11. Therefore, only d and e can be 11. Therefore, maximum two 11s.Alternatively, maybe one of the numbers in the first two positions is 10. So, like a=10, but then since a ≤ b ≤ c, and c is 10, a and b would have to be ≤10. So, if a=10, then all numbers are 10 or higher, but the median is 10, so the first three numbers would be 10,10,10. But then the median is 10, the mean would be (10 +10 +10 +d +e)/5. Then, the mean would be (30 + d + e)/5. The median is 10, so according to the condition, mean should be 9. So, (30 + d + e)/5 =9, so 30 + d + e=45, so d + e=15. But d and e are ≥10. So, the minimum d and e can be is 10 and 10, which sum to 20. But we need d + e=15, which is impossible. Therefore, this is not possible. So, having three 10s isn&#39;t feasible.Alternatively, suppose we have two 10s. So, for example, a= x, b=10, c=10, d=11, e=11. Then, the numbers are x,10,10,11,11. Then, the median is 10. The mean is (x +10 +10 +11 +11)/5 = (x +42)/5. According to the condition, median (10) should be one more than the mean. Therefore:10 = mean +1  Mean =9  Therefore, (x +42)/5 =9  x +42=45  x=3So, the list would be 3,10,10,11,11. But here, the modes are 10 and 11, each appearing twice. So, bimodal. The problem states the mode is one greater than the median, which is 11. But if there are two modes, that&#39;s invalid. So, this doesn&#39;t work.Thus, the only way to have a single mode of 11 is to have 11 appear twice, and all other numbers appear once. Therefore, a and b must be unique and less than 10. But then, in that case, if a + b =13, and a ≤ b ≤9, the maximum value of b is 9, so a=4. Hence, the smallest possible integer is 4. Which is option B.But wait, is there another way to structure the list where the smallest number is even smaller? Let&#39;s think differently. Maybe the two numbers after the median aren&#39;t both 11. Maybe one is 11 and the other is higher. But then, we need the mode to be 11, so 11 has to appear more than once. Let&#39;s try:Suppose we have three 11s. Wait, how? As before, we can&#39;t have three 11s because after the median (10), there are only two positions. Unless one of the numbers before the median is 11, but since they are ≤10, that&#39;s impossible. Therefore, maximum two 11s. Therefore, mode must be two 11s. So, in that case, we need to make sure that no other number is repeated.Alternatively, maybe the mode is 11 because it&#39;s the only number that appears twice, even if others appear once. So, if we have two 11s and the rest unique, that&#39;s okay. So, in that case, let&#39;s consider having d=11 and e=11. Then, as before, a + b =13. To minimize a, set a as low as possible. But if we set a=3, then b=10. But then, b=10 and c=10, so two 10s and two 11s, leading to bimodal. Not allowed. So, a must be such that b ≤9. So, a=4, b=9.Alternatively, what if we have d=11 and e= something else. Wait, but if we only have one 11, then mode would be something else. So, we need at least two 11s. Therefore, d and e must be 11.Therefore, seems like we can&#39;t avoid having a + b =13, and to prevent bimodal, b must be ≤9. Therefore, a=4.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another approach where the numbers aren&#39;t in strict order? No, the median requires the numbers to be ordered. So, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e.Wait, another thought: maybe one of the numbers before the median is equal to 11. But since the median is 10, numbers before the median must be ≤10. So, 11 can&#39;t be there. Hence, the only 11s are after the median. So, two 11s.Therefore, seems like the minimum a can be is 4. Therefore, the answer is B)4.But let me double-check.If we have 4,9,10,11,11:Median is 10, correct.Mean is (4 +9 +10 +11 +11)/5 = 45/5=9. So, median is 10, which is one more than the mean (9), correct.Mode is 11, which is one more than the median (10 +1=11), correct.Is there a way to have a smaller a? Let&#39;s see. Suppose a=3. Then, b=10. But that causes two 10s (b and c), leading to bimodal with 11s. So, invalid.If a=3 and b=9, then a + b=12. But we need a + b=13. So, 3 +9=12, which is 1 less than required. Therefore, the total sum would be 3 +9 +10 +11 +11=44, which is 1 less than 45. So, that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if a=3, b=10, which gives sum=3+10+10+11+11=45. But as discussed, this creates bimodal. Not allowed.What if we try to have three 11s by changing the median? Wait, no, the median is fixed at 10.Alternatively, could we have the mode at 11 with three occurrences? If we can have three 11s, then even if another number appears twice, the mode would still be 11. But as we saw earlier, it&#39;s impossible to have three 11s because the first three numbers are ≤10, so we can have only two 11s in d and e. So, no.Alternatively, if we have a=10, b=10, c=10, d=11, e=11. But then the sum is 10+10+10+11+11=52, which is way higher than 45. So, that&#39;s invalid.Alternatively, a=7, b=6, c=10, d=11, e=11. Then sum=7+6+10+11+11=45. Here, the smallest number is 6. But 6 is an option, but we need the smallest possible. Wait, but in this case, a=6, b=7, which sums to 13. So, a=6. But 6 is higher than 4. So, 4 is still better.Wait, but if we set a=4, b=9, we get the smallest number as 4. If we set a=5, b=8, sum=13. So, the list would be 5,8,10,11,11. The smallest number is 5. But 4 is smaller. Similarly, a=6, b=7 gives the smallest number 6. So, 4 is the smallest possible. So, answer is 4, option B.Therefore, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is B)4.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Frank needs to write down five integers such that the median is 10, the median is one more than the mean, and the mode is one greater than the median (which is 11). 1. Median Condition: The five integers in ascending order are (a, b, 10, d, e).2. Mean Condition: The median (10) is one more than the mean. Therefore, the mean must be 9, leading to the equation:   [   frac{a + b + 10 + d + e}{5} = 9 implies a + b + 10 + d + e = 45 implies a + b + d + e = 35   ]3. Mode Condition: The mode is 11, which must appear more frequently than any other number. To satisfy the mode condition, 11 must appear at least twice. The numbers after the median (10) must be at least 10, so we set (d = 11) and (e = 11). This gives:[a + b + 11 + 11 = 35 implies a + b = 13]To ensure the mode is 11, no other number can appear more than once. If (a) and (b) are distinct and less than 10, we need to minimize (a). The smallest possible values for (a) and (b) that sum to 13 without causing another mode are (a = 4) and (b = 9). This gives the list (4, 9, 10, 11, 11):- Median: 10 (correct)- Mean: (frac{4 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 11}{5} = 9) (correct)- Mode: 11 (appears twice, correct)If (a = 3), then (b = 10) would create two modes (10 and 11), which is invalid. Thus, the smallest possible integer Frank could include is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. Frank needs to write down five integers where the median is 10. The median being one more than the mean, and the mode is one greater than the median. So the mode would be 11. The median is 10, which is one more than the mean, so the mean must be 9. That means the total sum of the five numbers has to be 5 times 9, which is 45. Got that.So, the five numbers have to have a median of 10, a mode of 11, and a sum of 45. We need to arrange them in ascending order because that&#39;s how median is determined. Since it&#39;s five numbers, the third one is the median. So the third number is 10. The mode is 11, which is one more than the median, so 11 has to appear more times than any other number. So 11 must occur at least twice, right? Because mode is the most frequent number. If there&#39;s a tie, there could be multiple modes, but the problem says &quot;the mode,&quot; so it must be a single mode. So 11 has to appear at least two times, and more than any other number.Our goal is to find the smallest possible integer in the list. So we need to arrange the numbers such that the smallest number is as low as possible, while still satisfying all the conditions. Let&#39;s start constructing the list.Since the median is 10, the third number is 10. Let&#39;s represent the five numbers in order: a, b, 10, d, e. To have a mode of 11, 11 must appear at least twice. So either d and e are both 11, or one of the earlier numbers is 11. But since the numbers are in ascending order, if 11 is in d and e, then they would both be 11. Alternatively, maybe one of the earlier numbers could be 11, but since they are before the median which is 10, 11 can&#39;t be in a, b, or the third position is 10. Wait, the third position is 10, so d and e can be 10 or higher. But 11 is higher than 10, so to have 11 as mode, d and e must be 11. Wait, but if 11 is the mode, it has to appear more frequently than other numbers. If we have two 11s, then the other numbers can appear at most once. Let&#39;s test this.So if the list is a, b, 10, 11, 11. Then the numbers are a, b, 10, 11, 11. The sum is a + b + 10 + 11 + 11 = a + b + 32. The total sum needs to be 45, so a + b = 13. Also, since the list is in ascending order, a ≤ b ≤ 10 ≤ 11 ≤ 11. So a and b have to be less than or equal to 10. But we need the mode to be 11, so a and b must not be repeated more than once. If a and b are distinct numbers, then they each appear once, and 11 appears twice. So that&#39;s okay. But if a and b are the same, say both 6, then 6 would appear twice, same as 11, which would make modes both 6 and 11. But the problem states the mode is one greater than the median, which is 11, so the mode has to be unique. Therefore, a and b must be different to prevent another mode. Therefore, a and b must be distinct integers less than or equal to 10, with a ≤ b, and their sum is 13.We need to find the smallest possible integer a. So to minimize a, we need to maximize b. Since a + b = 13 and a ≤ b ≤ 10. The maximum possible value of b is 10, but if b is 10, then a would be 3. Let&#39;s check that. If b is 10, then a is 3. So the list would be 3, 10, 10, 11, 11. Wait, but hold on, the original arrangement was a, b, 10, 11, 11. If b is 10, then the first two numbers would be 3 and 10, then the third number is 10. But in that case, the sorted list would actually be 3, 10, 10, 11, 11. So the median is still 10, which is okay. The mode is 10 and 11? Wait, because 10 appears twice and 11 appears twice. So that would be bimodal. But the problem says the mode is one greater than the median, which is 11. So that&#39;s a problem. If both 10 and 11 appear twice, then there are two modes, which contradicts the problem&#39;s statement of &quot;the mode&quot; (singular). Therefore, we can&#39;t have 10 appearing twice. Therefore, the original assumption that b is 10 is invalid because that would make 10 appear twice, conflicting with the mode.Therefore, in the list a, b, 10, 11, 11, the numbers a and b must be less than 10 and distinct. So that 10 appears once, and 11 appears twice, and a and b are unique. Therefore, b can be at maximum 9. If b is 9, then a is 13 - 9 = 4. Then the list would be 4, 9, 10, 11, 11. Let&#39;s check the sum: 4 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 45. That&#39;s correct. The median is 10, the mean is 9, which is one less than the median. The mode is 11, which is one more than the median. So that works.But wait, can we get a smaller a? Let&#39;s see. If b is 8, then a would be 13 - 8 = 5. Then the list is 5, 8, 10, 11, 11. Sum is 5 + 8 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 45. That works. The median is 10, the mean is 9, the mode is 11. But 5 is higher than 4. So 4 is smaller.Wait, but if b is 9, a is 4, which is the case above. So that gives a smaller a. But if we try to make b even higher but less than 10, but since b can&#39;t be 10, as that would create a duplicate 10. So the maximum possible b is 9. Therefore, the minimal possible a is 4. But wait, let me check again.Wait, in the first case where I tried b = 10, a = 3, but that made two 10s, which created a bimodal distribution. But maybe there&#39;s another arrangement where 11 appears three times. If 11 appears three times, then the mode is definitely 11. So let&#39;s explore that possibility.Suppose the list is a, 11, 10, 11, 11. Wait, but the list needs to be in ascending order. So if we have three 11s, then the sorted list would be a, b, 10, 11, 11, but we need three 11s. Wait, no. If we have three 11s, the sorted list would be a, b, 10, 11, 11, but that&#39;s only two 11s. Wait, to have three 11s, we need three numbers equal to 11. So in the sorted list of five numbers, the last three numbers would have to be 11. So the list would be a, b, 11, 11, 11. But then the median is 11, which contradicts the given that the median is 10. Therefore, that&#39;s not possible. Therefore, the number of 11s can only be two. Because the median is 10, the third number is 10, so the two numbers after the median can be 11s, but the numbers before the median can&#39;t be 11 since they have to be less than or equal to the median. Therefore, the maximum number of 11s is two. Therefore, the mode is 11 with two occurrences, and all other numbers can only occur once. Therefore, in the original setup, we need a, b, 10, 11, 11 with a + b = 13, and a ≤ b &lt; 10, and a and b distinct. Therefore, the maximum b is 9, leading to a = 4. Therefore, the list would be 4, 9, 10, 11, 11. The sum is 4 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 45. Mean is 9, median is 10, mode is 11. All conditions satisfied. So the smallest integer is 4. So the answer is B) 4.But wait, let me check another possibility where maybe the numbers before the median are not unique. For example, if we have two of the same number before the median, but less than the mode. Let&#39;s say we have two 8s. Then the list would be 8, 8, 10, 11, 11. The sum here is 8 + 8 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 48. Which is more than 45. So we need the sum to be 45. Therefore, this is too big. So to get the sum down to 45, maybe we can have smaller numbers. If we have two 7s. Then 7 + 7 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 46. Still too big. Two 6s: 6 + 6 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 44. That&#39;s too low. So 44 is less than 45. So maybe 6, 6, 10, 11, 12. But then the sum is 6 + 6 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 45. But the median is still 10. The mode here is 6 and 11? Since both appear twice. So again bimodal. Which is not allowed. So that&#39;s not acceptable. Alternatively, 6, 7, 10, 11, 11. Sum is 6 + 7 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 45. The median is 10, mode is 11. So here, a is 6, but in the previous example, a was 4. So 4 is smaller. So this seems worse.Alternatively, maybe having three of another number. Wait, but if we have three of a number other than 11, then that number would be the mode. But the mode has to be 11. So we can&#39;t have three of any other number. So 11 must be the mode, so it must appear at least twice, and more than any other number. Therefore, if any other number appears twice, then 11 must appear at least three times, but as we saw earlier, having three 11s would make the median 11, which contradicts the given median of 10. Therefore, the only way to have mode 11 is to have exactly two 11s, and all other numbers appearing once. Therefore, the list must be a, b, 10, 11, 11 with a and b distinct and less than 10, and their sum is 13. Therefore, the minimal a is 4 when b is 9.Wait, but could we have a lower a if we have duplicates in a and b? For example, if a and b are both 6.5, but they have to be integers. So a and b have to be integers. So a + b = 13, with a ≤ b ≤9. So possible integer pairs:a=4, b=9a=5, b=8a=6, b=7These are the possible pairs where a and b are distinct integers, both ≤9, sum to13. So the minimal a here is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4, which is option B.Wait, but another thought: maybe the two numbers after the median can include a 10? For example, if the list is a, b, 10, 10, 11. Then the median is 10, the sum would be a + b + 10 + 10 + 11 = a + b + 31. So a + b = 14. The mode here would be 10, since it appears twice, same as 11? No, 10 appears twice and 11 appears once. Wait, no: in this case, 10 appears twice and 11 appears once. So mode would be 10. But the problem states the mode is 11. Therefore, this is invalid. So we can&#39;t have two 10s. Therefore, the third position is 10, and the remaining numbers after that have to be at least 10. But since the mode is 11, we need at least two 11s, so the last two numbers must be 11. Therefore, the initial structure is fixed as a, b, 10, 11, 11. Therefore, the sum a + b = 13. To minimize a, set b as maximum possible, which is 9, so a is 4. So that seems to be the minimal possible a. Therefore, the answer is B) 4.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Frank needs to write down five integers with the following conditions:1. The median is 10.2. The median is one more than the mean.3. The mode is one more than the median (i.e., 11).Given the median is 10, the third number in the sorted list must be 10. The mean must be 9, so the sum of the five numbers is (5 times 9 = 45). The mode is 11, which must appear at least twice.We start with the list structure: (a, b, 10, d, e). To satisfy the mode condition, (d) and (e) must be 11. Thus, the list becomes (a, b, 10, 11, 11). The sum of these numbers is (a + b + 10 + 11 + 11 = a + b + 32). Therefore, (a + b = 13).To minimize (a), we need to maximize (b) while ensuring (a leq b leq 10) and all numbers are integers. The valid pairs ((a, b)) that sum to 13 are:- (a = 4), (b = 9)- (a = 5), (b = 8)- (a = 6), (b = 7)The smallest possible (a) is 4. Checking the list (4, 9, 10, 11, 11) confirms:- Median is 10.- Mean is (frac{4 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 11}{5} = 9).- Mode is 11.Thus, the smallest possible integer Frank could include in his list is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a9560956></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a9560956><span class="icon" data-v-a9560956>🔑:</span>SolutionB The median of the five numbers is 10 , hence the mean is 9 and the mode is 11 .

The natural numbers from 1 to 50 are written down on the blackboard.

We need to delete the minimum number of them such that the sum of any two remaining numbers isn&#39;t a prime. Hmm, interesting. Let me think through this step by step.First, I need to recall that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes less than 100 (since the maximum sum here would be 50 + 49 = 99) are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., up to 97. But specifically, the primes we need to avoid are the ones that can be formed by adding two numbers from 1 to 50.So the goal is to remove the least number of elements so that no two remaining numbers add up to a prime. Let me start by analyzing which numbers, when paired, would sum to a prime. Then, figure out how to eliminate such pairs by removing as few numbers as possible.One approach is to consider the parity of the numbers. Since primes (except 2) are odd, the sum of two numbers will be even or odd depending on their parity. An even number can only be a prime if it&#39;s 2. So, the sum of two numbers is prime in two cases:1. Their sum is 2 (only possible if both numbers are 1, but since 1 is only once, this sum can&#39;t be formed twice. Wait, but 1 + 1 = 2, which is prime. So if 1 remains, then having another 1 would be a problem, but since we have numbers from 1 to 50, each number is unique. So 1 can only pair with itself once, but since there&#39;s only one 1, we don&#39;t have two 1s. Therefore, the sum 2 can only be formed if we have 1 and another 1, which isn&#39;t possible here. So maybe 1 can pair with other numbers?Wait, 1 is a number here. Let&#39;s check. For example, 1 + 2 = 3 (prime), 1 + 4 = 5 (prime), 1 + 6 = 7 (prime), etc. So if 1 is left in the set, then adding 1 to any even number greater than 2 would result in a prime. Similarly, adding 1 to an odd number gives an even number, which would only be prime if the sum is 2, which isn&#39;t possible here except for 1 + 1. But since there&#39;s only one 1, that pair isn&#39;t an issue. However, 1 + 2 = 3, which is prime, so if both 1 and 2 are present, that&#39;s a problem.Therefore, if we keep 1, we need to remove all numbers that when added to 1 result in a prime. Alternatively, if we remove 1, we don&#39;t have to worry about those sums. So maybe removing 1 is beneficial?Alternatively, maybe keeping 1 but removing other numbers. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s list the numbers that when added to 1 give a prime. Let&#39;s see:1 + 1 = 2 (prime, but only one 1 exists)1 + 2 = 3 (prime)1 + 4 = 5 (prime)1 + 6 = 7 (prime)1 + 8 = 9 (not prime)1 + 10 = 11 (prime)1 + 12 = 13 (prime)1 + 14 = 15 (not prime)1 + 16 = 17 (prime)1 + 18 = 19 (prime)1 + 20 = 21 (not prime)1 + 22 = 23 (prime)1 + 24 = 25 (not prime)1 + 26 = 27 (not prime)1 + 28 = 29 (prime)1 + 30 = 31 (prime)1 + 32 = 33 (not prime)1 + 34 = 35 (not prime)1 + 36 = 37 (prime)1 + 38 = 39 (not prime)1 + 40 = 41 (prime)1 + 42 = 43 (prime)1 + 44 = 45 (not prime)1 + 46 = 47 (prime)1 + 48 = 49 (not prime)1 + 50 = 51 (not prime)So, starting from 1, the numbers that when added to 1 result in a prime are: 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22, 28, 30, 36, 40, 42, 46. That&#39;s 14 numbers. So if we keep 1, we have to remove all these 14 numbers. Alternatively, if we remove 1, we don&#39;t need to remove them. So the trade-off is: removing 1 vs. removing 14 numbers. So definitely, it&#39;s better to remove 1.Therefore, my first thought is that removing 1 would be more efficient than keeping it. So let&#39;s remove 1.Now, after removing 1, we need to check other pairs. The remaining numbers are 2 to 50. Next, let&#39;s consider parity. The sum of two even numbers is even, which is only prime if it&#39;s 2, but since the smallest even number is 2, the sum of two evens would be at least 4, which is not prime. So two even numbers can coexist because their sum is even and &gt;=4, hence composite. Similarly, the sum of two odd numbers is even (since odd + odd = even). So if we have two odds remaining, their sum is even and &gt;= 2 + 4 = 6 (but wait, the numbers start at 2 now). Wait, if we have two odds, say 3 and 5, their sum is 8, which is even and not prime. Wait, but 3 + 5 = 8, which is not prime, so maybe that&#39;s okay. Wait, but 3 + 4 = 7, which is prime. So if we have a mix of evens and odds.Wait, no. If we have two evens: sum is even &gt;= 4 (non-prime). If we have two odds: sum is even &gt;= 6 (if the two smallest odds are 3 and 5: 3+5=8, which is non-prime). But if we have an even and an odd, their sum is odd, which could be prime. For example, 2 + 3 = 5 (prime). 2 + 5 = 7 (prime). 2 + 7 = 9 (non-prime). So, mixing evens and odds can result in primes.Therefore, to prevent the sum of any two numbers from being prime, we need to avoid having pairs of even and odd numbers. Because if we have even and odd numbers, their sum is odd, which can be prime. So to eliminate all such pairs, we need to have either all evens or all odds. But if we take all evens, then their sums are even and composite (since sum of two evens is even and at least 4). If we take all odds, then their sums are even, starting from 3 + 5 = 8 (non-prime). Wait, 3 + 5 = 8, which is not prime. 5 + 7 = 12, not prime. So maybe if we take all odds, their sums are even numbers, which are composite (except 2, which can&#39;t be achieved since the smallest odd is 3, so the smallest sum is 6). Wait, 3 + 3 = 6, but there&#39;s only one 3. So in the set of odds from 3 to 49 (since we removed 1), the sums of any two distinct odds would be even numbers &gt;= 6 + 8? Wait, 3 + 5 = 8, which is composite. 3 + 7 = 10, composite. 5 + 7 = 12, composite. So actually, if we take all the odds from 3 to 49, the sums are all even numbers &gt;=8, which are composite. So that seems safe. Similarly, if we take all evens from 2 to 50, their sums are even numbers &gt;=4, which are composite (since 4 is composite, 6 is composite, etc.), except 4. Wait, 2 + 2 = 4, but there&#39;s only one 2. The next sum is 2 + 4 = 6, which is composite. 4 + 4 = 8, composite. So actually, even numbers&#39; sums would be 4, 6, 8, etc., which are composite (except 2, which isn&#39;t reachable). Wait, 2 + 2 = 4, which is composite, so even numbers can stay.Wait, hold on. If we have a set of all even numbers, then any two of them sum to an even number &gt;= 4, which is composite. So that&#39;s safe. If we have a set of all odd numbers (excluding 1), then any two of them sum to an even number &gt;= 6, which is composite (since 6 is composite, 8, etc.), so that&#39;s safe too. However, the problem is if we have a mix of evens and odds. For example, 2 and 3: 2 + 3 = 5 (prime), which is not allowed. So to prevent any such pairs, we can&#39;t have both evens and odds. Therefore, the optimal solution is to take the larger set between evens and odds.Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum number of deletions. So we need to maximize the number of remaining numbers. Therefore, we need to choose the larger group between evens and odds (excluding 1 if needed). Let&#39;s count:Original numbers: 1 to 50.If we remove 1, then the remaining numbers are 2 to 50. That&#39;s 49 numbers.Number of even numbers from 2 to 50: 25 (since 50/2 = 25).Number of odd numbers from 2 to 50: 24 (since 49 - 2 + 1 = 49 numbers total, 25 evens and 24 odds).Wait, from 2 to 50 inclusive:Total numbers: 50 - 1 = 49 numbers.Number of even numbers: 25 (2,4,...,50).Number of odd numbers: 24 (3,5,...,49).Therefore, the even set is larger (25 vs 24). Therefore, if we choose to keep all evens (25 numbers), we need to delete all odds (24 numbers). Alternatively, if we keep all odds (24 numbers), delete all evens (25 numbers). So the better choice is to keep evens and delete odds (24 deletions). But we already removed 1, so total deletions would be 1 (for removing 1) plus 24 (for removing all odds from 2 to 50). Wait, but if we remove 1 and all odds, that&#39;s 1 + 24 = 25 deletions. But maybe there&#39;s a better way.Wait, but if we don&#39;t remove 1, but instead remove all the numbers that sum with 1 to form primes. Earlier, we saw that there were 14 numbers that when added to 1 give a prime. So if we remove those 14 numbers, we can keep 1. Then, in addition, we need to ensure that the remaining numbers (which include 1, the evens not removed, and the odds not removed) do not have any pairs that sum to a prime.Wait, maybe this is more complicated. Let&#39;s see. If we remove 1, we can take all evens (25 numbers) with 24 deletions. If we keep 1, we need to remove 14 numbers that pair with 1 to make primes, and then also ensure that the remaining numbers (which would be 1 plus the rest except those 14) don&#39;t have any other pairs summing to primes. However, after removing those 14 numbers, the remaining numbers might still have pairs that sum to primes. So this approach might require more deletions. Alternatively, removing 1 and then taking all evens (25 numbers) with 24 deletions (remove 1 and all odds) or 25 deletions (remove 1 and all odds). Wait, original numbers: 50. If we delete 1 and all odds from 3 to 49, that&#39;s 1 + 24 = 25 deletions, leaving 25 evens. Alternatively, if we delete the 14 numbers that pair with 1, and then also delete some others to prevent the remaining numbers from summing to primes. This might be more deletions than 25. So perhaps the optimal is 25 deletions.But wait, let&#39;s verify. Let&#39;s say we delete 1 and all odds. Then the remaining numbers are all evens from 2 to 50. Their pairwise sums are all even numbers &gt;=4, which are composite. So that works. So 25 deletions. Is that the minimal?Alternatively, maybe we can have a set with some evens and some odds, but carefully chosen so that no two sum to a prime. But this might allow us to keep more numbers. For example, perhaps including some odds that don&#39;t conflict with each other or with evens. But this would require more detailed analysis.Wait, for example, if we have a set of evens, and some odds that are all 3 mod 4 or something. Wait, not sure. Let&#39;s think.Suppose we try to include some odds. For instance, if we include the odd number 3. Then we need to remove all evens that when added to 3 give a prime. Let&#39;s see: 3 + 2 = 5 (prime), 3 + 4 = 7 (prime), 3 + 6 = 9 (non-prime), 3 + 8 = 11 (prime), 3 + 10 = 13 (prime), 3 + 12 = 15 (non-prime), 3 + 14 = 17 (prime), 3 + 16 = 19 (prime), 3 + 18 = 21 (non-prime), 3 + 20 = 23 (prime), 3 + 22 = 25 (non-prime), 3 + 24 = 27 (non-prime), 3 + 26 = 29 (prime), 3 + 28 = 31 (prime), 3 + 30 = 33 (non-prime), 3 + 32 = 35 (non-prime), 3 + 34 = 37 (prime), 3 + 36 = 39 (non-prime), 3 + 38 = 41 (prime), 3 + 40 = 43 (prime), 3 + 42 = 45 (non-prime), 3 + 44 = 47 (prime), 3 + 46 = 49 (non-prime), 3 + 48 = 51 (non-prime), 3 + 50 = 53 (prime). So 3 pairs with 2,4,8,10,14,16,20,26,28,34,38,40,44,50. That&#39;s 14 evens. So if we want to keep 3, we have to remove these 14 evens. Then, in addition, we need to check if the remaining numbers (which would be 3 plus the evens not removed) have any conflicting pairs. For example, if we remove 2,4,8,10,14,16,20,26,28,34,38,40,44,50, then the remaining evens are 6,12,18,22,24,30,32,36,42,46,48. Then, check if any pairs of these remaining evens sum to a prime. The sum of two evens is even, so only 4,6,8,... But all these sums would be even numbers &gt;=12 (6+6=12), which are composite. So that&#39;s okay. Additionally, check if 3 plus any of the remaining evens sum to a prime. But we already removed all evens that sum with 3 to primes, so that&#39;s safe. Then, check if the remaining evens (11 numbers) and 3 can form a valid set. So total numbers kept would be 1 (3) + 11 (evens) = 12, which is worse than the 25 evens if we just remove all odds. So this isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, maybe if we include multiple odds. Let&#39;s say we include 3 and 9. Then, we need to remove all evens that pair with 3 or 9 to make primes. Let&#39;s check 9: 9 + 2 = 11 (prime), 9 + 4 = 13 (prime), 9 + 8 = 17 (prime), 9 + 10 = 19 (prime), 9 + 14 = 23 (prime), 9 + 16 = 25 (non-prime), 9 + 20 = 29 (prime), 9 + 22 = 31 (prime), 9 + 26 = 35 (non-prime), 9 + 28 = 37 (prime), 9 + 32 = 41 (prime), 9 + 34 = 43 (prime), 9 + 38 = 47 (prime), 9 + 40 = 49 (non-prime), 9 + 44 = 53 (prime), 9 + 50 = 59 (prime). So 9 pairs with 2,4,8,10,14,20,22,28,32,34,38,44,50. So 13 evens. So if we include both 3 and 9, we need to remove the union of the evens that pair with 3 or 9. Let&#39;s see: 3 requires removing 2,4,8,10,14,16,20,26,28,34,38,40,44,50 (14 evens), and 9 requires removing 2,4,8,10,14,20,22,28,32,34,38,44,50 (13 evens). The union would be 2,4,8,10,14,16,20,22,26,28,32,34,38,40,44,50 (16 evens). So removing 16 evens. Then the remaining evens are 6,12,18,24,30,36,42,46,48 (9 evens). Then, check if 3 and 9 can coexist. 3 + 9 = 12 (non-prime). So that&#39;s okay. Then, check if the remaining evens (9 numbers) have any sums that are prime. Their sums are even numbers starting from 12 (6+6=12), which are composite. So that&#39;s safe. Then, check if 3 or 9 paired with any remaining even gives a prime. For example, 3 + 6 = 9 (non-prime), 3 + 12 = 15 (non-prime), 3 + 18 = 21 (non-prime), etc. Similarly, 9 + 6 = 15, 9 + 12 = 21, etc. All non-prime. So the total kept numbers would be 2 (3 and 9) + 9 (evens) = 11. Still worse than 25.So adding more odds seems to reduce the total numbers we can keep, because each odd requires removing several evens, and the union of evens to remove grows. Therefore, it&#39;s more efficient to remove all odds and keep all evens, giving us 25 numbers with 25 deletions (removing 1 and 24 odds). Wait, but if we remove 1 and all odds (3 to 49), that&#39;s 1 + 24 = 25 deletions. Then, remaining numbers are 25 evens (2 to 50). So total kept numbers: 25. Which is better than trying to mix in some odds.Alternatively, is there a way to keep more than 25 numbers? Let&#39;s think differently. Maybe not all evens can be kept. For example, in the set of evens, are there any pairs that sum to a prime? Wait, no, because sum of two evens is even and &gt;=4, which is not prime. So all evens can be kept. Therefore, the maximum size is 25, which requires deleting 25 numbers (1 and the 24 odds). But let&#39;s confirm: numbers from 1 to 50. Total numbers: 50. If we delete 1 and all 24 odds from 3 to 49, that&#39;s 25 deletions. Remaining numbers: 25 evens (2 to 50). So that works. So the minimal number of deletions is 25. But wait, let me check.Wait, 1 is an odd number. The total number of odd numbers from 1 to 50 is 25 (1,3,...,49). If we remove 1 and all other odds (3 to 49), that&#39;s 25 deletions, leaving 25 evens. Alternatively, if we remove all 25 odds (including 1), that&#39;s also 25 deletions. So either way, 25 deletions.But maybe there&#39;s a way to delete fewer numbers. For example, if we don&#39;t remove all odds but just some critical ones. Let&#39;s think. Suppose we remove 1, and some evens that are problematic. Wait, but if we keep some odds, then we have to remove all evens that pair with them to form primes, which might result in more deletions. Alternatively, if we keep some evens and remove some others. Wait, but if all evens are safe, as their pairwise sums are composite, then keeping all evens is optimal.Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s verify if all evens indeed have pairwise sums that are composite. For example, 2 + 2 = 4 (composite), 2 + 4 = 6 (composite), 2 + 6 = 8 (composite), ..., 2 + 50 = 52 (composite). Similarly, 4 + 4 = 8 (composite), 4 + 6 = 10 (composite), etc. So yes, all sums of two evens are composite. Therefore, keeping all evens is a valid solution with 25 numbers, requiring 25 deletions. Is this the minimal?Alternatively, suppose we don&#39;t remove 1. Then, we have to remove all numbers that when added to 1 give a prime. As earlier, those numbers are: 2,4,6,10,12,16,18,22,28,30,36,40,42,46 (14 numbers). So remove these 14. Then, the remaining numbers are 1, and the rest except those 14. Then, we have to ensure that among the remaining numbers, no two sum to a prime.So remaining numbers after removing 14: 1,3,5,7,8,9,11,13,14,15,17,19,20,21,23,24,25,26,27,29,31,32,33,34,35,37,38,39,41,43,44,45,47,48,49,50. Let&#39;s check if in this set, any two numbers sum to a prime.First, check pairs involving 1: we removed all numbers that when added to 1 give primes, so 1 can stay. Now, check other pairs. For example, 3 + 8 = 11 (prime). Uh-oh, 3 and 8 are both in the set. So that&#39;s a problem. Therefore, we need to remove either 3 or 8. Similarly, 3 + 14 = 17 (prime). 3 is still there, 14 is in the set. So need to remove either 3 or 14. Also, 5 + 8 = 13 (prime). 5 and 8 are in the set. So another conflict. Therefore, this approach requires removing more numbers. Hence, keeping 1 leads to a lot of conflicts, requiring many additional deletions. So removing 1 is better.Alternatively, if we remove 1 and then remove all odds, we get 25 evens. If we remove 1 and 24 odds (3 to 49), total deletions 25. The previous approach of keeping 1 requires removing 14 numbers but then having to remove more due to other conflicts. So it&#39;s not better.Another approach: Maybe there&#39;s a way to partition the numbers into two sets where one set has no pairs summing to primes. For example, graph coloring: consider each number as a node, and connect two numbers with an edge if their sum is prime. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. Then, the minimal number of deletions is 50 minus the size of the maximum independent set. However, finding the maximum independent set is NP-hard, so we need another way.But perhaps we can find a bipartition. Since primes other than 2 are odd, and even numbers are sums of two odds or two evens. Wait, but we already considered parity. The key is that mixing evens and odds can lead to primes. Therefore, the graph is likely a bipartite graph with evens and odds as partitions, with edges between evens and odds where their sum is prime. Then, the maximum independent set would be the larger of the two partitions (evens or odds) once we remove nodes that have edges. But this is getting complicated.Alternatively, since the problem allows for sums of any two numbers not to be prime, and considering that if we take all evens (after removing 1), that works. So 25 evens. Similarly, taking all odds (after removing 1) also works? Wait, no. Wait, if we take all odds (including 1), their sums are even numbers. Wait, 1 + 3 = 4 (non-prime), 1 + 5 = 6 (non-prime), 3 + 5 = 8 (non-prime), etc. So actually, all odds (including 1) would have sums that are even and &gt;=4, which are composite. Wait, but 1 + 2 = 3, which is prime, but if we remove 2. Wait, no. Wait, if we take all odds (1,3,5,...,49), that&#39;s 25 numbers. Then their pairwise sums are even numbers starting from 1+3=4 (composite), 3+5=8 (composite), etc. So actually, if we keep all odds including 1, and remove all evens, that&#39;s 25 numbers. Wait, but 1 is included. So in this case, total deletions would be removing all evens (25 numbers: 2 to 50 even). But original evens are 25 numbers (2,4,...,50). So to remove all evens, that&#39;s 25 deletions, leaving 25 odds. However, including 1. Wait, but in this case, the problem is that 1 + 2 is prime, but 2 is removed. So if we remove all evens, then 1 can stay. Then, the pairwise sums of the remaining numbers (all odds) are even numbers &gt;=4, which are composite. So that works. So this is another solution: remove all evens (25 numbers), keep all odds (25 numbers, including 1). So either removing all evens or all odds (after removing 1) gives 25 numbers.But wait, the number of odds from 1 to 50 is 25 (1,3,...,49). If we keep all odds, including 1, we don&#39;t have to remove 1. Then, the total deletions are 25 (all evens). So same number of deletions as removing 1 and all odds. But here, we can keep 1 and remove evens. So either way, 25 deletions. But which is better?Wait, in the initial problem statement, it&#39;s written: &quot;the natural numbers from 1 to 50 are written down&quot;. So all numbers 1 to 50. If we remove all evens (25 numbers), we keep all odds (25 numbers). But in the odds, 1 is included. The pairwise sums of odds are even numbers starting from 1+3=4, which is composite. 3+5=8, composite, etc. So that works. Therefore, removing all evens (25 deletions) allows keeping all odds (25 numbers). Similarly, removing all odds (25 deletions) allows keeping all evens (25 numbers). So in both cases, 25 deletions. Therefore, the minimal number of deletions is 25.But wait, is there a way to delete fewer than 25 numbers? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we can find a larger independent set in the graph where edges are pairs summing to primes. If we can find an independent set larger than 25, then the minimal deletions would be less than 25. But given the structure, since the graph is likely bipartite between evens and odds, the maximum independent set is 25. Because in a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is equal to the size of the larger partition. Here, partitions are evens (25) and odds (25). So maximum independent set is 25. Therefore, the minimal number of deletions is 50 - 25 = 25.Therefore, the answer should be 25. But wait, let me verify with an example.Suppose we remove all evens. Then, the remaining numbers are 1,3,5,...,49. Let&#39;s check a few sums:1 + 3 = 4 (okay)3 + 5 = 8 (okay)5 + 7 = 12 (okay)... 49 + 47 = 96 (okay)All sums are even and &gt;=4, hence composite. Similarly, if we remove all odds (including 1), the remaining numbers are 2,4,...,50. Their sums:2 + 4 = 6 (okay)4 + 6 = 10 (okay)...50 + 48 = 98 (okay)All sums are even and &gt;=6, hence composite. Therefore, both these sets are valid, requiring 25 deletions. Hence, the minimal number is 25.But wait, earlier when I considered removing 1 and all odds (3 to 49), that&#39;s 25 deletions as well. But if we just remove all evens (25 deletions), we can keep all odds including 1. So either way, 25 deletions.But hold on, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way. For example, if we remove numbers in such a way that we can keep more than 25 numbers. Suppose we keep some evens and some odds that don&#39;t conflict. But given the nature of primes, this might be difficult.For example, suppose we keep the even number 2. Then, we need to remove all odds that when added to 2 give a prime. 2 + 3 = 5 (prime), so remove 3. 2 + 5 = 7 (prime), remove 5. 2 + 7 = 9 (non-prime). 2 + 9 = 11 (prime), remove 9. 2 + 11 = 13 (prime), remove 11. Continuing this, we remove all odds that are 2 more than a prime. Wait, this seems messy.Alternatively, if we keep 2 and remove all odds that are primes minus 2. But this might not leave many odds. Let&#39;s see:Primes greater than 2 are odd. So, primes &gt;=3. If we have even number 2, then 2 + odd = prime. So for each odd number x, if x + 2 is prime, then x must be removed. So for example, x=3: 3+2=5 (prime), remove 3. x=5: 5+2=7 (prime), remove 5. x=7: 7+2=9 (non-prime), keep 7. x=9:9+2=11 (prime), remove 9. x=11:11+2=13 (prime), remove 11. x=13:13+2=15 (non-prime), keep 13. x=15:15+2=17 (prime), remove 15. Etc.So the numbers to remove are odds where x + 2 is prime. Let&#39;s list these:Starting from 3:3 (3+2=5), remove5 (5+2=7), remove9 (9+2=11), remove11 (11+2=13), remove15 (15+2=17), remove17 (17+2=19), remove21 (21+2=23), remove23 (23+2=25), non-prime, keep25 (25+2=27), non-prime, keep27 (27+2=29), remove29 (29+2=31), remove33 (33+2=35), non-prime, keep35 (35+2=37), remove37 (37+2=39), non-prime, keep39 (39+2=41), remove41 (41+2=43), remove45 (45+2=47), remove47 (47+2=49), non-prime, keep49 (49+2=51), non-prime, keepSo the odds to remove are: 3,5,9,11,15,17,21,27,29,35,39,41,45. That&#39;s 13 odds. So if we keep 2, we need to remove these 13 odds. Then, the remaining numbers would be 2 plus the remaining odds (which are 7,13,23,25,33,37,47,49) and the rest of the evens. Wait, no, because if we keep 2, we can keep other evens as well? Wait, no. Because if we keep 2 and other evens, we have to ensure that 2 and the other evens don&#39;t form a prime sum with any other numbers.Wait, no. If we keep 2 and other evens, the sum of 2 and another even is even, which is non-prime (as long as it&#39;s not 2). So 2 + 4 = 6 (okay), 2 + 6 = 8 (okay), etc. So if we keep 2, we can also keep all evens. However, each even added to 2 is okay. Wait, but 2 is even, so adding 2 to another even gives an even sum, which is safe. Therefore, if we keep 2 and all evens, then we need to remove all odds x where x + 2 is prime. Which we calculated as 13 odds. Then, in addition, we need to check if the remaining odds (which are not removed) form any conflicting pairs among themselves or with the evens.Wait, the remaining odds after removing the 13 would be 7,13,23,25,33,37,47,49. Let&#39;s check if any pairs of these remaining odds sum to a prime.7 + 13 = 20 (non-prime)7 + 23 = 30 (non-prime)7 + 25 = 32 (non-prime)7 + 33 = 40 (non-prime)7 + 37 = 44 (non-prime)7 + 47 = 54 (non-prime)7 + 49 = 56 (non-prime)13 + 23 = 36 (non-prime)13 + 25 = 38 (non-prime)13 + 33 = 46 (non-prime)13 + 37 = 50 (non-prime)13 + 47 = 60 (non-prime)13 + 49 = 62 (non-prime)Similarly, all other sums are even numbers &gt;= 20, which are composite.Additionally, check if any of these odds paired with an even (other than 2) gives a prime. For example, 7 + 4 = 11 (prime). But 4 is kept (since we are keeping all evens). So 7 and 4 would both be in the set, which is a problem. 7 + 4 = 11 (prime). Therefore, we need to remove either 7 or 4. But 4 is an even, so if we remove 4, then we can keep 7. But this adds to the number of deletions. Similarly, 13 + 4 = 17 (prime). So 13 and 4 can&#39;t both be in the set. Therefore, if we keep all evens, we have to remove odds that pair with any even to form a prime. But this is a lot.Wait, this approach is getting too complicated. Let&#39;s recap:If we keep 2 and all evens, we have to remove odds that when added to 2 give a prime (13 numbers). But then, we also have to check other pairs involving evens and the remaining odds. For example, 4 + 7 = 11 (prime), so 4 and 7 can&#39;t coexist. So even if we removed the odds that conflict with 2, we still have conflicts between other evens and the remaining odds. Therefore, to keep all evens, we must remove all odds. Because every even number plus some odd could result in a prime. For example:Take even number 4. 4 + 7 = 11 (prime), 4 + 13 = 17 (prime), 4 + 3 = 7 (prime), but 3 was already removed. Wait, but if we remove all odds that pair with any even to form a prime, that would be a huge number. Hence, it&#39;s not feasible. Therefore, the only safe way is to remove all odds if we want to keep all evens, or remove all evens to keep all odds. Thus, the minimal number of deletions is 25.Therefore, the answer is 25. However, let me check if there&#39;s any other way.Wait, suppose we remove 1 and all even numbers. Then, the remaining numbers are the odds from 3 to 49. Their pairwise sums are even numbers starting at 6 (3+3=6, but duplicates not allowed; the smallest sum is 3+5=8). All of these sums are even and composite. So that&#39;s 24 numbers (odds from 3 to 49). Wait, but 3 to 49 inclusive is (49-3)/2 +1 = 24 numbers. So if we remove 1 and all evens (25 deletions: 1 and 25 evens), then we have 24 numbers left. But earlier, removing all evens (25 deletions) gives 25 odds (including 1). So which is better?Wait, if we remove 1 and all evens, we have 24 numbers. If we remove all evens (25 deletions), we have 25 numbers. So the latter is better. Thus, to maximize remaining numbers, remove all evens (25 deletions) and keep all 25 odds (including 1). So 25 deletions is the minimal. But wait, when you remove all evens, you delete 25 numbers (2-50 even), and keep 25 numbers (1,3,5,...,49). So that&#39;s 25 deletions.Alternatively, removing all odds (including 1) is also 25 deletions, leaving 25 evens. Either way, 25 deletions. So the minimal number is 25.Therefore, the answer is boxed{25}.Final Answerboxed{25}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of deleting the minimum number of natural numbers from 1 to 50 such that the sum of any two remaining numbers is not a prime, we need to consider the parity of the numbers and their sums.1. Parity Analysis:   - Even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 50) sum to even numbers, which are non-prime (except for 2, which cannot be formed by summing two numbers from 1 to 50).   - Odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 49) sum to even numbers, which are non-prime (since the smallest sum of two distinct odd numbers is 4, which is non-prime).2. Key Insight:   - If we keep all even numbers, their pairwise sums are even and non-prime.   - If we keep all odd numbers, their pairwise sums are even and non-prime.3. Deletion Strategy:   - Removing all even numbers (25 numbers) leaves us with all odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 49), which are 25 numbers. The sums of any two remaining odd numbers are even and non-prime.   - Removing all odd numbers (25 numbers) leaves us with all even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 50), which are 25 numbers. The sums of any two remaining even numbers are even and non-prime.4. Conclusion:   - Both strategies require deleting 25 numbers. Removing either all even numbers or all odd numbers (including 1) results in the remaining numbers having non-prime sums.Thus, the minimum number of deletions required is (boxed{25}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is: We have the natural numbers from 1 to 50 written on a blackboard. We need to figure out the minimum number of numbers we should delete so that the sum of any two remaining numbers isn&#39;t a prime. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I need to understand the goal here. We want to remove as few numbers as possible so that no two numbers left on the board add up to a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the sum of any two numbers left should not be prime. That includes primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. But wait, primes start at 2, right? So the smallest prime we can get from summing two numbers is 1+1=2, but since we start from 1 to 50, 1 is included. However, 1 is only in the list once, so the sum of 1 with itself would be 2, but since there&#39;s only one 1, we can&#39;t have two 1s. So actually, the sum of two numbers from the list can be 2 only if we have two 1s, which we don&#39;t. So the smallest possible prime sum here would be 1+2=3.But wait, in the original numbers from 1 to 50, each number appears exactly once. So any two distinct numbers. So the sums can range from 1+2=3 up to 49+50=99. So we need to make sure that none of these sums is a prime number. That&#39;s the key.So, the problem becomes: What&#39;s the minimal number of numbers we need to remove from 1 to 50 so that for any two remaining numbers, their sum is composite (not prime). And we need the minimal number of deletions.To approach this, maybe we can think in terms of graph theory. Each number is a node, and an edge connects two nodes if their sum is prime. Then, our problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. The minimum number of deletions would then be 50 minus the size of the maximum independent set.However, maximum independent set problems are NP-hard, so maybe there&#39;s another way to approach this by looking for patterns or properties in the numbers.Alternatively, we can think about parity. Because primes (except 2) are odd. The sum of two numbers is even if both are even or both are odd. The only even prime is 2. So, if we take two even numbers, their sum is even, so to avoid getting a prime sum, we need to ensure that their sum is not 2. But since the numbers are from 1 to 50, the smallest even number is 2, so two even numbers&#39; sum would be at least 2+4=6, which is even, but 6 is not prime. So actually, the sum of two even numbers is even and greater than or equal to 6, which is composite. So maybe keeping all even numbers is safe? Wait, let&#39;s check.If we take two even numbers, say 2 and 4. Their sum is 6, which is not prime. 4 and 6 sum to 10, which is composite. All even numbers from 2 upwards: their sums are even numbers starting at 6, so all even sums greater than 2 are composite. Hence, if we have only even numbers, the sums are composite. So perhaps keeping all even numbers is okay.But wait, 2 is even. If we include 2, then adding it to another even number would give an even sum, which is okay. But what about adding 2 to another number. Wait, if we have both even and odd numbers. Wait, no. If we have only even numbers, then all sums are even and at least 2+4=6, which is composite. So maybe keeping all even numbers would work.But hold on, 1 is odd. If we have 1 in the set, then 1 plus any even number is odd. For example, 1+2=3, which is prime. So if we leave 1 in the set and any even number, like 2, their sum is 3, which is prime. Hence, 1 cannot be in the set if we have any even numbers. Similarly, 1 cannot be in the set if we have any odd numbers either. Because 1 is odd, so adding 1 to an odd number gives an even sum. For example, 1+3=4, which is composite. Wait, 4 is composite, so that&#39;s okay. But 1+2=3, which is prime, so 1 can&#39;t be with 2. 1+4=5, which is prime. 1+6=7, prime. Wait, 1 plus any even number (greater than 1) is prime? Let&#39;s check:1 + 2 = 3 (prime)1 + 4 = 5 (prime)1 + 6 = 7 (prime)1 + 8 = 9 (composite)Ah, 1 + 8 = 9, which is composite. So starting from 8, adding 1 to even numbers gives composite numbers. Wait, so 1 + 2k where k &gt;=1:For k=1: 1+2=3 (prime)k=2: 1+4=5 (prime)k=3: 1+6=7 (prime)k=4: 1+8=9 (composite)k=5: 1+10=11 (prime)Wait, 1+10=11 is prime again. So actually, it&#39;s not that starting from 8, all are composite. 1+8=9 is composite, but 1+10=11 is prime. Then 1+12=13, prime. 1+14=15, composite. So it alternates? Let&#39;s see:For even numbers (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,...):1 + 2 = 3 (prime)1 + 4 = 5 (prime)1 + 6 = 7 (prime)1 + 8 = 9 (composite)1 + 10 = 11 (prime)1 + 12 = 13 (prime)1 + 14 = 15 (composite)1 + 16 = 17 (prime)1 + 18 = 19 (prime)1 + 20 = 21 (composite)...and so on.So 1 added to an even number alternates between prime and composite. So even if we have 1 in the set, some of the sums with even numbers will be prime, which we need to avoid. Hence, 1 cannot be in the set if we have even numbers that are 2 mod 4? Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s see. If we include 1, then we need to delete all even numbers for which 1 + even is prime. But since there are infinitely many such even numbers (like 2,4,6,10,12,16, etc.), but in our case up to 50.So in 1 to 50, the even numbers are 2,4,6,...,50. Let&#39;s check which of these when added to 1 give primes.1 + 2 = 3 (prime) =&gt; need to delete either 1 or 21 + 4 = 5 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 41 + 6 = 7 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 61 + 8 = 9 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 10 = 11 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 101 + 12 = 13 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 121 + 14 = 15 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 16 = 17 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 161 + 18 = 19 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 181 + 20 = 21 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 22 = 23 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 221 + 24 = 25 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 26 = 27 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 28 = 29 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 281 + 30 = 31 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 301 + 32 = 33 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 34 = 35 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 36 = 37 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 361 + 38 = 39 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 40 = 41 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 401 + 42 = 43 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 421 + 44 = 45 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 46 = 47 (prime) =&gt; delete 1 or 461 + 48 = 49 (composite) =&gt; okay1 + 50 = 51 (composite) =&gt; okaySo, for even numbers from 2 to 50, adding 1 gives primes at positions 2,4,6,10,12,16,18,22,28,30,36,40,42,46. That&#39;s 14 even numbers. So if we want to keep 1, we need to delete all these 14 even numbers. Alternatively, delete 1 and keep all the even numbers. Which is better? Deleting 1 is 1 number, whereas deleting 14 even numbers is 14 numbers. So it&#39;s better to delete 1. Therefore, perhaps 1 should be deleted.Similarly, if we keep 1, we have to delete many even numbers, so it&#39;s better to delete 1. So maybe 1 must be deleted. Let&#39;s tentatively delete 1.Now, moving on. If we delete 1, we can focus on numbers from 2 to 50. Now, the next thing is to consider parity. Even and odd numbers. If we have a set with only even numbers, then as previously established, their sums are even and at least 6, which is composite. So if we take all even numbers from 2 to 50, that would be 25 numbers (since 50 is even). Then, their pairwise sums are all even and &gt;=4, but wait, 2+2=4 (but we only have one 2). So the smallest sum is 2+4=6, which is composite, and all other sums are even numbers up to 100 (50+50=100, but again, each number only once). So 6 to 100 even numbers. Except 2, which is prime, but all sums here are even numbers starting at 6, which are composite. Therefore, the set of all even numbers from 2 to 50 is safe. So that would be 25 numbers, and we need to delete the 25 odd numbers (including 1). But wait, 1 is already deleted, so maybe 24 odd numbers from 3 to 49. Wait, but 2 to 50 includes 25 even numbers (2,4,...,50). The original numbers are 1-50, so 50 numbers. If we delete 1, then we have 49 numbers left. If we delete all odd numbers (from 3 to 49), that&#39;s 24 deletions. So total deletions would be 1 (for deleting 1) plus 24 (for deleting all other odds) = 25 deletions. Then the remaining numbers would be all evens from 2 to 50 (25 numbers). However, we need to check if all their pairwise sums are composite.Wait, 2 is in the set. So any sum involving 2: 2 + 4 = 6, 2 + 6 = 8, ..., 2 + 50 = 52. All these sums are even numbers greater than 2, hence composite. So that&#39;s okay. Then sums of other even numbers: 4 + 6 = 10, 4 + 8 = 12, ..., 48 + 50 = 98. All even numbers from 10 up to 98. The primes among even numbers are only 2, so all these sums are composite. So yes, the set of all even numbers from 2 to 50 works. So with 25 numbers, and we had to delete 25 numbers (1 and the 24 odd numbers from 3 to 49). But is this the minimal number of deletions? Maybe we can do better by keeping some odd numbers.Wait, perhaps if we partition the numbers in a different way. Let&#39;s think about the parity.If we have both even and odd numbers in the set, then their sum is odd + even = odd. So odd sums could be prime. For example, 3 + 4 = 7 (prime), so that&#39;s not allowed. Therefore, if we have both even and odd numbers, we need to ensure that their sums are not prime. But this complicates things. However, if we have only even numbers, as before, all sums are even and composite. If we have only odd numbers, then all sums are even, so we need to check if those even sums are prime. Let&#39;s see.If we take only odd numbers, then the sum of two odds is even. The smallest sum is 3 + 5 = 8 (composite). The next sums: 3 + 7 = 10 (composite), 5 + 7 = 12 (composite), etc. Wait, but 3 + 4 = 7, but 4 is even. Wait, if we have only odd numbers, the sums will be even numbers starting at 3 + 5 = 8. So all sums are even numbers &gt;=8. The only even prime is 2, so all these sums are composite. Therefore, a set of all odd numbers would also work? Wait, but 3 + 5 = 8 (composite), 3 + 7 = 10 (composite), 5 + 7 = 12 (composite), 3 + 9 = 12 (composite), etc. So actually, if we take all odd numbers from 3 to 49, their sums are even numbers starting at 8, which are all composite. However, 1 is also odd, but if we include 1, then 1 + 2 is 3 (prime), but 2 is even. Wait, if we take all odd numbers including 1, then the sum of 1 and another odd number is even. For example, 1 + 3 = 4 (composite), 1 + 5 = 6 (composite), 1 + 7 = 8 (composite), etc. So even sums. So if we include 1 and all other odd numbers, then the sums would be even numbers starting at 4 (1+3), which are all composite. Therefore, the set of all odd numbers (including 1) from 1 to 49 (25 numbers) would have pairwise sums that are all even numbers starting at 4, hence composite. Wait, but 1 + 3 = 4 (composite), 1 + 5 = 6 (composite), 1 + 7 = 8 (composite), ..., and 3 + 5 = 8, etc. So yes, all sums would be composite. Therefore, if we take all odd numbers from 1 to 49 (25 numbers), we also get a valid set. So in that case, we need to delete all even numbers from 2 to 50 (25 numbers). So whether we delete all evens or delete all odds (except 1) and delete 1, but wait, no. Wait, if we take all odds, including 1, that&#39;s 25 numbers (1,3,5,...,49). So in that case, we delete the 25 even numbers. So similar to the previous case, deleting 25 numbers. So either way, deleting all evens or deleting all odds, we end up with 25 numbers and deleting 25. But maybe we can do better by combining some evens and odds, but carefully.Wait, if we can have a set with some evens and some odds such that their pairwise sums are composite, and the total numbers in the set are more than 25, meaning fewer deletions. Let&#39;s see.But how? If we include some evens and some odds, we have to ensure that:- The sum of any two evens is composite (which is already true, as they sum to even numbers &gt;=6, which are composite).- The sum of any two odds is composite (which is also true, as their sum is even &gt;=4, which are composite if we include 1. Wait, if we include 1, then 1 + odd is even. If the odd number is &gt;=3, then 1 + 3=4, which is composite, 1 +5=6, composite, etc. So all sums of two odds, including 1, would be even numbers &gt;=4, which are composite. Therefore, including 1 is okay.But if we include both evens and odds, we need to make sure that the sum of an even and an odd is not prime. The sum of an even and an odd is odd. So primes here could be 3,5,7,..., up to 99. So we need to check that whenever we have an even and an odd in the set, their sum is not prime.So for example, if we include 2 (even) and 3 (odd), their sum is 5, which is prime. So we can&#39;t have both 2 and 3 in the set. Similarly, 2 and 5 sum to 7 (prime), 2 and 7 sum to 9 (composite), 2 and 9 sum to 11 (prime), etc. So 2 can&#39;t be with primes that are 2 more than a prime. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s check specific pairs.Wait, to have an even and an odd number summing to a prime, since their sum is odd (even + odd = odd), which could be prime. So to prevent this, we need to ensure that for every even number in the set and every odd number in the set, their sum is not prime. So if we include both evens and odds, we have to be very careful. It might be complex. So maybe it&#39;s safer to stick with all evens or all odds. But perhaps we can have a larger set by combining some evens and some odds, provided their sums are not prime.Alternatively, maybe we can partition the numbers into two groups where one group is all evens and the other is some odds, but I need to see.Alternatively, consider that primes are mostly odd (except 2). So if we can avoid creating primes by not having pairs that sum to a prime. Let&#39;s think of specific primes and see which pairs sum to them.For example, the prime 5 can be written as 2+3, 1+4. So if we have 2 and 3 in the set, they can&#39;t both be there. Similarly, 1 and 4 can&#39;t both be there. But since 1 is problematic, maybe deleting 1 is better.Wait, but if we take all evens, we can have 2,4,6,...,50. Then, as previously, their sums are all even and composite, so that works. But if we take all odds, including 1, their sums are all even and composite. So both sets (all evens and all odds) work with 25 numbers each. So maybe 25 is the maximum size. But the problem is asking for the minimal number of deletions, which is 50 - maximum set size. So if the maximum set size is 25, then minimal deletions would be 25. But is that the case?Wait, but maybe there is a larger set where you can have more than 25 numbers with no two summing to a prime. If such a set exists, then the minimal deletions would be less than 25. So we need to check if such a set exists.Alternatively, maybe 25 is the maximum. Let&#39;s see. Suppose we try to include some evens and some odds. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we take all evens (25 numbers) and some odds. Let&#39;s see which odds can coexist with the evens without their sum being prime.So take all evens (2,4,6,...,50). Now, if we want to add some odds, we have to make sure that for each odd number o we add, o + e is not prime for any even e in the set.So for each odd o, check if o + e is composite for all even e in 2,4,...,50.Take o=1. Then 1 + 2=3 (prime), so 1 cannot be added. Similarly, o=3. 3+2=5 (prime), so 3 can&#39;t be added. o=5. 5+2=7 (prime), so 5 can&#39;t be added. o=7. 7+2=9 (composite), 7+4=11 (prime). So 7+4=11 is prime, so 7 can&#39;t be added. o=9. 9+2=11 (prime), so 9 can&#39;t be added. o=11. 11+2=13 (prime), can&#39;t be added. o=13. 13+2=15 (composite), 13+4=17 (prime). So 13 can&#39;t be added. o=15. 15+2=17 (prime), so can&#39;t be added. o=17. 17+2=19 (prime), can&#39;t be added. o=19. 19+2=21 (composite), 19+4=23 (prime). So 19 can&#39;t be added. o=21. 21+2=23 (prime), can&#39;t be added. o=23. 23+2=25 (composite). Wait, 23+2=25 (composite), 23+4=27 (composite). Wait, let&#39;s check. 23 + 2=25, composite. 23 +4=27, composite. 23 +6=29, prime. So 23 +6=29, which is prime, so 23 can&#39;t be added. Similarly, o=25. 25 +2=27 (composite), 25+4=29 (prime). So can&#39;t add 25. o=27. 27 +2=29 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=29. 29+2=31 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=31. 31+2=33 (composite), 31+4=35 (composite). 31+6=37 (prime). So 31 can&#39;t be added. Similarly, o=33. 33+2=35 (composite), 33+4=37 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=35. 35+2=37 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=37. 37+2=39 (composite), 37+4=41 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=39. 39+2=41 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=41. 41+2=43 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=43. 43+2=45 (composite), 43+4=47 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=45. 45+2=47 (prime). Can&#39;t add. o=47. 47+2=49 (composite), 47+4=51 (composite). 47+6=53 (prime). So can&#39;t add. o=49. 49+2=51 (composite), 49+4=53 (prime). Can&#39;t add.Wow, so it seems that adding any odd number to the set of all evens would result in at least one prime sum. Therefore, we can&#39;t add any odd numbers to the evens set. Therefore, the maximum set size is 25 (all evens). Similarly, if we take all odds, including 1, which is 25 numbers, we can&#39;t add any evens. For example, adding 2 to the odds set would result in 2 + 1=3 (prime), 2 +3=5 (prime), etc. So same problem.Therefore, both the all evens and all odds sets are maximal in size 25, and you can&#39;t add any more numbers. Therefore, the minimal number of deletions is 50 -25=25. So the answer should be 25. But wait, let me check again.Wait, but in the odds set, if you include 1, all sums are even and composite. But is that really the case? Let&#39;s take 1 and 3. Their sum is 4 (composite). 3 and 5 sum to 8 (composite). 5 and 7 sum to 12 (composite). 1 and 5 sum to 6 (composite). So yes, all sums are even and composite. So the set of all odds (1-49 odds) is okay. So in that case, you have 25 numbers, and delete all evens (25 numbers). Similarly, the evens set (2-50) is 25 numbers, delete all odds (25 numbers). Either way, 25 deletions.But the problem is asking for &quot;at least how many of them should be deleted&quot;. So 25 is the answer? But let me check if there&#39;s a smarter way.Wait, maybe there is a way to have a larger set by including some evens and some odds, as long as their sums are not prime. Let&#39;s try to find such a set.For example, take the even numbers from 2 to 50. Then, maybe we can add some odd numbers that don&#39;t form a prime sum with any even number. But as we saw earlier, adding any odd number to the evens set causes a prime sum. So seems impossible.Alternatively, take a subset of evens and a subset of odds. For example, take only even numbers greater than 2. So 4,6,...,50. That&#39;s 24 numbers. Then, perhaps add 1. Let&#39;s see. If we add 1 to the set of evens (4,6,...,50). Then, 1 +4=5 (prime), which is not allowed. So can&#39;t add 1. Alternatively, add 9. 9+4=13 (prime). Not allowed. Hmm.Alternatively, take all evens and remove some evens that cause problems with certain odds. But this seems too vague.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that primes are mostly odd, so the sum of an even and an odd is odd. So primes here are 3,5,7,...,97. So if we can find a set where for every even and odd pair, their sum is not in the set of primes. To do this, perhaps we can color the numbers in such a way.Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each number is a node, and edges connect numbers whose sum is prime. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. The minimum number of deletions is 50 minus the size of the maximum independent set.But computing the maximum independent set is difficult. However, maybe we can find some structure.Note that the even numbers form a clique in the graph? Wait, no. In the graph, two numbers are connected if their sum is prime. For even numbers, their sum is even, so primes would only be 2. But since even numbers are at least 2, the smallest sum is 4, so no edges between even numbers. Similarly, for odd numbers, their sum is even, so primes would be 2. But since odd numbers are at least 1, the sum is at least 2 (1+1), but 1 is only present once. So 1+1=2 is prime, but since there&#39;s only one 1, there&#39;s no edge from 1 to itself. The sum of two odd numbers (&gt;=3) is even and &gt;=6, which is composite. So there are no edges between odd numbers. Similarly, edges only exist between even and odd numbers where their sum is prime.Therefore, the graph is bipartite, with partitions as evens and odds. Edges only between evens and odds if their sum is prime. So maximum independent set in a bipartite graph can be found using Konig&#39;s theorem, which states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum independent set is equal to the number of vertices minus the size of the minimum vertex cover. Also, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the maximum matching.But maybe this is getting too complex. Alternatively, since the graph is bipartite, the maximum independent set is the larger of the two partitions or something else. Wait, in a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is not necessarily one of the partitions. For example, if the graph is a complete bipartite graph, then the maximum independent set is the larger partition. But in our case, the graph is not complete. So maybe the maximum independent set is larger than both partitions.Wait, for example, in our case, the two partitions are evens (25) and odds (25). If we can find an independent set that includes all evens except some that are connected to many odds, and some odds that are not connected to the remaining evens. But this requires analysis.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the maximum independent set in a bipartite graph can be found by finding a maximum matching and then using Konig&#39;s theorem. But without knowing the exact structure of the graph (i.e., which evens are connected to which odds), it&#39;s hard to compute. But maybe we can approximate.Given that each even number is connected to odds such that their sum is prime. For example, take the even number 2. Then, 2 can be paired with odds such that o + 2 is prime. So o = primes - 2. So for 2, the connected odds are primes greater than 2 (since o &gt;=1) minus 2. Primes starting from 3: 3,5,7,11,13,... So odds connected to 2 are 3-2=1, 5-2=3, 7-2=5, 11-2=9, etc. So 2 is connected to 1,3,5,9,15,21,... up to primes less than or equal to 50 +2.Wait, primes up to 52 (since 50 +2=52). Primes up to 52 are: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47. So subtracting 2: 1,1,3,5,9,11,15,17,21,27,29,35,39,41,45. But removing duplicates and ordering:Connected odds to 2: 1,3,5,9,11,15,17,21,27,29,35,39,41,45.Similarly, take another even number, say 4. Then, primes that are 4 + o. So primes greater than 4. The odds o would be primes -4. Primes from 5 onwards: 5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53. Subtract 4: 1,3,7,9,13,15,19,25,27,33,37,39,43,49. So odds connected to 4 are 1,3,7,9,13,15,19,25,27,33,37,39,43,49.Similarly, for each even number e, the connected odds are primes - e. As e increases, the primes needed to connect to odds also increase.This seems complex, but maybe the graph has a certain structure that allows a larger independent set. However, given that both partitions are 25 each, and the graph is likely quite connected, it might be that the maximum independent set is still 25. Therefore, the minimal deletions would be 25. However, in some bipartite graphs, the maximum independent set can be larger. For example, in a star graph, the maximum independent set can be all except the center. But here, it&#39;s more connected.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum independent set is indeed 25. For example, since the graph is bipartite and we don&#39;t know any specific structure, it&#39;s possible that the two partitions are the maximum independent sets. Therefore, the answer would be 25.But let me check an example. Suppose we have small case, say numbers 1 to 4. The problem would be: delete numbers so that no two remaining sum to a prime.Numbers 1,2,3,4.Possible primes: 2,3,5,7.Possible sums:1+2=3 (prime)1+4=5 (prime)2+3=5 (prime)3+4=7 (prime)So edges in the graph:1 connected to 2 and 4.2 connected to 1 and 3.3 connected to 2 and 4.4 connected to 1 and 3.Maximum independent set: Let&#39;s see.Possible independent sets:All evens: 2,4. But 2 connected to 3,4 connected to 1. But in the graph, 2 and 4 are not connected. Wait, but in this case, the graph is different. Wait, in the 1-4 example:The graph is:Evens: 2,4Odds: 1,3Edges:1-2,1-4,2-3,3-4.So the graph looks like a square with edges (1-2), (2-3), (3-4), (4-1). The maximum independent set in this graph is 2, like nodes 1 and 3 (but they are connected via 2-3? Wait, no. Wait, nodes 1,3 are connected via 2-3? No, 1 and 3 are not directly connected. Wait, the edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1. So nodes 1 and 3 are not directly connected. So maximum independent set is size 2: e.g., {1,3} or {2,4}.Wait, in this case, the maximum independent set is 2, which is the size of each partition. But maybe there&#39;s a larger set. Wait, {1,3} is size 2, {2,4} is size 2. But is there a larger set? If we take 1 and 4, they are connected (1-4). 2 and 3 are connected. 1 and 2 are connected. So no, maximum independent set is 2. Hence, minimal deletions is 4 -2=2. Which makes sense. If we delete two numbers, leaving two. For example, delete 1 and 3, leaving 2 and 4. Their sum is 6, which is composite.Alternatively, delete 2 and 4, leaving 1 and 3. Their sum is 4, composite.So in this case, the maximum independent set is equal to the partition size, which is 2. But here, each partition had size 2. So in the original problem, if the graph is similar, the maximum independent set would be the size of the larger partition, but in our problem, the partitions are equal (25 each). But in the example, the partitions were equal and the maximum independent set was equal to the partition size.But in the 1-4 case, the graph was a cycle of 4 nodes, which is a bipartite graph with partitions of size 2. The maximum independent set is 2. So similarly, in our problem, if the graph is a bipartite graph with both partitions of size 25, then the maximum independent set is 25. Hence, the minimal deletions would be 25.Therefore, the answer should be 25.But let me check another example to be sure. Take numbers 1 to 5.Numbers:1,2,3,4,5.Primes:2,3,5,7,11.Possible sums:1+2=3, 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 3+4=7, 4+5=9.Edges:1-2,1-4,2-3,2-5,3-4,4-5.Graph structure:Evens:2,4Odds:1,3,5Edges between evens and odds:2 connected to 1,3,5.4 connected to 1,3,5.So the graph is two evens connected to all three odds.Maximum independent set: Let&#39;s see.If we take evens:2,4. But they are connected to all odds. But between themselves, they are not connected. Wait, in this graph, evens are 2 and 4. Odds are 1,3,5. Edges: 2-1,2-3,2-5,4-1,4-3,4-5. So the maximum independent set would be either the evens or the odds. Odds are three nodes, but each is connected to both evens. If we take the evens (2,4), size 2. If we take the odds (1,3,5), but they are not connected among themselves. Wait, in this graph, there are no edges among odds or among evens. Wait, sum of two odds is even, but in 1-5:1+3=4 (composite), 1+5=6 (composite), 3+5=8 (composite). So actually, in this case, the odds can all be together because their sums are composite. Similarly, the evens can be together. So in this case, the maximum independent set is size 3 (odds) or 2 (evens). So maximum is 3. Hence, minimal deletions is 5 -3=2.But wait, according to the previous logic, if we take the odds (1,3,5), which are three numbers, their sums are 4,6,8, which are all composite. Hence, that&#39;s a valid set. So in this case, the maximum independent set is 3, which is larger than the evens partition (size 2). Hence, the earlier assumption that the maximum independent set is equal to the partition size is incorrect.Therefore, in some cases, the maximum independent set can be larger. Hence, in our original problem, maybe the maximum independent set is larger than 25. So perhaps we can do better.Wait, in the 1-5 example, including all odds (1,3,5) gives a larger independent set. Similarly, in the original problem, maybe including all odds is better? But in the original problem, from 1 to 50, there are 25 odds and 25 evens. If all odds can form an independent set, that&#39;s 25. Similarly, all evens can form an independent set, also 25. But in the 1-5 example, the odds formed a larger set. Wait, in 1-5, there are 3 odds and 2 evens. The maximum independent set is 3. So it&#39;s the size of the odds partition. So when the partition sizes are unequal, the larger partition can be the maximum independent set. But in our original problem, partitions are equal (25 each). So perhaps in that case, the maximum independent set is 25. But in the 1-5 example, even though the graph is bipartite, the maximum independent set was the larger partition. So in our problem, since both partitions are equal, maybe 25 is the maximum.But let&#39;s see. Wait, in the 1-5 example, the odds partition was larger (3 vs 2). Hence, the maximum independent set was 3. But in a balanced bipartite graph (both partitions equal), the maximum independent set could still be either partition, or perhaps something larger.Wait, for example, in a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}, the maximum independent set is n, which is the size of each partition. However, if the graph is not complete, maybe we can have larger independent sets.But in our problem, the graph is not complete. For example, take even number 2: connected to odds 1,3,5,9,... as we saw. Not all odds. Similarly, other evens are connected to different subsets of odds. Therefore, the graph is a bipartite graph with connections between certain evens and odds. Hence, it&#39;s possible that there exists an independent set larger than 25.However, constructing such a set is non-trivial.Alternatively, note that in the original problem, all evens form an independent set (size 25), and all odds also form an independent set (size 25). If these are the maximum possible, then 25 is the answer. But how do we know there isn&#39;t a mixed set with more than 25 numbers?Suppose we try to create a mixed set. Let&#39;s say we take all evens except 2 (24 numbers) and add some odds. Since 2 is connected to many odds, removing 2 allows us to add those odds. Let&#39;s see.If we remove 2 from the evens, then we can potentially add some odds that were previously connected to 2. For example, odds like 1,3,5,9, etc. However, adding 1 would require checking its connections to other evens.For example, if we add 1 to the set of evens (excluding 2), we need to check that 1 + e is not prime for any even e in 4,6,...,50. 1+4=5 (prime), so 1 can&#39;t be added. Similarly, adding 3: 3+4=7 (prime). So 3 can&#39;t be added. Adding 5:5+4=9 (composite), 5+6=11 (prime). So 5 can&#39;t be added. Adding 9:9+4=13 (prime). Can&#39;t add. Hmm.Alternatively, remove multiple evens to add multiple odds. For example, remove 2 and 4 from evens, then add some odds. Let&#39;s see.Evens:6,8,...,50 (23 numbers). Then, can we add odds like 1,3,5, etc.?1+6=7 (prime), so 1 can&#39;t be added. 3+6=9 (composite), 3+8=11 (prime). So 3 can&#39;t be added. 5+6=11 (prime). Can&#39;t add. 7+6=13 (prime). Can&#39;t add. 9+6=15 (composite), 9+8=17 (prime). Can&#39;t add. This seems difficult. Every odd added will have some prime sum with an even.Alternatively, remove a large number of evens to add a large number of odds. For example, remove all evens except for a few that don&#39;t conflict with many odds. But this approach might not yield a larger set.Alternatively, consider specific numbers. For example, even number 2 is connected to many odds. If we remove 2, we could potentially add several odds. However, as seen before, adding those odds would conflict with other evens.Alternatively, consider the largest possible independent set. Suppose we take all evens except 2, and all odds except those that sum to a prime with any even. But this is vague.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about parity. If we take all evens, that&#39;s 25. If we take all odds, that&#39;s 25. But maybe there&#39;s a way to take 25 + some more by carefully choosing numbers.Wait, but since the graph is bipartite, any independent set can contain numbers only from one partition or a mixture. However, in a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is equal to the number of vertices minus the minimum vertex cover. And by Konig&#39;s theorem, in bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching. So if we can find the maximum matching, we can find the minimum vertex cover and thus the maximum independent set.But without knowing the exact structure of the graph, this is difficult. However, perhaps the maximum matching is 25, leading to the maximum independent set being 25. But this is just a guess.Alternatively, since each even number is connected to several odds, and vice versa, the graph is likely to have a perfect matching or near-perfect matching. If there&#39;s a perfect matching, then the minimum vertex cover is 25, so maximum independent set is 50 -25=25.But without concrete analysis, it&#39;s hard to say. However, given the problem&#39;s symmetry and the fact that both partitions are equal, it&#39;s plausible that the maximum independent set is 25. Therefore, the minimal number of deletions is 25.But let&#39;s verify with another approach. Suppose we delete all even numbers. Then, the remaining numbers are all odds from 1 to 49. Their pairwise sums are even and &gt;=4, all of which are composite. Hence, this is a valid set with 25 numbers. Similarly, deleting all odds gives us a valid set with 25 evens. Hence, 25 is achievable.Is it possible to have a larger set? Suppose we try to have 26 numbers. Then, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 1 even and 25 odds, or 1 odd and 25 evens, or more of one. But adding even a single even to a set of 25 odds will introduce sums that are odd. For example, adding 2 to the odds set: 2+1=3 (prime). Hence, invalid. Similarly, adding any even to the odds set will create a prime sum. Similarly, adding an odd to the evens set will create prime sums. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have a set of 26 numbers. Hence, 25 is indeed the maximum.Therefore, the minimal number of deletions required is 25.Final Answerboxed{25}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of deleting the minimum number of natural numbers from 1 to 50 such that the sum of any two remaining numbers is not a prime, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers and the parity of the numbers.1. Prime Numbers and Parity:   - Prime numbers (except 2) are odd.   - The sum of two even numbers is even and composite (since the smallest sum is 6).   - The sum of two odd numbers is even and composite (since the smallest sum is 4, which is composite).   - The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd, which could be prime.2. Key Observations:   - If we consider only even numbers, their sums are even and composite.   - If we consider only odd numbers, their sums are even and composite.   - Including both even and odd numbers could lead to prime sums, so they must be avoided.3. Analysis:   - The set of all even numbers from 2 to 50 (25 numbers) results in sums that are all composite.   - The set of all odd numbers from 1 to 49 (25 numbers) also results in sums that are all composite.   - Including any additional number from the opposite parity would introduce prime sums.4. Conclusion:   - The maximum independent set (numbers that do not form prime sums) is 25, either all evens or all odds.   - Therefore, the minimum number of deletions required is 50 - 25 = 25.boxed{25}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a9560956></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a9560956><span class="icon" data-v-a9560956>🔑:</span>Solution. Notice that if the odd, respectively even, numbers are all deleted, then the sum of any two remaining numbers is even and exceeds 2 , so it is certainly not a prime. We prove that 25 is the minimal number of deleted numbers.

I need to find all possible values of the divisor. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall that if a number leaves a remainder when divided by a divisor, then the divisor must be greater than the remainder. So in this case, the divisor we&#39;re looking for must be greater than 8 because the remainder when 4373 is divided by it is 8. That&#39;s a good starting point. So divisor &gt; 8.Now, if 826 divided by this divisor leaves a remainder of 7, that means 826 minus 7 is divisible by the divisor. Similarly, 4373 minus 8 should also be divisible by the same divisor. So mathematically, that would be:826 - 7 = 8194373 - 8 = 4365So the divisor must be a common divisor of 819 and 4365. But not just any common divisor—it has to be greater than 8. So I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 819 and 4365 and then list all its divisors that are greater than 8.Alright, let&#39;s start by finding the GCD of 819 and 4365. To do that, I can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let me recall the steps:GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b)So first, let&#39;s divide 4365 by 819 and find the remainder.4365 ÷ 819: Let&#39;s see, 819 × 5 = 4095. Subtract that from 4365: 4365 - 4095 = 270. So the remainder is 270.So GCD(819, 4365) = GCD(819, 270)Now, compute GCD(819, 270). Divide 819 by 270.270 × 3 = 810. Subtract that from 819: 819 - 810 = 9. So remainder is 9.Now GCD(270, 9). Divide 270 by 9.9 × 30 = 270. Remainder is 0. So GCD is 9.Wait, so the GCD of 819 and 4365 is 9? Let me verify that again just to be sure.Starting with 4365 and 819:4365 ÷ 819 = 5 with remainder 270 (as 819×5=4095; 4365-4095=270)Then GCD(819,270):819 ÷ 270 = 3 with remainder 9 (270×3=810; 819-810=9)Then GCD(270,9):270 ÷ 9 = 30 with remainder 0. So yes, GCD is 9. Okay, so the greatest common divisor is 9. Therefore, the common divisors of 819 and 4365 are the divisors of 9.Divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9. But we need divisors greater than 8. From the list 1, 3, 9, only 9 is greater than 8. Therefore, the only possible divisor is 9.But wait, let me check if 9 actually satisfies the original conditions.Check for 826 ÷ 9: Let&#39;s compute 9 × 91 = 819. 826 - 819 = 7. So remainder is 7. That&#39;s correct.Check for 4373 ÷ 9: Let&#39;s see, 9 × 485 = 4365. 4373 - 4365 = 8. Remainder is 8. That&#39;s also correct.So 9 works. And since the GCD is 9, which only has divisors 1, 3, 9, and we need divisors greater than 8, only 9 is the solution. Therefore, the answer is 9.But let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn&#39;t skip a step or make a mistake.First, subtracting the remainders from the numbers:826 - 7 = 8194373 - 8 = 4365Find GCD(819,4365). Using the Euclidean algorithm:4365 divided by 819: 819×5=4095, 4365-4095=270. So GCD(819,270)819 divided by 270: 270×3=810, 819-810=9. So GCD(270,9)270 divided by 9: 9×30=270, remainder 0. GCD is 9. Correct.Divisors of 9: 1, 3, 9. Greater than 8: only 9. Then verify with original numbers:826 divided by 9: 9*91=819, 826-819=7. Correct.4373 divided by 9: 9*485=4365, 4373-4365=8. Correct.So everything checks out. Therefore, the only possible divisor is 9.But wait, let me just consider if there&#39;s any other possible divisor. Suppose, for instance, if there was a miscalculation in the GCD. Let me check the intermediate steps again.First step: GCD(4365,819). 4365 ÷ 819 is 5, remainder 270. Correct.Second step: GCD(819,270). 819 ÷ 270 is 3, remainder 9. Correct.Third step: GCD(270,9). 270 ÷ 9 is 30, remainder 0. Correct. So GCD is indeed 9. So no, there&#39;s no error here. Therefore, the only divisors are 1,3,9. Only 9 is greater than 8. So the answer is 9.I think that&#39;s all. So the answer is 9.Final AnswerThe divisor is boxed{9}.&lt;/think&gt;When the numbers 826 and 4373 are divided by the same natural number, the remainders are 7 and 8 respectively. We need to find all possible values of the divisor.First, we note that the divisor must be greater than 8. If a number leaves a remainder when divided by a divisor, then the divisor must be greater than the remainder. Therefore, the divisor must be greater than 8.Next, we subtract the remainders from the given numbers:[826 - 7 = 819][4373 - 8 = 4365]We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 819 and 4365 using the Euclidean algorithm:1. ( 4365 div 819 = 5 ) with remainder 270, so ( gcd(4365, 819) = gcd(819, 270) ).2. ( 819 div 270 = 3 ) with remainder 9, so ( gcd(819, 270) = gcd(270, 9) ).3. ( 270 div 9 = 30 ) with remainder 0, so ( gcd(270, 9) = 9 ).The GCD of 819 and 4365 is 9. The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. Since the divisor must be greater than 8, the only possible value is 9.Verification:- ( 826 div 9 ) leaves a remainder of 7 (since ( 9 times 91 = 819 ) and ( 826 - 819 = 7 )).- ( 4373 div 9 ) leaves a remainder of 8 (since ( 9 times 485 = 4365 ) and ( 4373 - 4365 = 8 )).Thus, the divisor is (boxed{9}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is asking to find all natural numbers that when you divide 826 by them, the remainder is 7, and when you divide 4373 by them, the remainder is 8. Hmm, okay. So, basically, we&#39;re looking for a divisor N such that:826 ≡ 7 mod N, which means N divides (826 - 7) = 819,and4373 ≡ 8 mod N, which means N divides (4373 - 8) = 4365.So, N must be a common divisor of 819 and 4365, but also since the remainder has to be 7 and 8 when dividing 826 and 4373 respectively, N must be greater than 7 and 8. Since the remainder has to be less than the divisor, right? So N must be greater than 8. Therefore, N is a common divisor of 819 and 4365 that&#39;s greater than 8.Okay, so first step is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 819 and 4365. Then all the divisors of that GCD which are greater than 8 will be the solutions.Let&#39;s compute GCD(819, 4365). To do this, I can use the Euclidean algorithm.First, divide 4365 by 819. Let&#39;s see how many times 819 fits into 4365.819 * 5 = 4095. 4365 - 4095 = 270. So, 4365 = 819 * 5 + 270.Now, replace the numbers with 819 and 270. So, GCD(819, 270).Divide 819 by 270. 270 * 3 = 810. 819 - 810 = 9. So, 819 = 270 * 3 + 9.Now GCD(270, 9).Divide 270 by 9. 9 * 30 = 270. So remainder 0. Therefore, the GCD is 9.So, GCD(819, 4365) is 9. Therefore, the common divisors of 819 and 4365 are the divisors of 9. The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9. But we need divisors greater than 8. So the only one is 9.Wait, but let&#39;s check that. If N is 9, then when we divide 826 by 9, what&#39;s the remainder?Divide 826 by 9. 9*91 = 819. 826 - 819 = 7. So remainder 7. Okay, that&#39;s correct.Then divide 4373 by 9. Let&#39;s see. 9*485 = 4365. 4373 - 4365 = 8. Remainder 8. Perfect, that&#39;s correct. So N=9 works.But wait, the problem says &quot;find all values of the divisor&quot;. So are there multiple divisors?But according to the GCD, the only common divisors are 1, 3, 9. But since N has to be greater than 8, only 9. So the answer is 9.Wait, but let me verify again. Maybe I made a mistake in the GCD calculation?Let me check step by step.First, 4365 divided by 819.819*5 = 4095. 4365 - 4095 = 270. Correct.Then GCD(819,270).819 divided by 270 is 3 with remainder 9. Because 270*3 = 810, 819-810=9. Correct.GCD(270,9). 270 divided by 9 is 30, remainder 0. So GCD is 9. That&#39;s correct.Therefore, the common divisors are 1,3,9. Since the divisor must be greater than 8, only 9.Therefore, the only possible divisor is 9.But let me cross-verify. Let&#39;s check if 3 is a possible divisor. Wait, if N=3, then 826 divided by 3: 3*275=825, remainder 1. But the remainder should be 7, which is impossible. Similarly for 4373 divided by 3: 3*1457=4371, remainder 2. Not 8. So 3 is invalid.Similarly, N=1: dividing by 1 always gives remainder 0. So no.Therefore, only N=9 is valid.So the answer is 9. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{9}Final AnswerThe only value of the divisor is boxed{9}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find all natural numbers ( N ) such that when 826 is divided by ( N ), the remainder is 7, and when 4373 is divided by ( N ), the remainder is 8. First, we translate these conditions into mathematical expressions:- ( 826 equiv 7 pmod{N} ) implies ( N ) divides ( 826 - 7 = 819 )- ( 4373 equiv 8 pmod{N} ) implies ( N ) divides ( 4373 - 8 = 4365 )Thus, ( N ) must be a common divisor of 819 and 4365. Additionally, ( N ) must be greater than 8 because the remainder must be less than the divisor.To find the common divisors, we compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 819 and 4365 using the Euclidean algorithm:1. ( 4365 div 819 = 5 ) with remainder 270, so ( 4365 = 819 times 5 + 270 )2. ( 819 div 270 = 3 ) with remainder 9, so ( 819 = 270 times 3 + 9 )3.

Let me go through each one step by step. Starting with statement A: If a line l is parallel to two different planes α and β, then the planes α and β must be parallel. Hmm, is that necessarily true? Let me visualize this. If line l is parallel to both planes, that means it doesn&#39;t intersect either plane, right? But planes can be arranged in different ways. For example, if two planes are not parallel, they intersect along some line. Could there be a line that&#39;s parallel to both of those intersecting planes? Imagine two planes intersecting at a line, say m. If I take another line l that&#39;s parallel to both planes, would that line l have to be parallel to the line of intersection m? Wait, if l is parallel to both planes, then it must be parallel to all lines in those planes. But the line of intersection m is in both planes. So l must be parallel to m. But even so, the two planes α and β could still intersect along m, while l is parallel to m. So in that case, l is parallel to both planes, but the planes aren&#39;t parallel. So statement A would be false. For example, take the floor as one plane and a wall as another plane; they intersect at the corner. If I have a line that&#39;s parallel to both the floor and the wall, maybe a line running along the ceiling&#39;s edge, which is parallel to both the floor and the wall, but the floor and wall aren&#39;t parallel. So A is false. Got it.Moving on to statement B: If l is parallel to α and perpendicular to β, then α is perpendicular to β. Let me think. If a line is parallel to a plane, then the line&#39;s direction is parallel to that plane. If the same line is perpendicular to another plane β, then the direction of the line is perpendicular to β. But if the direction of the line is both parallel to α and perpendicular to β, does that mean α and β must be perpendicular? Let me recall that if a line is perpendicular to a plane, it&#39;s perpendicular to every line in that plane. But if the line is parallel to plane α, then the line&#39;s direction vector lies within the plane α&#39;s direction. So, if the direction vector of line l is perpendicular to plane β, then plane α, which contains a direction vector perpendicular to β, must itself be perpendicular to β. Because if a plane α has a direction vector that&#39;s perpendicular to β, then the planes must be perpendicular. So that seems right. Let me confirm with an example. Suppose β is the xy-plane, and line l is along the z-axis, which is perpendicular to β. Then α must be a plane that contains the z-axis (since l is parallel to α). A plane containing the z-axis would be, for example, the xz-plane or yz-plane, both of which are perpendicular to the xy-plane. So yes, α and β are perpendicular. So statement B is true.Statement C: If α is perpendicular to β and l is perpendicular to α, then l is perpendicular to β. Hmm. Let&#39;s unpack this. If two planes α and β are perpendicular, that means their normal vectors are perpendicular. If line l is perpendicular to α, then l is parallel to the normal vector of α. But if the normal vector of α is perpendicular to the normal vector of β, does that mean l is parallel to the normal vector of β? Wait, no. If two normals are perpendicular, then a line parallel to one normal is not necessarily parallel to the other normal. Wait, actually, if α is perpendicular to β, then their normals are perpendicular. So if l is perpendicular to α, then l is along the normal of α, which is perpendicular to the normal of β. Therefore, l is parallel to β? Wait, no. Wait, if l is along the normal of α, which is perpendicular to the normal of β, then l must lie in β? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of coordinates. Let α be the x-y plane, whose normal is along the z-axis. Then β, being perpendicular to α, would be any plane that contains the z-axis, like the y-z plane or x-z plane. The normal vector of β (say, the y-z plane has a normal along the x-axis). If l is perpendicular to α, so it&#39;s along the z-axis. Then is l perpendicular to β? If β is the y-z plane, then the normal of β is along the x-axis. But l is along the z-axis, which is not perpendicular to the y-z plane. In fact, the z-axis lies within the y-z plane. So l is actually parallel to β. Wait, but if l is along the z-axis, and β is the y-z plane, then l is in β. So l can&#39;t be perpendicular to β. So in this case, α is perpendicular to β, l is perpendicular to α, but l is not perpendicular to β—it&#39;s actually lying in β. Therefore, statement C is false.So C is false. That example shows it. Statement D: If α is perpendicular to β and l is parallel to α, then l is perpendicular to β. Hmm. Let&#39;s see. If l is parallel to α, then the direction of l lies within α. Since α is perpendicular to β, does that mean any line in α is perpendicular to β? Wait, no. For example, take α as the x-y plane and β as the y-z plane. They are perpendicular. A line parallel to α would be any line in the x-y plane. Let&#39;s take the x-axis. Is the x-axis perpendicular to β (the y-z plane)? The x-axis is perpendicular to the y-z plane, yes. Wait, because the direction vector of the x-axis is (1,0,0), and the normal vector of the y-z plane is (1,0,0). Wait, no, the normal vector of the y-z plane is along the x-axis. So a line parallel to the x-axis is actually parallel to the normal vector of the y-z plane. Therefore, the x-axis is perpendicular to the y-z plane. But wait, if I take another line in α, say the y-axis. The y-axis is in the x-y plane (α) and is parallel to α. But the y-axis is in the y-z plane (β) as well. Wait, no, the y-axis is the intersection of the x-y plane and the y-z plane. So the y-axis is actually lying in both planes. Therefore, the y-axis is parallel to α (x-y plane) and is also parallel to β (y-z plane). So in this case, l (the y-axis) is parallel to α and is not perpendicular to β, but in fact is parallel to β. Hence, statement D is false.Wait, so D says if α is perpendicular to β and l is parallel to α, then l is perpendicular to β. But in the example above, with α as x-y, β as y-z, and l as y-axis, which is parallel to α, but l is not perpendicular to β. Therefore, D is false.But let&#39;s check another line in α. Suppose l is the line along the x-y plane at a 45-degree angle. Then l is parallel to α. Is this line perpendicular to β (y-z plane)? The direction vector of l would have components in x and y. The normal vector of β is along the x-direction. The line&#39;s direction vector is (1,1,0). The dot product with the normal vector (1,0,0) is 1, which is not zero, so the line is not perpendicular to β. Therefore, D is false.So summarizing:A: FalseB: TrueC: FalseD: FalseSo only statement B is correct.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Let&#39;s analyze each statement step by step:Statement A: If ( l parallel alpha ) and ( l parallel beta ), then ( alpha parallel beta ).  - If a line ( l ) is parallel to two planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ), the planes do not necessarily have to be parallel. They could intersect along another line. For example, if ( alpha ) and ( beta ) intersect along a line ( m ), ( l ) could be parallel to both planes without ( alpha ) and ( beta ) being parallel. Thus, statement A is false.Statement B: If ( l parallel alpha ) and ( l perp beta ), then ( alpha perp beta ).  - If a line ( l ) is parallel to plane ( alpha ), its direction vector lies within ( alpha ). If ( l ) is perpendicular to plane ( beta ), its direction vector is perpendicular to ( beta ). Since ( alpha ) contains a direction vector perpendicular to ( beta ), the planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ) must be perpendicular. For example, if ( beta ) is the xy-plane and ( l ) is along the z-axis (perpendicular to ( beta )), then ( alpha ) must be a plane containing the z-axis (e.g., xz-plane or yz-plane), which is perpendicular to the xy-plane. Thus, statement B is true.Statement C: If ( alpha perp beta ) and ( l perp alpha ), then ( l perp beta ).  - If ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are perpendicular, their normal vectors are perpendicular. If ( l ) is perpendicular to ( alpha ), it is parallel to the normal vector of ( alpha ). However, this does not imply ( l ) is perpendicular to ( beta ). For example, if ( alpha ) is the xy-plane and ( beta ) is the yz-plane, the z-axis (perpendicular to ( alpha )) lies within ( beta ), so it is not perpendicular to ( beta ). Thus, statement C is false.Statement D: If ( alpha perp beta ) and ( l parallel alpha ), then ( l perp beta ).  - If ( l ) is parallel to ( alpha ), its direction vector lies within ( alpha ). However, this does not imply ( l ) is perpendicular to ( beta ). For example, if ( alpha ) is the xy-plane and ( beta ) is the yz-plane, the y-axis (parallel to ( alpha )) is also parallel to ( beta ). Thus, statement D is false. Final Answerboxed{B},&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to figure out which of these statements A, B, C, D are true. All of them involve lines and planes being parallel or perpendicular. Let me take them one by one.Starting with statement A: If a line l is parallel to both planes α and β, then α is parallel to β. Hmm. So, if a line is parallel to two different planes, does that mean the planes must be parallel? Let me visualize. Imagine two planes. If a line is parallel to both, does that force the planes to be parallel? Wait, what if the planes intersect? If they intersect, their intersection would be a line. If there&#39;s a line l that&#39;s parallel to both planes, would that line have to be parallel to the line of intersection? Hmm. Maybe not necessarily. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have two planes that are not parallel, like the floor and a wall in a room. They intersect along the line where the wall meets the floor. Now, is there a line that&#39;s parallel to both the floor and the wall? Maybe a line that&#39;s running along the corner where another wall meets the ceiling? Wait, no, that line would be intersecting the floor and the wall. Wait, maybe a line that&#39;s on the ceiling, parallel to the floor. That line is parallel to the floor, but is it parallel to the wall? If the wall is vertical, then a horizontal line on the ceiling is not parallel to the wall. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a line that&#39;s parallel to both. If the planes intersect, then any line parallel to both must be parallel to their line of intersection. Wait, maybe. So if two planes intersect, then their common parallel line must be parallel to the line of intersection. So if there exists a line not lying on that line of intersection but still parallel to both planes, then the planes must be parallel. Wait, I&#39;m getting confused. Let me check: If two planes are not parallel, they intersect in a line. Let&#39;s call that line m. If there is another line l that&#39;s parallel to both planes, then l must be parallel to line m. Because in each plane, the direction of l must be parallel to that plane. Since the intersection line m is the common line, l must be parallel to m. Therefore, even if the planes are not parallel, there can exist a line parallel to both, as long as it&#39;s parallel to their line of intersection. So statement A would be false because even if two planes are not parallel, there can be a line parallel to both. For example, take two intersecting planes (so they are not parallel), and take a line that&#39;s parallel to their line of intersection. That line would be parallel to both planes. Therefore, A is false.Moving on to statement B: If l is parallel to α and perpendicular to β, then α is perpendicular to β. Let&#39;s see. If a line is parallel to one plane and perpendicular to another, does that make the planes perpendicular? Let me think. If l is parallel to α, then l&#39;s direction is parallel to α. If l is perpendicular to β, that means l is perpendicular to every line in β, right? Wait, no. If a line is perpendicular to a plane, it&#39;s perpendicular to every line in that plane. So if l is perpendicular to β, then l is perpendicular to β. And if l is parallel to α, then the direction of l is parallel to α. So, the plane α contains directions parallel to l, and plane β is perpendicular to l. Therefore, any line in β must be perpendicular to l, and any line in α can have a component along l. Therefore, the planes α and β must intersect at some angle. Specifically, since l is perpendicular to β and parallel to α, the angle between α and β should be such that the normal vector of β is perpendicular to l, and l is in α. So the normal vector of β is perpendicular to α&#39;s direction. Therefore, the angle between α and β would be 90 degrees. Wait, maybe. Let me think in terms of normal vectors. Suppose plane α has normal vector n₁, and plane β has normal vector n₂. If l is parallel to α, then l is perpendicular to n₁. Also, l is perpendicular to β, which means l is parallel to n₂. Wait, if l is perpendicular to β, then l is parallel to the normal vector of β. So, l is parallel to n₂ and perpendicular to n₁. Therefore, n₂ is perpendicular to n₁. So the normals are perpendicular, which means the planes are perpendicular. Therefore, statement B is true. So B is correct.Now statement C: If α is perpendicular to β and l is perpendicular to α, then l is perpendicular to β. Hmm. So if two planes are perpendicular, and a line is perpendicular to one, is it necessarily perpendicular to the other? Let me think. Suppose α and β are perpendicular. So their normals are perpendicular. Let l be perpendicular to α, so l is parallel to the normal of α. Then, since the normal of α is perpendicular to the normal of β, l is parallel to the normal of α, which is perpendicular to the normal of β. But does that make l perpendicular to β? If l is parallel to the normal of α, and the normal of α is perpendicular to the normal of β, then the normal of β lies in α. Wait, maybe not. Let me think in coordinates. Let’s set up a coordinate system where α is the x-y plane, so its normal is along the z-axis. Then β, being perpendicular to α, would have a normal vector in the x-y plane. Let&#39;s say the normal vector of β is along the x-axis. So β is the y-z plane. Then, if l is perpendicular to α (the x-y plane), l is along the z-axis. But β is the y-z plane. Is l (along z-axis) perpendicular to β? The normal of β is along the x-axis. So l is along z-axis, which is not perpendicular to β. Wait, actually, a line perpendicular to β would need to be along the x-axis. But l is along the z-axis, which is not perpendicular to β. Instead, l lies on β (since β is y-z plane). Wait, if β is the y-z plane, then the line along the z-axis is actually lying on β. So in this case, l is not perpendicular to β, but lies on β. So statement C is false. Therefore, C is incorrect.Wait, but in this example, α is x-y plane (normal along z), β is y-z plane (normal along x). Then l, which is along z, is perpendicular to α but lies on β, not perpendicular to β. So C is false.Now statement D: If α is perpendicular to β and l is parallel to α, then l is perpendicular to β. So similar to C but different. So if two planes are perpendicular, and a line is parallel to one, is it perpendicular to the other? Let&#39;s use the same coordinate system. α is x-y plane, β is y-z plane, normals along z and x respectively. A line parallel to α (x-y plane) would be any line in the x-y plane or parallel to it. For example, the x-axis. Is the x-axis perpendicular to β (y-z plane)? The normal of β is along the x-axis. So a line along the x-axis is parallel to the normal of β, meaning it&#39;s perpendicular to β. Wait, yes. If a line is parallel to α (x-y) and α is perpendicular to β (y-z), then if the line is along x-axis (which is parallel to α), then it&#39;s indeed perpendicular to β. But what if the line is along the y-axis? The y-axis is parallel to α (since it&#39;s in the x-y plane) and is also lying in β (the y-z plane). So a line along y-axis is parallel to α and lies on β, so it&#39;s not perpendicular to β. Therefore, the statement D is not necessarily true. It depends on the direction of l. So if l is parallel to α, but in a direction that is not along the normal of β, then it won&#39;t be perpendicular to β. Therefore, statement D is false.So summarizing:A: FalseB: TrueC: FalseD: FalseTherefore, only statement B is correct.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Let&#39;s analyze each statement one by one:Statement A: If ( l parallel alpha ) and ( l parallel beta ), then ( alpha parallel beta ).- If two planes intersect, their line of intersection can have a line ( l ) parallel to both planes. Therefore, even if ( l ) is parallel to both planes, the planes might not be parallel. Hence, statement A is false.Statement B: If ( l parallel alpha ) and ( l perp beta ), then ( alpha perp beta ).- If ( l ) is parallel to ( alpha ), then ( l ) is perpendicular to the normal vector of ( alpha ). If ( l ) is perpendicular to ( beta ), then ( l ) is parallel to the normal vector of ( beta ). This implies the normal vectors of ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are perpendicular, making the planes perpendicular. Hence, statement B is true.Statement C: If ( alpha perp beta ) and ( l perp alpha ), then ( l perp beta ).- If ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are perpendicular, their normals are perpendicular. If ( l ) is perpendicular to ( alpha ), ( l ) is parallel to the normal of ( alpha ). However, this does not necessarily mean ( l ) is perpendicular to ( beta ). For example, if ( alpha ) is the x-y plane and ( beta ) is the y-z plane, a line along the z-axis (perpendicular to ( alpha )) lies on ( beta ), not perpendicular. Hence, statement C is false.Statement D: If ( alpha perp beta ) and ( l parallel alpha ), then ( l perp beta ).- If ( l ) is parallel to ( alpha ), it might not be perpendicular to ( beta ). For example, a line along the y-axis (parallel to the x-y plane) lies on the y-z plane (β), not perpendicular. Hence, statement D is false.

So the problem is about a teacher at a math camp who has shirts, pants, shoes, and two jackets. Every lesson, he wears pants, a shirt, shoes, and sometimes a jacket. The key thing is that on any two lessons, at least one item of clothing is different. So, no two lessons can have the exact same combination of all four items. Then, it says that if he had one more shirt, he could do 36 more lessons; one more pair of pants would allow 72 more lessons; and one more pair of shoes would allow 54 more lessons. We need to find the maximum number of lessons he could conduct with the original number of shirts, pants, and shoes.Hmm. Let me break this down. Let&#39;s denote the number of shirts as S, pants as P, shoes as Sh, and jackets as J. We know J is fixed at 2. The total number of possible outfits without considering jackets would be S * P * Sh. But since he can choose to wear a jacket or not, each outfit can have two variations: with jacket or without. So the total number of distinct outfits would be 2 * S * P * Sh. But wait, the problem says that on any two lessons, at least one item is different. So that includes the jacket. So each lesson&#39;s outfit is unique in at least one of shirt, pants, shoes, or jacket (whether he wore it or not). So the total number of possible unique outfits is indeed 2 * S * P * Sh. Therefore, the maximum number of lessons he can conduct is 2 * S * P * Sh.But then, the problem says that adding one more shirt allows 36 more lessons. So if he had S + 1 shirts, then the maximum number of lessons would be 2 * (S + 1) * P * Sh. The difference between this and the original is 2 * (S + 1) * P * Sh - 2 * S * P * Sh = 2 * P * Sh = 36. Similarly, adding one more pair of pants gives 72 more lessons, so 2 * S * (P + 1) * Sh - 2 * S * P * Sh = 2 * S * Sh = 72. And adding one more pair of shoes gives 54 more lessons: 2 * S * P * (Sh + 1) - 2 * S * P * Sh = 2 * S * P = 54.So we have three equations:1) 2 * P * Sh = 36  2) 2 * S * Sh = 72  3) 2 * S * P = 54So, from equation 1: P * Sh = 18  From equation 2: S * Sh = 36  From equation 3: S * P = 27We need to find S, P, Sh. Let&#39;s see.Let me write the three equations:1. P * Sh = 18  2. S * Sh = 36  3. S * P = 27  So, we have three equations with three variables. Let&#39;s solve for S, P, Sh.From equation 1: P = 18 / Sh  From equation 2: S = 36 / Sh  From equation 3: S * P = 27  Substitute S and P from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3:(36 / Sh) * (18 / Sh) = 27  So, (36 * 18) / (Sh^2) = 27  Compute 36 * 18: 36*10=360, 36*8=288, so 360 + 288 = 648  So 648 / Sh^2 = 27  Then, Sh^2 = 648 / 27 = 24  Wait, 648 divided by 27: 27*24=648, yes.  So Sh^2 = 24  Thus, Sh = sqrt(24) ≈ 4.898... Hmm, but the number of shoes should be an integer. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Did I do something wrong?Wait, maybe the equations are set up incorrectly. Let me check again.Original maximum number of lessons is 2*S*P*Sh. Adding one more shirt gives 2*(S+1)*P*Sh. The difference is 2*P*Sh*(S+1 - S) = 2*P*Sh. But the problem says 36 more lessons. So 2*P*Sh = 36. So equation 1 is correct. Similarly for the others.But then, solving these equations gives Sh^2 = 24, which is not an integer. That seems contradictory. But the problem says he has &quot;several pairs of shoes&quot;, which implies integers. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the total number of possible combinations, but something else. Let me re-read the problem.&quot;At each lesson, he wore pants, a shirt, and shoes, and he wore a jacket on some lessons. On any two lessons, at least one of the items of his clothing or shoes was different. It is known that if he had taken one more shirt, he could have conducted 36 more lessons; if he had taken one more pair of pants, he could have conducted 72 more lessons; if he had taken one more pair of shoes, he could have conducted 54 more lessons. What is the maximum number of lessons he could conduct under these conditions?&quot;Wait, so &quot;at least one of the items of his clothing or shoes was different&quot;. That means that for each pair of lessons, they differ in at least one of shirt, pants, shoes, or jacket. So the jacket is considered as an item. So the total number of possible combinations is 2 * S * P * Sh, as each combination can be with or without jacket. So if you have S shirts, P pants, Sh shoes, and 2 jackets (i.e., 2 choices: wear or not wear a jacket), then the total number is 2*S*P*Sh. So the maximum number of lessons is 2*S*P*Sh. Therefore, adding one more shirt would make it 2*(S+1)*P*Sh, so the difference is 2*P*Sh = 36. Similarly, adding pants gives 2*S*Sh =72, and adding shoes gives 2*S*P =54. So the equations are correct.But then solving gives Sh = sqrt(24) which is not integer. So maybe the problem is that the jacket counts as an item, but he can only wear one jacket, and he has two jackets. Wait, the problem says &quot;two jackets&quot;. So he has two jackets, but when he wears a jacket, he can choose either of the two? Wait, the problem says &quot;he wore a jacket on some lessons&quot;. So does that mean he can choose to wear one of the two jackets or not wear a jacket? Then the number of jacket options is 3: no jacket, jacket 1, jacket 2. But the problem says &quot;he wore a jacket on some lessons&quot;, so on some lessons he wears a jacket (either one) and on others he doesn&#39;t. But the problem says &quot;on any two lessons, at least one of the items of his clothing or shoes was different&quot;. So if he wears different jackets, that counts as different items. Therefore, if he has two jackets, then the total number of jacket options is 3: no jacket, jacket A, jacket B. Therefore, the total number of combinations is 3 * S * P * Sh. Wait, but the problem says &quot;two jackets&quot;, so maybe he can wear either 0 or 1 jacket, but he has two jackets, so if he decides to wear a jacket, he can pick one of two. Therefore, the number of jacket options is 1 (no jacket) + 2 (jacket 1 or 2) = 3. So the total combinations would be 3 * S * P * Sh. But then the problem states &quot;if he had taken one more shirt, he could have conducted 36 more lessons&quot;. So the difference would be 3*(S+1)*P*Sh - 3*S*P*Sh = 3*P*Sh =36. Similarly for the others. Then the equations would be:1) 3*P*Sh =36  2) 3*S*Sh =72  3) 3*S*P=54Then dividing by 3:1) P*Sh=12  2) S*Sh=24  3) S*P=18Then multiplying all three equations: (P*Sh)*(S*Sh)*(S*P)=12*24*18  Left side: S^2 * P^2 * Sh^2  Right side: 12*24*18. Let&#39;s compute that. 12*24=288; 288*18=5184.  So S^2 * P^2 * Sh^2=5184  Taking square root: S*P*Sh=72  Then the total number of lessons would be 3*S*P*Sh=3*72=216. Then adding 3*(S+1)*P*Sh - 3*S*P*Sh=3*P*Sh=36. So if S*P*Sh=72, then 3*72=216. Then the original total is 216, and adding a shirt would give 216 + 36=252, which is 3*(S+1)*P*Sh. Similarly for the others.But let&#39;s check if S, P, Sh are integers. From the equations:From equation 1: P*Sh=12  From equation 2: S*Sh=24  From equation 3: S*P=18  Let me solve for S, P, Sh.From equation 1: P=12/Sh  From equation 2: S=24/Sh  From equation 3: (24/Sh)*(12/Sh)=18  So 288 / Sh² =18  Sh²=288/18=16  Thus Sh=4  Then P=12/4=3  S=24/4=6  So S=6, P=3, Sh=4. Then S*P*Sh=6*3*4=72. Then total lessons would be 3*72=216. Then adding one shirt: 3*(7)*3*4=252, difference is 36. Adding one pants: 3*6*4*4=288, difference is 72. Adding one shoe: 3*6*3*5=270, difference is 54. Perfect, so all differences match the problem&#39;s statements.But wait, the problem says &quot;two jackets&quot;. So if he has two jackets, then the number of jacket options is 3: no jacket, jacket 1, jacket 2. Therefore, the total combinations would indeed be 3*S*P*Sh. So that seems to resolve the non-integer issue. So the original answer is 216.But the problem says &quot;he took with him for the whole summer... two jackets&quot;. So he has two jackets, but when he wears a jacket, he can choose either one. Therefore, the number of jacket options is 3. So the total combinations would be 3*S*P*Sh. Therefore, the equations are set correctly as above. Therefore, the answer is 216. But let me confirm.Wait, in the original problem statement, it says &quot;a jacket on some lessons&quot;. So he can wear a jacket or not, but he has two jackets. So if he decides to wear a jacket, he has two choices. So that&#39;s two options when wearing a jacket, and one option when not. So total jacket options: 1 (no jacket) + 2 (jacket 1 or 2) = 3. Therefore, the total number of outfits is 3*S*P*Sh. So the initial maximum number of lessons is 3*S*P*Sh. Then, if he adds one more shirt, it&#39;s 3*(S+1)*P*Sh. The difference is 3*P*Sh=36. Similarly for the others. Then solving gives S=6, P=3, Sh=4, total lessons 216. So that seems to make sense.But wait, the problem didn&#39;t mention that jackets can be different. Wait, it says he took two jackets. So maybe he can wear either of the two jackets, so the jacket is considered an item. So if he wears a jacket, it&#39;s one of the two, and if he doesn&#39;t, then no jacket. So each jacket is a separate item. Therefore, the number of different jacket options is 3: no jacket, jacket 1, jacket 2. Therefore, each lesson&#39;s outfit is a combination of shirt, pants, shoes, and jacket (which can be none, 1, or 2). So the total number is indeed 3*S*P*Sh. Therefore, the equations are correct. Then solving gives 216.But in the initial problem statement, it says &quot;if he had taken one more shirt, he could have conducted 36 more lessons&quot;. So with S+1 shirts, the total lessons would be 216 + 36=252. Let&#39;s check: 3*(6+1)*3*4=3*7*3*4=252, which is correct. Similarly for the others. So this seems consistent.But wait, the problem says &quot;at least one of the items of his clothing or shoes was different&quot;. So even if he changes only the jacket, that counts as a different outfit. So two outfits that are the same except for the jacket are considered different. So the jacket is indeed an item that can differentiate the outfits. Therefore, the total number is 3*S*P*Sh. So original total lessons is 216, which is the answer.But let me verify once more. Let&#39;s compute S, P, Sh.From equations:1. 3*P*Sh =36 → P*Sh=12  2. 3*S*Sh=72 → S*Sh=24  3. 3*S*P=54 → S*P=18  From 1: P=12/Sh  From 2: S=24/Sh  From 3: (24/Sh)*(12/Sh)=18 → 288/Sh²=18 → Sh²=16 → Sh=4  Thus, Sh=4, then P=12/4=3, S=24/4=6  Therefore, S=6, P=3, Sh=4. Then total lessons is 3*6*3*4=216.Yes, this all checks out. So the answer is 216. Therefore, the maximum number of lessons he could conduct is 216.Final Answerboxed{216}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of lessons the teacher could conduct under the given conditions. The teacher wears a combination of shirts, pants, shoes, and sometimes a jacket (choosing between two jackets or none), such that each lesson&#39;s outfit differs by at least one item. We denote the number of shirts as ( S ), pants as ( P ), shoes as ( Sh ), and jackets as ( J ). Since the teacher has two jackets, the number of jacket options is 3 (no jacket, jacket 1, jacket 2). Therefore, the total number of distinct outfits is ( 3 times S times P times Sh ).The problem states that adding one more shirt, pair of pants, or pair of shoes would allow 36, 72, and 54 more lessons respectively. This gives us the following equations:1. Adding one more shirt: ( 3 times (S + 1) times P times Sh - 3 times S times P times Sh = 36 ) which simplifies to ( 3 times P times Sh = 36 ) or ( P times Sh = 12 ).2. Adding one more pair of pants: ( 3 times S times (P + 1) times Sh - 3 times S times P times Sh = 72 ) which simplifies to ( 3 times S times Sh = 72 ) or ( S times Sh = 24 ).3. Adding one more pair of shoes: ( 3 times S times P times (Sh + 1) - 3 times S times P times Sh = 54 ) which simplifies to ( 3 times S times P = 54 ) or ( S times P = 18 ).We solve these equations step-by-step:1. From ( P times Sh = 12 ), we express ( P ) as ( P = frac{12}{Sh} ).2. From ( S times Sh = 24 ), we express ( S ) as ( S = frac{24}{Sh} ).3. Substituting ( P ) and ( S ) into ( S times P = 18 ), we get:   [   left( frac{24}{Sh} right) times left( frac{12}{Sh} right) = 18   ]   Simplifying, we find:   [   frac{288}{Sh^2} = 18 implies Sh^2 = 16 implies Sh = 4   ]Substituting ( Sh = 4 ) back, we get ( P = frac{12}{4} = 3 ) and ( S = frac{24}{4} = 6 ).Thus, the original number of shirts ( S = 6 ), pants ( P = 3 ), and shoes ( Sh = 4 ). The maximum number of lessons is calculated as:[3 times S times P times Sh = 3 times 6 times 3 times 4 = 216]Therefore, the maximum number of lessons the teacher could conduct is (boxed{216}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the teacher has shirts, pants, shoes, and two jackets. Each lesson, he wears pants, a shirt, shoes, and maybe a jacket. The key thing is that on any two lessons, at least one item is different. So, no two outfits can be exactly the same in all components. They tell us that if he had one more shirt, he could have 36 more lessons. Similarly, one more pair of pants would give 72 more lessons, and one more pair of shoes would give 54 more lessons. We need to find the maximum number of lessons he can conduct with his original number of shirts, pants, shoes, and two jackets.Let me start by assigning variables. Let&#39;s say he has S shirts, P pairs of pants, Sh pairs of shoes, and 2 jackets. Each lesson, he wears one shirt, one pair of pants, one pair of shoes, and either a jacket or not. Wait, but the problem says he wore a jacket on some lessons. So maybe he can choose to wear a jacket or not? But he only has two jackets. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, so does the jacket count as part of the outfit? So, if he wears a jacket, it has to be one of the two. If he doesn&#39;t wear a jacket, then that&#39;s another possibility. So the jacket component can be in three states: no jacket, jacket 1, or jacket 2. Wait, but the problem states he has two jackets. So maybe the jacket is an optional item. So for each lesson, he can choose to wear 0 jackets or 1 jacket (but he only has two jackets). Wait, no, actually, he has two jackets. So perhaps each jacket counts as a separate item. So, he can wear jacket A, jacket B, or no jacket. So that&#39;s three possibilities for jackets. But the problem says he wore a jacket on some lessons. So, on some days he wore one of the two jackets, and on others, he didn&#39;t. So the jacket is an optional item. So, the total number of possible outfits would be shirts × pants × shoes × (jackets + 1). Wait, because he can choose to wear no jacket or one of the two jackets. So that&#39;s 3 choices. Therefore, the total possible outfits are S * P * Sh * 3. But the problem states that on any two lessons, at least one of the items is different. So, each outfit must be unique in at least one component. Therefore, the maximum number of lessons he can conduct is equal to the total number of unique outfits he can create, given that each outfit differs in at least one component. So, that would be S * P * Sh * 3, right? Because each combination of shirt, pants, shoes, and jacket (including no jacket) is unique. But maybe that&#39;s not exactly right. Wait, if the jackets are considered as separate items, but he can only wear one jacket at a time or none. So, if he has two jackets, then the jacket component can take three values: jacket 1, jacket 2, or no jacket. So that&#39;s 3 possibilities. Therefore, the total number of unique outfits is S * P * Sh * 3. But the problem says that on any two lessons, at least one item is different. So, as long as he changes at least one item, the outfits are different. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is indeed S * P * Sh * 3. But then, the problem gives us information about adding one more shirt, pants, or shoes and how many more lessons he could conduct. So, if he had S + 1 shirts, then the number of lessons would be (S + 1) * P * Sh * 3, and this is 36 more than the original number. Similarly for pants and shoes. Therefore, we can set up equations.Let me define N as the original number of lessons. So,N = S * P * Sh * 3.If he had one more shirt, then the number of lessons would be (S + 1) * P * Sh * 3 = N + 36.Similarly, one more pair of pants:S * (P + 1) * Sh * 3 = N + 72.One more pair of shoes:S * P * (Sh + 1) * 3 = N + 54.So, we have three equations:1) (S + 1) * P * Sh * 3 = N + 362) S * (P + 1) * Sh * 3 = N + 723) S * P * (Sh + 1) * 3 = N + 54And we know that N = S * P * Sh * 3.So, substituting N into each equation:1) (S + 1) * P * Sh * 3 = S * P * Sh * 3 + 36Simplify left side: S * P * Sh * 3 + P * Sh * 3 = N + 36Therefore, P * Sh * 3 = 36 =&gt; P * Sh = 12Similarly, for the second equation:2) S * (P + 1) * Sh * 3 = S * P * Sh * 3 + 72Left side: S * P * Sh * 3 + S * Sh * 3 = N + 72Thus, S * Sh * 3 = 72 =&gt; S * Sh = 24Third equation:3) S * P * (Sh + 1) * 3 = S * P * Sh * 3 + 54Left side: S * P * Sh * 3 + S * P * 3 = N + 54Thus, S * P * 3 = 54 =&gt; S * P = 18So, now we have three equations:a) P * Sh = 12b) S * Sh = 24c) S * P = 18We need to solve for S, P, Sh.Let me note that equations a, b, c are:Multiply all three equations: (P * Sh) * (S * Sh) * (S * P) = 12 * 24 * 18Left side: (S^2 * P^2 * Sh^2) = (S * P * Sh)^2 = 12 * 24 * 18Compute right side: 12 * 24 = 288; 288 * 18 = 5184Therefore, (S * P * Sh)^2 = 5184 =&gt; S * P * Sh = sqrt(5184) = 72Therefore, S * P * Sh = 72.But then, N = S * P * Sh * 3 = 72 * 3 = 216.Wait, but let me check if that&#39;s correct.So, S * P * Sh = 72, so N = 72 * 3 = 216.But let&#39;s check with the equations.From equation a: P * Sh = 12From equation b: S * Sh = 24From equation c: S * P = 18So, we can solve for S, P, Sh.From equation c: S = 18 / PFrom equation b: (18 / P) * Sh = 24 =&gt; Sh = (24 * P) / 18 = (4 / 3) PFrom equation a: P * Sh = 12 =&gt; P * (4/3) P = 12 =&gt; (4/3) P^2 = 12 =&gt; P^2 = 12 * (3/4) = 9 =&gt; P = 3Therefore, P = 3Then, from equation c: S = 18 / 3 = 6From equation a: Sh = 12 / 3 = 4Check equation b: S * Sh = 6 * 4 = 24. Correct.So, S = 6, P = 3, Sh = 4.Therefore, original number of lessons N = 6 * 3 * 4 * 3 = 216.Wait, but let&#39;s check if this is the maximum number of lessons. The problem says that on any two lessons, at least one of the items was different. So, since each combination is unique in at least one component, the total number is indeed S*P*Sh*3, which is 216. But let&#39;s verify the increments:If he had one more shirt, then S becomes 7. So, 7 * 3 * 4 * 3 = 252. 252 - 216 = 36. Correct.If he had one more pair of pants, P becomes 4. 6 * 4 * 4 * 3 = 288. 288 - 216 = 72. Correct.If he had one more pair of shoes, Sh becomes 5. 6 * 3 * 5 * 3 = 270. 270 - 216 = 54. Correct.Therefore, all the conditions are satisfied. So, the maximum number of lessons is 216.But wait, the problem mentions &quot;the maximum number of lessons he could conduct under these conditions&quot;. So, since the original number is 216, which is equal to S*P*Sh*3, and with the given equations, that&#39;s the answer. But let me just think again: the teacher has two jackets. So, when calculating the total outfits, it&#39;s shirts × pants × shoes × (jackets + 1). Wait, jackets are two, so it&#39;s shirts × pants × shoes × 3. Because he can choose to wear no jacket, jacket 1, or jacket 2. So, 3 choices. Therefore, the total possible unique outfits are S*P*Sh*3, which is 6*3*4*3=216. Each outfit is unique in at least one component, so each lesson he can wear a different outfit, and the total number is 216. Therefore, that&#39;s the maximum. So, the answer should be 216.But let me check once more to see if there&#39;s any detail I missed. The problem says &quot;if he had taken one more shirt, he could have conducted 36 more lessons&quot;. So, adding one shirt adds 36 lessons, which in our case is correct because (S+1)*P*Sh*3 - S*P*Sh*3 = P*Sh*3 = 3*4*3=36. Wait, no: P is 3, Sh is 4, so 3*4*3=36. Wait, but 3*4=12, 12*3=36. Correct. Similarly, adding pants: S*Sh*3=6*4*3=72. Correct. Adding shoes: S*P*3=6*3*3=54. Correct. So all the differences check out.Therefore, the answer is 216.Final Answerboxed{216}&lt;/think&gt;Let ( S ) be the number of shirts, ( P ) be the number of pairs of pants, ( Sh ) be the number of pairs of shoes, and 2 jackets. The teacher can wear a jacket or not, giving 3 choices (no jacket, jacket 1, jacket 2). The total number of unique outfits is ( S times P times Sh times 3 ).Given the conditions:1. If he had one more shirt, he could conduct 36 more lessons.2. If he had one more pair of pants, he could conduct 72 more lessons.3. If he had one more pair of shoes, he could conduct 54 more lessons.We set up the equations for the original number of lessons ( N ):[ N = S times P times Sh times 3 ]For the additional lessons:1. ((S + 1) times P times Sh times 3 = N + 36)2. ( S times (P + 1) times Sh times 3 = N + 72)3. ( S times P times (Sh + 1) times 3 = N + 54)Substituting ( N ) into each equation:1. ( P times Sh times 3 = 36 ) ⟹ ( P times Sh = 12 )2. ( S times Sh times 3 = 72 ) ⟹ ( S times Sh = 24 )3. ( S times P times 3 = 54 ) ⟹ ( S times P = 18 )Multiplying these three equations:[ (P times Sh) times (S times Sh) times (S times P) = 12 times 24 times 18 ][ (S times P times Sh)^2 = 5184 ][ S times P times Sh = 72 ]Thus, the original number of lessons ( N ) is:[ N = 72 times 3 = 216 ]Verifying the values:- ( S = 6 ), ( P = 3 ), ( Sh = 4 )- ( S times P times Sh times 3 = 6 times 3 times 4 times 3 = 216 )The maximum number of lessons he could conduct is (boxed{216}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a9560956></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a9560956><span class="icon" data-v-a9560956>🔑:</span>Answer: 216.Note.
