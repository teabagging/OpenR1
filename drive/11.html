Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding what&#39;s given here.First, the equation a² = b² + c² - bc. Normally, in the Law of Cosines, we have a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. Comparing this to the given equation, it seems like 2 cos A must be equal to 1, right? Because the given equation is similar but instead of -2bc cos A, we have -bc. So that would imply 2 cos A = 1, so cos A = 1/2, which means angle A is 60 degrees. So angle A is 60 degrees. That&#39;s a useful piece of information.Now, the problem is to find the maximum perimeter when a = 2. Perimeter is a + b + c = 2 + b + c. So we need to maximize b + c. Therefore, if I can find the maximum value of b + c given that angle A is 60 degrees and side a is 2, that should solve the problem.So, how can I express b + c in terms of other variables or use some trigonometric identities? Since we know angle A and side a, maybe we can use the Law of Sines. Let&#39;s recall that Law of Sines states that a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle.Given that angle A is 60 degrees and a = 2, let&#39;s compute 2R. 2R = a / sin A = 2 / sin 60°. Sin 60° is √3/2, so 2R = 2 / (√3/2) = 4 / √3. Therefore, R = 2 / √3.Therefore, b = 2R sin B = (4 / √3) sin B, and c = 2R sin C = (4 / √3) sin C. So, b + c = (4 / √3)(sin B + sin C). So we need to maximize sin B + sin C.But in a triangle, angles B and C are related because angles A + B + C = 180°, so B + C = 120°, since angle A is 60°. Let me denote angle B as x, so angle C = 120° - x. Therefore, sin B + sin C = sin x + sin (120° - x). Let&#39;s compute this expression.Using the sine addition formula, sin(120° - x) = sin 120° cos x - cos 120° sin x. Sin 120° is √3/2, cos 120° is -1/2. So, sin(120° - x) = (√3/2) cos x - (-1/2) sin x = (√3/2) cos x + (1/2) sin x. Therefore, sin x + sin(120° - x) = sin x + (√3/2) cos x + (1/2) sin x = (3/2) sin x + (√3/2) cos x.So sin B + sin C = (3/2) sin x + (√3/2) cos x. Let me denote this as a function f(x) = (3/2) sin x + (√3/2) cos x. We need to find the maximum value of f(x). To find the maximum of this function, we can write it in the form R sin(x + φ), where R is the amplitude.Alternatively, we can use calculus. Let&#39;s try both methods. First, using the amplitude method. The expression (3/2) sin x + (√3/2) cos x can be written as A sin x + B cos x, where A = 3/2 and B = √3/2. The maximum value of this is √(A² + B²) = √((9/4) + (3/4)) = √(12/4) = √3. So the maximum value of f(x) is √3. Therefore, the maximum of sin B + sin C is √3, so the maximum of b + c is (4 / √3) * √3 = 4. Therefore, the maximum perimeter is 2 + 4 = 6.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify with calculus to make sure.Let’s take f(x) = (3/2) sin x + (√3/2) cos x. Take the derivative f’(x) = (3/2) cos x - (√3/2) sin x. Set derivative to zero:(3/2) cos x - (√3/2) sin x = 0Multiply both sides by 2:3 cos x - √3 sin x = 0Divide both sides by cos x (assuming cos x ≠ 0):3 - √3 tan x = 0 =&gt; tan x = 3 / √3 = √3 =&gt; x = 60°.Therefore, critical point at x = 60°, then angle C = 120° - 60° = 60°. So triangle would be equilateral? Wait, but if angle A is 60°, and angles B and C are also 60°, then yes, all angles 60°, so all sides equal. But in our problem, a = 2, so if the triangle is equilateral, all sides are 2. Then perimeter would be 6, which matches the previous result.But wait, hold on. If the maximum occurs when the triangle is equilateral, but according to the given equation a² = b² + c² - bc, if a = 2, then 4 = b² + c² - bc. If the triangle is equilateral, then b = c = 2, so 4 = 4 + 4 - 4 = 4. So that works. So the maximum perimeter is indeed 6.But wait, let me check another case. Suppose angle B approaches 0°, then angle C approaches 120°, so sin B approaches 0 and sin C approaches sin 120° = √3/2. Then b approaches 0 and c approaches (4 / √3)(√3/2) = (4 / √3)(√3/2) = 2. So in that case, perimeter approaches 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, which is less than 6. Similarly, if angle B approaches 120°, angle C approaches 0°, same thing. So the perimeter is maximized when angles B and C are both 60°, making the triangle equilateral. So the maximum perimeter is 6.But wait, is there a different triangle where b + c could be larger? For example, if the triangle is isoceles but not equilateral. Let me check. Suppose angle B = angle C = 60°, which is equilateral. If angle B is something else, say angle B = 90°, then angle C = 30°. Let&#39;s compute sides.Using Law of Sines: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. So 2 / sin 60° = b / sin 90° = c / sin 30°. Sin 60° = √3/2, so 2 / (√3/2) = 4 / √3. Therefore, b = (4 / √3) * sin 90° = 4 / √3 * 1 = 4 / √3 ≈ 2.309. c = (4 / √3) * sin 30° = 4 / √3 * 1/2 = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.154. So perimeter is 2 + 4/√3 + 2/√3 ≈ 2 + 6/√3 ≈ 2 + 3.464 ≈ 5.464, which is less than 6. So indeed, perimeter is smaller here.Alternatively, if angle B is 30°, angle C is 90°, then similarly, b = 4 / √3 * sin 30° = 4 / √3 * 1/2 = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.154, c = 4 / √3 * sin 90° = 4 / √3 ≈ 2.309. Perimeter is same as above, ≈5.464.Alternatively, take angle B = 45°, angle C = 75°. Then sin B = sin 45° = √2/2 ≈0.707, sin C = sin 75° ≈0.9659. Then b + c = (4 / √3)(√2/2 + 0.9659) ≈ (4 / 1.732)(0.707 + 0.966) ≈(2.309)(1.673)≈3.86. Then perimeter ≈2 + 3.86≈5.86, which is still less than 6.Therefore, seems like maximum occurs at equilateral triangle. Hence, perimeter 6.Alternatively, maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers with the constraint a² = b² + c² - bc and a=2, to maximize b + c.Let’s set up the problem. We need to maximize b + c, given that 4 = b² + c² - bc. Let’s use Lagrangian. Let’s set up the function to maximize: f(b,c) = b + c. The constraint is g(b,c) = b² + c² - bc -4 =0.The Lagrangian is L = b + c - λ(b² + c² - bc -4). Take partial derivatives:∂L/∂b = 1 - λ(2b - c) =0∂L/∂c = 1 - λ(2c - b) =0∂L/∂λ = -(b² + c² - bc -4) =0So we have:1 = λ(2b - c)  ...(1)1 = λ(2c - b)  ...(2)And the constraint equation: b² + c² - bc =4 ...(3)From equations (1) and (2), set λ equal. So from (1): λ = 1/(2b - c); from (2): λ = 1/(2c - b). Therefore, 1/(2b - c) = 1/(2c - b). Therefore, 2b - c = 2c - b. Rearranging: 2b + b = 2c + c =&gt; 3b = 3c =&gt; b = c.So when b = c, the maximum occurs. Then substitute back into constraint equation: b² + b² - b*b =4 =&gt; 2b² - b² =4 =&gt; b²=4 =&gt; b=2. So since b=2, c=2. Then perimeter is 2 + 2 + 2=6. So same result. Thus, maximum perimeter is 6.Therefore, the answer is 6.Final Answerboxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;Given triangle (triangle ABC) with sides opposite to angles (A), (B), and (C) being (a), (b), and (c) respectively, we know (a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc) and (a = 2). We need to find the maximum value of the perimeter of (triangle ABC).First, we recognize that the given equation (a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc) implies the use of the Law of Cosines. Comparing this to the standard form (a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A), we find that (2 cos A = 1), leading to (cos A = frac{1}{2}) and thus (A = 60^circ).Next, we use the Law of Sines. Since (a = 2) and (A = 60^circ), the circumradius (R) is calculated as:[2R = frac{a}{sin A} = frac{2}{sin 60^circ} = frac{2}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{4}{sqrt{3}}]Thus, (R = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}).Expressing (b) and (c) in terms of angles (B) and (C):[b = 2R sin B = frac{4}{sqrt{3}} sin B, quad c = 2R sin C = frac{4}{sqrt{3}} sin C]Since (A + B + C = 180^circ) and (A = 60^circ), we have (B + C = 120^circ). Let (B = x) and (C = 120^circ - x). We need to maximize:[sin B + sin C = sin x + sin (120^circ - x)]Using trigonometric identities, we find:[sin (120^circ - x) = sin 120^circ cos x - cos 120^circ sin x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos x + frac{1}{2} sin x]Thus,[sin x + sin (120^circ - x) = sin x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos x + frac{1}{2} sin x = frac{3}{2} sin x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos x]The maximum value of this expression is (sqrt{left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{3}). Therefore, the maximum value of (b + c) is:[frac{4}{sqrt{3}} times sqrt{3} = 4]Adding (a = 2), the maximum perimeter is:[2 + 4 = 6]Using Lagrange multipliers confirms this result. Maximizing (b + c) under the constraint (b^2 + c^2 - bc = 4) leads to (b = c = 2), giving the perimeter (2 + 2 + 2 = 6).Thus, the maximum value of the perimeter of (triangle ABC) is (boxed{6}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the maximum perimeter of triangle ABC given that a² = b² + c² - bc and a = 2. Hmm, let me start by recalling some triangle properties and theorems that might help here. The given equation looks a bit like the Law of Cosines. Let me check that. The Law of Cosines states that a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. Comparing this to the given equation a² = b² + c² - bc, it seems similar but instead of -2bc cos A, we have -bc. So, setting those equal: -2bc cos A = -bc. That simplifies to 2 cos A = 1, so cos A = 1/2. Therefore, angle A must be 60 degrees because that&#39;s where cosine is 1/2. So angle A is 60°, which makes this triangle a bit special, maybe even equilateral? Wait, but in an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60°, and all sides are equal. But here, a is given as 2, so if it were equilateral, all sides would be 2. But the perimeter would be 6. However, maybe the maximum perimeter is larger than that? Hmm, perhaps the triangle isn&#39;t required to be equilateral, but just has angle A equal to 60°. So I need to maximize the perimeter, which is a + b + c = 2 + b + c. Therefore, to maximize the perimeter, I need to maximize b + c given the constraint a² = b² + c² - bc with a = 2. So substituting a = 2 into the equation: 4 = b² + c² - bc. So I need to maximize b + c under the condition that b² + c² - bc = 4. Hmm, this is an optimization problem with a constraint. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since this is a triangle, there might also be geometric interpretations. Alternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some algebraic manipulation. Let me try to express this in terms of variables. Let me set variables x = b and y = c. Then the constraint is x² + y² - xy = 4. I need to maximize x + y. Let me consider this as a quadratic equation. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. For example, solve for y in terms of x. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can consider x + y = k, and find the maximum k such that x² + y² - xy = 4. Let me try substituting y = k - x into the equation. Then: x² + (k - x)² - x(k - x) = 4. Expanding this: x² + k² - 2kx + x² - kx + x² = 4. Wait, let me check that again. Let&#39;s do it step by step. y = k - x, so substitute into the constraint: x² + y² - x y = x² + (k - x)² - x(k - x) First, expand (k - x)²: k² - 2k x + x² Then expand x(k - x): k x - x² So putting it all together: x² + (k² - 2k x + x²) - (k x - x²) = x² + k² - 2k x + x² - k x + x² = 3x² - 3k x + k². Therefore, the equation becomes 3x² - 3k x + k² = 4. Now, this is a quadratic equation in x. For real solutions to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant D is [(-3k)^2 - 4*3*(k² - 4)] = 9k² - 12(k² - 4) = 9k² - 12k² + 48 = -3k² + 48. For real solutions, D ≥ 0: -3k² + 48 ≥ 0 → 3k² ≤ 48 → k² ≤ 16 → |k| ≤ 4. Therefore, the maximum possible value of k = x + y is 4. So the maximum perimeter would be 2 + 4 = 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. So if the maximum value of b + c is 4, then the perimeter is 6. But in an equilateral triangle with sides 2, the perimeter is 6. So does that mean the maximum perimeter is 6? But the problem states &quot;the maximum value of the perimeter&quot;. Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, but if angle A is 60°, and sides b and c can vary such that a² = b² + c² - bc, then when does b + c reach its maximum? According to the above calculation, when k = 4. Let me check with specific values. Suppose b = c. Then the equation becomes 4 = b² + b² - b² = b². So b² = 4 → b = 2. Therefore, if b = c = 2, then the triangle is equilateral with sides 2, 2, 2, perimeter 6. That fits. But is there a case where b + c is larger? For example, if b is larger than 2, and c is smaller, but still satisfying the equation. Let&#39;s pick b = 3. Then the equation is 4 = 9 + c² - 3c. So c² - 3c + 5 = 0. The discriminant is 9 - 20 = -11, which is negative. So no real solution. What if b = 4? Then 4 = 16 + c² - 4c → c² -4c +12 =0. Discriminant 16 - 48 = -32, still no solution. So maybe when b + c is 4, that&#39;s the maximum. Wait, but when I considered b + c = 4, substituting into the equation, we have 3x² - 12x + 16 = 4. Wait, let&#39;s check that again. If k = 4, then the quadratic equation becomes 3x² - 12x + 16 = 4 → 3x² -12x +12 =0 → x² -4x +4 =0 → (x -2)^2=0 → x=2. So y=4 -2=2. So the only solution is b=2, c=2. So in that case, the triangle is equilateral. So maybe that is indeed the maximum. But wait, what if we take another approach. Let&#39;s parametrize the problem. Since angle A is 60°, maybe using the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C. Since angle A is 60°, a =2, so 2 / sin 60° = 2 / (√3/2) = 4 / √3. Therefore, b = (4 / √3) sin B, c = (4 / √3) sin C. Since in a triangle, angles B + C = 120°, so C = 120° - B. Therefore, perimeter P = a + b + c = 2 + (4 / √3)(sin B + sin C) = 2 + (4 / √3)[sin B + sin(120° - B)]. Let me simplify sin(120° - B). Using the sine subtraction formula: sin(120° - B) = sin 120° cos B - cos 120° sin B = (√3/2) cos B - (-1/2) sin B = (√3/2) cos B + (1/2) sin B. Therefore, sin B + sin(120° - B) = sin B + (√3/2 cos B + 1/2 sin B) = (3/2) sin B + (√3/2) cos B. Therefore, perimeter P = 2 + (4 / √3)[ (3/2 sin B + √3/2 cos B ) ] = 2 + (4 / √3)( 3/2 sin B + √3/2 cos B ) Let&#39;s compute this term: (4 / √3)( 3/2 sin B + √3/2 cos B ) = 4 / √3 * 3/2 sin B + 4 / √3 * √3/2 cos B = (4*3)/(2√3) sin B + (4*√3)/(2√3) cos B = (12)/(2√3) sin B + (4*√3)/(2√3) cos B Simplify each term: 12/(2√3) = 6/√3 = 2√3 4√3/(2√3) = 4/2 = 2 Therefore, perimeter P = 2 + 2√3 sin B + 2 cos B So P = 2 + 2√3 sin B + 2 cos B Now, we need to maximize P with respect to angle B, where B is between 0° and 120°, since angle A is 60°, and angles B + C = 120°, so each of B and C must be less than 120°, but greater than 0°. Therefore, the perimeter is a function of B: P(B) = 2 + 2√3 sin B + 2 cos B. To find the maximum of P(B), we can take its derivative with respect to B and set it to zero. Alternatively, recognize that 2√3 sin B + 2 cos B is a sinusoidal function and can be written in the form R sin(B + φ), where R is the amplitude. Let me compute R: The amplitude R is sqrt( (2√3)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt( 12 + 4 ) = sqrt(16) = 4. Therefore, 2√3 sin B + 2 cos B = 4 sin(B + φ), where φ is a phase shift. To find φ: tan φ = (2)/(2√3) = 1/√3 → φ = 30° Therefore, the expression becomes 4 sin(B + 30°). Therefore, perimeter P = 2 + 4 sin(B + 30°). The maximum value of sin(B + 30°) is 1, so the maximum perimeter would be 2 + 4*1 = 6. This occurs when sin(B + 30°) = 1 → B + 30° = 90° → B = 60°. Therefore, when B = 60°, then C = 120° - 60° = 60°, so the triangle is equilateral. Therefore, the maximum perimeter is 6. Wait, but this seems to contradict my initial thought that maybe a non-equilateral triangle could give a larger perimeter. But according to both methods, substituting the constraint and using Lagrange multipliers gives maximum b + c = 4, leading to perimeter 6, and using the Law of Sines parametrization gives maximum perimeter 6 when the triangle is equilateral. Therefore, the maximum perimeter is 6. But let me check again. Suppose we take another angle B, say B = 90°, which would make C = 30°. Then, using the Law of Sines: b = (4 / √3) sin 90° = (4 / √3)(1) = 4 / √3 ≈ 2.309 c = (4 / √3) sin 30° = (4 / √3)(0.5) = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.154 Then perimeter would be 2 + 4/√3 + 2/√3 ≈ 2 + 6/√3 ≈ 2 + 3.464 ≈ 5.464, which is less than 6. Alternatively, take B = 30°, so C = 90°. Then b = 4 / √3 * sin 30° = 4 / √3 * 0.5 = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.154 c = 4 / √3 * sin 90° = 4 / √3 ≈ 2.309 Then perimeter is 2 + 2/√3 + 4/√3 ≈ 2 + 6/√3 ≈ 2 + 3.464 ≈ 5.464, same as before. What if B = 0°, which isn&#39;t allowed, but approaching 0°, then C approaches 120°, c approaches (4 / √3) sin 120° = (4 / √3)(√3/2) = 2, and b approaches 0. So perimeter approaches 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, which is much less. Similarly, if B approaches 120°, then C approaches 0°, perimeter approaches 2 + (4 / √3) sin 120° + 0 ≈ 2 + (4 / √3)(√3/2) = 2 + 2 = 4. So indeed, the maximum seems to occur at B = 60°, giving perimeter 6. Therefore, the maximum perimeter is 6. But wait, let me check with another approach. Suppose I use Lagrange multipliers. Let me set f(b, c) = b + c to maximize, subject to the constraint g(b, c) = b² + c² - bc -4 =0. Then the gradients must satisfy ∇f = λ∇g. So partial derivatives: df/db = 1, df/dc = 1. dg/db = 2b - c, dg/dc = 2c - b. Therefore, equations: 1 = λ(2b - c) 1 = λ(2c - b) Therefore, set the two expressions for λ equal: 1 / (2b - c) = 1 / (2c - b) → 2c - b = 2b - c → 2c + c = 2b + b → 3c = 3b → c = b. Therefore, c = b. Substitute into the constraint: b² + b² - b² =4 → b² =4 → b=2. Therefore, c=2. Therefore, the maximum occurs when b=c=2, so perimeter is 2+2+2=6. So this confirms again that the maximum perimeter is 6. Therefore, after multiple approaches—algebraic substitution, trigonometric parametrization, and Lagrange multipliers—all lead to the conclusion that the maximum perimeter is 6 when the triangle is equilateral. So I think the answer is 6. But wait, the problem says &quot;the maximum value of the perimeter&quot;. So is it 6? But let me just consider another thought: sometimes, in optimization problems, especially with trigonometric functions, there might be a higher maximum. But in this case, all methods converge to 6. Let me also consider the triangle inequality. For a triangle with sides a=2, b, c: the sum of any two sides must exceed the third. So b + c &gt; 2, 2 + b &gt; c, and 2 + c &gt; b. Since we are looking to maximize b + c, the main constraint would be b + c &gt; 2, which is automatically satisfied if b + c is being maximized. The other inequalities: 2 + b &gt; c and 2 + c &gt; b. If b + c is maximized as 4 (when b = c = 2), then c = 4 - b. If b increases beyond 2, c must decrease. Let&#39;s say b = 3, c =1, but then 2 +1=3, which is not greater than 3. So that violates the triangle inequality. Therefore, the maximum possible b + c such that triangle inequality holds is when b and c are both 2, giving an equilateral triangle. Therefore, yes, the maximum perimeter is indeed 6. I think that&#39;s solid. So the answer should be boxed{6}.Final Answerboxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;Given triangle ( triangle ABC ) with sides opposite to angles ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) being ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) respectively, we know ( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc ) and ( a = 2 ). We need to find the maximum value of the perimeter.First, we recognize that the given equation ( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc ) resembles the Law of Cosines. Comparing it to the standard form ( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A ), we find ( cos A = frac{1}{2} ), implying ( A = 60^circ ).To maximize the perimeter ( a + b + c = 2 + b + c ), we need to maximize ( b + c ) under the constraint ( 4 = b^2 + c^2 - bc ).Using algebraic substitution, we set ( k = b + c ) and substitute ( y = k - x ) into the constraint equation:[3x^2 - 3kx + k^2 = 4]The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for real solutions:[-3k^2 + 48 geq 0 implies k^2 leq 16 implies k leq 4]Thus, the maximum value of ( b + c ) is 4, leading to a perimeter of ( 2 + 4 = 6 ).Using trigonometric parametrization, we apply the Law of Sines and express the perimeter in terms of angles ( B ) and ( C ). This approach confirms that the maximum perimeter occurs when ( B = 60^circ ) and ( C = 60^circ ), resulting in an equilateral triangle with all sides equal to 2.Finally, using Lagrange multipliers, we verify that the maximum occurs when ( b = c = 2 ), leading to the same conclusion.Thus, the maximum value of the perimeter of ( triangle ABC ) is (boxed{6}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e1a50256></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>🔑:</span>Let&#39;s start by analyzing the given equation in the context of triangle triangle ABC, where a^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2} - bc and a = 2. Our goal is to determine the maximum value of the perimeter of this triangle.1. Given Equation Transformation: The given equation a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-bc can be rearranged to represent the cosine rule. Specifically, we can express it as:   [   b^{2} + c^{2} - a^{2} = bc   ]   This modification prepares us for applying the cosine rule by aligning the equation&#39;s form with the rule&#39;s structure.2. Application of Cosine Rule: By the cosine rule, we know that cos A = frac{b^{2} + c^{2} - a^{2}}{2bc}. Substituting the rearranged given equation into this formula leads to:   [   cos A = frac{bc}{2bc} = frac{1}{2}   ]   Given that angle A must be in the interval (0, pi) (because it is an internal angle of a triangle), we find that A = frac{pi}{3}.3. Use of Sine Rule: With a = 2 and knowing A = frac{pi}{3}, we employ the sine rule:   [   frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = frac{2}{sin frac{pi}{3}} = frac{2}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}   ]   This relationship allows us to express b and c in terms of their respective angles:   [   b = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}sin B, quad c = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}sin C   ]4. Perimeter Calculation: The perimeter P = a + b + c can now be expressed as:   [   P = 2 + frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}sin B + frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}sin C   ]   Given the angle sum property in a triangle (B + C = pi - A = frac{2pi}{3}), we can rewrite C as frac{2pi}{3} - B and thus express the perimeter entirely in terms of B:   [   P = 2 + 2sqrt{3}sin B + 2cos B = 2 + 4sin left(B + frac{pi}{6}right)   ]5. Maximizing the Perimeter: Since B in (0, frac{2pi}{3}), it follows that B + frac{pi}{6} in left(frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{6}right). The function sin(x) reaches its maximum value of 1 at x = frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, to maximize the perimeter, we set B + frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{2}, which gives B = frac{pi}{3}. Substituting back into the perimeter equation yields the maximum perimeter:   [   P_{text{max}} = 2 + 4sin left(frac{pi}{3} + frac{pi}{6}right) = 2 + 4sin left(frac{pi}{2}right) = 2 + 4 cdot 1 = 6   ]   Thus, the maximum value of the perimeter of triangle ABC is boxed{6}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-f181db89 data-v-e1a50256><div class="review" data-v-e1a50256><div class="review-title" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>❓:</span>7.

Let me try to understand the problem first.We have a highway going from west to east, intersecting with n equal roads numbered 1 to n from west to east. Cars come on these roads from south to north and north to south. The probability that a car enters the highway from any of these roads is 1/n. Similarly, the probability that a car exits the highway onto any of these roads is also 1/n. The exit road is independent of the entry road.So, a car can enter the highway from any road, and then exit onto any road, with each choice having probability 1/n, and independent. The question is: what&#39;s the probability that such a car will pass the k-th intersection?Hmm. So, passing the k-th intersection could mean either driving through it without turning, or turning at it. Wait, but the problem says &quot;pass the k-th intersection (either drive through it or turn at it).&quot; Wait, actually, if a car turns at the k-th intersection, does that count as passing it? Maybe in this context, passing includes both going through without stopping or turning, or turning at the intersection. But the wording is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe &quot;pass&quot; here just means that the car goes through the k-th intersection in its path, regardless of whether it turns there or not. Let me think.Wait, if a car enters the highway from road i, then it&#39;s approaching the highway from either south or north. Wait, the roads are equal and cars travel from south to north and north to south. So, each road can have cars coming from south or north. But the highway runs west to east. So, if a car enters the highway from a road, it must be coming from the south or north direction, and then it can exit the highway onto another road, either to the south or north direction. But the problem states that the exit road is independent of the entry road.But maybe the direction (south to north or north to south) doesn&#39;t matter here. The key is that each road is an intersection point, numbered from 1 to n from west to east. So, when a car enters the highway from road i, it&#39;s entering at intersection i, and when it exits, it&#39;s exiting at some intersection j. The problem says that the exit road is independent of the entry road, so the probability that a car exits at road j is 1/n, regardless of where it entered.So, the car&#39;s path on the highway is from intersection i to intersection j. If i &lt; j, then the car is moving east on the highway, passing through intersections i+1, i+2, ..., j. If i &gt; j, then the car is moving west on the highway, passing through intersections i-1, i-2, ..., j. If i = j, the car just turns at intersection i, so it doesn&#39;t pass any other intersections.But the question is about passing the k-th intersection. So, regardless of where the car enters and exits, what&#39;s the probability that the k-th intersection is on its path?So, first, let&#39;s formalize this. Let the entry point be road i and exit point be road j. The car&#39;s path on the highway is from i to j. If the car is going east (i &lt; j), then it passes through all intersections from i to j. If it&#39;s going west (i &gt; j), it passes through all intersections from i down to j. If i = j, it doesn&#39;t pass any other intersections.We need to compute the probability that intersection k is on the path from i to j. Since entry and exit roads are independent, each with probability 1/n, the probability that a car enters at i and exits at j is (1/n) * (1/n) = 1/n². So, the total probability that the car passes through intersection k is the sum over all i and j such that k is on the path from i to j, multiplied by 1/n².So, the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (i, j) where k is between i and j (inclusive if the car turns at k?), wait, no. Wait, if a car enters at i and exits at j, then the path is from i to j. If the car is going east (i &lt; j), then it passes through intersections i, i+1, ..., j. If going west (i &gt; j), passes through i, i-1, ..., j. If i = j, only passes through i (which is j). So, intersection k is on the path if and only if k is between min(i, j) and max(i, j), inclusive.Therefore, for a fixed k, the number of pairs (i, j) such that k is between min(i, j) and max(i, j) inclusive. Then, the probability would be that number divided by n².But let&#39;s check with an example. Let&#39;s take n=3 and k=2. Then, possible (i, j):(1,1): passes 1 only.(1,2): passes 1, 2.(1,3): passes 1, 2, 3.(2,1): passes 2, 1.(2,2): passes 2.(2,3): passes 2, 3.(3,1): passes 3, 2, 1.(3,2): passes 3, 2.(3,3): passes 3.So, the pairs where k=2 is passed are:(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2). So that&#39;s 7 pairs. Since there are 9 total pairs, the probability would be 7/9.Wait, but according to the formula I thought of, the number of pairs where k is between min(i,j) and max(i,j). For k=2, that would be all pairs where i &lt;= 2 &lt;= j or j &lt;= 2 &lt;= i? Wait, no. If i &lt;= j, then 2 is between i and j if i &lt;= 2 &lt;= j. If j &lt;= i, then 2 is between j and i if j &lt;= 2 &lt;= i. So, in either case, k=2 is between i and j (inclusive). So, for each pair (i,j), whether i &lt;= j or i &gt; j, k is between the minimum and maximum of i and j.Therefore, the total number of pairs where k is between i and j (inclusive) is equal to the number of pairs where either i &lt;= k &lt;= j or j &lt;= k &lt;= i.But this is equivalent to the number of pairs (i,j) such that min(i,j) &lt;= k &lt;= max(i,j).So, how to count this? Let&#39;s think for general n and k. The total number of pairs (i,j) where min(i,j) &lt;= k &lt;= max(i,j). Alternatively, this is the total number of pairs minus the number of pairs where both i and j are less than k or both are greater than k.So, total pairs: n².Number of pairs where both i and j &lt; k: (k-1)².Number of pairs where both i and j &gt; k: (n - k)².Therefore, the number of pairs where min(i,j) &lt;= k &lt;= max(i,j) is n² - (k - 1)² - (n - k)².Hence, the probability is [n² - (k - 1)² - (n - k)²] / n².Simplify numerator:n² - (k² - 2k + 1) - (n² - 2nk + k²)= n² - k² + 2k - 1 - n² + 2nk - k²= -2k² + 2k - 1 + 2nkWait, let me check the algebra step by step:First, expand (k - 1)^2: k² - 2k + 1(n - k)^2: n² - 2nk + k²So, numerator = n² - (k² - 2k + 1) - (n² - 2nk + k²)= n² - k² + 2k -1 -n² + 2nk -k²Combine like terms:n² - n² = 0-k² -k² = -2k²+2k-1+2nkSo, numerator = -2k² + 2nk + 2k -1Factor terms:= 2nk -2k² + 2k -1= 2k(n -k +1) -1Wait, not sure if helpful.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different way to compute the number of pairs.Alternatively, think of the number of pairs where i &lt;= k &lt;= j or j &lt;=k &lt;=i. But maybe it&#39;s easier to think of the total pairs where k is between i and j.Alternatively, fix i. For each i, count the number of j such that k is between i and j.If i &lt;=k, then j must be &gt;=k.If i &gt;=k, then j must be &lt;=k.So, for each i:If i &lt;=k: number of j&#39;s = n - k +1 (from k to n)If i &gt;=k: number of j&#39;s = k (from 1 to k)But since j can be anything from 1 to n, but we need to count the j&#39;s such that either i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k, or i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k.Wait, no. Let&#39;s see.Wait, if i &lt;=k, then to have k between i and j, we need j &gt;=k.If i &gt;=k, then to have k between i and j, we need j &lt;=k.Therefore, for each i from 1 to k, the number of j&#39;s is (n - k +1) (since j can be k, k+1,...,n).For each i from k to n, the number of j&#39;s is k (since j can be 1,2,...,k).But wait, i is from 1 to n.Wait, when i is less than or equal to k, the number of j&#39;s where j &gt;=k is (n -k +1).When i is greater than or equal to k, the number of j&#39;s where j &lt;=k is k.But note that when i =k, both cases apply? Wait, no. For i =k, if we take i &lt;=k (which is true), then j &gt;=k. But if we also take i &gt;=k (also true), then j &lt;=k. So, overlapping.Wait, perhaps the correct way is:For i &lt;k, j must be &gt;=k (so that k is between i and j)For i &gt;k, j must be &lt;=k (so that k is between i and j)For i =k, any j will include k (since the path from k to j includes k regardless of j). Wait, if i=k and j=k, then the path is just k. If i=k and j&gt;k, then the path is k to j, which includes k. Similarly, if j&lt;k, then since i=k &gt;j, the path goes from k down to j, which includes k. So, when i=k, all j&#39;s will have the path passing through k. Therefore, for i=k, all n j&#39;s are valid.Therefore, breaking it down:- For i &lt;k: number of j&#39;s where j &gt;=k: n -k +1 (since j can be k, k+1,...,n)- For i =k: number of j&#39;s =n (all j&#39;s)- For i &gt;k: number of j&#39;s where j &lt;=k: k (since j can be 1,2,...,k)Therefore, total number of pairs is:Sum over i=1 to k-1 of (n -k +1) + Sum over i=k of n + Sum over i=k+1 to n of k= (k -1)(n -k +1) + n + (n -k)(k)Simplify:First term: (k -1)(n -k +1)Second term: nThird term: (n -k)kSo total:(k -1)(n -k +1) + n + k(n -k)Expand (k -1)(n -k +1):= (k -1)(n -k +1) = (k -1)(n -k +1) = Let&#39;s compute:Multiply term by term:First, k*(n -k +1) = kn -k² +kThen subtract 1*(n -k +1) = -n +k -1So total:kn -k² +k -n +k -1 = kn -k² +2k -n -1Third term: k(n -k) = kn -k²So total numerator:kn -k² +2k -n -1 + n + kn -k²Combine terms:kn + kn = 2kn- k² -k² = -2k²2k- n + n cancels-1So total:2kn -2k² +2k -1Factor:= 2k(n -k +1) -1Wait, let&#39;s check:2k(n -k +1) = 2kn -2k² +2kThen subtract 1: 2kn -2k² +2k -1, which matches.So the numerator is 2k(n -k +1) -1.Therefore, probability is [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²Wait, but in the example when n=3, k=2:Numerator: 2*2*(3 -2 +1) -1 = 2*2*(2) -1 = 8 -1 =7Denominator:9So 7/9, which matches the example. So that seems correct.Therefore, general formula is [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²But let&#39;s see if we can write this differently. Let&#39;s expand:2k(n -k +1) -1 = 2kn -2k² +2k -1Alternatively, maybe factor terms.Alternatively, perhaps the original expression from the first approach:Probability = [n² - (k-1)² - (n -k)^2]/n²Let me compute that for n=3, k=2:n² - (k-1)^2 - (n -k)^2 =9 -1 -1=7, which gives 7/9. So that works.So in general, probability is [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n²Let me compute that expression:n² - (k² -2k +1) - (n² -2nk +k²) =n² -k² +2k -1 -n² +2nk -k²= -2k² +2nk +2k -1, which is the same as above.Therefore, both approaches give the same formula.So, the answer is [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n².Alternatively, simplifying the numerator:n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2 =n² - (k² -2k +1) - (n² -2nk +k²)=n² -k² +2k -1 -n² +2nk -k²= 2nk -2k² +2k -1So, probability is (2nk -2k² +2k -1)/n²Alternatively, factor:= (2k(n -k +1) -1)/n²But maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of n and k. Let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;Find the probability that a random car that has entered the highway will pass the k-th intersection...&quot; So, likely, the answer is expressed as [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n². Let&#39;s compute that:n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2 =n² - (k² -2k +1) - (n² -2nk +k²)=n² -k² +2k -1 -n² +2nk -k²=2nk -2k² +2k -1So, as a probability, that&#39;s (2nk -2k² +2k -1)/n²Alternatively, factor 2k:= [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²Alternatively, maybe we can write it as [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n². But I need to check whether that&#39;s the simplest form.Alternatively, note that the numerator can be written as 2k(n -k +1) -1. For example, in the n=3, k=2 case, this is 2*2*(3 -2 +1) -1=2*2*2 -1=8-1=7, which is correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s think if there&#39;s a different way to approach this problem.Suppose a car enters at intersection i. Then, the probability that it will pass intersection k depends on where it exits. If i &lt; k, the car must exit at j &gt;=k to pass k. If i &gt;k, the car must exit at j &lt;=k. If i =k, then regardless of exit, it passes k (since it either turns at k or goes through k). So, given that entry is at i, the probability of passing k is:- If i &lt;k: probability that j &gt;=k, which is (n -k +1)/n- If i =k: probability is 1- If i &gt;k: probability that j &lt;=k, which is k/nSince the entry is uniform over 1 to n, the total probability is:[Sum_{i=1}^{k-1} ( (n -k +1)/n ) + 1 + Sum_{i=k+1}^{n} (k/n ) ] /nWait, because each entry i has probability 1/n, and given entry i, the probability of passing k is as above. So, total probability is:( Sum_{i=1}^n P(pass k | entry at i) ) * (1/n )So:= [ Sum_{i=1}^{k-1} ( (n -k +1)/n ) + 1 + Sum_{i=k+1}^n (k/n ) ] * (1/n )Compute the sums:Sum_{i=1}^{k-1} ( (n -k +1)/n ) = (k -1)(n -k +1)/nSum_{i=k+1}^n (k/n ) = (n -k)(k)/nTherefore, total probability:[ (k -1)(n -k +1)/n +1 + (n -k)k/n ] * (1/n )= [ ( (k -1)(n -k +1) + n + k(n -k) ) /n ] * (1/n )Wait, this is the same as before. Then numerator is (k -1)(n -k +1) +n +k(n -k). Which is the same as earlier. So, yes, the same result.Therefore, the probability is [ (k -1)(n -k +1) +n +k(n -k) ] /n²Which, as we saw earlier, simplifies to (2nk -2k² +2k -1)/n², or [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n².Alternatively, we can factor:= [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²Alternatively, if we prefer, we can write it as:= [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²But perhaps there&#39;s a more simplified form.Alternatively, note that 2k(n -k +1) = 2k(n -k) + 2kThus:2k(n -k +1) -1 =2k(n -k) +2k -1=2k(n -k +1) -1But I don&#39;t think that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor as follows:Wait, let&#39;s take the original expression:Probability = [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n²Let me compute that:n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2= n² - [ (k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2 ]Let me compute (k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2:= k² -2k +1 + n² -2nk +k²= 2k² -2k -2nk +n² +1Thus,n² - [2k² -2k -2nk +n² +1] = n² -2k² +2k +2nk -n² -1= -2k² +2k +2nk -1Which is the same as before.Alternatively, factor:= 2k(n -k +1) -1Yes, because:2k(n -k +1) =2kn -2k² +2kThen subtract 1: 2kn -2k² +2k -1, which is the same.So, the numerator is 2k(n -k +1) -1, and denominator n².Therefore, the probability is (2k(n -k +1) -1)/n²Alternatively, we can write this as [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n².But let me check with n=3, k=2:(2*2*(3 -2 +1) -1)/9= (2*2*2 -1)/9=(8 -1)/9=7/9. Which is correct.Another test case: n=1. Then k must be 1. Then probability is [2*1(1 -1 +1) -1]/1²=(2*1*1 -1)/1=1, which is correct since there&#39;s only one intersection, so all cars must pass through it.Another test case: n=2, k=1. Then probability is [2*1(2 -1 +1)-1]/4= [2*1*2 -1]/4= (4 -1)/4=3/4.Check manually:For n=2, k=1. All pairs (i,j):(1,1): passes 1(1,2): passes 1,2(2,1): passes 2,1(2,2): passes 2So, pairs where k=1 is passed: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). That&#39;s 3/4. Correct.So the formula works.Therefore, the answer is (2k(n -k +1) -1)/n². Which can be written as boxed{dfrac{2k(n - k + 1) - 1}{n^2}}.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in a different form. Let me check again.Original problem says &quot;Find the probability that a random car that has entered the highway will pass the k-th intersection&quot;.Given that entry and exit are uniform and independent, and passing the k-th intersection means that k is on the path from entry to exit.Therefore, the formula we derived is correct. So, the final answer is (2k(n -k +1) -1)/n².Alternatively, the problem might prefer it written as [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n². Let&#39;s compute:For example, n=3, k=2:[9 -1 -1]/9=7/9. Correct.But in terms of k and n, which form is more preferable? Maybe the first form. Let&#39;s see:Expressed as [n² - (k-1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n². If we expand that:n² - (k² - 2k +1) - (n² - 2nk +k²)=n² -k² +2k -1 -n² +2nk -k²=2nk -2k² +2k -1. So, same as before.But if written as [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n², maybe this is more compact. Let&#39;s compute:Probability= frac{n^2 - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2}{n^2}Yes, this is acceptable.Alternatively, simplifying numerator:n² - (k² -2k +1) - (n² -2nk +k²) = n² -k² +2k -1 -n² +2nk -k²=2nk -2k² +2k -1But in terms of the problem statement, maybe the answer is required to be written in the simplest form, so perhaps boxed{frac{2k(n - k + 1) - 1}{n^2}}.But I need to check if there&#39;s another way to simplify.Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator as follows:2k(n -k +1) -1 = 2k(n -k +1) -1. Maybe we can write this as 2k(n -k) +2k -1=2k(n -k) + (2k -1). Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, if written as (2k(n -k +1) -1)/n², that&#39;s acceptable. Alternatively, the original expression [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n². Maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the number of roads, so n² minus squares.But given that in the example with n=3 and k=2, the answer is 7/9, and the formula gives 7/9, which is the same as [9 -1 -1]/9=7/9.So, both forms are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in the original form without expanding. Let me check again:Original problem is from 7th grade, 3 points. Maybe a simpler form is expected. Let&#39;s see:The numerator is n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2.Alternatively, this can be written as n² - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2].Alternatively, maybe express in terms of (k -1) + (n -k) = n -1, but that might not help.Alternatively, since the problem is for 7th grade, maybe there&#39;s a more intuitive approach.Imagine that for a car to not pass the k-th intersection, it must both enter and exit on the same side of k. So, either enter and exit west of k (roads 1 to k-1) or enter and exit east of k (roads k+1 to n). The probability of entering and exiting west of k is [(k-1)/n]^2, similarly for east [(n -k)/n]^2. Therefore, the probability of not passing k is [(k-1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n², so the probability of passing k is 1 - [(k-1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n² = [n² - (k-1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n². Which is the same as before.Yes, this is a more intuitive explanation. So, since cars that don&#39;t pass k are those that both enter and exit on the west side of k or both enter and exit on the east side of k. Therefore, the probability they don&#39;t pass k is [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n², so passing is 1 minus that.Therefore, the probability is 1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n² = [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n².This is the simplest way to present it. Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{n^2 - (k - 1)^2 - (n - k)^2}{n^2}}.But let&#39;s see if this can be simplified further:n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2 =n² - (k² -2k +1) - (n² -2nk +k²)=n² -k² +2k -1 -n² +2nk -k²=2nk -2k² +2k -1.Alternatively, factor 2k:=2k(n -k +1) -1.So both forms are equivalent, but the first one might be more intuitive as it directly subtracts the forbidden cases. Therefore, depending on how the problem expects the answer, either form is acceptable. However, for a 7th-grade problem, the form that is derived directly from the intuitive explanation might be preferred.Thus, boxed answer:boxed{1 - frac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}Alternatively, as the original expression:boxed{dfrac{n^2 - (k - 1)^2 - (n - k)^2}{n^2}}But since the problem asks for the probability, either form is correct, but to match the thought process, perhaps the first form is better. However, since the problem is from a competition, the answer is likely expected in the simplest form, which might be the expanded version. Let me check with the test case n=3, k=2:1 - (1 +1)/9 =1 - 2/9=7/9. Which matches.Another test case n=2, k=1:1 - (0 + (2 -1)^2)/4=1 -1/4=3/4. Correct.Another test case n=4, k=2:1 - [(1)^2 + (2)^2]/16=1 - (1 +4)/16=1 -5/16=11/16.Using the other formula:[2*2*(4 -2 +1) -1]/16= [2*2*3 -1]/16=12 -1=11/16. Correct.So both forms work. But the form 1 - [(k-1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n² is simpler and more intuitive.Therefore, the answer is boxed{1 - frac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}.However, let me check if this is the same as the previous expression. Yes:1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n²= [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n².But depending on the grading, perhaps expanding it is better. But in terms of simplicity, the 1 - ... form is more elegant.Given that, I think the answer should be presented as boxed{1 - frac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}.Final Answerboxed{1 - frac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}&lt;/think&gt;To find the probability that a random car entering the highway will pass the (k)-th intersection, we need to consider the paths of cars entering and exiting the highway. A car passes the (k)-th intersection if its path from the entry point (i) to the exit point (j) includes (k). The key steps are as follows:1. Probability of Not Passing the (k)-th Intersection:   - A car does not pass the (k)-th intersection if it both enters and exits on the same side of (k). This can happen in two ways:     - The car enters and exits west of (k) (roads 1 to (k-1)).     - The car enters and exits east of (k) (roads (k+1) to (n)).2. Calculating the Probability:   - The probability that a car enters and exits west of (k) is (left(frac{k-1}{n}right)^2).   - The probability that a car enters and exits east of (k) is (left(frac{n-k}{n}right)^2).   - The total probability of not passing the (k)-th intersection is (frac{(k-1)^2 + (n-k)^2}{n^2}).3. Probability of Passing the (k)-th Intersection:   - The probability of passing the (k)-th intersection is the complement of the probability of not passing it:     [     1 - frac{(k-1)^2 + (n-k)^2}{n^2}     ]Thus, the probability that a random car that has entered the highway will pass the (k)-th intersection is:[boxed{1 - frac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this probability problem. So, there&#39;s a highway going from west to east, and it intersects with n equal roads numbered 1 to n from west to east. Cars come from the south and north on these roads, enter the highway, and then later exit onto one of the roads, either going north or south. The probability that a car enters the highway from any specific road is 1/n, and similarly, the probability that a car exits onto any specific road is also 1/n. The exit road is independent of the entry road. We need to find the probability that a random car entering the highway will pass the k-th intersection. Passing the intersection means either driving through it or turning at it. Hmm, wait, but turning at it would mean exiting there, right? So if a car enters the highway from some road and exits at the k-th intersection, does that count as passing it? Or does passing mean going through without turning? Wait, the problem says &quot;pass the k-th intersection (either drive through it or turn at it).&quot; So actually, whether the car turns at the k-th intersection or drives through it, in both cases, it&#39;s considered as passing the k-th intersection. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure.&quot;A highway running from west to east intersects with n equal roads, numbered from 1 to n in order. Cars travel on these roads from south to north and from north to south. The probability that a car will approach the highway from each of these roads is 1/n. Similarly, the probability that a car will turn off the highway onto each of these roads is 1/n. The road by which a car leaves the highway is independent of the road by which it entered the highway. Find the probability that a random car that has entered the highway will pass the k-th intersection (either drive through it or turn at it).&quot;So, when a car enters the highway, it comes from one of the n roads (each with probability 1/n). Then, it will exit onto one of the n roads (each with probability 1/n), independent of where it entered. We need to find the probability that such a car will pass the k-th intersection. Passing is defined as either driving through the intersection or turning at it. So, if a car enters at road i and exits at road j, then along the highway, it will pass all intersections from min(i, j) to max(i, j). Therefore, the question is asking, for a random car (with random i and j), what is the probability that the k-th intersection is between i and j (inclusive)? Because if k is between i and j, then the car will pass through the k-th intersection either by driving through it (if it doesn&#39;t turn there) or by turning at it (if j = k). So, whether it turns at k or just passes through, it&#39;s counted as passing.Therefore, the problem reduces to: given that i and j are chosen independently and uniformly at random from {1, 2, ..., n}, what is the probability that k is between i and j inclusive? Alternatively, the probability that either i ≤ k ≤ j or j ≤ k ≤ i. Since i and j are symmetric, this is equivalent to the probability that min(i, j) ≤ k ≤ max(i, j).So, how do we compute this probability? Let&#39;s consider all possible pairs (i, j) where either i ≤ k ≤ j or j ≤ k ≤ i. Since i and j are independent, each with probability 1/n, the total probability is the number of such pairs divided by n^2.Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric in i and j, we can compute the probability that k is between i and j inclusive, which is the same as 1 minus the probability that both i and j are less than k or both are greater than k.Wait, let&#39;s think about it. The complement of the event &quot;k is between i and j&quot; is &quot;both i and j are on the same side of k&quot;, i.e., both less than k or both greater than k. So, probability that k is between i and j is 1 - [P(i &lt; k and j &lt; k) + P(i &gt; k and j &gt; k)].Since i and j are independent, P(i &lt; k and j &lt; k) = P(i &lt; k) * P(j &lt; k) = [(k - 1)/n]^2. Similarly, P(i &gt; k and j &gt; k) = [(n - k)/n]^2. Therefore, the desired probability is 1 - [(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2]/n^2.But let me verify this with an example. Suppose n=2 and k=1. Then, the probability should be the probability that either i=1 and j=1, or i=1 and j=2, or i=2 and j=1. Because for k=1, passing the 1st intersection would be if the car enters at 1 and exits anywhere, or enters at 2 and exits at 1. Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, the probability would be 1 - [(0)^2 + (1)^2]/2^2 = 1 - (0 + 1)/4 = 3/4. Let&#39;s check manually:Possible (i, j) pairs:(1,1): passes 1st intersection (exits there)(1,2): passes 1st and 2nd intersections (drives through 1st to get to 2nd)(2,1): passes 2nd and 1st intersections (drives west to exit at 1st)(2,2): passes 2nd intersection (exits there)But the problem says &quot;pass the k-th intersection&quot;, which is the 1st. So in this case, for k=1:(1,1): passes 1st (exits there)(1,2): passes 1st (drives through it to go to 2nd)(2,1): passes 1st (exits there)(2,2): doesn&#39;t pass 1st (starts and ends at 2nd without going west?)Wait, hold on. If a car enters at road 2 and exits at road 1, does it have to pass through the 1st intersection? Since the highway runs west to east, road 1 is the westernmost, road 2 is east. So if a car enters at road 2 (east) and wants to exit at road 1 (west), it has to drive westbound on the highway, passing through the 2nd intersection (where it entered), then the 1st intersection where it exits. Wait, but the numbering is from west to east. So intersections are numbered 1 to n from west to east. So road 1 is west, road 2 is east.If a car enters at road 2 (eastern road), it can either go east or west on the highway. Wait, no—the problem says cars travel on the roads from south to north and north to south. So the highway is west-east, and the other roads are north-south. So when a car comes from the south on road 2, it enters the highway. Then, it can either go west or east on the highway. But the exit is also on one of the roads. Wait, maybe the direction on the highway is determined by the entry and exit points.If a car enters from road i (south to north), then to exit at road j, if j &gt; i, the car must go east on the highway, passing through intersections i+1 up to j. If j &lt; i, the car must go west on the highway, passing through intersections i-1 down to j. If j = i, then the car just turns around? Wait, no, if a car enters from the south at road i, and exits at road j, if j = i, it just turns north or south? Wait, the problem says cars travel on the roads from south to north and north to south. So entering the highway from a road would mean coming from south or north. Then, when entering the highway, the car is going either north to the highway or south to the highway. Then, on the highway, it can go east or west. Then, when exiting, it can go north or south on the road. But the problem states that the road by which a car leaves is independent of the entry road. Hmm, this might complicate things, but the problem statement says that the exit road is independent of the entry road. Therefore, regardless of entry road, the exit road is chosen uniformly at random.But how does the direction on the highway affect the intersections passed? If a car enters at road i and exits at road j, then depending on whether j is east or west of i, the car will travel east or west on the highway, passing through all intersections between i and j. Therefore, regardless of direction, the car will pass through all intersections from min(i, j) to max(i, j). Therefore, the set of intersections passed is all intersections between the entry and exit roads, inclusive. Therefore, the k-th intersection is passed if and only if k is between entry and exit roads, inclusive.Therefore, the problem reduces to: given two independent uniformly random variables i and j from 1 to n, what is the probability that k is between i and j inclusive? Which is equivalent to 1 - [P(i &lt; k and j &lt; k) + P(i &gt; k and j &gt; k)].Therefore, the probability is 1 - [(k - 1)/n]^2 - [(n - k)/n]^2. Simplifying this:1 - [(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2]/n^2.Let me compute this for n=2, k=1:1 - [0 + 1]/4 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. As per the earlier example, let&#39;s check:All possible (i, j) pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). For k=1, how many pairs have k=1 between i and j?(1,1): 1 is between 1 and 1: yes.(1,2): 1 is between 1 and 2: yes.(2,1): 1 is between 2 and 1 (which is 1 and 2): yes.(2,2): 1 is not between 2 and 2: no.So three out of four, which is 3/4. Correct. So that formula works here.Another example: n=3, k=2. Then the probability should be 1 - [(1)^2 + (1)^2]/9 = 1 - (1 + 1)/9 = 1 - 2/9 = 7/9.Let&#39;s check manually. All possible (i, j) pairs. There are 9 pairs. The ones where 2 is not between i and j are when both i and j are &lt;2 or both &gt;2. Since k=2, both i and j &lt;2 would be i=1, j=1. Both &gt;2 would be i=3, j=3. So two pairs: (1,1) and (3,3). So the number of pairs where 2 is between i and j is 9 - 2 = 7. Therefore, probability 7/9. Correct.Therefore, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the answer is 1 - [(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2]/n^2. Let&#39;s simplify this expression.First, expand the numerator:(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2 = (k² - 2k + 1) + (n² - 2nk + k²) = 2k² - 2k - 2nk + n² + 1.Wait, is that correct? Wait, expanding (k - 1)^2:= k² - 2k + 1(n - k)^2:= n² - 2nk + k²Therefore, adding them together:k² - 2k + 1 + n² - 2nk + k²= 2k² - 2k - 2nk + n² + 1Therefore, the numerator is 2k² - 2k - 2nk + n² + 1. Therefore, the entire expression is:1 - [2k² - 2k - 2nk + n² + 1]/n²= [n² - (2k² - 2k - 2nk + n² + 1)]/n²Simplify numerator:n² - 2k² + 2k + 2nk - n² -1= -2k² + 2k + 2nk -1Factor terms:= 2nk -2k² + 2k -1= 2k(n - k + 1) -1Wait, maybe another approach. Alternatively, let&#39;s see if we can factor this differently.Wait, perhaps there is a simpler way to express the original probability.We have the probability as 1 - [(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2]/n².Alternatively, note that:(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2 = (k² - 2k + 1) + (n² - 2nk + k²) = 2k² - 2k - 2nk + n² +1.Alternatively, maybe we can write this as (n - 1)^2 + something, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can leave it as is, but maybe the problem expects a simplified form.Alternatively, think of 1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n² = [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n².Let me compute the numerator:n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2= n² - [k² - 2k + 1] - [n² - 2nk + k²]= n² -k² + 2k -1 -n² + 2nk -k²= (n² -n²) + (-k² -k²) + (2k) + (2nk) + (-1)= -2k² + 2k + 2nk -1Factor terms:= 2k(n -k +1) -1Wait, 2nk -2k² + 2k -1 = 2k(n -k +1) -1. Hmm, perhaps that&#39;s not particularly helpful. Alternatively, factor 2k:= 2k(n -k +1) -1But maybe this is not useful. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor differently. Let&#39;s see:= -2k² + 2nk + 2k -1= -2k² + 2k(n +1) -1Hmm, still not obvious. Maybe it&#39;s acceptable to leave the expression as:1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n².Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s compute the probability that k is between i and j inclusive. Since i and j are independent and uniform, the probability is equal to the average over all i of the probability that j is such that k is between i and j.So for each i, the probability that j is between min(i, k) and max(i, k). Wait, no. For a fixed i, the set of j such that k is between i and j is equivalent to j being between k and i if i &lt; k, or between i and k if i &gt; k. Wait, actually, if i &lt;= k, then j needs to be &gt;=k to have k between i and j? Wait, no. Wait, for a given i, if i &lt;= k, then k is between i and j if j &gt;=k. Similarly, if i &gt;=k, then k is between i and j if j &lt;=k. Wait, no. Let me think again.Wait, if i is the entry road and j is the exit road. Then, the set of j where k is between i and j is:If i &lt;=k, then j can be from k to n, because then k is between i and j (since i &lt;=k &lt;=j). If i &gt;=k, then j can be from 1 to k, because then j &lt;=k &lt;=i. Wait, but that&#39;s only if i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k. Wait, no. If i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k, then k is between j and i (since j &lt;=k &lt;=i). Therefore, for each i, the number of j such that k is between i and j is:If i &lt;=k: j must be &gt;=k (from k to n), so n -k +1 choices.If i &gt;=k: j must be &lt;=k (from 1 to k), so k choices.Therefore, for each i, the number of favorable j is:If i &lt;=k: n -k +1If i &gt;=k: kTherefore, total favorable pairs is:Sum_{i=1}^k (n -k +1) + Sum_{i=k+1}^n k= k*(n -k +1) + (n -k)*k= k(n -k +1) + k(n -k)= k(n -k +1 + n -k)= k(2n -2k +1)Wait, that seems off. Let&#39;s compute it step by step.Sum_{i=1}^k (n -k +1): there are k terms, each (n -k +1), so total is k*(n -k +1)Sum_{i=k+1}^n k: there are (n -k) terms, each k, so total is (n -k)*kTherefore, total favorable pairs = k(n -k +1) + k(n -k) = k(n -k +1 + n -k) = k(2n -2k +1)Wait, 2n -2k +1? Let me check:(n -k +1) + (n -k) = n -k +1 +n -k = 2n -2k +1. Yes.Therefore, total favorable pairs = k(2n -2k +1). Therefore, the probability is [k(2n -2k +1)] / n².Wait, but let&#39;s check with the previous example. For n=2, k=1:Total favorable pairs =1*(2*2 -2*1 +1)=1*(4 -2 +1)=1*3=3. Which matches the 3 favorable pairs out of 4, so 3/4. Correct.Another example, n=3, k=2:Total favorable pairs=2*(2*3 -2*2 +1)=2*(6 -4 +1)=2*3=6. Then 6/9=2/3. Wait, but earlier we had 7/9. Wait, this is a conflict. What&#39;s wrong here?Wait, when n=3, k=2:Sum_{i=1}^2 (3 -2 +1)= Sum_{i=1}^2 2=2*2=4Sum_{i=3}^3 2=1*2=2Total=4+2=6. But earlier, we saw that there are 7 favorable pairs. So discrepancy here.Wait, so where is the mistake?Hold on, when n=3, k=2:Possible pairs (i, j):For i=1: j must be &gt;=2 (since i=1 &lt;=2). So j=2,3. So 2 possibilities.For i=2: j can be anything (since i=2=k). Wait, wait, when i=k, then what is the number of j&#39;s? The original reasoning said if i &lt;=k, j &gt;=k. But when i=k, j &gt;=k (i.e., j=2,3). But actually, when i=k, k is between i and j if j &gt;=k or j &lt;=k? Wait, no. If i=k, then k is between i and j only if j=k? Wait, no. Wait, if i=k and j=k, then the intersection is k. If i=k and j&gt;k, then the car goes east, passing through intersections k+1,...,j. But since k is the entry point, passing through k-th intersection (entering there). So does entering at k count as passing through the intersection? The problem says &quot;pass the k-th intersection (either drive through it or turn at it)&quot;. If a car enters at k, does that count as passing through the k-th intersection? Similarly, exiting at k counts as passing through it. So if a car enters at k and exits at j, then regardless of j, it has to pass through the k-th intersection (since that&#39;s where it entered). Wait, but when a car enters the highway from road k, it arrives at the k-th intersection. To exit at j, it has to go either east or west on the highway. If it goes east, it passes through intersections k+1 to j; if it goes west, it passes through intersections k-1 to j. But in either case, it passes through the k-th intersection (the entry point). Wait, but according to the problem statement, does entering or exiting count as passing the intersection?The problem says: &quot;pass the k-th intersection (either drive through it or turn at it)&quot;. Entering the highway from road k would involve turning onto the highway from road k, which is a turn at the k-th intersection. Similarly, exiting onto road k is a turn at the k-th intersection. Therefore, entering or exiting at k counts as passing it. Therefore, any car that enters or exits at k passes the k-th intersection. Moreover, cars that pass through the k-th intersection without turning (i.e., driving through on the highway) also count. Wait, but if a car is on the highway, it&#39;s already on the highway; to drive through the k-th intersection, it would have to be traveling along the highway past the k-th intersection. But the car enters the highway from some road i and exits at some road j. So between i and j, it&#39;s on the highway, passing through all intersections from min(i,j) to max(i,j). Therefore, if k is between i and j inclusive, then the car passes through the k-th intersection either by driving through it (if k is strictly between i and j) or by turning at it (if k is i or j). Therefore, in all cases where k is between i and j inclusive, the car passes the k-th intersection.Therefore, in the case where i=k, then regardless of j, since the car enters at k, it will have to exit at some j. If j &gt;=k, it passes through intersections k to j. If j &lt;=k, it passes through intersections j to k. In both cases, since k is included, the car passes the k-th intersection. Therefore, for i=k, all j&#39;s result in passing the k-th intersection. Similarly, if j=k, regardless of i, the car will pass through k. But in our previous calculation, when we considered i=1 to k and i=k+1 to n, we might have made a mistake.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the earlier reasoning. The user said:&quot;For each i, the number of j such that k is between i and j is:If i &lt;=k: j must be &gt;=k (from k to n), so n -k +1 choices.If i &gt;=k: j must be &lt;=k (from 1 to k), so k choices.&quot;But when i=k, which is included in the first case (i &lt;=k), the number of j is n -k +1, which for i=k, that&#39;s n -k +1. But when i=k, the car enters at k, and exits at j. To pass the k-th intersection, since the car is entering at k, which is passing it (turning there). Then, regardless of j, whether j is east or west, the car will pass through k-th intersection when entering. Therefore, actually, for i=k, all j&#39;s (from 1 to n) will result in passing through k-th intersection, not just j &gt;=k.Wait, that contradicts our earlier reasoning. Therefore, there is a mistake here.So, the mistake is in assuming that if i &lt;=k, then j must be &gt;=k. But in reality, if i &lt;=k, then to have k between i and j, j can be either &gt;=k or &lt;=k, but wait, no. Wait, if i &lt;=k, then k is between i and j only if j &gt;=k. Because if i &lt;=k and j &lt;=k, then k is not between i and j unless j =k. Wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify.If i &lt;=k and j &lt;=k, then the set of intersections passed is from i to j. If i &lt;=k and j &lt;=k, then if i &lt;=j &lt;=k, the intersections passed are from i to j. So k is only passed if j &gt;=k. If j &lt;k, then the intersections passed are from i to j, which might not include k. Wait, no. If i &lt;=k and j &lt;=k, but i &lt;=j &lt;=k, then the intersections passed are i to j. So if j &lt;k, then k is not passed. Therefore, for i &lt;=k, the car passes k-th intersection only if j &gt;=k. Similarly, for i &gt;=k, the car passes k-th intersection only if j &lt;=k. However, if i =k, then regardless of j, because when you enter at k, you have to exit somewhere, either east or west. If you exit east (j &gt;k), then you pass k and go east. If you exit west (j &lt;k), you pass k and go west. If you exit at k, you turn there. Therefore, in all cases, entering at k means passing through k-th intersection.Similarly, exiting at k (j=k) means passing through k-th intersection regardless of i. Therefore, the previous reasoning was flawed because when i=k, even if j &lt;k, the car passes through k-th intersection. Similarly, when j=k, even if i &gt;k or &lt;k, the car passes through k-th intersection. Therefore, the correct way is: the car passes through k-th intersection if either i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k, or i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k, or i=k, or j=k.Wait, no. If i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k, then the car passes through all intersections from i to j, which includes k. If i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k, the car passes through all intersections from j to i, which includes k. If i=k or j=k, then regardless of the other, the car passes through k. So the correct condition is that k is between min(i, j) and max(i, j), or i=k or j=k. Wait, but if i=k and j is something else, then k is between min(k, j) and max(k, j). For example, if i=k and j &gt;k, then min(i, j)=k, max(i, j)=j, so k is included. If i=k and j &lt;k, then min(i, j)=j, max(i, j)=k, so k is included. Therefore, the initial reasoning was correct: k is between min(i, j) and max(i, j), inclusive. Therefore, the event is equivalent to k being in the closed interval [min(i, j), max(i, j)]. Therefore, the original formula still holds.But in the earlier example where n=3, k=2:According to the formula, the number of favorable pairs is k*(2n -2k +1) = 2*(6 -4 +1)=2*3=6, but manually we found 7 pairs. This suggests a discrepancy.Wait, let&#39;s list all pairs for n=3, k=2:Total pairs: 9.Pairs where k=2 is between i and j:(1,2): includes 2(1,3): includes 2(2,1): includes 2(2,2): includes 2(2,3): includes 2(3,1): includes 2(3,2): includes 2(3,3): does not include 2(1,1): does not include 2(2,1): same as (1,2)?Wait, no. Each pair (i, j) is ordered, but since i and j are independent, (i, j) is different from (j, i) unless i=j.So total pairs:(1,1): no(1,2): yes(1,3): yes(2,1): yes(2,2): yes(2,3): yes(3,1): yes(3,2): yes(3,3): noSo out of 9 pairs, how many have k=2 between i and j:(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2). That&#39;s 7 pairs. Therefore, probability 7/9.But according to the formula k*(2n -2k +1)/n²=2*(6 -4 +1)/9=2*3/9=6/9=2/3, which is incorrect. Therefore, there&#39;s a mistake in the earlier reasoning.So where did we go wrong? The previous approach assumed that for i &lt;=k, the number of j&#39;s is n -k +1, but when i=k, j can be any, but actually, when i=k, all j&#39;s result in passing through k. Similarly, when j=k, regardless of i. Therefore, the initial method of splitting into i &lt;=k and i &gt;=k is flawed.Let me try a different approach. The total number of pairs where k is between i and j is equal to the number of pairs where i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k plus the number of pairs where i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k. However, this counts the pairs where i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k and the pairs where i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k. But when i=k and j=k, this pair is counted in both sets. Therefore, to avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the intersection.Therefore, total favorable pairs = [number of pairs with i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k] + [number of pairs with i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k] - [number of pairs where i=k and j=k].Number of pairs with i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k: number of i&#39;s &lt;=k is k, number of j&#39;s &gt;=k is n -k +1, so total is k*(n -k +1).Number of pairs with i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k: number of i&#39;s &gt;=k is n -k +1, number of j&#39;s &lt;=k is k, so total is (n -k +1)*k.Number of pairs where i=k and j=k: 1.Therefore, total favorable pairs = k*(n -k +1) + k*(n -k +1) -1 = 2k(n -k +1) -1.Wait, but for n=3, k=2:2*2*(3 -2 +1) -1=2*2*2 -1=8 -1=7. Which matches the manual count. Therefore, the formula is 2k(n -k +1) -1.Therefore, the probability is [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n².Let me verify with previous examples.First example, n=2, k=1:[2*1*(2 -1 +1) -1]/4 = [2*1*2 -1]/4 = (4 -1)/4=3/4. Correct.Second example, n=3, k=2:[2*2*(3 -2 +1) -1]/9 = [4*(2) -1]/9= (8 -1)/9=7/9. Correct.Third example, n=3, k=1:[2*1*(3 -1 +1) -1]/9 = [2*1*3 -1]/9=(6 -1)/9=5/9.Let&#39;s check manually for n=3, k=1:Pairs where k=1 is between i and j:(1,1): yes(1,2): yes(1,3): yes(2,1): yes(3,1): yes(2,2): no(2,3): yes (i=2, j=3: min=2, max=3, so 1 is not between)Wait, wait, no. For pair (2,3): min=2, max=3, so k=1 is not between 2 and 3. Therefore, only pairs where i &lt;=1 or j &lt;=1.Wait, for k=1, being between i and j means that 1 is between i and j. So i &lt;=1 &lt;=j or j &lt;=1 &lt;=i. So either i &lt;=1 and j &gt;=1, or j &lt;=1 and i &gt;=1. But since i and j are &gt;=1, the second condition (j &lt;=1 and i &gt;=1) is only possible if j=1 and i &gt;=1. So total pairs:i &lt;=1 (i=1) and j &gt;=1: which is all j from 1 to 3: 3 pairs.j &lt;=1 (j=1) and i &gt;=1: which is all i from 1 to 3: 3 pairs.But subtract the overlapping pair where i=1 and j=1: total pairs 3 +3 -1=5. Therefore, probability 5/9, which matches the formula. So the formula works here.Therefore, the correct general formula is [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n².But let&#39;s express this differently. Let&#39;s expand 2k(n -k +1) -1:= 2k(n -k +1) -1= 2kn -2k² +2k -1But is there a way to simplify this further? Let&#39;s see:Alternatively, note that:2k(n -k +1) -1 = 2k(n -k) +2k -1 = 2k(n -k) +2k -1 = 2k(n -k +1) -1.Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, factor:= 2k(n -k +1) -1But perhaps this is the simplest form. Therefore, the probability is (2k(n -k +1) -1)/n².Alternatively, we can also derive this formula by considering that the probability that k is between i and j is equal to the probability that i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k plus the probability that i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k minus the probability that i=k and j=k.Which is:P(i &lt;=k and j &gt;=k) + P(i &gt;=k and j &lt;=k) - P(i=k and j=k)= [k/n * (n -k +1)/n] + [(n -k +1)/n * k/n] - [1/n²]= [k(n -k +1) +k(n -k +1) -1]/n²= [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²Which matches our previous result.Therefore, the correct probability is [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n².Alternatively, this can be written as (2k(n -k +1) -1)/n².Alternatively, we can factor this as:= [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²= [2kn -2k² +2k -1]/n²But perhaps there&#39;s a different way to express this. Let me check if this is equal to 1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n².Earlier, we had:1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n² = 1 - [k² -2k +1 +n² -2nk +k²]/n² = [n² -2k² +2k +2nk -n² -1]/n² = [ -2k² +2k +2nk -1 ]/n²Which is equal to [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n². Because:2k(n -k +1) -1 = 2kn -2k² +2k -1, which matches the numerator. Therefore, both expressions are equivalent.Therefore, the probability can be written either as 1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n² or as [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n². Both are correct. Depending on which form is preferred, but perhaps the first form is simpler.Let me confirm for n=3, k=2:1 - [(2-1)^2 + (3-2)^2]/3² =1 - [1 +1]/9=1 -2/9=7/9. Correct.Similarly, for n=2, k=1:1 - [0 +1]/4=3/4. Correct.Therefore, both expressions are correct. Therefore, the answer is 1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n².Alternatively, simplifying this:1 - [(k² -2k +1) + (n² -2nk +k²)]/n²=1 - [2k² -2k -2nk +n² +1]/n²= [n² -2k² +2k +2nk -n² -1]/n²= [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n²But maybe the problem expects the answer in the first form. Alternatively, let&#39;s compute:The probability is 1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n².This can also be written as [n² - (k -1)^2 - (n -k)^2]/n².Calculate numerator:n² - (k² -2k +1) - (n² -2nk +k²)= n² -k² +2k -1 -n² +2nk -k²= -2k² +2k +2nk -1= 2k(n -k +1) -1Therefore, both forms are equivalent. Depending on which is simpler. Since the problem is from 7th grade, perhaps the first form is more intuitive.Alternatively, recognizing that [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2] is the sum of squares of distances from k to 1 and from k to n.But regardless, the answer is 1 - [(k -1)^2 + (n -k)^2]/n². Therefore, boxed, it would be boxed{1 - dfrac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}.Alternatively, if we write it as [2k(n -k +1) -1]/n², but since the problem is for 7th grade, maybe the first form is better.Final AnswerThe probability is boxed{1 - dfrac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the probability that a random car entering the highway will pass the (k)-th intersection, we need to consider the probability that the car&#39;s entry and exit roads are such that the (k)-th intersection is between them. 1. Understanding the Problem:   - Cars enter the highway from one of (n) roads with probability (frac{1}{n}).   - Cars exit the highway onto one of (n) roads with probability (frac{1}{n}).   - The exit road is independent of the entry road.   - A car passes the (k)-th intersection if it either drives through it or turns at it.2. Key Insight:   - A car passes the (k)-th intersection if (k) is between the entry road (i) and exit road (j) (inclusive). This is equivalent to (k) being in the interval ([ min(i, j), max(i, j) ]).3. Probability Calculation:   - The probability that (k) is not between (i) and (j) is the sum of the probabilities that both (i) and (j) are less than (k) or both are greater than (k).   - Using complementary probability, we subtract these probabilities from 1.4. Mathematical Formulation:   - The probability that both (i) and (j) are less than (k) is (left( frac{k-1}{n} right)^2).   - The probability that both (i) and (j) are greater than (k) is (left( frac{n-k}{n} right)^2).   - Therefore, the probability that (k) is between (i) and (j) is:     [     1 - left( left( frac{k-1}{n} right)^2 + left( frac{n-k}{n} right)^2 right)     ]5. Simplification:   - Simplifying the expression, we get:     [     1 - frac{(k-1)^2 + (n-k)^2}{n^2}     ]Thus, the probability that a random car entering the highway will pass the (k)-th intersection is (boxed{1 - dfrac{(k - 1)^2 + (n - k)^2}{n^2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e1a50256></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>🔑:</span>Answer: frac{2 k n-2 k^{2}+2 k-1}{n^{2}}.Solution.

Let me start by understanding what&#39;s given. The problem says that in the sequence {a_n}, a_1 is 1, and then each subsequent term is given by a_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)a_n + (n+1)*2^n. Then part (I) asks to define b_n = a_n / n and find the general formula for {b_n}. Part (II) is to find the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}, called S_n.Alright, let&#39;s tackle part (I) first. So, they want me to express b_n in terms of a_n divided by n, and find a general formula for b_n. Hmm. Let me write down what&#39;s given.Given a_1 = 1, and the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n) a_n + (n+1) 2^n. So, first, maybe I can rewrite the recurrence in terms of b_n. Since b_n = a_n / n, then a_n = n b_n. Let&#39;s substitute that into the recurrence relation.So, a_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n) * a_n + (n+1) 2^n. Substitute a_n = n b_n:a_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n) * n b_n + (n+1) 2^n.Simplify (1 + 1/n) * n: that&#39;s (n + 1)/n * n = n + 1. So, that term becomes (n + 1) b_n. Then the second term is (n + 1) 2^n. So, we have:a_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_n + (n + 1) 2^n.But a_{n+1} is also equal to (n + 1) b_{n+1} because a_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_{n+1}. So, set those equal:(n + 1) b_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_n + (n + 1) 2^n.Divide both sides by (n + 1):b_{n+1} = b_n + 2^n.Oh! That simplifies things a lot. So the recurrence for b_n is b_{n+1} = b_n + 2^n. That seems much simpler. And what&#39;s the initial condition? Since a_1 = 1, then b_1 = a_1 / 1 = 1. So, b_1 = 1.So now, the problem reduces to solving the recurrence relation for b_n where each term is the previous term plus 2^{n-1}? Wait, wait. Wait, let&#39;s check. Wait, the recurrence is b_{n+1} = b_n + 2^n. So, starting from b_1 = 1, then:b_2 = b_1 + 2^1 = 1 + 2 = 3b_3 = b_2 + 2^2 = 3 + 4 = 7b_4 = b_3 + 2^3 = 7 + 8 = 15Wait a minute, that&#39;s 2^2 - 1, 2^3 - 1, 2^4 - 1... Wait, 3 is 2^2 - 1, 7 is 2^3 - 1, 15 is 2^4 - 1. Hmm, so maybe b_n = 2^n - 1? Let&#39;s test that. If n=1, 2^1 -1 =1, which matches b_1. For n=2, 2^2 -1=3, which matches b_2. n=3: 7 vs 2^3 -1=7, yes. n=4:15 vs 2^4 -1=15. Perfect. So it seems that the general term is b_n = 2^n -1.But wait, let me verify this by induction. Suppose that for some n &gt;=1, b_n = 2^n -1. Then, b_{n+1} = b_n + 2^n = (2^n -1) + 2^n = 2*2^n -1 = 2^{n+1} -1. Which matches the formula. And the base case holds as well. Therefore, by mathematical induction, b_n = 2^n -1 for all n &gt;=1.Therefore, part (I)&#39;s answer is b_n = 2^n -1. So that was straightforward once I substituted b_n into the original recurrence. Great.Now moving on to part (II): Find the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}, S_n. So S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n. Since we have a formula for a_n in terms of b_n, which is a_n = n b_n = n(2^n -1). Therefore, S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k = sum_{k=1}^n k(2^k -1) = sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k - sum_{k=1}^n k.So, if I can compute the two sums separately, then subtract them. The second sum is straightforward: sum_{k=1}^n k = n(n +1)/2. The first sum is sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k. I remember that there is a formula for this. Let me recall. The sum of k r^k from k=1 to n is r(1 - (n+1) r^n + n r^{n+1}) ) / (1 - r)^2. For r ≠1. Since here r=2, which is not 1. Let me confirm that.Let me derive the formula. Let S = sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k. Let me consider S = 2 + 2*2^2 + 3*2^3 + ... +n 2^n. Then 2S = 2^2 + 2*2^3 + 3*2^4 + ... +n 2^{n+1}. Subtract S from 2S:2S - S = S = (2^2 + 2*2^3 + 3*2^4 + ... +n 2^{n+1}) - (2 + 2*2^2 + 3*2^3 + ... +n 2^n)Looking term by term:For 2^2: 2^2 - 0 = 4For 2*2^3: 2*2^3 - 2*2^2 = 2*8 - 2*4 = 16 - 8 = 8For 3*2^4: 3*2^4 - 3*2^3 = 3*16 - 3*8 = 48 -24=24Wait, this seems like each term is (k-1)2^k. Wait, maybe another approach.Wait, in general, the subtraction gives:S = 2S - S = -2 + (2^2 - 2*2^2) + (2*2^3 - 3*2^3) + ... + (n 2^{n+1} -n 2^n)Wait, no, let&#39;s actually line them up properly. Let&#39;s subtract term by term:First term of 2S: 2^2First term of S: 2So difference: 2^2 - 2 = 4 -2=2Second term of 2S: 2*2^3 = 16Second term of S: 2*2^2 =8Difference: 16 -8=8Third term: 3*2^4 vs 3*2^3: 48 -24=24Wait, but this is 2^{k} (from the second term). Wait, maybe this is forming a geometric series.Wait, let&#39;s note that when we subtract S from 2S, we have:S = 2S - S = sum_{k=2}^{n+1} (k-1)2^{k} - sum_{k=1}^n k 2^kWait, actually, 2S is sum_{k=1}^n k 2^{k+1} = sum_{k=2}^{n+1} (k-1)2^{k}So S = sum_{k=2}^{n+1} (k-1)2^{k} - sum_{k=1}^n k 2^kLet me write this as:S = [sum_{k=2}^{n} (k-1)2^k + (n)2^{n+1}] - [sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k]Which is:sum_{k=2}^n (k -1 -k)2^k + n 2^{n+1} - 1*2^1Simplify the coefficients:(k -1 -k) = -1, so:sum_{k=2}^n (-1)2^k + n 2^{n+1} - 2Thus:S = -sum_{k=2}^n 2^k + n 2^{n+1} -2Note that sum_{k=2}^n 2^k = sum_{k=0}^n 2^k - 2^0 -2^1 = (2^{n+1} -1) -1 -2 = 2^{n+1} -4So substituting back:S = -(2^{n+1} -4) + n 2^{n+1} -2 = -2^{n+1} +4 +n 2^{n+1} -2 = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2Therefore, S = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2. Let me check this formula with small n.For n=1: sum_{k=1}^1 k 2^k = 1*2 =2. Using the formula: (1-1)2^{2} +2=0 +2=2. Correct.For n=2: 1*2 +2*4=2+8=10. Formula: (2-1)2^3 +2=1*8 +2=10. Correct.For n=3: 2 +8 +3*8=2+8+24=34. Formula: (3-1)2^4 +2=2*16 +2=34. Correct. Good.So the formula for sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k is (n -1)2^{n+1} +2. So then, going back to the original problem:sum_{k=1}^n a_k = sum_{k=1}^n k(2^k -1) = sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k - sum_{k=1}^n k = [(n -1)2^{n+1} +2] - [n(n +1)/2]Therefore, S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2]Let me write that as:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} + 2Alternatively, we can factor 2^{n+1} as 2*2^n, but maybe it&#39;s already simplified enough. Let me check if this can be written in a more compact form.Alternatively, perhaps we can factor terms:But let&#39;s verify with a small n. Let&#39;s take n=1:S_1 = a_1 =1. According to the formula:(1 -1)2^{2} +2 - (1*2)/2 = 0 +2 -1=1. Correct.For n=2: a1 +a2 =1 + (2*(2^2 -1))=1 +2*3=7. According to the formula:(2-1)2^{3} +2 - (2*3)/2=8 +2 -3=7. Correct.For n=3: 1 + 6 + 3*(2^3 -1)=1 +6 +21=28. Formula:(3-1)2^4 +2 - (3*4)/2=2*16 +2 -6=32 +2 -6=28. Correct.So the formula works. Therefore, the sum S_n is (n -1)2^{n+1} - n(n +1)/2 +2. Let me see if this can be simplified further.Let me compute (n -1)2^{n+1} +2. That term is (n -1)2^{n+1} +2. Then minus n(n +1)/2. So the entire expression is:(n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - frac{n(n +1)}{2}Alternatively, we can write 2 as 4/2 to have the same denominator for the constants:(n -1)2^{n+1} + frac{4}{2} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} = (n -1)2^{n+1} + frac{4 -n(n +1)}{2}Alternatively, factor 2^{n+1}:But perhaps it&#39;s acceptable as it is. However, maybe we can write it as:2^{n+1}(n -1) - frac{n(n +1)}{2} +2Alternatively, factor 2^{n+1} and see if there&#39;s a way to combine terms, but I don&#39;t think so. So maybe that&#39;s the final expression.Alternatively, perhaps we can write (n -1)2^{n+1} as n 2^{n+1} - 2^{n+1}, so:n 2^{n+1} - 2^{n+1} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} +2But then combining constants:= n 2^{n+1} - 2^{n+1} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} +2= n 2^{n+1} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} -2^{n+1} +2But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s helpful. Alternatively, factor 2^{n+1} as 2*2^n:= 2*2^n(n -1) - frac{n(n +1)}{2} +2But maybe it&#39;s best left as:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} +2Alternatively, some sources might prefer to write the entire expression with a common denominator or in another form, but this seems acceptable.Alternatively, let&#39;s factor out 2:= 2^{n+1}(n -1) +2 - frac{n(n +1)}{2}But again, not sure. Let me check another value. For n=3, we had 28. Let&#39;s compute each term:(n -1)2^{n+1}=2*16=32Then minus n(n +1)/2=3*4/2=6, plus 2. So 32 -6 +2=28. Correct.Alternatively, someone might prefer to write it as (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2]. So that&#39;s acceptable.Alternatively, maybe we can write this as:S_n = 2^{n+1}(n -1) +2 - frac{n(n +1)}{2}But perhaps the problem expects a simplified form. Let me check if this can be written as:Let me see: 2^{n+1}(n -1) +2 = 2^{n+1}(n -1) + 2But maybe combine 2^{n+1}(n -1) and 2. Hmm, unless there is a way to factor 2 out:= 2[2^n(n -1) +1] - frac{n(n +1)}{2}But I don&#39;t think that helps.Alternatively, maybe the answer is left in this form. Alternatively, another approach to compute S_n.Wait, since S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k = sum_{k=1}^n k(2^k -1) = sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k - sum_{k=1}^n k.We already have sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2, and sum_{k=1}^n k = n(n +1)/2. Therefore, S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - n(n +1)/2. So, yes, that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, perhaps we can present the answer as:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} + 2But maybe to write all terms with denominator 2:= frac{2(n -1)2^{n+1} -n(n +1) +4}{2}But expanding 2(n -1)2^{n+1} = (n -1)2^{n+2}Wait, 2(n -1)2^{n+1} = (n -1)2^{n+2}So,= frac{(n -1)2^{n+2} -n(n +1) +4}{2}But not sure if this is better. Alternatively, leave it as is.Alternatively, another approach: Since we know that a_n =n(2^n -1), then S_n = sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k - sum_{k=1}^n k. So, using the formula for sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k which is (n-1)2^{n+1} +2, then S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - n(n +1)/2. That seems as simplified as possible. So perhaps that&#39;s the answer.Alternatively, factor 2^{n+1} and the other terms:But since 2^{n+1} is exponential and the other terms are polynomial, they can&#39;t be combined. Therefore, the answer is S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} - frac{n(n +1)}{2} +2.Alternatively, the problem might prefer to write it in a different way. Let me check the problem statement again. It just says &quot;Find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n}, S_n&quot;. So as long as it&#39;s a closed-form expression, that&#39;s acceptable.Therefore, I think that&#39;s the answer.Final Answer(I) The general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) is (boxed{b_n = 2^n - 1}).(II) The sum of the first (n) terms of the sequence ({a_n}) is (boxed{(n - 1)2^{n+1} - dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 2}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the sequence ({a_n}) with (a_1 = 1) and the recurrence relation (a_{n+1} = left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)a_n + (n+1) cdot 2^n), we need to find the general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) where (b_n = frac{a_n}{n}) (part I), and the sum of the first (n) terms (S_n) (part II). Part I: Finding the General Formula for ({b_n})1. Substitute (a_n = n b_n) into the recurrence relation:   [   a_{n+1} = left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) n b_n + (n+1) cdot 2^n   ]2. Simplify the left-hand side and right-hand side:   [   (n+1) b_{n+1} = (n+1) b_n + (n+1) cdot 2^n   ]3. Divide both sides by (n+1):   [   b_{n+1} = b_n + 2^n   ]4. Recognize the recurrence relation for (b_n) starting with (b_1 = 1). Solving this recurrence, we find:   [   b_n = 2^n - 1   ]Thus, the general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) is (boxed{b_n = 2^n - 1}). Part II: Finding the Sum of the First (n) Terms (S_n)1. Express (a_n) in terms of (b_n):   [   a_n = n b_n = n (2^n - 1)   ]2. Sum the first (n) terms (a_k):   [   S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k = sum_{k=1}^n k (2^k - 1) = sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k - sum_{k=1}^n k   ]3. Use the formula for (sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k):   [   sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k = (n - 1)2^{n+1} + 2   ]4. Use the formula for (sum_{k=1}^n k):   [   sum_{k=1}^n k = frac{n(n + 1)}{2}   ]5. Combine the results:   [   S_n = (n - 1)2^{n+1} + 2 - frac{n(n + 1)}{2}   ]Thus, the sum of the first (n) terms of the sequence ({a_n}) is (boxed{(n - 1)2^{n+1} - dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 2}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the sequence {a_n}. Let&#39;s start by understanding what&#39;s given and what&#39;s asked.First, the sequence is defined by a₁ = 1, and then recursively by a_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)a_n + (n + 1)2ⁿ. Part (I) asks me to define b_n = a_n / n and find the general formula for {b_n}. Then part (II) is to find the sum S_n of the first n terms of {a_n}.Let me tackle part (I) first. Since b_n = a_n / n, maybe if I rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of b_n, things will simplify. Let&#39;s try that.Starting with the given recurrence:a_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)a_n + (n + 1)2ⁿ.Let&#39;s substitute a_n = n b_n into this equation. Then:a_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)(n b_n) + (n + 1)2ⁿ.Simplify the first term on the right side:(1 + 1/n)(n b_n) = (n + 1) b_n.So the equation becomes:a_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_n + (n + 1)2ⁿ.But a_{n+1} can also be written in terms of b_{n+1}:a_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_{n+1}.Therefore, we have:(n + 1) b_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_n + (n + 1)2ⁿ.Divide both sides by (n + 1):b_{n+1} = b_n + 2ⁿ.Oh, that&#39;s nice! So the recurrence for {b_n} simplifies to b_{n+1} = b_n + 2ⁿ. That&#39;s a much simpler recursion. Now, let&#39;s see if we can solve that.Since b_{n+1} - b_n = 2ⁿ, this is a telescoping series. If we write out the terms:b₁ = a₁ / 1 = 1 / 1 = 1.Then,b₂ = b₁ + 2¹ = 1 + 2 = 3.b₃ = b₂ + 2² = 3 + 4 = 7.b₄ = b₃ + 2³ = 7 + 8 = 15.Wait a second, this looks familiar. 1, 3, 7, 15... Each term is 2ⁿ - 1. Let&#39;s check:For n=1: 2¹ - 1 = 1, which is b₁.For n=2: 2² - 1 = 3, which is b₂.For n=3: 2³ - 1 = 7, which is b₃.Yes! So it seems like b_n = 2ⁿ - 1. Let&#39;s verify this with induction.Base case: n=1. b₁=1=2¹ -1=2-1=1. Correct.Inductive step: Assume b_k = 2ᵏ -1. Then b_{k+1} = b_k + 2ᵏ = (2ᵏ -1) + 2ᵏ = 2*2ᵏ -1 = 2^{k+1} -1. Hence, by induction, b_n = 2ⁿ -1 for all n≥1.Therefore, the general formula for {b_n} is b_n = 2ⁿ -1.Cool, part (I) is done. Now part (II) is to find the sum S_n = a₁ + a₂ + ... + a_n.Given that a_n = n b_n = n(2ⁿ -1). Therefore, S_n = Σ_{k=1}^n [k(2ᵏ -1)] = Σ_{k=1}^n k 2ᵏ - Σ_{k=1}^n k.So, S_n = Σk2ᵏ from k=1 to n minus Σk from k=1 to n.We know that Σk from 1 to n is n(n +1)/2. So that part is easy.The challenging part is Σk2ᵏ from k=1 to n. Let&#39;s recall some formulas for sums involving k2ᵏ.There&#39;s a standard formula for Σ_{k=0}^n k x^k. Let me recall that.The sum Σ_{k=0}^n k x^k = x(1 - (n +1)xⁿ + n x^{n +1}) ) / (1 - x)².But here, x=2. However, our sum starts from k=1 instead of k=0. Let&#39;s adjust for that.Σ_{k=1}^n k 2ᵏ = Σ_{k=0}^n k 2ᵏ - 0*2⁰ = [2(1 - (n +1)2ⁿ + n 2^{n +1})] / (1 - 2)².Compute denominator: (1 - 2)² = 1. So denominator is 1.Numerator: 2[1 - (n +1)2ⁿ + n 2^{n +1}].Simplify numerator:2[1 - (n +1)2ⁿ + n * 2^{n +1}]= 2[1 + (- (n +1)2ⁿ + 2n 2ⁿ)]= 2[1 + (2n - (n +1))2ⁿ]= 2[1 + (n -1)2ⁿ]So the sum Σ_{k=1}^n k2ᵏ = 2[1 + (n -1)2ⁿ].Wait, let me check this formula with small n:For n=1: Σk2ᵏ =1*2=2. According to the formula, 2[1 + (1 -1)2¹] =2[1 +0]=2. Correct.For n=2: 1*2 + 2*4=2 +8=10. Formula: 2[1 + (2 -1)2²] =2[1 +1*4]=2*5=10. Correct.For n=3: 2 +8 + 3*8=2+8+24=34. Formula: 2[1 + (3-1)2³] =2[1 +2*8]=2[1+16]=2*17=34. Correct. So formula works.Therefore, Σ_{k=1}^n k2ᵏ =2[1 + (n -1)2ⁿ] =2 + (n -1)2^{n +1}.But maybe better to write it as 2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}.Alternatively, combining terms:(n -1)2^{n+1} +2= n2^{n+1} -2^{n+1} +2= n2^{n+1} -2(2ⁿ) +2= n2^{n+1} -2^{n+1} +2= 2^{n+1}(n -1) +2.But maybe we can leave it as 2 + (n -1)2^{n+1} for now.Therefore, Σk2ᵏ from 1 to n is 2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}.Hence, S_n= Σk2ᵏ - Σk= [2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}] - [n(n +1)/2].Therefore, S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2].But perhaps we can simplify this expression further.First, let&#39;s compute (n -1)2^{n+1} +2.Factor 2^{n+1}:(n -1)2^{n+1} +2=2^{n+1}(n -1) +2.Alternatively, maybe express 2 as 2^{1}, so:=2^{1} +2^{n+1}(n -1).But that might not help. Alternatively, let&#39;s combine the constants:Wait, perhaps another approach.Wait, let&#39;s see:The term (n -1)2^{n+1} can be written as n2^{n+1} -2^{n+1}So S_n= n2^{n+1} -2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2]= n2^{n+1} -2^{n+1} +2 - (n² +n)/2.Alternatively, write all terms with denominator 2:Express n2^{n+1} as 2n2ⁿ, and -2^{n+1} as -2*2ⁿ, so:=2n2ⁿ -2*2ⁿ +2 - (n² +n)/2Factor 2ⁿ terms:=2ⁿ(2n -2) +2 - (n² +n)/2=2ⁿ *2(n -1) +2 - (n² +n)/2= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - (n² +n)/2Alternatively, combine constants:But perhaps it&#39;s better to present the answer in the form:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2]But maybe we can find a more elegant expression. Let&#39;s see.Let me check if there&#39;s a different way to compute Σk2ᵏ. Maybe integrating generating functions or another method.Alternatively, recall that Σ_{k=1}^n k2^k = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2. So that&#39;s the formula we have.So S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - n(n +1)/2.But perhaps factor 2 from the first two terms:=2[(n -1)2ⁿ +1] - n(n +1)/2.Alternatively, maybe we can write it as:(n -1)2^{n+1} - (n² +n)/2 +2.Alternatively, to combine terms, we can write 2 as 4/2:So S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +4/2 - (n² +n)/2= [2(n -1)2^{n+1} +4 -n² -n]/2.Wait, no. Wait, actually:Wait, (n -1)2^{n+1} is already over 1. Let&#39;s convert everything to over 2.(n -1)2^{n+1} = (n -1)2^{n} * 2 = 2(n -1)2^{n}Then, S_n= 2(n -1)2^{n} +2 - (n² +n)/2.But maybe leave it as:S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)]/2.Alternatively, perhaps factor something else. Let me check with n=1, n=2 to see.Let&#39;s test n=1:S₁ = a₁=1.Using formula: (1 -1)2^{2} +2 - [1*2]/2=0 +2 -1=1. Correct.n=2:a₁=1, a₂= (1 +1/1)a₁ +2*2¹=2*1 +4=6.So S₂=1 +6=7.Formula: (2 -1)2^{3} +2 - [2*3]/2=1*8 +2 -3=8 +2 -3=7. Correct.n=3:a₃=(1 +1/2)a₂ +3*2²= (3/2)*6 +12=9 +12=21.S₃=1 +6 +21=28.Formula: (3 -1)2⁴ +2 - [3*4]/2=2*16 +2 -6=32 +2 -6=28. Correct.n=4:a₄=(1 +1/3)a₃ +4*2³= (4/3)*21 +32=28 +32=60.S₄=1 +6 +21 +60=88.Formula: (4 -1)2⁵ +2 - [4*5]/2=3*32 +2 -10=96 +2 -10=88. Correct.So the formula works. Therefore, the sum S_n is given by:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2].But maybe we can write it in a more simplified form.Combine the constants:(n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2] = (n -1)2^{n+1} - [n(n +1)/2] +2.Alternatively, factor 2 from the first term and the constant:= 2[(n -1)2^{n} +1] - [n(n +1)/2].But this may not lead to a significant simplification. Alternatively, factor 2 from the entire expression:Multiply numerator and denominator to get a common denominator, perhaps.Let me write all terms with denominator 2:(n -1)2^{n+1} = 2(n -1)2ⁿ.So,S_n= 2(n -1)2ⁿ +2 - [n(n +1)/2] = [2(n -1)2ⁿ +4 -n(n +1)] /2.Wait, that&#39;s not quite. Wait:Wait, 2(n -1)2ⁿ is equal to (n -1)2^{n+1}. To combine all terms over 2:Express 2(n -1)2ⁿ as 2(n -1)2ⁿ * (2/2) = [4(n -1)2^{n -1}]/2.Wait, perhaps another approach.Alternatively, let&#39;s write all terms over 2:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2]= [2(n -1)2^{n} +4 -n(n +1)] /2Wait, yes:Because (n -1)2^{n+1} = 2(n -1)2ⁿ, so 2(n -1)2ⁿ is equal to (n -1)2^{n+1}.So:S_n = [2(n -1)2ⁿ +4 -n(n +1)] / 2.But 2(n -1)2ⁿ can be written as (n -1)2^{n+1}, so:= [ (n -1)2^{n+1} +4 -n(n +1) ] /2.Alternatively, factor 2 from the first two terms:= [ (n -1)2^{n+1} -n(n +1) +4 ] /2.But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps we can leave the answer as:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2}Alternatively, note that 2 can be written as 2^1, but that might not help.Alternatively, write the answer as:S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2} +2.Alternatively, check if there&#39;s another formula.Wait, another thought. Since a_n =n(2ⁿ -1), so S_n=Σ_{k=1}^n k2ᵏ - Σ_{k=1}^n k.We have already Σk2ᵏ= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2, and Σk= n(n +1)/2.So S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - n(n +1)/2.Alternatively, factor 2^{n+1} and constants:But perhaps this is as simplified as it can get. Let me check with another example.Take n=3: S_n=28.Formula: (3 -1)2^4 +2 -3*4/2=2*16 +2 -6=32+2-6=28. Correct.n=4: S_n=88.Formula: (4 -1)2^5 +2 -4*5/2=3*32 +2 -10=96+2-10=88. Correct.Therefore, the formula works, so maybe we can present the answer in this form.Alternatively, factor 2 from the first two terms:=2[(n -1)2ⁿ +1] - n(n +1)/2.But I think the most straightforward expression is S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2} +2.But let&#39;s verify with n=1 again:(n -1)=0, so first term is 0, then -1*2/2 +2= -1 +2=1. Correct.Therefore, the formula holds for all n≥1.Alternatively, write it as:S_n =2^{n+1}(n -1) +2 - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2}Alternatively, arrange terms:=2^{n+1}(n -1) - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2} +2.But since the problem asks for the sum of the first n terms, and we derived this expression, this is likely the answer.But maybe the problem expects a more simplified form or perhaps an expression in terms of 2^{n+1} and polynomials.Alternatively, we can write S_n = (n -1)2^{n+1} + 2 - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2}, which is acceptable.Alternatively, factor 2^{n+1} and constants:But perhaps there&#39;s another way to express Σk2ᵏ. Let me check another approach.Sum Σk2ᵏ from k=1 to n.Let me recall that the sum Σk r^k from k=0 to n is r(1 - (n +1)r^n +n r^{n +1}) / (1 - r)^2.Here, r=2, so substituting:Σk2ᵏ from k=0 to n =2(1 - (n +1)2ⁿ +n2^{n+1}) / (1 -2)^2Denominator: (1 -2)^2=1.Numerator:2[1 - (n +1)2ⁿ +n2^{n+1}]=2[1 - (n +1)2ⁿ +2n2ⁿ]=2[1 + (2n -n -1)2ⁿ]=2[1 + (n -1)2ⁿ]Therefore, Σk2ᵏ from k=0 to n=2[1 + (n -1)2ⁿ]But our sum starts at k=1, so subtract k=0 term which is 0*2⁰=0.Hence, Σk2ᵏ from k=1 to n=2[1 + (n -1)2ⁿ] as before. So same result.Therefore, I think the expression we have is correct, and S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2] is the answer.Alternatively, maybe combine terms:(n -1)2^{n+1} - (n² +n)/2 +2.Alternatively, factor something out. For example, 2^{n+1} is a term that grows exponentially, while the others are polynomial. Probably, the answer is expected in the form with separate terms.Therefore, the answer for part (I) is b_n=2ⁿ -1, and part (II) is S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - [n(n +1)/2].But let me check if the problem expects a factored form or a different arrangement.Wait, let&#39;s compute S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - n(n +1)/2. Maybe write 2^{n+1}(n -1) as n2^{n+1} -2^{n+1}, so:S_n= n2^{n+1} -2^{n+1} +2 -n(n +1)/2= n2^{n+1} -n(n +1)/2 -2^{n+1} +2.Alternatively, factor n from the first two terms:n[2^{n+1} - (n +1)/2] -2^{n+1} +2.But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, factor 2^n:n2^{n+1} =2n2ⁿ, and -2^{n+1}= -2*2ⁿ, so:=2n2ⁿ -2*2ⁿ -n(n +1)/2 +2=2ⁿ(2n -2) -n(n +1)/2 +2=2ⁿ*2(n -1) -n(n +1)/2 +2=2^{n+1}(n -1) -n(n +1)/2 +2.Which is the same as before. So, perhaps this is as simplified as it can be.Therefore, the answer is:(I) b_n=2ⁿ -1.(II) S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2} +2.Alternatively, expressed as:S_n= (n -1)2^{n+1} +2 - dfrac{n(n +1)}{2}Yes, that should be the answer. Let me confirm once more with n=2:(n -1)2^{3} +2 - (2*3)/2=1*8 +2 -3=8+2-3=7. Correct.So yes, that&#39;s correct.Final Answer(I) The general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) is (boxed{2^n - 1}).(II) The sum of the first (n) terms of the sequence ({a_n}) is (boxed{(n - 1)2^{n+1} + 2 - dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the sequence ({a_n}) with (a_1 = 1) and (a_{n+1} = left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)a_n + (n + 1) cdot 2^n):(I) Finding the general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) where (b_n = frac{a_n}{n}):1. Substitute (a_n = n b_n) into the recurrence relation:   [   a_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_n + (n + 1) cdot 2^n   ]2. Since (a_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_{n+1}), we get:   [   (n + 1) b_{n+1} = (n + 1) b_n + (n + 1) cdot 2^n   ]3. Dividing both sides by (n + 1) gives:   [   b_{n+1} = b_n + 2^n   ]4. This recurrence relation simplifies to a telescoping series. Solving it, we find:   [   b_n = 2^n - 1   ]Thus, the general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) is (boxed{2^n - 1}).(II) Finding the sum of the first (n) terms of the sequence ({a_n}), (S_n):1. Given (a_n = n b_n = n(2^n - 1)), the sum (S_n) is:   [   S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k = sum_{k=1}^n k(2^k - 1) = sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k - sum_{k=1}^n k   ]2. Using the formula for (sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k) and (sum_{k=1}^n k):   [   sum_{k=1}^n k 2^k = (n - 1)2^{n+1} + 2   ]   [   sum_{k=1}^n k = frac{n(n + 1)}{2}   ]3. Combining these results:   [   S_n = (n - 1)2^{n+1} + 2 - frac{n(n + 1)}{2}   ]Thus, the sum of the first (n) terms of the sequence ({a_n}) is (boxed{(n - 1)2^{n+1} + 2 - dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e1a50256></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>🔑:</span>Solution:  (I) From the given, we have dfrac {a_{n+1}}{n+1}= dfrac {a_n}{n}+2^n  therefore b_{n+1}=b_n+2^n, and b_1=a_1=1,  By using the method of accumulation, we can find the general formula for the sequence {b_n}:  therefore b_n=2^n-1 for ninmathbb{N}^*;  (II) From (I), we know a_n=ncdot 2^n-n,  therefore S_n=(1cdot 2+2cdot 2^2+3cdot 2^3+ldots+ncdot 2^n)-(1+2+3+ldots+n)  Since 1+2+3+ldots+n= dfrac {1}{2}n(n+1),  Let T_n=1cdot 2+2cdot 2^2+3cdot 2^3+ldots+ncdot 2^n (1)  Multiplying (1) by 2 gives 2T_n=1cdot 2^2+2cdot 2^3+3cdot 2^4+ldots+ncdot 2^{n+1} (2)  Subtracting (2) from (1) gives -T_n=2+2^2+2^3+ldots+2^n-ncdot 2^{n+1}= dfrac {2(1-2^n)}{1-2}-ncdot 2^{n+1}  =-2+(1-n)cdot 2^{n+1}, thus T_n=2+(n-1)cdot 2^{n+1}  therefore S_n=2+(n-1)cdot 2^{n+1}- dfrac {n(n+1)}{2}.

So, between the two ones, we put 1+1=2. Now the sequence is [1, 2, 1].Wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;at the ends of the segment, two ones are written. In the middle between them, their sum - the number 2 - is written.&quot; So initially, there&#39;s a segment with two ones. Then, between them, their sum is written. So after the first step, the numbers are [1, 2, 1]. Then, in the next step, between each pair of adjacent numbers, their sum is written again.So Step 2: Between 1 and 2, insert 1+2=3. Between 2 and 1, insert 2+1=3. So the sequence becomes [1, 3, 2, 3, 1].Step 3: Now insert sums between each adjacent pair.Between 1 and 3: 1+3=4Between 3 and 2: 3+2=5Between 2 and 3: 2+3=5Between 3 and 1: 3+1=4So the sequence becomes [1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1]Hmm, okay. So each step doubles the number of intervals, hence the number of elements increases by inserting sums. Wait, actually, if you start with n numbers, you insert (n-1) sums, so the total becomes n + (n-1) = 2n - 1. Let&#39;s check:Step 0: 2 numbersStep 1: 2*2 -1 = 3 numbersStep 2: 2*3 -1 = 5 numbersStep 3: 2*5 -1 = 9 numbersYes, that matches. So each time, the number of elements becomes 2n -1, where n was the previous count.But the problem is not about the number of elements, but how many times the number 1973 is written after 1973 steps.Wait, but 1973 steps? Let&#39;s check how the numbers are generated. Each step inserts the sum between every two adjacent numbers. So the numbers that appear are sums of pairs from the previous step.But the numbers generated seem to follow some pattern. Let&#39;s see the first few steps:Step 0: [1, 1]Step 1: [1, 2, 1]Step 2: [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]Step 3: [1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1]Step 4: Let&#39;s see:Between 1 and 4: 5Between 4 and 3: 7Between 3 and 5: 8Between 5 and 2: 7Between 2 and 5: 7Between 5 and 3: 8Between 3 and 4: 7Between 4 and 1: 5So sequence becomes [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1]Hmm, interesting. The numbers seem to be symmetric each time. Also, the numbers that appear are combinations of Fibonacci numbers? Maybe not exactly, but perhaps there&#39;s a relation.Alternatively, maybe we can model the numbers as coefficients in a binary tree or something. Each number is generated by the sum of its two neighbors from the previous step.Wait, but each number in the current step is adjacent to numbers from the previous step. Wait, actually, when we insert a sum between two numbers, the new number is adjacent to the left number and the right number in the next step. So the structure is like a binary tree?Alternatively, maybe the numbers generated can be related to combinations or binomial coefficients. Let me check.Looking at Step 1: [1,2,1] which is like 1, 2, 1. That&#39;s similar to row 2 of Pascal&#39;s triangle (if we start counting from row 0).Step 2: [1,3,2,3,1]. Hmm, not sure. If we look at the numbers, maybe not exactly binomial coefficients. Step 3: [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. Still not obvious.Wait, maybe the numbers correspond to the number of ways to reach a certain position in the structure? For example, in a binary tree, each node is the sum of its two children. But here, each new number is the sum of its two neighbors. So maybe each number is the number of paths from the root to that position?Alternatively, think of this as a structure similar to the Stern&#39;s diatomic sequence. Stern&#39;s diatomic sequence is defined by s(0) = 0, s(1) = 1, and for n ≥ 1, s(2n) = s(n) and s(2n + 1) = s(n) + s(n + 1). This sequence has the property that the nth term is the number of times the number n appears in the Calkin-Wilf tree. However, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s directly applicable here.Alternatively, let&#39;s think recursively. Each step, inserting sums between existing numbers. So if in step k, the sequence is [a1, a2, ..., an], then step k+1 is [a1, a1+a2, a2, a2+a3, a3, ..., an-1+an, an]. Therefore, each existing number in step k remains in step k+1, and between them, their sum is inserted.Therefore, every number that exists in step k is also present in step k+1, but new numbers (sums) are inserted between them. Therefore, the numbers from previous steps are preserved, and new numbers are added. So the numbers generated are cumulative. So the number 1973, once it appears, will be present in all subsequent steps. Therefore, the total number of times 1973 is written is equal to the number of times it is generated in any step up to step 1973.But wait, each time you insert a number, it&#39;s a sum. So the numbers that can appear are sums generated by previous numbers. Therefore, all numbers in the sequence are positive integers, and each number greater than 1 is a sum of two smaller numbers. So, similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but in a different structure.Wait, but how does 1973 get generated? It must be the sum of two numbers from the previous step. So, if 1973 is a prime number, then the only way to write it as a sum is 1 + 1972 or other pairs. Wait, but 1973 is actually a prime number. Let me check: 1973 divided by primes up to sqrt(1973) which is approx 44.4. So check primes up to 43. 1973 ÷ 2 = 986.5, not integer. ÷3: 1973/3 ≈ 657.666, not integer. ÷5: ends with 3, no. ÷7: 7*281=1967, 1973-1967=6, not divisible by 7. ÷11: 11*179=1969, 1973-1969=4, not divisible by 11. ÷13: 13*151=1963, 1973-1963=10, not divisible. ÷17: 17*116=1972, 1973-1972=1, so not divisible. ÷19: 19*103=1957, 1973-1957=16, not divisible. ÷23: 23*85=1955, 1973-1955=18, not divisible. ÷29: 29*68=1972, 1973-1972=1, not divisible. ÷31: 31*63=1953, 1973-1953=20, not divisible. ÷37: 37*53=1961, 1973-1961=12, not divisible. ÷41: 41*48=1968, 1973-1968=5, not divisible. ÷43: 43*45=1935, 1973-1935=38, not divisible. So 1973 is prime. Therefore, the only way to get 1973 as a sum is 1 + 1972 or another pair where one number is 1 and the other is 1972. But 1972 is even, and if we look at the sequence, the numbers generated are... Hmm, do we ever get 1972? Maybe. Wait, but 1972 is 4*493, so maybe 1972 can be generated through sums. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, maybe the numbers that appear in the sequence are all numbers of the form a*1 + b*2, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the sequence generates all positive integers, but in some order. Wait, but looking at the steps:Step 0: 1,1Step1: 1,2,1Step2:1,3,2,3,1Step3:1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1Step4:1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1So in step 4, numbers up to 8 are generated. It seems like each step introduces numbers that are sums of previous numbers. So over time, the numbers increase. But how do we get 1973?But the problem is, after 1973 steps, how many times the number 1973 is written. So perhaps 1973 is generated in some steps, and the count is cumulative.Alternatively, maybe each number that&#39;s generated has a certain number of occurrences based on the steps. Alternatively, maybe the number 1973 is generated exactly once in each step after a certain point, but this is not obvious.Wait, let&#39;s think recursively. Suppose that in each step, the numbers that are inserted are sums of adjacent pairs from the previous step. The existing numbers stay, so the numbers from previous steps are preserved, and new numbers are inserted. Therefore, once a number is inserted, it remains in all subsequent steps. However, in the next step, when inserting sums between numbers, existing numbers can be adjacent to new numbers, leading to new sums. So for example, once we have 1 and 2, we can get 3, then in the next step, between 1 and 3 we get 4, between 3 and 2 we get 5, etc. So each new number is a sum of two numbers from the previous step.But since the numbers are preserved, once 1973 is written, it stays in all subsequent steps. Therefore, the total number of times 1973 is written is equal to the number of steps in which 1973 is generated as a new number. Because once it&#39;s generated in a step, it remains in all subsequent steps. Wait, but actually, when you insert numbers between existing numbers, the existing numbers remain. So the numbers are never removed, only added. So each time a number is inserted, it&#39;s a new number. Wait, no. Wait, for example, in step 1, we have 1,2,1. Then in step 2, we insert 3 between 1 and 2, and 3 between 2 and 1. So now, in step 2, the numbers are 1,3,2,3,1. So the number 3 is inserted twice. Then in step 3, between 1 and 3: 4, between 3 and 2:5, between 2 and 3:5, between 3 and 1:4. So inserted numbers are 4,5,5,4. So the numbers 4 and 5 are inserted. Then in step 4, between those numbers, we get higher numbers. So each step inserts numbers that are sums of adjacent numbers from the previous step, so each inserted number is a sum of two numbers, which may or may not have been present before.But in this process, numbers can be generated multiple times. For example, the number 3 is inserted twice in step 2, so in subsequent steps, those 3s remain. Similarly, in step 3, the number 5 is inserted twice. So numbers can be generated multiple times in different positions.Therefore, the count of a particular number like 1973 would be the number of times it is inserted in any step up to step 1973. Because once it&#39;s inserted, it remains in all subsequent steps. So we need to find how many times 1973 is inserted as a new number in the first 1973 steps.So the problem reduces to: how many times is 1973 generated as the sum of two adjacent numbers in the sequence during the insertion process over 1973 steps.Therefore, we need to find the number of times 1973 is generated as a sum of two adjacent numbers in the steps from 1 to 1973.But how can we model this? Maybe using the concept of generations. Each number is born in a certain step when it is first inserted. Then, when two numbers from previous steps are adjacent, their sum is inserted in the next step.Wait, but even if two numbers are adjacent in step k, their sum is inserted in step k+1. Therefore, each insertion is a result of two adjacent numbers in the previous step. Therefore, the number of times a number N is generated is equal to the number of times two numbers a and b such that a + b = N are adjacent in some step before step 1973.But this seems difficult to track. Alternatively, maybe the number of times a number is generated is related to the number of ways it can be expressed as a sum of numbers from previous generations. But this is vague.Alternatively, since the sequence is symmetric, perhaps the number of times a number is generated is related to its position in the Farey sequence or something like that. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, perhaps the number of times a number N is written is equal to the number of times it appears in the Calkin-Wilf tree, which is known to be the number of ways to represent N as a sum in certain ways. However, this might be a stretch.Wait, another angle: the sequence generated is similar to the Farey sequence when considering mediants. In the Farey sequence, when you insert the mediant of two adjacent fractions, you generate a new fraction. The mediant of a/b and c/d is (a+c)/(b+d). However, in our problem, instead of inserting the mediant, we insert the sum. But perhaps there&#39;s a connection.Alternatively, if we consider the numbers as numerators of fractions with denominator 1, then inserting the sum is like inserting the mediant. But not exactly. Because the mediant of 1/1 and 1/1 is 2/2, which simplifies to 1/1, but in our problem, inserting the sum gives 2, which is different.Alternatively, perhaps this process is similar to building a binary tree where each node is the sum of its two children. For example, starting from the root as 2, with children 1 and 1. Then, each node&#39;s children are the numbers that sum to it. But in our case, the process is more like building the tree level by level, inserting sums between existing numbers.Alternatively, think of the numbers as nodes in a graph where edges represent the sum operation. But this might complicate things.Alternatively, think of each number as being generated by a certain number of pairs. For a number N, the number of times it is generated is equal to the number of distinct pairs (a, b) such that a + b = N and a and b are adjacent in some step before step 1973. Each such pair would generate N in the next step. However, tracking this over 1973 steps is challenging.But maybe there&#39;s a pattern in the number of occurrences. Let&#39;s look at small numbers and their counts.Looking back at the steps:Step 0: [1, 1] – counts: 1:2Step 1: [1, 2, 1] – counts: 1:2, 2:1Step 2: [1, 3, 2, 3, 1] – counts: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2Step 3: [1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1] – counts: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:2, 5:2Step 4: [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1] – counts: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:2, 5:4, 7:4, 8:2Hmm, interesting. So the counts for numbers:After step 0: 1 appears 2 times.After step 1: 1 still appears 2 times, 2 appears once.After step 2: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2.After step 3: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:2, 5:2.After step 4: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:2, 5:4, 7:4, 8:2.Wait, so the count for 5 increased from 2 in step 3 to 4 in step 4. How?In step 3, we had [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. Then, inserting sums:Between 1 and 4:5, so 5 is inserted once.Between 4 and 3:7, inserted once.Between 3 and 5:8, inserted once.Between 5 and 2:7, inserted once.Between 2 and 5:7, inserted once.Between 5 and 3:8, inserted once.Between 3 and 4:7, inserted once.Between 4 and 1:5, inserted once.So in step 4, the inserted numbers are 5,7,8,7,7,8,7,5. So two 5s, four 7s, and two 8s. Then, the existing numbers from step 3 are still present: 1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1. So adding the inserted numbers, in step 4, the counts are:1:2 (from original ends)2:1 (original 2 remains)3:2 (original 3s)4:2 (original 4s)5: original two 5s plus two inserted 5s, total 47: four inserted 7s8: two inserted 8sSo counts make sense.So in step 4, the count for 5 increased by 2 because it was inserted twice. Similarly, 7 was inserted four times, and 8 twice.So how do numbers get inserted multiple times? Each occurrence of a pair (a, b) such that a + b = N will insert N once between them in the next step. Therefore, the number of times N is inserted in step k+1 is equal to the number of adjacent pairs (a, b) in step k where a + b = N. Then, in step k+1, N is inserted between each such pair, and once inserted, remains in all subsequent steps.Therefore, the total count of N after step 1973 is equal to the number of times N was inserted in any step from 1 to 1973.Therefore, to find the number of times 1973 is written, we need to find the number of times 1973 was inserted in steps 1 through 1973. Each insertion corresponds to a pair of adjacent numbers in the previous step that sum to 1973.So the problem reduces to: how many times does the pair (a, b) with a + b = 1973 appear as adjacent numbers in the sequence during the first 1973 steps.But how to compute this?First, note that 1973 is a prime number. So the only pairs that sum to 1973 are (1, 1972), (2, 1971), ..., (986, 987). But since all numbers in the sequence are positive integers, all these pairs are possible in theory, but whether they actually appear in the sequence is another question.But in reality, the numbers generated in the sequence follow a certain structure. For example, starting from 1s and 2, the numbers generated are combinations of previous numbers. The key insight might be that each number in the sequence can be represented in terms of continued fractions or something similar.Alternatively, since the process is similar to the generation of the Calkin-Wilf tree, where each node is a positive rational number generated by inserting the mediant between two adjacent terms. However, in our case, we are dealing with integers, and inserting sums instead of mediants.Wait, another thought: The numbers generated in this process are actually the denominators of the fractions in the Farey sequence when considering mediants, but scaled up. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, think of the numbers in terms of binary representations. Each step corresponds to a deeper level of binary tree, with each insertion corresponding to a node. However, this might not directly help.Alternatively, note that each number in the sequence can be associated with a binary string representing its position in the tree. Each insertion corresponds to a bit in the string. But I don&#39;t know.Alternatively, since 1973 is a prime number, the number of times it is generated is related to the number of ways to write 1973 as a sum of numbers generated in previous steps, which could be linked to the number of coprime pairs that sum to 1973. Wait, because in the Calkin-Wilf tree, each positive rational number appears exactly once, and the number of times a number appears in certain sequences can relate to Euler&#39;s totient function. However, this is speculative.Wait, maybe the number of times a prime number p is generated in this process is equal to φ(p), Euler&#39;s totient function, which is p - 1 for prime p. But φ(1973) = 1972. But in our earlier steps, for example, the number 5 is generated twice in step 3, and then four times in step 4, which seems more than φ(5)=4. Wait, φ(5)=4, which matches the number of times 5 is inserted in step 4. Wait, in step 3, 5 is inserted twice. Wait, maybe not exactly.Alternatively, if we look at the number of coprime pairs (a, b) such that a + b = N. For prime N, since N is prime, all pairs (k, N - k) where k and N - k are coprime. Since N is prime, gcd(k, N - k) = gcd(k, N). Since N is prime, gcd(k, N) is 1 if k ≠ N, which it isn&#39;t because k &lt; N. Therefore, all pairs (k, N - k) where 1 ≤ k ≤ N - 1 are coprime. Therefore, there are N - 1 such pairs. But for our case, N=1973 is prime, so there are 1972 coprime pairs that sum to 1973. However, each such pair would correspond to an occurrence of 1973 being inserted. But in our process, the numbers generated are in a specific structure, so not all pairs (k, 1973 - k) may be adjacent in some step.But in the Calkin-Wilf tree, each coprime pair (a, b) appears exactly once, which would mean that each sum a + b = 1973 where a and b are coprime would be generated exactly once. Therefore, if this process is similar to the Calkin-Wilf tree, then the number of times 1973 is generated is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a, b) with a + b = 1973, which is φ(1973) = 1972. However, in our earlier example with N=5, which is prime, we saw that 5 was inserted twice in step 2 and then two more times in step 3, leading to a total of 4 times by step 3. Which is φ(5)=4. So maybe that&#39;s the case. For prime numbers, the number of times they are inserted in all steps up to step k is φ(p) = p - 1. But in our example with p=5, by step 3, it was inserted 4 times, which is φ(5)=4. Similarly, for p=3, which is also prime, in step 2 it was inserted twice (φ(3)=2). For p=2, which is prime, inserted once in step 1, φ(2)=1.Similarly, for p=7, which is prime, in step 4, it was inserted four times, but φ(7)=6. Hmm, this contradicts. Wait, in step 4, we have 7 inserted four times, but φ(7)=6, which is different. So maybe my previous thought is incorrect.Wait, step 4 for N=7: inserted four times. However, φ(7)=6. So this doesn&#39;t align. Therefore, perhaps the number of insertions isn&#39;t exactly φ(N).Alternatively, maybe the number of insertions is related to the number of times a number can be expressed as a sum of consecutive numbers in the previous steps, but it&#39;s unclear.Alternatively, note that each time a number is inserted, it&#39;s between two numbers that sum to it. So for a prime number p, since all pairs summing to p are coprime (as p is prime), each pair (k, p -k) is coprime. In the Calkin-Wilf tree, each coprime pair occurs exactly once. Therefore, if our process is generating each coprime pair exactly once, then the number of times p is inserted is equal to φ(p). But in our earlier example with p=5, we had two insertions in step 3 and two insertions in step 4, totaling four insertions, which is φ(5)=4. Similarly, in step 4, for p=7, we had four insertions, but φ(7)=6. Wait, that doesn&#39;t match. So maybe this logic isn&#39;t correct.Alternatively, maybe each coprime pair (a, b) with a + b = p is generated exactly once in the entire process, but not necessarily within the first k steps. Since we are limited to 1973 steps, maybe not all coprime pairs have been generated yet. Therefore, the number of insertions of p in the first k steps is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a, b) with a + b = p that have been generated in those steps.But this seems too vague. Maybe there&#39;s a better way.Wait, let&#39;s look at how a number N is generated. For N to be inserted between a and b, a and b must be adjacent in some step, and their sum is N. Once inserted, N remains in all subsequent steps. Then, in future steps, N can be adjacent to other numbers, leading to sums involving N.But for prime N=1973, the only way it can be inserted is as the sum of 1 and 1972, 2 and 1971, etc., up to 986 and 987. But in order for these pairs to exist, both numbers in the pair must have been generated in previous steps.However, since we start with 1 and 1, and each step generates sums of existing numbers, the numbers generated are all positive integers, but the exact timing when each number is generated depends on the previous steps.But given that the process is carried out for 1973 steps, which is a large number, it&#39;s possible that all numbers up to a certain size have been generated. However, 1973 is quite large, so even after 1973 steps, it&#39;s unclear if numbers as large as 1972 have been generated.Alternatively, maybe the numbers generated follow a pattern where each number n is generated at step equal to the number of ones in their binary representation or something like that. But this is just a guess.Alternatively, think recursively about the generation of numbers. Each number greater than 1 is generated as the sum of two smaller numbers. Therefore, the generation of a number N is dependent on the generation of all pairs of numbers that sum to N. However, the order in which numbers are generated could be complex.But since we need to find the number of times 1973 is written after 1973 steps, perhaps the answer is related to the number of coprime pairs (a, b) summing to 1973, which is φ(1973) = 1972. But why 1972?Wait, but if 1973 is prime, then there are 1972 coprime pairs (k, 1973 - k) for k from 1 to 1972. Each such coprime pair would correspond to an insertion of 1973 once. However, in our process, each insertion happens in a specific step, and the pair (a, b) must be adjacent in some step before step 1973. However, not all coprime pairs might have been adjacent in the steps up to 1973.But considering that each step allows for the generation of new numbers, and given 1973 steps, it&#39;s possible that all coprime pairs have had enough time to be generated.Alternatively, in the Calkin-Wilf tree, every positive rational number appears exactly once, which implies that every coprime pair (a, b) is adjacent in some row of the tree. Translating to our problem, if we consider each step as a row in the tree, then every coprime pair (a, b) would be adjacent in some step, and hence their sum would be inserted in the next step. Therefore, the number of times a prime number p is inserted is equal to φ(p), as each coprime pair (k, p - k) is adjacent in some step, leading to p being inserted φ(p) times.But in our case, the number of steps is 1973. However, the Calkin-Wilf tree has infinitely many steps, so to generate all coprime pairs, you need infinitely many steps. But since we have 1973 steps, does that mean that all coprime pairs summing to 1973 would have been generated by step 1973?Alternatively, the number of steps required to generate a coprime pair (a, b) is related to the depth of that pair in the Calkin-Wilf tree. The depth might be related to the sum a + b. For a + b = 1973, the depth required might be up to 1973, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, since each step corresponds to inserting sums between all adjacent pairs, the depth of a number in the binary tree is equal to the step in which it was generated. The root is step 0: 1,1. The first insertion is step 1:2. Then step 2 inserts 3,3. Step 3 inserts 4,5,5,4. Step 4 inserts 5,7,8,7,7,8,7,5. So each number&#39;s generation step is equal to the number of times you need to apply the sum operation from the initial 1s.But for a number like 1973, which is the sum of 1 and 1972, and assuming 1972 was generated in step 1972, then 1973 would be generated in step 1973. Similarly, 1972 would be generated in step 1972, which would be the sum of 1 and 1971, generated in step 1971, and so on. However, this would imply that the number 1973 is generated only once in step 1973, as the sum of 1 and 1972, which themselves were generated in prior steps.But this line of reasoning suggests that each number n is generated in step n-1. But this can&#39;t be right because in step 1, we generate 2, which is 1+1. In step 2, we generate 3, which is 1+2. Step 3 generates 4 (1+3), 5 (3+2), etc. So the generation step of a number is roughly equal to the number itself minus 1. But for example, 3 is generated in step 2, which is 3-1=2. 4 is generated in step 3=4-1. 5 is generated in step 3, which is less than 5-1=4. Wait, so this pattern doesn&#39;t hold. 5 is generated in step 3, but 5-1=4. So perhaps it&#39;s not linear.Alternatively, maybe the step in which a number is generated is equal to the number of ones in their binary representation or some other measure. Alternatively, since each number is a sum of previous numbers, the generation step might be related to the logarithm of the number. But this is unclear.Given that this line of thinking isn&#39;t yielding progress, perhaps we need to look for a mathematical pattern or formula.In the problem&#39;s structure, each insertion corresponds to a node in a binary tree, where each node has a value equal to the sum of its two children. The total number of times a number N appears is equal to the number of times it is the sum of two adjacent numbers in the previous step, which is equivalent to the number of times it is a parent node in the binary tree.In such a tree, the number of times a number N appears is related to the number of ways to write N as a sum of two numbers that are connected in the tree. For prime numbers, this might correspond to the number of coprime pairs, but as discussed earlier.Alternatively, consider that each number N can be generated in φ(N) ways as the sum of two coprime numbers. Since 1973 is prime, all pairs (k, 1973 - k) where k ranges from 1 to 1972 are coprime. Hence, there are 1972 such pairs. Therefore, if each coprime pair is generated exactly once in the process, then the number 1973 would be written 1972 times. However, in our earlier example with 5, which is prime, we saw that 5 was inserted twice in step 2 and twice in step 3, totaling 4 times, which is φ(5) = 4. Similarly, for 3, which is prime, it was inserted twice in step 2, which is φ(3) = 2. For 2, inserted once in step 1, which is φ(2) = 1. For 7, which is prime, inserted four times in step 4, but φ(7) = 6. Wait, discrepancy here. So perhaps the pattern holds for some primes but not others.Wait, in step 4, we have four insertions of 7, but φ(7) = 6. So maybe not all coprime pairs have been generated by step 4. So the number of insertions is less than φ(N) if N is large. Therefore, the number of times a prime number p is inserted in k steps is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a, b) with a + b = p that have been generated within k steps.Since the problem asks for the number of times 1973 is written after 1973 steps, we need to find how many of the coprime pairs (k, 1973 - k) have been generated within 1973 steps.But how can we determine how many such pairs have been generated? Perhaps each coprime pair (a, b) is generated in a number of steps equal to the sum of their generation steps. Wait, this is too vague.Alternatively, think of the process as building a binary tree where each node is labeled by its value, and each level of the tree corresponds to a step. The root is level 0 with value 2. Level 1 has two nodes: 1 and 1 (from the original ends). Wait, no, the initial step is [1,1], then inserting 2 in the middle. Maybe the tree is built such that each number is a node, and its children are the two numbers that sum to it. But this is similar to the Calkin-Wilf tree, where each node has two children. In the Calkin-Wilf tree, each node a/b has children a/(a+b) and (a+b)/b. However, in our case, the numbers are sums, not mediants.Alternatively, if we model each number as being generated by its parents, then the depth of a number in the tree could correspond to the step in which it is generated. For example:- The numbers 1 are at depth 0 (original numbers).- The number 2 is generated at depth 1 from 1 and 1.- The number 3 is generated at depth 2 from 1 and 2.- The numbers 4 and 5 are generated at depth 3: 4 from 1 and 3, 5 from 3 and 2.- The numbers 5, 7, 8, 7, etc., are generated at depth 4.So each number&#39;s depth is equal to the number of steps required to generate it. So the depth of a number N is the minimum number of steps required to generate it starting from 1s.For example:- Depth 1: 2- Depth 2: 3- Depth 3: 4,5- Depth 4: 5,7,8Wait, but 5 is generated at depth 3 and also at depth 4. So maybe depth corresponds to the earliest step in which a number is generated.But for our problem, we need to know all pairs (a, b) that sum to 1973 and have been generated by step 1973. Since 1973 is prime, all pairs (k, 1973 -k) are coprime. In the Calkin-Wilf tree, each coprime pair appears exactly once, and the depth of a pair (a, b) is related to the sum a + b. Specifically, the depth might be proportional to a + b. If that&#39;s the case, then to generate a pair (a, b) with a + b = 1973, the required depth would be 1973. However, since we are only performing 1973 steps, it&#39;s possible that each coprime pair (a, b) with a + b = 1973 is generated exactly once in step 1973.Wait, but step 1973 would correspond to depth 1973. If each pair (a, b) with a + b = N is generated at depth N, then in step 1973, we would generate all such pairs. Therefore, the number of times 1973 is written is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a, b) with a + b = 1973, which is φ(1973) = 1972. Hence, the answer is 1972.But in our earlier example with N=5, which is generated in step 3 (depth 3), φ(5)=4, but in step 3, we only inserted two 5s, and in step 4, two more. So maybe each coprime pair is generated in step equal to their sum. For N=5, the sum is 5, so in step 5, but we saw 5 generated earlier. This contradicts.Alternatively, maybe the number of times a prime number p is generated in the first p steps is φ(p). If we run the process for p steps, then the number of times p is generated is φ(p). For example, for p=5, φ(5)=4. If we run the process for 5 steps, how many times is 5 generated?Let&#39;s simulate:Step 0: [1,1]Step 1: [1,2,1]Step 2: [1,3,2,3,1]Step 3: [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]Step 4: [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1]Step 5: Let&#39;s insert sums between each pair:Between 1 and 5:6Between 5 and 4:9Between 4 and 7:11Between 7 and 3:10Between 3 and 8:11Between 8 and 5:13Between 5 and 7:12Between 7 and 2:9Between 2 and 7:9Between 7 and 5:12Between 5 and 8:13Between 8 and 3:11Between 3 and 7:10Between 7 and 4:11Between 4 and 5:9Between 5 and 1:6So step 5 inserts numbers:6,9,11,10,11,13,12,9,9,12,13,11,10,11,9,6.So counts for 5 in step 5: existing 5s from step 4 are [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1]. So 5 appears four times. The inserted numbers don&#39;t include 5. So after step 5, the count for 5 is still four. So even after step 5, which is equal to p=5, the count is 4, which is φ(5)=4. So maybe in step p, the number of times a prime p is generated is φ(p). But in our case, after step 5, the count for 5 is still 4, which was generated in steps 3 and 4. Therefore, the total count by step p=5 is φ(p)=4. So maybe the answer is that after 1973 steps, the number 1973 is written φ(1973)=1972 times.Thus, the answer is boxed{1972}.&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves starting with two ones at the ends of a segment and repeatedly inserting the sum between each pair of adjacent numbers. After 1973 steps, we need to determine how many times the number 1973 will be written.1. Initial Steps Analysis:   - Step 0: [1, 1]   - Step 1: [1, 2, 1]   - Step 2: [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]   - Step 3: [1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1]   - Each step inserts sums between adjacent numbers, preserving existing numbers and adding new ones.2. Key Observations:   - Each number generated is a sum of two adjacent numbers from the previous step.   - Once a number is inserted, it remains in all subsequent steps.   - The number 1973 is a prime number, meaning it can only be expressed as a sum of coprime pairs (k, 1973 - k).3. Coprimality and Generation:   - For a prime number ( p ), there are ( phi(p) = p - 1 ) coprime pairs (k, p - k) where ( 1 leq k leq p - 1 ).   - Each coprime pair (k, 1973 - k) will generate the number 1973 exactly once when they become adjacent in some step.4. Conclusion:   - The number 1973, being prime, will be generated by each of the 1972 coprime pairs (k, 1973 - k).   - After 1973 steps, all such pairs would have been generated, leading to 1972 instances of the number 1973.Thus, the number of times the number 1973 is written after 1973 steps is (boxed{1972}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we start with a segment. At the ends, there are two ones written. Then, in the middle between them, we write their sum, which is 2. Then, between each pair of adjacent numbers, we again write their sums, and this process is repeated 1973 times. The question is, how many times will the number 1973 be written?Hmm. Let me start by trying to visualize the process step by step. Maybe if I work through a few iterations manually, I can spot a pattern.First iteration (n=0? or n=1? Let&#39;s clarify). Let&#39;s say initially, we have two 1s at the ends. Let&#39;s call that step 0. Then, step 1: insert their sum in the middle, so now we have [1, 2, 1]. Step 2: insert sums between each pair. Between 1 and 2: 1+2=3; between 2 and 1: 2+1=3. So now we have [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]. Step 3: insert sums again. Let&#39;s see:Between 1 and 3: 4; 3 and 2: 5; 2 and 3: 5; 3 and 1: 4. So now it&#39;s [1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1]. Hmm. Wait, but maybe I should check that again.Wait, inserting the sum between each adjacent pair. Let me do step 1 to step 3 again to be sure.Start: [1, 1] (step 0)Step 1: insert 1+1=2 between them: [1, 2, 1]Step 2: insert sums between 1 and 2, and 2 and 1. So 1+2=3 and 2+1=3. So [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]Step 3: Now insert sums between each pair. So between 1 and 3: 4, 3 and 2: 5, 2 and 3: 5, 3 and 1: 4. So [1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1]Step 4: Next step, inserting between each pair again. So between 1 and 4: 5, 4 and 3: 7, 3 and 5: 8, 5 and 2: 7, 2 and 5: 7, 5 and 3: 8, 3 and 4: 7, 4 and 1: 5. So the sequence becomes: [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1]. That&#39;s step 4.Hmm. Each step, the numbers are getting larger. But how does this relate to 1973? The process is done 1973 times, so after 1973 steps, how many times does 1973 appear?Wait, but 1973 is a pretty large number. Maybe it&#39;s prime? Let me check. 1973 divided by... let&#39;s see. 1973 is a prime number. Let me confirm that. Hmm, 1973 is indeed a prime number. That might be important.But how does this process generate numbers? Each number in the next step is the sum of two adjacent numbers from the previous step. So, essentially, this is similar to building a binary tree where each node is the sum of its two children. Wait, but actually, each step inserts new numbers between existing ones, so the structure is more like a linear sequence where each insertion doubles the number of intervals. Wait, starting with 2 numbers (1 and 1), each step inserts numbers in between, so the number of numbers in the sequence after n steps is 2^n + 1. Wait, let&#39;s check:Step 0: 2 numbers.Step 1: 3 numbers.Step 2: 5 numbers.Step 3: 9 numbers.Step 4: 17 numbers.Yes, that&#39;s 2^n + 1. So step n has 2^n + 1 numbers. For example, step 0: 2^1 +1? Wait, step 0: 2 numbers, which is 2^1 +0? Wait, maybe the formula is 2^{n} +1. Wait, step 1: 3 = 2^1 +1? 2^1 is 2, plus1 is 3. Step 2: 5 = 2^2 +1? 4+1=5. Step3: 9=2^3 +1=8+1=9. Yes, so step n has 2^{n} +1 numbers. Wait, actually, step 0 would be 2 numbers, which is 2^1 +0, but maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the number of intervals. Wait, each step doubles the number of intervals. Initially, step 0: 1 interval. Step1: 2 intervals. Step2:4 intervals. Step3:8 intervals. So the number of intervals is 2^n, hence the number of numbers is 2^n +1. So, yeah, after 1973 steps, the number of numbers is 2^{1973} +1. But that&#39;s an astronomically huge number, so enumerating them is impossible. Therefore, the answer must be found through some pattern or mathematical property.We need to find how many times 1973 is written after 1973 steps. Since 1973 is a prime number, maybe its occurrence relates to some number-theoretic properties.Alternatively, perhaps the numbers generated in this process are related to combinations or binomial coefficients. Let me think. Each time we insert the sum between two numbers, which is their sum. So, the process is similar to building a structure where each number is the sum of the two numbers adjacent to it in the previous step. Wait, but actually, each insertion is the sum of the two numbers it&#39;s between, so the numbers in the sequence after several steps might correspond to binomial coefficients. Let me check.For example, in step 1: [1,2,1]. That&#39;s similar to the coefficients of (a + b)^2: 1,2,1.Step 2: [1,3,2,3,1]. Hmm, but the coefficients of (a + b)^3 are 1,3,3,1. Not quite the same. Wait, step 2 here is inserting 3 between 1 and 2, and another 3 between 2 and 1. So the sequence is 1,3,2,3,1. So not exactly binomial coefficients.Step3: [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. Hmm. If we look at the middle number, it&#39;s 2. The numbers to the left and right are symmetric. But it&#39;s not clear.Alternatively, maybe each number in the sequence can be represented as combinations with certain properties. For instance, in the first step, 1,2,1. Then inserting sums: between 1 and 2 is 3, which is 1+2, and between 2 and1 is 3. So step2 is 1,3,2,3,1. Then step3: between each pair, so 1+3=4, 3+2=5, 2+3=5, 3+1=4. So step3: 1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1.Wait, if we look at step n, the numbers might correspond to the number of ways to traverse from the original endpoints through the inserted numbers. Maybe similar to Pascal&#39;s triangle, but arranged in a linear fashion. Alternatively, maybe each number is the number of paths from the left or right end to that position, considering some steps. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps each number is a Fibonacci number or something similar, but the numbers seem to grow faster. Wait, in step 3, we have a 5, which is a Fibonacci number, but also 4. Maybe not.Alternatively, think of this as a graph where each number is the sum of its neighbors from the previous step. So in step 1, the middle number is the sum of the two ones. In step 2, the new numbers between 1 and 2 is 3 (1+2), and between 2 and1 is 3. Then in step3, between 1 and3 is 4, 3 and2 is5, etc. So each time, the numbers are the sum of their immediate neighbors from the prior step.Wait, this seems similar to a structure where each number in the current step is the sum of the two numbers adjacent to its position in the previous step. Wait, but how exactly?Wait, let&#39;s think recursively. Suppose after k steps, the sequence is S_k. Then, to get S_{k+1}, we insert between each pair of adjacent numbers in S_k their sum. So, for example, S_0 = [1,1]. S_1 = [1,2,1]. S_2 = [1,3,2,3,1]. So each new number is the sum of the two numbers it is between. So, if we think of the positions in S_{k+1}, they are the original numbers from S_k and the inserted sums. So, each original number in S_k is now flanked by the inserted sums. So, in S_{k+1}, each original number from S_k is still present, and between them are the sums.Wait, so if we index the positions in S_k as 0 to 2^k. Then, in S_{k+1}, the positions would be 0 to 2^{k+1}, with the original numbers at even indices and the new sums at odd indices. So, for example, in S_1: [1,2,1], positions 0,1,2. Then S_2: positions 0,1,2,3,4. The original numbers from S_1 are at positions 0,2,4, which are even, and the new sums at 1,3, which are odd. Similarly, in S_3: positions 0 to 8. Original numbers from S_2 at even positions 0,2,4,6,8, and inserted sums at odd positions. So the original numbers are preserved, and the inserted numbers are the sums of their neighbors.So, in general, each number in S_k at position i (even position in S_{k+1}) is preserved, and between them, at odd positions, the sum of the adjacent numbers.Therefore, if we track the numbers over time, each original number remains in all subsequent sequences, but new numbers are inserted between them. So, the numbers that are inserted in step k are sums of pairs from step k-1.Wait, but how does this help in finding how many times 1973 is written after 1973 steps?Perhaps we need to consider that each time a number is inserted, it&#39;s the sum of two adjacent numbers. So, 1973 could be written multiple times if it can be expressed as the sum of two numbers in the previous step, which themselves are sums from prior steps, etc.But 1973 is a prime number, so the only way to express it as a sum is 1 + 1972, 2 + 1971, ..., 986 + 987. But since we are starting with 1s and 2s, maybe the numbers generated are combinations that can add up to 1973 in certain steps.Alternatively, perhaps the number 1973 can only be generated in specific positions and specific steps. For instance, since the numbers increase each step, maybe 1973 first appears at a certain step, and then continues to appear in subsequent steps. The question is, how many times does it appear in total after 1973 steps.Alternatively, since each number is formed by the sum of two adjacent numbers from the previous step, the numbers generated are all possible sums that can be formed by adding adjacent numbers recursively starting from 1 and 1.Wait, but starting from 1 and 1, the next numbers are 2, then 3, then 4,5, etc. So, potentially, all natural numbers can be generated given enough steps. However, the question is, how many times 1973 is generated over 1973 steps.But considering that each time we insert a number, we can get new numbers, but once a number is inserted, it remains in all subsequent steps (since numbers are never removed, only inserted between existing ones). Wait, no. Wait, when we insert a number between two existing numbers, the existing numbers remain. So for example, in step 1: [1,2,1]. The original 1s are still there. Then step2: [1,3,2,3,1]. The original 1, 2, 1 are still present. So, all numbers from previous steps are preserved. So, once a number is written, it stays in all future steps. Therefore, if the number 1973 is written in step k, then it will be present in all steps from k to 1973, so the number of times it&#39;s written is equal to the number of times it&#39;s generated in each step from its first occurrence to step 1973.Wait, but actually, each step inserts numbers between existing numbers, but the existing numbers stay. So each number is part of all subsequent steps. Therefore, once 1973 is written in some position, that position remains in all later steps, so 1973 would be written once for each time it was inserted in any step. Wait, but actually, no. Wait, each step only inserts numbers between existing numbers; once a number is written, it&#39;s never moved or changed. So, for example, the initial 1s are always there. The 2 inserted in step1 is always there. The 3s inserted in step2 are always there. So, the numbers themselves are fixed once written, and each step adds new numbers in between. Therefore, the total count of a number like 1973 would be the number of times it was inserted in any step up to step1973.Therefore, to find the total number of times 1973 is written, we need to find how many times 1973 is inserted as a sum in any of the steps from 1 to 1973.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of times 1973 is generated as a sum of two adjacent numbers in the sequence during any of the 1973 steps.So, we need to find, for each step from 1 to 1973, how many adjacent pairs in the sequence at that step sum to 1973. Then, sum those counts over all steps.But how can we compute that?Alternatively, note that once a number is inserted, it stays in all subsequent steps. So, for 1973 to be inserted in step k, there must be a pair of adjacent numbers in step k-1 that sum to 1973. Each such pair will result in 1973 being inserted between them in step k. Then, in step k, the 1973 is present, but in subsequent steps, since we only insert numbers between existing pairs, the existing 1973s will stay, but new 1973s can be inserted next to them if their neighbors sum to 1973.Wait, but once 1973 is inserted in step k, in step k+1, we can insert numbers between 1973 and its neighbors. For example, if 1973 is between a and b in step k, then in step k+1, we insert a+1973 between a and 1973, and 1973 + b between 1973 and b. So, unless a+1973 or 1973 + b equals 1973, which would require a or b to be zero, which they aren&#39;t since all numbers are positive, we don&#39;t get new 1973s next to existing 1973s. Therefore, once 1973 is inserted in step k, it remains in all subsequent steps, but no new 1973s are generated adjacent to it. Therefore, the only way a new 1973 can be generated is from a pair of numbers in some step that sum to 1973, not involving an existing 1973.Therefore, the total number of times 1973 is written is equal to the number of times a pair of numbers in the sequence at any step from 0 to 1972 (since we need a step before 1973 to insert 1973 in the next step) sum to 1973.So, in order to find the total number of 1973s, we need to find, for each step from 0 to 1972, the number of adjacent pairs in that step&#39;s sequence that sum to 1973. Each such pair will result in a 1973 being inserted in the next step, and that 1973 will persist in all subsequent steps. Therefore, the total number of 1973s is equal to the total number of such pairs across all steps from 0 to 1972.But how do we compute the number of pairs summing to 1973 in each step?This seems complex. Let me consider smaller cases. Let&#39;s say we want to find the number of times a small number like 2 or 3 is written after a few steps.For example, how many times is the number 2 written after 2 steps?Original steps:Step0: [1,1]Step1: [1,2,1]Step2: [1,3,2,3,1]So, in step1, 2 is written once. In step2, the original 2 remains, but no new 2s are added because there are no pairs that sum to 2. So total 2s:1.Similarly, for number 3:In step2, two 3s are inserted. Then, in step3, those 3s remain, and are there in all subsequent steps. But in step3, we can have new 3s only if there are pairs summing to 3 in step2&#39;s sequence. Step2&#39;s sequence is [1,3,2,3,1]. The adjacent pairs are (1,3), (3,2), (2,3), (3,1). Their sums are 4,5,5,4. So no pairs sum to 3. Therefore, in step3, no new 3s are added. Hence, total 3s:2.Similarly, step3&#39;s sequence is [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. The pairs here sum to 5,7,8,7,7,8,7,5. So no pairs sum to 3. Therefore, 3s are only present from step2 onwards, but no new ones added. So after 3 steps, 3s are still 2.But wait, in step3, the 3s from step2 are still present. So, even though step3&#39;s sequence has 3s, they were inserted in step2. So the total number of times 3 is written after 3 steps is 2.Similarly, if we consider step4&#39;s sequence, which is [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1], the pairs here sum to numbers like 6,11,11,10,11, etc. So no pairs sum to 3. Therefore, the number of 3s remains 2.Thus, once a number is inserted in a step, it remains in all subsequent steps, but new insertions of the same number can only occur if a pair summing to that number exists in a previous step. Therefore, for the number 1973, the total number of times it is written is equal to the number of times a pair of numbers in any step&#39;s sequence sum to 1973. Each such pair will insert a 1973 in the next step, which remains in all subsequent steps. Therefore, we need to count, over all steps from 0 to 1972, the number of adjacent pairs summing to 1973.But how do we compute this?Perhaps we can model this recursively. Let&#39;s denote by f(n, k) the number of times the number k is present in the sequence after n steps. But considering that once a number is inserted, it stays, f(n, k) = f(n-1, k) + c(n-1, k), where c(n-1, k) is the number of adjacent pairs in step n-1 that sum to k, which would insert k in step n.But in our case, we need to compute the total number of times 1973 is written over 1973 steps, which would be the sum over c(n, 1973) for n from 0 to 1972, where c(n, 1973) is the number of pairs in step n that sum to 1973.But how can we compute c(n, 1973)?Alternatively, note that all numbers in the sequence are part of a structure that can be represented as a binary tree. Each number in the sequence can be associated with a binary string indicating its position in the tree. For example, the initial 1s can be considered as left and right, then each insertion is a combination of the left and right subtrees.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the numbers in the sequence as being related to combinations. Let me consider that each number in the sequence after n steps is the sum of certain combinations of the initial numbers. However, since the initial numbers are both 1s, maybe each number in the sequence corresponds to a certain number of paths or combinations, leading to a binomial coefficient.Wait, let&#39;s consider how numbers are generated. Starting with two 1s. Each time, inserting the sum between two numbers. So, after n steps, each number can be associated with a binary string of length n, indicating the path taken to reach it through left and right insertions. However, I might need to think differently.Alternatively, note that each number in the sequence is a coefficient in the expansion of (1 + 1)^{2^n}, but this might not directly apply.Alternatively, think of each step as a depth in a binary tree, where each node is the sum of its two children. If we start with the two 1s at depth 0. Then, each subsequent step corresponds to a deeper level in the tree, where each parent node is the sum of its two children. However, this is similar to a Huffman tree or a summation tree.In such a tree, the value at each node is the sum of its two children. Therefore, the root node (depth 0) would be 1 + 1 = 2. Then, at depth 1, we have two nodes, each being 1 and 1. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the leaves are the initial numbers, and internal nodes are the sums. So, if we start with two leaves: 1 and 1. Their parent is 2. Then, inserting between them, we add a new node 2, but actually, in a binary tree, each insertion would require more structure.Alternatively, maybe considering that each number in the sequence corresponds to a certain number of paths from the root to the leaves, weighted by the initial values. Wait, perhaps not.Alternatively, think of each number in the sequence as the number of ways to traverse from the left end to the right end through the inserted numbers, with some constraints. But this is vague.Wait, perhaps an important observation is that all numbers in the sequence are part of the structure known as the Stern&#39;s diatomic sequence. Stern&#39;s diatomic sequence is defined by the recurrence relations s(0) = 0, s(1) = 1, and for n ≥ 1, s(2n) = s(n) and s(2n + 1) = s(n) + s(n + 1). This sequence has the property that each positive rational number appears exactly once as a consecutive pair s(n)/s(n+1). However, I&#39;m not sure if this directly relates.Alternatively, the sequence generated here is similar to the Farey sequence, where mediant fractions are inserted between adjacent terms. The mediant of two fractions a/b and c/d is (a + c)/(b + d). However, in our case, we are inserting sums, not mediants, but the process is similar in that we insert the sum between two numbers. However, in the Farey sequence, the mediant has a denominator that is the sum of the denominators, while here, we are dealing with numerators.Alternatively, consider that the numbers generated in each step correspond to the numerators of the fractions in the Farey sequence of some order. But again, not sure.Alternatively, think in terms of continued fractions or Calkin-Wilf tree. The Calkin-Wilf tree is a binary tree where each node a/b has two children: a/(a+b) and (a+b)/b. This tree enumerates all positive rational numbers. However, again, the connection is unclear.Alternatively, since we are dealing with sums, perhaps the numbers in the sequence correspond to the number of times a certain number can be expressed as a sum of 1s and 2s in some fashion. But this is vague.Alternatively, let me try to think about how a particular number, say 1973, can be generated. For 1973 to be generated at step k, there must be two adjacent numbers in step k-1 that sum to 1973. Those two numbers, in turn, must have been generated in previous steps. So, to generate 1973 in step k, we need two numbers a and b such that a + b = 1973, and those a and b must be adjacent in step k-1. But a and b themselves must have been generated in prior steps, say a in step k_a and b in step k_b, where k_a, k_b &lt; k-1.This seems like a recursive approach, but given that 1973 is a prime number, the pairs (a, b) that sum to 1973 are (1, 1972), (2, 1971), ..., (986, 987). Each of these pairs must have been generated in step k-1 for 1973 to be generated in step k. However, the question is, how many of these pairs actually exist in the sequence at any step from 0 to 1972.But considering that all numbers in the sequence are positive integers, and starting from 1 and 1, each subsequent number is a sum of previous numbers, so all numbers in the sequence are positive integers. However, not all pairs (m, 1973 - m) will necessarily appear adjacent in any step.Therefore, the key is to determine for each possible pair (m, 1973 - m), whether they can appear adjacent in some step, and how many times such adjacency occurs.But given the complexity of the sequence&#39;s growth, it&#39;s challenging to see a straightforward pattern.Alternatively, note that in each step, the sequence is symmetric. For example, step1: [1,2,1]; step2: [1,3,2,3,1]; step3: [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. Each time, the sequence is palindromic. Therefore, the number of times a pair (a, b) appears is the same as the number of times (b, a) appears. Since 1973 is odd, the pairs (m, 1973 - m) are unique for m from 1 to 986. However, given the symmetry, if a pair (m, 1973 - m) appears once, the pair (1973 - m, m) also appears once, but since the sequence is symmetric, they might actually be the same pair when considering the entire palindrome.Alternatively, for each pair (m, 1973 - m), if they appear in the sequence, they will be mirrored on both sides of the center. Therefore, the number of such pairs would be even, unless m = 1973 - m, which would imply m = 986.5, which is not an integer. So, all pairs are distinct and their mirrored counterparts exist.But given that the sequence is constructed by always inserting sums between existing numbers, and all numbers are positive integers, perhaps the numbers in the sequence are all the numbers that can be formed by adding 1s and 2s through a certain combination of steps. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, perhaps each number in the sequence is of the form a*1 + b*2, where a and b are non-negative integers, but this is likely not restrictive enough.Alternatively, given that we start with 1s and insert sums, all numbers in the sequence are part of the semigroup generated by 1 under addition. Which is all positive integers. Therefore, every positive integer can appear in the sequence given enough steps. However, the question is how many times 1973 appears after 1973 steps.But since each number is inserted exactly once for each pair of adjacent numbers that sum to it, and then remains in all subsequent steps, the total number of times 1973 is written is equal to the number of times it is inserted, which is the number of pairs (a, b) such that a + b = 1973 in any step up to step 1972.But how do we count these pairs? Maybe there&#39;s a relationship with the number of ways to express 1973 as a sum of numbers from the sequence in certain ways.Alternatively, notice that in the first step, the possible sums are 2. In the second step, sums can be 3. In the third step, sums can be 4,5. In the fourth step, sums can be 5,7,8, etc. So the numbers that can be generated are following a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but more complex.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that each number in the sequence can be represented as a linear combination of the initial 1s with coefficients corresponding to the number of times they are included in the sum. Since each insertion is a sum of two adjacent numbers, which themselves are sums from previous steps, this resembles a binary tree where each node&#39;s value is the sum of its two children. Therefore, each number in the sequence can be associated with a unique path from the root to the leaves in this tree, and the value is the number of paths or something similar.But this is getting too abstract. Let&#39;s try a different approach.Suppose we model each number in the sequence as a node in a graph, where edges represent the sum operation. Each time we insert a sum between two numbers, we&#39;re effectively creating a new node connected to the two original nodes. However, this might not help directly.Alternatively, consider that the numbers generated are the same as the denominators in the Farey sequence of order n, but again, I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of the Calkin-Wilf tree. In the Calkin-Wilf tree, each node is a positive rational number, and each node a/b has two children: a/(a+b) and (a+b)/b. If we consider only the numerators, starting from 1/1, the numerators follow a certain pattern. But in our problem, we are dealing with sums, not fractions, so this connection is tenuous.Alternatively, note that the process described in the problem is similar to generating a binary Huffman code tree, where each new node is the sum of its two children. In such a tree, the value of each node is the sum of the values of its two children. Starting with two leaves each with value 1, the parent node would be 2. Then, inserting a node between the leaves and the parent would create new nodes with values 1+2=3 and 2+1=3, and so on. The sequence generated in the problem corresponds to the in-order traversal of this binary tree. Each step corresponds to a level in the tree. Therefore, the numbers written are the values of the nodes at each level when traversed in-order.If this is the case, then each number in the sequence corresponds to a node in this binary tree. The value of each node is equal to the sum of its two children. Therefore, starting from the leaves (1s), each internal node is the sum of its two children.In such a tree, the number of times a particular number appears is equal to the number of nodes in the tree with that value after 1973 levels.But how many nodes with value 1973 exist in such a tree after 1973 levels?This seems difficult, but perhaps properties of the tree can help. In a binary tree where each node is the sum of its two children, starting from leaves of 1, the values of the nodes correspond to the number of paths from the root to the leaves passing through that node, or something similar.Alternatively, note that each number in the tree is a coefficient in a polynomial generated by multiplying (1 + x) repeatedly. For example, after the first step, we have (1 + x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2. The coefficients are [1,2,1]. Then, inserting sums between coefficients could be akin to squaring the polynomial again? Let&#39;s see. If we take (1 + 2x + x^2)^2 = 1 + 4x + 6x^2 + 4x^3 + x^4, which doesn&#39;t match the next step. Alternatively, maybe a different operation.Alternatively, the process of inserting sums between numbers is similar to the process of creating a new polynomial by adding midpoints, which is akin to upsampling in signal processing. However, I don&#39;t see a direct connection.Alternatively, observe that each number in the sequence can be associated with a binary representation. For example, each step corresponds to a bit in a binary number, indicating left or right movement in the tree. However, this is too vague.Alternatively, think of the numbers as being related to the number of times a certain depth is reached in the binary tree. For instance, the number 2 is generated once at step1, the number3 is generated twice at step2, etc. Perhaps there is a pattern here.Looking back at the examples:Step0: [1,1] → numbers: 1 (twice)Step1: [1,2,1] → numbers: 1 (twice), 2 (once)Step2: [1,3,2,3,1] → numbers: 1 (twice), 2 (once), 3 (twice)Step3: [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1] → numbers:1 (twice), 2 (once), 3 (twice), 4 (twice),5 (twice)Step4: [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1] → numbers:1 (twice),2 (once),3 (twice),4 (twice),5 (four times),7 (four times),8 (twice)Wait, here in step4, the number5 appears four times. Previously, in step3, number5 appeared twice. So, in step3, two 5s are inserted. In step4, each of those 5s are between 3 and 5 (from step3: [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]), so inserting between 3 and5: 8, and between5 and2:7, etc. Wait, but the existing 5s stay. Wait, no. Wait, step4&#39;s sequence is generated by inserting sums between adjacent numbers in step3&#39;s sequence.Step3&#39;s sequence: [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]Adjacent pairs:1 &amp;4 → sum54 &amp;3 → sum73 &amp;5 → sum85 &amp;2 → sum72 &amp;5 → sum75 &amp;3 → sum83 &amp;4 → sum74 &amp;1 → sum5So inserting these sums between each pair, step4&#39;s sequence is:1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1So in step4, we have two new 5s inserted between1 &amp;4 and between4 &amp;1 (due to the symmetry). But the original 5s from step3 are still present in step4&#39;s sequence. Wait, no. Wait, in step3&#39;s sequence, the numbers are [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. When we insert sums between them, the existing numbers remain. So in step4, the sequence is the original numbers from step3 plus the inserted sums. Therefore, the original 5s are still present in step4. Let&#39;s check:Step4: [1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1]Breaking it down:Between 1 and4: inserted 5Between4 and3: inserted7Between3 and5: inserted8Between5 and2: inserted7Between2 and5: inserted7Between5 and3: inserted8Between3 and4: inserted7Between4 and1: inserted5So the original numbers from step3 are in the even positions:1 (position0),4 (position2),3 (position4),5 (position6),2 (position8),5 (position10),3 (position12),4 (position14),1 (position16)Therefore, the original 5s are at positions6 and10 in step4&#39;s sequence. Additionally, the inserted 5s are at positions1 and15 (inserted between1 and4, and between4 and1). So step4 has four 5s: two original from step3 and two new inserted ones. Wait, but the original 5s from step3 are still present in step4. Therefore, each step preserves all previous numbers and adds new ones. Therefore, the count of a number is cumulative. However, when we insert a new number, it can be adjacent to existing numbers, potentially creating new pairs that sum to other numbers.But this complicates the counting, as the number of times a number is inserted depends on the previous pairs.Wait, but for the number 1973, which is prime, and given that we are starting from 1s, the pairs that can sum to 1973 must consist of numbers that are generated in prior steps. But given the limited steps (1973), perhaps the number 1973 can only be generated once? But that seems unlikely.Alternatively, notice that the number of times a number k is generated is equal to the number of ways to express k as a sum of two numbers that are adjacent in some step. Given the symmetry and the insertion process, this might relate to the number of times k can be expressed as a sum in the binary tree structure. However, without a clear formula, this is challenging.Alternatively, consider that in each step, the numbers inserted are the sums of adjacent pairs from the previous step. Therefore, the multiset of numbers in step n includes all numbers from step n-1 and the sums of each adjacent pair from step n-1.Since we start with {1,1} in step0, step1 has {1,2,1}, step2 has {1,3,2,3,1}, and so on. The key observation here is that each number in the sequence is part of a structure where it can be involved in multiple sums in subsequent steps. However, once a number is inserted, it can only be summed with its immediate neighbors.Given that, perhaps the number 1973 can only be formed once, from a specific pair of numbers that eventually sum to 1973. But given the high value of 1973, it would take many steps to generate such a pair.Alternatively, note that the numbers generated in each step follow a pattern similar to the Calkin-Wilf sequence, where each number is a sum of its neighbors. In the Calkin-Wilf sequence, every positive rational number appears exactly once, but in our case, we are dealing with integers only. However, this might imply that each positive integer appears a certain number of times based on its factorization.Alternatively, consider the following: Since 1973 is a prime number, the only way it can be formed as a sum is 1 + 1972, 2 + 1971, ..., 986 + 987. For each of these pairs, we need to determine if they can appear adjacent in any step up to step1972. If they can, then each such occurrence would result in a 1973 being inserted in the next step.However, the problem reduces to determining how many of these pairs (m, 1973 - m) for m from 1 to 986 actually appear as adjacent pairs in the sequence at any step up to 1972.Given the recursive nature of the sequence, each number in the sequence can be traced back to combinations of the initial 1s. Therefore, each number can be represented as a sum of 1s along certain paths. However, it&#39;s unclear how to model this.Alternatively, consider that the sequence generated is similar to the Fibonacci sequence in terms of recursive sums, but in a different structure. In Fibonacci, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Here, each inserted number is the sum of its immediate neighbors from the previous step.Wait, this might be key. Let&#39;s think recursively about the numbers. Suppose we have a number x inserted between a and b in step k. Then x = a + b. In step k+1, numbers will be inserted between a and x, and between x and b. The numbers inserted will be a + x and x + b. But x = a + b, so a + x = a + a + b = 2a + b, and x + b = a + b + b = a + 2b.Therefore, each number x generates two new numbers in the next step: 2a + b and a + 2b.If we track the generation of numbers, starting from the initial 1s:Step0: a=1, b=1.Step1: insert x=2 between them.Step2: insert 1+2=3 and 2+1=3.Step3: insert between 1 and3: 1+3=4, between3 and2: 3+2=5, between2 and3:2+3=5, between3 and1:3+1=4.Step4: insert between each of these...But this seems like each number x leads to two children: 2a + b and a + 2b. Therefore, the numbers generated are linear combinations of the original a and b with coefficients increasing by powers of 2.Wait, but since we start with a=1 and b=1, which are both 1, then:In step1: x=2 (1+1).In step2: 3 (1+2 and 2+1).In step3: 4 (1+3), 5 (3+2), 5 (2+3), 4 (3+1).In step4: 5 (1+4), 7 (4+3), 8 (3+5), 7 (5+2), 7 (2+5), 8 (5+3), 7 (3+4), 5 (4+1).So, the numbers generated are of the form 2^m + 2^n, where m and n are integers?Wait, maybe not directly. Alternatively, each number can be represented as a linear combination of the initial numbers (1s) with coefficients corresponding to the number of times they&#39;re included in the sum. However, since all numbers are derived from sums starting from 1s, each number is an integer, but the coefficients might be related to binary representations.Alternatively, note that each number after n steps can be represented as (n+1) in some combinatorial way. But this is unclear.Alternatively, think of the numbers in terms of their binary representations. For example, the number 5 in step3: 5 is 101 in binary. Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, notice that the numbers generated are all the numbers that can be formed by adding 1s and multiplying by 2 in certain ways. For example, 2 is 1+1, 3 is 1+2, 4 is 1+3, 5 is 2+3, etc. But this is too vague.Alternatively, perhaps the numbers generated are all numbers that can be expressed in the form a + b where a and b are numbers in the previous step. Since each step&#39;s numbers are built from sums of the previous step&#39;s adjacent pairs, this is essentially building all possible sums that can be derived from the initial 1s through a series of pairwise additions.Given that, since we start with 1s, and each sum is a combination of previous sums, the numbers generated are all positive integers. However, not all positive integers can be generated in a finite number of steps. For example, after 1 step, we have 1,2,1. After 2 steps, 1,3,2,3,1. After 3 steps, numbers up to 5. After 4 steps, numbers up to 8. So, each step can generate numbers up to a certain maximum. The maximum number in step n is Fib(n+2), maybe? Let&#39;s see:Step0: max=1Step1: max=2Step2: max=3Step3: max=5Step4: max=8Yes, this looks like Fibonacci numbers. The maximum number in step n is the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number. Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc. Therefore, the maximum number in step n is Fib(n+2). Therefore, after 1973 steps, the maximum number generated would be Fib(1975). However, Fib(1975) is an enormous number, much larger than 1973. Therefore, 1973 would have been generated in an earlier step.Therefore, the first occurrence of 1973 would be in step k where Fib(k+2) ≥ 1973. But since we need to find the total number of times 1973 is written after 1973 steps, which would be the number of times it was inserted in each step from its first occurrence up to step1973.However, even if we can determine when 1973 is first generated, how do we find how many times it&#39;s inserted in each subsequent step?Alternatively, note that once a number m is generated in step k, it can participate in sums in subsequent steps. Specifically, if m is adjacent to a number n in some step, then in the next step, the sum m + n is inserted between them. However, for m = 1973, unless n is 0, which it&#39;s not, the sum would be greater than 1973. Therefore, once 1973 is inserted, it cannot be part of a pair that sums to 1973 again, because its neighbors would be larger than it. Wait, is that true?Wait, in step k, if 1973 is inserted between a and b where a + b = 1973. In the next step, between a and 1973, we insert a + 1973, and between 1973 and b, we insert 1973 + b. Both of these sums are greater than 1973. Therefore, the neighbors of 1973 in subsequent steps are larger than 1973, so they cannot form a pair summing to 1973. Therefore, once 1973 is inserted in step k, it cannot be part of a pair that sums to 1973 in any subsequent step. Therefore, the only pairs that can sum to 1973 are those that do not include 1973 itself. Hence, the total number of times 1973 is written is equal to the number of pairs (a, b) in the entire history up to step1972 where a + b = 1973.But since each such pair can only occur once in the sequence (due to the tree-like structure where each pair is unique), maybe the number of such pairs is related to the number of ways to express 1973 as a sum of two numbers that are generated in previous steps.But this is still vague. Perhaps we need to use induction or some combinatorial argument.Let me consider smaller primes. For example, how many times is the number 3 written after 3 steps?As we saw earlier, in step2, two 3s are inserted. Then, in step3, those 3s are still there, but no new 3s are inserted because the pairs in step2&#39;s sequence sum to 4 and 5. Hence, total 3s:2.Similarly, let&#39;s take number5. In step3, two 5s are inserted. In step4, we insert between3 and5:8, and between5 and2:7, etc. So, in step4, the 5s are still present, but no new 5s are inserted because the pairs in step3&#39;s sequence that sum to5 are (1,4), (4,3), (3,2), (2,3), etc., which sum to5 only between (1,4) and (4,1) in step3. Wait, no. Wait, step3&#39;s sequence is [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. The adjacent pairs are:1 &amp;4: sum54 &amp;3: sum73 &amp;5: sum85 &amp;2: sum72 &amp;5: sum75 &amp;3: sum83 &amp;4: sum74 &amp;1: sum5So, in step3, the pairs that sum to5 are (1,4) and (4,1). Therefore, in step4, we insert5 between1 and4, and between4 and1. But wait, step4&#39;s sequence is generated by inserting sums between these pairs. Wait, no. In step3&#39;s sequence, inserting between1 and4 gives1, (1+4)=5, 4, etc. So in step4&#39;s sequence, between1 and4 we insert5, which was already present in step3&#39;s sequence. Wait, no. The inserted number is5, which is new. But wait, the original numbers from step3 are preserved. Therefore, in step4&#39;s sequence, the numbers are: 1,5,4,7,3,8,5,7,2,7,5,8,3,7,4,5,1.Here, the inserted5s are at positions1 and15, while the original5s from step3 are at positions6 and10. Therefore, step4 has four5s: two original from step3 and two new from insertion in step4. But wait, the insertion in step4 between1 and4 is5, which was already present in step3. But no, in step3&#39;s sequence, the5s were at positions3 and5 (0-based indexing). When we insert new numbers in step4, we don&#39;t overwrite the existing numbers; we just insert new ones between them. So between1 and4, we insert5, so the sequence becomes1,5,4,... but the original4 is still there. Similarly, between4 and3, we insert7, so the sequence becomes1,5,4,7,3,... Thus, the original numbers from step3 are still present in the even positions of step4&#39;s sequence.Therefore, the5s inserted in step4 are new instances, even though the number5 already existed from step3. Therefore, the total number of5s increases in step4. But why can we insert5s again?Because in step3, the pair (1,4) sums to5, so in step4, a5 is inserted between them. However, the original5s from step3 are still present in different positions. Therefore, each time a pair sums to5, a new5 is inserted, regardless of existing5s. Therefore, the count of5s can increase over time.But this contradicts our earlier assumption that once a number is inserted, it can&#39;t be part of a pair summing to itself. Wait, but in this case, the pair (1,4) sums to5, and a new5 is inserted between them, but the existing5s are elsewhere in the sequence. Therefore, the same sum can be achieved by different pairs in different positions, leading to multiple insertions of the same number.Therefore, the key insight is that a number k can be inserted multiple times, once for each pair of adjacent numbers in any step that sum to k. These pairs can be in different positions in the sequence and can occur in different steps. Therefore, the total number of times k is written is equal to the number of distinct pairs (a, b) that sum to k, where a and b are adjacent in some step before the final step.Therefore, for k=1973, we need to find the number of times two numbers a and b, adjacent in some step from0 to1972, satisfy a + b =1973.Given the symmetry of the sequence, each pair (a, b) that sums to1973 has a mirror pair (b, a) on the other side of the sequence. Since the sequence is palindromic, these pairs are distinct but produce the same sum. However, since the sequence is symmetric, the number of such pairs is even, unless a = b, which is not possible here since1973 is odd.Therefore, the number of pairs (a, b) summing to1973 is even. However, each such pair in each step contributes one insertion of1973 in the next step.But how many such pairs exist over all steps?This seems related to the number of times1973 can be expressed as a sum of numbers generated in the sequence, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, think of the problem as follows: Each time we insert a number between two existing numbers, we&#39;re creating a new node that is the sum of its two neighbors. This process is similar to building a binary tree where each internal node is the sum of its two children. In such a tree, the number of times a number appears is equal to the number of paths from the root to leaves that pass through that number.However, this is still abstract. Perhaps another angle is needed.Consider that each number in the sequence can be represented as a linear combination of the initial 1s with coefficients corresponding to the number of paths through the insertion steps. For example, the number2 in step1 is 1+1. The number3 in step2 is 1+2 or 2+1. The number5 in step3 is3+2 or2+3, etc. Each number is a combination of the initial 1s with certain coefficients.Alternatively, note that every number in the sequence after n steps corresponds to a node in a binary tree of depth n, where each node is the sum of its two children. The root is 2 (step1), its children are1 and1 (step0). Each subsequent step expands the tree by adding children to the previous leaves.But even so, counting the number of times1973 appears in this tree after1973 steps is non-trivial.Alternatively, consider that the numbers in the sequence are the values of the nodes in a binary tree generated by the rule that each node is the sum of its two children. Starting with two leaves of1, the tree is built recursively. Each internal node is the sum of its children. The sequence generated in the problem is the in-order traversal of this tree after n steps.In such a tree, the number of nodes with value k is equal to the number of ways k can be expressed as a sum of two children nodes in the tree. Since the tree is built recursively, each node&#39;s value is the sum of two smaller nodes. Therefore, the number of times k appears is equal to the number of ways to decompose k into sums of two numbers that can be generated in previous steps.However, since1973 is a prime number, the only possible decompositions are1+1972, 2+1971, ...,986+987. Each of these decompositions can be further broken down into sums of smaller numbers. However, whether these numbers can be generated in the tree depends on the previous steps.Given that the tree is built up from1s, each number greater than1 is the sum of two smaller numbers. Therefore, every number greater than1 can be generated given enough steps. However, for a specific number like1973, the number of times it appears in the tree (and hence in the sequence) is equal to the number of ways it can be expressed as a sum of two numbers that are present in the tree.But this leads us to the concept of the number of compositions or partitions of1973, but restricted to numbers generated in the sequence.Alternatively, note that in the binary tree, each number can be generated in exactly one way as the sum of two numbers. Wait, no. For example, the number3 can be generated as1+2 and2+1, but in the tree, these are two different nodes (left and right children). Therefore, the number3 appears twice in the sequence. Similarly, number5 appears multiple times.This suggests that the number of times a number k appears in the sequence is equal to the number of ways to decompose k into a sum of two numbers that are connected in the tree. Since the tree is symmetric, each decomposition (a, b) and (b, a) are counted separately, leading to an even number of occurrences unless a = b.However, since1973 is odd, all pairs (a, b) are distinct, so the number of occurrences should be even. But in our earlier example, the number3 appears twice, which is even. The number5 appears four times in step4, which is also even. So, perhaps the number of times a prime number p appears is equal to twice the number of times it can be decomposed into sums of pairs (a, p -a), where a and p -a are generated in the tree.But since1973 is a prime, the number of decompositions is1972/2 =986 pairs. However, not all pairs (a,1973 -a) may be present in the tree.But given that the tree is built recursively from1s, every number from1 to1973 can be generated given enough steps. Therefore, all pairs (a,1973 -a) where a ranges from1 to986 are possible. Therefore, each pair (a,1973 -a) is present in the tree exactly once, mirrored on both sides due to the tree&#39;s symmetry, leading to two insertions of1973 per pair. However, since the sequence is a palindrome, each pair (a,1973 -a) and (1973 -a, a) are actually the same pair mirrored, so they would contribute one insertion each. Therefore, the total number of insertions would be equal to the number of such pairs, which is986, but since each pair is mirrored, they contribute two insertions. Wait, no.Wait, in the sequence, which is a palindrome, each pair (a, b) has a corresponding pair (b, a) on the other side. However, in the in-order traversal of the symmetric tree, these pairs are two distinct pairs but generate the same sum. Therefore, each decomposition (a,1973 -a) and (1973 -a, a) would result in two insertions of1973. However, since the tree is symmetric, these pairs are actually present in mirroring positions, but each pair is unique and contributes one insertion. Therefore, the total number of pairs (a, b) that sum to1973 is equal to the number of ordered pairs where a + b =1973 and a, b are adjacent in some step.But since the sequence is a palindrome, the number of such pairs would be double the number of unordered pairs. But since a and b are ordered in the sequence, (a, b) and (b, a) are distinct pairs unless a = b, which isn&#39;t possible here. Therefore, for each unordered pair {a,1973 -a}, there are two ordered pairs (a,1973 -a) and (1973 -a, a) in the sequence. Since the sequence is symmetric, these pairs would appear on opposite sides of the midpoint. Therefore, each unordered pair corresponds to two ordered pairs in the sequence, resulting in two insertions of1973.Therefore, the total number of insertions of1973 would be twice the number of unordered pairs {a,1973 -a} that appear as adjacent pairs in some step.But how many such unordered pairs exist?Since all numbers from1 to1972 can be generated in the tree given enough steps, each pair (a,1973 -a) will eventually appear as adjacent pairs in some step. However, the process of generating these pairs is such that each pair is generated in a unique step. For example, the pair (1,1972) would be generated in the step where1972 is first generated, but1972 would require many steps to generate.However, since we are limited to1973 steps, we need to determine how many of these pairs can be generated within1973 steps.But given that each number can be generated in a number of steps equal to its depth in the tree, which is logarithmic in the number, perhaps all numbers up to1973 can be generated within1973 steps. Therefore, all possible pairs (a,1973 -a) would have been generated by step1973, allowing for1973 to be inserted in step1973. However, we need to count the number of insertions up to step1973.But even if all pairs are generated, the number of times1973 is inserted is equal to the number of such pairs, which is986 (since1973 is prime, the number of unordered pairs {a,1973 -a} is986). Since each unordered pair contributes two ordered pairs (a, b) and (b, a) in the sequence, resulting in two insertions, the total number of insertions would be2 *986 =1972.But wait, in our earlier example with number3, we had two insertions, which corresponds to two ordered pairs (1,2) and (2,1). Similarly, for number5, we had four insertions in step4, which corresponds to two unordered pairs {1,4} and {4,1} (but these are the same unordered pair) leading to two insertions, but step4 had four5s. This seems contradictory.Wait, in step3, the sequence is [1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,1]. The pairs summing to5 are (1,4) and (4,1). Each of these pairs inserts a5 in step4. However, in step4&#39;s sequence, we have four5s. Two of them are original from step3 (positions6 and10), and two are new insertions (positions1 and15). But the original5s were inserted in step2 and step3.Wait, no. The5s in step3 are at positions3 and5 (0-based), which are preserved in step4 at positions6 and10. The new5s inserted in step4 are at positions1 and15. Therefore, the total number of5s after step4 is four: two preserved from previous steps and two new insertions.But this contradicts the earlier assumption that each pair (a, b) summing to k leads to one insertion of k. It seems that once a pair (a, b) is present in step n, it leads to an insertion of k in step n+1, and the inserted k remains in all subsequent steps. However, the preserved a and b can still form pairs with other numbers in future steps, leading to new insertions of k if (a, c) sums to k or (c, b) sums to k. But in reality, once a number is inserted between a and b, the original a and b are now separated by the inserted k, so they can no longer form a pair in future steps. Therefore, each pair (a, b) can only exist in one step, after which they are separated by the inserted k.Therefore, each pair (a, b) that sums to k exists in exactly one step, and thus leads to exactly one insertion of k in the next step. Therefore, the number of times k is inserted is equal to the number of pairs (a, b) that sum to k in any step from0 to n-1.Given that, for k=1973, the number of times it is written is equal to the number of pairs (a, b) in any step up to step1972 that sum to1973. Each such pair is unique and exists in exactly one step, leading to one insertion of1973 in the next step. Therefore, the total number of1973s is equal to the number of such pairs.But how many such pairs are there?Given the sequence&#39;s construction, each number can be generated by recursively splitting the initial intervals. Each time a pair (a, b) is split by inserting a + b, the original pair (a, b) is replaced by (a, a + b) and (a + b, b). Therefore, each original pair can only exist in one step and is replaced by two new pairs in the next step. Hence, the pairs evolve over steps.Therefore, the number of pairs (a, b) that sum to1973 is equal to the number of times the pair (a, b) with a + b =1973 is generated through this splitting process.However, this is a dynamic process, and tracking all possible pairs is complex. However, there&#39;s a mathematical result related to this problem.This problem is similar to the process generating the Calkin-Wilf tree, where each positive rational number appears exactly once. In our problem, we are dealing with integers, and the process is similar but generates integers through iterative summing.A key observation is that each pair of coprime numbers (a, b) appears exactly once in the sequence of adjacent pairs during the entire process. This is analogous to the Calkin-Wilf sequence, where each coprime pair appears exactly once. Since1973 is prime, all pairs (a,1973 -a) where a and1973 -a are coprime will appear exactly once. But since1973 is prime, gcd(a,1973 -a) = gcd(a,1973). Since1973 is prime, gcd(a,1973) is1 unless a is a multiple of1973, which it can&#39;t be since a &lt;1973. Therefore, all pairs (a,1973 -a) are coprime, and thus each pair appears exactly once in the sequence during some step.Since there are1972 ordered pairs (a, b) where a + b =1973, and each coprime pair appears exactly once, all1972 pairs will appear exactly once in the sequence over the steps. However, due to the symmetry of the sequence, each unordered pair {a, b} appears twice as (a, b) and (b, a), but since1973 is prime, all pairs are distinct and hence appear as two separate ordered pairs.But since the sequence is symmetric, each ordered pair (a, b) has a mirror pair (b, a). Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (a, b) summing to1973 is1972, which is the number of ordered pairs from1 to1972. However, in our process, since each coprime pair is generated exactly once, the number of times a pair (a, b) summing to1973 appears is equal to the number of such coprime pairs, which isφ(1973), Euler&#39;s totient function. But φ(1973) =1972, since1973 is prime. Therefore, all pairs (a,1973 -a) where a ranges from1 to1972 are coprime, and hence each appears exactly once in the sequence.Therefore, the number of times1973 is written is equal to the number of such pairs, which is1972. However, due to the symmetry, each pair (a, b) and (b, a) is generated in different steps, but since we are counting over all steps up to1973, both are included. Therefore, the total number of times1973 is written is1972.But this contradicts our earlier example with smaller numbers. For instance, number3 is written twice, which is equal toφ(3)=2. Similarly, number5 would be written φ(5)=4 times. Wait, φ(5)=4, and indeed in step4, there are four5s. So there&#39;s a pattern here that the number of times a prime number p is written isφ(p)=p-1.But φ(p) for a prime p is indeed p-1, which counts the numbers from1 to p-1 that are coprime to p. But in our case, the number of times p is written is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a, p -a), which for prime p is indeedφ(p) = p -1. However, in our examples, number3 (prime) is written twice, which isφ(3)=2, and number5 (prime) is written four times, which isφ(5)=4. Therefore, this seems to hold.Therefore, the number of times a prime number p is written after sufficiently many steps isφ(p)=p-1. Since1973 is prime, the number of times it is written is1973 -1=1972.Therefore, the answer is1972.However, we need to confirm whether all coprime pairs (a, b) summing to1973 are indeed generated within1973 steps. Given that each coprime pair is generated in the sequence through the recursive splitting process, and given the exponential growth of the steps, it&#39;s reasonable to assume that within1973 steps, all coprime pairs (a, b) summing to1973 would have been generated. Therefore, the number of times1973 is written is1972.But in our earlier example with step4 and number5, we have four5s, which isφ(5)=4. Similarly, for step3 and number3, we have two3s, which isφ(3)=2. This pattern holds. Therefore, for a prime number p, the number of times it is written after sufficiently many steps isφ(p)=p-1. Since1973 is prime, the answer should be1972.Therefore, the final answer is boxed{1972}.&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves repeatedly inserting sums between adjacent numbers starting with two 1s. We need to determine how many times the number 1973 is written after 1973 steps.1. Process Understanding: Starting with [1, 1], each step inserts the sum of adjacent numbers. The sequence grows symmetrically and each number persists in subsequent steps.2. Key Insight: The number 1973, being prime, can only be formed by pairs (a, 1973 - a) where a and 1973 - a are coprime. Each coprime pair (a, b) summing to 1973 appears exactly once due to the symmetry and properties of the sequence.3. Euler&#39;s Totient Function: For a prime number p, φ(p) = p - 1. This counts the coprime pairs (a, p - a), which for 1973 is 1972.4. Conclusion: Each coprime pair generates 1973 once, leading to 1972 occurrences.Thus, the number of times 1973 is written is (boxed{1972}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e1a50256></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>🔑:</span>Let&#39;s write down the lines of numbers that form as a result of each step. We will get some table. Let&#39;s try to find out how many times the number n will appear in the n-th line of this table (it is clear that in each subsequent line - with a number greater than n - the number n will appear exactly as many times as in the n-th: all newly formed numbers will already be greater than n).We will say that a pair of natural numbers (a, b) appears in our table if the numbers a and b stand next to each other in one line, with b to the right of a.Lemma. If natural numbers a and b are coprime, then the pair (a, b) appears in the table exactly once; if a and b have a common divisor (other than 1), then the pair (a, b) will not appear in the table at all.Proof. Induction on m=max {a, b}. The base case (m=2) is obvious.Inductive step. Suppose a leq b=m (the case a &gt; b is analogous). The pair (a, b) can appear in the table if and only if the pair(a, b-a) appears in it. The numbers (a, b) and (a, b-a) are either both coprime or not. For the pair (a, b-a), the statement holds by the inductive hypothesis. Therefore, the statement is also true for the pair (a, b).Each time n is written as the sum of two adjacent numbers a and b=n-a, it appears in the pairs (a, n) and (n, n-a). We have proved that this happens exactly once for each a less than n and coprime with it (then, of course, n-a is also coprime with n). Thus, each number n will be written in the segment as many times as there are natural numbers less than n and coprime with it.The number 1973 is prime, so it will appear 1972 times.## Answer1972 times.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-f181db89 data-v-e1a50256><div class="review" data-v-e1a50256><div class="review-title" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>❓:</span>3. Find the sum of the first 10 elements that are found both in the arithmetic progression {5,8,11,14, ldots} and in the geometric progression {10,20,40,80, ldots} cdot(10 points)</div><div class="divider" data-v-e1a50256></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the sum of the first 10 elements that are common to both an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression. Let me start by understanding both sequences clearly.First, the arithmetic progression (AP) given is {5, 8, 11, 14, ...}. Let me note down its general term. For an AP, the nth term is a + (n-1)d, where a is the first term and d is the common difference. Here, a = 5 and d = 8 - 5 = 3. So the nth term of the AP is 5 + (n-1)*3. Simplifying that, it would be 5 + 3n - 3 = 3n + 2. Wait, let me check. If n=1, then 5 + (1-1)*3 = 5, which is correct. n=2: 5 + (2-1)*3 = 8, which matches. So the nth term is 5 + 3(n-1) = 3n + 2. Hmm, 3n + 2 when n=1 gives 5, yes. So the general term is 3n + 2.Second, the geometric progression (GP) given is {10, 20, 40, 80, ...}. The general term of a GP is ar^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Here, a = 10 and r = 20/10 = 2. So the nth term is 10*2^(n-1). Let me verify: n=1, 10*2^(0) = 10; n=2, 10*2^(1)=20; n=3, 10*2^(2)=40. That&#39;s correct.Now, the problem is to find elements that are in both sequences. So I need to find numbers that can be expressed as 3n + 2 (from the AP) and also as 10*2^(m-1) (from the GP), where n and m are positive integers. Then, I have to find the first 10 such numbers and sum them up.So, the equation to solve is 3n + 2 = 10*2^(m-1). Let&#39;s rearrange that: 3n = 10*2^(m-1) - 2. Therefore, n = (10*2^(m-1) - 2)/3. Since n must be a positive integer, (10*2^(m-1) - 2) must be divisible by 3. So we need to find all m such that 10*2^(m-1) ≡ 2 mod 3. Let&#39;s compute 10*2^(m-1) mod 3 and see when it equals 2 mod 3.First, note that 10 mod 3 is 1, and 2 mod 3 is 2. So 10 ≡ 1 mod 3. So 10*2^(m-1) ≡ 1*2^(m-1) mod 3. Therefore, 2^(m-1) ≡ 2 mod 3. So we need 2^(m-1) ≡ 2 mod 3. Let&#39;s compute 2^k mod 3 for k = 0,1,2,...2^0 = 1 mod 3.2^1 = 2 mod 3.2^2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3.2^3 = 8 ≡ 2 mod 3.2^4 = 16 ≡ 1 mod 3.So it cycles every 2: starting at k=0, the residues are 1, 2, 1, 2, etc. So 2^k ≡ 2 mod 3 when k is odd. Therefore, 2^(m-1) ≡ 2 mod 3 when m-1 is odd, i.e., when m is even. So m must be even.Therefore, m must be even numbers. Let&#39;s write m as 2k, where k is a positive integer. So m = 2k, so m-1 = 2k -1. Therefore, substituting back into the GP term: 10*2^(2k -1) = 10*2^(2k -1). Let me compute that. 2^(2k -1) = 2^(2k)/2 = (4^k)/2. So 10*(4^k)/2 = 5*4^k. Therefore, the terms common to both sequences must be of the form 5*4^k. So the common terms are 5*4^k where k is a positive integer such that 5*4^k can be written as 3n + 2. But since we derived that m must be even, which gives us 5*4^k, and we need to check if that&#39;s in the AP. Wait, but we already derived that if m is even, then 10*2^(m-1) = 5*4^k, and that when m is even, those terms will satisfy the congruence, so n will be integer. Therefore, each term 5*4^k is in both sequences. Therefore, the common elements are the terms 5*4^k for k ≥1, because when m=2k, k=1 gives m=2, so 5*4^1=20; m=4, k=2 gives 5*4^2=80, etc. Let&#39;s verify.First common term: Let&#39;s check m=2 (even). Then GP term is 10*2^(2-1) = 10*2^1 = 20. Now check if 20 is in the AP. The AP is 5,8,11,14,17,20,... So 20 is the 6th term: 5 + 5*3 = 20. Yes, 20 is in both.Next, m=4? Wait, m=2 gives k=1, m=4 gives k=2. Let&#39;s check m=4: 10*2^(4-1) = 10*8 = 80. Check if 80 is in the AP. The AP terms: 5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80. Yes, 80 is there. What term is 80? Let&#39;s compute n where 3n + 2 = 80. 3n = 78, so n=26. So 80 is the 26th term in the AP.Wait, but according to our earlier logic, the common terms are 5*4^k. For k=1, 20; k=2, 80; k=3, 320. Let&#39;s check 320. Is 320 in the AP? 3n +2 = 320 =&gt; 3n = 318 =&gt; n=106. Yes, so 320 is the 106th term. So the common terms are 20, 80, 320, 1280, etc., each time multiplying by 4. So this is a geometric progression with first term 20 and ratio 4.Therefore, the common elements form a GP: 20, 80, 320, 1280, 5120, ..., each term multiplied by 4. So to find the sum of the first 10 elements of this GP.Wait, but let me confirm. Let&#39;s check another term. For k=3, 5*4^3=5*64=320. Is 320 in both sequences? As above, in the AP, yes. In the GP: The GP is 10,20,40,80,160,320,... So 320 is the 6th term. Correct. So the common terms are indeed 20, 80, 320, 1280, ..., each term 4 times the previous. So it&#39;s a GP with a=20, r=4.Therefore, the sum of the first 10 terms of this GP is S = a*(r^n -1)/(r-1) = 20*(4^10 -1)/(4-1) = 20*(1048576 -1)/3 = 20*(1048575)/3.Compute that: 1048575 divided by 3 is 349,525. Then 20*349,525 = 6,990,500.Wait, but let me compute step by step to avoid mistakes.First, 4^10: 4^1=4, 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024, 4^6=4096, 4^7=16384, 4^8=65536, 4^9=262144, 4^10=1048576.So 4^10 -1 = 1048576 -1 = 1048575.Divide by 3: 1048575 ÷ 3. Let&#39;s compute 3 × 349,525 = 1,048,575. So yes, 1048575 /3 = 349,525.Multiply by 20: 349,525 ×20. Let&#39;s compute 349,525 ×10 = 3,495,250, so ×20 is 6,990,500.Therefore, the sum of the first 10 common elements is 6,990,500.But let me double-check if the first 10 common terms are indeed the first 10 terms of this GP. For example, is there a common term before 20? Let&#39;s check m=1: GP term is 10. Is 10 in the AP? The AP is 5,8,11,14,17,20,... 10 is not there. So the first common term is 20. Then next is 80, 320, etc., so yes, 10 terms would be 20, 80, 320, 1280, 5120, 20480, 81920, 327680, 1310720, 5242880. Let me count: 1.20, 2.80, 3.320, 4.1280, 5.5120, 6.20480, 7.81920, 8.327680, 9.1310720, 10.5242880. Yes, 10 terms. So their sum is 20*(4^10 -1)/(4-1) = 6,990,500.Therefore, the answer should be 6,990,500. But let me verify with another approach.Alternatively, since the common terms form a GP with first term 20 and ratio 4, sum of n terms is S_n = 20*(4^n -1)/3. For n=10, S_10 = 20*(4^10 -1)/3 = as above.But just to confirm with actual addition for the first few terms:First term: 20Second term: 20 + 80 = 100Third term: 100 + 320 = 420Fourth term: 420 + 1280 = 1700Fifth term: 1700 + 5120 = 6820Sixth term: 6820 + 20480 = 27300Seventh term: 27300 + 81920 = 109220Eighth term: 109220 + 327680 = 436900Ninth term: 436900 + 1310720 = 1,747,620Tenth term: 1,747,620 + 5,242,880 = 6,990,500.Yes, that matches the formula result. So the sum is indeed 6,990,500.Therefore, the answer is 6,990,500.Final AnswerThe sum of the first 10 common elements is boxed{6990500}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the sum of the first 10 elements common to both the arithmetic progression (AP) ({5, 8, 11, 14, ldots}) and the geometric progression (GP) ({10, 20, 40, 80, ldots}), we start by identifying the general terms of each sequence.- The nth term of the AP is given by (3n + 2).- The nth term of the GP is given by (10 cdot 2^{n-1}).We need to find common terms by solving the equation (3n + 2 = 10 cdot 2^{m-1}). This simplifies to finding (m) such that (10 cdot 2^{m-1} equiv 2 pmod{3}). Simplifying, we find that (2^{m-1} equiv 2 pmod{3}), which holds when (m-1) is odd, i.e., (m) is even. Thus, the common terms are of the form (10 cdot 2^{2k-1} = 5 cdot 4^k) for (k geq 1). These terms form a GP with the first term 20 and common ratio 4.The sum of the first 10 terms of this GP is calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:[S_{10} = 20 cdot frac{4^{10} - 1}{4 - 1} = 20 cdot frac{1048576 - 1}{3} = 20 cdot frac{1048575}{3} = 20 cdot 349525 = 6990500]Thus, the sum of the first 10 common elements is (boxed{6990500}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to find the sum of the first 10 elements that are common to both an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression. The arithmetic progression (AP) given is {5, 8, 11, 14, ...} and the geometric progression (GP) is {10, 20, 40, 80, ...}. Let me start by understanding both sequences better.First, the AP: Starting term is 5, and the common difference is 8 - 5 = 3. So, the nth term of the AP can be written as a_n = 5 + (n - 1)*3. Simplifying that, it&#39;s a_n = 3n + 2. Let me check: for n=1, 3(1)+2=5, which matches. n=2: 6+2=8, yes. That works.Then, the GP: The first term is 10, and the common ratio is 20/10 = 2. So, the nth term of the GP is b_n = 10*(2)^(n-1). Checking: n=1: 10*(2)^0=10, n=2: 10*2=20, n=3: 10*4=40, that&#39;s correct.Now, the problem is to find numbers that appear in both sequences. So, I need to find all numbers that can be written as 3n + 2 and also as 10*2^(m - 1) for some integers n and m. Then, take the first 10 such numbers and sum them.But wait, first I need to figure out if there are even 10 numbers common to both sequences. Let me think. The AP is 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, ... and the GP is 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120, ... So, looking at the first few terms, the common elements so far are 20. Wait, 20 is in both: AP has 5,8,11,14,17,20,... so 20 is the 6th term in AP. GP has 10,20,40,80,... so 20 is the 2nd term. Then maybe 40? Let&#39;s check AP: 5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80,... Hmm, 80 is in the AP? Let&#39;s check: AP terms: 5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80... Yes, 80 is the 26th term. So 80 is in both sequences. Then, 160? Let&#39;s check AP: Next term after 80 would be 83,86,89,..., 160? Let&#39;s see, 80 + 3k = 160 =&gt; 3k = 80 =&gt; k=80/3 ≈26.666, which is not an integer. So 160 is not in the AP. How about 320? Similarly, 320 -80 =240, 240/3=80, so 80 terms after 80: 80 +3*80=80+240=320. Wait, that would be term 26 +80=106th term. So 320 is in AP? Let me verify: 80,83,86,... adding 3 each time. From 80 to 320 is 240. 240/3=80 steps. So yes, 320 would be in the AP. So 320 is common. Similarly, 640: 640-320=320, 320/3≈106.666, not integer. So 640 not in AP. 1280: 1280-320=960, 960/3=320. So 1280=320 +3*320=320+960=1280. So 1280 is in AP. So 1280 is common. Similarly, 2560: 2560-1280=1280. 1280/3≈426.666, not integer. So no. 5120: 5120-1280=3840. 3840/3=1280. So 5120=1280 +3*1280=5120. So 5120 is in AP. Hmm, this seems like a pattern. Every time we double the GP term, starting from 20, if we check whether (GP term - previous common term) is divisible by 3, then perhaps.Wait, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s list the GP terms: 10,20,40,80,160,320,640,1280,2560,5120,10240, etc. Now, checking which ones are in AP:- 10: 10-5=5. 5/3 ≈1.666, not integer. So 10 not in AP.- 20: 20-5=15. 15/3=5. So 20 is 5th term? Wait, AP is 5,8,11,14,17,20,... So 20 is the 6th term. Wait, 5 + (n-1)*3=20. So 3(n-1)=15 =&gt; n-1=5 =&gt; n=6. Yes, 6th term.- 40: 40-5=35. 35/3≈11.666. Not integer. So 40 not in AP.- 80: 80-5=75. 75/3=25. So n=25 +1=26. Wait, formula: 5 + (n-1)*3=80 =&gt; (n-1)*3=75 =&gt; n-1=25 =&gt; n=26. Correct, as previously noted.- 160: 160-5=155. 155/3≈51.666. Not integer. So not in AP.- 320: 320-5=315. 315/3=105. So n=105 +1=106. So 320 is the 106th term.- 640: 640-5=635. 635/3≈211.666. Not integer.- 1280: 1280-5=1275. 1275/3=425. So n=425 +1=426. So 1280 is term 426.- 2560: 2560-5=2555. 2555/3≈851.666. Not integer.- 5120: 5120-5=5115. 5115/3=1705. So n=1705 +1=1706. So 5120 is term 1706.- 10240: 10240-5=10235. 10235/3≈3411.666. Not integer.So the common terms in GP are 20,80,320,1280,5120,... which are 20*4=80, 80*4=320, 320*4=1280, etc. So each common term is 4 times the previous common term. Wait, 20*4=80, 80*4=320, 320*4=1280, etc. So it&#39;s a GP with ratio 4. So starting from 20, each term is multiplied by 4. So the common terms themselves form a geometric progression with first term 20 and ratio 4.Therefore, the common terms are 20,80,320,1280,5120,20480,81920,327680,1310720,5242880,... up to 10 terms. Then, the sum would be the sum of this GP: first term a=20, ratio r=4, n=10 terms.Sum formula for GP is S_n = a*(r^n -1)/(r -1). Plugging in the values: S_10 = 20*(4^10 -1)/(4 -1) = 20*(1048576 -1)/3 = 20*(1048575)/3 = (20/3)*1048575. Let me compute that.First, 1048575 divided by 3: 1048575 ÷ 3 = 349,525. Because 3*349,525 = 1,048,575. Then, 20*349,525 = 6,990,500. So the sum is 6,990,500.Wait, let me verify the calculations step by step.First, 4^10: 4^1=4, 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024, 4^6=4096, 4^7=16384, 4^8=65536, 4^9=262144, 4^10=1048576. Correct.Then 4^10 -1 =1048576 -1=1048575.Divide by 3: 1048575 ÷3. Let&#39;s compute 3*349,525: 3*300,000=900,000. 3*49,525=148,575. So total 900,000+148,575=1,048,575. So yes, 1048575/3=349,525.Multiply by 20: 349,525*20. 349,525*10=3,495,250. Multiply by 2: 6,990,500. So yes, the sum is 6,990,500.But wait, let me check if there are indeed 10 common terms. The common terms are 20 (GP term 2), 80 (GP term 4), 320 (GP term 6), 1280 (GP term 8), 5120 (GP term 10), 20480 (GP term 12), 81920 (GP term14), 327680 (GP term16), 1310720 (GP term18), 5242880 (GP term20). So each common term is at every even term of the original GP starting from term 2. So 10 terms would be up to 5242880. So sum of these 10 terms is indeed 6,990,500.Therefore, the answer should be 6,990,500. Let me just make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me recheck the sum formula.Sum of GP with a=20, r=4, n=10:S = 20*(4^10 -1)/(4-1) = 20*(1048576 -1)/3 = 20*1048575/3 = 20*349,525 = 6,990,500. Yes, that seems correct.But wait, let me confirm with an alternative approach. Let me list the 10 common terms and add them up step by step.1. 202. 80 (sum so far: 100)3. 320 (sum: 420)4. 1280 (sum: 1700)5. 5120 (sum: 6820)6. 20480 (sum: 27300)7. 81920 (sum: 109220)8. 327680 (sum: 436,900)Wait, hold on, this seems off. Wait, let&#39;s list them properly:Term 1: 20Term 2: 80 (20*4)Term 3: 320 (80*4)Term 4: 1280 (320*4)Term 5: 5120 (1280*4)Term 6: 20480 (5120*4)Term 7: 81920 (20480*4)Term 8: 327680 (81920*4)Term 9: 1310720 (327680*4)Term10: 5242880 (1310720*4)Now, summing them up:Start with 20Sum after term 1: 20Sum after term 2: 20 + 80 = 100Sum after term 3: 100 + 320 = 420Sum after term 4: 420 + 1280 = 1700Sum after term 5: 1700 + 5120 = 6820Sum after term 6: 6820 + 20480 = 27300Sum after term 7: 27300 + 81920 = 109,220Sum after term 8: 109,220 + 327,680 = 436,900Sum after term 9: 436,900 + 1,310,720 = 1,747,620Sum after term10: 1,747,620 + 5,242,880 = 6,990,500Okay, so the step-by-step addition also gives 6,990,500. So that confirms it.Therefore, the sum of the first 10 common elements is 6,990,500.Final AnswerThe sum of the first 10 common elements is boxed{6990500}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the sum of the first 10 elements common to both the arithmetic progression (AP) ({5, 8, 11, 14, ldots}) and the geometric progression (GP) ({10, 20, 40, 80, ldots}), we start by identifying the terms of each sequence.The (n)-th term of the AP is given by:[ a_n = 5 + (n - 1) cdot 3 = 3n + 2 ]The (n)-th term of the GP is given by:[ b_n = 10 cdot 2^{n - 1} ]We need to find numbers that appear in both sequences. By examining the terms, we observe that the common terms form a new GP with the first term 20 and common ratio 4. The common terms are: 20, 80, 320, 1280, 5120, 20480, 81920, 327680, 1310720, 5242880.To find the sum of these 10 terms, we use the sum formula for a geometric progression:[ S_n = a frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} ]where (a = 20), (r = 4), and (n = 10).Calculating the sum:[S_{10} = 20 frac{4^{10} - 1}{4 - 1} = 20 frac{1048576 - 1}{3} = 20 frac{1048575}{3} = 20 times 349525 = 6990500]Thus, the sum of the first 10 common elements is (boxed{6990500}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e1a50256></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>🔑:</span>Solution.

So, we have a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c. The problem states that the sum of the zeros (which are the roots of the quadratic equation), the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients of the function are all equal. We need to figure out which of the given options (A to E) this common value must be. Let me recall what each of these terms means and how to calculate them.First, the sum of the zeros of a quadratic function. For any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots (zeros) is given by -b/a, right? That&#39;s from Vieta&#39;s formulas. Similarly, the product of the zeros is c/a. So, sum of zeros = -b/a, product = c/a. Then, the sum of the coefficients would be a + b + c. The problem says all three of these are equal. So, we can set up equations:Sum of zeros = Product of zeros = Sum of coefficients.So, let&#39;s write that out:1. Sum of zeros: -b/a2. Product of zeros: c/a3. Sum of coefficients: a + b + cAll three are equal. Therefore:-b/a = c/a = a + b + c.Hmm, interesting. So first, let&#39;s equate the first two: -b/a = c/a. Since both have denominator a (assuming a ≠ 0, which it is because it&#39;s a quadratic function), we can multiply both sides by a to get -b = c. So, c = -b. That&#39;s useful.Now, since c = -b, we can substitute that into the third equation. The sum of coefficients is a + b + c, which becomes a + b + (-b) = a. So, the sum of coefficients is just a. So, now, we know that the sum of coefficients is a. But we also have that the sum of the zeros (-b/a) and the product of the zeros (c/a) must equal this sum of coefficients (which is a). So, let&#39;s write that:From the first equality: -b/a = a. Similarly, c/a = a.But we already found that c = -b, so let&#39;s substitute that into the second equation. If c/a = a, then (-b)/a = a. But from the first equation, -b/a = a. So, both equations lead to the same conclusion. Let&#39;s solve that equation: -b/a = a. Multiply both sides by a: -b = a². Therefore, b = -a².But we also know that c = -b. Since b = -a², then c = -(-a²) = a². So, now we have relations between a, b, and c:b = -a²c = a²Therefore, the quadratic function can be written in terms of a:f(x) = a x² + (-a²) x + a²So, now, let&#39;s check the common value. The sum of the zeros is -b/a = -(-a²)/a = a²/a = a. The product of the zeros is c/a = a²/a = a. The sum of the coefficients is a + (-a²) + a² = a. So indeed, all three are equal to a. Therefore, the common value is a.Now, let&#39;s look at the options. The question asks, &quot;Their common value must also be which of the following?&quot; The options are:(A) the coefficient of x²(B) the coefficient of x(C) the y-intercept of the graph of y = f(x)(D) one of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x)(E) the mean of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x)So, the common value is a. Let&#39;s check each option.(A) The coefficient of x² is a. So, that&#39;s exactly our common value. So, option A is a possible answer.But let&#39;s check the others just to be sure.(B) The coefficient of x is b, which we found is -a². So, unless a = -a², which would imply a(a + 1) = 0, so a = 0 or a = -1. But a can&#39;t be zero because it&#39;s a quadratic function, so a = -1. But a can be any non-zero real number, right? The problem doesn&#39;t specify constraints on a, so unless there&#39;s a restriction, the coefficient of x is not necessarily equal to a, except in the case when a = -1. Since this is not necessarily the case, option B is not always true.(C) The y-intercept of the graph of y = f(x) is the value of f(0), which is c. We found that c = a². So, unless a² = a, which would imply a(a - 1) = 0, so a = 0 or a = 1. Again, a can&#39;t be zero, so a = 1. But a could be other values, so c = a² isn&#39;t necessarily equal to a unless a = 1. Therefore, option C is not necessarily true in general.(D) One of the x-intercepts. The x-intercepts are the zeros of the function, i.e., the roots. The roots are given by (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). Let&#39;s substitute b and c in terms of a. Since b = -a² and c = a², the discriminant becomes:sqrt(b² - 4ac) = sqrt(a^4 - 4a(a²)) = sqrt(a^4 - 4a^3) = sqrt(a^3(a - 4)).So, the roots are [a² ± sqrt(a^3(a - 4))]/(2a). The common value is a. So, does a equal one of these roots? Let&#39;s check:Suppose x = a is a root. Then, substituting into f(x):f(a) = a(a)^2 + (-a²)(a) + a² = a^3 - a^3 + a² = a². For x = a to be a root, f(a) must be zero. So, a² = 0 implies a = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, x = a is not a root. Similarly, let&#39;s check if a is equal to the other root. It might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps a is equal to the average of the roots?Wait, the mean of the x-intercepts is the sum of the roots divided by 2. The sum of the roots is -b/a = a, so the mean is a/2. So, the mean is a/2. So, if the mean is a/2, then option E is the mean, which is a/2. But our common value is a, so unless a/2 = a, which would imply a = 0, which is invalid, so E is not equal. Therefore, the common value is a, which is the coefficient of x², so option A. Let me confirm:Wait, but in the problem statement, the sum of the zeros, product of the zeros, and sum of the coefficients are all equal. We found that each of these is equal to a. So, the common value is a, which is the coefficient of x². Therefore, the answer is (A).But hold on, let me check the options again. The options are:(A) the coefficient of x²(B) the coefficient of x(C) the y-intercept of the graph of y = f(x)(D) one of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x)(E) the mean of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x)Therefore, since the common value is a, which is the coefficient of x², the answer is (A). So, I think that&#39;s correct. Let me just double-check if maybe there&#39;s an alternative interpretation where the common value is something else.Wait, another thought: The problem says &quot;their common value must also be which of the following?&quot; So, regardless of the values of a, b, c (as long as they satisfy the given condition), this common value must be one of the options. We found that under the given conditions, the common value is a, which is the coefficient of x². Therefore, answer (A). So, unless there&#39;s a trick here, but I don&#39;t think so.Wait, but let&#39;s suppose that the common value is a. So, in the function f(x) = a x² + b x + c, a is the coefficient of x². So, (A) is correct. Let&#39;s see if another option could be equal to a. For example, the y-intercept is c, which is a². If a² = a, then a = 1. But unless a is 1, which is not necessarily the case, because in the problem, we can have any a ≠ 0, as long as the conditions are met. So, unless a is 1, the y-intercept is not equal to a. But the problem says &quot;their common value must also be which of the following&quot;, meaning that regardless of the quadratic function that satisfies the initial conditions, the common value must always be one of the options. Since the common value is a, and a is the coefficient of x², then (A) is the correct answer. The other options could be equal in specific cases (for example, if a = 1, then the y-intercept is 1, which would equal a, so (C) would also be correct), but since the problem asks for what the common value must be in all cases, only (A) is necessarily true.Therefore, the answer is (A). Let me check once more to make sure I didn&#39;t make any miscalculations.Given:Sum of zeros = -b/aProduct of zeros = c/aSum of coefficients = a + b + cSet all equal:-b/a = c/a = a + b + cFrom -b/a = c/a, we get c = -bSubstitute into sum of coefficients: a + b + c = a + b - b = aTherefore, -b/a = a =&gt; -b = a² =&gt; b = -a²Then, since c = -b, c = a²Thus, the quadratic is f(x) = a x² - a² x + a²So, the coefficient of x² is a, which is the common value. So, yes, (A) is correct.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given the quadratic function ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), we know that the sum of the zeros, the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are equal. We need to determine which of the given options this common value must be.1. Sum of the zeros: For a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the zeros (roots) is given by ( -frac{b}{a} ).2. Product of the zeros: The product of the zeros is given by ( frac{c}{a} ).3. Sum of the coefficients: The sum of the coefficients is ( a + b + c ).We set these equal to each other:[-frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{a} = a + b + c]From the first equality ( -frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{a} ), we get ( -b = c ). Substituting ( c = -b ) into the sum of the coefficients:[a + b + (-b) = a]Thus, the sum of the coefficients is ( a ). Therefore, we have:[-frac{b}{a} = a quad text{and} quad frac{c}{a} = a]Solving ( -frac{b}{a} = a ), we get ( -b = a^2 ) or ( b = -a^2 ). Since ( c = -b ), substituting ( b = -a^2 ) gives ( c = a^2 ).Therefore, the quadratic function can be written as ( f(x) = ax^2 - a^2x + a^2 ). The common value of the sum of the zeros, product of the zeros, and sum of the coefficients is ( a ), which is the coefficient of ( x^2 ).Thus, the common value must be the coefficient of ( x^2 ), which corresponds to option (boxed{A}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c. We need to find which of the given options (A to E) must be equal to the common value of the sum of the zeros, the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients of the function. Hmm.First, let me recall some properties of quadratic functions. For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots (zeros) is -b/a and the product is c/a. So, the sum of the zeros is -b/a and the product is c/a. Got that.Then, the sum of the coefficients of the function would be a + b + c. Because the coefficients are a, b, and c, so adding them up gives a + b + c. The problem states that these three things—sum of zeros, product of zeros, and sum of coefficients—are all equal. So, we have three equal quantities:1. Sum of zeros: -b/a2. Product of zeros: c/a3. Sum of coefficients: a + b + cSo, set them all equal to each other. Let me write that down:-b/a = c/a = a + b + c.Let me work with these equations. First, since -b/a = c/a, we can set those equal:-b/a = c/aMultiply both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0, which it is because it&#39;s a quadratic function):-b = cSo, c = -b. That&#39;s one relationship.Now, since c = -b, let&#39;s substitute that into the other equation: c/a = a + b + c.Substituting c with -b:(-b)/a = a + b + (-b)Simplify the right side: a + b - b = a. So,(-b)/a = aMultiply both sides by a:-b = a²So, from here, we can express b as:b = -a²But we already know that c = -b, so substituting b:c = -(-a²) = a²So now, we have expressions for b and c in terms of a:b = -a²c = a²Therefore, the quadratic function can be written as:f(x) = a x² + (-a²) x + a²So, f(x) = a x² - a² x + a²Now, the problem asks what their common value must be. The common value is the value that all three (sum of zeros, product of zeros, sum of coefficients) are equal to. Let&#39;s compute that value.Let me compute each one again with the relationships we found.Sum of zeros: -b/a = -(-a²)/a = a²/a = aProduct of zeros: c/a = a²/a = aSum of coefficients: a + b + c = a + (-a²) + a² = a - a² + a² = aSo, all three are equal to a. Therefore, the common value is a.Now, looking at the options:A. the coefficient of x²: which is a.B. the coefficient of x: which is b = -a².C. the y-intercept of the graph of y = f(x): the y-intercept is c = a².D. one of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x): the x-intercepts are the zeros, but unless a is specific, we can&#39;t say it&#39;s necessarily one of them.E. the mean of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x): the mean of the roots is the sum divided by 2, so (sum)/2 = a/2.We found that the common value is a, which is the coefficient of x². Therefore, the answer must be option A.But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Let&#39;s verify with a specific example. Let&#39;s choose a specific value for a and see.Suppose a = 1. Then, according to our relations, b = -1² = -1, and c = 1² = 1. Then, f(x) = x² - x + 1.Sum of zeros: -b/a = -(-1)/1 = 1. Product of zeros: c/a = 1/1 = 1. Sum of coefficients: 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1. So, all are equal to 1, which is a (the coefficient of x²). The y-intercept here is 1, which is c, so that&#39;s different. The coefficient of x is -1, which is different. The x-intercepts would be solutions to x² - x + 1 = 0. Discriminant is (-1)² - 4*1*1 = 1 - 4 = -3, so complex roots, so no real x-intercepts. But the problem didn&#39;t specify whether the function has real zeros, so maybe complex ones are allowed. The mean of the x-intercepts would be (sum)/2 = 1/2, which is 0.5, not equal to 1. So, in this example, the common value is a, which is option A.Another example: let a = 2. Then, b = -4, c = 4. So, f(x) = 2x² - 4x + 4. Sum of zeros: -b/a = 4/2 = 2. Product of zeros: c/a = 4/2 = 2. Sum of coefficients: 2 + (-4) + 4 = 2. All equal to 2, which is a (coefficient of x²). The y-intercept is 4, which is c, not equal. Coefficient of x is -4. So, again, the common value is a.Thus, it seems that regardless of a, the common value is a, which is the coefficient of x². Therefore, the answer is A.But wait, let me check if there are any other possibilities. Suppose a was different. Wait, in the equations, we derived that the common value is a. Therefore, regardless of the value of a (as long as it&#39;s non-zero, which it is for a quadratic), the common value is a. So, that must be the coefficient of x². So, the answer is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;For the quadratic function ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), we need to determine which of the given options must be equal to the common value of the sum of the zeros, the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients.1. Sum of the zeros: For a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots (zeros) is given by ( -frac{b}{a} ).2. Product of the zeros: The product of the roots (zeros) is given by ( frac{c}{a} ).3. Sum of the coefficients: The sum of the coefficients ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) is ( a + b + c ).We are given that these three values are equal:[-frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{a} = a + b + c]First, equate the sum of the zeros and the product of the zeros:[-frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{a}]Multiplying both sides by ( a ) gives:[-b = c implies c = -b]Next, substitute ( c = -b ) into the sum of the coefficients:[frac{c}{a} = a + b + c]Substituting ( c = -b ):[frac{-b}{a} = a + b - b implies frac{-b}{a} = a]Multiplying both sides by ( a ) gives:[-b = a^2 implies b = -a^2]Since ( c = -b ), substituting ( b = -a^2 ) gives:[c = -(-a^2) = a^2]Now, substituting ( b = -a^2 ) and ( c = a^2 ) back into the expressions for the sum of the zeros, product of the zeros, and sum of the coefficients:- Sum of the zeros: ( -frac{b}{a} = -frac{-a^2}{a} = a )- Product of the zeros: ( frac{c}{a} = frac{a^2}{a} = a )- Sum of the coefficients: ( a + b + c = a + (-a^2) + a^2 = a )All three values are equal to ( a ), which is the coefficient of ( x^2 ). Therefore, the common value must be the coefficient of ( x^2 ).[boxed{A}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e1a50256></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e1a50256><span class="icon" data-v-e1a50256>🔑:</span>By [Vieta&#39;s formulas](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Vieta%27s_formulas), the sum of the roots of a [quadratic equation](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Quadratic_equation) is frac {-b}a,  the product of the zeros is frac ca, and the sum of the coefficients is a + b + c. Setting equal the first two tells us that frac {-b}{a} = frac ca Rightarrow b = -c. Thus, a + b + c = a + b - b = a, so the common value is also equal to the coefficient of x^2 Longrightarrow fbox{textrm{A}}. To disprove the others, note that:mathrm{B}: then b = frac {-b}a, which is not necessarily true.mathrm{C}: the y-intercept is c, so c = frac ca, not necessarily true.mathrm{D}: an x-intercept of the graph is a root of the polynomial, but this excludes the other root.mathrm{E}: the mean of the x-intercepts will be the sum of the roots of the quadratic divided by 2.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-f181db89><span data-v-f181db89>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
