It&#39;s about children bringing treats to a party: cookies, candies, and waffles. The teacher noticed some overlaps between the groups, and we need to find the fraction of those who brought waffles that also brought candies. Hmm, this seems like a problem involving sets and their intersections. Maybe using Venn diagrams or some algebraic approach with fractions?Let me parse the information step by step. The problem gives us three groups: those who brought cookies (let&#39;s call this set C), candies (K), and waffles (W). The teacher provides some ratios about the overlaps between these groups. Let&#39;s list them out:1. Among those who brought cookies (C), exactly 1/3 also brought candies (K). So, the intersection of C and K is 1/3 of C. In symbols: |C ∩ K| = (1/3)|C|.2. Also, among those who brought cookies (C), exactly 1/4 also brought waffles (W). So, |C ∩ W| = (1/4)|C|.3. Among those who brought candies (K), exactly 1/7 also brought cookies (C). So, |K ∩ C| = (1/7)|K|.4. Similarly, among those who brought candies (K), exactly 1/8 also brought waffles (W). So, |K ∩ W| = (1/8)|K|.5. Finally, among those who brought waffles (W), exactly 1/2 also brought cookies (C). So, |W ∩ C| = (1/2)|W|.We need to find the fraction of those who brought waffles (W) that also brought candies (K). That is, we need to find |W ∩ K| / |W|.Okay, so the problem is giving us various ratios between the sizes of the groups and their intersections, and we need to relate them to find the desired fraction. Let&#39;s try to write these relationships as equations.Let me denote the sizes of the groups as:- Let |C| = C- |K| = K- |W| = WBut this might get confusing with the same letters. Maybe better to use different letters. Let&#39;s say:- Let c = |C| (number of children who brought cookies)- k = |K| (number of children who brought candies)- w = |W| (number of children who brought waffles)Then, the intersections:- |C ∩ K| = (1/3)c (from point 1)- |C ∩ W| = (1/4)c (from point 2)- |K ∩ C| = (1/7)k (from point 3)- |K ∩ W| = (1/8)k (from point 4)- |W ∩ C| = (1/2)w (from point 5)But wait, note that |C ∩ K| is the same as |K ∩ C|, so (1/3)c = (1/7)k. So, we can set up equations here.Similarly, |C ∩ W| is the same as |W ∩ C|, so (1/4)c = (1/2)w. So, from this, we can relate c and w.Let me note down all such equations:1. From |C ∩ K| = |K ∩ C|: (1/3)c = (1/7)k ⇒ (1/3)c = (1/7)k ⇒ (c)/3 = k/7 ⇒ 7c = 3k ⇒ k = (7/3)c.2. From |C ∩ W| = |W ∩ C|: (1/4)c = (1/2)w ⇒ (c)/4 = w/2 ⇒ Multiply both sides by 4: c = 2w ⇒ w = c/2.So, we can express k and w in terms of c. That&#39;s useful. Let&#39;s keep that in mind:- k = (7/3)c- w = (1/2)cNow, we need to find |W ∩ K| / |W|. From point 4, |K ∩ W| = (1/8)k. Since |K ∩ W| is the same as |W ∩ K|, we have |W ∩ K| = (1/8)k. Therefore, the fraction we need is (1/8)k / w.But since we have k and w in terms of c, we can substitute them:(1/8)k / w = (1/8)*(7/3)c / (1/2)cSimplify this expression:First, the c in the numerator and denominator cancels out:(1/8)*(7/3) / (1/2) = (7/24) / (1/2) = (7/24)*(2/1) = 14/24 = 7/12.Wait, so that would be 7/12? But let me check this again step by step.Starting with |W ∩ K| / |W| = (1/8)k / w.We know that k = (7/3)c and w = (1/2)c.Substituting:(1/8)*(7/3)c / (1/2)c = (7/24)c / (1/2)cThe c&#39;s cancel:(7/24) / (1/2) = (7/24) * (2/1) = 14/24 = 7/12.So, 7/12. That seems straightforward. But wait, the problem states &quot;among those who brought waffles, exactly 1/2 also brought cookies.&quot; So, we had |W ∩ C| = (1/2)w. But we also have |C ∩ W| = (1/4)c. Since |C ∩ W| = |W ∩ C|, that gives us (1/4)c = (1/2)w, which led us to w = c/2. So, this is consistent.But let&#39;s make sure there are no other overlaps or considerations. For example, do we need to consider children who brought all three treats? The problem doesn&#39;t mention triple overlaps, so maybe we can assume that there are no children who brought all three? Wait, but actually, the problem doesn&#39;t specify, so maybe there could be some children who brought all three. However, the given fractions are about those who brought two treats, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention how many brought all three. Hmm, that might complicate things.Wait a second, hold on. If a child brought all three treats, then they would be counted in all the intersections. For example, a child who brought cookies, candies, and waffles would be in C ∩ K, C ∩ W, K ∩ W, and also in C ∩ K ∩ W. However, the problem states things like &quot;among those who brought cookies, exactly 1/3 also brought candies.&quot; So, does that 1/3 include those who brought all three, or is it only those who brought cookies and candies but not waffles? Hmm, that&#39;s ambiguous.Wait, actually, in standard set notation, |C ∩ K| includes everyone who brought both cookies and candies, regardless of whether they also brought waffles. Similarly, |C ∩ W| includes those who brought cookies and waffles, regardless of candies. So, if there are children who brought all three, they would be included in all those intersections. Therefore, the given fractions might include overlaps of all three. So, the problem might not be accounting for triple overlaps, or maybe assuming that there are none? Hmm, this is a possible oversight in my initial reasoning.Therefore, my previous calculation assumes that |C ∩ K| is exactly the number of people who brought both cookies and candies, including those who also brought waffles. Similarly, |W ∩ K| includes those who might have also brought cookies. So, the fractions given are inclusive of triple overlaps.But the problem is to find |W ∩ K| / |W|, which is the fraction of waffle-bringers who also brought candies, including those who might have brought cookies as well. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 7/12 as I calculated before, even if there are triple overlaps. But maybe my initial equations are missing something because of possible triple overlaps.Wait, let&#39;s think again. Let&#39;s denote:Let’s define:- a = number of children who brought only cookies.- b = number of children who brought only candies.- d = number of children who brought only waffles.- e = number who brought cookies and candies but not waffles.- f = number who brought cookies and waffles but not candies.- g = number who brought candies and waffles but not cookies.- h = number who brought all three.So, the total in C (cookies) is a + e + f + h.The total in K (candies) is b + e + g + h.The total in W (waffles) is d + f + g + h.Now, the problem states:Among those who brought cookies (C), exactly 1/3 also brought candies. So, the number of children who brought both cookies and candies (including those who may have also brought waffles) is (1/3)|C|. Similarly, 1/4 also brought waffles.Similarly, among those who brought candies, 1/7 also brought cookies, and 1/8 also brought waffles.Among those who brought waffles, 1/2 also brought cookies.So, let&#39;s translate these into equations.First, for cookies:1. |C ∩ K| / |C| = 1/3. |C ∩ K| is e + h (those who brought cookies and candies, regardless of waffles). So, (e + h) / (a + e + f + h) = 1/3.2. |C ∩ W| / |C| = 1/4. |C ∩ W| is f + h. So, (f + h) / (a + e + f + h) = 1/4.For candies:3. |K ∩ C| / |K| = 1/7. Similarly, |K ∩ C| is e + h. So, (e + h) / (b + e + g + h) = 1/7.4. |K ∩ W| / |K| = 1/8. |K ∩ W| is g + h. So, (g + h) / (b + e + g + h) = 1/8.For waffles:5. |W ∩ C| / |W| = 1/2. |W ∩ C| is f + h. So, (f + h) / (d + f + g + h) = 1/2.We need to find |W ∩ K| / |W|, which is (g + h) / (d + f + g + h).So, we have five equations and seven variables (a, b, d, e, f, g, h). Hmm, this seems more complicated, but maybe we can relate variables using the ratios.But in my initial approach, I ignored the triple overlap (h) and treated |C ∩ K| as e, |C ∩ W| as f, etc. But actually, |C ∩ K| includes e + h. So, my initial equations were incorrect because they didn&#39;t account for h. Therefore, the previous answer of 7/12 might be wrong because it didn&#39;t consider the possibility of triple overlaps.Therefore, my initial answer might be incorrect. So, need to redo the problem considering h.This seems more complicated, but perhaps we can express variables in terms of h or find relations between them.Let me try to assign variables based on the first approach but considering overlaps.Let’s denote:Let’s let’s set c = |C|, k = |K|, w = |W|.From the problem:1. |C ∩ K| = (1/3)c = e + h2. |C ∩ W| = (1/4)c = f + h3. |K ∩ C| = (1/7)k = e + h4. |K ∩ W| = (1/8)k = g + h5. |W ∩ C| = (1/2)w = f + hWe need to find |W ∩ K| / |W| = (g + h)/w.So, from equations 1 and 3, since |C ∩ K| = |K ∩ C|, we have:(1/3)c = (1/7)k ⇒ k = (7/3)c.Similarly, from equations 2 and 5: |C ∩ W| = |W ∩ C| ⇒ (1/4)c = (1/2)w ⇒ w = (1/2)c / (1/4) = (1/2)c * 4/1 = 2c? Wait, no:Wait, (1/4)c = (1/2)w ⇒ Multiply both sides by 4: c = 2w ⇒ w = c/2.Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, (1/4)c = (1/2)w ⇒ w = (1/4)c / (1/2) = (1/4)c * 2/1 = (1/2)c. So, w = c/2.Wait, okay, so w = c/2.Similarly, from k = (7/3)c.So, we have k and w in terms of c. Let&#39;s keep that:k = (7/3)cw = (1/2)cNow, from equation 4: |K ∩ W| = (1/8)k = g + h. So, (1/8)k = g + h.But we need to find (g + h)/w, which is exactly (1/8)k / w.So, substituting k and w in terms of c:(1/8)*(7/3)c / (1/2)c = (7/24)c / (1/2)c = (7/24)/(1/2) = 7/12.Wait, so even considering that |K ∩ W| includes h (those who brought all three), the answer is still 7/12? But how is that possible? Because h is part of both |K ∩ W| and |C ∩ K|, etc. But in my initial equations, even with h, the answer remains the same because h cancels out in the ratio?Wait, but the key is that even though h is part of multiple intersections, when we express |K ∩ W| in terms of k, which is in terms of c, and then w in terms of c, the h terms get encapsulated in the ratios given by the problem. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 7/12, even considering the triple overlaps. Hmm.But let&#39;s verify this with another approach. Suppose that h ≠ 0. Let&#39;s take actual numbers to see.Let me pick a value for c. Let’s choose c = 12 (divisible by 3 and 4 to make the fractions nice).Then:k = (7/3)*12 = 28w = (1/2)*12 = 6From equation 1: |C ∩ K| = (1/3)*12 = 4 = e + hFrom equation 3: |K ∩ C| = (1/7)*28 = 4 = e + h (same as above, consistent)From equation 2: |C ∩ W| = (1/4)*12 = 3 = f + hFrom equation 5: |W ∩ C| = (1/2)*6 = 3 = f + h (consistent)From equation 4: |K ∩ W| = (1/8)*28 = 3.5 = g + h. Wait, 3.5? Hmm, but we can&#39;t have half a child. So, this suggests that c must be a multiple of 24 to keep everything integer. Let&#39;s try c = 24.c = 24:k = (7/3)*24 = 56w = (1/2)*24 = 12|C ∩ K| = (1/3)*24 = 8 = e + h|C ∩ W| = (1/4)*24 = 6 = f + h|K ∩ W| = (1/8)*56 = 7 = g + hNow, since |W| = 12, which is d + f + g + h. Also, |W ∩ C| = f + h = 6 (from equation 5). So, f + h = 6.Similarly, |C ∩ K| = e + h = 8|K ∩ W| = g + h = 7We need to find |W ∩ K| / |W| = (g + h)/12 = 7/12. So, the answer is 7/12.But let&#39;s check if the numbers add up. Let&#39;s see:Total in C: a + e + f + h = 24We have e + h = 8 and f + h = 6. Let’s denote h as the number who brought all three.Then, e = 8 - hf = 6 - hTherefore, a = 24 - e - f - h = 24 - (8 - h) - (6 - h) - h = 24 - 8 + h - 6 + h - h = 24 - 14 + h = 10 + hSimilarly, total in K: b + e + g + h = 56We have e + h = 8, g + h = 7. So,e = 8 - hg = 7 - hThus, b = 56 - e - g - h = 56 - (8 - h) - (7 - h) - h = 56 - 8 + h -7 + h - h = 56 -15 + h = 41 + hTotal in W: d + f + g + h = 12We have f = 6 - h, g = 7 - hTherefore, d = 12 - f - g - h = 12 - (6 - h) - (7 - h) - h = 12 -6 + h -7 + h - h = (12 -13) + h = -1 + hWait, d = -1 + h? That doesn&#39;t make sense because the number of children can&#39;t be negative. So, this implies that h must be at least 1 to make d non-negative. Let&#39;s set h =1.Then, d = -1 + 1 = 0So, plugging h =1:e = 8 -1 =7f =6 -1=5g=7 -1=6a=10 +1=11b=41 +1=42Check C: a + e + f + h =11 +7 +5 +1=24 ✔️Check K: b + e + g + h=42 +7 +6 +1=56 ✔️Check W: d + f + g + h=0 +5 +6 +1=12 ✔️So, all numbers check out. Therefore, with h=1, which is the number of children who brought all three treats, we have:|W ∩ K| = g + h =6 +1=7, and |W|=12. Therefore, the fraction is 7/12, which matches our previous calculation.Therefore, even with triple overlaps, the fraction is indeed 7/12. So, the initial answer is correct.Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{7}{12}}.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{7}{12}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem of determining the fraction of children who brought waffles and also brought candies, we start by analyzing the overlaps between the groups of children who brought cookies (C), candies (K), and waffles (W). We use the following relationships provided in the problem:1. Among those who brought cookies, ( frac{1}{3} ) also brought candies, and ( frac{1}{4} ) also brought waffles.2. Among those who brought candies, ( frac{1}{7} ) also brought cookies, and ( frac{1}{8} ) also brought waffles.3. Among those who brought waffles, ( frac{1}{2} ) also brought cookies.We denote the number of children who brought cookies, candies, and waffles as ( c ), ( k ), and ( w ) respectively. The key steps are as follows:1. From the overlap between cookies and candies:   [   frac{1}{3}c = frac{1}{7}k implies 7c = 3k implies k = frac{7}{3}c   ]2. From the overlap between cookies and waffles:   [   frac{1}{4}c = frac{1}{2}w implies c = 2w implies w = frac{1}{2}c   ]3. The fraction of those who brought waffles and also brought candies is given by the overlap between candies and waffles:   [   frac{|K cap W|}{|W|} = frac{frac{1}{8}k}{w}   ]Substituting ( k = frac{7}{3}c ) and ( w = frac{1}{2}c ) into the equation:   [   frac{frac{1}{8} cdot frac{7}{3}c}{frac{1}{2}c} = frac{frac{7}{24}c}{frac{1}{2}c} = frac{7}{24} div frac{1}{2} = frac{7}{24} times 2 = frac{14}{24} = frac{7}{12}   ]After verifying with actual numbers and considering possible overlaps (including triple overlaps), the fraction remains consistent. Therefore, the fraction of those who brought waffles and also brought candies is:[boxed{dfrac{7}{12}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have three types of treats: cookies, candies, and waffles. The teacher noticed some overlaps between the groups who brought each treat. The question is asking for the fraction of those who brought waffles that also brought candies. Hmm, okay.First, let me parse the information given. There are three categories: cookies (let&#39;s denote as C), candies (K), and waffles (W). The problem gives us some fractions regarding the overlaps between these groups. Starting with the first part: among those who brought cookies, exactly 1/3 also brought candies, and exactly 1/4 also brought waffles. So, if I let the number of children who brought cookies be |C|, then |C ∩ K| (the number who brought both cookies and candies) is (1/3)|C|, and |C ∩ W| is (1/4)|C|. Then, among those who brought candies, exactly 1/7 also brought cookies, and exactly 1/8 also brought waffles. Similarly, if |K| is the number who brought candies, then |K ∩ C| is (1/7)|K|, and |K ∩ W| is (1/8)|K|.Lastly, among those who brought waffles, exactly 1/2 also brought cookies. So, if |W| is the number who brought waffles, then |W ∩ C| is (1/2)|W|. And we need to find the fraction of those who brought waffles that also brought candies, which would be |W ∩ K| / |W|.Hmm, okay. So, we need to relate all these overlaps. Let me see. Maybe using some Venn diagram principles or set theory equations. Let me note down all the given information:1. |C ∩ K| = (1/3)|C|2. |C ∩ W| = (1/4)|C|3. |K ∩ C| = (1/7)|K|4. |K ∩ W| = (1/8)|K|5. |W ∩ C| = (1/2)|W|6. Need to find |W ∩ K| / |W|Hmm, so notice that |C ∩ K| is the same as |K ∩ C|. So, equation 1 and 3 are related. Similarly, |C ∩ W| is the same as |W ∩ C|. So, equations 2 and 5 are related. Let&#39;s see.From equations 1 and 3: |C ∩ K| = (1/3)|C| = (1/7)|K|. Therefore, (1/3)|C| = (1/7)|K| =&gt; |K| = (7/3)|C|.Similarly, from equations 2 and 5: |C ∩ W| = (1/4)|C| = (1/2)|W|. Therefore, (1/4)|C| = (1/2)|W| =&gt; |W| = (1/4 ÷ 1/2)|C| = (1/4)*(2/1)|C| = (1/2)|C|. So, |W| is half of |C|.Okay, so now we can express |K| and |W| in terms of |C|. Let&#39;s let |C| = x. Then |K| = (7/3)x and |W| = (1/2)x.Now, let&#39;s look at equation 4: |K ∩ W| = (1/8)|K|. Since |K| is (7/3)x, then |K ∩ W| = (1/8)*(7/3)x = (7/24)x.But also, we need to relate this to |W ∩ K|. Since |W ∩ K| is the same as |K ∩ W|, so |W ∩ K| = (7/24)x.But we need to find |W ∩ K| / |W|. Since |W| is (1/2)x, then the fraction is (7/24)x divided by (1/2)x. The x cancels out, so we have (7/24)/(1/2) = (7/24)*(2/1) = 14/24 = 7/12.Wait, so is it 7/12? That seems straightforward, but let me check if there&#39;s something missing here. Because in the Venn diagram, we might have overlaps between all three, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention anything about all three. So, maybe the overlaps are just pairwise? Let me verify.But the problem states &quot;among those who brought cookies, exactly 1/3 also brought candies, and exactly 1/4 also brought waffles.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify if these are separate or overlapping. Wait, so does that mean that 1/3 of cookie bringers brought candies, 1/4 brought waffles, and possibly some brought both? Or is there any information about the intersection of all three?The problem doesn&#39;t mention the intersection of all three, so perhaps we need to assume that the overlaps are just pairwise? But in reality, in set theory, the intersection of all three would be part of the pairwise intersections. Hmm.But if we don&#39;t have information about the triple overlap, maybe we can&#39;t compute it? But perhaps in this problem, since the fractions are given as &quot;among those who brought X, exactly a fraction also brought Y&quot;, then these fractions are considering only Y, not considering if they brought another item. Wait, but actually, the wording is &quot;among those who brought cookies, exactly 1/3 also brought candies&quot;. So, this would be the proportion of cookie-bringers who also brought candies, regardless of whether they brought waffles or not. Similarly, 1/4 also brought waffles, regardless of candies.So, in that case, the total number of cookie-bringers who brought either candies or waffles would be 1/3 + 1/4, but that could overlap. But since we don&#39;t have data on the triple overlap, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the overlaps are distinct? Or maybe it&#39;s possible that some children brought all three, but since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, we can&#39;t assume that. Hmm.Wait, but in order to proceed with the given answer, the initial calculation I did gave 7/12. Let me check again. So, if |K| is (7/3)x, and |K ∩ W| is 1/8 of |K|, which is (7/24)x. Then |W| is (1/2)x, so |W ∩ K| / |W| is (7/24)x / (1/2)x = 7/12. So, 7/12.But let me think again. If the answer is 7/12, that seems possible, but let me verify all steps once more to be sure.First, set |C| = x. Then, from |C ∩ K| = (1/3)x and |C ∩ K| is also equal to (1/7)|K|. Therefore, (1/3)x = (1/7)|K| =&gt; |K| = (7/3)x. Correct.Similarly, |C ∩ W| = (1/4)x and this is equal to (1/2)|W|. So, (1/4)x = (1/2)|W| =&gt; |W| = (1/2)x. Correct.Then, |K ∩ W| = (1/8)|K| = (1/8)(7/3)x = (7/24)x. Then, since |W| is (1/2)x, the fraction is (7/24)x divided by (1/2)x. The x cancels, giving (7/24)/(1/2) = 7/12. Yes, that seems right.But let me check if there&#39;s another way to approach this, perhaps using a Venn diagram with three circles. Let&#39;s see.Let me denote:- C: cookies- K: candies- W: wafflesWe need to find |W ∩ K| / |W|.We have:From C&#39;s perspective:- |C ∩ K| = (1/3)|C|- |C ∩ W| = (1/4)|C|From K&#39;s perspective:- |K ∩ C| = (1/7)|K|- |K ∩ W| = (1/8)|K|From W&#39;s perspective:- |W ∩ C| = (1/2)|W|So, since |C ∩ K| is the same as |K ∩ C|, which gives |C|/3 = |K|/7, so |K| = (7/3)|C|. Similarly, |C ∩ W| = |W ∩ C|, so |C|/4 = |W|/2, which gives |W| = |C|/2.Then, |K ∩ W| is (1/8)|K| = (1/8)(7/3)|C| = 7/(24)|C|. Therefore, |W ∩ K| = 7/(24)|C|.But |W| is (1/2)|C|, so the ratio is (7/24)|C| divided by (1/2)|C| = (7/24)/(1/2) = 7/12. So, same result.Alternatively, maybe using variables:Let’s let the number of children who brought cookies be 12 (to make fractions easier). Then |C| = 12.Then, |C ∩ K| = 1/3 * 12 = 4, and |C ∩ W| = 1/4 * 12 = 3.From |C ∩ K| = 4, which is equal to 1/7 of |K|, so |K| = 4 * 7 = 28.From |C ∩ W| = 3, which is equal to 1/2 of |W|, so |W| = 3 * 2 = 6.Then, |K ∩ W| = 1/8 of |K| = 1/8 * 28 = 3.5. Wait, 28 divided by 8 is 3.5. Hmm, but 3.5 is not an integer. But we assumed |C| = 12, so maybe the actual numbers need to be multiples of certain numbers to avoid fractions.Wait, maybe choosing |C| as a multiple of 24 to make all fractions integers. Let&#39;s try that.Let’s let |C| = 24.Then, |C ∩ K| = 1/3 * 24 = 8|C ∩ W| = 1/4 * 24 = 6So, |K| = 8 * 7 = 56 (since |C ∩ K| = 1/7 |K|)|W| = 6 * 2 = 12 (since |C ∩ W| = 1/2 |W|)Then, |K ∩ W| = 1/8 * |K| = 1/8 * 56 = 7Therefore, |W ∩ K| = 7, and |W| = 12. Therefore, the fraction is 7/12. So, same answer. So, even if |C| is 24, we get 7/12.So, even though when I first tried with |C|=12, I got a non-integer, but when I chose |C|=24, all numbers become integers. So, the answer is 7/12, which is approximately 0.5833.Therefore, the fraction is 7/12. So, I think that&#39;s the answer.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{7}{12}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine the fraction of children who brought waffles that also brought candies. We start by analyzing the overlaps between the groups who brought cookies (C), candies (K), and waffles (W).1. From the perspective of those who brought cookies:   - ( frac{1}{3} ) of those who brought cookies also brought candies: ( |C cap K| = frac{1}{3}|C| )   - ( frac{1}{4} ) of those who brought cookies also brought waffles: ( |C cap W| = frac{1}{4}|C| )2. From the perspective of those who brought candies:   - ( frac{1}{7} ) of those who brought candies also brought cookies: ( |K cap C| = frac{1}{7}|K| )   - ( frac{1}{8} ) of those who brought candies also brought waffles: ( |K cap W| = frac{1}{8}|K| )3. From the perspective of those who brought waffles:   - ( frac{1}{2} ) of those who brought waffles also brought cookies: ( |W cap C| = frac{1}{2}|W| )We need to find ( frac{|W cap K|}{|W|} ).Key steps:- Let ( |C| = x ).- From ( |C cap K| = frac{1}{3}x ) and ( |K cap C| = frac{1}{7}|K| ), we get ( frac{1}{3}x = frac{1}{7}|K| Rightarrow |K| = frac{7}{3}x ).- From ( |C cap W| = frac{1}{4}x ) and ( |W cap C| = frac{1}{2}|W| ), we get ( frac{1}{4}x = frac{1}{2}|W| Rightarrow |W| = frac{1}{2}x ).- From ( |K cap W| = frac{1}{8}|K| ), we substitute ( |K| = frac{7}{3}x ) to get ( |K cap W| = frac{1}{8} cdot frac{7}{3}x = frac{7}{24}x ).Finally, the fraction of those who brought waffles that also brought candies is:[frac{|W cap K|}{|W|} = frac{frac{7}{24}x}{frac{1}{2}x} = frac{7}{24} div frac{1}{2} = frac{7}{24} times 2 = frac{14}{24} = frac{7}{12}]Thus, the fraction of those who brought waffles that also brought candies is (boxed{dfrac{7}{12}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e644746d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e644746d><span class="icon" data-v-e644746d>🔑:</span>Answer: 7 / 12.Solution.

Let me try to visualize it first. They say AD is perpendicular to AB, and AB is parallel to DC. The lengths are given as AB = 4, AD = 2, and DC = 2. N is the midpoint of DC, and M is a moving point inside or on the trapezoid. I need to find the maximum value of the dot product of vectors AM and AN.First, maybe I should sketch the trapezoid to get a better idea. Let&#39;s consider placing the trapezoid on a coordinate system to make things easier. Let&#39;s set point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is perpendicular to AB, and AB is horizontal, AD would be vertical. AB is 4 units long, so point B is at (4,0). AD is 2 units, so point D is at (0,2). Now, DC is parallel to AB and DC is 2 units long. Since DC is parallel to AB and D is at (0,2), point C must be at (2,2) because DC is 2 units long. Let me confirm: from D(0,2) moving 2 units to the right along DC (since AB is horizontal and DC is parallel to AB), so yes, C is (2,2).N is the midpoint of DC. DC goes from D(0,2) to C(2,2), so the midpoint N would be at (1,2).Now, M is any point within or on the boundary of the trapezoid. I need to find the maximum value of the dot product of vectors AM and AN.Let me recall that the dot product of two vectors u and v is given by |u||v|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. But maybe it&#39;s easier to work with coordinates here.First, let&#39;s find the coordinates of vectors AM and AN.Vector AN is from A(0,0) to N(1,2), so AN is (1,2).Vector AM is from A(0,0) to M(x,y), where M is any point in the trapezoid. So AM is (x,y).The dot product AM · AN would be (x)(1) + (y)(2) = x + 2y.So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of x + 2y where M(x,y) is inside or on the boundary of trapezoid ABCD.So, essentially, I need to maximize the linear function f(x,y) = x + 2y over the trapezoid ABCD.In linear programming, the maximum of a linear function over a convex polygon occurs at one of the vertices. But wait, is the trapezoid a convex polygon? Yes, trapezoids are convex. So, perhaps I just need to evaluate x + 2y at each of the vertices and see which one is the maximum. But wait, maybe the maximum is not at a vertex? Wait, no, since it&#39;s a linear function, the maximum over a convex polygon is achieved at a vertex.But hold on, in the problem statement, M can be anywhere within or on the boundary. So, perhaps the maximum occurs at a vertex? Let me check the coordinates of the vertices.Vertices of the trapezoid are A(0,0), B(4,0), C(2,2), D(0,2).Let me compute f(x,y) = x + 2y for each:- A: 0 + 0 = 0- B: 4 + 0 = 4- C: 2 + 4 = 6- D: 0 + 4 = 4So the maximum among the vertices is 6 at point C. But wait, before jumping to conclusion, is there a point on the edges that could give a higher value?But according to linear programming, for a linear function on a convex polygon, the maximum is achieved at a vertex. Therefore, 6 should be the maximum. However, the problem states that M is within or on the boundary. But according to this, the maximum is at vertex C. But wait, let me check again.Wait, but maybe my coordinate system is not correct. Let me confirm the coordinates once again.AB is from A(0,0) to B(4,0). AD is from A(0,0) to D(0,2). DC is from D(0,2) to C(2,2). Then BC connects B(4,0) to C(2,2). So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.Wait, but in that case, the trapezoid is a right trapezoid because AD is perpendicular to AB and DC. The sides BC and AD are the legs? Wait, no. AD is perpendicular to AB and DC. Wait, AB is parallel to DC, and AD is perpendicular to AB, hence AD is also perpendicular to DC. So the trapezoid has two right angles at A and D.Therefore, the coordinates are correct. Then the vertices are as above. So the function f(x,y) = x + 2y evaluated at the vertices gives maximum at point C(2,2) with value 6.But wait, I need to confirm if the point C is indeed part of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid is ABCD, connecting A-B-C-D-A, so yes, C is a vertex.However, I recall that sometimes when maximizing linear functions over a polygon, if the gradient direction is exactly aligned with an edge, then the maximum along that edge could be achieved at a vertex. But in this case, the gradient of f(x,y) is (1, 2), meaning the direction of maximum increase is in the direction of the vector (1,2). So, moving in that direction, the maximum should be at the point where this direction is furthest within the trapezoid.But maybe I need to check if the line x + 2y = k is tangent to the trapezoid at some boundary point. Wait, but since the trapezoid is a polygon, the maximum will occur at a vertex. But just to make sure, let&#39;s think about the edges.Edge AB: from (0,0) to (4,0). On this edge, y = 0, so f(x,y) = x. The maximum here is 4 at B.Edge BC: from (4,0) to (2,2). Let&#39;s parameterize this edge. Let me use a parameter t from 0 to 1:x = 4 - 2ty = 0 + 2tSo f(x,y) = (4 - 2t) + 2*(2t) = 4 - 2t + 4t = 4 + 2tSo as t goes from 0 to 1, f increases from 4 to 6. So maximum at point C is 6.Edge CD: from (2,2) to (0,2). On this edge, y = 2, so f(x,y) = x + 4. The maximum here is at x=2 (point C) with value 6, decreasing to 4 at D.Edge DA: from (0,2) to (0,0). On this edge, x=0, so f(x,y)=2y. The maximum here is at D(0,2) with value 4.So all edges checked, and the maximum on edges is 6 at point C. So that confirms that the maximum over the trapezoid is 6, achieved at point C. Therefore, the answer should be 6.But wait, the problem says M is a moving point within or on the boundary. So if 6 is achieved at point C, which is on the boundary, then that&#39;s acceptable.Wait, but the problem is from a Chinese competition or something? Let me just verify once again.But maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate system. Let me check the trapezoid again.AB is parallel to DC, with AB = 4, DC = 2. AD is perpendicular to AB, so AD is vertical with length 2. So coordinates:A(0,0), B(4,0), D(0,2). Then DC is parallel to AB, so DC is horizontal. Since DC has length 2 and D is at (0,2), then C is at (2,2). Then BC connects (4,0) to (2,2). Correct.So all coordinates are correct.So, the function f(x,y) = x + 2y. At C(2,2): 2 + 4 = 6. So that&#39;s the maximum. So the answer is 6.But wait, maybe there&#39;s a different approach? Let me think again.Alternatively, since vectors are involved, perhaps using vector analysis. The dot product AM · AN. Since A is the origin, vectors AM and AN are just the position vectors of M and N. So their dot product is M · N, where M is (x,y) and N is (1,2). So indeed, it&#39;s x*1 + y*2 = x + 2y. So same as before.Therefore, the maximum value is 6.Wait, but hold on. The problem says &quot;within or on the boundary&quot;. So if point C is allowed, then 6 is correct. However, just to make sure that point C is indeed part of the trapezoid. Yes, since it&#39;s a vertex.Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs somewhere else? Let me see. For example, on the edge BC. Suppose I take a point on BC, not at C. Let me parametrize BC again. From B(4,0) to C(2,2). So parametric equations:x = 4 - 2ty = 0 + 2tt ∈ [0,1]Then, f(x,y) = (4 - 2t) + 2*(2t) = 4 + 2t, which is maximized at t=1, giving 6. So indeed, the maximum on BC is at C.Similarly, on edge CD, from C(2,2) to D(0,2), f(x,y) = x + 4. So decreasing from 6 to 4.So yeah, the maximum is 6. So the answer is 6. So boxed answer: boxed{6}But wait, wait, let me check once again. Suppose I parameterize the entire trapezoid. Let me think of the trapezoid as a union of vertical lines from AB to DC. Wait, no. Since it&#39;s a right trapezoid, maybe it&#39;s better to split it into regions. But perhaps overcomplicating.Alternatively, using calculus. If M is inside the trapezoid, then to maximize x + 2y, take partial derivatives. The gradient is (1,2), which is a constant vector, meaning the function has no critical points inside the domain, so the maximum must occur on the boundary. Which again leads us to the conclusion that maximum is on the boundary, and as checked, at point C.Therefore, I think the answer is 6. So boxed{6}Final Answerboxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;Given a right trapezoid (ABCD) with (AD perp AB), (AB parallel DC), (AB = 4), (AD = DC = 2), and (N) as the midpoint of (DC). We need to find the maximum value of (overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN}) where (M) is a moving point within or on the boundary of the trapezoid.1. Coordinate System Setup:   - Place (A) at the origin ((0,0)).   - (B) is at ((4,0)) since (AB = 4).   - (D) is at ((0,2)) since (AD = 2).   - (C) is at ((2,2)) because (DC = 2) and parallel to (AB).2. Midpoint Calculation:   - (N) is the midpoint of (DC), so (N) is at ((1,2)).3. Vectors and Dot Product:   - Vector (overrightarrow{AN}) is ((1,2)).   - Vector (overrightarrow{AM}) is ((x,y)) where (M(x,y)) is within or on the boundary of the trapezoid.   - The dot product (overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN} = x cdot 1 + y cdot 2 = x + 2y).4. Maximizing the Dot Product:   - The function (f(x, y) = x + 2y) needs to be maximized over the trapezoid (ABCD).   - Check the vertices of the trapezoid:     - (A(0,0)): (0 + 2 cdot 0 = 0)     - (B(4,0)): (4 + 2 cdot 0 = 4)     - (C(2,2)): (2 + 2 cdot 2 = 6)     - (D(0,2)): (0 + 2 cdot 2 = 4)   - The maximum value among the vertices is 6 at point (C(2,2)).5. Verification on Edges:   - Edge (BC): Parameterized as (x = 4 - 2t), (y = 2t) for (t in [0,1]). The function evaluates to (4 + 2t), maximized at (t = 1) (point (C)).   - Edge (CD): Function (x + 4) decreases from 6 to 4.   - Other edges (AB and DA) yield lower values.Thus, the maximum value of (overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN}) is (boxed{6}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. It&#39;s about a right trapezoid ABCD where AD is perpendicular to AB, AB is parallel to DC, AB = 4, AD = DC = 2. N is the midpoint of DC, and M is a moving point within or on the boundary of the trapezoid. We need to find the maximum value of the dot product of vectors AM and AN. Hmm, dot product maximum... I remember that the dot product of two vectors is maximized when the vectors are in the same direction. But since M is moving within the trapezoid, maybe the maximum occurs at a vertex? Not sure yet. Let me visualize the trapezoid first.First, let me sketch the trapezoid. Since it&#39;s a right trapezoid with AD perpendicular to AB, AD is the height. AB is the top base, DC is the bottom base. AB = 4, DC = 2, so the bases are of different lengths. AD is 2 as well. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make this easier. Let&#39;s place point A at the origin (0,0). Then since AD is perpendicular to AB and AD = 2, point D would be at (0, 2). AB is 4 units long, so point B is at (4, 0). Now, DC is 2 units and parallel to AB. Since D is at (0, 2), and DC is 2 units long, and since DC is parallel to AB (which is horizontal), point C must be at (2, 2). Wait, because from D (0,2), moving 2 units to the right along the horizontal gives us (2,2). That makes DC = 2, which matches the given. So, coordinates:A: (0,0)B: (4,0)D: (0,2)C: (2,2)N is the midpoint of DC. DC goes from (0,2) to (2,2), so midpoint N is at ((0+2)/2, (2+2)/2) = (1,2). Wait, midpoint formula: average the x-coordinates and average the y-coordinates. So yes, (1,2). That&#39;s correct.Now, M is any point within or on the trapezoid. We need to find the maximum value of the dot product of vectors AM and AN.First, let&#39;s write down the coordinates of points A, N, and express vectors AM and AN.Vector AN is from point A to point N. Since A is (0,0) and N is (1,2), vector AN is (1,2). So AN = (1,2).Vector AM is from point A to point M. Since M is a moving point, let&#39;s denote M as (x,y). Then vector AM is (x,y). So the dot product of AM and AN is (x,y) • (1,2) = x*1 + y*2 = x + 2y.Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing the expression x + 2y, where (x,y) is any point inside or on the boundary of trapezoid ABCD.So, the problem simplifies to finding the maximum value of x + 2y over the trapezoid ABCD.This is a linear function, and in convex polygons like a trapezoid, the maximum of a linear function occurs at one of the vertices. Wait, is that true? Let me recall. Yes, for a linear function over a convex polygon, the extrema occur at the vertices. Since a trapezoid is a convex polygon, the maximum of x + 2y should be attained at one of the vertices: A, B, C, or D.But let me confirm. The trapezoid has vertices A(0,0), B(4,0), C(2,2), D(0,2). Let&#39;s compute x + 2y for each vertex:- A: 0 + 2*0 = 0- B: 4 + 2*0 = 4- C: 2 + 2*2 = 2 + 4 = 6- D: 0 + 2*2 = 4So the maximum among the vertices is 6 at point C. Therefore, according to this, the maximum value should be 6. But wait, let me think again. Since the function is linear, and the trapezoid is convex, yes, the maximum must be at a vertex. So, M should be at point C to get the maximum value.But wait, the problem says M can be anywhere within or on the boundary of the trapezoid. However, maybe the maximum is actually achieved on an edge, but since the trapezoid is convex and the function is linear, the maximum on an edge would occur at a vertex. So, yes, the maximum should be at vertex C. So the answer is 6? But wait, let me verify this with some other approach to make sure.Alternatively, we can parameterize the trapezoid and use calculus or Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum. Let me try that.First, let&#39;s describe the trapezoid ABCD. Since it&#39;s a trapezoid with AB parallel to DC, sides AB and DC are horizontal. The sides AD and BC are the legs, with AD being vertical. BC connects point B(4,0) to C(2,2). Let me find the equation of side BC.The coordinates of B are (4,0) and C are (2,2). The slope of BC is (2 - 0)/(2 - 4) = 2/(-2) = -1. So the equation is y - 0 = -1(x - 4) =&gt; y = -x + 4.So side BC is the line y = -x + 4 from x=2 to x=4.The other sides are:- AB: from (0,0) to (4,0), y=0.- DC: from (0,2) to (2,2), y=2.- AD: from (0,0) to (0,2), x=0.So the trapezoid is bounded by x=0 to the left, y=0 at the bottom, y=2 at the top, and the line y = -x +4 on the right.So, any point (x,y) inside the trapezoid must satisfy:0 ≤ x ≤ 4,0 ≤ y ≤ 2,and for x between 2 and 4, y ≤ -x +4.Wait, actually, when x is between 0 and 2, the top boundary is y=2, and when x is between 2 and 4, the top boundary is y = -x +4. Similarly, the bottom boundary is y=0.Therefore, the trapezoid can be described as the union of two regions:1. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 2: 0 ≤ y ≤ 2.2. For 2 ≤ x ≤ 4: 0 ≤ y ≤ -x +4.So to maximize x + 2y, we need to consider these two regions.First, in the region 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, 0 ≤ y ≤ 2:The maximum of x + 2y in this rectangle would be at x=2, y=2 (point C), giving 2 + 4 = 6.In the region 2 ≤ x ≤4, 0 ≤ y ≤ -x +4:Here, we can write y in terms of x, so y ranges from 0 to -x +4. So for each x between 2 and 4, the maximum y is -x +4.So, in this region, x + 2y can be written as x + 2*(-x +4) = x -2x +8 = -x +8. But this is a decreasing function of x, so maximum at x=2, giving -2 +8 =6. At x=4, it would be -4 +8=4.Alternatively, if we fix x and take y maximum, which is y = -x +4, so the expression x + 2y becomes x + 2*(-x +4) = -x +8.Alternatively, if we fix x and take y as variable, then x + 2y is linear in y, so maximum at y = -x +4. So substituting that into x + 2y gives -x +8. As a function of x from 2 to 4, this is decreasing, so maximum at x=2, which is 6. So in this region, the maximum is also 6.Therefore, combining both regions, the maximum of x + 2y is 6, achieved at point (2,2), which is point C.But let me check if there is any point inside the trapezoid where x + 2y could be higher. Suppose, for example, a point on the line BC. Wait, BC is from (2,2) to (4,0). So parametric equations: x = 2 + t(2), y = 2 - t(2), where t ranges from 0 to1. So x = 2 + 2t, y = 2 - 2t. Then x + 2y = (2 + 2t) + 2*(2 - 2t) = 2 + 2t +4 -4t = 6 -2t. So as t increases from 0 to1, x +2y decreases from6 to4. Hence, maximum on BC is at point C (t=0), which is 6.Similarly, on the top side DC, which is from (0,2) to (2,2), x +2y =x +4. Since x ranges from0 to2, maximum at x=2, which is 6. So again, point C.On the vertical side AD, x=0, y from0 to2. So x +2y=0 +2y, maximum at y=2, which is 4, less than6.On the bottom side AB, y=0, x from0 to4. x +2y =x, maximum at x=4, which is4, again less than6.Therefore, indeed, the maximum value of x +2y is6 at point C.But wait, the problem says M can be within or on the boundary. So if the maximum is achieved at point C, which is a vertex, then the answer is6.But the problem is presented as a competition problem, so maybe there&#39;s a catch? Let me think again.Alternatively, perhaps I misassigned the coordinates. Let me verify the coordinates again. The problem says in the right trapezoid ABCD, AD is perpendicular to AB, AB parallel to DC, AB=4, AD=DC=2.Right trapezoid means it has two adjacent right angles. Since AD is perpendicular to AB, angle at A is 90 degrees. Then since AB is parallel to DC, and AD is perpendicular to AB, then AD should also be perpendicular to DC? Wait, no. Because AB is parallel to DC, and AD is perpendicular to AB, then AD is also perpendicular to DC. So DC is vertical? Wait, no, AB and DC are both horizontal? Wait, let me clarify.If AB is parallel to DC, and AD is perpendicular to AB, then AD is perpendicular to DC as well. So that would make AD and DC both perpendicular to AB, meaning that AD and DC are vertical? Wait, but DC is supposed to be a base. Wait, hold on. Maybe I got the orientation wrong.Wait, the problem says right trapezoid ABCD with AD perpendicular to AB, AB parallel to DC, AB=4, AD=DC=2. Let&#39;s parse this again.In a trapezoid, the two bases are AB and DC, which are parallel. AD is one of the legs, which is perpendicular to AB, making it a right trapezoid. Since AD is perpendicular to AB, and AB is parallel to DC, then AD must also be perpendicular to DC. Therefore, AD is a vertical side (if AB is horizontal), and DC is horizontal. Wait, but DC is parallel to AB, so if AB is horizontal, DC is also horizontal. AD is perpendicular to AB, so AD is vertical.Given that AD=2, so the vertical leg is 2 units. DC=2, which is the length of the other base. AB=4, the longer base.So in this case, how is the trapezoid shaped? Let me try to visualize again.Starting with AB as the top base, length 4, horizontal. AD is vertical downward from A, length 2, to point D. Then DC is a horizontal base of length 2 from D, parallel to AB. So from D, moving 2 units to the right (since DC is parallel to AB and length 2), we reach point C. Then from C, we need to connect back to B to complete the trapezoid. So BC is the other leg, which is not perpendicular.Wait, if AB is from A(0,0) to B(4,0), then AD is from A(0,0) down to D(0,2). Wait, but AD is supposed to be length 2. Wait, if AD is perpendicular to AB, then if AB is horizontal (along the x-axis), AD would be vertical. But if A is at (0,0), then D would be at (0,2) if we go up, or (0,-2) if we go down. But since it&#39;s a trapezoid, probably AD is upward. Wait, but then DC has to be parallel to AB. If D is at (0,2), then DC is length 2, parallel to AB (which is horizontal), so DC goes from D(0,2) to C(2,2). Then BC connects C(2,2) to B(4,0). That seems correct.So, coordinates:A(0,0)B(4,0)D(0,2)C(2,2)N is the midpoint of DC: (1,2)So the previous coordinates were correct.Therefore, the maximum of x +2y is indeed 6 at point C. So the answer should be 6.But the problem is from an Olympiad, so maybe I need to check another perspective. Let me consider vectors and the dot product.Vector AM is (x,y), vector AN is (1,2). Their dot product is x +2y, which is the same as the linear function. So same conclusion.Alternatively, maybe parametrize point M in terms of the trapezoid&#39;s coordinates. Let&#39;s check edges.For the right side BC, parametrized as earlier, x=2+2t, y=2-2t, t∈[0,1]. Then x +2y=6-2t, so maximum at t=0 (point C) gives 6.For the top side DC: x from0 to2, y=2, so x +2y= x +4, which is maximum at x=2, giving6.For the left side AD: x=0, y from0 to2, x +2y=2y, max at y=2 gives4.For the bottom side AB: y=0, x from0 to4, x +0, max at4.All other edges have max at6.Alternatively, check the interior. Since x +2y is a linear function, in a convex domain, maximum is on the boundary. Therefore, the maximum must be on the boundary, and as we saw, at point C.Therefore, the maximum value is6.But let me think again: suppose M is not restricted to the trapezoid. Then the maximum would be unbounded, but since M is within the trapezoid, the maximum is at C.Alternatively, maybe use projections. The dot product AM · AN = |AM| |AN| cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. To maximize this, we need |AM| cosθ to be maximum, which is the projection of AM onto AN. So the maximum occurs when M is as far as possible in the direction of AN. Since AN is the vector (1,2), direction from A(0,0) to N(1,2). So the line in the direction of AN is y=2x. But since M must lie within the trapezoid, the furthest point along the direction of AN within the trapezoid would be the intersection of the line y=2x with the boundary of the trapezoid.Let me find where the line y=2x intersects the trapezoid.First, check intersection with top boundary y=2. Setting y=2x=2, gives x=1, y=2. So point (1,2), which is point N. But this is on DC? Wait, DC is from (0,2) to (2,2), so yes, (1,2) is midpoint N.Alternatively, check if the line y=2x intersects any other boundaries. From A(0,0) in direction (1,2), the line would go through N(1,2) and then exit the trapezoid. Wait, after N(1,2), the line y=2x would go beyond the trapezoid. For example, at x=2, y=4, which is outside the trapezoid (since the top boundary is y=2 for x up to2, and then y decreases). So within the trapezoid, the line y=2x only intersects at point N(1,2).But since M must be inside the trapezoid, the furthest along the direction of AN is point N. However, when we computed the maximum of x +2y, we found point C gives a higher value. That seems contradictory. Wait, why?Wait, the direction of AN is (1,2). The line y=2x is the direction of AN. The projection of AM onto AN is |AM| cosθ, but the dot product is |AM| |AN| cosθ. So maximizing the dot product can be achieved either by maximizing |AM| in the direction of AN, or by aligning as much as possible. However, since the trapezoid is a bounded region, the maximum may not be along the direction of AN if another point gives a higher value despite not being aligned. Hmm, but according to our earlier calculation, point C gives a higher dot product. Let&#39;s compute the dot product at point C.At point C(2,2), vector AM is AC = (2,2), vector AN is (1,2). Their dot product is 2*1 + 2*2 = 2 +4=6.At point N(1,2), vector AM is AN = (1,2), vector AN is (1,2). The dot product is 1*1 +2*2=1+4=5, which is less than6. So even though N is in the direction of AN, point C gives a higher dot product. That&#39;s interesting.Therefore, maximizing the dot product isn&#39;t just about moving in the direction of AN, but depends on both the direction and the position of M. Since the dot product is linear in M&#39;s coordinates, as shown earlier, the maximum occurs at the vertex C.Therefore, the answer should be6. So I think the maximum value is6, achieved at point C.Final AnswerThe maximum value of (overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN}) is (boxed{6}).&lt;/think&gt;Given a right trapezoid (ABCD) with (AD perp AB), (AB parallel DC), (AB = 4), (AD = DC = 2). (N) is the midpoint of (DC), and (M) is a moving point within or on the boundary of the trapezoid. We need to find the maximum value of (overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN}).1. Coordinates Assignment:   - (A(0, 0))   - (B(4, 0))   - (D(0, 2))   - (C(2, 2))   - (N) is the midpoint of (DC), so (N(1, 2))2. Vectors Calculation:   - Vector (overrightarrow{AN} = (1, 2))   - Vector (overrightarrow{AM}) for a point (M(x, y)) is ((x, y))3. Dot Product Expression:   - The dot product (overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN} = x cdot 1 + y cdot 2 = x + 2y)4. Maximizing the Dot Product:   - The expression (x + 2y) needs to be maximized over the trapezoid (ABCD).   - Evaluating (x + 2y) at the vertices:     - (A(0, 0)): (0 + 2 cdot 0 = 0)     - (B(4, 0)): (4 + 2 cdot 0 = 4)     - (D(0, 2)): (0 + 2 cdot 2 = 4)     - (C(2, 2)): (2 + 2 cdot 2 = 6)5. Conclusion:   - The maximum value of (x + 2y) is 6, achieved at point (C(2, 2)).Thus, the maximum value of (overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN}) is (boxed{6}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e644746d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e644746d><span class="icon" data-v-e644746d>🔑:</span>8. 6 .</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-7a8ab0a4 data-v-e644746d><div class="review" data-v-e644746d><div class="review-title" data-v-e644746d><span class="icon" data-v-e644746d>❓:</span>In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_2=-1, 2a_1+a_3=-1.

Let me start by recalling what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.The problem gives me two pieces of information: 1. The second term, a_2, is -1.2. Twice the first term plus the third term, 2a_1 + a_3, equals -1.Part (Ⅰ) asks for the general formula, and part (Ⅱ) is about finding the value k such that the sum of the first k terms, S_k, is -99.Let me tackle part (Ⅰ) first. Since it&#39;s an arithmetic sequence, I can use the two given equations to solve for the first term a_1 and the common difference d.First, let&#39;s write down what a_2 is. In an arithmetic sequence, a_2 = a_1 + d. The problem says a_2 = -1. So, equation 1 is:a_1 + d = -1.    (1)Then, the second equation is 2a_1 + a_3 = -1. Let me express a_3 in terms of a_1 and d. Since a_3 is the third term, it&#39;s a_1 + 2d. So substituting into the equation:2a_1 + (a_1 + 2d) = -1.Simplify that:2a_1 + a_1 + 2d = -1  3a_1 + 2d = -1.    (2)Now I have two equations:1. a_1 + d = -12. 3a_1 + 2d = -1I need to solve this system of equations for a_1 and d. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.From equation (1), I can express a_1 in terms of d:a_1 = -1 - d.Now substitute this into equation (2):3(-1 - d) + 2d = -1  Multiply out the terms:-3 - 3d + 2d = -1  Combine like terms:-3 - d = -1  Now, add 3 to both sides:-d = 2  Multiply both sides by -1:d = -2.Wait, d = -2. Then substitute back into equation (1):a_1 + (-2) = -1  So, a_1 = -1 + 2  a_1 = 1.So, the first term is 1 and the common difference is -2. Therefore, the general formula for the nth term should be:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d  a_n = 1 + (n - 1)(-2)  Simplify that:a_n = 1 - 2(n - 1)  a_n = 1 - 2n + 2  a_n = 3 - 2n.Let me check if this works with the given information.First, a_2 should be -1. Let&#39;s compute a_2:a_2 = 3 - 2*2 = 3 - 4 = -1. That&#39;s correct.Then, 2a_1 + a_3. Let&#39;s compute a_1 and a_3:a_1 = 3 - 2*1 = 3 - 2 = 1.a_3 = 3 - 2*3 = 3 - 6 = -3.So 2a_1 + a_3 = 2*1 + (-3) = 2 - 3 = -1. That&#39;s also correct. Good, so the general term is a_n = 3 - 2n. So part (Ⅰ) is solved.Now part (Ⅱ): Let S_n be the sum of the first n terms. If S_k = -99, find k.First, recall the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence. It&#39;s S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). Alternatively, S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]. Either formula can be used. Let me try both to see which is more convenient.Since we already have the general formula for a_n, maybe using S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n) is straightforward. Let&#39;s compute a_1 and a_n.We know a_1 = 1, and a_n = 3 - 2n.Wait, hold on. Wait, the general formula is a_n = 3 - 2n. So, for the nth term, it&#39;s 3 - 2n. So, substituting into the sum formula:S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)  = n/2 * [1 + (3 - 2n)]  = n/2 * (4 - 2n)  = n/2 * 2*(2 - n)  = n*(2 - n)  So, S_n = 2n - n^2.Alternatively, let&#39;s verify using the other sum formula:S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]  We know a_1 = 1, d = -2.So:S_n = n/2 * [2*1 + (n - 1)*(-2)]  = n/2 * [2 - 2(n - 1)]  = n/2 * [2 - 2n + 2]  Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s compute inside the brackets:2*1 is 2. Then (n - 1)*(-2) is -2n + 2. So, adding 2 and (-2n + 2):2 + (-2n + 2) = 4 - 2n.Then, S_n = n/2 * (4 - 2n) = n/2 * 2*(2 - n) = n*(2 - n). So same result: S_n = 2n - n^2. So that&#39;s correct.So, the sum of the first n terms is S_n = -n^2 + 2n. Now, we need to find k such that S_k = -99.Set S_k = -99:- k^2 + 2k = -99  Multiply both sides by -1:k^2 - 2k = 99  Bring all terms to one side:k^2 - 2k - 99 = 0.Now, solve this quadratic equation for k. Let&#39;s use the quadratic formula. For ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a).Here, a = 1, b = -2, c = -99.So:k = [2 ± sqrt( (-2)^2 - 4*1*(-99) )]/(2*1)  = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 396)]/2  = [2 ± sqrt(400)]/2  sqrt(400) is 20. So:k = [2 ± 20]/2.Therefore, two possible solutions:k = (2 + 20)/2 = 22/2 = 11  k = (2 - 20)/2 = (-18)/2 = -9.But k represents the number of terms, so it must be a positive integer. So, k = 11.Let me check this. Compute S_11 using S_n = 2n - n²:S_11 = 2*11 - (11)^2 = 22 - 121 = -99. Correct.Therefore, k is 11.Wait, just to be thorough, let me confirm using the other sum formula. Let&#39;s compute S_11 manually by adding up the terms.The terms are a_1 = 1, a_2 = -1, a_3 = -3, a_4 = -5, ..., each term decreasing by 2.So, the sequence is: 1, -1, -3, -5, -7, -9, -11, -13, -15, -17, -19 (11 terms).Sum them up:1 + (-1) = 0  0 + (-3) = -3  -3 + (-5) = -8  -8 + (-7) = -15  -15 + (-9) = -24  -24 + (-11) = -35  -35 + (-13) = -48  -48 + (-15) = -63  -63 + (-17) = -80  -80 + (-19) = -99. Yep, that adds up to -99. So k = 11 is correct.So both parts are solved.Final AnswerⅠ. The general formula is boxed{a_n = 3 - 2n}.Ⅱ. The value of ( k ) is boxed{11}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the arithmetic sequence ({a_n}) with (a_2 = -1) and (2a_1 + a_3 = -1):(Ⅰ) Finding the general formula for the sequence ({a_n}):1. For an arithmetic sequence, the (n)-th term is given by (a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d).2. From (a_2 = -1), we have:   [   a_1 + d = -1 quad text{(1)}   ]3. From (2a_1 + a_3 = -1), we express (a_3) as (a_1 + 2d):   [   2a_1 + (a_1 + 2d) = -1 implies 3a_1 + 2d = -1 quad text{(2)}   ]4. Solving equations (1) and (2):   - From equation (1): (a_1 = -1 - d)   - Substitute into equation (2):     [     3(-1 - d) + 2d = -1 implies -3 - 3d + 2d = -1 implies -3 - d = -1 implies d = -2     ]   - Substitute (d = -2) back into equation (1):     [     a_1 - 2 = -1 implies a_1 = 1     ]5. The general formula for the sequence is:   [   a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1)(-2) = 3 - 2n   ](Ⅱ) Finding (k) such that (S_k = -99):1. The sum of the first (n) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by (S_n = frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)).2. Using (a_n = 3 - 2n):   [   S_n = frac{n}{2} [1 + (3 - 2n)] = frac{n}{2} (4 - 2n) = n(2 - n) = -n^2 + 2n   ]3. Set (S_k = -99):   [   -k^2 + 2k = -99 implies k^2 - 2k - 99 = 0   ]4. Solving the quadratic equation (k^2 - 2k - 99 = 0) using the quadratic formula:   [   k = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 396}}{2} = frac{2 pm 20}{2}   ]   - The solutions are (k = 11) and (k = -9). Since (k) must be positive, we have (k = 11). Final AnswerⅠ. The general formula is boxed{a_n = 3 - 2n}.Ⅱ. The value of ( k ) is boxed{11}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this arithmetic sequence problem here. Let me try to figure out part (I) first. The problem says that in the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_2 is -1, and 2a_1 + a_3 equals -1. I need to find the general formula for the sequence. Hmm, arithmetic sequences have a common difference, right? So, if I can find the first term and the common difference, I can write the general formula.Let me recall that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is the previous term plus a constant difference d. So, the nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.Given that a_2 = -1. Since a_2 is the second term, that would be a_1 + d. So, a_1 + d = -1. Let me write that down as equation (1):1) a_1 + d = -1Then, the second condition is 2a_1 + a_3 = -1. Let me figure out a_3. Since a_3 is the third term, that&#39;s a_1 + 2d. So, substituting into the equation:2a_1 + (a_1 + 2d) = -1Simplify that: 2a_1 + a_1 + 2d = 3a_1 + 2d = -1. So equation (2):2) 3a_1 + 2d = -1Now, I have two equations:1) a_1 + d = -12) 3a_1 + 2d = -1I need to solve these two equations for a_1 and d. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let&#39;s see.From equation (1), I can express a_1 = -1 - d. Then substitute that into equation (2):3(-1 - d) + 2d = -1Compute that:-3 - 3d + 2d = -1Simplify:-3 - d = -1Now, add 3 to both sides:-d = 2Multiply both sides by -1:d = -2Wait, so the common difference d is -2. Then from equation (1), a_1 + (-2) = -1, so a_1 = -1 + 2 = 1. Therefore, the first term is 1 and the common difference is -2. Let me check if that works with the second condition.Compute 2a_1 + a_3. If a_1 is 1, then a_3 is 1 + 2*(-2) = 1 - 4 = -3. So 2*1 + (-3) = 2 - 3 = -1. Yes, that matches the given condition. So that seems correct.So, the general formula for a_n is a_1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1)*(-2). Let me simplify that.First, distribute the -2: 1 - 2(n - 1) = 1 - 2n + 2 = (1 + 2) - 2n = 3 - 2n. Wait, hold on. Wait, (n - 1)*(-2) is -2n + 2. Then adding to 1: 1 - 2n + 2 = 3 - 2n. Yes, so the nth term is 3 - 2n. Let me confirm with the given terms.a_2 should be 3 - 2*2 = 3 - 4 = -1, which matches. a_3 is 3 - 2*3 = 3 - 6 = -3, which is what I had before. So that works. So part (I) answer is a_n = 3 - 2n.Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, starting with a_1 = 1, and d = -2, so the sequence is 1, -1, -3, -5, etc. So term 1 is 1, term 2 is -1, term 3 is -3, term 4 is -5. Yes, that makes sense. So each term decreases by 2. So general term is 1 + (n - 1)*(-2) = 1 - 2(n - 1) = 1 - 2n + 2 = 3 - 2n. Correct. So part (I) is solved.Now, part (II): Let S_n be the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}. If S_k = -99, find k.Okay, so need to find the value of k such that the sum of the first k terms is -99. First, let me recall the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence.The sum S_n is given by (n/2)*(2a_1 + (n - 1)d) or alternatively (n/2)*(a_1 + a_n). Both formulas are equivalent.Since we already have a_n = 3 - 2n, maybe using a_n is easier here. Let&#39;s use S_n = (n/2)*(a_1 + a_n). So, a_1 is 1, and a_n is 3 - 2n. Therefore:S_n = (n/2)*(1 + (3 - 2n)) = (n/2)*(4 - 2n) = (n/2)*2*(2 - n) = n*(2 - n) = 2n - n^2.Alternatively, S_n = -n^2 + 2n. So we can write S_k = -k^2 + 2k. Set that equal to -99:-k^2 + 2k = -99Let me rearrange the equation:-k^2 + 2k + 99 = 0Multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of k^2 positive:k^2 - 2k - 99 = 0Now, solving this quadratic equation. Let me use the quadratic formula. For ax^2 + bx + c = 0, solutions are x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a.Here, a = 1, b = -2, c = -99.So, k = [2 ± sqrt((-2)^2 - 4*1*(-99))]/(2*1) = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 396)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(400)]/2.sqrt(400) is 20. So,k = [2 ± 20]/2So two solutions:k = (2 + 20)/2 = 22/2 = 11k = (2 - 20)/2 = (-18)/2 = -9But k is the number of terms, so it can&#39;t be negative. Therefore, k = 11.Let me check this. Compute S_11 using the formula S_n = -n^2 + 2n. So S_11 = -(11)^2 + 2*11 = -121 + 22 = -99. Yes, that&#39;s correct. Alternatively, compute the sum manually. The terms are 1, -1, -3, ..., up to the 11th term. The 11th term is a_11 = 3 - 2*11 = 3 - 22 = -19.Sum S_11 = (11/2)*(1 + (-19)) = (11/2)*(-18) = 11*(-9) = -99. Correct. So k is 11.Therefore, part (II) answer is 11.Wait, let me verify again using the other formula for the sum: S_n = (n/2)*(2a_1 + (n - 1)d). Here, a_1 = 1, d = -2.So S_n = (n/2)*(2*1 + (n - 1)*(-2)) = (n/2)*(2 - 2(n - 1)) = (n/2)*(2 - 2n + 2) = (n/2)*(4 - 2n) = same as before, n*(2 - n) = -n^2 + 2n. So, same result. So, substituting k=11, gives -99. Correct.So I think that&#39;s solid. So part (I) is a_n = 3 - 2n, and part (II) is k=11.Final AnswerⅠ. The general formula is boxed{a_n = 3 - 2n}.  Ⅱ. The value of ( k ) is boxed{11}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the arithmetic sequence ({a_n}) with (a_2 = -1) and (2a_1 + a_3 = -1):Ⅰ. To find the general formula for the sequence, we start by noting that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is given by (a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d), where (a_1) is the first term and (d) is the common difference. From (a_2 = -1), we have:[a_1 + d = -1 quad text{(1)}]From (2a_1 + a_3 = -1), we substitute (a_3 = a_1 + 2d):[2a_1 + (a_1 + 2d) = -1 implies 3a_1 + 2d = -1 quad text{(2)}]Solving equations (1) and (2), we express (a_1) from equation (1):[a_1 = -1 - d]Substitute (a_1 = -1 - d) into equation (2):[3(-1 - d) + 2d = -1 implies -3 - 3d + 2d = -1 implies -3 - d = -1 implies -d = 2 implies d = -2]Substitute (d = -2) back into equation (1):[a_1 - 2 = -1 implies a_1 = 1]Thus, the general formula for the sequence is:[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1)(-2) = 1 - 2(n - 1) = 3 - 2n]Ⅱ. To find (k) such that (S_k = -99), we use the sum formula for the first (n) terms of an arithmetic sequence:[S_n = frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)]Substituting (a_1 = 1) and (a_n = 3 - 2n):[S_n = frac{n}{2} (1 + (3 - 2n)) = frac{n}{2} (4 - 2n) = n(2 - n) = -n^2 + 2n]Set (S_k = -99):[-k^2 + 2k = -99 implies k^2 - 2k - 99 = 0]Solving the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:[k = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 396}}{2} = frac{2 pm 20}{2}]This gives two solutions:[k = frac{22}{2} = 11 quad text{and} quad k = frac{-18}{2} = -9]Since (k) must be positive, we have (k = 11).

Two Ferries. Two ferries travel between two opposite banks of a river at constant speeds. Upon reaching a bank, each immediately starts moving in the opposite direction.

Determine the width of the river in your mind.</div><div class="divider" data-v-e644746d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e644746d><span class="icon" data-v-e644746d>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. There are two ferries starting from opposite banks of a river at the same time. They go back and forth, meeting each other for the first time 700 meters from one bank, then they meet again 400 meters from the other bank. I need to find the width of the river. Hmm, how do I approach this?First, maybe I should visualize the problem. Let&#39;s imagine the river as a straight line with two banks, left and right. Ferry A starts from the left bank, Ferry B starts from the right bank. They both leave at the same time and move towards each other. They meet the first time 700 meters from the left bank. Then they continue to their destinations, turn around immediately, and meet again 400 meters from the right bank. So, the second meeting is 400 meters from the right bank, which would be (width - 400) meters from the left bank.Let me denote the width of the river as D. So, D is what we need to find.Let me assign variables:Let the speed of Ferry A be v_A and the speed of Ferry B be v_B. Since they start at the same time and meet each other somewhere in between, the time taken for them to meet the first time is t1. Similarly, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting would be t2. But maybe there&#39;s a better way to model this.Alternatively, since they meet twice, maybe I can consider the distances each ferry travels until the first meeting and then until the second meeting.First meeting: They start from opposite banks, head towards each other, meet 700 meters from the left bank. So, Ferry A has traveled 700 meters, and Ferry B has traveled (D - 700) meters. The time taken for this meeting is the same for both ferries. So, t1 = 700 / v_A = (D - 700) / v_B. That gives a ratio of their speeds.From this, we can write that v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700). Let&#39;s keep that in mind.Now, after the first meeting, they continue to their respective destinations. Ferry A has to cover the remaining (D - 700) meters to reach the right bank, and Ferry B has to cover the remaining 700 meters to reach the left bank. The time taken for each to reach the opposite bank after the first meeting would be:For Ferry A: (D - 700) / v_AFor Ferry B: 700 / v_BOnce they reach the opposite banks, they immediately turn around. So, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting is the maximum of these two times? Wait, no. Because they start moving towards each other again after reaching their respective destinations. So, actually, the time between the first meeting and when they start moving towards each other again is determined by when both have turned around. So, the time when both have turned around is when both have reached their destinations. So, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting would be the time it takes for the slower ferry to reach its destination after the first meeting.But actually, perhaps it&#39;s better to compute the total time until they meet again.Let me think. Let&#39;s consider the total time until the second meeting. From the start until the first meeting is t1. After that, each ferry continues to their respective banks, which takes them t2 and t3 time respectively. Then, they immediately turn around and start moving back. The second meeting occurs after some time t4. So, total time would be t1 + t2 + t4 (assuming Ferry A takes longer to reach the bank) or t1 + t3 + t4 (if Ferry B takes longer). But since they meet again, maybe it&#39;s better to think in terms of combined distances.Alternatively, maybe there is a formula or a known approach for such problems. I recall that in some meeting problems, the total distance covered by both vehicles between two meetings is twice the length of the path. Wait, let me think.When they meet the first time, together they have covered the entire width of the river, D. Then, after continuing to the banks and turning around, by the time they meet again, they would have covered 3D in total. Because each ferry has gone to the opposite bank (D) and then partway back. So, combined, they&#39;ve covered 3D. Is that right?Let me verify. First meeting: combined distance D. Then, after reaching their banks, they turn around and meet again. So each ferry has traveled D to reach the opposite bank and then some more. So total combined distance when they meet again would be 3D. So, if the first meeting happens after they covered D together, the second meeting happens after they covered 3D together.If that&#39;s the case, then maybe we can use this to find the ratio of their speeds and then compute D.Let me try this approach.Let’s denote:- At first meeting, combined distance: D = v_A * t1 + v_B * t1.So, t1 = D / (v_A + v_B).But at the same time, Ferry A has traveled 700 meters. So:v_A * t1 = 700Similarly, Ferry B has traveled D - 700 meters:v_B * t1 = D - 700So, from these two equations, we have:v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700)  [Equation 1]Now, for the second meeting. The combined distance covered by both ferries is 3D (as per the reasoning above). Let’s denote the total time until the second meeting as t_total. Then:v_A * t_total + v_B * t_total = 3DTherefore:t_total = 3D / (v_A + v_B)But t_total is also equal to the time until the first meeting plus the time it takes each ferry to reach the opposite bank and then meet again. Alternatively, since after the first meeting, each ferry travels the remaining distance to the opposite bank, then immediately turns around, and starts heading back. The time between the first and second meeting can be calculated.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the total time approach. From start to first meeting: t1 = D / (v_A + v_B)From first meeting to second meeting: t_meet2 = 2D / (v_A + v_B)Wait, because after the first meeting, they have to cover 2D distance to meet again. Hmm, not sure. Wait, if the total combined distance between two meetings is 2D? Let me think again.After the first meeting, each ferry continues to the opposite bank (so combined distance D), then turns around and meets again, so another D. But maybe that&#39;s not quite right. Let me see.Wait, when they meet the first time, they have covered D together. Then, after that, each goes to the opposite bank. So, Ferry A has to go (D - 700) meters, which takes time t2 = (D - 700)/v_A, and Ferry B has to go 700 meters, taking t3 = 700 / v_B. Then, after arriving at the opposite banks, they turn around and start moving towards each other again. The distance between them is again D, and they meet when their combined distance is D. So, the time for the second meeting after turning around is t4 = D / (v_A + v_B). Therefore, total time from start to second meeting is t1 + t2 + t3 + t4. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s note that by the time of the second meeting, Ferry A would have traveled D + x, where x is the distance from the opposite bank (400 meters). Wait, hold on. The second meeting is 400 meters from the other bank, which was the original destination for Ferry A. So, Ferry A, after reaching the right bank (D meters from start), turns around and starts going back. So, by the time of the second meeting, Ferry A has gone D + (D - 400) = 2D - 400 meters. Similarly, Ferry B, which started on the right bank, went to the left bank (D meters), then turned around and went 400 meters towards the right bank. So, total distance for Ferry B is D + 400 meters.Therefore, total distance covered by Ferry A until second meeting: 2D - 400.Total distance covered by Ferry B until second meeting: D + 400.Since they started at the same time and met at two points, the ratio of their speeds should be the same as the ratio of the distances they&#39;ve traveled.So:v_A / v_B = (2D - 400) / (D + 400)But from the first meeting, we had:v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700)Therefore, setting them equal:700 / (D - 700) = (2D - 400) / (D + 400)Cross-multiplying:700*(D + 400) = (2D - 400)*(D - 700)Let me compute both sides.Left side: 700D + 280,000Right side: (2D - 400)(D - 700) = 2D*(D - 700) - 400*(D - 700) = 2D^2 - 1400D - 400D + 280,000 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000So, left side: 700D + 280,000Right side: 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000Set them equal:700D + 280,000 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000Subtract left side from both sides:0 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000 - 700D - 280,000Simplify:0 = 2D^2 - 2500DFactor:0 = D*(2D - 2500)Solutions are D = 0 or D = 2500/2 = 1250.Since D can&#39;t be zero, D = 1250 meters.Wait, so the width of the river is 1250 meters. Let me check if this makes sense.First meeting: 700 meters from left bank. So, Ferry A went 700, Ferry B went D - 700 = 1250 - 700 = 550 meters. So, the speed ratio is 700:550 = 14:11.Now, total time until second meeting. Ferry A has to go another 550 meters to reach the right bank, which takes 550 / v_A. Ferry B has to go 700 meters to reach the left bank, which takes 700 / v_B. Then they turn around.But let&#39;s check the total distance each has traveled until the second meeting.Ferry A: 700 + 550 (to reach the right bank) + (1250 - 400) = 1250 - 400 = 850 meters back. So total distance: 700 + 550 + 850 = 2100 meters.Ferry B: 550 + 700 (to reach the left bank) + 400 meters back. Total distance: 550 + 700 + 400 = 1650 meters.So, the ratio of distances is 2100:1650 = 14:11, which matches the speed ratio. That checks out.Alternatively, using the formula where after first meeting, total distance until second meeting is 2D. Wait, but according to the previous method, total combined distance until second meeting is 2100 + 1650 = 3750. Since D is 1250, 3D is 3750. So that also matches. So, the second meeting occurs after they have covered 3D combined, which is correct.Therefore, the answer is 1250 meters.Final AnswerThe width of the river is boxed{1700} meters.Wait, hold on. Wait, my final answer here says 1250, but when I checked the assistant&#39;s answer at the end, they put 1700. Wait, that must be a mistake. Wait, let me double-check.Wait, in my calculation, I derived D = 1250 meters. But in the original problem, the second meeting is 400 meters from the other bank. Let me verify again.First meeting: 700 meters from left bank, so Ferry A went 700, Ferry B went 1250 - 700 = 550. Speed ratio 14:11.After first meeting:Ferry A needs to go 550 meters to the right bank, which takes 550 / 14 units of time.Ferry B needs to go 700 meters to the left bank, which takes 700 / 11 units of time.Compute the times:550 / 14 ≈ 39.2857700 / 11 ≈ 63.6364So, Ferry A arrives at the right bank in ~39.29 units, turns around, starts going back. Ferry B arrives at the left bank in ~63.64 units, turns around, starts going back.The time between the first meeting and when both are heading back is the maximum of these two times, which is ~63.64 units. Wait, but actually, after Ferry A arrives at the right bank, it starts moving back immediately, so they might meet before Ferry B even reaches the left bank? Wait, no. Because Ferry B is still moving towards the left bank until it arrives. So, between the first meeting and the second meeting, Ferry A takes 39.29 units to reach the right bank and immediately starts back. Ferry B is still traveling towards the left bank for 63.64 - 39.29 ≈ 24.35 units after Ferry A has turned around.So, in that time, Ferry A is moving back towards the left bank at speed 14, covering 14 * 24.35 ≈ 340.9 meters. Meanwhile, Ferry B is still moving towards the left bank at speed 11, covering 11 * 24.35 ≈ 267.85 meters. Wait, but this seems complicated.Alternatively, since after the first meeting, until the second meeting, the combined distance they travel is 2D. Because they go to the ends (distance D) and then meet again (another D). So total combined distance 3D. So, total time is 3D / (v_A + v_B). But the time until the first meeting was D / (v_A + v_B). So, the time from first meeting to second meeting is 2D / (v_A + v_B). So, in that time, each ferry would have traveled 2D * v_A / (v_A + v_B) and 2D * v_B / (v_A + v_B).But after the first meeting, Ferry A has D - 700 meters to go to the right bank, then turns around. Similarly, Ferry B has 700 meters to go to the left bank.Wait, perhaps using the fact that in the total time until the second meeting, Ferry A has traveled 2D - 400 meters, and Ferry B has traveled D + 400 meters. So, their speed ratio is (2D - 400)/(D + 400). But according to the first meeting, their speed ratio is 700/(D - 700). Equate them:700/(D - 700) = (2D - 400)/(D + 400)Cross-multiplying gives 700(D + 400) = (2D - 400)(D - 700)Which led to 700D + 280,000 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000Then 0 = 2D^2 - 2500DThus, D = 1250 meters. So this seems correct.But the assistant initially wrote 1700, which contradicts. Wait, maybe there was a miscalculation.Wait, let&#39;s check the distances again. If D is 1250 meters, then the second meeting is 400 meters from the other bank. So from the right bank, 400 meters, which would be D - 400 = 1250 - 400 = 850 meters from the left bank.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says they meet again 400 meters from the other bank. The first meeting was 700 meters from one bank, then the second meeting is 400 meters from the other bank. So, yes, 1250 - 400 = 850 meters from the original left bank.But in the final answer, the assistant wrote 1700. That must be a mistake. Wait, but how?Wait, perhaps my equation is wrong. Let me recheck.Original equation:700 / (D - 700) = (2D - 400) / (D + 400)Cross-multiplying: 700*(D + 400) = (2D - 400)*(D - 700)Compute left side: 700D + 280,000Right side:First, expand (2D - 400)(D - 700)= 2D(D - 700) - 400(D - 700)= 2D^2 - 1400D - 400D + 280,000= 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000Thus, equation: 700D + 280,000 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000Subtract 700D + 280,000 from both sides:0 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000 - 700D - 280,000Simplify: 0 = 2D^2 - 2500DFactor: D(2D - 2500) = 0 =&gt; D = 0 or D = 1250. So, D = 1250.But where does 1700 come from? Maybe a different approach.Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the distances. Let&#39;s re-examine the problem.The first meeting is 700 meters from one bank. Then they meet again 400 meters from the other bank. Maybe the distances are measured from different banks depending on direction.Wait, when they meet the first time, 700 meters from one bank. Then after continuing, they reach the opposite banks, turn around, and meet again 400 meters from the other bank. So, if the first meeting was 700 meters from, say, the left bank, then the second meeting is 400 meters from the right bank.Thus, the total distance between the two meeting points is D - 700 - 400 = D - 1100. But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s useful.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way.Assume the speed ratio is k:1. Let’s denote v_A = k*v, v_B = v.First meeting: Ferry A has traveled 700 meters, Ferry B has traveled D - 700 meters. Time is t1 = 700/(k*v) = (D - 700)/v =&gt; 700/k = D - 700 =&gt; D = 700/k + 700.Second meeting: total distance covered by Ferry A is k*v*t_total, Ferry B is v*t_total. At the second meeting, they have met again 400 meters from the other bank. Let&#39;s say from the right bank. So Ferry A has traveled D + (D - 400) = 2D - 400 meters. Ferry B has traveled D + 400 meters.Thus, (2D - 400)/k = (D + 400)/1 =&gt; 2D - 400 = k*(D + 400)But from first equation, k = 700/(D - 700)Substitute into second equation:2D - 400 = [700/(D - 700)]*(D + 400)Multiply both sides by (D - 700):(2D - 400)(D - 700) = 700(D + 400)Expand left side:2D(D - 700) - 400(D - 700) = 2D^2 - 1400D - 400D + 280,000 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000Right side: 700D + 280,000So, equation: 2D^2 - 1800D + 280,000 = 700D + 280,000Subtract right side:2D^2 - 2500D = 0Same as before, D(2D - 2500) = 0 =&gt; D = 1250.Therefore, answer is 1250 meters. The initial assistant answer of 1700 is incorrect. Probably a miscalculation when writing the final answer.Final AnswerThe width of the river is boxed{1250} meters.&lt;/think&gt;Let&#39;s denote the width of the river as ( D ). The two ferries start from opposite banks and meet for the first time 700 meters from one bank. They continue to their respective banks, turn around, and meet again 400 meters from the other bank.1. First Meeting:   - Ferry A travels 700 meters.   - Ferry B travels ( D - 700 ) meters.   - The time taken for both ferries to meet is the same, so the ratio of their speeds is ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{700}{D - 700} ).2. Second Meeting:   - After the first meeting, each ferry continues to the opposite bank, turns around, and meets again 400 meters from the other bank.   - Ferry A travels ( D + (D - 400) = 2D - 400 ) meters.   - Ferry B travels ( D + 400 ) meters.   - The ratio of their speeds is also ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{2D - 400}{D + 400} ).3. Equating the Ratios:   - From the first meeting: ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{700}{D - 700} ).   - From the second meeting: ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{2D - 400}{D + 400} ).   - Setting these ratios equal: ( frac{700}{D - 700} = frac{2D - 400}{D + 400} ).4. Solving the Equation:   - Cross-multiplying: ( 700(D + 400) = (2D - 400)(D - 700) ).   - Expanding both sides:     - Left side: ( 700D + 280000 ).     - Right side: ( 2D^2 - 1800D + 280000 ).   - Simplifying: ( 700D + 280000 = 2D^2 - 1800D + 280000 ).   - Subtracting left side from right side: ( 0 = 2D^2 - 2500D ).   - Factoring: ( D(2D - 2500) = 0 ).   - Solving: ( D = 0 ) (not possible) or ( D = frac{2500}{2} = 1250 ).Thus, the width of the river is (boxed{1250}) meters.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. There are two ferries starting from opposite banks of a river at the same time. They go at constant speeds, and when they reach a bank, they immediately turn around. They first meet 700 meters from one bank, then they go to their destinations, turn around, and meet again 400 meters from the other bank. We need to find the width of the river.Hmm. Let me visualize this. Imagine the river is straight, with two banks. Ferry A starts from the left bank, Ferry B from the right bank. They both leave at the same time, heading towards each other. They meet the first time 700 meters from, say, the left bank. Then they keep going, each reaches the opposite bank, turns around, and then on their way back, they meet again, this time 400 meters from the right bank. So, the question is, how wide is the river?Let me denote the width of the river as D. That&#39;s what we need to find.Let’s denote the speed of Ferry A as v_A and the speed of Ferry B as v_B. Both ferries have constant speeds, and they turn around instantly upon reaching a bank, so there&#39;s no time lost in turning.First, when they meet the first time, they&#39;ve been traveling for the same amount of time, t1. At that time, Ferry A has traveled 700 meters, and Ferry B has traveled D - 700 meters. So, the time taken until the first meeting is t1 = 700 / v_A = (D - 700) / v_B. Therefore, the ratio of their speeds is v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700). Let&#39;s call this Equation 1.Then, after the first meeting, they continue to their respective destinations. Ferry A has to cover the remaining D - 700 meters to reach the right bank, and Ferry B has to cover the remaining 700 meters to reach the left bank. The time taken for Ferry A to reach the right bank after the first meeting is (D - 700) / v_A, and similarly, the time taken for Ferry B to reach the left bank is 700 / v_B.After reaching their respective banks, they turn around immediately. So, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting is the time each takes to reach the opposite bank plus the time they take to start coming back and meet again.Wait, no. Actually, after they each reach their respective banks, they turn around and start heading back. So the total time between the first meeting and the second meeting is the time for each to reach the opposite bank and then start moving back towards each other again. But the key is that they both turn around instantaneously, so the total time between the first meeting and the second meeting is the same for both ferries.Wait, maybe I need to consider the total time until the second meeting.From the start until the first meeting: t1.From the first meeting until they reach their destinations: t2 for Ferry A to go from meeting point to right bank, and t2&#39; for Ferry B to go from meeting point to left bank. But since t2 = (D - 700)/v_A and t2&#39; = 700/v_B. But these times might be different. However, after reaching their destinations, they immediately turn around. So the next time they start moving towards each other again, but the time between the first meeting and the second meeting is actually t2 + t3, where t3 is the time after turning around until they meet again.Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Alternatively, consider the total distance each ferry has traveled by the time of the second meeting.From the start until the first meeting: Ferry A has gone 700 m, Ferry B has gone D - 700 m.Then, they continue to the opposite banks: Ferry A travels another D - 700 m to reach the right bank, then turns around and starts back. Similarly, Ferry B travels another 700 m to reach the left bank, turns around, and starts back.Then, they meet again 400 m from the right bank. So, from the right bank, Ferry A has traveled 400 m towards the left bank when they meet the second time. Therefore, Ferry A has gone (D - 700) + 400 = D - 300 m after the first meeting. Similarly, Ferry B has gone 700 + (D - 400) = D + 300 m after the first meeting? Wait, maybe not.Wait, let&#39;s think step by step.First meeting: Ferry A has traveled 700 m, Ferry B has traveled D - 700 m. Total distance covered by both: 700 + (D - 700) = D. So, the time taken for the first meeting is t1 = D / (v_A + v_B). Wait, that&#39;s a standard formula when two objects move towards each other. So, t1 = D / (v_A + v_B). But also, t1 = 700 / v_A = (D - 700)/v_B. So, this gives the same ratio as before: v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700).Then, after the first meeting, each ferry continues to the opposite bank. Ferry A has D - 700 m left to go to reach the right bank, so it takes t2 = (D - 700)/v_A. Similarly, Ferry B has 700 m left to reach the left bank, taking t2&#39; = 700 / v_B.Then, after reaching the banks, they turn around and start moving back. Now, the distance between them is again D, but they are moving towards each other again, but starting from opposite banks. However, the second meeting occurs 400 m from the right bank. So, when they meet the second time, Ferry A has traveled from the right bank towards the left bank 400 m, so its position is 400 m from the right bank, which is D - 400 m from the left bank. Similarly, Ferry B has traveled from the left bank towards the right bank D - 400 m, so it&#39;s D - 400 m from the left bank, which is 400 m from the right bank. Wait, no. Wait, if they meet 400 m from the right bank, that means from the right bank, Ferry A has traveled 400 m towards the left, and Ferry B has traveled D - 400 m from the left bank towards the right.But the key is to calculate the total distance each has traveled from the start until the second meeting.From the start to first meeting: Ferry A: 700 m, Ferry B: D - 700 m.From first meeting to reaching the opposite bank: Ferry A travels D - 700 m, Ferry B travels 700 m.Then, they turn around and start moving back. The time between the first meeting and the second meeting would be the time taken for each to reach the opposite bank plus the time taken to meet again.But perhaps a better approach is to consider the total distance each ferry has traveled until the second meeting.When they meet the second time, the total distance covered by both ferries together would be 3D. Because first, they covered D to meet the first time, then each goes to the opposite bank (another D total), then they start moving towards each other again and cover another D to meet. Wait, but actually, the total distance covered when they meet the second time is 3D. Because first meeting: D. Then each goes to the opposite bank: another D. Then they start moving towards each other and meet again: another D. So total 3D. Therefore, the total time until the second meeting is 3D / (v_A + v_B).Alternatively, maybe not. Let&#39;s see:First, they start moving towards each other, meet after covering D total. Then, each continues to the opposite bank: Ferry A goes from meeting point to opposite bank, which is D - 700 m, and Ferry B goes from meeting point to opposite bank, which is 700 m. Then, they turn around and start moving towards each other again. The distance between them is again D, so they meet after covering another D. But in this case, the total distance would be D + 2D = 3D? Hmm.Wait, maybe another way. Let&#39;s compute the total distance each ferry has traveled until the second meeting.For Ferry A:From start to first meeting: 700 m.From first meeting to right bank: D - 700 m.From right bank to second meeting: 400 m.Total: 700 + (D - 700) + 400 = D + 400 m.For Ferry B:From start to first meeting: D - 700 m.From first meeting to left bank: 700 m.From left bank to second meeting: D - 400 m. (Because they meet 400 m from the right bank, so D - 400 m from the left bank.)Total: (D - 700) + 700 + (D - 400) = 2D - 400 m.So, total distance covered by both ferries until second meeting: (D + 400) + (2D - 400) = 3D.Which aligns with the idea that together they&#39;ve covered 3D. Therefore, the total time taken until the second meeting is 3D / (v_A + v_B).But from the perspective of each ferry, the time is also equal to the total distance each has traveled divided by their respective speeds.For Ferry A, total time is (D + 400) / v_A.For Ferry B, total time is (2D - 400) / v_B.Since these times are equal, we have:(D + 400) / v_A = (2D - 400) / v_B.But from the first meeting, we have the ratio of their speeds: v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700). Let&#39;s call this Equation 1.Let me write down the two equations:1) v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700)2) (D + 400) / v_A = (2D - 400) / v_BFrom equation 1, we can express v_A = (700 / (D - 700)) * v_B.Substitute into equation 2:(D + 400) / [(700 / (D - 700)) * v_B] = (2D - 400) / v_BMultiply both sides by v_B:(D + 400) / (700 / (D - 700)) = 2D - 400Simplify left side:(D + 400) * (D - 700) / 700 = 2D - 400Multiply both sides by 700:(D + 400)(D - 700) = 700*(2D - 400)Expand the left side:D*(D - 700) + 400*(D - 700) = 1400D - 280000= D² - 700D + 400D - 280000 = D² - 300D - 280000Right side: 1400D - 280000So:D² - 300D - 280000 = 1400D - 280000Subtract 1400D - 280000 from both sides:D² - 300D - 280000 - 1400D + 280000 = 0Simplify:D² - 1700D = 0Factor:D(D - 1700) = 0So, D = 0 or D = 1700.Since the width of the river can&#39;t be zero, D = 1700 meters.Wait, let me check if that makes sense.If D = 1700 meters.First meeting: Ferry A has traveled 700 m, so Ferry B has traveled 1700 - 700 = 1000 m. Therefore, the speed ratio is 700:1000 = 7:10.Then, after the first meeting, Ferry A has 1700 - 700 = 1000 m left to go to the right bank, which at speed 7, takes 1000 / 7 time units. Ferry B has 700 m left to the left bank, which at speed 10, takes 700 / 10 = 70 time units.Wait, but the time taken for Ferry A to reach the right bank is 1000 / 7 ≈ 142.857, and for Ferry B to reach the left bank is 70. So Ferry B arrives at the left bank sooner, turns around, and starts moving back. Then, Ferry A is still traveling towards the right bank.Wait, but this seems conflicting. If Ferry B arrives at the left bank in 70 time units, turns around, and starts moving back. Then, in the remaining time until Ferry A arrives at the right bank, which is 142.857 - 70 = 72.857 time units, Ferry B would have traveled 72.857 * 10 = 728.57 meters back towards the right bank. So, by the time Ferry A turns around, Ferry B is already 728.57 meters from the left bank, which is 1700 - 728.57 ≈ 971.43 meters from the right bank.Then, both ferries start moving towards each other again: Ferry A from the right bank, Ferry B from 728.57 meters from the left bank. The distance between them is 1700 - 728.57 ≈ 971.43 meters. Their combined speed is 7 + 10 = 17 m/unit time. The time taken to meet again is 971.43 / 17 ≈ 57.14 time units. In this time, Ferry A would have traveled 7 * 57.14 ≈ 400 meters, which matches the second meeting point 400 meters from the right bank. Similarly, Ferry B would have traveled 10 * 57.14 ≈ 571.43 meters, so from 728.57 meters from the left bank, adding 571.43 meters towards the right bank gives 728.57 + 571.43 = 1300 meters from the left bank, which is 1700 - 1300 = 400 meters from the right bank. So that checks out.Therefore, D = 1700 meters is indeed the correct answer.But let me confirm my equations again.From the first meeting:v_A / v_B = 700 / (D - 700)From the total distances:Ferry A: 700 + (D - 700) + 400 = D + 400Ferry B: (D - 700) + 700 + (D - 400) = 2D - 400Therefore, time for Ferry A: (D + 400)/v_ATime for Ferry B: (2D - 400)/v_BSetting equal:(D + 400)/v_A = (2D - 400)/v_BCross multiplying:v_B*(D + 400) = v_A*(2D - 400)But from first equation, v_A = (700 / (D - 700)) * v_BSubstitute:v_B*(D + 400) = (700 / (D - 700)) * v_B*(2D - 400)Cancel v_B:(D + 400) = (700 / (D - 700))*(2D - 400)Multiply both sides by (D - 700):(D + 400)(D - 700) = 700*(2D - 400)Expand left side:D^2 -700D +400D -280000 = D^2 -300D -280000Right side: 1400D -280000So:D^2 -300D -280000 =1400D -280000Subtract 1400D -280000 from both sides:D^2 -300D -280000 -1400D +280000 = D^2 -1700D =0Thus, D(D -1700)=0. So D=1700. Correct.Therefore, the width of the river is 1700 meters.Final AnswerThe width of the river is boxed{1700} meters.&lt;/think&gt;Let&#39;s denote the width of the river as ( D ). The ferries meet for the first time 700 meters from one bank and then meet again 400 meters from the other bank. We need to determine ( D ).1. First Meeting:   - Ferry A travels 700 meters.   - Ferry B travels ( D - 700 ) meters.   - The ratio of their speeds is ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{700}{D - 700} ).2. Second Meeting:   - After the first meeting, Ferry A travels ( D - 700 ) meters to the opposite bank, turns around, and travels 400 meters back.   - Ferry B travels 700 meters to the opposite bank, turns around, and travels ( D - 400 ) meters back.   - Total distance traveled by Ferry A until the second meeting: ( 700 + (D - 700) + 400 = D + 400 ).   - Total distance traveled by Ferry B until the second meeting: ( (D - 700) + 700 + (D - 400) = 2D - 400 ).3. Time Equality:   - The time taken by both ferries until the second meeting must be equal.   - For Ferry A: ( frac{D + 400}{v_A} )   - For Ferry B: ( frac{2D - 400}{v_B} )   - Equating these times and using the speed ratio from the first meeting:     [     frac{D + 400}{v_A} = frac{2D - 400}{v_B}     ]     Substituting ( v_A = frac{700}{D - 700} v_B ):     [     frac{D + 400}{frac{700}{D - 700} v_B} = frac{2D - 400}{v_B}     ]     Simplifying:     [     (D + 400)(D - 700) = 700(2D - 400)     ]     Expanding and solving:     [     D^2 - 300D - 280000 = 1400D - 280000     ]     [     D^2 - 1700D = 0     ]     [     D(D - 1700) = 0     ]     Thus, ( D = 1700 ).The width of the river is (boxed{1700}) meters.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e644746d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e644746d><span class="icon" data-v-e644746d>🔑:</span>117. Ferry A departs from the shore, travels 700 m, and meets ferry B. By this time, they have covered a total distance equal to the width of the river. A continues to the opposite shore, turns around, and after turning, travels another 400 m, meeting B again. By this time, they have covered a total distance equal to three times the width of the river. Since their speeds are constant, A has traveled a total distance of 3 times 700 = 2100 m.

It&#39;s about a parabola and a hyperbola, their foci, and some geometric conditions. Hmm, let&#39;s parse the problem again.We have a parabola C₁: y = (1/(2p))x² where p &gt; 0. The focus of this parabola is connected by a line to the right focus of a hyperbola C₂: x²/8 - y² = 1. This line intersects the parabola C₁ at a point M in the first quadrant. The tangent line to C₁ at M is parallel to one of the asymptotes of C₂. We need to find the value of p.The answer choices are given, so that might help check our work. Let&#39;s break this down into parts.First, let&#39;s recall some basics about parabolas and hyperbolas.For the parabola C₁: y = (1/(2p))x². The standard form of a parabola that opens upward is y = (1/(4f))x², where f is the focal length. Comparing this to the given equation, 1/(4f) = 1/(2p), so 4f = 2p, meaning f = p/2. Therefore, the focus of C₁ is at (0, f) = (0, p/2).Now, for the hyperbola C₂: x²/8 - y² = 1. The standard form of a hyperbola opening horizontally is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1. Here, a² = 8, so a = 2√2, and b² = 1, so b = 1. The foci of a hyperbola are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². Therefore, c² = 8 + 1 = 9, so c = 3. Thus, the foci of C₂ are at (3, 0) and (-3, 0). The right focus is (3, 0).So, the line we are considering connects the focus of C₁, which is (0, p/2), to the right focus of C₂, which is (3, 0). This line intersects the parabola C₁ again at point M in the first quadrant. The tangent to C₁ at M must be parallel to one of the asymptotes of C₂.First, let&#39;s find the equations of the asymptotes of C₂. For the hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x. Here, b = 1, a = 2√2, so the asymptotes are y = ±(1/(2√2))x. Therefore, their slopes are ±1/(2√2). Since the tangent at M is parallel to one of these, the slope of the tangent line at M must be either 1/(2√2) or -1/(2√2). However, since point M is in the first quadrant, and the parabola is opening upwards, the tangent line at M should have a positive slope. The negative slope would correspond to a tangent in the second quadrant, but since M is in the first quadrant, we can consider the positive slope. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at M is 1/(2√2).Now, for the parabola C₁: y = (1/(2p))x². The derivative dy/dx = (1/p)x. This derivative gives the slope of the tangent line at any point x. Therefore, at point M with x-coordinate x₀, the slope is (1/p)x₀. We set this equal to 1/(2√2):(1/p)x₀ = 1/(2√2) → x₀ = p/(2√2).Therefore, the x-coordinate of point M is p/(2√2). Then, substituting back into the equation of C₁, the y-coordinate is:y₀ = (1/(2p))(x₀)² = (1/(2p))(p²/(8*2)) [Wait, let&#39;s compute x₀²:x₀ = p/(2√2), so x₀² = p²/(4*2) = p²/8. Then,y₀ = (1/(2p))(p²/8) = (p²)/(16p) = p/16.Therefore, point M has coordinates (p/(2√2), p/16).Now, point M lies on the line connecting the focus of C₁ (0, p/2) and the right focus of C₂ (3, 0). Let&#39;s verify this.We can find the equation of the line connecting (0, p/2) and (3, 0). The slope of this line is (0 - p/2)/(3 - 0) = (-p/2)/3 = -p/6.Using point-slope form, the equation of the line is:y - p/2 = (-p/6)(x - 0) → y = (-p/6)x + p/2.Since point M (p/(2√2), p/16) lies on this line, substituting x = p/(2√2) into the equation should give y = p/16.Let&#39;s check:y = (-p/6)(p/(2√2)) + p/2 = (-p²)/(12√2) + p/2.This must equal p/16. Therefore:(-p²)/(12√2) + p/2 = p/16.Let&#39;s solve this equation for p.First, multiply both sides by 48√2 to eliminate denominators:48√2 * [ (-p²)/(12√2) + p/2 ] = 48√2 * (p/16)Simplify term by term:First term: 48√2 * (-p²)/(12√2) = (48/12)*(√2/√2)*(-p²) = 4*1*(-p²) = -4p².Second term: 48√2 * (p/2) = 24√2 p.Right side: 48√2*(p/16) = 3√2 p.Therefore, equation becomes:-4p² + 24√2 p = 3√2 p.Bring all terms to left side:-4p² + 24√2 p - 3√2 p = 0 → -4p² + 21√2 p = 0.Factor out p:p(-4p + 21√2) = 0.Solutions are p = 0 or -4p + 21√2 = 0 → p = (21√2)/4.But p &gt; 0 is given, so p = 21√2/4.Looking at the options, option D is 21√2/4.Wait, but let&#39;s double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.Let&#39;s go through the steps again.Equation of the line: y = (-p/6)x + p/2.Point M is on this line and on the parabola.Coordinates of M: (p/(2√2), p/16).So substitute x into line equation:y = (-p/6)(p/(2√2)) + p/2 = (-p²)/(12√2) + p/2.Set equal to p/16:(-p²)/(12√2) + p/2 = p/16.Multiply both sides by 48√2:Left side:(-p²)/(12√2) *48√2 = (-p²) * (48√2)/(12√2) = (-p²)*4 = -4p²p/2 *48√2 = 24√2 pRight side:p/16 *48√2 = 3√2 pThus equation: -4p² +24√2 p =3√2 pSubtract 3√2 p: -4p² +21√2 p=0Factor: p(-4p +21√2)=0Solutions: p=0 or p=21√2 /4.Since p&gt;0, p=21√2 /4, which is option D.But wait, the answer choices are:A: 7√2/16B:7√2/8C:21√2/8D:21√2/4So D is the answer. However, let me check again because in the problem statement, the hyperbola is x²/8 - y²=1. So for hyperbola, a²=8, b²=1, so c²=a² + b²=9, c=3. That&#39;s correct. The right focus is (3,0). The parabola&#39;s focus is (0, p/2). So the line connects (0, p/2) and (3,0), intersects parabola at M in first quadrant. The tangent at M has slope 1/(2√2). We found that p=21√2/4, which is option D.But let&#39;s check if the coordinates of M make sense. x-coordinate is p/(2√2) = (21√2/4)/(2√2) = 21√2/(4*2√2) = 21/(8). Similarly, y-coordinate is p/16 = (21√2/4)/16 = 21√2/(64). So point M is (21/8, 21√2/64). Let&#39;s check if this is in the first quadrant: yes, both coordinates positive. Also, plugging x=21/8 into the parabola equation y=1/(2p)x²:1/(2p)*(21/8)^2 = (441/64)/(2p) = 441/(128p). But p=21√2/4, so 441/(128*(21√2/4)) = (441*4)/(128*21√2) = (21*21*4)/(128*21√2) = (21*4)/(128√2) = (84)/(128√2) = (21)/(32√2) = Multiply numerator and denominator by √2: 21√2/(64). Which matches the y-coordinate. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, seems like D is the answer. But the options given have C:21√2/8 and D:21√2/4. So D is the larger one. Let me check once more.Wait, when solving for p, after factoring:p(-4p +21√2)=0.So -4p +21√2=0 → 4p=21√2 → p=21√2/4. Correct. So yes, D.But I wonder if there is a miscalculation when solving for the coordinates of M.Alternatively, perhaps the slope was considered as negative? Wait, the problem says &quot;parallel to one asymptote&quot;. The asymptotes have slopes ±1/(2√2). Since the tangent line is at a point in the first quadrant, the slope should be positive, right? Because in the first quadrant, moving to the right and up. If the slope were negative, the tangent would be going down from left to right, but since the parabola is opening upwards, all tangent lines in the first quadrant should have positive slope. So slope is positive 1/(2√2). So our calculation is correct.Alternatively, maybe the line connecting the two foci intersects the parabola at two points: the focus of the parabola (which is (0,p/2)) and point M. But the focus of the parabola isn&#39;t on the parabola itself, unless for a parabola, the focus is at (0,p/2), but the parabola is y=(1/(2p))x². Let me check: For a standard parabola y = (1/(4f))x², the focus is at (0,f). Here, comparing, 1/(4f)=1/(2p) → f = p/2. Therefore, the focus is at (0, p/2), which is not on the parabola, since plugging x=0 into parabola gives y=0. So the line connects (0,p/2) to (3,0) and intersects the parabola at point M (and maybe another point). But since the focus isn&#39;t on the parabola, the line would intersect the parabola at two points: one is M in the first quadrant, and maybe another point. Wait, but in our calculation, we found that point M is (p/(2√2), p/16). Let&#39;s see: if we set up the equation of the line and the parabola, we should get two solutions. Let&#39;s check.Equation of parabola: y = (1/(2p))x².Equation of line: y = (-p/6)x + p/2.Set equal: (1/(2p))x² = (-p/6)x + p/2.Multiply both sides by 6p to eliminate denominators:3x² = -p²x + 3p².Bring all terms to left:3x² + p²x - 3p² = 0.This quadratic in x should have two solutions. Let&#39;s compute discriminant D:D = (p²)^2 - 4*3*(-3p²) = p^4 + 36p² = p²(p² + 36).Since p &gt; 0, D is positive, so two real roots.Therefore, the line intersects the parabola at two points.But we are interested in the one in the first quadrant, which is point M. The other intersection point might be in a different quadrant.But in our calculation, we found x₀ = p/(2√2), which is positive (since p &gt;0), so M is in the first quadrant. Then, the other solution would be some x negative? Let&#39;s solve the quadratic equation 3x² + p²x -3p² =0.Using quadratic formula:x = [-p² ± sqrt(p^4 +36p²)]/(6).So,x = [ -p² ± p*sqrt(p² + 36) ]/(6).We take the positive root for the first quadrant:x = [ -p² + p*sqrt(p² + 36) ]/(6).But we had found x₀ = p/(2√2). Let&#39;s check if that is equal to [ -p² + p*sqrt(p² + 36) ]/(6).Wait, maybe this is another approach. But given that we found a consistent solution where p=21√2/4, and all the checks work, maybe it&#39;s correct.Alternatively, perhaps the line connecting (0, p/2) and (3,0) intersects the parabola at M, and when we found x₀, that is the x-coordinate of M, which we related via the slope of the tangent. Then, solving gives p=21√2/4, which is answer D.Therefore, unless there&#39;s an error in the problem interpretation, which I don&#39;t see, the answer should be D.But let me check once more.Wait, the hyperbola&#39;s asymptotes have slope ±1/(2√2). The tangent at M must be parallel to one of these, so slope ±1/(2√2). We considered the positive slope because M is in the first quadrant. Then, dy/dx = (1/p)x = 1/(2√2) → x = p/(2√2). Then, point M is (p/(2√2), p/16). Then, this point lies on the line connecting (0, p/2) and (3, 0). So substituting into the line&#39;s equation gives the equation which leads to p=21√2/4. So all steps are correct.Yes, so answer D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given the parabola ( C_1: y = frac{1}{2p}x^2 ) with ( p &gt; 0 ), its focus is at ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ). The hyperbola ( C_2: frac{x^2}{8} - y^2 = 1 ) has foci at ( (pm 3, 0) ). The right focus of the hyperbola is ( (3, 0) ). The line connecting ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ) and ( (3, 0) ) intersects ( C_1 ) at point ( M ) in the first quadrant. The tangent line at ( M ) is parallel to an asymptote of ( C_2 ), which has slopes ( pm frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ).1. Slope of the tangent line at ( M ):   - The slope of the asymptote is ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ).   - The derivative of ( C_1 ) is ( frac{dy}{dx} = frac{x}{p} ).   - Setting ( frac{x}{p} = frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ) gives ( x = frac{p}{2sqrt{2}} ).2. Coordinates of ( M ):   - Substituting ( x = frac{p}{2sqrt{2}} ) into ( C_1 ) gives ( y = frac{1}{2p} left( frac{p}{2sqrt{2}} right)^2 = frac{p}{16} ).   - Thus, ( M ) is ( left( frac{p}{2sqrt{2}}, frac{p}{16} right) ).3. Equation of the line:   - The line through ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ) and ( (3, 0) ) has slope ( -frac{p}{6} ).   - Equation: ( y = -frac{p}{6}x + frac{p}{2} ).4. Substituting ( M ) into the line equation:   - Substituting ( left( frac{p}{2sqrt{2}}, frac{p}{16} right) ) into the line equation:     [     frac{p}{16} = -frac{p}{6} cdot frac{p}{2sqrt{2}} + frac{p}{2}     ]   - Simplifying:     [     frac{p}{16} = -frac{p^2}{12sqrt{2}} + frac{p}{2}     ]   - Multiplying through by ( 48sqrt{2} ):     [     -4p^2 + 24sqrt{2}p = 3sqrt{2}p     ]   - Solving:     [     -4p^2 + 21sqrt{2}p = 0 implies p = frac{21sqrt{2}}{4}     ]Thus, the value of ( p ) is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem involving a parabola and a hyperbola. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, let me parse the given information. The parabola is C₁: y = (1/(2p))x², where p &gt; 0. The hyperbola is C₂: x²/8 - y² = 1. The focus of the parabola is connected to the right focus of the hyperbola by a line, and this line intersects the parabola C₁ at a point M in the first quadrant. The tangent line to C₁ at point M is parallel to one of the asymptotes of C₂. I need to find the value of p from the given options.Alright, let&#39;s start by recalling some properties of parabolas and hyperbolas. For the parabola C₁: y = (1/(2p))x². The standard form of a parabola that opens upward is y = (1/(4f))x², where f is the focal length. Comparing this with the given equation, 1/(4f) = 1/(2p) ⇒ 4f = 2p ⇒ f = p/2. Therefore, the focus of the parabola C₁ is at (0, f) = (0, p/2).Next, for the hyperbola C₂: x²/8 - y² = 1. The standard form of a hyperbola opening horizontally is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1. So here, a² = 8 ⇒ a = 2√2, and b² = 1 ⇒ b = 1. The foci of a hyperbola are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². Therefore, c² = 8 + 1 = 9 ⇒ c = 3. So the foci of C₂ are at (±3, 0). The right focus is at (3, 0).So the problem states that the focus of the parabola (0, p/2) is connected to the right focus of the hyperbola (3, 0) by a line. This line intersects the parabola C₁ at a point M in the first quadrant. Then, the tangent to C₁ at M is parallel to an asymptote of C₂.So, first, I need to find the equation of the line connecting (0, p/2) and (3, 0). Then, find where this line intersects the parabola C₁ in the first quadrant (other than the focus, which is already on the parabola, but since the focus is (0, p/2), which is on the y-axis, so the other intersection point must be in the first quadrant). Then, compute the tangent line at that point M on C₁ and set its slope equal to the slope of the asymptote of C₂. Then solve for p.Let me verify. The line connecting (0, p/2) and (3, 0). The slope of this line would be (0 - p/2)/(3 - 0) = (-p/2)/3 = -p/6. So the equation of the line is y - p/2 = (-p/6)(x - 0) ⇒ y = (-p/6)x + p/2.This line intersects the parabola y = (1/(2p))x². So set (-p/6)x + p/2 = (1/(2p))x². Let&#39;s solve this equation for x.Multiply both sides by 2p to eliminate denominators:2p*(-p/6)x + 2p*(p/2) = x²Simplify:(- (2p * p)/6 )x + (2p * p)/2 = x²Which is (-p²/3)x + p² = x²Bring all terms to one side:x² + (p²/3)x - p² = 0Wait, that&#39;s x² + (p²/3)x - p² = 0. Let me check the algebra again.Original equation after multiplying by 2p:Left side: 2p * [ (-p/6)x + p/2 ] = 2p*(-p/6)x + 2p*(p/2) = (-p²/3)x + p²Right side: 2p*(1/(2p))x² = x²So, equation becomes (-p²/3)x + p² = x² ⇒ x² + (p²/3)x - p² = 0. Correct.So, solving quadratic equation x² + (p²/3)x - p² = 0 for x.Let me write this as x² + (p²/3)x - p² = 0.Using quadratic formula: x = [ -B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC) ]/(2A)Here, A = 1, B = p²/3, C = -p².So discriminant D = (p²/3)^2 - 4*1*(-p²) = p⁴/9 + 4p².Then, x = [ -p²/3 ± sqrt(p⁴/9 + 4p²) ] / 2Factor p² inside the square root:sqrt(p⁴/9 + 4p²) = sqrt( p²(p²/9 + 4) ) = p*sqrt( p²/9 + 4 )But let&#39;s compute it step by step:p⁴/9 + 4p² = (p⁴ + 36p²)/9 = p²(p² + 36)/9Therefore, sqrt(p²(p² + 36)/9) = (p/3)sqrt(p² + 36)Therefore, x = [ -p²/3 ± (p/3)sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 2Factor out p/3:x = (p/3)[ -p ± sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 2Wait, let me re-express:The numerator is -p²/3 ± (p/3)sqrt(p² + 36)Factor out p/3:= (p/3)[ -p ± sqrt(p² + 36) ]Therefore, x = (p/3)[ -p ± sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 2Wait, no. Wait, original quadratic formula gives numerator as -B ± sqrt(D):Which is -p²/3 ± (p/3)sqrt(p² + 36)Then divided by 2A, which is 2*1 = 2.Therefore:x = [ -p²/3 ± (p/3)sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 2= [ -p² ± p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6So, two solutions:x1 = [ -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6x2 = [ -p² - p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6Since we are looking for the intersection point in the first quadrant, x must be positive. Let&#39;s check the two solutions.For x1: numerator is -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36). Let&#39;s check if this is positive.Let me factor p:p[ -p + sqrt(p² + 36) ]Since sqrt(p² + 36) &gt; sqrt(p²) = p (as p &gt; 0). Therefore, -p + sqrt(p² + 36) is positive. Therefore, x1 is positive.x2: numerator is -p² - p sqrt(p² + 36), which is clearly negative. So x2 is negative. Therefore, the intersection point in the first quadrant is x1.Therefore, x-coordinate of point M is [ -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6.Now, let&#39;s compute the y-coordinate of point M. Since it&#39;s on the parabola C₁: y = (1/(2p))x².So y = (1/(2p)) * [ (-p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ) / 6 ]²But this might get complicated. Maybe we can use the equation of the line to find y as well. Since the point M is on both the line and the parabola.But perhaps we don&#39;t need to compute y explicitly yet. The key point is that the tangent to C₁ at M is parallel to an asymptote of C₂.First, let&#39;s find the asymptotes of the hyperbola C₂: x²/8 - y² = 1. The asymptotes of a hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1 are y = ±(b/a)x. So here, b = 1, a = 2√2. Therefore, the asymptotes are y = ±(1/(2√2))x. So their slopes are ±1/(2√2).Since the tangent line at M is parallel to one of these asymptotes, the slope of the tangent at M must be either 1/(2√2) or -1/(2√2). However, point M is in the first quadrant. Let&#39;s think about the slope of the tangent at M.The parabola y = (1/(2p))x² is opening upwards. The tangent line at a point in the first quadrant would have a positive slope. The asymptotes of the hyperbola have slopes ±1/(2√2). Since the tangent is parallel to one of them, and the tangent in the first quadrant has a positive slope, then the slope of the tangent must be 1/(2√2).Therefore, the derivative of the parabola at point M is 1/(2√2).Compute the derivative of C₁: y = (1/(2p))x². The derivative dy/dx = (1/(2p))*2x = x/p. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at point M is x/p. So x/p = 1/(2√2) ⇒ x = p/(2√2).So, at point M, the x-coordinate is x = p/(2√2). Let&#39;s use this to find the coordinates of M.Wait, but we already have another expression for x-coordinate of M from the intersection with the line. Let me recall:From the line intersection, x-coordinate of M is [ -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6.But from the slope condition, x = p/(2√2). Therefore, equate these two expressions:[ -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6 = p/(2√2)Multiply both sides by 6: -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) = 6 * p/(2√2) = (3p)/√2Bring -p² to the right side:p sqrt(p² + 36) = p² + (3p)/√2Divide both sides by p (since p &gt; 0):sqrt(p² + 36) = p + 3/√2Now, let&#39;s square both sides to eliminate the square root:p² + 36 = (p + 3/√2)^2Expand the right side:= p² + 2*p*(3/√2) + (3/√2)^2= p² + (6p)/√2 + 9/(2)Simplify terms:6/√2 = 3√2 (since 6/√2 = 6√2/2 = 3√2)So:p² + 36 = p² + 3√2 p + 9/2Subtract p² from both sides:36 = 3√2 p + 9/2Subtract 9/2 from both sides:36 - 9/2 = 3√2 pCompute 36 - 9/2:36 = 72/2, so 72/2 - 9/2 = 63/2Thus:63/2 = 3√2 pSolve for p:p = (63/2) / (3√2) = (63)/(6√2) = (21)/(2√2)Rationalize the denominator:21/(2√2) = (21√2)/(2*2) = (21√2)/4Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 21√2/4, and option C is 21√2/8. Wait, did I miscalculate?Wait:Wait, (63/2) divided by (3√2) is equal to (63/2) * (1/(3√2)) = (63)/(6√2) = (21)/(2√2). Then, rationalizing:21/(2√2) = 21√2/(2*2) = 21√2/4, yes. So that&#39;s 21√2/4, which is option D.But let&#39;s check if that&#39;s correct. Wait, but let me verify each step again because the answer is either C or D. But according to this, it&#39;s D. Let me check again.Wait, let&#39;s check squaring both sides:sqrt(p² + 36) = p + 3/√2Square both sides:p² + 36 = p² + 2*p*(3/√2) + (3/√2)^2Yes, that&#39;s p² + 36 = p² + (6p)/√2 + 9/2Simplify:36 = (6p)/√2 + 9/2Convert 6/√2 to 3√2:36 = 3√2 p + 4.5Then 36 - 4.5 = 3√2 p31.5 = 3√2 p31.5 is 63/2, so 63/2 = 3√2 pSo p = (63/2)/(3√2) = 21/(2√2) = 21√2/4. Yes, so that&#39;s 21√2/4, which is option D.But wait, the options given are:A: 7√2/16B: 7√2/8C:21√2/8D:21√2/4So D is 21√2/4, which is what we obtained. But the answer is supposed to be one of the options. Wait, but the original problem says &quot;the tangent line of C₁ at point M is parallel to one asymptote of C₂&quot;. The asymptotes have slopes ±1/(2√2). So the slope of the tangent is 1/(2√2). Then, we found x = p/(2√2). Then, equated the x-coordinate from the line intersection.Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in solving for x. Let me check again.Wait, the derivative of the parabola is dy/dx = x/p. So the slope is x/p = 1/(2√2) ⇒ x = p/(2√2). So that&#39;s correct.Then, substituting x into the equation of the line. Alternatively, since we found that x-coordinate of M is p/(2√2) from the slope condition, and from the line intersection, x is [ -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6. Therefore, equate these two expressions.So:p/(2√2) = [ -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6Multiply both sides by 6:6p/(2√2) = -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36)Simplify 6/(2√2) = 3/√2:3p/√2 = -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36)Bring all terms to one side:p sqrt(p² + 36) - p² - 3p/√2 = 0Factor out p:p[ sqrt(p² + 36) - p - 3/√2 ] = 0Since p &gt; 0, we have:sqrt(p² + 36) - p - 3/√2 = 0Which leads to sqrt(p² + 36) = p + 3/√2, which is the same equation as before. Then, squaring both sides gives the same result. So that seems correct. So according to this, p = 21√2/4, which is option D.But let me check if this is one of the options. Yes, option D is 21√2/4.Wait, but I might have messed up the squaring step. Let me verify:sqrt(p² + 36) = p + 3/√2Square both sides:p² + 36 = p² + 2*p*(3/√2) + (3/√2)^2Yes. So 2*p*(3/√2) = 6p/√2 = 3√2 pAnd (3/√2)^2 = 9/2So, p² + 36 = p² + 3√2 p + 9/2Subtract p²:36 = 3√2 p + 9/2Then, 36 - 9/2 = 3√2 p36 is 72/2, so 72/2 - 9/2 = 63/2Thus, 63/2 = 3√2 p ⇒ p = (63/2)/(3√2) = 21/(2√2) = 21√2 /4Yes, so that&#39;s correct.But let me check if maybe the problem states that the tangent is parallel to an asymptote, but perhaps I considered the wrong asymptote? The asymptotes are ±1/(2√2). Since the point M is in the first quadrant, the tangent line has a positive slope, so we take the positive asymptote slope 1/(2√2). That seems right.Alternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the quadratic solution earlier. Let me check:Original equation when intersecting the line and parabola:(-p/6)x + p/2 = (1/(2p))x²Multiply both sides by 2p:(-p²/3)x + p² = x²Bring all terms to left:x² + (p²/3)x - p² = 0So quadratic in x: x² + (p²/3)x - p² = 0. Correct.Using quadratic formula:x = [-B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC)]/(2A)Where A = 1, B = p²/3, C = -p²Discriminant D = (p²/3)^2 - 4*1*(-p²) = p^4/9 + 4p²Factor p²:= p²(p²/9 + 4) = p²( p² + 36 ) / 9So sqrt(D) = p sqrt(p² + 36)/3Therefore, solutions:x = [ -p²/3 ± p sqrt(p² + 36)/3 ] / 2= [ -p² ± p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6So positive solution is [ -p² + p sqrt(p² + 36) ] / 6. Correct.Therefore, that part is correct.Then, setting x = p/(2√2) equal to that expression, leading to the equation for p. Solved correctly, leading to p = 21√2/4. So answer D.But let me cross-verify with another approach.Alternatively, since we have the point M on the parabola with x-coordinate p/(2√2), substitute this into the equation of the line connecting (0, p/2) and (3, 0). Then, check if the coordinates satisfy the line equation.Point M has coordinates ( p/(2√2), y ). Since it&#39;s on the parabola, y = (1/(2p))( p/(2√2) )² = (1/(2p))( p² / (8*2) ) = (1/(2p))( p² / 16 ) = p/(32 ). Wait, is that correct?Wait, x = p/(2√2), so x² = p²/(8). Then, y = (1/(2p))*(p²/8) = p/(16). Wait, let me compute again:y = (1/(2p))x² = (1/(2p))*( p/(2√2) )² = (1/(2p))*( p² / (4*2) ) = (1/(2p))*( p² / 8 ) = p/(16). So y = p/16.So coordinates of M are ( p/(2√2), p/16 )Now, since M lies on the line connecting (0, p/2) and (3, 0), we can use the parametric equations of the line or check if the slope between (0, p/2) and M is the same as the slope between M and (3, 0). Alternatively, plug into the line equation.The line equation is y = (-p/6)x + p/2. Let&#39;s check if M satisfies this:y-coordinate of M is p/16. So:p/16 =? (-p/6)*( p/(2√2) ) + p/2Compute the right side:= (-p²)/(12√2) + p/2Set equal to p/16:p/16 = (-p²)/(12√2) + p/2Multiply both sides by 48√2 to eliminate denominators:48√2*(p/16) = 48√2*( -p²/(12√2) ) + 48√2*(p/2)Simplify:3√2 p = -4p² + 24√2 pBring all terms to left:4p² -24√2 p + 3√2 p = 0 ⇒ 4p² -21√2 p = 0 ⇒ p(4p -21√2 ) = 0Since p &gt; 0, then 4p -21√2 =0 ⇒ p=21√2 /4, which is the same result as before. So this confirms the answer is D:21√2 /4.Therefore, the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given the parabola ( C_1: y = frac{1}{2p}x^2 ) with focus at ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ) and the hyperbola ( C_2: frac{x^2}{8} - y^2 = 1 ) with right focus at ( (3, 0) ). The line connecting these foci intersects ( C_1 ) at point ( M ) in the first quadrant. The tangent line at ( M ) is parallel to an asymptote of ( C_2 ). We need to find ( p ).1. Equation of the Line Connecting Foci:   - The line connecting ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ) and ( (3, 0) ) has slope ( -frac{p}{6} ).   - Equation: ( y = -frac{p}{6}x + frac{p}{2} ).2. Intersection with Parabola:   - Solve ( -frac{p}{6}x + frac{p}{2} = frac{1}{2p}x^2 ).   - Multiply by ( 2p ): ( -frac{p^2}{3}x + p^2 = x^2 ).   - Quadratic equation: ( x^2 + frac{p^2}{3}x - p^2 = 0 ).3. Quadratic Solution:   - Solutions: ( x = frac{-p^2 pm psqrt{p^2 + 36}}{6} ).   - Positive solution: ( x = frac{-p^2 + psqrt{p^2 + 36}}{6} ).4. Tangent Line Slope:   - Asymptotes of ( C_2 ) have slopes ( pm frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ).   - Tangent slope at ( M ): ( frac{x}{p} = frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} Rightarrow x = frac{p}{2sqrt{2}} ).5. Equating Coordinates:   - Set ( frac{-p^2 + psqrt{p^2 + 36}}{6} = frac{p}{2sqrt{2}} ).   - Simplify: ( sqrt{p^2 + 36} = p + frac{3}{sqrt{2}} ).   - Square both sides: ( p^2 + 36 = p^2 + 3sqrt{2}p + frac{9}{2} ).   - Solve: ( 36 = 3sqrt{2}p + frac{9}{2} Rightarrow frac{63}{2} = 3sqrt{2}p Rightarrow p = frac{21sqrt{2}}{4} ).Thus, the value of ( p ) is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e644746d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e644746d><span class="icon" data-v-e644746d>🔑:</span>From the parabola C_1:y= frac{1}{2p}x^{2}(p &gt; 0), we obtain x^{2}=2py(p &gt; 0),so the coordinates of the focus of the parabola are F(0, frac{p}{2}).From C_2: frac{x^{2}}{8}-y^{2}=1, we get a=2 sqrt{2}, b=1, c=3.So, the coordinates of the right focus of the hyperbola are (3,0).The equation of the line connecting the focus of the parabola and the right focus of the hyperbola is frac{p}{2}x+3y- frac{3}{2}p=0quad①.Let this line intersect the parabola at M(x_0, frac{x_0^{2}}{2p}), then the slope of the tangent line of C_1 at point M is frac{x_0}{p}.According to the problem, we know that frac{x_0}{p}= frac{sqrt{2}}{4}, so x_0= frac{sqrt{2}}{4}p, and thus M( frac{sqrt{2}}{4}p, frac{p}{16}).Substituting M into ①, we get: frac{p}{2} times frac{sqrt{2}}{4}p+3 times frac{p}{16}-frac{3}{2}p=0.Solving for p, we obtain p= frac{21 sqrt{2}}{4}.Therefore, the answer is boxed{D}.This problem involves finding the equation of the line passing through the foci of a parabola and a hyperbola, calculating the derivative of a parabolic function at a certain point to determine the slope of the tangent line, and utilizing this slope to establish a relationship between the point&#39;s x-coordinate and p. Finally, substituting the coordinates of the point M into the line equation, we solve for p. This problem tests basic geometric properties of hyperbolas and utilizes derivatives to investigate the tangent line equation and the slope of a function at a certain point.

And I need to find the maximum size of such a set. Hmm, let me try to parse this step by step.First, let&#39;s restate the problem in my own words. We have an integer n ≥ 3. We need to consider a set S of permutations of the numbers 1 through n. The condition is that for any three distinct numbers from 1 to n, in every permutation in S, one of those three numbers is not between the other two. The question is asking for the maximum possible number of permutations in such a set S.Let me think about what this condition means. For any three numbers, say a, b, c, in every permutation p_i in S, when you look at where a, b, c are positioned in p_i, one of them is not sandwiched between the other two. So, for example, in the permutation (1, 3, 2, 4), if we take numbers 1, 3, 4, then 3 is between 1 and 4. But if we take 1, 2, 4, then 4 is not between 1 and 2. The condition requires that for every trio of numbers, in every permutation in the set, one of them is not between the others. So, for that trio, in each permutation, there&#39;s always an &quot;extremal&quot; element—either the smallest, middle, or largest in terms of position.Wait, but actually, the problem says &quot;among every three distinct numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}, one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So for every three numbers, in each permutation, one is not between the other two. So for each trio, in each permutation, their order must not be such that all three are in a linear order where all three are between each other. Hmm, but actually, in any permutation, given three numbers, they have a linear order. So for example, in permutation (1, 3, 2, 4), the trio 1, 3, 2 is ordered as 1, 3, 2, so 3 is between 1 and 2. But in the trio 1, 2, 4, in the permutation, 1, 3, 2, 4, the numbers 1, 2, 4 are ordered as 1, 2, 4, so none are between the others? Wait, no. Wait, 2 is between 1 and 4? But 1 comes first, then 3, then 2, then 4. So in the entire permutation, 2 is after 1 but before 4. Wait, but the actual positions: 1 is at position 1, 3 at 2, 2 at 3, 4 at 4. So in terms of numerical order, 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4, but the permutation is arranged as 1, 3, 2, 4. So for the trio 1, 2, 4: in the permutation, 1 is first, then 3, then 2, then 4. So in the permutation, the order of 1, 2, 4 is 1, 2, 4. So 2 is between 1 and 4 in terms of positions? Wait, but 1 is at position 1, 2 is at position 3, and 4 is at position 4. So in the permutation, the order of 1, 2, 4 is 1 comes before 2, which comes before 4. So 2 is between 1 and 4 in the permutation. So in this case, according to the problem statement, &quot;4 does not lie in between 1 and 2&quot;. Wait, maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding.Wait, the example says in the permutation (1, 3, 2, 4), &quot;3 lies in between 1 and 4&quot;, and &quot;4 does not lie in between 1 and 2&quot;. So maybe the idea is that for any three numbers, in the permutation, one of them is either the first or the last among the three in the permutation, so it&#39;s not between the other two. So for each trio, in each permutation, one of them is either the leftmost or the rightmost among the three in that permutation.So the problem&#39;s condition is that for every three numbers a, b, c, in every permutation in S, when you look at the order of a, b, c in the permutation, one of them is either the first or the last among the three, meaning it&#39;s not between the other two. So, in other words, for any three elements, in every permutation in the set, they cannot form an ordering where all three are &quot;between&quot; each other in some cyclic way. Wait, but in a permutation, the order is linear. So for any three elements, their relative order in the permutation is a linear order, so one of them is first, one is middle, and one is last. So in that case, the middle one is between the other two. So the problem&#39;s condition is that in every permutation in S, for every three numbers, one of them is not between the other two. Which would mean that for each trio, in each permutation, the trio must not have all three elements where each is between two others. But in reality, in a permutation, given three elements, exactly one is in the middle. So, the problem&#39;s condition is automatically satisfied? Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, no.Wait, let me think again. The problem says: &quot;among every three distinct numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}, one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So for each trio, in each permutation, one of the numbers is not between the other two. But in any permutation, given three numbers, there is always a middle one. So for each trio, in each permutation, the middle one is between the other two, and the other two are not between the other two. Wait, so for example, take numbers 1, 2, 3. In permutation (1, 2, 3, 4), the order is 1, 2, 3. So 2 is between 1 and 3, and 1 is not between 2 and 3, and 3 is not between 1 and 2. So in this case, two of the numbers are not between the others. So the problem&#39;s condition is satisfied because there exists at least one number not between the others. Wait, but the problem says &quot;one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers&quot;. So as long as in each trio, for each permutation, at least one of the three is not between the other two, which is always true because in any trio in a permutation, there is a first, middle, and last, so the first and last are not between the other two. So does that mean that every set S of permutations satisfies this condition? But that contradicts the problem statement, which is asking for the maximum m. So perhaps I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem.Wait, let me check the problem statement again: &quot;Suppose that among every three distinct numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}, one of these number does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So for every three numbers, in every permutation in S, one of the three numbers does not lie between the other two. So for example, take three numbers a, b, c. In permutation p_i, when you look at the positions of a, b, c, one of them is either the first or the last among the three, so not between the other two. Therefore, the problem is that for any three numbers, across all permutations in S, in each permutation, for that trio, one is not between the others. But how is this a restrictive condition? Because in any permutation, for any three numbers, two of them will be not between the others. So the condition is that in each permutation, for each trio, at least one is not between the others. But since this is always true, doesn&#39;t that mean that any set S satisfies the condition? But the problem is asking for the maximum m, which would then be n! But that&#39;s impossible because the example given in the problem is part of the problem statement. Wait, the problem gives an example: &quot;In the permutation (1, 3, 2, 4), 3 lies in between 1 and 4, and 4 does not lie in between 1 and 2&quot;. So maybe the problem is not that in each permutation, for each trio, one is not between the others, but that across all permutations in S, for each trio, there exists one number that is never between the other two in any permutation. Wait, the wording is ambiguous.Wait, let&#39;s look at the exact problem statement again: &quot;Suppose that among every three distinct numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}, one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So the phrase &quot;among every three distinct numbers... one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So, for every three distinct numbers, there exists one number (depending on the three) such that in every permutation p_i, that number does not lie between the other two. So it&#39;s not that for each permutation, in each trio, one is not between the others, but rather that for each trio, there is a fixed number such that in all permutations in S, that number is never between the other two. That&#39;s a different condition.Yes, that&#39;s probably the correct interpretation. So the problem is: For each trio of numbers, say a, b, c, there is one of them, say b, such that in every permutation in S, b is not between a and c. So for this trio, across all permutations in S, the middle element is never b. So for every three numbers, we fix one as the &quot;non-middle&quot; element, and in all permutations, that element is never in the middle of the other two. So in other words, for each trio, we have a designated &quot;non-middle&quot; element, and all permutations in S must respect that: whenever those three elements appear in a permutation, the designated one is either before both or after both.This is similar to the concept of &quot;2-rainbow&quot; or &quot;simple&quot; permutations, but I need to think more carefully. This seems related to the notion of a &quot;linear order&quot; and &quot;betweenness&quot;. So for each trio, we&#39;re enforcing that a particular element is not between the other two in any permutation in S. If we do that for all trios, then S is a set of permutations where for every trio, a particular element is extremal (either first or last) in that trio.But how can we construct such permutations? For example, if we fix a linear order on all elements, and take all permutations that are linear extensions of that order. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, suppose we fix a total order, say 1 &lt; 2 &lt; ... &lt; n. Then, in any permutation that is a linear extension, the order of the elements might not preserve the total order. Wait, no. Linear extensions are for partial orders. Maybe this is not the right approach.Alternatively, think about the concept of a &quot;betweenness&quot; relation. For each trio, we have a constraint that a particular element is not between the other two. So, for example, if for trio {a, b, c}, we decide that a is not between b and c in any permutation in S. That means that in every permutation in S, whenever b and c appear, a must either come before both or after both. So, in other words, a is either always to the left of both b and c or always to the right of both b and c. But this is only for the trio {a, b, c}. For another trio involving a, say {a, d, e}, a might have a different constraint.Wait, but if we need for every trio, such a constraint, then the permutations in S must satisfy all these betweenness constraints. But how can such permutations exist? It seems that these constraints might be conflicting. For example, suppose for trio {a, b, c}, we fix that a is not between b and c. Then, for another trio {a, b, d}, we fix that b is not between a and d. These constraints might require a to be before or after b and c, and b to be before or after a and d. Depending on the choices, these could be compatible or not.This seems like a problem related to permutation patterns or permutation constraints. Perhaps the maximum size of such a set S is 2^{n-1}, but I need to think.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of linear orders and choosing directions for each trio. For each trio, we fix an order where one element is not in the middle. This is similar to the concept of a &quot;tournament&quot;, where for each pair, you choose a direction. However, here it&#39;s for trios. But tournaments are for pairs. Maybe this is a hypergraph tournament?Wait, but in a tournament, for every pair, you have a direction. Here, for every trio, we have a choice of one element to exclude from the middle. This is more complex. Such a structure is called a &quot;betweenness&quot; structure. But I need to check if such a set of permutations can be constructed, and what&#39;s the maximum size.Alternatively, think recursively. Suppose for n=3. Then, the problem is: S is a set of permutations of {1,2,3}, such that for the only trio {1,2,3}, one number does not lie between the other two in every permutation. Let&#39;s say we fix that 2 is not between 1 and 3. Then, in every permutation in S, 2 must be either first or last among 1, 2, 3. So the permutations allowed would be those where 2 is first or last. For n=3, the total permutations are 6. The ones where 2 is first or last are: 213, 231, 123, 321, 132, 312. Wait, hold on: All permutations where 2 is first or last. Let&#39;s list all permutations of {1,2,3}:1. 123 – 2 is in the middle, which is between 1 and 3. So this is invalid.2. 132 – 3 is between 1 and 2. Wait, but our condition is that in every permutation, 2 is not between 1 and 3. Wait, but in permutation 132, 2 is last, so it&#39;s not between 1 and 3. So permutation 132 is allowed. Similarly, permutation 123 has 2 in the middle, so it&#39;s invalid. So the valid permutations are those where 2 is either first or last. So:- 213: 2 first- 231: 2 first- 132: 2 last- 312: 2 last- 321: 2 is in the middle (between 3 and 1). Wait, 321: the order is 3, 2, 1. So 2 is between 3 and 1. So 2 is in the middle, which violates the condition. Therefore, permutation 321 is invalid. Similarly, 123 is invalid. So the valid permutations are 213, 231, 132, 312. That&#39;s four permutations. So for n=3, m=4.But wait, in the problem statement, when n=3, the maximum m is 4? But let&#39;s check the condition. If we fix that for the trio {1,2,3}, 2 is not between the other two. So in every permutation in S, 2 must be first or last. The permutations where 2 is first are 213, 231. The permutations where 2 is last are 132, 312. So indeed four permutations. Then, in each of these permutations, 2 is not between 1 and 3. So the condition is satisfied. Therefore, for n=3, maximum m=4. Which is 2^{3-1}=4. Hmm, that&#39;s 2^{n-1}. For n=3, 2^{2}=4. For n=4, would it be 8?Wait, let&#39;s check n=4. Suppose we try to apply the same logic. Let&#39;s fix an order where for each trio, one element is always first or last. Wait, but with n=4, there are four elements, so the number of trios is C(4,3)=4. Each trio needs to have a designated non-middle element. But how to coordinate these designations across different trios?Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a way to structure all permutations so that each permutation is either increasing or decreasing with some modification. Wait, if we take all permutations where each element is either always increasing or always decreasing. But that might not work. Wait, for example, take the identity permutation and its reverse. Then, for any trio, in the identity permutation, the middle element is in the middle, and in the reversed permutation, the middle element is in the middle. So that doesn&#39;t help. But perhaps if we fix a particular element to be always first or last.Wait, for example, fix element 1 to be always first or last. Then, in all permutations of S, 1 is either first or last. How many such permutations are there? For n elements, the number of permutations where 1 is first or last is 2*(n-1)! So for n=3, that&#39;s 2*2=4, which matches our previous result. For n=4, that would be 2*6=12. But does this set satisfy the problem&#39;s condition? Let&#39;s check.Suppose S consists of all permutations where 1 is either first or last. Then, take any trio. If the trio includes 1, then in every permutation in S, 1 is either first or last among the three, so 1 is not between the other two. If the trio does not include 1, say trio {2,3,4}. Then, in permutations where 1 is first, the order of 2,3,4 can be arbitrary. Similarly, when 1 is last, the order of 2,3,4 can be arbitrary. Therefore, for the trio {2,3,4}, in some permutations, 3 could be between 2 and 4, which violates the condition if we need that for this trio, one of them is never in the middle. Wait, but according to the problem&#39;s condition, for each trio, there exists one element that is not between the other two in every permutation. So if we take S as all permutations with 1 first or last, then for trios that include 1, 1 is not between the other two. But for trios not including 1, like {2,3,4}, there is no designated element that is not between the others in all permutations. Because in some permutations in S, the order of 2,3,4 could be 2,3,4 (so 3 is between 2 and 4), or 4,3,2 (so 3 is between 4 and 2). Therefore, in these cases, 3 is in the middle. So for the trio {2,3,4}, there is no element that is excluded from being in the middle across all permutations. Hence, such a set S would not satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, just fixing one element to be first or last isn&#39;t sufficient unless n=3.So for n=3, fixing 2 to be first or last works because the only trio is {1,2,3}, and 2 is not in the middle. But for n=4, fixing 1 to be first or last doesn&#39;t handle the trios that don&#39;t include 1.Hmm. So maybe the solution is more involved. Let me think about known results. The problem resembles the concept of &quot;2-outer permutations&quot; or &quot;circular permutations&quot;, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, this might be related to the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, but that&#39;s about monotonic subsequences.Wait, another approach: the condition is that for every trio, there&#39;s a designated element that is never in the middle. So, if we can find such a set S where for every trio, we fix one element to be an &quot;extremal&quot; in that trio across all permutations in S. This is similar to forcing a particular ordering on each trio. If we can create a set S where each trio&#39;s order is constrained such that a specific element is always first or last, then S would satisfy the problem&#39;s condition.But how to coordinate these constraints across all trios? Because the constraints for different trios might interfere. For example, suppose for trio {a,b,c}, we fix that a is always first or last, and for trio {a,b,d}, we fix that b is always first or last. These constraints might conflict when considering permutations that involve both trios.Alternatively, if we can assign a linear order to all elements, and then take all permutations that are either consistent with this order or its reverse. Wait, let&#39;s think. Suppose we fix a linear order, say 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; ... &lt; n, and take all permutations that are either increasing or decreasing. Then, for any trio, in an increasing permutation, the order is a &lt; b &lt; c, so b is in the middle. In the decreasing permutation, the order is c &gt; b &gt; a, so b is still in the middle. So this doesn&#39;t help, because the middle element remains the same.Alternatively, if we take all permutations where each element is either less than all subsequent elements or greater than all subsequent elements. Wait, this is similar to the notion of a &quot;simple&quot; permutation, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.Wait, let&#39;s consider the set of all permutations where each element is either a left-to-right maximum or a right-to-left minimum. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, think of permutations that can be partitioned into two increasing subsequences. But I need to connect this to the problem&#39;s condition.Alternatively, consider the concept of a &quot;zigzag&quot; permutation, where elements alternate between rising and falling. But again, not sure.Wait, maybe this is a known structure in combinatorics called a &quot;2-dimensional&quot; permutation or something else. Wait, another thought: the problem&#39;s condition requires that for every trio, one element is never in the middle. This is equivalent to saying that the set S of permutations avoids the middle element for every trio. This is similar to the concept of a &quot;Venn permutation&quot; or &quot;shattering&quot; permutations.Alternatively, think of it as a hypergraph problem. Each trio is a hyperedge, and we need the permutations to shatter these hyperedges in a certain way. Wait, in hypergraph terms, a hypergraph is 2-colorable if there&#39;s a 2-coloring of the vertices such that no edge is monochromatic. Not exactly related. Alternatively, if we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem where each trio has a constraint that a particular element is not in the middle, then finding the maximum number of permutations satisfying all constraints.But perhaps there&#39;s a more straightforward approach. Let me try small cases.For n=3, as we saw, the maximum m is 4. For n=4, perhaps the maximum is 8? Let&#39;s see. If n=3, 2^{n-1}=4. For n=4, 2^{n-1}=8. Maybe the pattern is 2^{n-1}. Let&#39;s check.Suppose for n=4, we can fix two elements to be at the ends. For example, fix 1 and 4 to be first or last. Then, the permutations would be those where 1 is first or last and 4 is first or last. Wait, but the number of such permutations would be 2*2*(2!)=8. Let me see. For n=4, if we require that 1 is either first or last, and 4 is either first or last. Then, the positions of 1 and 4 are determined (they must be at the ends), and the remaining elements 2 and 3 can be in any order in the middle. So the permutations are:1 _ _ 4: with 2 and 3 in the middle. That&#39;s two permutations: 1 2 3 4 and 1 3 2 4.4 _ _ 1: similarly, 4 2 3 1 and 4 3 2 1.1 _ _ _ where 4 is last: 1 2 3 4, 1 3 2 4, but these are already counted. Wait, no. Wait, if we fix 1 to be first or last, and 4 to be first or last, there are four possibilities for the positions of 1 and 4:1 first, 4 last: 1 _ _ 4. Then, the middle two elements can be 2 and 3 in two ways.1 first, 4 first: Not possible unless 1 and 4 are the same, which they aren&#39;t.1 first, 4 somewhere else: But we fixed 4 to be first or last.Wait, actually, if we require that 1 is either first or last, and 4 is either first or last, then the possible combinations are:1 first and 4 last,1 last and 4 first,1 and 4 both first: impossible,1 and 4 both last: impossible.So only two possibilities: 1 first and 4 last, or 1 last and 4 first. Then, in each case, the remaining elements 2 and 3 can be arranged freely in the middle. So for 1 first and 4 last, we have two permutations: 1 2 3 4 and 1 3 2 4. For 1 last and 4 first, we have two permutations: 4 2 3 1 and 4 3 2 1. So total of four permutations. But wait, that&#39;s only four permutations. But 2^{n-1} for n=4 would be eight. So maybe this approach isn&#39;t correct.Alternatively, maybe we can fix for each element, a direction (left or right), and arrange the permutation accordingly. For example, if we decide that each element is either placed to the left or to the right of the remaining elements. But this is vague. Wait, let&#39;s think recursively.Suppose for n=1, m=1. For n=2, m=2. For n=3, m=4. For n=4, is m=8? If the pattern is m=2^{n-1}, then for each n, the maximum m is 2^{n-1}. Let me see if that makes sense.For n=3, 2^{2}=4 works. For n=4, if we have 8 permutations, does that satisfy the condition? Let&#39;s try to construct such a set. Suppose we take all permutations where the elements are either in increasing order or decreasing order, but with some flexibility. Wait, no. Alternatively, divide the set into two subsets: those where 1 is first and those where 1 is last. Then, recursively, within each subset, do the same for the remaining elements. Wait, this is similar to building a binary decision tree where at each step, you decide to place the next element at the front or the end. This construction would give 2^{n-1} permutations. Let me elaborate.Start with element 1. Place it either at the first position or the last position. Then, for each of these choices, take the next element, say 2, and place it either at the first available position or the last available position in the remaining slots. Continue this process. Each time you have a binary choice, leading to 2^{n-1} permutations. These are called &quot;linear extensions&quot; of a certain poset, perhaps, or &quot;2-stack sortable&quot; permutations. Wait, but this specific construction is known as the &quot;permutation tree&quot; with binary choices at each step.For example, for n=3:- Start with 1: place it first or last.If placed first: remaining elements 2,3. Place 2 first or last. If 2 is placed first: permutation 1,2,3. If 2 is placed last: permutation 1,3,2.If 1 is placed last: remaining elements 2,3. Place 2 first or last. If 2 is placed first: permutation 2,3,1. If 2 is placed last: permutation 3,2,1.Wait, but this gives four permutations: 123, 132, 231, 321. Wait, but in this set, for the trio {1,2,3}, in permutation 123, 2 is between 1 and 3. But according to our problem&#39;s condition, if we have designated that for trio {1,2,3}, 2 is not between the others, then permutation 123 would be invalid. Wait, but in our construction, we didn&#39;t fix any such designations. So maybe this approach doesn&#39;t satisfy the problem&#39;s condition.Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me clarify again. The problem states that for every three distinct numbers, one of them does not lie between the other two in every permutation in S. So, for each trio, there is a specific element that in all permutations in S, that element is not between the other two. So, for example, for trio {1,2,3}, we might fix that 2 is never between 1 and 3. Then, in all permutations in S, whenever 1 and 3 are present, 2 is either before both or after both. Similarly, for trio {1,2,4}, fix that 1 is never between 2 and 4, so in all permutations, 1 is either before both 2 and 4 or after both.But how can such permutations be constructed? If we fix such constraints for all trios, we need to ensure that these constraints are compatible. For instance, if for {1,2,3}, 2 cannot be between 1 and 3, and for {1,2,4}, 1 cannot be between 2 and 4, then these constraints might conflict when building a permutation that includes 1,2,3,4.This seems related to the concept of a &quot;tree&quot; structure, where the elements are arranged according to a hierarchical order. For example, if we have a binary tree and the permutations correspond to the in-order traversal with certain orientations. Alternatively, think of the permutations as being consistent with a particular tree&#39;s structure where each internal node corresponds to a trio and specifies an order.Alternatively, think of the problem as equivalent to having a linear order for all elements, such that for each trio, the order is either the same as the linear order or reversed. But in that case, the number of permutations would be two, which is too small. So this can&#39;t be.Wait, another idea: if the set S consists of all permutations that are either order-isomorphic to a given permutation or its reverse. But again, this gives only two permutations, which is too few.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum m is the number of linear extensions of a certain poset. If we can define a poset where for every trio {a,b,c}, one element is ordered before or after the other two, then the number of linear extensions would be the number of permutations in S.But defining such a poset is tricky because the constraints are on trios. For example, if for trio {a,b,c}, we have a ≺ b and a ≺ c (so a is before both b and c), then in the poset, a is below b and c. For another trio {a,b,d}, we might have d ≺ a and d ≺ b, so d is below a and b. This would create a poset where d is below a and b, and a is below b and c. But then, in the poset, d is below a, which is below b and c. This would imply that d is below b and c as well. But then, for trio {d, b, c}, we have d ≺ b and d ≺ c, so d is not between b and c. So this seems possible.However, constructing such a poset for all trios without introducing contradictions is challenging. For example, if for trio {a,b,c}, we set a before b and c, and for trio {a,b,d}, we set b before a and d, then this might create a cycle in the poset, which is invalid. Therefore, we need a way to assign order constraints for each trio such that they are all compatible.This seems related to the concept of a &quot;Betweenness&quot; problem, which is known to be NP-hard. But since the problem is asking for the maximum m, perhaps there&#39;s a combinatorial upper bound.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s model the problem as follows: For each trio {a,b,c}, we have to choose one element, say a, that is never between the other two. This can be represented as a constraint that in every permutation, a must be either before both b and c or after both b and c. If we can assign such constraints for all trios in a consistent way, then the set of permutations satisfying all constraints would be our set S.The question then becomes: What is the maximum number of permutations that satisfy all these betweenness constraints?This is equivalent to finding the number of linear extensions of a poset where, for each trio, one element is incomparable to the other two, but the other two are comparable. Wait, no. If for each trio {a,b,c}, a is constrained to be before or after both b and c, then in the poset, a must be either below both b and c or above both b and c. So the poset would be built such that for each trio, one element is either a common predecessor or a common successor of the other two.However, such a poset would require that for every trio, the chosen element is comparable to both of the others, but the other two are incomparable. Wait, but in a poset, if a is below b and c, then b and c can be incomparable. Similarly, if a is above b and c, then b and c can be incomparable. However, for other trios, we might have different constraints. For example, if in another trio {a,b,d}, we have d constrained to be below a and b, then d is below a and b, and since a is below b and c from the previous constraint, we get d below a below b and c. So this forms a chain.If we can build such a poset consistently, then the number of linear extensions would give the maximum m. However, the problem is that assigning these constraints for all trios might result in a poset that is a chain, which would have only 1 linear extension, which is too small.Alternatively, if the constraints can be assigned in such a way that the poset is an antichain with certain relations, allowing for multiple linear extensions. But this seems complex.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the problem&#39;s dual. If for every trio, one element cannot be in the middle, then each permutation in S must avoid having that element in the middle for every trio. This is similar to 3-uniform hypergraphs where each hyperedge (trio) has a specified forbidden position. The question is to find the maximum number of permutations that avoid all these forbidden patterns.But hypergraph enumeration is complicated. However, there might be a result in combinatorics that gives the maximum number of such permutations as 2^{n-1}. Let me see.Wait, in the paper &quot;Forbidden Three-Terminal Permutation Patterns&quot; by Michael Albert, maybe. But I don&#39;t have access to specific papers. Alternatively, recall that in the problem for n=3, the maximum is 4=2^{2}. For n=4, if the maximum is 8=2^{3}, then the pattern suggests 2^{n-1}. If this holds, then the answer is 2^{n-1}.Alternatively, think of each permutation as a linear order, and for each element except one, you decide whether it&#39;s to the left or right of the last element. Wait, but this might not directly apply.Wait, here&#39;s a construction that gives 2^{n-1} permutations. Fix a particular element, say element 1. For each of the other elements (2, 3, ..., n), decide whether to place them before or after element 1. Each such choice can be made independently, leading to 2^{n-1} permutations. However, in this case, element 1 is in a fixed position. Wait, no. If you decide for each element whether to place it before or after 1, then the total number of permutations is n! / (k!(n -k)!) summed over k from 0 to n, which is 2^{n}. But if we require that the relative order of elements 2, 3, ..., n is fixed. For example, suppose we fix the order of elements 2, 3, ..., n to be increasing. Then, for each element, we decide to place it before or after 1. This would give 2^{n-1} permutations, since for each of the n-1 elements, we choose left or right of 1. But in reality, when placing multiple elements before or after 1, their order has to be maintained as increasing. So the number of such permutations is indeed 2^{n-1}. For example, for n=3, fix the order of 2 and 3 as increasing. Then, permutations are:Place both before 1: 2, 3, 1Place 2 before 1 and 3 after 1: 2, 1, 3Place 3 before 1 and 2 after 1: 3, 1, 2Place both after 1: 1, 2, 3Wait, but this is four permutations, which matches 2^{3-1}=4. However, in these permutations, let&#39;s check the condition. For trio {1,2,3}:- In 231, 3 is between 2 and 1. But according to the problem&#39;s condition, we need that one of the numbers does not lie between the other two in every permutation. If we designated 1 as the non-middle element, then in all permutations, 1 is either first or last, which it is. So in this construction, 1 is never between the other two in any trio that includes 1. However, for trios that don&#39;t include 1, like {2,3,4} in n=4, this construction doesn&#39;t control their order. So for example, in the permutations where we place 4 before or after 1, the order of 2,3,4 could have 4 in the middle. Hence, violating the problem&#39;s condition.Therefore, this construction works only if all trios include the fixed element 1. But for n ≥4, there are trios not including 1, so the problem&#39;s condition isn&#39;t satisfied. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work for n ≥4.Hmm. So maybe another approach is needed. Let me consider the following: For each element, assign it to be either a &quot;left&quot; element or a &quot;right&quot; element. Then, in the permutation, all left elements are to the left of all right elements. The order within the left and right elements can be arbitrary. This would give 2^{n} permutations, but actually, the number of such permutations is the number of compositions of n elements into two parts, which is 2^{n} - 2. But this is more than 2^{n-1}. However, this doesn&#39;t satisfy the problem&#39;s condition either, because within the left or right groups, trios can have elements in the middle.Wait, but if we fix the order within the left and right groups. For example, if all left elements are increasing and all right elements are decreasing. Then, the total number of such permutations would be C(n, k) for each k, summed over k from 0 to n, which is 2^n. But again, this doesn&#39;t solve the problem&#39;s condition.Alternatively, consider the set of all permutations where each element is either a left-to-right maximum or a right-to-left minimum. This is a specific set of permutations studied in combinatorics, and their number is known to be 2^{n-1}. For example, for n=3, they are 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321. Wait, but this is 6 permutations, which is more than 2^{n-1}=4. Hmm, maybe not.Wait, another idea: if we think of the permutations as being sorted in a way where each element is inserted either at the front or the back of the current permutation. For example, starting with 1, then inserting 2 either before or after 1, resulting in 21 or 12. Then inserting 3 either at the front or the back of those, resulting in 321, 231, 213, 123. Continuing this way, each insertion step has two choices, leading to 2^{n-1} permutations. These are called &quot;linear permutations&quot; by some authors. Let me check if this set satisfies the problem&#39;s condition.Take n=3, the permutations are 123, 213, 231, 321. Let&#39;s verify the condition. For the trio {1,2,3}:- In 123: 2 is between 1 and 3. But in this construction, we have designated that each new element is inserted at front or back. So for 3, when inserted into 12, it was placed at the front or back. Wait, no. Wait, if we start with 1, then insert 2 before or after, resulting in 21 or 12. Then insert 3 before or after each of those:- Insert 3 before 21: 321- Insert 3 after 21: 213- Insert 3 before 12: 312- Insert 3 after 12: 123So actually, for n=3, this gives four permutations: 321, 213, 312, 123. Let&#39;s check the trio {1,2,3} in each:- 321: 2 is between 3 and 1. So 2 is in the middle. But in the problem&#39;s condition, we need that for each trio, one element is not between the others in every permutation. If we set, for example, 3 to be first or last, then in permutation 321, 3 is first. In permutation 312, 3 is first. In permutation 213, 3 is last. In permutation 123, 3 is last. So in all these permutations, 3 is either first or last. Therefore, for the trio {1,2,3}, 3 is never between the other two. Similarly, for other trios.Wait, let&#39;s check another trio, say {1,3,2} in permutation 213. The order is 2, 1, 3. So in this permutation, the trio {1,2,3} is ordered as 2, 1, 3. So 1 is between 2 and 3. But according to the previous logic, we fixed 3 to be last. So in this case, for trio {1,2,3}, 3 is last, so not between 1 and 2. But in permutation 213, the order of 1,2,3 is 2,1,3. So here, 1 is between 2 and 3. But according to the problem&#39;s condition, for the trio {1,2,3}, we need that one element is not between the others in every permutation. If we fixed 3 as not between the others, then in all permutations, 3 is not between 1 and 2, which is true. In permutation 213, 3 is last, so not between 1 and 2. Similarly, in permutation 312, 3 is first, so not between 1 and 2. In permutation 321, 3 is first. In permutation 123, 3 is last. So yes, for trio {1,2,3}, 3 is never between the other two.Now, check another trio, say {1,2,4} in n=4. Suppose we follow the same insertion method. Each time inserting the next element at front or back. Then, for example, starting with 1, insert 2 before or after, then insert 3 before or after, then insert 4 before or after. The resulting permutations would have 4 either at the front or the back. So for each trio involving 4, 4 is either first or last, hence not between the others. For trios not involving 4, like {1,2,3}, the same applies: 3 is either first or last among them. Wait, but in the permutations built by inserting each element at front or back, the relative order of the existing elements is maintained. So, for example, inserting 3 before 21 gives 321, and inserting 3 after 21 gives 213. In 321, the order of 2 and 1 is reversed compared to 213. Wait, no. Wait, inserting 3 before 21 gives 321, where 3 is first, then 2, then 1. Inserting 3 after 21 gives 213, which is 2, 1, 3. So in this case, the existing elements 2 and 1 are in reverse order in the two permutations.But the key is that in each step, when inserting a new element, the relative order of the previous elements is preserved. So if you have a permutation like 21, inserting 3 before gives 321, inserting 3 after gives 213. The relative order of 2 and 1 is preserved in both cases. Similarly, if you start with 12, inserting 3 before gives 312, inserting 3 after gives 123. So in all cases, the existing elements&#39; order is preserved when inserting a new element. Therefore, the set of permutations constructed this way are exactly the 2^{n-1} permutations where each element is inserted either at the front or the back, maintaining the relative order of the existing elements. This set is known to be the set of &quot;permutation with all left-to-right maxima or right-to-left minima&quot;, or something similar.But does this set satisfy the problem&#39;s condition? Let&#39;s check for n=4. Take a trio {2,3,4}. In all permutations constructed by inserting 4 at the front or the back:- If 4 is inserted at the front, then 4 is first, and the order of 2 and 3 depends on their insertion history. For example, if 2 was inserted before 3, then 2 comes before 3. If 3 was inserted before 2, then 3 comes before 2. So permutations could be 4,3,2,1 or 4,2,3,1 etc. Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s take a specific example. Suppose we start with 1, insert 2 before 1 (permutation 21), then insert 3 before 21 (permutation 321), then insert 4 before 321 (permutation 4321) or after 321 (permutation 3214). Similarly, if during each step we choose to insert at front or back.In permutation 4321, the trio {2,3,4} is ordered as 4,3,2. So 3 is between 4 and 2, and 2 is between 3 and 1. But according to the problem&#39;s condition, for trio {2,3,4}, there should be one element that is not between the others in every permutation. Let&#39;s check if such an element exists. In permutation 4321, 4 is first, 3 is second, 2 is third, so 3 is between 4 and 2. In permutation 3214, the trio {2,3,4} is ordered as 3,2,1,4. So in the entire permutation, 3 is first, then 2, then 1, then 4. So in the trio {2,3,4}, the order is 3,2,4. Therefore, 2 is between 3 and 4. So in this permutation, 2 is between 3 and 4. In another permutation like 2341, which would be constructed by inserting 2 after 1, then 3 after 2, then 4 after 3, giving 1,2,3,4. In this case, the trio {2,3,4} is ordered as 2,3,4, so 3 is between 2 and 4.Therefore, in these permutations, the trio {2,3,4} can have different elements in the middle, depending on the permutation. Hence, there is no single element that is never in the middle for this trio across all permutations. Therefore, the construction does not satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. So this approach also fails.Hmm, this is frustrating. Let&#39;s try another angle. The problem&#39;s condition requires that for every trio, across all permutations in S, one element is never in the middle. This is a global condition on the set S. So for each trio, we must choose an element that is extremal (first or last) in every permutation for that trio.This is similar to the concept of &quot;circular permutations&quot; where each permutation is a rotation of a circle, but I don&#39;t see the connection.Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of graph theory. If we model each permutation as a linear arrangement, and the constraints as hyperedges requiring that one vertex is not between the other two. Then, the problem is to find the maximum number of edges (permutations) such that each hyperedge (trio) is &quot;covered&quot; by having one vertex not in the middle in all edges (permutations).But hypergraph coverage is complex, and I don&#39;t know the exact term for this kind of coverage.Alternatively, consider that for each trio, we have a constraint that removes half of the permutations (those where the designated element is in the middle). If we have m constraints, each removing half the permutations, then the maximum m would be on the order of n! / 2^{C(n,3)}}. But this is likely an overcount, and the actual number is much higher.Wait, but the constraints are not independent. For example, fixing that in trio {a,b,c}, a is not in the middle affects the possible permutations, and fixing another trio {a,b,d} that b is not in the middle adds another constraint. These constraints can overlap and interact, making it difficult to compute the exact number.Perhaps the key is to recognize that this problem is analogous to the problem of arranging the permutations so that they avoid certain 3-patterns. Specifically, for each trio, we avoid the pattern where the designated element is in the middle. If we can show that the maximum number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}, then that would be the answer.Alternatively, recall that in the example given in the problem, the answer for n=3 is 4=2^{2}. For n=4, following the pattern, it would be 8=2^{3}. Therefore, the maximum m is 2^{n-1}.But how to prove this? Let&#39;s attempt an inductive argument.Base case: n=3, m=4=2^{2}. Holds.Inductive step: Assume that for n=k, the maximum m is 2^{k-1}. Now, for n=k+1, we need to show that m=2^{k}.To do this, consider adding a new element, say k+1, to the permutations of size k. If we can double the number of permutations by inserting k+1 either at the beginning or the end of each existing permutation, then we would get 2*2^{k-1}=2^{k} permutations. Moreover, this insertion would maintain the condition that for every trio involving k+1, k+1 is either first or last, hence not between the other two. For trios not involving k+1, the existing permutations already satisfy the condition due to the inductive hypothesis.Wait, but in the existing permutations for n=k, the condition is that for every trio, one element is not between the others. When we add the new element k+1 and insert it at the beginning or end, the existing trios not involving k+1 are still handled by the inductive hypothesis. The new trios involving k+1 and two other elements require that one element is not between the others in all permutations. If we choose k+1 as the non-middle element for all trios involving it, then since k+1 is always inserted at the beginning or end, it will never be between the other two elements in any trio that includes it. Therefore, this construction works.Therefore, by induction, the maximum m is 2^{n-1}.To verify this, let&#39;s check n=4. According to the inductive step, starting with n=3 permutations (4 permutations), then inserting 4 at the beginning or end of each, resulting in 8 permutations. Let&#39;s check if these permutations satisfy the problem&#39;s condition.Take a permutation from n=3, say 213. Inserting 4 at the beginning gives 4213, and at the end gives 2134. In 4213, the trio {2,1,4} has 4 at the beginning, so not between 2 and 1. The trio {2,1,3} has 3 at the end, so not between 2 and 1 (in permutation 4213, the order is 4,2,1,3. So for trio {2,1,3}, the order is 2,1,3, so 1 is between 2 and 3. But according to the inductive hypothesis, for trio {2,1,3}, one element is not between the others in all permutations. If in the n=3 case, we had fixed 3 as the non-middle element, then in permutation 213, 3 is last, so not between 2 and 1. Similarly, in permutation 2134, 3 is still last among 2,1,3. So in the extended permutation 2134, 3 is last, hence not between 2 and 1. Similarly, in permutation 4213, the trio {2,1,3} is ordered as 2,1,3, so 1 is between 2 and 3. Wait, this violates the condition. Unless in the n=3 case, the non-middle element for {2,1,3} is 1. Wait, no. The problem states that for every trio, there exists one element that is not between the others in every permutation. In the inductive step, when we construct permutations for n=4 by adding 4 at the ends, we preserve the conditions for the existing trios. However, in the example above, for the trio {2,1,3}, if in the original set S for n=3, the non-middle element was 3, then in all permutations of S, 3 is not between 2 and 1. But in permutation 213, 3 is last, so not between 2 and 1. In permutation 2134, 3 is still last. In permutation 4213, 3 is last among 2,1,3 (since 4 is first). Therefore, in all these permutations, 3 is not between 2 and 1, satisfying the condition. Therefore, even though 1 is between 2 and 3 in the permutation 4213, the condition is still satisfied because 3 is not between 2 and 1. Wait, but the problem&#39;s condition requires that in each permutation, for every trio, one element is not between the other two. So for the trio {2,1,3} in permutation 4213, the elements are ordered as 2,1,3. So 1 is between 2 and 3. However, according to our inductive hypothesis, the non-middle element for this trio is 3. In permutation 4213, 3 is not between 2 and 1 because 3 is after both 2 and 1. Wait, but in the entire permutation, 3 is at position 4, so in the trio {2,1,3}, their positions are 2 at position 2, 1 at position 3, and 3 at position 4. Therefore, in the order within the permutation, it&#39;s 2, 1, 3. So 1 is between 2 and 3. But the designated non-middle element is 3, which is not between 2 and 1. So in the trio {2,1,3}, the condition is satisfied because 3 is not between 2 and 1. Wait, but the trio is {2,1,3}, and the designated non-middle element is 3. Therefore, in every permutation, 3 is not between 2 and 1. In permutation 4213, 3 is after both 2 and 1, so it&#39;s not between them. Similarly, in permutation 2134, 3 is after both 2 and 1. Therefore, the condition is satisfied. The fact that 1 is between 2 and 3 in the entire permutation is irrelevant because the condition only requires that for the trio {2,1,3}, one element (3) is not between the other two (2 and 1). It doesn&#39;t care about the ordering of the trio in the rest of the permutation.Therefore, this construction works. By induction, we can keep doubling the number of permutations by adding the new element at the beginning or the end, ensuring that for all trios involving the new element, it&#39;s never in the middle, and for existing trios, the previous conditions still hold.Therefore, the maximum value of m is 2^{n-1}.Final AnswerThe maximum value of ( m ) is boxed{2^{n-1}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum value of ( m ) for a set ( S ) of permutations of ( (1, 2, ldots, n) ) such that among every three distinct numbers, one does not lie between the other two in every permutation, we need to consider the following reasoning:1. Problem Interpretation: For every three distinct numbers ( {a, b, c} ), there must be one number that is not between the other two in any permutation in ( S ). This means that for each trio, one element is either always first or last in the permutations of ( S ).2. Base Case: For ( n = 3 ), the maximum number of permutations is 4. This is achieved by fixing one element (say 2) to be either first or last in all permutations, leading to the permutations 213, 231, 132, and 312.3. Inductive Step: Assume for ( n = k ), the maximum number of permutations is ( 2^{k-1} ). For ( n = k + 1 ), we can add the new element ( k + 1 ) to the permutations of size ( k ) by inserting it either at the beginning or the end. This doubles the number of permutations, resulting in ( 2 times 2^{k-1} = 2^k ) permutations. This ensures that the new element ( k + 1 ) is never between any two other elements in any trio involving it, and the existing trios continue to satisfy the condition by the inductive hypothesis.4. Verification: By induction, this construction works for all ( n geq 3 ). Each new element is inserted at the beginning or end, maintaining the condition for all trios. This results in the maximum number of permutations being ( 2^{n-1} ).Thus, the maximum value of ( m ) is (boxed{2^{n-1}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum number of permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n} such that for every three distinct numbers, in every permutation, one of the three doesn&#39;t lie between the other two. Hmm, that&#39;s a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.First, let me rephrase the condition. For any three numbers a, b, c in {1, 2, ..., n}, in every permutation p_i in the set S, one of a, b, c is not between the other two. So, in other words, for any three numbers, in every permutation, they cannot form a sequence where all three are in a linear order such that the middle one is between the other two. Wait, no. The problem says that among every three distinct numbers, one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two in every permutation. So for each permutation and each trio, at least one of the three numbers is not between the other two. That is, in any permutation, for any three numbers, they can&#39;t be arranged in such a way that all three are &quot;between&quot; each other. So in any trio, in every permutation, one is at the start or the end, not in the middle.Wait, but in any permutation of three elements, there&#39;s always a middle element. So does that mean that the condition is that for each trio {a, b, c}, across all permutations in S, each element of the trio must be the &quot;non-between&quot; one in at least one permutation? Or is it that for each trio {a, b, c}, in every permutation in S, one of them is not between the other two. So in other words, in each permutation, for every trio, you can&#39;t have all three elements arranged so that each is between the other two. But in a single permutation, when you look at a trio, one of them is in the middle. So in each permutation, for each trio, the middle element is between the other two. But the problem states that in every permutation, for every trio, one of them does not lie between the other two. So perhaps in a permutation, for a trio, the two endpoints don&#39;t lie between the others. Wait, but in a permutation, if you have three elements, they are ordered, so one is first, one is middle, one is last. The first is not between the other two, the last is not between the other two, but the middle is between the other two.So, for each trio, in each permutation, exactly one element is between the other two, and the other two are not between the others. Therefore, in every permutation, for every trio, there is one element that is between the other two, which violates the problem&#39;s condition unless... Wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So for every permutation, for every trio, there exists at least one number in the trio that does not lie between the other two. But in a permutation, any trio will have one number in the middle (i.e., between the other two) and two numbers not between the other two. So actually, in any permutation, for any trio, two of them are not between the other two. So the condition is automatically satisfied? That can&#39;t be, because the problem is asking for a maximum m, which depends on n.Wait, maybe I misinterpret the problem. Let me read again.&quot;Suppose that among every three distinct numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}, one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i (1 ≤ i ≤ m).&quot;Wait, maybe the condition is that for every trio {a, b, c}, in every permutation p_i, one of a, b, c is not between the other two. So for example, in the trio {1, 2, 3}, in permutation (1, 3, 2, 4), 3 is between 1 and 2? No, in permutation (1, 3, 2, 4), the order of 1, 3, 2 is 1, 3, 2. So 3 is between 1 and 2? Wait, if you have 1 first, then 3, then 2, then 3 is between 1 and 2. But 2 is not between 1 and 3, because 2 is after 3. Similarly, 1 is not between 3 and 2. So in this permutation, for the trio {1, 2, 3}, the number 3 is between 1 and 2, but 1 is not between 3 and 2, and 2 is not between 1 and 3. Wait, but the problem states that &quot;one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So for each trio, in every permutation, at least one of the numbers is not between the other two. But as I just saw, in any trio in any permutation, two of the numbers are not between the other two. So the condition is always satisfied. That can&#39;t be. Then the problem would have m being all permutations, but the answer is not that. So there must be a misinterpretation.Wait, maybe the problem is that for each trio {a, b, c}, there exists one number among them that does not lie between the other two in every permutation p_i. So for example, for the trio {a, b, c}, there exists a particular number, say a, such that in every permutation p_i in S, a is not between b and c. So regardless of the permutation, whenever a, b, c appear, a is either first or last among them. So in other words, for each trio, we fix a linear order where one element is always at the ends in every permutation. That would make sense. Then, the set S consists of permutations where for every trio, one specific element is not between the other two. But how does that work?Wait, the problem says: &quot;among every three distinct numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}, one of these number does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i (1 ≤ i ≤ m)&quot;. So for each three numbers, there exists one number (depending on the three, perhaps) that in all permutations in S, this number is not between the other two. So for example, if we have trio {a, b, c}, then in every permutation in S, a is never between b and c. So in all permutations in S, whenever a, b, c appear, a is either before both b and c or after both b and c. Similarly, maybe for another trio {d, e, f}, it&#39;s e that is never between d and f in any permutation in S.So the problem is to find the maximum size m of a set S of permutations where for every 3-element subset of {1, 2, ..., n}, there is a designated element that is always not between the other two in all permutations of S. So each trio has a designated &quot;extreme&quot; element (either always first or always last among the trio) in all permutations in S.This seems similar to the concept of &quot;2-friendly&quot; permutations or some kind of ordering constraints. Maybe this relates to the notion of a &quot;simple&quot; permutation class or some structure where triples are ordered consistently.If that&#39;s the case, then the problem is equivalent to finding a set of permutations that avoid having a particular element in the middle for every trio. So for each trio, we choose an element that cannot be the middle one in any permutation in S.This seems similar to the concept of a &quot;linear order&quot; being imposed on the set, but since we are dealing with multiple permutations, perhaps each permutation must be consistent with some kind of tree structure or other hierarchical ordering.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s similar to the problem of covering all possible triples with orders where one element is fixed as the maximum or minimum. If we can model this as a graph where each permutation corresponds to a linear extension of some poset, but I need to think more carefully.Let me consider small n. For n=3, the problem is to find the maximum m such that in each permutation in S, for the only trio {1,2,3}, one of the numbers is not between the other two. But in any permutation of {1,2,3}, one number is in the middle. So if the condition is that in every permutation, the middle number is excluded for this trio, but since the trio is the entire permutation, you can&#39;t have a permutation where one number is not in the middle. Wait, n=3, the permutations are all 6 permutations. But the condition is that in every permutation in S, for the trio {1,2,3}, one number does not lie between the other two. But in any permutation, two numbers are at the ends, and one is in the middle. So the two endpoints are not between the other two, and the middle one is. So for each permutation, two numbers are not between the other two. But the problem states that &quot;one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So perhaps for the trio {1,2,3}, across all permutations in S, for each of the three numbers, there is at least one permutation where it is not between the other two. But the problem says &quot;in every permutations p_i&quot;, so maybe for each trio {a,b,c}, there exists a fixed element x in {a,b,c} such that in every permutation p_i, x is not between the other two. So for example, if x is designated as the one not between the others, then in every permutation in S, x is either first or last among a, b, c.Therefore, for each trio, we have to fix one element as the &quot;extremal&quot; one (either always first or always last in the trio in all permutations of S). So this is equivalent to, for each trio, choosing a linear order on the trio where one element is fixed as the maximum or minimum, and then S consists of permutations that are consistent with all these trio orders.This is similar to the concept of a &quot;tree&quot; permutation, where the permutations are consistent with a tree&#39;s structure. If we can model the elements as being in a binary tree, and each permutation is a traversal that respects the tree structure (like in a BST, where in-order traversal preserves the order), but here we need consistency across all trios.Alternatively, if for each trio, we fix a linear order, then the set S must be the set of linear extensions of the poset formed by these trio constraints. However, the maximum number of linear extensions would then be the size of S. But I don&#39;t know much about that.Alternatively, maybe this is equivalent to the permutations being all the linear extensions of a semi-order or interval order. Hmm.Alternatively, think of each element as having a fixed direction. For example, if we arrange all elements in a line, and the permutations are either all the reversed or the same. But that would only give two permutations, which is likely too small.Wait, but for n=3, if we fix, say, that in every permutation, 1 is always first or last among any trio. Wait, but for the trio {1,2,3}, we need 1 to be first or last. Similarly, for trio {1,2,4}, 1 must be first or last, etc. So if we fix 1 to be the first element in all permutations, then in every trio involving 1, 1 is first, so not between the others. For trios not involving 1, we have to fix another element. Wait, but if we fix 1 as the first element, then for the trio {2,3,4}, we need to fix one of 2,3,4 as not between the others in all permutations. But if 1 is fixed first, the remaining elements can be in any order, but for the trio {2,3,4}, in each permutation, one of 2,3,4 must be first or last among them. However, if the permutations after 1 can be arbitrary, then in some permutations, 2 could be between 3 and 4, which violates the condition unless we have fixed another element.Wait, this seems complex. Maybe the maximum m is 2^{n-1}. Because if we fix a linear order, say, from left to right, and then for each position, decide to put the next element to the left or right, building up a permutation in a way that maintains a consistent order. Wait, like a linear extension of a series-parallel poset?Alternatively, think of it as constructing permutations where each element is either added to the beginning or the end of the current permutation. For example, starting with 1, then adding 2 either before or after 1, resulting in (2,1) or (1,2). Then adding 3 either at the beginning or end of those, resulting in four permutations: (3,2,1), (2,3,1), (2,1,3), (1,2,3). Continuing this way, each time adding the next element at either end. This process creates 2^{n-1} permutations. Let me check if these permutations satisfy the given condition.Take n=3. The permutations would be (3,2,1), (2,3,1), (2,1,3), (1,2,3). Let&#39;s check the trio {1,2,3}:In (3,2,1), the order is 3,2,1. For trio {1,2,3}, the middle element is 2. But according to the problem&#39;s condition, one of the numbers does not lie between the other two. Wait, in any case, in every permutation, two numbers are at the ends and one is in the middle. But the problem states that for each trio, in every permutation, one number is not between the others. Which is always true. So, actually, does this construction work? Wait, no. Wait, the problem requires that for every three numbers, in every permutation, one of them is not between the other two. Which is always true, as in any permutation, for any three numbers, two are at the ends and one is in the middle. So the two ends are not between the other two. Wait, but the problem says &quot;one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So for each trio, in each permutation, at least one is not between the other two. Which is automatically satisfied. But in that case, all permutations would satisfy the condition, so m would be n! which is not possible because the answer is supposed to be something like 2^{n-1} based on common problems of this type.Wait, perhaps I&#39;m still misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the original problem statement again.&quot;Suppose that among every three distinct numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}, one of these number does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i (1 ≤ i ≤ m).&quot;Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted in two ways:1. For every three distinct numbers, there exists one number (depending on the three) such that in every permutation p_i, this number does not lie between the other two.2. For every three distinct numbers and for every permutation p_i, there exists one number (depending on the three and the permutation) that does not lie between the other two.If it&#39;s the first interpretation, then for each trio, we need to fix a particular number that is never between the other two in any permutation in S. If it&#39;s the second interpretation, then in each permutation, for each trio, at least one number is not between the other two, which is always true as discussed earlier, so m could be n!.But since the problem is asking to determine the maximum m, it&#39;s likely the first interpretation, because the second interpretation would make the answer n! which is trivial. So we must go with the first interpretation: For every three distinct numbers, there is one number that in all permutations of S does not lie between the other two. So for example, for the trio {a, b, c}, we fix that in all permutations of S, a is never between b and c. Then, for another trio {a, b, d}, maybe fix that d is never between a and b, and so on. The challenge is to assign for each trio an element that is never between the other two in all permutations of S. Then, the set S is the set of all permutations that satisfy all these constraints for every trio.This is similar to the problem of avoiding certain patterns. Specifically, for each trio, avoiding the pattern where the designated element is in the middle. So, for trio {a, b, c} with designated element a, we are avoiding the patterns b-a-c and c-a-b. Similarly, for another trio {a, b, d} with designated element d, we avoid a-d-b and b-d-a.The question then becomes: What&#39;s the maximum number of permutations we can have such that for every trio, a specific middle element is avoided. This seems related to the concept of permutation classes or permutation avoidance, but generalized to multiple avoidances.This problem might be connected to the concept of &quot;2-dimensional&quot; permutations or permutations that can be drawn as X-monotonic curves, which have applications in permutation graphs. Alternatively, this could relate to the number of linear extensions of a poset where each trio has a specified order.Alternatively, think about it as each element has a linear order relative to every other element. If we can arrange the elements such that for any two elements, their relative order is consistent across all permutations. But since we have multiple permutations, that might not hold.Wait, but if we fix, for each trio, one element to be always either first or last, perhaps this enforces a global order. For example, suppose we decide that for every trio, the smallest element is always first. Then, all permutations would have to be orderings where 1 is first, 2 is second, etc. But that&#39;s only one permutation. Similarly, if we fix for every trio that the largest element is last, then all permutations must end with n. But again, that restricts to a subset of permutations, but not sure how large.Alternatively, maybe this is equivalent to the set of permutations obtained by starting with a particular order and reversing certain segments. But this is vague.Alternatively, perhaps this problem is equivalent to finding the size of the largest antichain in the permutation lattice with certain restrictions. But antichains are sets of permutations where none contain another as a pattern, which might not be directly related.Wait, another angle: if for each trio {a, b, c}, we fix that a specific element is not between the others, then all permutations in S must have that element either before both or after both. So, for example, for trio {a, b, c}, if a is never between b and c, then in every permutation, a must be either before both b and c or after both b and c. Similarly for other trios.This is similar to enforcing that for each such trio, a is comparable to both b and c in a poset where a is either above or below both. Then, the permutations in S would be the linear extensions of this poset. The maximum number of linear extensions would then correspond to the number of permutations in S.However, the poset would have constraints for every trio, which might result in a series-parallel poset. If the poset is a linear order, then the number of linear extensions is 1. If it&#39;s an antichain, then it&#39;s n!. But here, it&#39;s somewhere in between.Alternatively, if the constraints for each trio can be combined into a tree structure, such as a binary tree where each internal node represents a trio and the order in which elements are arranged, then the number of linear extensions (permutations) would be 2^{n-1}, as each internal node allows two choices. This might be the case here.Indeed, if we construct a permutation by starting with one element and then inserting each subsequent element either at the beginning or the end of the current permutation, then each insertion corresponds to a choice, leading to 2^{n-1} permutations. For example, for n=3: start with 1, insert 2 before or after, making (2,1) or (1,2), then insert 3 before or after each of those, resulting in four permutations: (3,2,1), (2,3,1), (2,1,3), (1,2,3). Each time, inserting at the ends.These permutations have the property that for any trio {a, b, c}, the earliest element inserted among them is either first or last in the trio&#39;s order. Let&#39;s check this. Take trio {2, 3, 1} in the permutations:- In (3,2,1): order is 3,2,1. Here, 1 was inserted last, so it&#39;s at the end. 2 was inserted before 1, and 3 was inserted before 2. So the earliest inserted is 1, but wait, no. Wait, the insertion order was 1, then 2, then 3. But 1 was first, then 2 inserted before or after 1, and then 3 inserted before or after the current permutation. So in permutation (3,2,1), 3 was inserted before the existing permutation (2,1). So in the trio {1,2,3}, the earliest inserted element is 1, but in this permutation, 1 is last. Hmm, maybe the earliest inserted element is not necessarily first or last.Wait, maybe another way: Each element is inserted either at the front or the back. So the position of each element depends on the choices made during insertion. For example, if we start with 1, insert 2 in front: (2,1). Then insert 3 in front: (3,2,1). In this case, 3 is first, 2 is middle, 1 is last. Alternatively, insert 3 after: (2,1,3). Here, 2 is first, 1 is middle, 3 is last. Wait, so in this case, for the trio {2,1,3}, in permutation (2,1,3), 1 is between 2 and 3. But according to the problem&#39;s condition, there should be one element not between the others in every permutation. Wait, but in the set S built by inserting at the ends, does it satisfy that for every trio, there is one element that is never between the others?Wait, let&#39;s take the trio {1,2,3} in the four permutations:1. (3,2,1): order 3,2,1. Here, 2 is between 3 and 1.2. (2,3,1): order 2,3,1. Here, 3 is between 2 and 1.3. (2,1,3): order 2,1,3. Here, 1 is between 2 and 3.4. (1,2,3): order 1,2,3. Here, 2 is between 1 and 3.So in each permutation, the middle element is between the other two. Therefore, for the trio {1,2,3}, in every permutation of S, there exists a middle element. But according to the problem&#39;s condition, in each permutation, one of the numbers does not lie between the other two. But in this case, two numbers do not lie between the other two (the first and the last). So the condition is satisfied. Wait, the problem says &quot;one of these numbers does not lie in between the other two numbers in every permutations p_i&quot;. So as long as in every permutation, for every trio, at least one number is not between the others, then the condition is satisfied. Since in every permutation, two numbers are at the ends and one is in the middle, the two ends are not between the others, so the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the set S can be all 2^{n-1} permutations generated by inserting elements at the front or back. But in this case, for n=3, we have 4 permutations, which is 2^{3-1}=4. However, in each permutation, for each trio, two elements are not between the others. So the problem&#39;s condition is satisfied.But if the problem&#39;s condition is actually stricter, i.e., for each trio {a, b, c}, there exists a single element x such that in every permutation in S, x is not between the other two. Then, in the example above, for trio {1,2,3}, in permutation (3,2,1), x could be 3 or 1; in permutation (2,3,1), x could be 2 or 1; etc. But if x needs to be the same across all permutations, then this construction might not work. For example, if for trio {1,2,3}, we need that in all permutations in S, 1 is not between 2 and 3. But in permutation (2,1,3), 1 is between 2 and 3, which would violate the condition. Therefore, if the problem requires a fixed x for each trio, then the set S of permutations generated by inserting at the ends does not satisfy the condition because the non-between element can vary across permutations.Therefore, there is a misinterpretation earlier. If the problem requires that for each trio {a, b, c}, there exists a fixed element x (depending on the trio) such that in every permutation in S, x is not between the other two. Then, the set S must be such that for each trio, x is always at the ends in every permutation of S. So x is either the minimum or maximum in some global order.This sounds like the set S is the set of all linear extensions of a poset where each element is comparable to every other element, but that&#39;s a total order, which would only have m=1. But that&#39;s not the case.Alternatively, perhaps the poset is constructed such that for each trio, one element is either above or below the other two, forming a semi-lattice. If we can build a poset where for each trio, one element is minimal or maximal, then the number of linear extensions could be larger.Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, which involves monotonic subsequences. But I don&#39;t see a direct connection.Wait, let me think. If for each trio, one element is never the middle one, then the set S consists of permutations that avoid having certain elements in the middle of trios. If we can structure the permutations such that each element is either always to the left or always to the right of any other pair, that would satisfy the condition.Wait, this is similar to the concept of a &quot;circular permutation&quot; where elements are arranged around a circle, and direction matters. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, if we arrange the elements in a linear order where each element is either added to the left or the right end, as before. But if we fix a global order where each element is added to one side, then for any trio, the order of their insertion determines their position. For example, if elements are inserted in the order 1, 2, 3, ..., n, each time choosing to add to the left or right. Then, for any trio, the earliest inserted element among them will be either the leftmost or rightmost, depending on the insertion choices. However, the problem is that the insertion choices can vary, so the earliest inserted element could end up in the middle if subsequent insertions are on both sides. Wait, no. Once an element is inserted to the left or right, its position relative to the existing elements is fixed. For example, inserting 1, then inserting 2 to the left gives (2,1). Then inserting 3 to the right gives (2,1,3). In this permutation, 2 is before 1 and 3, 1 is between 2 and 3. But 1 was inserted after 2 but before 3. Wait, maybe not.Wait, if you build the permutation by adding elements to the left or right, the relative order of the existing elements is preserved. For example, starting with 1. Adding 2 to the left: 2,1. Adding 3 to the left: 3,2,1. Alternatively, adding 3 to the right: 2,1,3. Similarly, if you start with 1, add 2 to the right: 1,2. Add 3 to the left: 3,1,2. Add 3 to the right: 1,2,3.In this construction, each element is either placed at the far left or the far right. Therefore, for any two elements, their relative order depends on when they were inserted. For example, if i &lt; j, and during insertion, if j is always added to the right, then i will be to the left of j. If j is added to the left, then j will be to the left of i. However, once you place an element, its position relative to previously placed elements is fixed. So, for example, if we insert 1, then insert 2 to the left, making (2,1). Then insert 3 to the left, making (3,2,1). Then insert 4 to the right, making (3,2,1,4). In this permutation, 4 is after 1, but since 4 was inserted last and added to the right, it&#39;s at the end.The key property is that in such a permutation, for any three elements, the one inserted last among them will be either the leftmost or the rightmost. Because when you insert an element, it&#39;s placed at one of the ends, and the relative order of the existing elements is preserved. So, if you take any three elements, the last one to be inserted is at an end, hence not between the other two. Therefore, in this set of permutations (built by inserting each element at the left or right end), for any trio, the last inserted element among them is not between the other two. Therefore, this satisfies the problem&#39;s condition: for every three numbers, there exists one (the last inserted) that is not between the other two in every permutation. Wait, but it&#39;s not the same element for all permutations. Depending on the insertion order, different elements could be the last inserted. Wait, no. Wait, if you fix the insertion order of elements (e.g., inserting 1, then 2, then 3, ..., n), but choosing at each step to add to the left or right. Then, for any trio, the element with the highest insertion time (i.e., the last one inserted among the three) will be at either end in the permutation. Because when you insert it, you place it at an end, and the other two were already inserted earlier, so their relative order is maintained. Therefore, the last inserted element is not between the other two. Hence, in every permutation constructed this way, for any trio, the last inserted element (according to the insertion order) is not between the other two. However, the insertion order is fixed (1, 2, 3, ..., n), but the choices of left or right are variable. Therefore, in all such permutations, for any trio {a, b, c}, the element with the largest label (assuming insertion order is 1 to n) is not between the other two. Wait, no, the insertion order is fixed, but the labels are arbitrary. Wait, no. If we label the elements as 1, 2, ..., n in the order they are inserted, then the last inserted among any three would be the one with the highest label. So if we insert in the order 1, 2, ..., n, then in any trio {i, j, k} where i &lt; j &lt; k, k is inserted last, so in all permutations built this way, k is either first or last among i, j, k. Therefore, in this case, the set S consists of all permutations generated by this insertion method, and for every trio, the largest element is always at the ends. Therefore, this set S satisfies the problem&#39;s condition, with m=2^{n-1}, since each element after the first can be inserted in two ways.Hence, this gives us a lower bound of 2^{n-1} for m. The question is, is this the maximum possible?Suppose there exists a set S with more than 2^{n-1} permutations satisfying the condition. However, each permutation in S must avoid having a specific element in the middle for every trio. If we can show that such permutations must form a structure isomorphic to the insertion-at-ends permutations, then 2^{n-1} is indeed the maximum.Alternatively, consider that each permutation can be represented as a sequence of decisions (left or right) when inserting elements, leading to a binary decision tree with n-1 decisions (since the first element has no choice), resulting in 2^{n-1} permutations. This is similar to the concept of a &quot;zigzag&quot; permutation or an &quot;indecomposable&quot; permutation, but not exactly.Another way to think about it is that such permutations correspond to the linear extensions of a poset where each element i is required to be either before or after all previous elements. This poset is a union of chains where each new element is incomparable to the previous ones but must be placed at the ends. The number of linear extensions is 2^{n-1}, which matches our earlier result.To confirm that 2^{n-1} is indeed the maximum, assume that there exists a permutation not constructed by this end-insertion method. Then, in such a permutation, there exists an element that is inserted somewhere in the middle, not at the ends. This would cause some trio to have their &quot;latest&quot; element in the middle, violating the condition. Therefore, all permutations must be constructed by inserting each element at the ends, leading to exactly 2^{n-1} permutations.Therefore, the maximum value of m is 2^{n-1}.Final AnswerThe maximum value of ( m ) is (boxed{2^{n-1}}).&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum value of ( m ) for the given problem, we need to consider permutations of the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}) such that for every three distinct numbers, one of these numbers does not lie between the other two in every permutation ( p_i ).Key steps leading to the solution:1. Understanding the Condition: For every trio of numbers ({a, b, c}) in any permutation ( p_i ), one number must not be between the other two. This means that for each trio, one number must be either first or last among the three in every permutation.2. Permutation Construction: Consider constructing permutations by inserting each element either at the beginning or the end of the current permutation. This method ensures that each new element is placed at an extreme end, maintaining the condition that for any trio, the last inserted element among them will be at one of the ends.3. Binary Decision Tree: Each element after the first can be inserted in two ways (either at the left end or the right end). This results in a binary decision tree with ( n-1 ) levels, leading to ( 2^{n-1} ) permutations.4. Verification: Each permutation constructed this way satisfies the condition that for any trio ({a, b, c}), the element inserted last among them (which is the largest if inserted in order) will be at one of the ends, thus not between the other two. This method ensures the maximum number of permutations while adhering to the given condition.Thus, the maximum value of ( m ) is (boxed{2^{n-1}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-e644746d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-e644746d><span class="icon" data-v-e644746d>🔑:</span>1. Define the problem and base case:   We need to determine the maximum value of ( m ) such that the set ( S = {p_1, p_2, cdots, p_m} ) of permutations of ((1, 2, cdots, n)) satisfies the given condition. We denote this maximum value by ( a_n ). We aim to show that ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) by induction.   For the base case ( n = 3 ), we need to show that ( a_3 = 2^{3-1} = 4 ). Consider the permutations of ({1, 2, 3}):   [   {(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)}   ]   We can verify that any set of 4 permutations from these 6 will satisfy the condition. Thus, ( a_3 = 4 ).2. Inductive hypothesis:   Assume that for some ( n geq 3 ), ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ). We need to show that ( a_{n+1} = 2^n ).3. Constructing permutations for ( n+1 ):   Clearly, ( a_{n+1} geq 2a_n ) because we can construct permutations for ( n+1 ) by adding ( n+1 ) either at the front or the end of each permutation in a good set of size ( a_n ). This gives us ( 2a_n = 2 cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^n ).4. Contradiction argument:   Assume for contradiction that ( a_{n+1} geq 2a_n + 1 = 2^n + 1 ). Let ( {p_1, p_2, cdots, p_{2^n+1}} ) be such a good set. Consider the permutations ( p_i ) without the element ( n+1 ). These restricted permutations form a good set for ({1, 2, cdots, n}), and by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least three of the ( p_i ), say ( p_1, p_2, p_3 ), must map to the same restricted permutation of ({1, 2, cdots, n}).5. Analyzing the positions of ( n+1 ):   Since ( p_1, p_2, p_3 ) are distinct, the positions of ( n+1 ) in these permutations must be different. Without loss of generality, assume the position of ( n+1 ) in ( p_1 ) is further left than in ( p_2 ), which is further left than in ( p_3 ). Let ( a ) be an element to the right of ( n+1 ) in ( p_1 ), and ( b ) be an element to the right of ( n+1 ) in ( p_2 ). Clearly, ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct.6. Violation of the condition:   Consider the triple ({n+1, a, b}). In ( p_1 ), ( n+1 ) is to the left of ( a ), and in ( p_2 ), ( n+1 ) is to the left of ( b ). This implies that in ( p_3 ), ( n+1 ) is to the right of both ( a ) and ( b ), violating the condition that one of these numbers does not lie between the other two in every permutation.7. Conclusion:   Hence, our assumption that ( a_{n+1} geq 2^n + 1 ) leads to a contradiction.
