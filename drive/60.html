Hmm, so we have a parabola C: y = (1/2)x² and a circle D: x² + (y - 1/2)² = r², where r &gt; 0. They have no common points. Then, from a point A on the parabola C, we draw tangent lines to the circle D, and the points of tangency are E and F. When point A moves along C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. We need to find the range of the area of Ω.First, let me visualize this. The parabola y = (1/2)x² opens upwards, vertex at the origin. The circle is centered at (0, 1/2) with radius r. Since they have no common points, the circle must be either entirely above the parabola or entirely below. But given the parabola opens upwards and the circle is centered at (0, 1/2), which is above the vertex of the parabola, the circle must be small enough not to intersect the parabola. So, the distance from the center of the circle to the parabola must be greater than r. Wait, but how do we ensure they have no common points?Let me check the minimum distance from the circle&#39;s center to the parabola. The center is (0, 1/2). The parabola is y = (1/2)x². The distance squared from (0, 1/2) to a point (x, (1/2)x²) on the parabola is x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)². To find the minimum distance, we can set derivative to zero. Let me compute that.Let f(x) = x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)². Let&#39;s expand the second term: ((1/2)x² - 1/2)² = ( (x² - 1)/2 )² = (x² -1)^2 / 4. So f(x) = x² + (x² -1)^2 /4.Taking derivative f’(x):f’(x) = 2x + [2(x² -1)(2x)] /4Simplify:= 2x + [4x(x² -1)] /4= 2x + x(x² -1)= 2x + x³ - x= x³ + xSet f’(x) = 0: x³ + x = 0 =&gt; x(x² + 1) = 0. So x = 0 is the only real critical point.So the minimum distance occurs at x = 0. Plug into f(x):f(0) = 0 + (0 -1)^2 /4 = 1/4. So the minimum distance is sqrt(1/4) = 1/2. Therefore, the circle must have radius r &lt; 1/2 to not intersect the parabola. Because if r &gt;= 1/2, the circle would touch or intersect the parabola at the origin.Wait, but the circle is centered at (0, 1/2). If r is 1/2, then the circle would reach down to y = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0, which is the vertex of the parabola. So the point (0,0) is on both the parabola and the circle when r = 1/2. Therefore, for no common points, we must have r &lt; 1/2. Got it.So problem states that circle D and parabola C have no common points, so r &lt; 1/2.Next, from a point A on parabola C, draw tangent lines to circle D, with points of tangency E and F. Then, when A moves along C, all points not on line EF form a planar region Ω. Need to find the range of the area of Ω.Hmm. So as point A moves, lines EF (the polars of A with respect to the circle?) move, and the union of all these lines EF sweeps out some region, and Ω is the complement of that union. So Ω is all points not lying on any of these lines EF. The question is asking for the range of the area of Ω, so depending on r, the area of Ω changes, and we need to find the possible areas given r &gt; 0 such that the circle and parabola don&#39;t intersect.Wait, but how does the area of Ω depend on r? As r varies (but must be less than 1/2), the area of Ω will change. So we need to find, for r in (0, 1/2), the possible area of Ω, and then find the range of such areas.Alternatively, maybe as r varies, the region Ω changes, and the area is a function of r. We need to find the maximum and minimum possible areas of Ω as r varies in (0, 1/2). The problem says &quot;find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;, so probably we need to express the area in terms of r and then find the possible values as r varies in (0, 1/2). But maybe it&#39;s more involved.Let me think. The region Ω is all points not on any line EF. So Ω is the complement of the union of all such lines EF as A moves along the parabola. So Ω is the set of points through which none of the lines EF pass. So Ω is the intersection of the complements of all these lines. Thus, Ω is the set of points that are not on any EF line.Alternatively, if we consider all lines EF for all A on C, then their union is a set of lines, and Ω is the plane minus these lines. But since lines are one-dimensional, their union has measure zero, so the area of Ω would be infinite. That can&#39;t be right.Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. It says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. So when A moves, each time you have a line EF, and the union of all these lines EF as A moves is a set of lines, and Ω is the complement. But the complement would still be the entire plane except those lines, which is still area infinite.But the problem states &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Wait, maybe it&#39;s the intersection? Wait, maybe the problem is translated from Chinese, and &quot;all points not on the line EF&quot; when A moves, form Ω. So as A moves, each position of A gives a line EF, and Ω is the set of points that are not on any of these lines EF. So Ω is the complement of the union of all such lines EF. But again, lines are measure zero, so Ω should have full area. But that contradicts the problem statement which says &quot;form a planar region Ω&quot;, and asks for the range of the area. Therefore, maybe my interpretation is wrong.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a different interpretation. Maybe for each point A, we have the line EF, and as A moves, EF moves, and the region Ω is the union of all lines EF. Wait, but then the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;, so Ω would be the complement of the union of EF lines. But then again, the area would be infinite. This is confusing.Wait, maybe the problem is stated differently. Let me check again: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. So for each A, when you draw the tangent lines from A to circle D, you get two tangent points E and F, and the line EF is the chord of contact. As A moves along the parabola, the chord of contact EF moves, tracing out different lines. The set Ω is all the points that are not on any of these lines EF. So Ω is the complement of the union of all such lines EF.But the union of all such lines EF is an envelope of lines, forming a curve, perhaps. The complement of this envelope would be regions bounded by these lines. But depending on the envelope, the area of Ω might be the area inside or outside the envelope. Wait, but envelope of lines can form a convex curve, and the region Ω could be either the interior or the exterior, but since the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF&quot;, perhaps Ω is the intersection of all the half-planes not containing these lines? Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe Ω is the region where no EF lines pass through, so Ω is the locus of points that are never on any EF line for any A on the parabola. Therefore, Ω is the set of points P such that for all A on C, P is not on the chord of contact EF from A. Then, to find the area of such Ω.Alternatively, maybe Ω is the union of all such lines EF, but the wording is &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. So points not lying on any EF line form Ω. But since lines are one-dimensional, Ω would be the entire plane minus those lines, which still has infinite area. But the problem asks for the range of the area of Ω, so maybe there&#39;s a different interpretation.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a misinterpretation here. The original problem says: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Maybe &quot;the line EF&quot; refers to a specific line EF when A is fixed. But as A moves, EF moves, so Ω is the intersection of all these complements. Wait, but then Ω would be the set of points that are not on any EF line for any A. So the intersection over all A of the complement of EF lines. That would be the set of points that are never on any EF line, which could be a bounded region or something else.But how do we find such a region? Let me think.Given a circle D and a parabola C, for each point A on C, the chord of contact EF is the polar line of A with respect to circle D. So the set of all such lines EF as A moves on C is the set of all polar lines of points on C with respect to D.The envelope of these lines is called the dual curve of C with respect to D. The region Ω, defined as points not on any EF line, would be the region not touched by any of these polars. The area of Ω would then depend on the envelope formed by these lines.If we can find the envelope of the EF lines, then Ω would be the complement of the envelope&#39;s interior (or exterior), and the area would be the area enclosed by the envelope or outside of it.Alternatively, maybe the envelope forms a convex curve, and Ω is either the inside or the outside. So to find the envelope of the polars of points on the parabola with respect to the circle, which might be another conic section. Then, the area of Ω would be the area inside or outside this envelope, which we need to compute.Therefore, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the envelope of the polar lines of the parabola with respect to the circle, and then computing the area of the region not covered by these lines, which would be the area bounded by the envelope.So, let&#39;s recall that the envelope of the polar lines of a curve with respect to a circle is the dual curve, which for conic sections, is also a conic. Since the original curve is a parabola, perhaps the dual curve is also a conic.Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize point A on the parabola, find the equation of the polar line EF, then find the envelope of these lines.Given that, let&#39;s proceed step by step.First, parametrize point A on the parabola C: y = (1/2)x². Let&#39;s use parameter t, so coordinates of A are (t, (1/2)t²).Now, the polar line of point A with respect to circle D: x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = r².The equation of the polar line of a point (x0, y0) with respect to the circle x² + (y - c)^2 = r² is given by:x x0 + (y - c)(y0 - c) = r²So here, c = 1/2, so the polar line of A(t, (1/2)t²) is:x t + (y - 1/2)( (1/2)t² - 1/2 ) = r²Simplify:x t + (y - 1/2)( (t² - 1)/2 ) = r²Multiply both sides by 2:2x t + (y - 1/2)(t² - 1) = 2 r²Let me rearrange this:(y - 1/2)(t² - 1) + 2x t - 2 r² = 0This is the equation of the polar line EF for a given t.To find the envelope of these lines as t varies, we can use the standard method for finding the envelope of a family of curves given by F(t, x, y) = 0. The envelope is found by solving F(t, x, y) = 0 and dF/dt = 0 simultaneously.So let&#39;s set F(t, x, y) = (y - 1/2)(t² - 1) + 2x t - 2 r² = 0Compute dF/dt:dF/dt = (y - 1/2)(2t) + 2x = 0So, we have two equations:1. (y - 1/2)(t² - 1) + 2x t - 2 r² = 02. 2t(y - 1/2) + 2x = 0Let me write equation 2 as:2t(y - 1/2) + 2x = 0 =&gt; t(y - 1/2) + x = 0 =&gt; x = -t(y - 1/2)So, from equation 2, x = -t(y - 1/2). Let&#39;s substitute this into equation 1.Substitute x = -t(y - 1/2) into equation 1:(y - 1/2)(t² - 1) + 2*(-t(y - 1/2))*t - 2 r² = 0Simplify:(y - 1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 t²(y - 1/2) - 2 r² = 0Factor out (y - 1/2):(y - 1/2)[t² - 1 - 2 t²] - 2 r² = 0Simplify inside the brackets:t² - 1 - 2 t² = -t² -1So:(y - 1/2)(-t² -1) - 2 r² = 0Multiply through by -1:(y - 1/2)(t² + 1) + 2 r² = 0But from equation 2, x = -t(y - 1/2). Let&#39;s solve for t in terms of x and y.From equation 2: t = -x / (y - 1/2), assuming y ≠ 1/2.Substitute t = -x / (y - 1/2) into the above equation:(y - 1/2)[ ( (-x / (y - 1/2))² + 1 ) ] + 2 r² = 0Simplify:(y - 1/2)[ x² / (y - 1/2)^2 + 1 ] + 2 r² = 0Multiply through:(y - 1/2)*(x² / (y - 1/2)^2 + 1) = -2 r²Simplify the left-hand side:x² / (y - 1/2) + (y - 1/2) = -2 r²Combine terms:[ x² + (y - 1/2)^2 ] / (y - 1/2) = -2 r²Multiply both sides by (y - 1/2):x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = -2 r² (y - 1/2)Bring all terms to one side:x² + (y - 1/2)^2 + 2 r² (y - 1/2) = 0Let me expand this:x² + y² - y + 1/4 + 2 r² y - 2 r²*(1/2) = 0Simplify:x² + y² - y + 1/4 + 2 r² y - r² = 0Combine like terms:x² + y² + ( -1 + 2 r² ) y + (1/4 - r²) = 0This is a quadratic equation in x and y, which should represent the envelope of the lines EF. Let&#39;s write it in standard form.x² + y² + (2 r² - 1) y + (1/4 - r²) = 0We can complete the square for y:Group terms:x² + [ y² + (2 r² - 1) y ] + (1/4 - r²) = 0Complete the square for y:Coefficient of y is (2 r² - 1). Half of that is (2 r² - 1)/2. Square is (2 r² - 1)^2 /4.So:x² + [ y² + (2 r² -1)y + (2 r² -1)^2 /4 ] - (2 r² -1)^2 /4 + (1/4 - r²) = 0Thus:x² + [ y + (2 r² -1)/2 ]^2 = (2 r² -1)^2 /4 - (1/4 - r² )Simplify the right-hand side:First, compute (2 r² -1)^2 /4:= (4 r^4 -4 r² +1)/4Then subtract (1/4 - r²):= (4 r^4 -4 r² +1)/4 -1/4 + r²= (4 r^4 -4 r² +1 -1 +4 r²)/4= (4 r^4)/4= r^4Therefore, the equation becomes:x² + [ y + (2 r² -1)/2 ]^2 = r^4So, the envelope is a circle with center at (0, (1 - 2 r²)/2 ) and radius r².Wait, let me check the sign:[ y + (2 r² -1)/2 ] is the same as [ y - (1 - 2 r²)/2 ]So, the center is (0, (1 - 2 r²)/2 ) and radius r².Therefore, the envelope of the lines EF is a circle centered at (0, (1 - 2 r²)/2 ) with radius r².Therefore, the lines EF are tangent to this circle. Therefore, the region Ω, which is the set of points not on any EF line, is the complement of the union of these tangent lines. But since the envelope is a circle, the union of all tangent lines to a circle is the exterior of the circle (for a circle, the tangent lines touch the circle but cover the entire plane outside the circle? Wait, no. Actually, the tangent lines to a circle are all the lines that touch the circle, but they don&#39;t cover the entire exterior. The region inside the circle is never touched by any tangent line, and the region outside is where the tangent lines pass through. Wait, no: tangent lines to a circle touch the circle at one point, but for each point outside the circle, there are two tangent lines from that point to the circle. However, the envelope of all tangent lines to a circle is the circle itself. Wait, no. Wait, if you take all tangent lines to a circle, their union is the set of all points on the circle. So the envelope is the circle. But in this case, the envelope is another circle. Hmm.Wait, in our case, the envelope of the polar lines EF is a circle. So all the lines EF are tangent to this circle. Therefore, the union of all lines EF is the set of points on the tangents to this envelope circle. So the region Ω, which is the complement of the union of EF lines, would be the set of points not lying on any tangent to this envelope circle. For a circle, the set of points not lying on any tangent is the interior of the circle, because all points outside the circle lie on two tangent lines, and points on the circle lie on one tangent line. Therefore, the region Ω is the interior of the envelope circle. Therefore, the area of Ω is the area of this envelope circle, which is π(r²)^2 = π r^4. Wait, but the envelope circle has radius r², so area π (r²)^2 = π r^4. But wait, the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;, which would be the interior of the envelope circle. But wait, if the envelope is a circle of radius r², then the area of Ω is π (r²)^2. But the problem asks for the range of the area of Ω as r varies in (0, 1/2). So the area would be π r^4, which for r in (0, 1/2) would range from 0 to π (1/2)^4 = π/16. So the area of Ω is (0, π/16). But wait, when r approaches 0, the envelope circle radius approaches 0, so area approaches 0. When r approaches 1/2, the envelope circle radius approaches (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so area π*(1/4)^2 = π/16. Therefore, the range is (0, π/16). But the problem states &quot;the range of the area of region Ω&quot;, so maybe it&#39;s the interval from 0 to π/16. However, the problem says &quot;find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. But before finalizing this, let me verify.Wait, but in the previous steps, we found that the envelope of the lines EF is a circle with center at (0, (1 - 2r²)/2 ) and radius r². Therefore, the region Ω is the interior of this circle because the lines EF are tangent to it. So, points inside the envelope circle are not on any EF line (since EF lines are tangent or outside), so Ω is the interior of the envelope circle, and the area is π (r²)^2 = π r^4. Therefore, as r increases from 0 to 1/2, the area of Ω increases from 0 to π (1/2)^4 = π/16. So the range is (0, π/16). But the problem states that the circle D and parabola C have no common points, so r &lt; 1/2. Therefore, the area of Ω is approaching π/16 as r approaches 1/2, but never actually reaching it. Similarly, as r approaches 0, the area approaches 0. Therefore, the range of the area is (0, π/16). But the problem asks for the range, so we need to write it as an interval.But let me double-check my reasoning. Is Ω really the interior of the envelope circle? Let&#39;s take a point inside the envelope circle. Does any line EF pass through it? Since all lines EF are tangent to the envelope circle, any point inside the envelope circle cannot be on any EF line, because the EF lines only touch the envelope circle at one point each. Therefore, points inside the envelope circle are not on any EF line, so Ω is the interior of the envelope circle, with area π r^4. Hence, the range is 0 &lt; area &lt; π/16. Therefore, the answer is that the area of Ω is in the interval (0, (π/16)), so the range is (0, π/16).But let me confirm with a specific example. Let&#39;s take r = 1/4, which is less than 1/2. Then the envelope circle has radius (1/4)^2 = 1/16, so area π*(1/16)^2 = π/256. Wait, no, wait. Wait, earlier conclusion was that the envelope circle has radius r². Wait, wait, when r is 1/2, the envelope circle radius would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so area π*(1/4)^2 = π/16. If r = 1/4, the envelope radius is (1/4)^2 = 1/16, area π*(1/16)^2 = π/256? Wait, no, wait: radius is r², so area is π*(r²)^2 = π*r^4. So yes, when r=1/4, area is π*(1/4)^4 = π/256, which is very small. When r approaches 1/2, area approaches π*(1/2)^4 = π/16. So indeed, as r increases from 0 to 1/2, the area increases from 0 to π/16.Therefore, the range of the area of region Ω is all real numbers between 0 and π/16, not including the endpoints. Therefore, the answer is (0, π/16), so the range is 0 &lt; area &lt; π/16.But the problem says &quot;Find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. So the area can be any value greater than 0 and less than π/16, depending on the value of r. Therefore, the range is (0, π/16).However, let me check again if the envelope is correctly found. The envelope was found by solving the system of equations for the polar lines and their derivatives, leading to the circle x² + [y - (1 - 2r²)/2]^2 = (r²)^2. Wait, the radius is r²? Wait, in the equation:x² + [ y + (2 r² -1)/2 ]^2 = r^4Wait, that&#39;s what we derived. Let me check again:After completing the square, we arrived at:x² + [ y + (2 r² -1)/2 ]^2 = r^4But [ y + (2 r² -1)/2 ] is the same as [ y - (1 - 2 r²)/2 ]So the center is at (0, (1 - 2 r²)/2 ) and radius squared is r^4, so radius is r². Therefore, the envelope is a circle with center (0, (1 - 2 r²)/2 ) and radius r². Therefore, the area is π (r²)^2 = π r^4.Therefore, yes, the area is π r^4, which for r in (0, 1/2) gives area in (0, π (1/2)^4 ) = (0, π/16). Therefore, the answer is that the range of the area is (0, π/16), so the area can be any real number between 0 and π/16, not including the endpoints.Therefore, the final answer is boxed{left(0, dfrac{pi}{16}right)}.Final AnswerThe range of the area of region Ω is boxed{left(0, dfrac{pi}{16}right)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the parabola ( C: y = frac{1}{2}x^2 ) and the circle ( D: x^2 + left(y - frac{1}{2}right)^2 = r^2 ) (with ( r &gt; 0 )) which have no common points, we need to find the range of the area of the region ( Omega ) formed by all points not on the line ( EF ) as point ( A ) moves along the parabola ( C ).1. Distance from Circle to Parabola:   - The circle is centered at ( (0, frac{1}{2}) ) with radius ( r ).   - The minimum distance from the center of the circle to the parabola is ( frac{1}{2} ), so ( r &lt; frac{1}{2} ) to ensure no common points.2. Equation of the Polar Line:   - For a point ( A(t, frac{1}{2}t^2) ) on the parabola, the polar line (chord of contact) with respect to the circle is derived as:     [     xt + (y - frac{1}{2})(frac{t^2 - 1}{2}) = r^2     ]   - Simplifying and solving for the envelope of these lines, we find the envelope is a circle.3. Envelope of Polar Lines:   - The envelope of the polar lines forms a circle centered at ( (0, frac{1 - 2r^2}{2}) ) with radius ( r^2 ).4. Area of Region ( Omega ):   - The region ( Omega ) is the interior of this envelope circle, hence its area is ( pi (r^2)^2 = pi r^4 ).   - As ( r ) varies from 0 to ( frac{1}{2} ), the area of ( Omega ) ranges from 0 to ( pi left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 = frac{pi}{16} ).Thus, the range of the area of region ( Omega ) is (boxed{left(0, dfrac{pi}{16}right)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I might make some mistakes along the way, but I&#39;ll try to correct them as I go.First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. We have a parabola C defined by y = (1/2)x² and a circle D with equation x² + (y - 1/2)² = r² where r &gt; 0. These two curves have no common points. Then, from a point A on the parabola C, we draw tangent lines to the circle D, and the points of tangency are E and F. As point A moves along C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. We need to find the range of the area of Ω.Hmm, so the region Ω is formed by all the points not lying on any of the lines EF as A moves along the parabola. That means Ω is the complement of the union of all such lines EF. The area of Ω will depend on how these lines EF sweep across the plane as A moves. The problem asks for the range of possible areas of Ω depending on the radius r of the circle D, given that the circle and parabola don&#39;t intersect.First, since the circle and parabola have no common points, we need to find the condition on r for which this is true. Maybe solving the system of equations given by the parabola and the circle will tell us when there are no solutions.Let me start by finding the condition that the circle D and parabola C have no common points. So, substitute y from the parabola equation into the circle equation.Parabola: y = (1/2)x²Circle: x² + (y - 1/2)² = r²Substitute y into the circle equation:x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)² = r²Let me simplify this:Let’s compute ((1/2)x² - 1/2)² = ( (x² - 1)/2 )² = (x² - 1)² / 4So, the equation becomes:x² + (x² - 1)² / 4 = r²Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:4x² + (x² - 1)² = 4r²Expand (x² - 1)²:(x²)^2 - 2x² + 1 = x^4 - 2x² + 1So the equation becomes:x^4 - 2x² + 1 + 4x² = 4r²Combine like terms:x^4 + 2x² + 1 = 4r²Note that x^4 + 2x² + 1 = (x² + 1)^2Therefore, the equation simplifies to:(x² + 1)^2 = 4r²Take square roots:x² + 1 = ±2rBut since x² + 1 is always positive (as x² is non-negative), the right-hand side must also be positive. So, x² + 1 = 2r. But the original equation would have solutions only if 2r is greater than or equal to 1, since x² + 1 is at least 1 (when x=0). Wait, but actually, the left-hand side is (x² + 1)^2 = 4r², so taking square roots gives x² + 1 = 2r (since r &gt; 0, 2r is positive). So x² + 1 = 2r. Then x² = 2r - 1. For real solutions, we need 2r - 1 ≥ 0, so r ≥ 1/2.But wait, the problem states that the circle and parabola have no common points. Therefore, the equation (x² + 1)^2 = 4r² must have no real solutions. So, when does x² + 1 = 2r have no real solutions? If 2r &lt; 1, because x² + 1 is always at least 1. Therefore, x² + 1 = 2r implies 2r ≥ 1 for real solutions. Hence, if 2r &lt; 1, there are no real solutions. Therefore, the condition for the circle and parabola to have no common points is r &lt; 1/2.Wait, hold on. Let me verify that. If we have (x² + 1)^2 = 4r², then x² + 1 = ±2r. But since x² + 1 ≥ 1, the equation x² + 1 = -2r has no solutions because -2r &lt; 0. So the only possible equation is x² + 1 = 2r. Therefore, real solutions exist only if 2r ≥ 1, i.e., r ≥ 1/2. Hence, for the circle and parabola to have no common points, we need r &lt; 1/2.Wait, but when r = 1/2, the equation x² + 1 = 2*(1/2) = 1, so x² + 1 = 1 implies x² = 0, so x = 0, then y = (1/2)(0)^2 = 0. So the point (0,0) is on both the parabola and the circle when r = 1/2. Therefore, for r ≤ 1/2, the circle and parabola intersect? Wait, but when r = 1/2, the circle is centered at (0, 1/2) with radius 1/2. So the circle has center (0, 1/2) and radius 1/2, meaning it goes from (0, 1/2 - 1/2) = (0, 0) to (0, 1/2 + 1/2) = (0, 1). So the point (0,0) is on both the parabola and the circle. Therefore, when r = 1/2, the two curves intersect at (0,0). Hence, for r &lt; 1/2, the circle is smaller, so the center is at (0, 1/2) and radius r &lt; 1/2, so the circle is entirely above y = 1/2 - r. Since r &lt; 1/2, the lowest point on the circle is y = 1/2 - r &gt; 0. The parabola y = (1/2)x² is U-shaped opening upwards with vertex at (0,0). So the lowest point on the circle is y = 1/2 - r &gt; 0, which is above the vertex of the parabola. Since the parabola opens upwards and the circle is above it, maybe they don&#39;t intersect. Let&#39;s check for r &lt; 1/2, is there any intersection?Suppose we take r = 1/4. Then the circle equation is x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16. The center is (0, 1/2), radius 1/4. The lowest point on the circle is y = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. The parabola y = (1/2)x². So at y = 1/4, the parabola has x² = 2*(1/4) = 1/2. So x = ±√(1/2). But the circle at y = 1/4 would have x² + (1/4 - 1/2)^2 = 1/16. So x² + ( -1/4)^2 = x² + 1/16 = 1/16, which implies x² = 0. Therefore, the circle at y = 1/4 only has the point (0, 1/4). But the parabola at y = 1/4 has x = ±√(1/2). So those points are not on the circle. Therefore, the circle is above the parabola? Wait, no. Wait, the circle&#39;s lowest point is (0, 1/4) when r = 1/4, and the parabola at x=0 is (0,0). So the circle is above the parabola. Then, does the circle ever meet the parabola? Let&#39;s plug the parabola into the circle equation again.For r &lt; 1/2, the equation (x² + 1)^2 = 4r² would imply that x² + 1 = 2r. But since 2r &lt; 1 (because r &lt; 1/2), then x² + 1 = 2r would require x² = 2r - 1, which is negative. Therefore, no real solutions. Hence, for r &lt; 1/2, the circle and parabola do not intersect. When r = 1/2, they touch at (0,0). For r &gt; 1/2, they intersect at two points (since the equation x² +1 = 2r gives x² = 2r -1, which has two real solutions when 2r -1 &gt; 0, i.e., r &gt; 1/2). Therefore, the original problem states that the circle and parabola have no common points, so r &lt; 1/2.Got it. So we are working with r in (0, 1/2).Now, the next part: from a point A on the parabola C, we draw tangent lines to the circle D, with points of tangency E and F. As A moves along C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. We need to find the range of the area of Ω.So, first, for a given point A on the parabola, we can draw two tangent lines to the circle D, which touch the circle at E and F. Then, the line EF is the chord of contact from point A to the circle D. As A moves along the parabola, the chord of contact EF moves, sweeping out lines in the plane. The region Ω is the set of all points not lying on any of these lines EF. Therefore, Ω is the complement of the union of all such lines EF as A moves along C. The problem asks for the range of the area of Ω as r varies in (0, 1/2).So, the area of Ω would be the area of the plane minus the area covered by all these lines EF. However, lines have zero area, but if they densely cover a region, then Ω would be the complement of that region. But in reality, as A moves along the parabola, the lines EF form an envelope, creating a curve, and the region inside the envelope is covered by these lines. Therefore, Ω would be the region outside this envelope. The area of Ω would then be the area outside this envelope, and we need to find how this area varies with r.Alternatively, maybe Ω is the union of all points not on any EF line. Since each EF line is a chord of contact from a point on the parabola, the set of all such lines forms a family of lines. The envelope of this family is a curve, and the region Ω is everything outside this envelope. Therefore, the area of Ω would be infinite unless the envelope bounds a finite region. Wait, but the envelope might form a convex shape, and Ω would be the plane minus that shape. But the area of Ω would be infinite unless the envelope is a closed curve enclosing a finite area, which might not be the case here. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, let&#39;s think again. The problem states: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. So as A moves, EF moves, and Ω is all points not lying on any EF. So Ω is the complement of the union of all lines EF. The union of all lines EF could form a region (perhaps bounded by the envelope of these lines), and Ω would be the complement. If the union of EF lines covers a certain area, then Ω would be the rest. However, since lines are one-dimensional, their union has measure zero, so the area of Ω would be infinite. But the problem says &quot;planar region Ω&quot;, so maybe there&#39;s a bounded region that is excluded, and Ω is the rest. Maybe not.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a misinterpretation here. The problem states: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. But when A moves, EF is different each time. So, for each A, EF is a line. Then, the union of all EF lines is a set of lines, and Ω is the complement of that. But since lines are one-dimensional, their union is a set of measure zero, so the area of Ω would still be infinite. But the problem says &quot;planar region Ω&quot;, which is confusing. Maybe there&#39;s a mistranslation or misinterpretation.Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you move point A along the parabola, the lines EF sweep out a region, and Ω is the set of all points not lying on any of these lines. So Ω is the complement of the union of all such lines. However, as lines are one-dimensional, their union has measure zero, so Ω would be the entire plane except for those lines, which would still have infinite area. But the problem says &quot;form a planar region Ω&quot;, which probably implies that Ω is a bounded region. Therefore, maybe my initial understanding is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps Ω is the set of all points through which no line EF passes. That is, Ω consists of points that are not on any EF line as A moves. In that case, Ω would be the set of points that cannot be touched by any tangent from any A on the parabola to the circle D. Then, the area of Ω would be the area of such points. But even so, how does that form a planar region? Maybe Ω is the envelope of these lines, but the envelope is a curve. Wait, this is getting confusing.Let me check the original problem again: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Hmm, maybe when they say &quot;all points not on the line EF&quot;, they mean for each A, take the complement of line EF, and then take the intersection over all such complements as A moves. Wait, no. If you take the complement of each EF line, then the intersection of all these complements would be the set of points that are not on any EF line, which is Ω. So Ω is the intersection of all complements of EF lines. Therefore, Ω is the set of points that are not on any EF line. Therefore, Ω is the plane minus the union of all EF lines. But as lines are one-dimensional, the area of Ω is still infinite, but the problem says &quot;find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. That doesn&#39;t make sense unless Ω is bounded.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and the translation might have some nuances. The original says: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Maybe when A moves, the lines EF sweep out a certain region, and the points not on EF at each position form Ω. Wait, but if you take all points not on EF for any A, then Ω is the complement of the union of all EF lines, which is still the entire plane minus those lines, which is infinite.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the locus of points not lying on any EF line, which could form a region bounded by the envelope of these lines. The envelope of a family of lines is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. The region inside the envelope might be covered by the lines EF, so Ω would be the region outside the envelope. Therefore, the area of Ω would be the area outside the envelope. If the envelope is a convex closed curve, then Ω would be the area outside, which is infinite. But maybe in this case, the envelope is another parabola or some closed curve.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Let me recall that the set of all tangent lines from a point outside a circle is the chord of contact. For a fixed circle, as the external point moves along a parabola, the chord of contact (EF line) will trace out some envelope. The envelope of these lines would form a curve, and the region Ω is everything outside of this envelope. But again, unless the envelope is a closed curve, the area would be infinite.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D, but no, it says planar region. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I need to recall that the set of all chords of contact from points on the parabola to the circle forms another conic section. The envelope of the chords of contact from a moving point on a conic is another conic. Maybe Ω is the region inside or outside this conic, and the area is the area of that region.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the dual problem. The chord of contact from a point A to the circle D is the line EF. The set of all such lines EF as A moves on the parabola C forms a family of lines. The envelope of this family is a curve, and the region Ω is the complement of this envelope. The area bounded by the envelope would be the region covered by all these lines, so Ω is the region outside, which might have a finite area if the envelope is a closed curve.Alternatively, maybe the envelope is a parabola or an ellipse. Let&#39;s try to compute the envelope of these lines EF.To find the envelope of the family of lines EF as A moves along the parabola C.First, let&#39;s parametrize point A on the parabola C. Let’s let point A be (t, (1/2)t²) for some parameter t ∈ ℝ.From point A, we draw the two tangent lines to the circle D: x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = r².The equation of the chord of contact from point A to the circle D is given by the tangent line equation. For a circle with center (h, k) and radius r, the equation of the chord of contact from an external point (x1, y1) is (x1)(x) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r². Wait, let me recall the formula correctly.The equation of the chord of contact from an external point (x1, y1) to the circle x² + (y - a)^2 = r² is:x x1 + (y - a)(y1 - a) = r²Wait, no. Let me derive it.The general equation for the chord of contact from point (x1, y1) to the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 is:(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r^2But this is only if (x1, y1) is outside the circle.In our case, the circle is x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = r^2, so center (0, 1/2), radius r. The external point is A(t, t²/2). Since the circle and parabola do not intersect, and the parabola is below the circle (as the circle&#39;s lowest point is 1/2 - r &gt; 0 when r &lt; 1/2, and the parabola&#39;s vertex is at (0,0)), so point A is always outside the circle. Therefore, the chord of contact exists.So the equation of the chord of contact (line EF) from point A(t, t²/2) to the circle is:x * t + (y - 1/2)( (t²/2) - 1/2 ) = r²Simplify:x t + (y - 1/2)( (t² - 1)/2 ) = r²Multiply through by 2 to eliminate denominator:2 x t + (y - 1/2)(t² - 1) = 2 r²Let me expand this:2 x t + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) = 2 r²Bring all terms to one side:2 x t + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 0This is the equation of the line EF for a given t.To find the envelope of this family of lines, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves given by F(t, x, y) = 0. The envelope satisfies both F(t, x, y) = 0 and dF/dt = 0.So let’s define F(t, x, y) = 2 x t + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 0.Compute dF/dt:dF/dt = 2 x + y(2 t) - (1/2)(2 t) = 2x + 2 t y - tSet dF/dt = 0:2x + 2 t y - t = 0So, we have two equations:1. 2 x t + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 02. 2x + 2 t y - t = 0We can solve these equations to find the envelope.Let me denote equation 2 as:2x + 2 t y - t = 0 ⇒ 2x = t - 2 t y ⇒ x = (t/2)(1 - 2 y)Now, substitute x from equation 2 into equation 1:2 x t + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 0Replace x with (t/2)(1 - 2 y):2 * (t/2)(1 - 2 y) * t + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 0Simplify term by term:First term: 2 * (t/2)(1 - 2 y) * t = t²(1 - 2 y)Second term: y(t² - 1)Third term: - (1/2)(t² - 1)Fourth term: - 2 r²Combine all terms:t²(1 - 2 y) + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 0Expand the terms:= t² - 2 t² y + y t² - y - (1/2)t² + 1/2 - 2 r²Combine like terms:- The t² terms: t² - (1/2)t² = (1/2)t²- The t² y terms: -2 t² y + y t² = - t² y- The y terms: - y- Constants: 1/2 - 2 r²So, altogether:(1/2)t² - t² y - y + 1/2 - 2 r² = 0Let’s factor out terms:= (1/2)t² - y(t² + 1) + (1/2 - 2 r²) = 0Now, we need to eliminate t from this equation and equation 2. From equation 2, we have x = (t/2)(1 - 2 y). Let me solve this for t:x = (t/2)(1 - 2 y) ⇒ t = (2 x)/(1 - 2 y)Assuming 1 - 2 y ≠ 0. If 1 - 2 y = 0, then y = 1/2, but let&#39;s see.Substitute t = 2x/(1 - 2 y) into the equation:(1/2)( (2x)/(1 - 2 y) )² - y( ( (2x)/(1 - 2 y) )² + 1 ) + (1/2 - 2 r²) = 0Let me compute each term:First term:(1/2)(4x²/(1 - 2 y)^2 ) = 2x²/(1 - 2 y)^2Second term:- y(4x²/(1 - 2 y)^2 + 1 ) = - y( (4x² + (1 - 2 y)^2 ) / (1 - 2 y)^2 )Third term:+ (1/2 - 2 r²)Combine all terms:2x²/(1 - 2 y)^2 - y(4x² + (1 - 2 y)^2 ) / (1 - 2 y)^2 + (1/2 - 2 r²) = 0Multiply all terms by (1 - 2 y)^2 to eliminate denominators:2x² - y(4x² + (1 - 2 y)^2 ) + (1/2 - 2 r²)(1 - 2 y)^2 = 0Expand the terms:First term: 2x²Second term: - y(4x² + 1 - 4 y + 4 y² ) = -4x² y - y + 4 y² - 4 y³Third term: (1/2 - 2 r²)(1 - 4 y + 4 y² ) = (1/2 - 2 r²) - 4 y (1/2 - 2 r²) + 4 y² (1/2 - 2 r²)Expand third term:= (1/2 - 2 r²) - 2 y (1 - 4 r²) + 2 y² (1 - 4 r²)Combine all terms:2x² -4x² y - y + 4 y² -4 y³ + (1/2 - 2 r²) - 2 y (1 - 4 r²) + 2 y² (1 - 4 r²) = 0Let me collect like terms:Terms with x²:2x² -4x² yTerms with y³:-4 y³Terms with y²:4 y² + 2 y² (1 - 4 r²) = 4 y² + 2 y² - 8 r² y² = 6 y² - 8 r² y²Terms with y:- y -2 y (1 - 4 r²) = - y -2 y + 8 r² y = -3 y +8 r² yConstant term:(1/2 - 2 r²)So the equation becomes:(2x² -4x² y) + (-4 y³) + (6 y² -8 r² y²) + (-3 y +8 r² y) + (1/2 -2 r²) = 0Factor terms where possible:For x² terms: 2x²(1 - 2 y)For y³ term: -4 y³For y² term: y²(6 -8 r²)For y term: y(-3 +8 r²)Constant term: (1/2 -2 r²)Thus, the entire equation is:2x²(1 - 2 y) -4 y³ + y²(6 -8 r²) + y(-3 +8 r²) + (1/2 -2 r²) = 0This seems complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.Alternatively, let&#39;s see if this equation can be recognized as a conic section or another standard curve.Alternatively, maybe there is a smarter way to find the envelope. Let me recall that the envelope of chords of contact from a point moving along a given curve is called the pedal curve of the original curve with respect to the circle. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, since the original curve is a parabola and we are taking chords of contact to a circle, the envelope might be another conic. Let me check for specific values of r.Let’s take r approaching 0. When r is very small, the circle is almost a point at (0, 1/2). The chords of contact from points on the parabola to the circle would be lines tangent to the circle. As the circle shrinks to a point, the chords of contact become the lines connecting the moving point on the parabola to the center of the circle (since the only tangent from a point to a point-circle is the line connecting them). But in this case, the envelope might collapse to a line or something else. Not sure.Alternatively, take r = 1/4. Then, the circle is at (0,1/2) with radius 1/4. The chords of contact from points on the parabola would form some envelope. Maybe this envelope is another parabola.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to parametrize the envelope equation we derived. Let me see.We have:2x²(1 - 2 y) -4 y³ + y²(6 -8 r²) + y(-3 +8 r²) + (1/2 -2 r²) = 0This is a cubic equation in y and quadratic in x², which suggests it&#39;s a higher-degree curve. Maybe it&#39;s a cubic curve, but perhaps under certain conditions, it factors.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to see if for some r, this becomes a parabola. Suppose that the coefficient of y³ is zero. The coefficient of y³ is -4. So unless we set -4 = 0, which isn&#39;t possible. So it&#39;s a cubic in y. Therefore, the envelope is a cubic curve. Hmm, that complicates things.But the problem states that Ω is a planar region formed by all points not on the line EF as A moves. If the envelope is a cubic curve, then Ω would be the region outside this cubic, which might have an infinite area, but the problem asks for the range of the area. This suggests that my approach is incorrect.Wait, maybe the problem is not about the envelope. Let me think again. The problem says: when point A moves along the parabola C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. Find the range of the area of region Ω.Perhaps Ω is the union of all the lines EF, and the complement of Ω is the region not covered by any EF line. But lines are one-dimensional, so their union has area zero. Therefore, the area of Ω would be zero, but the problem states it&#39;s a planar region, which contradicts.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the region swept by the lines EF. But again, lines sweeping the plane still have measure zero. So perhaps the problem is mistranslated, and &quot;points not on the line EF&quot; refers to something else. Wait, the original problem might be in Chinese, and the translation might have some issues.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the locus of points that are not on any EF line, which would be Ω, and the area of this locus. If EF lines sweep out a region, then Ω is the complement. But again, since lines don&#39;t cover area, Ω would be the whole plane minus lines, which has infinite area. Therefore, this can&#39;t be.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the region bounded by all lines EF. If the lines EF form a convex region, then Ω is the region outside. However, since the envelope is a cubic curve, the area might be unbounded. Alternatively, the region bounded by all lines EF might be convex, and Ω is the interior or exterior.Alternatively, perhaps Ω is the set of all points that lie on at least one line EF as A moves. Then Ω is the union of all lines EF, which is a set of lines. But the problem says &quot;planar region&quot;, so maybe Ω is the region bounded by these lines. However, unless the lines form a closed shape, the region would be unbounded.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the union of all lines EF as a closed region, but given the parabola and circle, it&#39;s unclear. Perhaps another approach is needed.Let me recall that for a circle and a parabola, the locus of the poles of a fixed line with respect to the circle as the point moves on the parabola can be a conic. But not sure.Alternatively, think about inversion. But maybe that&#39;s overcomplicating.Alternatively, consider the dual problem: the set of all lines EF is the set of all chords of contact from points on the parabola to the circle. The dual of this set might form a conic.Alternatively, think about the definition of Ω. If Ω is all points not on any EF line, then Ω is the set of points through which no chord of contact passes. In other words, points that are not on any tangent from the parabola to the circle. But such points would lie &quot;inside&quot; the envelope of the tangent lines. Wait, the envelope of the tangent lines would be the boundary between points that can be touched by a tangent from some A on the parabola and those that cannot. Therefore, Ω would be the region outside the envelope, and the area of Ω would be the area outside this envelope.If the envelope is a closed curve, then the area of Ω would be the area outside this curve, which is infinite. But the problem says &quot;the range of the area of region Ω&quot;, which suggests that the area varies with r and has a finite range. Therefore, my previous approach must be missing something.Wait, perhaps Ω is not the region outside the envelope, but the region inside the envelope. If the envelope is a closed curve, then Ω would be the region inside, which is bounded and has finite area. Then, as r changes, the area of Ω changes, and we need to find its range.But how can we determine whether the envelope is a closed curve? From the earlier derived equation, the envelope is a cubic curve, which is not closed. So perhaps the problem is not about the envelope.Alternatively, maybe Ω is the union of all lines EF, and the problem is stating that when you remove these lines from the plane, the remaining points form Ω, but since lines have no area, the area of Ω is still infinite. This seems contradictory.Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the region covered by the lines EF, and Ω is the complement. But again, area would be infinite. The problem must be misinterpreted by me.Wait, let me look back at the original problem statement:&quot;10. (20 points) Given the parabola C: y = (1/2)x² and the circle D: x² + (y - 1/2)² = r² (r &gt; 0) have no common points, a tangent line is drawn from a point A on the parabola C to the circle D, with the points of tangency being E and F. When point A moves along the parabola C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. Find the range of the area of region Ω.&quot;Ah, perhaps the problem is saying that for each position of A, we remove the line EF, and Ω is the intersection of all these complements. So Ω is the set of points that are not on any EF line as A moves. Therefore, Ω is the set of points that are never on any chord of contact line from any A on the parabola to the circle D. The problem then is to find the area of this region Ω, and how it varies with r.So, Ω is the set of points that are not on any chord of contact line EF for any A on C. The question is to find the area of such Ω and the range of this area as r varies in (0, 1/2).To find Ω, we need to find all points (x, y) such that for no t ∈ ℝ does the point (x, y) lie on the line EF corresponding to parameter t.So, given a point (x, y), we need to check if there exists a t such that (x, y) lies on the line EF for that t. If no such t exists, then (x, y) is in Ω.Therefore, the area of Ω is the area of all such (x, y) not lying on any EF line.To find this, we can rephrase the condition: for a given (x, y), the equation in t (from the line EF equation) has no solution.The line EF for parameter t is given by:2 x t + y(t² - 1) - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 0Let me rearrange this equation:y(t² - 1) + 2 x t - (1/2)(t² - 1) - 2 r² = 0Let me group terms by t² and t:t² (y - 1/2) + t (2 x) + (- y + 1/2 - 2 r²) = 0So this is a quadratic equation in t:(y - 1/2) t² + 2 x t + (- y + 1/2 - 2 r²) = 0For a given (x, y), this quadratic equation in t has no real solution if its discriminant is negative.Therefore, the condition for (x, y) to be in Ω is that the discriminant D &lt; 0.Compute discriminant D:D = (2 x)^2 - 4*(y - 1/2)*(- y + 1/2 - 2 r²)Simplify D:D = 4 x² - 4*(y - 1/2)*(- y + 1/2 - 2 r²)Factor out 4:D = 4[ x² - (y - 1/2)*(- y + 1/2 - 2 r²) ]Compute the product inside:(y - 1/2)*(- y + 1/2 - 2 r²) = (y - 1/2)*(- y + 1/2 - 2 r²)Let me expand this:= (y - ,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a parabola and a circle don&#39;t intersect, and then when you draw tangent lines from a point on the parabola to the circle, the points of tangency form a line EF. As point A moves along the parabola, all points not on the line EF form a region Ω, and I need to find the range of the area of Ω. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let&#39;s break it down step by step.First, let&#39;s understand the given equations. The parabola C is y = (1/2)x². The circle D is x² + (y - 1/2)² = r², with r &gt; 0. They have no common points, so the circle is either entirely above the parabola or entirely below. But since the parabola opens upwards and the circle&#39;s center is at (0, 1/2), which is on the y-axis above the vertex of the parabola (which is at (0,0)), maybe the circle is above the parabola but doesn&#39;t touch it. Wait, but depending on r, the circle could be large enough to intersect. But the problem says they have no common points, so we need to ensure that the circle and parabola don&#39;t intersect. Therefore, the radius r must be such that the distance from the circle&#39;s center to the parabola is always greater than r.But maybe I can find the minimum distance from the circle&#39;s center to the parabola and set that greater than r? Let me try that. The center of the circle is (0, 1/2). The distance from a point (x, y) on the parabola to the center is sqrt(x² + (y - 1/2)^2). Since y = (1/2)x², substitute that into the distance formula: sqrt(x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2). To find the minimum distance, we can square the distance to make it easier: d² = x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2.Let me compute this. Let’s set z = x². Then, the expression becomes z + ( (z/2 - 1/2) )². Let&#39;s expand that: z + ( (z - 1)/2 )² = z + ( (z - 1)² ) / 4. Let&#39;s compute (z - 1)^2 = z² - 2z + 1, so the expression becomes z + (z² - 2z + 1)/4 = (4z + z² - 2z + 1)/4 = (z² + 2z + 1)/4 = (z + 1)^2 / 4. Wait, that can&#39;t be right. Wait, let me check again.Wait, no. Let me redo the substitution. Let me take d² = x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2. Let me compute each term:First term: x².Second term: ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2. Let&#39;s factor out 1/2: (1/2(x² - 1))² = (1/4)(x² - 1)^2.So, d² = x² + (1/4)(x² - 1)^2.Let me expand (x² - 1)^2 = x^4 - 2x² + 1. So, d² = x² + (1/4)(x^4 - 2x² + 1) = x² + (x^4)/4 - (2x²)/4 + 1/4 = (x^4)/4 + x² - (x²)/2 + 1/4 = (x^4)/4 + (x²)/2 + 1/4.So, d² = (x^4 + 2x² + 1)/4 = (x^2 + 1)^2 / 4.Therefore, the distance squared is [(x² + 1)/2]^2, so the minimum distance is (x² + 1)/2. Wait, but x² can be any non-negative number, so the minimum value of (x² + 1)/2 occurs when x² is minimized, which is 0. Therefore, the minimum distance squared is (0 + 1)/2 = 1/2, so the minimum distance is sqrt(1/2) = √(2)/2 ≈ 0.707.Since the circle and the parabola have no common points, the radius r must be less than this minimum distance. Therefore, r &lt; √2 / 2 ≈ 0.707. Wait, but the circle is centered at (0, 1/2). If the radius is smaller than the minimum distance from the center to the parabola, then the circle doesn&#39;t intersect the parabola. So, r must be less than √2 / 2. Therefore, r ∈ (0, √2 / 2). Wait, but the problem says r &gt; 0, so that&#39;s given.Okay, so we know that the circle is centered at (0, 1/2) with radius r &lt; √2 / 2, so it doesn&#39;t intersect the parabola.Now, the problem states that from a point A on the parabola C, we draw tangent lines to the circle D, and the points of tangency are E and F. As A moves along C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. We need to find the range of the area of Ω.Hmm, okay. So, first, for each point A on the parabola, there are two tangent lines from A to the circle D, touching the circle at E and F. Then, the line EF is the chord of contact from point A with respect to the circle D. The set of all such lines EF as A moves along the parabola forms an envelope, and the region Ω is the complement of all these lines EF. So, Ω is the set of all points not lying on any of these lines EF. The area of Ω would then be the area of the plane minus the area covered by all these lines EF. But lines have zero area, so maybe Ω is the entire plane except for some set of lines. But the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;, but when A moves, EF changes. So, Ω is the set of points that are not on any EF line as A moves. Wait, no. Wait, the wording says: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Hmm, maybe it&#39;s mistranslated or misphrased. Wait, original problem says: &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. But when point A moves along parabola C, so for each A, we have a line EF. So as A moves, EF moves. So the union of all lines EF as A moves is some set of lines, and Ω is the complement of that union. Therefore, Ω is all points not lying on any of these lines EF. So Ω is the plane minus all these lines. Since lines are one-dimensional, their union has measure zero, so the area of Ω would be the entire plane, which is infinite. But the problem says &quot;the area of region Ω&quot;, so maybe Ω is the union of all lines EF, but that also has area zero. This is confusing.Wait, perhaps the problem is translated from Chinese, and the wording might be different. Let me read again: &quot;When point A moves along the parabola C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. Find the range of the area of region Ω.&quot; Hmm, maybe the region Ω is the intersection of all the regions not on the lines EF as A moves. Wait, but &quot;all points not on the line EF&quot; for each A. But as A moves, EF changes. So Ω would be the set of points that are not on any EF line. So Ω is the complement of the union of all EF lines. Since each EF line is a line, the union is a set of lines, and their complement is the entire plane except those lines. But since lines have zero area, the area of Ω would still be infinite. But the problem says &quot;find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. So maybe there&#39;s a different interpretation.Alternatively, maybe Ω is the envelope of all lines EF. The envelope of a family of lines is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. But in that case, the region bounded by the envelope would have an area. Alternatively, perhaps Ω is the union of all the lines EF, but as the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;, which would be the complement of the union of EF lines. But again, area is infinite.Wait, maybe the problem is that when point A moves, the line EF sweeps across the plane, and Ω is the region not covered by any of these lines. So the area of Ω would be the area of the plane minus the area covered by these lines. But since lines have zero area, Ω would have infinite area. That can&#39;t be. Therefore, my interpretation must be wrong.Wait, maybe &quot;all points not on the line EF&quot; for each A. But as A moves, EF changes. So the region Ω is the intersection of all the complements of EF lines. That is, Ω is the set of points that are not on any EF line for any A. So Ω is the set of points that are never on any EF line as A moves. Then, the area of Ω would be the area of the plane minus the union of all EF lines. But again, union of lines has area zero, so Ω has infinite area. So maybe this is not the case.Alternatively, maybe Ω is the union of all EF lines. But then Ω is a set of lines with area zero. But the problem says &quot;planar region Ω&quot;, which usually implies a two-dimensional region. So perhaps the problem is differently interpreted.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let me recall that the chord of contact from a point outside a circle is the line EF. The set of all chords of contact from points on the parabola would form a family of lines. The envelope of this family of lines is called the pedal curve or something else. The region Ω might be bounded by this envelope. Wait, the envelope of the family of chord of contact lines would form a curve, and the region Ω is either inside or outside of this envelope. But the problem states that &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Hmm, maybe Ω is the union of all the regions bounded between these lines? Not sure.Alternatively, perhaps when the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;, it actually means that for each position of A, the line EF divides the plane into two half-planes, and Ω is the intersection of all these half-planes. That is, Ω is the set of points that are on the same side of every line EF as A moves. If that&#39;s the case, then Ω would be the region that is always &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;outside&quot; all these lines, which might form a bounded region. Then, the area of Ω would be the area of that bounded region, which is finite. That makes more sense.So perhaps Ω is the locus of points that lie on the same side of every chord of contact EF as A moves along the parabola. If that&#39;s the case, then Ω would be the region bounded by the envelope of all these EF lines, and the area would be the area inside the envelope. Alternatively, the envelope forms the boundary of Ω. Therefore, the problem is to find the range of the area of Ω as r varies in (0, √2 / 2). So the area of Ω depends on r, and we need to find its range.Therefore, I need to find the envelope of the chord of contact lines EF as A moves along the parabola C, and then compute the area bounded by this envelope. Then, determine how this area changes as r varies between 0 and √2 / 2.Alright, let&#39;s try to find the equation of the chord of contact EF from a point A on the parabola to the circle D. Let&#39;s suppose point A is (a, (1/2)a²). The chord of contact from point A to the circle D is given by the equation T = 0, where T is the tangent equation. For a circle with center (h, k) and radius r, the equation of the chord of contact from an external point (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r². Wait, no. Wait, the equation of the chord of contact from point (x1, y1) to the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r^2. Wait, is that correct?Wait, the standard equation for the chord of contact from an external point (x1, y1) to the circle x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 is xx1 + yy1 + g(x + x1) + f(y + y1) + c = 0. Alternatively, for the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, the chord of contact from (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r^2. Yes, that seems right. Let me verify with a simple case. Suppose the circle is x² + y² = r², then the chord of contact from (x1, y1) is xx1 + yy1 = r². Which is correct. So for the general circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, the chord of contact from (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r².Therefore, in our case, the circle D is x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = r². So h = 0, k = 1/2. Therefore, the chord of contact from point A(a, (1/2)a²) is (a - 0)(x - 0) + ((1/2)a² - 1/2)(y - 1/2) = r². Simplifying, this is a x + ( (a² - 1)/2 )(y - 1/2) = r².So the equation of line EF (the chord of contact) is:a x + [(a² - 1)/2](y - 1/2) = r².This is the equation of the chord of contact for each point A(a, a²/2). As a varies over all real numbers, this line EF varies. The envelope of these lines is the set of points (x, y) that satisfy both the equation of the line and the derivative with respect to the parameter a. To find the envelope, we can use the method of differentiating with respect to the parameter a and solving the resulting equations.So let&#39;s denote F(a, x, y) = a x + [(a² - 1)/2](y - 1/2) - r² = 0.The envelope is found by solving the system:F(a, x, y) = 0,∂F/∂a = 0.Compute ∂F/∂a:∂F/∂a = x + [ (2a)/2 ](y - 1/2) = x + a(y - 1/2).So we have two equations:1) a x + [(a² - 1)/2](y - 1/2) = r²,2) x + a(y - 1/2) = 0.We need to solve these two equations for x and y in terms of a, and then eliminate a to find the envelope.Let me solve equation 2 for x:x = -a(y - 1/2).Now substitute this into equation 1:a*(-a(y - 1/2)) + [(a² - 1)/2](y - 1/2) = r²,Simplify:- a²(y - 1/2) + [(a² - 1)/2](y - 1/2) = r².Factor out (y - 1/2):[ -a² + (a² - 1)/2 ](y - 1/2) = r².Combine the coefficients:Multiply -a² by 2/2 to get -2a²/2, so:[ (-2a² + a² - 1)/2 ](y - 1/2) = r²,Simplify numerator:(-a² - 1)/2 * (y - 1/2) = r²,Multiply both sides by 2:(-a² - 1)(y - 1/2) = 2r²,So:(y - 1/2) = -2r² / (a² + 1).But from equation 2, x = -a(y - 1/2). Substitute the expression for (y - 1/2):x = -a * [ -2r² / (a² + 1) ] = 2a r² / (a² + 1).So we have:x = 2a r² / (a² + 1),y - 1/2 = -2r² / (a² + 1),Therefore, y = 1/2 - 2r² / (a² + 1).Now, to eliminate the parameter a, let&#39;s express a in terms of x and substitute into the equation for y.From x = 2a r² / (a² + 1), let&#39;s solve for a.Let me denote t = a. Then:x = 2 t r² / (t² + 1),Multiply both sides by (t² + 1):x(t² + 1) = 2 t r²,x t² + x = 2 t r²,x t² - 2 r² t + x = 0.This is a quadratic equation in t:x t² - 2 r² t + x = 0.Let me write it as:x t² - 2 r² t + x = 0.To solve for t, we can use the quadratic formula:t = [2 r² ± sqrt{(2 r²)^2 - 4 * x * x}]/(2x)= [2 r² ± sqrt{4 r^4 - 4 x²}]/(2x)= [2 r² ± 2 sqrt{r^4 - x²}]/(2x)= [r² ± sqrt{r^4 - x²}]/x.But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, let&#39;s use the expressions for x and y in terms of a.From x = 2a r² / (a² + 1) and y = 1/2 - 2r² / (a² + 1).Let me denote s = a² + 1. Then, since a² = s - 1, so s ≥ 1 because a² ≥ 0.Then, x = 2a r² / s,and y = 1/2 - 2r² / s.But a can be expressed in terms of x and s:From x = 2a r² / s, we have a = x s / (2 r²).But a² = s - 1, so substituting:(x s / (2 r²))² = s - 1,x² s² / (4 r^4) = s - 1,Multiply both sides by 4 r^4:x² s² = 4 r^4 (s - 1),x² s² - 4 r^4 s + 4 r^4 = 0.This is a quadratic equation in s:x² s² - 4 r^4 s + 4 r^4 = 0.Let me denote this as:x² s² - 4 r^4 s + 4 r^4 = 0.Let me solve for s using quadratic formula:s = [4 r^4 ± sqrt{16 r^8 - 16 x² r^4}]/(2 x²)= [4 r^4 ± 4 r^4 sqrt{1 - x²/( r^4)}]/(2 x²)= [4 r^4 (1 ± sqrt{1 - x²/r^4})]/(2 x²)= [2 r^4 (1 ± sqrt{1 - x²/r^4})]/x².But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, note that from x = 2a r² / (a² + 1) and y = 1/2 - 2 r² / (a² + 1). Let&#39;s express a² + 1 as a common term. Let’s denote s = a² + 1, so s ≥ 1.Then, x = 2a r² / s,and y = 1/2 - 2 r² / s.From x = 2a r² / s, we can write a = x s / (2 r²). Then, since a² + 1 = s,a² = s - 1,(x s / (2 r²))² = s - 1,x² s² / (4 r^4) = s - 1,Multiply both sides by 4 r^4:x² s² = 4 r^4 s - 4 r^4,x² s² - 4 r^4 s + 4 r^4 = 0.This quadratic in s can be rewritten as:x² s² - 4 r^4 s + 4 r^4 = 0.Let’s solve for s:s = [4 r^4 ± sqrt{(4 r^4)^2 - 16 x² r^4}]/(2 x²)= [4 r^4 ± sqrt{16 r^8 - 16 x² r^4}]/(2 x²)= [4 r^4 ± 4 r^2 sqrt{r^4 - x²}]/(2 x²)= [2 r^4 ± 2 r^2 sqrt{r^4 - x²}]/x²= 2 r^2 [ r² ± sqrt{r^4 - x²} ] / x².Hmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe there&#39;s a better way.Alternatively, notice that y = 1/2 - 2 r² / (a² + 1) and x = 2a r² / (a² + 1). Let&#39;s try to eliminate a.Let me denote t = a. Then,From x = 2 t r² / (t² + 1),Multiply numerator and denominator by 1/t (assuming t ≠ 0):x = 2 r² / (t + 1/t).Similarly, y = 1/2 - 2 r² / (t² + 1).But t + 1/t ≥ 2 (since t ≠ 0). So x = 2 r² / (t + 1/t). Therefore, |x| ≤ 2 r² / 2 = r². So x is between -r² and r². Wait, interesting.Therefore, x is bounded between -r² and r². So the envelope is a curve between x = -r² and x = r².Similarly, when t approaches infinity, x approaches 0, and y approaches 1/2 - 0 = 1/2. When t = 0, x = 0, y = 1/2 - 2 r² /1 = 1/2 - 2 r². Wait, but t = a, and a can be any real number, so t can be any real number. However, x is bounded between -r² and r². Let me check with t = 1:x = 2 * 1 * r² / (1 + 1) = r²,y = 1/2 - 2 r² / (1 + 1) = 1/2 - r².Similarly, t = -1 gives x = -r², y = 1/2 - r². So the envelope has points (r², 1/2 - r²) and (-r², 1/2 - r²). Additionally, as t approaches infinity, x approaches 0 and y approaches 1/2.Therefore, the envelope seems to be a curve connecting (-r², 1/2 - r²) to (r², 1/2 - r²), passing through (0, 1/2). Wait, maybe it&#39;s an ellipse or a parabola.Alternatively, from the parametric equations:x = 2a r² / (a² + 1),y = 1/2 - 2 r² / (a² + 1).Let me set t = a. Then, let me denote:x = (2 r² t)/(t² + 1),y = 1/2 - (2 r²)/(t² + 1).Let’s try to write this in terms of trigonometric functions. Let’s set t = tan θ. Then, t² + 1 = sec² θ. So,x = 2 r² tan θ / sec² θ = 2 r² sin θ cos θ = r² sin(2θ),y = 1/2 - 2 r² / sec² θ = 1/2 - 2 r² cos² θ = 1/2 - r² (1 + cos 2θ).But maybe this is complicating. Alternatively, let&#39;s square x and add to (y - 1/2 + 2 r² / (t² + 1))^2. Wait, perhaps we can express it in terms of x and y.From the parametric equations:Let’s write s = t² + 1, so x = 2 r² t / s,and y = 1/2 - 2 r² / s.Let me solve for s from the second equation:y = 1/2 - 2 r² / s =&gt; 2 r² / s = 1/2 - y =&gt; s = 2 r² / (1/2 - y).Substitute s into the first equation:x = 2 r² t / s = 2 r² t / [2 r² / (1/2 - y)] = t (1/2 - y).Thus, x = t (1/2 - y).But from the parametric equation, t is a parameter. Let me express t from this equation: t = x / (1/2 - y).But also, from the parametric equations, t is related to s:s = t² + 1 = 2 r² / (1/2 - y).So substitute t = x / (1/2 - y) into s = t² + 1:( x / (1/2 - y) )² + 1 = 2 r² / (1/2 - y),Multiply both sides by (1/2 - y)^2:x² + (1/2 - y)^2 = 2 r² (1/2 - y).Bring all terms to left side:x² + (1/2 - y)^2 - 2 r² (1/2 - y) = 0.Let me expand this:x² + (1/2 - y)^2 - 2 r² (1/2 - y) = 0.Let’s set u = 1/2 - y. Then the equation becomes:x² + u² - 2 r² u = 0.But u = 1/2 - y =&gt; y = 1/2 - u.Substitute back:x² + u² - 2 r² u = 0,Which is:x² + (u - r²)^2 - r^4 = 0,Therefore,x² + (u - r²)^2 = r^4,Substitute u = 1/2 - y,x² + (1/2 - y - r²)^2 = r^4.Expand the square term:x² + ( (1/2 - r²) - y )^2 = r^4,Let’s write this out:x² + ( y + r² - 1/2 )^2 = r^4.So the envelope is the circle:x² + (y + r² - 1/2)^2 = r^4.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So the envelope of all chord of contact lines EF is a circle with center at (0, 1/2 - r²) and radius r².Therefore, region Ω is either the interior or the exterior of this circle. But since the chord of contact lines are tangent to this circle, the region Ω is the set of points not lying on any of the lines EF. If the envelope is the circle, then the lines EF are all tangent to this circle. Therefore, the region Ω would be the complement of the union of all these tangent lines. However, since the lines are tangent to the circle, their union is the exterior of the circle (for lines outside the circle). Wait, no. Each tangent line touches the circle at one point, so the union of all tangent lines is the set of all points on any tangent line to the circle. But the union of all tangent lines to a circle is the entire plane except the interior of the circle. Wait, no. If you have a circle, any point outside the circle lies on exactly two tangent lines, and any point inside the circle lies on no tangent lines. Points on the circle lie on exactly one tangent line. Therefore, the union of all tangent lines to the circle is the entire plane except the interior of the circle. Therefore, the complement of this union would be the interior of the circle. Therefore, Ω is the interior of the circle x² + (y + r² - 1/2)^2 = r^4. Therefore, the area of Ω is the area of this circle, which is π(r²)^2 = π r^4.But wait, the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. If the union of all lines EF is the exterior and the boundary of the circle, then the complement would be the interior. So Ω is the interior of the circle. Thus, the area is π r^4.But wait, the circle here has radius r², centered at (0, 1/2 - r²). So the area is π (r²)^2 = π r^4. However, we need to check whether this circle is entirely valid. The center is at (0, 1/2 - r²) and radius r². The original circle D is at (0, 1/2) with radius r. Since r &lt; √2 / 2 ≈ 0.707, then 1/2 - r² is above or below? Let&#39;s see: 1/2 - r². If r is small, say approaching 0, then 1/2 - r² approaches 1/2. The radius r² approaches 0, so the circle becomes a point at (0, 1/2). As r increases to √2 / 2, then r² = (2)/4 = 1/2, so center is at 1/2 - 1/2 = 0, and radius is 1/2. So the circle becomes centered at (0,0) with radius 1/2. Wait, interesting.So as r varies from 0 to √2 / 2, the envelope circle goes from being a point at (0, 1/2) with area 0 to a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius (√2 / 2)^2 = 1/2. So its area goes from 0 up to π*(1/2)^2 = π/4. Wait, but earlier we found that the area of Ω is π r^4. Therefore, when r increases from 0 to √2 / 2, r^4 goes from 0 to ( (√2 / 2)^2 )^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the area of Ω is π r^4, ranging from 0 to π/4. Therefore, the range of the area of Ω is (0, π/4).But the problem says &quot;find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. So as r varies in (0, √2 / 2), the area of Ω is π r^4, which ranges from 0 to π*( (√2 / 2)^4 ) = π*( (4/16) ) = π/4. Therefore, the area of Ω is between 0 and π/4. However, when r approaches √2 / 2, the original circle D approaches the minimum distance to the parabola. But since the circle D must not intersect the parabola, r must be less than √2 / 2. So as r approaches √2 / 2 from below, the area of Ω approaches π/4. When r approaches 0, the area approaches 0. Therefore, the range is (0, π/4). But the problem says &quot;the range of the area&quot;, so it&#39;s the interval from 0 to π/4, not including the endpoints because r &gt; 0 and r &lt; √2 / 2.But wait, when r approaches 0, the circle D becomes a very small circle near (0, 1/2). The envelope circle, which is Ω, becomes a very small circle around (0, 1/2) with radius approaching 0. So the area approaches 0. As r increases, the envelope circle grows, moving downward and increasing in radius until, when r = √2 / 2, it is centered at (0,0) with radius 1/2. However, since r must be less than √2 / 2, the area approaches π/4 but never actually reaches it. So the range is (0, π/4). Therefore, the answer should be that the area of Ω is between 0 and π/4, so the range is (0, π/4).But let me verify this conclusion with a specific example. Suppose r = 1/2, which is less than √2 / 2 ≈ 0.707. Then, the envelope circle would be centered at (0, 1/2 - (1/2)^2) = (0, 1/2 - 1/4) = (0, 1/4), with radius (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the area is π*(1/4)^2 = π/16 ≈ 0.196. If r approaches √2 / 2, then r^4 approaches ( (√2 / 2)^2 )^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the area approaches π*(1/4) = π/4 ≈ 0.785. That makes sense.But wait, the problem states that the circle D and parabola C have no common points. Earlier, we found that the minimum distance from the center of the circle to the parabola is √(1/2), so the radius must be less than √2 / 2. Therefore, r is in (0, √2 / 2). So as r approaches √2 / 2 from below, the area of Ω approaches π/4. When r approaches 0, the area approaches 0. Therefore, the range of the area of Ω is (0, π/4). Therefore, the answer is the open interval from 0 to π/4.But in the problem statement, it says &quot;Find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. In Chinese mathematics, sometimes intervals are written including the endpoints if they are limits, even if they are not attained. However, since r &gt; 0 and r &lt; √2 / 2, the area can&#39;t actually be 0 or π/4. But depending on the problem&#39;s requirements, it might expect the interval to be written as [0, π/4] or (0, π/4). Given that r is strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than √2 / 2, the area should be in the open interval (0, π/4). However, sometimes in such optimization problems, even if the endpoints aren&#39;t attained, they are included in the range. But given the problem says &quot;the range of the area&quot;, and since the area can get arbitrarily close to 0 and π/4, but not actually reach them, the correct range is (0, π/4). However, in some contexts, especially in calculus, we might say the interval is [0, π/4], considering the limits. But since r cannot be 0 or √2 / 2, strictly, the area is indeed in (0, π/4). But I need to check if when r approaches √2 / 2, the region Ω still makes sense. When r approaches √2 / 2, the envelope circle approaches the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1/2. However, the original circle D would be tangent to the parabola at the point closest approach. Wait, when r = √2 / 2, the circle D would be tangent to the parabola. But the problem states that the circle and parabola have no common points, so r must be less than √2 / 2. Therefore, even though the area approaches π/4, it never actually reaches it. Similarly, as r approaches 0, the area approaches ,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem where a parabola and a circle don&#39;t intersect, and then when you draw tangent lines from points on the parabola to the circle, the points of tangency form a line EF. As point A moves along the parabola, all points not on the line EF form a region Ω. I need to find the range of the area of Ω.First, let&#39;s parse the problem again. The parabola is C: y = (1/2)x². The circle D is x² + (y - 1/2)² = r² with r &gt; 0. They have no common points, so the circle is either above or below the parabola without touching it. But since the parabola opens upwards and the circle is centered at (0, 1/2), probably the circle is above the parabola. But we need to confirm that they don&#39;t intersect, which would mean the radius r is small enough or large enough. Wait, but the circle equation is x² + (y - 1/2)² = r². The center is (0, 1/2). So the circle is centered at (0, 1/2) with radius r.The parabola y = (1/2)x² has its vertex at (0,0). So the distance from the center of the circle (0,1/2) to the vertex of the parabola is 1/2. So if the circle has radius r, then if r is less than 1/2, the circle would be entirely above the parabola? Wait, not necessarily. Because the parabola is opening upwards, so even if the circle is centered at (0,1/2), depending on the radius, it might intersect the parabola. So we need to find the condition for the circle and parabola to have no common points.To find if the circle and parabola intersect, substitute y from the parabola into the circle equation.So substituting y = (1/2)x² into the circle equation:x² + ( (1/2)x² - 1/2 )² = r²Simplify this:x² + ( (x² - 1)/2 )² = r²Let me compute that:First term: x²Second term: [(x² - 1)/2]^2 = (x² - 1)^2 / 4So total equation: x² + (x² - 1)^2 / 4 = r²Let&#39;s expand (x² - 1)^2:(x² - 1)^2 = x^4 - 2x² + 1So substituting back:x² + (x^4 - 2x² + 1)/4 = r²Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominator:4x² + x^4 - 2x² + 1 = 4r²Simplify:x^4 + 2x² + 1 = 4r²Notice that x^4 + 2x² + 1 = (x² + 1)^2So (x² + 1)^2 = 4r²Take square roots:x² + 1 = ±2rBut since x² + 1 is always positive, we can ignore the negative solution. Therefore:x² + 1 = 2rBut x² is non-negative, so x² = 2r - 1But x² must be real, so 2r - 1 ≥ 0 =&gt; r ≥ 1/2Wait, but if we have (x² + 1)^2 = 4r², then x² +1 = 2r or x² +1 = -2r (discarded). So real solutions exist only if 2r ≤ x² +1. But since x² can be any non-negative real number, the equation x² +1 = 2r would have solutions only if 2r ≥ 1, i.e., r ≥ 1/2. But if r ≥ 1/2, then x² = 2r -1 ≥ 0. So the circle and parabola intersect when r ≥ 1/2. But the problem states that the circle and parabola have no common points. Therefore, r must be less than 1/2. Because if r &lt; 1/2, then x² +1 = 2r would require x² = 2r -1, which is negative, so no real solutions. Therefore, the circle and parabola don&#39;t intersect when r &lt; 1/2.Therefore, the first conclusion is that r &lt; 1/2.So, now, given that, the next part is about drawing tangent lines from a point A on the parabola C to the circle D, with points of tangency E and F. Then, when A moves along the parabola, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. We need to find the range of the area of Ω.Hmm. So as point A moves along the parabola, the tangent lines from A to the circle D touch the circle at E and F. Then, the line EF is the polar line of point A with respect to the circle D. Since for each A, EF is the polar line, and as A moves, these polar lines sweep out some region. The complement of all these lines EF would be the region Ω. So the area of Ω is the area of the plane minus the union of all these lines EF. But lines have zero area, so actually, the union of all lines EF is a set of lines; however, depending on how these lines move, they might cover some area densely, but in reality, the set of all such lines EF would form an envelope, perhaps a curve, and the region Ω is the complement of that envelope. Wait, but the problem states &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Wait, perhaps for each A, EF is a line, and as A moves, these lines EF move, and the union of all these lines is a set of lines; then Ω is the complement of that union, so all points not lying on any EF line. But lines are one-dimensional, so their union is still a set of measure zero, hence the area of Ω would be the entire plane, which is infinite. But the problem says &quot;form a planar region Ω&quot;, which probably implies that Ω is the set of all points not lying on any of these lines EF, but perhaps the lines EF sweep out some bounded region, and Ω is the complement of that. Wait, but the problem says &quot;all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω&quot;. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a misinterpretation here.Wait, let&#39;s read the problem again: &quot;When point A moves along the parabola C, all points not on the line EF form a planar region Ω. Find the range of the area of region Ω.&quot;Hmm. So for each position of A, we have a line EF. As A moves, EF moves. Then, Ω is the set of all points that are not on any of the lines EF. So Ω is the complement of the union of all lines EF. The problem is to find the area of Ω. But since lines are one-dimensional, their union has measure zero, so the area of Ω would be infinite. However, the problem says &quot;form a planar region Ω&quot;, which might mean that the lines EF are forming some envelope, and Ω is the region inside or outside that envelope, but the problem is not entirely clear.Alternatively, perhaps Ω is the set of all points through which no line EF passes. Then, depending on how the lines EF move, Ω could be a region bounded by the envelope of these lines. The area of Ω would then be the area inside or outside the envelope. This is a common concept in geometry where moving lines form an envelope, and the region bounded by the envelope is the area where points are not on any of the lines.Therefore, perhaps Ω is the region inside the envelope of all lines EF, or outside. To find that, we need to find the envelope of the lines EF as A moves along the parabola.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the envelope of the polar lines (EF) of points A on the parabola with respect to the circle D. Then, Ω would be the region inside or outside this envelope, and the area of Ω would be the area bounded by the envelope.Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a convex curve, and Ω is the region outside of it, so the area is infinite minus the area inside the envelope. But since the problem asks for the range of the area of Ω, which suggests that the area varies depending on r, so we need to find how the envelope&#39;s area (or the complement&#39;s area) changes with r.Alternatively, maybe Ω is the union of all lines EF, but since lines have zero area, the area would be zero. But that can&#39;t be. So the problem must be referring to the region not covered by any of the lines EF. However, since lines are infinitely thin, the area should still be infinite. Therefore, perhaps there&#39;s a different interpretation.Wait, another way: for each point A on the parabola, the tangent lines from A to the circle D touch the circle at E and F. So, the line EF is the polar of point A with respect to the circle D. The set of all such polars as A moves on the parabola forms a family of lines. The envelope of this family is a curve, and the region Ω is the set of points not lying on any of these lines, which would be the complement of the envelope. However, the envelope itself is a curve, so its complement is everything else, which is still infinite. Therefore, this interpretation is also problematic.Alternatively, perhaps Ω is the set of points that cannot be connected to the circle D by a tangent line from a point A on the parabola. Wait, but any point outside the circle can have tangent lines to the circle. Wait, but if the point is on the parabola, which is outside the circle (since the circle is centered at (0,1/2) with radius r &lt; 1/2, so the circle is above the parabola? Wait, no. If the circle is centered at (0,1/2) with radius r &lt; 1/2, then the circle is entirely above the parabola. Wait, parabola is y = (1/2)x², so at x=0, y=0. The circle&#39;s center is (0, 1/2), radius r &lt; 1/2, so the circle is from y = 1/2 - r to y = 1/2 + r. Since r &lt; 1/2, the lowest point of the circle is at y = 1/2 - r &gt; 1/2 - 1/2 = 0. So the circle is entirely above y=0, which is the vertex of the parabola. Therefore, the parabola is below the circle. Therefore, points on the parabola are below the circle. Therefore, drawing tangent lines from a point below the circle to the circle: but from a point outside the circle, there are two tangent lines, but if the point is inside the circle, there are no real tangent lines. Wait, but if the parabola is below the circle, and the circle is centered at (0,1/2) with radius r &lt; 1/2, then the lowest point of the circle is at y = 1/2 - r &gt; 0. The parabola at x=0 is y=0, but the circle&#39;s lowest point is higher than that. Therefore, the entire parabola is below the circle. Therefore, points on the parabola are inside the circle? Wait, but the circle is centered at (0,1/2) with radius r &lt; 1/2, so the bottom of the circle is at y = 1/2 - r. Since r &lt; 1/2, 1/2 - r &gt; 0. So the parabola at y=0 is below the circle. So points on the parabola are outside the circle? Wait, no. If the circle is above the parabola, then points on the parabola are below the circle. So the distance from a point on the parabola to the center of the circle is sqrt(x² + (y - 1/2)^2). For a point (x, y) on the parabola, y = (1/2)x². Therefore, the distance squared is x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2. Earlier, we found that substituting into the circle equation gives x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2 = r². But since the circle and parabola don&#39;t intersect, this equation has no real solutions, which we determined happens when r &lt; 1/2. But the distance from a point on the parabola to the center of the circle is sqrt(x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2). Since there&#39;s no intersection, this distance is always greater than r for all x. Wait, but if the circle is centered at (0,1/2) with radius r &lt; 1/2, and the parabola is below the circle, then points on the parabola are outside the circle? Wait, no. The distance from the center of the circle (0,1/2) to a point (x, y) on the parabola is sqrt(x² + (y - 1/2)^2). Since y = (1/2)x², substitute that in: sqrt(x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2). Let&#39;s compute this for x=0: sqrt(0 + (-1/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2. Since r &lt; 1/2, then at x=0, the distance from (0,0) to the center is 1/2, which is greater than r. For other points on the parabola, as |x| increases, y increases, so the point (x, y) moves up along the parabola. The distance from (x, y) to (0,1/2) is sqrt(x² + (y - 1/2)^2). Since y = (1/2)x², plug that in: sqrt(x² + ((1/2)x² - 1/2)^2). Let&#39;s see how this behaves as x increases.Take x very large. Then y = (1/2)x² is very large, so the distance becomes approximately sqrt(x² + ( (1/2)x² )^2 ) ≈ (1/2)x². So as x grows, the distance from (x, y) to the center (0,1/2) grows to infinity. Therefore, all points on the parabola are outside the circle, because the minimal distance from the parabola to the center is 1/2 (achieved at x=0), and since the radius r &lt; 1/2, the circle is entirely inside the region where the distance from the center is less than 1/2. Therefore, points on the parabola are outside the circle. Therefore, from any point A on the parabola, we can draw two tangent lines to the circle D, touching at points E and F. The line EF is the polar of point A with respect to the circle D.Now, the polar line of A with respect to circle D is given by the equation:For circle D: x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = r², the polar line of a point A = (x₀, y₀) is:x x₀ + (y - 1/2)(y₀ - 1/2) = r²So, given that A is on the parabola C: y₀ = (1/2)x₀², substitute y₀:The polar line EF is:x x₀ + (y - 1/2)( (1/2)x₀² - 1/2 ) = r²Simplify:x x₀ + (y - 1/2)( (x₀² - 1)/2 ) = r²Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:2x x₀ + (y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) = 2r²Rearrange terms:(y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) + 2x x₀ - 2r² = 0This is the equation of the polar line EF for a given A = (x₀, (1/2)x₀²).Now, to find the envelope of these lines as A moves along the parabola, we can treat x₀ as a parameter and find the envelope by solving the system of equations:F(x, y, x₀) = (y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) + 2x x₀ - 2r² = 0anddF/dx₀ = 0Compute dF/dx₀:Differentiate F with respect to x₀:d/dx₀ [ (y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) + 2x x₀ - 2r² ] = (y - 1/2)(2x₀) + 2x = 0So the second equation is:2x₀(y - 1/2) + 2x = 0Simplify:x₀(y - 1/2) + x = 0 =&gt; x = -x₀(y - 1/2)So we have two equations:1) (y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) + 2x x₀ - 2r² = 02) x = -x₀(y - 1/2)We can substitute equation 2 into equation 1 to eliminate x.Substitute x = -x₀(y - 1/2) into equation 1:(y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) + 2*(-x₀(y - 1/2))*x₀ - 2r² = 0Simplify term by term:First term: (y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1)Second term: 2*(-x₀(y - 1/2))*x₀ = 2*(-x₀²(y - 1/2))Third term: -2r²So overall:(y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) - 2x₀²(y - 1/2) - 2r² = 0Factor out (y - 1/2):(y - 1/2)[x₀² - 1 - 2x₀²] - 2r² = 0Simplify inside the brackets:x₀² - 1 - 2x₀² = -x₀² - 1Therefore:(y - 1/2)(-x₀² - 1) - 2r² = 0Multiply through by -1:(y - 1/2)(x₀² + 1) + 2r² = 0So:(y - 1/2)(x₀² + 1) = -2r²Now, solve for x₀²:x₀² + 1 = -2r² / (y - 1/2)But x₀² + 1 is always positive (since x₀² ≥ 0), so the right-hand side must also be positive. Therefore:-2r² / (y - 1/2) &gt; 0Which implies that y - 1/2 &lt; 0, so y &lt; 1/2Therefore, the envelope exists only for y &lt; 1/2So, from x₀² + 1 = -2r² / (y - 1/2), we can write:x₀² = (-2r² / (y - 1/2)) - 1But x₀² must be non-negative, so:(-2r² / (y - 1/2)) - 1 ≥ 0Multiply both sides by (y - 1/2), but since y &lt; 1/2, (y - 1/2) is negative, so inequality reverses:-2r² - (y - 1/2) ≤ 0Simplify:-2r² - y + 1/2 ≤ 0=&gt; -y ≤ 2r² - 1/2Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):y ≥ 1/2 - 2r²But we already have y &lt; 1/2 from before.Therefore, combining the two:1/2 - 2r² ≤ y &lt; 1/2So the envelope is defined for y in [1/2 - 2r², 1/2)Now, from equation 2: x = -x₀(y - 1/2)Express x₀ from equation 2:x₀ = -x / (y - 1/2)Substitute into x₀²:x₀² = x² / (y - 1/2)^2Then substitute into x₀² + 1 = -2r² / (y - 1/2)So:x² / (y - 1/2)^2 + 1 = -2r² / (y - 1/2)Multiply both sides by (y - 1/2)^2:x² + (y - 1/2)^2 = -2r²(y - 1/2)Bring all terms to left-hand side:x² + (y - 1/2)^2 + 2r²(y - 1/2) = 0Let me expand (y - 1/2)^2:(y - 1/2)^2 = y² - y + 1/4So substitute back:x² + y² - y + 1/4 + 2r²(y - 1/2) = 0Expand the 2r² term:x² + y² - y + 1/4 + 2r²y - r² = 0Combine like terms:x² + y² + (-1 + 2r²)y + (1/4 - r²) = 0This is the equation of the envelope. Let&#39;s write it as:x² + y² + (2r² - 1)y + (1/4 - r²) = 0This is a quadratic equation, likely representing a circle or a conic section. Let&#39;s check.The general equation of a conic is Ax² + By² + Cx + Dy + E = 0. Here, A = 1, B = 1, C = 0, D = 2r² - 1, E = 1/4 - r². Since A = B and there is no xy term, this is a circle.To write it in standard form, complete the square for y:x² + y² + (2r² - 1)y = - (1/4 - r²)Complete the square for y:The coefficient of y is (2r² - 1). Half of that is (2r² - 1)/2, square is [(2r² - 1)/2]^2.So:x² + [y² + (2r² - 1)y + ((2r² - 1)/2)^2] = - (1/4 - r²) + ((2r² - 1)/2)^2Left side becomes:x² + [y + (2r² - 1)/2]^2Right side:= -1/4 + r² + ( (2r² - 1)^2 ) / 4Expand (2r² - 1)^2:= 4r^4 - 4r² + 1Therefore, right side:= -1/4 + r² + (4r^4 - 4r² + 1)/4= -1/4 + r² + r^4 - r² + 1/4Simplify:= (-1/4 + 1/4) + (r² - r²) + r^4= r^4Therefore, the equation becomes:x² + [y + (2r² - 1)/2]^2 = r^4This is a circle with center at (0, (1 - 2r²)/2) and radius r².Wait, let&#39;s check:The standard form is x² + (y - k)^2 = R², so here k = -(2r² - 1)/2 = (1 - 2r²)/2And R² = r^4, so radius is r².Therefore, the envelope of the lines EF is a circle with center (0, (1 - 2r²)/2) and radius r².So, the envelope is this circle. Therefore, the region Ω is all points not on any of the lines EF, which would be the complement of the union of all these lines. But since the envelope is a circle, the lines EF are tangent to this envelope circle. Therefore, the union of all lines EF is the set of all tangent lines to this envelope circle. However, the complement of all tangent lines to a circle would be the interior of the circle, because all points outside the circle lie on some tangent line, while points inside the circle do not lie on any tangent line.Wait, that makes sense. For a circle, any point outside the circle lies on exactly two tangent lines, and points inside lie on no tangent lines. Therefore, if the envelope is a circle, then the region Ω, which is the set of points not on any line EF, would be the interior of the envelope circle. Therefore, the area of Ω is the area inside the envelope circle, which is π(r²)² = πr^4. However, the problem says &quot;the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. But we need to check if that&#39;s correct.Wait, the envelope circle has radius r², centered at (0, (1 - 2r²)/2). Therefore, the area of Ω is π(r²)^2 = πr^4? Wait, but the envelope circle is the set of points where the lines EF are tangent to it. So the lines EF are the tangent lines to this envelope circle. Then, the region Ω, being all points not on any EF line, would be the interior of the envelope circle, since tangent lines touch the envelope circle, and points inside the envelope circle are not on any tangent line. Therefore, the area of Ω is the area of the envelope circle, which is π(r²)^2 = πr⁴. But wait, the envelope circle has radius r², so area π(r²)² = πr⁴. But the problem states that r &gt; 0 and we have the condition r &lt; 1/2. Therefore, the area of Ω is πr⁴, and since r can vary between 0 and 1/2, the range of the area would be from 0 to π(1/2)^4 = π/16. Therefore, the area of Ω is in (0, π/16). But the problem asks for the range of the area of region Ω. So the answer would be (0, π/16).But wait, let me confirm again.The envelope of the polar lines EF is a circle with radius r² and center at (0, (1 - 2r²)/2). The region Ω is the set of points not lying on any EF line, which corresponds to the interior of the envelope circle. Therefore, the area of Ω is π(r²)^2 = πr⁴.Given that r is in (0, 1/2), the area πr⁴ ranges from 0 (when r approaches 0) to π*(1/2)^4 = π/16 (when r approaches 1/2). Therefore, the range of the area is (0, π/16).But the problem says &quot;the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. So the area can be any value between 0 and π/16, not including the endpoints because r is strictly between 0 and 1/2. However, maybe the endpoints are included when r approaches 0 or 1/2. But since r &gt; 0 and r &lt; 1/2, the area is strictly between 0 and π/16.Therefore, the final answer is that the area of Ω is in the interval (0, π/16), so the range is 0 &lt; area &lt; π/16.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says &quot;find the range of the area of region Ω&quot;. So depending on the value of r (which is given as r &gt; 0 and such that the circle and parabola have no common points, i.e., r &lt; 1/2), the area of Ω is πr⁴, which as r varies in (0, 1/2), πr⁴ varies in (0, π/16). Therefore, the range is (0, π/16).Therefore, the answer should be boxed{left(0, dfrac{pi}{16}right)}.But let me double-check the envelope derivation.We had the family of lines:(y - 1/2)(x₀² - 1) + 2x x₀ - 2r² = 0With x₀ as a parameter.We found the envelope by solving F(x,y,x₀) = 0 and dF/dx₀ = 0, leading to the circle equation x² + [y + (2r² -1)/2]^2 = r^4.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the envelope is a circle with radius r², centered at (0, (1 - 2r²)/2). The region Ω is the interior of this circle, hence area πr⁴. Since r ∈ (0, 1/2), area ∈ (0, π/16).Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be (0, π/16), boxed as requested.Final AnswerThe range of the area of region Ω is boxed{left(0, dfrac{pi}{16}right)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the parabola ( C: y = frac{1}{2}x^2 ) and the circle ( D: x^2 + left(y - frac{1}{2}right)^2 = r^2 ) (with ( r &gt; 0 )) having no common points, we need to find the range of the area of the region ( Omega ) formed by all points not on the line ( EF ) when a tangent line is drawn from a point ( A ) on the parabola ( C ) to the circle ( D ).1. Condition for No Common Points:   - Substituting ( y = frac{1}{2}x^2 ) into the circle equation, we find that the circle and parabola do not intersect when ( r &lt; frac{1}{2} ).2. Polar Line Equation:   - For a point ( A = (x_0, frac{1}{2}x_0^2) ) on the parabola, the polar line (line ( EF )) with respect to the circle ( D ) is given by:     [     x x_0 + (y - frac{1}{2})left(frac{1}{2}x_0^2 - frac{1}{2}right) = r^2     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     (y - frac{1}{2})(x_0^2 - 1) + 2x x_0 - 2r^2 = 0     ]3. Envelope of Polar Lines:   - The envelope of these polar lines is found by solving the system of equations ( F(x, y, x_0) = 0 ) and ( frac{dF}{dx_0} = 0 ). This results in the circle:     [     x^2 + left(y + frac{2r^2 - 1}{2}right)^2 = r^4     ]   - This circle has center ( left(0, frac{1 - 2r^2}{2}right) ) and radius ( r^2 ).4. Area of Region ( Omega ):   - The region ( Omega ) is the interior of this envelope circle. The area of ( Omega ) is the area of the circle, which is ( pi (r^2)^2 = pi r^4 ).   - Given ( r ) must be in the interval ( (0, frac{1}{2}) ), the area ( pi r^4 ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( pi left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 = frac{pi}{16} ).Thus, the range of the area of region ( Omega ) is boxed{left(0, dfrac{pi}{16}right)}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf74bc24></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf74bc24><span class="icon" data-v-cf74bc24>🔑:</span>10.

Hmm, let&#39;s see. This seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe I can use methods from calculus, like Lagrange multipliers, or perhaps inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM. Let me think through both approaches.First, let me recall the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. That might be helpful here because the equation includes terms like ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{9}{b} ), which could be paired with ( a ) and ( b ) respectively for applying AM-GM.Looking at ( a ) and ( frac{1}{a} ), if I apply AM-GM to these two terms:[frac{a + frac{1}{a}}{2} geq sqrt{a cdot frac{1}{a}} = 1]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:[a + frac{1}{a} geq 2]Similarly, applying AM-GM to ( b ) and ( frac{9}{b} ):[frac{b + frac{9}{b}}{2} geq sqrt{b cdot frac{9}{b}} = sqrt{9} = 3]Multiplying by 2:[b + frac{9}{b} geq 6]So adding these two inequalities together:[a + frac{1}{a} + b + frac{9}{b} geq 2 + 6 = 8]But the given equation is ( a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 ), which is greater than 8. So equality in AM-GM is not achieved here, which means that the minimal values of ( a + frac{1}{a} ) and ( b + frac{9}{b} ) aren&#39;t both achieved simultaneously. So maybe this approach gives a lower bound for ( a + b ), but how?Wait, actually, the sum ( a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 ). If I denote ( S = a + b ), then the equation becomes ( S + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 ). So ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 - S ). So perhaps I can express ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} ) in terms of ( S ), and then use some inequality to relate this to ( S ).Alternatively, maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let&#39;s set up the Lagrangian. Let me define variables. Let ( x = a ), ( y = b ). Then the constraint is ( x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 10 ), and we need to find the extrema of ( f(x, y) = x + y ).So the Lagrangian is:[mathcal{L}(x, y, lambda) = x + y - lambda left( x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} - 10 right)]Wait, actually, since we want to maximize or minimize ( f(x, y) = x + y ) subject to the constraint ( g(x, y) = x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} - 10 = 0 ). So the Lagrangian is:[mathcal{L}(x, y, lambda) = x + y - lambda left( x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} - 10 right)]But perhaps more straightforwardly, taking partial derivatives:Compute the partial derivatives of ( mathcal{L} ) with respect to x, y, and λ, set them to zero.First, partial derivative with respect to x:[frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial x} = 1 - lambda left( 1 - frac{1}{x^2} right) = 0]Similarly, partial derivative with respect to y:[frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial y} = 1 - lambda left( 1 - frac{9}{y^2} right) = 0]Partial derivative with respect to λ:[frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = -left( x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} - 10 right) = 0]So from the first equation:[1 = lambda left( 1 - frac{1}{x^2} right)]From the second equation:[1 = lambda left( 1 - frac{9}{y^2} right)]Therefore, we can set the two expressions for λ equal to each other:[frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{x^2}} = frac{1}{1 - frac{9}{y^2}}]So:[1 - frac{1}{x^2} = 1 - frac{9}{y^2}]Simplifying:[frac{1}{x^2} = frac{9}{y^2}]Therefore:[frac{y}{x} = 3 implies y = 3x]So, we have a relationship between y and x: y = 3x.Now, substitute y = 3x into the constraint equation:Original constraint: ( x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 10 )Substitute y = 3x:[x + 3x + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{3x} = 10]Simplify:[4x + frac{1}{x} + frac{3}{x} = 10]Combine terms:[4x + frac{4}{x} = 10]Multiply both sides by x (since x &gt; 0):[4x^2 + 4 = 10x]Bring all terms to one side:[4x^2 - 10x + 4 = 0]Divide equation by 2:[2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0]Solve the quadratic equation:Discriminant ( D = (-5)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 2 = 25 - 16 = 9 )Roots:[x = frac{5 pm sqrt{9}}{4} = frac{5 pm 3}{4}]So:( x = frac{5 + 3}{4} = 2 ) or ( x = frac{5 - 3}{4} = frac{1}{2} )Therefore, x = 2 or x = 1/2. Then, since y = 3x, the corresponding y values are y = 6 or y = 3/2.Therefore, the critical points are (2, 6) and (1/2, 3/2).Now, compute ( a + b ) at these points.For (2, 6): ( a + b = 2 + 6 = 8 )For (1/2, 3/2): ( a + b = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2 )Therefore, according to this, the possible values for ( a + b ) are 8 and 2, but these are critical points. We need to check if these are maxima or minima.Wait, but since the problem is to find the range, i.e., the minimum and maximum possible values of ( a + b ), these critical points might be the extrema.But we need to verify if these are indeed the minima and maxima.Alternatively, let&#39;s check the second derivative or use the bordered Hessian to confirm the nature of the critical points. But maybe in this case, given that the function is smooth and the constraint is convex or not, it might be easier to see by testing.Alternatively, note that when we applied AM-GM earlier, we saw that the minimal total sum would be 8, but in our problem, the total sum is fixed at 10. However, this might not directly relate to the minimal or maximal values of ( a + b ). Wait, actually, when we applied AM-GM to a and 1/a, we found that a + 1/a &gt;= 2, and similarly for b + 9/b &gt;= 6. So total sum is &gt;= 8, which matches the given equation sum of 10. So perhaps, the minimal value of a + b is when the other terms (1/a + 9/b) are maximized? Hmm.Wait, in the problem statement, a and b are positive numbers. The equation is a + b + 1/a + 9/b = 10. We need to find the possible values of a + b. So if a + b can vary, but 1/a + 9/b will vary inversely. If a + b is minimized, then 1/a + 9/b must be maximized, and vice versa. So we need to find the minimum and maximum of a + b given the constraint.We found two critical points with a + b equal to 2 and 8. But which is the minimum and which is the maximum?Let me check the second derivative test or see the behavior.Alternatively, perhaps test around those points.Take the critical point (2, 6): a + b = 8. Let&#39;s check if this is a minimum or maximum.Suppose we take a slightly larger a and slightly larger b. For example, a = 3, then 1/a = 1/3. Let&#39;s see what b would have to be. If a increases, then 1/a decreases, so 9/b would have to compensate to keep the sum at 10.Wait, but this approach might not be straightforward.Alternatively, consider the Hessian matrix for the Lagrangian. The bordered Hessian can help determine if the critical points are maxima or minima.But perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, since we found two critical points, and the problem is likely set up such that these are the only extrema, so 2 and 8 would be the minimum and maximum.But to confirm, let&#39;s analyze.Suppose we take a very small a approaching 0. Then 1/a approaches infinity, which would make the left-hand side of the equation exceed 10. Similarly, if a is very large, then 1/a approaches 0, but a itself would be large, which would also make the sum a + b + ... exceed 10 unless b and the other terms are adjusted. Similarly for b approaching 0 or infinity.Therefore, the values of a and b can&#39;t be too small or too large; they are constrained. So the extrema found via Lagrange multipliers are likely the global minima and maxima.At (1/2, 3/2), a + b = 2. Let&#39;s check if this satisfies the original equation:a + b + 1/a + 9/b = 1/2 + 3/2 + 1/(1/2) + 9/(3/2) = (2) + 2 + 6 = 10. Correct.Similarly, (2, 6): 2 + 6 + 1/2 + 9/6 = 8 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 10. Correct.Now, to determine which is the minimum and which is the maximum. Let&#39;s think: when a and b are smaller, 1/a and 9/b are larger. So if a + b is smaller, the terms 1/a + 9/b must be larger to compensate. So the minimal value of a + b corresponds to the maximal value of 1/a + 9/b. Conversely, the maximal value of a + b corresponds to the minimal value of 1/a + 9/b.But earlier, we saw via AM-GM that a + 1/a &gt;= 2 and b + 9/b &gt;= 6. Therefore, 1/a + 9/b &gt;= 8 - (a + b). Wait, actually, in the original equation, a + b + 1/a + 9/b = 10. So 1/a + 9/b = 10 - (a + b). Therefore, the sum 1/a + 9/b is equal to 10 - S, where S = a + b. So if S is minimized, then 10 - S is maximized, and vice versa. Therefore, to find the range of S, we need to find the possible S such that 1/a + 9/b = 10 - S, given a and b positive.But how can we relate S and 1/a + 9/b? Maybe use Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder&#39;s inequality?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider variables x = a and y = b. Then, we have x + y + 1/x + 9/y = 10. Let S = x + y, then 1/x + 9/y = 10 - S. We need to find the possible values of S.We can consider the problem as: for given S, is there a solution (x, y) with x, y &gt; 0 such that x + y = S and 1/x + 9/y = 10 - S?So, given x + y = S, and 1/x + 9/y = 10 - S, with x, y &gt; 0.Let me express y = S - x. Then substitute into the second equation:1/x + 9/(S - x) = 10 - S.So for given S, the equation is:1/x + 9/(S - x) = 10 - S.We can analyze for which S this equation has a solution x in (0, S).Let me consider this function f(x) = 1/x + 9/(S - x). We can find its minimum and see if 10 - S is attainable.Compute the derivative of f(x):f&#39;(x) = -1/x² + 9/(S - x)².Set derivative to zero:-1/x² + 9/(S - x)² = 0So 9/(S - x)² = 1/x²Take square roots:3/(S - x) = 1/xWhich gives:3x = S - xSo 4x = S =&gt; x = S/4Then y = S - x = 3S/4Therefore, the minimum of f(x) occurs at x = S/4, y = 3S/4.Compute f(S/4):1/(S/4) + 9/(3S/4) = 4/S + (9 * 4)/(3S) = 4/S + 12/S = 16/SSo the minimal value of f(x) = 16/S.Therefore, for the equation f(x) = 10 - S to have a solution, we must have 10 - S &gt;= 16/S.So:10 - S &gt;= 16/SMultiply both sides by S (since S &gt; 0):10S - S² &gt;= 16Rearranged:-S² + 10S - 16 &gt;= 0Multiply by -1 (reverse inequality):S² - 10S + 16 &lt;= 0Find the roots of S² -10S +16=0:Discriminant D = 100 - 64 = 36Roots:S = [10 ± 6]/2 = (16)/2 = 8 or (4)/2 = 2Therefore, the quadratic is &lt;= 0 between S=2 and S=8.Hence, 10 - S &gt;= 16/S if and only if 2 &lt;= S &lt;=8.But since S must also satisfy that when we set x = S/4, y = 3S/4, which are positive as long as S &gt;0, which is already given.But also, the original equation must have real solutions. So, if 2 &lt;= S &lt;=8, then there exist x and y such that x + y = S and 1/x + 9/y = 10 - S. Therefore, the possible values of S = a + b are between 2 and 8.But wait, when S=2, the minimal value of f(x) is 16/S = 8, and 10 - S = 8, so equality holds. Similarly, when S=8, 16/S=2, and 10 - S=2, equality holds. Therefore, the minimal and maximal possible values of S are 2 and 8.Therefore, the range of a + b is [2, 8].But wait, but in the Lagrange multiplier method, we found critical points at S=2 and S=8, which suggests that these are the minimal and maximal values.Therefore, the answer is that the range of a + b is from 2 to 8, inclusive.Wait, but let me verify with an example. Suppose S=2, then a + b =2. Then 1/a +9/b=8. If a=1/2, b=3/2, then 1/a=2, 9/b=6, so 2+6=8. Correct.If S=8, then a=2, b=6, 1/a +9/b=0.5 +1.5=2=10 -8=2. Correct.If we take S=5, which is in between, then 10 - S=5. So 1/a +9/b=5. Let&#39;s see if such a and b exist. Let&#39;s take x=1, then y=4. Then 1/1 +9/4=1 +2.25=3.25 &lt;5. So need higher values. Maybe x=0.5, y=4.5. Then 1/0.5 +9/4.5=2 +2=4 &lt;5. Still too low. Maybe x=0.25, y=4.75. Then 1/0.25 +9/4.75=4 + 1.894≈5.894&gt;5. So there must be a solution between x=0.25 and x=0.5. Let me solve 1/x +9/(5 -x)=5. Let’s set x=0.4, y=4.6: 1/0.4=2.5, 9/4.6≈1.956, total≈4.456 &lt;5. x=0.3, y=4.7: 1/0.3≈3.333, 9/4.7≈1.915, total≈5.248&gt;5. So by intermediate value theorem, there is a solution between x=0.3 and x=0.4. Therefore, such a and b exist for S=5, so S=5 is attainable. Hence, all values between 2 and 8 are possible.Therefore, the range is [2,8].Final AnswerThe range of values for ( a + b ) is (boxed{[2, 8]}).&lt;/think&gt;Given positive numbers (a) and (b) that satisfy the equation (a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10), we need to determine the range of values for (a + b).First, we apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms (a + frac{1}{a}) and (b + frac{9}{b}):[a + frac{1}{a} geq 2 quad text{and} quad b + frac{9}{b} geq 6]Adding these inequalities gives:[a + frac{1}{a} + b + frac{9}{b} geq 8]Since the given equation is (a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10), which is greater than 8, we need to find the extrema of (a + b) under the given constraint. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we set up the Lagrangian:[mathcal{L}(x, y, lambda) = x + y - lambda left( x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} - 10 right)]Solving the partial derivatives, we find the critical points by setting (y = 3x). Substituting (y = 3x) into the constraint equation:[4x + frac{4}{x} = 10]Solving the quadratic equation (4x^2 - 10x + 4 = 0), we find (x = 2) or (x = frac{1}{2}), leading to (y = 6) or (y = frac{3}{2}). Thus, the critical points are ((2, 6)) and ((frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{2})), giving (a + b = 8) and (a + b = 2) respectively.To confirm these are the extrema, we analyze the function (f(x) = frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{S - x}) for (x + y = S). The minimum value of (f(x)) is found to be (frac{16}{S}). Solving (10 - S geq frac{16}{S}) gives the quadratic inequality (S^2 - 10S + 16 leq 0), leading to roots (S = 2) and (S = 8). Thus, the range of (a + b) is ([2, 8]).[boxed{[2, 8]}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is asking for the range of values for ( a + b ) given that ( a ) and ( b ) are positive numbers satisfying ( a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 ). Hmm, so I need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of ( a + b ) under this constraint. First, since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, maybe I can use some inequalities here, like the AM-GM inequality. But I need to be careful because the equation has both ( a ) and ( b ) terms and their reciprocals multiplied by constants. Let me write down the equation again:( a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 ).So, the variables ( a ) and ( b ) are in both linear and reciprocal terms. The goal is to find the range of ( a + b ). Let me denote ( S = a + b ). Then, the equation becomes:( S + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 ).So, ( S = 10 - left( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} right) ). Therefore, to find the range of ( S ), I need to find the possible values of ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} ), which in turn would depend on ( a ) and ( b ). Alternatively, since ( S = a + b ), perhaps I can relate ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} ) to ( S ) using some inequality. For example, using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM-HM inequality. Let me explore that.Let me consider the terms ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{9}{b} ). Maybe I can combine them in a way that relates to ( a + b ). Let&#39;s think about Cauchy-Schwarz. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for positive real numbers, ( (x_1y_1 + x_2y_2)^2 leq (x_1^2 + x_2^2)(y_1^2 + y_2^2) ). But I&#39;m not sure how to apply this here.Alternatively, maybe use the AM-GM inequality on the terms ( a ) and ( frac{1}{a} ), and similarly ( b ) and ( frac{9}{b} ). Let&#39;s try that.For the terms involving ( a ), we have ( a + frac{1}{a} ). By AM-GM, ( a + frac{1}{a} geq 2 sqrt{a cdot frac{1}{a}} = 2 ). Similarly, for ( b + frac{9}{b} ), by AM-GM, ( b + frac{9}{b} geq 2 sqrt{b cdot frac{9}{b}} = 2 times 3 = 6 ). So, adding these two inequalities together, we get ( a + frac{1}{a} + b + frac{9}{b} geq 2 + 6 = 8 ). But the given equation is that this sum equals 10, which is greater than 8. So, the equality case in AM-GM isn&#39;t achieved here, which would require ( a = frac{1}{a} ) and ( b = frac{9}{b} ), meaning ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 3 ). Let me check what happens if ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 3 ):( 1 + 3 + frac{1}{1} + frac{9}{3} = 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 8 ), which is less than 10. So, in order to reach 10, we need to adjust ( a ) and ( b ) such that their individual sums with their reciprocals (times constants) give a larger total. This suggests that when ( a ) is greater than 1, ( frac{1}{a} ) decreases, but ( a ) increases, so maybe there&#39;s a balance there. Similarly, if ( a ) is less than 1, ( frac{1}{a} ) increases, but ( a ) decreases. The same applies to ( b ) and ( frac{9}{b} ). So, perhaps there&#39;s a trade-off between the linear terms and their reciprocals.Since the problem is to find the range of ( a + b ), maybe we can use substitution. Let me denote ( x = a ) and ( y = b ), so the equation becomes ( x + y + frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 10 ), and we want to find the range of ( x + y ).Alternatively, set ( S = x + y ), and ( T = frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} ). Then, the equation is ( S + T = 10 ). So, we need to relate ( S ) and ( T ). Maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on ( T ):( left( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} right)(x + y) geq (1 + 3)^2 = 16 ). This is because Cauchy-Schwarz says ( (frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y})(x + y) geq (sqrt{frac{1}{x} cdot x} + sqrt{frac{9}{y} cdot y})^2 = (1 + 3)^2 = 16 ).So, ( T cdot S geq 16 ). Since ( T = 10 - S ), substituting in, we get:( (10 - S) cdot S geq 16 )Which simplifies to:( 10S - S^2 geq 16 )Rearranging terms:( -S^2 + 10S - 16 geq 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):( S^2 - 10S + 16 leq 0 )Solving the quadratic inequality ( S^2 - 10S + 16 leq 0 ):First, find the roots of the equation ( S^2 - 10S + 16 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula:( S = frac{10 pm sqrt{100 - 64}}{2} = frac{10 pm sqrt{36}}{2} = frac{10 pm 6}{2} ).So, ( S = frac{10 + 6}{2} = 8 ) and ( S = frac{10 - 6}{2} = 2 ).Thus, the quadratic is less than or equal to zero between its roots, so ( 2 leq S leq 8 ).But wait, this suggests that ( a + b ) is between 2 and 8. But we need to verify if these bounds are achievable. Because the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives a necessary condition but not necessarily sufficient. So, we need to check if there exist ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( S = 2 ) and ( S = 8 ) while satisfying the original equation.First, check ( S = 2 ). If ( S = 2 ), then ( T = 10 - 2 = 8 ). So, we need ( a + b = 2 ) and ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 8 ). Let&#39;s see if such ( a ) and ( b ) exist.Let me set ( a + b = 2 ). Let ( b = 2 - a ). Then, substituting into ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 8 ):( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{2 - a} = 8 ).Multiply both sides by ( a(2 - a) ):( (2 - a) + 9a = 8a(2 - a) ).Simplify left side:( 2 - a + 9a = 2 + 8a ).Right side:( 8a(2 - a) = 16a - 8a^2 ).So, equation becomes:( 2 + 8a = 16a - 8a^2 ).Bring all terms to one side:( 8a^2 - 8a + 2 = 0 ).Divide equation by 2:( 4a^2 - 4a + 1 = 0 ).This quadratic equation has discriminant:( D = (-4)^2 - 4 times 4 times 1 = 16 - 16 = 0 ).So, there is one real root:( a = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2} ).Therefore, ( a = frac{1}{2} ), then ( b = 2 - frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2} ).Check if these values satisfy the original equation:( a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{2} + 2 + frac{9}{frac{3}{2}} = 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 ). Yes, it does. So, ( S = 2 ) is achievable.Now check ( S = 8 ). Then, ( T = 10 - 8 = 2 ). So, ( a + b = 8 ) and ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 2 ).Again, let me set ( b = 8 - a ), substitute into ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{8 - a} = 2 ).Multiply both sides by ( a(8 - a) ):( (8 - a) + 9a = 2a(8 - a) ).Left side:( 8 - a + 9a = 8 + 8a ).Right side:( 16a - 2a^2 ).Equation:( 8 + 8a = 16a - 2a^2 ).Bring all terms to left side:( 2a^2 - 8a + 8 = 0 ).Divide by 2:( a^2 - 4a + 4 = 0 ).Factor:( (a - 2)^2 = 0 ).Thus, ( a = 2 ), so ( b = 8 - 2 = 6 ).Check in original equation:( 2 + 6 + frac{1}{2} + frac{9}{6} = 8 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 10 ). Correct. So, ( S = 8 ) is also achievable.Therefore, the range of ( a + b ) is from 2 to 8. So, the answer is ( [2, 8] ). Wait, but let me just verify once more.We used the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to get ( (10 - S)S geq 16 ), leading to ( S^2 - 10S + 16 leq 0 ), which gave ( 2 leq S leq 8 ). Then, by checking the endpoints, both are achievable. Therefore, the range is indeed all real numbers from 2 to 8 inclusive.But just to be thorough, suppose we have another case where ( S ) is between 2 and 8. Let me pick a value in between, say ( S = 5 ). Then ( T = 5 ). So, ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 5 ), and ( a + b = 5 ). Let&#39;s see if such ( a ) and ( b ) exist.Set ( b = 5 - a ). Then, ( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{5 - a} = 5 ).Multiply both sides by ( a(5 - a) ):( 5 - a + 9a = 5a(5 - a) )Simplify left side:( 5 + 8a )Right side:( 25a - 5a^2 )Equation becomes:( 5 + 8a = 25a - 5a^2 )Bring all terms to left:( 5a^2 - 17a + 5 = 0 )Discriminant:( D = (-17)^2 - 4 times 5 times 5 = 289 - 100 = 189 )Which is positive, so there are two real roots. So, solutions exist. Hence, there are values of ( a ) and ( b ) that give ( S = 5 ). Therefore, indeed, all values between 2 and 8 are achievable.Thus, the range of ( a + b ) is ( [2, 8] ).Final AnswerThe range of values for ( a + b ) is boxed{[2, 8]}.&lt;/think&gt;Given positive numbers (a) and (b) that satisfy the equation (a + b + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10), we need to determine the range of values for (a + b).First, we denote (S = a + b) and rewrite the given equation as:[S + frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10]which implies:[frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 10 - S]Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the terms (frac{1}{a}) and (frac{9}{b}), we have:[left( frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} right)(a + b) geq (1 + 3)^2 = 16]Substituting (S) and (10 - S) into the inequality, we get:[(10 - S)S geq 16]This simplifies to the quadratic inequality:[S^2 - 10S + 16 leq 0]Solving the quadratic equation (S^2 - 10S + 16 = 0) using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:[S = frac{10 pm sqrt{36}}{2} = frac{10 pm 6}{2}]which gives (S = 8) and (S = 2). The quadratic inequality (S^2 - 10S + 16 leq 0) holds for (2 leq S leq 8).To verify if these bounds are achievable:- For (S = 2), we solve (frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 8) with (a + b = 2). This gives (a = frac{1}{2}) and (b = frac{3}{2}), which satisfy the original equation.- For (S = 8), we solve (frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = 2) with (a + b = 8). This gives (a = 2) and (b = 6), which also satisfy the original equation.Thus, the range of values for (a + b) is (boxed{[2, 8]}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf74bc24></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf74bc24><span class="icon" data-v-cf74bc24>🔑:</span>Since a+b+frac{1}{a}+frac{9}{b}=10,Multiply both sides by (a+b), we get(a+b)(a+b+frac{1}{a}+frac{9}{b})=10(a+b),Expanding the left side, we have(a+b)^2+frac{a+b}{a}+frac{9(a+b)}{b}=(a+b)^2+10+frac{b}{a}+frac{9a}{b},Applying the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality, we have(a+b)^2+10+2sqrt{frac{b}{a}timesfrac{9a}{b}}leq 10(a+b),Simplifying, we obtain(a+b)^2-10(a+b)+8leq 0,Solving the quadratic inequality, we get2leq a+bleq 8.Thus, the range of values for a+b is boxed{[2,8]}.This problem mainly tests the application of basic inequalities, with a focus on technique.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-edca29a5 data-v-cf74bc24><div class="review" data-v-cf74bc24><div class="review-title" data-v-cf74bc24><span class="icon" data-v-cf74bc24>❓:</span>Consider the sum S =sum^{2021}_{j=1} left|sin frac{2pi j}{2021}right|.The value of S can be written as tan left( frac{cpi}{d} right) for some relatively prime positive integers c, d, satisfying 2c &lt; d.

The problem is asking for this sum to be written in terms of a tangent function with some fraction multiplied by pi, and then find c + d where c and d are coprime positive integers with 2c &lt; d. First, let me understand the problem better. The sum S is from j = 1 to 2021 of |sin(2πj/2021)|. So, that&#39;s summing the absolute sine values at 2021 equally spaced points around the unit circle. Since sine is positive in the first and second quadrants and negative in the third and fourth, taking the absolute value would make all terms positive. So effectively, we&#39;re adding up the sine of angles that go around the circle once, divided into 2021 equal parts. But 2021 is a large number. Wait, 2021 divided by 2 is 1010.5, so 2021 is an odd number. That might be important because if it were even, there would be a point at π where sin is zero, but since it&#39;s odd, all the terms except maybe j=0 or j=2021 would be non-zero. But since we start at j=1, we don&#39;t include j=0. But sin(2πj/2021) for j=1 to 2021 would cover all the points around the circle once. But since sine is periodic with period 2π, each term is sin(theta_j) where theta_j increases by 2π/2021 each time.But since we take absolute value, maybe the sum can be simplified by considering symmetry. For example, in the unit circle, the sine function is symmetric about the y-axis. So, if we can pair terms symmetrically around the y-axis, their absolute sine values would be equal. Similarly, since we&#39;re dealing with absolute values, maybe the sum can be expressed as a multiple of the sum over a quarter of the circle or something like that.Wait, let&#39;s consider that the points theta_j = 2πj/2021 for j from 1 to 2021 are equally spaced around the circle. The absolute sine function has a period of π, so |sin(theta)| has period π. But theta here is 2πj/2021, so the step between each theta_j is 2π/2021. Therefore, over 2021 terms, the angle goes from 2π/2021 up to 2π*2021/2021 = 2π. But since |sin(theta)| is symmetric every π, maybe we can split the sum into two parts: from theta = 0 to pi, and theta = pi to 2pi. But in our case, the sum starts at j=1, so theta starts just above 0. The last term is theta = 2pi, but sin(2pi) is zero, so the last term is zero. Wait, but when j=2021, theta = 2pi*2021/2021 = 2pi, so sin(2pi) is zero. So actually, the sum S is from j=1 to 2021 of |sin(2πj/2021)|. But when j=2021, that term is zero, so effectively, the sum is from j=1 to 2020 of |sin(2πj/2021)|. But since the problem says up to 2021, maybe they include j=2021, which is zero. So maybe that term can be ignored since it&#39;s zero. So maybe S is equal to the sum from j=1 to 2020 of |sin(2πj/2021)|.But regardless, since the sine function is symmetric, maybe I can rewrite this sum as twice the sum from j=1 to 1010 of |sin(2πj/2021)|, because from j=1 to 1010, the angles go from just above 0 to just below pi, and then from j=1011 to 2020, the angles go from just above pi to just below 2pi, and the absolute values would mirror the first half. However, since 2021 is odd, 2021 = 2*1010 + 1, so the middle term is j=1011, which corresponds to theta = 2π*1011/2021. Let&#39;s calculate that angle: 2π*1011/2021. Since 1011 is approximately half of 2021, which is 1010.5, so 1011 is 0.5 more than 1010.5. So theta would be pi + π/2021. So sin(theta) for theta = pi + x is -sin(x). Therefore, |sin(theta)| = |sin(pi + x)| = | - sin x | = |sin x|. So that middle term at j=1011 is |sin(pi + π/2021)| = |sin(π/2021)|. So the sum S can be written as twice the sum from j=1 to 1010 of |sin(2πj/2021)| plus the middle term |sin(π + π/2021)| = |sin(π/2021)|. But since 2*1010 +1 = 2021, so j=1 to 1010, then j=1011, then j=1012 to 2021. But since the sum from j=1012 to 2021 would correspond to angles from pi + π/2021 up to 2pi - π/2021, which would be symmetric to the angles from pi - π/2021 down to 0 + π/2021. But since we take absolute values, those terms would mirror the terms from j=1 to 1010. Therefore, the sum S can be written as 2 times the sum from j=1 to 1010 of |sin(2πj/2021)| plus the middle term |sin(π + π/2021)| = |sin(π/2021)|. But since the middle term is |sin(π/2021)|, which is the same as the term at j=1010 +1? Wait, j=1011 corresponds to theta=2π*1011/2021=2pi*(1010 +1)/2021=2pi*1010/2021 + 2pi/2021=pi + pi/2021. So yes, that&#39;s correct.But since we can split the sum into two halves and the middle term. So S = 2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} |sin(2πj/2021)| + |sin(π/2021)|. But since in each half, from j=1 to 1010, theta goes from 2pi/2021 up to 2pi*1010/2021. Let&#39;s compute 2pi*1010/2021: 2pi*(1010)/2021 = 2pi*(1010)/2021. Since 2021 = 2*1010 +1, so 1010 = (2021 -1)/2. Therefore, 2pi*((2021 -1)/2)/2021 = pi*(2021 -1)/2021 = pi - pi/2021. So theta_j for j=1 to 1010 is from 2pi/2021 up to pi - pi/2021. Therefore, all these angles are in the first and second quadrants where sin(theta) is positive, so |sin(theta)| = sin(theta). Therefore, the sum from j=1 to 1010 is just sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021). Therefore, S = 2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021) + sin(pi/2021). Wait, but the middle term is |sin(pi + pi/2021)| = | - sin(pi/2021) | = sin(pi/2021). So indeed, S is equal to twice the sum from j=1 to 1010 of sin(2pi j /2021) plus sin(pi/2021). But perhaps we can combine these terms. Let me think. If we consider the sum from j=1 to 1010 of sin(2pi j /2021), which is a sum of sines of angles increasing by 2pi/2021 each time. Then, there is a formula for the sum of sine terms in an arithmetic progression. The formula for the sum_{k=1}^{n} sin(kθ) is [sin(nθ/2) * sin((n + 1)θ/2)] / sin(θ/2). Let me verify that. Yes, the formula for the sum of sines: sum_{k=1}^n sin(kθ) = [sin(nθ/2) * sin((n +1)θ/2)] / sin(θ/2). So in our case, the sum from j=1 to 1010 of sin(2pi j /2021). Let me set θ = 2pi/2021, and n = 1010. Then the sum is [sin(nθ/2) * sin((n +1)θ/2)] / sin(θ/2). Let&#39;s compute that.First, nθ/2 = 1010*(2pi/2021)/2 = 1010*pi/2021. Similarly, (n +1)θ/2 = (1010 +1)*2pi/2021 /2 = 1011*pi/2021. So the sum is [sin(1010pi/2021) * sin(1011pi/2021)] / sin(pi/2021).But note that 1010pi/2021 = pi - 1011pi/2021, because 1010 +1011 = 2021. Therefore, sin(1010pi/2021) = sin(pi - 1011pi/2021) = sin(1011pi/2021). So both terms in the numerator are sin(1011pi/2021). Therefore, the numerator becomes [sin(1011pi/2021)]^2. Therefore, the sum is [sin^2(1011pi/2021)] / sin(pi/2021). But 1011pi/2021 = pi/2 + (1011pi/2021 - pi/2). Let&#39;s compute 1011pi/2021: since 2021 = 2*1010 +1, 1011 is (2021 +1)/2. Therefore, 1011pi/2021 = pi*(2021 +1)/2*2021 = pi/2*(1 + 1/2021). Therefore, sin(1011pi/2021) = sin(pi/2 + pi/(2*2021)) = cos(pi/(2*2021)). Because sin(pi/2 + x) = cos(x). So sin(1011pi/2021) = cos(pi/(2*2021)). Therefore, the numerator becomes [cos(pi/(2*2021))]^2. Therefore, the sum from j=1 to 1010 of sin(2pi j /2021) is [cos^2(pi/(2*2021))]/sin(pi/2021). So substituting back into S:S = 2*[cos^2(pi/(2*2021))/sin(pi/2021)] + sin(pi/2021).Let me compute that. First, factor sin(pi/2021) in the denominator:First, note that cos(pi/(2*2021)) is cos(x), where x = pi/(2*2021). So cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2. Therefore, cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(pi/2021))/2. Therefore, the numerator becomes [1 + cos(pi/2021)]/2. Therefore, the sum from j=1 to 1010 is [ (1 + cos(pi/2021))/2 ] / sin(pi/2021). So that is (1 + cos(pi/2021))/(2 sin(pi/2021)).Therefore, S = 2 * [ (1 + cos(pi/2021))/(2 sin(pi/2021)) ] + sin(pi/2021) = [ (1 + cos(pi/2021)) / sin(pi/2021) ] + sin(pi/2021).Combine the terms:First term: (1 + cos(pi/2021))/sin(pi/2021)Second term: sin(pi/2021)To combine them, get a common denominator:= [ (1 + cos(pi/2021)) + sin^2(pi/2021) ] / sin(pi/2021)But let&#39;s compute numerator:1 + cos(pi/2021) + sin^2(pi/2021)But sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x), so:1 + cos(x) + 1 - cos^2(x) = 2 + cos(x) - cos^2(x)Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x). Therefore:Numerator = 1 + cos(x) + 1 - cos^2(x) = 2 + cos(x) - cos^2(x). But let&#39;s check:Wait, original numerator: 1 + cos(x) + sin^2(x). Since sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x), so substituting:1 + cos(x) + 1 - cos^2(x) = 2 + cos(x) - cos^2(x). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a better way.Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-express the numerator:Original expression: 1 + cos(pi/2021) + sin^2(pi/2021). Let&#39;s substitute sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x):So 1 + cos(x) + 1 - cos^2(x) = 2 + cos(x) - cos^2(x). Hmm, that&#39;s correct.But maybe instead of substituting, we can use another identity. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s better to not combine them yet and see another approach. Let&#39;s step back.We have S = [ (1 + cos(pi/2021)) / sin(pi/2021) ] + sin(pi/2021)Let me write this as:S = (1 + cos(pi/2021))/sin(pi/2021) + sin(pi/2021) = [1 + cos(pi/2021) + sin^2(pi/2021)] / sin(pi/2021)Wait, no. Wait, the first term is (1 + cos)/sin and the second term is sin. To add them, you need a common denominator:= (1 + cos)/sin + sin = [1 + cos + sin^2]/sinBut sin^2 = 1 - cos^2, so:= [1 + cos + 1 - cos^2]/sin = [2 + cos - cos^2]/sin.Alternatively, factor:2 + cos x - cos^2 x = -cos^2 x + cos x + 2. Maybe factor this quadratic in cos x:Let me set y = cos x, so expression becomes -y^2 + y + 2 = -(y^2 - y -2) = -(y - 2)(y +1). So factors to -(y -2)(y +1). Therefore, 2 + cos x - cos^2 x = - (cos x -2)(cos x +1). Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a better approach. Let me recall that (1 + cos x)/sin x = cot(x/2). Because 1 + cos x = 2 cos^2(x/2), and sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). Therefore, (1 + cos x)/sin x = (2 cos^2(x/2)) / (2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)) ) = cot(x/2). So indeed, (1 + cos x)/sin x = cot(x/2).Therefore, the first term is cot(pi/(2*2021)), since x = pi/2021. Then, the second term is sin(pi/2021). Therefore, S = cot(pi/(4042)) + sin(pi/2021).But how can we combine these terms? Let me compute cot(pi/(4042)) + sin(pi/2021). Hmm. Maybe we can express cot(pi/(4042)) in terms of tan, or use some trigonometric identities.Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake here. Let me double-check the steps.We started with S = sum_{j=1}^{2021} |sin(2pi j /2021)|. Then, since 2021 is odd, we split the sum into two halves plus the middle term. The two halves each have 1010 terms, and the middle term is j=1011, which gives sin(pi + pi/2021), absolute value is sin(pi/2021). Therefore, S = 2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021) + sin(pi/2021). Then, using the formula for the sum of sines in arithmetic progression, sum_{j=1}^n sin(jθ) = [sin(nθ/2) sin((n +1)θ/2)] / sin(θ/2). Here, n=1010, θ=2pi/2021. Then, the sum becomes [sin(1010*(2pi/2021)/2) * sin(1011*(2pi/2021)/2)] / sin(pi/2021). Which simplifies to [sin(1010pi/2021) * sin(1011pi/2021)] / sin(pi/2021). Then, since 1010pi/2021 = pi - 1011pi/2021, so sin(1010pi/2021) = sin(1011pi/2021). Therefore, numerator is sin^2(1011pi/2021). Then, 1011pi/2021 = pi/2 + pi/(2*2021), so sin(1011pi/2021) = cos(pi/(2*2021)). Therefore, numerator is cos^2(pi/(2*2021)), so the sum is cos^2(pi/(2*2021)) / sin(pi/2021). Therefore, S = 2*[cos^2(pi/(2*2021))/sin(pi/2021)] + sin(pi/2021). Then, using the identity cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2, we get:cos^2(pi/(2*2021)) = (1 + cos(pi/2021))/2. Therefore, the sum becomes 2*(1 + cos(pi/2021))/(2 sin(pi/2021)) + sin(pi/2021) = (1 + cos(pi/2021))/sin(pi/2021) + sin(pi/2021). Then, as I thought before, (1 + cos x)/sin x = cot(x/2). So here x = pi/2021, so cot(pi/(4042)). Then, S = cot(pi/4042) + sin(pi/2021). Hmm. Is there a way to express this combination as a tangent function?Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Let me recall that the sum of |sin(theta_j)| for equally spaced points around the circle. There might be a known formula for this. Alternatively, perhaps we can relate this to the imaginary parts of roots of unity.Consider that the points e^{2pi i j /2021} are the 2021st roots of unity. The imaginary parts of these roots are the sin(2pi j /2021). However, taking the absolute value complicates things, as it&#39;s not a linear operation. But maybe there&#39;s a trick here.Alternatively, perhaps considering the average value. But the problem states that the sum can be written as tan(c pi/d). So we need to manipulate S into a tangent function.Looking back at S = cot(pi/4042) + sin(pi/2021). Let me compute cot(pi/4042) + sin(pi/2021). Let&#39;s write cot(pi/4042) as 1/tan(pi/4042). So S = 1/tan(pi/4042) + sin(pi/2021). Maybe express both terms in terms of sin and cos:cot(pi/4042) = cos(pi/4042)/sin(pi/4042), and sin(pi/2021) = 2 sin(pi/(2*2021)) cos(pi/(2*2021)) by the double-angle formula. Wait, sin(2x) = 2 sinx cosx, so sin(pi/2021) = 2 sin(pi/(2*2021)) cos(pi/(2*2021)). Therefore, S = cos(pi/4042)/sin(pi/4042) + 2 sin(pi/(2*2021)) cos(pi/(2*2021)). But note that pi/4042 is the same as pi/(2*2021). Therefore, pi/4042 = pi/(2*2021). Therefore, sin(pi/4042) = sin(pi/(2*2021)) and cos(pi/4042) = cos(pi/(2*2021)). Therefore, S = cos(pi/(2*2021))/sin(pi/(2*2021)) + 2 sin(pi/(2*2021)) cos(pi/(2*2021)). Let me write that more clearly. Let x = pi/(2*2021). Then S = cot(x) + 2 sin x cos x. But cot(x) is cos x / sin x, and 2 sin x cos x is sin(2x). So S = cos x / sin x + sin(2x). Let&#39;s combine these terms:Express both terms over sin x:= cos x / sin x + sin(2x) * (sin x / sin x)Wait, no. To combine terms, let&#39;s write sin(2x) as 2 sin x cos x. So:S = (cos x)/sin x + 2 sin x cos x = [cos x + 2 sin^2 x cos x]/sin x. Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.S = cot x + sin(2x) = (cos x)/sin x + 2 sin x cos x. Factor out cos x / sin x:= (cos x / sin x)(1 + 2 sin^2 x). Hmm. Alternatively, factor cos x:= cos x [ 1/sin x + 2 sin x ] = cos x [ (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x ].But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let&#39;s compute sin(2x):sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x. So S = cot x + 2 sin x cos x = (cos x)/sin x + 2 sin x cos x. Let&#39;s combine the terms over sin x:= [cos x + 2 sin^2 x cos x]/sin x = cos x (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x. Hmm. Still not helpful. Let me compute 1 + 2 sin^2 x:1 + 2 sin^2 x = 1 + 2 sin^2 x. Not a standard identity. Alternatively, perhaps use 1 = sin^2 x + cos^2 x:1 + 2 sin^2 x = sin^2 x + cos^2 x + 2 sin^2 x = 3 sin^2 x + cos^2 x. Not sure.Alternatively, perhaps write everything in terms of tan x. Let me set t = tan x. Then, sin x = t / sqrt(1 + t^2), cos x = 1 / sqrt(1 + t^2). Then:cot x = 1/t.sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x = 2 (t / sqrt(1 + t^2))(1 / sqrt(1 + t^2)) ) = 2t / (1 + t^2).Therefore, S = 1/t + 2t/(1 + t^2). Let&#39;s compute this:1/t + 2t/(1 + t^2) = [ (1 + t^2) + 2t^2 ] / [ t(1 + t^2) ] = (1 + 3t^2) / [ t(1 + t^2) ]. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe not the right substitution.Alternatively, maybe use tan(pi/4 - x) or some angle addition. Let me think. Suppose we have S expressed as cot x + sin 2x. Let me compute this numerically for small x to see if it resembles a tangent function. For example, if x is small, cot x ≈ 1/x, and sin 2x ≈ 2x. So S ≈ 1/x + 2x. But tan(c pi/d) for small c pi/d would be approximately c pi/d. But not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for cot x + tan x. But cot x + tan x = (cos x / sin x) + (sin x / cos x) = (cos^2 x + sin^2 x)/ (sin x cos x) ) = 1/(sin x cos x). But we have cot x + sin 2x. Wait, sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x. So cot x + sin 2x = cot x + 2 sin x cos x. If we consider 2 sin x cos x = sin 2x, which is similar to the previous identity, but not quite. Wait, let&#39;s try another approach. Let&#39;s recall that S = cot x + sin 2x, where x = pi/(4042). Wait, no, x was defined as pi/(2*2021) which is pi/4042. So x = pi/4042. Wait, but in the previous substitution, x = pi/(2*2021) = pi/4042. So S = cot(pi/4042) + sin(pi/2021). But pi/2021 is 2x, so sin(2x). So S = cot x + sin 2x. Let me write that again:S = cot x + sin 2x, where x = pi/4042.Is there a way to combine cot x + sin 2x into a single trigonometric function? Let&#39;s see:Express cot x as cos x / sin x, and sin 2x as 2 sin x cos x:So S = (cos x / sin x) + 2 sin x cos x. Let&#39;s factor out cos x:S = cos x (1/sin x + 2 sin x). Let&#39;s compute the term in parentheses:1/sin x + 2 sin x = (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x. Therefore, S = cos x * (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x.But 1 + 2 sin^2 x can be written as 1 + sin^2 x + sin^2 x = cos^2 x + 2 sin^2 x. Not helpful. Alternatively, use double-angle identities:1 + 2 sin^2 x = 2 - cos 2x. Wait, because cos 2x = 1 - 2 sin^2 x, so 2 sin^2 x = 1 - cos 2x, so 1 + 2 sin^2 x = 2 - cos 2x. Therefore, substituting:S = cos x * (2 - cos 2x)/sin x.So S = [cos x (2 - cos 2x)] / sin x.But 2 - cos 2x can be written as 1 + (1 - cos 2x) = 1 + 2 sin^2 x, which is circular. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of tan x.Alternatively, set t = tan x, so sin x = t / sqrt(1 + t^2), cos x = 1 / sqrt(1 + t^2). Let&#39;s substitute:S = [ (1 / sqrt(1 + t^2)) * (2 - (1 - t^2)/(1 + t^2)) ] / ( t / sqrt(1 + t^2) )First, compute 2 - cos 2x. cos 2x = (1 - t^2)/(1 + t^2). Therefore, 2 - cos 2x = 2 - (1 - t^2)/(1 + t^2) = [2(1 + t^2) - (1 - t^2)]/(1 + t^2) = [2 + 2t^2 -1 + t^2]/(1 + t^2) = (1 + 3t^2)/(1 + t^2).Therefore, numerator of S: [ (1 / sqrt(1 + t^2)) * (1 + 3t^2)/(1 + t^2) ] = (1 + 3t^2)/( (1 + t^2)^{3/2} )Denominator of S: t / sqrt(1 + t^2). Therefore, S = [ (1 + 3t^2)/( (1 + t^2)^{3/2} ) ] / [ t / sqrt(1 + t^2) ) ] = [ (1 + 3t^2)/( (1 + t^2)^{3/2} ) ] * [ sqrt(1 + t^2)/t ] = (1 + 3t^2)/( (1 + t^2) * t ). So S = (1 + 3t^2)/(t (1 + t^2)).But t = tan x = tan(pi/4042). Let&#39;s write this expression:S = (1 + 3 tan^2 x)/(tan x (1 + tan^2 x)) ). But 1 + tan^2 x = sec^2 x, so:S = (1 + 3 tan^2 x)/(tan x sec^2 x ) = (1 + 3 tan^2 x)/(tan x (1 + tan^2 x)) = [1 + 3 tan^2 x]/[tan x + tan^3 x]. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 1 + 3 tan^2 x. Denominator: tan x (1 + tan^2 x). Let me write it as [3 tan^2 x + 1] / [tan x (tan^2 x + 1)]. Maybe perform polynomial division or look for a substitution. Let me set u = tan x. Then S = (3u^2 +1)/(u(u^2 +1)).But even then, not sure. Alternatively, express as partial fractions:(3u^2 +1)/(u(u^2 +1)) = A/u + (Bu + C)/(u^2 +1). Multiply both sides by u(u^2 +1):3u^2 +1 = A(u^2 +1) + (Bu + C)u.Expand RHS: A u^2 + A + B u^2 + C u. Combine like terms:(A + B) u^2 + C u + A. Compare coefficients:A + B = 3C = 0A = 1Therefore, A =1, B =2, C=0. So:(3u^2 +1)/(u(u^2 +1)) = 1/u + (2u)/(u^2 +1). Therefore, S = 1/u + 2u/(u^2 +1), where u = tan x. But this is just the original expression for S: cot x + sin 2x. So we come back to the same place.Hmm. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t working. Let me think differently. Since the problem states that S can be written as tan(c pi/d). So maybe S = tan(theta), and we need to find theta such that tan(theta) = cot x + sin 2x. But how?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that tan(theta) = [cot x + sin 2x]. Let me write cot x as tan(pi/2 - x). So tan(theta) = tan(pi/2 - x) + sin 2x. Not sure if helpful.Alternatively, use the identity tan(a + b) = (tan a + tan b)/(1 - tan a tan b). Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for sum of angles in sine or cosine.Wait, let&#39;s go back to the original problem. The problem is to compute the sum S = sum_{j=1}^{2021} |sin(2 pi j /2021)|. And it is claimed that S can be written as tan(c pi/d). Then, we need to find c + d where c and d are coprime positive integers with 2c &lt; d. So, the answer is in the form of a tangent function of some rational multiple of pi, with certain conditions on c and d.From our earlier steps, we found that S = cot(pi/4042) + sin(pi/2021). Wait, but pi/4042 is pi/(2*2021), and pi/2021 is 2 pi/(2*2021) = 2x, where x = pi/(2*2021). So maybe there&#39;s a way to relate these terms. Alternatively, recall that cot x = tan(pi/2 -x). So cot(pi/4042) = tan(pi/2 - pi/4042) = tan( (2021 pi - pi)/4042 ) = tan(2020 pi /4042) = tan(1010 pi /2021). So S = tan(1010 pi /2021) + sin(pi/2021). Hmm. Interesting. So S = tan(1010 pi /2021) + sin(pi/2021). But 1010 pi /2021 is equal to pi/2 - pi/(2*2021), since 1010 = (2021 -1)/2. So 1010 pi /2021 = pi/2 - pi/(2*2021). Therefore, tan(1010 pi /2021) = tan(pi/2 - pi/(2*2021)) = cot(pi/(2*2021)) = cot(x). Which brings us back to the previous expression.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s an identity that relates cot x + sin 2x to tan something. Let me try to manipulate S:S = cot x + sin 2x. Let me write cot x as 1/tan x. So S = 1/tan x + sin 2x. Let me express sin 2x in terms of tan x. Recall that sin 2x = 2 tan x / (1 + tan^2 x). Therefore:S = 1/tan x + 2 tan x / (1 + tan^2 x). Let me denote t = tan x. Then:S = 1/t + 2t / (1 + t^2). Let me combine these terms:S = (1 + t^2)/t + 2t / (1 + t^2) - t. Wait, no. Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, combine the two terms over a common denominator:The common denominator is t(1 + t^2). So:S = [ (1 + t^2) + 2t^2 ] / [ t(1 + t^2) ] = (1 + 3t^2) / [ t(1 + t^2) ].Hmm. Let me see if this can be expressed as (a + bt^2) / [ t(1 + t^2) ] leading to some identity. Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me set t = tan y. Then:But not sure. Alternatively, note that (1 + 3t^2)/(t(1 + t^2)) = (1 + t^2 + 2t^2)/(t(1 + t^2)) ) = [1/(t(1 + t^2)) ] + [2t^2/(t(1 + t^2)) ] = [1/(t(1 + t^2)) ] + [2t/(1 + t^2) ].But again, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe write as (1/t) + (2t)/(1 + t^2), which is the same as the original expression.Alternatively, consider if (1 + 3t^2)/(t(1 + t^2)) can be written as tan(theta). Suppose that:tan(theta) = (1 + 3t^2)/(t(1 + t^2)).Is there a theta such that this holds? Let me try to express the right-hand side in terms of tan(theta). Let me suppose that theta is some function of t. But I don&#39;t see an obvious identity here.Alternatively, perhaps use substitution z = t + 1/t. Then z = t + 1/t, so z^2 = t^2 + 2 + 1/t^2. Then, (1 + 3t^2)/(t(1 + t^2)) = (1 + 3t^2)/(t + t^3). Let me write numerator and denominator:Numerator: 3t^2 +1. Denominator: t^3 + t. Factor denominator: t(t^2 +1). Not helpful. Alternatively, write numerator as 3t^2 +1 = a(t^3 + t) + b(t^2 +1) + ct + d. Not sure.Alternatively, perform polynomial division: divide 3t^2 +1 by t^3 + t. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, it can&#39;t be divided. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe relate this to derivative of some function. If we think of (1 + 3t^2)/(t(1 + t^2)), maybe this is the derivative of log or something, but not sure.Alternatively, maybe consider complex numbers. Let me think. Suppose we let t = tan y, then maybe express S in terms of y. Since t = tan x, where x = pi/4042, so y = x. Then S = (1 + 3 tan^2 x)/(tan x (1 + tan^2 x)) ) = (1 + 3 tan^2 x)/(tan x sec^2 x) = (cos^2 x (1 + 3 tan^2 x))/sin x. Compute numerator: cos^2 x + 3 sin^2 x. Therefore, S = (cos^2 x + 3 sin^2 x)/sin x. Which is (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x. Wait, since cos^2 x + 3 sin^2 x = 1 + 2 sin^2 x. Therefore, S = (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x = 1/sin x + 2 sin x. Wait, this is different. Wait:Wait, cos^2 x + 3 sin^2 x = cos^2 x + sin^2 x + 2 sin^2 x = 1 + 2 sin^2 x. Therefore, yes. So S = (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x = csc x + 2 sin x. But csc x + 2 sin x. Can we relate this to a tangent function?Let me write csc x + 2 sin x = 1/sin x + 2 sin x. Let me set z = sin x. Then S = 1/z + 2 z. Let me compute this: 1/z + 2z = (1 + 2 z^2)/z. Let me set this equal to tan(theta):tan(theta) = (1 + 2 z^2)/z.But z = sin x. So tan(theta) = (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x. Is there a theta where this holds? Let me try to express this as a combination of trigonometric identities.Alternatively, cross multiplying: sin(theta)/cos(theta) = (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x. Therefore:sin(theta) sin x = cos(theta) (1 + 2 sin^2 x).Not sure if helpful. Alternatively, maybe express 1 + 2 sin^2 x as 2 - cos 2x as before. Then:tan(theta) = (2 - cos 2x)/sin x. Hmm, but 2 - cos 2x over sin x. Not obvious.Alternatively, consider that theta = something. Let me try to find theta such that:tan(theta) = csc x + 2 sin x. Let me plug in x = pi/4042. Then theta would be arctan(csc x + 2 sin x). But how does this simplify?Alternatively, perhaps use a trigonometric identity for tan(a) + tan(b). Wait, but we have csc x + 2 sin x. Let me think. Suppose we let theta be such that:tan(theta) = csc x + 2 sin x. Let me square both sides:tan^2(theta) = csc^2 x + 4 sin^2 x + 4.Wait, no. (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So:tan^2(theta) = (1/sin x + 2 sin x)^2 = 1/sin^2 x + 4 + 4 sin^2 x.Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, use the identity 1 + tan^2(theta) = sec^2(theta). So:1 + tan^2(theta) = 1 + [ (1 + 2 sin^2 x)/sin x ]^2. Not helpful.Alternatively, let me compute numerically. Let me take x as a small angle, say x = pi/4042, which is very small. Then sin x ≈ x, and csc x ≈ 1/x. Therefore, S ≈ 1/x + 2x. If we suppose that S = tan(theta), then theta ≈ arctan(1/x + 2x). But for small x, 1/x dominates, so theta ≈ pi/2 - x. But this is heuristic.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s an identity I&#39;m missing. Let me recall that in complex analysis, sums over roots of unity can sometimes be evaluated using residues or other techniques. But since we have absolute values, it complicates things.Alternatively, recall that the sum of |sin(theta_j)| for equally spaced points can be evaluated using integration. For large n, the sum can be approximated by an integral, but here n=2021 is finite. However, the problem states that the sum can be expressed exactly as a tangent function, so there must be an exact formula.Alternatively, perhaps there is a known formula for the sum of |sin(2 pi j /n)| from j=1 to n. Let me check some small cases.For example, take n=1: sum is |sin(2pi/1)|=0. But tan(0)=0, but c and d need to be positive integers. Maybe not.n=3: sum_{j=1}^3 |sin(2pi j /3)| = |sin(2pi/3)| + |sin(4pi/3)| + |sin(6pi/3)| = |sqrt(3)/2| + | -sqrt(3)/2 | + |0| = sqrt(3). And sqrt(3) = tan(pi/3). So c=1, d=3, but 2c=2 &lt; d=3, so c + d =4. Indeed, 1 + 3 =4. So in this case, the answer is 4. For n=3, the sum is tan(pi/3), so c=1, d=3.Similarly, check n=5: sum_{j=1}^5 |sin(2pi j /5)|. The values would be sin(72°), sin(144°), sin(216°)=sin(144°), sin(288°)=sin(72°), and sin(360°)=0. So the sum is 2*(sin72 + sin144). Compute this: sin72 ≈0.9511, sin144≈0.5878, so sum≈2*(0.9511+0.5878)=2*1.5389≈3.0778. Is this equal to tan(c pi/d)? Let&#39;s see: tan(72°)=tan(pi/5*2)=tan(2pi/5)≈3.0777. Yes, so sum≈tan(2pi/5). Therefore, c=2, d=5, which are coprime and 2c=4 &lt; d=5. Then c + d=7. So for n=5, the answer is 7. So the formula seems to be S = tan(pi/(2n) * (n-1))? Wait, for n=3, tan(pi/3), which is pi/3= (pi/(2*3))*(3-1)*2? Not sure. Wait, for n=3, S=tan(pi/3). For n=5, S=tan(2pi/5). pi/3 and 2pi/5. Notice that for n=3, which is odd, the sum is tan(pi/3), which is pi/3. For n=5, sum is tan(2pi/5). For n=2021, which is also odd, maybe the sum is tan(k pi /2021) for some k, but according to the problem statement, it&#39;s written as tan(c pi /d). So perhaps for general odd n, the sum is tan(pi (n-1)/(2n)). For n=3: tan(pi*(2)/6)=tan(pi/3). For n=5: tan(pi*4/10)=tan(2pi/5). So yes, for odd n, the sum S = tan(pi*(n-1)/(2n)). Therefore, in the problem, n=2021, so S=tan(pi*(2020)/(4042))=tan(pi*1010/2021). Which simplifies to tan(1010pi/2021). But 1010 and 2021, are they coprime? 2021 is 43*47 (since 43*47=2021), and 1010=2*5*101. So 1010 and 2021 share no common factors. Because 2021 factors into 43 and 47, and 1010 factors into 2,5,101. So they are coprime? Wait, 2021=43*47, and 1010=2*5*101. No common factors, so yes, 1010 and 2021 are coprime. Therefore, c=1010, d=2021. But we need to check if 2c &lt; d. 2c=2020, and d=2021, so 2020 &lt;2021, which is true. Therefore, the answer would be c + d=1010+2021=3031.But wait, in the n=3 case, S=tan(pi/3)=sqrt(3), which is the same as tan(pi/3), and c=1, d=3. But according to the formula I conjectured, for n=3, it would be tan(pi*(3-1)/(2*3))=tan(pi*2/6)=tan(pi/3), so c=1, d=3, which matches. Similarly, for n=5, tan(pi*4/10)=tan(2pi/5), so c=2, d=5. Therefore, the general formula is for odd n, S=tan(pi*(n-1)/(2n)). Therefore, for n=2021, S=tan(pi*2020/(2*2021))=tan(1010pi/2021). Therefore, c=1010, d=2021, which are coprime, and 2c=2020 &lt; d=2021. Hence, c + d=1010 +2021=3031.But in our earlier steps, we had S = cot(pi/4042) + sin(pi/2021). Let&#39;s verify if this is equal to tan(1010pi/2021). Let&#39;s compute tan(1010pi/2021). Since 1010pi/2021 = pi/2 - pi/(2*2021), so tan(pi/2 - x) = cot x. Therefore, tan(1010pi/2021)=cot(pi/(2*2021)). But we had S = cot(pi/(2*2021)) + sin(pi/2021). Therefore, S = tan(1010pi/2021) + sin(pi/2021). But according to the conjecture, S should be tan(1010pi/2021). Therefore, there is a discrepancy. So either the conjecture is wrong or there is a miscalculation.Wait, but in the n=3 case, when n=3, the sum is sqrt(3)=tan(pi/3). According to our steps for n=3, we would have:x=pi/(2*3)=pi/6. Then S = cot(pi/6) + sin(pi/3). cot(pi/6)=sqrt(3), sin(pi/3)=sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, S = sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 = (3sqrt(3))/2. But actual sum is sqrt(3). Therefore, my previous steps must have a mistake.Wait, this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed. For n=3, the correct sum is sqrt(3), but according to the steps I took earlier, S = cot(pi/6) + sin(pi/3) = sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 = 3sqrt(3)/2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong. This means I made a mistake in splitting the sum.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the splitting of the sum for n=3. When n=3, the sum is from j=1 to 3 of |sin(2pi j /3)|. The terms are:j=1: |sin(2pi/3)| = sqrt(3)/2j=2: |sin(4pi/3)| = sqrt(3)/2j=3: |sin(6pi/3)| = |sin(2pi)|=0So sum is sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 +0 = sqrt(3). According to the previous method:S = 2*sum_{j=1}^{1} sin(2pi j /3) + sin(pi/3). Wait, for n=3, middle term is j=2, which is sin(4pi/3)= -sqrt(3)/2, absolute value is sqrt(3)/2. Then sum from j=1 to 1: sin(2pi/3)=sqrt(3)/2. Then S=2*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 = 3sqrt(3)/2. Which is wrong, but the correct sum is sqrt(3). Therefore, there&#39;s an error in the splitting.Ah! Wait, for n=3, when splitting the sum, n=3 is odd, so the number of terms is 3. The first half is j=1, the middle term is j=2, and the last half is j=3. But j=3 corresponds to sin(2pi)=0. But according to the previous method, the middle term is j=2, which is |sin(4pi/3)| = sqrt(3)/2. Then sum from j=1 to 1 of |sin(2pi/3)| = sqrt(3)/2. Then S=2*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2= 3sqrt(3)/2. Which is wrong, but correct sum is sqrt(3). Therefore, the method is flawed. Therefore, the initial approach must be incorrect.This means that the error occurs in how I split the sum. For n=3, splitting into two halves and a middle term leads to an incorrect result. Therefore, my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, I need to revisit the problem.Alternative approach:The problem is to compute S = sum_{j=1}^{2021} |sin(2pi j /2021)|. For an odd number of terms, 2021, which is 2k +1, where k=1010. The sum can be written as sum_{j=1}^k |sin(2pi j /n)| + |sin(pi)| + sum_{j=k+2}^{2k+1} |sin(2pi j /n)|. But wait, sin(pi)=0. So the middle term is zero. Therefore, S = sum_{j=1}^k |sin(2pi j /n)| + sum_{j=k+1}^{2k+1} |sin(2pi j /n)|. But since n=2k+1, the indices from j=k+1 to 2k+1 can be written as j= n - k to n. Therefore, sin(2pi j /n) for j= k+1 to n corresponds to sin(2pi(n - j&#39;)/n) = -sin(2pi j&#39; /n), where j&#39; =n -j. Therefore, the absolute value gives the same as the first half. Therefore, S = 2*sum_{j=1}^k |sin(2pi j /n)|. But wait, in the case of n=3, k=1. So S=2*sum_{j=1}^1 |sin(2pi/3)| =2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3), which is correct. Similarly, for n=5, k=2, sum_{j=1}^2 |sin(2pi j /5)| = sin(72°) + sin(144°), which is the same as sin(72°) + sin(36°), since sin(144°)=sin(36°). Then 2*(sin72 + sin36)≈2*(0.9511 +0.5878)=2*1.5389≈3.0777, which is approximately tan(2pi/5)≈3.0777. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the mistake in the previous approach was including the middle term, which is actually zero. Therefore, the correct splitting is S = 2*sum_{j=1}^k |sin(2pi j /n)|, where n=2k +1. Therefore, for n=2021, k=1010, so S=2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} |sin(2pi j /2021)|.But in this case, the angles from j=1 to 1010 are 2pi/2021 to 2pi*1010/2021=pi - pi/2021. All these angles are in the first and second quadrants where sin is non-negative, so |sin(theta)|=sin(theta). Therefore, S=2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021).Therefore, the earlier mistake was adding the middle term, but actually, since the middle term corresponds to j=1011, which is sin(pi + pi/2021), whose absolute value is |sin(pi/2021)|, but in reality, when n=2k+1, the middle term is j=k+1, which corresponds to theta=pi, but n=2k+1, so theta=2pi*(k+1)/n=2pi*(k+1)/(2k+1). For n=2021, this is 2pi*(1011)/2021=2pi*(1011)/2021=2pi*( (2021 +1)/2 )/2021=pi + pi/2021, as before. The absolute value is |sin(pi + pi/2021)|=sin(pi/2021). Therefore, the correct splitting should be S=2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021) + sin(pi/2021). But in the n=3 case, this would give S=2*sum_{j=1}^1 sin(2pi/3) + sin(pi/3)=2*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2= sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2= 3sqrt(3)/2, which is incorrect. But the correct sum is sqrt(3). Therefore, there must be a mistake in the splitting.Wait, confusion arises because for n=3, j=1,2,3. The middle term is j=2: theta=4pi/3, whose sine is -sqrt(3)/2, absolute value is sqrt(3)/2. Sum from j=1: sin(2pi/3)=sqrt(3)/2, j=2: sqrt(3)/2, j=3:0. So sum is sqrt(3). But according to splitting into 2*sum_{j=1}^{1} sin(2pi/3) + sin(pi/3): 2*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2= 3sqrt(3)/2. So why discrepancy?Wait, because for n=3, the middle term is j=2, which is not theta=pi + pi/3, but theta=4pi/3. However, theta=pi + pi/3=4pi/3, and sin(theta)=sin(pi + pi/3)= -sin(pi/3). Therefore, |sin(theta)|=sin(pi/3). Therefore, the middle term is sin(pi/3). Therefore, according to the splitting, S=2*sum_{j=1}^1 sin(2pi/3) + sin(pi/3)=2*(sqrt(3)/2)+sqrt(3)/2=sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2= 3sqrt(3)/2. But the correct sum is sqrt(3). Therefore, the splitting approach is incorrect. Therefore, there must be a different way to split the sum.Wait, perhaps the mistake is that for even and odd n, the way to split the sum differs. For even n, you can split into two equal halves, but for odd n, there is a middle term. However, when taking absolute values, the symmetry is around pi, so for each term theta_j in the first half (0 &lt; theta_j &lt; pi), there is a corresponding term theta&#39;_j = 2pi - theta_j in the second half (pi &lt; theta&#39;_j &lt; 2pi), and their sine values are negatives, so absolute values are equal. Therefore, for each term from j=1 to n-1, |sin(theta_j)| = |sin(theta_{n -j})|. Therefore, for odd n=2k+1, the number of pairs is k, and the middle term is j=k+1, which is theta=pi, but sin(pi)=0. Wait, but for n=2k+1, theta=pi when j=(n)/2, but n is odd, so j=(2k+1)/2 is not an integer. Therefore, there is no j such that theta_j=pi. Therefore, all terms can be paired as j and n -j, with theta_j and 2pi - theta_j, which have the same absolute sine. Therefore, the sum S = 2*sum_{j=1}^k |sin(2pi j /n)|. Therefore, for n=3, k=1, S=2*sin(2pi/3)=sqrt(3), which is correct. For n=5, k=2, S=2*(sin(2pi/5) + sin(4pi/5))=2*(sin72 + sin144)=2*(sin72 + sin36)=2*(0.9511 +0.5878)=3.0778, which matches tan(2pi/5).Therefore, my earlier mistake was incorrectly including a middle term which doesn&#39;t exist because there is no j for which theta_j=pi. Therefore, the correct splitting is S=2*sum_{j=1}^k |sin(2pi j /n)|, where n=2k +1. Therefore, for n=2021, k=1010, so S=2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021). Because in this case, all theta_j from j=1 to 1010 are between 2pi/2021 and 2pi*1010/2021=pi - pi/2021, which are in the first and second quadrants where sine is positive. Therefore, no absolute value needed, and the sum is twice the sum from j=1 to 1010 of sin(2pi j /2021).Therefore, going back to the sum for n=2021, S=2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021). Then, using the formula for the sum of sines:sum_{j=1}^m sin(jθ) = [sin(mθ/2) * sin((m +1)θ/2)] / sin(θ/2).Here, m=1010, θ=2pi/2021.Therefore, sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2pi j /2021) = [sin(1010*(2pi/2021)/2) * sin(1011*(2pi/2021)/2)] / sin(pi/2021).Simplify the arguments:1010*(2pi/2021)/2 = 1010*pi/20211011*(2pi/2021)/2 = 1011*pi/2021So, sum = [sin(1010pi/2021) * sin(1011pi/2021)] / sin(pi/2021).But note that 1010pi/2021 = pi - 1011pi/2021, so sin(1010pi/2021) = sin(pi - 1011pi/2021) = sin(1011pi/2021). Therefore, the sum becomes [sin^2(1011pi/2021)] / sin(pi/2021).Then, 1011pi/2021 = pi/2 + pi/(2*2021), so sin(1011pi/2021) = cos(pi/(2*2021)). Therefore, sin^2(1011pi/2021) = cos^2(pi/(2*2021)).Therefore, sum = cos^2(pi/(2*2021)) / sin(pi/2021).But cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2, so sum = (1 + cos(pi/2021)) / (2 sin(pi/2021)).Therefore, S=2*sum = (1 + cos(pi/2021))/sin(pi/2021).This simplifies to cot(pi/(2*2021)), because:(1 + cos x)/sin x = cot(x/2), where x = pi/2021. Therefore, S = cot(pi/(4042)).But cot(pi/(4042)) = tan(pi/2 - pi/4042) = tan( (2021pi - pi)/4042 ) = tan(2020pi/4042) = tan(1010pi/2021).Therefore, S = tan(1010pi/2021). Therefore, the sum S can be written as tan(c pi /d) where c=1010 and d=2021. Since 1010 and 2021 are coprime (as 2021=43*47 and 1010=2*5*101), and 2c=2020 &lt; d=2021. Therefore, c + d=1010+2021=3031.Final Answerboxed{3031}&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of the sum ( S = sum_{j=1}^{2021} left| sin frac{2pi j}{2021} right| ), we start by considering the symmetry of the sine function and the periodicity of the absolute value. Since 2021 is an odd number, we can split the sum into pairs of terms that are symmetric around (pi), and note that there is no middle term because the angle (pi) does not correspond to an integer index.The sum can be written as twice the sum from ( j = 1 ) to ( j = 1010 ) because each term ( left| sin frac{2pi j}{2021} right| ) pairs with ( left| sin frac{2pi (2021 - j)}{2021} right| ), which are equal. This gives:[S = 2 sum_{j=1}^{1010} left| sin frac{2pi j}{2021} right|]Since ( sin frac{2pi j}{2021} ) is non-negative for ( j ) from 1 to 1010, we can remove the absolute value:[S = 2 sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin frac{2pi j}{2021}]Using the formula for the sum of sines in an arithmetic progression, we have:[sum_{j=1}^{n} sin(jtheta) = frac{sinleft(frac{ntheta}{2}right) sinleft(frac{(n + 1)theta}{2}right)}{sinleft(frac{theta}{2}right)}]Setting ( n = 1010 ) and ( theta = frac{2pi}{2021} ), we get:[sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin frac{2pi j}{2021} = frac{sinleft(1010 cdot frac{pi}{2021}right) sinleft(1011 cdot frac{pi}{2021}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)}]Using the identity ( sin(pi - x) = sin(x) ), we find:[sinleft(1010 cdot frac{pi}{2021}right) = sinleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)]Thus, the sum simplifies to:[sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin frac{2pi j}{2021} = frac{sin^2left(frac{1011pi}{2021}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)}]Recognizing that ( frac{1011pi}{2021} = frac{pi}{2} + frac{pi}{4042} ), we use the identity ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + xright) = cos(x) ):[sinleft(frac{1011pi}{2021}right) = cosleft(frac{pi}{4042}right)]Thus, the sum becomes:[sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin frac{2pi j}{2021} = frac{cos^2left(frac{pi}{4042}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)}]Using the double-angle identity ( cos^2(x) = frac{1 + cos(2x)}{2} ), we get:[sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin frac{2pi j}{2021} = frac{1 + cosleft(frac{pi}{1010.5}right)}{2 sinleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)}]Simplifying further, we find:[S = 2 cdot frac{1 + cosleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)}{2 sinleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)} = frac{1 + cosleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2021}right)} = cotleft(frac{pi}{4042}right)]Recognizing that ( cotleft(frac{pi}{4042}right) = tanleft(frac{1010pi}{2021}right) ), we conclude that ( S = tanleft(frac{1010pi}{2021}right) ). The integers ( c = 1010 ) and ( d = 2021 ) are coprime and satisfy ( 2c &lt; d ). Therefore, the value of ( c + d ) is:[boxed{3031}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the sum S which is the sum from j=1 to 2021 of the absolute value of sin(2πj/2021). Then, according to the problem, this sum can be written as tan(cπ/d) where c and d are coprime positive integers with 2c &lt; d. Then I have to find c + d. Hmm, interesting. Alright, let&#39;s start breaking this down.First, let me understand the sum. It&#39;s the absolute value of sine of angles that are multiples of 2π/2021, from j=1 to 2021. So these angles go around the unit circle in steps of 2π/2021. But since sine is positive in the first and second quadrants and negative in the third and fourth, taking the absolute value would make all the sine values positive. So effectively, we&#39;re summing |sin(θ)| where θ = 2πj/2021 for j from 1 to 2021.But wait, since j goes from 1 to 2021, which is the same as one full rotation around the circle, right? Because 2πj/2021 when j=2021 is 2π*2021/2021 = 2π. So we cover the entire circle. But sine has a period of 2π, so the sine values would repeat every 2π. However, since we are taking absolute values, the period effectively becomes π, because |sin(θ)| = |sin(θ + π)|. So maybe the sum can be simplified by considering symmetry?Let me think. For each angle θ in [0, π], there&#39;s a corresponding angle θ + π in [π, 2π], and their sine values are negatives of each other, but since we take absolute values, both |sin θ| and |sin(θ + π)| are equal to |sin θ|. Therefore, the sum over the entire circle would be twice the sum over the semicircle [0, π]. So instead of summing from 1 to 2021, maybe we can split the sum into two parts: from j=1 to j=1010 (which would cover angles up to just before π) and then from j=1011 to 2021 (which would cover angles from π onwards). But due to the periodicity, the second half would mirror the first half in terms of absolute sine values.Wait, let&#39;s check with specific numbers. Let&#39;s take j=1: θ=2π/2021. Then j=1011 would be θ=2π*1011/2021. Let me calculate that: 1011*2π/2021 = (2022/2021)π = π + π/2021. So θ=π + π/2021. Then sin(θ) = sin(π + π/2021) = -sin(π/2021). Taking absolute value, |sin(theta)| = sin(π/2021). Similarly, for j=2, theta=4π/2021, and j=1012 would be theta=2π*1012/2021 = (2024/2021)π = π + 3π/2021, so sin(theta) = -sin(3π/2021), absolute value is sin(3π/2021). So in general, for each j from 1 to 1010, there is a corresponding j&#39; = 2021 - j + 1 (since 2021 - j +1 = 2021 - (j -1)) which would give theta = 2π*(2021 - j +1)/2021 = 2π - 2πj/2021 + 2π/2021 = 2π - (theta - 2π/2021). Wait, maybe that&#39;s getting too complicated. The main point is that each term in the second half (j=1011 to 2021) is the same as the terms in the first half (j=1 to 1010) but mirrored. Therefore, their absolute sine values are the same. So the sum S is twice the sum from j=1 to 1010 of sin(2πj/2021). But wait, 2021 is an odd number. So 2021 divided by 2 is 1010.5, meaning that 1010 terms are in the first half (from 0 to π) and 1011 would be the middle term. But j=1011 would correspond to theta=2π*1011/2021= π + π/2021, which is in the second half. However, since 2021 is odd, there is no exact middle term at pi. So the total number of terms is 2021, which is odd, so when we split into two halves, each half would have 1010 terms, and the middle term is j=1011, which is pi + pi/2021. Wait, but we are taking absolute values, so the middle term is |sin(pi + pi/2021)| = | - sin(pi/2021) | = sin(pi/2021). Therefore, if we pair each term j in 1 to 1010 with j&#39;=2021 - j +1, each pair will have the same absolute sine value, and the middle term j=1011 is sin(pi/2021). Therefore, the total sum S is 2 times the sum from j=1 to 1010 of sin(2πj/2021) plus the middle term sin(pi/2021). But wait, actually, since when you split 2021 terms into two halves with an odd number, the middle term is unique. So, S = 2*(sum from j=1 to 1010 |sin(2πj/2021)| ) + |sin(2π*1011/2021)|. But since the middle term is |sin(pi + pi/2021)| = sin(pi/2021). Therefore, S = 2*(sum from j=1 to 1010 sin(2πj/2021)) + sin(pi/2021). Wait, but actually, the sum from j=1 to 2021 |sin(2πj/2021)| is equal to 2*sum from j=1 to 1010 |sin(2πj/2021)| + |sin(2π*1011/2021)|. But since |sin(2πj/2021)| is the same as sin(2πj/2021) for j from 1 to 1010, because 2πj/2021 ranges from 2π/2021 to 2π*1010/2021, which is just under pi. For example, 2π*1010/2021 is (2020/2021)π, which is less than pi, so sin is positive. Then the middle term is pi + pi/2021, which is in the third quadrant where sine is negative, but absolute value makes it positive. Therefore, yes, S is equal to twice the sum from j=1 to 1010 sin(2πj/2021) plus sin(pi/2021). So perhaps we can write S = 2*sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin(2πj/2021) + sin(pi/2021).But maybe there&#39;s a better way to express this sum. I recall that the sum of sin(nθ) from n=1 to N is given by a certain formula, but here we have a sum of sin(2πj/2021) with j from 1 to 1010, and then an extra term. Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a formula for the sum of |sin(jθ)| over a full period. Let me check.Wait, another approach: since the points 2πj/2021 for j=1 to 2021 are equally spaced points around the unit circle. So the sum S is the sum of the absolute values of the imaginary parts of those roots of unity. There might be a known formula for such a sum.Alternatively, since the problem states that S can be written as tan(cπ/d), maybe I need to recall some trigonometric identities or series that sum up to a tangent function.Alternatively, perhaps we can use complex exponentials. Let me consider writing sine in terms of exponentials: sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i). But since we have absolute values, that complicates things. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe we can relate this sum to the imaginary parts of the roots of unity. The sum of |sin(2πj/n)| from j=1 to n. For n being 2021 here. There might be a formula for that.Wait, I found in some references that the sum of |sin(π j/n)| from j=1 to n-1 is equal to cot(π/(2n)). But here our angle is 2π j /2021, so let&#39;s see. Let me check that.Wait, here&#39;s a thought. If we have sum_{j=1}^{n-1} |sin(π j/n)| = cot(π/(2n)). Is that correct? Let me check for a small n. Let&#39;s take n=2. Then sum is |sin(π*1/2)| = 1. cot(π/(4)) = 1. So 1=1. Good. For n=3. Sum from j=1 to 2 |sin(π j/3)| = |sin(π/3)| + |sin(2π/3)| = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). cot(π/(6)) = cot(30°) = sqrt(3). So yes, that works. So that formula seems correct: sum_{j=1}^{n-1} |sin(π j/n)| = cot(π/(2n)). Interesting.But in our problem, the sum is over |sin(2π j/2021)| from j=1 to 2021. Let&#39;s note that 2π j /2021 = π * (2j)/2021. So if we let k = 2j, then when j goes from 1 to 2021, k goes from 2 to 4042, but modulo 2π. However, since the sine function is periodic with period 2π, but we are taking absolute values, which have period π. So perhaps we can think of the angles as multiples of π/2021. Wait, 2πj/2021 = 2π*(j)/2021. So if we set m = 2j, then it&#39;s π*m/2021. But m would range from 2 to 4042, but angles repeat every 2π, so modulo 2π. However, since we take absolute value, the effective period is π, so angles repeat every π. Therefore, π*m/2021 modulo π. So m can be considered modulo 2021. Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let&#39;s see:If we have sum_{j=1}^{2021} |sin(2πj/2021)|. Let&#39;s note that 2πj/2021 as j goes from 1 to 2021 gives angles from 2π/2021 up to 2π*2021/2021=2π. So it&#39;s covering the entire circle. But since we take absolute values, each term is |sin(theta)| where theta is equally spaced around the circle. Therefore, the sum can be related to integrating |sin(theta)| over the circle, but in discrete steps. But integrating |sin(theta)| over 0 to 2π is 4, so the average is 4/(2π) = 2/π. Therefore, the sum might be approximately 2021*(2/π). But this is just an approximation. However, the problem states that the sum is exactly equal to tan(cπ/d). So there must be an exact formula.Wait, let&#39;s recall the formula I mentioned earlier: sum_{j=1}^{n-1} |sin(π j/n)| = cot(π/(2n)). If we can relate our sum to this formula. Let&#39;s see:Our sum is sum_{j=1}^{2021} |sin(2πj/2021)|. Let me note that 2πj/2021 = π*(2j)/2021. If we let k = 2j, then k ranges from 2 to 4042 in steps of 2. But since angles are modulo 2π, k modulo 2021 would correspond to the same angle. However, 2j modulo 2021 cycles through even numbers. Wait, since 2021 is odd, 2 and 2021 are coprime. Therefore, 2j modulo 2021 for j=1 to 2021 cycles through all residues modulo 2021 exactly once. Wait, no, 2j modulo 2021 would cycle through all residues because 2 and 2021 are coprime. Wait, 2021 is 43*47, both primes, so 2 is coprime to 2021. Therefore, multiplying by 2 modulo 2021 is a permutation. Therefore, the set {2j mod 2021 | j=1,...,2021} is the same as {1,...,2020, 0}, but since j goes up to 2021, 2*2021 mod 2021 is 0. Therefore, k=2j mod 2021 gives each residue from 0 to 2020 exactly once, plus 0. But 0 corresponds to j=2021, since 2*2021 mod 2021 is 0.But then, the angles 2πj/2021 correspond to angles π*k/2021 where k runs from 0 to 2020, and then k=0 again. But |sin(π*0/2021)| = 0, so actually, the sum from j=1 to 2021 |sin(2πj/2021)| is equal to sum_{k=0}^{2020} |sin(π*k/2021)|. But when k=0, sin(0)=0, so that term is 0. Therefore, our sum S is equal to sum_{k=1}^{2020} |sin(π*k/2021)|. So that&#39;s similar to the formula I mentioned earlier where sum_{j=1}^{n-1} |sin(π j/n)| = cot(π/(2n)). But in our case, n=2021, so sum_{k=1}^{2020} |sin(π k /2021)| = cot(π/(2*2021)) = cot(π/4042). Wait, according to that formula. Let me check with small n. For example, n=2: sum_{k=1}^1 |sin(π*1/2)| = 1. cot(π/(4)) = 1. So that works. For n=3: sum_{k=1}^2 |sin(π k/3)| = sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3). cot(π/(6)) = sqrt(3). That works too. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, in general, sum_{k=1}^{n-1} |sin(π k/n)| = cot(π/(2n)).Therefore, in our case, n=2021, so sum_{k=1}^{2020} |sin(π k /2021)| = cot(π/(2*2021)) = cot(π/4042). Therefore, our sum S is equal to cot(π/4042). But the problem states that S can be written as tan(cπ/d). So, cot(π/4042) is equal to tan(π/2 - π/4042) = tan((2021π)/4042). Because cot x = tan(π/2 - x). Therefore, cot(π/4042) = tan(π/2 - π/4042) = tan((2021π)/4042). Because π/2 is equal to 2021π/4042 + π/4042. Wait, π/2 = (2021π)/4042 + π/4042? Let&#39;s check:(2021 +1)π / 4042 = 2022π/4042 = 1011π/2021. But π/2 is 1010.5π/2021. Wait, maybe my arithmetic is off. Let me compute π/2 - π/4042:π/2 - π/4042 = (2021π - π)/4042 = 2020π/4042 = 1010π/2021. Therefore, cot(π/4042) = tan(1010π/2021). Therefore, S = tan(1010π/2021). But we need to write this as tan(cπ/d) where c and d are coprime positive integers with 2c &lt; d.First, let&#39;s simplify 1010/2021. What is the GCD of 1010 and 2021? Let&#39;s compute:2021 divided by 1010 is 2 with a remainder of 2021 - 2*1010 = 2021 - 2020 = 1.Then, GCD(1010, 1) = 1. Therefore, 1010 and 2021 are coprime? Wait, 1010 is 10*101, and 2021 is 43*47. So yes, they are coprime. Therefore, 1010 and 2021 have GCD 1. Wait, 1010 = 2*5*101, and 2021 = 43*47. So no common factors. Therefore, 1010π/2021 is already in reduced form, so c =1010 and d=2021. But we need to check the condition 2c &lt; d. 2c = 2020, and d=2021. So 2020 &lt; 2021, which is true. Therefore, c=1010 and d=2021. Therefore, c + d =1010 + 2021 = 3031.Wait, but hold on. The problem states that the sum S is equal to tan(cπ/d). But according to our calculation, S = cot(π/4042) = tan(1010π/2021). So that would mean c=1010 and d=2021. But let me verify that 1010 and 2021 are coprime. As we saw before, 2021 is 43*47, and 1010 is 2*5*101. So there are no common prime factors. Therefore, yes, they are coprime. And 2c = 2020 &lt; 2021 = d. So 2c &lt; d holds. Therefore, the answer is c + d = 1010 + 2021 = 3031.But wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn&#39;t skip something important.First, we converted the original sum S = sum_{j=1}^{2021} |sin(2πj/2021)| to sum_{k=1}^{2020} |sin(πk/2021)| by recognizing that 2j mod 2021 cycles through all residues from 1 to 2020 when j goes from 1 to 2021 (since 2 and 2021 are coprime), and then applying the formula sum_{k=1}^{n-1} |sin(πk/n)| = cot(π/(2n)). Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{2020} |sin(πk/2021)| = cot(π/(2*2021)) = cot(π/4042). Then, using cot x = tan(π/2 - x), we have cot(π/4042) = tan(π/2 - π/4042). Calculating π/2 - π/4042:π/2 = (2021π)/4042, so π/2 - π/4042 = (2021π - π)/4042 = 2020π/4042 = 1010π/2021. So, indeed, cot(π/4042) = tan(1010π/2021). Therefore, S = tan(1010π/2021), which gives c=1010, d=2021, and since they are coprime and 2c=2020 &lt; 2021=d, the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the answer is 1010 + 2021 = 3031.Therefore, I think the answer is 3031. But just to make sure, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s an alternative approach that could lead to a different conclusion, but I don&#39;t see one. The key steps were recognizing the sum can be transformed using the 2j mod 2021 permutation and then applying the known formula for the sum of |sin(πk/n)|, which gives cot(π/(2n)), then converting cotangent to tangent via complementary angles. All steps seem valid. Therefore, the answer should be 3031.Final Answerboxed{3031}&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of the sum ( S = sum_{j=1}^{2021} left| sin frac{2pi j}{2021} right| ), we start by recognizing that the angles ( frac{2pi j}{2021} ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, 2021 ) are equally spaced around the unit circle. The absolute value of sine makes all terms non-negative, allowing us to use symmetry and periodicity properties of the sine function.We note that the sum of ( left| sin frac{2pi j}{2021} right| ) over ( j = 1 ) to ( 2021 ) can be transformed by considering the angles ( frac{pi k}{2021} ) for ( k = 1 ) to ( 2020 ). This transformation is valid because multiplying by 2 modulo 2021 (which is coprime to 2) permutes the residues, effectively covering all angles from ( frac{pi}{2021} ) to ( frac{2020pi}{2021} ).Using the known formula for the sum of absolute sines over a full period, we have:[sum_{k=1}^{n-1} left| sin frac{pi k}{n} right| = cot left( frac{pi}{2n} right)]For ( n = 2021 ), this gives:[sum_{k=1}^{2020} left| sin frac{pi k}{2021} right| = cot left( frac{pi}{4042} right)]Converting cotangent to tangent using the identity ( cot x = tan left( frac{pi}{2} - x right) ), we get:[cot left( frac{pi}{4042} right) = tan left( frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{4042} right) = tan left( frac{2020pi}{4042} right) = tan left( frac{1010pi}{2021} right)]Here, ( c = 1010 ) and ( d = 2021 ), which are coprime and satisfy ( 2c &lt; d ). Therefore, the value of ( c + d ) is:[c + d = 1010 + 2021 = 3031][boxed{3031}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf74bc24></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf74bc24><span class="icon" data-v-cf74bc24>🔑:</span>1. Consider the sum ( S = sum_{j=1}^{2021} left|sin frac{2pi j}{2021}right| ). Notice that (sin frac{2pi j}{2021} = 0) when (j = 2021), so we can ignore this term.2. Due to the absolute value, we can rewrite the sum as:   [   S = 2 sum_{j=1}^{1010} left|sin frac{2pi j}{2021}right|   ]   This is because (sin frac{2pi j}{2021}) is symmetric around (pi), and thus the sum from (j=1) to (1010) is half of the total sum.3. The sum (sum_{j=1}^{1010} sin frac{2pi j}{2021}) can be interpreted as the imaginary part of the sum of complex exponentials:   [   sum_{j=1}^{1010} e^{i frac{2pi j}{2021}}   ]4. This is a geometric series with the common ratio (e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}}) and can be summed using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:   [   sum_{j=1}^{1010} e^{i frac{2pi j}{2021}} = frac{e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}} (1 - (e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}})^{1010})}{1 - e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}}}   ]5. Simplifying the numerator:   [   1 - (e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}})^{1010} = 1 - e^{i pi} = 1 + 1 = 2   ]   Therefore, the sum becomes:   [   frac{e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}} cdot 2}{1 - e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}}}   ]6. To find the imaginary part, we can rewrite the expression:   [   frac{2 e^{i frac{pi}{2021}}}{1 - e^{i frac{2pi}{2021}}}   ]7. Let (x = frac{pi}{2021}). Then the expression becomes:   [   frac{2 (cos x + i sin x)}{1 - (cos 2x + i sin 2x)}   ]8. Using the double-angle identities, (cos 2x = 2cos^2 x - 1) and (sin 2x = 2sin x cos x), we get:   [   1 - (cos 2x + i sin 2x) = 1 - (2cos^2 x - 1 + i 2sin x cos x) = 2(1 - cos^2 x) - i 2sin x cos x = 2sin^2 x - i 2sin x cos x   ]9. The imaginary part of the fraction is:   [   frac{2 sin x}{2 sin^2 x - i 2 sin x cos x}   ]10. Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{sin x}{sin^2 x - i sin x cos x}    ]11. The imaginary part of this expression is:    [    frac{sin x}{2 - 2 cos x} = frac{sin x}{2(1 - cos x)} = frac{sin x}{2 sin^2 frac{x}{2}} = cot frac{x}{2}    ]12. Therefore, the desired value is:    [    cot frac{pi}{4042}    ]13. Since (cot frac{pi}{4042} = tan left(frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{4042}right)), we have:    [    tan left(frac{2021pi - pi}{4042}right) = tan left(frac{2020pi}{4042}right) = tan left(frac{1010pi}{2021}right)    ]14. Thus, the value of (S) can be written as (tan left(frac{1010pi}{2021}right)), where (c = 1010) and (d = 2021). Since (2c &lt; d), we have (2 cdot 1010 &lt; 2021).The final answer is (boxed{3031}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-edca29a5 data-v-cf74bc24><div class="review" data-v-cf74bc24><div class="review-title" data-v-cf74bc24><span class="icon" data-v-cf74bc24>❓:</span>19.

So, Little Red Riding Hood is delivering waffles to three grannies. She starts with a certain number of waffles in her basket. Before she enters each granny&#39;s house, the Big Bad Wolf eats half of the waffles. Then she delivers the same number of waffles to each granny. After leaving the third granny&#39;s house, she has no waffles left. The question is asking which of the options (4, 5, 6, 7, 9) definitely divides the number of waffles she started with.Hmm, let me break this down. Let&#39;s denote the initial number of waffles as N. Then, before each granny&#39;s house, the wolf eats half, so after the first wolf encounter, she has N/2 left. Then she delivers some waffles to the first granny. Let&#39;s call the number of waffles delivered each time x. So after delivering to the first granny, she has N/2 - x waffles remaining.Then, before the second granny&#39;s house, the wolf eats half again. So that would be (N/2 - x)/2. Then she delivers x waffles again, leaving her with (N/2 - x)/2 - x.Similarly, before the third granny&#39;s house, the wolf eats half of that, so [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2, then she delivers x waffles, and after that, she has 0 left. So the final equation would be:[[(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x] = 0Let me write this step by step.Starting with N.After first wolf: N/2After first delivery: N/2 - xAfter second wolf: (N/2 - x)/2After second delivery: (N/2 - x)/2 - xAfter third wolf: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2After third delivery: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x = 0So, let&#39;s solve this equation step by step. Let&#39;s start from the end.After third delivery: 0 waffles left. So, before delivering to the third granny, she had x waffles, because she delivered x and had 0 left. But wait, actually, before the third delivery, the wolf eats half of her remaining waffles. Wait, no. Let me check again.Wait, the process is: Before entering each house, the wolf eats half. Then she delivers waffles. So for each granny, the sequence is: wolf eats half, then she delivers x. So for each of the three grannies, it&#39;s:1. Wolf eats half.2. Deliver x waffles.So, starting with N.First granny&#39;s house:- Wolf eats half: N becomes N/2.- Deliver x: N/2 - x.Second granny&#39;s house:- Wolf eats half: (N/2 - x)/2.- Deliver x: (N/2 - x)/2 - x.Third granny&#39;s house:- Wolf eats half: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2.- Deliver x: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x.After the third delivery, she has 0 left. So:[(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x = 0Let me compute this step by step.Let me denote each step.After first granny:Start: NAfter wolf: N/2After delivery: N/2 - xAfter second granny:After wolf: (N/2 - x)/2After delivery: (N/2 - x)/2 - xAfter third granny:After wolf: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2After delivery: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x = 0So, solving [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x = 0.Let&#39;s work backwards. Let&#39;s let A = [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x = 0.So, [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 = xMultiply both sides by 2:[(N/2 - x)/2 - x] = 2xThen, (N/2 - x)/2 - x = 2xCombine the terms:(N/2 - x)/2 = 3xMultiply both sides by 2:N/2 - x = 6xThen, N/2 = 7xSo, N = 14xWait, so N is 14x? Hmm. That would mean that N is a multiple of 14. But 14 isn&#39;t one of the options. The options are 4,5,6,7,9. Hmm. But maybe x has to be an integer? Because you can&#39;t deliver a fraction of a waffle. So N must be a multiple of 14, and x must be an integer. So 14x would mean that N is divisible by 14, but 14 isn&#39;t an option. Wait, but the question says &quot;which of the following numbers definitely divides the number of waffles she started with?&quot; So maybe 7 divides N, since 14 is 2*7, so 7 is a factor. So if N is 14x, then 7 divides N. So 7 is a definite divisor. Let me check.Wait, let me verify my steps again.Starting from the end:After third delivery: 0So before delivering to the third granny, after the wolf ate half, she had x waffles left. Because she delivered x and ended up with 0. Wait, that might be a better way to think. Let me reverse the process.Let me work backwards. When she leaves the third granny&#39;s house, she has 0 waffles. That means before delivering to the third granny, she had x waffles. But just before delivering, the wolf had eaten half. So the amount before the wolf ate half would be double that. So before the wolf ate the third time, she had 2x waffles. Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s think:When she arrives at the third granny&#39;s house, the wolf eats half of her waffles, then she delivers x waffles, and has 0 left. So let me denote:After wolf: she has half of what she had before the wolf.Let’s denote:Let’s call the number of waffles she has before encountering the wolf at the third granny&#39;s house as C.Wolf eats half: C becomes C/2.Then she delivers x: C/2 - x = 0.Therefore, C/2 - x = 0 =&gt; C = 2x.So before the third wolf encounter, she had 2x waffles.Similarly, before delivering to the second granny, after the wolf ate half, she had some number of waffles, which then became 2x after delivering. Wait, maybe working backwards is better.Let’s start from the end and go backwards.After third delivery: 0.Before third delivery, after wolf: she had x waffles (because she delivered x and had 0). Therefore, before the wolf at the third granny&#39;s house, she had 2x waffles (since the wolf ate half, leaving her with x).So before third wolf: 2x waffles.Now, that 2x is equal to the number of waffles she had after delivering to the second granny. Wait, no. Let me see:After delivering to the second granny, she had some number of waffles. Then she went to the third granny&#39;s house, the wolf ate half, leaving her with half, then she delivered x, ending with 0. So:Let’s define:After second delivery: D waffles.Before third wolf: D waffles.After wolf: D/2.After third delivery: D/2 - x = 0 =&gt; D/2 = x =&gt; D = 2x.Therefore, after the second delivery, she had 2x waffles.Similarly, before the second delivery, after the wolf ate half, she had some number which became 2x after delivering x.So, let&#39;s define:After first delivery: E waffles.Before second wolf: E waffles.After wolf: E/2.After second delivery: E/2 - x = 2x.So, E/2 - x = 2x =&gt; E/2 = 3x =&gt; E = 6x.So, after the first delivery, she had 6x waffles.Similarly, before the first delivery, after the wolf ate half, she had some number which became 6x after delivering x.Starting from the beginning:Initial waffles: N.Before first wolf: N waffles.After wolf: N/2.After first delivery: N/2 - x = 6x (from above).Therefore, N/2 - x = 6x =&gt; N/2 = 7x =&gt; N = 14x.So, N = 14x.Since x must be a positive integer (she can&#39;t deliver a fraction of a waffle), the initial number N must be a multiple of 14.Looking at the answer choices: 4,5,6,7,9. Which of these numbers definitely divides N?Since N =14x, which is 14 times some integer. 14 factors are 1,2,7,14. So among the options given, 7 is a factor. 14 is divisible by 7. The other options, like 4,5,6,9, may or may not divide 14x. For example, if x=1, N=14, which is divisible by 7 and 14, but not by 4,5,6,9. If x=2, N=28, which is divisible by 4,7. If x=3, N=42, divisible by 6,7. If x=5, N=70, divisible by 5,7. So, depending on x, N can be divisible by 4,5,6, or not. However, regardless of x, since N=14x, 7 is always a divisor. Therefore, the answer should be D, 7.Wait, but let me verify with an example. Let&#39;s take x=1. Then N=14*1=14. Let&#39;s go through the steps.Start with N=14.First granny:Wolf eats half: 14/2=7.Deliver x=1: 7-1=6.Second granny:Wolf eats half: 6/2=3.Deliver x=1: 3-1=2.Third granny:Wolf eats half: 2/2=1.Deliver x=1: 1-1=0. Correct.So, works. Now, x=2, N=28.First granny:28/2=14. 14-2=12.Second granny:12/2=6. 6-2=4.Third granny:4/2=2. 2-2=0. Correct.So here, N=28, which is divisible by 4,7, etc. So depending on x, different factors. But in both cases, 7 is a divisor.If x=3, N=42.42/2=21. 21-3=18.18/2=9. 9-3=6.6/2=3. 3-3=0.42 is divisible by 6 and 7. So here, both 6 and 7 divide N.If x=5, N=70.70/2=35. 35-5=30.30/2=15. 15-5=10.10/2=5. 5-5=0.70 is divisible by 5 and 7.So in all cases, N is divisible by 7. Depending on x, it might be divisible by others, but 7 is always there. Therefore, the correct answer is D, 7.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Let ( N ) be the initial number of waffles Little Red Riding Hood starts with. Before entering each granny&#39;s house, the Big Bad Wolf eats half of the waffles, and then she delivers ( x ) waffles to each granny. After leaving the third granny&#39;s house, she has no waffles left. We need to determine which of the given numbers definitely divides ( N ).Working backwards from the end:1. After delivering to the third granny, she has 0 waffles left. This means before delivering to the third granny, she had ( x ) waffles. Before the wolf ate half, she had ( 2x ) waffles.2. After delivering to the second granny, she had ( 2x ) waffles. Before the wolf ate half, she had ( 4x ) waffles. After delivering ( x ) waffles, she had ( 4x - x = 3x ) waffles, so before the wolf ate half, she had ( 6x ) waffles.3. After delivering to the first granny, she had ( 6x ) waffles. Before the wolf ate half, she had ( 12x ) waffles. After delivering ( x ) waffles, she had ( 12x - x = 11x ) waffles, so before the wolf ate half, she had ( 14x ) waffles.Thus, the initial number of waffles ( N ) is ( 14x ). Since ( x ) must be an integer, ( N ) must be a multiple of 14. Among the given options, the only number that definitely divides 14 is 7.[boxed{D}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so here&#39;s this problem about Little Red Riding Hood delivering waffles to three grannies. Let me try to parse it step by step. Let me see. She starts with a basket full of waffles. Before she enters each granny&#39;s house, the Big Bad Wolf eats half of the waffles in her basket. Then she delivers the same number of waffles to each granny. When she leaves the third granny&#39;s house, she has no waffles left. The question is which of the numbers (4, 5, 6, 7, 9) definitely divides the number of waffles she started with. The options are A to E, with the numbers given. So, we need to figure out which one is a divisor of the starting number of waffles.Hmm. Let me think. Let&#39;s model this step by step. Maybe working backwards would help. Because she ends up with zero waffles after the third granny. So, if we reverse the process, we can figure out how many waffles she had at each step.Let me denote the number of waffles when she arrives at each granny&#39;s house as, say, W1, W2, W3, but actually, the process is: before each granny&#39;s house, the wolf eats half, then she delivers some waffles. Wait, let me clarify the sequence.The problem says: &quot;Just before she enters the house of each granny, the Big Bad Wolf eats half of the waffles in her basket. She delivers the same number of waffles to each granny. When she leaves the third granny&#39;s house, she has no waffles left.&quot;So, sequence for each granny is:1. Before entering the house, Wolf eats half the waffles.2. Then she delivers waffles to the granny. The number delivered is the same each time.After the third delivery, she has none left. So, starting from the initial number, let&#39;s call that N. Then, before the first granny&#39;s house, Wolf eats half, so she has N/2 left. Then she delivers, say, x waffles, so she has N/2 - x. Then before the second granny&#39;s house, Wolf eats half again: (N/2 - x)/2. Then she delivers x again, so ((N/2 - x)/2) - x. Then before the third granny&#39;s house, Wolf eats half again: [((N/2 - x)/2 - x)/2]. Then she delivers x, and has zero left. So, the final equation would be:[((N/2 - x)/2 - x)/2] - x = 0.Let me write that down step by step.Starting number: NAfter first wolf attack: N/2After delivering to first granny: N/2 - xAfter second wolf attack: (N/2 - x)/2After delivering to second granny: (N/2 - x)/2 - xAfter third wolf attack: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2After delivering to third granny: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x = 0So, we can solve this equation for N in terms of x, and then see which number divides N.Let me write this equation:[[[(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2] - x] = 0Let me work from the innermost brackets:First, after first granny: N becomes N/2 - xSecond, after second granny: (N/2 - x)/2 - xThird, after third granny: [(N/2 - x)/2 - x]/2 - x = 0So, let&#39;s write the equation:[( (N/2 - x)/2 - x ) / 2 ] - x = 0Let me solve this step by step.Let me denote each step:After first wolf: N1 = N / 2After first delivery: D1 = N1 - x = N/2 - xAfter second wolf: N2 = D1 / 2 = (N/2 - x)/2After second delivery: D2 = N2 - x = (N/2 - x)/2 - xAfter third wolf: N3 = D2 / 2 = [ (N/2 - x)/2 - x ] / 2After third delivery: D3 = N3 - x = [ (N/2 - x)/2 - x ] / 2 - x = 0So, D3 = 0. Let&#39;s write that equation:[ ( (N/2 - x)/2 - x ) / 2 ] - x = 0Let me compute this expression step by step. Let&#39;s start from the innermost parentheses.First innermost expression: (N/2 - x)/2 - xLet me compute (N/2 - x)/2 first. That is N/4 - x/2.Then subtract x: N/4 - x/2 - x = N/4 - (3x)/2Then, the next step is to divide that by 2: (N/4 - (3x)/2) / 2 = N/8 - (3x)/4Then subtract x: N/8 - (3x)/4 - x = N/8 - (7x)/4So, setting that equal to zero:N/8 - (7x)/4 = 0Multiply both sides by 8:N - 14x = 0Therefore, N = 14xSo, the starting number N is 14 times the number of waffles delivered to each granny, x.But x must be an integer, because you can&#39;t deliver a fraction of a waffle. So, N must be a multiple of 14. So, 14 divides N.But looking at the options given: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. The only divisor here is 7, since 14 is 2*7. So, 7 divides N. Therefore, the answer is D) 7.Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me verify.Starting with N.First, Wolf eats half: N becomes N/2.Delivers x: N/2 - x.Second, Wolf eats half: (N/2 - x)/2.Delivers x: (N/2 - x)/2 - x.Third, Wolf eats half: [ (N/2 - x)/2 - x ] / 2.Delivers x: [ (N/2 - x)/2 - x ] / 2 - x = 0.So, let me compute step by step:Start: NAfter first wolf and delivery: (N/2) - xAfter second wolf and delivery: [ (N/2 - x ) / 2 ] - xAfter third wolf and delivery: [ ( (N/2 - x ) / 2 - x ) / 2 ] - x = 0So, let&#39;s solve the equation:[ ( (N/2 - x ) / 2 - x ) / 2 ] - x = 0Let me compute the innermost part:( N/2 - x ) / 2 = N/4 - x/2Then subtract x: N/4 - x/2 - x = N/4 - 3x/2Divide by 2: (N/4 - 3x/2)/2 = N/8 - 3x/4Subtract x: N/8 - 3x/4 - x = N/8 - 7x/4 = 0Multiply both sides by 8: N - 14x = 0 =&gt; N = 14xTherefore, N must be a multiple of 14. So, 14 divides N, which implies that 7 divides N because 14 is 2*7. So, 7 is a divisor of N, which is one of the options (option D). The other options: 4,5,6,9 – we can&#39;t be sure. For example, if x is 1, then N is 14, which is divisible by 14, but not by 4,5,6,9. If x is 2, N is 28, which is divisible by 4 and 7. If x is 3, N is 42, divisible by 6,7. So, depending on x, N can be divisible by different numbers, but 7 is always a divisor. So, 7 is the correct answer.Therefore, the answer is D) 7.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Let ( N ) be the initial number of waffles Little Red Riding Hood starts with. The Big Bad Wolf eats half of the waffles before she enters each granny&#39;s house, and she delivers ( x ) waffles to each granny. When she leaves the third granny&#39;s house, she has no waffles left. We need to determine which number definitely divides ( N ).1. First Granny:   - Wolf eats half: ( frac{N}{2} )   - Delivers ( x ) waffles: ( frac{N}{2} - x )2. Second Granny:   - Wolf eats half: ( frac{frac{N}{2} - x}{2} = frac{N}{4} - frac{x}{2} )   - Delivers ( x ) waffles: ( frac{N}{4} - frac{x}{2} - x = frac{N}{4} - frac{3x}{2} )3. Third Granny:   - Wolf eats half: ( frac{frac{N}{4} - frac{3x}{2}}{2} = frac{N}{8} - frac{3x}{4} )   - Delivers ( x ) waffles: ( frac{N}{8} - frac{3x}{4} - x = frac{N}{8} - frac{7x}{4} )Setting the final equation to zero:[frac{N}{8} - frac{7x}{4} = 0]Multiplying both sides by 8:[N - 14x = 0 implies N = 14x]Since ( N = 14x ), ( N ) must be a multiple of 14. The divisors of 14 are 2 and 7. Among the given options, 7 is the only divisor. Therefore, the number of waffles she started with is definitely divisible by 7.[boxed{D}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf74bc24></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf74bc24><span class="icon" data-v-cf74bc24>🔑:</span>19. D Let x be the number of waffles Little Red Riding Hood delivered to each of the grannies. She delivered x waffles to the third granny and so, since the Big Bad Wolf eats half of the waffles in her basket just before she enters each granny&#39;s house, she must have arrived with 2 x waffles. Therefore she had 3 x waffles before giving the second granny her waffles and hence had 2 times 3 x=6 x waffles when she arrived. Therefore she had 6 x+x=7 x waffles before giving the first granny her waffles and hence had 2 times 7 x=14 x waffles in her basket when she arrived. Hence, since we do not know the value of x, the only numbers that definitely divide the number of waffles she started with are the numbers that divide 14 , namely 1,2,7 and 14. Therefore, of the options given, only 7 definitely divides the number of waffles she started with.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-edca29a5 data-v-cf74bc24><div class="review" data-v-cf74bc24><div class="review-title" data-v-cf74bc24><span class="icon" data-v-cf74bc24>❓:</span>1.

So, we have four cards, each with a letter on one side and a number on the other. The rule given is: if a card has the letter R on one side, then the other side must be the number 2. My task is to figure out which cards need to be flipped to ensure there&#39;s no violation of this rule. The options are A, B, C, or D (none of the above). First, let me visualize the cards. The problem mentions Figure 1, which I can&#39;t see, but typically in these kinds of problems, each card has one visible side. Let me assume the visible sides are as follows, based on common similar problems: - Card (a): Shows the letter R.- Card (b): Shows the letter S.- Card (c): Shows the number 2.- Card (d): Shows the number 7.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify what&#39;s shown on each card. Hmm, maybe I need to check that again. The user says &quot;as shown in Figure 1,&quot; but since I don&#39;t have the figure, perhaps the problem is a standard one. Let me recall the classic Wason selection task, which this seems to resemble. In that task, typically, the visible sides are R, S, 2, and 7. So maybe that&#39;s the setup here. So if that&#39;s the case, the four cards are:(a) R(b) S(c) 2(d) 7And the rule is: If a card has R on one side, then it must have 2 on the other. To check for violations, we need to verify two things: 1. Any card showing R must have 2 on the other side. 2. Any card not showing 2 on the visible side must not have R on the hidden side. Wait, no. Let me think. The contrapositive of the rule &quot;If R then 2&quot; is &quot;If not 2, then not R.&quot; So, to ensure the rule holds, we need to check any card that could potentially violate the rule. So possible violations could be:- A card with R on one side and something other than 2 on the other.- A card with a number not equal to 2 on one side and R on the other.Therefore, we need to flip cards that could possibly violate the rule in either direction. Looking at the visible sides:(a) R: If R is on one side, we need to check if 2 is on the other. So we must flip (a).(b) S: Since the rule is about R, not S, we don&#39;t need to check S. The rule doesn&#39;t say anything about S. Even if the other side is 2 or not, it doesn&#39;t violate the given rule.(c) 2: If the visible side is 2, the rule doesn&#39;t require anything about the other side. The rule is &quot;If R then 2,&quot; not &quot;If 2 then R.&quot; So even if the other side is not R, that&#39;s fine. The only problem would be if there&#39;s an R without a 2. So flipping (c) isn&#39;t necessary.(d) 7: Here, the visible side is 7, which is not 2. The contrapositive of the rule is &quot;If not 2, then not R.&quot; So if a card has a number that&#39;s not 2, we need to ensure it doesn&#39;t have R on the other side. Therefore, we must flip (d) to check if there&#39;s an R there. Therefore, the cards that need to be flipped are (a) and (d). Looking at the options:A: (a)B: (a), (c)C: (a), (d)D: None of the aboveSo the correct answer should be option C: (a) and (d). Wait, let me just double-check. For (a): R is visible. Must check if 2 is on the back. If not, violation. So definitely flip (a).For (d): 7 is visible. Since it&#39;s not 2, we need to check that the other side isn&#39;t R. Because if it&#39;s R, then since the visible side is 7, which is not 2, that would violate the rule. So must flip (d).For (c): 2 is visible. The rule says if R then 2, but it doesn&#39;t say that if 2 then R. So even if the other side is, say, S, that&#39;s okay. The rule is only violated if there&#39;s an R without a 2, not necessarily a 2 without an R. So (c) doesn&#39;t need to be flipped.For (b): S is visible. The rule is about R, so S is irrelevant. Doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s on the other side.Therefore, yes, the answer should be C: (a) and (d). So the correct choice is option C.&lt;/think&gt;To determine which cards need to be flipped to ensure compliance with the rule (&quot;if a card has R on one side, the other side must be 2&quot;), we analyze potential violations:1. Card (a) shows R:     The rule explicitly states that R must have 2 on the reverse. Flipping (a) is necessary to confirm no violation (e.g., R paired with a number other than 2).2. Card (d) shows 7:     The contrapositive of the rule (&quot;if not 2, then not R&quot;) requires checking that any card with a non-2 number does not have R on the hidden side. Flipping (d) ensures 7 is not paired with R.3. Cards (b) and (c) do not require flipping:     - Card (b) shows S, which is unrelated to the rule.     - Card (c) shows 2, and the rule does not mandate 2 to be paired with R (only the converse).Thus, the necessary cards to flip are (a) and (d). The correct answer is boxed{C}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so there&#39;s this problem about four cards, each with a letter on one side and a number on the other. The rule given is that if a card has the letter R on one side, then the other side must be the number 2. My task is to figure out which cards need to be flipped to ensure there are no violations of this rule. The options are (A) card (a), (B) cards (a) and (c), (C) cards (a) and (d), or (D) none of the above. First, let me visualize the problem. Since there&#39;s a figure mentioned (Figure 1), but I can&#39;t see it, I need to assume what the cards might show. Typically, in these logic puzzles, you have cards showing different letters and numbers. For example, maybe card (a) has an R, card (b) has a 2, card (c) has a B, and card (d) has a 5. But since the actual figure isn&#39;t provided, I need to work with the standard setup of such problems. Wait, the user hasn&#39;t actually provided the letters and numbers on the visible sides of the cards. Hmm. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the visible sides are specified. Since the user mentions &quot;as shown in Figure 1&quot; but didn&#39;t include the figure, perhaps it&#39;s a classic version of this problem. Let me recall. The standard Wason selection task usually has cards showing, for example, R, B, 2, and 5. The rule is &quot;If there&#39;s an R on one side, there&#39;s a 2 on the other.&quot; So you need to check R to see if there&#39;s a 2 on the other side, and check 5 to see if there&#39;s an R on the other side. Because if there&#39;s a 5, and the other side is R, that would violate the rule. But since the problem is presented here as a multiple-choice question with options (A) through (D), and the possible choices are combinations of (a), (c), and (d), I need to figure out which ones correspond to the R and the number not 2. Assuming that in the figure, card (a) has R visible, card (b) has something else, maybe a different letter, card (c) has 2 visible, and card (d) has a 5 visible. Then, according to the standard logic, you need to flip R (to check for 2) and flip 5 (to check there&#39;s no R on the other side). So if (a) is R and (d) is 5, then you need to flip (a) and (d). Therefore, the answer would be (C) (a) and (d). But wait, let me make sure. Let&#39;s break down the rule again: &quot;If a card has R on one side, then the other side must be 2.&quot; This is a conditional statement: R → 2. To verify this rule, we need to check cases where the antecedent is true (i.e., cards that show R) to ensure the consequent is true (i.e., the other side is 2). Additionally, we need to check cases where the consequent is false (i.e., cards that don&#39;t show 2) to ensure the antecedent is false (i.e., the other side isn&#39;t R). So, first, any card showing R must be flipped to check if there&#39;s a 2 on the other side. Second, any card showing a number that isn&#39;t 2 must be flipped to check there&#39;s no R on the other side. Cards showing letters other than R don&#39;t need to be flipped because the rule doesn&#39;t say anything about other letters—they can have any number. Similarly, cards showing 2 don&#39;t need to be flipped because the rule doesn&#39;t prohibit R from having other numbers; it only states that R must have 2. So if a card has 2, the other side could be anything, including R or another letter, which wouldn&#39;t violate the rule. Therefore, in the standard problem, if the visible sides are R, B, 2, and 5, you need to flip R (card a) and 5 (card d). So answer (C) would be (a) and (d). However, the options given here are (A) (a), (B) (a), (c), (C) (a), (d), (D) none. So if in the original figure, card (c) is something else, like B, and card (d) is 5, then (a) and (d) need to be flipped, so answer (C). But if the figure is different, maybe the answer changes. Wait, the problem states &quot;the following 4 cards need to be flipped&quot;—but without seeing the figure, I have to rely on standard setups. Alternatively, perhaps the original figure is structured differently. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the visible sides are as follows: (a) R, (b) 2, (c) B, (d) 3. Then to check the rule &quot;if R then 2,&quot; you need to flip R to check for 2, and flip 3 to check there&#39;s no R. But if the visible numbers are 2 and another number, say 5, then flipping the 5 is necessary. Wait, the problem is presented as a multiple-choice question where the answer is (C) (a), (d). That suggests that in the figure, the visible sides are R (a), some letter (b), some number (c), and another number (d) which is not 2. Therefore, to check for violations, you need to flip R (a) to check for 2, and flip the non-2 number (d) to check for R. So if in the figure, the visible sides are: (a) R, (b) K, (c) 2, (d) 7, for example. Then you need to flip (a) and (d). Hence, answer (C). Alternatively, maybe (c) is 2, but the rule only concerns R. So if (c) is 2, you don&#39;t need to flip it because the rule doesn&#39;t state that only R can have 2. It just says that if there&#39;s an R, it must have a 2. So 2 can be on the other side of any letter, which is allowed. Therefore, the conclusion is that to verify the rule, you must check any card with R (to confirm 2 on the reverse) and any card with a number not equal to 2 (to confirm there&#39;s no R on the reverse). Given that, if in the figure, the visible sides are R (a), some other letter (like c), 2 (maybe card b), and another number like 5 (card d), then you have to flip (a) and (d). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) (a), (d). But wait, in the options given, (C) is (a), (d), which would correspond to flipping R and the non-2 number. So unless there&#39;s a trick here. Wait, maybe the figure has card (c) showing a number, but let&#39;s think. If card (c) shows a letter, say B, then you don&#39;t need to flip it because the rule only concerns R. If card (c) shows a number, say 2, then you don&#39;t need to flip it because the rule doesn&#39;t say anything about numbers needing to have R. If card (c) shows a number other than 2, then you would need to flip it. But if in the figure, (c) is a letter, then no. Assuming the figure is the standard one where (a) is R, (b) is a different letter, (c) is 2, and (d) is a different number like 5. Then you need to flip (a) and (d). Therefore, answer (C). But in the problem statement here, the options are: (A) (a)(B) (a), (c)(C) (a), (d)(D) None of the aboveSo if (C) is (a) and (d), then that&#39;s the correct answer. However, perhaps in the figure, card (d) is a letter, not a number. Then, maybe you don&#39;t need to flip it. Wait, but the rule is about letters implying numbers, not numbers implying letters. Wait, no: the rule is &quot;if there&#39;s an R on one side, then the other side must be 2.&quot; So the contrapositive is &quot;if the other side is not 2, then there isn&#39;t an R.&quot; So to check for violations, you need to check any card that shows R (to make sure the other side is 2) and any card that shows a number not equal to 2 (to make sure the other side isn&#39;t R). Therefore, if a card shows a number that&#39;s not 2, like 5, you have to flip it to check that the other side isn&#39;t R. Therefore, the answer is (a) and (d), assuming (d) is a non-2 number. Therefore, the answer should be (C). But the user hasn&#39;t provided the figure, so I have to assume. But since the original problem in Chinese (assuming this is a translation) might have a specific figure. However, given that in the Wason selection task, the answer is typically the card with the antecedent (R) and the card with the negation of the consequent (not 2). Therefore, (a) and (d) if (a) is R and (d) is not 2. Therefore, unless there&#39;s a trick, I think the answer is (C). Wait, but maybe in the figure, card (d) is a letter. For example, if the visible sides are (a) R, (b) 2, (c) B, (d) K. Then, you only need to flip (a), because the rule is about letters implying numbers, not numbers implying letters. So if a card has a number, even if it&#39;s not 2, like if there was a card with 5, you need to flip it. But in this case, (d) is a letter, so you don&#39;t need to flip it. Wait, but in this example, the number 2 is on (b), but the rule doesn&#39;t care about numbers; it cares about letters. So if (d) is a letter, like K, you don&#39;t need to flip it, because the rule is about R, not about K. Wait, maybe the figure has two letters and two numbers. For example: Card (a): R (letter side up)Card (b): 3 (number side up)Card (c): B (letter side up)Card (d): 2 (number side up)In this case, to check the rule, you need to flip R (a) to check for 2, and flip 3 (b) to check for not R. However, if the visible numbers are 3 and 2, then you need to flip 3. But in the options given here, there&#39;s no option including (b). So maybe the figure has card (d) as a number that&#39;s not 2. Alternatively, maybe the four cards are:(a) R(b) T(c) 2(d) 7Then you need to flip (a) and (d). Therefore, (C) (a) and (d). But if the figure shows:(a) R(b) 2(c) K(d) 5Then same logic: flip R (a) and 5 (d). So (C). Alternatively, if (d) is a letter, then no. But if the options are (C) (a), (d), then likely (d) is a number. So the answer is (C). Therefore, I think the correct answer is (C). So the answer is boxed{C}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine which cards need to be flipped to ensure there are no violations of the rule &quot;when one side of the card is the letter ( R ), its other side must be the number 2,&quot; we need to consider the logical implications of the rule. 1. Checking the letter ( R ): Any card showing ( R ) must be flipped to verify the other side is 2. This directly checks the rule&#39;s requirement.2. Checking non-2 numbers: Any card showing a number other than 2 must be flipped to ensure there is no ( R ) on the other side. This checks the contrapositive of the rule, which states that if the other side is not 2, it cannot be ( R ).Assuming the cards visible sides are ( R ), a different letter (e.g., ( B )), 2, and a non-2 number (e.g., 5), the necessary cards to flip are:- The card showing ( R ) (to check for 2).- The card showing a non-2 number (to check for absence of ( R )).Given the options, the correct choice is ((mathrm{C})) which specifies flipping cards (a) and (d), corresponding to ( R ) and the non-2 number.

C.Thought 1: Turn over each card one by one, imagining the various possibilities on the back, which can lead to the conclusion that (b) and (c) do not need to be flipped. To aid understanding, imagine that “the red light is on” represents “one side is written with the English letter R”, and “pedestrians do not cross the road” represents “the other side is written with the number 2”. Checking whether the rule is violated becomes checking whether “pedestrians crossing the road when the red light is on” violates traffic rules (when the red light is not on, crossing or not crossing the road does not violate the traffic rules).Thought 2: Understand the “rule” as: the conditional statement “if p then q” is true, where p being true represents “one side is written with the English letter R”, and q being true represents “the other side is written with the number 2”.

So, we have triangle ABC where angle C is three times angle A. The sides opposite angles A and C are given as a = 27 and c = 48 respectively. We need to find the length of side b. Hmm, okay.First, let me recall some triangle theorems. Since we have two angles related and their opposite sides given, maybe the Law of Sines could help here. The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. So, that is:[frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}]Given that angle C is three times angle A, let&#39;s denote angle A as ( alpha ). Then angle C would be ( 3alpha ). Since the sum of angles in a triangle is ( 180^circ ), angle B can be found as:[alpha + B + 3alpha = 180^circ][B = 180^circ - 4alpha]So, angles are ( A = alpha ), ( B = 180^circ - 4alpha ), and ( C = 3alpha ).Now, using the Law of Sines:[frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C}]Plugging in the known values:[frac{27}{sin alpha} = frac{48}{sin 3alpha}]Hmm, okay. So, we can solve for ( alpha ). Let&#39;s write that equation again:[frac{27}{sin alpha} = frac{48}{sin 3alpha}]Cross-multiplying gives:[27 sin 3alpha = 48 sin alpha]Now, I need to compute ( sin 3alpha ). I remember there&#39;s a trigonometric identity for ( sin 3theta ). Let me recall. The triple angle identity:[sin 3theta = 3sin theta - 4sin^3 theta]So, substituting that into our equation:[27 (3sin alpha - 4sin^3 alpha) = 48 sin alpha]Let&#39;s distribute the 27:[81sin alpha - 108sin^3 alpha = 48sin alpha]Now, subtract 48 sin α from both sides:[81sin alpha - 48sin alpha - 108sin^3 alpha = 0][33sin alpha - 108sin^3 alpha = 0]Factor out sin α:[sin α (33 - 108sin^2 α) = 0]This gives two possibilities:1. ( sin α = 0 ): But α is an angle in a triangle, so it can&#39;t be 0. Disregard this solution.2. ( 33 - 108sin^2 α = 0 )Solving the second equation:[108sin^2 α = 33][sin^2 α = frac{33}{108}][sin^2 α = frac{11}{36}][sin α = sqrt{frac{11}{36}} = frac{sqrt{11}}{6}]Since α is an acute angle (because 3α must be less than 180°, so α &lt; 60°), sine is positive. So, we take the positive root.Therefore, ( sin α = frac{sqrt{11}}{6} ).Now, we can find angle α. But maybe we don&#39;t need the angle itself, but rather other trigonometric ratios. Let&#39;s see. Next, perhaps we can find angle B and then use the Law of Sines again to find side b.But let&#39;s see. Alternatively, maybe use Law of Cosines at some point? Let&#39;s check.Alternatively, after finding sin α, perhaps we can find cos α using the identity:[cos^2 α = 1 - sin^2 α = 1 - frac{11}{36} = frac{25}{36}][cos α = frac{5}{6}]Since α is acute, cosine is positive.Now, angle C is 3α. Let&#39;s compute sin C, which is sin 3α. Wait, we had earlier sin 3α from the triple angle formula. Alternatively, since we already have sin α and cos α, perhaps we can use another identity for sin 3α. Let&#39;s recall:[sin 3α = 3sin α - 4sin^3 α]But we can compute sin 3α using another identity:[sin 3α = 3sin α - 4sin^3 α]Alternatively, using:[sin 3α = 2sin 2α cos α + sin α cos 2α]But maybe the first one is easier. Let&#39;s compute it.We already have sin α = √11 /6. Let&#39;s compute sin 3α:First, compute sin 3α:[sin 3α = 3sin α - 4sin^3 α]Plug in sin α = √11/6:Compute 3 sin α = 3*(√11/6) = √11/2Compute 4 sin^3 α = 4*( (√11)^3 / 6^3 ) = 4*(11√11 / 216 ) = (44√11)/216 = (11√11)/54Thus, sin 3α = √11/2 - 11√11/54Convert to common denominator:√11/2 = 27√11/54So, sin 3α = 27√11/54 - 11√11/54 = 16√11/54 = 8√11/27Therefore, sin 3α = 8√11/27Wait, but earlier we had from the equation 27 sin 3α = 48 sin α, so 27*(8√11/27) = 8√11, and 48 sin α = 48*(√11/6) = 8√11. So, that checks out. Good, consistency here.So, sin 3α is 8√11/27.Now, perhaps proceed to find the other angles or sides.We need to find side b. Let&#39;s recall that using the Law of Sines, we can relate all sides. Since we know angles in terms of α, and sides a and c, maybe angle B can be expressed in terms of α as 180° - 4α, so we can find sin B and then use the Law of Sines.So, sin B = sin (180° - 4α) = sin 4α, because sin(180° - x) = sin x.Therefore, sin B = sin 4α.So, using Law of Sines:[frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}]We can use the ratio:[frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}]So,[b = frac{a sin B}{sin A}]We know a = 27, sin A = √11/6, sin B = sin 4α. So, need to compute sin 4α.Alternatively, perhaps first compute angle α numerically, then compute 4α and find sin 4α. But that might involve decimal approximations. Alternatively, use trigonometric identities to compute sin 4α in terms of sin α and cos α.Let&#39;s try the identity approach. Let&#39;s compute sin 4α.We can write sin 4α as 2 sin 2α cos 2α, and then express sin 2α and cos 2α in terms of sin α and cos α.Alternatively, use double angle formulas step by step.First, compute sin 2α:[sin 2α = 2 sin α cos α = 2*(√11/6)*(5/6) = (2*√11*5)/36 = (10√11)/36 = (5√11)/18]Then cos 2α:[cos 2α = 2 cos^2 α - 1 = 2*(25/36) - 1 = 50/36 - 36/36 = 14/36 = 7/18]Alternatively, cos 2α = 1 - 2 sin^2 α = 1 - 2*(11/36) = 1 - 22/36 = 14/36 = 7/18. Same result.Now, sin 4α = 2 sin 2α cos 2α = 2*(5√11/18)*(7/18) = (70√11)/324 = (35√11)/162Therefore, sin 4α = 35√11 / 162Thus, sin B = sin 4α = 35√11 / 162Therefore, plugging back into the expression for b:[b = frac{27 * (35√11 / 162)}{ (√11 /6) }]Simplify this step by step.First, numerator: 27 * (35√11 / 162)Denominator: (√11 /6 )So, the entire expression is:[b = frac{27 * 35√11 / 162}{ √11 /6 }]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: 27 * 35√11 / 162Divide 27 by 162: 27/162 = 1/6So, numerator becomes (1/6)*35√11 = 35√11 /6Denominator: √11 /6Thus, the expression is:(35√11 /6 ) divided by (√11 /6 )Which is equal to (35√11 /6 ) * (6 /√11 ) = 35√11 *6 / (6 *√11 ) = 35The √11 cancels out, 6 cancels with 6, leaving 35.Therefore, b = 35.Wait, that&#39;s neat. So, b equals 35? Let me verify this calculation again, because that seems straightforward.Breaking it down:Numerator when calculating b: 27 * (35√11 /162) = (27/162)*35√11 = (1/6)*35√11 = 35√11 /6Denominator: √11 /6So, dividing them: (35√11 /6 ) / (√11 /6 ) = 35√11 /6 * 6 /√11 = 35*(√11 /√11)*(6/6)=35*1*1=35Yes, that&#39;s correct. So, b = 35.Therefore, the length of side b is 35.Let me check if there&#39;s another way to approach this, maybe using the Law of Cosines instead, to verify.Alternatively, once we have angle α, we could compute all angles and then use Law of Sines or Law of Cosines.Wait, another thought: If we compute angle α, then compute angle B, and then use Law of Sines.We have sin α = √11 /6 ≈ 0.527. So, α ≈ arcsin(√11 /6). Let&#39;s compute that numerically.First, √11 ≈ 3.3166, so √11 /6 ≈ 0.5528. Wait, wait, √11 is approximately 3.3166, so divided by 6 is approximately 0.5528. Then arcsin(0.5528) ≈ 33.56 degrees.Therefore, angle α ≈ 33.56°, angle C = 3α ≈ 100.68°, angle B = 180 - 4α ≈ 180 - 134.24 ≈ 45.76°.Then, using Law of Sines: a/sin A = 27 / sin(33.56°). Compute sin(33.56°): approx 0.5528 (matches earlier value). So, 27 / 0.5528 ≈ 48.83. Then, c/sin C = 48 / sin(100.68°). sin(100.68°) ≈ sin(90 + 10.68) ≈ cos(10.68°) ≈ 0.9829. So, 48 / 0.9829 ≈ 48.83. So, that&#39;s consistent.Then, b = sin B * (a / sin A) ≈ sin(45.76°) * 48.83 ≈ 0.715 * 48.83 ≈ 34.92 ≈ 35. So, approximately 35. So, that corroborates the exact value.Alternatively, use Law of Cosines on side b. If we can find angle B, then compute b.But since we already found through Law of Sines that b =35, and numerical approximation supports it, that&#39;s solid.Alternatively, let&#39;s try using Law of Cosines to compute b. For that, we need two sides and the included angle. But we know sides a and c, but the angle between them is angle B. Wait, in triangle ABC, side a is opposite angle A, which is BC, side b is opposite angle B, which is AC, and side c is opposite angle C, which is AB.Wait, perhaps better to sketch the triangle:Vertices: A, B, C.Side a = BC =27, opposite angle A.Side b = AC = ?, opposite angle B.Side c = AB =48, opposite angle C.So, to use Law of Cosines on side b, which is AC, we need sides AB and BC, and angle B. Wait, angle B is at vertex B, which is between sides AB and BC. So, Law of Cosines formula for side AC (which is b):[b^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2*AB*BC*cos B]So, plugging in:[b^2 = 48^2 + 27^2 - 2*48*27*cos B]But we need cos B. If we can compute angle B, then compute cos B. Since angle B = 180 - 4α, and we have angle B ≈ 45.76°, cos B ≈ cos(45.76°) ≈ 0.697. But this is approximate. Let&#39;s compute it exactly.Alternatively, angle B is 4α, but wait no: angle B = 180 - 4α. Wait, sin B = sin 4α, as we had earlier. But angle B is 180 - 4α, so cos B = -cos 4α.Wait, since cos(180 - x) = -cos x, so cos B = cos(180 -4α) = -cos4α.Therefore, to compute cos B, we need to compute -cos4α.But if we can compute cos4α, then we can get cos B.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute cos4α using double angle formulas.We already have cos2α =7/18, sin2α=5√11/18.So, cos4α = 2cos^2 2α -1 = 2*(7/18)^2 -1 = 2*(49/324) -1 = 98/324 -1 = 98/324 - 324/324 = -226/324 = -113/162Therefore, cos4α = -113/162Therefore, cos B = -cos4α = 113/162Therefore, cos B = 113/162Therefore, plugging into Law of Cosines:[b^2 = 48^2 + 27^2 - 2*48*27*(113/162)]Compute each term:48^2 = 230427^2 = 7292*48*27 = 2*1296 = 2592Now, 2592*(113/162) = Let&#39;s compute 2592 /162 first.2592 ÷ 162: 162*15 = 2430, 2592 -2430=162, so 15 + 1 =16. So, 2592/162=16.Therefore, 2592*(113/162)=16*113=1808Therefore, b^2 =2304 +729 -1808= (2304 +729)=3033 -1808=1225Therefore, b=√1225=35So, that&#39;s another way to arrive at b=35. This confirms the answer.Therefore, whether using Law of Sines with angle relationships and trigonometric identities, or using Law of Cosines after computing the necessary cosine value, we arrive at b=35. The numerical approximation also supports this. Thus, the answer is 35.Final AnswerThe length of side ( b ) is boxed{35}.&lt;/think&gt;Given (triangle ABC) with (angle C = 3 angle A), (a = 27), and (c = 48), we need to find the length of side (b).1. Angle Relationships:   - Let (angle A = alpha).   - Then, (angle C = 3alpha).   - The remaining angle (angle B = 180^circ - 4alpha).2. Law of Sines:   - Using the given sides and angles:     [     frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{c}{sin 3alpha}     ]   - Substituting (a = 27) and (c = 48):     [     frac{27}{sin alpha} = frac{48}{sin 3alpha}     ]   - Cross-multiplying and using the triple angle identity (sin 3alpha = 3sin alpha - 4sin^3 alpha):     [     27 sin 3alpha = 48 sin alpha     ]     [     27 (3sin alpha - 4sin^3 alpha) = 48 sin alpha     ]     [     81sin alpha - 108sin^3 alpha = 48sin alpha     ]     [     33sin alpha - 108sin^3 alpha = 0     ]     [     sin alpha (33 - 108sin^2 alpha) = 0     ]   - Solving for (sin alpha):     [     108sin^2 alpha = 33 implies sin^2 alpha = frac{11}{36} implies sin alpha = frac{sqrt{11}}{6}     ]3. Finding (sin 3alpha):   - Using the triple angle identity:     [     sin 3alpha = 3sin alpha - 4sin^3 alpha = frac{8sqrt{11}}{27}     ]4. Law of Sines for Side (b):   - (angle B = 180^circ - 4alpha), so (sin B = sin 4alpha).   - Using double angle identities:     [     sin 2alpha = frac{5sqrt{11}}{18}, quad cos 2alpha = frac{7}{18}     ]     [     sin 4alpha = 2sin 2alpha cos 2alpha = frac{35sqrt{11}}{162}     ]   - Applying Law of Sines:     [     frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{b}{sin B}     ]     [     b = frac{27 cdot frac{35sqrt{11}}{162}}{frac{sqrt{11}}{6}} = 35     ]5. Verification with Law of Cosines:   - Compute (cos B) using (cos 4alpha = -frac{113}{162}):     [     b^2 = 48^2 + 27^2 - 2 cdot 48 cdot 27 cdot left(-frac{113}{162}right)     ]     [     b^2 = 2304 + 729 + 1808 = 1225 implies b = 35     ]Thus, the length of side (b) is (boxed{35}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this triangle ABC where angle C is three times angle A. The sides opposite angles A and C are given as a=27 and c=48 respectively. I need to find the length of side b. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. So, if angle C is three times angle A, maybe I can express all angles in terms of angle A and set up an equation. Let&#39;s denote angle A as x degrees. Then angle C would be 3x degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, angle B would be 180° - x - 3x = 180° - 4x. So angle B is 180° - 4x.Now, I also recall the Law of Sines, which states that a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). Here, sides a, b, c are opposite angles A, B, C respectively. Since we know sides a and c, and their opposite angles, maybe I can use the Law of Sines to relate them and find angle A first.Let&#39;s write down the ratio from the Law of Sines for sides a and c:a / sin(A) = c / sin(C)Plugging in the known values:27 / sin(x) = 48 / sin(3x)Hmm, so 27/sin(x) = 48/sin(3x). I need to solve for x here. To do this, I can cross-multiply:27 * sin(3x) = 48 * sin(x)Now, I remember that sin(3x) can be expanded using trigonometric identities. The formula for sin(3x) is 3 sin x - 4 sin^3 x. Let me verify that... yes, using the triple-angle identity: sin(3θ) = 3 sin θ - 4 sin³ θ. So substituting that in:27 * (3 sin x - 4 sin³ x) = 48 sin xLet me distribute the 27 on the left side:81 sin x - 108 sin³ x = 48 sin xNow, subtract 48 sin x from both sides to bring all terms to one side:81 sin x - 48 sin x - 108 sin³ x = 0That simplifies to:33 sin x - 108 sin³ x = 0Factor out sin x:sin x (33 - 108 sin² x) = 0So, either sin x = 0 or 33 - 108 sin² x = 0.But in a triangle, angles can&#39;t be 0°, so sin x = 0 is not possible. Therefore, we focus on the equation:33 - 108 sin² x = 0Solving for sin² x:108 sin² x = 33sin² x = 33 / 108Simplify the fraction:Divide numerator and denominator by 3:11 / 36So sin² x = 11/36Take square root:sin x = √(11)/6Since angle x is between 0° and 180°, and in a triangle, specifically acute if all angles are less than 90°, but given that angle C is 3x, we need to make sure that 3x is less than 180°, so x &lt; 60°. Therefore, x is acute, and sin x is positive. So sin x = √11 / 6.Now, we can find angle x by taking the inverse sine:x = arcsin(√11 / 6)But maybe we don&#39;t need to compute the actual angle in degrees. Instead, perhaps we can use this information to find side b.First, let&#39;s recall that side b is opposite angle B, which is 180° - 4x. So angle B is 180° - 4x. The sine of angle B is sin(180° - 4x) = sin(4x) because sin(180° - θ) = sin θ. Therefore, sin(B) = sin(4x).So using the Law of Sines again:a / sin(A) = b / sin(B)Which gives:27 / sin(x) = b / sin(4x)Therefore, solving for b:b = 27 * sin(4x) / sin(x)We already have sin(x) = √11 / 6, so let&#39;s compute sin(4x). To compute sin(4x), I can use the double-angle formulas. Let me recall that sin(4x) can be written as 2 sin(2x) cos(2x), and sin(2x) is 2 sin x cos x, and cos(2x) is 1 - 2 sin² x. Alternatively, sin(4x) can also be expressed as 2 sin(2x) cos(2x). Let me proceed step by step.First, find cos x. Since sin x = √11 / 6, then cos x = sqrt(1 - sin² x) = sqrt(1 - 11/36) = sqrt(25/36) = 5/6.So cos x = 5/6.Now, sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x = 2*(√11/6)*(5/6) = (10√11)/36 = (5√11)/18.Then, cos(2x) = 1 - 2 sin² x = 1 - 2*(11/36) = 1 - 22/36 = 14/36 = 7/18.Alternatively, cos(2x) could be 2 cos² x -1 = 2*(25/36) -1 = 50/36 - 36/36 = 14/36 = 7/18. So same result.Then, sin(4x) = 2 sin(2x) cos(2x) = 2*(5√11/18)*(7/18) = (70√11)/324 = (35√11)/162.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another identity for sin(4x). Let me check:sin(4x) = 2 sin(2x) cos(2x) = 2*(5√11/18)*(7/18) = as above.So sin(4x) = 35√11 / 162.Therefore, going back to the expression for b:b = 27 * sin(4x) / sin(x) = 27 * (35√11 / 162) / (√11 / 6)Let me compute this step by step.First, write 27 as 27/1.Multiply numerator: 27 * 35√11 = 945√11.Denominator: 162 * (√11 / 6) = (162/6) * √11 = 27 * √11.So now, the entire expression is (945√11) / (27√11)Simplify:The √11 in numerator and denominator cancels out.945 / 27 = 35.Wait, 27*35 = 945, yes. So 945 / 27 = 35.Therefore, b = 35.Wait, that&#39;s nice. So after simplifying all that, b comes out to 35. Let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting from sin(4x):We had sin(4x) = 35√11 / 162.Then, b = 27 * [35√11 / 162] divided by [√11 / 6].Which is 27 * (35√11 / 162) * (6 / √11).Multiplying the terms:27 * 35√11 * 6 / (162 * √11)The √11 terms cancel, leaving 27 * 35 * 6 / 162.Simplify numerator: 27 * 35 * 6 = 27 * 210 = 5670.Denominator: 162.5670 / 162: divide numerator and denominator by 54: 5670 / 54 = 105, 162 / 54 = 3. So 105 / 3 = 35. Yes, that works.So b = 35. That seems correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s think if there is another way to approach this problem, maybe using the Law of Cosines. Let me see if that can be done as a check.But since we have angles related and two sides, maybe the Law of Sines is the straightforward way. However, just to confirm, let&#39;s see.If I can find the angles, then maybe apply the Law of Cosines. But since we have angle A = x, angle C = 3x, angle B = 180 - 4x.We found sin x = √11 / 6, so x = arcsin(√11/6). Let&#39;s compute the measure of x approximately.Compute √11 ≈ 3.3166, so √11 / 6 ≈ 3.3166 / 6 ≈ 0.5528. Therefore, x ≈ arcsin(0.5528) ≈ 33.56 degrees.Therefore, angle C = 3x ≈ 100.69 degrees, angle B = 180 - 4x ≈ 180 - 134.25 ≈ 45.75 degrees.Now, using the Law of Sines, sides a=27, c=48, b=35. Let&#39;s check if the ratios hold.a / sin A = 27 / sin(33.56°). Compute sin(33.56°): approximately 0.5528, so 27 / 0.5528 ≈ 48.8.c / sin C = 48 / sin(100.69°). sin(100.69°) ≈ sin(90° + 10.69°) ≈ cos(10.69°) ≈ 0.9829. So 48 / 0.9829 ≈ 48.8.Similarly, b / sin B = 35 / sin(45.75°). sin(45.75°) ≈ sin(45° + 0.75°) ≈ √2/2 + some small addition. Let&#39;s approximate: sin(45°) ≈ 0.7071, sin(45.75°) ≈ sin(45° + 0.75°). Using the formula sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b. Let me compute it:sin(45° + 0.75°) = sin45 * cos0.75° + cos45 * sin0.75°Convert 0.75° to radians: 0.75 * π / 180 ≈ 0.0131 radians.So cos(0.75°) ≈ 0.9999, sin(0.75°) ≈ 0.0131.Therefore, sin(45.75°) ≈ (0.7071)(0.9999) + (0.7071)(0.0131) ≈ 0.7071 + 0.0093 ≈ 0.7164.So sin(45.75°) ≈ 0.7164. Then 35 / 0.7164 ≈ 48.8. So all ratios are approximately 48.8, which checks out. So the Law of Sines is consistent here.Alternatively, using Law of Cosines on side b. Let&#39;s try that.In triangle ABC, side b is between angles A and C. Wait, actually, side b is opposite angle B. So sides a, b, c are opposite angles A, B, C. So angle B is between sides a and c? Wait, no. The sides are opposite the respective angles. So if you have angle B, the side opposite is b. So the sides adjacent to angle B are a and c.But maybe it&#39;s better to apply the Law of Cosines on angle B.Wait, if I can compute angle B first, which we found to be approximately 45.75°, then using Law of Cosines:b² = a² + c² - 2ac cos BPlug in a=27, c=48, angle B≈45.75°, so cos B≈cos(45.75°). Let&#39;s compute cos(45.75°):Using the earlier approximation, angle B≈45.75°, so cos(45.75°)≈sqrt(1 - sin²(45.75°)). We had sin(45.75°)≈0.7164, so cos(45.75°)=sqrt(1 - 0.7164²)=sqrt(1 - 0.513)=sqrt(0.487)=approx 0.698.Therefore, cos B≈0.698.Then, b²=27² + 48² - 2*27*48*0.698Calculate each term:27² = 72948² = 23042*27*48 = 25922592*0.698 ≈2592*0.7 ≈1814.4 (approx). Since 0.698 is 0.7 - 0.002, so 2592*0.002=5.184, so subtract 5.184 from 1814.4: 1814.4 -5.184≈1809.216Therefore, b² ≈729 + 2304 - 1809.216 = 3033 - 1809.216 ≈1223.784Then b≈sqrt(1223.784)≈34.97≈35. Which matches our previous result. So that&#39;s a good check.Therefore, after both methods, Law of Sines and Law of Cosines, we get b≈35, which is likely the exact value, 35. So the answer is 35.I think that&#39;s thorough. Let me just check if there&#39;s another way using the Law of Cosines directly with angle A or C.Alternatively, maybe use the ratio from Law of Sines to find another side. But since we have two sides and the ratio of their opposite angles, and we found angle A, and then used that to find angle B and then side b, that&#39;s solid.Another check: Let&#39;s compute angles using exact values.We found sin x = √11 /6, so x = arcsin(√11 /6). Then angle B = 180 - 4x. Then, if we compute sin(4x), which we did using trigonometric identities, and then compute b = 27 * sin(4x)/sin(x), which simplifies to 35. All steps algebraically check out.Therefore, I&#39;m confident the answer is 35.Final AnswerThe length of side ( b ) is boxed{35}.&lt;/think&gt;Given (triangle ABC) with (angle C = 3angle A), (a = 27), and (c = 48), we need to find the length of side (b).1.
