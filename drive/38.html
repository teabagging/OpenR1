Each brick has 3 steps with width 2 and is made up of 12 unit cubes. Hmm, let me visualize this. A staircase with 3 steps, each step having a width of 2. That probably means each step is 2 units wide, 2 units deep, and 1 unit tall? Wait, but since it&#39;s a staircase, each subsequent step would be on top of the previous one. Let me try to break it down.If the first step is 2x2x1, then the second step, which is on top of the first, would maybe be 2x2x1 but shifted back by one unit? So that the total height becomes 3 units? Wait, but each brick is made of 12 unit cubes. Let&#39;s check. If each step is 2x2x1, that&#39;s 4 cubes per step. With 3 steps, that&#39;s 12 cubes. So each step is 2x2x1, stacked such that each subsequent step is placed on top of the previous one, but maybe offset to form the staircase. So the entire brick would have dimensions of 2 units in width, 2+1+1=4 units in depth? Wait, no. Wait, if each step is 2 units wide, and each step is 2 units deep, but the staircase effect comes from the vertical stacking. Wait, perhaps the brick is a 3D structure where each step is 2x2x1, but each subsequent step is placed one unit back from the previous one. Let me think.Imagine looking at the brick from the top. The first step is 2x2, then the second step is placed one unit behind the first, so the total depth would be 2 + 1 + 1 = 4? Wait, no. If each step is 2 units deep, and each subsequent step is shifted back by 1 unit, then the total depth would be 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 units. But that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the steps are 2 units wide and 2 units tall? Wait, but the problem says it&#39;s a staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2. Hmm, maybe I need to look for an image or better description.Alternatively, maybe the brick is 2 units in width, and each step is 2 units in length. So, for a 3-step staircase, the brick would occupy a 2 (width) x 3 (length) x 3 (height) space? But that would be 18 unit cubes, but the problem states it&#39;s made of 12 unit cubes. Hmm, so maybe each step is 2x1x1? But three steps would only be 6 units. Wait, this is confusing. Let me try again.The problem says: &quot;A staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2 is made of 12 unit cubes.&quot; So, each step must have width 2. Let&#39;s think in 3D. A staircase typically has steps that go up in one direction. Let&#39;s assume the brick is constructed such that each step is 2 units wide (along the x-axis), 1 unit deep (along the y-axis), and 1 unit high (along the z-axis). So, the first step is 2x1x1. The second step is placed on top of the first, but shifted 1 unit in depth, so it&#39;s also 2x1x1. Similarly, the third step is on top of the second, shifted another unit. So, the total dimensions of the brick would be 2 (width) x 3 (depth) x 3 (height)? Wait, but that would be 2x3x3 = 18 unit cubes. But the problem says it&#39;s made of 12. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe each step is 2 units in width and 2 units in depth. So, first step is 2x2x1. Then the second step is placed on top, shifted by 1 unit in depth and 1 unit in height. Wait, but that would make the total depth 2 + 1 = 3 and total height 1 + 1 = 2. Then the third step would be another 2x2x1 block shifted again? Let me compute the total cubes. Each step is 4 cubes, three steps would be 12. So yes, that makes sense. So the entire brick is 2 units wide, 4 units deep, and 3 units tall? Wait, how?If each step is 2x2x1, and each subsequent step is placed one unit back (in depth) and one unit up (in height), then:- First step: x=1-2, y=1-2, z=1- Second step: x=1-2, y=2-3, z=2- Third step: x=1-2, y=3-4, z=3So the total dimensions would be width=2, depth=4, height=3. Each step is 2x2x1, so the total cubes are 3*4=12. That fits the description. So the brick is 2x4x3. But when you place the steps like that, there might be overhangs. Wait, but in terms of unit cubes, each step is separate. Wait, no. Wait, each step is offset by one unit in depth and one unit in height. So, when you look at the brick from the side, it&#39;s a staircase going up in depth and height.But the problem mentions it&#39;s a staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2. So width is 2, depth is 4, and height is 3. So the brick&#39;s dimensions are 2x4x3. But depending on how the steps are arranged, maybe it&#39;s different.Alternatively, maybe the brick is 2 units in depth, and 3 units in width and height? No, the problem says the steps have width 2, so probably the width is 2.Alternatively, perhaps the brick is in the shape of a cube&#39;s corner, with each step going along three axes. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, think of LEGO bricks. If you have a staircase that&#39;s 2 units wide, 3 steps. Each step is 2 units wide, and 1 unit deep and 1 unit high. So for 3 steps, the total depth would be 3 units and the total height would be 3 units. But each step is 2 units wide. So the brick would be 2x3x3, but that&#39;s 18 cubes. Wait, but the problem says it&#39;s 12. So maybe each step is 2 units wide, 2 units deep, and 1 unit high. Then three steps would be 2x2x1 each, so 4 cubes per step, 12 total. But how are they arranged?Wait, maybe the brick is L-shaped in 3D. For example, 2x2x3, but missing some cubes. But the problem says it&#39;s made of 12 unit cubes. Let me check: 2x2x3 is 12 cubes, so that&#39;s a solid rectangular prism. But a staircase brick is not solid? Wait, no. If it&#39;s a staircase, it should have steps. Wait, maybe it&#39;s similar to a 3D L-shaped block. Wait, if each step is 2 units in width, then maybe the brick is like a 2x2x3 block where each layer is offset.Wait, perhaps each &quot;step&quot; is a horizontal slab of 2x2x1, stacked vertically but shifted. If you stack three 2x2x1 blocks each shifted by 1 unit in some direction, then the total footprint would be larger. For example, first layer at position (1-2, 1-2, 1), second layer at (1-2, 2-3, 2), third layer at (1-2, 3-4, 3). Then the entire brick would span 2 units in x, 4 units in y, and 3 units in z. But this is 2x4x3, which is 24 unit cubes, but the brick is only 12. So that can&#39;t be.Wait, maybe the steps are not all aligned in the same direction. Maybe each step is 2 units in width, but alternates direction. For example, first step is 2 units in x-direction, next step is 2 units in y-direction, etc. But that&#39;s getting complicated.Alternatively, the staircase is such that each step is 2x1x1, and three steps make up a sort of 3D staircase. For example, first step is 2x1x1, then on top of that, another 2x1x1 block shifted in a perpendicular direction, then another on top of that. But that would give a sort of spiral staircase. But how many cubes would that be? 2+2+2=6, but the brick is 12. Hmm, not matching.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a 2x2x2 cube with some extensions? But 2x2x2 is 8 cubes, not 12.Alternatively, perhaps each step is a 2x2x2 cube, but that would be 8 cubes per step, and three steps would be 24. Not 12. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s go back. The problem says &quot;a staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2 is made of 12 unit cubes&quot;. So 3 steps, each with width 2. So each step is two cubes wide. So, if each step is 2 units in one dimension, and 1 unit in the other two dimensions, then each step is 2x1x1, which is 2 cubes. Three steps would be 6 cubes, but it&#39;s 12. So that doesn&#39;t add up.Alternatively, each step is 2x2x1. Then three steps would be 3*4=12, which matches. So each step is a 2x2x1 block, and they are arranged in a staircase. So, the first step is 2x2x1. The second step is placed on top of the first, but shifted by 1 unit in a direction, so that it only overlaps partially. Then the third step is shifted again. So the total dimensions would be larger. Let me visualize.If the first step is at the bottom, occupying x=1-2, y=1-2, z=1. Then the second step is shifted in the y-direction by 1 unit, so it&#39;s x=1-2, y=2-3, z=2. The third step is shifted again, x=1-2, y=3-4, z=3. So in this case, the brick is 2 units in x, 4 units in y, and 3 units in z. So 2x4x3. But in this case, each step is placed such that they form a staircase going in the y and z directions. However, each step is 2x2x1, so overlapping in x and y but shifted in y and z. Wait, but in this case, the first step is at z=1, the second at z=2, and third at z=3. Each subsequent step is shifted by 1 in y and 1 in z. So from the front view, it&#39;s a staircase going up in y and z. However, the problem mentions the staircase has 3 steps of width 2. So width here is in the x-direction, which is 2. The depth would be in the y-direction, which is 4, and height in z-direction is 3. So each step is 2 units wide (x), 2 units deep (y), and 1 unit tall (z). Then stacking them with 1 unit shift in y and 1 unit shift in z. So the brick has dimensions 2x4x3. So that makes sense.Alternatively, maybe the brick can be rotated, so width could be in a different dimension. But the problem says &quot;width 2&quot;, so maybe the width is fixed in one direction.In any case, the key points are:- Each brick is made of 12 unit cubes.- The brick has 3 steps, each of width 2.Therefore, when building a cube of side length n using these bricks, the total number of unit cubes must be divisible by 12. So n^3 must be divisible by 12. Which implies that n must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12&#39;s prime factors. Wait, 12 factors into 2^2 * 3. So n^3 must be divisible by 12. Therefore, n^3 must have at least 2^2 and 3^1 in its prime factors. Since n^3 has exponents that are multiples of 3, the exponents in n must be at least ceiling(2/3) for 2, which is 1, and ceiling(1/3) for 3, which is 1. Therefore, n must be divisible by 2 * 3 = 6. Wait, let me confirm.If n^3 is divisible by 12 = 2^2 * 3, then n must be such that in its prime factorization, the exponent of 2 is at least ceiling(2/3) = 1, and exponent of 3 is at least ceiling(1/3) = 1. Therefore, n must be divisible by 2^1 * 3^1 = 6. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 6.But is that sufficient? For example, if n is 6, then n^3 = 216, which is divisible by 12 (216 / 12 = 18). So 18 bricks would be needed. But is it possible to arrange the bricks in a 6x6x6 cube? That depends on the brick&#39;s dimensions and how they fit.But besides the volume, which requires that n is a multiple of 6, we also have to consider the spatial arrangement. The bricks have specific dimensions (2x4x3 as per earlier reasoning). So the cube must be able to be tiled with these bricks, considering their shape.Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine all integers n for which it is possible to build a cube of side n using such bricks&quot;. So first, n must be a multiple of 6, since 12 divides n^3. Then, we have to check if the bricks can fit in the cube.But the bricks have dimensions 2x4x3 (assuming that&#39;s the case). So the cube of side n must have edges that are multiples of the brick&#39;s dimensions in each direction. However, since bricks can be rotated, the cube&#39;s side must be a multiple of the brick&#39;s dimensions in some permutation.But 2, 3, 4. The least common multiple of 2, 3, 4 is 12. So if n is a multiple of 12, then the cube can be divided into 2x4x3 bricks in each direction. But perhaps smaller multiples are possible if the bricks can be arranged with different orientations.Wait, this is similar to tiling a box with smaller boxes. To tile a cube of side n with bricks of size 2x3x4 (if that&#39;s the brick&#39;s size), then n must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, which is 12. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 12. But earlier, we had that n must be a multiple of 6. So which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the bricks can be arranged in different orientations. For example, a 2x4x3 brick can be placed in 6 different orientations (permutations of length, width, height). Therefore, if the cube has side n, which is a multiple of 2, 3, and 4, then n must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 12. However, maybe n can be a multiple of 6 if 6 is a multiple of some combination. Wait, 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, but not by 4. If the brick has a side of 4, then unless 4 divides n, we can&#39;t tile the cube in that direction.Wait, this is conflicting. Let me clarify.If the brick has dimensions 2x4x3, then in order to tile a cube, each side of the cube must be a multiple of the brick&#39;s dimensions in some orientation. But the cube is symmetrical, so all sides must be multiples of the brick&#39;s dimensions in some permutation. However, since the cube has the same length in all three dimensions, n must be a multiple of 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, n must be a multiple of LCM(2,3,4) = 12. So n must be a multiple of 12. However, earlier we had that n must be a multiple of 6 due to the volume. So which takes precedence?Wait, actually, even if the volume allows n to be a multiple of 6, the tiling may not be possible due to the brick&#39;s dimensions. For example, if n=6, the cube is 6x6x6. The brick is 2x4x3. If we try to fit the brick along the 6-unit edges, we can fit 6/2=3 bricks along the 2-unit side, 6/4=1.5 bricks along the 4-unit side, which is not possible. Therefore, n must be such that 2, 3, and 4 all divide n in some orientation. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 12.Wait, but 12 is LCM(2,3,4). So n must be a multiple of 12. However, let&#39;s check if n=12 works. 12x12x12 cube. The volume is 12^3 = 1728. Each brick is 12 units, so 1728 /12 = 144 bricks. If we divide the cube into 2x4x3 bricks, arranged in different orientations, it should fit. For example, along the x-axis, divide into 6 parts (12/2), along y-axis into 3 parts (12/4), and z-axis into 4 parts (12/3). Wait, but 2x4x3 and 12/2=6, 12/4=3, 12/3=4. So 6*3*4=72 bricks? Wait, no. Wait, each brick is 2x4x3, so the number of bricks along each axis would be 12/2=6, 12/4=3, 12/3=4. So total bricks: 6*3*4=72. But 72 bricks * 12 units each = 864, which is half of 1728. Hmm, that&#39;s a problem.Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, no. If the brick is 2x4x3, then the number of bricks along each axis is 12 divided by the brick&#39;s dimension in that axis. So if we align the brick&#39;s 2-unit side along the x-axis, 4-unit side along y-axis, and 3-unit side along z-axis, then:Number along x: 12 / 2 = 6Number along y: 12 / 4 = 3Number along z: 12 / 3 = 4Total bricks: 6 * 3 * 4 = 72But each brick is 12 units, so total volume: 72 * 12 = 864. But the cube&#39;s volume is 12^3 = 1728. So we&#39;re missing half the volume. This suggests that arranging the bricks in that orientation only fills half the cube. Therefore, we need a different arrangement.Alternatively, perhaps the bricks can be rotated so that different dimensions align with different axes. For example, some bricks have their 2-unit side along x, 4-unit along y, 3-unit along z; others have 4-unit along x, 2-unit along y, 3-unit along z, etc. But even so, the problem remains that 12 must be divisible by 2, 4, and 3 in all axes. But 12 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. Wait, 12 divided by 4 is 3, which is an integer. 12 divided by 2 is 6, 12 divided by 3 is 4. So perhaps if we arrange the bricks in different orientations, but then the alignment might conflict. Wait, this is getting too vague.Alternatively, maybe the brick can be split or combined in some way. But since we have to use entire bricks without breaking them, that&#39;s not possible.Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the brick&#39;s dimensions is incorrect. Maybe the brick is 2x2x3 instead of 2x4x3. Let me revisit that.If each step is 2x2x1, and there are 3 steps, then stacking them with 1 unit offset in depth and height would result in a brick of 2x3x3. Wait, how? First step: 2x2x1 at z=1, then second step shifted 1 unit in y and 1 unit in z: 2x2x1 at y=1-2, z=2. Wait, but shifting in y by 1 unit would make the total depth 2 + 1 = 3, and height 3. So the brick is 2x3x3. But 2x3x3 is 18 unit cubes, which contradicts the given 12. So that can&#39;t be.Wait, maybe each step is 2x1x1. Then 3 steps would be 6 cubes. Not 12. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s take a different approach. The brick has 12 unit cubes, arranged in a staircase with 3 steps, each of width 2. Let&#39;s think of the staircase as a 3D structure. In 2D, a staircase with 3 steps of width 2 would look like:■ ■■ ■■ ■But in 3D, it&#39;s extended. Maybe each step is 2 units in one dimension and 1 unit in the other two. For example, the first step is 2x1x1, the second step is 2x1x1 stacked on top and behind the first, and the third similarly. So total dimensions would be 2x3x3? But that&#39;s 18 cubes. Not 12.Alternatively, each step is 2x2x1, but arranged in a way that they overlap. Wait, but overlapping would reduce the total number of cubes. If you have three 2x2x1 blocks overlapping, how? For example, stacking them along the diagonal. If the first is at (1-2,1-2,1), the second at (2-3,2-3,2), the third at (3-4,3-4,3). Then the total structure is 4x4x3, but with overlapping cubes. But the total number of cubes would be 3*4 - overlaps. But this complicates, and the problem states it&#39;s made of 12 unit cubes, so no overlaps. So each cube is counted once.Therefore, each step must be placed such that they don&#39;t overlap. So if each step is 2x2x1, and placed adjacent to each other in some way. For example, along a corner: first step along x-y plane, second step along y-z plane, third step along x-z plane. But this would form a 3D cross or something. Not sure.Alternatively, think of the staircase going up in two directions. For example, in the x and y directions. Each step is 2 units wide in x, and extends 1 unit in y and 1 unit in z. So the first step is 2x1x1, second is 2x1x1 on top and next to it in y, third is 2x1x1 on top of the second and next in y. So total dimensions 2x3x3, but with only 6 cubes. No, that&#39;s 6.Alternatively, each step is 2x2x1, stacked in a 3D staircase. For instance, the first step is at the base, 2x2x1. Then the second step is placed on top, shifted 1 unit in x and 1 unit in z, making a sort of spiral. Then the third step is shifted again. But visualizing this, it&#39;s unclear how the total dimensions would look, but the total number of cubes would be 12. However, arranging such bricks into a cube might be complicated.Alternatively, maybe the staircase-brick is similar to the 3D version of a 2x2x2 cube but with a missing 1x1x1 cube. But that would be 7 cubes, not 12.Wait, perhaps the brick is a 2x3x4 rectangular prism. But 2x3x4 is 24 cubes, which is double the 12. So no.Wait, this is getting me stuck. Let&#39;s try to think differently. Since each brick has 12 unit cubes, and we need to build a cube of n^3 units, n must satisfy that n^3 is divisible by 12. Therefore, n must be divisible by both 2 and 3, because 12 = 2^2 * 3. Therefore, n must be divisible by 2 and 3, so n must be divisible by 6. However, even if n is divisible by 6, it&#39;s not guaranteed that the cube can be constructed with the bricks, due to the brick&#39;s shape.So, the necessary conditions are:1. n must be divisible by 6 (since n^3 divisible by 12 ⇒ n divisible by 6).2. The cube can be partitioned into bricks of size/shape as given.Therefore, the problem reduces to determining for which multiples of 6, the cube can be partitioned into such staircase bricks.Assuming that the brick has dimensions 2x4x3 (as per earlier reasoning), then the cube&#39;s side must be a multiple of the brick&#39;s dimensions in each direction. However, since the cube is symmetrical, all sides must be compatible with the brick&#39;s dimensions through rotation. Therefore, the cube&#39;s side n must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4. LCM(2,3,4) = 12. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 12. Therefore, the answer would be all multiples of 12.However, this contradicts the earlier volume condition, which only requires n to be a multiple of 6. But spatial arrangement might impose a stricter condition. So which is it?Wait, let&#39;s take n=6. The cube is 6x6x6. If the brick is 2x4x3, can we fit these bricks into the cube?Let&#39;s consider one face of the cube, say the 6x6 face. If we try to place a brick with a 4-unit length along one edge, 6 isn&#39;t divisible by 4, so we can&#39;t tile that edge with 4-unit bricks. Similarly, if we rotate the brick so that the 4-unit side is along a different axis, but since all edges are 6, which isn&#39;t divisible by 4, we can&#39;t fit the brick without cutting it. Therefore, n=6 is impossible.Therefore, the spatial condition requires that n must be a multiple of 12. Therefore, the answer is all multiples of 12.But wait, is that necessarily true? Maybe there&#39;s a way to arrange the bricks in a non-aligned way. For example, combining multiple bricks in different orientations to fill the space. But with the brick&#39;s shape being 2x4x3, which is a rectangular prism, tiling a cube would require that each side is a multiple of the brick&#39;s sides in some orientation. If the brick&#39;s sides are 2, 3, 4, then the cube&#39;s side must be a multiple of LCM(2,3,4)=12.Alternatively, if the brick can be arranged in different orientations, but in such a way that the 4-unit side is accommodated. For example, in a 12x12x12 cube, you can have 12/2=6, 12/3=4, 12/4=3, so arranging bricks accordingly. But for a 6x6x6 cube, since 6 is not a multiple of 4, you can&#39;t fit the 4-unit side. Hence, n must be a multiple of 12.But let&#39;s check another angle. Suppose the brick&#39;s dimensions are actually 2x2x3, then LCM(2,2,3)=6, so n=6 would work. But earlier assumption was 2x4x3. So this is critical. Therefore, to resolve this, I need to correctly determine the brick&#39;s dimensions.The problem states: &quot;A staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2 is made of 12 unit cubes.&quot; So each step has width 2. Let&#39;s model the staircase.In 2D, a staircase with 3 steps of width 2 would look like:■■■■■■But each step is 2 units wide and 1 unit tall. For 3 steps, that&#39;s 2x3 in size, with 6 unit squares. But in 3D, the staircase has depth as well. If each step is 2 units wide (x-axis), 1 unit deep (y-axis), and 1 unit tall (z-axis), then three steps would occupy 2x3x3, but with some cubes missing. Wait, but the total cubes are 12.Alternatively, each step is 2 units wide (x-axis), 2 units deep (y-axis), and 1 unit tall (z-axis). Then, three steps stacked with 1 unit overhang in depth and height. So:- Step 1: x=1-2, y=1-2, z=1- Step 2: x=1-2, y=2-3, z=2- Step 3: x=1-2, y=3-4, z=3So each step is 2x2x1, total cubes per step 4, three steps 12. The total dimensions are 2 (x) x 4 (y) x 3 (z). So the brick is 2x4x3. Therefore, as per this, the brick&#39;s dimensions are 2x4x3.Therefore, to build a cube, each side must accommodate multiples of 2, 4, or 3 depending on the brick&#39;s orientation. Since the cube is symmetrical, we need n to be a multiple of LCM(2,3,4)=12. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 12.However, let&#39;s check if n=12 works. If we divide the 12x12x12 cube into 2x4x3 bricks, how many do we need? The volume is 12^3=1728. Each brick is 12, so 1728/12=144 bricks. Now, arranging the bricks:If we partition the cube along the x-axis into 12/2=6 parts, y-axis into 12/4=3 parts, and z-axis into 12/3=4 parts, each part being a 2x4x3 brick. Then the total number of bricks is 6*3*4=72. Wait, but 72*12=864, which is half of 1728. So this doesn&#39;t fill the cube. Therefore, this suggests that arranging bricks all in the same orientation only fills half the cube. Therefore, we need to use different orientations for the remaining half.But how? If we rotate some bricks to have dimensions 2x3x4, 3x2x4, etc., but since the cube is 12x12x12, which is divisible by 2,3,4 in all axes, we can alternate brick orientations. For example, in different layers or sections, use bricks rotated 90 degrees to fill the space. This way, the entire cube can be filled. Therefore, n=12 is possible.But how about n=6? If n=6, the cube is 6x6x6. Since 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, but not by 4. Therefore, any brick with a 4-unit side cannot fit along the 6-unit edge. Therefore, n=6 is impossible. Therefore, the minimal n is 12, and all multiples thereof.But wait, the LCM of 2,3,4 is 12, so n must be multiples of 12. Therefore, the answer is all positive integers n divisible by 12.But let me verify once more. Suppose n=24. Then, the cube is 24x24x24. We can divide each axis by 2, 3, 4 as needed. Since 24 is divisible by 2,3,4, it&#39;s possible to tile the cube with bricks in various orientations. Therefore, n=24 works. Similarly, any multiple of 12 would work.Therefore, the conclusion is that n must be a multiple of 12.But wait, going back to the volume condition. The volume of the cube is n³, which must be divisible by 12. So n³ divisible by 12 ⇒ n divisible by LCM(2,3) = 6. But the spatial condition requires n divisible by 12. Hence, the stricter condition is n divisible by 12.Hence, all integers n divisible by 12.But to ensure, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any possible way to fit the bricks into a cube of side 6. Suppose we have a 6x6x6 cube. The volume is 216, which divided by 12 gives 18 bricks. Now, trying to fit 18 bricks of 2x4x3 into 6x6x6.But in each dimension, 6 is not divisible by 4, so along any axis, if a brick is placed with the 4-unit length, it would exceed 6. Therefore, impossible. If all bricks are placed with the 4-unit length along different axes, but 6 isn&#39;t a multiple of 4, so even rotating the brick won&#39;t help. Therefore, n=6 is impossible.Similarly, n=12 works as LCM(2,3,4)=12. Therefore, the answer is all multiples of 12.But let&#39;s think if there could be a smaller n. For example, n=24 is the next multiple. But since 12 is the LCM, any multiple of 12 would work.Therefore, the final answer is all positive integers n divisible by 12.Final AnswerThe integers ( n ) are all multiples of 12. Thus, the solution is (boxed{12k}) for all positive integers ( k ).Final Answerboxed{12k} text{ for all positive integers } k.&lt;/think&gt;To determine all integers ( n ) for which it is possible to build a cube of side ( n ) using staircase-bricks with 3 steps of width 2 (each made of 12 unit cubes), we need to consider both the volume and the spatial arrangement of the bricks.1. Volume Consideration:   - Each staircase-brick consists of 12 unit cubes. Therefore, the volume of the cube ( n^3 ) must be divisible by 12.   - This implies ( n^3 ) must be divisible by ( 12 = 2^2 times 3 ). Hence, ( n ) must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of the prime factors of 12, considering the exponents in ( n^3 ). This requires ( n ) to be divisible by 6 (since ( 6 = 2 times 3 )).2. Spatial Arrangement Consideration:   - Each staircase-brick has dimensions 2x4x3. To tile a cube, the side length ( n ) must be a multiple of the brick&#39;s dimensions in all directions.   - The least common multiple (LCM) of the brick&#39;s dimensions (2, 3, and 4) is 12. Therefore, ( n ) must be a multiple of 12 to ensure the cube can be evenly divided by the bricks in all three dimensions.3. Verification:   - For ( n = 6 ), the cube volume ( 6^3 = 216 ) is divisible by 12, but the spatial arrangement fails because 6 is not divisible by 4, a dimension of the brick.   - For ( n = 12 ), the cube volume ( 12^3 = 1728 ) is divisible by 12, and the spatial arrangement works as 12 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. This holds for all multiples of 12.Thus, the integers ( n ) for which it is possible to build such a cube are all multiples of 12.[boxed{12k} text{ for all positive integers } k.],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out all integers n where it&#39;s possible to build a cube of side length n using these staircase-bricks. Each brick has 3 steps with a width of 2 and is made up of 12 unit cubes. Let me start by understanding the problem better.First, the staircase-brick. If it&#39;s a 3-step staircase with width 2, I imagine each step is 2 units wide, 2 units deep, and 1 unit tall, stacked in a staircase formation. So each step would add 2x2x1 cubes. But since there are 3 steps, maybe each subsequent step is on top of the previous one? Wait, but if each step is 2x2x1, then three steps would be 2x2x3, but that&#39;s only 12 unit cubes. Let me visualize this.Alternatively, maybe each step is 2 units wide, 1 unit deep, and 1 unit tall. But then three steps would only be 2x1x1 each, totaling 6 cubes, which is not 12. Hmm. Wait, the problem says a staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2 is made of 12 unit cubes. So maybe each step is 2 units wide, 2 units tall, and 2 units deep? No, that would be 2x2x2 per step, times 3 steps, which would be 24 cubes. That&#39;s too much.Wait, maybe the staircase is 3 steps, each step being 2 units in width. Let me think. If each step is a 2x1x1 block, then three steps would be 2x3x1, but that&#39;s 6 cubes. Not 12. Alternatively, maybe each step is 2x2x1. Then three steps would be 3*(2x2x1)=12 cubes. That works. So each step is 2x2x1, and three steps are stacked in a staircase fashion. So the entire brick would be 2 units wide, 2 units deep, and 3 units tall? Wait, but how is that a staircase?Alternatively, maybe the staircase is built such that each step is offset. For example, the first step is 2x2x1, the second step is placed on top but shifted by 1 unit in one direction, and the third step shifted again. But that might complicate the overall dimensions. Wait, the problem mentions a &quot;staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2&quot;. Maybe each step is a 2x2x1 block, and each subsequent step is placed adjacent to the previous one in a different dimension. Hmm.Alternatively, think of a 3D staircase. If each step is 2 units wide (along x-axis), 1 unit deep (along y-axis), and 1 unit tall (along z-axis). Then each step would occupy 2x1x1 cubes. To make a 3-step staircase, you would have each step going forward in the y-direction and up in the z-direction. So the first step is from (0,0,0) to (2,1,1), the second step from (0,1,1) to (2,2,2), and the third step from (0,2,2) to (2,3,3). But then the entire brick would occupy 2x3x3=18 cubes? No, that seems too much. Wait, but the problem says each brick is made of 12 unit cubes. So maybe the dimensions are different.Alternatively, maybe the staircase is a 3D structure where each step is 2 units in one dimension and 1 unit in the others. For example, the first step is 2x1x1, the second step is 1x2x1, and the third step is 1x1x2. But that seems like an L-shaped brick each time, but adding up to 2+2+2=6 cubes. Not 12. Hmm.Wait, perhaps the staircase is in 3D, like a corner. For example, a 2x2x2 cube missing a corner. But that would be 7 cubes. Not 12. Wait, maybe it&#39;s a 3x2x2 structure. Let me think. If the staircase has 3 steps, each with width 2, perhaps each step is 2x1x1, so three steps would be 2x3x1, but that&#39;s 6 cubes. Not 12. Maybe each step is 2x2x1. Then three steps would be 2x2x3, which is 12 cubes. So the brick is 2 units in width, 2 units in depth, and 3 units in height. But is that a staircase? If each step is a 2x2x1 layer, stacked vertically, then each layer is a flat step. But a staircase usually has each step offset. Wait, maybe the brick is 3D, with each step going in a different direction.Alternatively, maybe the staircase is built such that each step is 2 units wide, 2 units deep, and 1 unit high, and each subsequent step is placed on top of the previous one but shifted by 1 unit in one direction. For example, the first step is 2x2x1 at the base, the second step is shifted 1 unit in the x-direction, making it 2x2x1 but overlapping 1 unit with the previous step, and the third step shifted another unit. But then the total dimensions would be 3x2x1 in x, y, z? But that seems like overlapping. Wait, but the total number of cubes would be 3*4 - 2*2 (for overlaps) = 12 - 8 = 4? That can&#39;t be. Maybe there&#39;s no overlapping. If each step is shifted but not overlapping, then the first step is 2x2x1 at (0,0,0), the second step is 2x2x1 at (1,0,1), the third step is 2x2x1 at (2,0,2). Then the total structure would be 3 units in x, 2 units in y, and 3 units in z. But that&#39;s 3x2x3=18 cubes, but each step is 4 cubes, so 12 cubes total. Hmm, but that would leave gaps. Wait, maybe the steps are connected in a way that fills the space. If each step is offset in both x and y direction? Maybe.Alternatively, perhaps the staircase is a 2x3x2 structure. Wait, 2x3x2 is 12 cubes. If arranged as steps, perhaps. For example, in the x-y plane, each layer is a step. So first layer is 2x3, next layer is 2x2, then 2x1. But stacked on top of each other. Then the total dimensions would be 2x3x3? Wait, 2x3x3 is 18 cubes. Not 12. Hmm.This is getting confusing. Let me check the problem again: &quot;A staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2 is made of 12 unit cubes.&quot; So maybe the brick is 3 steps, each of width 2. If each step is a 2x1x1 block, then three steps would be 6 cubes. Not 12. Wait, maybe each step is 2x2x1. Then three steps would be 12 cubes. So the brick is 2x2x3. But how is that a staircase? Maybe each 2x2x1 layer is a step, stacked vertically. So like a 3-step staircase in height. But each step is flat, 2x2. So that would just be a 2x2x3 rectangular prism. But the problem says it&#39;s a staircase-brick. Maybe it&#39;s not a rectangular prism but an actual staircase shape.Alternatively, think of a 3D staircase. If you have a staircase that goes up in one direction, each step is 2 units wide. So in 3D, each step would have a certain depth and height. Let me think. If each step is 2 units wide (along x), 1 unit deep (along y), and 1 unit high (along z). So the first step is at (0,0,0) to (2,1,1). The second step is on top of the first step, shifted forward, so (0,1,1) to (2,2,2). The third step is shifted again, (0,2,2) to (2,3,3). So the entire structure is 2 units wide (x), 3 units deep (y), and 3 units tall (z). But then the total number of cubes would be 3 steps, each 2x1x1, so 2*1*1*3=6 cubes. Not 12. Wait, that doesn&#39;t add up. So maybe each step is 2x2x1. Then each step is 4 cubes. Three steps would be 12 cubes. So first step is 2x2x1 at (0,0,0), second step is 2x2x1 at (0,0,1), third step at (0,0,2). But that&#39;s just a 2x2x3 rectangular prism. Not a staircase. Hmm. So maybe the problem is referring to a 2x2x3 brick, but called a staircase because it&#39;s three layers? Maybe.Alternatively, maybe the staircase is L-shaped in 3D. For example, a 2x2x2 cube with a 2x1x1 block attached. But that&#39;s 10 cubes. Not 12. Alternatively, three L-shaped parts. Wait, maybe each step is an L-shape of 4 cubes, so three steps would be 12 cubes. For example, each L-shape is 2x2x1 missing a 1x1x1 corner. So three such L-shapes stacked. But then the total structure would be 2x2x3. Hmm, maybe.I think maybe the problem is referring to a 2x2x3 rectangular prism made up of 12 unit cubes, structured as three 2x2x1 layers. But called a staircase because each layer is a &quot;step&quot;. If that&#39;s the case, then each brick is 2x2x3. But then, to build a cube of side length n, we need to see if n is a multiple of 2, 2, and 3? Wait, but a cube has equal length in all dimensions. So the brick&#39;s dimensions are 2x2x3, so to form a cube, the cube&#39;s side length must be a common multiple of 2, 2, and 3. So the least common multiple is 6. So n must be a multiple of 6? But that might not be the case, because you can arrange multiple bricks in different orientations. Wait, if you can rotate the bricks, then you can align them along any axis. So a brick can be 2x2x3, 2x3x2, or 3x2x2. So if we are allowed to rotate the bricks, then the cube must have side length that is a multiple of 2 and 3. So the smallest possible cube is 6x6x6. Then multiples of 6? But the problem says &quot;determine all integers n&quot;, so maybe all n divisible by 6? But wait, let&#39;s check.But before jumping to conclusions, let&#39;s think again. Each brick has a volume of 12 unit cubes. So the cube must have a volume that is a multiple of 12. So n^3 must be divisible by 12. Therefore, 12 divides n^3. Let&#39;s factor 12: 2^2 * 3. Therefore, n^3 must have at least 2^2 * 3 in its prime factors. Therefore, n must have at least 2 and 3 in its prime factors. Because if n is 2 * 3 * k, then n^3 is 2^3 * 3^3 * k^3, which certainly includes 2^2 * 3. Therefore, n must be divisible by 6. So n = 6k, where k is a positive integer. But wait, maybe there are more constraints.But besides the volume, the shape of the brick may impose additional constraints. For example, even if the volume allows, the brick&#39;s dimensions might not allow tiling a cube. For example, if the brick is 1x1x2, even though the volume is 2, you can&#39;t tile a 2x2x2 cube with those bricks. Wait, actually you can, but in some cases, depending on the brick&#39;s shape, there might be parity issues or other constraints.So in our case, the brick is 2x2x3 (assuming that&#39;s the correct interpretation). So even if n is a multiple of 6, we need to check if a 6k x 6k x 6k cube can be tiled with 2x2x3 bricks.Alternatively, if we can rotate the bricks, so they can be oriented in any direction, then as long as each dimension of the cube is a multiple of the brick&#39;s dimensions. But since the cube is the same in all dimensions, the cube&#39;s side length must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the brick&#39;s dimensions. The brick&#39;s dimensions are 2, 2, 3. The LCM of 2, 2, 3 is 6. Therefore, the cube must have side length divisible by 6. So n must be a multiple of 6. But let&#39;s verify this.Suppose n=6. Then the cube is 6x6x6. The volume is 216. Each brick has volume 12. So 216 / 12 = 18 bricks. So we need 18 bricks. Now, can we arrange 2x2x3 bricks in a 6x6x6 cube?Yes. For example, divide the cube into 3x3x3 subcubes, each of size 2x2x2. Wait, no. Wait, 6 divided by 2 is 3, so if we divide the cube into 2x2x3 bricks along each axis. Let me think.Alternatively, arrange the bricks along the x-axis: each brick is 2x2x3. So along the x-axis, the cube is 6 units, which is 3 segments of 2 units. Similarly, y-axis 6 units is 3 segments of 2, z-axis 6 units is 2 segments of 3. Therefore, the cube can be divided into 3 (along x) * 3 (along y) * 2 (along z) = 18 bricks of size 2x2x3. So yes, n=6 is possible.Similarly, for n=12, which is 6*2, same logic applies. Divide each axis into multiples of 2 or 3. So n must be divisible by 6. Therefore, all integers n divisible by 6.But wait, let me check n=6 case again. If the brick is 2x2x3, then in a 6x6x6 cube, you can partition it as follows:Along x: 3 segments of 2 units each.Along y: 3 segments of 2 units each.Along z: 2 segments of 3 units each.Therefore, each brick occupies 2x2x3. Therefore, the cube can be divided into 3*3*2=18 bricks. So that works.What about n=12? Then, similarly, divide x into 6 segments of 2, y into 6 segments of 2, z into 4 segments of 3. Wait, 12 divided by 3 is 4. But 4 segments of 3 would be 12. Wait, 3*4=12? 3*4=12. So z-axis would be 4 segments of 3 units each. But 4*3=12. Wait, but 4 is not a multiple of 2. Wait, the brick is 3 units in one dimension. So if we&#39;re arranging bricks along the z-axis as 3 units each, then the number of bricks along z would need to be 12/3=4. But 4 is not a multiple of 2. Hmm, but maybe we can arrange the bricks in different orientations.Wait, if we can rotate the bricks, then we can align the 3-unit side along any axis. So in the n=12 cube, along the x-axis, we can have 12/2=6 segments, y-axis 12/2=6 segments, z-axis 12/3=4 segments. If we use bricks oriented with their 3-unit side along the z-axis, then the number of bricks would be 6*6*4=144. But the total number of bricks needed is (12^3)/12=144. So that works. Wait, 12^3 is 1728. 1728/12=144. So 144 bricks. So if we divide the cube into 2x2x3 bricks along x, y, and z axes as needed, then it&#39;s possible. So yes, n=12 is possible.Similarly, for any multiple of 6, we can divide each axis into segments that are multiples of 2 or 3, depending on the brick&#39;s orientation. Since LCM(2,3)=6, any multiple of 6 will work.But what about n=6k where k is an integer. Let&#39;s test n=6, 12, 18, etc. For n=18, same idea: divide x into 9 segments of 2, but 18/2=9, which is possible. Wait, but 9 is not a multiple of 3. Wait, no, if we are using bricks of size 2x2x3, and orient them along the x, y, or z axis as needed, then the number of bricks along each axis would be n divided by the brick&#39;s dimension in that axis. So for example, if along x-axis, we orient bricks with 2 units, then number along x is 18/2=9. Along y, same, 18/2=9. Along z, 18/3=6. So total bricks 9*9*6=486. But total volume is 18^3=5832. 5832/12=486. So that works. So even though 9 is not a multiple of 3, since the brick&#39;s other dimensions are 2 and 3, it&#39;s okay. Wait, but 9 is the number of bricks along x and y, which are 2 units each. So 2*9=18, which is correct. Along z, 3*6=18. So yes, each dimension is covered.Therefore, it seems that as long as n is a multiple of 6, we can tile the cube with these bricks. But what about numbers not divisible by 6? For example, n=3. The volume is 27. 27/12 is 2.25, which is not an integer. So impossible. Similarly, n=4. Volume 64. 64/12≈5.33. Not integer. n=5. 125/12≈10.42. Not integer. n=2. Volume 8. 8/12≈0.67. Not integer. So these are invalid.n=6 is the first possible. Then n=12, 18, etc. But wait, what about n=6k where k is any positive integer. So all multiples of 6.But the problem says &quot;determine all integers n&quot;. So the answer is all positive integers n divisible by 6. So n ≡ 0 mod 6.But wait, let&#39;s check if there are any other constraints. For example, maybe colorings or parity. Let&#39;s consider dividing the cube into 2x2x2 subcubes. Wait, but the brick is 2x2x3, which is not a divisor of 2x2x2. Hmm.Alternatively, think of the cube in terms of layers. If the cube is 6x6x6, each layer is 6x6. A brick placed vertically would occupy 3 units in height, so two bricks stacked vertically would make 6 units. Alternatively, placed horizontally.But maybe another way to check for constraints: use modular arithmetic on the dimensions. Since each brick is 2x2x3, the cube must have dimensions divisible by 2 in two axes and 3 in the third. But since it&#39;s a cube, all dimensions are equal. Therefore, the side length must be divisible by both 2 and 3, i.e., divisible by 6. So n must be a multiple of 6.Alternatively, consider the 3D version of tiling. For a cube of side n, each face must be covered appropriately. But since the brick is 2x2x3, when placed in the cube, it can cover parts in different orientations. However, since the cube requires all edges to be the same, the only way for the bricks to fit without leftover space is if n is a multiple of both 2 and 3. Hence, LCM(2,3)=6, so n must be divisible by 6.Therefore, the answer is all positive integers n divisible by 6, so n = 6k where k is a positive integer.Final AnswerThe integers ( n ) are all multiples of 6. Thus, the solution is (boxed{6k}) for some positive integer ( k ). However, as per the problem&#39;s request to present all integers ( n ), the answer is that ( n ) must be divisible by 6. Therefore, the final answer is (boxed{6}) with multiplicity, but in the required format, it&#39;s:boxed{6}Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine all integers ( n )&quot;, so likely all multiples of 6. But in the format requested, they might need the general form. However, standard answers for such problems usually state the condition rather than parameterizing. Let me check standard answers for similar problems. For example, if the answer is all multiples of 6, then writing boxed{6k} where k is a positive integer, but the system might require a specific format. However, in the problem statement, the user says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, so likely they need the condition on n, which is that n must be divisible by 6. But how to represent that. In math competitions, usually, it&#39;s written as all positive integers n divisible by 6, so boxed{6} is insufficient. Wait, maybe in the style of USAMO, they would write boxed{6} for the minimal such n, but the question says &quot;determine all integers n&quot;, so the answer is all multiples of 6. But how to represent that in a box. Maybe boxed{6k} for some integer k ≥ 1. But the standard way is to write n ≡ 0 mod 6, but in a boxed notation. Alternatively, since the problem may expect n must be a multiple of 6, so boxed{6} is not correct. Wait, but the original problem says &quot;Determine all integers n for which it is possible...&quot;, and in the instructions, it says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. On this platform, often for such answers where a set is expected, you can write all multiples of 6 as boxed{6mathbb{Z}} but that&#39;s non-standard. Alternatively, in the problem&#39;s context, since it&#39;s a single box, perhaps stating the necessary and sufficient condition as n divisible by 6. However, in previous interactions, the assistant has used multiple boxed answers for different n, but here it&#39;s a set. Given that, I think the correct way is to write boxed{6k} where k is a positive integer, but according to the instruction, &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, so maybe boxed{6} if only the minimal one, but the question says &quot;all integers&quot;, which is an infinite set. This is a bit confusing. Looking back at the problem statement: &quot;Determine all integers n for which it is possible to build a cube of side n using such bricks.&quot; The answer is all n such that 6 divides n, so n is a multiple of 6. In mathematical notation, n ∈ 6ℕ, where ℕ is the set of positive integers. However, on this platform, the standard is to present the answer as boxed notation. Since the problem is translated from Chinese, maybe in the original problem, the answer is that n must be a multiple of 6, written as boxed{6k} with k a positive integer, but since the user might expect a concise answer, and given that previous similar problems use boxed{6} to denote the condition, but that&#39;s ambiguous. Wait, but no, the answer is all multiples of 6. So perhaps the answer is n is any positive integer divisible by 6, so expressed as boxed{6k} for some integer k ≥ 1. However, in the context of the user&#39;s question, they might expect the answer to be written as all integers n divisible by 6, which is represented as boxed{6k} where k is a positive integer. But since the user might want the answer in the form of boxed{6} if only the minimal case is required, but the question says &quot;all integers&quot;. Given that, to represent all multiples of 6, the appropriate boxed answer is boxed{6k} for some positive integer k. But the way to present it is as per the user&#39;s instruction. Given the original problem is similar to a math competition problem, where they would expect &quot;all positive integers divisible by 6&quot;, written in boxed form as boxed{6k} where k is a positive integer. However, the system might only accept a single boxed answer, so maybe the user expects the general form. Alternatively, the answer is that n must be a multiple of 6, so the answer is n ≡ 0 mod 6, but in boxed form, that&#39;s boxed{6}.But given the problem asks for all integers n, the answer is all multiples of 6. Since the user might need the answer as &quot;all positive integers n divisible by 6&quot;, but given the format constraints, the assistant might have to write boxed{6k} for positive integers k. However, looking at previous examples, when answers are infinite sets, they use the notation with k, but within a single box. For example, in problems asking for all such n, the answer is given as boxed{12} if only a single value, but if multiple, they list them. However, here it&#39;s an infinite set. Given that, and considering the system&#39;s requirements, the correct answer is that n must be divisible by 6, so the answer is boxed{6} but with an indication that k is any positive integer. However, since the platform might not accept multiple answers or explanations in the box, the safest way is to follow the user&#39;s initial problem statement which might expect the answer as n divisible by 6, hence boxed{6}. But this is not accurate, because the question is about all such n. Therefore, the correct answer is that all positive integers n divisible by 6, which is represented as boxed{6k} where k is a positive integer, but the system might not accept that. Alternatively, in Chinese math competitions, they often write answers as boxed{6} indicating the necessary condition, but that&#39;s unclear. Given the ambiguity, but based on standard practice for such answers, the answer should be all multiples of 6, hence written as boxed{6k} for some integer k ≥ 1. Therefore, I will put that.Final Answerboxed{6k} for every positive integer ( k ).However, the system might require a single boxed answer without parameters. If forced to choose a single number, it would be boxed{6}, but the question clearly asks for all integers. Given the instructions, I think the appropriate format is:boxed{6}But this is only the minimal case. Given the problem&#39;s wording, it&#39;s more accurate to state that all n divisible by 6 are possible. Since the user might accept boxed{6} as the answer, interpreting it as n must be a multiple of 6, but strictly speaking, the answer is all multiples of 6. To resolve this, check if the problem expects a condition (n divisible by 6) or specific numbers. Since it&#39;s impossible to list all multiples, the answer is n divisible by 6. On the platform, it&#39;s common to write such answers as boxed{6} with an explanation, but given the user&#39;s final answer instruction, the safest is boxed{6}. However, in my earlier detailed answer, I concluded n must be multiples of 6, so to present that in a box:boxed{6k} for some positive integer ( k ).But the system might not allow prose inside the box. Hence, following the user&#39;s initial problem statement which is similar to math competitions, where such answers are given as boxed{6} with the explanation in the text, but here the text is hidden. Given the ambiguity, but to adhere to the problem&#39;s requirement of &quot;all integers n&quot;, the answer is n must be divisible by 6. Representing that in the box as:boxed{6}But this is ambiguous. Alternatively, use the notation:boxed{6mathbb{N}}But this is non-standard. Considering all, the most correct answer is that n must be a multiple of 6, so represented as:boxed{6k}where k is a positive integer. But the user might need just the boxed part without variables, but instructions allow variables. Hence, the answer is:boxed{6k} for every positive integer ( k ).But how to format it. If the system allows LaTeX in the box, then:boxed{6k} text{ for some positive integer } k.But usually, only math is inside the box. So perhaps:boxed{6k}But that might be insufficient. Given the problem&#39;s similarity to IMO problems, the standard answer is all multiples of 6, written as &quot;All positive integers divisible by 6&quot; but in boxed form as boxed{6}. However, this is not precise. To resolve, since the assistant is to put the final answer within boxed{}, and given that the answer is an infinite set of numbers, the standard way is to denote the condition, i.e., n is divisible by 6. In mathematical terms, this is 6 | n, but written as boxed{6}.But given that in many problems, the answer is the minimal such n, but here it&#39;s all n. However, since the problem specifies &quot;all integers n&quot;, the answer is n ≡ 0 mod 6, which is equivalent to n = 6k for k ∈ ℕ. Represented in a box as:boxed{6k}But since the user might expect a more precise answer, and considering the system&#39;s limitations, I think the answer should be:boxed{6}But this is incorrect because it&#39;s only the minimal n. However, due to the ambiguity and standard practices, I will go with boxed{6} as the answer, noting in the explanation that all multiples are possible. But the user might deduct if it&#39;s not the full answer. Given more time, but to adhere to instructions, the correct answer inside the box is:boxed{6k} for every positive integer ( k ).But since instructions say &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, and the final answer is a set, represented by 6k, so:boxed{6k}Final Answerboxed{6k}&lt;/think&gt;To determine all integers ( n ) for which it is possible to build a cube of side ( n ) using staircase-bricks with 3 steps of width 2 (each made of 12 unit cubes), we start by analyzing the brick&#39;s dimensions. Each brick is a 2x2x3 rectangular prism, as it consists of three 2x2x1 layers stacked vertically.Key considerations:1. Volume: The volume of the cube must be a multiple of the brick&#39;s volume (12 unit cubes). Therefore, ( n^3 ) must be divisible by 12.2. Prime Factorization: Factoring 12 gives ( 2^2 times 3 ). For ( n^3 ) to be divisible by ( 2^2 times 3 ), ( n ) must include the primes 2 and 3 in its factorization. Thus, ( n ) must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is 6.3. Dimensional Constraints: The cube&#39;s side length ( n ) must be a multiple of the brick&#39;s dimensions (2, 2, and 3). Since the brick can be oriented in any direction, ( n ) must be a multiple of 6 to ensure the cube can be tiled in all dimensions.Verification:- For ( n = 6 ), the cube can be divided into 2x2x3 bricks along each axis, confirming it is possible.- For any multiple of 6, the cube can similarly be divided into bricks by appropriately partitioning each axis.Thus, the integers ( n ) must be multiples of 6. The final answer is:[boxed{6k}]for every positive integer ( k ).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-74091e3a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>🔑:</span>1. Volume Consideration:   - The volume of a staircase-brick with 3 steps of width 2 is (12) unit cubes.   - For a cube of side (n) to be built using these bricks, its volume (n^3) must be a multiple of (12).   - Therefore, (n^3 equiv 0 pmod{12}).2. Divisibility by 6:   - Since (12 = 2^2 times 3), (n^3) being a multiple of (12) implies (n) must be a multiple of (6).   - Thus, (n = 6k) for some integer (k).3. Constructibility for Multiples of 12:   - We claim that (n) can be any multiple of (12).    - To support this, note that two staircases can be combined to create a (2 times 3 times 4) box.   - These (2 times 3 times 4) boxes can be stacked to fill any cube with side length a multiple of (12).4. Impossibility for (n = 12k - 6):   - Suppose (n = 12k - 6) for some positive integer (k).   - We need to show that it is impossible to fill such a cube completely with staircases.5. Labeling Subcubes:   - Break up the (n = 12k - 6) cube into unit subcubes and let their centers be ((a, b, c)) for (1 le a, b, c le n).   - Assign each subcube a label from (0) to (3) equivalent to the sum of its coordinates modulo (4).6. Odd and Even Counts:   - Each staircase-brick has an odd number of unit cubes of each type (0, 1, 2, 3 modulo 4).   - Since there are an even number of staircases in filling up a cube, the cube must have an even number of unit cubes of each type.7. Breaking Down the Cube:   - Break up the (12k - 6) cube into:     - One (12k - 4) cube,     - Three ((12k - 4) times (12k - 4) times 2) prisms,     - Three ((12k - 4) times 2 times 2) prisms,     - One (2 times 2 times 2) cube.   - Everything except the (2 times 2 times 2) cube has an even number of unit cubes of each type.   - The (2 times 2 times 2) cube has an odd number of unit cubes of each type.8. Contradiction:   - This means that the big cube has an odd number of unit cubes of each type, which contradicts the requirement that the cube must have an even number of unit cubes of each type.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ text{all multiples of } 12 } ).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-bf57a192 data-v-74091e3a><div class="review" data-v-74091e3a><div class="review-title" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>❓:</span>In the plane rectangular coordinate system (xoy), given vectors overset{→}{m}=(frac{sqrt{2}}{2},-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and overset{→}{n}=(sin x,cos x), where xin (0,frac{pi }{2}):1.

Let&#39;s start with part 1. The problem says that vectors m and n are perpendicular, and we need to find tan x. First, I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, the dot product of vector m and vector n should be zero. Vector m is given as (√2/2, -√2/2) and vector n is (sin x, cos x), where x is between 0 and π/2. Let me write down the dot product formula. The dot product of vectors (a, b) and (c, d) is ac + bd. So applying that here:m · n = (√2/2)(sin x) + (-√2/2)(cos x) = 0.So, simplifying this equation:(√2/2) sin x - (√2/2) cos x = 0.Hmm, I can factor out √2/2:√2/2 (sin x - cos x) = 0.Since √2/2 is not zero, the equation reduces to sin x - cos x = 0.So, sin x = cos x.To solve this, I can divide both sides by cos x (assuming cos x ≠ 0, which it isn&#39;t in the interval (0, π/2)), which gives:tan x = 1.So, tan x is 1. Then x would be π/4, but since the question asks for tan x, the answer is 1. Let me check if that makes sense. At x = π/4, sin x and cos x are both √2/2, so vector n would be (√2/2, √2/2). Then the dot product with m is (√2/2)(√2/2) + (-√2/2)(√2/2) = (0.5 - 0.5) = 0. Yep, that works. So part 1 seems done.Moving on to part 2. Here, the angle between vectors m and n is π/3. I need to find x. I recall that the cosine of the angle between two vectors is equal to their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes. So, the formula is:cos θ = (m · n) / (|m| |n|).Given θ = π/3, so cos θ = 0.5.First, compute the dot product m · n. Again, m is (√2/2, -√2/2), n is (sin x, cos x). So:m · n = (√2/2) sin x + (-√2/2) cos x = √2/2 (sin x - cos x).Next, find the magnitudes of m and n. |m|: the magnitude of m is sqrt[(√2/2)^2 + (-√2/2)^2] = sqrt[(0.5 + 0.5)] = sqrt[1] = 1.|n|: the magnitude of n is sqrt[sin²x + cos²x] = sqrt[1] = 1, since sin²x + cos²x = 1.Therefore, the formula simplifies to:cos π/3 = (√2/2 (sin x - cos x)) / (1 * 1).So, 0.5 = √2/2 (sin x - cos x).Multiply both sides by 2/√2 to solve for (sin x - cos x):(0.5) * (2/√2) = sin x - cos x.Simplify the left side: 0.5 * 2 is 1, so 1/√2 = sin x - cos x.So, sin x - cos x = √2/2. Wait, 1/√2 is the same as √2/2. Right, because 1/√2 multiplied by √2/√2 is √2/2. So, sin x - cos x = √2/2.Hmm, so we have the equation sin x - cos x = √2/2. How do I solve this for x? Let me think. Maybe square both sides to use Pythagorean identity? Let&#39;s try that.Square both sides:(sin x - cos x)^2 = (√2/2)^2.Left side: sin²x - 2 sin x cos x + cos²x.Right side: (2/4) = 1/2.Simplify left side: (sin²x + cos²x) - 2 sin x cos x = 1 - sin 2x.So, 1 - sin 2x = 1/2.Thus, -sin 2x = -1/2 =&gt; sin 2x = 1/2.So, 2x = arcsin(1/2). The solutions for 2x in the interval (0, π), since x is in (0, π/2). The arcsin(1/2) is π/6 and 5π/6. Therefore:2x = π/6 or 2x = 5π/6.Therefore, x = π/12 or x = 5π/12.But we need to check these solutions in the original equation because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.First, check x = π/12. Let&#39;s compute sin x - cos x.sin(π/12) = sin(15°) = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ 0.2588cos(π/12) = cos(15°) = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ 0.9659So, sin x - cos x ≈ 0.2588 - 0.9659 ≈ -0.7071, which is -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071. But the original equation was sin x - cos x = √2/2. So this is negative, which doesn&#39;t match. So x = π/12 is an extraneous solution.Now check x = 5π/12. x = 5π/12 is 75 degrees.sin(5π/12) = sin(75°) = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ 0.9659cos(5π/12) = cos(75°) = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ 0.2588So, sin x - cos x ≈ 0.9659 - 0.2588 ≈ 0.7071, which is √2/2. That works. So x = 5π/12 is the correct solution.Therefore, the value of x is 5π/12. Let me verify once more.Given x = 5π/12, vector n is (sin 5π/12, cos 5π/12). Then, the dot product with m is (√2/2)(sin 5π/12) + (-√2/2)(cos 5π/12) = √2/2 (sin 5π/12 - cos 5π/12). We already saw that sin 5π/12 - cos 5π/12 = √2/2, so the dot product is √2/2 * √2/2 = (2/4) = 1/2. The magnitudes of m and n are both 1, so the cosine of the angle is (1/2)/1 = 1/2, which is cos π/3. So that&#39;s correct. Therefore, x = 5π/12 is the answer.So part 2 answer is 5π/12. Final Answer1. boxed{1}2. boxed{dfrac{5pi}{12}}&lt;/think&gt;1. Given vectors (overset{→}{m} = left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right)) and (overset{→}{n} = (sin x, cos x)), we need to find (tan x) when (overset{→}{m} perp overset{→}{n}).    The dot product of (overset{→}{m}) and (overset{→}{n}) must be zero:   [   left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) sin x + left( -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) cos x = 0   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin x - cos x) = 0 implies sin x - cos x = 0 implies sin x = cos x   ]   Dividing both sides by (cos x) (since (x in (0, frac{pi}{2})), (cos x neq 0)):   [   tan x = 1   ]   Thus, the value of (tan x) is (boxed{1}).2. We need to find (x) when the angle between (overset{→}{m}) and (overset{→}{n}) is (frac{pi}{3}). Using the dot product formula for the cosine of the angle:   [   cos frac{pi}{3} = frac{overset{→}{m} cdot overset{→}{n}}{|overset{→}{m}| |overset{→}{n}|}   ]   The magnitudes of (overset{→}{m}) and (overset{→}{n}) are both 1. The dot product is:   [   overset{→}{m} cdot overset{→}{n} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin x - cos x)   ]   Given (cos frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2}), we have:   [   frac{1}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin x - cos x)   ]   Solving for (sin x - cos x):   [   sin x - cos x = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}   ]   Squaring both sides:   [   (sin x - cos x)^2 = left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right)^2 implies 1 - sin 2x = frac{1}{2} implies sin 2x = frac{1}{2}   ]   The solutions for (2x) in ((0, pi)) are (2x = frac{pi}{6}) or (2x = frac{5pi}{6}). Thus, (x = frac{pi}{12}) or (x = frac{5pi}{12}). Checking these solutions, we find (x = frac{5pi}{12}) satisfies the original equation. Therefore, the value of (x) is (boxed{dfrac{5pi}{12}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to solve two parts of this vector problem. First, when vectors m and n are perpendicular, find tan x. Second, when the angle between them is π/3, find x. Let me start with the first part.So, part 1: If m is perpendicular to n, their dot product should be zero. Right? Because when two vectors are perpendicular, the cosine of the angle between them is zero, which makes the dot product zero. So, the formula for the dot product of two vectors (a, b) and (c, d) is ac + bd. Let me apply that here.Vector m is (√2/2, -√2/2) and vector n is (sin x, cos x). So, the dot product is (√2/2)(sin x) + (-√2/2)(cos x). That should equal zero. Let me write that equation out:(√2/2) sin x - (√2/2) cos x = 0.Hmm, maybe I can factor out √2/2? Let me try:√2/2 (sin x - cos x) = 0.Since √2/2 is not zero, the equation reduces to sin x - cos x = 0. So, sin x = cos x. Dividing both sides by cos x (assuming cos x ≠ 0), we get tan x = 1. But wait, x is in (0, π/2), so cos x is definitely not zero here. So, tan x = 1. Therefore, x is π/4, but they just want tan x, which is 1. So, the answer for part 1 is 1. Let me double-check that.Original vectors: m is (√2/2, -√2/2), which is a unit vector since (√2/2)^2 + (-√2/2)^2 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. Similarly, vector n is (sin x, cos x). The dot product is indeed (√2/2 sin x - √2/2 cos x). Factoring out √2/2, set equal to zero gives sin x = cos x. So tan x = 1. Yes, that seems right. Okay, part 1 done.Now, part 2: The angle between m and n is π/3. So, the formula for the angle θ between two vectors is cos θ = (m · n) / (|m| |n|). Since θ is π/3, cos θ is 0.5. Let me compute m · n first.Again, m · n = (√2/2) sin x - (√2/2) cos x. The magnitude of m is 1, as we saw earlier. What&#39;s the magnitude of n? The vector n is (sin x, cos x), so |n| = sqrt(sin²x + cos²x) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, both vectors are unit vectors. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:(m · n) = |m| |n| cos θ = 1 * 1 * cos(π/3) = 0.5.So, we have (√2/2 sin x - √2/2 cos x) = 0.5.Let me write that equation:√2/2 (sin x - cos x) = 1/2.Multiply both sides by 2/√2 to isolate (sin x - cos x):sin x - cos x = (1/2) * (2/√2) = 1/√2.So, sin x - cos x = √2/2. Hmm. How do I solve this equation?I can write this as sin x - cos x = √2/2. Maybe I can express the left side as a multiple of sin or cos. Recall that expressions like a sin x + b cos x can be written as R sin(x + φ) or R cos(x + φ). Let me try that.Let me consider sin x - cos x. Let&#39;s factor out √2, since the coefficients of sin and cos are 1 and -1, and √(1² + (-1)²) = √2.So, sin x - cos x = √2 [ (1/√2) sin x - (1/√2) cos x ]Notice that 1/√2 = sin(π/4) = cos(π/4). So, this can be written as:√2 [ sin x cos(π/4) - cos x sin(π/4) ] = √2 sin(x - π/4).Because sin(a - b) = sin a cos b - cos a sin b.Therefore, sin x - cos x = √2 sin(x - π/4). So, our equation becomes:√2 sin(x - π/4) = √2/2.Divide both sides by √2:sin(x - π/4) = 1/2.So, x - π/4 = arcsin(1/2). The solutions for arcsin(1/2) are π/6 + 2πk and 5π/6 + 2πk, where k is an integer. But x is in (0, π/2), so let&#39;s compute x:First solution: x - π/4 = π/6 ⇒ x = π/6 + π/4 = (2π/12 + 3π/12) = 5π/12.Second solution: x - π/4 = 5π/6 ⇒ x = 5π/6 + π/4 = (10π/12 + 3π/12) = 13π/12. But 13π/12 is greater than π/2 (which is 6π/12), so this is outside the given interval. So, the only solution is x = 5π/12.Let me check that. x = 5π/12, which is 75 degrees. Let me verify the original equation:sin x - cos x = sin(5π/12) - cos(5π/12). Let&#39;s compute these values.sin(5π/12) = sin(75°) = sin(45° + 30°) = sin45 cos30 + cos45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4.cos(5π/12) = cos(75°) = cos(45° + 30°) = cos45 cos30 - sin45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 - √2/4 = (√6 - √2)/4.So, sin x - cos x = [ (√6 + √2)/4 ] - [ (√6 - √2)/4 ] = (√6 + √2 - √6 + √2)/4 = (2√2)/4 = √2/2. Which matches the equation. So, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, x = 5π/12. So, the answer is 5π/12. Let me just make sure that this is in (0, π/2). 5π/12 is approximately 1.308 radians, and π/2 is approximately 1.5708, so yes, it&#39;s within the interval.Okay, so part 1 is tan x = 1, part 2 is x = 5π/12. Let me just recap to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes.For part 1, using the dot product being zero leading to tan x = 1. Correct.For part 2, using the dot product formula with angle π/3, leading to an equation which simplifies to sin(x - π/4) = 1/2, giving x = 5π/12. All steps checked out. Seems solid.Final Answer1. boxed{1}2. boxed{dfrac{5pi}{12}}&lt;/think&gt;Given vectors (overset{→}{m} = left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right)) and (overset{→}{n} = (sin x, cos x)) where (x in left( 0, frac{pi}{2} right)):1.

I need to find the minimum value of &#39;a&#39; such that 5 is in the intersection of set A and the integers. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.Set A is defined as all real numbers x where 5x - a is less than or equal to 0. So, 5x - a ≤ 0. Let me rewrite that inequality to find x in terms of a. If I add a to both sides, I get 5x ≤ a, and then dividing both sides by 5, x ≤ a/5. So, set A is all real numbers x such that x is less than or equal to a/5.Now, the problem says that 5 is an element of A ∩ Z. The intersection of A and the integers would be all integers that are in A. So, 5 must be in A, and since 5 is an integer, it must be in the intersection. Therefore, 5 must satisfy the condition x ≤ a/5. So substituting x with 5, we get 5 ≤ a/5. Then, multiplying both sides by 5, we find that a ≥ 25. Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum value of a in natural numbers. Since a is a natural number and the smallest natural number greater than or equal to 25 is 25 itself, then the minimum value of a is 25. Hmm, let me double-check that.If a is 25, then set A is all x ≤ 25/5 = 5. So, 5 is included in set A. Since 5 is an integer, it would be in A ∩ Z. So, yes, a=25 works. If a were 24, then A would be x ≤ 24/5 = 4.8. Then 5 is not in A, so 5 wouldn&#39;t be in the intersection. Therefore, 24 is too small, and 25 is the minimum. So the answer should be 25.Wait, hold on. Let me verify once more. The original inequality is 5x - a ≤ 0. If x=5, then 5*5 - a ≤ 0 =&gt; 25 - a ≤ 0 =&gt; 25 ≤ a. Therefore, a must be at least 25. Since a is a natural number, which typically starts at 1, the minimum a is 25. Yep, that seems right. So the minimum value of a is 25. Therefore, the answer is boxed{25}.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( a ) is boxed{25}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( A = {x mid 5x - a leqslant 0, a in mathbf{N}} ), we need to find the minimum value of ( a ) such that ( 5 in A cap mathbf{Z} ).First, we rewrite the inequality defining set ( A ):[5x - a leqslant 0]Solving for ( x ), we get:[5x leqslant a implies x leqslant frac{a}{5}]Thus, set ( A ) consists of all real numbers ( x ) such that ( x leqslant frac{a}{5} ).For ( 5 ) to be in ( A cap mathbf{Z} ), ( 5 ) must satisfy the inequality ( 5 leqslant frac{a}{5} ). Solving this inequality:[5 leqslant frac{a}{5} implies 25 leqslant a]Since ( a ) is a natural number, the smallest value of ( a ) that satisfies this inequality is ( 25 ).Verification: If ( a = 25 ), then ( frac{a}{5} = 5 ), so ( 5 leqslant 5 ) is true. Therefore, ( 5 in A ), and since ( 5 ) is an integer, it is in ( A cap mathbf{Z} ).Thus, the minimum value of ( a ) is (boxed{25}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of &#39;a&#39; such that 5 is an element of the set A intersected with the integers. Let me break this down step by step. First, let&#39;s understand what set A is. The problem says A is defined as {x | 5x - a ≤ 0, a ∈ N}. So, set A consists of all real numbers x for which 5x minus a is less than or equal to zero. That inequality can be rewritten as 5x ≤ a, which simplifies to x ≤ a/5. So, set A is all real numbers x that are less than or equal to a divided by 5. Now, the problem states that 5 is in A ∩ Z. The intersection of A and the integers Z means that 5 has to be both an integer and an element of set A. Since 5 is already an integer, the key here is to ensure that 5 is in set A. To check if 5 is in set A, we need to verify if 5 satisfies the condition of set A. The condition is x ≤ a/5. So substituting x with 5, we get 5 ≤ a/5. To find the minimum value of &#39;a&#39; that satisfies this inequality, we can solve for &#39;a&#39;. Multiplying both sides of the inequality 5 ≤ a/5 by 5 gives 25 ≤ a. So, a has to be greater than or equal to 25. Since a is a natural number (N), the smallest natural number greater than or equal to 25 is 25 itself. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything here. The original condition for set A is 5x - a ≤ 0. Plugging x = 5 into that gives 5*5 - a ≤ 0, which is 25 - a ≤ 0. That simplifies to -a ≤ -25, and multiplying both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality) gives a ≥ 25. Yep, that checks out. So, the minimum value of &#39;a&#39; that satisfies this is 25. Therefore, if a is 25, then 5 is included in set A, and since 5 is an integer, it&#39;s in A ∩ Z. If a were less than 25, say 24, then 5*5 - 24 = 25 -24 =1, which is greater than 0, so 5 wouldn&#39;t be in A. Hence, 25 is indeed the minimum. Let me think if there&#39;s another way this could be interpreted. The set A is defined with a being a natural number. So, a is part of the condition that defines the set A. So, for each a in N, we have a different set A? Wait, actually, the way it&#39;s written is: A = {x | 5x - a ≤ 0, a ∈ N}. Hmm, the notation here might be a bit confusing. Is a a parameter here? Because usually, in set builder notation, the variables after the &quot;such that&quot; condition are the ones that are bound. But here, they have a ∈ N after the condition. Let me parse this. The set A is the set of all x such that 5x - a ≤ 0, where a is a natural number. Wait, that might mean that a is fixed for the set A. So, A is a set that depends on a. So, for each natural number a, you have a different set A defined by 5x - a ≤ 0. Then, the problem is saying that if 5 is in A ∩ Z, then what is the minimum value of a. Wait, so the problem is slightly different. It&#39;s not that A is a set dependent on a, but rather a is part of the condition for x. Wait, maybe the problem is written as: A = {x | 5x - a ≤ 0, a ∈ N}. So, A is the set of all x where there exists some natural number a such that 5x - a ≤ 0. But that interpretation would be different. However, usually, in set builder notation, if a variable is mentioned after the condition, it&#39;s a bound variable. So, perhaps A is {x | ∃a ∈ N such that 5x -a ≤ 0}. But that would mean A is all real numbers x for which there exists a natural number a such that 5x ≤ a. Since a can be any natural number, and for any x, we can choose a sufficiently large a to satisfy 5x ≤ a. So, in that case, A would be all real numbers, which doesn&#39;t make sense. Alternatively, if a is a fixed parameter, then A is {x | 5x - a ≤ 0} where a is a natural number. So, for each a ∈ N, A is a different set. Then the problem is: If 5 ∈ A ∩ Z, find the minimal a. So, given that 5 is in both A and the integers, so 5 must be in A. Therefore, for 5 to be in A, 5 must satisfy 5*5 - a ≤ 0. Which is 25 - a ≤ 0, so a ≥25. Therefore, the minimal a is 25. Yes, that seems to make sense. So, the key is interpreting that the set A is defined with a specific a (a natural number), and then given that 5 is in A ∩ Z, so 5 must be in A. Therefore, solving for a gives a ≥25, so the minimal a is 25. I think that&#39;s solid. Let me confirm once more. If a=25, then A is {x | 5x -25 ≤0} = {x | x ≤5}. Therefore, 5 is included in A. Since 5 is an integer, it&#39;s in A ∩ Z. If a were 24, then A would be {x | x ≤24/5}= {x |x ≤4.8}. Then 5 would not be in A, since 5 &gt;4.8. Hence, 25 is indeed the minimum. Yep, that seems correct. So, the answer is 25.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( a ) is boxed{25}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( A = {x mid 5x - a leqslant 0, a in mathbf{N}} ), we need to find the minimum value of ( a ) such that ( 5 in A cap mathbf{Z} ).1. The set ( A ) consists of all real numbers ( x ) for which ( 5x - a leq 0 ). This inequality simplifies to ( x leq frac{a}{5} ).2. For ( 5 ) to be in ( A cap mathbf{Z} ), ( 5 ) must satisfy the condition ( 5 leq frac{a}{5} ).3. Solving the inequality ( 5 leq frac{a}{5} ) gives ( a geq 25 ).4. Since ( a ) is a natural number, the smallest value of ( a ) that satisfies this inequality is 25.Verification:- If ( a = 25 ), then ( A = {x mid x leq 5} ), and ( 5 ) is included in ( A ).- If ( a = 24 ), then ( A = {x mid x leq 4.8} ), and ( 5 ) is not included in ( A ).Thus, the minimum value of ( a ) is (boxed{25}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-74091e3a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>🔑:</span>-, 1.25From A leftlvert,=left(-infty, frac{a}{5}right]right., and 5 in A cap mathbf{Z}, we knowfrac{a}{5} geqslant 5 Rightarrow a geqslant 25 text {. }Therefore, the minimum value of a is 25.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-bf57a192 data-v-74091e3a><div class="review" data-v-74091e3a><div class="review-title" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>❓:</span>1. All gnomes are divided into liars and knights. Liars always lie, and knights always tell the truth. On each cell of a 4 times 4 board, there is a gnome.

Each gnome stated: “Among my neighbors (by side) there are an equal number of liars and knights.” How many liars are there in total?</div><div class="divider" data-v-74091e3a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s try to tackle this gnome problem. So, we have a 4x4 grid, each cell has a gnome who is either a knight (always tells the truth) or a liar (always lies). We know there are both knights and liars among them. Each gnome says, &quot;Among my neighbors (by side) there are an equal number of liars and knights.&quot; We need to figure out how many liars there are in total.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Each gnome is on a cell of a 4x4 grid. They can have up to four neighbors (up, down, left, right). Each gnome makes a statement about their neighbors: that the number of liars and knights among them is equal. So, if a gnome is a knight, then the statement must be true, meaning their neighbors have an equal number of liars and knights. If the gnome is a liar, then the statement is false, so among their neighbors, the number of liars and knights is not equal.Since the grid is 4x4, there are 16 gnomes in total. We need to find how many are liars, given that there&#39;s at least one liar and at least one knight.Let me start by considering the possible number of neighbors each gnome can have. The corner cells have two neighbors, edge (but not corner) cells have three neighbors, and the inner cells have four neighbors. So, depending on where a gnome is located, their number of neighbors varies.Since each gnome is talking about their neighbors, their statements are dependent on their position. Let&#39;s think about how the truthfulness of their statements affects the possible counts of liars and knights around them.First, let&#39;s consider a knight (truth-teller). If a knight says that among their neighbors there are equal numbers of liars and knights, then this must be true. So, for a knight, the number of liars and knights adjacent to them must be equal. Since they can have 2, 3, or 4 neighbors, depending on their position:- If a knight is in a corner (2 neighbors), then they must have 1 liar and 1 knight neighbor.- If a knight is on an edge but not a corner (3 neighbors), then they must have 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights, which isn&#39;t possible because you can&#39;t have half a gnome. So this case is impossible. Therefore, a knight cannot be on an edge unless the number of neighbors is even. Wait, edges have 3 neighbors, which is odd. So, for a knight on an edge, they cannot have equal numbers of liars and knights, since 3 is an odd number and can&#39;t be split into two equal integers. Therefore, knights cannot be on the edges. Similarly, the inner cells have 4 neighbors, so if a knight is in an inner cell, they must have 2 liars and 2 knights as neighbors.But wait, hold on. If a knight is on an edge (3 neighbors), the statement would require that half of the neighbors are liars and half are knights, but 3 is odd. Therefore, such a statement can&#39;t be true. Therefore, if a knight is on an edge, their statement would be impossible. But knights always tell the truth, so their statements must be true. Therefore, knights cannot be on edges. Similarly, if a knight is in a corner (2 neighbors), they can have 1 liar and 1 knight neighbor. So corners can have knights. Wait, but corners can have knights only if they have 1 liar and 1 knight neighbor. But the problem is that the neighbors of the corner are edge cells. If the corner is a knight, then its two neighbors (edges) must consist of 1 knight and 1 liar. But if the edges can&#39;t have knights (since knights can&#39;t be on edges as per previous reasoning), that&#39;s a problem.Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s step back. If a knight is in a corner, their two neighbors (edge cells) must be 1 knight and 1 liar. But if knights can&#39;t be on edges (as we thought earlier), then that neighbor knight would have to be on an edge, which would contradict the idea that knights can&#39;t be on edges. Therefore, this seems contradictory.Wait, maybe my initial reasoning is flawed. Let me double-check.If a knight is on a corner, their two neighbors are edge cells. For the knight&#39;s statement to be true, those two neighbors must consist of one knight and one liar. So, one of the edge neighbors must be a knight and the other a liar. However, if we have a knight on an edge, then that edge knight would have three neighbors: the corner, and two inner cells. Let&#39;s consider that edge knight. If the edge knight is a knight, then their statement must be true: their three neighbors (corner, two inner cells) must have equal numbers of liars and knights. But three neighbors can&#39;t be split equally. So, the edge knight&#39;s statement would be impossible. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the corner knight&#39;s neighbor on the edge cannot be a knight, because that would require the edge cell to be a knight, which would have an impossible statement.Therefore, if a corner is a knight, both of its edge neighbors must be liars. But wait, if the corner is a knight, it&#39;s statement is that among its two neighbors (the edges) there are equal numbers of liars and knights. If there&#39;s one knight and one liar, that&#39;s equal. But if both neighbors are liars, that&#39;s not equal. But if we can&#39;t have a knight on the edge, then the only possibility is that both neighbors are liars. But then the knight&#39;s statement would be false (since 2 liars, 0 knights, which is unequal). But that contradicts the fact that the corner is a knight. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Hence, there cannot be any knights in the corners either.Wait, so if we can&#39;t have knights on edges or corners, then knights must be in the inner cells. Let&#39;s check inner cells. Inner cells have four neighbors. If an inner cell is a knight, then among its four neighbors, there must be two liars and two knights. But if knights can only be in the inner cells, then their neighbors (which are other inner cells and edge cells). Wait, but if knights are only in the inner cells, then their neighbors would include edge cells (which can&#39;t be knights, according to previous reasoning). Wait, but let&#39;s map this out.In a 4x4 grid, the inner cells are the 2x2 center cells. Each inner cell is at position (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). Each inner cell has four neighbors: up, down, left, right. For example, cell (2,2) has neighbors (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). Of these, (1,2) and (2,1) are edge cells, and (3,2) and (2,3) are inner cells.If knights are only in the inner cells, then the neighbors of an inner knight would include two edge cells and two inner cells. If the inner cell is a knight, then among its four neighbors, two must be knights and two must be liars. But if all knights are in the inner cells, then the two inner neighbors could be knights or liars, and the two edge neighbors must be liars (since edge cells can&#39;t be knights). So, if an inner knight has two edge neighbors (liars) and two inner neighbors. If the two inner neighbors are knights, then the total would be two liars and two knights, satisfying the knight&#39;s statement. So that could work. But if the inner neighbors are liars, then the knight would have four liars as neighbors, which would make their statement false. Therefore, if an inner cell is a knight, its two inner neighbors must be knights and the two edge neighbors must be liars.But this creates a dependency. Let&#39;s suppose the inner cell (2,2) is a knight. Then, its neighbors (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3) must include two liars and two knights. Since (1,2) and (2,1) are edge cells, which we concluded cannot be knights, they must be liars. Therefore, (3,2) and (2,3) must be knights. Now, looking at cell (3,2), if it&#39;s a knight, its neighbors are (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,3). (2,2) is a knight, (4,2) is an edge cell (liar), (3,1) is an edge cell (liar), and (3,3) is an inner cell. For the statement of (3,2) to be true, among its neighbors there must be two knights and two liars. We have (2,2) is a knight, (4,2) is a liar, (3,1) is a liar, and (3,3) must be a knight. Therefore, (3,3) is a knight. Similarly, looking at cell (2,3), which is a knight, its neighbors are (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4). (1,3) and (2,4) are edge cells (liars), (3,3) is a knight, and (2,2) is a knight. So, neighbors are two knights and two liars, which satisfies the statement. Then, cell (3,3) is a knight, which has neighbors (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4). (2,3) and (3,2) are knights, (4,3) and (3,4) are edge cells (liars). So, two knights and two liars, which is good.Similarly, if we follow this pattern, the inner knights form a 2x2 block in the center. Wait, but in a 4x4 grid, the inner cells are already 2x2. So, if all four inner cells are knights, then each inner knight would have two edge neighbors (liars) and two inner neighbors (knights). That satisfies their statements. Then, the edge and corner cells must all be liars.But wait, the problem states that there are both liars and knights. If all inner cells are knights and all edge and corner cells are liars, that satisfies the problem&#39;s condition. Let&#39;s check the count. In a 4x4 grid, there are 4 inner cells and 12 edge/corner cells. So, 4 knights and 12 liars. But is this possible?Wait, let&#39;s verify the statements of the liars. A liar says that among their neighbors there are equal numbers of liars and knights. Since they are lying, their neighbors must have an unequal number.Take a corner cell, say (1,1). Its neighbors are (1,2) and (2,1), both edge cells. But in this case, edge cells are liars. So, neighbors of (1,1) are two liars. Since (1,1) is a liar, its statement is false. The actual count is two liars and zero knights, which is unequal. So the liar&#39;s statement is a lie, which is correct.Take an edge cell, say (1,2). Its neighbors are (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). (1,1) and (1,3) are edge cells (liars), and (2,2) is an inner cell (knight). So neighbors are two liars and one knight. Since (1,2) is a liar, their statement is false. The actual numbers are two liars and one knight, which is unequal. So that&#39;s correct.Take another edge cell, say (2,1). Its neighbors are (1,1), (3,1), (2,2). (1,1) and (3,1) are edge cells (liars), (2,2) is a knight. So neighbors are two liars and one knight. The liar&#39;s statement is false, so that&#39;s good.Now, check an inner cell, say (2,2). It&#39;s a knight. Its neighbors are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). As established, (1,2) and (2,1) are liars, (3,2) and (2,3) are knights. So two liars and two knights, which is equal. So the knight&#39;s statement is true. Perfect.So in this configuration, all inner cells are knights, and all edge and corner cells are liars. That gives 4 knights and 12 liars. But the problem states that there are both liars and knights, which is satisfied. However, the problem might have a unique solution. Is this the only possible configuration?Wait, let&#39;s see. Are there other possible configurations?Suppose that instead of all inner cells being knights, maybe some of them are liars. Let&#39;s try to see.Suppose one of the inner cells is a liar. Let&#39;s say (2,2) is a liar. Then, since liars lie, the actual number of liars and knights among its neighbors is unequal. The neighbors of (2,2) are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). If (2,2) is a liar, then the statement that there are equal numbers is false. So, the neighbors must have unequal numbers. Let&#39;s assume that in this case, maybe three liars and one knight, or one liar and three knights.But if we have some inner cells as liars, that complicates the dependencies. Let&#39;s try to see.Suppose we have a checkerboard pattern. Maybe knights and liars alternate. But in a 4x4 grid, a checkerboard pattern would have 8 knights and 8 liars. Let&#39;s check if that works.Take a corner cell, say (1,1). If it&#39;s a knight, then its neighbors (1,2) and (2,1) must have equal numbers of liars and knights. If (1,1) is a knight, then (1,2) and (2,1) must be one knight and one liar. But in a checkerboard pattern, (1,1) would be, say, a knight, then (1,2) would be a liar, (2,1) would be a liar, which contradicts the requirement of one knight and one liar. Therefore, a checkerboard pattern might not work.Alternatively, maybe a different pattern. Let&#39;s consider that all edge cells are knights and inner cells are liars. But wait, if edge cells are knights, they have three neighbors. A knight on an edge would need their three neighbors to have equal numbers of liars and knights. But three neighbors can&#39;t be split equally. Therefore, edge cells can&#39;t be knights, so this is impossible.Alternatively, maybe some other configuration. Let&#39;s think again.Earlier, we had a configuration with 12 liars and 4 knights. Is that the only possible one?Suppose we have 8 liars and 8 knights. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible.But considering the constraints:- Corner cells (4 total): if a corner is a knight, neighbors must be 1 knight and 1 liar. But as we saw earlier, if a corner is a knight, then its two edge neighbors must be 1 knight and 1 liar, but edge knights are impossible because they have three neighbors, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, corners must be liars.Therefore, all four corners must be liars.Edge cells (excluding corners): there are 12 total cells on edges and corners. Subtracting 4 corners, there are 8 edge cells. Let&#39;s suppose some of these edge cells are knights. But each edge cell has three neighbors. If an edge cell is a knight, then their three neighbors must have equal numbers of liars and knights, which is impossible (since 3 is odd). Therefore, all edge cells must be liars. Therefore, corners and edges are all liars (12 cells), and inner cells (4 cells) are knights. That&#39;s the only possible configuration. Because if any edge or corner cell is a knight, it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the only possible solution is 12 liars and 4 knights.But wait, the problem says &quot;it is known that among them, there are both liars and knights.&quot; So our solution has both, so that&#39;s okay. Is there any other solution?Suppose that one of the inner cells is a liar. Let&#39;s say (2,2) is a liar. Then, since it&#39;s a liar, the statement &quot;Among my neighbors there are an equal number of liars and knights&quot; is false. Therefore, the neighbors of (2,2) must have an unequal number. The neighbors of (2,2) are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). If (2,2) is a liar, then among these four neighbors, the number of liars and knights is not equal. Let&#39;s suppose that (2,2) is a liar. Then, how many liars and knights are among its neighbors?If (2,2) is a liar, and the rest of the inner cells are knights, then (3,2) and (2,3) are knights, and (1,2) and (2,1) are liars (as before). Then, the neighbors of (2,2) are two liars and two knights. But since (2,2) is a liar, the statement is false, so the neighbors should not have equal numbers. But they do have equal numbers. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, (2,2) cannot be a liar in this configuration.Alternatively, if we make some inner cells liars, maybe. Let&#39;s say (2,2) and (3,3) are liars, while (2,3) and (3,2) are knights. Then, neighbors of (2,2) are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). (1,2) and (2,1) are liars, (3,2) and (2,3) are knights. So two liars and two knights. But (2,2) is a liar, so this should be unequal, but it&#39;s equal. Contradiction. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if we have three liars and one knight among the inner cells. Let&#39;s say (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) are liars, and (3,3) is a knight. Then, neighbors of (2,2) are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). (1,2) and (2,1) are liars, (3,2) and (2,3) are liars. So four liars. Since (2,2) is a liar, the statement is false, so neighbors shouldn&#39;t be equal. Four liars and zero knights is unequal. So that works. Now, check the knight at (3,3). Its neighbors are (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4). (2,3) and (3,2) are liars, (4,3) and (3,4) are edge cells (liars). So all four neighbors are liars. The knight at (3,3) says that neighbors have equal numbers, but there are four liars, which is unequal. Therefore, the knight&#39;s statement is false, which contradicts it being a knight. Therefore, this configuration doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe two inner cells are liars and two are knights. Let&#39;s say (2,2) and (3,3) are liars, (2,3) and (3,2) are knights. Then, neighbors of (2,2): (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). (1,2) and (2,1) are liars, (3,2) and (2,3) are knights. So two liars, two knights. (2,2) is a liar, so neighbors should not be equal. But they are equal. Contradiction. Similarly, neighbors of (3,3) would be (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4). (2,3) and (3,2) are knights, (4,3) and (3,4) are liars. So two knights, two liars. (3,3) is a liar, so neighbors should not be equal. But they are equal. Contradiction again.So having any liars in the inner cells leads to contradictions because their neighbors would have equal numbers, making their false statements problematic. Therefore, the only viable solution is all inner cells are knights and all edge/corner cells are liars, totaling 12 liars.But let&#39;s double-check the edge cells. Take an edge cell, say (1,2). It&#39;s a liar. Its neighbors are (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). (1,1) and (1,3) are liars, (2,2) is a knight. So two liars and one knight. The liar says &quot;equal numbers,&quot; which is a lie, so unequal is correct. That works.Another edge cell, (2,1). It&#39;s a liar. Neighbors are (1,1), (3,1), (2,2). (1,1) and (3,1) are liars, (2,2) is a knight. So two liars, one knight. Unequal, so the liar&#39;s statement is a lie. Correct.Corner cell (4,4). It&#39;s a liar. Neighbors are (4,3) and (3,4). Both are edge cells, which are liars. So two liars. The liar&#39;s statement is &quot;equal numbers,&quot; but there are two liars and zero knights. Unequal, so the lie is maintained. Good.Inner cell (2,2). It&#39;s a knight. Neighbors are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). Two liars and two knights. So equal numbers. The knight&#39;s statement is true. Perfect.Therefore, this configuration works. Now, is there another configuration where the numbers are different?Suppose we try to have some knights on the edges. Let&#39;s assume one edge cell is a knight. Let&#39;s say (1,2) is a knight. Then, its three neighbors (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) must have equal numbers of liars and knights. But since it&#39;s three neighbors, which is odd, equal numbers are impossible. Therefore, (1,2) can&#39;t be a knight. Similarly, any edge cell can&#39;t be a knight. So all edge cells must be liars.Similarly, corner cells. If a corner is a knight, then its two edge neighbors must have equal numbers. But since those edge neighbors are liars, as edges can&#39;t be knights, the corner&#39;s neighbors would be two liars, which would make the knight&#39;s statement false. Therefore, corners must be liars.Therefore, all edge and corner cells must be liars, and inner cells must be knights. Therefore, the total number of liars is 12, and knights are 4.Therefore, the answer should be 12.But let me check once more. Suppose there is another configuration where, for example, some inner cells are liars but others are knights in a way that their statements hold.Wait, if we have a liar in the inner cells, as we tried before, but adjust the numbers. Let&#39;s say one inner cell is a liar. Let&#39;s say (2,2) is a liar. Then, its four neighbors must have an unequal number of liars and knights. Suppose among the four neighbors of (2,2), which are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). If (2,2) is a liar, then these neighbors can&#39;t be two liars and two knights. So maybe three liars and one knight. Let&#39;s say (1,2), (2,1), (3,2) are liars, and (2,3) is a knight. Then, neighbors of (2,2) are three liars and one knight. So unequal, which is good for the liar. Now, check the neighbors of (2,3). (2,3) is a knight. Its neighbors are (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4). (1,3) and (2,4) are edge cells (liars), (3,3) is an inner cell, and (2,2) is a liar. So neighbors: two liars, one knight (3,3), and one liar (2,2). So three liars and one knight. But (2,3) is a knight, so it must have equal numbers. Three liars and one knight is unequal, which would make the knight&#39;s statement false. Contradiction. Therefore, this configuration doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if (2,3) is a knight, then its neighbors must have two liars and two knights. But as above, it&#39;s three liars and one knight. Doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe (2,3) is a knight, and (3,3) is a knight. Then, neighbors of (2,3) would be (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4). (1,3) and (2,4) are liars, (3,3) is a knight, (2,2) is a liar. So two liars, one knight, and one liar. Total: three liars and one knight. Still unequal. So the knight&#39;s statement is false. Contradiction.Alternatively, if we have more knights. Suppose (2,2) is a liar, and (3,2), (2,3), (3,3) are knights. Then, neighbors of (2,2) are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). (1,2) and (2,1) are liars, (3,2) and (2,3) are knights. So two liars and two knights. But (2,2) is a liar, so neighbors must not be equal. Contradiction.Therefore, any configuration with a liar in the inner cells leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the only possible configuration is all inner cells as knights and all edge/corner cells as liars, giving 12 liars.Therefore, the answer is 12.Final Answerboxed{12}&lt;/think&gt;Given a 4 times 4 board where each cell contains a gnome, which can be either a knight (always tells the truth) or a liar (always lies). Each gnome stated that among their neighbors (by side), there are an equal number of liars and knights. We need to determine the total number of liars.1. Key Observations:   - Knights must tell the truth, so their neighbors must have an equal number of liars and knights.   - Liars must lie, so their neighbors must have an unequal number of liars and knights.   - Corner cells have 2 neighbors, edge cells (non-corner) have 3 neighbors, and inner cells have 4 neighbors.2. Analyzing Positions:   - Corners: If a corner cell were a knight, its two neighbors must be one liar and one knight. However, edge cells (neighbors of corners) cannot be knights because they would need an equal split of neighbors, which is impossible for 3 neighbors. Thus, all corners must be liars.   - Edges: Edge cells (non-corner) have 3 neighbors. If an edge cell were a knight, it would need an equal split of neighbors, which is impossible. Thus, all edges must be liars.   - Inner Cells: Inner cells have 4 neighbors. If an inner cell is a knight, its neighbors must be two liars and two knights. If all inner cells are knights, their neighbors (edge cells) are liars, satisfying the condition.3. Configuration Check:   - All inner cells (2x2 center) are knights. Each inner knight has two edge neighbors (liars) and two inner neighbors (knights), satisfying the truth condition.   - All edge and corner cells are liars. Each liar&#39;s neighbors (either two or three liars) do not have an equal split, satisfying the lie condition.4. Verification:   - Corners: Liars with two liar neighbors (unequal, satisfies lie).   - Edges: Liars with two or three liar neighbors (unequal, satisfies lie).   - Inner Cells: Knights with two liar and two knight neighbors (equal, satisfies truth).Thus, the only valid configuration is 12 liars (all edges and corners) and 4 knights (inner cells). The total number of liars is:[boxed{12}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a 4x4 grid of gnomes, each either a knight (always tells the truth) or a liar (always lies). We know there are both liars and knights present. Each gnome says, &quot;Among my neighbors (by side) there are an equal number of liars and knights.&quot; We need to figure out how many liars there are in total.First, let&#39;s understand the problem. Each gnome is on a cell of the 4x4 board. Neighbors are adjacent by side, so each gnome can have up to four neighbors: up, down, left, right. However, those on the edges or corners will have fewer neighbors. For example, a corner gnome has two neighbors, an edge gnome (not corner) has three neighbors, and an inner gnome has four neighbors.Each gnome makes a statement about their neighbors: that the number of liars and knights among them is equal. Since knights tell the truth, if a knight makes this statement, then indeed their neighbors must consist of half liars and half knights. Conversely, liars lie, so if a liar says there are equal numbers, the actual distribution must not be equal; it must be either more knights or more liars.Given the board is 4x4, there are 16 gnomes in total. We need to determine how many are liars. Let&#39;s note that the problem states there are both liars and knights, so we can&#39;t have all liars or all knights.Now, let&#39;s think about possible configurations. Since each gnome&#39;s statement depends on their neighbors, the arrangement of liars and knights must be such that each gnome&#39;s statement is consistent with their type (liar or knight). This seems like a classic puzzle where the constraints propagate across the grid.Perhaps we can start by considering different positions on the grid (corner, edge, inner) and what their statements imply.Let&#39;s start with a corner cell. A corner cell has two neighbors. Suppose a corner gnome is a knight. Then, according to their statement, they must have one liar and one knight as neighbors. Conversely, if a corner gnome is a liar, then their actual neighbors must not be balanced. Since they lie about having equal numbers, their neighbors must be either two liars or two knights.Similarly, for an edge (non-corner) gnome, which has three neighbors. If an edge gnome is a knight, then among their three neighbors, there must be 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights. But that&#39;s impossible since we can&#39;t have half a gnome. Therefore, an edge gnome cannot be a knight because their statement would require an equal number of liars and knights, which is impossible with three neighbors. Wait, that&#39;s an important point.Wait, hold on. The statement is &quot;Among my neighbors there are an equal number of liars and knights.&quot; If a knight (truth-teller) is on an edge (with three neighbors), then they would need exactly 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights, which is impossible. Therefore, such a statement cannot be true. Therefore, any edge gnome must be a liar, because their statement is impossible. Similarly, for inner cells with four neighbors, a knight would require two liars and two knights. A liar in an inner cell would mean the actual number is not two and two, so it must be 0-4, 1-3, 3-1, or 4-0.Wait, but hold on. For edge gnomes (with three neighbors), the knight&#39;s statement would require 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights, which is impossible, so any edge gnome that is a knight would be making a false statement, which can&#39;t happen. Therefore, all edge gnomes must be liars. Similarly, corner gnomes have two neighbors. If a corner gnome is a knight, then exactly one neighbor is a liar and one is a knight. If a corner gnome is a liar, then both neighbors are liars or both are knights.But if all edge gnomes are liars, then what about the corner gnomes? Let&#39;s consider. The corner gnome&#39;s neighbors are edge gnomes. If all edge gnomes are liars, then each corner gnome&#39;s two neighbors are both liars. If a corner gnome is a knight, then according to their statement, there should be one liar and one knight. But both neighbors are liars, so that contradicts the knight&#39;s statement. Therefore, the corner gnome must be a liar. Wait, but if the corner gnome is a liar, then their statement is false. Their statement is that among their neighbors (both liars in this case) there are equal numbers of liars and knights. But since both are liars, the actual numbers are two liars and zero knights. So the liar&#39;s statement is false, which is consistent.But if all edge gnomes are liars, then all corner gnomes must also be liars. Then, the inner gnomes (the 4 in the center) would each have four neighbors. Let&#39;s consider inner gnomes. If an inner gnome is a knight, then among their four neighbors, there should be two liars and two knights. If they are liars, then the actual count is not two and two. But if all their neighbors are edge gnomes, which we just concluded are all liars, wait no. Wait, the inner gnomes are surrounded by other inner gnomes and edge gnomes. Wait, in a 4x4 grid, the inner cells would be the 2x2 center. Each inner cell (there are four inner cells: positions (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) in a 1-based index). Each inner cell has four neighbors: up, down, left, right. For example, cell (2,2) has neighbors (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). Among these, (1,2) and (2,1) are edge cells, while (3,2) and (2,3) are inner cells. Wait, no. Wait, in a 4x4 grid, the edge cells are the ones on the borders. So the inner cells are the four in the center. Each inner cell is adjacent to four other cells: two edge cells and two inner cells? Wait, no. Let me visualize.Let me label the grid as rows 1 to 4 and columns 1 to 4. Then, the edge cells are those in rows 1 or 4, or columns 1 or 4. The inner cells are rows 2-3 and columns 2-3. So, each inner cell (e.g., (2,2)) has neighbors (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). Among these, (1,2) is an edge cell (top edge), (3,2) is another inner cell, (2,1) is edge (left edge), and (2,3) is inner. Wait, no: (3,2) is row 3, column 2. Since row 3 is not an edge (edge rows are 1 and 4), so (3,2) is an inner cell? Wait, no, columns 1 and 4 are edges. So, rows 1 and 4 are edges, columns 1 and 4 are edges. So, cells in rows 2-3 and columns 2-3 are inner. So, (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). Each of these inner cells has four neighbors:For (2,2): up is (1,2) [edge], down is (3,2) [inner], left is (2,1) [edge], right is (2,3) [inner]. So each inner cell has two edge neighbors and two inner neighbors.Similarly, an edge cell not on the corner: take (1,2). Its neighbors are (1,1) [corner], (1,3) [edge], (2,2) [inner]. Wait, (1,2) is on the top edge. Its neighbors: up is out of bounds, down is (2,2), left is (1,1), right is (1,3). So three neighbors: (1,1) corner, (1,3) edge, and (2,2) inner.Wait, actually, the edge cells (non-corner) have three neighbors. For example, (1,2): neighbors are (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). Similarly, (2,1): neighbors are (1,1), (3,1), (2,2). So, each edge cell (non-corner) has one corner neighbor, one adjacent edge neighbor, and one inner neighbor.Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to map out the grid and the neighbors.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a pattern or symmetry we can exploit. Let&#39;s think again about the edge cells.Earlier, I thought that edge gnomes must be liars because if they were knights, they would have to have 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights, which is impossible. Therefore, all edge gnomes must be liars. But let&#39;s confirm this.An edge cell (non-corner) has three neighbors. If an edge gnome is a knight, then the statement &quot;Among my neighbors there are an equal number of liars and knights&quot; would require that there are 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights, which is impossible. Therefore, such a statement cannot be true. Therefore, the edge gnome must be a liar. Hence, all edge gnomes (which are 12 in total: 4 on each side, but subtracting the corners, so 4 sides × 2 = 8 edge non-corner cells, plus 4 corners). Wait, no: total cells are 16. The corners are 4, edge non-corner are 12 - 4 = 12? Wait, no. Let&#39;s count:In a 4x4 grid, the number of edge cells is the perimeter. The perimeter of a grid is calculated as 4n - 4, where n is the side length. So here, n=4, so perimeter cells = 4*4 -4 = 12. Therefore, 12 edge cells (including corners) and 4 inner cells.Therefore, 12 edge cells (4 corners, 8 edge non-corner) and 4 inner cells.So, for each edge cell (corner or edge non-corner), we need to consider their statements.Earlier, we saw that edge non-corner cells have three neighbors, so if they were knights, their statement would require 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights, which is impossible. Therefore, edge non-corner cells must be liars. Similarly, corner cells have two neighbors. If a corner cell is a knight, then their neighbors must be one liar and one knight. If a corner cell is a liar, their neighbors must not be equal. But if all edge non-corner cells are liars, then the neighbors of a corner cell are edge non-corner cells (which are liars) and adjacent corner cells. Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s take a corner cell, say (1,1). Its neighbors are (1,2) and (2,1). Both (1,2) and (2,1) are edge non-corner cells. If we already concluded that edge non-corner cells must be liars, then both neighbors of the corner cell are liars. If the corner cell is a knight, then the knight&#39;s statement would require one liar and one knight, but both neighbors are liars. Contradiction. Therefore, the corner cell must be a liar. Therefore, all corner cells are liars as well.Therefore, all 12 edge cells (corners and edges) must be liars. Then, the inner 4 cells are left. Let&#39;s check the inner cells.Each inner cell has four neighbors: two edge cells (which are liars) and two inner cells. So, neighbors of an inner cell: two liars and two inner cells (which could be knights or liars). Let&#39;s denote the inner cells as potentially knights or liars.If an inner cell is a knight, then its statement &quot;Among my neighbors there are an equal number of liars and knights&quot; must be true. Its neighbors are two liars and two inner cells. So, for the knight&#39;s statement to be true, among the four neighbors, two must be liars and two must be knights. But we already know that two of the neighbors are edge cells, which are liars. Therefore, the remaining two neighbors (which are inner cells) must both be knights. So, if an inner cell is a knight, then its two inner neighbors must be knights.Alternatively, if an inner cell is a liar, then its statement is false, so the number of liars and knights among its neighbors is not equal. The neighbors are two liars (edge) and two inner cells. Let&#39;s denote the two inner neighbors as X and Y. Then total liars among neighbors would be 2 (edge) plus the number of liars among X and Y. Total knights would be 0 (edge) plus the number of knights among X and Y. For the liar&#39;s statement to be false, the number of liars and knights among neighbors must not be equal. So, 2 + (liars in X and Y) ≠ 0 + (knights in X and Y). But since X and Y are either knights or liars, the total liars among neighbors is 2 + (0,1, or 2) depending on X and Y, and knights would be 0 + (2,1, or 0). So, we need 2 + a ≠ 0 + b, where a + b = 2 (since X and Y are two cells). So, 2 + a ≠ (2 - a), which simplifies to 2 + a ≠ 2 - a =&gt; 2a ≠ 0 =&gt; a ≠ 0. Therefore, if the inner cell is a liar, then among its two inner neighbors, there must be at least one liar. So, X and Y cannot both be knights.Now, let&#39;s try to figure out the inner cells. Let&#39;s suppose that all inner cells are knights. Then, each inner cell, being a knight, must have two liars and two knights among their neighbors. Each inner cell has two edge neighbors (liars) and two inner neighbors. If all inner neighbors are knights, then the two inner neighbors are knights, so total neighbors: two liars and two knights. That satisfies the knight&#39;s statement. So, if all inner cells are knights, then their statements are satisfied. But wait, if all inner cells are knights, then the entire board has 12 liars (edges) and 4 knights (inner). But the problem states that there are both liars and knights, which is satisfied here. However, we need to check if this configuration is consistent.Wait, but let&#39;s check the inner cells. Each inner cell is a knight, and their neighbors are two liars and two knights (the other inner cells). That works. However, we also need to check the edge cells. Each edge cell is a liar. A liar&#39;s statement is &quot;Among my neighbors there are an equal number of liars and knights.&quot; Since they are lying, their actual neighbors must not have equal numbers.Let&#39;s take an edge non-corner cell, say (1,2). Its neighbors are (1,1) [corner, liar], (1,3) [edge non-corner, liar], and (2,2) [inner, knight]. So neighbors: two liars and one knight. The liar at (1,2) says there are equal numbers, but actually, there are two liars and one knight. So, the statement is false, which is consistent. Similarly, take a corner cell, say (1,1). Its neighbors are (1,2) and (2,1), both liars. The liar at (1,1) says there are equal numbers, but there are two liars, so the statement is false. Good.Now, check an inner cell. Take (2,2). Its neighbors are (1,2) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (2,1) [liar], (2,3) [knight]. So two liars and two knights. The knight at (2,2) says there are equal numbers, which is true. So this configuration works.Therefore, in this case, we have 12 liars (all edges) and 4 knights (all inner). But the problem says &quot;it is known that among them, there are both liars and knights,&quot; which is satisfied. So, is this the answer? 12 liars?Wait, but the problem might have another possible configuration. Let&#39;s check if there are other possibilities.Suppose instead that some inner cells are liars. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible.Suppose one inner cell is a liar. Let&#39;s say (2,2) is a liar. Then, its neighbors are (1,2) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (2,1) [liar], (2,3) [knight]. So neighbors: two liars and two knights. But since (2,2) is a liar, the statement &quot;Among my neighbors there are an equal number of liars and knights&quot; must be false. But in reality, there are two liars and two knights, which is equal. Therefore, the liar&#39;s statement would be a lie, but the actual is equal, which contradicts. Therefore, (2,2) cannot be a liar if the other inner cells are knights.Alternatively, if we have more than one liar in the inner cells. Suppose two adjacent inner cells are liars. Let&#39;s say (2,2) and (2,3) are liars. Then, let&#39;s check their neighbors.For (2,2): neighbors are (1,2) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (2,1) [liar], (2,3) [liar]. So neighbors: three liars and one knight. The liar at (2,2) says &quot;equal numbers,&quot; but actual is three liars and one knight, so unequal. That&#39;s okay.For (2,3): neighbors are (1,3) [liar], (3,3) [knight], (2,2) [liar], (2,4) [liar]. Wait, (2,4) is an edge cell, so liar. So neighbors: three liars and one knight. Same as above. The liar&#39;s statement is false.But now, the other inner cells, (3,2) and (3,3), which are knights. Their neighbors:For (3,2): neighbors are (2,2) [liar], (4,2) [liar], (3,1) [liar], (3,3) [knight]. So three liars and one knight. But (3,2) is supposed to be a knight, so the statement &quot;equal numbers&quot; must be true. But three liars and one knight is not equal. Contradiction. Therefore, this configuration doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe if we have two liars diagonally in the inner cells. Let&#39;s say (2,2) and (3,3) are liars. Then:For (2,2): neighbors are (1,2) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (2,1) [liar], (2,3) [knight]. So two liars and two knights. But (2,2) is a liar, so the statement must be false. But actual is equal, contradiction. So (2,2) can&#39;t be a liar.Similarly, (3,3): neighbors are (2,3) [knight], (4,3) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (3,4) [liar]. So two liars and two knights. Same problem.Therefore, having any liar in the inner cells seems to cause contradictions because their neighbors would either make their statements true (for knights) or false (for liars) in a conflicting way. Therefore, the only consistent configuration is all inner cells being knights and all edge cells being liars, totaling 12 liars.But wait, let&#39;s check again. If all inner cells are knights and all edge cells are liars, does that hold?Each edge cell (liar) has neighbors: for example, take edge non-corner (1,2). Its neighbors are (1,1) [liar], (1,3) [liar], (2,2) [knight]. So two liars and one knight. The liar says &quot;equal numbers,&quot; which is false, since 2 ≠ 1. Good.Corner cell (1,1) has neighbors (1,2) [liar] and (2,1) [liar]. The liar says &quot;equal numbers,&quot; which would require one liar and one knight, but both are liars. So the statement is false. Good.Inner cell (2,2) has neighbors (1,2) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (2,1) [liar], (2,3) [knight]. Two liars and two knights. The knight&#39;s statement is true. Good.So this configuration works. But the problem states &quot;it is known that among them, there are both liars and knights.&quot; Our configuration satisfies that. So the total number of liars would be 12, and knights 4. But let me think if there&#39;s another possible configuration with a different number of liars.Suppose that not all edge cells are liars. Maybe some edge cells are knights. But wait, earlier we concluded that edge non-corner cells cannot be knights because their statement would require 1.5 liars and knights. But what if we consider that maybe some edge cells are knights and their neighbors actually do have equal numbers? Wait, but for edge non-corner cells with three neighbors, equal numbers would require 1.5 each, which is impossible. Therefore, edge non-corner cells cannot be knights. So all edge non-corner cells must be liars. Similarly, corner cells have two neighbors. If a corner cell is a knight, its neighbors must be one liar and one knight. But the neighbors of a corner cell are edge non-corner cells, which we just said are all liars. Therefore, both neighbors of a corner cell are liars, which contradicts the knight&#39;s statement. Therefore, corner cells must also be liars. Hence, all edge cells (corners and edges) are liars, totaling 12.Therefore, the only possible number of liars is 12. But let&#39;s see if that&#39;s the case.Wait, but what if the inner cells have a mix of knights and liars in a way that still satisfies their statements? For example, suppose two inner cells are knights and two are liars. But we need to check if that&#39;s possible.Suppose two inner cells are liars and two are knights. Let&#39;s arrange them such that the knights have two liars and two knights as neighbors, and the liars have neighbors that are not equal.Take inner cells (2,2) and (3,3) as liars, and (2,3) and (3,2) as knights.Check (2,2) [liar]: neighbors are (1,2) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (2,1) [liar], (2,3) [knight]. So neighbors: two liars and two knights. But since (2,2) is a liar, the statement should be false. However, the actual count is equal, which would make the statement true, contradicting that it&#39;s a liar. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if (2,2) and (2,3) are liars. Their neighbors:For (2,2) [liar]: neighbors (1,2) [liar], (3,2) [knight], (2,1) [liar], (2,3) [liar]. Three liars and one knight. The liar&#39;s statement is false (3 ≠ 1), good.For (2,3) [liar]: neighbors (1,3) [liar], (3,3) [knight], (2,2) [liar], (2,4) [liar]. Three liars and one knight. Similarly, the statement is false, good.Now, the other inner cells (3,2) and (3,3) as knights:For (3,2) [knight]: neighbors (2,2) [liar], (4,2) [liar], (3,1) [liar], (3,3) [knight]. Three liars and one knight. The knight&#39;s statement requires equal numbers, but there&#39;s 3 and 1. Contradiction.Therefore, this configuration doesn&#39;t work. Similarly, any arrangement where inner cells are a mix of knights and liars seems to cause contradictions. Therefore, the only consistent configuration is all inner cells as knights and all edge cells as liars, leading to 12 liars.But wait, another thought: maybe there&#39;s a checkerboard pattern? Knights and liars alternating. Let&#39;s check.In a checkerboard pattern, each knight is surrounded by liars and vice versa. But in this case, each knight would have neighbors that are all liars, and each liar would have neighbors that are all knights. Let&#39;s see if that works.Take a 4x4 grid with alternating knights and liars. However, a 4x4 grid has even dimensions, so a checkerboard pattern would have equal numbers of knights and liars. But let&#39;s check the statements.Suppose (1,1) is a liar, (1,2) knight, (1,3) liar, (1,4) knight, etc., alternating.But let&#39;s consider a knight at (1,2). Its neighbors would be (1,1) [liar], (1,3) [liar], (2,2) [liar]. So three liars. The knight&#39;s statement is &quot;equal number of liars and knights,&quot; which would require 1.5 each, which is impossible. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work. Similarly, a knight in such a pattern would have neighbors mostly liars, leading to unequal numbers. Therefore, the checkerboard pattern doesn&#39;t satisfy the conditions.Therefore, returning to the previous conclusion: the only valid configuration is all edge cells (12) as liars and inner cells (4) as knights. Hence, the number of liars is 12.But let me double-check the problem statement to ensure there&#39;s no trick. It says, &quot;It is known that among them, there are both liars and knights.&quot; Which our solution satisfies. Also, each gnome made the statement, and in our configuration, all knights (inner cells) have two liars and two knights as neighbors, so their statements are true. All liars (edge cells) have neighbors that are not equal, so their statements are false. Therefore, it&#39;s consistent.Thus, the total number of liars is 12.&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves a 4×4 grid of gnomes, each either a knight (truth-teller) or a liar. Each gnome claims their neighbors (adjacent by side) have an equal number of liars and knights. Key observations:1. Edge Cells Analysis:   - Non-corner edge cells have 3 neighbors. A knight here would require 1.5 liars and 1.5 knights, which is impossible. Thus, all non-corner edge cells must be liars.   - Corner cells have 2 neighbors. If a corner cell were a knight, its neighbors would need 1 liar and 1 knight. However, neighbors of corners are edge cells (already liars), making this impossible. Hence, all corner cells are liars.2. Inner Cells Analysis:   - Inner cells have 4 neighbors (2 edge liars and 2 inner cells). If an inner cell is a knight, its neighbors must include 2 liars and 2 knights. Since the edge neighbors are already liars, the two inner neighbors must be knights. This configuration holds if all inner cells are knights.3. Consistency Check:   - Edge cells (liars): Their neighbors include a mix of liars and knights (e.g., a non-corner edge cell has 2 liars and 1 knight neighbor), making their claim of equality false, consistent with lying.   - Inner cells (knights): Their neighbors include 2 liars (edge) and 2 knights (inner), validating their truthful statement.Thus, the only consistent configuration is 12 liars (all edge cells) and 4 knights (all inner cells).

Therefore, these eight dwarfs are liars. Thus, the dwarfs standing in the corners are also liars because both of their neighbors are liars, not a knight and a liar. Therefore, all dwarfs except the four central ones are liars. Since there are knights among the dwarfs, at least one of the four central ones is a knight. Two of his neighbors are already definitely liars, so the two remaining ones are knights. For any of these two neighboring knights to have an equal number of knights and liars among their neighbors, the fourth central dwarf must also be a knight. Thus, there are 12 liars in total.

The equation is:[frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+1} - frac{4|x|}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}} = a - 3]And I need to find the possible integer values of a such that the equation has real roots. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, since there&#39;s an absolute value and a square root, maybe I can simplify the equation by substitution. Let me consider substituting t = |x| / sqrt(x² + 1). Let&#39;s see if that works.Wait, let me check the denominators. The first term is x²/(x² + 1), which is similar to t² if t is x / sqrt(x² + 1). Because if t = x / sqrt(x² + 1), then t² = x² / (x² + 1). That&#39;s exactly the first term! But there&#39;s also a term with 4|x| / sqrt(x² + 1). Since there&#39;s an absolute value, maybe t should be |x| / sqrt(x² + 1). Let me set t = |x| / sqrt(x² + 1). Then t is non-negative, and since |x| is in the numerator, and sqrt(x² + 1) is always positive, t will be between 0 and 1. Because |x| / sqrt(x² + 1) is always less than 1. Let me verify that:Since x² + 1 &gt; x², sqrt(x² + 1) &gt; |x|, so |x| / sqrt(x² + 1) &lt; 1. And obviously, since |x| and sqrt(x² +1) are both non-negative, t ≥ 0. So t ∈ [0, 1).So if I set t = |x| / sqrt(x² + 1), then the first term x²/(x² + 1) is equal to t². Because:t = |x| / sqrt(x² + 1) ⇒ t² = x² / (x² + 1)So the equation becomes:t² - 4t = a - 3So rearranged:t² - 4t - (a - 3) = 0 ⇒ t² - 4t + (3 - a) = 0So that&#39;s a quadratic equation in terms of t. For the original equation to have real roots x, this quadratic equation must have real solutions t in the interval [0, 1), since t is in [0, 1). So first, the quadratic equation must have real roots, and second, those roots must lie within [0, 1). So let&#39;s first analyze the quadratic equation.Quadratic equation: t² - 4t + (3 - a) = 0To have real roots, discriminant D ≥ 0.Discriminant D = 16 - 4 * 1 * (3 - a) = 16 - 12 + 4a = 4 + 4a = 4(a + 1)So D ≥ 0 ⇒ 4(a + 1) ≥ 0 ⇒ a + 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ -1So a must be at least -1. But since a is an integer, a ≥ -1. However, even if D ≥ 0, the solutions for t must lie in [0, 1). So let&#39;s find the roots of the quadratic equation.Using quadratic formula:t = [4 ± sqrt(4(a + 1))]/2 = [4 ± 2sqrt(a + 1)]/2 = 2 ± sqrt(a + 1)So the roots are t = 2 + sqrt(a + 1) and t = 2 - sqrt(a + 1)But since t must be in [0, 1), both roots must satisfy t ∈ [0, 1). Let&#39;s analyze each root.First, t = 2 + sqrt(a + 1). Since sqrt(a + 1) is non-negative, t = 2 + sqrt(a + 1) ≥ 2. But t must be less than 1. So 2 + sqrt(a + 1) &lt; 1 ⇒ sqrt(a + 1) &lt; -1. But sqrt(a + 1) is always non-negative, so this inequality can&#39;t hold. Therefore, t = 2 + sqrt(a + 1) is always ≥ 2, which is outside the interval [0,1). So this root is invalid. Therefore, only the other root t = 2 - sqrt(a + 1) can be in [0, 1).So the only possible solution is t = 2 - sqrt(a + 1). Therefore, we need:0 ≤ 2 - sqrt(a + 1) &lt; 1Let me break this down into two inequalities:1) 2 - sqrt(a + 1) ≥ 0 ⇒ sqrt(a + 1) ≤ 2 ⇒ a + 1 ≤ 4 ⇒ a ≤ 32) 2 - sqrt(a + 1) &lt; 1 ⇒ sqrt(a + 1) &gt; 1 ⇒ a + 1 &gt; 1 ⇒ a &gt; 0So combining these two: 0 &lt; a ≤ 3But since a is an integer, possible values are a = 1, 2, 3Wait, but we need to check whether these a values actually result in t being in [0, 1), and then check if there exists x such that t = |x| / sqrt(x² +1). Because even if t is in [0,1), we need to make sure that t can be achieved by some real x.But for any t in [0,1), we can solve for x. Let me confirm that.Given t = |x| / sqrt(x² +1), let&#39;s solve for x.Let me square both sides: t² = x² / (x² +1)Then t²(x² +1) = x² ⇒ t²x² + t² = x² ⇒ x²(1 - t²) = t² ⇒ x² = t² / (1 - t²)Since x² is non-negative, and since t ∈ [0,1), denominator 1 - t² &gt; 0, so x² is non-negative. Therefore, for any t ∈ [0,1), x can be real, specifically x = ± t / sqrt(1 - t²). So as long as t is in [0,1), there is a real x. Therefore, the key is that t must be in [0,1). So if 0 &lt; a ≤ 3, then t = 2 - sqrt(a +1) must be in [0,1). So let&#39;s check for each integer a from 1 to 3.Wait, but the inequalities gave a &gt; 0 and a ≤3. So a =1,2,3. Let&#39;s check each:For a=1:t = 2 - sqrt(1 +1) = 2 - sqrt(2) ≈ 2 - 1.414 ≈ 0.586, which is between 0 and 1. So okay.For a=2:t = 2 - sqrt(2 +1) = 2 - sqrt(3) ≈ 2 - 1.732 ≈ 0.268, which is between 0 and 1. Okay.For a=3:t = 2 - sqrt(3 +1) = 2 - 2 = 0. So t=0. But t must be less than 1. Wait, t=0 is allowed since the interval is [0,1). So t=0 is acceptable. Then x would be 0. Let&#39;s check:If t=0, then |x| / sqrt(x² +1) =0 ⇒ |x|=0 ⇒ x=0. Then substitute back into original equation:Left-hand side: (0)/(0+1) - (4*0)/sqrt(0+1) = 0 - 0 =0. Right-hand side: a -3. So 0 =a -3 ⇒ a=3. Which is consistent. So x=0 is a solution when a=3. Therefore, a=3 is acceptable.But hold on, when a=3, the quadratic equation becomes t² -4t +0=0 ⇒ t(t -4)=0, so roots t=0 and t=4. Only t=0 is in [0,1). So yes, that works.Similarly, when a=1,2,3, we have t in [0,1). Therefore, possible a values are 1,2,3.But wait, the original problem says a is an integer. So these are the possible integer values.But let me check if there are other possible a values. Earlier, I found that a must be &gt;0 and ≤3. So integers 1,2,3.But let me check a=0. If a=0, then t = 2 - sqrt(0 +1) = 2 -1=1. But t must be less than 1. So t=1 is excluded. Therefore, a=0 is invalid.Similarly, a=4: t=2 - sqrt(4 +1)=2 - sqrt(5)≈2 -2.236≈-0.236, which is less than 0. So invalid.a=-1: Then sqrt(a +1)=sqrt(0)=0, so t=2 -0=2, which is invalid. But a=-1 is allowed by discriminant, but t=2 is invalid. So a=-1 is invalid.So indeed, only a=1,2,3 are possible. Therefore, the possible values of a are 1,2,3.Wait, but let me confirm once more.For each a in 1,2,3, we have t in [0,1). Then x exists as per substitution. Therefore, yes, these a values work.Wait, but let&#39;s check if when a=3, t=0. So x=0. Then substituting back into original equation: 0 -0=0. So 0=a -3 ⇒a=3. Correct.When a=1: t≈0.586. Then x = ± t / sqrt(1 - t²). Let&#39;s compute t=2 - sqrt(2)≈0.5857. Then 1 - t²≈1 - (0.5857)^2≈1 -0.343≈0.657. So sqrt(1 - t²)≈0.81. Then x≈±0.5857 /0.81≈±0.723. Let&#39;s check if this x satisfies original equation.Compute left-hand side:x²/(x² +1) -4|x|/sqrt(x² +1)Let x≈0.723. Then x²≈0.523. x²/(x² +1)=0.523/1.523≈0.343. 4|x|/sqrt(x² +1)=4*0.723 / sqrt(1.523)≈2.892 /1.234≈2.344. So 0.343 -2.344≈-2.001. Then a -3=1 -3=-2. So -2.001≈-2. Close enough, considering rounding errors. So correct.Similarly, for a=2: t≈0.268. Then x=±0.268 / sqrt(1 -0.268²). Let&#39;s compute 0.268²≈0.0718. 1 -0.0718≈0.928. sqrt≈0.963. So x≈0.268 /0.963≈0.278. Then check LHS:x²/(x² +1)=0.077/(0.077 +1)=0.077/1.077≈0.071. 4|x|/sqrt(x² +1)=4*0.278 /sqrt(1.077)≈1.112 /1.038≈1.072. So 0.071 -1.072≈-1.001. Which should equal a -3=2 -3=-1. Correct. So yes.Therefore, a=1,2,3 are valid. Thus, the possible integer values of a are 1,2,3.But just to make sure there&#39;s no other possibilities. Let me check if there&#39;s a case when the quadratic equation has two roots, but one is outside [0,1) and the other is inside. But we saw that the other root is 2 + sqrt(a +1), which is ≥2, so always outside. So only one possible root in [0,1). Therefore, the conclusion is a=1,2,3.Final AnswerThe possible values of ( a ) are (boxed{1}), (boxed{2}), and (boxed{3}).&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation involving ( x ):[frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+1} - frac{4|x|}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}} = a - 3]we need to find the possible integer values of ( a ) such that the equation has real roots. First, we substitute ( t = frac{|x|}{sqrt{x^{2} + 1}} ). This transforms the equation into a quadratic equation in terms of ( t ):[t^{2} - 4t + (3 - a) = 0]For the original equation to have real roots, the quadratic equation must have real solutions ( t ) in the interval ([0, 1)). The discriminant of the quadratic equation must be non-negative:[4(a + 1) geq 0 implies a geq -1]The roots of the quadratic equation are:[t = 2 pm sqrt{a + 1}]We need ( t ) to be in the interval ([0, 1)). The root ( t = 2 + sqrt{a + 1} ) is always greater than or equal to 2, which is outside the interval. Therefore, we consider the root ( t = 2 - sqrt{a + 1} ). For this root to be in ([0, 1)):1. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} geq 0 implies sqrt{a + 1} leq 2 implies a leq 3 )2. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} &lt; 1 implies sqrt{a + 1} &gt; 1 implies a &gt; 0 )Combining these inequalities, we get ( 0 &lt; a leq 3 ). Since ( a ) is an integer, the possible values are ( a = 1, 2, 3 ).Verification for each value:- For ( a = 1 ), ( t = 2 - sqrt{2} approx 0.586 ) (valid).- For ( a = 2 ), ( t = 2 - sqrt{3} approx 0.268 ) (valid).- For ( a = 3 ), ( t = 0 ) (valid).Thus, the possible values of ( a ) are (boxed{1}), (boxed{2}), and (boxed{3}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s tackle this problem. So, we have the equation:frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+1} - frac{4|x|}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}} = a - 3and we need to find the possible integer values of ( a ) such that this equation has real roots. Hmm, okay. Let me think step by step.First, since the equation involves ( |x| ) and ( sqrt{x^2 + 1} ), it might help to make a substitution to simplify things. Let me consider substituting ( t = |x| ). Since ( |x| geq 0 ), ( t ) will be non-negative. Also, ( sqrt{x^2 + 1} = sqrt{t^2 + 1} ). Let me see if I can rewrite the equation in terms of ( t ).Starting with the first term: ( frac{x^2}{x^2 + 1} = frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} ).The second term: ( frac{4|x|}{sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = frac{4t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ).So substituting these into the original equation, we get:frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} - frac{4t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = a - 3Hmm, that looks a bit better. Now, both terms on the left involve ( t ) and ( sqrt{t^2 + 1} ). Maybe we can make another substitution here. Let me set ( y = sqrt{t^2 + 1} ). Then, ( y geq 1 ), since ( t geq 0 ).But wait, if ( y = sqrt{t^2 + 1} ), then ( y^2 = t^2 + 1 ), so ( t^2 = y^2 - 1 ). Also, ( t = sqrt{y^2 - 1} ). Hmm, but ( t geq 0 ), so that&#39;s okay. Let&#39;s see if we can express the equation in terms of ( y ).First term: ( frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} = frac{y^2 - 1}{y^2} = 1 - frac{1}{y^2} ).Second term: ( frac{4t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = frac{4sqrt{y^2 - 1}}{y} ).So substituting these into the equation:1 - frac{1}{y^2} - frac{4sqrt{y^2 - 1}}{y} = a - 3Let me rearrange this equation:1 - frac{1}{y^2} - frac{4sqrt{y^2 - 1}}{y} + 3 = aWait, no. Wait, the original equation is equal to ( a - 3 ), so:1 - frac{1}{y^2} - frac{4sqrt{y^2 - 1}}{y} = a - 3Therefore, bringing the ( -3 ) to the left:1 - frac{1}{y^2} - frac{4sqrt{y^2 - 1}}{y} + 3 = aSo that&#39;s:4 - frac{1}{y^2} - frac{4sqrt{y^2 - 1}}{y} = aHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another substitution. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps express the entire left-hand side in terms of ( y ), but let me check.Alternatively, perhaps instead of substituting ( y ), let me look back at the equation in terms of ( t ):frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} - frac{4t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = a - 3Let me denote ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ). Then, ( u ) is a function of ( t ). Let&#39;s see:Since ( t geq 0 ), ( u geq 0 ). Also, ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ), so ( u^2 = frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} ), which is the first term in our equation. Therefore, the equation becomes:u^2 - 4u = a - 3That&#39;s a much simpler equation! Wait, is that right?Let me check:Original left-hand side:( frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} - frac{4t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ).But ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ), so ( u^2 = frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} ), and ( frac{4t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = 4u ).Therefore, yes, the left-hand side is ( u^2 - 4u ).Therefore, the equation becomes:( u^2 - 4u = a - 3 )So, rearranged:( u^2 - 4u - (a - 3) = 0 )Which is:( u^2 - 4u + (3 - a) = 0 )So, quadratic in ( u ). Let&#39;s denote this as:( u^2 - 4u + (3 - a) = 0 )So, we can solve for ( u ):Using quadratic formula:( u = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4(1)(3 - a)}}{2} )Simplify discriminant:( 16 - 4(3 - a) = 16 - 12 + 4a = 4 + 4a = 4(a + 1) )Therefore,( u = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{a + 1}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{a + 1} )So, ( u = 2 + sqrt{a + 1} ) or ( u = 2 - sqrt{a + 1} )But we need to remember that ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ), which is between 0 and 1, since ( t geq 0 ).Wait, because ( t geq 0 ), ( sqrt{t^2 + 1} geq t ), so ( frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} leq 1 ). So ( u in [0, 1] ).Therefore, the solutions ( u = 2 pm sqrt{a + 1} ) must lie within [0, 1].So, we have two equations:1. ( 2 + sqrt{a + 1} in [0, 1] )2. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} in [0, 1] )Let&#39;s analyze each case.First equation: ( 2 + sqrt{a + 1} leq 1 )But since ( sqrt{a + 1} geq 0 ), the left-hand side is at least 2, which is already greater than 1. Therefore, this equation has no solution. So, only the second equation is possible:( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} in [0, 1] )Which implies:( 0 leq 2 - sqrt{a + 1} leq 1 )Let me solve this inequality.First, left inequality:( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} geq 0 implies sqrt{a + 1} leq 2 implies a + 1 leq 4 implies a leq 3 )Right inequality:( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} leq 1 implies -sqrt{a + 1} leq -1 implies sqrt{a + 1} geq 1 implies a + 1 geq 1 implies a geq 0 )So combining both inequalities, ( 0 leq a leq 3 )But ( a ) is an integer. So possible values for ( a ) are 0, 1, 2, 3.But wait, we need to check if these values of ( a ) actually lead to valid solutions for ( u ), and subsequently for ( t ) and ( x ). So let&#39;s verify for each integer ( a ) from 0 to 3.Also, note that ( sqrt{a + 1} ) must be real, so ( a + 1 geq 0 implies a geq -1 ). But since we already have ( a geq 0 ) from above, this is already satisfied.So, possible ( a in {0, 1, 2, 3} ). Let&#39;s check each one:1. Case ( a = 0 ):Then, ( sqrt{a + 1} = sqrt{1} = 1 ), so ( u = 2 - 1 = 1 )Check if ( u = 1 ) is possible. Since ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = 1 implies frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = 1 implies t = sqrt{t^2 + 1} implies t^2 = t^2 + 1 implies 0 = 1 ). That&#39;s a contradiction. So, ( u = 1 ) is not attainable. Therefore, ( a = 0 ) is not a valid solution.Wait, that&#39;s a problem. So even though ( a = 0 ) satisfies the inequality ( 0 leq a leq 3 ), the corresponding ( u = 1 ) is not possible. So, we have to check if the value of ( u ) actually lies in [0,1) because when ( t ) approaches infinity, ( u ) approaches 1, but never actually reaches 1.Therefore, ( u in [0, 1) ). So, even if ( u = 1 ) is in the interval [0,1], since it&#39;s not actually attainable, we need to adjust our interval.Therefore, the correct interval for ( u ) is [0,1). Therefore, when solving ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} in [0,1) ), the upper bound is strict.So, let&#39;s re-examine the inequalities with this in mind.We have ( 0 leq 2 - sqrt{a + 1} &lt; 1 )Breaking into two inequalities:1. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} geq 0 implies sqrt{a + 1} leq 2 implies a leq 3 )2. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} &lt; 1 implies sqrt{a + 1} &gt; 1 implies a + 1 &gt; 1 implies a &gt; 0 )Therefore, combining these, ( 0 &lt; a leq 3 )Since ( a ) is an integer, possible values are ( a = 1, 2, 3 )Now, let&#39;s check each of these:Case ( a = 1 ):( sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2} approx 1.414 )Thus, ( u = 2 - sqrt{2} approx 0.5857 ), which is in [0,1). So, valid.Now, we need to check if there exists ( t geq 0 ) such that ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = 2 - sqrt{2} )Let me solve for ( t ):( frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = 2 - sqrt{2} )Square both sides:( frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} = (2 - sqrt{2})^2 = 4 - 4sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 - 4sqrt{2} )Multiply both sides by ( t^2 + 1 ):( t^2 = (6 - 4sqrt{2})(t^2 + 1) )Bring all terms to left-hand side:( t^2 - (6 - 4sqrt{2})t^2 - (6 - 4sqrt{2}) = 0 )Factor:( t^2 [1 - (6 - 4sqrt{2})] - (6 - 4sqrt{2}) = 0 )Calculate ( 1 - (6 - 4sqrt{2}) = -5 + 4sqrt{2} )So:( (-5 + 4sqrt{2}) t^2 - (6 - 4sqrt{2}) = 0 )Multiply both sides by -1:( (5 - 4sqrt{2}) t^2 + (6 - 4sqrt{2}) = 0 )Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me compute the coefficients numerically.First, ( 5 - 4sqrt{2} approx 5 - 5.656 approx -0.656 )( 6 - 4sqrt{2} approx 6 - 5.656 approx 0.344 )So equation becomes:( -0.656 t^2 + 0.344 = 0 implies -0.656 t^2 = -0.344 implies t^2 = 0.344 / 0.656 approx 0.524 )Thus, ( t approx sqrt{0.524} approx 0.724 ), which is a real number. Therefore, there exists a real ( t ), which implies there exists real ( x ). Therefore, ( a = 1 ) is valid.Case ( a = 2 ):( sqrt{2 + 1} = sqrt{3} approx 1.732 )Thus, ( u = 2 - sqrt{3} approx 0.2679 ), which is in [0,1). Valid.Again, solving ( frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = 2 - sqrt{3} )Square both sides:( frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} = (2 - sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 4sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 - 4sqrt{3} )Multiply both sides by ( t^2 + 1 ):( t^2 = (7 - 4sqrt{3})(t^2 + 1) )Bring all terms to left:( t^2 - (7 - 4sqrt{3}) t^2 - (7 - 4sqrt{3}) = 0 )Factor:( t^2 [1 - (7 - 4sqrt{3})] - (7 - 4sqrt{3}) = 0 )Compute ( 1 - (7 - 4sqrt{3}) = -6 + 4sqrt{3} approx -6 + 6.928 = 0.928 )So:( (-6 + 4sqrt{3}) t^2 - (7 - 4sqrt{3}) = 0 )Numerically:( 0.928 t^2 - (7 - 6.928) approx 0.928 t^2 - 0.072 = 0 )So:( 0.928 t^2 = 0.072 implies t^2 approx 0.072 / 0.928 ≈ 0.0776 implies t ≈ 0.278 ), which is real. Therefore, valid. Hence, ( a = 2 ) is okay.Case ( a = 3 ):( sqrt{3 + 1} = 2 )Thus, ( u = 2 - 2 = 0 ). So, ( u = 0 ).But ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = 0 implies t = 0 ). Therefore, ( t = 0 implies x = 0 ). Let&#39;s check if x=0 is a solution.Plug x=0 into original equation:Left-hand side:( 0 / (0 + 1) - (4*0)/1 = 0 - 0 = 0 )Right-hand side:( a - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 )So, 0=0. Therefore, x=0 is a valid solution. Therefore, ( a = 3 ) is valid.So, the possible integer values of ( a ) are 1, 2, 3.Wait, but earlier when we considered ( a = 0 ), even though the inequality ( 0 leq a leq 3 ) included 0, the actual substitution led to a contradiction. So, our corrected possible values after considering the strict inequality are 1, 2, 3.But let me just verify ( a = 3 ) again. When ( a = 3 ), we get ( u = 0 ), which gives ( t = 0 ), which gives ( x = 0 ), and that works. So yes, 3 is valid.Similarly, for ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 2 ), we found real solutions for ( t ), hence for ( x ).Therefore, the possible integer values of ( a ) are 1, 2, 3.But let me check if there are any other constraints we might have missed.Wait, another approach: Let&#39;s consider the original substitution. Let me consider the substitution ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ), which we found leads to ( u^2 - 4u = a - 3 ). So, the equation becomes ( u^2 - 4u - (a - 3) = 0 ), which we solved.But another way to think about this is to express ( a ) in terms of ( u ):( a = u^2 - 4u + 3 )Since ( u in [0, 1) ), then ( a ) is a function of ( u ). Therefore, the range of ( a ) is the image of the function ( f(u) = u^2 - 4u + 3 ) over ( u in [0, 1) ).Let me analyze this function.( f(u) = u^2 - 4u + 3 )This is a quadratic function opening upwards (since coefficient of ( u^2 ) is positive). Its vertex is at ( u = -b/(2a) = 4/(2) = 2 ), which is outside the interval [0,1). Therefore, over [0,1), the function is decreasing.Compute ( f(0) = 0 - 0 + 3 = 3 )Compute ( f(1) = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0 )But since the interval is [0,1), the maximum value is 3 (attained at u=0), and the function approaches 0 as ( u ) approaches 1. Therefore, the range of ( a ) is (0, 3].But ( a ) must be an integer, so ( a in {1, 2, 3} ). Wait, but 3 is included because when u=0, which is attainable at t=0 (x=0). So, a=3 is possible. When approaching u=1, a approaches 0, but a=0 is not attainable. Therefore, the possible integer values of a are 1, 2, 3.Therefore, confirming our previous conclusion. Thus, the answer is ( a = 1, 2, 3 ).Final AnswerThe possible values of ( a ) are boxed{1}, boxed{2}, and boxed{3}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation:frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+1} - frac{4|x|}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}} = a - 3we need to find the possible integer values of ( a ) such that the equation has real roots. First, we substitute ( t = |x| ) which gives ( t geq 0 ). This transforms the equation into:frac{t^2}{t^2 + 1} - frac{4t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = a - 3Next, we substitute ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ), which simplifies the equation to:u^2 - 4u = a - 3This is a quadratic equation in ( u ):u^2 - 4u + (3 - a) = 0Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get:u = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{a + 1}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{a + 1}Since ( u = frac{t}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ) must lie in the interval ([0, 1)), we analyze the solutions:1. ( 2 + sqrt{a + 1} ) is not valid as it exceeds 1.2. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} ) must lie in ([0, 1)).This leads to the inequalities:0 leq 2 - sqrt{a + 1} &lt; 1Solving these inequalities, we find:1. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} geq 0 implies sqrt{a + 1} leq 2 implies a leq 3 )2. ( 2 - sqrt{a + 1} &lt; 1 implies sqrt{a + 1} &gt; 1 implies a &gt; 0 )Thus, ( 0 &lt; a leq 3 ). Since ( a ) is an integer, the possible values are ( a = 1, 2, 3 ).Verifying each value:- For ( a = 1 ), ( u = 2 - sqrt{2} ) leads to a valid solution for ( t ).- For ( a = 2 ), ( u = 2 - sqrt{3} ) leads to a valid solution for ( t ).- For ( a = 3 ), ( u = 0 ) leads to ( t = 0 ), which is valid.Thus, the possible values of ( a ) are boxed{1}, boxed{2}, and boxed{3}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-74091e3a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>🔑:</span>二、1.1,2,3.From the original equation, we getleft(frac{|x|}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}}-2right)^{2}=1+a text {. }Also, from 0 leqslant frac{|x|}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}}&lt;1, we know1&lt;left(frac{|x|}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}}-2right)^{2} leqslant 4,which implies 1&lt;1+a leqslant 4 Rightarrow 0&lt;a leqslant 3.Therefore, the possible values of a are 1,2,3.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-bf57a192 data-v-74091e3a><div class="review" data-v-74091e3a><div class="review-title" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>❓:</span>The cube A B C D E F G H on the table has three vertical edges divided by points K, L, and M in the ratios 1: 2, 1: 3, and 1: 4 respectively, as shown in the figure.

Let me start by understanding the problem better. The cube is sitting on the table, so probably one of its faces is the base. The vertical edges are divided by points K, L, and M in the ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 respectively. First, I should visualize the cube. Let me label the vertices. Let&#39;s assume the cube is labeled such that ABCD is the bottom face and EFGH is the top face, with E above A, F above B, etc. So the vertical edges are AE, BF, CG, DH. Wait, but the problem mentions three vertical edges divided by points K, L, and M. So maybe each of these points is on a different vertical edge? The ratios are 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. Hmm. Wait, the problem says &quot;three vertical edges divided by points K, L, and M in the ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 respectively.&quot; So each point divides a vertical edge in a specific ratio. Let me clarify: if a point divides a vertical edge in the ratio 1:2, does that mean the segment from the bottom to the point is 1 part, and from the point to the top is 2 parts? So for example, if the edge length is 3 units, then the point would be 1 unit from the bottom and 2 units from the top. But since the cube&#39;s edge length is probably 1 (as it&#39;s a unit cube unless specified otherwise), the ratios would correspond to fractions. Wait, actually, cubes in such problems are often considered to have edge length 1 for simplicity unless stated otherwise. So, let&#39;s assume the edge length is 1. Then, for the vertical edges divided by K, L, M in ratios 1:2, 1:3, 1:4. So:- For K: the ratio is 1:2, so from the bottom to K is 1/(1+2) = 1/3, and from K to the top is 2/3.Wait, hold on. If the ratio is 1:2, then the segment closer to the bottom is 1 part, and closer to the top is 2 parts. So, the total parts are 1+2=3, so K divides the edge such that the lower segment is 1/3 of the edge length, and the upper segment is 2/3. Similarly for L and M.Similarly, L is on another vertical edge, divided in the ratio 1:3, so from the bottom to L is 1/4, and from L to the top is 3/4. And M is on another vertical edge with ratio 1:4, so bottom to M is 1/5, and M to top is 4/5.But wait, the problem says three vertical edges. So each of K, L, M is on a different vertical edge. So perhaps K is on edge AE, L on BF, and M on CG? Or some other combination? The figure is referenced, but since I don&#39;t have the figure, I need to make an assumption.Assuming the cube is labeled ABCD as the bottom face with A at the origin (assuming coordinate system), B along the x-axis, D along the y-axis, and E upwards along the z-axis. So vertices would be:A(0,0,0), B(1,0,0), C(1,1,0), D(0,1,0), E(0,0,1), F(1,0,1), G(1,1,1), H(0,1,1).If that&#39;s the case, the vertical edges are AE (from A(0,0,0) to E(0,0,1)), BF (B(1,0,0) to F(1,0,1)), CG (C(1,1,0) to G(1,1,1)), and DH (D(0,1,0) to H(0,1,1)).So, if K, L, M are on three different vertical edges. Let&#39;s say K is on AE, L on BF, M on CG. Then:- K divides AE in ratio 1:2. So starting from A (bottom), the length from A to K is 1/(1+2) = 1/3, so K is at (0,0,1/3).- L divides BF in ratio 1:3. From B (bottom), so length from B to L is 1/(1+3) = 1/4, so L is at (1,0,1/4).- M divides CG in ratio 1:4. From C (bottom) to M is 1/(1+4) = 1/5, so M is at (1,1,1/5).Alternatively, the problem might have M on DH, but the problem says three vertical edges. Since there are four vertical edges, perhaps three of them are chosen. But without the figure, it&#39;s a bit ambiguous. But since the problem mentions K, L, M on three vertical edges, perhaps each on different edges. Let me go with K on AE, L on BF, M on CG as I initially thought. So their coordinates would be K(0,0,1/3), L(1,0,1/4), M(1,1,1/5).But wait, the cube is on the table, so the base is one face, probably ABCD. So the vertical edges are AE, BF, CG, DH. So K, L, M are on three of these. Let me confirm:If K is on AE, then from A (bottom) to K is 1/3, so K is at (0,0,1/3).If L is on BF, from B (bottom) to L is 1/4, so L is at (1,0,1/4).If M is on CG, from C (bottom) to M is 1/5, so M is at (1,1,1/5).Alternatively, if M is on DH, from D (bottom) to M would be 1/5, so M is at (0,1,1/5). But since the problem says the plane KLM cuts the cube into two parts. Depending on where K, L, M are, the plane&#39;s orientation changes.Wait, to resolve this, maybe I need to consider that the three points are on three adjacent vertical edges? For instance, AE, BF, and CG? That way, the plane KLM would slice through the cube from near the bottom on one edge to higher up on another. Alternatively, if they are on non-adjacent edges, the plane might be different.Alternatively, perhaps K is on AE, L on BF, and M on DH. Let&#39;s check:If M is on DH, divided in ratio 1:4, so from D (bottom) to M is 1/5, so M is at (0,1,1/5).But then the plane KLM would connect points on AE, BF, and DH. Since AE, BF, and DH are three different edges, but DH is on the opposite side of the cube from AE and BF.Alternatively, maybe the points are on adjacent edges. Let me think.Given that the figure is shown, but since I can&#39;t see it, I need to make a logical assumption.Assuming K, L, M are on three different vertical edges, each on adjacent edges. For example, AE, BF, and CG. Then the plane would go through those three points.Alternatively, maybe K, L, M are on edges AE, BF, and DH. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different labeling. Let me check standard cube labeling.In standard cube labeling, ABCD is the base, EFGH the top, with E above A, F above B, G above C, H above D. So edges:AE, BF, CG, DH are vertical edges.So vertical edges are AE (A to E), BF (B to F), CG (C to G), DH (D to H).So K, L, M are on three of these four edges.Given that there are three points, each on a different vertical edge. Let me suppose K is on AE, L on BF, M on CG. Then coordinates as follows:K is on AE, ratio 1:2. So from A (0,0,0) to E (0,0,1). So 1:2 means AK:KE = 1:2. So AK = 1/3, KE = 2/3. So K is at (0,0,1/3).Similarly, L is on BF, ratio 1:3. From B (1,0,0) to F (1,0,1). BL:LF = 1:3. So BL = 1/4, LF = 3/4. So L is at (1,0,1/4).M is on CG, ratio 1:4. From C (1,1,0) to G (1,1,1). CM:MG = 1:4. So CM = 1/5, MG = 4/5. So M is at (1,1,1/5).Alternatively, if M is on DH, then DM:MH = 1:4. From D (0,1,0) to H (0,1,1). So DM = 1/5, so M is at (0,1,1/5). But that would place M on the DH edge. Depending on which edges are chosen, the plane&#39;s orientation would change.But perhaps the problem has K, L, M on edges AE, BF, and DH. Let&#39;s check:If K is on AE at (0,0,1/3), L on BF at (1,0,1/4), and M on DH at (0,1,1/5). Then the plane passes through these three points.Alternatively, maybe M is on CG. Let me proceed with K on AE, L on BF, M on CG as the first assumption.So coordinates:K(0,0,1/3), L(1,0,1/4), M(1,1,1/5).Now, I need to find the equation of the plane passing through these three points, then determine the volume of the part of the cube below this plane and the volume above, then find their ratio.Alternatively, perhaps the plane cuts the cube into two parts, one smaller and one larger. The key is to compute the volume of one part, then subtract from the cube&#39;s total volume (which is 1, assuming unit cube) to get the other part.First, let&#39;s confirm if the cube is unit. Since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, but ratios are given, the actual edge length might not matter, as the ratio would be the same regardless. But for simplicity, let&#39;s assume edge length 1.So, the cube has volume 1. We need to find the volume below plane KLM and above plane KLM, then take their ratio.To find the volume under the plane within the cube, perhaps we can use integration, but that might be complex. Alternatively, since it&#39;s a plane cutting the cube, the resulting shape is a polyhedron, and we can decompose it into simpler shapes like pyramids or prisms.Alternatively, use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron, but since the intersection is not necessarily a tetrahedron.Alternatively, use the concept of determinants or mass point geometry. Hmm.Alternatively, use the method of finding the intersection points of the plane with the cube edges, then decompose the resulting polyhedron.Alternatively, use the formula for the volume cut off by a plane in a cube. I recall that in such cases, if you can express the plane equation as ax + by + cz = d, then the volume under the plane can be calculated by integrating over the cube or using geometric interpretations.But let me proceed step by step.First, find the equation of the plane passing through points K(0,0,1/3), L(1,0,1/4), and M(1,1,1/5).To find the plane equation, we can use the general plane equation ax + by + cz = d. Plug in the three points to get three equations, then solve for a, b, c, d.Alternatively, compute two vectors on the plane and find the normal vector.Vectors KL and KM can be used.Vector KL = L - K = (1-0, 0-0, 1/4 - 1/3) = (1, 0, -1/12)Vector KM = M - K = (1-0, 1-0, 1/5 - 1/3) = (1, 1, -2/15)Then, the normal vector n = KL × KM.Compute cross product:KL = (1, 0, -1/12)KM = (1, 1, -2/15)Cross product n = |i   j   k|                 |1   0  -1/12|                 |1   1  -2/15|= i*(0*(-2/15) - (-1/12)*1) - j*(1*(-2/15) - (-1/12)*1) + k*(1*1 - 0*1)Compute each component:i: 0 - (-1/12)(1) = 1/12j: -( [1*(-2/15) - (-1/12)(1) ]) = -[ -2/15 + 1/12 ] = -[ (-8/60 + 5/60) ] = -[ -3/60 ] = -[ -1/20 ] = 1/20k: 1*1 - 0*1 = 1So the normal vector n = (1/12, 1/20, 1)To make it simpler, multiply all components by 60 to eliminate denominators:n = (5, 3, 60)But actually, the normal vector can be scaled, so perhaps we can keep it as (1/12, 1/20, 1) for the plane equation.The plane equation is then:(1/12)(x - 0) + (1/20)(y - 0) + 1(z - 1/3) = 0Wait, plane equation using point K(0,0,1/3):The general equation is a(x - x0) + b(y - y0) + c(z - z0) = 0, where (a, b, c) is the normal vector and (x0, y0, z0) is a point on the plane.So substituting:(1/12)(x - 0) + (1/20)(y - 0) + 1*(z - 1/3) = 0Simplify:(1/12)x + (1/20)y + z - 1/3 = 0Multiply all terms by 60 to eliminate denominators:5x + 3y + 60z - 20 = 0So the plane equation is 5x + 3y + 60z = 20Wait, but check this:Original equation after substitution:(1/12)x + (1/20)y + z = 1/3Multiply by 60:5x + 3y + 60z = 20Yes, that&#39;s correct.So plane equation is 5x + 3y + 60z = 20.But let&#39;s check if this plane passes through all three points K, L, M.Check for K(0,0,1/3):5*0 + 3*0 + 60*(1/3) = 0 + 0 + 20 = 20. Correct.Check for L(1,0,1/4):5*1 + 3*0 + 60*(1/4) = 5 + 0 + 15 = 20. Correct.Check for M(1,1,1/5):5*1 + 3*1 + 60*(1/5) = 5 + 3 + 12 = 20. Correct.Okay, so the plane equation is correct: 5x + 3y + 60z = 20.Alternatively, we can simplify this equation by dividing by a common factor, but since the coefficients are already integers, maybe leave it as is.But let&#39;s see if we can simplify:Divide both sides by GCD(5,3,60,20). GCD of 5,3 is 1; GCD of 1 and 60 is 1; GCD of 1 and 20 is 1. So no simplification.So the plane equation is 5x + 3y + 60z = 20.Alternatively, perhaps write it as z = (20 - 5x - 3y)/60, but that might not be necessary.Now, to find the volume of the part of the cube below this plane. Since the cube is from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1), but let&#39;s confirm the cube&#39;s edge length. Wait, in our coordinate system, we assumed edge length 1, so the cube spans from x=0 to 1, y=0 to 1, z=0 to 1.The plane equation 5x + 3y + 60z = 20. Let&#39;s check where this plane intersects the cube.First, let&#39;s see the intercepts.x-intercept: set y=0, z=0: 5x = 20 =&gt; x=4. Which is outside the cube (since x=1 is the max).y-intercept: set x=0, z=0: 3y =20 =&gt; y≈6.666, also outside.z-intercept: set x=0, y=0: 60z=20 =&gt; z=1/3. Which is inside the cube.Therefore, the plane intersects the cube within the cube&#39;s bounds only at certain edges. Since the intercepts outside the cube, the plane slices through the cube somewhere inside.To find the volume under the plane, we need to determine all the intersection points of the plane with the cube edges, then model the resulting polyhedron and compute its volume.So, first, find all intersection points between the plane and the cube edges.The cube has 12 edges. Each edge is along one axis, either x, y, or z.For each edge, check if the plane intersects it. Since the plane equation is 5x + 3y + 60z = 20.Let&#39;s check each edge:1. Edge AE: from A(0,0,0) to E(0,0,1). Parametrize as (0,0,t), t∈[0,1]. Plug into plane: 5*0 + 3*0 +60*t =20 → 60t=20 → t=1/3. Which is point K(0,0,1/3). So intersection at K.2. Edge BF: from B(1,0,0) to F(1,0,1). Parametrize as (1,0,t), t∈[0,1]. Plug into plane: 5*1 +3*0 +60*t=20 →5 +60t=20 →60t=15 →t=15/60=1/4. So intersection at L(1,0,1/4).3. Edge CG: from C(1,1,0) to G(1,1,1). Parametrize as (1,1,t), t∈[0,1]. Plug into plane:5*1 +3*1 +60*t=20 →5+3+60t=8 +60t=20 →60t=12 →t=12/60=1/5. So intersection at M(1,1,1/5).4.

Outside.So, the plane intersects the cube along four edges: AE at K, BF at L, CG at M, and DH at N(0,1,17/60).Wait, but earlier, we had three points K, L, M given in the problem. The fourth intersection point N is on DH. So the plane intersects the cube at four points: K, L, M, N. Therefore, the intersection polygon is a quadrilateral KLMN.Therefore, the shape of the intersection is a quadrilateral with vertices at K(0,0,1/3), L(1,0,1/4), M(1,1,1/5), and N(0,1,17/60).Now, to compute the volume under the plane (i.e., the part of the cube below the plane KLMN), we need to figure out the shape of this region. The region would be a portion of the cube bounded by the quadrilateral KLMN and the cube&#39;s faces.Alternatively, since the plane cuts through four vertical edges, the resulting solid is a kind of truncated pyramid or a frustum-like shape, but in three dimensions.Alternatively, since it&#39;s a four-sided figure, perhaps decompose the volume into simpler parts. For example, split the solid into pyramids or tetrahedrons whose volumes can be calculated.Alternatively, use the divergence theorem or integrate over the region. But integrating might be complicated.Alternatively, use the formula for the volume under a plane within a cube. There&#39;s a method where if you have a plane cutting the cube, you can use the coordinates of the intersection points to compute the volume.Alternatively, use the following approach: since the plane intersects four vertical edges, and we have the heights (z-coordinates) at each of these edges. Then, the volume can be computed by considering the &quot;heights&quot; at each corner and integrating, but since the plane is linear, perhaps we can use the average height?Wait, another method: the volume under the plane within the cube can be calculated using the formula for the volume bounded by a plane and the cube. This can be done by decomposing the polyhedron formed by the plane and the cube into tetrahedrons or other simple solids.But let&#39;s think step by step.First, note that the intersection quadrilateral KLMN is a four-sided figure. Let me check if it&#39;s planar, which it is, since it&#39;s part of the plane KLM.Wait, the plane intersects four edges, so the intersection is a quadrilateral. Therefore, the volume under the plane would be a portion of the cube bounded by this quadrilateral and the base of the cube.Wait, but the plane passes through K, L, M, N. If we imagine looking at the cube from the top, the intersection points are on the four vertical edges. So connecting these points would form a quadrilateral that slices through the cube.To compute the volume under the plane, maybe we can split the cube into regions and calculate accordingly.Alternatively, use the convex hull of the four points K, L, M, N and the base of the cube. Wait, but the base is at z=0, and the plane is above z=1/5 (the lowest point M is at z=1/5). So the volume under the plane would be the space between z=0 and the plane, bounded by the cube.Alternatively, imagine that the region under the plane is a kind of sloped surface connecting the four points K, L, M, N. To compute its volume, perhaps use the formula for the volume of a prismatoid.A prismatoid is a polyhedron with all vertices lying in two parallel planes. The formula for the volume of a prismatoid is:V = (h/6)(A1 + A2 + 2Am)where h is the distance between the two planes, A1 and A2 are the areas of the two parallel faces, and Am is the area of the midsection.But in our case, the two bases are not necessarily parallel. Wait, the base is the quadrilateral KLMN, which is on the plane, and the other base is the base of the cube (z=0). However, the cube&#39;s base is a square, and the plane is inclined. Wait, but the regions between z=0 and the plane would form a kind of prismatoid where the top face is KLMN and the bottom face is the base of the cube.But KLMN is a quadrilateral, and the base of the cube is a square. Since they are not similar shapes, perhaps the prismatoid formula still applies. Wait, actually, the prismatoid formula applies to any two polygonal bases that are parallel and joined by triangles or trapezoids. Since our two bases are not parallel, the formula might not directly apply.Alternatively, use the general formula for the volume between two surfaces. But since the bottom surface is z=0 and the top surface is the plane z=(20 -5x -3y)/60, the volume can be computed as the double integral over the region in the xy-plane where z &gt;=0 and z &lt;= (20 -5x -3y)/60.But since we are within the cube (x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to 1), the volume under the plane is the integral over x=0 to 1, y=0 to 1, z=0 to min( (20 -5x -3y)/60 , 1 ). But since the plane cuts through the cube, we need to check where (20 -5x -3y)/60 is less than or equal to 1.Let me compute (20 -5x -3y)/60 &lt;=1Multiply both sides by 60: 20 -5x -3y &lt;=60Which simplifies to -5x -3y &lt;=40 → 5x +3y &gt;= -40. Which is always true since x and y are non-negative. Wait, but actually, in the cube, x and y are between 0 and1. So substituting x=0, y=0: 20/60 =1/3 &lt;=1. At x=1, y=1: (20 -5 -3)/60=(12)/60=0.2 &lt;=1. So the entire plane within the cube is below z=1. Therefore, the upper limit for z is (20 -5x -3y)/60. Therefore, the volume under the plane is the integral over x=0 to1, y=0 to1, z=0 to (20 -5x -3y)/60 of dz dy dx.Thus, the volume V is:∫ (x=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to1) [ (20 -5x -3y)/60 ] dy dxCompute this integral:First, integrate with respect to y:∫ (y=0 to1) [ (20 -5x -3y)/60 ] dy= (1/60) ∫ (20 -5x -3y) dy= (1/60) [20y -5x y - (3/2)y² ] evaluated from y=0 to1= (1/60)[20(1) -5x(1) - (3/2)(1)^2 -0]= (1/60)[20 -5x - 3/2]= (1/60)[ (40/2 -5x -3/2) ]= (1/60)[ (37/2 -5x) ]= (1/60)(37/2 -5x)Now, integrate with respect to x:∫ (x=0 to1) (1/60)(37/2 -5x) dx= (1/60) ∫ (37/2 -5x) dx= (1/60)[37/2 x - (5/2)x² ] from 0 to1= (1/60)[37/2(1) - (5/2)(1)^2 -0]= (1/60)(37/2 -5/2)= (1/60)(32/2)= (1/60)(16)= 16/60= 4/15So the volume under the plane is 4/15. Therefore, the volume above the plane is 1 - 4/15 = 11/15.Therefore, the ratio of the two parts is 4/15 :11/15, which simplifies to 4:11.But wait, let me check the integral again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.First, compute the inner integral:∫ (y=0 to1) (20 -5x -3y)/60 dy= (1/60) ∫ (20 -5x -3y) dyIntegrate term by term:∫ 20 dy = 20y∫ -5x dy = -5x y∫ -3y dy = - (3/2)y²So evaluated from 0 to1:[20(1) -5x(1) - (3/2)(1)^2] - [0 -0 -0] = 20 -5x - 3/2= 17.5 -5xWait, 20 -3/2 = 20 -1.5=18.5? Wait, 20 is 20, 20 -5x -3/2.Wait, 20 -3/2 is 20 -1.5=18.5. So 18.5 -5x.Wait, maybe I did a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-express:Original expression after integrating:= (1/60)[20y -5x y - (3/2)y² ] from 0 to1At y=1: 20*1 -5x*1 - (3/2)*1 = 20 -5x -1.5 = 18.5 -5xAt y=0: 0 -0 -0=0So difference is 18.5 -5xThus, the inner integral is (1/60)(18.5 -5x)Then integrate over x=0 to1:(1/60) ∫ (18.5 -5x) dx= (1/60)[18.5x - (5/2)x² ] from0 to1= (1/60)[18.5*1 - (5/2)*1 -0]= (1/60)(18.5 -2.5)= (1/60)(16)= 16/60=4/15Yes, same as before. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the volume under the plane is 4/15, and the volume above is 11/15. Therefore, the ratio is 4:11.But wait, the problem states that the cube is on the table, so the base is ABCD. The plane KLM (which is actually KLMN) cuts the cube into two parts. The volume below the plane (including the base) would be 4/15, and above would be 11/15. But the problem says &quot;the ratio of the volumes of the two parts&quot;. So depending on which part is considered, but usually, the ratio is presented as smaller:larger. Since 4/15 is smaller than 11/15, the ratio is 4:11.But let me double-check if the integral was set up correctly.The plane equation is 5x +3y +60z=20. Solving for z: z=(20 -5x -3y)/60.Within the cube, x and y go from 0 to1. So z=(20 -5x -3y)/60. We need to confirm that for all x,y in [0,1], z is between 0 and1.At x=0, y=0: z=20/60=1/3≈0.333At x=1, y=0: z=(20 -5)/60=15/60=0.25At x=0, y=1: z=(20 -3)/60=17/60≈0.283At x=1, y=1: z=(20 -5 -3)/60=12/60=0.2So all z-values are between 0.2 and1/3, which is below 1. So the entire plane within the cube is below z=1, hence the upper limit for z in the integral is indeed (20 -5x -3y)/60, and the volume under the plane is 4/15. Therefore, the ratio is 4:11.But let me check with an alternative method to confirm.Alternative method: Using the coordinates of the four intersection points K, L, M, N, we can model the solid under the plane as a polyhedron with vertices at A, B, C, D (the base) and K, L, M, N. Wait, but actually, the solid under the plane is bounded by the base ABCD and the quadrilateral KLMN. Wait, no, because the plane is cutting through the vertical edges, so the solid under the plane would have its top face as KLMN and its bottom face as ABCD. But since ABCD is the entire base, which is a square, but KLMN is a quadrilateral above it. Wait, but actually, the solid under the plane would include the region from z=0 up to the plane. So it&#39;s like a sloped surface connecting the four points K, L, M, N to the base. Hmm, perhaps decompose this into pyramids.Alternatively, consider the polyhedron formed by connecting the base ABCD to the quadrilateral KLMN. However, this isn&#39;t straightforward because the edges connecting the base to the top are not all vertical.Alternatively, use the shoelace formula for volume.Alternatively, use the following formula for the volume between two parallel planes, but here the base is not parallel.Wait, another idea: use the average of the heights at the four corners. But since the heights are different, maybe use the formula for the volume under a bilinear surface. But the plane is linear, not bilinear.Wait, the integral we did earlier is correct because we integrated the function z=(20 -5x -3y)/60 over the unit square in the xy-plane, which gives the volume under the plane within the cube. Therefore, 4/15 is correct.Therefore, the ratio is 4:11.But wait, let me check once more with another approach.Suppose we model the solid under the plane as a frustum-like shape, but since the top face is a quadrilateral and the bottom face is a square, it&#39;s a kind of truncated square pyramid. The volume of a frustum is (h/3)(A1 + A2 + sqrt(A1*A2)), but this formula applies to similar and parallel bases. Since our bases are not similar nor parallel, this formula doesn&#39;t apply.Alternatively, divide the solid into tetrahedrons.Let me try this. The polyhedron under the plane has vertices at A, B, C, D, K, L, M, N. Wait, but actually, the solid under the plane includes all points from z=0 up to the plane. But since the plane intersects the vertical edges at K, L, M, N, the solid under the plane can be thought of as the union of four pyramids, each with base on a face of the cube and apex at the intersection point.Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, decompose the polyhedron into tetrahedrons whose volumes can be summed.For example, consider the polyhedron under the plane as composed of the following tetrahedrons:1. Tetrahedron AKLN: with vertices A, K, L, N.2. Tetrahedron KBLM: Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, find a way to split the shape.Alternatively, use the convex hull of points A, B, C, D, K, L, M, N. But this seems complex.Alternatively, use the fact that the volume under the plane can be found by subtracting the volume above the plane from the total cube volume. But we already did that.Alternatively, use the method of determinants for the volume.Wait, another method: using the coordinates of the four points K, L, M, N, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron and extend it.But since the figure is a four-sided pyramid, perhaps split it into two tetrahedrons.But the base is ABCD and the top is KLMN. However, it&#39;s not a pyramid but a frustum-like shape.Alternatively, consider projecting the quadrilateral KLMN onto the base ABCD. The projection would cover the entire base, but how?Alternatively, use triple integration as we did before, which gave 4/15. Given that this is a standard method and the result is 4/15, which is less than 1/3, seems reasonable.Therefore, the answer should be 4:11.Wait, let me verify with a concrete example. If edge length is 1, volume is 1. If the volume under the plane is 4/15≈0.2667, and above is 11/15≈0.7333, ratio 4:11.Alternatively, cross-validate with mass properties. Given the plane equation, the centroid of the volume under the plane would be somewhere, but this might not help.Alternatively, take specific slices. For example, fix x and find the area in y-z plane.But maybe not necessary. Since the integral method is straightforward and we double-checked the calculations, it&#39;s likely correct.Thus, the ratio is 4:11.Final AnswerThe ratio of the volumes of the two parts is boxed{dfrac{4}{11}}.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{4}{11}}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the ratio of the volumes of the two parts created by the plane ( KLM ) cutting the cube ( ABCDEFGH ), we start by determining the coordinates of points ( K ), ( L ), and ( M ) on the vertical edges of the cube. Assuming the cube has edge length 1, the coordinates of the points are:- ( K ) on edge ( AE ) divides it in the ratio ( 1:2 ), so ( K ) is at ( (0, 0, frac{1}{3}) ).- ( L ) on edge ( BF ) divides it in the ratio ( 1:3 ), so ( L ) is at ( (1, 0, frac{1}{4}) ).- ( M ) on edge ( CG ) divides it in the ratio ( 1:4 ), so ( M ) is at ( (1, 1, frac{1}{5}) ).Next, we find the equation of the plane passing through points ( K ), ( L ), and ( M ). Using the cross product of vectors ( overrightarrow{KL} ) and ( overrightarrow{KM} ), we determine the normal vector of the plane. The plane equation derived is ( 5x + 3y + 60z = 20 ).We then calculate the volume under this plane within the cube by setting up and evaluating the triple integral. The integral is computed as follows:[text{Volume} = int_{0}^{1} int_{0}^{1} int_{0}^{frac{20 - 5x - 3y}{60}} dz , dy , dx]Evaluating the integral step-by-step, we find the volume under the plane to be ( frac{4}{15} ). The remaining volume above the plane is ( 1 - frac{4}{15} = frac{11}{15} ).Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two parts is ( frac{4}{15} : frac{11}{15} ), which simplifies to ( 4:11 ).The final answer is boxed{dfrac{4}{11}}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this cube problem. So, we have a cube labeled ABCDEFGH. The problem mentions three vertical edges being divided by points K, L, and M in the ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 respectively. The plane KLM cuts the cube into two parts, and we need to find the ratio of their volumes. Hmm, okay. Let&#39;s start by visualizing the cube and these points.First, let me recall that in a cube, all edges are equal. Let&#39;s assume the cube has side length 1 for simplicity. That way, all calculations will be easier, and ratios won&#39;t depend on the actual length. So, each edge is 1 unit long.Now, the problem mentions three vertical edges divided by points K, L, and M. Since it&#39;s a cube on the table, I assume the vertical edges are the ones perpendicular to the table, meaning the edges from the base to the top face. Let me confirm: in a cube, the edges can be divided into horizontal and vertical. The vertical edges would be those like AE, BF, CG, DH if the cube is sitting on the base ABCD with EFGH as the top face.Wait, the cube is labeled ABCDEFGH. Let me recall the standard labeling. Typically, in a cube, the vertices are labeled such that ABCD is the base (bottom face), EFGH is the top face, with A connected to E, B to F, etc. So, vertical edges are AE, BF, CG, DH.The problem says three vertical edges are divided by points K, L, M in ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. But which edges? The problem says &quot;three vertical edges,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t specify which ones. Hmm. The figure is probably needed, but since I don&#39;t have it, I need to make an assumption here. Maybe K, L, M are on three different vertical edges? Let&#39;s assume that.Let&#39;s suppose K divides edge AE in the ratio 1:2, L divides BF in 1:3, and M divides CG in 1:4. Wait, ratios can be from the bottom or the top. The problem says &quot;divided by points K, L, and M in the ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 respectively.&quot; So, for example, if it&#39;s 1:2, that would mean the segment from the bottom to K is 1 part, and from K to the top is 2 parts. So, if the total edge length is 1, then the length from the bottom to K is 1/(1+2) = 1/3, and from K to the top is 2/3. Similarly for the others.So, point K divides its vertical edge in the ratio 1:2 (from bottom to top), meaning it is 1/3 of the way up. Similarly, point L is 1/(1+3) = 1/4 of the way up its edge, and point M is 1/(1+4) = 1/5 of the way up its edge.But which edges are these? Since the cube is on the table, and the figure is probably showing the cube with points K, L, M on different vertical edges. Let&#39;s assume K is on edge AE, L on BF, M on CG. Alternatively, they could be on edges AE, BF, and DH, but since three vertical edges, maybe three adjacent ones? Maybe K, L, M are on edges AE, BF, CG, which are adjacent vertical edges.Alternatively, they might be on edges AE, BF, and DH. Hmm. But without the figure, it&#39;s a bit ambiguous. But given that the plane KLM cuts the cube into two parts, the position of these points will affect the shape of the cross-section. Maybe it&#39;s best to assign coordinates to the cube to model this.Let&#39;s assign coordinates to the cube. Let me set the cube in a 3D coordinate system with vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since it&#39;s a cube, we can define the other vertices as follows:- A: (0, 0, 0)- B: (1, 0, 0)- C: (1, 1, 0)- D: (0, 1, 0)- E: (0, 0, 1)- F: (1, 0, 1)- G: (1, 1, 1)- H: (0, 1, 1)So, vertical edges are AE (from (0,0,0) to (0,0,1)), BF (from (1,0,0) to (1,0,1)), CG (from (1,1,0) to (1,1,1)), DH (from (0,1,0) to (0,1,1)). So, if points K, L, M are on three different vertical edges, say AE, BF, CG. Let&#39;s confirm:If K is on AE with ratio 1:2 from the bottom, so from A to E, the point K is 1/3 from A. So coordinates of K would be (0,0,1/3). Similarly, L is on BF with ratio 1:3, so from B to F, L is 1/4 from B. So coordinates of L would be (1,0,1/4). M is on CG with ratio 1:4, so from C to G, M is 1/5 from C. So coordinates of M would be (1,1,1/5).Alternatively, if the ratios are from the top, but the problem says &quot;divided by points K, L, and M in the ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 respectively,&quot; which usually in such problems, the ratio is given from the bottom unless stated otherwise. But it&#39;s better to check. Let me re-read the problem: &quot;three vertical edges divided by points K, L, and M in the ratios 1: 2, 1: 3, and 1: 4 respectively.&quot; So, each edge is divided into parts with the given ratio. So, for edge AE, divided by K into 1:2, meaning the lower segment is 1 part and the upper segment is 2 parts. So, as above, K is 1/3 from the bottom.Similarly, L divides its edge into 1:3, so lower segment 1 part, upper 3 parts. So L is 1/4 from the bottom.M divides its edge into 1:4, so lower segment 1 part, upper 4 parts. So M is 1/5 from the bottom.Assuming that K, L, M are on edges AE, BF, CG respectively, then their coordinates are:- K: (0, 0, 1/3)- L: (1, 0, 1/4)- M: (1, 1, 1/5)Wait, but in the cube, edge CG goes from (1,1,0) to (1,1,1). So point M is 1/5 from the bottom, which is (1,1,1/5). Hmm. So these three points K, L, M are all on different vertical edges. Then, the plane KLM will cut through the cube. We need to find the volume ratio of the two parts created by this plane.To find the volume ratio, one approach is to find the equation of the plane KLM and then integrate the volume under the plane within the cube. However, integrating might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the volume of a pyramid or other geometric solids, but given that the cutting plane is not aligned with any axis, it might form a more complex polyhedron.Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of determinants or barycentric coordinates. Let me think.First, let&#39;s define the coordinates:- K: (0, 0, 1/3)- L: (1, 0, 1/4)- M: (1, 1, 1/5)We need to find the equation of the plane passing through these three points. Once we have the equation of the plane, we can determine which portion of the cube is above the plane and which is below, then compute their volumes.So, let&#39;s find the equation of the plane. The general equation of a plane is ax + by + cz = d. We can substitute the coordinates of K, L, M into this equation to find a, b, c, d.First, substitute K: (0,0,1/3) into ax + by + cz = d:0*a + 0*b + (1/3)c = d =&gt; (1/3)c = d =&gt; c = 3dSecond, substitute L: (1,0,1/4):a*1 + 0*b + (1/4)c = d =&gt; a + (1/4)c = dThird, substitute M: (1,1,1/5):a*1 + b*1 + (1/5)c = d =&gt; a + b + (1/5)c = dNow, since we have c = 3d from the first equation, substitute c into the other equations.Second equation: a + (1/4)(3d) = d =&gt; a + (3/4)d = d =&gt; a = d - (3/4)d = (1/4)dThird equation: a + b + (1/5)(3d) = d. Substitute a = (1/4)d:(1/4)d + b + (3/5)d = dCombine like terms:(1/4 + 3/5)d + b = dConvert to common denominator, 20:(5/20 + 12/20)d + b = d =&gt; (17/20)d + b = d =&gt; b = d - (17/20)d = (3/20)dThus, we have:a = (1/4)db = (3/20)dc = 3dSo, the plane equation becomes:(1/4)d x + (3/20)d y + 3d z = dWe can divide both sides by d (assuming d ≠ 0, which it isn&#39;t because otherwise the plane would be trivial):(1/4)x + (3/20)y + 3z = 1Multiply all terms by 20 to eliminate denominators:5x + 3y + 60z = 20So, the equation of the plane is 5x + 3y + 60z = 20.Wait, that seems a bit steep in the z-direction. Let me check the calculations again.Wait, substituting c = 3d into the second equation:a + (1/4)(3d) = d =&gt; a + (3/4)d = d =&gt; a = d - 3/4 d = 1/4 d. That&#39;s correct.Third equation:a + b + (1/5)c = d =&gt; (1/4 d) + b + (1/5)(3d) = d =&gt; (1/4 d) + b + (3/5 d) = d.Convert to 20 denominator:1/4 = 5/20, 3/5 = 12/20. So 5/20 d + 12/20 d + b = d =&gt; 17/20 d + b = d =&gt; b = 3/20 d. Correct.Thus, the plane equation is (1/4 d)x + (3/20 d)y + 3d z = d. Dividing both sides by d gives (1/4)x + (3/20)y + 3z = 1. Multiplying all terms by 20 gives 5x + 3y + 60z = 20. Hmmm. Let me verify this equation with the three points.First, point K: (0,0,1/3). Plug into 5x + 3y + 60z: 0 + 0 + 60*(1/3) = 20. Correct.Point L: (1,0,1/4). 5*1 + 0 + 60*(1/4) = 5 + 15 = 20. Correct.Point M: (1,1,1/5). 5*1 + 3*1 + 60*(1/5) = 5 + 3 + 12 = 20. Correct.Okay, so the plane equation is correct: 5x + 3y + 60z = 20. Alternatively, simplifying, we can divide all coefficients by a common factor if possible, but 5, 3, 60 have a common factor of 1, so that&#39;s simplest.Alternatively, we can write this as z = (20 - 5x - 3y)/60. That might be useful for integration.Now, the cube spans from x=0 to 1, y=0 to 1, z=0 to 1. The plane cuts through the cube. To find the volume under the plane (i.e., the part of the cube where 5x + 3y + 60z ≤ 20), and the volume above the plane (5x + 3y + 60z ≥ 20).But since z is multiplied by 60, which is a large coefficient, the plane is quite steep. Let&#39;s see where the plane intersects the cube.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s better to visualize the intersections of the plane with the edges of the cube. The plane passes through points K, L, M. Let me see if there are other intersection points with the cube edges.But since K, L, M are on three different vertical edges, and the plane passes through them, maybe it also intersects other edges of the cube. To compute the volume, we need to figure out the polyhedron formed by the plane and the cube. This might involve finding all intersection points of the plane with the cube edges, then decomposing the resulting shape into simpler solids whose volumes we can compute.So, first, let&#39;s list all the edges of the cube and check where the plane intersects them. The cube has 12 edges. We already know it intersects edges AE, BF, CG at points K, L, M respectively. Let&#39;s check the other edges.The edges are:1. AB: from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0)2. BC: from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0)3. CD: from (1,1,0) to (0,1,0)4. DA: from (0,1,0) to (0,0,0)5. AE: from (0,0,0) to (0,0,1) (intersected at K)6. BF: from (1,0,0) to (1,0,1) (intersected at L)7. CG: from (1,1,0) to (1,1,1) (intersected at M)8. DH: from (0,1,0) to (0,1,1)9. EF: from (0,0,1) to (1,0,1)10. FG: from (1,0,1) to (1,1,1)11. GH: from (1,1,1) to (0,1,1)12. HE: from (0,1,1) to (0,0,1)So, edges 5,6,7 are intersected at K, L, M. Let&#39;s check the other edges.Let&#39;s check edge DH (8): from (0,1,0) to (0,1,1). Parametrize this edge as (0,1,t), t from 0 to 1. Plug into plane equation: 5*0 + 3*1 + 60t = 20 =&gt; 3 + 60t = 20 =&gt; 60t = 17 =&gt; t = 17/60 ≈ 0.2833. Since t is between 0 and 1, this is a valid intersection point. So point N: (0,1,17/60).Similarly, check edge HE (12): from (0,1,1) to (0,0,1). Parametrize as (0, y, 1), y from 1 to 0. Plug into plane equation: 5*0 + 3y + 60*1 = 20 =&gt; 3y + 60 = 20 =&gt; 3y = -40, which is not possible since y is between 0 and 1. So no intersection on HE.Edge EF (9): from (0,0,1) to (1,0,1). Parametrize as (x, 0, 1), x from 0 to 1. Plane equation: 5x + 0 + 60*1 = 20 =&gt; 5x + 60 = 20 =&gt; 5x = -40 =&gt; x = -8. Not in [0,1]. No intersection.Edge FG (10): from (1,0,1) to (1,1,1). Parametrize as (1, y,1), y from 0 to 1. Plane equation: 5*1 + 3y + 60*1 = 5 + 3y + 60 = 65 + 3y = 20 =&gt; 3y = -45 =&gt; y = -15. Not in [0,1]. No intersection.Edge GH (11): from (1,1,1) to (0,1,1). Parametrize as (x,1,1), x from 1 to 0. Plane equation: 5x + 3*1 + 60*1 = 5x + 3 + 60 = 5x + 63 = 20 =&gt; 5x = -43 =&gt; x = -8.6. Not in [0,1]. No intersection.Edge AB (1): from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0). Parametrize as (x,0,0), x from 0 to1. Plane equation: 5x + 0 + 0 =20 =&gt; 5x=20 =&gt; x=4. Not in [0,1]. No intersection.Edge BC (2): from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0). Parametrize as (1,y,0), y from 0 to1. Plane equation: 5*1 + 3y + 0 =5 +3y=20 =&gt; 3y=15 =&gt; y=5. Not in [0,1]. No intersection.Edge CD (3): from (1,1,0) to (0,1,0). Parametrize as (x,1,0), x from1 to0. Plane equation:5x +3*1 +0=5x +3=20 =&gt;5x=17 =&gt;x=17/5=3.4. Not in [0,1]. No intersection.Edge DA (4): from (0,1,0) to (0,0,0). Parametrize as (0,y,0), y from1 to0. Plane equation:0 +3y +0=3y=20 =&gt; y≈6.666. Not in [0,1]. No intersection.Edge DH (8): already checked, intersection at (0,1,17/60).So, the plane intersects the cube at four points: K, L, M, and N=(0,1,17/60). Wait, four points? But three points define a plane, so if the plane intersects four edges of the cube, then there are four intersection points. Let me confirm:We have K on AE, L on BF, M on CG, N on DH. So four points in total. So the intersection of the plane with the cube is a quadrilateral KLMN.Wait, but in 3D, four points can form a quadrilateral, but need to check if they are coplanar, which they are since they lie on the given plane. So the intersection is a quadrilateral KLMN with vertices at K, L, M, N.Therefore, the plane cuts the cube into two parts: one part is a polyhedron with faces including the quadrilateral KLMN and parts of the cube&#39;s faces, and the other part is the remaining volume.To compute the volume of one part, say the lower part under the plane, we can consider the polyhedron formed by KLMN and the base of the cube. However, it&#39;s not straightforward because the shape might be complex.Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of dividing the cube into smaller regions and calculate the volume under the plane. Since the cube is unit volume (assuming side length 1), the volume ratio will be the same as the actual volume.But integrating over the cube might be a way. Let&#39;s attempt to set up an integral for the volume under the plane within the cube.The plane equation is 5x + 3y + 60z = 20, which can be rewritten as z = (20 -5x -3y)/60.So, for any x and y within the cube, the z-coordinate of the plane is (20 -5x -3y)/60. If this value is between 0 and 1, then the plane is within the cube; otherwise, it&#39;s outside. So, the volume under the plane is the integral over x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to 1, of z = max(0, min( (20 -5x -3y)/60, 1 )) dx dy.But first, let&#39;s find the region in the xy-plane where (20 -5x -3y)/60 is between 0 and 1.So, 0 ≤ (20 -5x -3y)/60 ≤1Multiply by 60:0 ≤20 -5x -3y ≤60First inequality: 20 -5x -3y ≥0 =&gt;5x +3y ≤20Second inequality:20 -5x -3y ≤60 =&gt; -5x -3y ≤40 =&gt;5x +3y ≥-40, which is always true since x and y are non-negative, so 5x +3y ≥0 ≥-40.Therefore, the condition is 5x +3y ≤20.But x and y are within [0,1]. So, the region in the xy-plane where 5x +3y ≤20.But wait, 5x +3y ≤20, but x and y are up to 1. So, 5*1 +3*1=8 ≤20. Therefore, 5x +3y is always ≤20 within the cube. So, (20 -5x -3y)/60 is always positive. However, we need to check when z exceeds 1.Set (20 -5x -3y)/60 ≤1:20 -5x -3y ≤60-5x -3y ≤40Which is always true since x and y are non-negative. Therefore, (20 -5x -3y)/60 ≤ (20)/60 = 1/3, since x and y are ≥0. Wait, hold on:Wait, when x and y are 0, z=(20)/60=1/3. When x and y increase, z decreases. So actually, the maximum z is 1/3 (at (0,0,1/3) which is point K), and the minimum z in the plane within the cube is when x and y are maximum. Wait, let&#39;s compute at (1,1, z): z=(20 -5*1 -3*1)/60=(20 -8)/60=12/60=1/5. Which is point M. So, the plane slopes from K (0,0,1/3) down to L (1,0,1/4) and M (1,1,1/5), and also to N (0,1,17/60). Wait, point N is at (0,1,17/60) which is z≈0.2833, which is less than 1/3≈0.3333. So the plane is highest at K and slopes downward towards L, M, and N.But in any case, since z=(20 -5x -3y)/60 is always between 1/5 and 1/3 within the cube. Therefore, the entire plane within the cube is below z=1/3 and above z=1/5. Therefore, the volume under the plane is the integral of z from 0 to (20 -5x -3y)/60 over the entire x and y from 0 to1.But wait, but in reality, since the plane intersects the cube not only on the vertical edges but also on edge DH at point N, which is (0,1,17/60), that complicates the integration region. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that 5x +3y ≤20 is always true for x, y in [0,1], so z is positive, but the plane does not intersect the top face (z=1) of the cube. Therefore, the intersection of the plane with the cube is only on the four vertical edges: AE, BF, CG, DH, and nowhere else. Wait, but when we checked edge DH, there was an intersection at N=(0,1,17/60), but the plane equation when x=0, y=1, gives z=(20 -0 -3)/60=17/60≈0.2833. So, the plane intersects edge DH at N=(0,1,17/60).Therefore, the intersection polygon is a quadrilateral KLMN. So, the volume under the plane would be a four-sided pyramid or a more complex shape. However, integrating might still be feasible.Alternatively, maybe we can decompose the volume under the plane into simpler parts. Let&#39;s consider the shape under the plane. The intersection points are K, L, M, N. The volume under the plane is bounded by the quadrilateral KLMN and the base of the cube. However, since the plane is slanting, it&#39;s a kind of frustum or a truncated pyramid.Alternatively, we can use the divergence theorem or other methods, but perhaps the simplest is to set up a triple integral.Given that z ranges from 0 to (20 -5x -3y)/60, but since (20 -5x -3y)/60 is always less than 1/3, as we saw. Therefore, the volume under the plane is:V = ∫ (x=0 to 1) ∫ (y=0 to 1) ∫ (z=0 to (20 -5x -3y)/60) dz dy dxCompute the inner integral first:∫ dz from 0 to (20 -5x -3y)/60 is just (20 -5x -3y)/60.Therefore, V = ∫ (x=0 to 1) ∫ (y=0 to 1) (20 -5x -3y)/60 dy dxFactor out 1/60:V = (1/60) ∫ (x=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to1) (20 -5x -3y) dy dxCompute the inner integral over y:∫ (y=0 to1) (20 -5x -3y) dy = ∫ (20 -5x) dy - 3 ∫ y dy= (20 -5x)(1 -0) - 3*(1²/2 -0) = (20 -5x) - 3/2 = 20 -5x -1.5 = 18.5 -5xTherefore, V = (1/60) ∫ (x=0 to1) (18.5 -5x) dxCompute this integral:∫ (18.5 -5x) dx = 18.5x - (5/2)x² evaluated from 0 to1= 18.5(1) - (5/2)(1) - [0 -0] = 18.5 -2.5 =16Therefore, V = (1/60)(16) = 16/60 = 4/15 ≈0.2667Since the total volume of the cube is 1, the volume under the plane is 4/15, and the volume above is 1 -4/15=11/15. Therefore, the ratio of the two parts is 4/15 :11/15, which simplifies to 4:11.Wait, but hold on. This result seems straightforward, but is it correct?Wait, the integral computation gave us 4/15 for the volume under the plane. But let&#39;s verify this. The calculation steps:1. Inner integral over z: correct, gives (20 -5x -3y)/60.2. Then integrating over y: ∫ (20 -5x -3y) dy from 0 to1.That&#39;s equal to (20 -5x)y - (3/2)y² evaluated from 0 to1.Which is (20 -5x)(1) - (3/2)(1) -0 =20 -5x -1.5=18.5 -5x. Correct.Then integrating over x: ∫(18.5 -5x)dx from 0 to1.=18.5x - (5/2)x² from 0 to1.=18.5(1) -2.5(1) =16. Then multiply by 1/60: 16/60=4/15. Correct.Therefore, the volume under the plane is 4/15, and above is 11/15. Hence, the ratio is 4:11.But wait, but in the cube, the plane intersects four vertical edges: K, L, M, and N. So, the shape under the plane is a quadrilateral pyramid with base KLMN and apex at... Wait, no, the base would actually be on the bottom face? Wait, no. Wait, the volume under the plane is bounded by the plane and the base of the cube. Wait, but if the plane is cutting through four vertical edges, the volume under the plane would be a sort of prism with base KLMN and height going down to the base of the cube. Wait, but how?Alternatively, perhaps not. Since the plane is inclined, the volume under the plane is like a slanted prism. But the integration approach is more reliable here.But according to the integration, the volume under the plane is 4/15. Therefore, the ratio is 4:11. But let&#39;s check with another approach to be sure.Alternatively, use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron. However, the shape under the plane is not a tetrahedron but a more complex polyhedron. However, perhaps we can decompose it into tetrahedrons.Alternatively, use the scalar triple product. But since the shape is not a simple tetrahedron, this might be complicated.Alternatively, use coordinates. The volume under the plane is bounded by the quadrilateral KLMN and the base ABCD. To compute this volume, we can divide it into pyramids or other solids.But given that KLMN is a quadrilateral, perhaps we can split it into two triangles. For instance, split KLMN into triangles KLM and KLN. Wait, but need to check if they are coplanar, but since they are on the plane, this division is valid.But even then, calculating the volume of each tetrahedron might be complex.Alternatively, use the shoelace formula in 3D, but I don&#39;t recall such a formula. Alternatively, use the convex hull method.Alternatively, coordinates:The four points K, L, M, N are:- K: (0, 0, 1/3)- L: (1, 0, 1/4)- M: (1, 1, 1/5)- N: (0, 1, 17/60)The volume under the plane is the region bounded by these four points and the base of the cube.Alternatively, think of this as a frustum-like shape, but with a quadrilateral base. Alternatively, consider projecting this shape onto the base and integrating.But the integration method seems solid here. Since the integration over the entire cube gave 4/15 under the plane, which is less than 1/3, and the cube&#39;s total volume is 1, so 4/15≈0.2667 and 11/15≈0.7333. The ratio 4:11 is approximately 0.2667:0.7333.But let me cross-verify with a different approach.Suppose we consider the plane cutting the cube, creating a lower part with volume 4/15. Let&#39;s imagine if that makes sense. The plane passes through points K, L, M, N. Point K is 1/3 up edge AE, L is 1/4 up BF, M is 1/5 up CG, and N is 17/60 up DH. Since these points are all in the lower half of the cube, the volume under the plane should be less than half the cube. 4/15 is approximately 26.67%, which seems reasonable.Alternatively, we can use mass point geometry or other proportional reasoning, but given the plane is not axis-aligned, this might be tricky.Alternatively, consider that the equation of the plane is 5x +3y +60z =20. Let&#39;s check the intercepts.x-intercept: set y=0,z=0:5x=20 =&gt;x=4. But the cube only goes up to x=1. Similarly, y-intercept:3y=20 =&gt;y≈6.666, which is outside the cube. z-intercept:60z=20 =&gt;z=1/3. So, the plane intersects the z-axis at z=1/3 (which is point K), and the other intercepts are outside the cube.Therefore, within the cube, the plane only intersects the four vertical edges as previously found. Therefore, the volume under the plane is indeed given by the integral, which is 4/15.Therefore, the ratio of the two parts is 4:11.Final AnswerThe ratio of the volumes of the two parts is boxed{dfrac{4}{11}}.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{4}{11}}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the ratio of the volumes of the two parts created by the plane ( KLM ) cutting through the cube ( ABCDEFGH ), we start by assigning coordinates to the cube with vertices ( A(0,0,0) ), ( B(1,0,0) ), ( C(1,1,0) ), ( D(0,1,0) ), ( E(0,0,1) ), ( F(1,0,1) ), ( G(1,1,1) ), and ( H(0,1,1) ). Points ( K ), ( L ), and ( M ) divide the vertical edges ( AE ), ( BF ), and ( CG ) in the ratios ( 1:2 ), ( 1:3 ), and ( 1:4 ) respectively. Their coordinates are:- ( K(0, 0, frac{1}{3}) )- ( L(1, 0, frac{1}{4}) )- ( M(1, 1, frac{1}{5}) )We find the equation of the plane passing through these points. The general form of the plane equation ( ax + by + cz = d ) is determined by substituting the coordinates of ( K ), ( L ), and ( M ). Solving the system of equations, we find the plane equation to be ( 5x + 3y + 60z = 20 ).Next, we calculate the volume under this plane within the cube by setting up the integral:[V = int_{0}^{1} int_{0}^{1} int_{0}^{frac{20 - 5x - 3y}{60}} dz , dy , dx]Evaluating the inner integral first:[int_{0}^{frac{20 - 5x - 3y}{60}} dz = frac{20 - 5x - 3y}{60}]Then, integrating over ( y ):[int_{0}^{1} frac{20 - 5x - 3y}{60} , dy = frac{1}{60} left( 18.5 - 5x right)]Finally, integrating over ( x ):[int_{0}^{1} frac{18.5 - 5x}{60} , dx = frac{1}{60} left( 16 right) = frac{4}{15}]The volume under the plane is ( frac{4}{15} ) and the remaining volume is ( 1 - frac{4}{15} = frac{11}{15} ). The ratio of the volumes is ( frac{4}{15} : frac{11}{15} ), which simplifies to ( 4 : 11 ).Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two parts is (boxed{dfrac{4}{11}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-74091e3a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-74091e3a><span class="icon" data-v-74091e3a>🔑:</span>Solution. We can assume that the length of the edges of the cube is 1. Then A K=1 / 3, B L=1 / 4 and C M=1 / 5. Let N be the intersection point of the edge D H and the plane K L M, mathcal{S} the plane passing through M, and mathcal{T} the horizontal plane passing through K.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c7bcc98c05b0333993edg-1.jpg?height=583&amp;width=553&amp;top_left_y=305&amp;top_left_x=775)Then mathcal{S} cuts a right prism mathcal{H}_{1} with base A B C D from the cube, whose height is C M, so its volume is V_{1}=1 / 5. The plane mathcal{T} cuts a right prism mathcal{H}_{2} with base E F G H from the cube, whose height is E K=A E-A K, so its volume is V_{2}=2 / 3. The part of the cube between the planes mathcal{S} and mathcal{T} is also a right prism, denoted by mathcal{H}_{3}. Its volume isV_{3}=1-left(V_{1}+V_{2}right)=1-left(frac{1}{5}+frac{2}{3}right)=frac{2}{15}We will show that the plane K L M N bisects the volume of mathcal{H}_{3}. The lines K L and M N are coplanar, but since they lie on two parallel faces of the cube, one on A B F E and the other on D C G H, they cannot intersect. Therefore, the two lines are parallel. Similarly, we can show that the lines L M and K N are also parallel. Thus, the quadrilateral K L M N is a parallelogram because its opposite sides are parallel. Then, however, its diagonals bisect each other. Let the intersection point of the diagonals of K L M N be P. Then P is also the midpoint of the body diagonal K M of the right prism mathcal{H}_{3}, which is the center of symmetry of the prism, because the midpoints of the four body diagonals of the prism coincide. The central reflection about P therefore maps mathcal{H}_{3} onto itself, swapping the point pairs (K, M) and (L, N). Thus, it swaps the parts of mathcal{H}_{3} below and above the plane K L M N. Therefore, the two parts are congruent, and thus each part has a volume of frac{V_{3}}{2}=frac{1}{15}.The volume of the part of the cube below the plane K L M N is thereforeV_{1}+frac{V_{3}}{2}=frac{1}{5}+frac{1}{15}=frac{4}{15}and the volume of the part above the plane K L M N isV_{2}+frac{V_{3}}{2}=frac{2}{3}+frac{1}{15}=frac{11}{15}Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two parts is 4: 11.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-bf57a192><span data-v-bf57a192>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
