The problem is about probability when drawing four balls from a box. There are 36 balls total, 4 of which are white. The given probability expression is (C₁₃₂ * C³₄ + C²₄) / C⁴₃₆. I need to figure out which event this probability corresponds to, with the options being A to D.First, let me parse the probability expression. The numerator is (C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2)) and the denominator is C(36,4). The denominator makes sense because that&#39;s the total number of ways to choose 4 balls from 36. The numerator is a combination of two terms: one involving choosing 1 from 32 and 3 from 4, and the other involving choosing 2 from 4. Wait, let&#39;s break this down. C(32,1) would be choosing 1 item from 32, and C(4,3) is choosing 3 from 4. Then the second term is C(4,2). So maybe these are combinations of different events?Let me think. The box has 4 white balls and the rest are red, right? Since there are 36 total and 4 white, so 32 red balls. So events related to white and red balls.The options are about red balls or white balls. Let&#39;s see:A: No red balls. That would mean all four balls are white. But there are only 4 white balls, so the number of ways would be C(4,4) = 1. But in the numerator, we have C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). That doesn&#39;t seem to match. So A is probably not the answer.B: At most one red ball. Hmm. &quot;At most one red&quot; would mean either 0 red or 1 red. Since the total is 4 balls, so 0 red means 4 white, and 1 red means 3 white. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s what the numerator represents.C(32,1)*C(4,3) would be choosing 1 red and 3 white. Then C(4,2)... Wait, C(4,2) is choosing 2 white? But if we&#39;re talking about &quot;at most one red,&quot; then the second term should be 0 red, which is C(4,4). But in the numerator, the second term is C(4,2). That doesn&#39;t align. So maybe B isn&#39;t the answer either.C: At least one white ball. The complement of this event is &quot;no white balls,&quot; which would be all red balls. The probability would be 1 - C(32,4)/C(36,4). But the given probability isn&#39;t in that form. So maybe not C.D: At least one red ball. Similarly, the complement is &quot;no red balls&quot; which is all white balls. So probability would be 1 - C(4,4)/C(36,4). But the given numerator is adding two terms, which doesn&#39;t look like 1 minus something. So perhaps not D.Wait, maybe I need to reconsider. Let&#39;s analyze the numerator again. The first term is C(32,1)*C(4,3). That&#39;s 1 red and 3 white. The second term is C(4,2). Wait, but C(4,2) is choosing 2 from 4. If those 4 are white, then that&#39;s 2 white. But how does that relate to red? If it&#39;s 2 white and 2 red? But then why is it not multiplied by C(32,2)?Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about red and white. Wait, but the problem states there are 4 white balls, so the rest must be red. Let&#39;s confirm: 36 total, 4 white, so 32 red. So the events are about red or white.Wait, let&#39;s think of the numerator: C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). Let&#39;s compute each part.First term: C(32,1) is 32, and C(4,3) is 4. So 32*4 = 128. Second term: C(4,2) is 6. So total numerator is 128 + 6 = 134. The denominator is C(36,4), which is a big number. But the key is interpreting what 134 represents.If the first term is 32*4 = 128, that&#39;s the number of ways to choose 1 red and 3 white. Then the second term is 6, which is the number of ways to choose 2 white. Wait, but how does 2 white balls fit into the event? If we are choosing 4 balls, then 2 white would require 2 red, right? But C(4,2) alone is only the white part. So maybe the second term is actually C(4,2)*C(32,2). But that&#39;s not in the numerator.Wait, this is confusing. The given numerator is C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). So either there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe the second term is actually C(4,2)*C(32,2), but it&#39;s written incorrectly. Let me check.Wait, the original problem says: &quot;the probability of drawing four balls and having the event with probability (C₁₃₂ * C³₄ + C²₄) / C³⁶₄&quot;. So it&#39;s written as C_{32}^1 C_4^3 + C_4^2. So that is indeed (32 choose 1)(4 choose 3) + (4 choose 2). So the problem statement is correct.Hmm. Let&#39;s consider possible events.First term: 1 red, 3 white. Second term: 2 white. Wait, but if the event is 3 white or 2 white? But how does that relate to an event description. Wait, 3 white would require 1 red, and 2 white would require 2 red? But if the second term is just (4 choose 2), that&#39;s only the number of ways to choose 2 white, not considering the red. So maybe the problem is different.Alternatively, perhaps the event is &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white&quot;. But in that case, the number of ways would be (C(4,3)*C(32,1) + C(4,2)*C(32,2)). But in the given numerator, the second term is only C(4,2). So that&#39;s not matching. So perhaps the problem has a typo? Or maybe the event is something else.Wait, maybe the problem is not about white and red, but something else. Wait, the problem mentions 4 white balls, so the rest are non-white, which are red. So the total is 32 red and 4 white.Wait, another approach: Let&#39;s compute the given probability&#39;s numerator:C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2) = 32 * 4 + 6 = 128 + 6 = 134.Denominator: C(36,4) = (36*35*34*33)/(4*3*2*1) = let&#39;s see, 36/4=9, 35 stays, 34/3≈11.333, 33/2=16.5. Wait, maybe I don&#39;t need to compute the exact value. The key is to understand what 134 represents.If the event is &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white&quot;, then the number of ways would be C(4,3)*C(32,1) + C(4,2)*C(32,2). But in the numerator, the second term is missing C(32,2). So maybe the problem is actually about &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white and something else&quot;?Wait, but that doesn&#39;t make sense. Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white without considering the red ones&quot;. But that&#39;s not possible because when you draw 4 balls, the rest have to be red.Wait, maybe the problem is not about the number of white or red balls, but something else. Wait, let&#39;s look at the options again.Options:A: No red balls. That&#39;s all white, which is C(4,4) =1. Doesn&#39;t match numerator.B: At most one red ball. So 0 red or 1 red. So 4 white or 3 white and 1 red. Which is C(4,4) + C(4,3)*C(32,1) =1 + 32*4=1 +128=129. But the numerator is 134. Not matching. So B is not.C: At least one white ball. Which is 1 - probability(all red). All red is C(32,4). So 1 - C(32,4)/C(36,4). That doesn&#39;t match the given expression.D: At least one red ball. Which is 1 - probability(all white). All white is C(4,4)/C(36,4). So 1 - 1/C(36,4). Doesn&#39;t match given.Hmm. So none of the options seem to directly match. Wait, but maybe the numerator is miscalculated. Let&#39;s check again.Wait, if the problem is about &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 red&quot;, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten. Let me check the original problem again.&quot;A box contains 36 balls of the same size, including 4 white balls. The probability of drawing four balls and having the event with probability (C₁₃₂C₄³ + C₄²)/C₃₆⁴ is (    ) A: No red balls B: At most one red ball C: At least one white ball D: At least one red ball&quot;Wait, the numerator is C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). So 32 choose 1 times 4 choose 3 plus 4 choose 2.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a different way to parse this. If the event is &quot;either exactly 3 white balls and 1 red, or exactly 2 white balls&quot;, but then the second term should be C(4,2)*C(32,2), but it&#39;s not. So the second term is only choosing 2 white balls without considering the red ones, which is impossible because you need to choose 4 balls total.Wait a minute, if you choose 4 balls, and if you have 2 white balls, the remaining 2 must be red. So the correct term would be C(4,2)*C(32,2). But in the numerator, it&#39;s only C(4,2). That&#39;s missing the C(32,2). So unless there&#39;s a mistake, maybe the problem has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the event is not about color but something else.Wait, the problem says &quot;having the event with probability (expression)&quot;. The event is described in the options. Maybe the event is &quot;exactly three white or exactly two white&quot;, but that would be the same as &quot;at least two white&quot;, but the way the numerator is written is incomplete. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to two different scenarios combined, but why would they not include the red counterparts?Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;either exactly three white balls and one non-white (red), or exactly two white balls and two non-white (red)&quot; but then in that case, the second term should be C(4,2)*C(32,2). But the problem says only C(4,2). So that&#39;s inconsistent.Wait, unless the second term is not about two white and two red, but something else. Wait, maybe the problem is not about color, but about some other attribute? Wait, no, the problem mentions 4 white balls and the rest are red. So it must be about white and red.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Maybe the event is &quot;either exactly 3 white balls or exactly 2 white balls, but when exactly 2 white balls, there&#39;s an additional condition&quot;. For example, maybe some specific arrangement or something else. But the problem doesn&#39;t mention any other conditions.Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and the second term is supposed to be C(4,2)*C(32,2). If that&#39;s the case, then the numerator would be 32*4 + 4C2*32C2 = 128 + 6*496= 128 + 2976= 3104. Then the probability would be 3104 / C(36,4). But that still doesn&#39;t match any of the given options.Alternatively, if the problem is written correctly, but we need to interpret the event as something else.Wait, let&#39;s check the options again. The options are about red balls. Let&#39;s see:A: No red balls. That&#39;s all white, which is C(4,4)=1.B: At most one red ball. Which is 0 red or 1 red. So 4 white or 3 white, 1 red. That is C(4,4) + C(4,3)*C(32,1) =1 + 128=129.C: At least one white ball. Which is all possibilities except all red. So total - all red. C(36,4) - C(32,4).D: At least one red ball. Which is all possibilities except all white. C(36,4) -1.But the given probability is (128 +6)/C(36,4)=134/C(36,4). So 134. Comparing with the options:A: 1B:129C: C(36,4) - C(32,4)D: C(36,4) -1So 134 is closest to B&#39;s 129, but not exactly. Wait, but maybe I miscalculated. Wait, B is &quot;at most one red&quot;, which would be 0 red (all white) +1 red (3 white, 1 red). So that is 1 + (C(4,3)*C(32,1)) =1 + 4*32=1+128=129. But the given numerator is 128 +6=134. Hmm. 134 vs 129. There&#39;s a discrepancy here.So the given probability is 134/C(36,4), which is more than the probability for B. So unless the problem is written incorrectly, perhaps the answer isn&#39;t B. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation in the problem.Wait, let&#39;s check the terms again. C(32,1)*C(4,3)=32*4=128. C(4,2)=6. So total 134. So the probability is 134/C(36,4). What&#39;s 134? It&#39;s the number of ways to have 1 red and 3 white, plus 2 white. Wait, but 2 white and how many red? If we have 4 balls total, 2 white would mean 2 red. So the term should be C(4,2)*C(32,2). But the problem has C(4,2) only. So the problem&#39;s expression is missing the C(32,2) part. So unless that&#39;s a typo, the answer is not among the options. But since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are given, maybe I need to see which one is closest or if there&#39;s a different interpretation.Wait, maybe the problem is not about the number of white or red balls, but about arranging the balls in some way. Wait, but the options are about counts: no red, at most one red, at least one white, at least one red.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Let&#39;s think: the numerator has two terms. The first term is 1 red and 3 white. The second term is 2 white. Wait, but 2 white in total? If you have 4 balls, 2 white and 2 red? But then that would require C(4,2)*C(32,2). But here it&#39;s just C(4,2). So maybe the problem is about sequences rather than combinations? But the denominator is combinations.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s considering different cases where order matters, but the denominator is combinations, so order doesn&#39;t matter. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;either exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white, but the red balls are special&quot;. For example, if after drawing the 4 balls, there&#39;s an event where you have 3 white and 1 specific red, or 2 white. But that seems too vague.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering &quot;at least three white or exactly two white&quot;. So that would be C(4,3)*C(32,1) + C(4,2). But how does that relate to the options?The options are about red balls. Let&#39;s see:If the event is &quot;at least three white or exactly two white&quot;, how does that translate in terms of red balls? At least three white would mean 3 or 4 white. 3 white corresponds to 1 red, 4 white is 0 red. Exactly two white is 2 red. So combining these, the number of red balls would be 0,1, or 2. So &quot;at most two red balls&quot;. But there is no such option. The options are A: No red, B: At most one red, C: At least one white, D: At least one red.Alternatively, if the event is &quot;at least three white&quot; plus &quot;exactly two white&quot;, then the total red balls would be 0,1,2. But the options don&#39;t include &quot;at most two red&quot;. So maybe this is not the correct approach.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misprint, and the second term should be C(4,2)*C(32,2). If that&#39;s the case, then the numerator would be 32*4 + 4C2*32C2 =128 + 6*496=128 + 2976=3104. Then the probability would be 3104/C(36,4). Let&#39;s compute C(36,4):C(36,4) = (36×35×34×33)/(4×3×2×1) = (36×35×34×33)/24. Let&#39;s compute:36/4=9, 35 stays, 34 stays, 33/3=11. So 9×35×34×11.35×11=385, 34×9=306. Then 385×306. Let&#39;s compute:385×300=115,500385×6=2,310Total: 115,500 +2,310=117,810So C(36,4)=117,810.Then the probability would be 3104 /117,810 ≈0.02636, which is roughly 2.6%. But if we check the given numerator is 134, then 134/117,810≈0.001137, which is about 0.11%. That seems very low. So maybe not.Alternatively, if the problem is as written, with numerator 134, then 134/117,810≈0.001137, which is about 0.11%, which is even smaller than the probability of all white (which is 1/117810≈0.00000847). Wait, that can&#39;t be. Because 134 is larger than 1. Wait, no: 134 is the numerator. The all-white case is 1, so the probability here is 134 times higher than all-white. So 0.11% vs 0.0008%. But the options are about more common events. For example, &quot;at least one white&quot; would be 1 - C(32,4)/C(36,4). Let&#39;s compute C(32,4):C(32,4)= (32×31×30×29)/24= (32×31×30×29)/24. Let&#39;s compute:32/4=8, 31 stays, 30/3=10, 29 stays. So 8×31×10×29=8×31=248; 248×10=2480; 2480×29=71,920.So C(32,4)=71,920. Then the probability of all red is 71,920 /117,810≈0.610. Therefore, the probability of at least one white is 1 -0.610≈0.390, which is 39%. That&#39;s a reasonable probability. But the given expression is 134/117810≈0.0011, which is 0.11%, which is too small. So maybe this indicates that the given numerator is incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the original problem uses permutations instead of combinations, but the notation is C(n,k), which is combinations. So this is confusing.Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a translated source, and there was a mistranslation in the expression. But given the current information, we need to work with what&#39;s given.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the problem differently. The given probability is [C(32,1)C(4,3) + C(4,2)] / C(36,4). Suppose we parse this as two separate cases:Case 1: Choose 1 from 32 and 3 from 4. So 1 red, 3 white.Case 2: Choose 2 from 4. So 2 white, but how many red? Since we need 4 balls total, 2 white implies 2 red. But in the expression, it&#39;s only C(4,2), which is 6. But to get 2 white and 2 red, it should be C(4,2)*C(32,2)=6*496=2976. But in the numerator, it&#39;s just 6. So unless the problem is referring to something else.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the case where exactly 3 white balls are drawn, and then one specific red ball, plus the case where exactly 2 white balls are drawn. But why would they not consider the red balls in the second case?Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about red and white but about something else. Wait, the problem says &quot;including 4 white balls&quot;. So the rest are non-white, which could be red. So the total is 4 white and 32 red. So the only colors are white and red.Given that, the event described by the probability must relate to white and red counts.But the numerator is (32*4 +6)=134. So the probability is 134 / C(36,4).What event would have 134 favorable outcomes?If it&#39;s 1 red and 3 white plus 2 white and 0 red, but 2 white and 0 red would mean 2 white and 2 more white, which is 4 white. But there are only 4 white. Wait, no. If you draw 2 white, then you have to draw 2 more balls, which must be red. So 2 white and 2 red.But the term C(4,2) is only accounting for choosing 2 white, not the 2 red. So perhaps the problem has a typo and the second term is C(4,2)*C(32,2). But given that, the answer would be the event &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white&quot;, which is &quot;at least 2 white&quot;. But none of the options mention that. The options are about red balls.Alternatively, if the problem&#39;s event is actually about something like &quot;the number of red balls is 1 or the number of white balls is 2&quot;. But how does that relate to the options? The options are:A: No red ballsB: At most one red ballC: At least one white ballD: At least one red ballSo if the event is &quot;exactly 1 red or exactly 2 white&quot;, which translates to red=1 or white=2. How does that relate to the options? Let&#39;s see:- &quot;Exactly 1 red&quot; is included in B (at most one red). &quot;Exactly 2 white&quot; implies 2 red, which is not included in B. So the total event would be red=1 or red=2. But B is red ≤1. So this doesn&#39;t match.Alternatively, if the event is &quot;exactly 1 red or exactly 2 red&quot;, but the given numerator doesn&#39;t account for that.Alternatively, maybe the problem is combining two different events. For example, if you draw 4 balls, the probability that you have exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white. But again, the second term is missing the red component.Wait, this is very confusing. Maybe the answer is B: At most one red ball, and the given expression has a typo. Because if it&#39;s C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,4), then that would be 128 +1=129, which matches option B. But the given expression is C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). Maybe the original problem had a superscript typo, where C_4^2 was supposed to be C_4^4. In that case, the answer would be B. Since this is a multiple-choice question, and the closest is B, but the given numerator is 134 instead of 129. Alternatively, the problem is correct, and we need to interpret it differently.Wait, another angle. Maybe the event is &quot;either exactly three white balls or a pair of white balls&quot;. But a pair is two, so that would be 2 white and 2 red. But why is the second term only C(4,2)? Unless it&#39;s considering unordered pairs? But even so, the number of ways to have 2 white and 2 red is C(4,2)*C(32,2). So unless the problem is only counting the number of ways to choose the white balls and disregarding the red, which doesn&#39;t make sense.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability of selecting either 3 white balls and 1 specific red ball, or selecting 2 white balls. But that specific red ball isn&#39;t defined, so that seems unlikely.Alternatively, if we consider that the second term is C(4,2) because it&#39;s considering only the white balls selected without replacement, but in the context of four balls, then if you choose 2 white, you have to choose 2 red. But since the term is only C(4,2), perhaps the problem is incorrectly formulated.Given that, perhaps the intended answer is B: At most one red ball, with the idea that the first term is 1 red (so at most one red) and the second term is... hmm, but the second term would be 2 white, which requires 2 red, which contradicts &quot;at most one red&quot;. So this can&#39;t be.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. The given expression could be rewritten. Let&#39;s see:The numerator is C(32,1)C(4,3) + C(4,2) = 32*4 +6= 128+6=134.Alternatively, factor something out? Not sure.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a different kind of event. For example, if after drawing four balls, you have either three white and one red, or two white. But two white what? If it&#39;s two white balls, then you need two red. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the reds. It&#39;s unclear.Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering two separate events where order matters, but the probability is calculated using combinations. For example, the event is drawing a red ball on the first draw and three white balls subsequently, plus drawing two white balls in the first two draws. But even then, the probability would need to consider permutations, not combinations.Alternatively, the problem might have mixed up the indices. For example, C_{32}^1 C_4^3 could be read as 32 choose 1 and 4 choose 3, which is 1 red and 3 white, which is 32*4=128. Then C_4^2 is 4 choose 2=6. So maybe the problem is considering the event &quot;either 1 red and 3 white or 2 white and 2 something else&quot;. But again, the 2 white would need 2 red.But since the problem is multiple choice, and given that the numerator is 134, which is 128+6, and the only option that includes 1 red or more is... Well, let&#39;s think:If we have 1 red and 3 white, that&#39;s one scenario. Then 2 white and 2 something. But 2 white and 2 what? If it&#39;s 2 white and 2 non-white (i.e., red), then why is it not multiplied by C(32,2)? It seems like a mistake. But assuming that the problem intended that, then the event would be &quot;either 1 red and 3 white or 2 white and 2 red&quot;. But what is that event in terms of the options given?Looking at the options:A: No red balls - all white.B: At most one red ball - 0 or 1 red.C: At least one white ball - all except all red.D: At least one red ball - all except all white.The event &quot;1 red and 3 white or 2 white and 2 red&quot; is the same as &quot;exactly 1 red or exactly 2 red&quot;. But none of the options mention exactly 1 or 2 red. However, the complement of this event would be 0 red (all white) or 3 or 4 red. But that&#39;s not directly related to the options.Alternatively, if you consider &quot;at least one white ball&quot;, that includes all cases except all red. The given probability includes some cases with white balls but not all. Specifically, it includes 3 white and 1 red, or 2 white and 2 red. So the probability given is part of &quot;at least one white&quot;, but not the entire probability. Therefore, it&#39;s not option C.Alternatively, since the given probability includes cases with different numbers of red balls (1 and 2), which are both cases where there is at least one red ball. So if you have 1 or 2 red balls, then you have at least one red ball. So the event would be a subset of &quot;at least one red ball&quot;. But the entire &quot;at least one red ball&quot; includes all cases except all white. The given probability is just two specific cases. So it&#39;s not matching D either.This is perplexing. Given the options, and the numerator being 134, which is 128 (1 red, 3 white) +6 (something). Since 128 is part of option B (at most one red ball), which is 128 +1=129. The 6 is unexplained. If the problem had a typo and the second term is C(4,4)=1, then it would match option B. Alternatively, if there&#39;s a different interpretation.Wait, another possible interpretation: The problem says &quot;the event with probability (C₁₃₂C₄³ + C₄²)/C₃₆⁴&quot;. Maybe the event is the union of two events: one where you choose 1 red and 3 white, and another where you choose 2 white. But choosing 2 white in total? If you need to choose 4 balls, choosing 2 white would require 2 red. So maybe it&#39;s supposed to be C(4,2)*C(32,2). But it&#39;s written as C(4,2). If it&#39;s a typo, then the answer is B or C or D. But without knowing, it&#39;s hard.Alternatively, if the problem is correct as written, then perhaps the event is &quot;either selecting 1 red and 3 white, or selecting 2 white (without specifying the rest)&quot;. But in reality, when you draw 4 balls, selecting 2 white requires 2 red. So the problem&#39;s expression is missing the red part in the second term. So this might be an error. If we assume that the second term is a mistake and should include C(32,2), then the event would be &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white&quot;, which translates to &quot;at least 2 white&quot;. But none of the options are about that.Given the answer choices, and the fact that the first term (128) corresponds to &quot;at most one red&quot; (which is 128+1=129), and the given numerator is 128+6=134, which is 5 more than 129. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem statement. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, and given the available options, the closest possible answer is B: At most one red ball, but this doesn&#39;t exactly match. Alternatively, the problem might have intended the second term to be C(4,4), making the numerator 129, which matches B. Given that, maybe it&#39;s a typo, and the answer is B.Alternatively, another approach: The given probability is (number of ways to have 3 white and 1 red + number of ways to have 2 white) / total. But having 2 white requires 2 red. If the problem incorrectly omits the red part, maybe the event is &quot;the number of white balls is 3 or 2&quot;. Which would be an event not listed in the options. But the options are about red balls. So if you have 3 or 2 white, then the number of red balls is 1 or 2. So the event is &quot;the number of red balls is 1 or 2&quot;. But none of the options describe that. The closest is D: At least one red ball, which includes 1,2,3,4 red balls. But the given probability only includes 1 and 2. So it&#39;s a subset.This is very confusing. Given that, and considering that perhaps the problem had a typo, and the correct numerator for option B is C(32,1)C(4,3) + C(4,4)=128+1=129, which is option B. Then the given expression mistakenly has C(4,2) instead of C(4,4). If that&#39;s the case, then the answer is B.Alternatively, if we take the problem as written, the answer isn&#39;t there. But since it&#39;s a multiple-choice question, we have to choose the closest possible. Given that 128 is part of B (at most one red), and 6 might be an error, the most plausible answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves determining the probability of drawing four balls from a box containing 36 balls (4 white and 32 red) with the given probability expression (dfrac{C_{32}^{1}C_{4}^{3} + C_{4}^{2}}{C_{36}^{4}}).1. Analyzing the numerator:   - The first term (C_{32}^{1}C_{4}^{3}) represents the number of ways to choose 1 red ball and 3 white balls.   - The second term (C_{4}^{2}) represents the number of ways to choose 2 white balls. However, choosing 2 white balls implies the remaining 2 balls must be red, which should be (C_{4}^{2}C_{32}^{2}). This term seems incomplete, suggesting a possible typo.2. Considering the options:   - Option A (No red balls): This would require all 4 balls to be white, calculated as (C_{4}^{4} = 1), which does not match the given numerator.   - Option B (At most one red ball): This includes 0 red (all white) or 1 red (3 white, 1 red). The correct calculation is (C_{4}^{4} + C_{4}^{3}C_{32}^{1} = 1 + 128 = 129). The given numerator is 134, which is close but not exact.   - Option C (At least one white ball): This is the complement of all red balls, calculated as (1 - dfrac{C_{32}^{4}}{C_{36}^{4}}), which does not match the given expression.   - Option D (At least one red ball): This is the complement of all white balls, calculated as (1 - dfrac{C_{4}^{4}}{C_{36}^{4}}), which also does not match.3. Conclusion:   - The given numerator (C_{32}^{1}C_{4}^{3} + C_{4}^{2}) suggests a possible typo, as the second term should include red balls. The closest plausible answer, considering the first term and potential typo, is Option B (At most one red ball).boxed{B},&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is about a box with 36 balls, 4 of which are white. The probability given is a combination of some terms divided by the total number of ways to draw four balls. The options are different events, and I need to figure out which one corresponds to the given probability.First, let me parse the probability expression:The numerator is C(32,1) * C(4,3) + C(4,2). The denominator is C(36,4). Let me recall that C(n,k) is the combination formula, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!)). So, breaking down the numerator:1. C(32,1) * C(4,3): That&#39;s choosing 1 item from 32 and 3 items from 4. Then adding C(4,2): choosing 2 items from 4. Then all divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 items from 36.Hmm. Let me think. The box has 36 balls, 4 white, so the rest must be red. 36 - 4 = 32 red balls. So, the red balls are 32, white are 4.So the events in the numerator are combinations involving red and white balls. Let&#39;s analyze each term:First term: C(32,1) * C(4,3). This is choosing 1 red ball and 3 white balls. Because there are 32 red balls, so choosing 1 red, and 4 white balls, but since we can only choose 3 white, that would be C(4,3). Wait, but there are only 4 white balls. So choosing 3 white and 1 red.Second term: C(4,2). That&#39;s choosing 2 white balls. But wait, if we are choosing 4 balls in total, then if we choose 2 white balls, the other 2 must be red? But here the term is just C(4,2), not multiplied by anything. That doesn&#39;t seem right. Wait, maybe I need to check that again.Wait, the problem states the probability is [C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2)] / C(36,4). So numerator is (32 choose 1)(4 choose 3) plus (4 choose 2). So perhaps these are two separate cases.First case: 1 red and 3 white. Second case: 2 white. Wait, but if you are choosing 4 balls, how does choosing 2 white balls fit into that? Unless it&#39;s 2 white and 2 red. But then why isn&#39;t it multiplied by C(32,2)? That seems inconsistent. Unless there&#39;s a typo, but probably not. Let me think again.Wait, maybe the total number of balls drawn is 4, so if the first term is 1 red and 3 white, that&#39;s 4 balls. The second term is C(4,2), which would be choosing 2 white balls, but then the remaining 2 must be red, but why isn&#39;t that multiplied by C(32,2)? Because the problem could be phrased in terms of specific numbers.Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;exactly 3 white balls or exactly 2 white balls&quot;. Let&#39;s see:- Exactly 3 white balls: To choose 3 white out of 4, and 1 red out of 32: C(4,3)*C(32,1).- Exactly 2 white balls: To choose 2 white out of 4, and the rest red. But if we are choosing 4 balls total, then 2 white and 2 red. So that should be C(4,2)*C(32,2). But in the given expression, it&#39;s just C(4,2). That&#39;s a problem. Unless maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps my interpretation is wrong.Wait, let me check the original problem again: &quot;the probability of drawing four balls and having the event with probability (C(32,1)C(4,3) + C(4,2)) / C(36,4)&quot;. So maybe the event is 3 white and 1 red OR 2 white and... but if it&#39;s 2 white, then the rest would be 2 red. So why isn&#39;t that term C(4,2)*C(32,2)? Unless they made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about color but something else? But the options mention red and white balls. Wait, in the problem, it&#39;s stated that there are 4 white balls, so the rest (32) are red. So the colors are white and red.Therefore, the events must be related to the number of white or red balls. Let me think again. The numerator is C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). Let&#39;s compute what each part represents:C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 white balls. Then multiplied by C(32,1): number of ways to choose 1 red ball. So that&#39;s 3 white and 1 red.Then C(4,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 white balls. But if we are choosing 4 balls in total, then 2 white and 2 red. So to complete this, we need to multiply by C(32,2) for the red balls. But in the given expression, it&#39;s just C(4,2). So unless there&#39;s a typo here, this doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, maybe the problem was written incorrectly? Let me check again. The problem says: &quot;The probability of drawing four balls and having the event with probability (C₁³² × C₃⁴ + C₂⁴)/C₄³₆&quot;. So that&#39;s (C(32,1) * C(4,3) + C(4,2)) / C(36,4). So as written, it&#39;s (32*4 + 6)/C(36,4). Wait, 32*4 is 128, plus 6 is 134. Then denominator is C(36,4). So total favorable outcomes are 134. But if the event is 3 white and 1 red plus 2 white and 2 red, then the number of favorable outcomes should be [C(4,3)*C(32,1) + C(4,2)*C(32,2)]. But in the given problem, it&#39;s missing the C(32,2) part. So maybe there&#39;s a mistake here?Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about white and red, but about something else. Wait, the problem says 4 white balls, so the rest are red. So 32 red. So the options are about red balls. Let me look at the options again:A: No red balls. That would mean all four are white. So the number of ways is C(4,4) = 1. But in the given numerator, it&#39;s 32*4 + 6 = 134. So that&#39;s way higher. So A is not the answer.B: At most one red ball. At most one red ball means 0 red or 1 red. 0 red is all white: C(4,4) = 1. 1 red is C(32,1)*C(4,3). So total is 1 + 32*4 = 1 + 128 = 129. But the given numerator is 134, which is higher. So B is not the answer.C: At least one white ball. That is the complement of no white balls. The probability would be 1 - [C(32,4)/C(36,4)]. But the given expression is (128 + 6)/C(36,4) = 134/C(36,4). So unless 134 is equal to C(36,4) - C(32,4), which would be the number of ways to have at least one white. Let me check that.C(36,4) - C(32,4) = total ways - ways with no white balls (all red). Let&#39;s compute C(36,4) = (36*35*34*33)/(4*3*2*1) = let&#39;s see, 36*35=1260, 1260*34=42840, 42840*33=1,413,720. Then divided by 24: 1,413,720 /24 = 58,905. So C(36,4)=58,905.C(32,4) = (32*31*30*29)/(4*3*2*1). 32*31=992, 992*30=29,760, 29,760*29=863,040. Divided by 24: 863,040 /24=35,960. So C(36,4) - C(32,4) = 58,905 - 35,960 = 22,945. But the given numerator is 134. 134 is way smaller than 22,945, so C is not the answer.D: At least one red ball. That is the complement of all white balls. So the probability is 1 - C(4,4)/C(36,4) = 1 - 1/58,905. But that&#39;s not the given probability. The given probability is 134/58,905. So that&#39;s not the same. So D is not the answer either.Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, the given probability is [C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2)] / C(36,4). Let&#39;s compute the numerator: C(32,1) is 32, C(4,3) is 4, so 32*4=128. Then C(4,2)=6. So total numerator is 128 +6=134. So probability is 134/58905 ≈ 0.002275. Hmm, which is about 0.2275%. That&#39;s a very low probability.Looking at the options:A: No red balls. That&#39;s all white, which is C(4,4)=1. So 1/58905 ≈ 0.0017%, which is even lower. So the given probability is higher than that, so A is not.B: At most one red ball. As I computed earlier, that is 1 + 128 = 129. 129/58905 ≈ 0.00219, which is about 0.219%. Close to 134, but not the same. So not B.C: At least one white ball. That is 1 - C(32,4)/C(36,4) ≈ 1 - 35,960/58,905 ≈ 1 - 0.6105 ≈ 0.3895, so 38.95%. So that&#39;s way higher. So not C.D: At least one red ball. That is 1 - 1/58905 ≈ 0.99998, which is 99.998%. Not matching 0.2275%.Wait, so none of the options seem to match. But that can&#39;t be. Maybe I miscalculated. Wait, let&#39;s check again.Wait, maybe the problem is not &quot;exactly 3 white and 1 red plus exactly 2 white and 2 red&quot;, but something else. Wait, but in the numerator, it&#39;s C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). That is, 1 red and 3 white, plus 2 white. Wait, but 2 white and how many red? If you choose 2 white, and the total is 4, then you need to choose 2 red. But the term C(4,2) is just the number of ways to choose 2 white, but without considering the red. That seems incorrect. So maybe the problem is miswritten? Or perhaps the event is &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white&quot;, but in that case, it should be C(4,3)*C(32,1) + C(4,2)*C(32,2). But in the problem, the second term is just C(4,2). So that would only account for the white balls, not the red ones. That seems wrong. So perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about something else. Wait, the event is written as (C₁³² × C₃⁴ + C₂⁴). Maybe that notation is different. Wait, sometimes people write C(n, k) as C^k_n, but here it&#39;s written as C₁³², which might be C^1_32, which is C(32,1). Similarly, C₃⁴ is C^3_4, which is C(4,3). Then C₂⁴ is C^2_4. So the numerator is indeed C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2). So that&#39;s 32*4 + 6 = 134.Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white, with some condition on red balls&quot;. Wait, but if it&#39;s exactly 3 white, you need 1 red. If it&#39;s exactly 2 white, you need 2 red. So unless the problem is phrased differently. Wait, maybe the event is &quot;having exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white, but the red balls are not considered&quot;. But that doesn&#39;t make sense, because when you draw 4 balls, you have both white and red. Unless the problem is about arranging the balls in some way where only white balls are counted? But the options are about red balls.Wait, let&#39;s read the problem again: &quot;the probability of drawing four balls and having the event with probability (C(32,1)C(4,3) + C(4,2))/C(36,4) is (    )&quot;. The options are events A to D. So the given expression is the probability of some event, and we have to choose which event (A, B, C, D) corresponds to that probability.So, perhaps the problem is not miswritten, but my interpretation is wrong. Let me try another angle.Let me think of the problem in terms of possible events. The given probability is [C(32,1)C(4,3) + C(4,2)] / C(36,4). Let me compute the two terms:First term: C(32,1)*C(4,3). This is the number of ways to choose 1 red and 3 white balls.Second term: C(4,2). This is the number of ways to choose 2 white balls. Wait, but in total, we are choosing 4 balls, so if we choose 2 white, we need to choose 2 red. But in the numerator, it&#39;s only C(4,2), not multiplied by C(32,2). That seems inconsistent. So this suggests that maybe the problem statement has a typo, and the second term should be C(4,2)*C(32,2). If that were the case, then the numerator would be the number of ways to choose 3 white and 1 red plus 2 white and 2 red. Then the event would be &quot;exactly 3 white or exactly 2 white&quot;, but none of the options are about the number of white balls.Wait, the options are about red balls. Let me see:A: No red balls. So all white. That&#39;s C(4,4) = 1. Not the given numerator.B: At most one red ball. So 0 red or 1 red. 0 red: 1 way. 1 red: C(32,1)*C(4,3). So total is 1 + 32*4 = 1 + 128 = 129. But the given numerator is 134, which is 129 +5. So unless there is a miscalculation. Wait, 134 -129 =5. Where does 5 come from? Hmm. Not sure.Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;exactly three white or exactly two white without considering red&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, let&#39;s compute the given numerator: C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2) = 32*4 +6= 128 +6=134. So 134 is the number of favorable outcomes. So what event would have 134 favorable outcomes?Total number of ways to draw four balls is C(36,4)=58905. So 134 is a very small number.Looking at the options again:A: No red balls: 1 way.B: At most one red ball: 129 ways.C: At least one white ball: 58905 - C(32,4)=58905 -35960=22945.D: At least one red ball: 58905 -1=58904.So given that the given numerator is 134, which is between B&#39;s 129 and ... but 134 is not exactly any of these. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem has a typo? If the second term was C(4,2)*C(32,2), then the numerator would be 128 + C(32,2)*C(4,2). Wait, C(32,2) is 496. 496*6=2976. So 128 +2976= 3104. Then 3104/58905≈0.0527, which is about 5.27%. But that&#39;s still not matching any of the options.Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about the number of red or white balls but something else. Wait, maybe the event is related to specific positions or something, but the options are all about red or white balls.Alternatively, maybe the problem is worded as &quot;the event with probability [given expression]&quot;, but the given expression is not directly the number of favorable over total, but the probability is calculated as such. Wait, perhaps the problem is in Chinese and the translation is slightly off? The original user might have had a Chinese problem, given the formatting. But I can&#39;t be sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s think differently. Maybe the event is &quot;three white and one red, or two white&quot;. But two white what? If it&#39;s two white balls, then the rest two are red. But as I said, that would require multiplying by C(32,2). Unless the problem is considering only the white balls and disregarding the red ones? But that doesn&#39;t align with standard probability calculations.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering arrangements where specific conditions on the white balls are met, regardless of red. For example, if the event is &quot;at least three white balls or exactly two white balls&quot;, but again, the count would be different.Wait, let&#39;s compute &quot;exactly three white or exactly two white&quot;:Exactly three white: C(4,3)*C(32,1)=4*32=128.Exactly two white: C(4,2)*C(32,2)=6*496=2976.So total would be 128 +2976=3104.That&#39;s way more than 134.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering sequences instead of combinations? For example, if order matters. But the problem uses combinations (C notation), so order shouldn&#39;t matter.Wait, another approach: Let&#39;s see what 134 corresponds to. 134 = C(4,3)*C(32,1) + C(4,2). If I consider that C(4,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 white balls without considering red, but then how does that form an event? Maybe the event is &quot;3 white and 1 red, or 2 white and unspecified others&quot;. But in combinations, you need to specify all the balls. So if it&#39;s 2 white and 2 red, you have to include the reds. So this is confusing.Wait, maybe the problem is not well-posed, but given the options, perhaps the closest one is B: At most one red ball. Because &quot;at most one red&quot; is 0 red or 1 red. 0 red is all white: C(4,4)=1. 1 red is C(32,1)*C(4,3)=128. Total is 129. But the given numerator is 134, which is 5 more. Hmm, not quite.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation. Wait, 134 -128=6. Which is equal to C(4,2). So perhaps the problem is considering 3 white and 1 red plus 2 white and 0 red? Wait, but 2 white and 0 red would be 2 white and 2 more non-white, but if it&#39;s 0 red, that would require all white. But 2 white and 0 red is impossible because you have to draw 4 balls. If you have 2 white, the other 2 must be red. Unless there are other colors, but the problem only mentions white and red. So maybe the problem is incorrect.Alternatively, the question might have a different structure. Let&#39;s consider that perhaps the event is &quot;three white and one red, or two white and two white&quot;. Wait, two white and two white? That doesn&#39;t make sense. Or maybe the event is &quot;three white and one red, or two white and two red where the two red are something specific&quot;. But there&#39;s no mention of anything specific about red balls.Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Let&#39;s see, in the numerator, we have 32*4 +6. 32 is the number of red balls, 4 is the number of ways to choose 3 white, and 6 is the number of ways to choose 2 white. Maybe the event is &quot;at least three white or exactly two white&quot;, but in terms of some other relation.Wait, if I think in terms of the problem&#39;s options, let&#39;s check each one:A: No red balls. All white. Probability 1/C(36,4). Not the given.B: At most one red ball. Probability [C(4,4) + C(32,1)C(4,3)] / C(36,4) = (1 +128)/58905=129/58905. Close to 134, but not the same.C: At least one white ball. Probability 1 - C(32,4)/C(36,4). As computed earlier, much larger than 134.D: At least one red ball. Probability almost 1, so not.But the given is 134. If I consider that maybe the problem has a typo, and instead of C(4,2), it&#39;s C(4,2)*C(32,2). Then the numerator would be 128 + 6*496=128 + 2976=3104. Which would correspond to exactly three white or exactly two white. But none of the options are about that. Alternatively, if it&#39;s a different typo, maybe C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(32,2)*C(4,2), but miswritten as adding C(4,2). Then the answer would be B? No, that&#39;s &quot;at most one red&quot;, which is 0 or 1 red. But the given is 3 white and 1 red, and 2 white and 2 red, which would be more than one red. So that doesn&#39;t fit.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering &quot;at least three white or exactly two white&quot;. But the options don&#39;t mention white balls except C: at least one white. Which is much broader.Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;three white and one red, or two white&quot;. But &quot;two white&quot; what? If it&#39;s two white balls, then the rest are red. But the count would need to include the reds.Wait, unless the problem is in a context where &quot;having the event&quot; refers to something else, not directly the number of balls. For example, arranging the balls in a specific way or something else. But the options are about the number of red or white balls.Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to map the given expression to one of the options, even if it&#39;s not exact. The closest is B: At most one red ball, which is 129, while the given is 134. The difference is 5. Maybe the problem had a different intention. Let me check once again:Wait, C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,2) = 32*4 +6= 134.If the event is &quot;exactly three white balls or exactly two white balls and something about red balls&quot;. But what?Alternatively, maybe the problem is counting the number of ways where there are three white and one red, or two white and two... but in the second case, it&#39;s not two white and two red, but two white and two non-red? But all non-white are red. So it&#39;s the same as two white and two red. But then the count is wrong.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering some other property, like the first ball is red or something. But the options don&#39;t mention order.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a misinterpretation of the combination terms. For instance, in Chinese notation, sometimes the indices are reversed. Maybe C₁³² is actually C(32,1), which is correct. C₃⁴ is C(4,3)=4. C₂⁴ is C(4,2)=6. So that part is correct.Wait, maybe the event is &quot;the number of red balls is 1 or the number of white balls is 2&quot;. But that would mean 1 red or 2 white. But in terms of probability, that&#39;s overlapping events. Wait, if you have 2 white, you have 2 red. So it&#39;s not exclusive. The total number of ways would be (number of ways to have 1 red) + (number of ways to have 2 white). But the number of ways to have 2 white is C(4,2)*C(32,2). But in the problem, it&#39;s just C(4,2). So unless they are considering only the white balls and not the red, which is incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering &quot;three white balls and one red ball, or two white balls&quot;, but in the second case, the number of red balls is not considered. But that would mean two white balls and any number of red balls, but since we are drawing four, it would be two white and two red. But the count is still missing the red combinations.Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different color scheme. For example, maybe the 32 are not red but another color, and the question is about a different color. But the options mention red and white.Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about color but about something else, like numbered balls. But the options are about colors.This is perplexing. Let me try to compute 134 / 58905 ≈ 0.002275, which is approximately 0.2275%. This is a very low probability. Which of the options has such a low probability?Option A: No red balls (all white): 1/58905≈0.0017%.Option B: At most one red ball: 129/58905≈0.219%.Option C: At least one white ball: ≈38.95%.Option D: At least one red ball: ≈99.998%.So the given probability is ~0.2275%, which is closest to Option B&#39;s ~0.219%. The difference is 5/58905≈0.0085%. It&#39;s very close but not exact. Maybe the problem has a typo, and the correct numerator is 129, which would match Option B. Alternatively, if the given expression was C(32,1)*C(4,3) + C(4,4), that would be 128 +1=129, matching Option B. Maybe there was a typo in the problem statement, replacing C(4,4) with C(4,2). If that&#39;s the case, then the answer would be B. But given that the problem states C(4,2), maybe the answer is not among the options. However, since the options are given, and the closest is B, but the difference is 5, which is C(4,2)=6. Wait, 134 -129=5. Not exactly 6. Hmmm.Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I&#39;m missing something. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering &quot;exactly one red ball or exactly two white balls&quot;. But &quot;exactly two white balls&quot; would correspond to two white and two red, which would be C(4,2)*C(32,2). But in the given expression, it&#39;s C(4,2). So maybe the problem is considering &quot;exactly one red and three white, or exactly two white and two non-red&quot;. But all non-white are red. So two white and two non-red is the same as two white and two red, which is C(4,2)*C(32,2). So again, the problem&#39;s numerator is missing the C(32,2) term.Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about drawing four balls, but about something else, but the question says &quot;drawing four balls&quot;.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that the event is &quot;having three white balls and one red ball, or having two white balls regardless of the number of red balls&quot;. But in the case of two white balls, you must have two red balls, since you&#39;re drawing four. So that interpretation doesn&#39;t make sense.Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the second term should be C(32,2) + C(4,2). But that would be different.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a different context where after drawing four balls, you check for a different condition. For example, arranging the four balls in a line and having certain positions being white or red. But the options don&#39;t mention anything about positions.Alternatively, think outside the box: maybe the event is &quot;having at least three white balls or a pair of white balls&quot;. A pair usually means two, so &quot;at least three or exactly two&quot;. But again, the count would require more.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of white balls in a different way. For example, in the first case, three white and one red, and in the second case, two white, but considering permutations. But no, combinations are used.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if 134 is the number of ways to have at least three white balls. That would be exactly three white or exactly four white. Exactly three white: C(4,3)*C(32,1)=128. Exactly four white: C(4,4)=1. Total 129. Which is option B. But again, 129 vs 134.Wait, this is really confusing. Given that the problem&#39;s given expression seems to have an extra 5, which is close to C(4,2)=6, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake. Maybe the problem meant to write C(4,3)*C(32,1) + C(4,4), which would be 128 +1=129, corresponding to Option B. If that&#39;s the case, then the answer is B. But given the problem as stated, it&#39;s 134, which doesn&#39;t match any option. However, since the closest is B, and possibly a typo, maybe the intended answer is B.Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to see what 134 corresponds to. Let me think of 134 as 32*4 +6. 32 is the number of red balls, 4 is C(4,3), 6 is C(4,2). So maybe it&#39;s the number of ways to pick 1 red and 3 white plus the number of ways to pick 2 white. But if you pick 2 white, you have to pick 2 red. So this is undercounting. Unless they are considering different experiments. Wait, maybe the problem is not about a single draw of four balls, but something else.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s two separate events: drawing three white and one red, then drawing two white. But the problem says &quot;drawing four balls and having the event&quot;. So it&#39;s a single draw.Alternatively, perhaps the event is &quot;at least three white balls or at least two white balls&quot;. But &quot;at least three&quot; includes &quot;at least two&quot;, so it&#39;s just &quot;at least two&quot;. The probability would be much higher.Alternatively, maybe the event is &quot;three white and one red, or two white and two red of a specific type&quot;. But there&#39;s no mention of specific types.This is really puzzling. Given the available options and the given probability, even though there&#39;s a discrepancy, the closest option is B: At most one red ball. Because 129 is very close to 134, and it&#39;s possible that there was a typo in the problem, swapping C(4,4) with C(4,2). If the original problem had C(4,4) instead of C(4,2), then the numerator would be 128 +1=129, which matches Option B. Given that, and considering that exams sometimes have typos, perhaps the intended answer is B.Alternatively, another approach: let&#39;s think of the given expression:[C(32,1)C(4,3) + C(4,2)] / C(36,4)This can be written as [number of ways to choose 1 red and 3 white + number of ways to choose 2 white] / total ways.But since we&#39;re choosing 4 balls, if we choose 2 white, we have to choose 2 red. But the term C(4,2) only counts the white balls, not the red. So this seems incorrect. However, if we assume that the problem meant to say C(4,2)*C(32,2), then the event is &quot;3 white and 1 red or 2 white and 2 red&quot;. The probability of this event would be [C(4,3)C(32,1) + C(4,2)C(32,2)] / C(36,4). But since the given expression lacks the C(32,2) term, this is confusing.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for something else. For example, if you draw four balls, what is the probability that you have three white and one red, or two white (and the rest can be anything). But in that case, the two white would require specifying the rest, but the problem doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s unclear.Given that all options are about red balls except C, which is about white balls, and the given probability involves both red and white counts, perhaps we need to relate it to the number of red balls.The given probability&#39;s numerator: 32*4 +6=134. This can be thought of as scenarios involving different numbers of red balls:- 3 white and 1 red: involves 1 red ball.- 2 white and 2 red: involves 2 red balls. But in the given expression, the second term is only C(4,2), missing the red part. If we had both terms properly, it would be scenarios with 1 or 2 red balls. The number of red balls here would be 1 or 2. So the event would be &quot;1 or 2 red balls&quot;, which is not directly any of the options. However, looking at the options:A: No red balls. (0 red)B: At most one red ball. (0 or 1 red)C: At least one white ball. (1,2,3,4 white)D: At least one red ball. (1,2,3,4 red)If the given expression is considering 1 or 2 red balls (from 3 white, 1 red or 2 white, 2 red), but since the second term is missing the red combinations, it&#39;s not directly corresponding. However, if we suppose that the problem intended to have the correct terms, then &quot;1 or 2 red balls&quot; is not an option, but maybe &quot;at most two red balls&quot; or similar. But the options don&#39;t have that.Alternatively, if we take the given expression as is, it&#39;s 1 red and 3 white, or 2 white (without specifying red). Since you can&#39;t have 2 white without 2 red, perhaps the problem is considering only the white balls and saying &quot;3 or 2 white balls&quot;, but expressed in terms of red. If you have 3 white balls, you have 1 red; if you have 2 white, you have 2 red. So the number of red balls is 1 or 2. Which is not directly an option. The closest is B: At most one red ball. But &quot;at most one&quot; would include 0 and 1, but here we have 1 and 2.Alternatively, maybe the question is ill-posed, but since we have to choose from the given options, and the probability given is 134/58905, which is approximately 0.2275%, and the only option with a similarly low probability is B: At most one red ball, which is 129/58905≈0.219%, very close. Maybe due to rounding or a typo, the answer is B.Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the event is &quot;exactly three white or exactly two white&quot;, but the options don&#39;t have that. However, if we interpret the options in terms of white balls, option C is &quot;at least one white ball&quot;, which is much broader. Since none of the options directly correspond, but considering the given terms, the closest is B.Given that, I think the intended answer is B: At most one red ball, assuming a typo in the problem statement where C(4,2) should be C(4,4). However, based on the given numbers, it&#39;s not exact. But since the difference is small and it&#39;s the closest option, I will go with B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves determining which event corresponds to the given probability expression (dfrac{C_{32}^{1}C_{4}^{3} + C_{4}^{2}}{C_{36}^{4}}).1. Understanding the Probability Expression:   - The numerator consists of two terms: (C_{32}^{1}C_{4}^{3}) and (C_{4}^{2}).   - The denominator is (C_{36}^{4}), representing the total number of ways to draw 4 balls from 36.2. Analyzing the Terms:   - (C_{32}^{1}C_{4}^{3}) represents choosing 1 red ball and 3 white balls.   - (C_{4}^{2}) represents choosing 2 white balls. However, this term should ideally be multiplied by (C_{32}^{2}) to account for the remaining red balls when choosing 2 white balls. This suggests a possible typo or misinterpretation in the problem statement.3. Evaluating the Options:   - Option A (No red balls): This would require all 4 balls to be white, calculated as (C_{4}^{4} = 1), which is much smaller than the given numerator.   - Option B (At most one red ball): This includes 0 red balls (all white) and 1 red ball (3 white). The calculation is (C_{4}^{4} + C_{32}^{1}C_{4}^{3} = 1 + 128 = 129). This is close to the given numerator (134), suggesting a possible typo where (C_{4}^{2}) should be (C_{4}^{4}).   - Option C (At least one white ball): This is much broader, calculated as (C_{36}^{4} - C_{32}^{4}), resulting in a much larger value.   - Option D (At least one red ball): This is almost certain, calculated as (1 - frac{1}{C_{36}^{4}}), which is nearly 1.4. Conclusion:   - The closest match to the given probability, despite the discrepancy, is Option B. The difference might be due to a typo in the problem statement, where (C_{4}^{2}) should be (C_{4}^{4}).boxed{B}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf77425d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf77425d><span class="icon" data-v-cf77425d>🔑:</span>AnalysisThis question examines the calculation and application of the classical probability model.

The ratio of their quantities is 2:3:7. They&#39;re using stratified sampling, and the sample has 10 units of model A. The question is asking for the total number of units in the sample. Hmm, let me think.First, stratified sampling... Right, that&#39;s a method where the population is divided into subgroups (or strata) and samples are taken from each stratum in proportion to their size. So the idea is that the sample should reflect the population&#39;s structure. In this case, the strata are the three models A, B, and C with a ratio of 2:3:7. The given ratio is 2:3:7 for A:B:C. That means for every 2 units of A, there are 3 units of B and 7 units of C. So the total ratio is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 parts. But stratified sampling would mean that the sample taken from each stratum is proportional to their size in the population. Wait, the problem says that the sample contains 10 units of model A. So since model A is supposed to be 2 parts of the ratio, and we have 10 units in the sample, we can find out the scaling factor for the ratio. Let me explain.If the ratio for A is 2 and the sample has 10 units of A, then the scaling factor would be 10 divided by 2, which is 5. So that means each part of the ratio corresponds to 5 units in the sample. Therefore, model B, which is 3 parts, would have 3 * 5 = 15 units in the sample, and model C, which is 7 parts, would have 7 * 5 = 35 units in the sample. Adding those up: 10 (A) + 15 (B) + 35 (C) = 60 units in total. So the total number of units in the sample should be 60. Let me check if that makes sense.Alternatively, maybe I can set up a proportion. Since the ratio is 2:3:7, the proportion of model A in the population is 2/(2+3+7) = 2/12 = 1/6. But in stratified sampling, the sample proportion should match the population proportion. However, in this case, the problem states that the sample contains 10 units of model A. So perhaps we need to ensure that the number of units sampled from each stratum is proportional to their size in the population.Wait, but in stratified sampling, you can either have proportional allocation (where the sample sizes per stratum are proportional to their population sizes) or optimal allocation (which considers variability). But since the problem doesn&#39;t mention anything about variability, I think it&#39;s safe to assume proportional allocation.So if the population ratio is 2:3:7, then the sample should also have the same ratio. Since model A has 10 units in the sample, which corresponds to the ratio number 2, then as before, each ratio unit corresponds to 5 sample units. Therefore, model B would be 3*5=15 and model C 7*5=35, totaling 10+15+35=60. Alternatively, if I denote the scaling factor as k, then 2k = 10 (for model A). Solving for k gives k=5. Then the total sample size is 2k + 3k +7k =12k =12*5=60. Yep, that&#39;s the same answer. So I think the answer is 60. Let me make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake here. The key idea is that stratified sampling with proportional allocation means the sample ratios match the population ratios. Therefore, if the sample has 10 units for A (which is 2 parts), each part is 5, leading to 15 for B (3 parts) and 35 for C (7 parts). Summing them gives 60. Another way to check: If the total sample size is 60, then the number of each model should be 2/12 *60=10, 3/12*60=15, and 7/12*60=35. That&#39;s exactly what we have. So yes, that seems correct. I can&#39;t see any errors in this reasoning. So the total number of units in the sample is 60.Final AnswerThe total number of units in the sample is boxed{60}.&lt;/think&gt;The factory produces three models A, B, and C in the ratio 2:3:7. Stratified sampling is used, and the sample contains 10 units of model A. To find the total number of units in the sample, we note that the ratio 2:3:7 implies that for every 2 units of model A, there are 3 units of model B and 7 units of model C. Given that the sample contains 10 units of model A, we determine the scaling factor ( k ) by solving ( 2k = 10 ). This gives ( k = 5 ).Using this scaling factor, the number of units for model B is ( 3k = 3 times 5 = 15 ) and for model C is ( 7k = 7 times 5 = 35 ).Adding these together, the total number of units in the sample is:[10 + 15 + 35 = 60]Thus, the total number of units in the sample is (boxed{60}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here about a factory producing three models: A, B, and C. The ratio of their quantities is 2:3:7. They&#39;re using stratified sampling, and the sample needs to include 10 units of model A. I need to figure out the total number of units in the entire sample. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, stratified sampling. From what I remember, stratified sampling is a method where the population is divided into subgroups (or strata) and a random sample is taken from each stratum. The idea is that each subgroup is represented proportionally in the sample. So, if model A, B, and C are the strata here, the sample should have the same ratio as the population. That is, the number of units sampled from each model should be in the ratio 2:3:7.The problem states that the sample contains 10 units of model A. So, I need to figure out how many units of B and C should be in the sample to maintain the ratio 2:3:7, and then add them all up for the total sample size.Let me confirm that understanding. The ratio of the quantities in the population is 2:3:7. So, in the sample, the number of units from each model should also follow this ratio. Therefore, if there are 10 units of model A in the sample, which corresponds to the &#39;2&#39; part of the ratio, I can set up a proportion to find out how many units of B and C there should be.Let me think. The ratio is 2:3:7 for A:B:C. So, in the sample, the number of A is 10. Let&#39;s let the ratio numbers correspond to some multiple. Let me denote the scaling factor as &#39;k&#39;. Then, the number of A units is 2k, B is 3k, and C is 7k. In the sample, since we know the number of A units is 10, we can set up 2k = 10. Solving for k would give k = 5. Then, the number of B units would be 3k = 15, and C units would be 7k = 35. Therefore, the total sample size would be 10 + 15 + 35 = 60. So, is the answer 60?Wait, let me make sure I&#39;m not making a mistake here. Stratified sampling can sometimes be done proportionally or disproportionately. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify that it&#39;s disproportionate, so I think it&#39;s safe to assume proportional stratified sampling where the sample maintains the same ratios as the population.Therefore, if model A in the sample is 10 units, which corresponds to the ratio part 2, then each ratio unit is 5, so model B is 15 and model C is 35. So total sample size is 10 + 15 + 35 = 60. That seems straightforward. Let me check again.Alternatively, maybe I need to think in terms of fractions. If the ratio is 2:3:7, then the total ratio is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 parts. The proportion of model A in the population is 2/12 = 1/6. But in the sample, if we have 10 units of A, which is the same proportion as in the population, then the total sample size would be 10 divided by (1/6), which is 10 * 6 = 60. So that&#39;s another way to get the same answer. Therefore, the total sample size is 60. Hmm, that confirms the previous result.Wait, but hold on. Wait, in stratified sampling, you can have different sampling fractions for each stratum. But if it&#39;s proportional stratified sampling, then the sampling fraction is the same across all strata, so the sample ratios match the population ratios. If the problem just says &quot;stratified sampling method,&quot; does that automatically mean proportional? Or could it be any stratified sample where you sample some from each stratum, but not necessarily proportionally?But the problem states &quot;a stratified sampling method is used to draw a sample that contains 10 units of model A&quot;. It doesn&#39;t mention anything about the numbers of B and C. So maybe we need to assume that the sample is constructed in such a way that the ratios are maintained as per the population. Otherwise, if the ratios aren&#39;t maintained, we could have any number of B and C. But the problem must be expecting us to use the given ratio to find the total sample size. Otherwise, there&#39;s not enough information.Therefore, the problem must be implying that the sample has the same ratio as the population. So 10 units of A correspond to the ratio 2, so scaling factor is 5, leading to 15 B and 35 C. Total 60.Alternatively, if they didn&#39;t maintain the ratio, the answer could vary, but since ratios are given, and it&#39;s a math problem, we need to use that ratio to find the answer. So yes, 60 seems correct.Therefore, the total number of units in the sample is 60.Final AnswerThe total number of units in the sample is boxed{60}.&lt;/think&gt;The factory produces three models A, B, and C in the ratio 2:3:7. A stratified sampling method is used, and the sample contains 10 units of model A. We need to determine the total number of units in the sample.1. The given ratio of the quantities of models A, B, and C is 2:3:7.2. In stratified sampling, the sample should maintain the same ratio as the population.3. Let the scaling factor for the ratio be ( k ). For model A, the number of units in the sample is 10, which corresponds to the ratio part 2. Therefore, we have:   [   2k = 10 implies k = 5   ]4.

The problem says that integers a, b, c, and d satisfy abcd = 25, with a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d. We need to find |a + b| + |c + d| and the options are A:0, B:10, C:2, D:12. Hmm, alright. Let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, since a, b, c, d are integers and their product is 25, we need to think about the factors of 25. 25 is 5 squared, so its factors are 1, 5, and 25. But since there are four integers multiplied together, and 25 is positive, we might need to use both positive and negative integers because multiplying four numbers to get a positive result can happen with all positive numbers, two negative numbers, or four negative numbers. But since a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, they must be in decreasing order.Wait, but 25 is positive, so the number of negative factors must be even. So possible cases are all four positive or two negative and two positive or four negative. But since they are in decreasing order a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, if all four are positive, then a is the largest positive, followed by b, c, d. If there are two negatives and two positives, the negatives would have to be the smaller numbers, right? Because in the ordering a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, the larger numbers would be positive and the smaller ones negative. Similarly, if all four are negative, then a is the least negative, which would be the largest in value.But let&#39;s think about possible integer factors. 25 can be written as 1 * 1 * 1 * 25, but we need four distinct integers since they are ordered a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d. So they can&#39;t repeat. So 1, 1, 1, 25 is out because they repeat. Similarly, 5 * 5 * 1 * 1, but again duplicates. So maybe negative numbers? For example, (-1) * (-5) * 1 * 5. Let&#39;s check: (-1)*(-5) = 5, then 5*1=5, 5*5=25. So that works. Let&#39;s see if that gives us four distinct integers: -5, -1, 1, 5. Wait, but in the product, it&#39;s (-1)*(-5)*1*5=25. But ordered from largest to smallest: 5, 1, -1, -5. So a=5, b=1, c=-1, d=-5. Then |a + b| + |c + d| would be |5 + 1| + |-1 + (-5)| = |6| + |-6| = 6 + 6 = 12. Hmm, 12 is option D. But wait, let&#39;s check if that&#39;s the only possibility.Alternatively, maybe another set of integers. Let&#39;s think. 25 can also be written as (-1) * (-1) * (-5) * 5. But that would give duplicates again: (-1) appears twice, (-5) and 5. So a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d would require all distinct numbers. So duplicates are not allowed. So maybe another combination.Wait, let&#39;s see. What are the factors of 25? The prime factors are 5 and 5. But since we need integers, we can include 1 and -1 as well. So possible factors are 1, -1, 5, -5, 25, -25. But since we have four numbers, maybe using 25 or -25. Let&#39;s try.If we use 25, then we need three other numbers whose product is 25 / 25 = 1. So 1, 1, 1. But again duplicates. So that&#39;s not possible. If we use -25, then the product would be -25 * other three numbers = 25, so the other three numbers need to multiply to -1. So the other three numbers would be -1, 1, and 1, but duplicates again. So that&#39;s not allowed.Alternatively, maybe 5, -5, 1, -1. Let&#39;s check: 5 * (-5) * 1 * (-1) = (5*-5) = -25, then *1 = -25, * (-1) = 25. So yes, that works. Then ordering these numbers: 5, 1, -1, -5. So a=5, b=1, c=-1, d=-5. Then |5 + 1| + |-1 + (-5)| = |6| + |-6| = 6 + 6 = 12. So same as before.Is there another possible combination? Let&#39;s see. What if we use 25, but then need three other numbers. But as before, 25 is too big. Let&#39;s see, maybe 5, 5, 1, 1. But duplicates. So not allowed.Alternatively, maybe 5, -1, -1, -5. But duplicates again. So that&#39;s no good. Hmmm.Alternatively, 25, -1, -1, -1. But duplicates again and product is 25*(-1)^3 = -25, which is not 25.Wait, so maybe the only possible set of distinct integers that multiply to 25 is 5, 1, -1, -5. Let me check.Yes, because if we take 5, 1, -1, -5, they are distinct, multiply to 25 (5*1*(-1)*(-5) = 25), and ordered as 5 &gt; 1 &gt; -1 &gt; -5. So that works. Any other combinations? Let&#39;s see. Maybe 25, but as mentioned, that would require duplicates. Similarly, 10 is not a factor of 25. So 25 is 5 squared, so factors are limited to ±1, ±5, ±25.So perhaps the only possible distinct integers are 5,1,-1,-5. Therefore, the value of |a + b| + |c + d| is 6 + 6 = 12, which is option D. But let me check again.Wait, let&#39;s confirm. a = 5, b =1, c = -1, d = -5. Then a + b = 5 + 1 = 6, so absolute value is 6. c + d = -1 + (-5) = -6, absolute value is 6. So 6 + 6 = 12. Correct.Is there any other possible combination? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s check another possible set. Suppose we have two positive and two negative numbers. For example, 5, -5, 1, -1. But that&#39;s the same as above. Alternatively, 25 is too big. If we take, for example, 25, 1, -1, -1, but duplicates again. Alternatively, 5, 5, -1, -1, duplicates again.Alternatively, 5, 1, -5, -1. But that&#39;s the same as the previous set, just ordered differently. Since they need to be ordered a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, which is 5 &gt;1 &gt; -1 &gt; -5. So that&#39;s the only possible arrangement. So no other possibilities. Hence, the answer must be 12, which is D. So I think the answer is D:12.But wait, let me check once more. Let&#39;s verify if there are other factor combinations. For four integers with distinct values, product 25. Since 25 has prime factors 5 and 5. So possible factorizations into four distinct integers:Since 25 = 5 * 5 * 1 * 1, but duplicates.Or 25 = 5 * (-5) * (-1) * 1. That&#39;s distinct: 5, -5, -1, 1. Then ordered as 5 &gt;1 &gt; -1 &gt; -5. Then a=5, b=1, c=-1, d=-5. So same as before. So the same result.Alternatively, 25 = 25 * 1 * 1 * 1, but duplicates. So not allowed. So no other factorizations with distinct integers. So yes, the only possible arrangement is 5,1,-1,-5, which gives 12. So the answer is D.But let me check the options again. The options are A:0, B:10, C:2, D:12. So D is 12. Therefore, the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given integers (a), (b), (c), and (d) satisfy (abcd = 25) and (a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d), we need to find (|a + b| + |c + d|).First, we consider the factors of 25. Since 25 is a positive number, the product of four integers can be positive if there are an even number of negative factors. The factors of 25 are (pm 1), (pm 5), and (pm 25). However, since we need four distinct integers, we consider the set (5, 1, -1, -5).Checking the product:[5 times 1 times (-1) times (-5) = 25]Arranging these integers in descending order (a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d) gives:[a = 5, quad b = 1, quad c = -1, quad d = -5]Calculating (|a + b| + |c + d|):[|5 + 1| + |-1 + (-5)| = |6| + |-6| = 6 + 6 = 12]Thus, the final answer is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So we have four integers a, b, c, d such that their product abcd is 25. Also, they are in decreasing order: a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d. We need to find the value of |a + b| + |c + d| and choose the correct option from A to D.First, let&#39;s recall that 25 is a positive number, and the product of four integers is positive. Now, since all four numbers multiply to a positive number, there must be an even number of negative factors. That means either all four are positive, two are negative, or none are negative. But wait, actually, 25 is positive, so the number of negative integers must be even: 0, 2, or 4. However, since they are ordered a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, if all four were positive, they would be decreasing positive integers. If two are negative, then the larger two (a and b) might be positive, and the smaller two (c and d) negative. If all four were negative, they would be increasing in absolute value but decreasing in actual value since negatives get &quot;smaller&quot; as their absolute value increases. Let&#39;s check each possibility.First, let&#39;s consider all four integers being positive. Then, since they are distinct positive integers in decreasing order, their product is 25. But 25 factors into 1, 5, 5, 1 or 25, 1, 1, 1, but since they need to be distinct integers (because a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d), we need four distinct positive integers. Wait, but 25 is 5 squared. The factors of 25 are 1, 5, 25. So unless we use 1s and 5s, but with distinct integers, we can&#39;t have four different positive integers. For example, 5, 1, -1, -5 would multiply to 25, but those include negatives. If we stick to positive integers, the possible factors are 1, 5, 25. But we need four distinct integers. So 25, 1, but then we can&#39;t get four numbers. Therefore, maybe all four positive integers isn&#39;t possible because we can&#39;t have four distinct positive integers whose product is 25. So that scenario is out.Next, let&#39;s consider two negative numbers and two positive numbers. Since a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, the two largest numbers, a and b, would be positive, and c and d would be negative. Because if there are two negatives, they have to be the smaller numbers. Let&#39;s test this possibility.So, a and b are positive, c and d are negative. The product abcd is positive because two negatives make a positive, and two positives make a positive, so overall positive. So that works. Now, let&#39;s think about the possible factors. Since 25 is 5^2, but we have four integers. Let me list all possible integer factors of 25, considering both positive and negative:Possible factors (including negative): 1, -1, 5, -5, 25, -25.We need four distinct integers, two positive and two negative, such that their product is 25. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s consider the positive factors first: 1, 5, 25. The negative factors: -1, -5, -25.We need two positive and two negative numbers. Let&#39;s try combinations. Since 25 is 5x5, but maybe split into different factors.For example, if we take 25, 1, -1, -1. But those aren&#39;t distinct. Or 5, 5, -1, -1. Again duplicates. Wait, since 25 is 5^2, maybe we need to have factors that multiply to 25. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s think of possible quadruples (a, b, c, d):Suppose a = 5, b = 1, c = -1, d = -5. Let&#39;s check the product: 5 * 1 * (-1) * (-5) = 5 * 1 * 5 = 25. Yes, that works. Also, check the ordering: 5 &gt; 1 &gt; -1 &gt; -5. Correct. So that is one possibility.Another possibility: a = 25, b = 1, c = -1, d = -1. But here, c and d are both -1, which violates the distinctness. Similarly, 5, 5, -1, -1 is invalid. So maybe the only possible combination is 5, 1, -1, -5. Let&#39;s check if there are others.Another option: a = 5, b = -1, c = -5, d = -25. Wait, but then a &gt; b would be 5 &gt; -1, which is okay, but then b = -1 &gt; c = -5, which is true, and c = -5 &gt; d = -25, which is also true. The product is 5 * (-1) * (-5) * (-25). Let&#39;s compute that: 5 * (-1) = -5; -5 * (-5) = 25; 25 * (-25) = -625. That&#39;s not 25. So that&#39;s invalid.Alternatively, maybe a = 25, b = 5, c = -1, d = -1. Again, duplicates. Not allowed. So maybe the only possible combination is 5, 1, -1, -5.Wait, what about a = 1, but then a can&#39;t be 1 if it&#39;s the largest. Since a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, a has to be the largest. If we take 5 as the largest, then that works. If we tried 25 as the largest, let&#39;s see: a =25, then we need three other distinct integers such that 25 * b * c * d =25, so b * c * d =1. Since they are integers, distinct, and b &gt; c &gt; d. The factors of 1 are 1 and -1. But with three distinct integers multiplying to 1, impossible. Because the possible integer factors are 1, -1. So you can&#39;t have three distinct integers multiplying to 1. Hence, a can&#39;t be 25. So the only possible positive a is 5.Thus, the four integers are 5, 1, -1, -5. Let&#39;s verify:a =5, b=1, c=-1, d=-5. Product: 5*1*(-1)*(-5) = 5*1*5=25. Correct. Order: 5&gt;1&gt;-1&gt;-5. Correct. All distinct. Great.So that seems to be the only possible combination with two positive and two negative numbers.Another possibility: four negative numbers. Let&#39;s check that. If all four numbers are negative, then their product is positive (since four negatives multiply to positive). So maybe a, b, c, d are all negative. Since they are ordered a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d, meaning that a is the &quot;largest&quot; negative number (closest to zero), and d is the smallest (most negative). For example, let&#39;s see if such numbers exist.The factors would have to be negative numbers whose product is 25. Since 25 is 5^2, so factors could be -1, -1, -5, -5. But duplicates again. Not allowed. Alternatively, -1, -5, -25, and 1? Wait, no, all four have to be negative. So if all four are negative and distinct, possible factors are -1, -5, -25. But we need four distinct factors, but we only have three. So this is impossible. Hence, four negative numbers is not possible because we can&#39;t have four distinct negative integers multiplying to 25. So that scenario is out.Therefore, the only possible set is 5, 1, -1, -5. So now, compute |a + b| + |c + d|.Let&#39;s compute a + b =5 +1=6. c + d = -1 + (-5)= -6. Then |6| + |-6|=6 +6=12. So the answer is 12, which is option D.Wait, but let me check again if there are other possible combinations. Suppose there&#39;s another set of numbers. For example, 25, but as I saw earlier, a=25 requires b*c*d=1, which isn&#39;t possible with distinct integers. What about a= -1? But then all numbers would be negative, which we saw is impossible. Or maybe a=5, b= -1, c= -5, d=1? Wait, but then d=1, which is greater than c=-5, but the ordering would be a=5, b=-1, which would mean 5 &gt; -1 &gt; -5 &gt;1? No, that doesn&#39;t make sense because 1 is greater than -5. So the order would be messed up. So no, that&#39;s not possible.Alternatively, could there be another combination with a=5, b=1, c=-5, d=-1? But then c=-5 is less than d=-1, so the order would be a=5 &gt; b=1 &gt; c=-1 &gt; d=-5. Wait, no. If you have c=-5 and d=-1, then c=-5 is less than d=-1, so the order would have to be a=5 &gt; b=1 &gt; d=-1 &gt; c=-5, which contradicts c &gt; d. So that&#39;s invalid. Therefore, the only possible ordering is 5, 1, -1, -5.Hence, |5 + 1| + |-1 + (-5)| = |6| + |-6| = 6 + 6 = 12. So the answer is D:12.But wait, the options given are A:0, B:10, C:2, D:12. So D is 12, which we arrived at. Let me check once more to ensure there are no other possible factor combinations.Suppose we have numbers like 25, but as discussed, 25 can&#39;t be part of the numbers because we can&#39;t get three other distinct integers. What about a=5, b= -5, but then b would be -5, which is less than a=5, but then c and d would need to be less than -5. Let&#39;s try: a=5, b=-5, then c and d have to be less than -5. Then the product would be 5 * (-5) * c * d = 25. So (-25) * c * d =25. Hence, c*d= -1. So c and d are integers less than -5, but their product is -1. The only integers multiplying to -1 are 1 and -1. But 1 is greater than -1, and both are greater than -5. So impossible because c and d have to be less than -5. Hence, this is invalid.Another try: a=10, but 10 isn&#39;t a factor of 25. Not possible. Similarly, other numbers like 2, 3, 4 aren&#39;t factors of 25. So the only factors are 1,5,25 and their negatives. So indeed, the only possible combination is 5,1,-1,-5. Therefore, the answer is D:12.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given integers (a), (b), (c), and (d) satisfy (abcd = 25) and (a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d), we need to find the value of (|a + b| + |c + d|).First, we note that the product (abcd = 25) is positive, so there must be an even number of negative integers. Since (a), (b), (c), and (d) are distinct and ordered (a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d), the only feasible combination is two positive and two negative integers. Considering the factors of 25, the possible distinct integers are 1, 5, -1, and -5. The valid order is (5 &gt; 1 &gt; -1 &gt; -5) because:- Their product is (5 times 1 times (-1) times (-5) = 25).- The order satisfies (a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d).Calculating (|a + b| + |c + d|):- (a + b = 5 + 1 = 6), so (|a + b| = |6| = 6).- (c + d = -1 + (-5) = -6), so (|c + d| = |-6| = 6).Thus, (|a + b| + |c + d| = 6 + 6 = 12).The final answer is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf77425d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf77425d><span class="icon" data-v-cf77425d>🔑:</span>25 = 5 times 5 times 1 times 1 = 5 times (-5) times 1 times (-1),  thus a=5, b=1, c=-1, d=-5,  therefore |a+b|+|c+d|=|5+1|+|-1-5|  = 6 + 6 = 12.

So, the question is: From the numbers 1 to 16, if we randomly select n numbers, there must be at least two numbers where one is three times the other. We need to find the smallest such n. Hmm, sounds like a pigeonhole principle problem maybe?First, let me understand what&#39;s being asked. We need the smallest number n such that any selection of n numbers from 1 to 16 will necessarily include at least one pair where one number is three times the other. So, we need to ensure that no matter which n numbers you pick, you can&#39;t avoid having such a pair. Therefore, the minimal n is one more than the maximum number of numbers you can pick without having any such pairs. That makes sense.So, the approach here would be to figure out the largest possible set of numbers from 1 to 16 that doesn&#39;t contain any pair where one is three times the other. Then, the minimal n would be that size plus one. That&#39;s the classic pigeonhole principle approach.Alright, so I need to construct such a set. Let&#39;s think about how numbers in 1 to 16 can relate as triples. That is, numbers where one is three times another. Let&#39;s list out all such pairs first.Starting from the smallest number:1 and 3 (since 1*3=3)3 and 9 (3*3=9)9 and 27 (but 27 is outside our range)Similarly, 2 and 6 (2*3=6)6 and 18 (18 is out)4 and 12 (4*3=12)12 and 36 (out)5 and 15 (5*3=15)15 and 45 (out)7 and 21 (out)8 and 24 (out)10 and 30 (out)Etc. So, the pairs within 1-16 where one is three times the other are:(1,3), (3,9), (2,6), (6,18), (4,12), (5,15). But 6,18: 18 is out. So actually, within 1-16, the valid pairs are:(1,3), (3,9), (2,6), (4,12), (5,15). Additionally, if we check numbers like 7, 8, 10, 11, etc., multiplying by 3 takes them beyond 16. So those are the only pairs.Wait, let me confirm:1*3=3, 3*3=9, 9*3=27 (too big)2*3=6, 6*3=18 (too big)4*3=12, 12*3=36 (too big)5*3=15, 15*3=45 (too big)7*3=21, etc., all beyond 16.So, the pairs where both numbers are within 1-16 are:1-3, 3-9, 2-6, 4-12, 5-15. So each of these is a pair where one is three times the other.So, we need to avoid selecting both numbers from any of these pairs. So, the problem reduces to selecting numbers such that from each of these pairs, we pick at most one number.But also, some numbers are part of chains. For example, 1 is part of 1-3-9. So if we pick 1, we can&#39;t pick 3 or 9. If we pick 3, we can&#39;t pick 1 or 9. If we pick 9, we can&#39;t pick 3 or 1. So, in such a chain, we can only pick one number from each such chain.Similarly, 2-6 is a two-element chain (since 6*3=18 is out). 4-12 is a two-element chain. 5-15 is another two-element chain. The rest of the numbers (7,8,10,11,13,14,16) don&#39;t form any such pairs because tripling them would exceed 16. So, those can be included freely without conflict.So, the strategy is to figure out the maximum number of elements we can pick by choosing one from each conflicting pair or chain, plus all the non-conflicting numbers.So, first, let&#39;s list all the conflicting chains:1. Chain 1-3-9: length 32. Chain 2-6: length 23. Chain 4-12: length 24. Chain 5-15: length 25. Non-conflicting numbers: 7,8,10,11,13,14,16 (7 numbers)In each chain, to maximize the number of elements picked, we should take the maximum independent set. For each chain, the maximum number of elements we can pick without having a pair where one is three times the other is the ceiling of the chain length divided by 2? Wait, no. Wait, in a chain like 1-3-9, which is three elements where each is triple the previous, we can pick at most one element from this chain. Because if you pick two elements, they would be in the ratio of 3:1 or 9:3, which is still 3:1. Similarly, in a two-element chain like 2-6, you can pick at most one element.Therefore, for each chain, regardless of length, you can pick at most one element. So, chains:1. 1-3-9: pick 12. 2-6: pick 2 or 63. 4-12: pick 4 or 124. 5-15: pick 5 or 15But actually, to maximize the number of elements, maybe you can pick more from longer chains if possible? Wait, but in the chain 1-3-9, if you pick 1, you exclude 3 and 9. If you pick 3, you exclude 1 and 9. If you pick 9, you exclude 1 and 3. So regardless, you can only pick one from the three-element chain. Similarly, from a two-element chain, you can only pick one. So each chain contributes 1 element to the maximum set, regardless of the chain&#39;s length. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.Wait, in a two-element chain, like 2-6: if you pick either 2 or 6, you exclude the other. So, maximum one element. Similarly, for the three-element chain 1-3-9: maximum one element. Therefore, regardless of the chain length (whether 2 or 3), each chain can contribute at most one element.Therefore, the number of elements we can pick from the conflicting chains is equal to the number of chains. Let&#39;s see:How many chains do we have? Let&#39;s list them again:1. 1-3-9 (length 3)2. 2-6 (length 2)3. 4-12 (length 2)4. 5-15 (length 2)So, that&#39;s four chains. Therefore, from these four chains, we can pick one number from each, so 4 numbers. Then, we can add all the non-conflicting numbers, which are 7,8,10,11,13,14,16. That&#39;s seven numbers. So total is 4 + 7 = 11 numbers.Wait, but let me verify. If we pick one number from each chain, and then all the non-conflicting numbers, that would be 4 + 7 = 11. So the maximum size of a set with no threefold pairs is 11. Therefore, the minimal n where any n numbers must contain such a pair is 12. Is that correct?Wait, but let me check if there isn&#39;t a way to pick more numbers from the chains. For example, maybe if you pick numbers that are not in the same chain. Wait, but the chains are separate. The chains are 1-3-9, 2-6, 4-12, 5-15. These chains don&#39;t overlap. So, each chain is independent. So, if you pick one from each chain, you don&#39;t interfere with the others.So, yes, maximum of one per chain. So, 4 elements from the chains, 7 from the non-conflicting, totaling 11. Therefore, n=12 is the minimal number where any selection of 12 numbers must include at least one pair where one is three times the other.But let me check with an example. Let&#39;s try to build a set of 11 numbers with no threefold pairs.For example:From chain 1-3-9: pick 1.From chain 2-6: pick 2.From chain 4-12: pick 4.From chain 5-15: pick 5.Then, add all non-conflicting numbers: 7,8,10,11,13,14,16.So the set is {1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16} which has 11 numbers. Let&#39;s check if any pair has one three times the other.1: 1*3=3, not in the set. 2*3=6, not in. 4*3=12, not in. 5*3=15, not in. 7*3=21, out of range. Similarly, all others when tripled are out of range. So, yes, this set has no pairs where one is three times the other.Alternatively, if we had picked different numbers from the chains. For example, from chain 1-3-9: pick 9 instead of 1. Then 9 is in the set, but 3 and 1 are excluded. But since we&#39;re only picking one from that chain, the rest is same.Similarly, from 2-6: pick 6 instead of 2, so set becomes {6,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16,9} (but wait, 9 is from the first chain). But let&#39;s see: 6*3=18, which is not in. 4*3=12, not in. 5*3=15, not in. 9*3=27, not in. So that&#39;s okay.Alternatively, pick 3 from the first chain. Then you can&#39;t have 1 or 9. So the set would be {3,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16}, which is 11 numbers. Check for triples: 3*3=9, not in. Others same as before. So that works.So regardless of which number we pick from each chain, the total is 11. So, 11 numbers can be selected without any threefold pairs. Therefore, 12 must contain at least one. So the minimal n is 12.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s a different way to pick more numbers. Suppose in a chain, maybe you can pick more numbers if they don&#39;t form a triple? Wait, in the three-element chain 1-3-9, if you pick 1 and 9, then 9 is three times 3, but 3 isn&#39;t in the set. Wait, but 9 is three times 3, but if 3 isn&#39;t in the set, is 9 allowed? Wait, if you pick both 1 and 9, then 9 is not three times 1 (it&#39;s nine times), so that&#39;s allowed. Wait, but 9 is three times 3, which is not in the set. So if you pick 1 and 9, you have two numbers from the chain, but since they aren&#39;t directly three times each other, is that allowed?Wait, hold on. The problem states that there must be two numbers such that one is three times the other. So, if we pick 1 and 9, since 9 is 3 times 3, but 3 isn&#39;t in the set. 1 and 9: 9 is 9 times 1, which is not three times. So, that&#39;s okay. Wait, but 9 is three times 3, but since 3 isn&#39;t selected, that doesn&#39;t matter. So, maybe we can pick multiple numbers from a chain as long as no two are in a 3x ratio.Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Maybe in the chain 1-3-9, we can pick two numbers as long as they aren&#39;t consecutive in the multiplication by 3. For example, picking 1 and 9: 1 and 9 are separated by two multiplications by 3 (1*3=3, 3*3=9). So, they are not directly in a 3x ratio. Therefore, they can coexist. Similarly, in the chain 2-6, if you pick both 2 and 6, that&#39;s bad because 6 is 3 times 2. But if you pick 2 and 18, that&#39;s okay if 18 is in the range. But 18 is outside.Wait, so in the chain 1-3-9, can we pick both 1 and 9? Let&#39;s see. If 1 is in the set and 9 is in the set, is there a pair where one is three times the other? 1 and 3: 3 isn&#39;t in the set. 3 and 9: 3 isn&#39;t in the set. 1 and 9: 9 is 9 times 1, not 3 times. So, no, there is no such pair. Therefore, in the chain 1-3-9, we can pick both 1 and 9, as long as we don&#39;t pick 3.Wait, this changes things. So my previous reasoning was incorrect. So in a chain of three elements, you can actually pick two numbers as long as they are not adjacent in the multiplication by 3 sequence.Similarly, in a two-element chain, like 2-6, you can only pick one, because if you pick both, they are in a direct 3x ratio.Therefore, for the three-element chain 1-3-9, the maximum number of elements you can pick without having a 3x pair is 2: for example, 1 and 9. Similarly, if you pick 1 and 3, that&#39;s a 3x pair (3 is 3x1), so that&#39;s invalid. If you pick 3 and 9, 9 is 3x3, which is invalid. But 1 and 9 are okay.Similarly, in a two-element chain, you can only pick one. So, this changes the calculation. So, let me recast the chains:For chain 1-3-9:Possible selections without 3x pair: {1,9}, {1}, {3}, {9}. So the maximum is 2.For chain 2-6:Possible selections: {2}, {6}. Maximum 1.Similarly for chains 4-12 and 5-15: maximum 1 each.So, for the three-element chain, you can pick 2 numbers. For two-element chains, 1 each. Then, the non-conflicting numbers: 7 numbers.So, total maximum numbers without any 3x pair:2 (from 1-3-9) + 1 (from 2-6) + 1 (from 4-12) + 1 (from 5-15) + 7 (non-conflicting) = 12.Wait, so then the maximum is 12. Therefore, the minimal n is 13.But this contradicts the previous reasoning. So, which one is correct?Wait, let&#39;s test with an example. Let&#39;s try to build a set with 12 numbers that doesn&#39;t have any 3x pairs.From chain 1-3-9: pick 1 and 9.From chain 2-6: pick 2.From chain 4-12: pick 4.From chain 5-15: pick 5.Non-conflicting numbers: 7,8,10,11,13,14,16 (7 numbers).So, total numbers: 2 +1 +1 +1 +7 =12.Check if there&#39;s any pair where one is three times the other.In the set: 1,9,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16.Check 1: 1*3=3 not in set. 9/3=3 not in set. 2*3=6 not in set. 4*3=12 not in set. 5*3=15 not in set. 7*3=21 not in set. Similarly, none of the others have triples in the set. So this set of 12 numbers has no such pairs. Therefore, the maximum is 12, so the minimal n is 13.But previously, I thought that in the chain 1-3-9, you could only pick one number, leading to a maximum set size of 11. But this example shows that actually you can pick two numbers from that chain, as long as they are not in a 3x ratio.Therefore, my initial reasoning was flawed because I didn&#39;t consider that in a three-element chain, you can pick two numbers as long as they are not adjacent in the 3x sequence.Therefore, the correct maximum number is 12, hence the minimal n is 13.Wait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I assumed that in each chain, regardless of length, you can pick only one number. But actually, in a three-element chain, you can pick two numbers if they are not directly in a 3x ratio.So, the key is that in a chain like 1-3-9, the forbidden pairs are (1,3) and (3,9). So, you can pick 1 and 9 as they are not adjacent in the multiplication chain. Therefore, the maximum independent set in this chain is 2. For two-element chains like 2-6, the forbidden pair is (2,6), so maximum independent set is 1.Therefore, recalculating:Chain 1-3-9: maximum 2.Chains 2-6, 4-12, 5-15: maximum 1 each.Non-conflicting numbers:7.Total: 2 +1+1+1 +7=12.Therefore, the maximum size is 12, hence n=13.But let me verify once more. Suppose someone picks 12 numbers. For example:1,9 from the first chain.2,6: wait, but if you pick 2 and 6, then 6 is 3 times 2, which is forbidden. So in the two-element chains, you can only pick one. So, if you pick 2, you can&#39;t pick 6, and vice versa.So, in our example, we picked 2,4,5 from the two-element chains (one from each). So, that&#39;s correct.Another example: instead of picking 2,4,5, could we pick 6,12,15?If we pick 6 from 2-6, 12 from 4-12, 15 from 5-15. Then, 6*3=18 not in set, 12*3=36 not in set, 15*3=45 not in set. So that&#39;s okay. Then from the first chain, pick 1 and 9. Then non-conflicting numbers: 7,8,10,11,13,14,16. So the set is {1,9,6,12,15,7,8,10,11,13,14,16}, which is 12 numbers. Checking for triples: 1 and 3 (3 not in set), 6 and 2 (2 not in set), 12 and 4 (4 not in set), 15 and 5 (5 not in set). So, all good. Therefore, another valid set of 12 numbers.So, indeed, 12 is possible. Therefore, the minimal n is 13.Therefore, the previous answer of 12 was wrong because of not considering that in a three-element chain, you can pick two numbers. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.But wait, let&#39;s check if even more numbers can be added. For example, what about numbers like 7,8,10, etc. Are they entirely safe? Yes, because multiplying them by 3 goes beyond 16. So, they don&#39;t interfere with anything.Therefore, the maximum is indeed 12, so the minimal n is 13.But let me check the original problem statement again. It says &quot;From the sixteen natural numbers 1,2,3,...,15,16, if n numbers are randomly selected, there must be two numbers such that one is three times the other. The smallest n is...&quot;So, according to our analysis, the answer should be 13. However, I need to make sure that there is no possible way to pick 13 numbers without having such a pair.Suppose someone tries to pick 13 numbers. Since the maximum set without any such pairs is 12, by definition, any set of 13 numbers must include at least one pair where one is three times the other. Hence, 13 is the minimal n.Therefore, the answer is 13. But let me check some references or similar problems to confirm.Wait, actually, this problem resembles the concept of avoiding geometric progressions. In particular, avoiding a triplet with a ratio of 3. But in this case, we only need to avoid pairs where one is three times the other. So, it&#39;s a similar concept but with pairs instead of triplets.In such problems, the usual method is to partition the set into chains where each chain is of the form {x, 3x, 9x, ...} as long as they are within the range. Then, the maximum set without such pairs is the sum of the ceilings of the chain lengths divided by 2. Wait, but here, since we are only considering pairs where one is three times the other, not necessarily longer progressions, maybe the approach is different.But in our case, for each chain, the maximum independent set (i.e., the largest subset with no two elements in the 3x ratio) can be calculated.For a chain of length 1 (numbers not in any chain), you can include them all.For a chain of length 2 (like 2-6), the maximum independent set is 1.For a chain of length 3 (like 1-3-9), the maximum independent set is 2. Because you can pick 1 and 9.Similarly, chains of longer lengths would have higher maximum independent sets, but in our case, the longest chain is 3.Therefore, the calculation as above gives 2 (from 1-3-9) +1 (2-6) +1 (4-12) +1 (5-15) +7 (others) =12.Therefore, the minimal n is 13.But let me check another source or example. For example, if we consider the numbers from 1 to 16:Chains where a number is three times another:1-3-92-64-125-15Others:7,8,10,11,13,14,16.So, chains:Chain1: 1,3,9 (length 3)Chain2: 2,6 (length 2)Chain3:4,12 (length 2)Chain4:5,15 (length 2)Chain5:7 (length 1)Chain6:8 (length 1)Chain7:10 (length 1)Chain8:11 (length 1)Chain9:13 (length 1)Chain10:14 (length 1)Chain11:16 (length 1)Now, in each chain, the maximum independent set (i.e., maximum subset with no two elements where one is three times the other) is as follows:For chains of length 1: 1.For chains of length 2:1.For chains of length 3:2.Therefore, the total maximum independent set size is:Chain1:2Chain2:1Chain3:1Chain4:1Chains5-11:1 each (7 chains)Total: 2 +1+1+1 +7=12.Therefore, the answer is 13.So, this seems correct.Therefore, the smallest n is 13.But wait, let me check if I can find a different partitioning or chains. For example, is there any other pair that I missed?Let me list all possible pairs where one is three times the other in 1-16:1 and 33 and 92 and 64 and 125 and 156 and 18 (invalid)7 and 21 (invalid), etc.So, only (1,3), (3,9), (2,6), (4,12), (5,15) are the valid pairs.Therefore, the chains are correctly identified.So, yes, with maximum independent set size of 12, the minimal n is 13.Therefore, the answer is boxed{13}.Final Answerboxed{13}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the smallest number ( n ) such that any selection of ( n ) numbers from the set ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, 15, 16} ) must include at least two numbers where one is three times the other, we need to consider the structure of the set and the pairs of numbers that form a ratio of 3:1.First, we identify the pairs of numbers where one is three times the other:- ( (1, 3) ), ( (3, 9) )- ( (2, 6) )- ( (4, 12) )- ( (5, 15) )These pairs form chains where each number can be part of a chain with other numbers. The chains are:1. ( 1 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 9 )2. ( 2 rightarrow 6 )3. ( 4 rightarrow 12 )4. ( 5 rightarrow 15 )The remaining numbers ( 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 ) do not form any such pairs and can be included freely.To find the largest set of numbers that does not contain any pair where one is three times the other, we need to select numbers from each chain such that no two numbers in the selected set have a ratio of 3:1. For the chain ( 1 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 9 ), we can select at most two numbers (e.g., 1 and 9). For the chains ( 2 rightarrow 6 ), ( 4 rightarrow 12 ), and ( 5 rightarrow 15 ), we can select one number from each. The remaining numbers ( 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 ) can all be included.Thus, the maximum number of numbers we can select without any pair being in a 3:1 ratio is:- 2 from the chain ( 1 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 9 )- 1 each from the chains ( 2 rightarrow 6 ), ( 4 rightarrow 12 ), and ( 5 rightarrow 15 )- 7 from the non-conflicting numbersThis gives a total of ( 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 12 ) numbers. Therefore, the smallest ( n ) such that any selection of ( n ) numbers must include at least one pair where one is three times the other is ( 12 + 1 = 13 ).[boxed{13}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is about finding the smallest number n such that if you randomly select n numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 16}, there must be at least two numbers where one is three times the other. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It&#39;s saying that if we pick n numbers from 1 to 16, no matter which n numbers we pick, there will always be at least one pair where one number is three times the other. So our goal is to find the smallest such n. That means if we pick n-1 numbers, there might still be a way to avoid having such a pair, but once we pick n numbers, it&#39;s impossible to avoid. So this seems like a pigeonhole principle problem, where we need to divide the numbers into groups where each group doesn&#39;t contain any pair where one is three times the other. Then, the maximum number of numbers we can pick without having such a pair would be the number of such groups, and the smallest n would be one more than that.Let me recall the pigeonhole principle: if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the &quot;pigeonholes&quot; would be the groups where each group can have at most one number from each conflicting pair (i.e., pairs where one is three times the other). The &quot;pigeons&quot; would be the numbers we select. So if we can create such groups, then the maximum number of numbers we can select without having a conflicting pair is the number of groups. Therefore, n would be that maximum number plus one.So first, I need to identify all pairs of numbers in 1 to 16 where one is three times the other. Let&#39;s list those pairs.Starting from the smallest number:1 and 3 (since 1*3=3)2 and 6 (2*3=6)3 and 9 (3*3=9)4 and 12 (4*3=12)5 and 15 (5*3=15)6 and 18 (but 18 is not in the set)Similarly, 7*3=21, which is out of range, and so on. So the pairs are:(1,3), (2,6), (3,9), (4,12), (5,15). Let me check if there are any others. For example, starting from the higher numbers and dividing by 3:16 divided by 3 is about 5.333, which is not an integer. 15 is 5*3, which we already have. 14/3≈4.666, 13/3≈4.333, 12/3=4, which is already in the pair (4,12). 11/3≈3.666, 10/3≈3.333, 9/3=3, which is in (3,9). 8/3≈2.666, 7/3≈2.333, 6/3=2, which is in (2,6). 5/3≈1.666, 4/3≈1.333, 3/3=1, which is in (1,3). So yes, only those five pairs: (1,3), (2,6), (3,9), (4,12), (5,15).Wait, but let&#39;s double-check if there are any numbers that can form such pairs in both directions. For example, 3 is part of (1,3) and (3,9). Similarly, 6 is part of (2,6) and if 18 were present, but it&#39;s not. So some numbers are part of multiple pairs. So we need to be careful here because selecting such numbers might affect multiple pairs.So perhaps the key is to arrange these numbers into groups where each group can contain at most one number from each conflicting pair. So, in other words, if two numbers are in a conflicting pair (one is three times the other), they cannot be in the same group. Then, the maximum number of numbers we can choose without having any conflicting pairs would be the size of the largest possible such group, and the minimal n is one more than that.Alternatively, since each conflicting pair cannot both be in the selected set, we need to model this as a graph where each number is a node, and edges connect numbers that are in a conflicting pair. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph, and the minimal n is one more than the size of this maximum independent set.But maybe there&#39;s a simpler way. Let&#39;s try to construct such groups where each group doesn&#39;t contain any conflicting pairs. To maximize the number of numbers we can choose without having conflicts, we need to avoid selecting both numbers from any of the conflicting pairs. So perhaps, if we can partition the numbers into chains where each chain is a sequence where each number is three times the previous one, then in each chain, we can select at most every other number to avoid having consecutive numbers (which would be multiples of three). Then, the maximum independent set would be the sum of the ceiling of each chain&#39;s length divided by two or something like that.Wait, let me see. Let&#39;s list out all the chains where each number is three times the previous one.Starting from the smallest number:1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 9 -&gt; 27 (but 27 is out of range). So the chain is [1, 3, 9].Next, starting from 2: 2 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 18 (out of range). So chain [2, 6].Starting from 4: 4 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 36 (out of range). Chain [4, 12].Starting from 5: 5 -&gt; 15 -&gt; 45 (out of range). Chain [5, 15].Starting from 7: 7 -&gt; 21 (out). So single element [7].Similarly, 8: 8 -&gt; 24 (out). Single [8].10: 10 -&gt; 30 (out). Single [10].11: 11 -&gt; 33 (out). Single [11].13: 13 -&gt; 39 (out). Single [13].14: 14 -&gt; 42 (out). Single [14].16: 16 -&gt; 48 (out). Single [16].So the chains are:1-3-9, 2-6, 4-12, 5-15, and the rest are single numbers: 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16.So in each chain, to avoid having a pair where one is three times the other, we can select at most floor((length + 1)/2) numbers from each chain. Wait, let me think. For a chain of length 3, like 1-3-9: if we pick every other number, we can pick two numbers without conflict. For example, 1 and 9, or 3. Wait, if we pick 1 and 3, that&#39;s bad because 3 is three times 1. Similarly, 3 and 9 are bad. So actually, in such a chain, the maximum number of elements we can pick is the ceiling of the chain length divided by 2. Wait, no. Wait, in a chain like 1-3-9, which is three elements, how many can we pick without having any pair where one is three times the other?If we pick 1, we can&#39;t pick 3. Then, if we pick 9, we can&#39;t pick 3. So from the chain 1-3-9, the maximum is two numbers: either 1 and 9, or 3. Wait, if we pick 1 and 9, that&#39;s okay because 1 and 9 are not in a 3x relationship. 1*3=3, 3*3=9. So 1 and 9: 1*9 is 9, which is not a multiple of 3 times. Wait, 9 is 3 times 3, but 3 isn&#39;t picked. So if we pick 1 and 9, that&#39;s safe. Similarly, if we pick 3, we can&#39;t pick anything else. So the maximum in this chain is two. Wait, but if we pick two numbers, like 1 and 9, we can&#39;t pick 3. Alternatively, we could pick 3 and leave 1 and 9. So maximum two?Wait, no. Wait, 1 and 9 are in the chain, but there&#39;s no direct relationship between them except through 3. But the problem states that one number has to be three times the other. Since 9 is 3 times 3, and 3 is 3 times 1. So 9 is 9 times 1, which is not three times. So 1 and 9 can coexist. So actually, in the chain 1-3-9, the maximum number of elements we can pick without having any pair where one is three times the other is two: either 1 and 9, or 1 and something else, but 1 and 9 are the only ones not conflicting. Wait, if you pick 1 and 9, neither is three times the other. Similarly, if you pick 3 alone. So the maximum is two.Similarly, for the chain 2-6: it&#39;s two elements. The maximum number you can pick is one, since picking both would have 6 being three times 2. So from that chain, maximum one.Similarly, for 4-12: same as 2-6. Maximum one.5-15: same. Maximum one.And the single numbers: 7,8,10,11,13,14,16. Each can be picked alone, so maximum one each.Therefore, the total maximum number of elements we can pick without having any conflicting pairs is:Chain 1-3-9: 2Chain 2-6: 1Chain 4-12:1Chain 5-15:1Singles:7 numbersSo total is 2+1+1+1+7=12.Wait, so 12 numbers can be picked without having any pair where one is three times the other. Therefore, if we pick 12 numbers, it&#39;s possible that we don&#39;t have any such pair. But once we pick 13 numbers, then no matter how we pick them, there must be at least one such pair. Therefore, the minimal n is 13.But wait, let me verify this.First, let&#39;s reconstruct such a set with 12 numbers. For example:From 1-3-9: pick 1 and 9.From 2-6: pick either 2 or 6. Let&#39;s say 6.From 4-12: pick 12.From 5-15: pick 15.And all the singles:7,8,10,11,13,14,16.So the selected numbers would be:1,9,6,12,15,7,8,10,11,13,14,16. That&#39;s 12 numbers. None of these have a pair where one is three times the other. Let&#39;s check:1: tripled is 3, which is not in the set.9: tripled is 27, not in the set. Divided by 3 is 3, not in the set.6: tripled is 18, not in the set. Divided by 3 is 2, not in the set.12: tripled is 36, not in the set. Divided by 3 is 4, not in the set.15: tripled is 45, not in the set. Divided by 3 is 5, not in the set.7,8,10,11,13,14,16: none of these are triples or thirds of others. So yes, this set is safe.Alternatively, if we pick 3 instead of 1 and 9, but then we can only pick 3 and then from 2-6 pick 2, from 4-12 pick 4, from 5-15 pick 5, and the singles: that would be 3,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16. That&#39;s 11 numbers, which is less. So the first approach gives a larger set.Therefore, the maximum size of such a set is indeed 12.Therefore, the minimal n where any selection of n numbers must contain a pair where one is three times the other is 12 + 1 = 13.So the answer should be 13.But let me check another possible arrangement. Suppose instead of picking 1 and 9, we pick 3. Then we can&#39;t pick 1 or 9. So in the chain 1-3-9, picking 3 gives 1 element. Then, from 2-6, pick 2 or 6. From 4-12, pick 4 or 12. From 5-15, pick 5 or 15. Then singles. So if we pick 3, 2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16. That&#39;s 11 numbers, which is still less than 12. So the maximum is indeed 12.Therefore, the minimal n is 13.But let me think again. Is there another chain or something I missed?Wait, the chain 1-3-9: another way to pick numbers is 1, 3, or 9. But as we saw, if you pick 1 and 9, you can&#39;t pick 3. If you pick 3, you can&#39;t pick 1 or 9. So the maximum is 2. So 1 and 9.Similarly, in other two-element chains, you can pick only one. So overall, 2+1+1+1+7=12.But what about numbers that could be part of multiple chains? For example, 3 is part of 1-3-9. But once we pick 1 and 9, we can&#39;t pick 3. So there is no overlap in the chains. The chains are separate except for overlapping numbers, but since once you pick numbers from one chain, you exclude the overlapping numbers.Wait, actually, the chains are constructed such that they don&#39;t share numbers. Each number is in exactly one chain. Let&#39;s confirm that:1 is only in 1-3-9.2 is only in 2-6.3 is only in 1-3-9.4 is only in 4-12.5 is only in 5-15.6 is only in 2-6.7 is single.8 is single.9 is only in 1-3-9.10 is single.11 is single.12 is only in 4-12.13 is single.14 is single.15 is only in 5-15.16 is single.So yes, each number is in exactly one chain. Therefore, the chains are independent. Therefore, when we pick numbers from each chain, they don&#39;t interfere with each other. So the maximum number is indeed the sum of maximum picks from each chain.Therefore, the maximum is 2 (from 1-3-9) + 1 (from 2-6) +1 (from 4-12) +1 (from 5-15) +7 (singles) =12. Therefore, n=13.So the answer is boxed{13}.Final Answerboxed{13}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the smallest number ( n ) such that selecting ( n ) numbers from the set ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, 16} ) guarantees at least one pair where one number is three times the other, we can use the following reasoning:1. Identify conflicting pairs: We need to find all pairs of numbers where one is three times the other. These pairs are:   - (1, 3), (3, 9)   - (2, 6)   - (4, 12)   - (5, 15)2. Form chains: Group the numbers into chains where each number is three times the previous one:   - Chain 1: ( 1 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 9 )   - Chain 2: ( 2 rightarrow 6 )   - Chain 3: ( 4 rightarrow 12 )   - Chain 4: ( 5 rightarrow 15 )   - Single numbers: 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 163. Determine maximum independent set: For each chain, calculate the maximum number of numbers that can be selected without having a conflicting pair:   - Chain 1 (1, 3, 9): Maximum 2 numbers (e.g., 1 and 9)   - Chain 2 (2, 6): Maximum 1 number (either 2 or 6)   - Chain 3 (4, 12): Maximum 1 number (either 4 or 12)   - Chain 4 (5, 15): Maximum 1 number (either 5 or 15)   - Single numbers: All 7 can be selected4. Sum the maximums:    - Chain 1: 2   - Chain 2: 1   - Chain 3: 1   - Chain 4: 1   - Single numbers: 7   - Total: ( 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 12 )Thus, the maximum number of numbers that can be selected without any conflicting pairs is 12. Therefore, the smallest ( n ) such that any selection of ( n ) numbers must include at least one conflicting pair is ( 12 + 1 = 13 ).The final answer is (boxed{13}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf77425d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf77425d><span class="icon" data-v-cf77425d>🔑:</span>【Solution】Solution: Group the numbers with a 3-fold relationship: (1,3,9), (2,6), (4,12), (5,15), there are 4 groups in total,the remaining 7 numbers each form a group,thus, these 16 numbers can be divided into 11 groups. From the first group, you can take at most 2 numbers, i.e., 1 and 9, and from the other groups, you can take at most one number, meaning you can take up to 12 numbers to ensure that no number is three times another,at this point, if you take one more, i.e., 12+1=13 numbers, there will definitely be one number that is three times another.

It&#39;s about triangle ABC with an inscribed circle (incircle) centered at O. The line BO intersects the incircle at points M and N, and the segments AO and CO intersect the incircle at points P and Q, respectively. We need to find the ratio of the areas of triangles MNP and MQN, given angles A = α and C = γ.First, I need to recall some properties of incircles and triangles. The incenter O is the intersection of the angle bisectors of the triangle. The incircle touches each side of the triangle, and the radius can be calculated using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semiperimeter.But in this problem, we are dealing with points where the angle bisectors intersect the incircle again. That is, BO intersects the incircle at M and N (with O between them?), and AO and CO intersect the incircle at P and Q. Then we have triangles MNP and MQN whose areas we need to compare.Hmm. Let&#39;s try to visualize the triangle ABC with incenter O. The points M and N are on BO, and P is on AO, Q is on CO. So, the incircle is tangent to all three sides, and O is the center. The lines AO, BO, CO are the angle bisectors.Perhaps I can consider coordinate geometry. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Alternatively, using trigonometric relations since angles A and C are given. The ratio might depend only on angles α and γ.Wait, the problem mentions trigonometric ratios in a right triangle. Hmm. Maybe the key is to find some right triangles within the figure?Alternatively, since all points lie on the incircle, maybe we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or something related to circle theorems. But since the points are intersections of angle bisectors with the incircle, perhaps we can find lengths from O to M, N, P, Q and use coordinates or vectors.Alternatively, since O is the center of the circle, the points M and N are on BO, which is a line passing through the center. Therefore, MN is a diameter of the incircle? Wait, no. Because BO is an angle bisector, but unless the triangle is equilateral, BO is not a diameter. Wait, but the incircle&#39;s center is O, so any line through O will pass through two points on the circle (since it&#39;s a center). Therefore, BO passes through O and intersects the circle at M and N. Therefore, MN is a chord passing through O, so MN is a diameter. Wait, but if the line BO passes through O, which is the center, then the points M and N are on the circle along the line BO, so MN must be a diameter. Wait, but O is the center, so the line BO passes through O, so the two intersection points with the circle are at distance r from O. So MN is a diameter of the circle. Therefore, MN has length 2r, and O is the midpoint.Similarly, AO and CO intersect the circle at P and Q. Since AO and CO are angle bisectors passing through the center, then AP and CQ are diameters? Wait, no, because AO is an angle bisector, but in general, unless the triangle is equilateral, the angle bisectors are not diameters of the incircle. Wait, but since O is the center of the incircle, any line through O (like AO, BO, CO) will pass through the center, so their intersections with the incircle will be points at distance r from O. Therefore, AO passes through O and intersects the incircle at two points: one is the point where the incircle is tangent to side BC (but wait, the incircle is tangent to the sides, but the angle bisectors pass through the incenter and the points of tangency. Wait, actually, the points where the angle bisectors meet the incircle are different from the points of tangency. Let me think.Wait, the incenter is equidistant from all sides, so the distance from O to each side is the radius r. The points where the incircle is tangent to the sides are points at distance r from O, lying on the sides. But the angle bisectors (AO, BO, CO) pass through O, so when we extend those angle bisectors beyond O, they intersect the incircle again at points P, Q, M, N. Since the angle bisectors pass through the center, those intersection points with the incircle are diametrically opposed through O? Wait, if we have a circle centered at O, and a line passing through O, then the two intersection points with the circle are symmetric with respect to O, meaning that O is the midpoint of the segment connecting them. Therefore, for example, the line AO intersects the incircle at two points: one is in the direction towards A (but since O is inside the triangle, AO starts at A and goes through O to the other side of the circle. Wait, actually, AO is from vertex A to incenter O. So AO starts at A, passes through O, and then exits the circle at another point P. Similarly, BO starts at B, passes through O, and exits the circle at N (assuming M is between B and O, and N is the other intersection). Similarly for CO.Therefore, for each angle bisector, the segment from the vertex to O is part of the angle bisector, and beyond O, the line continues to intersect the incircle again at another point.Therefore, for AO: starting at A, goes through O, then exits the incircle at P. Similarly, BO goes from B through O to N, and CO goes from C through O to Q.Wait, but the problem states: &quot;the line BO intersects this circle at points M and N&quot;, so BO is a line that passes through the circle at M and N, and O is between them? Since O is the center, then O is the midpoint of MN, as MN is a chord passing through the center, so MN is a diameter. Similarly, AO intersects the circle at two points, but since AO passes through O, which is the center, then the two intersection points are O itself and another point? Wait, no. Wait, the line AO is passing through O, so O is on the line AO, but AO is from A to O. Wait, no: AO is the entire angle bisector from A to the incenter O. Wait, but the incenter is inside the triangle, so AO starts at A and goes to O. Then, if we extend AO beyond O, it will exit the incircle at another point P. Similarly, BO is from B to O, and if we extend BO beyond O, it will exit the incircle at another point N. So the line BO intersects the incircle at two points: one is on the segment BO (from B to O), which is M, and the other is on the extension beyond O, which is N. Similarly for AO and CO.Wait, but in the problem statement: &quot;the line BO intersects this circle at points M and N&quot;, so line BO passes through the circle at M and N. Since O is the center, then one of them is between B and O, and the other is on the other side of O. Similarly, AO intersects the circle at two points: one between A and O (but since the inradius is the distance from O to the sides, which is r, but AO is longer than r because O is inside the triangle. Wait, AO is the distance from A to O. Let me think.Wait, AO is the angle bisector from A to the incenter O. The length of AO can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a vertex to the incenter. Maybe it&#39;s better to recall that in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the incenter can be found using trigonometric formulas.Alternatively, since we know angles A and C, maybe we can express the ratio in terms of these angles.But perhaps I need to find coordinates. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.Let me place the incenter O at the origin (0, 0). Then, the incircle has equation x² + y² = r², where r is the inradius. Then, the angle bisectors AO, BO, CO pass through O.Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, C such that O is at (0, 0). However, since I don&#39;t know the specific triangle, maybe it&#39;s better to use barycentric coordinates or something else. Alternatively, use trigonometric coordinates based on angles.Alternatively, note that in triangle ABC, with angles α at A, γ at C, then angle at B is β = π - α - γ.The inradius r can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter s and the area, but maybe that&#39;s not directly helpful here.Alternatively, express the positions of points M, N, P, Q in terms of vectors from O.Since O is the center of the incircle, the points M and N lie on line BO, at distance r from O. Wait, no. The incircle has radius r, so all points on the incircle are at distance r from O. Therefore, the points M and N are on line BO, at distance r from O. Wait, but if O is the center, then the points where line BO intersects the incircle are at a distance r from O along BO. But since BO is a line passing through O, then the two intersection points are in opposite directions along BO, each at distance r from O. Wait, that can&#39;t be, because O is the center, so if you go along BO in both directions from O, the points at distance r from O would be M and N. So MN is a diameter of the incircle, lying along BO. Similarly, P and Q are points where AO and CO intersect the incircle, so they are also diametrically opposed along AO and CO, respectively.Wait, this seems important. So each of the angle bisectors (AO, BO, CO) passes through the center O of the incircle, so when extended, they intersect the incircle at two points each: one in the direction towards the vertex (A, B, C) and the other in the opposite direction. But in this problem, the line BO intersects the circle at M and N. If we consider BO as a line passing through O, then the two intersection points are at distance r from O along BO. However, since BO is an angle bisector, the points M and N are located along BO at a distance r from O, but on opposite sides. Similarly, AO intersects the incircle at P and another point, but the problem says &quot;segments AO and CO intersect the circle at points P and Q, respectively&quot;. Wait, the segments AO and CO: so if we take the segment AO (from A to O), then it intersects the incircle at point P (assuming P is between A and O) and O? But O is the center, which is inside the circle. Wait, no, the segment AO goes from A to O. Since O is inside the incircle (wait, O is the center of the incircle, so the incircle is tangent to the sides of the triangle, and O is located inside the triangle). The distance from O to each side is r, but the distance from O to each vertex is greater than r.Therefore, the segment AO starts at A and goes towards O, which is inside the incircle. Wait, but the incircle is tangent to the sides, not sure if it&#39;s near the vertices. Wait, in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, but the distance from the incenter to a vertex is different.So, if we consider the segment AO, which connects vertex A to the incenter O. Since O is inside the triangle, the segment AO passes through the incircle. Wait, but how? The incircle is tangent to side BC, but AO is an angle bisector from A to O. Depending on the triangle, the angle bisector may pass through the incircle.Wait, perhaps the segment AO passes through the incircle. So, starting at A, going along AO, it enters the incircle at some point, passes through O, and exits the incircle at another point. Wait, but O is the center, so if AO passes through O, then the segment AO passes through O, which is the center. Therefore, AO starts at A, goes through O, and continues beyond O. But the incircle is centered at O with radius r, so the points where AO intersects the incircle are at distance r from O. So, starting from O and moving towards A, the incircle is encountered at a point P which is at distance r from O along AO. Similarly, going from O in the opposite direction (away from A), the incircle is encountered at another point, say P&#39;. But in the problem statement, it says &quot;segments AO and CO intersect the circle at points P and Q, respectively&quot;. The segment AO is from A to O, so it can only intersect the incircle once (since it starts outside the circle at A, enters the circle at some point, and reaches O, which is the center). Wait, but if the segment AO is from A to O, and O is the center, then if the distance from A to O is greater than r, which it is (since O is inside the triangle and the inradius is the distance from O to the sides), then the segment AO passes through the incircle once: entering at a point P between A and O. Similarly, the line AO extended beyond O would exit the incircle at another point, but that&#39;s not part of the segment AO. Similarly for CO and Q.Therefore, the problem states: &quot;the segments AO and CO intersect the circle at points P and Q, respectively&quot;. So each segment AO and CO intersect the circle once (since they start at the vertex, go through O, which is inside the circle, so they must enter the circle at one point each: P on AO and Q on CO.Similarly, the line BO intersects the circle at points M and N. Since BO is a line, not just a segment, it passes through O (the center), so intersects the circle at two points: M and N. If we consider the line BO, which goes from B through O and extends beyond, then M and N are the two intersection points with the incircle. If we take the segment BO (from B to O), it would intersect the incircle at one point (M) between B and O, and the other point N is on the extension beyond O.Therefore, in summary:- Points M and N are on line BO, with M between B and O, and N on the opposite side of O from B.- Points P and Q are on segments AO and CO, respectively, between the vertices and O.Now, we need to find the ratio of the areas of triangles MNP and MQN.First, let&#39;s note that all points M, N, P, Q lie on the incircle. So they are all at distance r from O.To find the areas of triangles MNP and MQN, perhaps we can use coordinates. Let&#39;s try to set up a coordinate system with O at the origin. Then, the incircle has equation x² + y² = r².We can parameterize the positions of points M, N, P, Q based on the directions of BO, AO, and CO.Since O is the incenter, the lines AO, BO, CO are the angle bisectors. Let&#39;s denote the angles at A, B, C as α, β, γ, respectively, with α + β + γ = π.Given angles α and γ, angle β is π - α - γ.First, we need to find the coordinates of points M, N, P, Q.Let me consider the directions of the angle bisectors. Let&#39;s set up the coordinate system such that:- Point O is at the origin (0, 0).- Let’s align the angle bisector BO along the positive x-axis. Therefore, the line BO is the x-axis, with O at (0, 0), and B somewhere on the negative x-axis, and the line BO extends to positive x towards N and negative x towards B.Similarly, we need to position points A and C such that AO and CO are angle bisectors making angles corresponding to α and γ.Wait, perhaps using trigonometric relationships. Let me think about the angles between the angle bisectors.Since O is the incenter, the angles between the angle bisectors can be determined based on the triangle&#39;s angles.In triangle ABC, the incenter O forms three angles:- The angle at O between AO and BO is π - (α/2 + β/2).Wait, actually, the angles at the incenter can be calculated as follows: the angle between two angle bisectors is equal to π - (half the corresponding vertex angles).So, for example, the angle between AO and BO (angle at O) is π - (α/2 + β/2).Similarly, the angle between BO and CO is π - (β/2 + γ/2), and the angle between CO and AO is π - (γ/2 + α/2).But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, we can use vector coordinates with O at the origin, and represent the directions of AO, BO, CO as vectors with certain angles between them.Let me try this approach.Let’s assume that the line BO is along the positive x-axis. Then, point B is located along the negative x-axis at some distance from O, but since we are dealing with ratios of areas, the actual distances might not matter, only the angles.However, since all points M, N, P, Q lie on the incircle of radius r, which is centered at O, their coordinates can be expressed in terms of angles relative to the coordinate system.If BO is along the x-axis, then points M and N are on the x-axis, at coordinates (-r, 0) and (r, 0), but wait, if BO is the x-axis, then O is at (0,0), and the incircle has radius r. Then, the line BO (the x-axis) intersects the incircle at (r, 0) and (-r, 0). But point B is located outside the incircle, along the negative x-axis. Therefore, the segment BO goes from B (on negative x-axis) through O to N (on positive x-axis). Therefore, point M is where BO intersects the incircle between B and O, which would be at (-r, 0), and N is at (r, 0). Wait, but the distance from O to M is r, so if O is at (0,0), then M is at (-r, 0), and N is at (r, 0). But in reality, the distance from O to B is more than r, so point B is at some (-d, 0) where d &gt; r. So segment BO is from (-d, 0) to (0,0), and the incircle intersects BO at (-r, 0) (point M) and (r, 0) (point N). Wait, but if BO is the x-axis, then points M and N are at (-r, 0) and (r, 0). But if B is at (-d, 0), then the segment BO from B to O passes through M at (-r, 0). Similarly, the line BO extended beyond O passes through N at (r, 0).Similarly, points P and Q are where segments AO and CO intersect the incircle. Let&#39;s find their coordinates.To do this, we need to determine the directions of AO and CO. Since we have angle α at A and angle γ at C, the angle bisectors AO and CO will make certain angles with the x-axis (BO).Let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter&#39;s position relative to the vertices can be determined by the angle bisectors. Since we&#39;ve set BO along the x-axis, we can define the angles that AO and CO make with the x-axis.The angle between BO (x-axis) and AO is equal to the angle between BO and the angle bisector from A. Since BO is the angle bisector of angle B, which is β = π - α - γ.Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to use trigonometric relations here.Let’s denote:- The angle between AO and BO (at point O) is π - (α/2 + β/2). Similarly, the angle between BO and CO is π - (β/2 + γ/2), and the angle between CO and AO is π - (γ/2 + α/2).But given that we have set BO along the x-axis, we can denote the direction of AO as making an angle of θ with the x-axis, and CO as making an angle of φ with the x-axis, where θ and φ can be expressed in terms of α and γ.Wait, perhaps we can compute these angles.In triangle ABC, the incenter O is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. The angles at O can be calculated as follows:The angle between AO and BO is π - (α/2 + β/2), as mentioned earlier.Similarly, the angle between BO and CO is π - (β/2 + γ/2), and the angle between CO and AO is π - (γ/2 + α/2).Given that angle at A is α, angle at C is γ, so angle at B is β = π - α - γ.Therefore, the angle between AO and BO is π - (α/2 + (π - α - γ)/2) = π - [ (α + π - α - γ)/2 ] = π - [ (π - γ)/2 ] = π - π/2 + γ/2 = π/2 + γ/2.Similarly, the angle between BO and CO is π - (β/2 + γ/2) = π - [ (π - α - γ)/2 + γ/2 ] = π - [ (π - α - γ + γ)/2 ] = π - (π - α)/2 = π - π/2 + α/2 = π/2 + α/2.Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me recheck.The angle at O between AO and BO is equal to π - (angle at A)/2 - (angle at B)/2. Since angle at A is α, angle at B is β = π - α - γ. Therefore:Angle between AO and BO = π - α/2 - β/2 = π - α/2 - (π - α - γ)/2 = π - α/2 - π/2 + α/2 + γ/2 = (π - π/2) + (-α/2 + α/2) + γ/2 = π/2 + γ/2.Similarly, angle between BO and CO is π - β/2 - γ/2 = π - (π - α - γ)/2 - γ/2 = π - π/2 + α/2 + γ/2 - γ/2 = π/2 + α/2.Angle between CO and AO is π - γ/2 - α/2.Therefore, in our coordinate system where BO is along the positive x-axis, the direction of AO makes an angle of π/2 + γ/2 above the x-axis, and CO makes an angle of π/2 + α/2 below the x-axis? Wait, not sure.Wait, if we take BO as the x-axis, then the angle between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2. So, AO is at an angle of π/2 + γ/2 from the x-axis (BO). Similarly, the angle between BO and CO is π/2 + α/2, so CO is at an angle of -(π/2 + α/2) from the x-axis, assuming we take clockwise as negative.Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to draw a diagram mentally. If BO is along the positive x-axis, then point B is to the left along the x-axis, O is at the origin. The angle between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2, meaning AO is going upwards from O at an angle of π/2 + γ/2 from the x-axis. Similarly, CO is going downwards from O at an angle of π/2 + α/2 from the x-axis.Wait, but angles in a triangle can&#39;t be more than π, so π/2 + γ/2 must be less than π, which implies γ/2 &lt; π/2, so γ &lt; π, which is true.Alternatively, perhaps the angle between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2, measured from BO towards AO. If BO is along the x-axis, and the angle between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2, then AO is in the upper half-plane, making an angle of π/2 + γ/2 with the x-axis.Similarly, the angle between BO and CO is π/2 + α/2, so CO is in the lower half-plane, making an angle of π/2 + α/2 below the x-axis.Therefore, the direction of AO is θ = π/2 + γ/2 above the x-axis, and the direction of CO is φ = π/2 + α/2 below the x-axis.Thus, in coordinates, the points P and Q are located on AO and CO, respectively, at a distance r from O (since they lie on the incircle). Therefore, their coordinates can be determined using the angles θ and φ.Let&#39;s compute coordinates of points M, N, P, Q:- M and N are on BO (the x-axis). Since the incircle has radius r, and O is the origin, M is at (-r, 0) and N is at (r, 0). Wait, but earlier we thought that M is between B and O, so if B is on the negative x-axis, then M is at (-r, 0), and N is at (r, 0).- Point P is on AO. The direction of AO is angle θ = π/2 + γ/2 from the x-axis. So the coordinates of P are (r cos θ, r sin θ).Similarly, point Q is on CO. The direction of CO is angle φ = -(π/2 + α/2) from the x-axis (since it&#39;s below the x-axis). So the coordinates of Q are (r cos φ, r sin φ) = (r cos(π/2 + α/2), -r sin(π/2 + α/2)).But we can simplify these trigonometric expressions.Recall that cos(π/2 + x) = -sin x and sin(π/2 + x) = cos x.Therefore:For point P:θ = π/2 + γ/2cos θ = cos(π/2 + γ/2) = -sin(γ/2)sin θ = sin(π/2 + γ/2) = cos(γ/2)Thus, coordinates of P: (-r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))Similarly, for point Q:φ = π/2 + α/2, but measured below the x-axis, so it&#39;s equivalent to angle - (π/2 + α/2)cos φ = cos(- (π/2 + α/2)) = cos(π/2 + α/2) = -sin(α/2)sin φ = sin(- (π/2 + α/2)) = -sin(π/2 + α/2) = -cos(α/2)Therefore, coordinates of Q: (-r sin(α/2), -r cos(α/2))Wait, hold on. Let me verify.If the direction of CO is at an angle of π/2 + α/2 below the x-axis, which would be angle φ = - (π/2 + α/2).So cos φ = cos(- (π/2 + α/2)) = cos(π/2 + α/2) = -sin(α/2)sin φ = sin(- (π/2 + α/2)) = -sin(π/2 + α/2) = -cos(α/2)Therefore, coordinates of Q: ( - r sin(α/2), - r cos(α/2) )Similarly, coordinates of P: ( - r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2) )Coordinates of M: (-r, 0)Coordinates of N: (r, 0)So now we have coordinates for all four points:M: (-r, 0)N: (r, 0)P: (- r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))Q: (- r sin(α/2), - r cos(α/2))Now, we need to find the areas of triangles MNP and MQN.First, let&#39;s find the coordinates of the points:Triangle MNP: points M, N, PCoordinates:M: (-r, 0)N: (r, 0)P: (- r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))Triangle MQN: points M, Q, NCoordinates:M: (-r, 0)Q: (- r sin(α/2), - r cos(α/2))N: (r, 0)We can use the shoelace formula to compute the areas.First, compute area of triangle MNP.Coordinates:M (-r, 0)N (r, 0)P (- r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))Applying the shoelace formula:Area = 1/2 | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |Plugging in the coordinates:x1 = -r, y1 = 0x2 = r, y2 = 0x3 = -r sin(γ/2), y3 = r cos(γ/2)So,Area_MNP = 1/2 | (-r)(0 - r cos(γ/2)) + r(r cos(γ/2) - 0) + (-r sin(γ/2))(0 - 0) |Simplify each term:First term: (-r)( - r cos(γ/2)) = r² cos(γ/2)Second term: r ( r cos(γ/2) - 0 ) = r² cos(γ/2)Third term: (-r sin(γ/2))(0 - 0) = 0Thus,Area_MNP = 1/2 | r² cos(γ/2) + r² cos(γ/2) | = 1/2 | 2 r² cos(γ/2) | = r² cos(γ/2)Similarly, compute the area of triangle MQN.Coordinates:M (-r, 0)Q (- r sin(α/2), - r cos(α/2))N (r, 0)Shoelace formula:Area = 1/2 | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |Plugging in:x1 = -r, y1 = 0x2 = - r sin(α/2), y2 = - r cos(α/2)x3 = r, y3 = 0So,Area_MQN = 1/2 | (-r)( - r cos(α/2) - 0 ) + (- r sin(α/2))(0 - 0) + r(0 - (- r cos(α/2))) |Simplify each term:First term: (-r)( - r cos(α/2) ) = r² cos(α/2)Second term: (- r sin(α/2))(0 - 0) = 0Third term: r ( 0 + r cos(α/2) ) = r² cos(α/2)Thus,Area_MQN = 1/2 | r² cos(α/2) + 0 + r² cos(α/2) | = 1/2 | 2 r² cos(α/2) | = r² cos(α/2)Therefore, the ratio of the areas is Area_MNP / Area_MQN = [ r² cos(γ/2) ] / [ r² cos(α/2) ] = cos(γ/2) / cos(α/2)Therefore, the ratio is cos(γ/2) : cos(α/2), or written as cos(γ/2) / cos(α/2).But let me check if I made a mistake in the coordinates.Wait, in triangle MNP, the points are M (-r, 0), N (r, 0), P (-r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2)).When applying shoelace, the calculation gave Area_MNP = r² cos(γ/2). Similarly for MQN.But let me verify with another approach. Since triangles MNP and MQN have bases MN and MQ (or something else?), but in reality, triangle MNP has vertices M, N, P, and triangle MQN has vertices M, Q, N.Looking at triangle MNP: base MN is along the x-axis from (-r, 0) to (r, 0), so length 2r. The height is the y-coordinate of point P, which is r cos(γ/2). Therefore, area is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 2r * r cos(γ/2) = r² cos(γ/2). Which matches the previous result.Similarly, triangle MQN: points M (-r, 0), Q (-r sin(α/2), - r cos(α/2)), N (r, 0). The area can be considered as the base MN (2r) and the height is the absolute y-coordinate of point Q, which is r cos(α/2). Therefore, area is 1/2 * 2r * r cos(α/2) = r² cos(α/2). So the ratio is indeed cos(γ/2) / cos(α/2).Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles MNP and MQN is cos(γ/2) divided by cos(α/2).So the answer is boxed{dfrac{cos frac{gamma}{2}}{cos frac{alpha}{2}}}.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{cos frac{gamma}{2}}{cos frac{alpha}{2}}}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the areas of triangles (MNP) and (MQN) in triangle (ABC) with an inscribed circle centered at (O). The key steps are as follows:1. Coordinates Setup:   - Place the incenter (O) at the origin ((0, 0)).   - The incircle has radius (r) and equation (x^2 + y^2 = r^2).2. Points on the Incircle:   - Points (M) and (N) are on line (BO), which is along the x-axis. Their coordinates are ((-r, 0)) and ((r, 0)) respectively.   - Points (P) and (Q) are on segments (AO) and (CO) respectively. Using trigonometric identities, their coordinates are determined as:     - (P): ((-r sin(gamma/2), r cos(gamma/2)))     - (Q): ((-r sin(alpha/2), -r cos(alpha/2)))3. Area Calculation:   - Area of (triangle MNP):     - Using the shoelace formula or base-height method, the area is calculated as (r^2 cos(gamma/2)).   - Area of (triangle MQN):     - Similarly, the area is calculated as (r^2 cos(alpha/2)).4. Ratio of Areas:   - The ratio of the areas of (triangle MNP) and (triangle MQN) is (frac{cos(gamma/2)}{cos(alpha/2)}).Thus, the ratio of the areas of triangles (MNP) and (MQN) is (boxed{dfrac{cos frac{gamma}{2}}{cos frac{alpha}{2}}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have triangle ABC with an inscribed circle (incircle) centered at O. The line BO intersects the incircle at points M and N. Also, AO and CO intersect the incircle at points P and Q respectively. We need to find the ratio of the areas of triangles MNP and MQN, given angles A = α and C = γ.First, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC, incircle touching all three sides. The incenter O is where the angle bisectors meet. BO is one of those bisectors, intersecting the incircle at M and N—so M and N are points where BO passes through the circle. Similarly, AO and CO intersect the incircle at P and Q. So, AO meets the incircle at P (and maybe another point, but since O is the center, maybe AO is a radius? Wait, no—the inradius is the distance from O to any side, but AO is an angle bisector, not necessarily a radius. Wait, the inradius is perpendicular to the side, but AO is an angle bisector. So AO is not a radius unless the triangle is equilateral, which it isn&#39;t necessarily.Wait, the incircle is tangent to the sides, so the radius is perpendicular to each side. But the center O is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. So AO is the angle bisector of angle A, and it goes from vertex A to the incenter O. Similarly for BO and CO.But the circle is centered at O, so any line through O will pass through the center and intersect the circle at two points: one on each side of O. So, for example, BO is a line passing through O, so the points M and N are on BO, symmetric with respect to O, right? Because the circle is centered at O. So the distance from O to M is equal to the distance from O to N, but in opposite directions. Wait, but BO is a line from B to O. So O is between B and the point where? Wait, if BO is extended beyond O, then the other intersection point would be on the other side of O. So if we have BO starting at B, passing through O, and then intersecting the circle again at N, then M is the other intersection point. Wait, maybe M is between B and O, and N is on the other side of O? Hmm, but the circle is the incircle, so the radius is the distance from O to any side. But how long is BO? It depends on the triangle. Hmm.Wait, maybe since O is the incenter, BO is the angle bisector of angle B. The length of BO can be calculated using the formula for the distance from the vertex to the incenter. But maybe I don&#39;t need exact lengths. Let me think.Since the circle is centered at O with radius r (the inradius), then any point on the circle is at distance r from O. So points M and N are on BO such that OM = ON = r? Wait, no. If BO passes through O, then the points where BO intersects the circle are at distance r from O. So starting from O, moving along BO in both directions for a distance r, we reach the circle. But BO is a line from B to O. So if we go from O towards B, the distance from O to B is more than r (since the inradius is the distance from O to the sides, not to the vertices). Therefore, the point M would be between O and B, at a distance r from O. Then the other intersection point N is on the opposite side of O from B, along the line BO extended beyond O. Similarly for points P and Q on AO and CO.Wait, but AO is from A to O. So when we extend AO beyond O, we get another intersection point with the incircle. But since O is the center, AO is a line passing through the center, so it will intersect the circle at two points: one between A and O (let&#39;s say P) and one beyond O (but since AO goes from A to O, which is inside the triangle, maybe extending beyond O would go into the triangle? Wait, not necessarily. It depends on the triangle&#39;s shape. But regardless, the points P and Q would be located at a distance r from O along AO and CO.But perhaps the key here is that all these points M, N, P, Q are located at distance r from O along their respective angle bisectors. So M is on BO, at a distance r from O towards B, and N is on BO extended beyond O, at distance r from O. Similarly, P is on AO at distance r from O towards A, and Q is on CO at distance r from O towards C.Wait, but if that&#39;s the case, then the coordinates of these points can be determined if we set up a coordinate system with O at the origin. Then, the coordinates of M, N, P, Q can be expressed in terms of the directions of the angle bisectors and the radius r.But maybe there&#39;s a better way. Since all points are at distance r from O, triangles MNP and MQN are formed by connecting these points. To find the ratio of their areas, perhaps we can use coordinates or vectors, or maybe trigonometric relationships.Given that angles A and C are given as α and γ, angle B can be determined since the sum of angles in a triangle is π. So angle B = π - α - γ. Maybe we can use trigonometric ratios in the right triangles formed by the inradius and the angle bisectors.Alternatively, since all points are on the incircle, which is centered at O, the triangles MNP and MQN are triangles inscribed in the circle with radius r. Therefore, the area of a triangle inscribed in a circle can be calculated using the formula (1/2)*ab*sinθ, where a and b are sides (chords) and θ is the angle between them. But since all points are on the circle of radius r, the lengths of the sides can be determined using the central angles between the points.So, if we can find the central angles between points M, N, P, Q, then we can compute the areas of the triangles.To find the central angles, we need to know the angles between the lines BO, AO, and CO. Since O is the incenter, the angles between the angle bisectors can be related to the angles of the triangle ABC.In a triangle, the incenter&#39;s position is such that each angle bisector divides the angle into two equal parts. Therefore, the angle between BO and AO is equal to (angle B)/2 + (angle A)/2. Wait, let me think.Wait, in triangle ABC, the incenter O is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. So the angle between AO and BO would be angle at O between the two angle bisectors. Let&#39;s denote the angles at O.In general, the angles at the incenter can be calculated as follows: the angle at O between the bisectors of angles A and B is equal to π - (α/2 + β/2). Wait, let&#39;s recall that in the incenter, each angle is formed by two angle bisectors. For example, the angle between the bisectors of angles A and B at point O is equal to π - (α/2 + β/2). Because in the triangle, the sum of angles is π, so the angle at O would be the supplement of half the angles A and B.Wait, here&#39;s a formula: in any triangle, the angle at the incenter between two angle bisectors is equal to π/2 + (angle)/2, where angle is the angle of the original triangle at the vertex opposite the two angle bisectors.Wait, maybe I need to derive it.Consider triangle ABC with incenter O. The angle at O between the bisectors of angles A and B can be found as follows: since AO and BO are angle bisectors, they split angles A and B into halves. So in triangle AOB, the angles at A and B are α/2 and β/2, respectively. Therefore, the angle at O is π - α/2 - β/2. Similarly, the angle between BO and CO is π - β/2 - γ/2, and the angle between CO and AO is π - γ/2 - α/2.Therefore, the angles between the angle bisectors at O are:Angle between AO and BO: π - α/2 - β/2Angle between BO and CO: π - β/2 - γ/2Angle between CO and AO: π - γ/2 - α/2But since in our problem, we need the angles between the lines AO, BO, CO, which are the angle bisectors. Therefore, if we can express these angles in terms of α and γ (since angles A and C are given, and angle B is π - α - γ), then perhaps we can find the central angles between points M, N, P, Q.Given that points M and N are on BO, at distance r from O, and P is on AO, Q is on CO, each at distance r from O. Therefore, the coordinates of these points can be represented in polar coordinates with O as the origin, radius r, and angles determined by the directions of AO, BO, CO.Wait, maybe using coordinates is a good approach here. Let me set up a coordinate system with O at the origin. Let’s define:- The angle bisector AO is in some direction, say along the x-axis for simplicity. Then point A is somewhere along the x-axis beyond O. Similarly, angles at O between the bisectors can be determined based on α and γ.Wait, but maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, consider the vectors from O to M, N, P, Q. Since each of these points is at a distance r from O along the respective angle bisectors. So vectors OM, ON, OP, OQ have magnitude r and directions along BO, BO (opposite direction for N), AO, and CO.Therefore, the angle between vectors OM (along BO) and OP (along AO) is equal to the angle between BO and AO, which is π - α/2 - β/2 as we found earlier. Similarly, the angle between OM (BO) and OQ (CO) is the angle between BO and CO, which is π - β/2 - γ/2.But angle B is π - α - γ, so β = π - α - γ.Therefore, substituting β into the angles:Angle between AO and BO: π - α/2 - (π - α - γ)/2 = π - α/2 - π/2 + α/2 + γ/2 = π/2 + γ/2Similarly, angle between BO and CO: π - (π - α - γ)/2 - γ/2 = π - π/2 + α/2 + γ/2 - γ/2 = π/2 + α/2And angle between CO and AO: π - γ/2 - α/2So, angles at O between the bisectors:Between AO and BO: π/2 + γ/2Between BO and CO: π/2 + α/2Between CO and AO: π - (α + γ)/2But let me verify that. Let&#39;s take angle between AO and BO. Original formula was π - α/2 - β/2. Since β = π - α - γ, then:π - α/2 - (π - α - γ)/2 = π - α/2 - π/2 + α/2 + γ/2 = (π - π/2) + (-α/2 + α/2) + γ/2 = π/2 + γ/2. Yes, that&#39;s correct.Similarly, angle between BO and CO is π - β/2 - γ/2 = π - (π - α - γ)/2 - γ/2 = π - π/2 + α/2 + γ/2 - γ/2 = π/2 + α/2.Okay, so the angles between the angle bisectors at O are:- Between AO and BO: π/2 + γ/2- Between BO and CO: π/2 + α/2- Between CO and AO: π - (α + γ)/2Alright. Now, since points M, N are on BO, at distance r from O. So vectorially, OM is in the direction of BO with length r, and ON is in the opposite direction (since N is on the other side of O along BO) with length r. Similarly, OP is along AO with length r, and OQ is along CO with length r.Therefore, the coordinates of M, N, P, Q can be represented as vectors from O in the directions of BO, BO (opposite), AO, and CO, each with magnitude r.To compute the areas of triangles MNP and MQN, we can use the cross product formula for area in vectors. If we have points M, N, P, Q in terms of vectors from O, then the area of triangle MNP is (1/2) | (N - M) × (P - M) |, and similarly for MQN.But since all points are at distance r from O, perhaps there&#39;s a more straightforward trigonometric approach. Since the triangle areas can be calculated using the sine of the angles between the sides.Alternatively, since all four points lie on the circle of radius r centered at O, the triangles MNP and MQN are inscribed in this circle. The area of a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius r with central angles θ1, θ2, θ3 between the vertices can be calculated using the formula (1/2) r^2 (sin θ1 + sin θ2 + sin θ3), but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, for two sides with central angle θ between them, the area is (1/2) r^2 sin θ.Wait, actually, for two points on a circle, the length between them is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Then, if we have a triangle with three points on the circle, the area can be calculated using the formula:Area = (1/2) * ab * sin C, where a and b are two sides, and C is the angle between them.But since all sides are chords of the circle, we can express a, b, and angle C in terms of central angles.Alternatively, use the formula for the area of a triangle inscribed in a circle:If a triangle has vertices A, B, C on a circle of radius r, then the area is (1/2) r^2 (sin α + sin β + sin γ), where α, β, γ are the central angles subtended by the sides. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, using the formula for area in terms of central angles: For two points separated by central angle θ, the length is 2r sin(θ/2). Then, if we have two sides of a triangle as chords with central angles θ and φ, and the angle between them is ψ, the area is (1/2) * (2r sin(θ/2)) * (2r sin(φ/2)) * sin ψ. But ψ is the angle between the two chords, which is not necessarily related to the central angles.Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let&#39;s think in terms of vectors.Assume O is the origin. Let&#39;s assign coordinates:- Let’s take the direction of AO as the x-axis. Then, point P is along the x-axis at (r, 0). But wait, if O is the origin, and AO is a line from O towards A, but actually, in the problem, AO is from A to O. Wait, no: the incircle is tangent to the sides, so O is the incenter inside the triangle. The line AO starts at A and goes to O. But in our coordinate system, if we set O as the origin, then AO is a vector from A to O, so the direction from O to A is opposite to AO.Wait, this might be a point of confusion. Let me clarify:If we set O as the origin, then the direction from O to P is along AO. Since P is a point on AO at distance r from O, then vector OP is in the direction of AO, but since AO goes from A to O, the direction from O to P is opposite to AO. Wait, no: If AO is a line from A to O, then the direction from O to A is the same as AO. But since P is on AO between A and O, then OP is a vector from O towards A, but only of length r. Wait, but AO is a line segment from A to O. So the point P is on AO, closer to O than to A. Wait, the incircle is centered at O with radius r, so the distance from O to each side is r. But AO is an angle bisector, not necessarily perpendicular to any side. So the point P is where AO intersects the incircle. Since AO starts at A and goes to O, which is inside the triangle, the intersection points of AO with the incircle would be two: one between A and O, and the other beyond O. But since the incircle is tangent to the sides, AO passes through O, so the other intersection point is beyond O from A. But in the problem statement, it says &quot;segments AO and CO intersect the circle at points P and Q, respectively&quot;. So the segments AO and CO (i.e., the segments from A to O and from C to O) intersect the circle at P and Q. So P is on AO between A and O, and Q is on CO between C and O. So OP is a point on AO at distance r from O towards A. Wait, but if P is on segment AO, then OP would be a vector from O towards A, but since AO is from A to O, the direction from O to P is towards A? Wait, maybe I need to draw this.Wait, perhaps the points P and Q are located on the angle bisectors AO and CO, at a distance r from O. Since the incircle is centered at O with radius r, then moving from O along AO towards A, the first intersection with the incircle is at distance r from O. So P is located on AO, at distance r from O towards A. Similarly, Q is on CO, at distance r from O towards C. Similarly, M and N are on BO: M is on BO at distance r from O towards B, and N is on BO extended beyond O at distance r from O away from B.Therefore, in coordinates, with O at the origin:- Let’s define the direction of AO as some direction, say making an angle of 0 radians (along the positive x-axis). Then, point P is at (r, 0).But to define the coordinates of M, N, Q, we need to know the directions of BO and CO relative to AO.Given that angles at O between the angle bisectors are known in terms of α and γ. Earlier, we found that the angle between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2, and the angle between BO and CO is π/2 + α/2.Wait, so if AO is along the x-axis (angle 0), then BO is at an angle of π/2 + γ/2 from AO. Similarly, CO is at an angle of π/2 + γ/2 + π/2 + α/2 = π + (α + γ)/2 from AO? Wait, no. Let me think again.If AO is along the x-axis (0 angle), then the angle between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2. So the direction of BO is at angle π/2 + γ/2 from the x-axis. Then, the angle between BO and CO is π/2 + α/2, so CO is at angle π/2 + γ/2 + π/2 + α/2 = π + (γ + α)/2 from the x-axis. But angles wrap around at 2π, so π + (γ + α)/2 is equivalent to -(π - (γ + α)/2). But maybe I need to adjust.Wait, actually, if we start from AO (0 angle), then BO is at angle π/2 + γ/2. Then, from BO, we turn another angle of π/2 + α/2 to reach CO. Therefore, the total angle from AO to CO is (π/2 + γ/2) + (π/2 + α/2) = π + (α + γ)/2. Since angles are measured from the x-axis, CO is at angle π + (α + γ)/2, which is in the third quadrant. However, since in a triangle, the incenter is inside the triangle, so all angle bisectors are within the triangle, meaning that the angles between them should be less than π. Wait, perhaps my earlier conclusion about the angles at O was incorrect.Wait, let me re-examine the angle between AO and BO. If angle at O between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2, and angle between BO and CO is π/2 + α/2, then the total angle around O would be (π/2 + γ/2) + (π/2 + α/2) + angle between CO and AO. But the sum of angles around a point is 2π. Wait, but in the triangle, O is the incenter, so the angles around O are determined by the triangle&#39;s angles. Wait, maybe my initial calculation is off.Let me try again. In triangle ABC, incenter O. The angles at O between the angle bisectors:The angle between AO and BO is equal to π - (α/2 + β/2). Similarly, angle between BO and CO is π - (β/2 + γ/2), and angle between CO and AO is π - (γ/2 + α/2). Therefore, sum of these angles is 3π - (α + β + γ). But α + β + γ = π, so sum is 3π - π = 2π, which checks out.Therefore, angle between AO and BO: π - (α/2 + β/2) = π - (α/2 + (π - α - γ)/2 ) = π - ( (α + π - α - γ)/2 ) = π - ( (π - γ)/2 ) = π - π/2 + γ/2 = π/2 + γ/2, which matches earlier.Similarly, angle between BO and CO is π - (β/2 + γ/2) = π - ((π - α - γ)/2 + γ/2 ) = π - ( (π - α - γ + γ)/2 ) = π - ( (π - α)/2 ) = π - π/2 + α/2 = π/2 + α/2.Angle between CO and AO is π - (γ/2 + α/2).So, angles at O:- Between AO and BO: π/2 + γ/2- Between BO and CO: π/2 + α/2- Between CO and AO: π - (α/2 + γ/2 )Okay, so if we set up a coordinate system with O at the origin, and let’s align AO along the positive x-axis. Then, the direction of AO is 0 radians. The direction of BO is π/2 + γ/2 radians from AO, so its angle is π/2 + γ/2. The direction of CO is then π/2 + γ/2 + π/2 + α/2 = π + (α + γ)/2 radians from AO. Alternatively, since angles are measured from the x-axis, BO is at angle π/2 + γ/2, and CO is at angle π/2 + γ/2 + π/2 + α/2 = π + (α + γ)/2.But in a triangle, the incenter is inside the triangle, so the angle between CO and AO should be less than π. Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the angle between CO and AO is π - (α/2 + γ/2), which is indeed less than π, since α and γ are positive angles. So π - (α/2 + γ/2) is greater than π - π/2 = π/2, assuming α + γ &lt; π, which it is because in a triangle, α + γ &lt; π since β = π - α - γ &gt; 0.Therefore, in the coordinate system:- AO is along the positive x-axis (0 angle).- BO is at an angle of π/2 + γ/2.- CO is at an angle of π + (α + γ)/2. Wait, but π + (α + γ)/2 would be pointing in the opposite direction, but the incenter is inside the triangle, so CO should be in the upper half-plane if the triangle is oriented with A, B, C in a certain way.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the angles at O are internal angles of the triangle&#39;s incenter. Maybe using a different approach.Alternatively, consider the triangle ABC with angles α at A, γ at C, and β = π - α - γ at B. The incenter O is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors.Let me consider the positions of points M, N, P, Q:- P is on AO at distance r from O towards A.- Q is on CO at distance r from O towards C.- M is on BO at distance r from O towards B.- N is on BO extended beyond O, at distance r from O away from B.So, vectors OP, OQ, OM, ON are all of length r, in the directions of AO, CO, BO, and opposite BO, respectively.If we can express these vectors in terms of angles, then we can compute the coordinates of P, Q, M, N, and subsequently find the areas of triangles MNP and MQN.Let’s assign coordinates with O at the origin. Let’s define:- The direction of AO as the positive x-axis.- The direction of BO makes an angle of θ = π/2 + γ/2 with the x-axis.- The direction of CO makes an angle of φ = π + (α + γ)/2 with the x-axis. Wait, but angle between CO and AO is π - (α/2 + γ/2), which would place CO in the second quadrant if measured from the x-axis. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust.Wait, if the angle between AO and CO is π - (α/2 + γ/2), then if AO is along the x-axis, CO is at an angle of π - (α/2 + γ/2) from AO, but in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction?Wait, in the standard mathematical coordinate system, angles are measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. If the angle between AO and CO at O is π - (α/2 + γ/2), then CO is located at an angle of π - (α/2 + γ/2) from AO, but since AO is along the positive x-axis, this would mean CO is at an angle of π - (α/2 + γ/2) measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. But in reality, depending on the triangle&#39;s shape, CO could be in a different quadrant. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe using trigonometric relationships without coordinates.Alternatively, use complex numbers. Let’s model the points as complex numbers with O at the origin.Let’s define:- Point P is r units along AO: since AO is from A to O, the direction from O to P is opposite AO. Wait, but if we consider AO as a vector from A to O, then the direction from O to P is the same as AO. Wait, no: if P is on AO between A and O, then the vector from O to P is towards A. But since AO is from A to O, the direction from O to A is opposite to AO. Therefore, the direction from O to P is along AO towards A, which is the opposite direction of the AO vector.This is getting too tangled. Maybe it&#39;s better to assign directions based on the angles between the bisectors.Let’s proceed step by step.Assume O is the origin.Let’s define:- The angle between AO and the positive x-axis is 0 radians.- The angle between BO and AO is π/2 + γ/2, so BO is at angle π/2 + γ/2 from the x-axis.- The angle between CO and BO is π/2 + α/2, so CO is at angle π/2 + γ/2 + π/2 + α/2 = π + (γ + α)/2 from the x-axis.But this places CO in the direction of π + (γ + α)/2, which is equivalent to -(π - (γ + α)/2) if we go the other way around, but angles are typically measured from 0 to 2π.Alternatively, since the angle between CO and AO is π - (α/2 + γ/2), then if AO is along the x-axis, CO is at an angle of π - (α/2 + γ/2) measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. But in reality, in a triangle, CO would be in a different position. Wait, perhaps this is not the right approach.Let me try a different strategy. Let&#39;s use the fact that the area ratio is independent of the size of the triangle, so we can assume specific values for angles α and γ to simplify calculations. Let&#39;s choose α = γ = π/3, so angles at A and C are both 60 degrees, then angle B would be π - 2π/3 = π/3. Then the triangle is equilateral? Wait, no, if all angles are 60 degrees, the triangle is equilateral, but in that case, the incenter and centroid coincide. Let&#39;s see if this helps.In an equilateral triangle, the inradius is known, and all angle bisectors are the same. But maybe in this case, the points M, N, P, Q would form symmetrical triangles, making the area ratio 1. But the problem asks for the ratio in terms of α and γ, so this specific case might not help unless we can generalize.Alternatively, take α = γ = π/4, so angle B = π - π/2 = π/2. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at B, with angles at A and C being π/4. Then, maybe calculations are simpler.But perhaps instead of specific angles, use trigonometric identities. Since we need the ratio of areas, which may simplify nicely.Alternatively, note that triangles MNP and MQN share the common side MN. The ratio of their areas would then be the ratio of their heights from MN to P and Q, respectively. But MN is a line segment on BO, and P and Q are on AO and CO. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, use coordinates with O as the origin. Let&#39;s attempt this.Let’s place O at the origin (0,0). Let’s define:- The direction of AO is along the positive x-axis. So point P is on AO at distance r from O. Since AO goes from A to O, P is between A and O. So the coordinates of P are (r, 0), assuming AO is along the positive x-axis.- The angle between AO and BO is π/2 + γ/2. Therefore, the direction of BO is at an angle of π/2 + γ/2 from the x-axis. Therefore, the coordinates of M (on BO towards B at distance r from O) are:M: (r cos(π/2 + γ/2), r sin(π/2 + γ/2)) = (-r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))Similarly, N is on BO extended beyond O, so in the opposite direction, coordinates:N: (-r cos(π/2 + γ/2), -r sin(π/2 + γ/2)) but wait, direction is opposite. Since BO is at angle π/2 + γ/2, the opposite direction is π/2 + γ/2 + π = 3π/2 + γ/2. So coordinates of N would be:N: (r cos(3π/2 + γ/2), r sin(3π/2 + γ/2)) = (r sin(γ/2), -r cos(γ/2))Wait, let me verify:cos(3π/2 + γ/2) = cos(3π/2) cos(γ/2) - sin(3π/2) sin(γ/2) = 0 * cos(γ/2) - (-1) * sin(γ/2) = sin(γ/2)sin(3π/2 + γ/2) = sin(3π/2) cos(γ/2) + cos(3π/2) sin(γ/2) = (-1) cos(γ/2) + 0 * sin(γ/2) = -cos(γ/2)Therefore, coordinates of N are (r sin(γ/2), -r cos(γ/2))Similarly, coordinates of Q. The direction of CO is at an angle of π + (α + γ)/2 from the x-axis? Wait, earlier we had that the angle between BO and CO is π/2 + α/2. Since BO is at π/2 + γ/2, adding π/2 + α/2 gives the direction of CO as π/2 + γ/2 + π/2 + α/2 = π + (α + γ)/2. So angle of CO is π + (α + γ)/2. Therefore, coordinates of Q are:Q: (r cos(π + (α + γ)/2), r sin(π + (α + γ)/2)) = (-r cos((α + γ)/2), -r sin((α + γ)/2))Because cos(π + θ) = -cos θ, sin(π + θ) = -sin θ.Similarly, coordinates of P are (r, 0), as we set AO along the x-axis.Now, we have coordinates:P: (r, 0)M: (-r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))N: (r sin(γ/2), -r cos(γ/2))Q: (-r cos((α + γ)/2), -r sin((α + γ)/2))Now, we need to compute the areas of triangles MNP and MQN.First, let&#39;s compute the coordinates:Points for triangle MNP: M, N, PPoints for triangle MQN: M, Q, NUsing coordinates:Coordinates:M: (-r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))N: (r sin(γ/2), -r cos(γ/2))P: (r, 0)Q: (-r cos((α + γ)/2), -r sin((α + γ)/2))Compute area of triangle MNP:Using the shoelace formula:Area = (1/2) | (x_M(y_N - y_P) + x_N(y_P - y_M) + x_P(y_M - y_N)) |Plugging in:x_M = -r sin(γ/2), y_M = r cos(γ/2)x_N = r sin(γ/2), y_N = -r cos(γ/2)x_P = r, y_P = 0Compute each term:First term: x_M(y_N - y_P) = (-r sin(γ/2))(-r cos(γ/2) - 0) = (-r sin(γ/2))(-r cos(γ/2)) = r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2)Second term: x_N(y_P - y_M) = (r sin(γ/2))(0 - r cos(γ/2)) = r sin(γ/2)(-r cos(γ/2)) = -r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2)Third term: x_P(y_M - y_N) = r(r cos(γ/2) - (-r cos(γ/2))) = r(r cos(γ/2) + r cos(γ/2)) = r(2r cos(γ/2)) = 2r² cos(γ/2)Adding these terms:First term + Second term + Third term = r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2) - r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2) + 2r² cos(γ/2) = 0 + 2r² cos(γ/2)Therefore, Area of MNP = (1/2) | 2r² cos(γ/2) | = (1/2)(2r² cos(γ/2)) = r² cos(γ/2)Now compute area of triangle MQN:Points M, Q, NCoordinates:M: (-r sin(γ/2), r cos(γ/2))Q: (-r cos((α + γ)/2), -r sin((α + γ)/2))N: (r sin(γ/2), -r cos(γ/2))Applying shoelace formula:Area = (1/2) | x_M(y_Q - y_N) + x_Q(y_N - y_M) + x_N(y_M - y_Q) |Compute each term:First term: x_M(y_Q - y_N) = (-r sin(γ/2))(-r sin((α + γ)/2) - (-r cos(γ/2))) = (-r sin(γ/2))(-r sin((α + γ)/2) + r cos(γ/2)) = (-r sin(γ/2))(r [ -sin((α + γ)/2) + cos(γ/2) ]) = -r² sin(γ/2)( -sin((α + γ)/2) + cos(γ/2) )= r² sin(γ/2)( sin((α + γ)/2) - cos(γ/2) )Second term: x_Q(y_N - y_M) = (-r cos((α + γ)/2))(-r cos(γ/2) - r cos(γ/2)) = (-r cos((α + γ)/2))(-2r cos(γ/2)) = 2r² cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2)Third term: x_N(y_M - y_Q) = (r sin(γ/2))(r cos(γ/2) - (-r sin((α + γ)/2))) = r sin(γ/2)(r cos(γ/2) + r sin((α + γ)/2)) = r sin(γ/2) * r (cos(γ/2) + sin((α + γ)/2)) = r² sin(γ/2)(cos(γ/2) + sin((α + γ)/2))Adding these terms:First term + Second term + Third term =r² sin(γ/2)( sin((α + γ)/2) - cos(γ/2) ) + 2r² cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2) + r² sin(γ/2)(cos(γ/2) + sin((α + γ)/2))Let me simplify term by term:First term: r² sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2) - r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2)Second term: 2r² cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2)Third term: r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2) + r² sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2)Combine all terms:= [r² sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2) + r² sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2)] +[- r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2) + r² sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] +2r² cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2)Simplify:First bracket: 2r² sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2)Second bracket: 0Third term: 2r² cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2)Therefore, total expression:2r² sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2) + 2r² cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2)Factor out 2r²:2r² [ sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2) + cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2) ]Notice that the expression inside the brackets is cos((α + γ)/2 - γ/2) = cos(α/2), by the cosine addition formula:cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin BWait, wait. Let me check:cos((α + γ)/2 - γ/2) = cos(α/2)But the expression inside the brackets is:sin(γ/2) sin((α + γ)/2) + cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2) = cos( (α + γ)/2 - γ/2 ) = cos(α/2 )Yes! Because:cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin BLet’s let A = (α + γ)/2, B = γ/2. Then,cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B = cos((α + γ)/2) cos(γ/2) + sin((α + γ)/2) sin(γ/2)Which matches the expression. Therefore, the expression inside the brackets is cos(α/2).Therefore, total expression is 2r² cos(α/2)Thus, Area of MQN = (1/2) | 2r² cos(α/2) | = r² cos(α/2)Therefore, we have:Area of MNP = r² cos(γ/2)Area of MQN = r² cos(α/2)Therefore, the ratio of the areas is:Area MNP / Area MQN = [ r² cos(γ/2) ] / [ r² cos(α/2) ] = cos(γ/2) / cos(α/2)Hence, the ratio is cos(γ/2) : cos(α/2), or written as a fraction, cos(γ/2) / cos(α/2)Final AnswerThe ratio of the areas of triangles (MNP) and (MQN) is (boxed{dfrac{cos frac{gamma}{2}}{cos frac{alpha}{2}}}).&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we start by noting that the incenter (O) of triangle (ABC) is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The points (M) and (N) are where the line (BO) intersects the incircle, and points (P) and (Q) are where the segments (AO) and (CO) intersect the incircle, respectively. Key steps:1. Coordinates Setup: We place the incenter (O) at the origin and use trigonometric relationships to determine the coordinates of points (M), (N), (P), and (Q).2. Angles at the Incenter: The angles between the angle bisectors at (O) are calculated using the given angles (alpha) and (gamma). The angle between (AO) and (BO) is (pi/2 + gamma/2), and the angle between (BO) and (CO) is (pi/2 + alpha/2).3. Coordinates Calculation: Using the angles derived, we determine the coordinates of points (M), (N), (P), and (Q) on the incircle of radius (r).4. Area Calculation: Using the shoelace formula, we calculate the areas of triangles (MNP) and (MQN). The areas are found to be (r^2 cos(gamma/2)) and (r^2 cos(alpha/2)), respectively.The ratio of the areas of triangles (MNP) and (MQN) is:[boxed{dfrac{cos frac{gamma}{2}}{cos frac{alpha}{2}}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf77425d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf77425d><span class="icon" data-v-cf77425d>🔑:</span>Express the distance from points Q and P to the line B O in terms of the radius of the circle.## SolutionLet R be the radius of the circle, B D be the angle bisector of triangle A B C, and K and F be the projections of points P and Q onto the line B O.

There are less than 100 cells in a row, and at the beginning, only the cells at both ends contain a chess piece each. Several students take turns placing chess pieces in the cells. Each person places one piece at a time, and it must be placed in the middle of two adjacent cells that already contain pieces (for example, if the 3rd and 7th cells from left to right contain pieces, and the 4th, 5th, and 6th cells do not, a piece can be placed in the 5th cell; but if the 4th and 7th cells contain pieces, and the 5th and 6th cells do not, neither the 5th nor the 6th cell can be used). Each of these students placed 9 pieces, resulting in each cell containing exactly one piece. How many students are there? qquad</div><div class="divider" data-v-cf77425d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf77425d><span class="icon" data-v-cf77425d>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there&#39;s a row of less than 100 cells. Initially, only the two end cells have chess pieces. Students take turns placing pieces, one at a time. The rule is that each new piece must be placed in the middle of two adjacent existing pieces. For example, if there are pieces in 3rd and 7th cells, and the 4th, 5th, 6th are empty, you can place in the 5th. But if pieces are in 4th and 7th, with 5th and 6th empty, you can&#39;t place in 5th or 6th. Then, after several students each placed 9 pieces, all the cells are filled. We need to find how many students there are.First, let me make sure I understand the placement rule. The key is that a new piece can only be placed in a cell that is exactly in the middle of two existing pieces. So, if there are two pieces with one empty cell between them, you can&#39;t place there. But if there are two pieces with an odd number of empty cells between them, then the middle cell can be filled. For example, if two pieces are separated by three empty cells (positions 1 and 5), then you can fill position 3. Then, after that, maybe you can fill positions 2 and 4 if the gaps are appropriate?Wait, the example given is if 3rd and 7th cells have pieces, and 4th, 5th, 6th are empty, you can place in 5th. So between 3 and 7, there are 3 empty cells (4,5,6). The middle of 3 and 7 is 5. So after placing in 5, now you have 3 and 5, which have one empty cell between them (4), and 5 and 7, which have one empty cell between them (6). So now you can&#39;t place in 4 or 6 because they are adjacent to only one piece. Hmm, so maybe each placement splits the gap into two smaller gaps? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we start with two pieces at the ends. Let&#39;s say the row has N cells. Initially, positions 1 and N are filled. The gap between them is N-2 empty cells. To place a piece in the middle, the number of empty cells between 1 and N must be odd, right? Because the middle position is (1 + N)/2. So if N-2 is even, then the number of empty cells between them is even, so there&#39;s no exact middle. Wait, maybe I need to check.Wait, the positions are 1 and N. The distance between them is N - 1 cells. The number of empty cells between them is N - 2. So if N is odd, then the distance between them is even, so there&#39;s an exact middle. For example, N=7. Positions 1 and 7. Distance is 6 cells. Middle is position 4. So if N is odd, the initial middle can be filled. If N is even, the distance is odd, so there&#39;s no exact middle. Hmm, so maybe the parity of N affects the process?But the problem states that eventually all cells are filled. So the process must be possible regardless of N? Wait, but maybe N has to be a specific number. The problem says &quot;less than 100 cells&quot;, but maybe it&#39;s a power of 2 plus one? Because each time you split the gaps into halves, which might require the length to be a power of two.Wait, maybe this is similar to a binary division process. Let me think. If we start with two ends, and each time we fill the middle, splitting the row into two segments, each of which can then be filled by placing pieces in their middles, and so on recursively. This process would require the length of the row to be 2^k + 1, where k is the number of divisions. For example, 3 cells: 1 and 3 filled, place in 2. 5 cells: 1 and 5, place in 3; then 1 and 3, place in 2; 3 and 5, place in 4. Then done. So 5 cells take 3 steps? Wait, each placement is one piece. Let&#39;s count:Starting with 2 pieces. To fill 5 cells, you need 3 more pieces. Each student places 9 pieces. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the total number of cells is N. Initially, 2 are filled. Then, students place pieces until all N cells are filled. Each student places 9 pieces. We need to find how many students there are, given that N &lt; 100.But maybe we can figure out N first? Since the placement is done in such a way that each time you can only place in the middle of existing pieces. So maybe the number of required pieces is N - 2. Each student contributes 9 pieces, so the number of students is (N - 2)/9, but since it&#39;s an integer, N - 2 must be a multiple of 9, so N = 9k + 2. But since N &lt; 100, k can be up to 10 (since 9*10 + 2 = 92 &lt; 100, 9*11 + 2 = 101 which is over). But is N necessarily 9k + 2? Wait, maybe not, because the placement process might have some constraints on N.Alternatively, maybe the number of moves required to fill the row is related to the number of cells. But the process is similar to building a binary tree, where each split takes a certain number of moves. But since each move is placing one piece, perhaps the number of moves required is N - 2, but with some structure on how they can be placed.Alternatively, maybe each time you place a piece, it splits a gap into two smaller gaps. The initial gap is N - 1 cells long (from 1 to N). But the first placement is in the middle, splitting the gap into two gaps each of length (N - 1)/2 - 1. Wait, perhaps it&#39;s similar to the concept of the number of moves required to fill the cells, which might be similar to the number of internal nodes in a binary tree. Wait, in a binary tree, the number of internal nodes is equal to the number of leaves minus one. But maybe that&#39;s not directly applicable here.Wait, another approach. Let&#39;s think about the process. Starting with two pieces. Each time you place a piece, it has to be in the middle of two existing pieces. So each placement effectively connects two existing pieces with a new one in between. This is similar to building a binary tree where each node is placed between two existing nodes. But each placement requires that there is a pair of existing pieces with an empty cell exactly in the middle.So, the number of moves needed to fill a row of N cells starting from the ends would be N - 2, since we start with 2 and need to add N - 2 pieces. Since each student places 9 pieces, the number of students would be (N - 2)/9. Since students are integer numbers, (N - 2) must be divisible by 9, so N = 9k + 2. However, N must also be such that it&#39;s possible to fill the entire row by the given rule, which probably requires N to be one more than a power of 2. Because each time you split the intervals, you need to have intervals that can be split again.Wait, for example, if N = 3 = 2^1 + 1, then you can place 1 piece. For N = 5 = 2^2 + 1, you need 3 pieces. For N = 9 = 2^3 + 1, you need 7 pieces. Wait, that&#39;s 2^(k) - 1 pieces needed for N = 2^k + 1. Wait, 3 cells: 1 piece, which is 2^1 - 1. 5 cells: 3 pieces, which is 2^2 - 1. 9 cells: 7 pieces, which is 2^3 - 1. So in general, for N = 2^k + 1, the number of pieces needed is 2^k - 1. Therefore, the number of students would be (2^k - 1)/9. So 2^k - 1 must be divisible by 9. Let&#39;s check for which k this is possible.Find k such that 2^k ≡ 1 mod 9. The powers of 2 modulo 9 cycle every 6:2^1 = 2 mod 92^2 = 4 mod 92^3 = 8 mod 92^4 = 16 ≡ 7 mod 92^5 = 14 ≡ 5 mod 92^6 = 10 ≡ 1 mod 9So 2^6 ≡ 1 mod 9. Therefore, 2^k ≡ 1 mod 9 when k is a multiple of 6. Therefore, 2^k - 1 is divisible by 9 when k is a multiple of 6. So the smallest k is 6, giving N = 2^6 + 1 = 65. Then the number of pieces needed is 2^6 - 1 = 63. Therefore, the number of students is 63 / 9 = 7. Since N=65 is less than 100, that works. If k=12, N=4097, which is way over 100, so the only possible N under 100 is 65. Therefore, the number of students is 7.Wait, but the problem states &quot;several students take turns placing chess pieces... Each of these students placed 9 pieces, resulting in each cell containing exactly one piece.&quot; So if N=65, total pieces placed by students is 65 - 2 = 63, so 63 / 9 = 7 students. Therefore, the answer is 7.But let me verify. Let&#39;s take N=65. So starting with two ends. First, place a piece in the middle, which is position 33. Now we have two gaps: 1-33 and 33-65. Each of these gaps is 32 cells long. Then, in each of these gaps, we can place a piece in their middles: positions 17 and 49. Then each of those splits the gaps into 16 cells each. Continuing this way, each time doubling the number of pieces placed. So the number of pieces per &quot;level&quot; would be 1, then 2, then 4, then 8, 16, 32. But wait, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63. So that&#39;s 6 levels. But each student places 9 pieces. So how does that divide?Wait, maybe the process isn&#39;t done level by level. Because in reality, each placement is one piece, and students take turns placing 9 each. So the order in which pieces are placed could affect how many each student does. Wait, but the problem states that &quot;each of these students placed 9 pieces&quot;, meaning that all students placed exactly 9 pieces. So the total number of pieces placed by students must be a multiple of 9. Which in this case, 63 is a multiple of 9 (63 = 7*9), so there are 7 students.But how does the process of placing 63 pieces with each student placing 9 work? If you can place one piece at a time, but the placement depends on available gaps. So in the first move, only the middle can be placed. Then the next two moves can place the middles of the two new gaps. Then the next four moves, etc. So the number of moves doubles each time. So the total number of moves is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63. So these are 6 rounds, each round having 2^(k) moves. But each student is placing 9 pieces. So 63 divided by 9 is 7 students. So each student would have to place 9 pieces across different rounds. But since each round has a certain number of moves, perhaps the students take turns placing one piece each per round?Wait, but the problem says &quot;several students take turns placing chess pieces&quot;. So maybe they take turns one after another, each placing one piece at a time. Each time a student places a piece, it&#39;s their turn. After 9 pieces, it&#39;s the next student&#39;s turn. So the total number of turns is 63, so the number of students is 63 / 9 = 7. So yes, 7 students. Therefore, the answer is 7.But let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose N=3, which requires 1 piece. If each student places 9 pieces, but since only 1 piece is needed, then it would be 1 student? Wait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, it&#39;s given that each student placed 9 pieces, and the result is all cells filled. So in the case of N=3, you can&#39;t have each student place 9 pieces because you only need 1. So the problem must have N such that N - 2 is a multiple of 9. So N=65 is 63, which is 7*9. So the answer is 7 students.Another check: N=65. The process would require 63 moves, which is 7 students each doing 9. So the answer is 7. Therefore, boxed{7}Final Answerboxed{7}&lt;/think&gt;Given a row of less than 100 cells with chess pieces initially at both ends, students take turns placing pieces such that each new piece must be placed in the middle of two adjacent existing pieces. Each student places 9 pieces, and all cells are eventually filled. We need to determine the number of students.1. Initial Setup: The row starts with two pieces at the ends. The number of cells ( N ) must be such that all cells can be filled by placing pieces in the middle of existing gaps.2. Key Insight: The process of filling cells is similar to a binary division process. Each placement splits a gap into two smaller gaps, which can then be further split. This requires ( N ) to be ( 2^k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ), ensuring the gaps can be repeatedly split until all cells are filled.3. Divisibility Check: The total number of pieces to be placed is ( N - 2 ). This number must be divisible by 9 since each student places 9 pieces. Thus, ( N - 2 ) must be a multiple of 9.4. Finding ( N ): The smallest ( N ) under 100 that fits the form ( 2^k + 1 ) and satisfies ( N - 2 equiv 0 mod 9 ) is ( 65 ). Here, ( 65 = 2^6 + 1 ), and ( 65 - 2 = 63 ), which is divisible by 9.5. Number of Students: Dividing the total number of pieces by 9 gives ( 63 / 9 = 7 ).Thus, the number of students is (boxed{7}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there&#39;s a row of less than 100 cells. Initially, only the two end cells have chess pieces. Students take turns placing one piece at a time, and each piece has to be placed in the middle of two adjacent cells that already have pieces. Eventually, they filled all the cells with pieces, and each student placed 9 pieces. The question is, how many students are there?Hmm. Let me start by visualizing the initial setup. Suppose there are N cells in the row, where N is less than 100. The first and the Nth cells have chess pieces. The students need to fill the remaining N-2 cells. Each time a student places a piece, it has to be in the middle of two adjacent pieces. Wait, but the example says that if there are pieces in 3rd and 7th cells, then the 5th can be placed, but if it&#39;s 4th and 7th, then 5th and 6th can&#39;t be placed. Wait, the middle of two adjacent cells? Maybe I need to clarify the rule.The problem states: &quot;it must be placed in the middle of two adjacent cells that already contain pieces.&quot; So, if there are two adjacent cells with pieces, you can place a piece in the middle of them. Wait, but two adjacent cells already have pieces. The middle of two adjacent cells would be between them, but if they&#39;re adjacent, there&#39;s no cell in between. For example, if two pieces are on cells 3 and 4, then there&#39;s no space in between. But the example given is if there&#39;s a gap. Wait, in the example, 3rd and 7th cells have pieces, and 4th, 5th, 6th are empty. Then, you can place a piece in the 5th cell. So perhaps the rule is that if there are two pieces with some empty cells in between, you can place a piece in the exact middle of them? But the problem says &quot;middle of two adjacent cells&quot;. Wait, maybe the translation is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe &quot;middle between two cells that already have pieces, regardless of the distance between them.&quot;Wait, the example says: if 3rd and 7th cells have pieces, then 5th can be placed. So, 3 and 7 are four cells apart, the middle is 5. So that&#39;s the key. If there are two pieces with some cells in between, you can place a piece in the exact middle cell. Similarly, if there&#39;s an even number of cells in between, then there&#39;s no exact middle, so you can&#39;t place? For example, if there are two pieces at positions 4 and 7, which are 3 cells apart (positions 4, 5, 6, 7), so the middle would be 5.5, which isn&#39;t an integer, so you can&#39;t place. Hence, you can only place a piece between two existing pieces if the distance between them is odd, so that there&#39;s an exact middle cell. That makes sense with the example given.Therefore, the rule is: you can place a piece in a cell if there are two existing pieces such that the cell you&#39;re placing is exactly in the middle of them. So, given two existing pieces at positions i and j, where j &gt; i, if (i + j) is even, then you can place a piece at (i + j)/2. Otherwise, if (i + j) is odd, there&#39;s no integer middle, so you can&#39;t place there.Therefore, each placement of a piece effectively splits the interval between two existing pieces into two intervals. So, for example, starting with pieces at 1 and N. If you place a piece in the middle, which is (1 + N)/2. Then, that splits the row into two intervals: 1 to (1 + N)/2 and (1 + N)/2 to N. Each of these intervals can then be split again by placing pieces in their middles, provided the interval length is greater than 1.This seems similar to a binary division process. Each time you place a piece, you split an interval into two smaller intervals, each of which can be split again. The process continues until all intervals are length 1, meaning all cells are filled.Given that, the total number of pieces to be placed is N - 2, since initially there are two pieces. Each student places 9 pieces, so the number of students would be (N - 2)/9. But since the problem states that each student placed 9 pieces and the entire row is filled, N - 2 must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the number of students is (N - 2)/9. However, we need to determine N first.But wait, the problem says there are less than 100 cells. So N &lt; 100. Also, the initial positions are at both ends, so the row must be at least 2 cells. But we need to find N such that N - 2 is divisible by 9, and N is a number that can be constructed by this splitting process.But wait, the splitting process is similar to building a binary tree where each node is the midpoint of its parent interval. The total number of intervals needed to split the entire row into individual cells would be N - 1. However, each placement of a piece splits one interval into two, so the number of pieces required is N - 2, as each split increases the number of intervals by 1, starting from 1 interval (the entire row) to N intervals (each cell). Therefore, the number of splits needed is N - 1 - 1 = N - 2. So, the number of pieces is N - 2.But each student places 9 pieces, so the number of students is (N - 2)/9. But N must be such that N - 2 is divisible by 9. Also, N must be a power of 2 plus 1? Wait, no. Because the splitting process can be done in different orders, but the total number of splits required is fixed. However, the key is that the initial row must be a length that is a power of 2 plus 1. Wait, no, actually, if you start with positions 1 and N, then the first split is at (1 + N)/2. For that to be an integer, (1 + N) must be even, so N must be odd. Then, after splitting, each sub-interval must also be splittable. For example, if N is 2^k + 1, then each split would result in intervals that are also of length 2^{k-1} + 1. Wait, perhaps the row length must be one more than a power of two. Let&#39;s check with small examples.Suppose N = 3. Then initial pieces at 1 and 3. The middle is 2, so you can place a piece there. Total pieces: 3. So N - 2 = 1, so one piece is placed. If each student placed 9 pieces, but here only 1 piece is needed, which is less than 9. So N can&#39;t be 3. Wait, but in this problem, the total pieces placed are N - 2, so if N = 3, then 1 piece. If N = 5, then 3 pieces. If N = 9, then 7 pieces. Wait, that doesn&#39;t seem like power of two plus one. Wait, perhaps another approach.Alternatively, consider that each time you place a piece, it&#39;s in the middle of two existing pieces, which could be the result of previous placements. The key is that the row must be able to be completely filled by this process, meaning that all gaps between pieces can be split until every cell is filled. For this to be possible, the initial length must be a power of two plus one. Wait, let&#39;s test.If N = 3: 1, _, 3. Place at 2. Now all filled. So N = 3 = 2^1 + 1.If N = 5: 1, _, _, _, 5. Place at 3. Now 1, _, 3, _, 5. Then, between 1 and 3: place at 2. Between 3 and 5: place at 4. Then all filled. So N = 5 = 2^2 + 1.Similarly, N = 9: 1, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, 9. Place at 5. Then split into 1-5 and 5-9. Then each of those can be split at 3 and 7, and so on. So N = 9 = 2^3 + 1.Therefore, it seems that N must be 2^k + 1 for some k. Then, the number of pieces to place is N - 2 = 2^k + 1 - 2 = 2^k - 1. Therefore, if N is 2^k + 1, then the number of pieces needed is 2^k - 1.But in the problem, the number of pieces each student placed is 9, so total number of pieces is 9 * number of students. Therefore, 2^k - 1 must be divisible by 9, and N = 2^k + 1 &lt; 100.So, we need to find k such that 2^k ≡ 1 mod 9, because 2^k - 1 ≡ 0 mod 9. So 2^k ≡ 1 mod 9.Let&#39;s compute 2^k mod 9:2^1 = 2 mod 92^2 = 4 mod 92^3 = 8 mod 92^4 = 16 ≡ 7 mod 92^5 = 32 ≡ 5 mod 92^6 = 64 ≡ 1 mod 9Ah, so 2^6 ≡ 1 mod 9. Then the cycle repeats every 6. So 2^k ≡ 1 mod 9 when k ≡ 0 mod 6.Therefore, k must be a multiple of 6. Let&#39;s check k = 6:2^6 = 64. Then N = 64 + 1 = 65. Then number of pieces is 64 - 1 = 63. 63 / 9 = 7 students. So 7 students. But N = 65 is less than 100.Next multiple, k = 12: 2^12 = 4096. N = 4097, which is way over 100. So the only possible k is 6, leading to N = 65. Therefore, number of students is 7.Wait, let&#39;s verify. If N = 65, which is 2^6 + 1 = 65. The number of pieces to place is 65 - 2 = 63. Each student places 9 pieces, so 63 / 9 = 7 students. So answer is 7.But let me make sure that this is the only possible N less than 100. So N = 2^k + 1 &lt; 100. So 2^k &lt; 99. 2^6 = 64 &lt; 99, 2^7 = 128 &gt; 99. So only k=6 gives N=65 &lt; 100. Therefore, the answer is 7 students.Wait, but is there another possible N that is not of the form 2^k +1, but still allows the entire row to be filled? For example, maybe a composite number?Wait, let&#39;s think. Suppose N is 7. Then, N = 7. It&#39;s not 2^k +1. Let&#39;s see if we can fill it.Start with 1 and 7. Place at 4. Now 1, 4, 7. Then between 1 and 4, place at 2.5, which isn&#39;t integer. Wait, but 1 and 4 are 3 apart, so the middle is 2.5. So cannot place. Wait, then how?Alternatively, between 4 and 7: middle is 5.5. Also not integer. So actually, N=7 might not be possible. Wait, maybe my initial assumption that N must be 2^k +1 is correct.Alternatively, perhaps other N can be filled if they have factors of 2^k +1. Hmm. Maybe not. Let&#39;s see.Suppose N = 9. Which is 2^3 +1. Then you can fill it as per the process. But if N=7, which is not 2^k +1, maybe you can&#39;t fill it. So in order for the entire row to be filled with the splitting process, the length must be 2^k +1. Therefore, the only N less than 100 is 65, leading to 7 students.Therefore, the answer is 7. So boxed{7}Final Answerboxed{7}&lt;/think&gt;Given a row of cells with less than 100 cells, initially containing chess pieces at both ends, students take turns placing pieces in the middle of two adjacent existing pieces. Each student places 9 pieces, and all cells are eventually filled. We need to determine the number of students.1. Initial Setup: The row starts with pieces at both ends. Let ( N ) be the total number of cells, which must be less than 100.2. Key Insight: To fill all cells, the number of pieces to be placed is ( N - 2 ). Each student places 9 pieces, so the number of students is (frac{N - 2}{9}).3. Splitting Process: The row must be filled by placing pieces in the middle of existing intervals. This requires ( N ) to be of the form ( 2^k + 1 ) to ensure all intervals can be split evenly.4. Modular Arithmetic: The number of pieces ( N - 2 ) must be divisible by 9. This translates to finding ( k ) such that ( 2^k equiv 1 mod 9 ). The smallest such ( k ) is 6, leading to ( N = 2^6 + 1 = 65 ).5. Verification: For ( N = 65 ), the number of pieces to place is ( 65 - 2 = 63 ). Dividing by 9 gives ( 63 / 9 = 7 ) students.Thus, the number of students is (boxed{7}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cf77425d></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cf77425d><span class="icon" data-v-cf77425d>🔑:</span>【Solution】Solution: According to the problem, if there are an even number of empty spaces between two adjacent chess pieces, no more pieces can be placed in between. Therefore, to place a chess piece in every space, the number of empty spaces between each pair of adjacent pieces should be odd after each placement.In the first round, only 1 piece can be placed in the middle, dividing the spaces into the front half and the back half. In the second round, 1 piece can be placed in the middle of each half, totaling 2 pieces, which then divides the spaces into 4 parts. In the third round, 1 piece can be placed in the middle of each part, totaling 4 pieces, and so on. The total number of pieces placed should be the sum of the geometric sequence 1,2,4,8, cdots. Since each person places 9 times, this sum is a multiple of 9 and cannot exceed 100. By enumeration, we get 1+2+4+8+16+32=63, which meets the condition, so there are 63 div 9=7 students, and the distribution of the chess pieces is as follows:1,651,33,651,17,33,49,651,9,17,25,33,41,49,57,65,cdotsTherefore, the answer is 7.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-d29b9650><span data-v-d29b9650>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR1</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
